   <HEADLINE> TRYING TO PULL THE PLUG ; BIG OIL_COMPANIES SPONSOR EFFORTS TO CURTAIL ELECTRIC , NATURAL_GAS CARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As California presses ahead with its rule forcing auto_makers to sell cleaner-fueled vehicles , including a virtual mandate to sell electric_cars beginning in 1998 , big oil_companies have been largely silent . But now the companies have found their voice -- or , more accurately , the voice of others -- by quietly bankrolling what on its face appears to be a grass-roots campaign against $ 600 million in proposed utility investments in alternative-vehicle support_systems . A new group called Californians Against Utility Company Abuse -- run_by Woodward &amp; McDowell , a high-powered Burlingame , Calif.-based public relations firm -- gathered petitions and demonstrated Wednesday in front of a regional office of Southern California Gas Co . The group also recently mailed a letter to 200 # 000 utility ratepayers statewide . It does not mention oil_industry support in its literature . In response , a freshly forged coalition of the utilities , labor and environmental groups is angrily burning_up fax machines across the state , labeling the tactics of its opponents a &quot; dirty trick. &quot; Until now , the debate over alternative-fuel vehicles has focused_on efforts by the Big Three auto_makers to weaken or delay the state ' s mandate for introducing electric_cars by 1998 . But many proponents are now convinced that the mandate will be upheld by the California Air Resources Board next month , citing the as-yet-unwavering support of Gov . Pete Wilson ' s administration , as well as a final report by the ARB staff , expected to be released later this week , that proponents say will confirm that the technology will be there to meet the 1998 deadline . The oil-company-funded letter urges taxpayers to send accompanying postcards to their state legislators in support of two bills designed to curtail utility company plans currently before the Public_Utilities Commission . Required by state law , these are plans by the gas and electric utilities to promote the use of natural_gas and electric fuel . The utilities propose to spend the money -- charged to ratepayers , not shareholders -- on public refueling stations , rebates for car buyers and other infrastructure support for the new vehicles . * Opponents argue that this amounts to a subsidy by ratepayers of alternative-fuel vehicles that will benefit only the few who can afford to buy them . The mailing cites two prominent consumer groups -- Toward Utility Rate Normalization and Utility Consumers Action Network -- as well as the California Business Alliance and other business groups as supporters . But it does not mention that the effort is almost entirely funded by the Western States Petroleum Assn. , which represents oil_companies . The Clean Air Alliance , a new parallel group that presents technical and economic arguments against electric_cars , is also funded primarily by the oil_industry . &quot; It ' s clearly our money , &quot; said Douglas F . Henderson , executive_director of the Western States Petroleum Assn. , based in Glendale , who added that he did not have a figure for how much money the association has put into the effort . &quot; We think there ' s a far better alternative &quot; to mandating use of alternative fuels , Henderson said , &quot; and that ' s the use of our products . . . . And you may think that ' s selfish , but our industry is spending $ 5 billion in California alone to upgrade our refineries to supply the new generation of gasoline , which is a very clean alternative. &quot; * All gasoline sold in the state as of next January must meet federal standards for cleaner-burning , so-called reformulated gasoline . The state ' s much stricter reformulated blend must be used beginning in March , 1996 . The oil_companies have long argued that reformulated gasolines and improved auto engines can meet air_pollution emission standards without the need to resort_to electric and natural_gas cars . In the letter to ratepayers , TURN Executive_Director Audrie Krause and Howard R . Owens , legislative director of the Congress of California Seniors , call the utilities ' request a &quot; hidden_tax on your gas and electric_bill &quot; and urge that fellow taxpayers &quot; join California consumers , seniors , business and farmers in this ratepayer revolt. &quot; Krause and Owens urge support for SB 1819 , introduced by state Sen . David Kelley ( R-San Diego ) and AB 3239 by Assemblyman Mickey Conroy ( R-Orange ) . Krause says TURN and the oil_companies just happen to be_on the same side in this dispute . &quot; The Kelley bill is TURN ' s bill , &quot; Krause said . &quot; We wrote it , we sponsored it and the oil_industry chose to support it . We didn ' t come_to them . They came_to us. &quot; The new group on the other side of the issue -- Santa Monica-based Californians for Jobs and Clean Air -- represents the utilities , environmental groups and businesses entering the advanced-transportation industry . &quot; That the oil_companies are starting what they call a grass-roots effort . . . makes me feel the most positive yet that electric vehicles are really going_to happen , &quot; said Diane O . Wittenberg , manager of electric transportation at Southern California Edison Co . Wittenberg said the new oil industry-consumer coalition is not only unfairly secretive but misrepresents the benefits of the utilities ' plan . Not only are electric and natural_gas cars necessary to meet clean-air goals , she says , but in a future substantial shift from gasoline to electricity as a transportation fuel , ratepayers would actually save because the costs of the utility infrastructure would be spread_over a larger customer base . Indeed , Edison estimates that in coming decades , a 20 % to 30 % market penetration by electric_cars could save ratepayers as much as $ 11 on their monthly bills . As for the secrecy , Henderson of the oil trade group admits that &quot; people are often more willing to join hands with a coalition than they are to join hands with the petroleum industry , and that ' s fine . . . . We ' re not ashamed of it at all. &quot; Ever-Cleaner California Cars As part of California ' s requirement to meet federal clean-air health standards , the state Air Resources Board in 1990 adopted a plan to dramatically lower emissions from vehicles , which are estimated to cause more_than 70 % of the state ' s air_pollution . The plan , currently under review , mandates a potentially wide-ranging shift of vehicles and fuels between 1998 and 2003 . * Categories of vehicles required under ARB plan and their most likely fuels : 03 # 19 , 21 # 30 Allowed hydrocarbon emissions Vehicle type ( grams per mile ) Likely fuel Federal standard 0.25 Reformulated gasoline LEV ( low-emission 0.075 Reformulated gasoline vehicle ) ULEV ( ultra-low- 0.04 Natural_gas ; some emission vehicle ) electric-other fuel hybrids ; perhaps some reformulated gasoline ZEV ( zero- Electricity ; longer-term ; emission vehicle ) hydrogen fuel_cells THE CHANGING MIX OF CALIFORNIA CARS Deadlines for introduction of vehicle types in California , based on estimated total new vehicle sales of 2 million a year ( figures in thousands ) : 2003 : Federal standard : LEV : 1 # 500 , 000 ULEV : 300 # 000 ZEV : 200 # 000 Source : California Air Resources Board</TEXT>
