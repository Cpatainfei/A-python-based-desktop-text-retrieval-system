   <HEADLINE> WEST COVINA BOARD OKS MEAL PLAN FOR STUDENTS ; EDUCATION : RANCOROUS DEBATE PRECEDES 3-1 VOTE . REPORTS OF CHILDREN TOO HUNGRY TO LEARN PROMPTED THE ACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Capping a weeks-long uproar over reports that some schoolchildren were coming_to class too hungry to learn , the West Covina school_board Tuesday voted for the first time in district history to take_advantage of a longstanding government breakfast program . The 3-1 vote by the West Covina Unified School District trustees followed more_than an hour of rancorous debate over whether the schools , in grappling with a growing number of hungry children in the classroom , should assume a responsibility many in the conservative district felt belongs_to parents . In the end , board_members said the program was necessary and long overdue . &quot; If we are going_to break the poverty cycle of these kids , we have to feed them , &quot; said trustee Pete Sabatino . &quot; To learn , they have to have full tummies. &quot; Although federally funded breakfasts for low-income students have long been available to school districts , thousands of schools nationwide have not taken_advantage . Last month , in a series of articles in The Times on hunger that highlighted the situation , West Covina ' s Edgewood Middle_School was profiled as an example of the 193 schools in Southern California that do not offer breakfast even though they have high proportions of needy children . Since then , many of the schools -- including eight in West Covina -- have joined a recent rush to apply for the program , administered by the state Education_Department largely with federal dollars . Most schools that offer breakfast fully recoup their costs through government reimbursements , a California study showed . The West Covina vote followed weeks of soul-searching and public_debate for members of the suburban San Gabriel Valley community . At least one group took matters into their own hands in the wake of The Times ' series , mobilizing their own , private breakfast effort at Edgewood Middle_School . Others stood_firm in their philosophical opposition to such programs . Although the school breakfast issue had been brought_up before in the district , faculty , administrators and one board_member had contended that the board did not implement the program earlier because of its conservative philosophy regarding the role of schools . Board President Mike Spence , who has contended in the past that subsidized school breakfasts are anti-family , reiterated his opposition Tuesday night in casting the lone no vote . &quot; I realize what I ' m saying isn ' t politically correct , &quot; Spence said . &quot; But for the last 40 years , we have spent bazillions on anti-poverty and anti-hunger programs and it hasn ' t helped. &quot; Spence said programs such_as the private breakfast initiative were more appropriate for the community , and that Tuesday ' s vote will only create a dependency by the district on a program that may be slashed in the near future . The new Republican majority in Congress , in its &quot; contract with America , &quot; has said it will terminate federal child nutrition programs and turn them over to the states , with sizable funding cuts . Moreover , Spence said , he recently visited a San Gabriel Valley school that has a government breakfast program and was &quot; sickened &quot; to see how much food is thrown_away by children . He said the program is riddled with fraud because parents ' declaration of income on the application_form goes unchecked . However , the majority of letters to the board and speakers Tuesday disagreed_with Spence . One kindergarten student wrote simply , &quot; I hope you never have to go hungry. &quot; Edgewood parent Mercedes Gil urged the board &quot; to nourish not only ( children ' s ) bodies , but allow teachers to nourish their minds. &quot; Another resident , teacher Barbara Evleth , said : &quot; We get a hefty tax_bill from the federal_government . I want my tax dollars to be spent here , on the children of West Covina. &quot; The vote left longtime proponents of the program feeling vindicated . The district hopes to have subsidized breakfasts operating by Feb . 1 at eight of West Covina Unified ' s 11 schools . &quot; There are a lot of people against Big Brother , &quot; Sabatino said . &quot; But it ' s a social necessity for these underprivileged students . You can ' t get_out of poverty if you can ' t get an education , and you can ' t get an education if you are hungry . It ' s basic. &quot; Tony Reymann , who calls himself the board ' s lone liberal , said he is elated . &quot; Some people call it bad press . I call it an awakening to get these guys ( his fellow board_members ) on to the fact that West Covina does have hungry children , &quot; he said . Reymann , who teaches in El Monte ' s Valle Lindo School District , said he grappled with hungry children in his classroom before his school began a breakfast program several years ago . He fed them apples and oranges . &quot; Not having kids hungry makes them more alert in the morning , more eager to learn , &quot; Reymann said . Last month , he donated his $ 240 monthly school_board stipend to the private effort to feed children breakfast at Edgewood Middle_School . Meanwhile , Edgewood Principal Cathy Makin said the school -- which received more_than 500 calls_in the two weeks after publication of the story -- continues to receive assistance . On Tuesday night , the school received a $ 5 # 000 donation from Kaiser Permanente for the private breakfast program , and the school has counted $ 7 # 500 in other large donations , including $ 5 # 000 from Citrus Valley Health Partners , parent company of Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina . Another $ 10 # 000 pledge has not yet been received , and the school has not tallied a flurry of individual donations , Makin said . The school is putting the donations into a special account to be used in the private breakfast feeding effort , which has supplied more_than 200 hungry children per day with a morning meal . Bernell McBride , a retired executive who spearheaded efforts to start the privately funded breakfast program at Edgewood , said : &quot; These kids are happy and eating . They feel the love of people trying to help . that ' s all. &quot; * Times staff writer Shawn Hubler contributed to this story .</TEXT>
