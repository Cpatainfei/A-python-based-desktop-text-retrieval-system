   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : PLATFORM ; SHOULD EVERYBODY SPEAK ENGLISH ON JOB ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last Monday , the Supreme Court ruled that requiring bilingual workers to speak English on_the_job does not violate federal anti-discrimination laws . The issue has strong proponents on each side . A sampling : KATHRYN IMAHARA Attorney , Asian Pacific American Legal Center , Los Angeles I ' m afraid that this ruling gives employers the wrong idea that they can institute these types of English-only rules and that they will be legal . In this instance there was no finding of constitutionality or unconstitutionality . There wasn ' t any substantive discussion . Because of that , California laws are intact , even though they have not been tested yet . I would like employees to know that they do have rights in the workplace , that if they do encounter an English-only rule_in the workplace they need to fight it because it is discriminatory . I am all for everyone learning to speak English , but there is a big difference between having the opportunity to learn and having it shoved down your throat . Lots of immigrants are just too busy just trying to survive ( to take the few free English_classes available ) . PAT BAKER Member of U.S. English , a group that advocates English as America ' s common language ; San Diego resident In most workplaces you are trying to develop a team relationship . If you have people speaking a different language , that can only cause a rift . I ' m not saying that people immigrating to this country shouldn ' t be able to keep their language and customs . But suppose people in the workplace were just chatting in a foreign language and it wasn ' t job-related . The other people don ' t know that . They don ' t know whether they are being excluded from information they should have . R.G. WELLING Executive_vice_president and chief operating officer , Parke Industries , Glendora ; designs , manufactures and installs energy-efficient lighting for office_buildings The military took me to to Germany . I took a European discharge and I attended a German university . I found it very advantageous to learn to speak German . It was a display of respect . Also , my wife is German . In our business operation , the most compelling factor is safety . We operate punch_presses , brake presses that can be dangerous , forklifts that pickup pretty sizable weights . With the safety_factor alone , you have to understand English and be able to speak it very clearly . We have Mexicans , Colombians , East Indians , people from all_over the place . We think it ' s great for them to speak in their native language when they have their lunch breaks . But business should be conducted in English . LORETTA HUANG Coordinator of the Alhambra School District ' s adult_education program I fully support the idea of English-only . Yet at_the_same_time we should not discourage the use of languages that the people feel comfortable using in different social interactions , including work . To go from non-English proficiency to limited English to fluent English , to feeling comfortable with the multicultural mainstream of American life , it takes a long_time . I have encouraged my staff to use English as much as possible . Most of our students are committed to learning English . But often they are bashful , embarrassed and uncomfortable in not knowing what to say because they don ' t have the vocabulary . By using a language they are familiar_with , they can learn English . AIDA DIMARANAN Filipino nurse , Rowland Heights ; sued hospital because it required her to speak English . Case settled out of court Just two days ago , this other nurse came_in from another department . I don ' t know her . So she just kind of made a comment in Filipino , in Tagalog . She said something like : &quot; Every time I come_to your place it ' s just so busy. &quot; I said in Tagalog , &quot; Oh , yeah , it ' s so busy here . Is there anything I can do ? &quot; You know , just offering her help . It ' s to build a rapport . She can express her feelings in Tagalog . It ' s just automatic . Maybe I can express what I want to say in English . But it is just so different , better when I can say it in my own language . I ' m not just speaking_for my own feelings but for Vietnamese and Korean nurses . When I see them speaking their language , I feel better . I don ' t feel_like it ' s rude . In front of a patient , I think it ' s not right to speak a language other_than English , if it is a white patient or a black patient . If two Filipinos or two Korean nurses start talking in their language , we should be very careful . It is just courtesy to the patient .</TEXT>
