   <TEXT> California is starting to look beyond the political rhetoric of the new &quot; three strikes &quot; law and consider the local impact . The picture isn ' t pretty -- and should cause voters considerable pause in November . An Orange County Administrative Office report this week addressed the likely effects of the new law , which mandates prison sentences of 25 years to life for those convicted three times of violent or so-called serious crimes . The report provides grounds for opposing a similar &quot; three strikes &quot; statute that will be_on the November ballot . For one thing , the ballot measure largely duplicates the recently passed law ; for another , the costs of implementing any &quot; three strikes &quot; measure are likely to be greater than first thought . Orange County officials predicted the need for many_more trials as felons refuse plea bargains ; and the increased level of incarceration will probably force jails to release drunken drivers , burglars and other &quot; minor &quot; criminals sooner than they should . The law also will trigger a greater demand for welfare benefits from convicts ' families ; more children from convict families will wind_up in government custody . Los Angeles Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti already has stopped filing new cases involving worker safety , environmental crimes and major fraud in_order to handle the &quot; three strikes &quot; load . New state_prisons will cost billions to build and operate . The months ahead are likely to spell_out the true costs of hasty , politically expedient legislation . Passage of a &quot; three strikes &quot; ballot measure would merely compound the error .</TEXT>
