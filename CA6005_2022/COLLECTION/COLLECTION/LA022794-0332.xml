   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN REVOLT LEADERS WALK_OUT OF PRISON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gleeful , unrepentant leaders of the bloody revolt that ended in flames at Russia ' s White_House last October walked_out_of prison over President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s belated objections Saturday as an amnesty granted by the new Parliament took_effect . Former Vice_President Alexander V . Rutskoi , former Parliament Chairman Ruslan I . Khasbulatov and five prominent extremists embraced family members and supporters amid a shower of bouquets , a flurry of red Soviet flags and cries_for renewed anti-government activism . &quot; Well done , guys , it ' s our day today ! &quot; shouted lawmaker Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , one of more_than 200 well-wishers gathered_in the snow outside Moscow ' s Lefortovo Prison . An alliance of Communists and Zhirinovsky ' s neo-fascists stunned the government by pushing the amnesty to approval Wednesday . Rutskoi , hustled into the prison last Oct . 4 in combat_fatigues and a bristling mustache , emerged Saturday in his medal-bedecked general ' s uniform and sporting a bushy beard . &quot; Rutskoi is president ! &quot; people chanted as the Afghan War hero smiled and waved . &quot; Put Yeltsin ' s gang on_trial ! &quot; The amnesty ends criminal proceedings against as_many as 17 figures in the two-day revolt , which had aimed to cancel Yeltsin ' s decree closing the Soviet-era Parliament and install Rutskoi in his place . More_than 140 people died before the army crushed the uprising with a tank assault . A dozen hard-liners on_trial for the brief overthrow of Soviet President Mikhail S . Gorbachev in August , 1991 , and 11 others arrested for rioting last May_Day also benefit from the amnesty . But they had been freed from jail long ago . The fate of the imprisoned October rebels thus became the first serious test of Yeltsin ' s willingness to obey his own 2-month-old constitution and avoid a showdown with the conservative Parliament elected at_the_same_time voters approved it . The constitution gives the Duma , or lower house , unchecked power to grant amnesties . But while the government complied with the law , its decision was the product of evident confusion and internal disagreement . The result seemed to offer little assurance of peace between Yeltsin and an opposition now emboldened by the liberation of its jailed heroes . The government newspaper Rossiskaya Gazeta published the amnesty Friday , making_it official . But on Saturday , Yeltsin asked Prosecutor General Alexei Kazannik to delay it . The president also dispatched an aide to urge Ivan Rybkin , the Communist chairman of the Duma , to return the measure to lawmakers for &quot; improvement. &quot; Yeltsin ' s argument was extremely technical : The Duma had erred by wording its resolution as if it was a pardon , which only the president can issue , rather than an amnesty . But before Rybkin could respond , Kazannik resigned , saying he could bring himself neither to sign an amnesty of &quot; murderers &quot; nor to obey an unconstitutional order to delay it . Within minutes , a deputy prosecutor signed the order allowing Rutskoi and company to walk . Even after the rebels were free , presidential advisers continued to criticize the amnesty and accused the prosecutor ' s office of acting in haste to apply it . One aide suggested the amnesty still might be modified . &quot; People who were ready to push Russia into a bloody civil_war were freed without trial , &quot; said Yeltsin spokesman Vyacheslav V . Kostikov , who accused the Duma of &quot; encouraging political extremism. &quot; &quot; The Russian president reserves the right to act in accordance with his constitutional powers in the illegal situation that has shaped_up , &quot; he added , explaining that Yeltsin might challenge the Duma ' s decision in the courts but not resort_to force . The men freed with Rutskoi and Khasbulatov were accused of leading military attacks on the Ostankino television studios and the Moscow mayor ' s office Oct . 3 -- under Rutskoi ' s direction from the White_House . Supporters said their freedom was nothing less than a vindication of the cause of restoring the Soviet_Union . &quot; I think Rutskoi should become president , &quot; said Natalya V . Arkhipova , a 42-year-old schoolteacher standing outside Lefortovo Prison . &quot; We received this country free_of capitalism , and he can help us leave it to our children exactly as we inherited it. &quot; Yegor T . Gaidar , the free-market reformer who resigned last month as economy minister , predicted in an interview with a German newspaper last week that the pardoned rebels will &quot; regroup and stage a new , better-organized coup . . . and set_up a nationalist-Communist government. &quot; The rebels gave little hint of their plans , other_than to go_home for dinner . Rutskoi and Khasbulatov simply thanked their supporters , waved and sped off -- the general in a Mercedes , the former chairman in a minivan escorted by four carloads of security_guards from his native Chechnya . &quot; If I find that prices have fallen and people are living better , that means Yeltsin will have been right &quot; about setting_up a market_economy , Anpilov told the crowd . &quot; Otherwise , I will carry_on fighting. &quot; Alexei V . Kuznetsov , a researcher in The Times ' Moscow Bureau , contributed to this article .</TEXT>
