   <HEADLINE> EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : SIMI VALLEY ; DETAILS OFFERED ON SEX EDUCATION PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Simi Valley residents on Monday night got their first chance to hear details of a controversial plan to add birth_control information to sex education curriculum in city schools . The first of two evening information-only meetings was held at Sequoia Junior_High_School to give residents the chance to ask questions about the sex education recommendations issued in December by a committee that studied the issue over three months . Kathy Burke , a parent and registered nurse , asked committee_members if they reviewed studies showing that sex education decreases teen-age pregnancies . Burke said she is aware of studies that only show an increase in teen-age sexual_activity . &quot; There are studies on both sides of the issue , &quot; said Leslie Crunelle , director of secondary_education who lead the committee . Committee_member Marge Chamberlain added , &quot; We looked_at the needs of the students , not the studies. &quot; Hundreds of community members on both sides of the debate had an opportunity to voice their opinions to board_members of the Simi Valley Unified School District on Dec . 14 when the committee ' s report first was issued . On Feb . 22 , the school_board will again listen to public testimony before voting on the proposal to add birth_control information to the curriculum in seventh and 10th grades . In addition to adding birth_control information , the committee recommended expanding lessons on overcoming peer pressure to have_sex and practicing abstinence to avoid disease and pregnancy . The second informational meeting is set for Jan . 20 at 6:30 p.m. at Berylwood Elementary School . Officials stressed that the Jan . 20 meeting is designed to inform the community about the proposal and is not set_up to take public views . BRENDA DAY</TEXT>
