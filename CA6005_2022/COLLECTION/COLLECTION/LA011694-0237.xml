   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; POLITICAL PROFITS OF GLOBE-TROTTING ; EUROPE : CLINTON LEARNS THAT A FOREIGN JAUNT CAN BE MORE FUN THAN STAYING HOME , AS WELL AS OFFERING A BOOST TO HIS IMAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For most of his first year as President , Bill_Clinton put_off the day when he would have to extend his laser-like focus beyond domestic policy to take_in foreign affairs . Last week , the day came . And , in a series of summit_meetings that took him across Europe to Russia and back again , he learned what many of his predecessors had found before him : Globe-trotting can be more fun and more politically profitable than staying home . As Washington bubbled_over Clinton ' s involvement in a murky Arkansas land deal , half a world away the President scored a foreign_policy coup by winning a new agreement on removing nuclear missiles from Ukraine . He won the Western Alliance an endorsement of a new , more inclusive blueprint for European security in post-Cold War Europe . He steadied Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin on the course of economic reform . What ' s more , he did_it all without any of the meddling by Congress and others that continuously frustrates his designs in Washington . With his walks and talks amid the spires and domes of Eastern Europe dominating the news images , he could say to a television interviewer that &quot; this has been a very , very successful trip &quot; without fear that faraway political rivals would invade his sound_bite . Clinton ' s shift in attention has come for several reasons . He needed to take_on European policy questions that had been crying_for his attention for a year . Even some aides acknowledge that these questions , which included the future of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization and fraying relations with America ' s historic partners in Western Europe , were neglected in Clinton ' s first year . And Clinton has recognized a political fact of life that his predecessors knew well : At home , the President must share power , but in foreign affairs , the authority to act -- and the credit -- is largely his alone . When he returns to Washington tonight , Clinton will bring_home at least one genuine accomplishment : an agreement from Ukraine to remove the nuclear_weapons left on its territory when the Soviet_Union disintegrated , beginning with the modern SS-24 missiles that U.S. military strategists feared most . If the accord is carried_out , it will be a significant success in the Administration ' s effort to stop the spread of nuclear_weapons from the former Soviet republics to other countries . To be sure , Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk faces internal opposition to carrying_out the agreement , so in the end the deal may_not fully live_up_to its billing . Even so , in terms of U.S. public_opinion , the week made America ' s &quot; domestic President &quot; four for four on international trips . On earlier journeys -- to meet Yeltsin in Vancouver , Canada , Pacific Rim leaders in Seattle and the chiefs of other big industrial nations in Tokyo -- he showed that he could handle economic summitry without a slip . This time , the week started on a wobbly note but seemed to gain momentum as the U.S. contingent moved toward Moscow . In Brussels , Clinton wanted to focus_on the new security alliance with the East European_nations but was forced to take_up the disagreeable_task of issuing new military threats to the Bosnian Serbs . In Prague in the Czech Republic , he won an endorsement of the &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; plan for the nations of Eastern Europe , but in the process he was forced again to face their criticism that the plan left them vulnerable to an unstable Russia . Still , signs were strewn along the way that Clinton is becoming more comfortable with the foreign affairs side of his job . Although the chemistry is not good with French President Francois Mitterrand and almost nonexistent with British Prime_Minister John Major , he got_along_with Yeltsin , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Czech President Vaclav Havel , and he accumulated generally good reviews from much of Europe along the way . A compulsive rewriter of his domestic speeches , Clinton usually sticks close to the text of his foreign_policy speeches . But in his remarks at the Ostankino television complex in Moscow , where only three months ago troops loyal to Yeltsin battled his enemies and more_than a dozen people died , he picked_up the editing pencil to rewrite a good chunk of his speech . The speech was the kind of personal_appeal he makes to Americans , and his engagement in them suggests he is most energized when he is translating his foreign_policy into domestic terms . On this trip , as at_home , Clinton spoke_of his sympathy for his audience ' s suffering , their need to embrace constant change and to gird themselves for the hard work of competing in the world economy . All this sounded eerily familiar to those who know Clinton ' s domestic speeches . But that was understandable , aides said , because Clinton ' s domestic policy is precisely the same as his foreign_policy . &quot; He ' s got only one stump_speech , &quot; an official said . The trip presented a feast of opportunities for political showmanship aimed as much at American as at foreign audiences . And it gave Clinton an opportunity to see if the image-making techniques -- and messages -- he has used in the United States could be applied to build support abroad . The big score , in the White_House ' s view , came from Clinton ' s televised town_hall meeting at Ostankino in Moscow . Officials hoped it would show average Russians a politician who could meet them at eye level . They got an unexpected payoff with a domestic audience from a widely rebroadcast scene in which a 13-year-old Russian boy who had seen a photo of Clinton as a teen-ager shaking hands with President John F . Kennedy asked when his presidential ambitions had begun to take_root , and Clinton invited him to shake his hand . &quot; Come shake hands with me , and maybe you ' ll be president of Russia some day , &quot; Clinton told him . But if Clinton avoided major blunders during the first European trip , he had some near-misses , including Ostankino . The affair may_not have been such a success with Clinton ' s Russian audience , some of whom said he seemed condescending when he lectured them on free-market capitalism and too glib when he said he understood their pain but urged them to buck_up . If nothing else , such reactions were a reminder that a politician inexperienced in foreign affairs -- as Clinton is -- can have perfect_pitch with U.S. audiences but get_off a clanger with groups whose special sensitivities he does not understand . Many Russians , for instance , feel deeply humiliated by their country ' s slide from superpower status into chaos ; lectures from Americans are salt in the wound . Similarly , addressing college_students in Brussels ' historic town_hall , Clinton was apparently disappointed in his listeners ' failure to respond more enthusiastically . But the progeny of Belgium ' s stolid burghers are not brought_up to cheer the_likes_of a President as though he were a rock_star . Clinton also avoided a pratfall in a joke comparing Kohl to a sumo wrestler only by including himself in the jest_at the last moment . And some Ukrainians took it badly when Clinton quipped that Kravchuk ' s firm handling of reporters during an appearance at Kiev ' s airport might qualify him for work as a White_House press aide . Nonetheless , even many of those scenes made strong images back home . There were pictures too of Clinton consorting with Havel , hero of democracy and culture , in the cabarets of Prague , and of Yeltsin in the Kremlin and babushkas on the slushy streets of Moscow . Aides were open about their hopes for the trip . &quot; Your domestic stock goes_up if you show yourself to be a good world leader , &quot; one said . But White_House officials acknowledged the difficulty Clinton faced in properly expressing his advice to East Europeans . He needed , one said , &quot; to express sympathy for what people were going_through , without sounding patronizing. &quot; Perhaps for this Administration , the tasks of foreign_policy are made easier by a conviction that concerns of the world abroad are still not quite as crucial for the President as those he faces at_home . &quot; The American people don ' t want a President who spends all his time on foreign_policy the way George_Bush did , &quot; one official said . &quot; They want a President who they can feel assured will perform well in a crisis , and not much more_than that. &quot;</TEXT>
