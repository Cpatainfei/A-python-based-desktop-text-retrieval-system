   <HEADLINE> TEXT OF ORDER APPOINTING STARR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This is the text of the order by a three-judge U.S. Court of Appeals panel naming Kenneth W . Starr as an independent counsel to take_over the Whitewater investigation : Upon consideration of the application of the attorney_general pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 592 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( A ) for the appointment of an independent counsel with authority to exercise all_the power , authority and obligations set_forth in 28 U.S.C. Section 594 , to investigate whether any individuals or entities have committed a violation of federal criminal_law , other_than a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction , relating in any way to James B . McDougal ' s , President William Jefferson Clinton ' s , or Mrs . Hillary Rodham Clinton ' s relationships with Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Assn. , Whitewater Development Corp. , or Capital Management Services Inc. ; it is : ORDERED by the court in accordance with the authority vested in it by 28 U.S.C. Section 593 ( b ) that Kenneth W . Starr , Esquire , of the District_of_Columbia bar , with offices at Kirkland and Ellis , 655-15th St. , NW , Washington , D.C. , 20005 , be and he is hereby appointed independent counsel with full power , independent authority , and jurisdiction to investigate to the maximum extent authorized by the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994 whether any individuals or entities have committed a violation of any federal criminal_law , other_than a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction , relating in any way to James B . McDougal ' s , President William Jefferson Clinton ' s , or Mrs . Hillary Rodham Clinton ' s relationships with Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan Assn. , Whitewater Development Corp. , or Capital Management Services Inc. The independent counsel shall have jurisdiction and authority to investigate other allegations or evidence or violation of any federal criminal_law , other_than a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction , by any person or entity developed during the independent counsel ' s investigation referred to above and connected with or arising out of that investigation . The independent counsel shall have jurisdiction and authority to investigate any violation of 28 U.S.C. Section 1826 , or any obstruction of the due administration of justice , or any material false testimony or statement in violation of federal criminal_law , in connection with any investigation of the_matters described above . The independent counsel shall have jurisdiction and authority to seek indictments and to prosecute any persons or entities involved in any of the_matters described above , who are reasonably believed to have committed a violation of any federal criminal_law arising out of such matters , including persons or entities who have engaged in an unlawful conspiracy or who have aided or abetted any federal offense . The independent counsel shall have all_the powers and authority provided by the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994 . It is : Further ordered by the court that the independent counsel , as authorized by 28 U.S.C. Section 594 , shall have prosecutorial jurisdiction to fully investigate and prosecute the subject_matter with_respect_to which the attorney_general requested the appointment of independent counsel , as hereinbefore set_forth , and all matters and individuals whose acts may be related to that subject_matter , inclusive of authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes ( other_than those classified as Class B or C misdemeanors or infractions ) that may arise out of the above described matter , including perjury , obstruction of justice , destruction of evidence , and intimidation of witnesses . The court , having reviewed the motion of the attorney_general that Robert B . Fiske Jr. , would be appointed as independent counsel , had determined that this would not be consistent with the purposes of the act . This reflects no conclusion on the part of the court that Fiske lacks either the accrual independence or any other attribute necessary to the conclusion of the investigation . Rather , the court reaches this conclusion because the act contemplates an apparent as well as an actual independence on the part of the counsel . As the Senate report accompanying the 1982 enactments reflected , &quot; The intent of the special prosecutor provisions is not to impugn the integrity of the attorney_general or the Department_of_Justice . Throughout our system of justice , safeguards exist against actual or perceived conflicts_of_interest without reflecting adversely on the parties who are subject_to conflicts. &quot; Just so here . It is not our intent to impugn the integrity of the attorney_general ' s appointee , but rather to reflect the intent of the act that the actor be protected against perceptions of conflicts . As Fiske was appointed by the incumbent Administration , the court therefore deems it in the best interest of the appearance of independence contemplated by the act that a person not affiliated with the incumbent Administration be appointed . It further appearing to the court in light of the attorney_general ' s motion heretofore made_for the authorization of the disclosure of her application for this appointment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 592 ( e ) and of the ongoing public proceedings and interest in this matter , that it is in the best interests of justice for the identity and prosecutorial jurisdiction of the independent counsel to be disclosed . It is so ordered .</TEXT>
