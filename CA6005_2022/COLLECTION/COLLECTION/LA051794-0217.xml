   <HEADLINE> IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE TOPS SIGNATURE GOAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With a strong push from the Republican_Party , supporters of a proposal to bar illegal immigrants in California from public hospitals and schools announced Monday that they had enough signatures to qualify the initiative for the November ballot . Sponsors of the sweeping &quot; Save Our State &quot; measure wheeled into election offices boxes stuffed with more_than 600 # 000 signatures -- more_than the 384 # 974 required to put the initiative before voters . The signatures will be checked and if the measure qualifies , it is certain to raise the intensity of an immigration debate that has become the subject of TV ads in the governor ' s race and mailers in legislative contests throughout the state . Immigrant rights advocates are scrambling to come_up with a strategy in response , including possibly airing TV ads promoting the positive side of immigration and highlighting what critics call the intolerant and xenophobic nature of the ballot measure . The initiative -- among the most stringent proposals put forth in the increasingly contentious immigration debate -- is sponsored by Alan Nelson , Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner under President Ronald Reagan , and Harold Ezell , INS chief for the western states from 1983-89 . If passed , the initiative would require schools to verify the immigration status of pupils and expel students whose parents cannot prove their legal_status . Schools also would be required to report to law_enforcement agencies the names of parents they believe are in the country illegally . It would eliminate prenatal care to women who have no papers . Illegal immigrants could receive emergency care , but hospital officials would be required to report &quot; persons who are apparent illegal aliens. &quot; Gov . Pete Wilson , who has made unlawful immigration a centerpiece of his reelection campaign , has said that illegal immigrants and their U.S.-born children absorb $ 3 billion in education , health_care , prison and welfare costs . Critics say the numbers ignore the economic activity and tax_revenue generated by illegal immigrants . But Wilson has not taken a position on the initiative , which has been endorsed by the state GOP . His campaign manager , George Gorton , said in a letter to initiative proponents that it is &quot; highly likely &quot; that the governor will campaign for the measure next fall should it make the ballot . A Times Poll in March found that 62 % of respondents favor the proposed initiative , including a majority of Democrats . The Democratic Party has not taken a position on the initiative . &quot; It appears to be a knee-jerk reaction to ' Yes , let ' s do something about this problem , ' &quot; said Arturo Vargas , vice_president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund . &quot; I don ' t think people yet have the benefit of an analysis of how onerous this kind of Big Brother initiative is. &quot; Vargas said the initiative could lead to widespread discrimination against legal immigrants and U.S. citizens of Latino descent . &quot; If you ' re brown , you ' re going to be suspect in this state. &quot; The initiative drive got_off to a slow start -- petitions have been in circulation since January -- but received a big boost from the state Republican_Party , which spent $ 75 # 000 to send_out petitions . State GOP Chairman Tirso del Junco , a Cuban immigrant , said he &quot; takes_care of a lot of illegal immigrants &quot; in his medical_practice , and &quot; they are taking jobs away from legal immigrants. &quot; Supporters of the initiative boasted of strong grass-roots support , but they hired a professional signature-gathering firm . The measure ' s educational restrictions seem to contradict a landmark 1982 Supreme Court decision ( Plyler vs . Doe ) , which held that public_schools must accept children regardless of immigration status . Initiative proponents acknowledge their desire to revisit that Supreme Court ruling , which passed 5 to 4 . Illegal immigrants do not qualify for welfare and many other public benefit programs but those who are indigent can receive free emergency and prenatal care at public hospitals .</TEXT>
