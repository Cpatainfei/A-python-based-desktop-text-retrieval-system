   <HEADLINE> MORNING BRIEFING : A BENCH_MARK PERFORMANCE ON GOLF_COURSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Johnny Bench , 46 , wants to play pro golf on the seniors tour when he turns 50 . Judging by the way he played_at the Baseball Hall_of_Fame Golf Classic last Sunday , he might be ready for the regular PGA tour . He shot a seven-under 65 with seven birdies and an eagle . It equaled the course tournament record at the 6 # 324-yard Leatherstocking Golf_Course . The course record is 62 . Bench won the round by eight strokes , with Rollie Fingers trailing with a 73 . Said playing partner and 1970s Cincinnati Red teammate Joe Morgan : &quot; I ' ve played a lot of golf with Johnny , but I ' ve never seen him put a round together like he did today. &quot; * Nobody ' s perfect : On the cover of the Dodgers ' 1994 media guide , Mike Piazza and Eric Karros are correctly identified , but on Page 4 , the caption refers to &quot; Mike &quot; Karros . * Trivia time : What was significant about the matchup of starting pitchers on Sept . 13 , 1936 , when Bob Feller of the Cleveland Indians met Randy Gumpert of the Philadelphia A ' s ? * Heisman flackery : Tim Tessalone , the USC sports information director who is pushing quarterback Rob Johnson for the Heisman Trophy this season , had Johnson ' s 1993 season run_through the NFL quarterback ratings computer_program . Result : The Trojan quarterback ' s rating , 108.9 , ties him for fourth with Dan Marino ' s 1984 season on the all-time top-five list , if his ' 93 season had been in the NFL . The top rating goes_to Joe Montana ' s 1989 season , 112.4 ; followed by Milt Plum in 1960 , 110.4 ; Sammy Baugh in 1945 , 109.9 , then Marino . The NFL ' s ratings_system is a complicated formula factoring in completion percentages , interceptions , touchdown passes per attempts and average gain per completion . * The whole story : The news service story from Sestriere , Italy , Sunday on Sergei Bubka ' s world-record pole_vault was a little incomplete . The story said Jackie Joyner-Kersee missed a long_jump world_record with a leap of 24 feet 7 inches . Maybe so , but she equaled her own American record . * Strike note : From Newsday ' s Marty Noble : &quot; Please , no more of this : ' The players ' salaries are pushing_up ticket prices. ' &quot; They have , of course . But if the players take 50 % cuts , do you think the owners will roll back the costs of tickets ? &quot; * Milestone : Walter Johnson made his major_league debut 87 years ago this week with the Washington Senators , losing , 3-2 , to the Detroit Tigers . He recovered . Johnson went_on to win 416 games . * Milestone II : Michael Jordan had his greatest day in professional_baseball Saturday in Birmingham , going two for four , including a home_run and two runs batted in . It increased his average to . 189 . * Trivia answer : According to Feller , it ' s the youngest matchup of starting pitchers in history . Both were 18 . * Quotebook : Ken Griffey Jr. , on his and Frank Thomas ' seasons possibly being wiped_out by a strike : &quot; We ' re just in a situation where we picked a bad year to have a good year . We picked a bad time to go_out and hit_home runs and get_on base and hit doubles. &quot; EARL GUSTKEY</TEXT>
