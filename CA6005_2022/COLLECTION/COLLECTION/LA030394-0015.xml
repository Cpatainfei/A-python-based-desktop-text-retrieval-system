   <HEADLINE> ALL EGGPLANT , ALL THE TIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Bulent Basol , president of the Assembly of Turkish American Associations , called to invite me to a Turkish meal of eggplant , I thought he was kidding . He sensed my hesitation . &quot; All eggplant , &quot; he said . Another pause . &quot; Really. &quot; Then Basol , whom I had met at yet another Turkish food function some years back , explained what he meant . &quot; Eggplant plays an important role in Turkish cuisine , &quot; he said . &quot; They say Turks have more_than 100 ways of preparing eggplant . We want to show you some of the ways . It will give you an idea of how versatile eggplant can be , while introducing a very healthful food that is not terribly well known. &quot; Aubergine , the_French word for eggplant used almost universally in the food world , is indeed a healthful and beautiful vegetable with a purple color so subtle and exquisite as_to inspire fashion_designers from season to season . It has a history so glamorous , and cuisine so appealing -- if you know how to use eggplant -- it does give one pause . Naturally , I accepted the invitation . Eggplant is actually the fruit of a plant that originated_in India and traveled East to Asia and West through the trade_routes of the Middle_East before making_it to France in the beginning of the 17th Century . In Asia , eggplant is an important and popular crop , with China leading in production , followed by Japan , where slim , elongated varieties are preferred . Locally , eggplant is popular , but through much of the United States , it is still considered a specialty item , with the bulk of the crop coming from Florida , Mexico and California . Today , many varieties , from the large bulbous fruit to the tiny egg-size white eggplant and the long , thin , small eggplant , are available almost year round . Overall production is growing steadily , but in small increments . For instance , it ' s a fraction of the production of squash in the United States . Eggplant will probably never become as popular in the U.S as it is in Asia or Turkey , but interest is growing . &quot; As people understand that eating fresh fruits and vegetables promotes good_health and fights cancer and heart_disease , &quot; says Barbara Buck , chief_executive_officer of the Fresh Produce Council of California , &quot; they will be looking_for more ways to use exotic vegetables such_as eggplant. &quot; Nutritionally , eggplant is extremely low in fat and calories ( about 20 calories per 100-gram serving ) , and contains some protein , vitamins ( A and B ) and minerals ( calcium and iron ) . Because of its meaty pulp , eggplant has long been used in main dishes , such_as casseroles ( moussaka , for instance ) , stews and vegetarian meals . It is said that when Empress Eugenie , wife of Napoleon III , was in Istanbul as guest of Sultan Abdulaziz , the Ottoman emperor , she became intrigued with a puree of eggplant that had been the specialty of the Topkapi Palace , home of sultans and harems for several centuries . She asked her host if he would allow his chef to teach her cook how to prepare it , and the sultan obliged . But the_French chef was given no measurements and asked to be relieved from the duty of making a dish that was cooked by &quot; eye and nose. &quot; The empress returned to France without the recipe . Back at the palace , however , the dish was renamed in her honor . To this day , eggplant puree , a dish served as an accompaniment to stews and roast chicken , is called hunkar begendi , meaning &quot; the sultan approved it. &quot; No cuisine makes more glamorous use of eggplant than the Turkish . In the hands of Turkish cooks , eggplant takes_on numerous guises , whether stuffed with rice and meat , laced with sauces , or combined with other vegetables in perfect flavor integration . So I sat with Dr. Oguz Celikkol , the consul general of Turkey in Los Angeles , and Basol and his wife , Sema , sampling a parade of eggplant dishes from appetizer to salad . &quot; You realize , of course , that in Turkey , as elsewhere in the world , the most famous cooks have traditionally been men , &quot; said the consul with a teasing smile . But the consular household has a woman chef who prepared the dishes and emerged only long enough to set a plate on the table and serve the last beverage of the meal -- a thick brew of Turkish_coffee . According to Sema Basol , who helped translate the cook ' s tips , frying the eggplant , even when it us used as a stew , helps impart extra flavor often lacking in boiled or baked eggplant . &quot; Olive_oil , particularly , gives eggplant a delicious flavor , &quot; said Basol . Another important tip : Soak eggplant halves or slices in salted water for 30 minutes to leach out bitter flavors before frying . &quot; Most people object to the rather bitter taste of eggplant if not properly leached , &quot; she said . Freezing eggplant , while possible , is not recommended , according to Basol . &quot; Turkish cooking doesn ' t lend itself to freezing or prolonged refrigeration . We like our foods to be eaten freshly cooked . Standing_in the freezer or the refrigerator will cause flavors and texture to deteriorate. &quot; One of the first dishes to arrive was an appetizer known as patlican salatasi ( eggplant salad ) , which requires mashing of the eggplant pulp . Pureeing is easily achieved by baking the large eggplant in the oven to soften the flesh . The eggplant is peeled and flesh mashed as you would potatoes . Small eggplant , such_as the elongated , slim eggplant or small novelty egg-size eggplant , can be scorched over flame until soft enough to mash . Eggplant puree , which becomes a beautiful cream-white color when mashed , can be dressed as you would any salad with lemon_juice or vinegar and oil . The puree can also be combined with cheese and cream to serve plain ( begendi ) or baked as for a gratin ( also called gratin in Turkey ) . Patlicanli kebab is not what we usually think_of as kebab , but eggplant made into a stew with pieces of lamb and eggplant . ( Of course , eggplant can be made into kebab -- cut_into large cubes , threaded on skewers and cooked on the barbecue grill. ) For a stew , eggplant is added_to the meat and cooked until the meat and vegetable juices mingle . The dish is usually served over plain or tomato-flavored rice . Moussaka , another famous dish found throughout the regions around Turkey and Greece , is simply a casserole layered , lasagne-fashion , using ground meat and slices of eggplant in lieu of pasta . The eggplant slices are_best fried for extra flavor before being added_to the casserole . Moussaka is a popular main dish / buffet dish that ' s also budget-conscious . Because of its shape , eggplant lends itself easily to stuffing with rice and ground meat , or with vegetables for a vegetarian meal . Its meaty pulp makes a perfect boat or cavity for a filling meal . The consul ' s table included eggplant stuffed with rice and meat , called zeytinyagli patlican dolmasi , as well as tiny patties of eggplant fried in olive_oil .
