   <HEADLINE> WESTSIDE / COVER STORY ; BUTTERFLY SAFETY NET ; EXPIRATION OF A $ 430 # 000 GRANT WORRIES VOLUNTEERS WORKING TO RESTORE THE DUNES NEAR LAX WHERE THE EL SEGUNDO BLUE FLOURISHES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They stride across the dunes like foot_soldiers in some ecological army , sporting T-shirts emblazoned with a single blue butterfly . Some stoop_to do battle with the alien ice_plant and brushy acacia trees that threaten the El Segundo dunes . Others kneel in the sand to plant native shrubs that vanished from this seaside kingdom long before many members of this volunteer gardening army were born . What has brought these volunteers here , weekend after weekend , is a heartfelt vision that time can be rolled back and the dunes restored . Their mission is to rebuild an ecosystem that vanished a generation ago as urban Los Angeles pressed toward the sea . They operate by a simple but delicate equation : banishing the ice_plant and other non-native species while nurturing coast buckwheat , the El Segundo blue butterfly that feeds_on it and a myriad of other plants and insects that once called the dunes home . The group ' s icon is the El Segundo blue , a federal endangered species whose primary home is this fragile snippet of dune-scape wedged between sprawling Los Angeles International Airport and the sea . Today , the ice_plant is nearly vanquished . The butterfly is flourishing , up from 400 10 years ago to more_than 10 # 000 today . But on this misty October morning , what should have been a celebratory event -- a salute to a job nearly finished -- takes_on a somber cast . Triggering concern is the Oct . 7 end of the $ 430 # 000 grant that financed restoration work under the direction of Rudi Mattoni of Beverly Hills , who has received national attention for his fight to save the El Segundo blue . Now , no one knows for_sure how the dunes will be protected in years to come . &quot; Who looks_after these plants that we ' ve just planted ? &quot; asks a frustrated Mattoni . The El Segundo dunes is at a crossroads . When the grant expired last week , responsibility for the area moved from the city Department of Environmental Affairs to the city Department of Airports , which owns the dunes . The juxtaposition is a curious one : LAX , the nation ' s third-busiest airport , high-tech launching_pad for hundreds of jumbo jets each .day , is charged with protecting the habitat of a fluttering thumbnail-size butterfly . Although an airport official promises to &quot; do the right thing by the dunes , &quot; some environmentalists are nervous that a mammoth agency accustomed to dealing with high-powered airlines and fast-flying machines may_not fully grasp the importance of buckwheat and insects . After Mattoni began studying the dunes for the Department of Airports in 1984 , he discovered that it contained 28 plants and animals that are native to the Southern California dunes system . But years of development and soil contamination helped foster non-native species , he reported , threatening the survival of native wildlife . As departing jets screech overhead on this overcast Sunday , Mattoni and his supporters issue a rallying cry to about 60 people gathered at the dunes for the last scheduled volunteer cleanup-and-planting effort . &quot; The work is not done , &quot; said Jon Earl , director of Rhapsody in Green , a Los Angeles environmental group that has championed the dunes . As the volunteers weed and plant , Mattoni , 66 , stands slightly apart , ear protectors cupped around his neck , observing the activity with deep blue eyes that nearly match the blue of the butterfly imprinted on his T-shirt . In a playful moment , he disappears under a tattered , turquoise-colored tarp until his head re-emerges through a hole in the center . Then , as giggling teen-agers watch , he slowly flaps his tarp-covered arms . &quot; Sweet butterfly . . . &quot; he sings under his breath . * Mattoni ' s life has been intrinsically tied to blue butterflies -- the El Segundo blue he has helped preserve at the dunes , the Palos Verdes blue butterfly he rediscovered in San Pedro this spring . Yet the butterfly is simply a metaphor , he says , of the complex native ecosystem that is slowly taking_root again . Mattoni , a UCLA visiting lecturer in geography and environmental_science , talks passionately of the dunes ' other crown_jewels , the 11 species of plants and animals that can be found only on this narrow strip of sand : the El Segundo goat moth , the El Segundo Jerusalem_cricket , the Lange ' s dunes weevil , the El Segundo spineflower , the El Segundo crab spider . He sounds astonished that others might not notice the mysteries to be found here . It is baffling to him that Angelenos can be obsessed with saving the Amazon rain_forest -- even reporting the acres lost on a lighted digital monitor outside the Beverly Center ' s Hard Rock Cafe -- while they ignore the home-grown wonders just west of LAX . Mattoni found his first blue butterfly 50 years ago mounted in a cardboard box at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural_History . At the time , he was a schoolboy fascinated by butterflies , collecting them , puzzling over the colors of caterpillars that clung_to the bush outside his bedroom window in Beverly Hills . Then , as a teen-ager during World_War_II , he visited the dunes for the first time and witnessed the butterfly alive . The airport was tiny then , and only a_few houses perched on the dunes . He remembers flocks of butterflies and huge expanses of coastal buckwheat . He left Los Angeles to study entomology at UC Berkeley , returning to earn his Ph.D. at UCLA in population genetics . His resume portrays him as a Renaissance_man of science , assessing the effects of the first atomic_explosion on native insect populations in New Mexico , conducting studies on astronauts ' personal hygiene in space . A company he founded produced millions of cotton pink_bollworm moths -- so named because of their bright pink larvae -- that were sterilized with radiation and used to control the bollworm attacking the San Joaquin Valley cotton crop . Although he is not a professional entomologist , he kept returning to butterflies -- especially blue butterflies . And in 1984 , he returned to the dunes , charged with studying how blue butterflies and other native insects remained . The dunes had changed dramatically since he last saw them . Much of the dunes ' coastal buckwheat was probably destroyed when homes were built . Ice_plant , which was popular among developers who used it to stabilize sand , can squeeze_out the remaining buckwheat and other native species . &quot; The ice_plant was all_over the place . It was ghastly , &quot; he recalls . To worsen matters , after constructing Pershing Drive on the dunes ' east_side in the 1970s , the city had planted the wrong kind of buckwheat , Mattoni said . Instead of coast buckwheat -- the sole food of the El Segundo butterfly -- workers had planted common buckwheat , throwing the ecosystem out of sync . One of the most startling changes of all was not on the dunes , but above them . As_many as 900 to 1 # 000 low-flying jets roar above the butterflies each day . * Ironically , it was the burgeoning growth of LAX that created the dunes preserve and thus enhanced the El Segundo blue ' s hopes for survival . Once houses and streets covered the very dunes the butterfly inhabits . But the rise in jet traffic in the early 1960s forced the removal of almost 800 homes under the noisy takeoff routes , baring the dunes again . Today , the preserve exudes an eerie sense of in-between . Remnants of the old neighborhood remain , like ruins of some Roman village . Cracked concrete streets run like frayed ribbon through the dunes , weeds sprouting through the cracks . Street numbers are barely visible on decaying curbs . A peeling yellow fire_hydrant sits next to one dune , and brick steps lead nowhere . Yet most of the area has returned to wilderness , a soothing tapestry of brown-gray shrubs against tan sand . Then , a dune away , LAX comes_into view , its terminals and control_towers spread across the horizon like a space_age metropolis . This juxtaposition of sand and city , nature and technology endows the restore-the-dunes project with much of its drama . The 300-acre area is the last large remnant of a series of dunes systems that once ran from Point Conception north of Santa Barbara to Mexico . Airport officials had long planned to use about 200 acres of the cleared dunes to build a seaside golf_course , with the remaining 100 acres set_aside as a preserve . But then the California Coastal Commission questioned how the development would affect the El Segundo blue butterfly . City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter helped spearhead a 1990 city agreement under which 200 acres were designated a preserve , with 100 acres to the north set_aside for the golf_course . Activity shifted to restoring the dunes , although airport officials say that a golf_course is still possible . Mattoni and his colleagues have been working to restore the dunes , most recently with the $ 430 # 000 grant from the state Resources Agency and a $ 75 # 000 grant from the Coastal Conservancy . The work was overseen by the city Department of Environmental Affairs . The project has spawned a small but intensely loyal band of defenders . Hundreds of volunteers , including UCLA professors and Westside schoolchildren , regularly visit with trowels and gardening gloves . Now , as the Department of Airports shoulders responsibility for the dunes , trepidation is apparent among some dunes defenders . &quot; I want to assure those people that we ' re not going_to turn our backs on the work they ' ve done , &quot; Phil Depoian , Department of Airports deputy executive_director , promised last week . But Mattoni says the airport has promised only that he can volunteer at the dunes for an additional 30 days . He has no idea if he will be allowed on the site after that time , he said . Galanter has written airport officials to urge them to plan for long-term maintenance . She said last week that she is &quot; reasonably optimistic &quot; that the airport can be persuaded to arrange for that maintenance , which she estimates would cost about $ 45 # 000 annually . Some environmental groups have banded_together to form the Coastal Dunes Conservancy , hoping to provide management and scientific expertise for preserving the dunes , said Fred Heath , president of the Los Angeles Audubon Society . At the Department of Airports , Depoian said last week that he does not know enough about the conservancy plan to say if it is feasible . Meanwhile , environmentalists hope the airport will continue to allow the hands-on volunteer work that they say has been key to the restoration ' s success . &quot; It surprises me that I feel this way about this pile of sand , &quot; Heath said . &quot; There ' s something very different about pulling_out weeds and planting plants , a rush that I ' ve never gotten from saving a piece_of_land by political means. &quot; * As the dunes restoration project wound down Friday , Mattoni stacked nursery pots from the El Segundo project into his faded Volvo station_wagon and drove them across the South Bay to a little-known military fuel depot in San Pedro . Here , during a routine biological survey in March , Mattoni and fellow researchers found the Palos Verdes blue butterfly , believed to have been extinct for a decade . The area had never before been surveyed for butterflies . Like its distant El Segundo cousin , the Palos Verdes blue is classified as an endangered species , and only about 200 were estimated to be living last spring at the U.S. Navy ' s Defense Fuel Supply Point near Western Avenue . But if Mattoni has his way , those numbers will grow . He hopes to restore the area much as he has the LAX dunes , re-vegetating it with native plants such_as the locoweed upon which the Palos Verdes blue feeds . The politics of a fuel-depot restoration may prove simpler than the dunes project . The land is owned by the U.S. Navy , which Mattoni says has supported his efforts so far . The depot is a park-like area , with 26 tanks below ground and only three aboveground , posing little interference for the butterfly . The Palos Verdes blue is a relatively unknown butterfly compared with the El Segundo blue . It apparently vanished from the Palos Verdes Peninsula in the early 1980s , after most of its breeding sites were destroyed by housing_development , fire_control and the expansion of a city park . Mattoni ' s natural ebullience surfaces as he talks_of planting locoweed for the butterfly to feed_on . He begins ticking_off the other key native plants for the fuel-depot ecosystem : California_sagebrush , black_sage , bush sunflower . &quot; It ' s just like the dunes , &quot; he explained . &quot; By doing what you can do to save the butterfly , you ' re going to augment the whole community , and therefore everything will benefit . . . . &quot; we ' ll go from one rebirth to another. &quot;</TEXT>
