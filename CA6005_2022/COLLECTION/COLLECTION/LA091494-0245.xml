   <HEADLINE> RWANDAN GOVERNMENT OUTRAGED OVER SLUGGISH PACE OF INQUIRY INTO GENOCIDE ; AFRICA : OFFICIAL SAYS DELAYS IN BRINGING PERPETRATORS TO JUSTICE WILL PUSH THOSE WHO LOST LOVED ONES TO SEEK REVENGE . U.N. DENIES THE PROBE IS BEING ' SABOTAGED. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The government lashed_out Tuesday at the United Nations for not doing more to investigate Rwanda ' s genocidal massacres and identify the perpetrators , saying such inaction could turn frustrated Rwandans into vigilantes bent_on seeking revenge themselves . &quot; The United Nations is sending commission after commission to investigate a genocide that took_place before the cameras of the world , &quot; complained Maj . Wilson Rutayisire , a government spokesman . An estimated half a_million people , and perhaps many_more , were slain in Rwanda in April and May as the former government of hard-line Hutus organized pogroms of its political opponents and the Tutsi ethnic minority . Rwanda ' s current Rwandan Patriotic Front leadership , which took_control in July after a rapid and savage civil_war with the old government , has called_for the trial of at least 30 # 000 people it says are implicated in the massacres . Rutayisire said failure to put them on_trial quickly will undermine support for the new leaders . &quot; If the people are not tried , the people ( Rwandans ) will not see the international community , &quot; he said . &quot; They will see ( only ) the government here. &quot; Lately , foreign_aid organizations and the International Committee of the Red_Cross have reported increased arrests by soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front army and disappearances by the hundreds . Rutayisire accused the foreign press of being hypersensitive to such accusations and asserted that any abuses by the front ' s soldiers are investigated and punishment meted_out to those responsible . In the southern city of Butare , he said , a soldier was shot in front of his unit for murdering a civilian . In Gitarama , he said , a major and four soldiers were placed under arrest for atrocities . &quot; The international community fails to realize the connection with any incident that occurs today with the failure to try those responsible_for genocide , &quot; he added , explaining why delays in trying the killers would push Rwandans who lost loved ones in the spring to seek vengeance themselves . The comments by the spokesman showed to what degree the government has become exasperated by the snail-like pace of U.N. efforts to formally rule on whether genocide took_place , as a preliminary step toward the possible convocation of an international tribunal . In July , a U.N. special envoy concluded that &quot; planned and systematic &quot; killing occurred in Rwanda . &quot; Justice delayed is justice denied , &quot; Rutayisire said . &quot; If we can try them now , why should we wait ? &quot; He voiced the possibility that his government might organize its own prosecutions , but he then backed_away , saying , &quot; Maybe we will have to wait as long as it takes &quot; so Western countries , whose aid Rwanda now badly needs , do not conclude that today ' s leaders are bent_on avenging the bloodshed earlier this year . At a separate press briefing , Pierre Mehu , a spokesman for the U.N. Assistance Mission in Rwanda , flatly denied a comment by Rutayisire that somebody seemed to be &quot; sabotaging the U.N. probe. &quot; &quot; Of course we understand the impatience of the government , but there are steps we have to follow , &quot; Mehu said . &quot; You just cannot take people and put them in front of a tribunal . . . . There are rules that have to be followed. &quot; Three jurists from French-speaking West Africa have been charged by the U.N. Security_Council with reporting on whether , in terms of international_law , what took_place in Rwanda was genocide . They have promised to make a report by the end of this month . The United States and other members of the U.N. Security_Council will then decide what action , if any , to take . Only the council is empowered to create an international court . Rwandan authorities are frustrated because the U.N. high_commissioner for human_rights has had an office in Kigali for the past three months , without achieving many apparent results . In fact , U.N. sources say , the four employees responsible_for carrying_out the legwork and interviews on the genocide issue have been exasperated at what they see as lack of backing elsewhere in the United Nations ' bureaucracy , plus their inability to obtain cars , computers and other resources to gather testimony and other data . Last week , the office ' s director , Irish human_rights lawyer Karen Kenny , allowed her contract to lapse . In a press_release , the Geneva-based U.N. Human_Rights Commission strongly denied she had resigned , saying she had been the head of the &quot; first_team &quot; investigating the blood bath and that she was leaving because her contract was_due to lapse Sept . 16 . William Clarence , a British lawyer and retired U.N. civil_servant who last served as the representative of the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees in the former Soviet_Union , arrived last weekend to assume the post of chief of the United Nations ' human_rights operation in Rwanda . He said he expected his staff of three human_rights monitors to swell soon to 26 short-term contract employees . In 12 days , Clarence said , his office should forward its findings to the three African jurists who in turn will report to the Security_Council . &quot; It ' s tremendously important for the world community to condemn genocide , &quot; Clarence said . &quot; Perhaps the procedures have been slow , but there ' s total determination to bring people to justice within the U.N. system. &quot;</TEXT>
