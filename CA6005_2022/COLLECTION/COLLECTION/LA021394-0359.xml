   <TEXT> She was the Michael Jordan of her sport . Donna Weinbrecht dominated freestyle moguls skiing almost to_the_point of tedium . There was no reason for her to try breaking new ground in a training run_on Nov . 17 , 1992 , at Breckenridge , Colo . Weinbrecht could have bowed_out a champion , on her terms . You know , go_to the Bahamas , lie_low for a month , get restless , then try_out for the Chicago White Sox . In fact , Weinbrecht had considered , at 27 , walking away from it all with her cache of 25 World Cup victories , three overall titles , one world championship , five United States titles and the first sanctioned Olympic gold medal for women ' s moguls , at the 1992 Albertville Games . Not even Weinbrecht was sure what she was doing that day at Breckenridge , trying something so daffy as a daffy twister , an aerial maneuver . &quot; I was having a hard_time mentally , after winning the ( Olympic ) gold , &quot; Weinbrecht acknowledges . &quot; When I first started the freestyle thing , I thought I would have retired in 1992 , and here I was_on the slopes again . I was with a lack of focus and desire . I knew I wanted to ski , but yet I couldn ' t rekindle those kinds of feelings. &quot; Weinbrecht proceeded with the daffy , but the only thing that twisted was her right knee . As her coach , Jeff Good , rushed to her side , Weinbrecht lay_in agony on the_hill . &quot; I kept looking_up at the sky and saying , ' Oh God ! Oh God ! Did I blow_out my knee ? ' &quot; she remembers . She blew it out . Anterior cruciate ligament . Three words skiers -- and all athletes -- hate to hear . They took Weinbrecht to the famed skier ' s surgeon , Richard Steadman in Vail , where it was hoped her knee could be reconstructed well enough for her to climb stairs . What a way to go_out , some said . What a reason to come_back , Weinbrecht said . The injury , oddly , put her at_peace . Her soul searching was over . She had found her motivation . &quot; I guess the injury gave me a focus to come_back , &quot; she says now . &quot; It gave me a second chance. &quot; Weinbrecht missed the 1992-93 World Cup season . It might have been a lonely time for rehabilitation and introspection but for a CBS television crew that became an appendage . The TV guys were making an Olympic documentary . The camera crew introduced itself to Weinbrecht in the operating room , then announced it would be staying for the winter . With so_much tape in the can , Weinbrecht figured she had to come_back . Weinbrecht proved in her season away she was also the champion of rehab . &quot; She took the path of most resistance , not least_resistance , &quot; said Good . &quot; It would have been much easier to bail , mentally and physically. &quot; Weinbrecht would n ' t know for_sure about the comeback until more_than a year after her injury , Dec . 11 , 1993 , as she stood at the start of her first World Cup competition at Tignes , France . It was at Tignes in 1992 that Weinbrecht had claimed the Olympic gold with 20 # 000 partisans rooting against her . &quot; I couldn ' t even relate to it , &quot; she recalls of the Olympic crowd . &quot; It was like a concert , and you ' re on stage . It was too hard to fathom that all those people were looking_at you and screaming. &quot; Tignes was different this time . Weinbrecht ' s right knee was now encased in a high-tech carbon-titanium brace . She felt no pain , but the hinges of the brace that brushed against her left leg served as a constant reminder . She was nervous , but told herself , &quot; Donna , you took this challenge . You didn ' t feel fulfilled and ready to retire yet , so you got_to take the ups and downs. &quot; So_much for the downs . Weinbrecht won the competition . As in figure_skating , freestyle skiing is a judged event , with skiers graded on technical and artistic merit . Perhaps Weinbrecht ' s being the sentimental favorite swayed the judges that day in Tignes . But Weinbrecht didn ' t stop there . Remarkably , she won the first six World Cup moguls events and is the prohibitive favorite to successfully defend her Olympic gold when moguls competition begins here Tuesday . Even Good , a self-described eternal optimist , could not have predicted Weinbrecht ' s return . &quot; She is , without question , the most unique individual that ' s ever been in freestyle , &quot; Good says . &quot; The thing she does best is compete . I think if you did physical testing , probably athletes on other teams , and on our team , are more fit than she is . But there is no way of measuring who is competitive on contest day . And no one ' s ever been more consistent than she is. &quot; Steadman , the surgeon , is as surprised as anyone . &quot; It was good_enough for skiing , &quot; Steadman said of his repair work . &quot; But to come_back the next year and be the best in the world ? &quot; The question is , who is going_to stop Weinbrecht . Freestyle is the one Olympic skiing discipline the United States has dominated . While the rest of the world is catching_up , Weinbrecht ' s toughest international threat here figures to be Stine Lise Hattestad , who won the World Cup moguls title last season in Weinbrecht ' s absence . Hattestad , a Norwegian , will have the home-slope advantage here . Weinbrecht also figures to be challenged by teammates Liz McIntyre and Ann Battelle . But she envisions an even tougher opponent . &quot; Myself , &quot; Weinbrecht says . &quot; Dealing with myself. &quot; What makes Weinbrecht ' s career more impressive is that she got a relatively late start in competitive skiing . She grew_up in West Milford , N.J. , where she began skiing when she was 7 . Her racing career blossomed in high_school , after her father had built a second home_in Killington , Vt . Weinbrecht initially raced Alpine , but was soon drawn to the artistry and freedom that come_with moguls . After high_school , she attended art_school for a year before moving to Killington , where she waited tables at a pizza pub and tried to convince her parents that she was training diligently for the U.S. freestyle team . &quot; My mom said , ' Yeah , right , ' &quot; Weinbrecht recalls . Weinbrecht ' s rise was swift . She placed 15th at nationals in 1986 , fourth in 1987 , was named the World Cup rookie of the year in 1988 and has been virtually unstoppable since . She says the decision to stagger the Summer and Winter_Olympics greatly influenced her comeback decision . &quot; I get a second chance , and I ' m going_to seize that chance , &quot; she said . &quot; I was so affected by ' 92 and the Olympic spirit . It ' s definitely colored my life in remarkable ways . It ' s filled every dream I thought_of the Olympics being . To take_part , and be a returning gold medalist , it ' s very exciting. &quot;</TEXT>
