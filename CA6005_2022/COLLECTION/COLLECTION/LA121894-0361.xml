   <HEADLINE> REFERENDUM MAY KILL OTHER NORTHRIDGE PROGRAMS ; BUDGET : ATHLETIC DIRECTOR SAYS THAT WITHOUT A FEE HIKE , THE UNIVERSITY WILL FIELD JUST 14 PROGRAMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Football , women ' s basketball , men ' s soccer and men ' s swimming are among the Cal State Northridge programs that could be terminated if a key student fee referendum in March fails , Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said Saturday . Hiegert said that if the measure fails , Northridge would field only 14 programs , the minimum number necessary to remain at the NCAA Division I level . Northridge now fields 18 teams . &quot; If we don ' t have enough money to operate , then we have to make tough decisions , &quot; Hiegert said . In short , Northridge ' s third attempt in a year to pass an athletic referendum could mean life or death for four Northridge programs . When the Associated Students election is held March 8-9 , the potential price_tag for students may_not be as high . In October , students were asked to pay $ 49 per semester for athletics and the measure was narrowly defeated in the largest election turnout in school history . A similar proposal was defeated last spring . Yet Northridge President Blenda J . Wilson told athletics administrators and coaches on Friday that she hopes to maintain the current level of funding from the University Corporation , formerly called the Foundation . If Wilson delivers the Corporation funding -- which amounts to $ 225 # 000 for 1994-95 -- the referendum ' s financial impact on students will be lessened . At least three referendum packages are being considered . The referendum options will contain different dollar figures and athletic configurations . The choices : * With a semester fee increase of $ 26 per student , no programs would be eliminated and the level of funding across the board would increase . * With a hike of $ 19 a semester , football would be dropped and other sports would receive a slight funding increase . * At $ 15 , football would be dropped and other teams would remain at status_quo in terms of funding levels . * Other programs would be lost if no increase is approved . Wilson is expected to release to the public this week a list of funding options for the department , which faces a deficit of $ 700 # 000 next year . The formal list of referendum selections under_consideration may be included in the announcement , Hiegert said . After soliciting public_opinion , Wilson is scheduled to announce in mid-January which referendum package will be placed on the ballot , Hiegert said . Hiegert added that the &quot; indication so far &quot; from Wilson is that there will be no more referendum attempts if the March measure fails .</TEXT>
