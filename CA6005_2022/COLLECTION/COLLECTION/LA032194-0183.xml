   <TEXT> Swiss Ease Flow of Bank Information : Switzerland ' s Parliament passed a law that tightens bank regulations and eases the international flow of information among bank regulators.The law , modeled on European Union directives , allows Swiss bank regulators to pass_on information about a bank or , in some cases , a bank client , to foreign regulators and criminal investigators . This will allow bank officials to work around Switzerland ' s bank secrecy laws , which forbid the release of client information unless police or a court_order it . If the information involves a bank client , the client must be informed and can try to stop the release by taking the case to court .</TEXT>
