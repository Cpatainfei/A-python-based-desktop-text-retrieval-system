   <HEADLINE> THE BERGMAN TOUCH , FROM FATHER TO SON ; MOVIES : ' SUNDAY ' S CHILDREN ' EXPLORES A BOY ' S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER , A RELATIONSHIP DEEPLY ROOTED IN REALITY : INGMAR WROTE IT , SON DANIEL DIRECTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Their relationship essentially began with that briefest of pleasures , the Swedish summer . Summers were the time Ingmar Bergman and his son Daniel would renew their relationship , which had ruptured when Daniel was 3 and his distinguished director father had moved_on to other familial pastures . From the age of 8 on , Daniel summered with his father . So it was fitting that it should have been summer when , nearly 20 years later , they decided to make their first film together . That film , &quot; Sunday ' s Children , &quot; directed by Daniel and written by Ingmar about his painful relationship with his own father , is also about a summer day . The centerpiece of the film , which opens in Los Angeles Friday , is a bicycle trip young Ingmar took with his father in 1926 , but the film also examines his parents ' volatile marriage and the mythologies of youth . &quot; It was five years ago one summer that both my father and I were working_on different projects , &quot; the younger Bergman said by phone from his island home_in Stockholm . &quot; We were working in different parts of ( Ingmar ' s ) house on Faro , and we had lunch together every day . We talked a lot about different projects , and we were both a little bored with what we were doing . &quot; And he had the idea that there might be a film in the ( 1987 autobiography ) he wrote , ' The Magic Lantern. ' I suggested that the bicycle story might be a film , and he asked if I would be interested in directing if he made a script . I think within one hour , we decided to do_it . The summer after , he wrote the script . The summer after that , I directed it. &quot; The critically acclaimed film , which has been circling the globe and playing the festival circuit for two years , explores the origins of Ingmar ' s difficult relationship with his remote , sometimes raging pastor father . But &quot; Sunday ' s Children &quot; also views those complexities with compassion . The father ' s love stitches the film together as it shuttles between Ingmar ' s childhood and middle_age . * Indeed , Ingmar blessed his son with a masterful screenplay to brace Daniel ' s first full-length feature , made with a modest budget of $ 3 million . ( Ingmar , 75 , retired from directing 10 years ago. ) &quot; It ' s a loving gesture , &quot; said Daniel , 31 . &quot; He writes_about his father and he gives it to his son to direct , and I give it back to him as a final film. &quot; Daniel accepted the baton with conditions : Ingmar was not to step foot on the set , and when they did talk during filming , it was over the phone . &quot; You can ' t have two directors on the same set , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s really dangerous , especially when we ' re so emotionally involved in the story . It would confuse the actors . It would confuse me . It would confuse everything. &quot; Still , &quot; Sunday ' s Children &quot; has all_the richness and delicacy you would expect of the elder Bergman ' s films . Critics consider it the continuation of a trilogy that includes &quot; Fanny and Alexander &quot; ( 1982 ) and &quot; The Best Intentions &quot; ( 1992 ) -- both films written by Bergman that also dissected his family ' s intricate relationships . &quot; Sunday ' s Children &quot; has won prizes at film festivals in Montreal , Puerto Rico and Giffoni , Italy . Daniel says he realizes that comparisons with his father ' s work are inevitable but he ' s nonetheless leery of them . Although he ultimately decided to collaborate with Ingmar , he avoided both directing and the consequent comparisons for his first 10 years in the business , working instead as a grip and film technician . Now he says he has come_to terms with his artistic inheritance . &quot; I don ' t think I can avoid being Ingmar ' s son , and that ' s not something to avoid . Why should I avoid it ? This is a story I wanted to do , and it ' s something I know about . It ' s about my own family . It ' s about my own flesh and blood . It ' s about things I have experienced . It was written by one of the world ' s best scriptwriters , who is my father , and that shouldn ' t make me avoid doing it. &quot; Daniel , the first of Bergman ' s nine children to make a film , is reluctant to discuss the dynamics of his relationship with his father . But he does say making &quot; Sunday ' s Children &quot; enhanced their bond . &quot; We became closer to each other , &quot; he said . &quot; I understood a lot about him , and he , maybe seeing how I interpreted his script , understood how I feel about those things and how I am as a person. &quot; Such insights were not always so accessible . Daniel ' s mother was the esteemed Estonian concert pianist Kabi Laretei , whose career demanded constant travel , prodding her son into precocious independence . By the time Daniel was 3 and his parents had divorced , Bergman was involved with actress Liv Ullmann . Even before Ingmar ' s return into his life , 5-year-old Daniel became a captive of the local cinema . In a real-life scenario reminiscent_of &quot; Cinema Paradiso , &quot; he bonded with and learned from the older_man who ran it . Daniel began working as a projectionist in a Stockholm cinema at 12 , and in 1987 , he made a television documentary about his mentor , &quot; Nypan. &quot; &quot; He was almost like a father to me . And also there was a key grip who I worked with as a trainee and who became a close friend . I really had different fathers in my life , one can say. &quot; Daniel continued his self-education when he began spending summers with Ingmar , studying his 200-film collection of such 16-mm classics as Fritz Lang ' s &quot; Metropolis &quot; and Francois Truffaut ' s &quot; The 400 Blows. &quot; But conventional education bored him . He dropped_out of school at 14 and moved swiftly from projectionist to film crew . In that capacity , he worked_on his father ' s films &quot; The Magic Flute , &quot; &quot; Fanny and Alexander &quot; and &quot; Autumn Sonata. &quot; In 1986 , Daniel moved_into directing short films and television . His first film , &quot; Perception , &quot; about a woman who represses the memory of a rape and is later haunted by it , was entered in the Berlin Film Festival . He ' s now making commercials , sifting through Hollywood screenplays , and working_on his own script based on an Icelandic novel that he ' s loath to talk_about . &quot; It ' s really too vulnerable , still. &quot; When Daniel settles_on his next project , though , it will likely recast the meaning of the words a Bergman film . &quot; I have never found any major influence , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ve grown_up with so many films , and I ' ve lived my life , which has been quite dramatic . And I ' m influenced by my father and my mother and by everybody , and by my ex-girlfriends . One gets so influenced by everything. &quot;</TEXT>
