   <HEADLINE> THIS ONE IS NOT A SURPRISE ; BASKETBALL : ITALY DEFEATS UNITED STATES , 81-72 , PROVING YET AGAIN THE WORLD IS CATCHING_UP TO AMERICANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Italy ' s first victory over the United States in international basketball since 1978 did not provoke a wild celebration at midcourt . None of the Italians even rocked the baby , as their point guard -- the cool Claudio Coldebella -- did when victory was assured in an earlier game against Brazil . No , they expected to defeat the United States on Wednesday at the Sport and Concert Complex in the semifinals of the Goodwill Games . Although the ease with which they accomplished that , 81-72 , might have been a surprise , their bright , young coach , Ettore Messina , convinced them beforehand that a close loss would still be a loss . &quot; You have to believe you can win , &quot; he said . So they did , scoring the first seven points of the second_half to turn a one-point halftime deficit into a six-point lead that the United States never overcame . But there was another reason for the Italians ' reserve after advancing to today ' s final against Puerto Rico : &quot; We know it ' s not the Dream Team we beat , &quot; Coldebella said . Coldebella knows it as well as anyone in Italy . In the athletic apparel store he owns in Bologna , where he plays professionally for the team that has won two consecutive Italian League championships , Dream Team merchandise is his best_seller . Coldebella said the Italians also know that the United States left many of its best collegians from last season at_home . Glenn Robinson of Purdue and Jason Kidd of California turned pro ; Corliss Williamson of Arkansas and Randolph Childress of Wake Forest were injured , and Ed O ' Bannon of UCLA and Marcus Camby of Massachusetts had to hit the books . Still , Coldebella and his teammates should not diminish their accomplishment . The players representing the United States might not be considered as even a collegiate Dream Team , but neither are they 12 guys from Backwater A &amp; M . Five went_to last season ' s Final Four , including Duke ' s Cherokee Parks and Arizona ' s Damon Stoudamire . And if history is an accurate precursor , virtually all_of them will some day have a shot at the NBA . Of 25 players on U.S. teams in the 1986 and ' 90 Goodwill Games , 22 became NBA first-round draft choices . &quot; I came_over here feeling we had enough talent to win , &quot; U.S. Coach George Raveling said . Instead , the United States will play for third place against Russia , which lost to Puerto Rico , 69-65 , in the other semifinal game . Before the tournament , a Raveling assistant scouted the Americans ' three first-round opponents , including the Russians , who beat them , 77-75 , Sunday . But Raveling said he did not know much more about the Italians than what he saw here during their first-round games , all victories . There was not much more to know . Italy , second in the European Championships as recently as 1991 , hit bottom last year when it failed to qualify for the final tournament to determine Europe ' s representatives in next month ' s World Championships at Toronto . The federation responded by firing the coach and hiring Messina from Bologna . His first act was to cut several stars , whom he called prima_donnas , and replace them with players who have less talent but fit better into his disciplined system . &quot; I have a lot of international experience , and that is as well-coached a team as I have coached against in some 20 odd years , &quot; Raveling said . &quot; There is no question that tonight they were the superior basketball_team . To suggest anything else would be foolish. &quot; That is not a new phenomenon . In recent years , the United States has won only one major international title . That was in the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona , where it used the Dream Team . It no doubt will win again in Toronto with Dream Team II . But it is apparent that the lion king of basketball can no longer just roll the ball onto the floor , send any combination of college players after it and expect them to come_home with gold medals . Raveling said that USA Basketball , which governs teams that represent the country internationally , is perpetually seeking incentives to coax the best college players to participate . But even if they want to play , he said , increased academic pressures often prevent them from having their summers free . &quot; If we had our best college kids here , that would have been enough , &quot; Raveling said . &quot; But our system doesn ' t lend to that. &quot; The other factor is that most of the opposing teams are composed of more mature and internationally experienced professionals . That would not have made much difference a decade ago , but it does now because foreign teams have improved significantly . &quot; Americans need to understand that these other countries are efficient at basketball , &quot; Raveling said . &quot; We don ' t see a lot of international basketball other_than the Olympics , so we don ' t get a chance to appreciate Italian basketball , Brazilian basketball , Croatian basketball . There are a lot of countries that play good basketball. &quot; The United States can even learn from them . After seeing teams play here , Raveling said he is intrigued by the international trend of placing good-shooting centers outside so that more space is created underneath the basket for free-flowing offenses . &quot; Maybe that ' s an even more efficient way to play the game than we do , &quot; he said . &quot; Maybe we ' ve retarded the progress of our big men by confining them to a small area . I hope we ' re not so egotistical that we can ' t look_at this objectively and see if it ' s something that is adaptable to our basketball. &quot;</TEXT>
