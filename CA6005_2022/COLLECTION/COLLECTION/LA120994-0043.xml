   <HEADLINE> ANYONE REMEMBER U.N. ARTICLE 51 ? ; THE BOSNIAN WAR MAY ONLY BE BEGINNING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Wednesday NATO gave its staff two days to produce a plan for the withdrawal of all 24 # 000 U.N. peacekeepers from Bosnia . On Thursday President Clinton offered U.S. ground troops to assist in the withdrawal . ( The United States is expected to contribute about half of a combined NATO force of up_to 45 # 000. ) The causes of the U.N. collapse in Bosnia aside , we applaud the President ' s alacrity in offering American assistance in this grim evacuation . BLOOD BATH FEARED : Once the peacekeepers are gone , Serb victory may follow and thereafter an &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; blood bath to which no outsider will be witness . In addition , the war may well widen before it ends . Croats are again fighting Serbs both in Bosnia and Croatia . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has threatened to carry the war to Zagreb , the Croatian capital . And the war may_not be waged by local combatants alone . On Wednesday Turkish Foreign Minister Murat Karayalcin said that Muslim countries are ready to provide troops and equipment for Bosnia when UNPROFOR leaves . A day earlier Bosnia ' s president met in Geneva behind closed doors with a new Islamic &quot; Contact Group &quot; -- Pakistan , Senegal , Saudi_Arabia , Iran , Malaysia , Turkey and Egypt . Some Muslim UNPROFOR contingents may decline to be evacuated , among them Jordan ' s ( 3 # 367 ) and Pakistan ' s ( 3 # 017 ) , the two only slightly smaller than France ' s ( 4 # 489 ) and Britain ' s ( 3 # 405 ) . Once the United Nations has left Bosnia , the U.N. Security_Council may seek to lift the arms embargo that has prevented Bosnia from effectively defending itself . Russia may use its veto to keep the embargo in place . But as respect for the United Nations drops to a new low , the veto may be ignored . The Islamic Contact Group may publicly reject it , and pressure could mount in the U.S. Congress to do the same . Under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter , any nation has the right to defend itself . Watch for Article 51 to be widely invoked . European antipathy to an enlarged Muslim force in Bosnia , particularly if it enjoyed any U.S. support , could be intense . Because of it , Russia could receive unexpected support for its suggestion that the Western European Union replace NATO ( and that , by unmistakable implication , Russia replace the United States in European collective_security ) . According to sources cited in the Guardian newspaper of London , &quot; the ( British ) Government is for the first time giving serious consideration to alternatives to NATO. &quot; TIME OF DESPERATION : The outcome of these developments is unpredictable , and just that makes them ominous . Because the Serb aggression aims not at domination but at expulsion and extermination , surrender may_not be an option for the Muslims and Croats . But a battle to the death does not proceed like a forest_fire burning itself out . Real people , whose fate will be known worldwide , are involved . No one knows what they or others reacting to their plight may do . Our only , hesitant advice to the Clinton_Administration must be : Do not conduct American diplomacy as if this war were over . It may be only now beginning .</TEXT>
