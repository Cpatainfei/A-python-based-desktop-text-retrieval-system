   <HEADLINE> PACKARD : SOUTH COUNTY CITIES NEED SAY ON BASE ; EL TORO : CONGRESSMAN SAYS HE WILL BE WATCHING THE NINE-MEMBER AGENCY TO ENSURE THE AREA IS ' TREATED FAIRLY ' IN THE SITE CONVERSION DECISION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lending his political clout to south Orange County cities , Rep . Ron Packard ( R-Oceanside ) said Tuesday that the area should have a greater say in the redevelopment planning for the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station and should &quot; not roll_over &quot; if they feel their interests are not being protected . Packard stopped short of criticizing the structure of the El Toro planning agency proposed last month by the Board of Supervisors and Irvine , saying it is a local decision . But the congressman , who sits on the powerful House Appropriations Committee and whose district includes part of South County , said he would be watching the El Toro agency to ensure South County cities are &quot; treated fairly. &quot; The proposed nine-member board that will pick the final base conversion plan includes the five supervisors , three Irvine representatives and one from Lake Forest . The 29 remaining Orange County cities will be invited to sit on an advisory panel that will screen redevelopment plans . &quot; If ( South County leaders ) have deep concerns , they ought to do what they can to change the structure &quot; of the agency , Packard said in an interview following his private meeting with the city officials . &quot; I think this is of such importance that nobody ought to roll_over and say ' We have put_up a good fight. ' The planning has got_to be done well. &quot; But he also acknowledged the county ' s difficulty in reaching a compromise on the makeup of the planning agency , and warned against prolonging the debate over whether a commercial airport should be developed at the base . That political fight could force the federal_government to take the decision away from local officials , Packard said . &quot; I think we all know and agree that we will never have an opportunity to plan a major part of Orange County like we do under this scenario , &quot; Packard said of the 4 # 700-acre site . &quot; My hope is that one issue or one question will not so dominate that it will cloud or influence or negate any planning effort. &quot; Packard is a longtime opponent of a commercial airport at El Toro , favoring instead general aviation operations once the Marines move_out in 1999 . &quot; I have no solutions for ( South County officials ) , and I am not going_to be carrying any legislation or any other effort to try to prevent anything from happening at this point , &quot; he added . &quot; We are not at that point yet. &quot; Laguna Niguel Councilwoman Patricia C . Bates said afterward that she was surprised to learn that commercial aviation could operate at El Toro on an interim basis as the Marines move_out and the redevelopment plan is being finalized , with approval from the El Toro planning agency . The board &quot; certainly has authority we were not aware of . It ' s a very , very powerful group , &quot; she added . Laguna Hills Councilwoman Melody Carruth added that Packard &quot; was pleased that we stood_up for the citizens of South County to make_sure their voices are heard. &quot; In addition to Bates and Carruth , council_members from Dana Point , Laguna Beach and Lake Forest attended , as well as a representative from Leisure World of Laguna Hills . The session also signaled the continuing determination of South County cities to influence the El Toro planning process even though they are expected to be left_off the county ' s decision-making board . South County officials plan to meet this month in Washington with officials of federal agencies that will be involved in the base conversion , including the Federal Aviation Administration . Fearing the FAA has already decided that El Toro should become an international airport , Mission Viejo Mayor Susan Withrow said the delegation wants to make_sure &quot; there ' s no preconceived notion and that they are going_to go_into this ( planning process ) with an open mind. &quot;</TEXT>
