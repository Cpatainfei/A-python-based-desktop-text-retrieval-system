   <TEXT> When Mary Brennan ' s husband had heart_surgery , she took_advantage of the new federal family leave policy to take four weeks off from her job running the fax center at Millipore Corp . to care_for him at_home . Paul Labelle , public relations director at Stratus Computer in nearby Marlboro , Mass. , and his wife also took four weeks of unpaid family medical leave to adopt a child from the former Soviet republic of Moldova . Now they are each working half time for three months so they can help 10-month-old Justin Nikolae adjust to his family . &quot; Our paramount objective was to complete an adoption , &quot; Labelle said . &quot; It was a sigh of relief to know that because a new federal law was_on the books , our employers had to give us the time_off and guarantee our jobs. &quot; But school secretary Debbie Pollio of New Castle , Pa. , had a different experience . She was rebuffed when she asked_for family medical leave to take her mother to Pittsburgh for cancer treatment . Although the leave eventually was granted after an appeal_to the school_board , her boss became so angry , she says , that he harassed her until she quit . &quot; He royally reamed me out for going above his head , &quot; she said . Her husband had been right , she acknowledged , when he advised her not to expect the new family leave law to make a difference to her employer . A year after Congress enacted the Family and Medical Leave Act , countless employees across the country have been able to take_time_off from work to respond to medical emergencies or family crises without fear of losing their jobs . And many companies have found the law far less onerous than they believed it would be . For the most part , according to Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich , the frivolous requests companies feared have not materialized and , because most workers can ill-afford unpaid time_off , the overall number of requests has been smaller than anticipated . In some cases , companies have even improved on the federal law , crafting family leave policies more generous than required . But it is also clear that many employers are still confused about the law , and at least some are resisting it outright -- because of threatened disruptions to their businesses or simple personal pique . &quot; It has been as hard as we thought it would be if not harder because the confusion over what an employer has to do to comply with the law is tremendous , &quot; said Peter Eide of the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce , which for years lobbied against such legislation . The administrative burdens of the new mandate are especially acute for smaller companies without legal staffs and personnel resources , he added . And some employers say they resent the law because , they say , it gives the government an inappropriate right to meddle in their business . The 9 to 5 National Assn . of Working Women said in a recent report on the law ' s first year that employees frequently have faced retaliation from employers for taking_advantage of the leave . The organization is pressing for better enforcement and a more effective way of informing employees and employers about their rights under the law . In one sign of the problems , the Labor_Department has processed almost 1 # 000 complaints from employees who have charged their employers with illegally denying them leave , firing them for taking_time_off , or failing to cover their health benefits while they are out , as required by law . In most cases , the conflicts were resolved with a phone_call , federal_officials say . But about a tenth of the cases have required more attention , and the government recently filed the first two lawsuits against employers in connection with the law . Reich maintained that confusion and occasional resistance are to be expected in the first year of a new law and that compliance will improve as more and more companies become familiar_with the policy . With some exceptions , the family leave law specifies that companies employing more_than 50 workers must grant employees who request it up_to 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually to care_for a new child or a seriously ill immediate family member , or to recover from an illness . Companies are required to continue medical benefits for employees on_leave and reinstate them in the same or equivalent jobs when they return . Noting that the current law applies to only about 44 % of women and 50 % of men in the work_force , employee and women ' s rights advocates say they hope that the law can be expanded to include employees of smaller companies and part-time workers and to provide paid leaves for low-income workers . When Clinton signed the legislation on Feb . 5 , 1993 -- one of his first acts_as President -- he said it would &quot; promote national interests in preserving family integrity. &quot; By enabling people to balance careers and families , he added , &quot; it will provide Americans what they need most -- peace of mind. &quot; In some cases that peace_of_mind has been elusive . Five months into her pregnancy with triplets , Carla Seale went_into premature labor and her husband , Randy , rushed her to the hospital . Although doctors were able to interrupt labor , it was clear that the lives of the unborn triplets were in peril . Randy Seale asked his employer , Associated Milk Producers Inc. of Amarillo , Tex. , for family medical leave so he could tend to his wife and soon-to-be-born children . A week later , he was fired without notice from his job as a truck_driver delivering milk from a dairy to a cheese plant . &quot; It put me under a lot of additional stress , &quot; Carla Seale said . &quot; We had to worry about his job and where we were going_to get money for the bills , on top of worrying if the babies would make it. &quot; After failing to persuade the company to reinstate Seale , the Labor_Department filed suit against Associated Milk Producers , charging it violated the law by firing Seale . The couple and their triplets , who were born three months prematurely and have been hospitalized for most of their lives , had to move_in with Carla Seale ' s parents because they ran_out of money . Randy Seale earns about half his previous salary picking_up work as a mechanic and truck_driver and says he wants his old job back . Sonny Pride , assistant region manager for the company , said his firm was &quot; flabbergasted &quot; by the lawsuit because the firm already had agreed to reinstate Seale after being approached by Labor_Department officials . Pride said Seale was terminated because he failed to keep the company informed of his intentions . The only remaining dispute between the department and the company , he said , was over whether the company owed Seale back wages . &quot; He left at a time when we were in desperate need of drivers , but we understood his position , &quot; Pride said . &quot; We would have never terminated him if he had done the proper paper work or at least called to say he could not do it. &quot; Jennifer Rohnstock , who worked_at the advertising_department of a major women ' s clothing retailer in the Boston area , found herself locked_in a testy debate with her employer when she developed pregnancy complications and sought family leave . &quot; I did not think they were interpreting the law right , &quot; Rohnstock said . &quot; The constant back-and-forth with my company was very frustrating and definitely contributed to a very stressful time. &quot; Federal_officials maintain , however , that such episodes are in the minority and based largely on misinformation and poor communication . &quot; The fact that 90 % of the complaints were so easily resolved suggests to me that employers still have a long way to go_to understand the law , &quot; Reich said . When it was initially proposed , some employers strongly opposed the legislation , fearing they would be overwhelmed with requests for leave time . A similar bill was vetoed in 1992 by President George_Bush , largely because of the anticipated impact on businesses . But &quot; fears that employers had -- such_as employees taking_advantage of the law -- seem not to have been borne_out at all , &quot; Reich said , adding that companies report only a tiny percentage of their employees are requesting the leaves . &quot; What people don ' t understand is that this is without pay , &quot; said Beverly Carothers , benefits manager of the Cambridge , Mass.-based Polaroid Corp . &quot; Not that many people take_advantage of it. &quot; A survey of 300 personnel officers at a conference of the Society for Human Resource Management found that three-quarters complained about the administrative headaches in administering the law . About 35 % , however , reported improvements in employee morale and productivity . Some companies , like Massachusetts-based Millipore Corp. , have chosen to go several steps further than the federal law requires and are finding that the policy helps encourage employee loyalty . Millipore offers to pay employees during the first four weeks of their leaves . In the first year , 137 of Millipore ' s 3 # 000 employees took family medical leaves averaging four weeks . Previously , the company , which manufactures purification devices in the upscale Boston suburb of Bedford , offered no paternity leave and other leaves were granted at the discretion of supervisors . Few people took them . While supervisors sometimes grumble about staffing problems , the company has found its more liberal leave policy to be relatively inexpensive . A survey found that the company spent only about $ 20 # 000 for temporary employees and overtime in the first year , according to Gail Warner , the company ' s benefits manager . She says she believes that loss is made_up in higher productivity when employees return . &quot; I think we gain more_than we ' ve lost , &quot; Warner said . Employees agree . &quot; I think you give_back so_much more . They were committed to you in your time of need , so you ' re more committed to them , &quot; said Carol Melle , an executive_secretary who took_leave last year to be with her 2-year-old son while he was undergoing surgery . &quot; People say you can separate your life from your work , but you can ' t. &quot; Jim Dimento , 33 , recalled being so worried about losing his job when his first child was hospitalized as a newborn that he spent his time shuttling from work to the hospital and could not give his wife or new son the proper attention . There was no such dilemma when his second child was born , after he transferred to Millipore . He is already planning to take more leave to care_for his father , who has terminal cancer . &quot; It ' s reassuring to know this is something you can depend_on , &quot; Dimento , a systems design engineer , said . &quot; It increases your loyalty to your company , &quot; said Deepak Kini , 29 , a chemical engineer who recently took four weeks of paternity leave . Brennan , who took time to nurse her husband back to health after heart_surgery , said the new policy made taking_time_off a lot less stressful .
