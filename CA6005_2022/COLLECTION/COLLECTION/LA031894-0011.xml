   <HEADLINE> OSCAR IS ONE AWARD THE GIPPER EARNED BUT HASN ' T WON -- YET ; HOLLYWOOD : THE PRESIDENT WHO WAS PROUD TO BE AN ACTOR DESERVES THE ACADEMY ' S NOTICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here we go again . Oscar time approaches and there is no hint of recognition for a man regarded by some in the film community as simply a B-movie star from the 1940s and ' 50s . Not only did he never win an Oscar for his acting , but he actually played straight_man to a monkey . Then , of course , there is his politics . In an industry decimated by AIDS and dominated by influential men and women who were intensely liberal on the Soviet_Union , the air-traffic-controller ' s strike , the U.S. defense buildup , economics , abortion and Central_America , the mere mention of his name causes seething tempers . The very idea of the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences awarding an honorary Oscar to Ronald Reagan does not appear to have the slightest support from the Academy ' s members . that ' s a shame . With the ascendancy of the Clintons to the White_House , liberals in Hollywood looked_forward to the opportunity for more involvement in Washington politics . &quot; We ' re in ! &quot; exclaimed a jubilant Barbra Streisand at the inaugural gala . Surely it was disconcerting for the Hollywood activists to find themselves under_attack a_few months later -- not from conservatives but from liberal journalists and politicians . The reason was blunt and had to hurt : Streisand and company were only actors . They might have fame and cash -- always helpful in a campaign -- but the election was over , policy was being discussed and actors have no business in the debate . &quot; I ' m proud_of having been an actor , &quot; Reagan told his biographer , Lou Cannon . Ironically , the former President has so thoroughly dominated the political and policy landscape of America for so_long that his involvement with the motion-picture business is now generally relegated to footnote status . Long since forgotten is this gem from Democratic Gov . Pat Brown in a 1966 campaign TV commercial titled &quot; Man vs . Actor : &quot; &quot; I ' m running against an actor , and you know who shot Lincoln , don ' t you ? &quot; That was only one line of a chorus that , as Streisand and her liberal colleagues have now rediscovered , is used repeatedly by professional politicians and policymakers to insinuate that successful work in Hollywood somehow disenfranchises an otherwise qualified citizen from participating as fully in the national debates as , say , a computer salesman from Dallas . The whole tiresome line is meant to imply that actors are dumb , spoiled and useful only as cash_cows for infinitely more knowledgeable and serious people . Reagan never hesitated to stand_up against this notion , going_out of his way as President to bring both actors and movies to the White_House . Reagan happily hosted non-supporter and Oscar-winning director Warren Beatty for a White_House screening of his epic film &quot; Reds. &quot; In Reagan ' s 40-year movie career , he made 53 motion_pictures , including &quot; King ' s Row , &quot; his favorite , and &quot; Knute Rockne , All American , &quot; in which he won the nickname &quot; Gipper &quot; for his portrayal of dying Notre Dame football star George Gipp . He was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild seven times . Reagan served as a co-host of the Oscar ceremony ( with Bob Hope ) in 1952 . The Academy ' s treatment of the only actor President is particularly puzzling when looked_at through a Washington lens . Like Hollywood , Washington reveres its stars , understanding that the best of them make the system work by forthrightly holding to their honorably held views . Reagan is permanently fixed in Washington ' s 200-year-old &quot; star system &quot; alongside names like Webster , Calhoun and Clay , Lincoln and Douglas , Wilson , Roosevelt , Eisenhower and Kennedy . All of these people spoke out fearlessly for what they believed was best for the country in their time . Sometimes it was at the price of their lives , a price Reagan himself almost paid at the hands of a deranged movie fan . &quot; When the battle is over and the ground is cooled , well , it ' s then that you see the opposing general ' s valor , &quot; Reagan said of John F . Kennedy at a fund-raiser for the Kennedy Library at Ted Kennedy ' s home_in the mid-1980s . &quot; Many men are great , but few capture the imagination and the spirit of the times . The ones who do are unforgettable. &quot; It could perhaps be said that Reagan , who also captured the imagination and spirit of his times , has received so many honors that recognition by the academy would be superfluous . Still , it is too_bad that , at 83 , this former SAG president , governor of California and President of the United States won ' t receive an award that may seem superfluous to many , although probably not to him .</TEXT>
