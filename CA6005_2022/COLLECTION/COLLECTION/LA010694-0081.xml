   <HEADLINE> FAILURE OF MARS PROBE BLAMED ON FUEL LEAK ; SPACE : A FEDERAL PANEL INVESTIGATING THE ILL-FATED MISSION ALSO CITES SLOPPY WORKMANSHIP AND CRITICIZES JPL MANAGEMENT OF THE PROJECT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal panel investigating the disappearance of NASA ' s Mars Observer space_probe concluded Wednesday that the spacecraft leaked enough fuel -- barely two tablespoonfuls -- to cause an explosion , knocking the first U.S. mission to Mars in 17 years out of contact with Earth . The panel of NASA-appointed experts , which has conducted an exhaustive review of the project since the spacecraft vanished Aug . 21 , also cited evidence of sloppy workmanship and criticized management at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory , which had overall responsibility for the interplanetary probe , as &quot; inappropriate. &quot; The Mars Observer , the first U.S. interplanetary probe to fail in flight since 1967 , was designed to provide the most detailed look yet at the planet , serving as a pathfinder for an international armada of probes to be launched toward Mars in coming decades . Officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and at JPL , who concurred with the board findings Wednesday , earlier had blamed the failure of the $ 980-million mission on a broken transistor in a small but crucial on-board clock . Another group , called the Mission Success Review Team at Martin-Marietta Corp. , which built the missing probe and two other satellites that failed last year , attributed the Observer ' s demise to an attitude : overconfidence on the part of the engineers who built the probe . No one knows for certain exacply what happened to Observer . No sign of the probe has been detected since last August . Mission controllers plan one last attempt to contact the missing spacecraft next month , but they do not expect the probe to reply . &quot; The board , in fact , found no smoking gun , &quot; said Timothy Coffey , research_director of the Naval Research Laboratory , who led the panel . &quot; There was no telemetry from the spacecraft , no hard evidence to investigate . Therefore , it was impossible to provide conclusive evidence , &quot; Coffey said . &quot; The most probable scenario was a massive rupture of the pressurization system. &quot; * The Observer ' s 450-million-mile voyage had proceeded uneventfully until three days before its scheduled rendezvous with Mars . To avoid damaging its communications gear , ground controllers at JPL turned_off the spacecraft ' s communications_system while its propulsion_system was pressurized . Contact was never restored . After evaluating 60 different failure scenarios , the panel concluded that the most likely cause was a rupture of the probe ' s titanium fuel_lines , triggered by a slow leak of nitrogen tetroxide and monomethyl hydrazine during the spacecraft ' s silent 11-month journey through space . When the tanks were pressurized Aug . 21 , the dribble of volatile chemicals could have ignited inside the fuel_line , generating pressure of up_to 10 # 000 pounds per square_inch and a temperature as high as 2 # 000 degrees Centigrade in a_few millionths of a second . At such a temperature , Coffey said , the fuel_line would have the strength of butter . At best , the ruptured fuel_line would act like a jet to send the spacecraft tumbling out of control . At worst , the probe could have exploded . &quot; In all likelihood , there is still a Mars Observer up there , &quot; Coffey said , but it is a craft that is &quot; essentially dead . The spacecraft would not know which direction it was pointing or in what direction it is rotating. &quot; While the panel settled_on the possible fuel leak as the most likely mechanical cause of the probe ' s disappearance , it said there were broader design and management problems as well . &quot; JPL was not as familiar_with the spacecraft as it should have been , &quot; Coffey said . He cited &quot; systemic weaknesses &quot; that &quot; remain a concern for future programs. &quot; * When the Mars Observer was conceived more_than a decade ago , agency planners designed it as a low-cost , production-line spacecraft -- the first in a series of inexpensive &quot; generic &quot; planetary probes that would capitalize on existing technology , just like the series of low-cost Discovery probes that the agency is developing today under similar budget constraints . The design also utilized equipment developed to operate safely in the shelter of low Earth orbit , but it was subjected_to the more extreme conditions of interplanetary_space . As funding dwindled and subsequent planetary missions were canceled in the 1980s , however , agency managers were unable to keep their technical expectations within the boundaries of a fixed-cost contract . They changed the instrument packages the probe was to carry . They did not work closely enough with the engineers constructing the probe , the panel said , and lost sight of the changes that transformed the Observer into a custom-built spacecraft . JPL officials acknowledged the problem . &quot; The ( JPL ) management approach certainly made the job more difficult , &quot; said JPL Director Edward Stone . JPL Deputy Director Larry N . Dumas characterized the problem as &quot; creeping requirements &quot; and &quot; management Band-Aids. &quot; &quot; The pressure of the number of changes and demands for systems integration was much greater than expected , &quot; Dumas said . Troubled Spacecraft A federal panel Wednesday announced the findings of its inquiry into the Aug . 21 disappearance of the $ 980 million Mars Observer spacecraft . Exactly what happened to the space_probe is not known , but the independent panel found these problems : Mechanical flaw : A leak of volatile hydrazine fuel may have caused an explosion when the spacecraft ' s tanks were pressurized . Design flaw : NASA engineers used technology that had been developed for operation in near-Earth orbit but was unsuitable for the more extreme conditions of interplanetary_space . Management flaw : Project managers at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory did not exercise sufficient control continuing changes in the spacecraft ' s design and its scientific_instruments .
