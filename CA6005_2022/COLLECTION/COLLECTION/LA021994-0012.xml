   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL EMBARKS_ON NEIGHBORLY MISSION OF HOPE TO SYRIA ; MIDEAST : GOVERNMENT REACHES_OUT TO BEREAVED ASSAD . IT IS HOPED KINDNESS WILL ALSO SPUR PEACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The head of Israel ' s Democratic Arab Party said Friday that he will lead an official delegation of Israeli Arabs to Damascus , marking the first visit to Syria of a member of Israel ' s Parliament , the Knesset . The 31-member delegation of municipal leaders , writers , religious figures and others will pay condolences to Syrian President Hafez Assad on the death of his son , but Israeli officials hope the visit may also indicate an important thaw in the peace process . &quot; This is a positive signal , and I praise this signal , but it has its limitations , &quot; said Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres . &quot; This is not yet an outbreak of opportunities. &quot; Knesset member Abdul Wahab Darawshe , who will head the delegation on its trip during the next few days , said the group was going_on a strictly humanitarian mission , but he did not rule_out possible advances in the peace process between Israel and Syria . &quot; It may project a better atmosphere . I believe , generally speaking , that the visit will have a positive impact on peace , &quot; said Darawshe , one of seven Israeli Arabs in the 120-seat Knesset and a leading spokesman for Israel ' s 800 # 000 Arabs . Another Arab Knesset member , Talib Sanaa , will also be part of the delegation . The announcement comes as peace talks between Israel and Syria reopened this week in Washington , strained by the firing on Wednesday of a Russian-made Katyusha rocket into northern Israel from southern Lebanon , the first violation of a cease-fire that ended a major Israeli military operation last June designed to wipe_out guerrilla operations on the Israel-Lebanon border . Because Syrian forces control the majority of Lebanese territory , Israel quickly raised an alarm , and U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley met with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi to urge a halt to the attacks . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , conferring in Washington with Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin , telephoned Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh . The situation reportedly was calmed when U.S. officials transmitted to Israel a message that Damascus stands behind the cease-fire agreement and had been unaware of the Katyusha firing into the western Galilee . In Jerusalem , Israeli officials sought to lower the temperature , saying they believe the rocket was fired by a Palestinian fringe group , the Black 13th of September Brigades . That organization was founded in southern Lebanon by Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat ' s disgruntled former military commander after the signing of the Sept . 13 peace agreement between Israel and the PLO . &quot; I understand this Katyusha came from the side of a marginal and unimportant organization , &quot; Peres said . &quot; I would not build the entire policy on the ( basis ) of the shooting of one Katyusha. &quot; Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel ' s understanding with Syria concerned operations of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon , not other organizations . &quot; The understandings in the area with the Syrians regarding Hezbollah remain in_force , &quot; he said . &quot; Our understandings were about the operations of Hezbollah , and they are being kept. &quot; Up to seven more Katyusha rockets were fired into Israel ' s self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon on Thursday and Friday , and Israeli defense forces hit back with artillery_fire . There were no casualties . The announcement that an Israeli Arab delegation would be permitted to visit Syria followed complaints by Rabin that an earlier Syrian refusal to admit the group represented Syria ' s failure to take the peace process seriously . &quot; Regretfully , even if I believe that Syria wants peace , according to its behavior , Syria is not doing what is necessary in_order to truthfully demonstrate to the Israeli people that it has genuinely turned toward peace , &quot; Rabin said after Syria initially rejected the delegation ' s visit . The turnabout came_after intervention from Egyptian Foreign Minister Amir Moussa and was conveyed this week to the Israeli Arab delegation by Egypt ' s ambassador to Israel , Mohammed Bassiouny . &quot; As I know , it is the first time that the Syrian government is allowing an Israeli Arab citizen to enter Syria , &quot; Darawshe said . He said that while the delegation expects to meet with Assad , they do not have any specific political agenda to discuss , nor will they be carrying any messages from Rabin . &quot; We want to express our condolences to the president , his family and the Syrian people over the death of his son , &quot; he said . &quot; There is no connection with the peace efforts , but if anything useful should arise from the visit , I would welcome it. &quot; Assad ' s son Basil was killed in a traffic accident last month .</TEXT>
