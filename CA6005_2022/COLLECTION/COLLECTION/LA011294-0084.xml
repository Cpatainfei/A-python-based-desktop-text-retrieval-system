   <HEADLINE> NATO BROADENS THREAT TO LAUNCH BOSNIA AIR STRIKES ; EUROPE : CLINTON AND ALLIES STATE READINESS TO SAVE OTHER AREAS AS WELL AS SARAJEVO . MILITARY_ACTION APPEARS MORE LIKELY , BUT SECURITY_COUNCIL APPROVAL IS NEEDED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton and the 15 other Western Alliance leaders Tuesday broadened NATO ' s threat to intervene in Bosnia-Herzegovina , declaring they are prepared to launch air strikes in two areas -- in addition to Sarajevo . The decision effectively extends the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s warning made last August to use air_attacks to prevent the fall of the Bosnian capital to include the besieged Muslim enclaves of Srebrenica and Tuzla . &quot; We reaffirm our readiness , under the authority of the United Nations Security_Council , &quot; said Tuesday ' s declaration , which came at the end of the two-day NATO summit_meeting , &quot; to carry_out air strikes in_order to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo , the safe areas and other threatened areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina. &quot; An additional phrase , agreed to by the NATO leaders only at the last minute , said that NATO officials should draw_up expanded plans for air strikes . The decision , which Clinton stressed was made unanimously after prolonged official-level discussions Monday night and into the early hours Tuesday , appeared to make Western military intervention somewhat more likely . Clinton told a post-summit news_conference that an actual decision to use force &quot; depends largely on what the Bosnia Serbs do. &quot; Under the terms of NATO ' s potential involvement , however , no air strikes can be launched without the approval of the U.N. Security_Council . Although the declaration widens and toughens the circumstances under which the alliance would use force in Bosnia , Clinton said he did not interpret it as a lowering of the tripwire that would send NATO aircraft -- mostly American jets -- into action . &quot; I don ' t know that the threshold is lower , &quot; the President said , &quot; but there are more instances in which air_power can be used now under the NATO policy. &quot; Whether or not air strikes would actually be launched , the President said before a NATO audience , &quot; depends_on the behavior of the Bosnian Serbs from this moment forward . . . . And what the military commanders come_back and recommend. &quot; Inclusion of the Tuzla region -- where nearly 1 million people live_in the largest area still under Bosnian government control -- in NATO ' s new plan is aimed at reopening the airport in the eastern Bosnian city . That installation , which rebel Serbian units have kept closed , is considered vital for the flow of relief supplies to the region ' s beleaguered civilian population . Air strikes to free the enclave of Srebrenica , southeast of Tuzla , would enable trapped Canadian forces among the U.N. peacekeepers there to be replaced by fresh Dutch troops . That transfer has been prevented by hostile Serbian forces . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic , who had warned against any new NATO threat , remained defiant Tuesday as his followers continued to besiege Sarajevo with an artillery assault . He reiterated an earlier position by stating , from his base just outside the capital , that the alliance declaration &quot; would prompt us to reconsider land concessions offered to the Muslims. &quot; And in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade , the Bosnian Serb army ' s chief_of_staff , Manojlo Milovanovic , played_down the seriousness of NATO ' s new threats , the Associated Press reported . &quot; They cannot strike at us without also hitting U.N. forces , &quot; he said . &quot; Our tactics are to keep close to the U.N. troops. &quot; On Monday , Clinton had warned that the alliance should not use threatening language against the warring forces in Bosnia unless it was prepared to carry_out the threats . At his Tuesday news_conference , Clinton insisted that because he had recommended that strong language against the Serbs not be included in the declaration unless the alliance meant business , the threat was therefore real . NATO Secretary_General Manfred Woerner also insisted that the alliance was prepared to act militarily . &quot; My impression is that there is a clear determination not to continue the ( Bosnian ) situation as it stands , &quot; he said . When asked whether NATO had a choice of acting militarily or &quot; packing up and leaving , &quot; Woerner replied , &quot; Preparedness to leave , no -- preparedness to do what is necessary. &quot; The agreement on air strikes reportedly came_after a recommendation by the_French and British , who along with the Canadians and Spanish have troops in the former Yugoslav federation under U.N. auspices . But a senior White_House official told reporters aboard Air_Force One that France and the United States were never at loggerheads over Bosnia and had reached basic agreement last week . At a NATO leaders ' dinner Monday night , French President Francois Mitterrand and British Prime_Minister John Major pushed for action on Srebrenica and Tuzla . Clinton said yes , but only if the declaration also reaffirmed the NATO commitment to Sarajevo , the official said . He said any use of U.S. air_power at Srebrenica and Tuzla would be close air support of U.N. troops , and he added that the United States was also willing to supply technical assistance such_as electronic_equipment for the Tuzla airport . But the official flatly ruled_out any commitment of U.S. ground troops . He said Major and Mitterrand were not enthusiastic about the idea of air strikes around Sarajevo , and he expressed concern that use of force there might constitute a major escalation , because it would constitute direct intervention on the side of the city ' s largely Muslim defenders . The agreement on Bosnia came at the end of an extraordinarily successful European debut for Clinton in Brussels , the first leg of his first trip to the Old_World as President . As he departed for Prague later in the day , he could look_back on a number of considerable achievements . Among them : * He presided over the rejuvenation of an alliance that had lost its way amid the debris of the Cold_War , restoring its sense_of_purpose and cohesion . &quot; A historic turning point , &quot; Woerner said . At a news_conference , Woerner said the leaders of the alliance were &quot; impressed with the strong leadership , resolve , and personal conviction of the American President. &quot; Other leaders made similar comments . * He was able to announce Monday a major agreement with Ukraine and Russia to eliminate more_than 1 # 800 warheads from Ukraine , now the world ' s third-largest nuclear_power . * He sold his initially controversial &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; initiative to some skeptical allies in such a way that , in the end , all signed_on enthusiastically . The plan offers close military cooperation with the new democracies of the former Soviet empire , stopping short of offering the full NATO membership that many of these countries wanted . * He blessed European unity and an independent West European security grouping in a manner that made Europeans glow yet at_the_same_time underscored America ' s commitment to the continent by pledging to keep 100 # 000 troops there . * With European Union Commission President Jacques Delors nodding approvingly beside him , Clinton also urged the rich nations of Europe to open their markets to the struggling new democracies to the east , arguing that increased trade is a key ingredient to the prosperity needed to fend_off rising nationalism in the region . * He survived the sensitive Bosnia issue and , although the alliance ' s new position hardly marked a bold departure , the President kept both his dignity and NATO ' s unity intact . * Perhaps most important for transatlantic relations in the medium term , Clinton touched a chord among Europeans from prime_ministers to taxi drivers that triggered an outpouring of warmth and goodwill in Western Europe unseen since the 1963 visit of another youthful American President -- John F . Kennedy . The overall mood of the summit itself in many ways merely reaffirmed that at times of genuine crisis , Europeans appear willing to stop bickering among themselves and look_to the United States for leadership .
