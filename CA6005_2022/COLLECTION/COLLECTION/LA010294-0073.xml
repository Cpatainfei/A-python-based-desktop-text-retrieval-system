   <HEADLINE> NEW TOOLS HELP FDA GET TOUGHER IN TRACKING THREATS TO PRODUCT SAFETY ; PUBLIC HEALTH : THE DECISION TO TURN A SMALL CINCINNATI FIELD LAB INTO A STATE-OF-THE-ART NATIONAL FORENSIC CHEMISTRY CENTER WAS MADE AFTER SEVERAL EMBARRASSING INCIDENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than four years ago , a scare over the possible cyanide_poisoning of grapes imported from Chile stumped the Food and Drug Administration . Were the grapes really tainted ? If so , by whom , and when ? Would they be dangerous if consumed ? The answers never came . Though agency investigators found cyanide in two grapes plucked from among tens of thousands sitting on a Philadelphia dock , they could never say whether the contamination took_place in Chile , on a boat en route to the United States , on the docks or perhaps at the FDA ' s own lab . There was controversy over how much cyanide was in the two grapes . There was confusion over the threat to public health . Grocery shelves were cleared . Tons of fruit spoiled as the FDA imposed an embargo , then lifted it five days later . Chilean growers lost an estimated $ 240 million . In the end , there was little evidence that the threat was real , but substantial evidence that the agency charged with policing thousands of consumer goods and much of the nation ' s food supply was not equipped to do the job . Fast forward to June , 1993 , when consumers began complaining of syringes found in Pepsi products . Detecting a syringe was not a daunting task , but determining whether the soda itself had been tainted called_for sophisticated analysis . Forensic scientists at an FDA lab here -- opened after the grape fiasco -- analyzed samples of the soda , syringes and cans with electron_microscopes and other equipment . They concluded the soda was not contaminated . No product recall would be necessary . As the FDA advised consumers that they could protect themselves by shaking the container or emptying the drink into a glass , members of a newly formed FDA criminal investigative team began &quot; flying polygraphers across the country &quot; interviewing those who had complained , said FDA Commissioner David A . Kessler . They went_to Winfield , Ill. , where hospital employee Keith Willis said he had found a syringe in a Pepsi bought from the hospital vending machine . Under questioning by a polygraph operator , he admitted he had put the syringe in the can , according to an affidavit prepared by FDA agent Gregory Simpson . They went_to Milwaukee , where Katherine Wuerl , an employee of a local newspaper , also admitted to the syringe hoax after an FDA agent and an FBI polygraph expert quizzed her about discrepancies in her story , according to Assistant U.S. Atty . Steven M . Biskupic . Why , they asked , had she shifted from Diet Pepsi to Pepsi ? Why had she bought the soda at a suburban store , but waited until three hours later to open it when she was with a group of people in the newspaper ' s employee lounge ? One day , Wuerl ' s first-person account of finding the syringe was front-page news in the Milwaukee Sentinel ; now she faces_up to a year in prison for allegedly violating the Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act by making false product-tampering claims . In all , 37 people have been charged . Guilty pleas or convictions have been obtained in 13 cases ; charges are pending in the 24 other cases . In contrast to the grape case , the investigative work_on the Pepsi incident was swift and definitive . It allowed Kessler to reveal the hoax quickly , announce arrests and end an incident that otherwise might have continued to worry consumers and the company . Just as significant , the response marked a turning point in the agency ' s evolution as the nation ' s chief commodity cop . The criminal unit &quot; has already proven its value , &quot; said Rep . John D . Dingell ( D-Mich. ) , who spearheaded several investigations into the FDA . And the manufacturer of Pepsi , understandably , is pleased . &quot; Our product was_on trial , and the fact that they moved so quickly helped , &quot; said Pepsi spokesman Andrew Giangola . &quot; It would have been potentially catastrophic had the situation continued to play itself out. &quot; * Three years ago there was more disdain than regard for the FDA . &quot; Clueless &quot; is how one congressional staff aide who researched the agency for an oversight committee described the FDA then . &quot; The whole agency by the end of the 1980s was just in hideous shape . They were defenseless , &quot; the staff_member said . As Chile and the fruit industry pressed to recover damages from the cyanide scare , the FDA suffered further when outside criminal and congressional investigators found that some of the country ' s largest makers of generic drugs had submitted fraudulent test data to the agency and bribed FDA officials to allow products onto the market . Kessler said the agency ' s weakness was clear : There were plenty of regulators on staff who understood how the food and drug industry should work , but few with the investigative ability to ferret_out fraud , track_down counterfeit pill makers or draw a confession from someone calling_in a fake product complaint . Shortly after taking_office in 1990 , Kessler announced plans to establish the new 100-member Office of Criminal Investigations , for the first time putting a fully trained federal police_force behind the Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act . The force , which has been operating since January , was assembled by Terrell Vermillion , a 23-year veteran of the Secret_Service . The agents have an average of 12 years of experience in other federal law_enforcement agencies . The unit has helped develop an attempted murder case against a Florida woman who put lye in cough syrup she gave to her twins . It also is helping in the prosecution of a company charged with selling &quot; look-alike &quot; amphetamines in Iowa . The number of people charged in the Pepsi case already is more_than were cited under product tampering laws in the decade since those provisions were enacted in 1983 , according to the FDA . The decision to turn a small Cincinnati field lab into a state-of-the-art National Forensic Chemistry Center was made shortly after the grape incident . Besides working_on cases sent by Vermillion ' s investigators , researchers also are creating an encyclopedia that outlines what happens when poisons or other contaminants are put_in common consumer products . That vital information was missing in the grape crisis , said lab director Fred Fricke . No one was sure , for example , what cyanide would do to a grape , how much poison the fruit could absorb or what a poisoned grape would look_like at different stages . &quot; We just did not know all_of the reactions to cyanide in fruit at that time -- would it turn an apple purple , or whatever , &quot; said Fricke , a 30-year FDA veteran . &quot; We had none of those answers. &quot; In an effort to get answers , Fricke ' s small lab of four researchers was expanded to 29 , including 11 people with doctorates . The bulk of the staff ' s time is spent on specific cases , but otherwise researchers are free to hypothesize about questions such_as this : What would happen if a vengeful drug lord tried to taint bananas with cocaine ? ( The answer : Not much . Cocaine ingested orally would be harmful only in amounts so large that the contamination would be obvious. ) Meanwhile , the lab continues its work_on Pepsi -- partly to bolster pending criminal prosecutions and partly to add_to its general understanding of soft_drinks .</TEXT>
