   <HEADLINE> DOING BUSINESS ; TINY ISLAND ANGLING FOR OFFSHORE BANKING ; MALAYSIA ' S REMOTE LABUAN HAS NO NATURAL_RESOURCES AND LITTLE INDUSTRY . BUT IT HAS LOTS OF AMBITION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First , a short geography quiz : You may have heard of Grand Cayman , Malta and even Guernsey . But can you find Nauru , Vanuatu and Labuan ? And what do they all have in common ? Yes , they are all fairly remote islands . But all six also are up-and-coming IOFCs , an acronym in the banking_industry for international offshore financial_centers . They may epitomize the term backwater , but they are attracting billions of dollars in investments and deposits . The granddaddy of offshore banking was , of course , Switzerland , which provided overseas depositors with the first guarantees of secrecy and low taxes on their wealth . But Switzerland is highly regulated and more and more open about its banks , so depositors with money to park &quot; offshore &quot; have increasingly looked elsewhere . Labuan is the latest island to join the rush for offshore banks and companies . A flyspeck on most world maps , Labuan lies just off the northern coast of the island of Borneo , about 80 miles southwest of the city of Kota Kinabalu . The Malaysian government decided in 1989 to turn Labuan into an offshore financial_center , enacting bank secrecy laws , making the island a duty-free port and imposing a corporate tax of just 3 % , up_to a maximum of $ 7 # 800 , compared with the 40 % corporate tax_rate in the rest of Malaysia . According to Ramli Othman , an official with the Malaysian Industrial Development Board , the government chose the island because it has no natural_resources and little industry to provide jobs for its 50 # 000 inhabitants . Malaysia wrested control of the island from the state of Sabah in 1984 , and it is now ruled as a federal territory -- a little bit like the District_of_Columbia -- directly from Kuala Lumpur , the Malaysian_capital . So the government of Prime_Minister Mahathir Mohammed had a strong political reason for wanting to pump development dollars into the island . Another , more cynical view of the government ' s motives , which is expressed by critics on Labuan , is that senior government officials bought_up land on the island at bargain prices and now stand to make large profits . In a recent court case , for example , it was revealed that a former chief minister of Sabah , Harris Mohammed Salleh , claimed to be the owner of the island ' s only golf_course . A more unlikely spot for a financial_center would be hard to imagine . The 35-square-mile island is a 20-minute propeller_plane flight from Kota Kinabalu , which is itself not exactly world renowned . The island had a fleeting fame in the closing days of World_War_II as the site of a sharp battle between Japanese and Australian forces . The airport exists thanks to the Japanese occupation army , and there are large war memorials to Japanese and Australian soldiers on opposite sides of the island . * Before offshore banking came_along , the island ' s main sources of income derived from its geography : as a port to ships serving the offshore oil_industry in the waters off Borneo and as a somewhat tawdry rest-and-recreation spot for expatriates resident in Brunei , which is Islamic and allows no alcohol . The main town of Labuan has a large_number of crowded discotheques . The government reckons that its location may help Labuan catch_on among foreign banks because it is just two hours behind the time in Tokyo and in the same time_zone as Hong Kong and Singapore . The hope is that customers will prefer to deposit their cash_in a bank in the same time_zone as these major financial_centers rather than in one halfway around the world . &quot; The location of Labuan is ideal , in the heart of the Asia-Pacific region , &quot; said Mainor Awang , general_manager of the Labuan Development Authority . After three years as an active offshore financial_center , Labuan has attracted 16 banks , he said , and about 250 companies have registered here . The government hopes those numbers will swell following the completion of a huge financial park costing $ 148 million . The center will feature five 18-story buildings , two of them apartments and the remainder offices and shops . In addition , two five-star hotels are under construction nearby , and a $ 50-million marina project is_on the drawing boards . The Malaysian government is trying to be selective about which banks are given licenses to operate in Labuan because choosing which customers can use the island ' s facilities will be solely up_to the banks . The belief is that prominent banks will weed out suspicious characters so that Labuan will not get the reputation as a repository for drug money that has afflicted some_other offshore centers . &quot; If we confine ourselves to big banks that will not do something which will smear their name , that in itself is a protective measure , &quot; said Mohammed Ibrahim , the representative of Bank Negara , Malaysia ' s central_bank . According to Malaysian press reports , deposits in Labuan banks are now estimated at about $ 1.8 billion and they have loaned $ 4.5 billion . Paradoxically , most of Labuan ' s business has been in Malaysia rather than overseas . By offering lower tax_rates , the government made_it cheaper for foreign banks to loan money to domestic Malaysian companies , so foreign banks were given an incentive to set_up offices in Labuan . Most of the offices are small , and management remains behind in Kuala Lumpur . * Anthony Ginsberg -- a Los Angeles accountant who publishes a newsletter called Offshore Outlook , which specializes in covering the world ' s 40 or so offshore banking centers -- said he believes Labuan has great potential because of its location but that it is still not competitive with some_other centers . For example , Ginsberg said , 15 # 000 companies a year have been registering in the_British Virgin Islands and Grand Cayman . The majority of these are based in Hong Kong but incorporate overseas to protect their offshore income from Hong Kong taxes . Ginsberg said that while Labuan charges a maximum $ 7 # 800 corporate tax a year , it is at a disadvantage compared with the_British Virgin Islands and Grand Cayman , which have no taxes at all . Ginsberg suggested that Labuan should rewrite its tax laws to compete with Grand Cayman and urged Malaysia to permit trading of actual goods in Labuan , which would allow companies to take_advantage of the location as a warehousing center for cargo moving_around the Pacific . Western_Samoa , another Pacific island that has gone_into offshore business , lets companies register for several years at one time and allows them to use Chinese characters -- a clear appeal_to Hong Kong firms , Ginsberg noted . Another paradox is that while Labuan was designated an offshore center in a bid to provide jobs for people on the island , nearly all_of the people involved in the banking_industry have been imported from faraway Kuala Lumpur . &quot; There is not very much benefit to the local people , &quot; said Zaini Mohammed Isa , an opposition politician . &quot; Before , all_the heads of government_departments in Labuan were from Labuan or at least Sabah . Now they are all from West Malaysia. &quot; While acknowledging the problem , government officials such_as Awang of the Labuan Development Authority maintain that the local people &quot; don ' t have the expertise &quot; and that skilled_workers are needed from the start . &quot; We have to learn from somebody , &quot; Awang said , noting that he too is from Kuala Lumpur . Other Centers There are about 40 offshore banking centers in the world . Some major ones : * EUROPE Andorra Channel Islands Cyprus Guernsey Isle_of_Man Jersey Liechtenstein Luxembourg Malta Monaco Switzerland * MIDEAST Bahrain Oman * CARIBBEAN Anguilla Bermuda Bahamas British Virgin Islands Cayman Islands * PACIFIC Marshall Islands Nauru Vanuatu</TEXT>
