   <HEADLINE> PALM LATITUDES : THE BIZ ; STAGE FIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I have no words , --My voice is in my sword Those are fighting words , spoken by Macduff just before he parries with Macbeth and severs his head . It ' s one of Shakespeare ' s great fight scenes and it is rehearsed regularly at the Gascon Center for Stage Combat in Culver City . The school , founded six years ago as part of the Westside Fencing Center , is a favorite of Hollywood fight choreographers searching for talent . To showcase the school ' s two_dozen students , Gascon stages fight performance nights that present historical and contemporary stage and film battles using broadswords , quarterstaffs , rapiers , daggers and whips . Although Gascon ' s four fight instructors teach historical accuracy , most choreographers want some &quot; flash and dash , &quot; says instructor Ted Katzoff . &quot; The way in which a person fights reveals much about their character on stage and certainly in real_life -- but it ' s all about creating illusions , &quot; he adds . Among the current warrior-wannabes is Geena Davis who Katzoff is teaching to wield a rapier , dagger and saber for &quot; Cutthroat Island , &quot; a pirate film set_in 1650 . The school also has taught swordplay to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , Robin Williams , Shelley Long , Keanu Reeves and Eric Roberts . Actors who take Gascon ' s courses say a good thrust and parry adds dimension to their work . &quot; It used to be part of an actor ' s training , &quot; says T.J. Rotolo , 28 , who has done extra work . &quot; I like Shakespeare , so it seemed natural to do this . Plus , I can ' t sing or dance , so this makes me more marketable. &quot; R .
