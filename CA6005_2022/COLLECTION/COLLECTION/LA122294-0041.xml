   <HEADLINE> LIFE &amp; TIMES / WENDY MILLER : DIGGING_UP THE PAST AS A MODERN-DAY HOBBY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> New subdivisions . New malls . New theaters . We tend to think_of our county as a monument to modernism . Ancient history ? Anything that happened before the Simi Valley Freeway was finished . The dark ages ? An unenlightened era prior to the coming of cable_television . In geological_time , of course , these last few decades have gone_by in the blink_of_an_eye . Despite rumors to the contrary , the county existed long before the first automobile chugged over the Conejo Grade . Or even before there was a Conejo Grade . Given our desert-like conditions these days , it ' s hard to imagine the county covered with seawater , but at one time there wasn ' t a dry spot from the mountains of Ojai to the Oxnard Plain . The county ' s waterlogged past may surprise you , but it ' s one of many interesting facts unearthed by staff writer Jeff Meyers , who did this week ' s Centerpiece on fossil hunting . &quot; Prehistoric Ventura County was not a friendly place , &quot; Meyers said . &quot; Underwater volcanoes in Thousand Oaks . Violent earth movement in Simi Valley . San Bernardino was the closest beach. &quot; The county didn ' t dry_up until about 25 millions years ago , but the receding water left_behind a cache of marine_animals that make Ventura a prime fossil-hunting playground . The rare Ventura County starfish , pictured on our cover , is especially prized by collectors . &quot; It may_not be a femur from a brontosaurus , but the little starfish can make a fossil-hunter ' s day , &quot; Meyers said . Marine fossils come_in all shapes and sizes . Bones from whales and sharks are found in the east county , but we also have an array of land-based animal remains , from mammoths and saber-tooth cats to rhino-like creatures . Fossil hunting is relevant this time_of_year because digging_up a fossil is a little like opening a Christmas_present . &quot; Fossil hunters say the anticipation and excitement is the same , &quot; Meyers said . Fossil hunting takes a lot of knowledge and a fascination with the past -- two reasons for its obscurity as a recreational activity . Those who do take_part usually become obsessed for life , finding fossil hunting &quot; a very rewarding and satisfying hobby , &quot; Meyers said . But messy . Fossil hunters have to get their nails dirty , which is why you ' ll never catch me at a dig site . No , if I ' m doing any hunting , it ' s for last-minute stocking stuffers . If you ' re in the same boat , read our Shop_Talk column . Free-lance writer Leo Smith wades in with advice on how to find inexpensive , quality trinkets that will never become extinct .</TEXT>
