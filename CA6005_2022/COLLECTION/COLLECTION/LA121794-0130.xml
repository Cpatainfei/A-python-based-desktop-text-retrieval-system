   <HEADLINE> U.S. SAYS STING PIERCED CALI OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal law_enforcement authorities Friday took the cover off a nearly three-year money-laundering investigation that set_up a Caribbean offshore bank to penetrate the Colombian Cali drug cartel and damaged a link between the cartel and a rising Italian organized crime group . In addition to producing 88 arrests and the seizure of about 9 tons of cocaine and $ 52 million in cash and property , Operation Dinero took possession of three paintings purportedly by Rubens , Reynolds and Picasso . In addition , Italian authorities seized an arms-smuggling ship . &quot; The United States_government and the international_law enforcement community have made great strides in undermining and disrupting the Cali cartel ' s financial operations -- the lifeblood of their organization , &quot; said Thomas A . Constantine , chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration , at a press_conference announcing the operation . The elaborate undercover operation , which eventually involved law_enforcement officials in five countries and four federal investigative agencies , began in Atlanta in early 1992 when undercover DEA agents were commissioned by Cali operatives to set_up money pickups in the United States and Europe . Related DEA , FBI and Internal Revenue Service investigations , in which undercover operatives won the confidence of Cali representatives , also took_place in Los Angeles , New York and Houston . In all , these operations laundered $ 39 # 549 , 209 in illicit drug funds , all_of which was returned to the Cali cartel ' s custody and control , DEA and IRS officials said . With the cooperation of British authorities , Operation Dinero set_up a private bank in Anguilla , British West Indies , which laundered an additional $ 8.9 million in non-cash , wire transactions for the Cali organization , beginning last July . * This led to identifying hidden accounts and assets of cartel figures , DEA and IRS officials said . &quot; This is the first time we ' ve ever gotten_to the level of operating a secret offshore bank that they felt very comfortable with , &quot; Constantine said . Signaling a new priority on disrupting drug trafficking operations through undercover money_laundering , IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson said that the operation should force launderers to ask themselves before their next transaction whether they are dealing with a genuine bank or the IRS . &quot; If it ' s the IRS , the terms we are offering are 20 years -- and with no interest , &quot; Richardson told the press_conference at DEA headquarters . Constantine did not appear entirely comfortable with the concept of laundering more_than $ 48 million for the cartel , even though it produced what he and other DEA officials described as invaluable intelligence that investigators will be pursuing for months as the inquiry continues . He described it as &quot; a difficult decision &quot; but noted that the cocaine traffickers would have been able to launder the funds elsewhere with impunity . Robert E . Bender , special_agent in_charge of the DEA ' s Los Angeles office , said : &quot; Probably the most significant thing ( was that ) the DEA was instrumental in interrupting the flow of money back to the Colombian ( cartel ) . . . . that ' s their heart and soul . . . . They can justify losing a load of cocaine but when they lose their money , that hurts them. &quot; In addition to the bank , several undercover corporations were set_up in different locations to serve as &quot; front &quot; businesses in supplying loans , cashier ' s checks , peso exchanges and wire transfers and to create holding companies or shell_corporations for the trafficking groups , DEA officials said . Operation Dinero established a direct link between the Cali cartel and an Italian organized crime group headed by Pasquale C . Locatelli , which had operations in France , Romania , Croatia , Spain , Greece , Italy and Canada , according to the DEA . Locatelli had been serving a drug distribution sentence in a French prison when he escaped by helicopter in 1989 . Last September , he was arrested in Spain as a result of the operation , along with alleged accomplices in Italy and Spain . The Locatelli group , not considered one of the traditional , long established Italian organized crime organizations , used ships off the Colombian coast to pick_up drugs and carry them to North Africa , where they were transferred to smaller craft from Southern Europe , the DEA said . Recently , North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization forces intercepted one of the Locatelli group ' s vessels , suspecting that it was smuggling arms in violation of a United Nations embargo . A search of the ship at an Italian port turned_up small arms and ammunition in two of 81 containers and the Italian military is currently holding the ship and containers . In Los Angeles , 17 arrests were reported -- three of them Thursday -- along with the seizure of 25 kilograms of cocaine and $ 2.5 million in cash . Most of those arrested were identified as part of a local money-laundering &quot; cell &quot; that funneled $ 5 million through a Los Angeles-based DEA agent who was one of those going undercover as part of the sting . According to an affidavit filed by the DEA in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , Ramona Sanchez , a Spanish-speaking agent , was hooked_up last spring with the Cali Cartel ' s secretive Southern California money-laundering ring with the help of a &quot; confidential informant &quot; who gained the confidence of a top &quot; broker &quot; for the drug cartel . The cartel ' s representative had indicated that the Colombian drug operation wished to launder &quot; up_to $ 1 million in such proceeds per week , &quot; according to the affidavit . * Contacted through codes punched up_on her phone beeper -- usually instructing her to call pay phones -- Sanchez then met the money couriers in such locations as the parking_lots of a Toys ' R ' Us store in Rosemead , a Fuddruckers restaurant in Pasadena and outside a Robinsons-May department_store at the Montebello Town Center . There she was given duffel_bags or suitcases containing up_to $ 872 # 000 by the drug couriers , most of whom were Colombian women later found to be living modestly in apartments in the area . As with other undercover operatives in the nationwide sting , Sanchez posed as someone who had contacts with crooked bankers supposedly willing to process such large amounts without alerting authorities . * Ostrow reported from Washington and Lieberman reported from Los Angeles .</TEXT>
