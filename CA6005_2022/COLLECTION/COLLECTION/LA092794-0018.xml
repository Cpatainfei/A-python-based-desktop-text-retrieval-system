   <HEADLINE> PROPERTY VALUES : CLOSING ESCROW IN HOME SALES IS BECOMING MORE ELUSIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A growing percentage of residential sales transactions are failing to close escrow , local real_estate_agents , lenders and escrow officers say . Homes are falling_out of escrow more frequently , they say , because of buyers who can ' t get loans , or home inspections that reveal expensive earthquake-related defects , or the phenomenon of so-called short_sales where sellers try -- but often fail -- to get a lender ' s OK on a sale for less than the balance of the seller ' s mortgage . Both sides to a real_estate transaction must sign a cancellation instruction to cancel escrow . If one party can ' t or won ' t follow_through on the deal , though , the deal falls_out of escrow -- although escrow officially stays open until both parties agree on how to close the escrow account . It ' s serious business , and ought to be avoided if at all possible . Ken Carver , owner of Carver Escrow Co . in North Hollywood , said that about 25 % of the escrows he opens for buyers and sellers fail to close . &quot; This has become pretty standard in our industry , &quot; he said . Most deals fall_out of escrow because people do not qualify for a loan , or because the property is appraised by a lender for less than the sale price . But there are other factors boosting the number of deals that go bust , Carver said . Lenders always require fire_insurance and now increasingly require earthquake insurance , he noted , but the January earthquake has made many insurance_companies reluctant to write new fire and earthquake policies . &quot; We have lost some deals because of not being able to get insurance for the buyer , &quot; Carver said . &quot; All we need is an insurance_policy and sometimes there ' s nobody to write it. &quot; Some sales are never finalized because of relatively minor disputes between the buyer and seller , Carver added . After the earthquake , for example , he observed many buyers and sellers already in escrow arguing over who should pay $ 500 to replace a block wall . &quot; A lot of deals blow because the parties haven ' t discussed all_the issues properly and they haven ' t met in_person , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s easier to compromise when you meet eye-to-eye. &quot; Jerry Bolin , branch sales manager for Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Woodland Hills , said that about 15 % to 18 % of escrows that his agents open never close . One of the main factors driving cancellations is that many property_owners in the San Fernando Valley are &quot; upside down &quot; on their homes -- meaning they owe more_than the property is worth -- and a sale depends_on approval by the lender . About half of buyers and sellers enter escrow before the seller ' s bank has approved the deal , Bolin said . When lenders say no to a short pay-off , escrow doesn ' t close . Buyers who make an offer on a home where the seller wants a short pay-off should demand that their earnest_money check -- a deposit used to open an escrow account -- not be cashed until the seller ' s lender consents to the deal . &quot; I would n ' t want my check_in escrow until the seller has received a letter from the lender that the seller ' s shortfall has been approved , &quot; Bolin said . Buyers can ask that their checks be held and that escrow not open until the lender approves the short pay-off , he said . Since the earthquake , a growing number of homes have been falling_out of escrow because of property defects and damage discovered when buyers thoroughly inspect the homes , said Joe Conrad , president of The Spectrum Group , a mortgage brokerage in Woodland Hills . &quot; The large majority of buyers get_out of the deal because they have a legitimate reason , &quot; he said . What is considered a legitimate reason for getting_out of a contract to buy a home depends_on the wording of the contract , Conrad said . Almost every contract says that the deal is contingent_on a number of factors -- most notably a satisfactory inspection by the buyer and the buyer ' s obtaining financing . If the inspection turns_up serious problems or if the buyer can ' t get a loan , there isn ' t a breach_of_contract and the buyer usually gets_back the money he placed in escrow . The cost to the buyer of falling_out of escrow in this type of situation is usually several hundred dollars in appraisal and inspection fees , and sometimes a cancellation fee charged by an escrow company . If the buyer backs_out of the deal without a good reason , the consequences are more serious . That buyer stands to lose his earnest_money -- which can be up_to 5 % of the purchase_price of the home . The buyer and seller may also end_up suing each other -- and sometimes even the agents join in , demanding their commissions . Buyers who cancel a sale may lose money , but that ' s of little comfort to sellers who see their sales fall_through at the last minute , said Century 21 Alosta Inc. agent Marty Rodriguez in Glendora . Sellers should protect themselves by seeing that the buyer can really deliver on his promises when it comes time to close on the sale of a home . Sellers and their agents should encourage would-be buyers to use a lender or mortgage broker that the seller ' s agent is familiar_with , said Rodriguez . This can help sellers be a little more sure that they are getting a credible assessment about the ability of a buyer to buy the home . If the buyer already has a lender or mortgage broker , the seller may want to encourage the buyer to make double loan_applications -- one with a money source familiar to the buyer and another with a source suggested by the seller . In real_estate industry lingo , this is known as making &quot; double aps. &quot; There are other safeguards , Rodriguez said . Sellers should demand a credit report with an offer to buy . While a credit report won ' t reveal all_the details of a would-be buyer ' s ability to get a loan , it ' s a good start . Another way to avoid falling_out of escrow is for the buyer to be pre-qualified or pre-approved by a reputable lender . A letter of pre-qualification won ' t obligate a lender to make a loan , but such letters at least help show the seller that the buyer is serious . Pre-approval of a loan is one step better . Sellers can also ask_for verification of employment or a copy of the buyer ' s banking or other statements that show there is enough money for the down_payment .</TEXT>
