   <HEADLINE> THE TYPE YOU can ' t TYPE ; FROM ' PULP FICTION ' TO ' MONTH BY THE LAKE , ' UMA THURMAN ' S AT_EASE WITH A RANGE OF ROLES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the age of 24 , Uma Thurman has an enviable acting career . She has played a wide range of roles and has been noticed for all_the right reasons -- for her versatility and skill as an actress . Sure , she was once on the cover of Rolling Stone ' s 1989 Hot Issue , and Mademoiselle magazine once called her &quot; a thinking man ' s sex symbol , &quot; but Thurman herself has done nothing to pursue such hype . Yes , she did appear in some steamy bedroom scenes in_playing the bisexual wife of novelist Henry Miller in &quot; Henry and June &quot; ; but , hey , that was an art-house film , so it was all for a higher purpose . Truth is , Thurman ' s work hasn ' t been dogged either by scandal or controversy in the eight years she has been acting . Until now , that is . She plays Mia , a gangster ' s wife , in &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; the Quentin Tarantino film that opens Friday . It is fair to say that one particular sequence involving Thurman is destined for infamy . Mia is escorted on an evening ' s date by John Travolta , a sidekick of her violent husband , who is out of town . In a retro ' 50s restaurant they dance charmingly together ; she flirts_with him . He frets because his boss is jealous ; the last man she tried to seduce ended_up dead at his hands . * Back at her place she snorts what she thinks is cocaine but is really a deadly heroin cocktail , and lapses into a coma . Fearing for his life , Travolta carries her to his car and takes her to the home of his drug dealer . The two devise a way to save her life , in a jarring , hilarious and unforgettable scene . &quot; I wondered about doing_it at first because the script was so shocking , &quot; Thurman says now . &quot; I haven ' t made a habit of doing films with a lot of violence , and from what was_on the page it was hard to tell , because in anyone else ' s hands it could become a sick movie . &quot; But I let Quentin talk me into it , and I believe_in him . It was a matter of finding_out what was in his heart , and what was in it was good , nothing malicious or full of hatred or exploitative . He has a pure , wild , crazy sense_of_humor , and a passion for filmmaking . And the film ' s funny . Horrifyingly funny , perhaps , but still funny. &quot; She also enjoyed working with Travolta . &quot; That dance scene was so camp , I couldn ' t pass it up . To dance with Travolta was like being able to do a Western with John Wayne ; you ' d happily play some barroom slut just for the opportunity. &quot; She relates all this sitting on a hotel terrace overlooking Lake Como , a place of tranquil beauty where she is making a very different sort of film . In &quot; A Month by the Lake , &quot; directed by John Irvin , and based on an H . E . Bates novella , Edward Fox plays a middle-aged English major vacationing in the late 1930s at an Italian lakeside hotel who becomes stupidly infatuated with the young American nanny played by Thurman . She toys_with his affections , then becomes swiftly and openly bored ; this sends him on the rebound toward an English woman of_his_own age , played by Vanessa Redgrave . Crew_members are tiptoeing around Redgrave and cater to her every whim , trying not to incur her ill_humor . Due homage is paid to legendary Italian actress Alida Valli , who has a small part in &quot; A Month by the Lake &quot; ; she is now 73 and in her sixth decade of filmmaking . Cinematographer Pasqualino de Santis , who made Visconti ' s &quot; Death in Venice &quot; look ravishing , must be addressed as &quot; maestro &quot; ; he and his camera crew sit separately from the others at meals and eat with their own cutlery , china and linen ; none dare to draw_near . Yet all_the talk on set is not of these people , but of Thurman . The crew discuss her comings and goings , wonder out loud if she will be difficult or easy during the coming day , and speculate on the possible cause of her occasional mood swings . She is an object of infinite fascination . At one point , Thurman poses for a photographer in the banquet hall of an 18th-Century villa . She wears a long 1930s-style dress , which accentuates her tall , slim frame ; her hair has been gathered into frizzy curls at the back . Something seems to happen to her before a camera ' s unblinking lens ; she softens , warms and glows . The sight of her reduces Fox to incoherent British schoolboy slang . &quot; Stunning , isn ' t she ? &quot; he hisses . &quot; Crikey . I ' ll say . Yes . Stunning . A . . . a knockout , really. &quot; The attention Thurman effortlessly commands is , on the face of it , puzzling . In eight years as an actress , she has never starred in a hit film , and in fact has appeared in notable flops . The one unqualified success to her name was Stephen Frears ' &quot; Dangerous Liaisons , &quot; in which she played a 15-year-old virgin in 18th-Century France , but her role was subordinate to those of Glenn Close , John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer . * She has played a feisty Maid Marian in a made-for-TV version of Robin_Hood , a kooky young_girl in the commercially neglected John Boorman film &quot; Where the Heart Is &quot; and a Botticelli Venus on a clam shell in Terry Gilliam ' s flamboyant romp &quot; The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. &quot; In &quot; Mad Dog and Glory , &quot; opposite Robert De Niro , she played a young_woman sent by a gangster as a &quot; gift &quot; to a man who saved his life . &quot; She was an indentured servant , &quot; Thurman says acidly of the role . This year has seen no upswing in her fortunes as yet . In Gus Van Sant ' s &quot; Even Cowgirls Get the Blues , &quot; she played Sissy Hankshaw , a bisexual cowgirl with large thumbs , which facilitate her main activity , hitchhiking . The film bombed , despite re-cutting after preview audiences proved lukewarm . &quot; It could have been funnier , &quot; Thurman says flatly . &quot; It should have been funnier. &quot; It all adds_up to a checkered resume , yet Thurman ' s reputation remains unsullied , and she is always in_demand for prestigious movie roles . Somehow she can make a string of indifferent movies , but rise effortlessly above them . Yet , on the hotel terrace overlooking the lake , Thurman immediately starts railing against &quot; that stupid thing about being an actor . The pure acting itself is something I can truthfully say I love . Everything else about it I have an ambivalent relationship with , that whole_thing about being an actor in the celebrity sense . But as my mother would say , that ' s just tough titty. &quot; Unlike many American women of her generation , she is not given to Valley Girl-speak and does not say the word like every few seconds ; she speaks coolly in complete paragraphs , rounding_off her thoughts precisely . &quot; My father still wants me to become an academic , &quot; she says . &quot; But not having had a formal clear road in my education , not having gone_to college , my interests are as varied as my reading list . I love literature , so I ' d probably have gone charging off into English studies. &quot; She is from a liberal , academic , Bohemian background . Her father is a professor , a leading expert in Tibetan studies . Her Swedish-German mother , once married to Timothy Leary , is now a psychotherapist . Her name , Uma , is a Hindu word meaning &quot; bestower of blessings. &quot; She had two yearlong sabbaticals with her parents in India ; at age 15 she persuaded them to let her drop_out of boarding school and try acting . She moved to New York and precociously set_up house in Hell ' s Kitchen , where junkies , muggers and hookers stalk street_corners ; the experience has clearly given her a sophisticated edge . The gamble worked : In New York she landed roles in two low-budget films , &quot; Kiss Daddy Goodnight &quot; and &quot; Johnny Be Good , &quot; and her career began . * Thurman radiates an almost European sensibility on screen and explains that her mother insisted her children should not think_of themselves as American , even though they spent most of her childhood living_in New England college towns . &quot; I ' ve been presented to the world through European films , &quot; she says . &quot; I ' ve worked so_much with European directors : Terry Gilliam , Stephen Frears , John Irvin , John Boorman . ' Henry and June ' was about a European woman . And in_general I have a taste for European films. &quot; She also seems to pursue work in what some would say is a European way , choosing roles for their own value rather than the career breaks they might bring . Tell her the main characteristic of her career has been its immense range of roles , and she positively beams : &quot; Glad you noticed . To say that is the one thing that can flatter me. &quot; It has never been truer . &quot; A Month by the Lake &quot; is a period_piece , a gentle romantic comedy of manners . While it is not from the Merchant Ivory stable , it ' s about English folk in Italy , and is the sort of film whose extras wear cream suits . It could hardly be further removed from &quot; Even Cowgirls Get the Blues &quot; or &quot; Pulp Fiction. &quot; &quot; I love the story , &quot; Thurman says , &quot; the idea of the major having misplaced his concept of what he loved and needed in his life , and finding himself eventually with ( Redgrave ' s character ) . It ' s a story about tender , ' less important ' emotions , and it expresses them beautifully. &quot; She relishes the contrast but hasn ' t always felt so bullish about her career : &quot; Around the time I was 21 , I decided it takes an active relationship with your life in_order not to be gobbled_up by being a movie actress and all_the crap you deal with , that sense of alienation. &quot; She took a break from acting , and spent time with her brother . &quot; At that time , I didn ' t exactly love a lot of the scripts I was being offered . And there were , um , a_few other circumstances. &quot; Indeed there were . In 1991 , Thurman married British actor Gary Oldman ; the couple had been an item for some three years . But the marriage ended after 18 months amid speculation that Oldman ' s volatile personality had wrecked the union ; indeed , her association with Oldman has fueled talk that Thurman is something of a wild child herself . Her colleagues don ' t necessarily disagree . Redgrave says , &quot; She ' s special , a fantastically good actress as well as being very beautiful . She has a marvelously individual sense of character and comedy. &quot; John Irvin adds : &quot; She has an idiosyncratic way of finding a character -- there ' s a wildness about her . &quot; The joy of Uma is she ' s never dull , predictable or safe. &quot;</TEXT>
