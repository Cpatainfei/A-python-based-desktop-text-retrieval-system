   <HEADLINE> AILING HEIR TO MORMON PRESIDENCY BACK AT POST ; SUCCESSION : IF THE 86-YEAR-OLD SENIOR APOSTLE IS TOO ILL TO ASSUME LEADERSHIP , IT WILL LEAVE CHURCH IN ' TERRIBLE QUANDARY , ' OFFICIALS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He is frail and cannot walk without help , but the 86-year-old heir to the mantle of prophet to more_than 8 million Mormons worldwide is back at_work . Howard W . Hunter , president of the Council of the 12 Apostles , spent nearly six months recuperating from gallbladder surgery in May . He has made the trip from his home to the church ' s Administration Building almost daily for the past two months . The state of Hunter ' s health is critical to the Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints , whose president , Ezra Taft Benson , 94 , has been frail for several years . The church will not comment on Benson ' s condition except in the vaguest terms . However , this summer , his grandson , Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Steve Benson said the church president is confined to his apartment under a nurse ' s care . Age , he said , has stilled the elder Benson ' s voice and clouded his mind . Hunter ' s health is also a concern because at no time in the faith ' s 163-year history has a designated successor been too frail or sick to assume the presidency . Such a situation would leave the church &quot; in a terrible quandary , &quot; and not just for ecclesiastical reasons , said D . Michael Quinn , author of an upcoming book on the Mormon hierarchy . The governing First Presidency -- made_up of Benson and his two counselors -- has become the center of the faith ' s multibillion-dollar corporate structure , Quinn said . Church presidents serve for life and are chosen through a strict tradition of apostolic succession based on seniority within the Council of the 12 Apostles . If the senior apostle , in this case Hunter , were mentally disabled , either through age or for some_other reason , there is no doctrinal precedent for filling the role and the corporation could founder . But the church may_not be faced with that dilemma . Those close to Hunter , who suffered a recent bout of the flu , say that his overall health is relatively good . &quot; He ' s doing remarkably well , &quot; said Hunter ' s son , Richard , of San Jose , Calif . &quot; I find it incredible , bouncing_back the way he does. &quot; Richard Hunter and church spokesman Don LeFevre said that for the past month or so , the senior Hunter has been at the office &quot; virtually every day , &quot; often working six or seven hours . &quot; He has felt well enough to attend his regular meetings and to handle his responsibilities as president of the Council of 12 Apostles from his office , &quot; LeFevre said in a statement . Hunter declined to be interviewed , as did other council_members . Hunter , a Boise , Ida. , native and a corporate attorney who lived_in Los Angeles for more_than 30 years before moving here , has suffered a variety of ailments : a heart_attack , bypass surgery and weakened legs that have forced him to use a walker . He spends much of his time in a wheelchair . In 1989 , Hunter lost his balance and fell while speaking at the church ' s general conference . He pulled himself back to the podium and completed the speech . His health_problems and the loss of his first wife in 1983 led to a bout with depression . He remarried in 1990 , at age 82 . Hunter requires help getting_into his walker , Richard Hunter said , although sometimes he can push himself up from a sitting position . His most serious problems came last spring when he went_into the hospital for a gallbladder operation . Hunter ' s condition deteriorated after the May 10 surgery and he spent four weeks in the hospital . &quot; Of course , we all would have hoped the recovery would have happened more quickly , &quot; Richard Hunter said . &quot; But before the surgery , he was told then that he would n ' t be doing what he ' s doing now , so you have to measure by that. &quot; Virtually every conversation about Hunter includes the caveat , &quot; For a man of his age . . . &quot; It is no secret that his 86 years have left him physically frail , although apparently mentally sound . Hunter was named to the council in 1959 . If he becomes president , he will be the first Mormon leader born in the 20th Century . Gordon B . Hinckley , 83 , Benson ' s first counselor , follows Hunter . Since church founder Joseph_Smith ' s murder in 1844 , the 11 presidents before Benson averaged 85 years of_age at death . The average age today of the three-member First Presidency and the Council of the 12 Apostles is 74 . When a church president dies , the First Presidency is dissolved and the council and former counselors meet in the Salt Lake Temple to ordain the new president . He picks his counselors , and the trio immediately execute a variety of documents that ensure a smooth transition . That could not happen if the senior apostle were mentally incapacitated , Quinn said . In the 19th Century , the church was able to operate without a First Presidency , and did so on three occasions . It would be more difficult , if not impossible , for that to happen now . Given his understanding of Hunter ' s health , Quinn said a change in leadership now would be relatively uneventful .</TEXT>
