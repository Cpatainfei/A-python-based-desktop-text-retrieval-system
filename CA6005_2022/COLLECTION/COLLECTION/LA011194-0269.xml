   <HEADLINE> A YOUNG STAR IS BORN IN ' PIANO ' ; MOVIES : NOVICE ANNA PAQUIN , 11 , WHO HAS RECEIVED A GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATION FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS , RETRACES THE FAIRY-TALE ROAD SHE HAS TRAVELED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hollywood ' s A-list actors and directors generally place a high premium on awards . But to 11-year-old New Zealander Anna Paquin whose first screen performance as Holly Hunter ' s daughter in Jane Campion ' s &quot; The Piano &quot; earned her a Golden Globe best supporting actress nomination and a shared prize from the L.A. Film Critics , the honors are just another curve in the fairy-tale road she ' s traveled since landing the role . When pressed as_to whether the experience has made a marked difference in her life , she throws_up her hands . &quot; If you could give me my life without it , I would tell you , &quot; she observes philosophically in her first and only press interview . &quot; But , that ' s not the case. &quot; In Los Angeles to shoot a series of MCI commercials , Paquin is alternately shy and forthcoming , childlike and precocious , depending_on the subject at_hand . Ask about her dramatic technique , her co-stars Hunter , Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill , or her opinion of the highly acclaimed film -- the story of a mute Scottish woman involved in a highly charged love triangle in 19th-Century New Zealand -- and Paquin merely shrugs . But when it comes_to delineating the chain of events that led her to the project , she rambles_on nonstop . &quot; Two years ago , my sister ran_into a friend who had seen a story in the paper announcing auditions for the part , &quot; says Paquin who , despite the California sunshine , is sporting a green turtleneck , red sweater and floral hat in an effort to fight_off the flu . &quot; Though I never acted before , when I heard both of them were trying_out , I wanted to go , too . My father said if I was interested I ' d have to ring_up myself . ' Come_to blah , blah , blah at such-and-such a place , ' they told me . They needed to find girls who looked the right way . ' Too tall , too this , too that ' . . . You had to be able to pass -- or , at least , be short enough -- to be Holly Hunter ' s daughter. &quot; Five thousand girls showed_up for the session . Paquin , as one of three finalists , was instructed to return in two days to read a passage . Memorizing posed no problems , she asserts , and the taping went without a hitch . A few weeks later , she was called_back for a workshop / audition in Auckland . * &quot; We found_out later that she already had the part , &quot; recalls the 44-year-old Brian Paquin , a tall , down-to-earth physical_education teacher who insisted on monitoring the interview . &quot; After viewing her tape , they knew they had their person -- she read the speech almost as well as in the movie , I was told . Anna wanted it and really went_for it . The workshop was scheduled only to see if she could handle the stress of a workday. &quot; Anna Paquin recalls being &quot; a bit excited , though not terribly nervous &quot; at the prospect of tackling the role and &quot; probably more naive than most. &quot; The part called_on her not only to deliver her own lines but , frequently , to serve as her mother ' s interpreter in the speaking world . During rehearsals , the young actress took_up sign_language and had to master a Scottish accent . Dialogue coach Edward Campbell came_to her house every week or so , Scottish soap_operas in_hand . If the Miramax production notes call the accent &quot; the hardest thing about becoming Flora , &quot; the actress begs to differ . &quot; that ' s not true , &quot; she protests vehemently . &quot; They ( Miramax ) never asked me ! &quot; Still , when the reporter asks_for a sample , the youngster immediately clams_up . &quot; Waitresses in restaurants , people all_over have been asking Anna to perform , &quot; interjects her father , whose mission , as he sees it , is to keep life for Anna , his wife , Mary , and their two other children as normal as possible . &quot; We ' re trying to avoid the trained seal syndrome , the dog jumping through the hoop. &quot; Her colleagues have called her &quot; fearless , &quot; a concept to which she doesn ' t relate . More to_the_point , says her father , who joined her on the set , she ' s &quot; an intelligent child who picks_up intuitively what ' s going_on . Anna takes direction , but fills_in the gaps quite nicely by herself. &quot; * For the movie to work , the relationship between mother and daughter -- strangers in a strange land -- had to be inordinately close . Hanging out with Hunter off-camera helped Paquin to cement the bond . &quot; Before I went_to New Zealand , I had a lot of anxiety about who would be playing my daughter , &quot; allows Hunter , who still exchanges letters with her young charge . &quot; If we didn ' t have a connection , I didn ' t know if I could handle the extra workload . You may or may_not like an adult actor , but , with certain choices and a learned professionalism , you can usually pull_together a chemistry on-screen . With children , though , it ' s impossible to lie . Their priorities are less formulated and the responses uncensored . This was a gamble but , as it happened , a magical one. &quot; If Paquin is taking her newfound success in stride , she ' s not above reveling in the fact that a certain ballet teacher who once dismissed her has now changed her tune . &quot; She played favorites , &quot; she explains . &quot; If you weren ' t going_to be a prima_ballerina , she would n ' t pay you any attention . I was always a back dancer . I played a skunk in one performance in which my brother was Prince Charming . The teacher now conducts a weekly session in my gymnastics class and she treats me slightly differently . She even tells me if my toes aren ' t pointed. &quot; Father and daughter will not discuss the future -- or whether acting will figure into it . No offers have come their way , he says , so no decisions have to be made . Their focus , they insist , is fixed on the present . Big deal or not , the Golden Globe Awards on Jan . 22 are of more_than passing interest since &quot; they sort of lead_up to the Oscars -- which I highly doubt I ' ll win , &quot; she maintains . As for the Oscars , &quot; I just want to get nominated . At the very worst , get nominated. &quot; In February she ' ll be starting sixth grade at a new school in Wellington ( &quot; the capital city of the north isle &quot; ) -- a prospect Paquin finds more daunting than plunging into &quot; The Piano. &quot; &quot; I didn ' t know anything about making movies before , &quot; the young actress says . &quot; It ' s not as glamorous as it seems -- especially when you have to do something many , many times . My favorite scene , playing football with a cabbage in the mud , never got_in . For that matter , neither did my least favorite one : sitting in a freezing cold stream . And it ' s difficult to judge the film based on what I ' ve been allowed to see of it. &quot; When Anna was initially cast , father and child had no premonition it would become a major motion_picture . Campion had a fine reputation , the elder Paquin acknowledges . But , who would imagine she ' d walk_off with best director trophies from the L.A. and New York film critics , that the &quot; The Piano &quot; would win the Palme d ' Or at the Cannes Film Festival or that Hunter would pull_off a best actress sweep ? &quot; Jane ' s work has been primarily art-house stuff rather than mass appeal , &quot; he says . &quot; When I saw the rushes for this movie , I thought it was primarily for the European market with some interest in Australia because of the content . I told my mother in Winnipeg , Canada , that , if we ' re lucky , it might come_to her local theater in a_few years . &quot; Suddenly , we ' re dealing with ' Jurassic Piano , ' &quot; he says , flashing a smile . &quot; Fortunately for us who are trying to keep Anna a kid a while longer , New Zealand is pretty removed from it all. &quot;</TEXT>
