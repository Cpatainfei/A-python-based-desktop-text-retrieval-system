   <HEADLINE> WIRING THE WORLD / THE NEW AGE OF GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ; THE INDUSTRY ; BATTLING FOR A PIECE OF THE GLOBAL PIE ; TELECOMMUNICATIONS IS NOW THE WORLD ' S LARGEST ECONOMIC SECTOR , WITH IMPORTANCE THAT SURPASSES THAT OF OIL , STEEL -- EVEN COMPUTERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seventy years ago , AT &amp; T was a trademark recognized around the world as synonymous with the telephone . Then regulators forced the communications giant to spin_off its international operations and focus_on building a telephone infrastructure for America . Today , as AT &amp; T and other U.S. companies move_out to take_on the world market , they face a bittersweet reality . The once-sleepy telecommunications business has grown to be the world ' s largest economic sector , with a strategic importance that surpasses that of oil , steel or even computers . And while U.S. companies were looking inward these past decades , fragments of the old AT &amp; T empire have emerged as leading world players . Alcatel of France is the world ' s largest supplier of telecommunications_equipment -- it has a 50 % share of the rapidly growing Chinese market -- in large part because of the assets it acquired from ITT , the international operation that was broken_off from AT &amp; T . NEC Corp. , Japan ' s leading communications and computer company , was once a subsidiary of AT &amp; T ' s Western Electric . These companies have strong footholds in world markets that are growing at an astounding rate in size and importance . Anderson Consulting , which counts most of the world ' s leading companies as its clients , figures the telecommunications sector will represent a $ 1.1-trillion industry by the year 2000 , about double its current level . &quot; When you buy a shirt at the store , a computer automatically registers its color , style and size , &quot; says Ali Sabeti , chief of telecommunications for the World_Bank . But that information is useless , Sabeti says , unless it can be sent over phone_lines to the factory in Hong Kong so new shipments will arrive to replenish shelves while the item is still in_demand . &quot; Cheap labor isn ' t enough to be competitive , &quot; Sabeti says . &quot; Countries that don ' t have access to ( telecommunications ) networks can ' t participate in the global economy . They are just left out. &quot; * From China to the Czech Republic , from Mexico to the Middle_East , nations are responding to this new reality . Advanced land-line , mobile and satellite telephone_systems are being installed in record numbers . This year , as_many as 100 million more phones_lines will be connected to the expanding web that is the world telecommunications_system . &quot; One of the major drivers for growth today is the realization of the importance of telecommunications to the economy , &quot; says Roger Dorf , president of AT &amp; T ' s Caribbean and Latin_American network systems operations . &quot; People have discovered that there is more of a willingness and ability to pay ( for telecommunications ) than anybody ever imagined. &quot; In China , which has only one telephone for every 100 people , people are shelling_out $ 1 # 800 just to get_on a two-year waiting_list for phone_service . that ' s many times the average annual salary . China wants to quadruple the number of phones it has in_service by the end of the decade . India has committed itself to spending $ 15 billion to modernize its telecommunications sector , although it is more reluctant than China to permit foreign competition . It has plans for a network of hundreds of satellite dishes to bring telecommunications to remote areas . Industrialized nations such_as Britain , Japan and the United States are taking the next giant step_forward , making plans for massive investments in new interactive systems that can offer education , video on demand and home shopping as well as wireless telecommunications . It is hard to judge just how much of a market this telecommunications boom represents to U.S. companies . Only six countries outside the United States have anything approaching open markets : Australia , Britain Chile , Japan , New Zealand and Sweden . In France , only France Telecom can offer phone_services . And it buys most of its phone equipment from national supplier Alcatel . The same is true of Deutsche Telecom , which has a virtual lock on the German market and buys most of its equipment from German supplier Siemens . Although Japan is nominally open , industry_analysts don ' t expect much of its planned $ 200-billion-plus investment in a new information superhighway over the next two decades to go_to foreign companies . * But freer_world markets may be just a matter of time . Anderson Consulting figures that countries representing more_than half of the world market have either begun the process of dismantling their old telephone monopolies or have concrete plans to do so in the coming years . Those that delay too long may find major multinationals choosing to locate their operations in nearby countries where phone_services are cheaper and better . Already , Britain has become a major communications hub for Europe , and Australia is emerging as a hub for Asia . Even China , once the epitome of the centrally controlled economy , is beginning to introduce competition of sorts lest it be outflanked by upstarts like Vietnam . The government recently created a new telecommunications company made_up of a handful of government ministries to compete with the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications-run phone_company . In Latin_America and Europe , countries have begun to privatize their telephone_systems to tap private capital and finance ambitious expansion plans . The schemes are working . As monopolies have gone private in Britain , Chile and Mexico , they have sucked money into this rapidly growing sector like air into a vacuum . International financier Alan Bond made a killing recently when he sold his 44 % ownership in Chile ' s national carrier to Telefonica de Espana . J.P. Morgan and Citibank are each major investors in two new private telephone_systems established in Argentina . Mutual_funds are pouring billions of dollars of investor money into newly privatized phone_companies in places like Mexico and Singapore . But as with every gold_rush , it is the hardware suppliers who make money first . Research firm Dataquest , a technology research firm , estimates that the world market for telecommunications_equipment will grow to $ 184 billion by 1997 , up nearly 50 % from $ 125 billion last year . Alcatel of France and Siemens of Germany are the world leaders in the business of supplying big switches and other sophisticated gear required to make phones work . AT &amp; T comes_in a weak third as a world supplier . With extensive operations around the world and long experience dealing with overseas customers , the large European companies have a distinct advantage . When Alcatel tackles markets in Latin_America , it can send employees from its operations in Spain or Portugal who are familiar_with the former colonies and speak their languages . &quot; They have been around a while . They know which buttons to push to influence decision-makers , &quot; says John Dinsdale , associate director for telecommunications at Dataquest . When the U.S. Justice_Department broke_up AT &amp; T a decade ago , it took_away AT &amp; T ' s last stranglehold on selling telephone equipment , the domestic market . The seven new regional phone-operating companies , once exclusively supplied by Western Electric , sought cheaper suppliers overseas . Newly emerging companies have also looked overseas for suppliers . McCaw Cellular , the cellular_phone giant in the process of being acquired by AT &amp; T , buys almost all_of its equipment from the Swedish company Eriksson . AT &amp; T , meanwhile , has faced largely closed markets overseas . Nevertheless , AT &amp; T and other U.S. companies like Motorola and Northern Telecom are making an aggressive foray_into the international market . As recently as seven years ago , AT &amp; T had only 100 employees overseas . Today it has 56 # 000 overseas employees . And it is learning to move fast . When Argentina wanted a cellular company that could quickly establish phone_services , it turned_to a consortium that included AT &amp; T , GTE and two local companies . The consortium signed a contract March 28 . By the end of May , by pulling_in 250 engineers from its operations worldwide , AT &amp; T had installed a $ 250-million cellular system accessible to 22 million potential customers . The system is expected to go_into commercial service soon and will offer many Argentines their first access to telephone_service . &quot; We ' re catching_up pretty quickly , &quot; says Dorf , the AT &amp; T official for the Caribbean and Latin_America . U.S. companies don ' t have the advantage of captive markets that European companies like Siemens and Alcatel do . But as markets gradually open , the U.S. companies ' experience operating in a competitive rather than a regulated market may give them an important advantage . &quot; Northern Telecom and AT &amp; T are the product of a deregulated market , &quot; says James Long , head of Northern Telecom ' s international operations . To be competitive , North_American companies have been forced to keep adding new features such_as 1-800 services , call_forwarding and conferencing that are not available in Europe or Japan . Much of this involves writing sophisticated software , an American strength . U.S. companies will also have an edge_in building next-generation broad-band networks for video on demand and other applications because of their early investment in this technology . AT &amp; T has won major multibillion-dollar contracts from Pacific Telesis and Bell Atlantic to build such systems . * And after years of watching in frustration as competitors won international contracts with the backing of their governments , U.S. companies are now receiving similar help . In May , AT &amp; T won a a $ 4-billion deal to build a modern network in Saudi_Arabia . Strong support from the Clinton_Administration helped to clinch the deal . When Motorola faced obstacles getting fair access to the Japanese market , U.S. trade negotiators intervened , assuring the company a major stake in a market expected to quintuple in seven years . U.S. companies are beginning to reap the harvest of such efforts . Northern Telecom ' s international sales last year accounted_for a quarter of its sales , up from just 8 % four years ago . Motorola has built or is in the process of installing 150 mobile systems in 18 Chinese provinces , establishing itself as a leader in the mobile area , says Tom Hinton , general_manager of Motorola ' s cellular operations in China . U.S. exports of telecommunications_equipment climbed 24 % last year to $ 9.7 billion , giving the nation a telecommunications trade surplus for the first time in 10 years . But while equipment sales are where the opportunities are today , in the long term it is the service_area that will have the greatest growth . Dataquest sees the services market growing to $ 680 billion in 1997 from about $ 500 billion last year . Most of that growth will come_in markets filled with acronyms such_as VANs ( value added networks ) , VPNs ( virtual private networks ) and ISDN ( Integrated Synchronous Digital Networks ) . While the market for POTS ( plain old telephone_service ) is likely to remain flat , the Yankee Group , a Boston-based research firm , expects that new areas involving sophisticated packages of data , voice and video communications to multinationals will more_than double in three years , making_it a $ 17-billion market . It is in this package market that America ' s strength is most apparent . The world ' s major players have broken_up into three teams , each centered around a market-savvy U.S. player . The MCI-British Telecom team has an early start , but AT &amp; T is quickly building_up a formidable alliance that could include dozens of large telecommunications players . Sprint ' s deal with the_French and German telephone_companies may_not go_through unless the phone markets are opened_up wider in France and Germany . * Among the newer and more aggressive faces in the international arena are America ' s regional telephone-operating companies . Pacific Telesis has stakes in cellular systems in Japan and Korea , two of the world ' s fastest-growing markets . Southwestern Bell and France Telecom have major stakes in Telmex , Mexico ' s successful phone_company . Bell Atlantic spent $ 1 billion for a 42 % share of Iusacell , a cellular operator in Mexico . US West has been among the most aggressive , investing $ 2.5 billion in cellular , cable and phone_systems in Russia , Britain , Hungary , France , Norway and Sweden . The company says its goal is to put_together the building_blocks for systems that can offer multimedia capabilities including wireless , telephone and entertainment , a goal that it is close to approaching in Britain . It is a model the company thinks may be appropriate for developing countries as well . The company has proposed to the Indian government a plan that would begin by offering basic telephone_service using easily installed cellular base stations . As wire lines are installed , the cellular_phone system would be moved farther out_to offer services to another population while wire line would take_over in its existing area . The idea is to ultimately have a full multimedia_system with video service , telephones and wireless . Experts agree that unlike other industries where it is often reasonable to use cheaper intermediate technology , in telecommunications it makes_sense to put_in the latest technology available . New digital switches are often the cheapest per subscriber and the easiest to maintain . &quot; They are going from the 19th Century to the 21st Century , &quot; says John Clarke , analyst for the London office of Daiwa Research Institute . &quot; They need top communications services. &quot; What Is It ? * tel-e-com-mu-ni-CA-tions n . 1 .
