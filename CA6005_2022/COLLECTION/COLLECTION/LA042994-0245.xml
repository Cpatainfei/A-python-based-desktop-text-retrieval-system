   <HEADLINE> TEAMSTERS , SHIPPERS REACH TENTATIVE PACT ; LABOR : DESPITE BITTER SPLIT , TWO KEY UNION FACTIONS PREDICT CONTRACT APPROVAL . SOME WORKERS COULD RETURN TO JOBS TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Teamsters union and major trucking firms reached a tentative agreement late Thursday on a labor_contract expected to end a 23-day-old strike that has idled roughly 70 # 000 freight workers nationally . Some drivers and dockworkers could return to their jobs as soon as today . Officials of the Teamsters bitterly split over whether the proposed settlement marked a victory for management or the union . But the two key union factions predicted that members will approve the pact , in part because of economic pressure on the unionized trucking_industry . The strike has been the nation ' s biggest since the Communications Workers of America walked_out on AT &amp; T in 1986 and the first by the Teamsters since the trucking_industry was deregulated in the 1980s . Yet the walkout , while hurting some businesses , has served as a reminder of how much the union ' s influence has waned since 1979 , when a Teamsters strike strangled commerce . Teamsters President Ron Carey claimed a big win on what he called the chief issue in the contract dispute : a bid by the trucking_companies involved in the negotiations to add lower-paid , three-hour-a-day workers who would receive no health or pension benefits . Under the tentative agreement , union officials said , no such employees could be hired . Still , critics of Carey , called the agreement &quot; concessionary. &quot; They noted that while the pact thwarted management ' s proposal for the three-hour-a-day part-timers , it will permit greater use of &quot; casual &quot; laborers who work intermittently and receive less than the standard Teamsters pay . In addition , critics faulted Carey ' s negotiators for giving_up the right to strike over grievances and for allowing more freight to be shipped by rail . R.V. Durham , a North Carolina Teamsters leader whom Carey defeated in the union ' s presidential 1991 election , said Carey &quot; should have stayed_at the bargaining table and fought for a contract that protects the members ' job security . Now many members face layoffs as the carriers battle to win freight back from the competition. &quot; Details of the four-year agreement will be unveiled today to representatives of 230 Teamsters freight locals . Although it will take about a month for the members to vote , strikers will return to work , and the industry could be in_full_swing as soon as Saturday . Officials of Trucking Management Inc. , the group representing most of the 22 companies subject_to the Teamsters contract , released a brief statement lauding the settlement , saying it will make the companies more competitive while improving employees ' wages , benefits and job security . Union sources said the pact would boost the average Teamster ' s base pay by about 8 % over the four years of the contract , lifting it to about $ 18.35 an hour . Officials close to Carey said the union also won &quot; the largest employer contributions ever &quot; for freight workers ' pensions and health_care coverage . Both sides were under stiff pressure to reach a settlement . For the union , the walkout was a severe drain on its strike fund , which was already suffering in the wake of the membership ' s recent rejection of a dues increase . The trucking firms have been badly hurt since the early 1980s by the emergence of non-union companies that operate at lower costs and by other competition . In fact , one of the 23 companies originally involved in the talks went_out of business after the strike began . Two more carriers signed &quot; me-too &quot; agreements allowing them to bring their union employees back to work but requiring them to honor whatever contract settlement is reached .</TEXT>
