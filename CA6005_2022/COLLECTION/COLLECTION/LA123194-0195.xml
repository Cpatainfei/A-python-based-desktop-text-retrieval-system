   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; NO PAST , BUT HOPE FOR A FUTURE ; A BRAIN INJURY TOOK AWAY KARINE PIRE ' S ABILITY TO REMEMBER THINGS FOR MORE THAN 10 MINUTES . BUT HER MOTHER ' S DEVOTION , AND RESEARCHERS ' QUEST FOR THE SECRETS OF MEMORY , ARE OPENING NEW DOORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Karine Pire cooks lunch in the apartment she shares with her mother , following elaborate lists tacked up all_over the kitchen : open oven . . . put breaded filets in . . . close oven . She has rolled the linens into shiny sunflower napkin_rings , smoothed down the place_mat corners and , after squinting at a diagram of the cabinet contents , found the dishes . Over lunch , Pire talks_about why she does not often dream , why she cannot smell the strong Belgian coffee brewing four feet away . &quot; I feel love , I think , yes , &quot; she says , but a flicker of doubt passes like a cloud_over her face . After dessert , she positions me for a Polaroid picture , under which she writes &quot; Nancy &quot; so she won ' t forget me . Then , she hugs me goodby . The next day , she has no idea who I am . Pire has no memory , as we understand it . She lives her life in present_tense . The past for her is usually about 10 minutes long , and she is only now , at 28 , able to start planning for a future . An accident eight years ago robbed her brain of oxygen for several minutes , leaving Pire in a fragmented existence of moments strung together without any perceived relation_to one another . Fluent in three languages , she cannot remember to get_out of the bathtub after an hour . She has learned to remember her route to school , but after writing an effusive thank-you note to her teacher , she asks the teacher to deliver it to herself . Hoping to help herself and others , she has worked for seven years with UC Irvine researchers whose interest in new ways to recall previously lost information -- and their obvious fondness for her -- have remarkably improved Pire ' s ability to live more productively . &quot; It ' s very courageous , &quot; said Bonnie Olsen , a Ph.D. in clinical_psychology working_at UC Irvine ' s Memory and Cognitive Disorders Clinic . Along with her husband , clinic Director Arnold Starr , Olsen has worked with Pire since her mother pleaded for their help in 1987 . &quot; Karine is a remarkable human being . Most people with the same injuries and situation would not be able to accomplish what she ' s accomplished . She ' s moved mountains , &quot; Olsen said . Given that Pire ' s primary memory engine has blown_out , there are many things she still cannot feel or do . How memory and emotion are linked is a murky subject still being explored by researchers . Pire ' s condition provokes all_the big questions : To what depth can someone feel emotions without the memory that contributes to trusting another person ? Without any memory of mistakes , how does one learn ? Without pain , what happens to the soul ? &quot; I think she has feelings for me and the others she has known for awhile , &quot; Olsen said , &quot; but it takes a loooong time , and . . . how that happens is speculation that I sort of extrapolate based on what I know of human_relationships and memory and what I see of Karine . It ' s of interest and poignancy because we ' ve come_to care a great_deal for her as a person . But who knows ? Who knows ? &quot; A Mother ' s Hope In her sunny , one-bedroom apartment , Pire ' s weeks are guided by a large calendar on the wall , her hours by an electronic voice reminder . She uses the device , which can be programmed to announce reminders such_as &quot; take medicine , &quot; because she lacks an internal voice to prompt herself . A student at Coastline Community_College ' s Traumatic Head Injury program not far from her home , Pire is learning the basics of self-sufficiency -- from how to concentrate to writing a resume . Colette Pire-Vermeulen , 60 , has fashioned this ordered world knowing that she will not live forever to mother Karine . Through trial_and_error she has created an elaborately detailed system of cue cards to help her daughter navigate the everyday drills of laundry , cooking , getting_to the bus and playing the VCR . She is essentially re-raising her daughter , teaching her for the second time to take_care of herself . With her cherubic face and dark wavy bob usually pulled behind a headband , Karine is girlish-looking in jeans , coordinating cardigans and loafers . Her gestures sometimes seem exaggerated because they are slow . On a recent day , her silver-haired mother sat across from her , eager to share their secrets with a visitor . Although French is their native language , good manners have them speaking mostly English , despite Colette ' s having learned it only after arriving here . Karine plays teacher , correcting her mother ' s English and translating . Cooking for guests is Karine ' s link to people , or rather , the link Colette has created for Karine with people . &quot; Karine does not always tell people , ' You are important to me , ' but if she cooks , that ' s how she says that , &quot; Colette explains . &quot; This is important for her . . . . You cannot just be without people . That is not living. &quot; Into the Abyss Born in Vietnam and orphaned in the war , Karine was brought_to Belgium in 1968 by Colette and her late husband , Milou , who worked as a liaison between researchers and an American drug_company . They had watched the war play_out on TV in their comfortable Brussels apartment and decided to provide a home for an abandoned child . It took two years of paperwork , but the Pires finally adopted Karine . A year later they adopted Nathalie , now 26 , who also had been orphaned in Vietnam . Karine was a bookish girl , serene and playful , her mother says . She was earning good grades at the university in Brussels , studying to be a translator . She had a serious boyfriend and dreams of a future with him . At 21 , Karine developed mononucleosis , low blood_pressure and toxemia . After a_few weeks , she became groggy and her parents rushed her to the hospital emergency_room . By the time they arrived , Karine had lapsed into a coma , and her brain was without oxygen for as much as five minutes , Starr said . &quot; She was in a coma for several weeks . She probably had an overdose of barbiturates , &quot; he said . &quot; But nothing points to this being a suicide attempt. &quot; Her father had been prescribed barbiturates , which were kept_in the bathroom medicine_cabinet . Some of the researchers who work with Karine speculate that she had been accidentally taking these drugs instead of_her_own medicine . For three months , Karine was in the hospital . Her motor skills were crippled by brain damage . She spent long hours in physical_therapy , swimming and exercising to regain some of her agility . Three months later she began outpatient therapy . After a year , doctors sat_down with the family . It was , they said , as_good_as it would get . Colette was furious , her husband devastated but resigned . &quot; In the end , we have no . . . &quot; Colette searches for the right words in English , until Karine steps_in and translates . &quot; In Belgium , my recuperation was at the maximum , &quot; she says confidently . &quot; She was living from moment to moment , &quot; Colette says . &quot; I ' d say , ' Karine , drink your tea. ' She ' d drink the tea . And then she would forget to keep drinking the tea . She had no expression . Sometime , she could laugh , see someone do something , but not very much. &quot; The Sunrise In early 1987 , about the time her mother felt end-of-her-rope frustration over what to do with her , a family friend living_in Orange County mentioned Karine ' s predicament to Starr . He was treating the friend ' s mother for Alzheimer ' s disease . &quot; Eclectic in my interests , &quot; Starr now says with a grin , he offered to help . And the sun came_up for the first time in a year for Colette . &quot; I remember the most striking thing was when she wrote to tell me she ' d taught her daughter how to use the computer , &quot; Starr said , shaking his head slightly at the incongruity of someone who had &quot; profound amnesia &quot; learning Word Perfect . In September , 1987 , mother and daughter flew from Belgium to meet with the researcher . Seeing that Karine had twitches and spasms , Starr prescribed medication used for Parkinson ' s disease , a central_nervous_system disorder that causes similar symptoms . The drugs worked . Starr asked_for a volunteer to work with Karine during her visits to the United States . Olsen , who had spent a decade as an occupational therapist with the memory disorders team and was studying for her Ph.D. , jumped at the chance . &quot; When I met Karine in 1988 , she was inert , &quot; Olsen recalled . &quot; She would answer direct questioning with , ' I don ' t know. ' That was about it. &quot; Starr also signed_up Elizabeth Parker , a neuropsychologist and adjunct professor of neurology and neurosurgery at UC Irvine . Parker , also a clinical professor at USC , had specialized in research into alcoholism-induced memory_loss for the National Institutes of Health . Parker , who like the others waived any fees , tested Pire to gauge her thinking and perception . &quot; After the coma , she remembered Spanish , but she couldn ' t remember her life , or anything after the age of 12 , &quot; Parker said . &quot; She was pretty much a black hole. &quot; One drill to measure her memory for learning was revealing : A record_player turntable has a dime on it . The task is to place a detachable turntable arm on the dime and keep it there as the turntable circles ; a machine measures the speed and success rate . A day after she first tried the test , Karine was asked if she had ever used the turntable . No . Had she ever seen it before ? No . But without instructions , she picked_up the arm , poised for the test . Even though she did not remember learning the information , she had . There were other hints that information was seeping in . The Key The researchers were most intrigued by Karine ' s inability to smell because for years it has been suspected -- not proved -- that memory and smell are linked . The areas of the brain that support their functions are adjacent . In the summer of 1988 , Olsen was studying in England and Starr suggested that they visit Karine at her home_in Brussels . Olsen was still interested in Karine ' s lack of smell perception . So for three days , 10 hours each day , they did test after test -- the same ones Parker had done , including one scratch and sniff : &quot; Was it just citrus she couldn ' t smell ? Or was she not familiar_with the smell because they don ' t have citrus in Belgium ? Or was it a language problem , where she didn ' t remember the word for a certain smell ? Or was it that she had lost the memory of that smell ? We didn ' t know , &quot; Olsen said . Karine had been using a pencil to scratch and reveal the scents , but was unable to recognize any of them . Olsen decided that the problem might be that she was not removing enough coating to release an aroma . So Olsen got a room key that Karine could use to scratch harder . Still nothing . The next day , Olsen asked her , &quot; Have you ever done this scratch and sniff exercise ? &quot; Karine shook her head no . But when they started the tests and Olsen picked_up the pencil , Karine picked_up the key . In that moment , Olsen felt a spark of hope that Karine ' s whole life could change . And Colette started to cry with relief . &quot; It told us there was something accessible in Karine that would allow her to learn , &quot; Olsen said . &quot; She didn ' t remember that she knew something , but she had learned it . that ' s when I knew we were_on to something. &quot; The Lemon Squares During the researchers ' visit to Brussels , Karine made an elaborate dinner for them and her family . During the meal , her father suffered a heart_attack , and was rushed to the hospital . She does not remember the dinner , but she does recall her father ' s brush with death . The more traumatic or compelling the circumstance , the more likely a person is to encode and file that memory , the researchers said . That summer , Olsen said to Colette , &quot; Let ' s just try , let ' s just see what we can do &quot; with cooking . Recipes were a series of steps , and Karine apparently was able to learn or recall information that she learned in steps . In 1989 , Karine and Colette made two visits to Orange County . Most of the time , Karine was cooking . In Olsen ' s Laguna Beach home , she made lemon squares for days on end . Each morning , the ingredients were listed on cards , the steps to make them spelled_out exhaustively : Preheat the oven to 350 degrees . Get_out a mixing bowl . Take box of cake_mix out of the cupboard , open the top and pour the contents of the bag into the bowl . Throw the box_in the trash . Take_out a measuring cup and a box of sugar from the cupboard , set it on the counter , open the top of the box . . . &quot; It can take a loooong time for Karine to make something , &quot; Colette says with a twinkle in her eye . Each morning , Olsen would ask : Do you remember baking something yesterday ? No . Do you remember what you baked with ? No . OK , if you were to bake lemon squares , what do you think some of the ingredients would be ? Pire would remember half the ingredients . And how do you think you might go_about preparing lemon squares ? She would list more of the steps each day . Although Olsen never wanted to look_at lemon squares again after that , the exercise told her that even though Karine had very little memory , she could learn things anyway . &quot; What is so important to remember , &quot; Parker said , is &quot; that she ( could have ) been relegated to the back wards of an institution and the family was told , ' Nothing can be done. ' &quot; The Mind ' s Mysteries Although there is disagreement and uncertainty over how memory works , the Irvine researchers subscribe_to a theory developed by Canadian Endel Tulving : There are at least three basic memory systems . The first is episodic , which is what most of us consider to be our memory . This is the collection of events , thoughts and feelings we accumulate through life . It requires a conscious effort and becomes part of our self-awareness . The second system is semantic , that pool of knowledge about the world and ourselves that we acquire through life but don ' t necessarily know how , like the spelling of a word . Also called learned information , it is not necessarily related to episodic_memory . The third system is procedural , and it consists_of information that is gathered_in a more primitive way . A baby throws a toy , it hits the wall and lands , a parent fetches it and returns it . After the infant does this repeatedly , the information is remembered . This is now the main memory engine Karine uses , the researchers think . They figured that if step-by-step cooking worked , she might be able to learn other things the same way . Parker and Olsen would come_up with a theory , and Colette would apply it , step by step , to an everyday task . Constant observation and attention to Karine as she performed these tasks was critical . Once she learned an error , it was very difficult to unlearn . So her mother would take the learning-by-steps concept and apply it to everything . It took them two years to get_the_hang of it . Now , the system is constantly evolving as Karine acquires skills . As this happens , Olsen says , Karine becomes more confident , and she has developed poise and budding self-identity . Finally , a Future On a late fall morning , I visited Colette and Karine in their apartment . They were excited that a reporter would write_about them , and they wanted parents of the brain-injured to be familiar_with the community services that Colette has learned about the hard way -- through persistence . Karine and her mother moved here three years ago so that Karine could attend Coastline ' s Traumatic Head Injury program . Of her daughter ' s transformation , Colette said simply , &quot; To come from this nothing to now , it is truly something . Not many people know about this program , which Bonnie told us about. &quot; Karine -- who always smiles when she talks , her chin thrust upward like a boastful child -- said her three years of classes have been &quot; a big change . I graduate in June . That is the best. &quot; What the Coastline program has given her is spelled_out in a February paper she wrote_on her computer , its title -- &quot; How the college has Interfered in My Life &quot; -- translated from French . She wrote : &quot; I have more independence . I have found back my character . I have an opened mind . I can exchange my ideas , my opinions with other persons . All this occurred thanks to the Interact Course. &quot; The computer class , she said , gave her &quot; more memorization ( with some games ) . I write every evening what I have done during the day ( with my own computer at_home ) . Manual_dexterity . Acceptation of all my errors ( with no argue ) . &quot; And her conclusions : &quot; The influence of the school had played a big part in my evolution and today I plan to create a newspaper for head-injur ( ed ) in my country . With some information from specialist peoples , and a great part written by head injur ( ed ) themselves ( feeling , living , network , easy recipes ) . &quot; She has step-by-step lists for almost every key activity in her daily routine . They are laminated so she can mark_off completed tasks , then wipe them clean for reuse . Two days a week she does banking and marketing . On one recent trip to the grocery_store , she carried a detailed list of provisions and studied it repeatedly as she shepherded her cart through the aisles . She was slow , but she made no mistakes , even recognizing Laughing Cow cheese from Belgium . A half-hour after we parked , she could not find the car . Three times a week , she spends afternoons at the Dayle McIntosh Center ' s Clubhouse in Orange . It is a nonprofit program where she is acquiring job skills and socializing at dinners and dances . After graduation and her return to Belgium next summer , Karine will live_in her own flat in Brussels , purchased with savings her father left when he died two years ago . Belgian public benefits will help as well , and most of her bill payments will be electronically withdrawn by creditors . All of her drawer knobs will be color-coded : blue for sweaters , yellow for writing utensils . Her mother will live_in an apartment down the hall . Karine plans to work_at least part time ; cooking , errands and personal preparations take most of a morning . She can get herself to and from the bus_stop , pack her own clothes for a vacation and secure her apartment before leaving . She has already volunteered at a peace organization and a day-care center . &quot; It is always important for the work , even if it is something volunteer , &quot; her mother said . &quot; Doing something , having a purpose , it is so good for Karine. &quot; Flying Solo The medical_community generally holds that recovery from a brain injury peaks at one year . Karine is in her eighth . &quot; To have this girl function in society with a severe memory deficiency &quot; is very special , Starr said . &quot; She needs a lot of support now , but I suspect in 10 years she ' ll be fairly independent . But then we all need a bit of help -- from bosses , from parents , from spouses , &quot; he said with a wink . So what is the value to society of having a person perform the functions of life without necessarily feeling the emotions that accompany them ? &quot; You can write people off like this and say they are complete vegetables or get great disability ( benefits for them ) , &quot; Parker said . &quot; But here is someone useful and not locked_up like an animal . To say she will ever be completely independent , I think that ' s her mother ' s fantasy . . . . But to me this is a story of hope , to me it ' s the way that memory theory can be useful to others , and how what we learn from Karine can help others if they apply it. &quot; Half a_million Americans each year suffer some form of brain injury -- from car wrecks or heart_attacks to strokes -- and 90 # 000 suffer permanent brain damage . Memory_loss is a common result . What makes Karine ' s case remarkable is her comeback , and the uncanny way that fate brought her to the researchers . Had her friend not been Starr ' s patient , had her mother not crusaded to get her help and her family not had the means to fly her here , she might still be staring into space . Will Karine ever feel the way someone with an undamaged memory can ? &quot; Who we are today are all_the events we had up_to today , &quot; Olsen said . &quot; Without the past you don ' t have a future . So you are not only static , you just don ' t care . She doesn ' t care about 10 minutes from now. &quot; But there are signs of progress . Typically , Karine would make a remark such_as , &quot; Orange_trees are so pretty , &quot; said Olsen , who spends several days a month with her . The other day , she said , &quot; I ' d really like to buy an orange_tree for the patio. &quot; &quot; That looking_into the future , the reflection , it ' s not clear where it is coming from , &quot; Olsen said . &quot; But to have a sense of self one needs to be able to reflect . . . . It was a subtle emerging of a personhood. &quot; More on Science * From the secrets of DNA to volcanoes on Venus , the TimesLink on-line service has a wide-ranging collection of articles on the sciences .
