   <HEADLINE> PARENTING ; FINDING OUTLETS FOR ANGER ; SPECIALISTS SAY YOUTHFUL OUTBURSTS OF AGGRESSION ARE NORMAL . BUT DEALING WITH THEM EFFECTIVELY IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR AND MUST BE TAUGHT TO CHILDREN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Of all_the challenges of parenting , dealing with a child ' s bursts of aggression can be especially daunting . Moments of pure , unadulterated anger may leave grown-ups wondering if their child is treading_on dangerous psychological turf , or just exhibiting a normal expression of emotion . Lynne Weinberg , a staff psychologist at the San Fernando Valley Child Guidance Clinic in Panorama City , says it is not at all uncommon for children , up_to the age of 5 or 6 , to exhibit some physical aggression , typically through hitting and angry outbursts . &quot; All kids are going_to go_through periods when they ' re angry , &quot; she said . &quot; It doesn ' t mean they are going_to grow_up to be criminals. &quot; Carol Lambert , director of the Woodland Village School , an Agoura preschool that enrolls children from 6 weeks old through kindergarten-age , agrees that it is natural for children to engage in some kind of aggressive behavior , such_as pushing another child in an effort to be first in_line , or pinching or hitting someone in frustration . * But while anger is normal , experts say , dealing with it effectively is a learned behavior and must be taught to children as well as demonstrated by parents . Parents can be particularly effective in coaching children through an angry moment , and also in providing outlets for rage : athletics , outdoor time -- even a punching_bag . &quot; A lot of kids these days spend a lot of time in school , in the car , without many outlets . Sports teams , outside time , free_time -- these are important , &quot; said Weinberg . When a child is hurting or threatening someone or damaging property , she advised , the first thing parents should do is to stop the particular act of aggression . After Mom or Dad has helped to subdue the child by using a calm , quiet tone_of_voice , and perhaps a timeout , the two can discuss what triggered the anger . The parent can then suggest reasonable outlets to use in the future -- such_as hitting a pillow or seeking adult remediation -- and can help the child find words to express his or her feelings . Parents can also assist children in learning to recognize signs that they ' re getting angry . Their own loud voice or clenched fists , for example , might suggest that it ' s time to pull_away , use words to communicate their feelings , or get help from an adult , Weinberg said . * According to Weinberg , some parents take a child ' s aggression personally ; they see it as a sign of a lack of respect , or they think it ' s directed at them , or that it indicates that they have made some major parenting mistake , said Weinberg . For adults who grew_up with parents who yelled at or hit them , the natural reaction to a child ' s aggression may be to yell or to spank , which serves only to recycle anger and upset everyone more , she advised . Lambert has found that it helps for parents to tell children that there is nothing bad about feeling angry , as long as they find ways to handle the emotion without hurting others . Asking children to evaluate angry episodes and consider other ways they could have handled themselves also helps because it illuminates future options . Some youngsters need to be told that it is all_right to ask_for a grown-up ' s intervention . Others benefit from learning appropriate responses : &quot; I won ' t play with you if you throw sand in my face again , &quot; or , &quot; If you hit me , I ' ll get the teacher. &quot; Weinberg encourages parents to insist that a child make restitution if someone is hurt or something is broken . Appropriate action might include apologizing , or fixing or paying_for broken property . * While occasional outbursts of anger are no cause for alarm , recurrent aggression can be a sign of other problems , according to David Paster , an Encino-based child psychiatrist . &quot; Putting a child into a group ( day-care ) setting too early is an invitation to be aggressive , &quot; Paster said . Angry outbursts might also signal depression , attention-deficit disorders , violence at_home or loneliness . Paster suggests that parents seek counseling if a child destroys property , threatens others with weapons or is self-destructive . One Newbury Park mother of two preschool boys suspects that her children ' s long days in child_care contributed to her 5-year-old ' s aggression at preschool . &quot; He would knock the desk over , chase a teacher with a pencil -- whatever it took_to get the teachers to call me and have me take him home , &quot; said Laurie , who asked that her last_name not be used . * When Laurie analyzed her son ' s typical day , she realized that his behavior may have been caused by his rugged schedule . She would wake him up at 6:10 a.m. every weekday , feed him breakfast in the car and drop him off at his Agoura preschool by 6:30 . After work , she would pick him up and go_to the gym , where he would again be in child_care , and then return home for a quick dinner , bath and bedtime . &quot; He was aggressive to get attention -- and it worked , &quot; said Laurie . Now that she has rearranged her schedule and made more time to be with him , she said , his aggression is less intense .</TEXT>
