   <HEADLINE> MORNING BRIEFING : BARKLEY CAUTIONS YOUNG RIVALS TO PLAY WELL FIRST , TAUNT LATER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Phoenix Sun star Charles Barkley believes an NBA player must pay his dues before taunting opponents . He is annoyed by what he has heard from young Golden State players during the best-of-five playoff series , which Phoenix leads , 2-0 . &quot; I waited until I became a very good player before I talked trash , probably four or five years , &quot; Barkley told the Arizona Republic . * Add Suns : Bruce Jenkins of the San Francisco Chronicle writes that former Laker A.C. Green , now with the Suns , seems to get a little nastier on the court each year . Warrior guard Latrell Sprewell agrees . &quot; He ' s just a dirty player , &quot; Sprewell told Jenkins . &quot; He throws elbows , takes cheap shots . I ' ve seen it on film , and now I ' m seeing it on the court . Nothing new . It ' s not like somebody just told us. &quot; * Trivia time : Which team has the best winning percentage in NBA playoff_games ? * Forgotten : Dan Shaughnessy in the Boston Globe on the Celtics ' disappointing season : &quot; No more Cheers for Boston basketball . The Garden now is where you go_to play when nobody knows your name. &quot; * Tonya ' s gig : Tonya Harding wasn ' t invited to the White_House along with other Olympic athletes recently , but her signature is worth something -- like $ 35 . that ' s what she charged in Portland at a show and sale for collectors . A few paid $ 15 for a signature on a 3 x 5 index card , but most waited for a signed 8 x 10 glossy photo . * Robinson ' s legacy : More on standout basketball-track athletes . UCLA ' s Jackie Robinson fits that category -- and more . Robinson was a Pacific Coast Conference Southern Division first_team player in basketball in 1940 , the same year he won the NCAA long_jump championship . He was also an accomplished athlete in football and baseball at UCLA . * Last word ? Update on the NFL draft day argument between ESPN ' s Mel Kiper Jr . and General_Manager Bill Tobin of the Indianapolis Colts : &quot; Within 24 hours after all that happened , 21 of the teams in the league had sent faxes to our office congratulating me for what happened , &quot; Tobin told Will McDonough of the Boston Globe . &quot; I think I just said what other teams felt . This guy has no credentials to rip people the way he does on that show and get_away with it. &quot; * Trivia answer : The Lakers , with a winning percentage of . 598 , . 05 ahead of the Boston Celtics . * Quotebook : Minnesota Twin slugger Kent Hrbek , when asked if there has been any positive sign_in his team ' s terrible play this season : &quot; The plane hasn ' t crashed. &quot; MAL FLORENCE</TEXT>
