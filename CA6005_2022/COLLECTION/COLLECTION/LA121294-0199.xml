   <HEADLINE> DELORS DECLINES TO SEEK FRENCH PRESIDENCY ; EUROPE : OUTGOING EU OFFICIAL WAS MOST POPULAR POTENTIAL CANDIDATE ON THE LEFT . DECISION PAVES WAY FOR A CONTENTIOUS BATTLE BETWEEN CONSERVATIVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite polls showing him the clear favorite for the_French presidency , Jacques Delors stunned the nation Sunday night by announcing that he will not run to succeed retiring President Francois Mitterrand in elections next year . The decision by Delors -- the 69-year-old president of the European Union Executive Commission and , like Mitterrand , a Socialist -- took the most popular potential candidate on the left out of the running . It also set the stage for a nasty fight between two conservative contenders , Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur and Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac , both members of the Rally for the Republic party . The two longtime friends are not on speaking terms these days . Delors ' announcement , made nearly 45 minutes into a live interview on France ' s most popular current affairs program , ended a months-long Socialist_Party effort to draft him for the April elections . It was a campaign that Delors , who will step_down next month as EU leader , had not discouraged . &quot; It wasn ' t an easy decision to take , &quot; Delors said , and he cited &quot; lots of personal reasons. &quot; &quot; I ' ve worked for 50 years , and in these conditions it ' s more reasonable to envisage a lifestyle more balanced between reflection and action , &quot; he said . His wife was known to be lobbying against a presidential try . Delors , often called &quot; Mr. Europe , &quot; is widely respected on the Continent . During his 10 years as head of the EU ' s Executive Commission , internal trade_barriers in Western Europe have been significantly lowered and the region has made important strides toward political and economic unity . Other , more practical political considerations also played a role in his decision . As a Socialist president with a right-wing National Assembly , he would have had his ability to lead the country severely restricted . And he acknowledged Sunday that even if he dissolved the Assembly , new elections probably would result in another strong rightist majority . Now the seat held for 13 1 / 2 years by Mitterrand , who is 78 and has prostate cancer , is almost certain to go_to someone on the right . Chirac already has announced his intention to run . Although Balladur has not formally declared himself a candidate , he leads Chirac in the polls and is expected to announce soon . Other right-wing candidates might also be drawn into the race . The first round of elections is scheduled for April 23 , with the two top finishers squaring_off May 7 . The battle between Chirac and Balladur has fascinated French voters and sharply divided the right-wing coalition that swept to power in the National Assembly during a decisive victory in 1993 . When the right took power , Chirac and other party leaders settled_on Balladur , a little-known moderate , to keep the prime_minister ' s seat warm until the presidential elections . Chirac has said there was a gentleman ' s agreement that Balladur would then step aside for his friend . But Balladur turned_out to be a popular prime_minister in his own_right , earning a reputation as a thoughtful , soft-spoken leader willing to listen to his critics . Until talk_of a Delors candidacy surfaced , he held a strong lead in most polls . On the other hand , Chirac , a former prime_minister , is saddled with an Old_Guard image at a time when French voters are seeking new leaders . And his bombastic style is likely to hurt him against the even-tempered Balladur . Socialist_Party leaders said Sunday that they will choose their candidate next month . Among those mentioned as possible candidates are Lionel Jospin , a former eduction minister , and Jack Lang , a former culture minister .</TEXT>
