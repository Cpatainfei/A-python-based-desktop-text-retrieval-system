   <HEADLINE> CHEMICAL SPILL THREAT SEEN IN CALIFORNIA ; ENVIRONMENT : STUDY SAYS STATE LEADS NATION IN ACCIDENTS THAT RELEASED HAZARDOUS MATERIALS . OFFICIALS SAY FIGURES ARE MISLEADING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California leads the nation in industrial accidents that released hazardous chemicals , according to a study provided Thursday by two environmental advocacy groups that suggested many of the nation ' s chemical plants are catastrophes waiting to happen . Nearly 11 chemical spills , leaks or fires occur each day in the state , which had 4 # 820 accidents in a wide range of industries between 1988 and 1992 , said the report by the National Environmental Law Center and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group . More_than 1 # 200 of the 34 # 500 accidents reported nationwide to the federal Environmental Protection Agency in those five years occurred in Los Angeles County , the report said . Statewide , 409 accidents involved deaths , injuries or evacuations during the five years , the data showed . State officials said California ' s top ranking in the study is misleading . &quot; This state has 12 % of the nation ' s population . I ' d be surprised if we weren ' t ranked No . 1 , &quot; said Dan Pellissier , a spokesman for the California Environmental Protection Agency . &quot; We also have stronger reporting requirements than any other state. &quot; In releasing the report , Hillel Gray , policy director for the Environmental Law Center and a co-author of the report , said the nation ' s environment &quot; is subjected_to a daily barrage of accidents involving toxic chemicals that cause cancer , birth_defects , reproductive disorders and ecological damage . It ' s not enough to contain the spills and put_out the fires . We need to prevent accidents in the first place. &quot; Environmentalists and worker-safety advocates blamed executives of the oil and chemical_industries for the lion ' s share of the accidents , saying that they have been too slow in devising ways to shield employees and communities from the risks of hazardous materials . Industrial programs concentrate almost exclusively on reactive , &quot; Band-Aid &quot; solutions rather than proactive prevention , Gray said . &quot; The underlying problem is that the production systems are , intrinsically , a hazard , &quot; he said . Pellissier said prevention of accidental spills is still a high priority for the California EPA but that &quot; there ' s always room for improvement. &quot; Industry officials played_down the significance of the report ' s figures . &quot; Do they represent a broad-scale disregard for safety ? I don ' t think so , &quot; said Rod Spackman , a spokesman for the Chevron Inc. refinery in El Segundo . The plant , which once used hazardous coolants , has switched to safer chemicals in the last three years , Spackman said . The report said accidents have released more_than 680 million pounds of toxic chemicals , including 84 million pounds of chlorine , a highly acidic chemical used in water-treatment plants and paper factories , and 39 million pounds of sulfuric_acid . Companies should incorporate more safety procedures into the handling of hazardous materials and use alternative chemicals to prevent accidents , the two groups said . Gray said he hopes that the study will counteract a fierce lobbying effort by chemical companies seeking to delay more stringent EPA safety rules . To compile data for the study , researchers combed the EPA ' s Emergency Response Notification database , which covers industrial and transportation-related accidents . The report may greatly understate the scope of the problem of chemical accidents , its authors said , because the database only includes spills and disasters reported to the federal_government . Chemical companies or industrial workers sometimes hide accidents for fear of serious penalties , according to environmentalists and workers . &quot; People get injured and don ' t even know it , &quot; said Henry Jones , a safety representative for British Petroleum Co . &quot; They ' ll have an acute reaction , but they ' ve been_on the job so_long they accept it as part of the job. &quot; Jones , who has served as a technician at his company ' s plant outside Philadelphia , said failures of high-tech safety mechanisms are not unusual .</TEXT>
