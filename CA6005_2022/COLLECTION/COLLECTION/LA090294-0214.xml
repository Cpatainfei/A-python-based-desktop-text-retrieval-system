   <HEADLINE> OC HIGH : STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS ; TARGETING TEEN NEEDS IN HEALTH , PREVENTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pediatricians attend_to young children ; obstetricians care_for pregnant women , and internists treat adults . Yet the health issues of teen-agers are significantly different from those of children and adults . &quot; Health_care_providers need to monitor the progress of puberty , &quot; says Gail B . Slap , co-author with Martha M . Jablow of &quot; Teenage Health_Care &quot; ( Pocket Books , $ 14 ) , a comprehensive family guide for the preteen to young adult years . Slap is the director of Adolescent Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School_of_Medicine and the Children ' s Hospital of Philadelphia . She says that as teen-agers ' medical needs change and they become increasingly uncomfortable with their pediatricians , they often fall_out of care . With this in mind , Slap wrote &quot; Teenage Health_Care &quot; as a reference for both teens and their parents , stressing prevention as a main theme . The last part of the book can be read as a problem arises . Issues covered include knee pain , low blood_count and thyroid conditions . Slap suggests that parents and teens read the first_half of the 530-page book , which focuses_on such issues as nutrition , dealing with chronic conditions and sexual identity , at their leisure and when an illness is not present . She hopes that an open discussion will ensue . &quot; There is a tendency for parents to look the other way when confronted about a subject they feel less comfortable with , &quot; Slap says . &quot; Communication is the biggest problem between parents and teens. &quot; She maintains that although her book is reassuring and dispenses a great_deal of information , it does so without arriving_at a diagnosis or offering a treatment . &quot; The book hopefully increases awareness about a problem which exists and lays_out a system of where to go_for help and how to determine if the doctor is the right one. &quot; * While Slap says teens should learn to become savvy health-care consumers , she cites numerous barriers in achieving that goal . Among them : payment , consent and confidentiality , age-appropriate services , sociocultural barriers and availability of services . &quot; Teens need visible , accessible , attractive health-care providers who can anticipate their concerns , &quot; Slap says . &quot; The provider should use the appropriate language and be understandable without talking_down . Lack of respect is the issue which hurts teens the most . They are working hard to become adults , and if they aren ' t respected , they become hurt and shut down. &quot; Slap says doctors who are interested in the field of adolescent medicine are either setting_up practices strictly for teens or putting hours aside on weekends and evenings for this age_group . &quot; I don ' t believe that every teen needs a specialist for his or her age_group . But I think that a family practitioner or intern should know the basics ; it should be part of the core education , &quot; Slap says . &quot; Studies have shown that it isn ' t important whether a girl sees a woman doctor or a boy sees a man . The imperative issue is that the doctor ( be ) someone to be trusted , is easy to relate to and will remain confidential. &quot;</TEXT>
