   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 ; WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / GROUP E PREVIEW ; SOME TOUGH IRISHMEN ; PLAYERS AREN ' T AFRAID TO TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR HANDS ON THE FIELD , BUT THEY MIGHT BE AFRAID OF BIG JACK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The coach lives in the center of a storm , criticized for his harsh treatment of players , chided for poor-mouthing his team , revered or despised but never ignored . The players are smart , hard-working , selfless , forced to give_up their individualism for the good of the unit . The fans are loud , sometimes obnoxious , often partying from the morning of the game until the morning after . Notre Dame football ? No , we ' re talking_about the real fighting Irish . Introducing Ireland ' s promising World Cup soccer team . Please , shake their hands , they could be_on the verge of making history . Then duck . Fresh from a shocking victory over defending champion Germany in Hanover -- the Germans ' first loss at that home field in 56 years -- the_Irish are ready to bruise their way to stardom in just their second World Cup appearance . &quot; Oh , we don ' t actually tackle the other guys , not like your American_football , &quot; protested hard-hitting midfielder Steve Staunton during a phone interview from Dublin . &quot; All we do is close the other guys down . We don ' t knock them down , we close them down. &quot; Then why do European soccer observers talk_about this team as if it were the Dallas Cowboy defense ? Why , when asked about the_Irish offense , do experts change the subject_to hitting and intimidating ? And exactly what are all_the Irish opponents doing leaving the field with grass stains on their faces ? &quot; Some of the other guys may fall , but they are not tackled , &quot; Staunton said . &quot; Some of the guys just , uh , slip. &quot; Whatever the_Irish are doing , observers feel that if they do_it well enough to survive a difficult group containing Italy , Mexico and Norway , they could advance even further than in 1990 . That year , they lost to the host Italians in the quarterfinals , 1-0 . &quot; Most people in this country feel that if we can make_it out of our group , we can win it , &quot; said Eamonn Gibson , columnist for the_Irish Press daily newspaper in Dublin . &quot; This team is not afraid of anyone. &quot; Liam Brady , considered the Joe Montana of Irish soccer , is just as optimistic . &quot; As well as we are playing now , I honestly think we will be tough to beat_in the States , &quot; said Brady , 38 , who is now coaching in England . Brady is not a member of this team , nor the World Cup team in 1990 , despite competing in 72 international matches . The reason can be summed_up in two words that are spoken more in Irish pubs than &quot; Another round ! &quot; Those words are Big Jack . As in , Jack Charlton , a former coal_miner and member of the 1966 English World Cup champion who took_over as the_Irish coach in 1986 . He has since led them to a 40-11-25 record , even if it hasn ' t always been pretty . When Charlton cut Brady from the 1990 team , it was only the first in a series of moves that has made him a strong presence on the previously quiet Irish soccer frontier . If he doesn ' t like a player , that player is gone . If he doesn ' t like a question from a reporter , that press_conference is over . And if the feisty Irish journalists would ever dare imitate their British counterparts by criticizing their coach personally ? &quot; If anybody ever calls me a name , I ' ll punch them in the nose , &quot; Charlton , 59 , said to Irish reporters . But , well , he wins . &quot; I ' m not a tough coach if you understand football , &quot; Charlton said from Dublin . &quot; I know how the game should be played . And if the players play it my way , they won ' t have a problem. &quot; Three consecutive victories over World Cup teams certainly do not constitute a problem . Not that his team doesn ' t have other problems , according to Charlton , whose sorry public appraisals of his team would make even Lou Holtz blush . &quot; We ' re not a big fish in the sea , we ' re just little ol ' Ireland , &quot; Charlton said . &quot; We ' re a 33-to-1 shot . . . and that ' s about right. &quot; The Irish could have a problem in the heat of the many midday World Cup games . &quot; If you ask me , it all depends_on the heat , &quot; Staunton said . The best thing about these players might be that they look_like an English team , they talk like an English team . . . and actually should be an English team . One reason that the_English did not qualify for the World Cup this year might have been that many of their best players are playing for Ireland . Only seven of the 22 players were born in Ireland . They all qualified for the team because their parents or grandparents were born in Ireland . And none of the 22 play in Irish leagues . All but two play in England . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s fair to make a big deal of that , &quot; said Staunton , one of 12 players returning from the 1990 World Cup team . &quot; A lot of players here , their parents couldn ' t get jobs in Ireland and so they moved to England . You can ' t blame us for that. &quot; Other key returnees from the 1990 squad include goalkeeper Pat Bonner , defenders Paul McGrath and Kevin Moran , midfielders Ray Houghton , Andy Townsend and John Sheridan , and forwards Tony Cascarino and John Aldridge . Most impressive among the newcomers is midfielder Roy Keane , who competes for world_power Manchester United in England . Just as Charlton prefers , nobody on this team is a hero . But together , come July 17 , there might be no bigger heroes . &quot; We know a lot of people in the United States are from Ireland , we know we ' re going to hear a lot of cheering , &quot; Staunton said . &quot; We ' re going to try to give them a good show. &quot;</TEXT>
