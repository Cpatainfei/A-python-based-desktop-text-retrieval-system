   <HEADLINE> PRIVATE LIVES ; VISIONS OF MUSICAL MICE , VIDEO SUGARPLUMS ; CD-ROM : LISTEN UP ! THERE ' S A GROWING BODY OF COMPELLING CLASSICAL , POP , JAZZ AND WORLD BEAT SOUNDS TO CLICK YOUR MOUSE TO NOWADAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> OK , so you just got this big , imposing multimedia computer that was supposed to cut your workload in half . And it did . Now what are you going_to do with the extra_time ? Play a game ? Sure . There are thousands , almost every one an effective time killer . Log_on to cyberspace ? Yes , indeed . CompuServ , Prodigy , America Online and lesser-known services provide colorful new electronic definitions of the town square . And pushing_on through to the Internet literally opens_up the world via your computer_screen . But suppose you ' re a music fan , and what you really want is to get more in touch with jazz or rock or classical_music ? No problem . CD-ROM is the medium that can take you there . With increasing momentum in 1994 , music of every sort has begun to appear on CD-ROMs . Here ' s a sampling of what ' s available , with prices generally from $ 29.95 to $ 79.95 : Classical As far back as 1990 , the Voyager Co . produced an interactive look_at Beethoven . That title was the pathfinder for what has become Microsoft ' s growing Multimedia Music Series . The collection now includes &quot; Mozart : The Dissonant Quartet , &quot; &quot; Stravinsky : The Rite of Spring , &quot; &quot; Schubert : The Trout Quintet &quot; and &quot; Beethoven : The Ninth Symphony. &quot; Each title could easily serve as a music student ' s tutorial , with combinations of graphics , sound and text that describe , in illuminating detail , structural aspects of the music . But this is not dull , didactic stuff . At any given point , the listener has the opportunity to click on to an instant musical illustration of , say , the unusual harmonies that open the Mozart quartet or the feral rhythms of the Stravinsky work . Another mouse_click describes different instruments ( with audio examples ) , and another provides illustrated biographical information . There is a potentially far greater array of sounds in &quot; Microsoft Musical_Instruments , &quot; which examines more_than 200 instruments from around the world , as well as several dozen different musical assemblages . The disc is structured into four sections : &quot; Families of Instruments , &quot; &quot; Instruments of the World , &quot; &quot; Musical Ensembles &quot; and &quot; A-Z of Instruments. &quot; Ever wonder what a zampogna is ? Or a pipa ? Wonder no more . A few quick mouse_clicks will provide full-color pictures and audio examples of , respectively , an Italian bagpipe and a Chinese lute . Opera buffs are well-served by &quot; The Viking Opera Guide &quot; ( Penguin Books / Attica Cybernetics ) . More_than three hours of musical excerpts and the complete text of a 1 # 300-page opera reference_book are packed into this disc . The excerpted performances are more informative than remarkable , but the inclusion of a timeline , a world map and a search facility that permits inquiries on title , librettist , composer and so forth makes the guide an invaluable tool for even the casual opera listener . Pop The hits are coming fast , from Voyager ' s CD-ROM rendering of the Beatles ' &quot; A Hard Day ' s Night &quot; ( which includes the complete movie , with uncut scenes and an original script ) to more recent showcase outings by Peter Gabriel , David Bowie and Prince . Gabriel ' s &quot; Xplora 1 : Peter Gabriel ' s Secret World &quot; ( Interplay Productions ) has only been available for Macintosh computers since its release earlier this year . A Windows version , expected in January , will make the pioneering collection of videos , biographical material and interactive sessions available to a much larger audience . Typically , &quot; Xplora 1 &quot; reflects Gabriel ' s thoughtful approach to his music . It sets a high pop_music standard for the imaginative integration of sound , music and data in interactive media . &quot; Jump : The David Bowie Interactive CD-ROM &quot; ( ION ) fascinates primarily for the opportunity it provides to play_around with new video and audio mixes of the title tune . Other segments contain interview clips with Bowie , while the primary interactivity involves video game-like movements through 3-D hallways , rooms and so forth , accompanied by not especially interesting visual effects . Not exactly up_to the level one might have expected from an artist who would appear to be a natural for the far-reaching creative potential of CD-ROM . Prince ' s &quot; Interactive &quot; ( Graphix Zone ) takes the form of a game , in which the viewer has various tasks -- like collecting jewels -- to do before moving_on to the next one . Along the way , there are opportunities to sing-along , karaoke style , with KISS , to play a video-clip card_game , do song mixes , check_out interviews with Little Richard and Eric Clapton and take a close look_at the Purple One ' s wardrobe . It ' s all good fun and , like the Gabriel CD-ROM , a model of interactive media production . Other pop-oriented CD-ROMs include : &quot; Heart : 20 Years of Rock &amp; Roll &quot; ( New CD Music Show ) , a huge collage of videos , interviews , songs and photos that sometimes entertains and sometimes offers far more_than one could ever care to know about the veteran rock_group ; &quot; Woodstock : 3 Days of Peace and Music , 25th Anniversary &quot; ( Time Warner Interactive ) , yet another tour through the now-venerable and already overchronicled event , with documentary footage , videos , retrospective interviews from performers such_as John Sebastian and eight tunes from Janis Joplin , the Who , Richie Havens , et al. ; &quot; Grammy Awards CD-ROM &quot; ( Media Vision ) , which includes video clips of award performances , backstage footage and a database of Grammy info . Jazz , World Music &quot; Jazz : A Multimedia History &quot; ( Compton ' s New Media ) , released in 1992 , was an early and moderately successful effort to provide a pictures-and-sound overview of the art . It features brief visual clips of Miles Davis , Louis Armstrong , Ella Fitzgerald and others , as well as a rare segment of a performance by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie . Discography and bio sections include some point-and-click highlighting of names and terms that generate popup explanations . Compton also is distributing three similar collections devoted to the work of individual performers : &quot; Jazz Series : Louis Armstrong , Count Basie , Billie Holiday. &quot; Each takes a similar tack via the use of text slides , video and sound clips and bio and discographical databases . There are , in addition , as_many as a dozen straight-ahead audio tracks . Nothing is especially fancy , and the production does not remotely approach the high-powered interactivity of the pop CD-ROMs listed above , but the combination of informative data and entertaining audio and video makes_for useful additions to anyone ' s jazz library . &quot; World Beat &quot; ( Medio Multimedia ) is a generally excellent survey of world music , with one serious flaw . An interactive video segment , complete with narrative voice-over , includes point-and-click opportunities to hear a variety of musical sounds and styles . Another , text-oriented segment contains essays examining various world musics , and a third adds the complete data from the discographical &quot; All-Music Guide. &quot; So far , so good . But Medio falters with a &quot; music studio &quot; in which four-bar clips of such styles as rai , soca , and calypso are notated on screen ; minimal mixing and editing opportunities are provided and the output can be exported to a MIDI device . Unfortunately , the sounds heard by the average listener are generated by the computer ' s sound card , not by the CD . This means that the quality of what you hear will be determined totally by the quality of the sound card in your computer . Not a wise decision by Medio , compounded by the fact that , in the review_copy , the music studio ' s metronome pointing device was consistently late by at least one full beat. *</TEXT>
