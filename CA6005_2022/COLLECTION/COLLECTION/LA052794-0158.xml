   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; PRESIDENT OF VALENCIA NATIONAL_BANK IS ASKED FOR RESIGNATION ; FINANCE : ROBERT MANLEY SAYS HE IS BEING FORCED_OUT BECAUSE HE HAS TAKEN A HARD LINE ON COLLECTING ON LOANS OWED BY BOARD_MEMBERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a surprise move , the president of the Santa Clarita Valley ' s only local bank since its founding seven years ago has been asked to resign . Robert Manley , one of the founders of Valencia National_Bank , was unanimously asked to step_down Tuesday by the institution ' s board of directors , who cited concerns about his management abilities . However , Manley attributed his ouster to &quot; a fairly hard course &quot; he had taken_over the collection of loans by the bank to past and present board_members . &quot; I ' m telling the people who sign my paycheck they ' ve got_to belly up_to the bar and pay the piper , &quot; he said . Board_members said the loans have nothing to do with their request for Manley ' s resignation . The board first considered asking Manley to resign more_than two years ago , said Louis Garasi , chairman of the bank ' s board . Garasi said Manley has done nothing illegal or immoral , but that the bank ' s earnings have declined during the past three years . &quot; We don ' t have confidence in Mr. Manley to manage the bank in the future , &quot; Garasi said . If Manley chooses not to resign , &quot; he will be terminated , &quot; Garasi said . He declined to say what deadline the board has set for a reply to its request . Manley said he has not decided if he will resign , stating he plans to talk with an attorney first and is also leaving town for a week-and-a-half vacation . The bank remains in sound financial shape , despite the recent losses , according to both Manley and Garasi . Bank employees said they had no knowledge of the board ' s intentions until after Tuesday ' s meeting . &quot; It was a complete surprise to me , &quot; said James Perkins , the bank ' s senior_vice_president and chief financial_officer . &quot; I attend the board_meetings , but I am excused from the ( closed session ) personnel matters discussed by the board. &quot; The bank opened in October , 1987 , earning a net_income of $ 500 # 965 in 1989 and $ 511 # 982 in 1990 , Perkins said . Net_income dropped to $ 379 # 122 in 1991 , $ 310 # 458 in 1992 and $ 29 # 454 in 1993 -- a sharp drop that Perkins attributed to the recession and the cost of opening two new branches . Manley said the outstanding loans and legal costs of trying to collect them totaled &quot; several hundred_thousand dollars , &quot; which is why the bank ' s earnings dropped so dramatically in 1993 . &quot; Had it not been for that , it would have been a pretty decent year , &quot; he said . Even without the loans , the bank would have posted lower earnings in 1993 , Garasi said . A bank can lend money to its board_members as long as preferential treatment is not given , Manley said . He said some board_members were having problems paying_back their loans . &quot; It took considerable effort on my part to force the directors to step_up and pay_attention to this serious problem , &quot; he said . Some of the loans have been paid_back , but others remain outstanding , Manley said . He declined to discuss details of the loans in_question , but said they played a role in the resignation of four board_members who stepped_down within a month of each other last year . He said former board_member Kathy Wiener resigned last June because of problems with her loan . She and her husband , Harold , were also facing allegations of embezzling $ 2.8 million from trust_accounts at their company , Country Oaks Escrow Inc. , which the state seized last June 4 . Other board_members who resigned included Glen Rollins , Kent Fortin and Tony Matthess . Attempts to reach them Thursday were unsuccessful . Garasi acknowledged the resignations were &quot; due_to various concerns about the loans , &quot; but declined further comment about them . Current board_members have &quot; hardly any loans whatsoever at the bank , &quot; Garasi said . Besides Garasi , board_members include Gene Burke , Walt Fischer , Robert Nehabit , Chuck Albrecq and Joseph McKeon , brother of Rep . Howard ( Buck ) McKeon ( R-Santa Clarita ) .</TEXT>
