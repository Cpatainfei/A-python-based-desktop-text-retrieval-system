   <HEADLINE> FREE CLINICS FACE STRAIN ; THEY COULD BE OVERWHELMED WITH PATIENTS IF PROP . 187 IS ENFORCED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> She is undocumented , she has six children and she is very confused . The 30-year-old woman from Michoacan , Mexico , carried her 5-month-old baby and 5-year-old son into the Lestonnac Free Clinic on Thursday to get flu medicine for her children . &quot; I ' m very worried , &quot; said the woman , who wanted to remain anonymous because of her immigration status . &quot; I have six children -- that ' s a lot to be worried about . I can come here for help , but I ' m not sure about much of anything else anymore. &quot; The reason for her confusion : the passage of Proposition 187 . Lestonnac is one of a handful of free clinics in Orange County that provide care to the poor and uninsured but do not receive government funding or ask patients for documents . Such clinics could be flooded with patients if the initiative to deny undocumented immigrants basic health_care from public providers is implemented , health-care officials said . A lawsuit filed_in Sacramento on Wednesday blocked public health-care providers from denying undocumented immigrants care . But if Proposition 187 survives legal challenges , centers such_as Lestonnac could become undocumented immigrants ' only lifeline to health_care . Jean Forbath , a member of the board of directors of Share Our Selves , which also provides health_care to the indigent but receives some public funding , said the clinic could be overwhelmed with patients if county medical clinics abide_by the letter of the new law . The clinic serves a significant Latino population but will not abide_by the initiative , regardless of what the courts decide , Forbath said . That means the clinic risks losing public funding from the state cigarette tax and other sources -- which amounted to about $ 185 # 000 last year . Forbath said the clinic hopes to receive volunteer services and donated money to make_up the possible loss in government funding . Dr. Hugh Stallworth , the county ' s director of public health , said free clinics in the county &quot; probably have limited capacity , &quot; but he is unsure how they will be affected by the new law . Stallworth awaits state directions on implementing the law at county clinics . The state may give instructions on enforcing the law after a court hearing Wednesday , he said . Sister Marie Therese Solomon , who started the Lestonnac clinic in 1979 , said she has not seen an increase in patients since Tuesday ' s election and has not thought_about whether more patients will seek services at her clinic . Solomon , who has been with the Sisters of the Company of Mary for more_than 50 years , said she is concerned only about her patients ' well-being and did not want to give an opinion of the new state law . &quot; We look_after the poorest of the poor , &quot; Solomon said . &quot; We don ' t ask them for papers . Neither do we intend to. &quot; Her center gets money only from corporate donors and grants , as well as from the United Way -- not federal or state dollars , she said . About 50 doctors volunteer their services at Lestonnac . * Between 500 and 600 patients go_to the clinic each month , Solomon said . Some sat in the clinic waiting room Thursday as a doctor called_in patients one by one . A Nicaraguan woman said she took three buses from her home_in Fullerton , with three children , to get_to Lestonnac . The woman , who also asked that her name not be used because of her immigration status , said she cannot afford regular health_care because she is uninsured . She and her husband obtained work_permits when they applied for political asylum , but she was confused about how she could obtain urgent and costly health_care without possessing a green_card . &quot; We can ' t give_up our health_care , &quot; the woman said . &quot; If you ' re not healthy , you can ' t work. &quot; The woman from Michoacan , sitting beside her , nodded as she gave her baby daughter a bottle of milk . &quot; I think ( Proposition 187 ) is terrible , &quot; she said , adding that she moved to California in 1986 . &quot; We can keep coming ( to the clinic ) , but what about my children in school ? Two of them were born in Mexico and the other four were born here . What will happen to them ? &quot; Both women said they did not think the law ' s limitations on health and social_service benefits would stop illegal immigration or force people to give_up and go_back to their home countries . &quot; We will leave if worse comes_to worst , &quot; said the woman from Michoacan , with an uncertain smile . &quot; But in that case , we would n ' t be leaving -- they ' d be carrying us out_in a truck. &quot;</TEXT>
