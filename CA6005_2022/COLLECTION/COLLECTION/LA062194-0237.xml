   <TEXT> The task facing Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti in the O.J. Simpson case is daunting and unparalleled : He must try to win murder_convictions against an American sports legend well-known to the public for his charm and grace . Rarely , if ever , has a murder_suspect generated the outpouring of concern that has been expressed for Simpson . From freeway overpasses to radio talk_shows , members of the public have voiced their support and disbelief that Simpson -- a welcome visitor to their living_rooms for a generation via the airwaves -- could be capable of such a coldblooded crime . The football hall of famer ' s tremendous popularity poses an unprecedented challenge to the district_attorney , one that is forcing Garcetti to take extraordinary measures . Within hours of last Friday ' s bizarre nationally televised spectacle of crowds cheering the beloved football superstar as he led police on a low-speed pursuit across Southern California freeways , Garcetti took_to the airwaves himself , launching an unusual public relations blitzkrieg on national TV news_programs . ABC ' s &quot; Nightline. &quot; &quot; CBS Evening News. &quot; &quot; NBC Nightly News. &quot; &quot; Today Show. &quot; Even a special nighttime edition of &quot; Good_Morning America. &quot; Garcetti , in an interview Monday with The Times , said that he recognizes that public perception is important in high-profile cases , and that he , like defense_lawyers , must use the media to shape popular_opinion . Garcetti insisted that his primary goal during his interviews has been to stress the pressing issue of domestic violence . But he acknowledged that his high-profile initiative has also served as a means of meeting the unique challenge of the Simpson case by trying to focus attention on the homicide victims , Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman , rather than the retired football star . &quot; After seeing how the media was responding , how some members of the community were responding to the situation , &quot; Garcetti said , he decided &quot; to remind people that the real tragedy , the real sympathy should be extended_to the two people who were killed and to the children of Nicole Simpson. &quot; &quot; When you say well-known , &quot; Garcetti said , referring to O.J. Simpson , &quot; you mean superficially well-known . It is a daunting challenge perhaps ( to try him ) , but I do have faith in the criminal justice system. &quot; By undertaking his public relations offensive , Garcetti risks a backlash that could create even more sympathy . Garcetti ' s public comments , which included an ultimately incorrect prediction on the &quot; Today Show &quot; that defense_attorney Robert Shapiro would seek a postponement of Simpson ' s arraignment , have drawn fire from Shapiro . Calling Garcetti ' s public discussion of the case unconscionable , Shapiro said that &quot; to make any comments before an arraignment undermines the system of fair play. &quot; Legal experts contacted Monday said Garcetti could alienate members of the public who might feel that Simpson is being persecuted rather than prosecuted . &quot; It ' s a fine line , &quot; said Loyola School_of_Law professor Laurie Levenson , &quot; because the defense will say the district_attorney ' s office is unfairly trying the case in the press and will also claim that it is doing so because it does not have enough evidence to win in the courtroom. &quot; But experts , including Levenson , agreed Monday that Garcetti has little choice in his public relations gambit , given the recent track record of the office that he took_over from Ira Reiner last year . Long before the Simpson case , several high-profile actions filed by the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office have ended in acquittals or mistrials , including the McMartin child molestation case , the Rodney King beating case and the Menendez murder trial . Some experts said that if Erik and Lyle Menendez , who admitted killing their parents , could win the sympathy of jurors , just consider the possible reaction to Simpson . With that in mind , the experts said , Garcetti ' s high profile may be the only way to stay_on a_level playing_field in this case . &quot; People reacted last week as if they were at a public sports event and O.J. Simpson was an athlete in a game , &quot; said Southwestern University School_of_Law professor Robert Pugsley . &quot; If a jury can get hung_up on the Menendez brothers , a jury can get hung_up on a national hero. &quot; In his round of national appearances , Garcetti has made several statements that could help deflate Simpson ' s longtime image . &quot; We have a man who was fleeing , and that fact alone , in our mind , establishes a consciousness of guilt , &quot; Garcetti told Ted Koppel on ABC ' s &quot; Nightline &quot; shortly after Simpson was taken into custody at his Brentwood mansion Friday night . Responding to a question Sunday from TV political talk_show panelist George Will , the prosecutor also weighed in on Simpson ' s potential legal strategies . &quot; Well , it ' s not going_to shock me if we see an O.J. Simpson , sometime down the road -- and it could happen very soon , it could happen months from now -- say , ' OK , I did do_it , but I ' m not responsible , ' &quot; he told Will on &quot; This Week With David Brinkley. &quot; &quot; We ' ve seen it in Menendez . It ' s going_to be a likely defense here , I believe , once the evidence is reviewed by the lawyers . On &quot; CBS Evening News &quot; Saturday , Garcetti linked the issue of spousal abuse directly to the Simpson case . In that appearance , he roundly criticized a municipal judge who allowed Simpson to pick his own psychiatrist and receive counseling by phone after pleading no contest to beating his then-wife Nicole in 1989 . The judge in that case , Ronald Schoenberg , &quot; kissed . . . off &quot; the case , Garcetti told CBS anchor Bob Schieffer . &quot; It was almost saying , ' OK . Look , walk_out_of here . Nothing ' s going_to happen to you. ' &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . David Conn , assigned by Garcetti to help prosecute the case , said Monday that the office ' s high profile is only a matter of responding to the extraordinary public interest . &quot; I don ' t feel that we ' ve taken much of an offense . I think we ' ve been very fair and neutral . We ' re simply responding to concerns of the media and we haven ' t tried to exploit the situation in any way. &quot; Making His Point Here are some examples of the public comments made by Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti since the arrest of O.J. Simpson in the slayings of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman : * Friday on &quot; Nightline &quot; &quot; We have a man who was fleeing , and that fact alone , in our mind , establishes a consciousness of guilt. &quot; * Saturday on &quot; CBS Evening News &quot; &quot; Unfortunately , the judge in ( the 1989 domestic violence case involving O.J. Simpson ) kissed it off . I don ' t know why , I don ' t know the judge , but there certainly was not a meaningful sentence . In fact , it was almost saying , ' OK . Look , walk_out_of here . Nothing ' s going_to happen to you. ' &quot; * Sunday on &quot; This Week With David Brinkley &quot; &quot; Well , it ' s not going_to shock me if we see an O.J. Simpson , sometime down the road -- and it could happen very soon , it could happen months from now -- say , ' OK , I did do_it , but I ' m not responsible. ' We ' ve seen it in Menendez . It ' s going_to be a likely defense here , I believe , once the evidence is reviewed by the lawyers . We don ' t know . It ' s speculation on my part , but we ' ll be waiting. &quot; * Sunday on &quot; NBC Nightly News &quot; &quot; We in the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office unfortunately are filing one domestic violence homicide case every nine days . That should shock everyone. &quot;</TEXT>
