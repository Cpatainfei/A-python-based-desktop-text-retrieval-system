   <HEADLINE> HOPE DIMS FOR ENDING U.S. MILITARY ' S TURF WARS ; DEFENSE : SERVICE BRANCHES FEUD OVER FUNCTIONS AND ARMS . CONGRESS HAD SET UP COMMISSION TO REDUCE DUPLICATION AND WASTE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Navy wants to stop the Air_Force from controlling all &quot; deep-strike &quot; bombing missions . The Army wants to edge the Marines out of the action in fighting major land wars . The Marines are looking_for a_few good tanks -- most of which are now owned by the Army . The Air_Force is angling for its own warplanes -- and not the Navy ' s carrier-borne aircraft -- to be the first to respond to trouble anywhere around the globe . Welcome to the world of &quot; roles and missions &quot; -- the armed_services ' lengthy and heated effort to redefine which functions each should perform and what kinds of weapons each should have in the post-Cold War era . After years of Defense_Department refusals to tackle the issue -- and a_couple_of false starts by the military itself -- Congress last year finally set_up an independent Commission on Roles and Missions to referee the fracas . But the exercise , only a_few months old , has already degenerated into a military food fight , dimming hopes that any serious sorting-out actually will be achieved : * The Air_Force , in what some complain was a last hurrah by its outgoing chief_of_staff , Gen . Merrill A . McPeak , put_down some markers that outraged leaders of the three other services . * The Clinton_Administration has yet to provide any real leadership in the effort . Insiders say top Pentagon officials , seeking only to protect the existing military structure , have discouraged any further discussion on how to reshape the armed forces . * The Roles and Missions Commission itself has hinted that it is unlikely to recommend sweeping changes . John P . White , the chairman , says the panel will hew mainly to ideas that seem &quot; implementable &quot; and avoid any &quot; dramatic . . . solutions. &quot; The issue is important because duplication in the military has reached such proportions that some analysts say it is impeding effectiveness and siphoning_off badly needed defense dollars that could be_better used for modernization and preparedness . Robert H . Gaskin , a former Pentagon strategist , argues that with the defense budget under pressure -- and new technology altering the way America goes_to_war -- streamlining the military &quot; is one of the critical defense issues we face. &quot; &quot; We now have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to consolidate our military Establishment and improve the way the individual services work together , &quot; Gaskin said . &quot; What is being done now could have a serious impact for decades to come. &quot; The battle over roles and missions has been going_on virtually since the invention of the airplane . Before that , the division of labor was simple : The Army fought the nation ' s land wars and the Navy fought its sea battles . Few conflicts arose . Military aviation changed all that . Former Sen . Barry Goldwater ( R-Ariz. ) has observed that the United States is the only major_power in the world that maintains four distinct air_forces . ( The Army , Navy , Marines and Air_Force all have warplanes. ) Overlaps mushroomed during the Cold_War , as planners found that some redundancy was necessary insurance in case part of the U.S. force was wiped_out . Interservice rivalry fueled the competition . Sophisticated new technology blurred the lines even more . Today , repetition is rampant . Army helicopters and Air_Force and Marine Corps fighters can provide cover_for U.S. ground troops . The Navy , Air_Force and Army are equipped to send bombs or missiles far into enemy territory . And all defend against enemy planes and missiles . Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) , the major force behind the current effort , has suggested that the military might be able to save billions of dollars by sorting_out such functions more carefully and eliminating some of the duplication . Nunn also has pinpointed a spate of redundant institutions , including separate medical , legal and chaplains ' corps for each service , that he says might be run more efficiently if they were combined . Williamson Murray , a military historian at Ohio State University , argues that the roles-and-missions exercise should aim for more_than mere budget-cutting . The goal , he says , should be reshaping the military to adapt to the new post-Cold War threats and to exploit today ' s technology . With the Cold_War over , he says , the military must eliminate the redundancies that were permitted when the United States and Soviet_Union were at_odds . &quot; My guess is that we can ' t fix them all , &quot; he said . &quot; But we have to do a better job. &quot; Dan Goure , an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies , wishes that the debate would spur fundamental decisions on using ground forces and air_power . &quot; Ideally , this discussion should be helping to resolve the whole question of the military ' s role in carrying_out U.S. foreign_policy , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s a real opportunity -- not just to redivide the pie but to redefine the entire menu. &quot; Some analysts argue that not all duplications are wastes . The Marines ' way of conducting ground combat operations , for example , is far different from the Army ' s . Its pilots are trained specially to provide air cover that fits that mold . And in some cases , merging two or more seemingly duplicate entities might not save much money at all . The military still would need the same number of physicians , lawyers and chaplains as it has now , for example , even if they were combined under a single service . Andrew F . Krepinevich , director of the Defense Budget Project , a defense-monitoring group , argues that saving money is not the only reason for the roles-and-missions exercise . Even the most radical proposals would not fully relieve the military ' s budget problem . The Pentagon has begun some modest efforts . The Joint Chiefs_of_Staff recommended last year that the services combine all basic flight training under one roof . And the four may consolidate at least some of their supply depots . But Nunn and other critics argue that the reform should go_far beyond such peripheral issues to broader questions -- such_as which service should be charged with projecting U.S. air_power , which should fight the major land wars and which should provide close air support . &quot; The fundamental question is not what is best for the Navy or the Air_Force , &quot; Nunn said . &quot; The question is , what is best for America. &quot; To Gaskin , now with Business_Executives for National Security , a defense monitoring group , that means dividing the battlefield into segments -- from outer space to the rear areas behind the battlefield -- and &quot; looking_at what each service brings_to the table. &quot; By those standards , at least , McPeak ' s controversial proposals go furthest . The former Air_Force chief_of_staff wants the Pentagon to give his service -- rather than the Navy -- the primary job in projecting U.S. military power to potential global trouble spots , arguing that it would be faster and cheaper than maintaining 12 aircraft_carriers worldwide . Under his proposal , the Air_Force would also control all strategic bombing and missile strikes , and it would take_over complete responsibility for defense against air and missile attacks . Providing close air support for ground troops would be left to the Army and Marines . The other services are battling to protect their turf . The Marines , resisting McPeak ' s proposal to bar them from anything beyond providing close air support for troops , want to maintain their tactical air wings . Navy officials argue that the United States might not always be able to win permission to use other countries ' airfields for bombing missions , as the former Air_Force chief ' s plan would require . They also counter that launching ship-based Tomahawk missiles for deep-strike operations is often faster and more effective than sending squadrons of bombers . A few weeks ago , in a rare move , the chiefs of the Army , Navy and Marine Corps angrily signed a joint memo opposing a related McPeak move to have the Air_Force assume control of all military operations in space . Maj . Gen . Thomas L . Wilkerson , the Marine Corps ' point_man on the roles-and-missions debate , says he finds it &quot; ironic &quot; that the Air_Force is trying to segment the battlefield at a time when the services have begun to perfect their ability to operate jointly , as a team . &quot; Gen . McPeak is assuming that the enemy will ' get the lecture ' and go_along with what he proposes , &quot; Wilkerson said . &quot; Actually , the enemy will draw his own lines , and we need to have the flexibility to meet that threat. &quot; McPeak ' s proposal is not the only roles-and-missions battleground . The Army and Marine Corps , for example , are fighting over which should get more of the ground action in post-Cold War military operations . The Army wants recognition as the primary service for fighting &quot; sustained &quot; land wars , leaving the Marines to play a limited role in more modest , short-term operations , such_as peacekeeping duty in Haiti . It also is moving deeper into the area of amphibious_operations . The Marines , seeking to widen their own role , want more Army_tanks and V-22 Osprey troop-carrying aircraft . The coming free-for-all is not expected to be tidy . The services have begun campaigning , not only among members of the Roles and Missions Commission , but also among their longtime supporters in Congress . To its credit , the 11-member Roles and Missions Commission has taken a step toward some reform . The panel ' s ambitious , 26-issue agenda includes such topics as improving joint war fighting , streamlining the current command structure and sorting_out military air operations . It plans to issue final recommendations within six months . But the commission has only a small staff , and many of its members are retired military_officers long identified with preserving the status_quo . The panel itself has been meeting only once a month , and not everyone shows_up . Skeptics question whether it is up_to the job .
