   <HEADLINE> NATIONS UNIFIED IN CELEBRATING INDEPENDENCE ; FESTIVITIES SPOTLIGHT CULTURES OF CENTRAL_AMERICAN_COUNTRIES AND THEIR AMERICAN EMIGRES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Independence_Day speeches in five Central_American_countries on Sept . 15 always touch_on a desire for the republics to someday reunite . That dream has found its way to Los Angeles , where the peoples of Costa Rica , El_Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras and Nicaragua will unite for a grand independence celebration today that starts at 11 a.m. with a parade through Pico-Union and continues with festivities at the Normandie Playground . The local celebration will include the national_anthems of the United States , Mexico , the five Central_American_countries and those of Panama and Belize as well , although those two Central_American_nations celebrate their independence separately . Dancers representing different regions within all seven Central_American_nations will perform and music will blare throughout the park . And the most essential element of any Latin_American celebration -- the food -- will be plentiful . &quot; We are the masters of food , &quot; said Luis Max Ocon , a member of the nonprofit Committee for the Central_American Independence Parade , which operates at the Central_American Resource Center . The committee has sponsored united independence celebrations eight of the last nine years at MacArthur Park , but this year lost the race to reserve that locale to KKHJ-AM 930 Radio Alegria , which is having a Mexican Independence_Day celebration there today . The committee ' s parade starts at 7th and Alvarado streets , goes south to Pico Boulevard , west to Normandie Avenue passing Santo Tomas Catholic_Church , and south on Normandie Avenue where it will end at Venice Boulevard at the Normandie Playground . Alvaro Torres , a popular singer from El_Salvador , was scheduled to be grand marshal and to perform but could not attend due_to a death in the family , Ocon said . Instead , Martha Luz Gutierrez , who was named queen in a Central_American pageant this month , will serve as grand marshal . Back in Managua , Nicaragua , which 52-year-old Ocon left when he was 15 , families would walk to the Esplanada , the town courtyard , to see a parade of townspeople , marching bands , the military and its tanks and listen to political speeches . &quot; We celebrate it like our Fourth_of_July , &quot; he said . &quot; The speakers would talk_about remembering the people who got involved in the independence and the heroes of the country . ( They would talk ) about the peoples of the five republics getting united and that one day we will be united. &quot; After the five colonies declared their independence from Spain on Sept . 15 , 1821 , they formed the Central_American Federation , which held from 1823 to 1838 . After its collapse 15 years later the regions became independent nations . ( Other nations celebrating their independence_days through Hispanic Heritage Month , Sept . 15 through Oct . 15 , are Chile , Cuba , Bolivia and Mexico. ) Gutierrez , who is also from Managua , looks_forward to today ' s celebration to show_off her Nicaraguan culture . &quot; Even though the other Latin cultures are similar , we ( Nicaraguans ) have our own culture and our own lifestyle , &quot; said the 21-year-old Cypress College psychology student who was awarded $ 6 # 000 in scholarships as the pageant ' s winner . Central_Americans who are feeling a touch of nostalgia will be able to meet fellow countrymen and taste their traditional foods , like nacatamal , a special tamale usually eaten_on Saturdays and holidays in Nicaragua . Many of the American-born youngsters will have a chance to experience an event like the ones their parents and grandparents celebrated in Central_America . &quot; This is what we try to give our young people and for them to keep_on doing this , &quot; Ocon said . &quot; I think you should not ever forget your roots or where you come from. &quot; * Central_American Independence Festival , Normandie Playground , Normandie Avenue and Venice Boulevard ; 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. today ; free ( 213 ) 413-3191 . * Mexican Independence_Day Celebration , MacArthur Park , Alvarado Street and Wilshire Boulevard ; noon to 6 p.m. today ; free ( 213 ) 461-9300 A Month of Fireworks COSTA RICA : Sept . 15 EL_SALVADOR : Sept . 15 HONDURAS : Sept . 15 NICARAGUA : Sept . 15 GUATEMALA : Sept . 15 MEXICO : Sept . 16 CHILE : Sept . 18 CUBA : Oct . 10 BOLIVIA : Oct . 12 Nine Latin_American nations celebrate their independence_days during Hispanic Heritage Month , Sept . 15 through Oct . 15 . * Father Hidalgo y Costilla , a parish priest , launched Mexico ' s fight for independence from Spain on Sept . 16 , 1810 .
