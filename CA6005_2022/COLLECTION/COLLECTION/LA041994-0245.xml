   <TEXT> Late in the 1970s , an Afrikaner business colleague of Alastair Barclay , a real_estate_broker in Johannesburg , told him , &quot; We either have to get apartheid right in the next 10 to 15 years , or we give it up as unworkable and accept the consequences. &quot; &quot; For my Afrikaner friend , the question was not of democracy or of morality , but of pragmatic politics -- could they make_it work , &quot; Barclay recalled . &quot; The answer was a long_time in coming , but in the end it was no -- apartheid could not be made to work . . . . Afrikaners could not get black people to accept endless oppression , and they themselves were not willing to play the role of oppressors forever and to pay the cost of this folly. &quot; Barclay , sitting_back in the comfortable living room of his home_in Rivonia , one of Johannesburg ' s wealthy northern suburbs , recounted the conversation with a bittersweet relish . He is ready , he said , for majority_rule , for the &quot; New South_Africa , &quot; but he knows that it will cost him , certainly in increased taxes , probably in a diminished standard_of_living , perhaps in reverse discrimination and quite possibly in a higher level of anxiety over the next two or three years . &quot; We must get_on_with it , &quot; he said . &quot; This old government has lost all legitimacy . . . . The only thing the National Party has done right in years is sound the retreat for white rule. &quot; But Barclay , 61 , quickly distinguishes himself from &quot; the bleeding- heart liberals whom one finds so plentifully in the northern suburbs among English-speaking whites. &quot; &quot; I came_to South_Africa 28 years ago in part because I was to the right politically and because I could not see a future for myself in socialist Britain , &quot; he said . &quot; I found I was far more conservative than most of the_English here . If I had the vote then , I would have voted for the Nats , apartheid and all . I felt that the races couldn ' t mix , but my attitude was more paternalistic and colonial than ideological . . . . &quot; It took me years to change . We did not see much of the brutality of apartheid -- so_much of it took_place in the ( black ) townships and rural_areas . Over time , however , blacks themselves managed to make us aware of what apartheid was doing to them and their families , and I couldn ' t live with that. &quot; * Jennifer Barclay , 52 , argued that South_Africa ' s censored press and state-run radio and television &quot; kept us thinking everything was fine -- no problems , no worries , nothing to fear -- and the Nat government would go_on forever . &quot; There was so_much we didn ' t know about what the government was doing -- what was going_on in the ( black ) townships , in the prisons , in the schools , the brutality with which blacks were driven from their homes because an area was set_aside for whites . We might hear that something happened , but it would be just a brief in the paper . &quot; If you don ' t see something , you don ' t think_about it . Maybe we didn ' t want to know , you could say , but the fact is we didn ' t . . . . Once we did start to see it , on television , on reports in the overseas media , in some photographs that did get_into the local press , then we could not ignore it. &quot; Even when the political violence of the 1980s was close , however , it left whites largely untouched . &quot; When Alex was in flames a_few years ago with gun battles up and down the streets , we couldn ' t hear or see it , not even the smoke , &quot; Alastair Barclay said , recalling the &quot; Battle of Alexandra &quot; in the nearby black township in February , 1986 . &quot; We would sit here on the patio each evening , sipping our gins and listening to the radio describe fighting that might have been in Rwanda but was only two minutes away as the crow flies. &quot; But Jennifer Barclay ' s son-in-law -- both Barclays have grown children from previous marriages -- was wounded in the back by shrapnel when an ANC guerrilla , disobeying orders against hitting &quot; soft targets , &quot; placed a bomb at Magoo ' s Bar on the Durban waterfront in June , 1986 , to protest declaration of a state of emergency . Three people were killed and 69 wounded . &quot; We got_to where we are today , &quot; Alastair Barclay said , reflecting on the sweep of the last decade , &quot; as blacks realized they couldn ' t win by revolution , no matter how many bombs they placed , and whites recognized that maintaining apartheid , and that means white rule , in the face of this increasing unrest was costing us economic_growth . . . . &quot; From 1976 , when the riots broke_out in Soweto , people began to realize that this couldn ' t continue , and that became clear to all during the 1980s . But what would we have instead and how to achieve it were still questions without answers_for us. &quot; &quot; South_Africa has been very , very good to me , &quot; Barclay said , reflecting on how he came_to the country after spotting an advertisement for a property valuer and has prospered in his three decades here . The spacious Barclay house has a swimming_pool and a tennis_court . Jennifer Barclay , once the women ' s golf champion in South_Africa , plays twice a week with friends . Their daughter , Katrina , 15 , studies at a long-integrated private high_school . The family has traveled widely in Europe and the United States . &quot; My life would probably be the envy of most American women , &quot; Jennifer Barclay said . &quot; We have a domestic worker who lives_in , we have a gardener and , except for chauffeuring my daughter to all her teen-age things , I do as I please with my day. &quot; All this leaves the Barclays , as well as_many other whites , with the difficult question of how much they have benefited from apartheid while opposing it . Both lay most of the blame for apartheid on the Afrikaners , particularly the National Party , which came_to power in 1948 , and acknowledge that rival parties were able only to badger the Nationalists into a_few reforms . Alastair Barclay extended his criticism of the National Party to its management of the economy , its bloating of the government and the widespread corruption found in recent years . &quot; From what I know now , I can see how incompetent , dishonest , corrupt and immoral they have been , &quot; he said . But change will come at a cost , the Barclays acknowledge . &quot; We know we are going_to be taxed more , maybe a lot more , &quot; Alastair Barclay said . &quot; We will have to pay_for past sins . Black education alone will take billions , and it has to be priority . We have all been living on the profits of apartheid , to borrow a phrase , and no one can seriously object to doing what needs doing now . &quot; Everyone accepts , I think , that there is a moral duty to put things right as much as we can , as fast as we can . We will have to expiate in other ways too . We just don ' t want to be bled white so that people will start voting with their feet and leaving. &quot; * One change that has surprised -- and delighted -- the Barclays has been the easy new relations between whites and blacks in their day-to-day contacts . &quot; I have a caddy , and he ' s a helluva nice guy , &quot; Jennifer Barclay said . &quot; But before the changes started , his conversation used to be limited to ' Yes , ma ' am ' and ' No , ma ' am ' and the_like . He was another black to me , I suppose , and I was another white to him . Today , I ' m ' Mrs . Barclay , ' and we talk_about everything. &quot; * Hanging proudly from a nail in the wall_in the front_room of Matanga Dlamini ' s home_in Imbali , a black township outside Pietermaritzburg , is the framed certificate of service issued on his 1992 retirement from the Natal provincial administration -- a 21-year record of promotions from laborer to cleaner to messenger to office assistant . &quot; My grandfather did all_right , but we want to do_better , &quot; Lindiwe Sithole , 16 , declared with the nonchalance of youth . &quot; I ' m going_to be a doctor . . . . &quot; It ' s not just that I want to be a doctor -- I am going_to be a doctor , &quot; she said . &quot; I want to help people , and besides that , doctors earn quite a lot . In the new South_Africa , people will be able to be all they can be. &quot; Lindiwe ' s pronouncement drew knowing smiles from her cousins packed around the room , for she is called , one cousin confided later , &quot; the pushy one. &quot; But Doreen Dlamini , 57 , a &quot; tea lady &quot; in the government ' s provincial headquarters but the unquestioned matriarch of a three-generation Zulu family of more_than 30 sons , daughters , grandchildren and in-laws , almost all living within a_few houses of each other on the same street , nodded her head in affirmation . &quot; That girl is going_to be somebody and probably a big somebody , &quot; Doreen Dlamini said , looking_up from her potato peeling and inclining her head toward Lindiwe . &quot; South_Africa is changing , and if she wants to be a doctor there won ' t be anybody standing there saying : ' No , girl , we don ' t need any more kaffir doctors this year . You must do something else. ' Those days are over. &quot; * Among the numerous Dlamini cousins , a clan so close-knit they interact more like brothers and sisters , expectations are indeed high for the future and a constant theme in their conversations . They have seen how their parents , although pushed_through high_school by the elder Dlaminis , failed to make_it through the narrow , state-controlled funnel into good jobs . Their lives , they say , will be different from those of their parents and grandparents . &quot; I ' m going_to be a teacher -- history and geography , &quot; said Precious Dlamini , 17 . &quot; I have the right subjects this year , I know what to take next year and the year after , I know what the teachers college requires . . . . Don ' t worry , I ' ve got_it all lined up. &quot; Around the room , there was a litany of ambitions -- teacher , teacher , nurse , traffic warden , secretary , lawyer , teacher , bookkeeper and , finally , almost sheepishly , policeman . &quot; My father was a policeman , and that is what I want to be , &quot; said Philip Dlamini , 24 . &quot; Until now , it has not been possible . It has been too dangerous , and for the past 10 years the police were used against the people , not to protect them . I think this will change , that in the new South_Africa the police will be part of the people , and then I want to join the police. &quot; Philip Dlamini , who finished his schooling five years ago , is now among the vast number of unemployed blacks in South_Africa , picking_up a_few days of work a month as a casual laborer but not earning much more_than enough to pay his way at_home , where his late father ' s pension is the main income . &quot; Jobs -- there just are no jobs , &quot; he said . &quot; Never mind what you want to do , never mind what ambitions you have , there are not even jobs shoveling dirt or digging holes or collecting trash . . . . We have great hopes for Nelson Mandela as president and for the new government , that they will be able to make jobs for all. &quot; * The hopes are not just those of the young . Pointing to a picture of Mandela on an ANC calendar , Matanga Dlamini said : &quot; We are expecting so_much of Mandela , we have been waiting for him for so_long . He was our leader when we were young , and he should have been our president long , long ago. &quot; Among Zulus , however , this is a highly contentious point_of_view because of Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi ' s bitter rivalry with the ANC leadership . &quot; This is our leader , Nelson Mandela , &quot; Matanga Dlamini said , tapping the calendar again for emphasis . &quot; I am a Zulu , and I am proud to be a Zulu . Buthelezi is one of our chiefs , and King Goodwill Zwelithini is the king of our nation . But South_Africa is a modern country with many people other_than the Zulus , and Nelson Mandela will soon be its president . For the Zulus to destroy this beautiful country would be a shame. &quot; Imbali , a classic black township of four-room houses , many of which have been expanded to accommodate growing families , was an early battleground in the war between supporters of the ANC and Buthelezi ' s Inkatha Freedom Party . &quot; The fighting was very intense here , &quot; Philip Dlamini recalled . &quot; Inkatha had some big offensives , trying to push ANC supporters out of the township . The police instigated Inkatha to invade . We in the UDF ( the pro-ANC United Democratic Front ) had to defend ourselves , street by street and even house by house . . . . Things are_quiet now , but we are not fully in control. &quot; What Imbali has , according to Lindiwe , is &quot; a small piece of peace. &quot; &quot; We didn ' t defeat them ( Inkatha ) , they didn ' t defeat us , we both are still here , &quot; she said . &quot; They hold that bit of land across the road and down the_hill , we hold the rest , and that is the way it stays . Look , Inkatha is a problem , but it won ' t consume my life . Politics is meant to be an endless tussle , but to achieve something. &quot; * Blacks have triumphed in their struggle against apartheid : Minority white rule is at an end . Yet the legacy of apartheid weighs heavily upon the whole country , whites as well as blacks , as the ANC , no longer a liberation movement but a government in waiting , assesses South_Africa ' s needs . &quot; This is not a time to rest , &quot; said Albertina Sisulu , wife of Walter , mother of Zwelakhe and Max and one of the indomitable figures of the resistance against apartheid . &quot; We did not come this far just to sit_down on those cushiony seats at Parliament . We came_to change things. &quot; Albertina Sisulu , 75 , who ranks near the top of the ANC ' s list of candidates in next week ' s election , is worried -- about both complacency , the feeling that political power will solve all problems , and exaggerated expectations of many blacks . &quot; We can ' t repair the damage done_by 45 years of apartheid in 45 days of democracy , as some people expect , &quot; she said , &quot; but we mustn ' t be deterred by the size of the job. &quot; * She is already working_on what she expects will be her portfolios in Parliament -- health_care , local_government and housing . &quot; Parliament will need those with experience of how people lived under apartheid , &quot; she said at her Soweto home . &quot; that ' s where I belong. &quot; Known lovingly as &quot; Ma Sisulu &quot; and accorded the title &quot; mother of the nation &quot; by blacks for her years on the front_lines , Albertina Sisulu credits the &quot; Class of ' 49 &quot; -- Nelson Mandela , her husband , Walter , others elected at that seminal ANC conference -- with the political transformation under way here . &quot; The youth of that era dedicated their lives to this cause , and their dedication inspired the rest of the nation , &quot; she said . &quot; This is an enterprise that has been handed from one generation to another and now to another . &quot; For the Sisulus , it has been a family enterprise . We ' ve all been in it -- father , mother , all_the children , even many of the grandchildren now . But families are where we are born , where we live and , yes , where we die . . . . The struggle against apartheid has been a struggle on behalf of the families of South Africa. &quot;</TEXT>
