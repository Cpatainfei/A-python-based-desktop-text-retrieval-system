   <HEADLINE> ZANINESS IN ZAIRE ; A MEMORABLE CAST OF CHARACTERS AND A SHOCKING FINISH MADE THE ALI-FOREMAN FIGHT 20 YEARS AGO ONE OF SPORTS ' GREATEST SPECTACLES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Under moonlight at 3 o ' clock_in the morning , without a sound but frogs croaking in symphony along the banks of a mighty 2 # 900-mile river that coursed from the South Atlantic through the veins of Africa ' s continent , Muhammad Ali suddenly appeared , moving at a jogger ' s gait in heavy work boots . Right behind Ali , huffing and puffing , came another man , old enough to be his father . He was Norman Mailer , the noted author , who had persuaded Ali to permit him to tag_along . Mailer , short and stocky and dressed in gray sweats , began wheezing and pulled_up , gasping , &quot; Champ ! Champ . . . I ' m going_to . . . I ' m going_to . . . stop. &quot; He doubled_over . On ran Ali , along the desolate pathway , a mile from the city lights of Nsele , away from the presidential compound and the estuary where two splendid craft were moored . One was the Mama Mobutu , a hospital_ship . The other was a three-tiered luxury yacht belonging_to Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga , ruler by revolution of the West_African republic of Zaire , the former Belgian_Congo , and reportedly the world ' s seventh-wealthiest man . Flapping in the riverbank breeze from atop the yacht was the green national_flag of Zaire , with its proud emblem , a hand clutching a torch . It was the stated goal of President Mobutu to expose the rest of civilization to the beauty and resources of his country . That explained why he had personally invited two internationally known figures of Western sport to stage a heavyweight championship fight right there in Zaire , baiting them with a previously unheard-of $ 5 million apiece . Certain things were obvious about Muhammad Ali and his opponent , George Foreman . One was that Ali was very possibly one of the two most famous living Americans of the autumn of 1974 , the other , Richard M . Nixon , having weeks before resigned his position as President . The other was that Ali was no longer champion . Foreman was champion . And two things were as certain of Foreman as could be certain of anyone -- one , that he was as marvelous a specimen of physical manhood as one might find ( and always would be ) , and two , that he was one surly SOB without an ounce of personality or sweetness ( and always would be ) . Mailer wanted to see Foreman ' s block knocked_off and wanted to believe that Ali was still capable of doing so . Yet this was the Ali who had sacrificed his crown to a boycott of the Vietnam_war based on religious_beliefs , and it also was an Ali whose comeback had been interrupted by a wicked hook from Smokin ' Joe Frazier , who with persistence had finally discovered a way to wallop one of the world ' s most elusive butterflies . Ali , quite possibly , was washed_up . Mailer had gone_to Africa to write a nonfiction account of &quot; The Rumble in the Jungle , &quot; as this fight was being advertised by some verbose ex-convict who had somehow talked his way into promoting his first big fight , a numbers runner from Cleveland who had been convicted of manslaughter named Don King . Also there were some of the author ' s contemporaries such_as the Mitty-esque &quot; participatory journalist &quot; George Plimpton , assigned to the exotic location by Sports Illustrated to chronicle his experiences there , and Hunter S . Thompson , the so-called &quot; gonzo journalist &quot; who would eventually forward something to Rolling Stone magazine , soon as he got_back from searching through the jungle for illegal elephant tusks , fugitive war_criminals and Pygmies . Most mornings , some or all_of these correspondents could be found breakfasting at the Hotel Inter-Continental , where , beyond the balustrade , men made music on drums and xylophones . At a typical Inter-Continental breakfast , ceiling fans rotated above , customers sank into wicker plantation chairs and slim bellhops carrying chalkboards bearing messages tinkled Buddhist temple bells to page guests . Thompson , wearing aviator shades and Acapulco shirts and smoking with a cigarette_holder , frequently tipped these bellhops to page R . Nixon or , more often , Martin Bormann , the Nazi war_criminal who , Thompson had become convinced , was hiding out somewhere in the jungle . That morning , Mailer regaled listeners with the tale of his morning roadwork with Ali . After Mailer had stopped , Ali disappeared up a steep grade . The beep of a horn startled Mailer , who was passed_by several members of Ali ' s entourage , following their idol in a Volkswagen van . Mailer gagged on its exhaust . Then , as he began the trudge back to town , from the pitch darkness Mailer heard another noise . Not frogs . Not a horn . This one was low and guttural -- frightening . It came from the nearby dense brush . Mailer paused , then pressed_on . But after one more step , the clearing of a throat became a full-blown roar . The unmistakable roar of a lion . Mailer had seen enough MGM movies to know what one sounded like . He did not care to meet one in_person . By the time he reached the hotel for breakfast , however , his close encounter with the real king of the jungle had taken_on new cosmic significance in Mailer ' s mind . Something had suddenly occurred to this literary luminary -- wow , what a way to go . To be devoured in equatorial Africa by a savage lion , to become its brunch , what better way of meeting one ' s maker ? Particularly one who believed himself so illustrious in life that all he really needed to be immortalized was a dramatic ending . Hemingway had his shotgun . Mailer would have his lion . &quot; Il a nourriture lion ! &quot; said one of the French-speaking Africans who surrounded Mailer ' s table , gabbing excitedly as they translated the writer ' s story . ( &quot; He is the lion ' s food ! &quot; ) And then they began laughing . And so did Plimpton , who finally had to turn_to Mailer , who had no idea what this was all about . &quot; Norman , &quot; Plimpton said . &quot; No lions run free in this part of Africa. &quot; And Mailer said , &quot; You ' re nuts. &quot; Plimpton shook his head . &quot; No , Norman , &quot; he said , breaking the news gently . &quot; What you heard . . . was the Zaire zoo. &quot; Whereupon some of the Africans around the wicker table began laughing again heartily , one of them scratching the air with his hand like a paw and roaring loudly , doing an imitation of a lion . * The fight went_off on Oct . 30 , 1974 , not on schedule . In the weeks after Watergate and the resignation of Nixon , it was a transitional period in America , with war veterans out_of_work as well as their commander_in_chief . Americans were watching &quot; Kojak &quot; suck lollipops on television and listening to Bill Withers ' &quot; Use Me &quot; on the radio and going_to see the new Charles Bronson vigilante flick , &quot; Death Wish , &quot; actually using the word flick . Two days before Nixon quit , a 24-year-old French stuntman named Philippe Petit had toed a tightrope 90 feet between the twin towers of the World Trade Center , 1 # 350 feet above the ground . Nixon , whose situation had been far more precarious for months , climbed into his copter and did the V wave with his fingers , one last time . Days later , the world ' s attention began turning_to a main event planned for Sept . 25 in faraway Kinshasa , Zaire , where , same as he had before fighting Sonny Liston , the pugilistic poet Ali was reciting some of his worst verse ever , while claiming that he would regain the title that was rightfully his . His latest went : &quot; You think the world was shocked &quot; When Nixon resigned ? &quot; Just wait till I whup &quot; George Foreman ' s behind ! &quot; Float like a butterfly &quot; Sting like a bee . &quot; His hands can ' t hit &quot; What his eyes can ' t see ! &quot; Now you see me . &quot; Now you don ' t . &quot; George thinks he will . &quot; But I know he won ' t. &quot; Foreman , like Liston , wasn ' t having any of it . He was distant , sullen . He cared only for his two German_shepherd pups and barely acknowledged his own press_agent except when he needed an opponent for Ping-Pong . Everyone had come_to fear Foreman , whose last act of civility had seemed to be waving a miniature American flag from the ring at the 1968 Summer Olympics , where , as Ali had eight years before , he won a gold medal . On Jan . 22 , 1973 , Foreman knocked_out Joe Frazier , destroyed him really , and seemed not only invulnerable but mean . &quot; You ' re young , you don ' t know what you ' re doing , you just want to knock_down everybody that gets_into your way , &quot; Foreman recalls in his hotel_room in Los Angeles , preparing himself , astoundingly -- almost absurdly -- for another shot at the heavyweight title on Saturday , 20 years from the rumble in the jungle . &quot; There I was in a business specifically made_for guys exactly the opposite of me . Outgoing guys . Promotin ' guys . You take Ali , he was what everybody called a ' classy ' fighter . A ' classic ' boxer . But why was he a classic boxer ? I remember hitting him in maybe the second round . I hit him so hard in the chest , pow ! And he gave me a look_like , ' I ' m not going_to stand here and take this ! ' And I gave him everything I had , and I remember him saying when the round was over ( imitating Ali ' s whisper ) , ' I made_it . I survived. ' &quot; On the day Ali arrived_at the airport for his flight , each of the men in his entourage wore a dashiki , or similar African tunic . The consciousness of being &quot; Afro-American &quot; was at an all-time high . Ali was proud to be associated with a boxing promotion that would involve black athletes , black promoters , black spectators , black politicians , black financiers . He felt fit and happy . Marvin Gaye ' s &quot; Let ' s Get_it On &quot; boomed from the cassette_player one of his bodyguards carried . He expressed no fear of Foreman . He didn ' t mind being a 7-1 underdog . This was the actual day a Pan-Am pilot announced , &quot; Please fasten your seat_belts for takeoff. &quot; And Ali yapped , &quot; Superman don ' t need no seat_belt ! &quot; And a stewardess said , &quot; Superman don ' t need no airplane. &quot; Struck beneath the belt , Ali laughed aloud and enjoyed the transatlantic flight . Behind him , Mailer and Plimpton invented a game to pass the time , one they called &quot; What do he do ? &quot; The object was to figure_out who was whom among Ali ' s entourage -- and who did what ? Plimpton , over lunch 20 years later at a Los Angeles bistro , recounted that one fellow , hired as a chauffeur , was paid $ 50 # 000 for what Ali described as &quot; driving and jiving. &quot; Another was a large man identified simply as Big Black , who was a professional drummer whose job was to beat on a drum whenever Ali landed a punch . &quot; Another fellow was Ali ' s official sweat-taster , &quot; Plimpton added . His what ? &quot; This man ' s job was to sample Ali ' s perspiration after a workout to see if it tasted salty , &quot; Plimpton said . So_much for lunch . At the airport near Kinshasa , a poster of President Mobutu ' s bespectacled face was as large and prominent as Citizen Kane ' s when he ran_for office . On the poster was written : &quot; Un cadeau de President Mobutu au People Zairois. &quot; ( &quot; A gift of President Mobutu to the people of Zaire. &quot; ) And below that : &quot; Et un honneur pour l ' homme noir. &quot; ( &quot; And , an honor for the black man. &quot; ) French had been the official language of this region since King Leopold of Belgium declared it his personal_property in 1884 , yet about two-thirds of the population also spoke Bantu languages -- Hamitic , Nolotic , Sudanic and Pygmy dialects . Off the plane stepped Ali . &quot; My country ! My people ! &quot; he shouted to the gathered throng from atop a portable staircase . Mobutu himself had led a company of soldiers onto the Tarmac , literally rolling_out a red_carpet . Mobutu saluted . &quot; My people ! &quot; Ali continued . &quot; My people gonna put George Foreman in a pot and cook him ! &quot; Translators whispered into Mobutu ' s ears . His expression changed . Such jokes did not amuse him . This was exactly the sort of dated stereotype of Africans by Americans -- even by Afro-Americans -- that infuriated him , that made him invite these fighters to Zaire to demonstrate how cultured and civilized West Africa had become . Ali ' s men yelled : &quot; Right on ! &quot; They shook fists in brotherhood . Mobutu frowned . A translator , Tshimpumpu wa Tshimpumpu , introduced himself . &quot; Greetings on your safe arrival . I will serve as your press attache for the championship fight , &quot; the rotund Tshimpumpu said in excellent English . &quot; On behalf of President Mobutu and our people , welcome ! President Mobutu expresses his desire that I offer our nation ' s hospitality to the celebrated Monsieur Muhammad Ali , but also wishes to reassure you that there will be no cannibals cooking anyone in any pots. &quot; Ali ' s entourage laughed . Mobutu ' s didn ' t . &quot; Bienvenue , &quot; Mobutu said . Welcome to the rumble . * The landscape was lush and green , understandably so for a nation with 50 to 80 inches of rain annually . There were cotton and coffee plantations visible from Ali ' s limo , roadside signs_in both English and French . Four signs_in sequence , like Burma Shave ads , read : &quot; We Want to Be Free. &quot; &quot; Our Road of Progress Must Not Be Impeded. &quot; &quot; Even If We Must Forge Our Way Through Rock. &quot; &quot; Then We Will Forge Our Way Through Rock. &quot; The limo traveled this road into the busy business_district of Kinshasa , population 2.5 million , former vortex of slave and ivory traders , until recently known as Leopoldville . Parakeets , hundreds of them , occupied an enormous cage_in the lobby of the Hotel Inter-Continental . The concierge and other employees wore dark_blue , no-lapel suits known as aboscos . After independence had been won from the Belgians , revolution was followed by a bloody civil_war and public executions were carried_out right here in the hotel , in this very lobby . Now , more fighting had come_to Kinshasa . Two professionals would engage in hand-to-hand combat at the Stade du 20 Mai ( Twentieth of May Stadium , named for independence_day ) , and on the first day these gladiators were introduced to the locals , many of them began a chant that would become familiar in the weeks to come : &quot; Ali bome aye ! &quot; Ali bome aye ! &quot; Mailer recalled turning_to Plimpton to ask what it meant . He was told : &quot; ' Ali . . . kill him ! &quot; ' For his fame , for his nature , Ali had already become the people ' s choice . He had even embraced Mobutu on the stand , finding him rigid . The Zairois loved it . Foreman , meantime , strode into the football_stadium with his two German_shepherds , tall , dark and silent . He gave the leashes to two overweight men accompanying him . Then the crowd parted to let baleful George pass and mount the steps to the stage . Once atop it , Foreman spoke not one word . Instead he peeled_off his warmup jacket , revealing his rippling bare physique . From the audience came an audible gasp . Foreman flexed , striking poses as a bodybuilder would . &quot; Forty fights , 40 victories , 37 knockouts , &quot; Plimpton said , from memory . &quot; Two things about Foreman , &quot; Mailer responded . &quot; He ' ll never have much of a personality , but he ' s got that body. &quot; Oh , how things change . For one , no one envisioned Foreman ever being hurt . He seemed indestructible . At a sparring session , however , Foreman injured his forehead , necessitating a postponement of the fight . This agitated some of the tourists and journalists who had made the long journey , many of whom , Mailer among them , went_home . This also created a disturbance in the Nsele presidential compound of Mobutu , the one adorned with a gigantic pagoda donated to him by his good friends , the Communist Chinese . At the news of the postponement , Mobutu put his armed soldiers on full alert . He considered imprisoning Ali and Foreman , convinced by advisers that Foreman ' s injury was a dodge and that both fighters would return to America without refunding Mobutu ' s money . Ali remained merry . He sang out , &quot; I rassled with a gator ! Tussled with a whale ! I murdered a rock ! Injured a brick ! I ' m so mean I make medicine sick ! &quot; Mobutu ' s men kept_an_eye_on Ali ' s trainer , Angelo Dundee , and his sycophant , Bundini Brown , and even his stunning wife , Belinda Ali , to gauge how restless any of them were getting . No one was to leave Zaire . And further agitating Mobutu was this chatterbox of a promoter , Don King , the great sesquipedalian , who was busy dispensing posters advertising this fight as &quot; The Rumble in the Jungle , &quot; a name of King ' s own creation . That one was fine . But what Mobutu objected to was King ' s other brainstorm , a slogan that went : &quot; From the Slave_Ship to the Championship ! &quot; Mobutu ordered those posters burned . He also burned tickets to the fight on which his name was misspelled . Costs were soaring . There had better be a fight . It was reset for Oct . 30 . * &quot; One fighter is a mute and the other never shuts_up , &quot; Plimpton complained , as he remained behind for 55 days in Zaire . Mailer , back again , had gone slightly mad , stepping_out onto the terrace of his seventh-story room where there was no railing . Mailer said , &quot; I find most of Zaire to have all_the appeal of the Greyhound bus_station in Easton , Pa. &quot; Thompson had taken a boat and a guide upriver toward the Ituri forest . He wanted to buy tusks . He wanted to find Martin Bormann , living_in a hut . He wanted to find a Pygmy and he wanted somebody to tell him if a cobra could eat a Pygmy . Thompson also had taken_to telling people that he was Foreman ' s personal doctor , and that he intended to remove George ' s lymph_glands 24 hours before the fight . Africans nodded . &quot; I went nuts myself , &quot; Foreman recalls . &quot; I was having some crazy dream about my dogs wearing ice_skates . Don ' t ask me why . But then , there really were people out_to get me . People sending up food to my room , tryin ' to make me sick . That was the only way they could beat George , same as today . Pull a trick on George . Use every trick in the book on George . that ' s what Ali did and that ' s what people been doing ever since. &quot; When fight day arrived , Foreman was flustered . He had food-tasters sample every morsel . He sat alone , reading Superman comic_books . He played Ping-Pong with his press_agent , Bill Caplan , but didn ' t speak_to him . Rain_clouds arrived and Foreman ' s mood turned darker . Last-minute repairs had to be made to the ring , including installation of a canopy . Then Ali ' s guy , Dundee , had the ropes adjusted without Foreman ' s knowledge , loosening them . Inexperienced African laborers scrubbed the rosin from the canvas , mistaking it for dirt . Then Foreman suddenly announced the fight was off , unless he was paid_up front for his next fight . Ali was cool as could be . He killed time watching horror movies on TV , hiding his face behind a pillow as &quot; Baron of Blood &quot; with Joseph Cotten came_on . Ali began referring to Foreman as &quot; the Mummy. &quot; He said the films frightened him more_than George did . At ringside , Don Dunphy ' s familiar voice called into a microphone : &quot; It ' s a beautiful evening here in Kinshasa , Zaire , for the heavyweight championship of the world . We ' re ready for the start of what may be an epic battle. &quot; However , it wasn ' t evening . It was 4 a.m. , but it was fight time anyway , thanks to a radio_broadcast and closed-circuit telecast back to the States . Under skies that continued to threaten rain , Ali stepped into the ring wearing white trunks with a black waistband , having passed_on the satin jacket with the map of Zaire on the back that Bundini Brown had begged him to wear . Foreman wore red trunks with a blue band and a &quot; GF &quot; monogram . He looked ferocious . Plimpton said , &quot; I ' m afraid our friend Ali isn ' t going_to win. &quot; Mailer replied , &quot; I ' m afraid our friend Ali isn ' t going_to survive. &quot; Above them , Ali ' s white trunks were pinned against the ropes . And his arms offered no resistance . Foreman was punching Ali ' s torso at will . Ali put_up little defense . Dunphy announced , &quot; This is not the Ali we expect ! He is not floating like a butterfly or stinging like a bee ! &quot; Ali just stood there , getting hit . Mailer said , &quot; Oh , my God. &quot; Plimpton said , &quot; It ' s a fix. &quot; On the apron , in the challenger ' s corner , Bundini Brown began to scream at Ali , &quot; You crazy ? You crazy ? Get_off them ropes ! &quot; But on his stool , as an elegant African maiden in an ankle-length garment carried a card that read &quot; ROUND 2 , &quot; Ali heeded very little of what was being said to him at ringside or in his corner . The fight continued . Mobutu sat_up high , beneath an even larger poster of himself . Hunter Thompson was a no-show , having stayed behind at his hotel , totally strung_out . Thousands of African people implored Ali to do something -- &quot; Ali bome aye ! Ali bome aye ! &quot; -- but all he did was sag against the loose ropes , taking punishment from Foreman ' s massive arms . Foreman , reflecting : &quot; That was my first experience with cowardice as strategy . I hit , I hit , I hit , and he grabbed , he held , he ran . And nobody told Ali once to come_out of his corner and fight . They all said later it was the rope-a-dope -- he laid on that rope and I , like a dope , punched myself out . And all these years later , people still asking me , ' George , isn ' t it smart for a fighter to get_out of the way ? ' And I still say , ' No , I would never be no coward . I got_to face my kids. ' &quot; But it worked . &quot; Oh , don ' t get me wrong , Ali clearly whipped me , &quot; Foreman said , with two decades to think_about it . &quot; It ' s the method that ' s so shameful . No honor in it . Ali was no coward . He did what he had to do , is all. &quot; About Round 7 , Ali struck back . Foreman was exhausted . His punches , even Dunphy observed , lacked the snap of those earlier in the fight . &quot; He did_it on purpose ! &quot; Mailer said . &quot; He made Foreman tire himself out ! &quot; Plimpton asked , &quot; Aren ' t you glad we came ? &quot; Ali ' s personal drummer , Big Black , began keeping time on his conga , bopping it with every Ali punch . Bundini Brown began hopping_up and down . Dunphy shouted , &quot; A right to the jaw and George Foreman goes_down ! &quot; Cut like timber , Foreman toppled face forward . A bald , African-American referee , Zack Clayton , bent over Foreman ' s body and counted to 10 . Ali danced . &quot; He has regained the heavyweight championship of the world ! &quot; Dunphy cried . &quot; Ali has done the impossible ! &quot; And the clouds burst . * A couple of hours later , a convoy of military Jeeps negotiated a muddy road on the Kinshasa outskirts , national_flags waving from each antenna . A reception_line of native sons and daughters , as far as the eye could see , stood protected from the rain by palm fronds . From a Citroen car in the middle of the military_vehicles protruded the arms of Ali , slapping palms with the people he passed . Ali eventually lost his title to Leon Spinks and lost much of his physical prowess and enthusiasm . Foreman quit boxing , became a minister and had many sons , all named George , then returned to boxing . Twice as cheerful and twice as large , he will attempt to regain his championship belt Saturday against Michael Moorer in Las Vegas . He says , &quot; You want to know something funny ? When I ' m with Ali now , I feel_like taking_care of him . Like he ' s my brother and he needs me . Ain ' t life funny ? &quot; Mailer wrote a book about the fight called &quot; The Fight , &quot; then ran_for mayor of New York , unsuccessfully . Plimpton , for his own amusement , boxed a round with Archie Moore , did a movie with John Wayne and played goalie for the Boston Bruins , same as he had once played quarterback for the Detroit Lions . They found Hunter Thompson floating naked in the pool at the hotel after the fight . Thompson squinted into the morning sun , looked_up and asked , &quot; Who won ? &quot;</TEXT>
