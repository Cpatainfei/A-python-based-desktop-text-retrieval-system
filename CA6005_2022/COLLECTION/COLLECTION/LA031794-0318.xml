   <HEADLINE> SEC TO TIGHTEN ADVISER RULES TO SHIELD INVESTORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday that it plans to tighten rules on investment_advisers in an effort to increase consumer protections and loosen a congressional logjam that appears to be stalling pivotal legislation . The new rules would prohibit investment_advisers from making unsuitable recommendations to their clients and would bar them from making investment decisions in client accounts unless the client is receiving periodic account_statements directly from an independent custodian . In explaining the account_statement rule , SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt cited the case of Steven Wymer , a California investment_adviser who defrauded his clients of more_than $ 100 million by falsifying their account_statements . If an independent custodian had been required to send statements to the clients rather than to Wymer , the fraud would have been quickly detected , Levitt said . SEC insiders hope the rules will shake loose a congressional logjam that is stalling far more pivotal reform . The quarterly statement and recommendation issues were items of contention between House and Senate conferees attempting to pass the Investment_Adviser Act .</TEXT>
