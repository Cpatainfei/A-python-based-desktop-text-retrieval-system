   <HEADLINE> THE GATT VOTE : IMPACT ON BUSINESS ; GATT IS LOOKING GOOD TO CALIFORNIA ; COMMERCE : IT HAS MORE GLOBAL TRADE THAN ANY OTHER STATE . FROM TOYS TO RICE , THE ACCORD WILL MEAN MORE BUSINESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For all_the talk_about opening foreign markets and leveling the playing_field for U.S. trade , the world trade accord will mean one thing to Barbara Willey , an executive with Woodland Hills toy importer Applause Inc. : cold cash . Because the pact will cut or eliminate U.S. duties on imported toys , &quot; over a period of five or six years we could have a savings of easily $ 1.3 million , &quot; she said . that ' s a substantial sum for a firm with annual sales of about $ 300 million . For California almond growers , who represent about 99 % of the $ 800-million U.S. industry , the new accord will cut tariffs on exports to Europe and Asia . Because almond farmers export about 70 % of their crop , GATT translates into $ 40 million to $ 45 million annually in new business or savings from lower tariffs , said Walt Payne , president of Blue Diamond Growers , the state ' s largest producer of the nuts . All over California , which has more international trade than any other state , makers of everything from Barbie dolls to integrated circuits stand to gain from Congress ' ratification of the new trade accord under GATT , the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . Meanwhile , importers of toys , fabrics and others goods_will pay lower prices . That means foreign consumers will pay less , for example , for a six-pack of American beer , while Americans will pay less for stuffed animals made in the Far East . The agreement will benefit some California industries more_than others . It will lower tariffs and other trade_barriers during the next several years on agricultural products , beer , wine , semiconductors , furniture , drugs , medical_instruments and other items going abroad . But for some businesses , the accord will have only indirect benefits . The agreement for the first time will remove trade_barriers to financial services such_as banking and insurance . But nothing will happen right away : GATT simply sets_in_motion a process to open_up foreign markets in the future . Consumer advocates worry that the accord ' s creation of a new_World Trade Organization , which will rule on trade disputes , will set the stage for attacks on California ' s environmental , labor and consumer laws . &quot; We think . . . laws in California are particular lightning_rods for challenges &quot; as impediments to trade , said Andrew Wheat , head of an anti-GATT group founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader . But for a host of California firms , GATT will mean business . State rice farmers can look_forward to boosting exports by a third , sending 200 # 000 metric_tons of rice a year to Japan alone as that nation opens its rice markets to imports . South_Korea has also agreed to U.S. imports . New rice exports will translate into $ 100 million a year for state farmers , and every 1 # 000 additional tons shipped roughly translates into two new jobs , said Bill Huffman , a spokesman for the Farmers ' Rice Cooperative in Sacramento . GATT also promises to strengthen protections of intellectual property_rights for products such_as software . that ' s important for Amgen , the Thousand Oaks biotech company that has genetically engineered a line of drugs for cancer and kidney dialysis patients . Amgen , which sells about 20 % of its products overseas , looks_forward to the protections GATT promises as it contemplates entering new markets in Latin_America and Asia , where copyright laws are weak or not enforced , company spokesman Peter Teeley said . For exporters such_as Douglas Aircraft Co. , the Long_Beach maker of commercial jets such_as the MD-11 , the accord will level the playing_field against its European rival , Airbus Industrie . that ' s because the World Trade Organization will have more clout than previous groups to resolve trade disputes , and European officials will no longer be able to ignore trade-body rulings if they favor Douglas over Airbus , as they have in the past , spokesman Tom Williams said . But does the new accord automatically mean Douglas will sell more jets ? Not necessarily , Williams acknowledged . &quot; We ' re more dependent_on the market , &quot; he said . &quot; Exports have been . . . slow due_to the worldwide economic downturn . . . in commercial aviation. &quot; The domestic textile and apparel_industry stands to lose under new provisions of GATT that phase_out U.S. barriers to imports of products produced in low-wage nations . For Los Angeles , one of the centers of the U.S. garment industry , the concern is that a flood of cheap imports will create competitive pressures . Still , said George Rudes , owner of Los Angeles women ' s sportswear maker Saint Germain , the industry here has faced low-priced imports for years and is surviving because of inherent advantages : quicker delivery times and better design and quality . And GATT could create some advantages . Manufacturers such_as Saint Germain could buy cheaper imported fabric from overseas . And increased international trade could boost the U.S. economy , increasing general demand for clothing . * INDUSTRY IMPACT : D2 * MAIN STORY : A1</TEXT>
