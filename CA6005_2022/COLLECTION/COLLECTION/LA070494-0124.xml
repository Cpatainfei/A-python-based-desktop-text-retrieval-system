   <HEADLINE> ENVELOPE RAISES ETHICS ISSUES IN SIMPSON CASE ; COURTS : ATTORNEY OBLIGATIONS , NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE ARE DEBATED . PROSECUTOR VISITS VICTIM ' S CONDOMINIUM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell came_to court Friday with a bulky yellow envelope produced by defense_attorneys for O.J. Simpson , she set_off a weekend of speculation that it contained dramatic evidence in the celebrated murder case . Numerous observers hypothesized that it was a knife ; some assumed the development was worrisome for Simpson . &quot; The only time I ' ve seen defense_lawyers turn_over evidence is when it is incriminating or at least ambiguous , &quot; said Los Angeles defense_lawyer Harland W . Braun . But other legal_experts said that even if the mystery envelope contains a knife , that may_not be harmful to the former football star . They noted there is a long line of cases holding that defense_attorneys have to turn_over physical evidence that may be relevant to a crime -- including evidence that may help their case . &quot; While a defense_lawyer has no obligation to go find evidence for the prosecution , that lawyer has a high ethical duty , &quot; said Loyola University law professor Laurie Levenson . &quot; The lawyer may_not know how important something is , but if it ' s possible that it ' s relevant , the lawyer has to turn it over so he cannot be accused of hiding evidence. &quot; Although sources have indicated that the envelope contains a knife -- much like one that witnesses described selling to Simpson in May -- there is no guarantee that any details about it will be revealed when the preliminary hearing resumes Tuesday morning . Investigators and attorneys worked over the holiday weekend . Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark , the lead prosecutor , and Los Angeles Police Detective Tom Lange , the lead investigator , spent about two hours at Nicole Brown Simpson ' s condominium Sunday morning . Neither would discuss what took them there , but Clark had earlier visited Simpson ' s home to familiarize herself with the grounds and other details that could prove important to court arguments . And despite reports that the knife described in court was already in court custody , Los Angeles police said their hunt for a murder weapon continues . Police sources said they remained skeptical that a knife found by a passerby near O.J. Simpson ' s home Saturday will turn_out to be that weapon . Two things make them suspicious , they said : The area where the knife was found had been searched just one day earlier , and the newly discovered knife does not appear to be the weapon that killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman . The blade of the kitchen knife is slightly longer and wider than the one that investigators believe inflicted the fatal wounds , one source said . Also on Sunday , F . Lee Bailey , one of Simpson ' s attorneys , visited Simpson at the Men ' s Central Jail Downtown . Bailey was accompanied by Simpson ' s adult children from his first marriage , Jason and Arnelle , as well as his friend and personal attorney , Robert Kardashian . None would comment on the visit . Simpson defense_lawyer Robert L . Shapiro has declined comment about the envelope produced in court Friday . What is known is that Shapiro gave it first to a Los Angeles Superior_Court judge to review in private . Cecil J . Mills , the presiding judge of the Superior_Court , then became aware of its existence and made a brief stop in the courtroom where Kennedy-Powell is presiding over Simpson ' s preliminary hearing . Soon after , she left the bench briefly , went_to her chambers and returned to court with the envelope -- announcing that she planned to open it . Both Shapiro and prosecutor Clark immediately objected to any disclosure of the contents , however , and the judge put_off disclosure pending further proceedings . Because the envelope materialized just a day after a sales clerk from a Downtown cutlery store testified that he sold Simpson a 15-inch stiletto knife on May 3 , many theorized that the envelope contained that knife or one similar to it . Among those expressing this view was Leslie Abramson , the Los Angeles defense_lawyer who represents another prominent accused murderer , Erik Menendez . &quot; My guess is . . . it ' s the knife that Mr. Simpson purchased , &quot; she said Sunday on ABC ' s &quot; This Week with David Brinkley. &quot; &quot; And I base that -- not just because it ' s wishful_thinking and it would be the greatest theater , but in looking_at the envelope , it does seem to have a linear object inside. &quot; Abramson and several other criminal defense_lawyers said in interviews with The Times on Sunday that they try to avoid coming_into possession of any evidence that could incriminate their client -- and thus would have to be turned_over to authorities . &quot; You don ' t want to become an investigating officer against your own client , &quot; she said . To illustrate the potential problems a lawyer may encounter , Abramson cited an incident a decade ago when she was representing one of two men accused of murdering a Northridge family of four who disappeared without a trace . Abramson and her private_investigator went_to a remote hilly area in the Antelope Valley , where a sheet from the bed of one of the missing children had been found . &quot; My investigator gets_out of his Honda Accord , opens the trunk and takes_out a shovel . I said , ' What do you intend to do with the shovel ? ' He said , ' I don ' t think the police have done a thorough search . I ' m going_to dig. ' Abramson continued , &quot; I said , ' Oh , really . And what are you going_to do if you find something ? ' &quot; He said , ' What do you mean ? ' I said , ' If you disturb any evidence , including the bodies , then we have to use your car phone to call the police . What if what we find hurts our client ? Who will represent him ? &quot; She recalled that she finally directed the investigator : &quot; We ' re not doing this . Put the shovel away. &quot; Along the same line , Braun said : &quot; If I go_to a crime scene and see a knife or a gun that may have been used and I don ' t do anything , just leave it there , I don ' t have any duty to report it . The theory is I haven ' t affected the prosecution ' s case by doing anything to hide the weapon . But if I were to pick_up the weapon and take it back to my office and it is potentially incriminating , I have an ethical duty to turn it over to the prosecution. &quot; In explaining his belief that evidence turned_over by the Simpson defense may be damaging to Simpson , Braun asserted that a lawyer does not have to be &quot; hyper-ethical &quot; and turn_over evidence that is not incriminating . In fact , he said , such an action can unfairly help prosecutors , enabling them to alter their theory of the case . Nevertheless , some legal observers , including Abramson , have speculated that Simpson ' s lawyers expect to use the contents of the envelope to aid his defense -- perhaps by showing that it was not used in the crime . Most legal_experts agree , however , that when in doubt , a defense_attorney should turn_over physical evidence . &quot; If a lawyer comes_into possession of physical evidence , the attorney is not allowed to keep it , hide it , alter it or destroy it , &quot; said University of Southern California law professor Erwin Chemerinsky . He and others cited a series of relevant cases . In 1964 , for instance , the Washington Supreme Court ruled that a lawyer had to turn_over a knife that might have been used in a murder . In 1967 , a Virginia federal_court upheld an 18-month suspension of an attorney who failed to turn_over money his client had stolen in a bank robbery and a gun used in the robbery . And just two months ago , a California appellate_court upheld the murder_conviction of a man after incriminating notes related to the crime were given by the defendant ' s lawyer to a judge -- who turned them over to the prosecutor . Chemerinsky said most courts have drawn a critical distinction between physical evidence and information that an attorney learns from interviews or other research . Although the hard evidence must be turned_over , information does not have to be , he said . In the real_world , however , the decision-making often is not so clear-cut . Sometimes , an attorney may find himself in a situation where he suddenly is presented with evidence , Chemerinsky noted -- as when a client walks into his office and proclaims , &quot; Here ' s the knife ! &quot; The attorney then can say , &quot; Don ' t give it to me , &quot; he said . The attorney cannot tell the client to hide or destroy the knife . Nor can the lawyer advise him to turn it over to the police , because that would incriminate the client . It is even unclear whether the lawyer can give the client any advice about what he should do with the knife , Chemerinsky said . &quot; that ' s the client ' s problem . The lawyer shouldn ' t make_it his problem. &quot; &quot; This is the classic ethical dilemma , &quot; agreed Los Angeles criminal defense_lawyer Barry Tarlow . Santa Monica criminal defense_lawyer Gerald L . Chaleff , who has handled several high-profile murder cases , said practical considerations -- as well as ethical ones -- come_into play in these situations . &quot; You don ' t want to put your client in a position where it looks_like anything you did was wrong so that it ( works ) to his detriment . If it ' s a knife or a gun and it looks_like you ' re trying to hide it , it may make something that is innocuous , neutral or even beneficial to your case look sinister , &quot; said Chaleff , who is president of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn . &quot; In this kind of case , if you come_into possession of evidence that ' s positive for your client , you may_not want to hold onto it because people could claim you manipulated it , &quot; he added . In general , courts have held that the attorney-client_privilege protecting confidential conversations between a defendant and his lawyer does not apply to physical evidence , such_as a weapon or stolen money . Nevertheless , when a defense_lawyer turns_over such evidence , in most instances courts have held that when it is introduced in court , the prosecutor is not allowed to tell jurors how the evidence was obtained . As a consequence , it is possible that there never will be a public revelation of what was in the now-famous yellow envelope -- the evidence simply may appear in court as one of a string of exhibits . Levenson said she was surprised that Judge Kennedy-Powell &quot; announced in open court that she had the envelope and said she was going_to open it , &quot; before both prosecution and defense_lawyers objected . &quot; What happened in court Friday would naturally cause people to speculate , &quot; Levenson said . &quot; If there was any matter_to handle in chambers , it would seem like this one. &quot; But other lawyers said that with such intense public interest in the case , the judge may have been wary about doing anything that might make her look as if she were trying to keep something hidden . And despite the weekend ' s attention to the contents of the envelope and a passerby ' s discovery of the kitchen knife near Simpson ' s Brentwood home , prosecutors have indicated that their case does not depend_on finding the murder weapon . Rather , they have emphasized forensic tests that could place the former football star at the murder scene . Although police conceded that in earlier searches of the area they may have overlooked the knife found wrapped in a polka-dot blouse , they noted that it was lying_in a place where it was easily spotted -- and this makes them doubt that it will prove to be the murder weapon , which has been the subject of an intense search for weeks . Lab tests were incomplete Sunday . The tests will first attempt to determine whether red stains on the knife are human blood . If so , they will then be tested to determine whether the blood_type matches that of either victim or Simpson , police sources said . If anything , the kitchen knife drew even more of the curious to Brentwood on Sunday , where spectators lined the sidewalk across Bundy Street from the condominium . &quot; I know everyone in the neighborhood is annoyed , &quot; said Geri Sluder , vacationing here with her three children . &quot; But we ' re from North Carolina . We don ' t have many things like this happen . &quot; I want them to see her house , and see she was a real person. &quot; Meanwhile , the woman who found the blouse-wrapped knife wishes she had never seen it , her sister said . Debbie Gonzalez said her sister Daniella , 21 , has had nightmares after giving the knife to police . She said police behaved very skeptically toward her sister , saying &quot; You know , this is a serious matter. &quot; Now , Debbie Gonzalez says , Daniella is afraid she will become the object of public skepticism and even wrath . Times staff writers Andrea Ford and Nick Riccardi and Times researchers Julia Franco and Joyce Pinney contributed to this story .</TEXT>
