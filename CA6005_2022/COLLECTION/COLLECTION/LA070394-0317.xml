   <TEXT> &quot; No matter how many times you have seen the entrance of the bullfighters , it is always a thrilling experience . They come_out not in single_file , for that would denigrate the fellow in last position , but side_by_side , as if all were equal , which is the case as the fight begins . &quot; -- &quot; MEXICO &quot; By James Michener So it will be Tuesday , in the late afternoon shadows of an American_football stadiumin New Jersey , when the current matadors of Mexico enter side_by_side , as if they were equal , which will be the case as the fight begins . Their names are Luis Garcia and Jorge Campos , and unlike the fictional Victoriano Leal and Juan Gomez of Michener ' s 1960s Mexico , their opponent will not be life-threatening or possess razor-sharp horns . But in the World Cup soccer game that Garcia and Campos will play against Bulgaria , there will be many of the same elements of cultural passion that Michener threads through his story of two bullfighters . The people and the plot are fiction . The essence of the place , Mexico , is not . From well before the start of this monthlong World Cup , to its current point in the round of 16 , the path of Mexico ' s soccer team has been an emotional roller_coaster . that ' s not just for the team , but for its country , which , as much as any soccer-mad place , ebbs and flows with its football failure and success . On June 4 , Mexico came_to the Rose Bowl to play the U.S. national team in &quot; a friendly. &quot; That means the match doesn ' t matter in any sort of official qualifying , but is listed in the team record . This one mattered greatly , no matter how it was labeled . A crowd of 91 # 123 turned_out , and while that was the largest gathering ever to see the U.S. team play_on U.S. soil , the crowd was clearly there to see the team the United States was playing . The Arroyo was a sea of green , orange and white ; the colors of the Mexican flag , and the flag itself , dominated the scene . With two weeks to the World Cup opener , it was a dress_rehearsal for Mexico . It was the last full-makeup run-through before its return to the international soccer scene after an embarrassing eight-year absence caused by a disqualification from the 1990 World Cup . The Mexican Soccer Federation had sent a team to a junior tournament , and some of the team members weren ' t all that junior . The Mexicans had lied_about some of the players ' ages , and FIFA , the same international sanctioning group that fines coaches thousands of dollars for harmless arguments with referees and suspends players for not standing properly in_line for free_kicks , booted Mexico from the 1990 World Cup . No matter that Mexico was the soccer power of this section of the world . No matter that Mexico had been host to the World Cup in Mexico_City only four years earlier and had run a generally successful event for FIFA after Colombia had backed_out . With FIFA , history has made things like that clear : March at high_noon with its officials and they will always draw first and step easily over the fallen body . It had been a long road back to June 4 in the Rose Bowl , and one of the bumps along the way had been the replacement as coach of popular Luis Menotti with Miguel Mejia Baron . Baron was a former dentist and a protege of U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic , Mexico ' s coach in the ' 86 Cup . The day was hot , the fans were torrid and the Mexican team was awful in a 1-0 loss . Losing in soccer is one thing , even in a friendly . But losing to a country that has demonstrated success with its feet only on &quot; American Bandstand &quot; was reason for shame . The Mexican flags and their carriers slinked off into the sunset , unhappy and fearful of the important days ahead . On June 19 , Mexico played Norway in its first of three games in Group E that had quickly , upon its creation at the World Cup soccer draw_in late December in Las Vegas , taken_on the nickname &quot; Group of Death. &quot; Besides Mexico and Norway , the group included soccer power Italy and dark_horse Ireland . When the draw took_place , Mexico had expected -- some said been assured -- that it would end_up in a group headquartered in Dallas . That would put it very close to a huge friendly fan base . When the Mexicans heard they were in a group with Ireland and Italy and would play their games along an Eastern seaboard much more heavily populated with Irish and Italian fans , their soccer contingent marched_out of the Las Vegas Convention Center in a huff . Six months later , after their 1-0 embarrassment in the Rose Bowl , they marched_out again in a huff , exiting the Rose Bowl through a back_door with nary a word to the press . A team in a sulk played Norway June 19 and lost , 1-0 . Aging Hugo Sanchez , one of only two Mexicans playing in Europe in the prestigious Spanish League , hadn ' t played against the United States on June 4 , but faced Norway . Only weeks short of his 36th birthday , Sanchez looked slow and ineffective . The second-guessing of Mejia Baron was in full bloom . But Mexican fans arrived in_force in Orlando on June 24 for the second game in the group . On one of the many planes in , a stockbroker from Monterrey who had made his connection in Dallas , tried to think positively . &quot; I do not think we will win , but I want us so_much to , because soccer means so_much to my country , &quot; said Mauricio Calderon . &quot; My father planned this trip for so_long , so we come , even after Norway. &quot; At the game , there were fewer Mexican flags than in the Rose Bowl on June 4 , but thousands of shirts and hats that read : &quot; Confia en Mexico. &quot; Believe in Mexico . Have faith in Mexico , in our team . It was almost a plea . Then , in the 44th minute against Ireland , it all seemed to turn_around . Garcia , 11 years younger than Sanchez , was moved to the right-side forward position , from his normal striker spot . Sanchez was_on the bench . Carlos Hermosillo , who hadn ' t played against Norway , shoveled a neat little pass just outside the penalty_box and dead center to the goal . Garcia lashed the ball past Irish goalkeeper Pat Bonner . Mexico had gone from June 4 until the waning moments of the first_half of the Ireland game 20 days later -- probably close to 240 minutes of play , including injury time -- with nary a goal . As players piled on Garcia in celebration , you could almost feel an entire country breathe a sigh of relief . Garcia scored again in the second_half . Mexico had a 2-1 lead and all_the healing that a World Cup victory would bring was close_at_hand . But then Andy Townsend , Ireland ' s sandy-haired captain and midfielder , got an opening just outside the box and to the left of goal in the 81st minute . He sent a screaming , dipping shot that had a real chance until goalkeeper Campos darted left and directed the ball wide of the net . The 2-1 victory was preserved . That night , the fans went_to Church Street Station in Orlando and celebrated well into the morning hours . Suddenly , there were more flags again and fewer of the &quot; Confia en Mexico &quot; hats and shirts . They believed again . They had lived another day in the Group of Death . Garcia and Campos had taken red capes and swords and subdued the enemy . Last Monday , the day before Mexico was to play Italy in Washington in its last game of group play , a youngster headed for the metal detector in the Orlando airport . He was perhaps 10 years old , and he wore a sombrero with a huge rim . As he stepped through the metal detector , the hat was brushed_off . He tried once , twice , then a third time . The sombrero was too wide . Undeterred , he tried a fourth time , tilting his head just enough and slipping through . His family , laughing as they watched , saluted his final success in bullfighting terms : &quot; Ole ! Ole ! Pedro. &quot; Against Italy , Garcia and Campos , now clearly the team ' s matadors , played beautifully , but Italy scored first . With Ireland and Norway playing simultaneously in Giants Stadium and heading for a 0-0 tie that would leave each with four points in the final group standings , a loss by Mexico would leave it with three points and Italy with six , meaning Mexico would be out . But the Mexican fans were there in full force , believing_in Mexico . As their team ' s short passing_game got clicking , they greeted each movement with a rhythmic &quot; Ole ! Ole ! Ole ! &quot; And suddenly Marcelino Bernal connected with a 25-yard shot that not only brought the eventual 1-1 tie , but placed Mexico atop Group E ' s final standings . Tuesday , Mexico can make history . Never has a Mexican soccer team advanced to the quarterfinals outside of the World Cups held_in its country in 1970 and 1986 . The leaders , of course , will be Garcia and Campos , legends now from Cancun to Guadalajara . In Michener ' s book , Victoriano Leal is the Spaniard , the finesse bullfighter with grace and careful style and the lighter complexion of his Basque roots ; Juan Gomez is the Mexican Indian through and through , a rough-skinned rogue with strength and power and a thirst for the thrill and danger of living on the edge . Luis Garcia mirrors Michener ' s Leal , Jorge Campos mirrors Michener ' s Gomez . Whether the fight is with bulls or Bulgarians , Mexico worships its warriors . Tuesday , in Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands of New Jersey , Garcia and Gomez will enter , side_by_side , as equals , the Spaniard and the Mexican Indian , their country ' s soccer matadors as the fight begins . Ole ! Mexico .</TEXT>
