   <HEADLINE> SHAKEN TRUST ; BUSINESS OWNER SAYS QUAKE AID RULES LET MANY FALL THROUGH CRACKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I feel_like I ' ve been rolled and pleated I can ' t prove it , but I think I was cheated I woke_up without a single dime And I swear on my horse , I have seen the light If I had a horse , I would be alright But now it ' s time to move_on down the line . &quot; -- &quot; Only Game in Town &quot; by Ronn Crowder Ronn Crowder , an aspiring country musician and songwriter , need look no further than his own life for the stuff of mournful blues and blue collar tragedy . Moving from Tennessee to the San Fernando Valley in 1981 , Crowder bought a home and established his own typesetting business , only to see his life wrecked by the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake . He has filed for personal bankruptcy -- in which he will probably lose his house -- and now plans to move_back to Tennessee next month . He and his wife , Linda , and their two sons , Clayton , 12 , and Ronnie , 7 , are selling most of their personal belongings at weekend yard sales , both to raise money for groceries and because they cannot afford to take much with them on the drive_back to Tennessee . Crowder , 47 , seeks no pity , but he is angry and frustrated that after years of being a good citizen and taxpayer , he seems to have fallen_through the cracks of a system that is supposed to help people get_back on their feet after a disaster like the 6.8 quake that damaged his home and business equipment . He didn ' t lose everything in the quake like many others did , but $ 18 # 000 in damage to his modest two-bedroom home and another $ 3 # 000 to his typesetting equipment in a home_office is a bigger loss than he can handle without help . * He received a $ 1 # 400 grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency , but he has been turned_down by every_other government_agency to which he has turned for help . &quot; We ' ve never asked_for any of this stuff before , &quot; Crowder said Saturday during a break from trying to sell clothing and other odds and ends from his front_yard . &quot; I ' m baffled . I don ' t understand any of it . &quot; It ' s like I ' ve fallen_through the cracks of the system . We were part of the middle-class tax_base . When we really needed it , the system failed us . All those years we were good citizens , paying our taxes and not breaking the law . . . that don ' t mean anything ? &quot; FEMA officials respond that government disaster assistance was never meant as a replacement for private insurance . Other_than FEMA grants that averaged about $ 2 # 500 to take_care of immediate short-term housing needs and repairs right after the quake , most government assistance comes_in the form of loans from the Small Business Administration . But loans are expected to be paid_back , said SBA spokeswoman Diane Brady , so the agency withholds loans from those who appear unable to pay . &quot; That is the most common reason someone is declined , &quot; Brady said . In fact , almost half the applications for aid are rejected , according to government figures . As of June 18 , only about 67 # 000 of 124 # 000 applications processed for personal and family SBA loans were approved . Only about 9 # 500 of 17 # 000 business applications were approved , and only 1 # 600 of 6 # 500 applications were approved in a separate program that provides working capital for companies that lost business as a result of the quake . Still , the SBA has provided quake victims with a combined total of nearly $ 2.3 billion in loans . Crowder , however , calls his a classic Catch-22 situation . &quot; I don ' t have the cash flow ( to repay a loan ) because I don ' t have my equipment , and I don ' t have my equipment because I can ' t get a loan to fix it or replace it , &quot; Crowder said . Crowder and his family moved to Los Angeles 13 years ago to fulfill his dream of becoming a musician and songwriter . But recognizing that would take time , he enrolled at Los Angeles Valley College in Van Nuys and studied journalism . After graduating , he was offered a job as a reporter at a local newspaper for $ 250 a week , but realized that would not house and feed his wife and two children . As part of his journalism studies , Crowder had learned about typesetting . He worked for a_few years for a typesetting company , then in 1986 he started his own business and bought a small house in Panorama City . After many of his clients went_out of business following the 1992 riots , Crowder received a $ 21 # 000 SBA loan designed to help riot-impacted businesses , and slowly started to rebuild his client base . Then the Northridge earthquake hit , damaging most of his business equipment . Like tens of thousands of others , he applied for disaster assistance . After receiving a FEMA grant for $ 1 # 400 to make immediate repairs_to his home , he expected to qualify for another SBA loan . But earlier this month , he was notified that his loan was denied because SBA officials didn ' t believe he could repay it . Meanwhile , Crowder ' s wife , Linda , 35 , had been fired from her job with the Federal_Reserve_Bank in April after 13 years because she began making mistakes , which she blames on fatigue from working overtime to make_up for their lost income and nerves rattled by the continuing aftershocks . After the SBA turndown , Crowder ' s application was forwarded to the state Individual and Family Grant Program , a last_resort , bare-minimum disaster assistance program , which could not help him because he was self-employed . * A spokeswoman for the IFGP confirmed that business losses for self-employed people are not covered under the program , which is designed to cover only immediate survival needs . &quot; Wait a minute , this is America , &quot; Crowder commented . &quot; You ' re going to penalize me because I ' m self-employed ? What happened to rewarding initiative ? &quot; Crowder could not turn_to the state ' s CALDAP program , a last_resort loan program for homeowners , because voters this month turned_down a bond measure that would have provided money for it . He did receive a voucher from the Red_Cross to buy a new stove . But he had to turn_down an offer from Habitat for Humanity , a nonprofit group that helps low-income families build homes , to provide the labor to fix his damaged roof because he can ' t afford the materials . Behind in house and car payments , the credit_cards charged to the limit and running_out of money , the Crowders filed for bankruptcy in May to stave_off creditors and give them time to rethink their future . They applied for help from the county Aid to Families with Dependent Children program , but when they admitted they had a $ 10 # 000 retirement account , they were denied help until that money was exhausted . Roberta Kiehl , AFDC program administrator for Los Angeles County , said program recipients are limited to $ 2 # 000 in property , including bank and retirement accounts . &quot; But we couldn ' t touch that money because if we withdrew it , then under the bankruptcy filing they would take it to pay the creditors , &quot; explained Crowder , adding that he is in debt nearly $ 200 # 000 , including a $ 150 # 000 mortgage . But while his finances are falling_apart , Crowder ' s music career may finally be coming_together . He has signed with personal manager Rob E . Brondell and record producer Danny Sheridan , contacts he made while performing at a fund-raiser the day before the Northridge quake and again while helping clean_up Sheridan ' s quake-damaged recording_studio . Crowder plans to continue both his typesetting business and his pursuit of a music career in Tennessee , and is trying to make the move a positive experience , both for himself and his family . &quot; This experience has brought us all closer together , &quot; he said . &quot; The boys were back in their room sorting_out their toys to see which ones they were willing to sell . It ' s kind of neat . They were showing their family spirit . Of course , I would n ' t make them sell anything they didn ' t really want to. &quot; Despite having to start over , Crowder remains upbeat . &quot; The things we are losing are just material things , &quot; he said . &quot; You lose a little face , but there was nothing else we could do . We did our best . So what ' s to feel bad about ? &quot; I don ' t want to be depicted as poor , poor pitiful people . we ' ll be OK . But I hope that FEMA and the SBA will fill those cracks that we and a lot of other people have fallen_through . &quot; When people like us are totally denied by everybody , then geez , there something wrong. &quot;</TEXT>
