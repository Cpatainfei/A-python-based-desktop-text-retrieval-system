   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; FOR NORTH_KOREA ' S RULING ELITE , ALL ROADS MAY LEAD TO DOOM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the two weeks since the death of North_Korean dictator Kim Il Sung , it seems we have swung from fears of nuclear Armageddon to &quot; All My Children. &quot; Speculation on what really makes Kim Jong Il tick , and gossip about reputed palace intrigue between him and his stepmother , half-brother and uncle , have dominated assessments of North_Korea . It is great fun -- and mostly beside the point . Whether or not Kim Jong Il is a Scotch-swilling playboy hooked on Daffy Duck cartoons , a ruthless terrorist or a cool technocrat -- or all_the above -- there are certain political and economic imperatives driving North_Korean behavior that offer a more useful framework for understanding what ' s going_on . It is these larger issues , the interplay between North_Korean political dynamics and efforts to resolve the nuclear issue that will shape the answer to the $ 64 # 000 question : Is North_Korea now more or less likely to agree to a deal ending its nuclear-weapons program ? Will the new regime in Pyongyang reprocess the fuel rods sitting in cooling ponds and obtain enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear bombs ? Or will it cooperate in the disposal of the rods ? So far , events have not been revealing . The funeral and transition have seemingly gone according to script . A socialist family dynasty may seem odd , but Kim Jong Il is the designated successor to the only leader North_Korea has known since 1945 . Although he lacks the nationalist credibility of his father , Kim Jong Il is the principal source of what shreds of political legitimacy remain in North_Korea . Any clique seeking power would almost certainly have to operate in his name , at least in the first months following the transition . Indeed , the range of possibilities runs from Kim Jong Il being a mere figurehead of a coalition of party-bureaucratic-military forces to being its leader . The dictator ' s death has not altered Pyongyang ' s basic problems : a failing political_system ; an economy that has grown roughly 5 % in the last four years ; a population asked to eat only two meals a day ; desertion of its longstanding allies , Moscow and Beijing , and isolation from the information age and East Asian economic miracle . But the nuclear issue remains the determining factor . The powers-that-be in North_Korea face the same grim choices : They can continue their nuclear-weapons program and face even greater isolation , U.N. sanctions and almost certain collapse ; or they can trade their nuclear ambitions in_for a package of political and economic engagement with the United States and the broader international community . The latter course would require the most totalitarian , hermetically sealed society on Earth to open_up , thus jeopardizing the political futures of the leaders who would take that road . Yet , despite its frequent characterization as a &quot; crazy state , &quot; North_Korea may be more rational than commonly thought . The elite of Kim Jong Il ' s generation appear perplexed about which course to follow . Diplomatically , they play a terrible hand quite brilliantly . After all , for two years , they have danced diplomatic circles_around Washington , defying the non-proliferation regime with impunity . What ' s more , in moves associated with Kim Jong Il , even as the nuclear drama unfolded , Pyongyang devised new foreign-investment , tax and foreign-currency laws and established Chinese-style special economic zones . Their objective is to lure foreign capital and technology to revive the moribund economy without risking political control . So far , efforts to attract outside investment have had few takers . But that Pyongyang is toying_with reform , however haltingly , suggests two things : they are listening to advice from Beijing , and some segments of the elite are aware of their system ' s failings . The problem is that the regime has not adopted internal market incentives or loosened control over the economy , as have China and Vietnam . Pyongyang has been equally unwilling to relax its hold_on information : Although South_Korean companies would be prime candidates to invest in the North , there are no direct commercial-phone or mail services between the two . It is certainly arguable that improving the living conditions of the 22 million North_Koreans will be a factor_in whatever legitimacy a post-Kim Il Sung regime attains . But therein lies the central dilemma confronting Pyongyang : If it doesn ' t open_up , it is doomed ; if it does open_up , it may lose political control and suffer an ignominious fate like that of Kim Il Sung ' s old friend Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania . What does all this have to do with the nuclear issue ? Plenty . If the North is unwilling , or unable , to reform and open_up , even in a limited way , and begin a course of economic interaction with the West , then neither the Clinton_Administration nor South_Korea nor Japan , nor all combined , can ever muster enough incentives to persuade Pyongyang to give_up its nuclear-weapons program . The hypotheses swirling around Kim Jong Il will soon be tested by the momentum of events : Will he reprocess the fuel rods ? How will he respond to a U.S. package deal and when U.S.-North Korea negotiators meet Aug . 5 in Geneva ? Will he hold the North-South summit his father proposed ? Until we have answers , do what Ronald Reagan once said of the Soviet_Union : Trust , but verify. *</TEXT>
