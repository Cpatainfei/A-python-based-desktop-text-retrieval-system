   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; COMPLEXITY OF DEBACLE HAMSTRINGS SUPERVISORS ; BANKRUPTCY : LEADERS CONCEDE ECONOMIC WOES ARE BAFFLING . BUT SOME OBSERVERS PRAISE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN SO FAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One is a child-care expert who last owned a bond in World_War_II . It was a savings bond . Another is far more familiar_with writing an arrest report than a collateral call . A third is a former aide to Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty , a career politician and women ' s activist . Another is a college instructor . The last is a retired Marine Corps brigadier_general in declining health . They are the members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors . None of them knows much , if anything , about reverse repurchase agreements or interest_rate swaps -- the types of exotic financial instruments that have plunged the county into the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history . If ever there was a time when the county needed strong leadership , it is now . But some members of the community wonder whether the board , with its lack of expertise in the securities market , can adequately guide Orange County out of the fiscal debacle that now threatens more_than 185 school districts and governmental agencies in the county and across the state . &quot; I feel so damn incompetent in responding to some of this , &quot; said Supervisor Thomas F . Riley , 82 , admitting that much of the county ' s economic problems are beyond his comprehension . &quot; I ' m used to saying , ' Damn it . This is the way we ' re going to do it. ' I can ' t do that with this challenge . I ' m not qualified. &quot; &quot; There has been a lack of leadership , &quot; said Tom Rogers , an activist in south Orange County who has battled developers for years and opposed tax measures for transportation projects . &quot; The reason behind this can be boiled_down to two words -- arrogance and accountability . They have plenty of arrogance and no accountability. &quot; Some community and political_leaders believe that the board has at least embarked_on the right track by hiring bankruptcy attorney Bruce Bennett and former state_Treasurer Thomas W . Hayes as its main adviser . Hayes also worked as Gov . Pete Wilson ' s finance director for two years . They also praised the county ' s decision to sue the Wall_Street firms that have sold $ 11.4 billion in bonds they held as collateral on loans to the county ' s investment portfolio managed by former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron . &quot; Hiring Hayes is a good step . So is suing the investment banks , &quot; said developer William Buck Johns , a member of the Lincoln Club , perhaps the wealthiest , most influential Republican organization in Orange County . &quot; They are doing the right things . They needed to get someone in there who understands this. &quot; Yet Johns said of the collapse , &quot; You wonder what government is doing. &quot; For more_than a week , the board , county officials and their consultants have been grappling with the wreckage of Citron ' s bond investment strategy , which was undermined by a rapid rise in interest_rates this year . On Tuesday , county supervisors decided to seek protection under Chapter 9 , a rarely used section of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code designed for governmental agencies . They have spent days on end , some without sleep , trying to keep county government afloat while dealing with Wall_Street and nervous investors who fear that they have lost tremendous amounts_of_money needed to run their operations . How the board performs could affect county government in the long_run and determine the political futures of the supervisors , including two who will take_office Jan . 5 -- former Huntington Beach City Councilman Jim Silva and former state Sen . Marian Bergeson . Riley , the retired Marine , and Harriett M . Wieder , who used to work for Yorty , are retiring . Some doubt whether any of them , including the newcomers , are up_to the task , given that the supervisors were responsible_for overseeing the treasurer ' s office in the first place . &quot; They just don ' t care , &quot; Rogers said . &quot; They won ' t be critical of_their_own kind . There has been no dissenting voice on that board for years . All they do is put the blinders on and raise a protective umbrella. &quot; Amid the county ' s worst financial crisis , the board has been criticized for failing to take action sooner against Citron even though watchdog agencies have repeatedly pointed_out problems with the treasurer ' s office . Orange County grand_jury reports in the mid- to late 1980s were critical of some aspects of Citron ' s operation and called_for more oversight , but county supervisors either ignored those reports , inadvertently overlooked them , or viewed them as being unimportant . But Citron ' s investments were doing_well at the time , Orange County bonds had high ratings , and there were no clear signs of pending disaster . Stronger warnings came_in 1993 , when county Auditor-Controller Steven E . Lewis issued a highly critical report of the operation of Citron ' s office in 1991 . Lewis concluded that the treasurer was making risky transactions , avoided oversight of his dealings and had violated government codes to maximize return . The report was sent to the Board of Supervisors and the Orange County district_attorney ' s office . &quot; It would be incredible malfeasance if the board didn ' t make themselves aware of the investments Citron was making , &quot; said Irvine attorney Christopher Mears , a local political activist . &quot; They have a central role to make_sure the money was invested properly . What did they do to assure themselves of that ? Not much apparently. &quot; If the public perceives a failure of the supervisors to rigorously oversee Citron ' s operations , it could reflect on the board at election time . Incumbents Gaddi H . Vasquez , Roger R . Stanton and William G . Steiner might be vulnerable , as well as Supervisor-elect Bergeson , whose legislative record in the state Capitol includes bills that helped Citron indulge in the kind of risky investments that led to his undoing . Political organizations from low budget grass-roots groups to the gilded Lincoln Club have been trying to address the crisis . Most are trying to assess their options and what they can do to influence the situation . There has been some talk_of a recall among some of the grass-roots organizations . So far no petition has surfaced . But even in the face of the county auditor ' s report that revealed critical problems with the treasurer ' s office , the supervisors contend that they should not be held responsible_for the crisis . &quot; Everyone that did assessments , audits or provided information on the investment funds plus 180-odd investors indicated that things were fine and that investments were going well , &quot; said Vasquez , a former police_officer . &quot; There were no indicators that a problem of this magnitude was occurring. &quot; Board_members say the public cannot expect elected officials who are not knowledgeable or sophisticated about the bond market to know when something is going_to be a problem . &quot; This finance field , just like a brain_surgeon ' s field . . . just like anything that the average person can ' t easily understand , really relegates the responsibility to somebody who knows , &quot; Wieder said . What is important now , board_members say , is how county leadership reacts to the crisis . Wieder expects that her colleagues will push hard for reforms that will grant the board more power and oversight of the treasurer ' s office . Other measures will be supported to prevent some of the risky investments Citron made . &quot; What lessons do we learn from this ? &quot; Wieder asked . &quot; I think that in this case , under state law , the treasurer had too_much freedom to manipulate county funds the way he was allowed to do. &quot; If there is blame to be assigned , Steiner said , it should be spread among the investors in the county ' s bond portfolio . More_than 185 governmental jurisdictions put money in the fund and all have elected officials , chief financial_officers and auditors responsible_for their financial interests . As a result of the debacle , Steiner said , there will not only be reforms on the county level but &quot; from Congress and nearly every governmental agency in California. &quot; To Riley , a 20-year member of the board , the bankruptcy filing has been his worst and most frustrating experience in government . Culpability ? &quot; that ' s something we certainly have to look_at , &quot; he said . &quot; But I believe that we followed the guidelines. &quot; The fact that there will be reforms in the county ' s investment system seems certain . Whether the Board of Supervisors will lead the charge remains unclear . &quot; This is so_much bigger than the board , &quot; said Scott Hart , an Orange County political consultant . &quot; They ' re going to have wait and see if the SEC is going_to step_in . They may_not have any choices here. &quot; Spotlight on the Supervisors The decision to plunge Orange County into bankruptcy so its investment fund might be saved was made by the Board of Supervisors . The five officials preside over 18 # 000 public employees and a $ 3.7-billion annual budget . Each earns $ 82 # 000 in salary and is elected to a four-year term . All are Republicans . Chairman Thomas F . Riley Age : 82 Home : Newport Beach Known in the Hall of Administration as &quot; the general , &quot; the former Marine is retiring in January as the longest-serving member of the board after two decades in office . He was appointed in 1974 by then-Gov . Ronald Reagan and -- to the dismay of many south Orange County environmental critics -- was a longtime supporter of pro-development efforts in the area . Supervisor Roger R . Stanton Age : 57 Home : Fountain Valley A former college professor , Stanton upset an incumbent supervisor to gain election in 1980 and has since sought to build his record around management and budget issues . He recently forced an end to the county ' s schedule of closing some offices every_other Friday , arguing that it denied public access and didn ' t end_up saving any money . Supervisor William G . Steiner Age : 57 Home : Orange The former director of Orangewood , a home for abused children , Steiner became the newest member of the board in 1993 when he was appointed by Gov . Pete Wilson to fill the seat left vacant by Supervisor Don R . Roth ' s resignation . He recently negotiated a settlement with his former colleagues in the city of Orange over the expansion of the Theo Lacy Branch Jail . Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez Age : 39 Home : Orange A former police_officer , Vasquez rose to national prominence as a speaker at the 1988 GOP convention and was frequently mentioned as a rising Latino star in the party . Some politicos believe he may have missed his chance , passing_up too many opportunities at higher office since then and publicly avoiding positions on such issues as Proposition 187 . Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder Age : 74 Home : Huntington Beach Wieder , a former aide to Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty , became the first woman elected to the board , in 1978 . She retires from office next month , second only to Riley in_length of tenure . She riled many in the local GOP by backing President Clinton in the 1992 campaign . The New Supervisors Supervisor-elect Marian Bergeson Age : 69 Home : Newport Beach After 16 years in the Legislature , she was elected unopposed to succeed Riley . The bond disaster has already forced her to do some political backpedaling : Last summer , she backed John M . W . Moorlach ' s bid to unseat Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron , but then switched sides . She says she feared criticism of Citron would taint the county ' s reputation on Wall_Street . Supervisor-elect Jim Silva Age : 50 Home : Huntington Beach Silva , who left his Huntington Beach City_Council seat and won a bitter race to replace the retiring Wieder , has been a high_school economics and civics teacher for 28 years . He has had a long dislike for Citron , regarded him as arrogant , and wants to see the treasurer ' s job change from an elected to appointed post . Source : Times reports</TEXT>
