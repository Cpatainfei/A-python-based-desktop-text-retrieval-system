   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : MISSION VIEJO ; STADIUM WON ' T BEAR COACH ' S NAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The football_stadium near Mission Viejo High_School will not be named in memory of Mike Rush , the school ' s former football_coach , trustees of the Saddleback Valley Unified School District decided . Despite pleas from a group of students and parents who said naming the stadium would be the only fitting tribute to the popular coach who died in November , trustees said Tuesday they consider a memorial on the Mission Viejo High campus more appropriate . &quot; I very strongly and wholeheartedly support a very special memorial on the Mission campus , &quot; said Trustee Marcia L . Birch . Trustees directed that the school appoint a committee of Mission Viejo high students , parents , faculty and alumni and Rush ' s widow , Pam Rush , to consider a tribute on the school ' s campus . Among the ideas they suggested were naming the library , weight room , practice field or a scholarship in Rush ' s honor . Trustees said they also want a report from the committee within a_few weeks . &quot; I would like to see this done as quickly as possible , &quot; said Trustee Bobbee Cline . Pam Rush and Sandie Gonzales , who led the drive for putting the coach ' s name on the now unnamed stadium , said they would be willing to sit on the committee . &quot; I want to see a positive , fitting . . . memorialization for Mike Rush , &quot; Gonzales said . Board_members said naming the stadium for Rush would not be welcomed by other high_schools in the district , especially Laguna Hills High , which shares use of the stadium for football games and other events . Several persons representing those schools emphasized that point to the board Tuesday . Said Monika Bickert , a non-voting student member of the board from El Toro High_School : &quot; The naming of the stadium for Mike Rush could cause feelings of resentment for students at Laguna Hills . . . . He was a coach at Mission Viejo High_School , his contributions were at that high_school , and his memorial should be kept at that high school. &quot; Rush died of a heart_attack at age 46 , eight months after he resigned his coaching position amid controversy over the school ' s devil mascot and reports of conflict between him and Principal Robert Metz . He continued to teach at the school . In five seasons as head coach his teams compiled a 45-16 record . He had also been an assistant coach for 10 years.RICHARD CORE</TEXT>
