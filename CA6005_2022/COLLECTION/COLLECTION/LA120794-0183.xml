   <HEADLINE> HILL GETS DEATH SENTENCE FOR 2 CLINIC SLAYINGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Paul Hill , the former preacher who killed a doctor and his unarmed escort with a shotgun at an abortion clinic here , was sentenced Tuesday to die in Florida ' s electric_chair . In court Tuesday , Hill said little before he was given the ultimate penalty by Circuit Judge Frank Bell , who sternly concluded : &quot; May God have mercy on your soul. &quot; But last week , Hill , 40 , had said : &quot; I know for a fact that I ' m going_to go_to heaven when I die . I am certainly guilty of no crimes . . . . My actions are honorable. &quot; Pending appeals , Hill ' s execution would complete a circle drawn_in blood in Pensacola . The city has been the scene of pitched anti-abortion protests , including the bombing of clinics and the murder last year of another abortion provider , Dr. David Gunn , whose killer was sentenced to life in prison . Hill ' s victims were Dr. John Britton , 69 , and retired Air_Force Lt . Col . James Barrett , 74 . Barrett ' s wife , June , was wounded . Although he may choose not to appeal the sentence himself , Hill is granted an automatic appeal under Florida law .</TEXT>
