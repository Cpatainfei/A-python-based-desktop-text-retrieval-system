   <HEADLINE> DOUGLAS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE CHINA DEAL FOR 40 PLANES ; AERONAUTICS : PACT WILL SEE 20 JETLINERS BUILT IN LONG_BEACH , 20 IN ASIA . WHITE_HOUSE HELPS SECURE THE $ 1-BILLION ORDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> McDonnell Douglas Corp . is expected to announce today that its Douglas Aircraft division in Long_Beach has reached agreement to sell 40 jetliners to China in a deal valued at more_than $ 1 billion , The Times has learned . Douglas once again got support from White_House lobbying , and President Clinton is expected to help make the announcement during a stop today in Southern California , according to sources familiar_with the transaction . The pact , which finalizes three years of negotiations between Douglas and the Chinese , calls_for half the planes to be built_in Long_Beach and half in China with Douglas-supplied components , the sources said . The planes -- MD-80s and MD-90s -- are medium-size , twin-engine jetliners that sell for about $ 30 million apiece . All are believed destined for Chinese airlines , the sources added . A McDonnell spokesman declined to comment on the reported pact , and White_House officials could not be reached late Thursday . But the sources said the Administration , notably Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown , helped Douglas secure the order , just as it helped Douglas and Boeing Co . win a $ 6-billion airplane order from Saudi_Arabia earlier this year . ( The Saudis have yet to formally place the order , however , because of disputes over how the planes will be financed. ) The Douglas-China deal -- which McDonnell Chairman John F . McDonnell and Chinese authorities are expected to sign today in Washington -- is important to Douglas for two reasons : It provides the world ' s No . 3 commercial aircraft builder with sorely needed new orders , and it helps maintain production for Douglas ' 10 # 000 workers in Long_Beach . &quot; They needed this one , &quot; said C . Donald Scales , aerospace manager for EDS Management Consulting Services in Los Angeles . &quot; It helps preserve , at least for the time being , the integrity of the Long_Beach plant. &quot; Indeed , the deal will also help McDonnell Douglas absorb some of the criticism it has received recently for its reported plans to have an outside firm build the company ' s proposed newest jetliner , the smaller MD-95 , in Texas . The company itself has not yet said where it plans to build that airplane . But sources close to the project said late Thursday that Douglas has already signed an agreement to have Dalfort Aviation assemble the MD-95 at Dallas ' Love Field . They also said Douglas has enlisted enough firm orders from airlines -- including Alitalia of Italy and the Dutch carrier KLM -- to formally launch production of the 100-seat aircraft , perhaps by year ' s end . All of which also marks a victory for McDonnell ' s new chief_executive , Harry C . Stonecipher , who said when he was hired a month ago that one of his priorities is to rejuvenate Douglas Aircraft ' s commercial business . The previous dearth of new orders has left Douglas -- which also builds the wide-body MD-11 in Long_Beach -- a distant player in the commercial market , behind Boeing and Europe ' s Airbus Industrie , which have a broader range of models . But the Chinese deal also fortifies Douglas ' links in Asia , which is one of the most promising markets for new aircraft orders . Douglas ' agreement is an extension of an earlier pact , known as the Trunkliner deal , in which 35 MD-80s were built_in China with parts shipped from Douglas . That program was completed earlier this year . In 1991 , Douglas began negotiating an extension of the program , and even announced the following year that China would be buying 40 more planes . But until today , a formal order had never materialized , and the question of whether the planes would be produced , and where , had remained muddled .</TEXT>
