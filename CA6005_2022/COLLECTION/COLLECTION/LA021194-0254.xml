   <HEADLINE> STATE AGENCY DENIED CONTROL OF O.C. FIRM ; COURT : BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE REMAINS IN CHARGE OF WASHINGTON TRUST DEED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A state agency lost a round in federal bankruptcy court Thursday when a judge refused to give it control again of Washington Trust_Deed Service Corp. , a Newport Beach company accused of defrauding hundreds of elderly investors . The state_Department of Corporations in December persuaded a state judge to appoint its hand-picked receiver to run the company in_order to protect investors . To wrest control from the receiver , Washington ' s owner filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy a_few days later . The practical impact of the ruling is nil because control of the company remains beyond the reach of the owner , Kenneth E . Sarvak , 68 . A federal bankruptcy trustee is now in_charge of the company , which will be closed_down and its assets sold_off to pay debts . Washington is a sister company to Lincoln Mortgage &amp; Loan Co . in Newport Beach , also owned by Sarvak and also in bankruptcy . Both concerns sold investments in second_mortgages mostly to senior_citizens and sports figures . The Department of Corporations said Thursday that it had not decided whether to appeal the ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John J . Wilson . The state agency acknowledged that -- either way -- Sarvak has relinquished control of the company but said the issue is a matter of principle : Sarvak , it maintained , should not be able to thwart state regulators by filing for bankruptcy .</TEXT>
