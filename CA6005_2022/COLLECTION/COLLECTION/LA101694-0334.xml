   <HEADLINE> GULF WAR THREAT EASES ; PENTAGON REMAINS WARY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The threat of war in the Persian_Gulf seemed to recede Saturday , with Iraq ' s last Republican Guard division apparently preparing to leave southern Iraq and Defense_Secretary William J . Perry telling American troops here that they &quot; saved the United States , saved the world from war. &quot; The elite Iraqi troops , who raised new fears by stopping and redeploying 100 miles from the border three days ago , were now ready to comply with American demands that they depart , Perry said . And Iraq ' s information minister said &quot; the time has come_to transfer those troops &quot; to their former positions . &quot; The encampment they ' re making right now , according to our intelligence , looks_like a temporary encampment rather than digging in , &quot; Perry told Army troops stationed here . &quot; It looks_like they ' re simply waiting for the transportation they need to take them north. &quot; In Washington , the Pentagon was more cautious in its assessment . &quot; We don ' t have any indication that they are digging_in , but we also don ' t have any indication that they are preparing to leave , so it ' s still a big question_mark at this point , &quot; one senior Pentagon official said . President Clinton noted in his weekly radio address to the nation Saturday that a &quot; significant &quot; number of Iraqi troops were still &quot; within striking distance of Kuwait. &quot; &quot; This is a day of decision for America and the world , &quot; Clinton later told a political rally in Bridgeport , Conn . &quot; We will stay there until we are sure the threat is gone. &quot; Perry ' s threat Friday to use military_force if the troops did not leave southern Iraq , and signs of possible diplomatic solutions to the crisis Baghdad had sparked , appeared to have prompted Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to resume the withdrawal , analysts here said . Diplomats in the Gulf also saw the sharp increase Saturday in anti-American rhetoric from Baghdad as a sign that Iraq wanted to put the best face on its decision to end the military buildup on the Kuwaiti border . Iraqi Information Minister Hamid Youssef Hammadi described Washington ' s anger over the halted retreat of one division as &quot; a tempest . . . stirred by the Americans. &quot; And the Iraqi government newspaper , Al Jumhuriyah , portrayed the crisis as a defeat for the American President . &quot; What happened has completely cornered Clinton , &quot; the newspaper said . And it likened Clinton to &quot; the veteran criminal George_Bush , &quot; who as President during the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War was the target of similar personal attacks . The paper , in a reference_to scandals in the Clinton presidency , said the Gulf crisis had &quot; exposed &quot; Clinton ' s &quot; weakness , indecisiveness , infidelity and crooked financial practices. &quot; Late Saturday , the U.N. Security_Council passed a resolution condemning Iraq ' s military movements and demanding the immediate withdrawal of Revolutionary Guard units to their original positions . The resolution also bars Baghdad from using its forces in a hostile or provocative manner to threaten either its neighbors or U.N. operations in Iraq . Madeleine Albright , the United States ' ambassador to the United Nations , issued an implied threat of force against Iraq if it failed to abide_by the resolution . &quot; Let me assure this council that . . . my government will take all appropriate action if Iraq fails to comply with the demands of this resolution , &quot; Albright said after its unanimous adoption . An Iraqi Information Ministry official condemned the resolution Saturday . Writing in a Baghdad newspaper , Nouri Marsoumi said the United States &quot; may have thought that Iraq is an American_state and ( that ) the last thing left for it is to ask_for a seat in the operations room of the Iraqi army. &quot; The United Nations will also be asked_in coming days to consider a peace plan drawn_up by Hussein and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev in meetings last week in Baghdad . Kozyrev , who met Kuwait ' s leaders Saturday and planned to head to New York today , told reporters here that he is still confident of winning support for the plan despite strong opposition from the United States and Britain and a lukewarm response from Kuwaiti leaders . The proposal , which would secure formal Iraqi recognition of Kuwait in exchange for Moscow ' s help in lifting U.N. sanctions that have crippled Hussein ' s regime , &quot; does not mean any reward for ( Iraq ) in this crisis , &quot; Kozyrev said . But , he added , the United Nations should lift the sanctions if Iraq recognizes Kuwait ' s disputed border and allows U.N. officials to monitor Iraq ' s military financing , among other U.N. conditions . Kozyrev ' s argument was bolstered by U.N. weapons inspectors who said Saturday that the Iraqis were cooperating in the task of dismantling weapons of mass destruction . All signs Saturday were that the immediate crisis in the oil-rich Gulf had passed . Half of the estimated 80 # 000 Iraqi troops that massed on the border with Kuwait a week ago had already moved north of the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone , Perry said . The United States had threatened to deploy more troops and even use force if Iraq did not pull its tanks and soldiers out of that zone . &quot; I believe we have been successful in deterring the war with Iraq , &quot; Perry told Army troops at Kuwait ' s airport before leaving for a three-day visit to China . Nevertheless , the defense_secretary said the current American deployment will continue . &quot; One of the lessons we ' ve learned from all this is preparedness works and is the key to responding rapidly to ground forces in an emergency , &quot; Perry said . American officials say about 3 # 300 troops are_on the ground in Kuwait , with a 2 # 000-member Marine Expeditionary Force off the coast . Sen . John W . Warner ( R-Va. ) traveling with Perry , said Kuwaiti officials had given their personal assurance &quot; that this nation together with all other Gulf nations . . . will help to defray very substantially the cost of this operation. &quot; In pep talks to troops on two of the 19 warships in the Persian_Gulf , Perry lauded the U.S. military as an effective deterrent to rambunctious dictators , and he vowed that U.S. forces will remain at &quot; high readiness &quot; until all Iraqi troops retreat . But he added : &quot; The good news is . . . you ' ll probably be able to go_back home on your regular deployment time . that ' s back in California before Christmas. &quot;</TEXT>
