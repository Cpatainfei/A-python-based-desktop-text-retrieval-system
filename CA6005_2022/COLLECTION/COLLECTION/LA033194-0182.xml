   <HEADLINE> IRVINE KILLING SUSPECT HELD IN MONTANA ; CRIME : MAN ARRESTED IN A PROMINENT CATTLE RANCHER ' S DEATH IN THAT STATE IS ALSO SOUGHT IN A 1986 SLAYING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A ranch_hand suspected of killing one of the nation ' s most prominent cattle ranchers in Montana this week is also wanted in the 1986 slaying of a 26-year-old man in Irvine , authorities said Wednesday . David Llamas , 32 , of Corona was arrested in Hobson , Mont. , after Tuesday ' s discovery of the body of Wayne Stevenson , 51 , a leading cattleman in that state , said Jim Hubble , a Judith Basin County attorney . Irvine police said they were ecstatic at the news of Llamas ' arrest . &quot; We presented enough evidence for his arrest for murder ( in 1986 ) and haven ' t been able to locate him . Obviously , this is very helpful for us . Now . . . we can bring him back and hold him accountable for this murder , &quot; said Irvine Police Lt . Sam Allevato . Irvine police say Llamas killed Ramon Anguiano when he lost his job and could not pay Llamas ' $ 700 fee for smuggling his wife and children into the United States from Mexico . Anguiano had promised to pay as soon as he found work , police said . But he was shot to death a_few days later . His body was discovered dumped on Bonita Canyon Drive . Irvine police obtained a $ 250 # 000 warrant for Llamas ' arrest , but he fled . He was seen in Boise , Ida. , but later vanished . In Montana , the 5-foot-2-inch Llamas apparently went_to work six months ago for Stevenson , the patriarch of a cattle-raising family that includes his brother Keith and their children . Stevenson was last seen Sunday evening on his way to feed cattle , according to authorities . The cause of Stevenson ' s death is unknown , said Judith Basin County Sheriff Steve Knetch . But authorities investigating the case discovered that a murder warrant had been issued years ago for Llamas in Orange County . He was arrested and held_in lieu of $ 250 # 000 bail on that warrant . &quot; It ' s safe to say he is one of the suspects &quot; in Stevenson ' s death as well , Knetch said . Still , he said , other people also are under investigation . Hubble said Llamas refused to waive his extradition rights , so the state of California must start legal_proceedings to extradite him . He said it will probably take about 30 days to complete the process . Hubble said , however , that if authorities do tie Llamas to Stevenson ' s death , California is going_to have a tough time getting him back . Irvine Police Lt . Pete Linton , who has been in_charge of the Anguiano case from the beginning , acknowledged as much . &quot; We ' re going to have to wait to see what happens , &quot; Linton said . &quot; If they get their case filed and charge him with this murder prior to extradition , then we will have to stand_back and wait. &quot; The Stevensons are among the leading Black_Angus breeders in the nation . The death of Wayne Stevenson &quot; will send shock_waves through the industry , &quot; said Bob Cook , a spokesman for the Public Auction Yards in Billings , Mont . The Stevensons run what &quot; is the biggest Angus cow-calf operation in America. &quot; Wire_services contributed to this report .</TEXT>
