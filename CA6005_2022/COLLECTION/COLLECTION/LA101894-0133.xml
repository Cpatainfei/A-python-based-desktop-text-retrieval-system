   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; GERMANY : A WAVE OF ' OSTALGIA ' ; THOSE FROM THE EAST ARE LOOKING_BACK FONDLY , EVEN ON THE HARD TIMES UNDER THE COMMUNISTS . THEY ' RE EVEN TAKING_PRIDE IN DRIVING THEIR CLUNKY TRABANTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; What makes people drive Trabants ? &quot; Albrecht Reither considers the question almost shyly for a moment , sitting in an auto shop decorated with poster-sized photos of the tinny , toylike car , East_Germany ' s contribution to the automotive world . How , indeed , to explain to an outsider why anyone today would still want to suffer the Trabant ' s noisy two-stroke engine , dollhouse interior , the acrid products of its notion of an exhaust_system ? East_Germany is long gone , and the Trabant -- which , unfortunately for the East_Germans , means &quot; satellite &quot; -- is no longer in production . There are no Trabbi dealerships . To get a Trabbi today , you have to go well_out of your way to find one on the secondhand market and be prepared to withstand the ridicule of your fellow Germans . But then Reither , a burly spare-parts dealer , turns defiant . &quot; The Trabant is a symbol of protest , &quot; he says . &quot; People are saying : ' I drove this car for 30 years , and I ' m going_to keep driving it . I ' m not ashamed to be from the east. ' &quot; Time was , eastern Germans wanted to get clear of anything associated with their Communist past . From bad coffee to the ideological water torture of official discourse , from the baleful Trabbi to the tiresome workplace habit of eating bologna sandwiches every time a colleague had a birthday -- in the weeks and months immediately after the Berlin Wall fell , people wanted to discard all_of these fixtures of socialist life and anything else that had to do with East_Germany . Of late , however , a wave of nostalgia for Ostdeutschland -- call it Ostalgia , as_many do -- has been washing over eastern Germany . Today , people are driving their Trabbis with a vengeance , to_the_point of joining Trabbi outing clubs and parading through the eastern German countryside . Shops specializing in made-in-the-East groceries and household products are opening , and it has become socially acceptable to drink eastern Germany ' s sugar-sweet Little Red Riding Hood sparkling_wine and to serve eastern Germany ' s more chewy dinner rolls . Ostalgia parties are very much the thing on eastern German campuses . Even the former East_German practice of giving all 14-year-olds a sort of secular &quot; first Communion &quot; service -- the Jugendweihe , or &quot; youth blessing &quot; -- has been enthusiastically revived . &quot; Most people have quickly found_out that the dream of the golden West was just an illusion , &quot; contends Reither , who had the commercial sense to buy all_the Trabbi parts he could find and who now does a thriving trade_in them . He has made enough money to buy a Mercedes or a BMW , but his sense of eastern identity keeps him behind the wheel of his 1974 Trabbi . Eastern Germans have had nearly five years now to plumb the joys of Western capitalism , and , as Reither says , many have found them wanting . True , they no longer have to live with shootings at the Wall , a censored press , the largest spying network in the Marxist world , or the many other instruments of East_German state power . But some have come_to the arresting conclusion that they are worse off today than they were under communism . Many men have lost their jobs . Women have lost child-care centers that cost 20 cents a day ; practically all households are paying many times more for rent and sustenance . And even the eastern Germans who now have &quot; made_it &quot; -- who have bigger apartments , interesting jobs , telephones , fax machines , plausible newspapers , strawberries year-round -- even these easterners talk_of a certain something that is missing from their lives . It is , in part , a sense of belonging : They know they aren ' t East_Germans anymore , but five years of unification have convinced them that they don ' t quite fit into the West either . So , if they aren ' t East_Germans , and they aren ' t West Germans , then what are they ? The current conspicuous return to old ways may be , for easterners , a means of finding_out . And if nothing else , it serves for many as a heartening reminder that everything about life in the German Democratic Republic wasn ' t thoroughly evil -- that life in the East was in some respects actually better . &quot; I don ' t know anyone who says they want the whole German Democratic Republic back , &quot; says Hans-Joachim Maaz , a psychiatrist in the eastern German city of Halle who has written_on the special psychological problems of his compatriots . &quot; What I hear about is the lack of_values . People say , ' We don ' t want to live_in a society where everyone is elbowing their way to the front . We want to have a sense of solidarity . And we want to live_in a society where money doesn ' t influence everything , even relationships between friends. ' &quot; &quot; The tragedy , &quot; adds Maaz , &quot; is that there is nobody who really takes these desires seriously. &quot; Well , almost nobody . On a busy street in what used to be East Berlin , Klaus Eichler has carved out a specialty business centered_on Ostalgia : He packages tours for eastern Germans who now miss the very thing they would have spurned in the past -- group tours , laced with nonstop ideology , to the old_glory spots of the socialist world . Interested in the space race from the Soviet point_of_view ? Eichler has a tour to Baikonur , the Russian Cape Canaveral , where participants undergo mock cosmonaut training and watch a rocket_launching . The tour guide is a former East_German cosmonaut , Sigmund Jaehn . Or what about those who like to mix a little sunshine and surf with their politics ? For them , Eichler offers two weeks in Cuba , in the capable hands of East_Germany ' s former ambassador to Havana , Hans Langer . Langer takes the Ostalgic tourists to the beaches but also books political discussions with Cuban doctors , farmers and members of the Asamblea Nacional . &quot; Of course , we have to admit that there wasn ' t enough that was good about East_Germany . Otherwise it would n ' t have failed , &quot; he says . &quot; But , nevertheless , I think that quite a_few people here believe that in East_German times we enjoyed a more peaceful way_of_life , even a more pleasant way_of_life . It ' s difficult to explain this , but it has something to do with human feelings and with values -- with the feeling that my neighbor was my friend , and not my competitor. &quot; Eichler thinks eastern Germany ' s fixation with the past may be a sign that a broader quest is under way for a new ideology -- some sort of economic arrangement that is neither capitalism nor communism . To understand why eastern Germans feel the way they do , look with eastern eyes at the way German unification has turned_out . In the early , heady months after the Berlin Wall was breached , people dreamed big dreams of what the future might hold once unification was complete : People would vote_in free elections ; they would enjoy real representation in an authentic national assembly ; inefficient state enterprises would be reorganized and the public would become shareholders ; a new , all-German constitution would combine the best elements of the East with those of the West . But as reunification took_hold , it became clear that West Germany had no intention of retaining what may have been &quot; good &quot; about the East . Free elections were held , true enough , but West German political_parties sent_in candidates and dominated the political scene . Far from making easterners shareholders in their former country ' s industrial stock , the unified government sold much of what was salable to outside investors . New , private owners , in many cases , then laid_off the easterners by the thousands . As for a new constitution : It is still being brought_up to date , but so far , nothing from East_Germany has been kept . The way things have turned_out , the only East_German artifact that the unified government has preserved has been the freedom to turn right on some red_lights . Which is why people like Werner Riedel have set_about saving bits and pieces all by themselves . &quot; The practice of celebrating the youth blessing in the German Democratic Republic was not 100 % bad , &quot; says Riedel , who plucked that East_German custom off the endangered list in 1990 and has revived it virtually single-handedly . &quot; It was just sort of exploited by ideology and forced on people. &quot; Indeed . In former times , when East_Germans turned 14 , they were put_through indoctrination courses , then formally initiated into adulthood in a public ceremony . The young people took an oath and were presented with a book about their place in the universe , &quot; The Cosmos , the Earth , and the Human Being. &quot; Then , typically , doting relatives took them home , showered them with gifts and fed them a big lunch . &quot; I can remember my own youth blessing , &quot; says Riedel . &quot; It was sort of automatic . I ' ve forgotten the oath , but I still remember all_the presents I got , and the big meal. &quot; In the turbulent months after the East_German government collapsed , Riedel says he began worrying about young people and thinking maybe they needed proof that somebody cared about them . In many cases , he says , their parents were thrown_out of work and spending all_of their time trying to survive . Riedel thought the old youth blessing might put much-needed structure back into their lives -- as long as it was stripped of its former ideological content . He assembled a volunteer staff , organized a curriculum , printed up some brochures and has never looked_back . Last year in Berlin , 8 # 000 14-year-olds received the new , post-Communist youth blessing -- 10 times as_many as those who received their first Communion . Across eastern Germany , about 80 # 000 adolescents are enrolled in the program this fall . As it happens , even the young people Riedel is catering to -- teen-agers who are too young to have arrived_at much of an understanding of what it was to be an East_German -- have joined the Ostalgia kick . Consider the goings-on at Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena , a city in the southern part of what used to be East_Germany . Deep under the city ' s center , in a campus rathskeller , posters of the late East_German dictator Erich Honecker share wall space with portraits of Mikhail S . Gorbachev , the onetime Soviet leader , and the album covers of popular East_German musicians . &quot; Forward to the 300th Anniversary of the German Democratic Republic ! &quot; exhorts a banner over the dance_floor . Young people swill Vita Cola , an East_German soft_drink , and an ersatz sangria made only with apples , pears and grapes ( it was difficult to find imported fruit in East_Germany , so no one ever had oranges or pineapples ) . When a young_man leaps onto the bar and begins singing , the whole crowd joins in : &quot; Build , build , build ! Help us to build a better society ! We ' re going to construct a new homeland , for a better future ! &quot; It is an East_German classic , and everybody knows the words . This is an Ostalgia party , a rage on campuses all_over the former East . University_students show_up in polyester clothing that would otherwise never make_it out of the darkest corners of their wardrobes . At the entrance , organizer Steffen Bernhardt sits at a table graced by a pile of transcripts of the late North_Korean leader Kim Il Sung ' s speeches , taking money . He is 27 , old enough to remember what it was like in the former times , when the student club was twice shut_down by the authorities for minor ideological infractions . But he is prepared to explain why students today are embracing the symbols and impedimenta of the repressive system they used to hate . &quot; We don ' t want to deny our own history , &quot; he says . &quot; These things are part of our lives , and that ' s why we keep them. &quot; There is a shriek and a woman runs_by , reeking of chemicals ; a prankster has just anointed her with a discontinued East_German deodorant . A tall man in an army jacket and an enormous red motorcycle helmet comes_by , brandishing an old copy of Neues Deutschland , once the official newspaper of the East_German Communist_Party . &quot; If I had seen this newspaper five years ago , I ' d have said , ' Oh , hell , ' &quot; says Dirk Spoerl , a 29-year-old handyman . &quot; But now I can laugh about it. &quot; &quot; We are no nerds , &quot; adds Bernhardt . &quot; We can speak like the West Germans . We can write like the West Germans . We are as tall as the West Germans . Yet everything from the German Democratic Republic is being destroyed . That is a mistake . It is history . History will never end. &quot;</TEXT>
