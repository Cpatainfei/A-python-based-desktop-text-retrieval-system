   <HEADLINE> WHEN SMOKE CLEARS IN THE GUN DEBATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The firearm debate has built a cross-fire riddled with more ricochets than conclusive hits . * Claim : Control advocates point to a 1989 statement by Baltimore police_chief Leonard Supenski , who said he was weary of &quot; passing_out flags to widows of officers killed by drug dealers with Uzis. &quot; * Counter : Pro-gun forces say FBI statistics , compiled for the National Rifle Assn. , prove that between 1980 and 1989 , only one police_officer -- and in Puerto Rico -- had been killed by such a weapon . * Claim : Assault_rifles are responsible_for the majority of gun murders and should be banned . * Counter : FBI data show that rifles of all types account_for less than 4.5 % of murder weapons . Assault_rifles represent only a minuscule number . * Claim : Anti-gun forces point to a recent medical_report that says keeping a handgun in the home triples the chance that someone will be killed there . * Counter : Pro-gun representatives refer to another study that says firearms are used 2.1 million times per year to deter crime -- and without any shots fired . In several days of interviews with The Times , NRA President Bob Corbin certainly put a spin on his arguments . He said NRA money and influence were responsible_for the 1992 defeat of Rep . Bill Alexander ( D-Ark. ) , an 11-term incumbent . Alexander certainly supports gun_control . What Corbin did not mention is that voters were equally dismayed by Alexander ' s record of writing 487 bad_checks , the worst offender in the House bank scandal . Corbin said ABC , CBS and NBC television networks -- also the Washington Post and New York Times -- refuse NRA advertising . When contacted , spokesmen for the Post and the New York Times -- also the Los Angeles Times -- said they have never refused NRA advertising . Network television representatives confirmed that they do not accept NRA &quot; issue advertising &quot; -- but such policies also refuse commercials from groups in favor of gun_control , abortion and other issues . * Question : When the Second Amendment was written , the right to bear arms involved only muzzle-loading flintlocks . Would signers have allowed the right to bear semiautomatic rifles and handguns with 15-shot magazines ? * Answer : &quot; Well , I could say the same thing about you and your business , freedom of press and freedom_of_speech . Did our forefathers foresee television and radio ? No . Yet the First_Amendment still applies and protects freedom_of_speech and freedom_of_the_press from all_the technology we have. &quot; * Q : Is gun_control synonymous with crime control ? A : &quot; Far from it . Did drug laws reduce the use of drugs and the amount of drugs coming_into this country ? A criminal is a criminal . A criminal doesn ' t obey any law . What makes you think he is going_to obey a little gun law ? &quot; * Q : In 1991 , 61 % of 30 # 000 suicides were by firearms . Surely gun_controls would reduce that number . A : &quot; If somebody is going_to commit suicide and they can ' t find a gun , they ' ll find a knife , they ' ll find poison , they ' ll jump_off a bridge . Or get Jack Kevorkian. &quot; * Q : However , gun_controls would certainly reduce the number of children accidentally shot by playing with handguns . A : &quot; That is terrible , tragic . So do we do_away_with cars so cars would n ' t be hitting them when they run_out in the street ? If we do_away_with all poisons , kids would n ' t get under sinks and drink poison . If we didn ' t have swimming_pools , they would n ' t be drowning in swimming_pools . Kids are going_to have accidents and are going_to die . It ' s a part of life. &quot; * Q : Between the poles of Handgun Control Inc. and the NRA , does there exist an even , civilized reality ? A : &quot; No . Because they lie . They said : ' All we want is the Brady Bill and a waiting period. ' And then after it is passed , they say it is just the beginning , the camel ' s nose under the tent and ' we ' re coming_after all your guns. ' So why should we compromise ? Let them compromise once in a while. &quot; * Q : But they claim a legitimate concern with rising violence and high-powered weapons in the hands of criminals . A : &quot; About 70 million law-abiding citizens own 200 million guns in this country . Less than 3 / 10ths of 1 % of those 70 million misuse them . And if 99.77 % don ' t misuse ' em , why do you want to punish them ? Criminals are the problem , not the law-abiding gun owner. &quot;</TEXT>
