   <HEADLINE> EDISON SAYS FEAR OF QUAKE LIQUEFACTION UNFOUNDED ; PREPAREDNESS : UTILITY TELLS CONCERNED REDONDO RESIDENTS ANY DAMAGE WOULD BE CONFINED TO THE PLANT . BUT SOME CITY OFFICIALS ARE NOT CONVINCED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After the Northridge earthquake turned the soil under a King Harbor Marina parking_lot to car-swallowing , goopy muck , some Redondo Beach residents gazed across Harbor Drive at the Southern California Edison electrical generating plant and wondered if a bigger earthquake might cause the plant to collapse -- with catastrophic results for surrounding residents and businesses . This week a delegation of Edison representatives appeared before the city Environmental and Public_Utilities Commission to provide information on earthquake risk assessment at the generating plant . The Edison representatives ' conclusion : Nothing to worry about . Probably . &quot; In a worst-case scenario . . . we believe any problems would be confined to the plant itself and not pose a danger to the community , &quot; generating station manager Jerry Berquist told the commission . A major concern centers_on &quot; liquefaction , &quot; the phenomenon in which loose , wet soil can suddenly turn_into a jelly-like substance when subjected_to the violent shaking of an earthquake . In the Jan . 17 quake , Redondo Beach , although 28 miles from the epicenter , suffered at least $ 2.5 million in damage at King Harbor Marina when a parking_lot built_on a sandy spit collapsed , and about a dozen parked cars sank six feet into a mucky chasm . The collapse was attributed to liquefaction . Dennis Ostrom , an Edison engineer and earthquake specialist , told the commission that while the plant rests atop soil that could be subject_to liquefaction , it is supported by pilings driven 30 to 50 feet into the ground , below the potential liquefaction area . By contrast , the earthquake-damaged marina area was slabs of asphalt and concrete supported only by the underlying soil . Ostrom said before the meeting that he was not aware of any liquefaction under the plant as a result of the Jan . 17 earthquake . &quot; Our plants have been exposed to earthquakes in the past , &quot; Ostrom told the commission . &quot; They ' ve been exposed to liquefaction . So far there has been no consequence of liquefaction . . . . Certainly there has been no danger to people outside the facility. &quot; Ostrom added that generating plants &quot; are known for being low-risk facilities. &quot; But not everyone was convinced . Commissioner Tom O ' Leary , who makes no secret of his opposition to having the power_plant in Redondo Beach , earthquakes or no earthquakes , said the Edison representatives were basing their assurances on faulty assumptions . &quot; What has happened up_to now has no bearing on what could happen in the future , &quot; O ' Leary said . &quot; We have facing us the danger of stronger earthquakes. &quot; Although Edison representatives said the nearest known major fault_line , the Newport-Inglewood Fault , lies_about 2.5 miles away , O ' Leary said the Northridge earthquake showed earthquakes can occur in areas where scientists never expected them . O ' Leary and other commission members wanted to know what would happen if a huge earthquake , say an 8.0 , occurred near the plant . Would natural_gas or electrical fires erupt ? Underground ammonia tanks burst ? Power_lines collapse ? Liquefaction could occur under the plant with a nearby 7.5 quake , the Edison representatives said , and there could be fires and pipe ruptures . But again , Berquist insisted , any danger would be confined to the plant site . &quot; The Cal Ed guys ' presentation was incomplete and unconvincing , &quot; O ' Leary said after the meeting . &quot; All they said was , ' As far as we can tell , everything will be all right. ' &quot; &quot; A power_plant is a very dangerous industrial application , &quot; said Redondo Beach resident John Dancy , a retired aerospace_engineer who attended the meeting . &quot; You got the feeling ( from the Edison presentation ) that everything is flying_on automatic_pilot , that they just hope and pray nothing will happen. &quot; O ' Leary said an informal group of citizens intends to analyze the Edison presentation and may have more questions .</TEXT>
