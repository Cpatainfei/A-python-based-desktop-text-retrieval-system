   <HEADLINE> FIGURE SKATING / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS ; KWAN 11TH AFTER TECHNICAL PROGRAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Michelle Kwan fell_out of contention Friday in the women ' s competition and for the second consecutive year , the United States will leave figure_skating ' s World Championships without a medal . The youngest skater ever to represent the United States in the World Championships , Kwan , 13 , of Torrance , finished a disappointing 11th in the technical program at Chiba , Japan . &quot; I felt good , but I could have done better , &quot; she said . &quot; It just didn ' t happen. &quot; The first three positions are held by Japan ' s Yuka Sato , France ' s Surya Bonaly and Canada ' s Josee Chouinard , with today ' s freestyle program accounting_for two-thirds of the final score . The three medalists from last month ' s Winter_Olympics -- Ukraine ' s Oksana Baiul , the United States ' Nancy Kerrigan and China ' s Chen Lu , are not competing in Chiba . The ice dance competition also was diminished when the silver and bronze medalists from the Winter_Olympics -- Russia ' s Maia Usova and Alexander Zhulin and Great Britain ' s Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean -- withdrew . Despite a fall by Russia ' s Evgeni Platov in Friday ' s free dance , he and partner Oksana Gritschuk were not pressed . They won all four phases of the competition in adding the gold medal from the World Championships to the one they won in the Winter_Olympics at Hamar , Norway . France ' s Sophie Moniotte and Pascal Lavanchy finished second , and Finland ' s Susanna Rahkamo and Patri Kokko were third . The United States ' Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow were 12th . With competition in three of the four disciplines completed , the United States has had only two top-10 finishes , a sixth by Jenni Meno and Todd Sand of Costa Mesa in pairs and a seventh by Scott Davis of Great Falls , Ida. , in men ' s singles . Kwan , competing in Chiba as a replacement for Kerrigan , could move_into the top 10 , but she will have to skate better in her freestyle program than she did_in the technical program Friday , when she fell on a triple lutz and failed to complete a required combination . She appeared awe-struck . &quot; It was really exciting to be out there skating with the people I saw in the Olympics , &quot; said Kwan , who went_to Norway as an alternate but did not compete . &quot; It ' s just a great experience being here . But it ' s hard . The competition is hard. &quot; The last time the United States figure_skating team failed to win medals in consecutive World Championships was in 1963 and ' 64 , when it was still rebuilding after a 1961 plane crash killed the entire team .
