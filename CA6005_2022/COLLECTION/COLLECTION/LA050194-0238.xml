ROOKIE FEDERAL HEALTH INVESTIGATOR NEVER FORGOT THE CASE ; LAST DECEMBER , HE PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The mysterious death of an Idaho man from a pneumonia-like illness so perplexed a rookie federal health investigator that he kept his personal notes on the case for 15 years . Suddenly , a_few months ago , those files turned_out to be much more_than a sentimental keepsake . that ' s when Dr. Rick Goodman recognized that details about the death -- his first case -- matched those in a report describing a respiratory_disease that was killing dozens of people in the Southwest . &quot; It just hit me , &quot; said Goodman , now an editor at the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention . &quot; I ' d been staring a case of hantavirus in the face. &quot; The Idaho man ' s death in 1978 is no longer a mystery : It ' s the earliest confirmed case in the United States of hantaviral pulmonary syndrome , as the disease is called . That finding is important because learning the history of a virus helps scientists determine what causes epidemics , said Dr. Gary Simpson , an infectious_disease specialist with the New Mexico Department of Health . After determining what factors lead to epidemics , health departments can develop &quot; sentinels , &quot; or tip-offs , to alert the public when the same conditions arise again -- just as they now use in the Southwest to prevent outbreaks of bubonic_plague , he said . But until last summer , researchers were unaware of this form of hantavirus or its ability to attack a victim ' s lungs . Hantavirus , in an even rarer form that destroys the kidneys , has been in the United States for years without causing epidemics . Only recently have scientists learned that the respiratory form may be just as old . No one knows why it has resurfaced so fatally . Since the outbreak almost a year ago , Goodman has edited more_than a dozen reports for the CDC about the rodent-borne hantavirus and the respiratory_disease it causes . It wasn ' t until December , while reading about another suspected case , that Goodman linked it to the death he reviewed shortly after joining the CDC ' s investigative epidemiology team . Still nostalgic about his first work assignment and puzzled by the death of an otherwise healthy 24-year-old man , Goodman had kept his personal notes on the case , even as he moved from research to administration as a CDC editor . &quot; I tore open the filing_cabinet , found the notes &quot; and showed them to a colleague , who also was struck by the similarity to hantavirus . &quot; It was a case of not seeing the tree for the forest , &quot; Goodman said . After making the connection , Goodman gathered autopsy specimens from state health officials and the University of Utah Hospital , where the man died on Sept . 22 , 1978 . Goodman confirmed his suspicions after painstaking laboratory tests showed that the virus -- the same strain that struck the Southwest -- had killed the man . On March 11 , he talked to the victim ' s widow , who is now remarried . She declined to talk with the news media . Back in 1978 , the man ' s death had sent Goodman to Montpelier , a small Rocky Mountain town of about 3 # 000 in southeastern Idaho , near the Wyoming line . His job was to find_out what had killed the young_man , an avid sportsman who was a volunteer fireman . Goodman conducted numerous interviews with his widow , hunting buddies and co-workers at a chemical fertilizer plant . All he found was dead_ends . He couldn ' t even confirm a local physician ' s belief that cases of respiratory_disease were increasing . &quot; We left , basically , without a clear answer as_to what caused his death , &quot; Goodman recalled . &quot; It always struck me that we went_out there and we didn ' t find anything. &quot; Now he marvels at connecting the cases . &quot; There are very few instances in medicine where you solve the problem such a distance of time from it , &quot; he said . Goodman ' s discovery is an example of &quot; serendipity in science , &quot; said Victoria Harden , historian at the National Institutes of Health . The apparent luck actually comes_after much hard work , when &quot; suddenly it all falls_into_place when you least expect it , &quot; she said . A similar happenstance at the CDC came when researchers were investigating another often fatal respiratory illness , Legionnaires disease . The cause of Legionnaires was discovered in 1976 when CDC scientist Joe McDade connected information he had found in his files to the outbreak in Philadelphia months earlier . Later , the agency eventually linked the disease to earlier cases -- just like hantavirus . Knowing the full history of such a virus -- that it can start with just a single case and lead to outbreaks years later -- forms the basis for the CDC ' s research and prevention efforts , Goodman said . But for the Idaho man , even knowing the cause of his death would have given physicians little help in curing him . There is still no treatment today for the disease . Hantaviral pulmonary syndrome is believed to be carried in airborne particles of dried feces or urine from rodents . In the Southwest -- and the Idaho case -- the carrier is the deer_mouse . Researchers are still trying to identify the rodent carrier in cases in Florida , Louisiana , California , and the Northeast . So far , the CDC has confirmed 60 cases . Early symptoms resemble the flu , but the disease progresses rapidly to breathing difficulties and shock . It is fatal about 60 % of the time . The hantavirus family is named for the Hantaan River in Korea , where the first strain was discovered decades ago . That virus infected about 3 # 000 American soldiers during the Korean_War , killing 190 by destroying their kidneys . The virus itself was not identified until more_than 20 years later . Hantavirus Cases by State States with hantavirus cases confirmed by the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention . Numbers may differ from those provided by state health departments because some departments list suspected cases . Arizona : 11 Colorado : 5 California : 3 Florida : 1 Idaho : 4 Indiana : 1 Kansas : 2 Louisiana : 1 Montana : 2 New Mexico : 20 Nevada : 3 North_Dakota : 2 Oregon : 1 Rhode Island : 1 South_Dakota : 3 Texas : 1 Source : Associated Press</TEXT>
