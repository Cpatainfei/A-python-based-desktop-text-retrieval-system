   <HEADLINE> PANEL URGES FOCUS ON PROSTATE SYMPTOMS ; HEALTH : RULES CALL FOR STUDYING SEVERITY OF PROBLEMS BEFORE DECIDING ON TREATMENT OF BENIGN CONDITION . PATIENTS SHOULD HAVE ' THE FINAL SAY. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Physicians should not automatically recommend surgery or drug therapy for the treatment of an enlarged prostate_gland , especially if the condition is causing only mild or moderate symptoms , federal health officials said Tuesday . A panel of urologists and other experts convened by the government urged physicians to focus_on the severity of symptoms before deciding on the course of therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) , a common condition in older_men . The practice guidelines were issued by the Agency for Health_Care Policy and Research , part of the Department of Health and Human Resources . Established in 1989 , the agency is charged with improving the quality of the nation ' s health_care while reducing costs . The prostate is a male sex gland located below the bladder and in front of the rectum . Normally about the size of a walnut , it surrounds the upper part of the urethra , the tube that empties urine from the bladder . BPH is an enlargement of the prostate_gland that generally progresses slowly . It can cause frequent and urgent urination , produce a sensation that the bladder never quite empties , cause difficulty in starting to urinate and disturb sleep . It sometimes can lead to serious complications , such_as urine retention , urinary_tract_infections , kidney problems or bleeding through the urethra . The condition is not directly related to prostate cancer , the second most common cancer in men after skin_cancer . But both are influenced by similar hormonal factors , and aging makes men vulnerable to both . By the age of 60 , more_than half of all men in the United States develop some degree of BPH . And by age 80 , an estimated one in four will require treatment for the condition , the agency said . The panel recommended that patients have &quot; the final say &quot; in determining the treatment , noting that the decisions should be &quot; symptom-driven. &quot; &quot; At the present_time , the unfortunate scenario too often occurs of the patient going_into the doctor ' s office and leaving with either a prescription or a surgery date without much discussion , &quot; said Dr. John D . McConnell , chairman of the 13-member panel and head of urology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical_Center in Dallas . &quot; All treatments other_than watchful waiting are unnecessary in men who only have mild symptoms , &quot; O ' Connell said . &quot; Also , in a disease like BPH , which is slowly progressive -- and with most men does not interfere with their health -- it is important to lay out all_the options and include the patient in the decision. &quot; Transurethral resection of the prostate is the most frequently used treatment , and one of the most commonly performed surgeries among Medicare recipients , the agency said . In 1992 , more_than 221 # 000 such procedures were performed on men 65 or older at a cost to Medicare of more_than $ 1 billion . The procedure involves cutting_away prostate tissue with a tool inserted through the urethra . Most patients suffer no significant problems other_than temporary discomfort , although there is a small risk of urinary leakage and sexual dysfunction . Asked if the guidelines could be used by insurance_companies to deny reimbursement for surgery , McConnell said only that he believes surgery is not indicated for those men suffering only mild symptoms . &quot; There is no benefit to ( surgically ) treating a patient with mild symptoms , &quot; he said . BPH also can be treated with other surgical_procedures and with drugs . The drugs include alpha blockers , which relieve pressure on the urethra , and finasteride , a drug that reduces male hormone levels within the prostate and helps shrink the gland . But the drugs can cause side_effects , which generally disappear once the patient stops taking them . Alpha blockers can cause headaches , dizziness and fatigue , and finasteride can cause sexual problems . The panel ' s guidelines have been endorsed by the American Urological Assn. , the American College of Radiology , the American Society of Radiological Technologists and the National Council for Senior_Citizens .</TEXT>
