   <TEXT> Responding to Wednesday ' s deadly bombing of a Tel Aviv bus , the Israeli Cabinet on Thursday ordered the West_Bank and Gaza Strip sealed indefinitely , a move the Palestinian self-governing authority immediately denounced as an act of &quot; economic and social war. &quot; The nation was plunged into mourning as families buried 14 of the 20 Israelis killed in the bombing . A Dutch tourist and the bomber also died . Drivers for the Dan Bus Co. , whose No . 5 bus was incinerated in the attack , kept their headlights on all day as they traveled their routes , a gesture of solidarity with the victims . And by Thursday afternoon , a videotape began airing on Israel Television of the man who is believed to have carried_out the attack . In the videotape , Salah Abdel-Rahim Hassan Souwi Nazal , 27 , who carried a briefcase packed with explosives aboard the No . 5 and is thought to have blown himself to bits in the bombing , bade farewell to his friends and family . Nazal cradled an Israeli-made Galil rifle as he somberly addressed the camera . The neatly dressed man said he wanted to avenge the deaths of three Hamas militants killed by Israeli soldiers Oct . 14 in the army ' s failed attempt to rescue an Israeli soldier kidnaped by the extremist group . The kidnaped soldier , Nachshon Waxman , and another Israeli soldier were killed in a raid on the West_Bank house where Waxman was held . Nazal also said that his brother had been killed by Israeli soldiers during the Palestinian uprising , or intifada , that erupted in the Israeli-occupied West_Bank and Gaza Strip in December , 1987 . The army put Qalqiliya , Nazal ' s West_Bank hometown , under curfew and said it would demolish the home of Nazal ' s family , even though a survivor of the bombing who said she sat behind the attacker told Israeli Radio she did not believe the man in the videotape was the one on the bus . Israeli police said Thursday that 22 bombing victims had been identified , but that the condition of the bodies made_it difficult to determine if that is the final death toll . The curfew and the planned demolition appeared to be the government ' s first show of force in what Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin has promised will be a war against Hamas . The Cabinet , called into emergency session by Rabin on Thursday morning , agreed with the prime_minister that security_forces could use unspecified &quot; additional means . . . to strengthen their activity against the Hamas and its military wing. &quot; Addressing the nation Wednesday night , Rabin said he did not want the security_forces hampered by the guidelines of the Landau Commission when dealing with Hamas . The commission devised guidelines several years ago for security_forces to use &quot; limited physical pressure &quot; in the course of interrogations , in situations where lives could be saved by obtaining information from a suspect . Speaking_to reporters after the Cabinet meeting , several ministers , including Justice Minister David Libai , said they had persuaded Rabin not to put_forward a proposal to let security_forces use harsher methods during interrogation of Hamas militants whenever they are apprehended . But it appears likely that security_forces will start rounding_up Hamas activists in the West_Bank and subjecting them to &quot; administrative detention &quot; -- arrest and imprisonment without charges being filed . Several Palestinian and Israeli human_rights groups Thursday called_on the government to refrain_from practicing collective punishment that will affect wide segments of Palestinian society . &quot; We call_upon the Israeli government to refrain_from implementing any measures which bring harm to innocent persons , such_as house demolition and sealing , curfew , unacceptable treatment of the families of wanted persons , &quot; the B ' tzelem and five other human_rights groups said in a statement faxed to news organizations . But already , the entire population of the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank is forbidden to enter Israel to work or visit , unless granted special permission . The new restrictions cut_off the livelihoods of tens of thousands of Palestinians and limit the movements of nearly 2 million . &quot; I see in these resolutions adopted by the Israeli Cabinet today a declaration of war , an economic and social war against the Palestinian society that will negatively affect the whole process , &quot; said Marwan Kanafani , spokesman for Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat . &quot; I do not know how we are going_to go_ahead with implementation of the peace process with such an attitude , &quot; Kanafani told the Associated Press . &quot; There is no doubt that the continuation of the closure of the Gaza Strip and West_Bank will have grave consequences on the Palestinian people from a security , social and economic point_of_view , &quot; said Palestinian Authority Labor Minister Samir Ghoshe . Ghoshe said more Palestinians will be driven into opposition to the peace process if the closure is lengthy . But Israeli Cabinet_ministers were in no mood to sympathize_with the Palestinians on Thursday . &quot; This is not just a closure , &quot; said Tourism Minister Uzi Baram , referring to the new restrictions . &quot; It is a closure and also the return of people who are illegally ( inside Israel ) and also a series of operative activities. &quot; Ministers spoke_of a &quot; strategic separation &quot; between Israel and the territories where Palestinians live . They said that the government soon will increase the number of foreign workers allowed into the country . There already are about 25 # 000 foreign workers -- most of them from Asia and Eastern Europe -- legally working in Israel , and 15 # 000 more will be authorized . At the same time , Israel did not suspend its talks with the PLO on expanding its authority throughout the West_Bank . Rabin withdrew his chief negotiator , Danny Rothschild , from the talks in Cairo after Waxman was kidnaped . Rothschild on Wednesday completed another round of talks that made little progress toward agreement between Israel and the Palestinians on Palestinian elections in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . Government spokesman Uri Dromi said Wednesday that Rabin and his Cabinet are more inclined now to speed_up those talks and to speed_up the transfer of authority to the Palestinians in the West_Bank than they were before the bombing . &quot; In the long_run , what is important is not so_much the decisions the government took today , but the shock of this tragedy , &quot; Dromi said . &quot; People are suddenly realizing that this sort of attack can happen in the heart of Tel Aviv . More Israelis are open_to the conclusion that their security can be_better assured if they are not wrapped in a bearhug with the Palestinians. &quot; But about 120 # 000 Jewish settlers live_on the West_Bank either in the midst of or near Palestinian communities . The army has yet to figure_out how to provide security for those settlers after it redeploys out of Palestinian population centers . And it must find a way to confront Hamas -- which has pledged to destroy the Israeli-Palestinian peace process -- without alienating both the Palestinian Authority and the vast majority of Palestinians living_in the territories who feel they are being punished for the acts of an extremist minority . &quot; I hope that this ( closure of the territories ) will not last a long_time , because there is a clear distinction between the PLO and Hamas , &quot; said Culture Minister Shulamit Aloni , a member of the left-leaning Meretz parliamentary bloc . &quot; We are conducting a strategy ( for ) peace . We will continue with it and therefore , it will be necessary to keep building it. &quot;</TEXT>
