   <HEADLINE> ACCORD REACHED TO END BUS STRIKE ; TRANSIT : PROPOSED AGREEMENT BETWEEN MECHANICS AND MTA OFFICIALS FACES UNION VOTE TODAY . IF APPROVED , FULL SERVICE MAY NOT RESUME UNTIL END OF THE WEEK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After an all-night bargaining session , striking transit mechanics forged a tentative agreement with MTA officials early Monday that could end their eight-day walkout , but normal service for hundreds of thousands of beleaguered Los Angeles bus and train riders may_not resume until the end of the week . Although the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board unanimously approved the proposed settlement Monday evening , union leaders said the strike that has crippled the region ' s transit system will continue until the 1 # 900 mechanics cast their votes_in a closed-door meeting today . Even if the union ratifies the agreement , MTA officials say , it could take 72 hours to summon drivers , inspect buses and dispatch the agency ' s normal fleet of 1 # 900 buses to 200 routes -- only 17 % of which have been served during the strike . &quot; It ' s great . I ' ll be able to get_back and forth to work_at the speed I want , &quot; said Victor Woo , a Koreatown sales manager whose round-trip bus commute during the strike has taken six hours . &quot; It ' s been a real big hassle. &quot; Both sides declined to discuss most details of the preliminary settlement , which was reached at 3:55 a.m. Monday over coffee at a Burbank hotel suite . The marathon 12-hour negotiating session came_on the heels of a bitter breakdown in talks Friday afternoon that seemed to derail any hope of early resolution . &quot; I will recommend to ratify this contract , that ' s all I can say , &quot; said Mike Bujosa , president of the Amalgamated Transit Union . Bujosa planned to present a summary of the 20-page pact to union_members in a meeting at the Los Angeles Convention Center at 3 p.m. today . After hashing out details of the proposal , the union will pass_out ballots and vote on the settlement . A simple majority is necessary for ratification and a tally is expected by early evening . The sticking point in talks had centered_on the agency ' s desire to contract_out work to non-union companies . Under the proposed agreement , a committee of union_members and MTA officials will approve any controversial subcontracts to private companies , said Manuel Guerra , a union_shop steward . The union will agree to allow the MTA to do some subcontracting , such_as body work_on company cars , Guerra said . Under the proposed settlement , dozens of mechanics laid_off last month will be rehired when current positions become vacant , according to MTA officials . The agreement also will allow the agency to hire some new union_members at lower wages . The MTA board unanimously approved the agreement after a 55-minute , closed-door meeting Monday . &quot; It is a fair and equitable agreement -- fair to the union_members , fair to the MTA , fair to our riders and fair to the public and taxpayers , &quot; said Supervisor Ed Edelman , chairman of the MTA . &quot; It is a good_example of compromise . We didn ' t get everything we wanted , and I ' m sure the unions didn ' t get everything they wanted. &quot; Mayor Richard Riordan said the public will benefit because &quot; what we ' re going to do is have much better and more efficient service , particularly in the transit-needy parts of Los Angeles. &quot; Franklin White , the MTA ' s chief_executive_officer , said he hoped to restore full bus_service by Friday . &quot; We will be back to 100 % by the end of the week , &quot; he said . Several picketing drivers and mechanics , who did not know the details of the newly crafted settlement , said they had begun to feel the financial pinch of a week with no pay and were ready to end the transit strike -- the region ' s first in 12 years and the longest in 15 years . &quot; I ' m glad they did_it -- we ' ve been ready to get_back to work , &quot; said Richard Danleis , who has driven a bus for 18 years . &quot; I ' ve got four kids and a wife who doesn ' t work , so believe me , it hurts. &quot; Fred Payne , a mechanic for 17 years , spent the last week picketing the South-Central bus yard . &quot; If it goes_through I ' ll be one of the happiest guys out here , &quot; Payne said . &quot; I want to get_out of this sun. &quot; When Van Nguyen learned of the joint MTA-union committee that will review subcontracting issues , he said he was concerned that it would lead to fewer union jobs . &quot; I don ' t think that ' s a good idea . . . . When you subcontract , people lose their jobs , &quot; said the 33-year-old El Monte mechanic . Nguyen and other mechanics could return to work as early as tonight if the settlement is approved . This would allow agency officials to start_up limited service on every line by Wednesday afternoon , said MTA spokeswoman Andrea Greene . But it will take several days to deploy the MTA ' s usual fleet because each bus will need to be inspected before it can hit the streets , she said . Expecting the strike to end , about 30 drivers , clerks and mechanics crossed the picket_line to report to work Monday . &quot; People are getting antsy , &quot; Greene said . &quot; They want their paycheck. &quot; The 1 # 900 mechanics walked_off the job eight days ago after they were unable to reach an agreement on a new three-year contract . About 5 # 000 clerks , bus and train drivers , whose unions had reached last-minute tentative agreements , walked_out in support -- creating hours of delays for about 500 # 000 bus passengers who struggled to reach destinations with the MTA ' s skeletal bus_service . For bus riders , the prospect of a settlement meant an end to long waits at crowded bus_stops . But many passengers were skeptical about the tentative agreement . &quot; I won ' t believe it ' s over until I see more buses out here , &quot; said Maria Cedillo , 27 , waiting for the first of three buses she needed to travel from her Northridge home to Downtown Los Angeles . Since the strike began , Cedillo has walked 45 minutes in the sweltering heat each day . &quot; Look_at my feet . They ' re cracking , &quot; she said , pointing at her sandals . At bus_stops , most passengers were angry , feeling they had been the victims of the complicated wrangling at the bargaining table . &quot; Maybe the strike will end , maybe not , &quot; said Carmen Cruz , 38 , of Pacoima , as she waited at a Van Nuys Boulevard bus_stop . &quot; I don ' t think either the bus_drivers or their bosses were thinking_about us . They know we have nowhere else to go. &quot; Others vowed that they would no longer depend_on public_transit -- a pledge that MTA officials had predicted when they warned striking union_members that ridership would drop after the walkout . Franklin Stubblefield , a 22-year-old manager of a Van Nuys shoe_store , said he hoped he had taken his last bus ride . Stubblefield cobbled_together a piecemeal system of commuting by car-pooling from his Silver Lake home with his neighbors . &quot; I don ' t want to ride another bus in my life , &quot; he said . &quot; ( The strike ) showed me there were other ways to get_around than the ol ' bus . And for that , I ' m thankful. &quot; Meanwhile , on Day 8 of the Los Angeles bus strike : * MTA officials reported that 313 buses were_on the streets Monday morning , but they expected the number to grow to 385 by the end of the day -- a number they hoped to deploy today as well . * The United Transportation Union and Transportation Clerks Union began mailing ballots to their members , apprising them of the details of the tentative agreements reached at the end of last month . It was the second mailing for the United Transportation Union because the first one contained an error . The ballots are_due back later this month . Ratification is far from assured , some observers say . Last month , union leaders for Bay Area Rapid_Transit workers reached a tentative agreement only to have it soundly rejected by the rank_and_file . UTU and TCU officials said their members will return to work once the mechanics ratify an agreement . Times staff writers Nicholas Riccardi and Timothy Williams contributed to this report . The MTA Strike : Day 8 The region ' s first transit strike in 12 years began at 12:01 a.m. July 25 .
