   <HEADLINE> BARRED FROM ISRAEL , PALESTINIANS FRET AND WAIT ; MIDEAST : ' WE ' RE IN A BIG PRISON , ' SAYS A GAZA STRIP RESIDENT . A CABINET DECISION PROLONGS THE EXCLUSION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The sweet smell of oranges baking under a hot midmorning sun was turning_into a stink as Mustafa Shahaiba sat Sunday on the ground next to his truck and waited , and traced his frustration with a finger in the dirt , and fumed . &quot; I have 60 tons of oranges . All of us , we have maybe 1 # 000 tons . We have been here since Thursday . Today , they say they will let us in at 7 o ' clock . But as you see , it is now 10 o ' clock . And until this moment , nothing has happened . They say : ' Wait. ' And that ' s all they say. &quot; In the dust and racket of the streets of Gaza City , a_few miles away from the backed-up delivery_trucks at the Israeli border , coffee_shops are overflowing with clients . Men of all ages listlessly sip the morning away over a cup_of_tea or strong coffee . They lean_against shop windows and watch the traffic lurch by . They strike_up casual conversations over the hood of someone ' s car . &quot; All of us here , we ' re in a big prison , &quot; said Yasser Mabhouh , a 22-year-old medical technician student who has not been able to leave Gaza to attend college in the West_Bank town of Ramallah since late February . He and about 1 # 500 other Gaza students have been told that they will never receive permission to resume their studies outside Gaza , &quot; which means we will lose everything we have studied : in my case , two years of my life. &quot; Since Israel closed the occupied territories after the Feb . 25 massacre of about 30 Palestinians in the West_Bank town of Hebron -- and tightened the seal last week -- there is little but waiting , and quiet nurturing of a growing fury , for the estimated 25 # 000 Gaza residents who have been prevented from going_to work each day in Israel . Peace talks aimed at reaching a self-rule accord resumed Sunday in Cairo , but in the occupied West_Bank and Gaza Strip , the focus has shifted away from the distant dream of autonomy . Now , tens of thousands of workers who can buy_food just a day at a time wonder only how their families will eat each evening . On Sunday , the Israeli Cabinet said the closure of the territories , the strictest imposed in more_than a year , would be in_effect until further notice . Israel TV reported that there are signs the 1.8 million Palestinians of the West_Bank and Gaza Strip could remain substantially sealed_off until Israel signs a peace agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization -- an event that is not foreseen until at least after the end of the month . &quot; I have savings for maybe two months , &quot; said Abdelrahim Hassan Hawilli , 36 , a construction worker in Israel for 18 years . &quot; After that , what can I say ? We will starve , at least . And I say , at least . There will be starvation for everyone. &quot; For the Gaza Strip , the closure order means economic agony . Unemployment , which was already at 35 % when Gazans were commuting to work every day in Israel , has jumped to an estimated 50 % since the lock-down . More alarming for Gaza , which more_than most West_Bank cities owes its economic livelihood to jobs in Israel , the Israeli Cabinet has authorized the importation of 18 # 000 foreign workers to take many of the jobs held by Palestinians . The foreign laborers , 15 # 000 in the construction_industry and 3 # 000 for agriculture , will receive six-month work_permits . New subsidies have been ordered to help recruit Israelis for jobs now held by Palestinians . The Cabinet did say it will re-evaluate the closure order at its regular meeting next Sunday . In approving the order , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel must begin freeing itself from its dependence on Palestinian labor , &quot; a dependence which forces us to make decisions which endanger the security of civilians. &quot; The closure order was tightened after eight Israelis died in two Arab terrorist attacks in Israel last week . Over the weekend , a Jerusalem woman was stabbed in the stomach by a man believed to be an Arab , and a young Hamas activist from the Gaza Strip was killed when he tried to attack Israeli soldiers with an ax . The Islamic militant group Hamas has vowed to turn Israelis ' lives &quot; into hell &quot; in the week leading_up to Israel ' s Independence_Day on Thursday . &quot; The Palestinians have to understand there is a price for attacks on Israelis , &quot; Police Minister Moshe Shahal told the Cabinet on Sunday . In Gaza , Palestinian leaders see the closure order as a sign of bitter and difficult times_to_come as they attempt to build new lives under the coming transitional period of self-rule . &quot; It seems that Israel is serious this time , and if so , it will have a catastrophic effect -- the Palestinian economy cannot sustain it , &quot; said Salah Abdel Shafi , director of the Economic Development Group in Gaza . He said both Israelis and Palestinians have agreed on open economic borders in negotiations under way in Paris . &quot; This was an Israeli request , to have open borders , &quot; Abdel Shafi said . &quot; So now Israel , either they need a kind of economic disengagement -- and in this case we have a right to prevent Israeli commodities from entering our markets -- or they must open borders to allow Palestinian workers . Either they marry , or they divorce. &quot; After the Hebron massacre , an estimated 5 # 000 workers a day were still able to cross into Israel from the Gaza Strip . But since Thursday , even those permissions have been revoked , and Gaza doctors were complaining Sunday that 16 patients badly in need of chemotherapy and other treatment in Israel were not being permitted to cross the border . The Palestinian Council of Health said 20 Palestinian doctors from the territories were barred from reaching a hospital on Jerusalem ' s Mount of Olives , though the army announced that it would allow doctors to travel_to hospitals in East Jerusalem if they had proper permits from the civil administration . Produce truckers said their goods , though technically exempt from the closure order , were rotting at the border as Israel refused to allow them through . By late Sunday afternoon , most of the backed-up trucks had crossed . Palestinian leaders say Israel , if it is going_to continue barring Palestinians from work in Israel , must allow immediate relief deliveries and in the long_run must allow the Palestinians to forge new economic integration with Egypt and Jordan . Eventually , Palestinians must develop industries and factories of_their_own , they say . With more_than $ 2 billion in outside aid expected to flow into Gaza and Jericho during the coming period of self-rule , the construction of new infrastructure will provide some new jobs -- perhaps 10 # 000 to 15 # 000 in Gaza over the next two years . But an accord on Palestinian autonomy signed by Israel and the PLO last September carries with it a built-in economic dependence on Israel , Abdel Shafi said . &quot; The moment we agreed on limited political sovereignty we agreed on limited economic sovereignty , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t think we are going_to solve the unemployment problem in the short term , or even in the medium term. &quot;</TEXT>
