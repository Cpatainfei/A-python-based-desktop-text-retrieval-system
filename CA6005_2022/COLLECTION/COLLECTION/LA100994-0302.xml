   <HEADLINE> BRIDE IS TRULY BORING ; GROOM WILL CARY ON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> She considers herself the life of any party , but everyone knows she is Truly Boring . She wasn ' t always . But on Sept . 17 , Truly Gold , 24 , of Huntington Beach tied the knot with Cary S . Boring , 27 , of Balboa Island and legally took his name . &quot; Now , people are already coming_up with names for children we could have , &quot; the new bride said , adding that the most suggested monikers include &quot; Really , Very and Totally. &quot; Although her family thinks the union of names is &quot; hysterical , &quot; Truly is having a little trouble getting used to the idea . The young retail merchandise coordinator , who prefers to go_by Truly Gold Boring , said she once considered changing her new last_name or even adding a strategically placed accent to avoid some embarrassment . Mr. Boring , Truly says , has never even considered a name change . &quot; I can just imagine what our kids ' friends might say years from now : ' Do we have to go_to the Boring house ? ' &quot; Long before last month ' s wedding , Truly truly had some time to consider the possibilities . In fact , on the couple ' s first date five years ago , when both were students at Cal State Chico , they joked about how a marriage could make her identity a lifetime of laughs . When the two began dating seriously , jokes about a possible marriage became the subjects of whispered jokes on campus . &quot; We would be standing right there , and people would be laughing about the names , &quot; she said . &quot; It really was a small campus . &quot; I ' m really not boring , &quot; said Truly Boring . &quot; I can be the life of any party. &quot;</TEXT>
