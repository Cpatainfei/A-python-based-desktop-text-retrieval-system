   <HEADLINE> BUT THEN , WOMEN CAN FIND THEIR OWN SOCKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This thesis will reluctantly examine the painful though inescapable scientific fact that women are stupider than men . The author wishes to emphasize at the outset that not all women are stupider than all men ; indeed , some women are very smart , such_as Marie Curie and Katharine Graham . But the unassailable evidence from all available aggregate data -- as measured physiologically , taxonomically and through the application of empirical testing procedures involving highly scientific terminology such_as &quot; standard_deviation &quot; -- is that women , in comparison to men , are imbeciles . This conclusion should not be used to discriminate in any way against women , nor to make any assumptions whatsoever about the cognitive abilities of individual women , many of whom have made valuable contributions to society , such_as Sandra Day O ' Connor and Katharine Graham . Before summarizing his findings , the author also wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to Charles Murray and the late Richard J . Herrnstein , authors of the controversial , gigantically scientific new book arguing , with grave misgivings , that black people are genetically inferior to white people in intelligence . Drs . Murray and Herrnstein make this courageous assertion at the very real risk of being labeled dangerous , evil racists and making many millions of dollars . This article could not have happened without their inspiration . * 1 . The Ascent of Man Schoolchildren are familiar_with the standard drawing illustrating mankind ' s emergence from the primordial soup and gradual evolution to the upright , cerebral biped he is today . It is instructive to note that the most obvious evolutionary development accompanying man ' s increasing sentience is his increasing erectness . Stated more scientifically , the evolution of the brain is inextricably twinned with an increase in the height of his center_of_gravity ( emphasis mine ) . According to &quot; Gray ' s Anatomy , &quot; a woman ' s center_of_gravity is 12 % lower than a man ' s . This reflects the comparatively larger displacement of her hips and lower torso , a factor attributable to her capacity for childbearing . The author wishes to emphasize that women ' s childbearing role is an important one , and women should not be disrespected for this , or belittled for it , even though it is irrefutable evidence that they are lower than men on the evolutionary scale . * 2 . Weighty Evidence A 1992 medical study of cadavers at the University of Western Ontario and a contemporary but independent study in Ulster , Northern_Ireland , concluded that on the average , men ' s brains are 8 % larger than women ' s brains , even after adjusting for the discrepancy in the total body_weight of men and women . We make no assertion here that brain mass relates directly to intelligence . As scientists , we must at all costs avoid the fallacy of post_hoc ergo propter hoc . To argue that women are dumber because their brains are smaller would be no more intellectually valid than asserting that just because someone is 6 feet , 7 inches tall , he is more likely to be able to dunk a basketball than someone who is 5 feet 3 . So call this one a tossup . * 3 . Extremely Empirical Data According to the Educational Testing Service in Princeton , N.J. , women , on average , score nearly 50 points below men on the Scholastic Assessment Test , the national college entrance exam . Some studies point_out that once women are in college , their performance is equal_to , or even superior to , men ' s performance . We must accept that fact for what it is . Unscientific . Unlike an exam administered anonymously , graded by computer and field-tested over generations to eliminate bias of any sort , performance in school is perforce a manipulable measurement . It is a measure not of raw ability , or of intellectual capacity , but of a mishmash of qualities that includes diligence , organization and diplomatic skills . It can be affected by factors as extraneous as one ' s consumption of fraternity beer , or one ' s skill at coquettishly elevating one ' s stockinged thigh in a manner pleasing to the professorial eye . * 4 . The Women ' s Tutorial Lately , social_scientists have been conducting elaborate studies involving male and female performance in the workplace . One of the more interesting of these was a recent study by the National Foundation for Women Business Owners on the relative success of businesses run_by men and businesses run_by women . The study also surveys the management techniques employed by each sex . At first blush , the results suggest parity . Men and women owners succeed in business in about equal proportion . Men tend to be more dictatorial , women more consensus-building . These were the results as reported in the national media . The national media failed to properly interpret the results . Further analysis of the findings reveals that men tend to make their decisions on_their_own . Women are 30 % more likely to call_in consultants . Consultants are 60 % more likely to be men . ( Emphasis mine. ) Successful female-owned businesses , then , rely in substantial measure on help from men . Often , complicated scientific concepts are_best grasped by laymen through the adoption of a simpler statistical model . Think_of it this way : The United States and Canada both won World_War_II . Were they entitled to be equally proud ? * 5 . The Penultimate Pitch Plato , the first social_scientist , watched shadows dancing on the cave wall and drew elaborate conclusions about the lives of the people within . So too may we analyze the mysteries of the brain through its shadows . The brain is a machine , comparable_to an internal_combustion engine . The more efficient the engine , the better the mileage , the lower the oil consumption , the stronger the torque . The more efficient the brain , the more efficient the operation of the body . Consider man versus woman on the ball_field . The human female ' s &quot; bent-arm &quot; contorted throwing style is the least efficient possible method for propelling a baseball through space , and yet it is automatically adopted by any girl or woman of any age throwing a ball for the first , or thousandth , time . The straighter , whiplike off-the-shoulder male style is the most efficient method yet devised . No one teaches this . The male brain simply knows . * 6 . The Marathon Woman Consistently , since ancient Greece , the best women ' s times in the marathon have been 10 % to 20 % slower than the best_men ' s times , and this disparity has generally extended over the aggregate times of all finishers . Historically , this has been attributed to an assumed lesser strength of women , a contention we reject as patronizing . In light of the material thus far presented , is it not reasonable to speculate that women ' s longer marathon times might be attributable to the fact that , during the course of the race , they tend to get lost ? Conclusion Society must recognize the existence of inherent gender-based intellectual disparities , and celebrate these differences without seeking to denigrate women or minimize their historical contributions . Women must be encouraged to tailor their goals to reasonable expectations , considering their limitations . Because humor is a function of intellect , articles like this should be patiently explained to them , so they do not make untoward and uncharitable assumptions about the motives of the author , who is , after all , like Drs . Murray and Herrnstein , an impartial scientist who is free_of all bigotry . * Next week : Why Presbyterians are idiots .</TEXT>
