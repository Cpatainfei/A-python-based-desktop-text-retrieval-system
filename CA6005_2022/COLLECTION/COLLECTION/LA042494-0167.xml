   <TEXT> Five years after assassins made rubber tapper Chico Mendes an environmental martyr , the movement he led to protect Brazil ' s rain_forest is collapsing . Infighting and mismanagement have splintered some conservation groups . Others are losing financial_support and members because they have not developed ways to use the forest ' s riches without destroying it . An ideological rift has divided domestic environmentalists , who see the Amazon as a test region for agrarian reform , and international groups that view deforestation in purely ecological terms . To the dismay of conservationists , some Indians have even begun illegally selling rights to gold and precious hardwoods on their Amazon reservations . While the conservation movement breaks_down , the forces of destruction remain strong : Ranchers , loggers and refugees from Brazil ' s dry , overpopulated northeast continue eating_away the 2 million square_miles of wilderness . Satellite photos indicate the deforestation rate has declined 63 % since 1985 , largely because Brazil ' s recession crippled the lumber industry , but a swath of jungle twice the size of Delaware still vanished in 1993 . Gold prospectors continue to poison hundreds of miles of Amazon tributaries with mercury used to isolate gold particles in river dredging . Experts estimate that miners dumped 200 tons of mercury into Amazon waters last year alone . &quot; The symbolic talk_of the ' 80s hasn ' t been followed up with concrete , practical alternatives , &quot; said Rep . Fabio Feldman , the leading environmentalist in the Brazilian Congress . &quot; The destruction is only bound to get worse. &quot; A much different future seemed in_store five years ago , when Mendes led a union of rubber tappers in the sleepy Amazon town of Xapuri in blocking the path of bulldozers sent to clear jungle for pasture . Mendes also persuaded foreign lenders to scrap loans for ecologically destructive projects and lobbied for government-protected &quot; extractivist &quot; reserves where people could harvest forest produce without destroying the jungle . His murder in December , 1988 , by a rancher and his son drew world attention to the plight of the Amazon and raised preservationist sentiment in Brazil to an unprecedented level . The outcry led the government to create a 2.4-million-acre reserve in Acre state and pledge to set_aside another 55 million acres of jungle by 1993 . Aid poured in from the World Wildlife Federation , Ford Foundation and U.S. Agency for International Development . Hundreds of local environmental groups sprouted almost overnight . The World_Bank and Inter-American Development Bank suspended financing of controversial road , dam and settlement projects in the Amazon . Members of 40 Indian tribes and hundreds of ecologists gathered at Altamira to protest hydroelectric projects that would flood tribal lands . The World_Bank withdrew financing for the dams . In December , 1990 , the rancher and his son were convicted of killing Mendes and given 19-year prison sentences . Ecologists saw the convictions as a first_step toward bringing justice to the Amazon . On the eve of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio , the government granted the primitive Yanomami Indians a jungle reservation the size of Indiana to protect them from gold hunters and loggers . Then , at the Earth Summit , the movement ran_into trouble . Brazilian environmentalists accused foreign groups of using the Amazon cause for their own profit . The foreigners countered that Brazilian ecologists had become too radical in_demanding land_reform , and halted financial_aid . &quot; The infighting was pretty depressing , &quot; said Anthony Andersen , with the Ford Foundation in Rio . &quot; No one was coming_up with ideas to help , only finger-pointing. &quot; Then word got_out that the Kayapo Indians in Para state were not only mining gold and felling huge tracts of endangered mahogany forest on their land , but were hiring outsiders to do_it . Reports of Kayapo chiefs squandering money on prostitutes , private planes and sports_cars while their villages did not have doctors or teachers enraged people who had fought for protected Indian reserves . In the union Mendes founded to defend natives of the Amazon who live_by extracting produce from the rain_forest , a feud developed between his 29-year-old widow , Ilzamar , and his closest aides . Union leaders accuse Ilzamar Mendes of selling movie rights to Mendes ' life_story without consulting them and of using the money to buy a new home , a restaurant , a pickup_truck , a satellite dish -- even a cattle_ranch . Rubber tappers accuse her of mismanaging the Chico Mendes Foundation established to promote the rubber tappers ' cause . A judge has frozen the foundation ' s assets until lawsuits are settled .</TEXT>
