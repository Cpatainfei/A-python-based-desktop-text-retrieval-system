   <HEADLINE> EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : THOUSAND OAKS ; OUT-OF-COURT DEAL_OUT FOR DOS VIENTOS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Representatives from the Sierra Club and city of Thousand Oaks on Monday decided they would be unable to settle a lawsuit over the Dos Vientos development out of court . &quot; We have discovered that we definitely disagree , &quot; Sierra Club representative Cassandra Auerbach said . The Sierra Club has sued the city over the 2 # 350-home development on Dos Vientos Ranch . Environmentalists say the project would jeopardize the health and safety of Newbury Park residents by loading the area with traffic , air_pollution and noise . But city officials have said they believe that most ill effects can be mitigated and add that their hands are tied by a development agreement guaranteeing 2 # 350 homes on the ranch . Since the settlement conference failed to head_off a trial , the city will concentrate_on preparing the history of the Dos Vientos project as a first_step in readying for a trial , City Atty . Mark Sellers said . STEPHANIE SIMON</TEXT>
