   <HEADLINE> LEUKEMIA IS MOST COMMON FORM OF CHILDHOOD CANCER ; DISEASE : EXPERTS SAY THE ILLNESS CAN CAUSE DEATH WITHIN WEEKS . IT REMAINS UNCLEAR IF EARLY DIAGNOSIS COULD HAVE SAVED JULIO CANO ' S LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The disease that apparently led to the death of 12-year-old Julio Cano is the most common form of childhood cancer , sometimes leading to aggressive infections and causing death in a matter of months or even weeks , medical experts said Wednesday . But whether his life might have been saved by a diagnosis of acute_leukemia just a_few days earlier remains uncertain . Childhood leukemia experts said Wednesday that they would need to know much more about the boy ' s case -- including his precise history and which type of leukemia he had -- before reaching a conclusion on whether his death was preventable . Generally speaking , treatment of acute_leukemia in children -- even in its late stages -- has a significant chance of success , said Dr. Stuart Siegel , head of the division of hematology / oncology at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles . A cancer of the bone_marrow and blood , acute_leukemia involves the rampant growth of abnormal white_blood_cells , which essentially crowd_out normal blood_cells and invade body organs , Siegel said . The cause is uncertain , but it is not believed to be hereditary . It might involve some sort of genetic mutation , Siegel said . In Julio ' s case , the disease had affected his spleen , brain , kidney and liver , said Lt . Dan Martini of the Orange County sheriff-coroner ' s office . It was not known how long he had the disease , but one official said it could have been weeks or months . More tests are needed to determine how fast the disease progressed . The disease takes two basic forms . One type , called acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia , has a survival or cure rate of about 70 % after five years if treated , Siegel said . The other type , non-lymphoblastic leukemia , is more difficult to treat and has a 40 % to 50 % survival rate , he said . The chances of successfully treating both forms are reasonably good even if the disease is diagnosed in its late stages , Siegel said . Both forms are treated with chemotherapy , although non-lymphoblastic leukemia also may require a bone_marrow transplant . Symptoms of acute_leukemia may include paleness caused by anemia , fever , bruising easily , bone pain , skin_rashes and an enlarged liver or spleen . The disease might develop for a period of months , Siegel said , but symptoms can &quot; come_on very quickly . . . . It could happen within a period of a week. &quot; Because symptoms often occur late , many patients do not to seek early treatment , he said . A parent might initially mistake some symptoms for the flu , except that the condition does not go_away , he said . Dr. Alexis Thompson , assistant_professor of pediatric hematology and oncology at the UCLA School_of_Medicine , said an alert general_practitioner usually will be able to detect signs of the disease . It is diagnosed using blood_tests and bone_marrow biopsies . &quot; There are children who die under the best of circumstances , &quot; she said , even with relatively prompt treatment . She said an aggressive infection -- which Julio may have suffered -- can overwhelm a child &quot; even before we ' re able to give adequate chemotherapy. &quot; Times medical writer Thomas H .
