   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE ; EXERCISE IN UTILITY ; GAS CO . HOPES ' GREEN DESIGN ' BUILDING WILL SET AN EXAMPLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In January , when visitors step into the lobby of Southern California Gas Co. ' s newly opened Energy Resource Center in Downey , they ' ll find themselves standing on the wreckage of a condemned San Francisco warehouse , surrounded by a junkyard of smashed windows , wrecked airplanes and worn car_tires . But they won ' t see any of this detritus . What they will see is a relaxed , graciously appointed entrance area -- quiet , airy and plant-filled , illuminated by indirect sunlight and subtle electric bulbs . There ' s no contradiction : The Energy Resource Center , now under construction , will be one of Southern California ' s first recycled buildings . It is also one of the world ' s most ambitious high-tech examples of the architecture and construction communities ' new interest in what is known as green design , or sustainable architecture . &quot; There ' s been a recognition that our environment is fragile , &quot; said Larry Wolff , principal of Wolff / Lang / Christopher Architects Inc. of Rancho Cucamonga , the design leader on the project . &quot; People are now realizing that we have to start facing the music and do business a little differently. &quot; The ERC , a demonstration building , is not just using a_few recycled products here and there . It is being built mostly from parts of the Gas Co . office_building that once stood on the site . Instead of demolishing the old structure , the company dismantled it and reused roughly 400 tons of material . The rest of the 43 # 000-square-foot building will be composed of hundreds of innovative recycled products , ranging from nontoxic paints to new environmentally sensitive heating and air-conditioning systems to benches made from recycled plastic . Gas Co . officials and environmentalists hope the ERC will demonstrate to the public and the building industry that energy efficiency and environmental sensitivity can be not only effective and aesthetically pleasing , but also affordable . &quot; There ' s a perception out there that these things are horrendously more expensive to build , &quot; said Bill Browning , director of the Rocky Mountain Institute ' s Green Development Services , an environmental think_tank in Old Snowmass , Colo . In fact , Browning says , the higher initial cost of sustainable architecture is often more_than made_up for in reduced energy and maintenance costs . * The Gas Co . estimates the ERC will cost between $ 5.9 million and $ 6.5 million to build -- a figure that does not include an estimated $ 3.2 million saved by using materials from the old structure and by building on a site the company already owned . Wolff said the specifically green characteristics of the building will add somewhere between $ 225 # 000 and $ 275 # 000 to the final price . But features ranging from super-insulating windows to digital sensors that raise and lower the lights according to sunlight level will cut energy costs by an estimated $ 25 # 000 a year , thus canceling_out the added expense in about 10 years . &quot; Every major feature had to be just as financially feasible as it was environmentally correct , &quot; said John Picard , president of E2 Environmental Enterprises Inc. , a Marina del Rey-based consulting_firm that is the environmentalist on the ERC design team . &quot; We ' re not painting a future that ' s out_of_reach . This technology is available for people who are building right now. &quot; Sustainable architecture first became popular for a brief period in the late 1960s and early 1970s , but interest soon dwindled as the energy crisis of 1973-74 faded from memory . Recently , though , there have been signs that green design is again gaining attention as a way to reduce environmental destruction and rising energy costs . &quot; You can see a groundswell ( of interest in green design ) taking_hold right now , &quot; said Carl Costello , director of the Center for the Environment , a division of the American Institute of Architects in Washington . Costello ' s committee is only a_few years old , but it already has 2 # 000 members . And though the total number of sustainable design projects apparently remains small -- the Rocky Mountain Institute is tracking about 80 notable projects around the world -- they sometimes have a high profile : No lesser building than the White_House itself was recently greened . The Gas Co . aims to gain more_than good publicity from the ERC . When the California Public_Utilities Commission deregulated the state ' s natural_gas industry in 1988 , large segments of the Gas Co. ' s business were opened_up to competition , forcing the utility to look beyond its traditional business . As part of its expanded mission , the company hopes to advise building owners not just on natural_gas issues , but on a whole range of energy problems , including design issues that affect energy consumption . If all goes according to plan , the ERC will never really be finished , Picard said . The ERC will adopt new lighting , air conditioning and other technologies and materials as they come_to market . Innovative leasing agreements with an air-conditioning company and a company that makes carpeting from recycled materials call_for the vendors to replace old equipment or worn carpeting over the years . * Robert Goulden , the Gas Co. ' s senior project manager for the ERC , has worked_on dozens of construction projects during his 25-year career , but he considers the ERC building one of the most exciting and important . &quot; We can ' t afford to continue to do things the old way , &quot; he said . &quot; The cost to the environment , to the Earth , is too high. &quot; Recycled Building The Gas Co . is using a wide array of recycled material for its Energy Resouce Center in Downey , due_to be completed in the spring of 1995 . An existing office complex is being dismantled piece by piece and 60 % to 70 % of the old building will be incorporated into the new construction . Here ' s a look_at how the company is using recycled or reused material : * A The Building Part of a retired World_War_II Navy attack_submarine will be melted_down and used to make part of the building ' s steel frame . In addition , weapons confiscated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department have been melted_down and will be used to make reinforcing bars . Recycled newspapers will make_up the wall paneling , and the panels will be covered with sisal , a fabric made from recycled tropical plants . * B The Entry Walkway Scraps of orange polyvinylcloride pipe that was used to transport natural_gas underground will be chopped_up and thrown into the concrete mix to add color . Hundreds of bricks from the original building facade will also be used on the walkway . * C The Parking Lot Rubber automobile_tires will be boiled and used as a slurry coat to resurface the parking_lot . The rubber is expected to produce higher wear resistance and skid resistance , and reduce noise . * D The Reception Area The floor will be made of Douglas fir beams and posts from the old Banana Republic warehouse in San Francisco , which was built_in the 1890s and condemned after the Loma Prieta earthquake . An accent wall will be made entirely of recycled aircraft aluminum . The countertop of the reception area desk will be made of recycled tempered glass .</TEXT>
