   <HEADLINE> STILL-LIFE MASTERPIECE ; MEMBERS OF CAMARILLO CHURCH POSE TO RE-CREATE FAMED NATIVITY PAINTING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The painting is perhaps the single canvas that secured a place in art history for a little-known Dutch painter . Though Gerrit van Honthorst enjoyed the patronage of powerful Italian noblemen and studied under the master painter Caravaggio , it was the luminous &quot; Adoration of the Shepherds &quot; that lifted him from obscurity . The power of the 1620 painting -- a depiction of the birth of Christ using subtle yet lustrous tones -- captured the imagination of an eastern Camarillo church congregation that wanted to re-create a living Nativity scene based on one of the art world ' s masterpieces . &quot; We selected it from about five paintings researched from the Renaissance and Baroque periods , &quot; said Craig Misuradze , production director for Crossroads Community Church , which is sponsoring the production . &quot; When we first saw it , we knew that it was the one , &quot; he said . &quot; I think we are all moved by it -- you could even say it spoke_to us. &quot; That was last summer . Now some six months later , the evangelical church is presenting a human-scale outdoor rendering of the painting -- reproduced down to the color of its rich , brown backdrop , the design of the shepherds ' clothing and the way light radiates from the face of the Christ child . &quot; We didn ' t want to do_it if we weren ' t going_to be true_to the art , &quot; Misuradze said . &quot; We wanted to do something that was both meaningful in terms of art and religion. &quot; For two hours each evening now through Dec . 23 , members of the public can witness and compare for themselves the accuracy of the living reproduction . To help them , Misuradze said , organizers have placed a framed poster of the original painting nearby . Two sets of costumed church_members playing the shepherds , Joseph and Mary will each take an hour shift during the nightly production , Misuradze said . Overhead , cherubs circle on a painted backdrop . A porcelain-crafted Christ child will stand_in for a real baby ; organizers fear exposing a child to the evening cold . Misuradze said more_than 200 members of the church will take_part in the production . &quot; We have gone so far as_to even dye fabric so it would match the colors of the painting , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s been a very painstaking process , but it ' s also been a labor of love. &quot; Glenn Harcourt , an assistant_professor of art history at the University of Southern California , said Crossroads picked an interesting painter ' s canvas to re-create . Harcourt , a specialist in Northern European Renaissance and Baroque painting , said many of van Honthorst ' s canvases involved images of secular , earthy scenes that detailed day-to-day human existence . A student of the famed Italian painter Caravaggio , van Honthorst became expert in his use of his master ' s trademark chiaroscuro : the partial illumination of figures against a painting ' s dark background , Harcourt said . He even assumed an Italian nickname : Gherardo delle Notti . It was his expertise in the manipulation of light that made his religious works stand_out among the rest of his portfolio . &quot; I would say that ' Adoration of the Shepherds ' is arguably one of his most powerful works , &quot; Harcourt said . &quot; Through his control of the light , he was able to make_it appear that the sole source of light is coming from the Christ child himself . It ' s really quite remarkable. &quot; Ironically , the painting that helped lift van Honthorst from the shadows of his masters was destroyed in 1993 when a terrorist ' s car_bomb damaged a section of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence , Italy , where it was_on display . While Crossroads Pastor Tom Brewer called the painting ' s destruction a tragedy , he said that he and members of the church take comfort in the fact that through their living display , more people will come_to know van Honthorst ' s work . &quot; The painting captures the phenomenal sense of the event , &quot; Brewer said . &quot; It has both a sense of the celestial and the earthly . I don ' t think our people could have picked a better painting to make come alive. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) FYI Members of the Crossroads Community Church will re-create a living version of Gerrit van Honthorst ' s famous Nativity painting , &quot; Adoration of the Shepherds. &quot; The free presentation , which began Friday , will run nightly from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. through Dec . 23 .
