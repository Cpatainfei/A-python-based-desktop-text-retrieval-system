   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN SCIENTIST FACES TRIAL FOR CHEMICAL-ARMS REPORT ; RIGHTS : U.S. HAS LOBBIED IN VAIN FOR OPEN PROCEEDINGS . CASE WILL TEST MOSCOW ' S DEFINITION OF FREE SPEECH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite protests from U.S. officials and international human_rights groups , a Russian scientist who publicized an alleged covert chemical-weapons program faces trial Thursday on charges of divulging state secrets . The closed-door trial of Vil S . Mirzayanov , the first dissident of Boris N . Yeltsin ' s presidency , comes just days before President Clinton is scheduled to arrive in Moscow for summit talks . The U.S. State_Department , which has repeatedly expressed concern about the Mirzayanov case , had lobbied for an open trial with international observers permitted . &quot; Please do not think democratization has succeeded . It hasn ' t , &quot; Mirzayanov said in an interview Tuesday after warning visitors that the conversation in his Moscow apartment was being wiretapped . The prosecution of the 59-year-old chemist raises questions about how the new Russia will define free speech when the subject is national security -- and whether the old Soviet security and legal_systems can be reformed . Mirzayanov was arrested in October , 1992 , for publishing a newspaper_article alleging that Russian scientists were producing a new and highly potent type of chemical weapon as late as the spring of 1992 -- that is , more_than two years after the Soviet_Union signed an agreement to halt production of chemical weapons , and several months after Yeltsin promised to abide_by the ban . Mirzayanov and co-author Lev Fyodorov wrote that chemists at the Government All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Organic_Chemistry and Technology had concocted a nerve agent more toxic than any previously known . They warned that an accident could also endanger Muscovites living near the drab institute on the northeastern outskirts of the capital . Mirzayanov was held for 12 days in a former KGB prison and then released , but he is not allowed to leave Moscow . He says he spent nearly a year reading and copying by hand the five volumes of evidence against him . Meanwhile , his wife , Nuria , traveled_to the United States to accept on her husband ' s behalf a special award for &quot; moral courage &quot; from the Cavallo Foundation , a nonprofit organization in Cambridge , Mass . Nuria Mirzayanov and Fyodorov also met with State_Department officials to voice their concerns . Mirzayanov said he believes that chemical-weapon research at the plant is &quot; in stagnation &quot; but that the research provides &quot; a good foundation &quot; for future weaponry should it be desired . The scientist said he is particularly concerned that the stockpiled toxin , or its ingredients , could be exported to such nations as Iraq or Libya . The chemicals in_question , which he said he could not name , are not on the list of substances that Yeltsin has banned from export because they are known components for chemical weapons , Mirzayanov said . Mirzayanov says that evidence against him has been falsified , that the commission set_up to investigate his &quot; crimes &quot; was packed with KGB employees and that he never had access to the classified data he is accused of disclosing . He said he doubts he can get a fair trial behind closed doors . Mirzayanov argues that political reform has been superficial . While former dissidents can now freely criticize Cabinet_ministers , the &quot; machine &quot; of state repression has not been dismantled by the Yeltsin government and continues to be used against critics of the still powerful military-industrial complex , he said . &quot; The machine is working , and Yeltsin cannot stop it without damage to himself , &quot; Mirzayanov said . &quot; Yeltsin does not run the machine . Yeltsin can influence only some separate parts . . . . &quot; I have the impression that he is imprisoned by the military , the KGB , the Interior Ministry . He does not have a wide range of choices. &quot; Prosecutors have had little to say about the case . At the time of Mirzayanov ' s arrest , the Security Ministry -- the renamed KGB -- issued a statement saying he had impermissibly disclosed information &quot; about developments in the field of chemical technology. &quot; In April , Security Ministry officials summoned a Baltimore Sun reporter who had interviewed Mirzayanov for a four-hour interrogation at Lefortovo prison . The American reporter , as well as two Russian journalists , were among the witnesses who were listed to be called by the government to testify at the trial . Rep . John Conyers Jr . ( D-Mich. ) , one of several U.S. lawmakers who have urged the Clinton_Administration to pursue the case , said he was &quot; deeply troubled &quot; by the news that a closed trial is expected . &quot; The continuation of closed and secret trials in Russia is very disturbing , especially on the eve of the upcoming summit , &quot; Conyers said in a statement , adding that he would ask Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher to appeal personally for Mirzayanov ' s release . &quot; Whistle-blowers on both sides of the now-defunct Iron_Curtain deserve protection , not prosecution , &quot; Conyers said . U.S. officials said the Mirzayanov case is_on the agenda of pre-summit meetings in Moscow of U.S. and Russian human_rights officials scheduled to begin today . The talks , which are to be held periodically , are aimed at building a less confrontational working relationship on human_rights . The Russian side is expected to use the forum to discuss human_rights problems of Russian minorities in the newly independent former Soviet republics , the officials said .</TEXT>
