   <HEADLINE> JAPAN PREMIER LANDS SURPRISE DEAL ON REFORM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party early today reached a surprise eleventh-hour compromise on political reforms that promised to end a mounting challenge to Hosokawa ' s grasp on power . In an unprecedented joint news_conference on national TV that began well after midnight here , Hosokawa and LDP leader Yohei Kono signed a 10-point agreement containing a pledge to enact a new reform package . The breakthrough , if approved by Parliament before the current legislative session ends at midnight tonight , would eliminate pressure on Hosokawa to resign or call a general_election . It would also clear the path for Hosokawa to meet President Clinton in Washington on Feb . 11 as scheduled and allow him to dispose_of a logjam of pending economic measures . The agreement stipulated enactment of the reforms before the debate on Japan ' s fiscal 1994 budget begins , implying action by March at the latest . The new fiscal_year starts April 1 . Parliamentary approval is expected but not guaranteed . The possibility remains that new rebellions could occur in both Hosokawa ' s coalition and Kono ' s LDP to scuttle the compromise when it is put to a vote this afternoon . A revolt in the LDP helped pass Hosokawa ' s reforms in Parliament ' s powerful lower house last Nov . 18 , while an uprising by Socialists , the largest group in the Hosokawa coalition , led to defeat of the bills in the upper house Jan . 21 . Hosokawa , who suggested last August that he would resign if he failed to enact political reforms , conceded that the compromise contained &quot; large concessions. &quot; The original package would have cleaned_up Japan ' s scandal-ridden political_system by eliminating corporate and labor-union donations to individual politicians and changing the way the lower house is elected . The prime_minister was forced to drop the ban on contributions . Under the compromise , donations from any single company or union will be limited to 500 # 000 yen ( $ 4 # 587 ) a year . In the news_conference , Kono cited this concession as the greatest &quot; ordeal &quot; for Hosokawa . The Socialists , condemning corporate funds as a hotbed of bribery , had insisted vehemently on a total ban . Hosokawa defended the concession by pointing_out that the reform would limit politicians to receiving corporate funds from a single body . And in five years , all corporate and union donations would be banned . Tomiichi Murayama , the Socialists ' chairman , called the concession &quot; unfortunate but unavoidable. &quot; He said the party ' s leadership would back the compromise , but he added that members ' approval would have to be sought later today . Hosokawa said he and Kono share the belief that &quot; without reaching a conclusion to the problem of political reform , which has been debated for more_than five years , the economy will not perform well . Recovery of the people ' s trust in politics will be impossible . And international trust in Japan will decline more and more. &quot; Even with the compromise , the reform bills would constitute the biggest overhaul of Japanese politics since the American occupation of Japan after World_War_II . Parliamentary red_tape forced the compromise . With only a day left in the current session , too_little time was left to print revised bills , as required . Now , a 20-member joint committee from the upper and lower houses must approve the compromise by a two-thirds majority . With one Communist and a member of an upper house splinter_group expected to vote no , as few as four LDP members of the joint committee could sabotage the agreement . If the committee approves it , however , a simple majority in both houses would be sufficient to approve the government ' s four original reform bills , each stripped of an enforcement date . Revisions to implement the Hosokawa-Kono compromise , as well as a date for enactment , would then be added during the next session of Parliament , which begins Monday . A new lower house electoral_system was expected to lead toward a two-party system capable of producing changes in government . Until last summer , when their 38-year rule was broken , the Liberal Democrats had towered over an array of opposition parties , none strong enough to mount a power challenge on its own . Only by embracing seven parties in the lower house and eight in the upper chamber was Hosokawa able to take power in August . Until now the system for electing lower-house representatives enabled a candidate to win with 20 % of the votes or less and led to a proliferation of small parties . It would be replaced with a combination of single-seat districts and proportional_representation . A method of counting party votes by regions , instead of throughout the nation , was also approved . Redistricting would substantially decrease the weight of farmers ' votes , which are now worth about three times that of urban votes . Saturday ' s joint appearance by Hosokawa and Kono symbolized a new relationship between ruling party and opposition : Never before have a prime_minister and an opposition chieftain appeared together at a news_conference . The two announced their agreement after more_than six hours of talks attended by only Ichiro Ozawa , deputy chief of the coalition ' s Renewal Party , and Yoshiro Mori , the Liberal Democrats ' secretary_general .</TEXT>
