   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION : ' MODELS INC. ' : PERFECT FOR SGTV ; SG STANDS FOR SUPERB GARBAGE , RAISED HERE TO AN ART_FORM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Everyone is here . I feel so unbelievably average -- Gorgeous model attending Malibu party in &quot; Models Inc. &quot; NBC ' s &quot; Now With Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric &quot; and CBS ' &quot; America Tonight &quot; are turning 9 p.m. Wednesdays into television ' s gathering place for Inquiring Minds . If recent tradition holds , you know what that will probably mean tonight : O.J. time . So do yourself a favor and tune_in something that promises to be infinitely more fun , if just as witless . Fox has the real America tonight . It ' s releasing no episodes of its new summer series , &quot; Models Inc. , &quot; for preview . Obviously , the producers don ' t want to be embarrassed by advance praise for their depiction of the &quot; intrigue , envy and heartbreak &quot; of &quot; the glamorous world of modeling. &quot; Nice try , but it won ' t work . In advance of tonight ' s second episode ( at 9 on KTTV-TV Channel 11 ) , here ' s the word on last week ' s 90-minute premiere for those who didn ' t watch : It was so unbelievably below average that it was endearing . Just missing greatness , it was not quite bad enough to be hilarious , but plenty bad enough to be amusing . Which was probably the intent . Much of television is garbage , yet very little of it Superb Garbage ( SG ) , television that knows it ' s garbage and wants to be garbage , all_the while sculpting garbage into art . &quot; Dallas &quot; and &quot; Dynasty &quot; were quintessential SG , for example , mountainous mounds of richly satisfying rubbish , utterly transcendent in their manifestation of this underrated genre . When it comes_to delivering a message about the way certain segments of Los Angeles live , Aaron Spelling ' s &quot; Models Inc. &quot; is in a hallowed category with his famed &quot; Hollywood Wives , &quot; which first ran_on ABC in 1985 . Arguably the most SG miniseries of our time , it was so unabashedly mindless that watching it was pure joy . Remember ? &quot; Movie_star Ross Conti slept_with his makeup girl before sleeping_with playgirl Karen Lancaster , daughter of a superstar who once slept_with a 15-year-old girl on his dressing room floor . Scheming sex priestess Gina Germaine slept_with studio head Oliver Eastern and then with director Neil Gray . . . who had heart_failure in bed with Gina while his wife , Montana , was in bed with aspiring actor Buddy Hudson , a former prostitute who didn ' t know that he and his homicidal twin were the illegitimate sons of Ross Conti and super agent Sadi Lasalle . &quot; Then they all did lunch . &quot; Although &quot; Models Inc. &quot; doesn ' t yet reach that level of artistic trash , it definitely has SG potential . A spinoff from Spelling ' s &quot; Melrose Place &quot; on Fox , &quot; Models Inc. &quot; portrays &quot; beautiful young_women struggling to succeed in one of the most competitive , yet sought-after professions. &quot; Real-life models naturally will recognize it as being accurate to the smallest detail . The young , exquisite models have a matriarchal leader . Their mentor and landlord ( they live_in her Malibu house ) is glamorously ruthless agency owner Hillary Michaels ( Linda Gray ) , who was introduced last season as the mother of the nasty Amanda on Fox ' s &quot; Melrose Place. &quot; Last week on &quot; Models Inc. , &quot; before even 10 minutes had elapsed , magnificent model Teri Spencer ( Stephanie Romanov ) was removing her dress on the beach and sinking to the sand with handsome photographer Brian Peterson ( Cameron Daddo ) . Or was it Teri and handsome Eric Dearborn ( David Goldsmith ) ? Or Brian and Eric ? At this stage , everyone was looking alike . In any event , the next day , Teri told Hillary she was leaving the agency . Then Hillary and Teri quarreled . Then Hillary and Brian quarreled . Then beautiful model Julie Dante ( Kylie Travis ) told a handsome photographer named Josh she ' d &quot; do anything &quot; for a shooting session . Then she came_on to her former lover , Hillary ' s handsome son , David ( Brian Gaskill ) . Then Brian met Teri at a bar , and they quarreled . Next , Julie , beautiful new model Sarah Owens ( Cassidy Rae ) , beautiful model Linda Holden ( Teresa Hill ) , Teri and her beautiful sister , model Carrie ( Carrie-Anne Moss ) , were splashing_around in a hot tub . Teri and Carrie quarreled . Then Julie and Josh had_sex on his mat . Then Sarah ' s first modeling assignment at a motorcycle show ended badly when the client came_on to her . Then Linda kicked_out Eric . Then Julie and Sarah quarreled . Hillary revealed that she walked_out on_her_own daughter . Julie and Sarah quarreled again . Julie and Carrie quarreled . Brian and Hillary quarreled . David and Teri quarreled . Brian and David quarreled . At her farewell party , in an unforeseen plot twist , Teri quarreled with no one . However , Teri did tell Carrie to get lost . Then Teri was murdered . Julie called Josh a &quot; pompous windbag and an immoral creep. &quot; David came_on to Sarah . On the screen together , these two kids were every bit as torrid as George and Gracie . What an acting clinic . Meanwhile , Julie told Sarah , &quot; You ' re finished , bitch ! &quot; When the premiere episode ended , &quot; Models Inc. &quot; rolled in highlights of tonight ' s intrigue , envy and heartbreak , with Hillary becoming a suspect in Teri ' s murder , and just about the entire unbelievably above-average looking cast attending Teri ' s funeral . Where naturally they quarreled .</TEXT>
