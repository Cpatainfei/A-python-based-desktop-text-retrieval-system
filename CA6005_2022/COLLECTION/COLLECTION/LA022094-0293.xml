   <HEADLINE> DAVENPORT EARNING HER DEGREE AS PRO ; TENNIS : MURRIETA VALLEY HIGH SENIOR IS KNOCKING_ON THE DOOR OF TOP 10 AS SHE READIES FOR EVERT CUP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lindsay Davenport turned professional during her junior year at Murrieta Valley High last February , with the goal of breaking_into the top 50 during her first year on the Women ' s Tennis Assn . tour . It took her all_of two weeks . Davenport , quickly gaining a reputation as one of the tour ' s hardest hitters , is_on the verge of the top 10 as she enters the Evert Cup , which starts Monday at Hyatt Grand Champions in Indian Wells . Davenport , 17 , launched her pro career in the Evert Cup last year , reaching the quarterfinals . The next week , she upset Gabriela Sabatini in the round of 16 at the Virginia Slims of Florida and moved to No . 48 in the WTA computer rankings -- after starting her pro career at No . 99 . She hasn ' t been out of the top 50 since , peaking at No . 12 two weeks ago , when for seven days she was the top-ranked U.S.-born player on the tour . &quot; It ' s really kind of been amazing , &quot; said Davenport , currently ranked 14th . Still in school -- she will graduate in June during a trip home to Riverside County between the_French Open and Wimbledon -- she has won two tournaments and earned more_than $ 300 # 000 . Davenport , Tennis magazine ' s 1993 female rookie of the year , started the new year by winning a tournament in Brisbane , Australia , and reaching the quarterfinals at the Australian Open , her best showing in a Grand_Slam event . &quot; She ' s definitely up and coming , &quot; said Mary Joe Fernandez , who lost to Davenport in the round of 16 at the Australian Open . &quot; She ' s a very strong girl and hits the ball extremely hard. &quot; Gigi Fernandez said Davenport has developed &quot; a forehand as_good_as Steffi Graf ' s. &quot; Lynne Rolley , director of player development for the U.S. Tennis Assn. , said Davenport ' s potential is unlimited , adding : &quot; She could be a No . 1 player. &quot; Her rapid rise has come as a shock to Davenport . &quot; It ' s all happened kind of fast , &quot; she said . &quot; Every week , it just seemed like my ranking kept going_up . I don ' t think you can predict that. &quot; It might come as a surprise to those who know her parents , Wink and Ann , that Davenport has achieved such success in tennis and not in volleyball . At 6 feet 2 , she is a towering figure on a tennis_court . Her father , who is 6-8 , played_on the U.S. Olympic volleyball team in 1968 , worked as a volleyball referee in the 1984 Los Angeles Games and is now secretary of the international referees committee of FIBA , the sport ' s international governing body . Her mother , who is 5-10 , is commissioner of the Southern California Volleyball Assn . One sister , Leiann , 33 , played volleyball at UC Irvine , and the other , Shannon , 20 , plays_at St . Mary ' s College . Her parents , though , urged Lindsay to try another sport . &quot; Her ( youngest ) sister was playing volleyball , and we didn ' t want the two of them competing against one another , &quot; her father said . &quot; We wanted them to develop their own habits and their own competitiveness. &quot; Her mother had recently started playing tennis , so Lindsay , 7 at the time , asked if she could play , too . Until two years ago , the family lived_on the Palos Verdes Peninsula , not far from where Tracy Austin grew_up . Robert Lansdorp , a coach who had worked with Austin , also tutored Davenport . &quot; He taught her great fundamentals , &quot; Ann Davenport said . Davenport was 14 when the USTA asked her to join the junior national team . A rapid_growth spurt -- about six inches in two years -- affected her coordination and left her muscles weakened , but didn ' t keep her from improving . Davenport started thinking_about turning pro when she began to dominate her competition at the junior level . She swept the singles and doubles titles at the National Girls ' 18s and Clay Court Championships in 1991 and won the Junior U.S. Open in ' 92 . &quot; Pro tennis was never a goal , &quot; she said . &quot; It was kind of more like a dream . I always really wanted to go_to college and play college tennis . It just turned_out that I improved really quickly and was ready to play pro tennis. &quot; She made the move after reaching the third round of the ' 93 Australian Open as an amateur . Her mother said : &quot; She came_home and said , ' I ' ve been doing some thinking and if I want to get any better , I have to move_up to the next level. ' It came as a shock . We weren ' t quite ready for it. &quot; Her daughter was . Although she has continued to climb in the rankings , Lindsay Davenport sees plenty of room for improvement . Despite her size , she is reluctant to charge the net . &quot; I ' m pretty much a baseliner , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' ve got_to work_at coming_in , and I have been doing that the last year a little more . &quot; I can improve on a lot of things . First , my fitness , so I can get faster on the court . That will be a big key -- if I can improve that . I ' m trying to improve my serve and make_it a really big weapon . It ' s gotten better in the last year , and it can still get better. &quot;</TEXT>
