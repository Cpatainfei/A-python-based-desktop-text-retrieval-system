   <HEADLINE> STOP THE DRUGGING OF OUR CHILDREN ; TOBACCO : INCREASE SMOKE-FREE AREAS , TAKES STEPS TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION AND GET THE NICOTINE OUT OF CIGARETTES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This year , some of the world ' s most powerful corporations will hook millions of American children on a drug that is as addictive as heroin or cocaine -- and far more deadly than either . Unless we act now , many of these children will die from their addiction decades from now . The drug is nicotine . And the corporations are America ' s tobacco companies . The tobacco companies market image , but the cold statistics show that cigarettes kill nearly half a_million Americans every year . The annual cost to our health-care system is tens of billions of dollars in preventable expenses . The tobacco companies ' success -- and the sickness and death that result -- start with kids . The companies spend billions on advertising_campaigns that entice young teen-agers to smoke . Each year hundreds of thousands of teen-agers become lifelong addicts , destined to die of lung_cancer , heart_disease and other tobacco-related causes . Even those kids who reject cigarettes are not safe . Their health is threatened by exposure to other people ' s tobacco smoke . Despite the overwhelming evidence of the risks of smoking , the tobacco companies have been chillingly effective in stopping proposals to regulate the use of tobacco . It ' s time to fight_back . Four simple measures would protect all_of us , especially our children : The first and easiest step is a law requiring smoke-free public areas and workplaces . I have introduced the Smoke-Free Environment Act , which would restrict smoking to separately ventilated rooms in virtually all non-residential buildings . Last month , the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed to achieve the same result by regulation . Enactment of the legislation or adoption of the OSHA regulation would produce enormous benefits at minimal cost . Nonsmoking people would be protected from carcinogenic tobacco smoke . Hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children could go_to restaurants , bowling_alleys and other public places without fear of a life-threatening attack . And building owners would save billions by avoiding the costs of cleaning_up cigarette smoke and ashes . Even smokers would benefit , because quitting is much easier in smoke-free environments . According to the federal Environmental Protection Agency , compliance with a national smoke-free policy in public and workplaces would , each year , save 38 # 000 to 108 # 000 lives and produce $ 11.5 billion to $ 29 billion in medical and economic savings -- all for a cost of less than $ 1 billion annually . The next two steps are to raise the tax on tobacco and to restrict cigarette advertising . These measures share a common goal : to protect health by reducing the consumption of cigarettes . According to some estimates , increasing the tax on a pack of cigarettes by $ 2 could reduce tobacco use by 23 % , eventually save the lives of 2 million Americans and raise more_than $ 23 billion each year for health-care reform . The advertising restrictions are particularly important for children , who are the targets of cigarette ad_campaigns featuring &quot; Joe Camel &quot; and Marlboro ' s &quot; Adventure Team. &quot; The Tobacco Education and Child Protection Act , which I introduced last fall , would stop the tobacco_industry ' s most abusive tactics , such_as advertising and distributing free samples near schools . New and bigger warning labels would also be required on all advertisements . The last reform is to get nicotine out of cigarettes . Among adult smokers , 70 % say they would quit if they could . Removing addictive nicotine from cigarettes would allow these smokers to choose for themselves whether to continue to smoke . For children especially , nicotine-free cigarettes would be a literal lifesaver . If there were no nicotine , youthful experimentation with cigarettes would not lead to addiction . These four reforms -- all overdue -- would end the special treatment tobacco companies receive from the federal_government . And they may now be possible . Public sentiment is surging against the tobacco companies as never before . Almost daily another company or state or local_government announces new restrictions on smoking . Indeed , last month , Congress passed legislation to ban smoking in schools , day-care centers and medical clinics that receive federal funding . We must face a reality too long ignored and finally take decisive action against tobacco . Nothing less than the lives of hundreds of thousands of our children are at stake .</TEXT>
