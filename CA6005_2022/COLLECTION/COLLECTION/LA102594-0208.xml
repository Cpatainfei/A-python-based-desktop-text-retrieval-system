   <HEADLINE> GERMAN PARLIAMENT MEMBERS LINKED TO SECRET_POLICE ; POLITICS : COMMUNIST LEADER GREGOR GYSI , OTHER PARTY LAWMAKERS FROM EAST ARE ACCUSED OF BEING EX-INFORMANTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The reformed communist_Party of Democratic Socialism , fresh from celebrating its triumph in last week ' s federal election , was under siege Monday with allegations that some of its recently elected members_of_Parliament had been informants for the East_German secret_police . The controversy centered_on the party ' s charismatic leader , Gregor Gysi , after two influential national magazines reported that newly discovered documents have revealed that , as a lawyer in East_Germany , Gysi informed on his dissident clients and received gifts from the secret_police , known as Stasi . Political opponents , including former Gysi client and leftist Greens Party legislator Gerd Poppe , called_on the PDS leader to quit his seat in Parliament or clear_up the charges . Gysi has long maintained his innocence when it comes_to the Stasi , and a parliamentary committee found no proof of any secret_police activities on his part when they investigated eastern deputies after the 1990 election . On Monday , he told ARD television : &quot; I have not cooperated with the Stasi . I have not betrayed clients . Just the formulation of a suspicion cannot be sufficient for me to give_up my seat. &quot; Gysi aide Dieter Liemann dismissed the new charges as a tired campaign aimed at discrediting the reinvigorated party . The PDS won 30 seats in the 672-seat German Parliament on Oct . 16 , in large part due_to the dynamic style of Gysi , who was voted_in for a second term . &quot; I think this is naturally connected with the election gains , &quot; Liemann said in a telephone_interview . &quot; If you want to weaken the PDS , you pounce on the most prominent person. &quot; The scandal arises just days after the PDS pressured one of its own newly elected deputies , Kerstin Kaiser-Nicht , to give_up her seat because of Stasi activities . During the campaign , the 34-year-old Kaiser-Nicht reluctantly admitted that she had informed on fellow German students while studying Slav languages in Leningrad between 1979 and 1984 . Eastern voters elected her anyway , but PDS leaders said that she had shown no remorse for her activities and they did not want to work with her in Parliament . Another PDS deputy , Rolf Kutzmutz , also has admitted that he was a Stasi informer , but the party is not seeking his resignation because he openly acknowledged that he had reported on material shortages in the former East_Germany . His campaign posters stated , &quot; My Biography Does Not Begin in 1989. &quot; The new Parliament will be sworn_in on Nov . 10 in Berlin , and PDS member Stefan Heym is to give the opening address as the eldest member of the Bundestag . The PDS presents itself as a protest party representing easterners , and many eastern Germans who voted for the PDS said they feel the traditional political_parties dominated by westerners do not adequately represent their interests . Many easterners are disappointed with the high costs of capitalism and nostalgic for the social benefits of their old Communist system . Chancellor Helmut Kohl dismisses the PDS as &quot; red-painted fascists &quot; and &quot; Communist rabble , &quot; and many western politicians do not believe anyone associated with the former Communist_party belongs in Parliament . Now , some members_of_Parliament are asking if Gysi belongs there . In Monday ' s issue of the conservative weekly magazine Focus , former dissident author Lutz Rathenow wrote that he recently discovered reports in his Stasi file with information from his attorney . &quot; I only had Gregor Gysi as an attorney , &quot; Rathenow wrote , echoing the charges of several other dissidents . Rathenow called_for Gysi ' s law license to be revoked , while Greens legislator Poppe called_for him to step_down from Parliament . On television , Poppe said he also had found information in his Stasi file that could only have come from Gysi , who was his attorney at the time . The weekly magazine Der Spiegel , meanwhile , reported that the office in_charge of Stasi files informed the PDS last week that it had discovered receipts for 100-mark ( about $ 70 ) birthday and Christmas_gifts that a Stasi officer had bought for Gysi , and that the receipts &quot; harden the suspicion &quot; that Gysi was an informant . The receipts were discovered in a file on Gysi called &quot; Sputnik. &quot; Gysi argues that the file reporting on him proves he was not a collaborator .</TEXT>
