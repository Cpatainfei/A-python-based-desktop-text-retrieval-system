   <TEXT> at the Cotton Bowl Dallas Brazil vs . Netherlands * TIME : 12:35 p.m. PDT * TV : ABC , Univision * KEY MATCHUPS : This is a game worthy of the semifinals because many believe undefeated Brazil ( 3-0-1 ) and the_Netherlands ( 3-1-0 ) are among the four best teams in the World Cup . Romario and Bebeto will take their explosive attack to the Dutch . If they can break_loose often enough , Brazil will be in great position . But Brazil cannot overlook the aggressive Dutch style . Led by Dennis Bergkamp , Holland can be as explosive as Brazil . While much has been said about Brazil ' s offense , it has almost gone unnoticed that the team has allowed only one goal in four games , that in a 1-1 draw with Sweden . Brazil ' s best defense is controlling the ball with its remarkable finesse . * OUTLOOK : When teams at this level meet there are few surprises . The players know each other from club play and know what to expect . Brazil has replaced Leonardo , suspended for four games for elbowing Tab Ramos , with Branco . Neither team will change tactics today . &quot; We can ' t change our system , &quot; Brazilian midfielder Mazinho said . &quot; We have to keep playing the way we do. &quot; Said Dick Advocaat , Holland ' s coach , &quot; We will try to play our game and we will try not to allow Brazil to play their game . That is all we can do. &quot; * OUTCOME : Everyone will be watching the famous strikers , but the match will turn_on defense . No doubt each side will get its chances , but the team that advances will be the one that plays error free . One defensive mistake is all it will take_to lose . The midfield will carry the burden of trying to befuddle the other team ' s attack , stopping a threat before it becomes serious . The Netherlands needs another performance like its stirring 2-0 victory over Ireland in the second round . If it plays as erratically as it did_in Group F , it could be in serious trouble . The Brazilians have something intangible that gives them the edge . Although this is not one of the great Brazilian teams , it has enough talent to continue on its quest_for a fourth world championship . But not by much . This could be decided by penalty kicks . Brazil , 2-1 . ELLIOTT ALMOND</TEXT>
