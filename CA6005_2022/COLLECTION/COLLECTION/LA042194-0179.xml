   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL-PLO TALKS SNARLED BY JURISDICTIONAL DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli and Palestinian negotiators said Wednesday that they had concluded agreements on the transfer of civil administration to Palestinian self-rule but were still trying to unravel a dispute over how much legal jurisdiction Israel will retain in new Palestinian territories . After Maj . Gen . Amnon Shahak , the chief Israeli negotiator , returned from an overnight consultation in Jerusalem , negotiators said they hoped they would be able to break the deadlock over whose laws will apply to non-Palestinians when Palestinians take_over in Jericho and the Gaza Strip . The dispute over legal jurisdiction is one of only a very few remaining out of two_dozen security issues debated , delegates said . But it is considered so fundamental that it is likely to hold_up any final agreement before today ' s scheduled weekend recess in the talks . Palestinians also feared it could delay any final agreement during the scheduled Middle_East visit next week of Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , who will travel_to the region on Sunday . &quot; Unless we finish the jurisdiction issue , we will not be through , &quot; chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said . &quot; Jurisdiction remains a major issue because it affects everything else . Other topics can be delayed , this topic cannot. &quot; Initially , Israel demanded authority over Israelis and all foreigners in the Palestinian autonomous zones , in addition to review over cases involving Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities . Shaath said Palestinians believe that full legal jurisdiction was granted them in the Declaration of Principles signed Sept . 13 by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization . &quot; When we say there is Palestinian jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho , it means that Palestinian law is the one dominating , &quot; Shaath said . &quot; As far as criminal_law goes all_over the world , jurisdiction is for the country involved , meaning if a person commits a crime in London , whether he is Belgian or French , he has to be judged in British courts. &quot; Palestinians said they had essentially concluded accords Wednesday on transfer of all areas of civil administration into Palestinian control , including the difficult issue of water sharing .</TEXT>
