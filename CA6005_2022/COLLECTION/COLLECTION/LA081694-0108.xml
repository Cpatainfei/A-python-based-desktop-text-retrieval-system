   <HEADLINE> BONES OF CONTENTION ; SCIENCE : A COUNTY SUPERVISOR HAS SUGGESTED POSSIBLY SELLING SOME OF THE NATURAL_HISTORY MUSEUM ' S WAREHOUSES OF SPECIMENS TO SAVE MONEY . BUT STAFFERS SAY THE COLLECTIONS ARE VALUABLE FOR RESEARCH AND USE IN FUTURE EXHIBITS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Its name is Purussaurus and it is the largest species of crocodile that ever lived , a massive-jawed creature that thundered through South_America ' s Amazon Basin 6 to 8 million years ago before its kind perished . But at least one of the Purussaurus left a legacy , a grinning 62-inch , half-ton fossilized skull , a cast of which occupies a large space in a storage_area of the Los Angeles County Natural_History Museum . The Purussaurus skull has been_on display only once since the cast was completed in 1991 , having then been rotated back to the relative anonymity of the museum ' s collections . It nevertheless forms an important part of the museum ' s work of research , preservation and exhibition . Indeed , a recent suggestion by a Los Angeles County supervisor that the museum could sell some of its collections and save warehousing costs sent the sober-minded scientists who work there reeling . It would be like trying to sell_off the underwater formation that supports the tip of a spectacular iceberg , they say . * To them , the museum functions almost like a huge theatrical_production , with a cast of thousands in front of and behind the curtains who are equally important in putting_on a good show . &quot; There are lessons to be learned by identifying and studying collections , &quot; said Daniel M . Cohen , the museum ' s deputy director_of_research and collections , sitting in his comfortably lived-in third floor office . &quot; Our exhibits are based on collections , our educational_programs are based on collections . What we try to do is be a window on the world . We ' re a way that people can come_into this building and experience something different. &quot; At the museum ' s five-story Exposition Park home , only about a quarter of the building is used for exhibits , with another quarter housing offices and the rest reserved for its vast collections of specimens . More_than 45 staffers are involved in studying and caring_for the collections , with another 20 to 30 working_on specific projects funded by grants or contracts . Grants from scientific and private_foundations allow the museum to acquire some specimens ; others are gathered by scientists in their research while some large collections are donated . One donated insect collection numbered about 16 # 000 specimens . The museum maintains four off-site facilities that house millions of specimens : hundreds of toe bones of a horse that lived 100 # 000 years ago and whose fossils were found in a cave deposit in northern Mexico ; collections of seashells and plankton from Southern California shores ; shelves of whale , porpoise and seal skeletons , and buckets of unsorted sediments from the famed Rancho La Brea area bearing who knows what fossil gems . A walk through the storage collections and research laboratories of the museum offers a glimpse of scientific artistry that the public rarely sees . Although few specimens will make_it to the big_time , like eager understudies waiting for their break , they all have a story to tell . &quot; This is one reason to have an off-site facility , we bring_in specimens that do smell a bit , &quot; said John Heyning , leading a visitor into a spacious Vernon warehouse , pungent with the smell of decay . The odoriferous building is where the museum houses its main collection of marine mammals and bones of larger terrestrial mammals such_as the hippopotamus . One area is used for dissections and necropsies . Prominent among the rows of shelves is the largest specimen in the entire museum , the one-ton skull of an adult_female blue_whale that was struck and killed by a container_ship in Los Angeles Harbor in 1986 . The weeklong recovery of the whale ' s body and acquisition of the skull proved quite a media event , generating worldwide coverage . Of less interest to the media hordes has been the scientific data collected from the cetacean . Study of the shape of the skull helps to discover how the animal produces sounds and can help determine its relationship to other types of whales . Scientists might also be able to glean insight into the impact of shipping on large whales , said Heyning , associate curator of mammals . &quot; One big misconception of the off-site facilities is that it is just dead storage , but many of the specimens are used in active research , &quot; he said , noting that a delegation from the National Marine Fisheries Service had recently used the facility for training . Heyning offers his statement in rebuttal to suggestions that some collections simply gather dust . Supervisor Gloria Molina requested that the county ' s Citizens Economy and Efficiency Commission study whether it is feasible to donate some of the collections to universities and contract_out collection management services . Budget cutbacks have jeopardized staffing and services at the museum , and officials say it is wise_to try to trim costs wherever possible in the museum ' s $ 7-million budget . &quot; It costs about $ 1.2 million a year in warehousing costs and our concern is how to keep ( the museums ) open seven days a week , &quot; said Molina spokesman Robert Alaniz . &quot; We are certainly not suggesting that the museum get_rid_of all its collections . . . but there can be a look_at what the priorities should be , whether research , education , exhibitions. &quot; But museum officials argue that a top-flight facility -- Los Angeles ' museum is considered one of the best in the country -- must strive to provide all those functions if it aspires to be anything more_than a gallery . They note that items in storage today may be in exhibits tomorrow . For example , many of the Vernon facility ' s specimens -- porpoise , seal and sea_lion skeletons and the_like -- will be used to create a major exhibit that is scheduled to open in October and then tour for five years . &quot; When people see the whole exhibit , it will be very hard to visualize how it got there and what the basis of it is , but it would n ' t be possible without the collections to draw_on , &quot; Cohen said . * Museum curators say there are a number of reasons why some items end_up on display and others do not , including the rarity of a specimen , its quality and value to society and who does the choosing . &quot; If a curator specializes in deep sea crustaceans , like myself , then that is what I ' ll want to put_on exhibit , &quot; said curator of marine invertebrates Joel W . ( Jody ) Martin , who is planning an exhibit of rare crabs and shrimps that thrive in hot water vents located deep under ocean surfaces . His collections in the Exposition Park facility number nearly 3 million crustaceans , housed in more_than 120 # 000 jars . The museum ' s vast collections offer an eclectic mix of the old and historical . A second Vernon warehouse is home to a huge selection of historical objects that offer a record of how Southern Californians from eras past went_about their daily lives . There are re-creations of old stores and drive-ins ; pickle_barrels , tables , chairs and old pictures that are preserved . Another Los Angeles warehouse contains fossils of mollusks , clams , snails and corals , the remains of small plankton and other micro-fossils from Southern California and Mexico . The fourth off-site facility includes archeological materials from the Channel Islands , Native_American artifacts such_as stone tools , utensils , arrowheads and bead and shell jewelry . There are military items of historical significance and agricultural implements that helped establish California as the fruit and vegetable basket of the nation .</TEXT>
