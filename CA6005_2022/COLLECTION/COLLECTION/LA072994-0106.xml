   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : THRILL IS GONE FOR SOCCER FANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Catch Pro Soccer After The World Cup &quot; -- that ' s how the ad copy reads . Except there ' s a catch . No Romario . No Bebeto . ( Though there is a Paulinho , a midfielder from Criciuma , Brazil , who once played in the same league with Romario and Bebeto ) . No Alexi Lalas . No Tony Meola . ( Though there is Jeff Agoos , a defender from the University of Virginia who used to play with Lalas and Meola before he was cut from the 1994 U.S. World Cup team. ) No Brazilian samba drums beating in the stands . No blue-and-yellow painted Swedish faces beaming in the stands . Not much of anything , or anyone , in the stands . Just an announced gathering of 2 # 564 die-hards and / or motorists who happened to be driving by Cal State Fullerton Thursday night and wondered why the lights were_on . &quot; The Legacy Continues , &quot; the ad copy teases , &quot; With The . . . L.A. Salsa. &quot; Well , not quite . The action at Titan Stadium this evening was lively enough ; the Salsa erased a 2-0 deficit with goals in the 87th and 89th minutes to force overtime and a shootout , a running-start version of the World Cup ' s penalty-kicks decider . And on this , the American Professional Soccer League has the World Cup beaten no-hands down . By forcing the kickers to start dribbling from 35 yards out , the goalkeepers actually have a fighting chance in this mano a mano . Ten shots were taken , nine failed and Ft . Lauderdale won the shootout , 1-0 . Neither goalkeeper had to be outfitted with a cigarette and a blindfold . Yet , from an atmosphere aspect -- and this leads directly to the survival aspect -- the post-World Cup APSL looks no different from the pre-World Cup APSL . What happened to Soccer Nation -- the swelling World Cup fever that was supposed to leave the newly addicted panting for a corner-kicks fix once Brazil and Italy split Pasadena ? Where did the house of Hagi go ? The cult of Baggio ? The Valderrama wanna-bes ? Wasn ' t the most popular , most wildly successful World Cup in history supposed to lend a healthy bounce to those lagging APSL attendance totals -- at least until Alan Rothenberg ' s MLS steps_in to fill the gap , if and when ? &quot; The World Cup didn ' t help us , &quot; said Dr. William De Le Pena , owner of the Salsa . &quot; We never expected it to . I think that was a misconception about the World Cup . There was not going_to be any big bonanza . &quot; If the World Cup was going_to help us , it was going_to do_it in two ways -- stimulate sponsors to come_in and help us get us a TV contract . If not , it was going_to be the same as it always was -- with us working from the ground_level up and building patiently for the five or six years. &quot; David Bolton , the Salsa ' s director of communication , thinks the World Cup actually worked against his team in the ticket-count department . &quot; After the World Cup , people are soccered out , &quot; Bolton said . &quot; It ' s tough . We ' ve got the ( indoor soccer ) Splash playing right down the street . We just had 52 World Cup soccer games . Right now , it ' s a saturated market . &quot; The World Cup was great for exposure , but again , you had 52 games in a month . Suppose you went_to the beach every day for a month . After a while you say , ' Give me a break. ' &quot; One other point , as Salsa ticket manager Al Mistri made outside the gates 30 minutes before Thursday ' s game : &quot; Remember , that ' s not gonna be Argentina-Romania out there. &quot; that ' s Problem 1 with post-World Cup Syndrome : Our newly awakened taste buds have been spoiled rotten . For five weeks , the best soccer players on the planet invaded our shores and we surrendered , gladly , blissfully seduced by gravity-bending bicycle kicks and kamikaze headers . Now Stoichkov and Klinsmann are gone and what are we left with ? The Salsa and the Ft . Lauderdale Strikers . How good is the caliber of play in the APSL ? A sampling of expert opinion : &quot; We ' ve played maybe 10 games against Mexican first-division teams , &quot; De La Pena said , &quot; and we won half and lost half . So I ' d put us somewhere in the middle of the Mexican first division. &quot; Bolton pegged the level of play closer to a &quot; competitive second-division squad &quot; in Europe . And Mistri , who also is the head soccer coach at Cal State Fullerton , places the APSL &quot; somewhere between the second and third divisions in Europe . My dad saw a game last year and said it reminded him of a good third-division game in Italy . I think that ' s a good opinion. &quot; But is that good_enough to drag more_than a couple thousand through the turnstiles on a mid-summer weeknight ? &quot; This is not the issue , &quot; Mistri said . &quot; We know what the level of play is . The issue is : What else is going_on ? &quot; &quot; This is the best this country has in outdoor soccer , &quot; De La Pena said . &quot; Paulinho was one of the leading scorers in Brazil three years ago . He led Botafogo to the Brazil championship . We beat the Cameroon national team in a friendly before the World Cup . &quot; The level of play is quite good . And we ' re doing something for soccer here . We ' re keeping it going_in this country . And we ' re going to keep_on playing. &quot; Now , somebody just needs to notice .</TEXT>
