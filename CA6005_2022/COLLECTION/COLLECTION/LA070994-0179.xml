   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / QUARTERFINALS ; SPAIN ' S SCRUFFY SIDE OUT TO CHANGE PAST ; SOCCER : PLAYERS HOPE UNSHAVEN APPROACH WILL HELP THEM BEAT ITALY , END HISTORY OF BIG-GAME FAILURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Think_of the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills . Think_of the last two Super Bowls . Then imagine similar outcomes , in similar games , for the last 60 years . Now , think_of Italy and Spain . And think_of today . On a soccer field surrounded by a stadium filled with blue and white hostility , Spain battles history and reputation in a quarterfinal World Cup soccer game against the favored Italians . This is about more_than earning a date in the semifinals next week in New Jersey . It is about neighbors who have been pecking_at each other from across a pond for more_than 500 years . &quot; Despite all conventional wisdom , there are still some in Spain who feel that Christopher Columbus belongs_to them , &quot; huffed Giancarlo Galavotti , noted Italian journalist . &quot; Those are the same people , I suppose , who think Pinocchio was written by Walt Disney. &quot; When a generation of Spanish soccer players have wished upon a star , this is the victory they have wished for . Italy narrowly leads the series , 8-6 , with eight ties . But in important games other_than in the Olympics , Italy almost always prevails . The Italians set the tone for the rivalry in the first major professional meeting between the countries in 1934 , in the second round of the second World Cup . They not only defeated Spain in overtime , they pounded them so badly that only four Spaniards could take_the_field for the extra session . Flash forward 60 years . In May , Italy bullied the Spaniards again . This time , it was Italy ' s best pro team , AC Milan , whipping Barcelona , 4-0 , in the European Champions ' Cup_final . Sixteen players from that match are in this game ; nine from Spain , seven from Italy . Most Spanish players say they have already forgotten about May . There is no thought of pay-back , they say . The World Cup is far too important for such distractions , they scold . But defensemen Abelardo Fernandez says everyone is fibbing . &quot; This game is special , &quot; said Fernandez , who did not play for Barcelona . &quot; It is a chance for some guys on this team to get revenge . I know I am rooting for them. &quot; Anybody who has ever cheered for an underdog -- yes , all_of you who have wept with football ' s Bills for the last four years -- will be cheering for Spain . In eight previous World Cup appearances , Spain has advanced to the semifinals once , and never beyond . In 12 appearances , Italy has won three championships , and also has finished second and third . But unfortunately for the Spaniards , most of those cheering for them will not be able to get seats at Foxboro Stadium . While Boston-area officials were fuming when Ireland ' s games were sent elsewhere , they were forgetting that their second-largest immigrant population hails from Italy . &quot; Thanks to Italy , people are going crazy about this game , &quot; said E.J. Kahn of the Boston Host Committee . &quot; We could fill three Foxboro Stadiums with the demand for tickets. &quot; Spain Coach Javier Clemente , who said the referees in earlier World Cup games have been affected by the crowds , hopes this will be an exception . &quot; We know we will not be the home team , but that will be OK -- as long as the referee is neutral , &quot; he said . All things being equal , Spain believes it has its best chance to break the spell . &quot; Of course we do not fear the Italians , &quot; said Spanish goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta . &quot; They ' ve had a lot of personal problems . We ' ve been playing well. &quot; Indeed , Italy came within minutes of being eliminated from the tournament by Nigeria before two dramatic goals by Roberto Baggio last week , whereas the Spaniards were flawless in a 3-0 second-round victory over Switzerland . Italy Coach Arrigo Sacchi -- &quot; They once said he was the best in the world , now they say he is the worst in the world , &quot; Clemente said -- is also planning four lineup changes . The most notable involves flashy forward / midfelder Giuseppe Signori , who is expected to be benched in favor of playmaker Antonio Conte . With that move , Sacchi is essentially clearing the lane for Baggio , hoping to take_advantage of his extraordinary ballhandling skills . The Spaniards , meanwhile , have never been more stable . If star midfielder Fernando Hierro ' s groin injury allows him to play , they will have their entire regular team available for the first time in the World Cup . Spain also , finally , has an attitude . The Spaniards admitted Friday that their noticeably unshaven appearances have been part of their strategy . They think their goatees and stubble will bring them luck . They say it worked for their 1992 Olympic champion soccer team in Barcelona . A victory for them here would almost be something out of a book of fairy tales , which is where you can find the name of Carlo Lorenzini , an Italian from Florence . In 1883 , he wrote &quot; The Adventures of Pinocchio. &quot; Not that the Spaniards care about stories involving a puppet swallowed by a whale . Not when , once again , it could happen to them .</TEXT>
