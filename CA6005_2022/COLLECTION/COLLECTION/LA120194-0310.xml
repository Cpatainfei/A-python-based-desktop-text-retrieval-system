   <HEADLINE> BAN ON FORMER S &amp; L PRESIDENT OVERTURNED ; FINANCE : CONDUCT BY HEAD OF DELTA THRIFT IN WESTMINSTER ' IN NO WAY ' JUSTIFIED FEDERAL REGULATORS ' HARSH MEASURES , PANEL RULES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a case rife_with government misconduct , a federal appeals court threw_out an order that had banned a former Westminster savings and loan president from the financial industry for life . The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the conduct of Young Il Kim in managing Delta Savings Bank &quot; in no way &quot; even approached the level of culpability required by federal law to impose such severe sanctions . Kim ' s conduct &quot; certainly does not justify the imposition of such a Draconian measure &quot; as a lifetime ban from the industry , the unanimous three-judge panel wrote in a decision filed Friday but released this week . &quot; I got justice from the court and I ' m very happy , &quot; said Kim , a certified_public_accountant in Los Angeles . &quot; I have been suffering a lot for the past three years . When I was thinking the case over and over , I couldn ' t find anything that I did wrong. &quot; The Office of Thrift Supervision , which ordered the ban , has two weeks to decide whether to seek a rehearing , appeal the decision or accept it , said William Fulwider , an OTS spokesman . The agency seized an apparently healthy Delta Savings Bank three years ago and operated it until last spring , when it sold the deposits and closed the thrift . In seizing Delta , the agency accused Kim and three other directors of &quot; egregious insider abuse , &quot; and two of the directors eventually settled with the government . The OTS brought its case against Kim and another director before an administrative_law judge . But after six days of hearings two years ago , the judge , Arthur L . Shipe , found that the agency had failed to prove its case against them . That marked only the second time that the agency had ever lost a case before an administrative_law judge . Shipe also concluded that an OTS examiner had blackmailed the thrift ' s executives into hiring her as chief operating officer at twice her agency salary and that she then gave the thrift bad advice , which led to the accusations against the executives . The hearing also uncovered evidence that federal examiners were racially biased against Kim and three other Korean-born owners of Delta . A California thrift examiner testified that one of the federal regulators , in a telephone_call to his superior , said he was &quot; banging_up the Korean. &quot; Shipe , however , did not discuss possible bias in his decision . As for insider abuse , Shipe found that the executives had not knowingly done anything wrong and that Delta didn ' t lose money on four loans made to insiders . But in April , 1993 , Acting OTS Director Jonathan Fiechter overruled Shipe and ordered lifetime bans . Kim appealed , but the other director did not . In finding that the OTS simply failed to support its action , the appellate panel sidestepped Shipe ' s highly charged findings . The panel instead concluded that Kim did not know he was violating any banking laws and that the agency couldn ' t prove that he was culpable of serious wrongdoing . &quot; Despite the OTS ' vehement use of such colorful words as ' egregious ' to describe Kim ' s conduct , the materials provided show only that Kim was one of several officers and directors who approved a_few questionable loans . . . and that a_few relatively minor and technical violations of certain banking regulations occurred , &quot; the court said . Kim has filed a lawsuit against the federal_government , accusing it of racial motivations in seizing Delta and targeting him . The case , which is pending , seeks $ 100 million for Delta and $ 20 million for Kim .</TEXT>
