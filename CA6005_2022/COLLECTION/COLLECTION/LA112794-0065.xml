   <HEADLINE> ROBIN ABCARIAN : INCEST : SEXUAL POLITICS OR A MATTER OF THERAPY AND RECOVERY ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A full-page newspaper_ad -- a public_service announcement -- is tacked to the wall next to my desk . Most of the page is taken_up by a photograph of a little_girl who looks strikingly like my own . This little_girl , though , is dead ; she was killed by a drunken driver in 1991 . The picture is there to remind me of several things : of the power of anecdote to illustrate truth , of the intolerance toward a particularly dangerous kind of anti-social behavior , and of the successful politicization of an issue by a group of people -- mothers -- who decided enough was enough . It ' s not OK to drive drunk anymore . And if you get caught , you will be punished . I wonder : Could you say the same about incest ? This question came_up the other day in a conversation with Louise Armstrong , a writer with a biting sense of irony who sometimes refers to herself as the &quot; World ' s First Walking , Talking Incest Victim. &quot; She also has a great sense_of_humor . Obviously , with these credentials , she has to . In 1978 , with great hope , Armstrong published a book called &quot; Kiss Daddy Goodnight , &quot; a compendium of anecdotes about incest , including her own . She quoted -- from letters and interviews -- the stories of women who had been sexually abused as children , adolescents and teen-agers , almost always by their fathers . No one denies that some mothers do terrible things to their kids or that fathers can also rape sons , but Armstrong argues forcefully against making incest a &quot; gender neutral &quot; issue since the overwhelming number of cases involve fathers and daughters . Mainly , she says , incest is a case of fathers acting_out a misguided sense of male privilege , one that to this day plenty of people do not think is such a terrible thing . ( As in , &quot; You have to understand at the time , I thought I was doing my daughter a favor. &quot; As in , &quot; If I would get angry with my wife , I would say hell with her , I ' ve got my daughter. &quot; ) &quot; Kiss Daddy Goodnight &quot; lifted the lid . Or seemed to . But what Armstrong and others who dared speak had hoped would materialize -- a true intolerance of what amounted to the sexual enslavement of children -- never really occurred . What happened instead , Armstrong argues outrageously and persuasively in her new book , &quot; Rocking the Cradle of Sexual Politics : What Happened When Women Said Incest , &quot; was that incest veered away from the political , then went roaring down the therapy / recovery road . It became a mental_health issue instead of a criminal justice / political issue . Incest became about adult women seeking to heal the wounds suffered in childhood . &quot; It is the switch from the feminist to the therapeutic ideology , &quot; Armstrong writes , &quot; with its muzzy-minded focus_on incest survivors as the neurasthenics of the 1990s -- that has framed a lousy and truly destructive . . . experience as an individual disease , rather than as the result of an ingrained social disorder. &quot; Too , she argues , there is no crossover between adults in recovery and children who are suffering from abuse now . It is still very rough going for children who make accusations of incest . Often , they are put into foster care , subjected_to years of court battles and forced therapy , and , as Armstrong documents , may even wind_up in the custody of the very parent they claimed abused them . Mothers have also found themselves involved in legal nightmares , alternately accused of not knowing what was going_on when they should have or of making_up allegations to gain custody in nasty divorce cases . Armstrong cites several studies showing that charges of sexual abuse are not more prevalent in custody and visitation cases than elsewhere . And , according to one law review_article she quotes , &quot; Mothers who make claims of sexual abuse in the context of divorce proceedings often lose custody as a result. &quot; Already murky waters were further muddied when the issue of incest and child sexual abuse became entwined in the public imagination with claims of satanic ritual abuse , the burgeoning controversy over &quot; recovered &quot; memories and blanket assertions by authors of self-help books to the effect that &quot; if you think you were abused , you were. &quot; The issue became so convoluted , the claims so preposterous , Armstrong says , that &quot; ordinary , household &quot; incest retreated as an issue , overtaken by the carnival atmosphere that attended the freaky sideshows , which continue to play_out , ad nauseum , on America ' s TV talk_shows . &quot; People are_sick of it , &quot; she says . &quot; People wish it would go away. &quot; A lot of people are going_to wish Armstrong would go_away -- among them , I should think , the women who have worked hard with therapists and support groups to overcome the effects of sex abuse . Why , for example , can ' t healing and political activism coexist ? Whatever her flaws , though , Armstrong is impossible to dismiss . Amid all_the noise , she argues convincingly that incest is , fundamentally , a way some little_girls are socialized to be women by submitting to the sexual demands of the men they trust most . That is why she calls incest &quot; the cradle of sexual politics , &quot; why she rues its takeover by the mental_health industry . And she has a point : &quot; Certainly , as a result of drunk driving , many , many people are wounded and maimed and many people are grievously bereft . However , no one felt the need to go_on television 40 times a day displaying wounds . Instead , they organized as Mothers Against Drunk Driving and politically acted , and that is what we are talking_about here. &quot; It ' s what we should talk_about anyway . * Robin Abcarian ' s column is published Wednesdays and Sundays .</TEXT>
