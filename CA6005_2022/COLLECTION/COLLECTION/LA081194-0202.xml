   <TEXT> U.S. businesses maintain 28 million electronic mailboxes , and the number is growing . So are sales of portable_computers , which are becoming standard luggage for many business_travelers . But outside the United States , just how easy is it to plug into your electronic world ? Phone wiring and dial tones differ from hotel to hotel and country to country . Hooking_up to a hotel_room phone_line for modem transmission can be extremely frustrating . If you plan ahead , you can get yourself &quot; wired &quot; easily . If you don ' t , you may be up the proverbial creek . Depending_on where you ' re headed , you may need more_than a standard connector . And direct dialing isn ' t always possible , so you may have to do a little juggling after the local operator puts you through . Here are some_other things to consider . * Data jack . Many modern business hotels offer a data jack , normally included as part of the telephone . Here in the States , we have standard modular ( RJ-11 ) jacks , so you can simply unplug the phone and plug_in your modem . But modular jacks differ from country to country , so you may need an adapter . * Adapter . Whether you ' re faced with a data jack or a phone_jack , you ' ll probably need an adapter if you ' re in a foreign country . They ' re easily ordered from firms such_as TeleAdapt . * Extension_cord . There ' s a very good chance that the jack will be located behind the bed somewhere , which means you ' ll be sending e-mail on your hands and knees if you lack extra cord . * Filter . Phone_lines in many European_countries , such_as Germany and Switzerland , have pulse signals that are used to monitor phone usage and calculate the charges . Filters are available to eliminate these pulses , which disrupt modem signals . * Clips and couplers . If you ' re stuck_in a hotel_room with nothing more_than a phone wire that disappears into a hole in the wall , you ' ve got a_couple_of options . If you don ' t mind a little hard-wiring , you can travel with alligator_clips and other tools to literally cut_into the line . Or you can simply buy an acoustic coupler . It ' s a tried-and-true solution , but a heavy one . It eliminates any concerns about phone wiring because you simply connect it to the telephone handset . But it will add about 12 oz . or more to your luggage . Portable computing may_not be for everyone ( yet ) , but the benefits of being able to access the information you need no matter where you are can be_well worth the effort . I send and receive e-mail , connect to my company on Lotus Notes , access CompuServe and fax letters using a Dell notebook_computer with a fax and modem . I even print in my hotel_room , using a little two-pound Citizen notebook printer for letters and overhead transparencies . Total weight : about 10 pounds . Not much for what amounts to a mobile office .</TEXT>
