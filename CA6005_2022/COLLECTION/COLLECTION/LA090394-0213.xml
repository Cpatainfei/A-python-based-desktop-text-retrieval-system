   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : BUENA PARK ; PARKING RESTRICTIONS POLICY GETS INITIAL OK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Residents along narrow streets who want parking restricted to allow two-way traffic will have to collect signatures of 25 % of their neighbors under a new policy tentatively approved by the City_Council . The Traffic and Transportation Commission developed the policy after it received requests last spring for restrictions on San Alto Way . It discovered that most of the residents would rather put_up with impeded traffic flow than lose street parking_spaces , traffic engineer Herb Vargas said . Traffic officials consider a street to be narrow if it has a curb-to-curb width of 28 feet or less . When parking is permitted on both sides , cars going_in opposite directions cannot pass each other . Under the new policy , if some residents want no-parking signs_on one side of the street , they must present petition signatures before the city considers the request . Traffic officials will then conduct a survey and wait until 75 % of neighbors have responded . If at least 67 % of the respondents want the change , the city will consider it a consensus , Vargas said . The council will consider the policy for final approval in early October .
