   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN POLICE MAKE RECORD HEROIN SEIZURE ; TRAFFICKING : AUTHORITIES BREAK UP AN UNUSUAL INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE INVOLVING SMUGGLING TEAMS IN SOUTHEAST_ASIA AND MEXICO TRANSPORTING NARCOTICS INTO CALIFORNIA . NINE PEOPLE ARE ARRESTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mexican federal police have made the largest heroin seizure in Mexican history , breaking_up what authorities described Sunday as an unprecedented Asian-Mexican alliance that shipped Asian heroin into the United States through an unusual route : the border . In a series of raids over the past five days , police seized 52 kilos -- 114.4 pounds -- of pure heroin and arrested nine suspects in this port city about 70 miles south of San Diego , said Jose Arturo Ochoa Palacio , federal attorney_general for the state of Baja California . &quot; This is a major blow to international drug trafficking , &quot; Ochoa said . Prosecutors filed drug trafficking charges Sunday against four Thai nationals and one Laotian , all_of them U.S. residents allegedly involved in smuggling the heroin into California in vehicles . The other suspects were Mexicans , including an employee of the Ensenada post_office who helped sneak the heroin into Mexico from Thailand by mail , police said . The bust apparently reveals a previously unknown and ingenious ring teaming Asian and Mexican smugglers at the border , said Jack Hook , a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in San Diego . &quot; This sounds like it might be a new trafficking route to get Southeast Asian heroin into the United States , &quot; Hook said . &quot; The methodology is new . . . . It ' s a very significant seizure. &quot; Although smuggling of heroin across the porous U.S.-Mexico border is common , the vast majority is manufactured in Mexico , Hook said . Couriers generally smuggle heroin from Southeast_Asia -- the world ' s largest producer of the drug -- into the United States at major coastal cities such_as New York and San Francisco . The Ensenada traffickers allegedly mailed packages containing shampoo , soap and lotions to nonexistent addresses in Thailand , where accomplices in the Thai postal_service concealed heroin in the bath products and sent_back the packages as undeliverable , authorities said . Because the packages were supposedly unopened and also contained Mexican products , the shipments did not have to go_through Mexican customs inspection on their return , Ochoa said . U.S.-bound smugglers picked_up the packages at Ensenada post_office boxes and drove across the border into California . In addition to indicating a potential new drug-smuggling route , the case is another example of the increasing internationalization of criminal organizations . Asian traffickers appear to have followed the lead of Colombian cocaine cartels that have gained access to the lucrative U.S. market by contracting with a longtime smuggling infrastructure in northern Mexico , Hook said . Similarly , a flurry of arrivals around Ensenada last year by ships carrying U.S.-bound illegal immigrants from China resulted from a joint operation by Chinese and Mexican smuggling networks , causing a surge of Chinese immigrants trying to cross the border . The heroin-smuggling ring had been operating in Ensenada since at least September , according to Mexican federal police . Investigators got a break after a postal administrator discovered that two packages mailed back from Thailand contained not only soap but also 17 kilos of heroin . Police discovered several more loads at other post_offices and later arrested the five Southeast Asian suspects . Their statements implicated Alfonso Romero Verdugo , supervisor of the central post_office in Ensenada , and three women suspected of storing the heroin before it was sent north , authorities said . The heroin has a wholesale value of $ 20 million , but would be worth many millions more on the street , authorities said .</TEXT>
