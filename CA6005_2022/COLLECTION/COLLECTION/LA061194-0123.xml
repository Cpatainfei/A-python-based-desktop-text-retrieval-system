   <HEADLINE> CHECKING_OUT ; JAPAN BANK TO SELL RITZ-CARLTON , OTHER ASSETS ; STEEP LOSS SEEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the latest sign that Japanese investors are abandoning the U.S. market nearly as fast as they came here a decade ago , the Tokyo-based bank that owns the Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel in Pasadena is trying to sell the landmark facility at what is expected to be a steep loss . The 383-room complex , rebuilt from the ground up after the original Huntington was declared seismically unsafe in 1985 , is one of 10 California properties and loans that banking giant Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd . hopes to unload in a package sale , sources familiar_with the hotel and the bank said Friday . The other properties include the L ' Auberge Del Mar Resort &amp; Spa near San Diego , condominiums and undeveloped land . The entire portfolio has an estimated book_value of $ 200 million , sources familiar_with the offering said , but it is expected to fetch far less because values have plunged since Dai-Ichi began its U.S. buying and lending spree in the 1980s . &quot; The Japanese seem to be retreating nearly as fast as they came here , &quot; said Linda McKenzie , senior manager of the hotel division of consulting firm Ernst &amp; Young . Japanese investors began a prolonged buying spree in the United States during the mid-1980s , as they sought to reinvest their profits from a prolonged real_estate and stock_market boom in Tokyo . At the time , American real_estate was far less expensive than similar properties in Japan and offered returns that were far greater . But California ' s real_estate market , which once accounted_for more_than half of all Japanese investment in the United States , collapsed in about 1990 as the state slid into a deep recession . At the same time , Japan ' s economy also began to deteriorate . &quot; The Japanese were blindsided by recessions on both sides of the Pacific , &quot; said Jack Rodman , chief of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. ' s hotel consulting operations . Officials at Los Angeles-based Secured Capital Corp. , the financial advisers handling the sale for Dai-Ichi , would not comment Friday . However , real_estate specialists familiar_with the efforts to sell the hotel say Dai-Ichi is hoping to get_about $ 65 million . The bank took_control of the hotel last month , after the U.S. investors who rebuilt the hotel a_few years ago could no longer make the payments on their $ 100-million loan . &quot; This is an unfortunate situation for all parties concerned , &quot; Dai-Ichi Vice_President Julian Harmon said . &quot; At this point , that is all I really have to say. &quot; Still , Dai-Ichi may be lucky if it is able to keep its losses under $ 40 million , some hotel experts say . Southern California ' s hotel market has been hammered -- first by the recession , then by the 1992 riots and most recently by the Northridge earthquake . While hotels in most other parts of the nation are seeing occupancy and rental rates rise , levels have been flat in Los Angeles . &quot; I don ' t see Dai-Ichi getting more_than $ 45 million for the hotel , &quot; one local hotel broker said . &quot; ' If they get 50 cents on a dollar , they ' ll be damn lucky. &quot; Just two months ago , another Japanese lender -- Long Term Credit Bank_of_Japan -- took_control of the swank Hotel Bel-Air in West Los Angeles after its owners could no longer make the loan payments .</TEXT>
