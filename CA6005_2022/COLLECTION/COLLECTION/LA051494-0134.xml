   <HEADLINE> DERIVATIVES ARE BLAMED IN ARCO FUND ' S $ 22-MILLION LOSS ; SECURITIES : THE VOLATILE INVESTMENTS WERE MADE THROUGH AN OSTENSIBLY LOW-RISK MONEY_MARKET FUND . THE COMPANY SEEKS IRS APPROVAL TO REIMBURSE INVESTORS , SAYS IT HAS CHANGED STRATEGY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Officials of Atlantic Richfield Co . confirmed Friday that it was investments in volatile derivative securities by an ostensibly low-risk employee savings plan that resulted in a $ 22-million loss last month when interest_rates soared unexpectedly . Employees -- some of whom saw the value of their savings accounts fall by thousands of dollars as the plan lost 5.3 % of its worth -- expressed varying degrees of shock and disappointment with the performance of the Arco-managed Money_Market Plus Fund . &quot; I felt that it was a money_market account and therefore that the potential risk of losing principal was nil , so I was surprised when it lost money , &quot; said Stephen Oettinger , director of community and public relations for Arco ' s transportation_company in Long_Beach . He said his holdings in the fund amounted to tens of thousands of dollars . Arco said it has liquidated all_of the derivative securities in_question and changed the investment strategy of the money_market fund to avoid such investments in the future . In a letter to employees last week , Arco said it wanted to make_good on the losses of affected employees . &quot; Whether or not we can do that depends_on whether we get the appropriate approvals from the Internal Revenue Service , &quot; Arco spokesman Al Greenstein said Friday , citing potential tax questions . The disclosure that the fund invested in derivatives came a day after The Times reported that the Money_Market Plus Fund , one of several options employees may choose for investment of tax-deferred or retirement savings , had experienced the dramatic April loss . &quot; All of the losses were associated with derivative securities with principal risks , &quot; Greenstein said Friday . He declined to specify the types of securities , saying only that they were not mortgage-backed_securities , which lately have not performed as expected . Greenstein would not say whether Arco will make any personnel changes at Arco Investment Management Co. , whose president is Beverly Hamilton . Hamilton did not return phone_calls Friday . Word of Arco ' s investment strategy comes as regulators and policy-makers are focusing attention on the growing market for derivatives -- often-complex transactions involving the trading of options , futures or combinations of the two that are designed to hedge risks in the movement of interest_rates , commodity prices or other factors . Several major companies in recent weeks have announced losses of millions of dollars from derivatives transactions . However , a spokesman for the Investment_Company Institute in Washington , a mutual_fund industry trade group , said he was unaware of any money-market-type funds that have had trouble because of investments in derivative securities . Typically , money_market funds invest in commercial_paper , government_securities , certificates_of_deposit and other usually liquid and relatively safe securities . Most are managed to maintain a $ 1-per-share principal value . In contrast , &quot; derivative securities as a concept aren ' t necessarily risky , but a lot are structured so that they are quite exposed to the market and can be quite volatile , &quot; said Catherine Voss Sanders , an analyst with Morningstar Mutual_Funds in Chicago . In general , she said , derivatives are the kinds of investments money_market funds should avoid : &quot; Money_markets are just perceived by people . . . as rock-solid instruments . Nobody thinks the principal is even capable of &quot; a loss . Indeed , Arco ' s own documents describe its Money_Market Plus Fund as an investment vehicle designed to &quot; provide security of principal and liquidity , &quot; as well as_to earn rates higher than typical short-term Treasury_bills . Still , plan documents do not prohibit fund managers from investing in derivatives , and fund participants are made aware of the inherent risks of any investments , Greenstein said . Employee savings funds such_as those operated by Arco are regulated by the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration of the U.S. Labor_Department . Area director David Ganz said the agency generally takes enforcement action when a fund manager makes imprudent or impermissible investments or ones that involve a conflict_of_interest . He declined to say whether Arco is the subject of an inquiry . On Friday , phone_calls poured into the office of Arco ' s fund management company . While the promise of being made whole mollified some employees , others still found the loss disturbing . &quot; I don ' t understand why it happened , &quot; said one Arco executive who asked not to be named . With $ 150 # 000 invested in the Money_Market Plus Fund , his loss in April would have added_up to $ 7 # 950 . &quot; It certainly suggests a problem that needs to addressed , &quot; he said . Times staff writers Ralph Vartabedian in Washington and Scot J . Paltrow in New York contributed to this report .</TEXT>
