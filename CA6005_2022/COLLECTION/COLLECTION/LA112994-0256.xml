   <HEADLINE> THE BUSINESS SPACE RACE ; ORBITAL SCIENCES TO ACQUIRE GPS MAKER MAGELLAN SYSTEMS ; ELECTRONICS : THE PRIZE IS A SLICE OF CONSUMER MARKET IN PERSONAL NAVIGATION DEVICES . SWAP IS VALUED AT $ 55 MILLION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orbital Sciences Corp . agreed Monday to acquire Magellan Systems -- a leader in the fast-growing consumer market for satellite_receivers that tell hikers and sportsmen where they are -- in a stock deal valued at $ 55 million . The deal opens potentially lucrative opportunities for San Dimas-based Magellan to start producing and marketing two-way personal pagers that would be part of a global communications_system Orbital is developing for $ 150 million . Magellan now produces hand-held devices , priced as low as $ 400 , that use signals from the Pentagon ' s constellation of Global Positioning System ( GPS ) satellites to determine the user ' s geographic location by longitude and latitude . Magellan this year will produce 100 # 000 of the devices -- a doubling of last year ' s volume and a measure of just how rapidly GPS systems are moving_into the consumer market . According to Magellan President Randy Hoffman , the company ' s acquisition by Orbital , based in Dulles , Va. , will both hasten development of new positioning products and stimulate sales in the market for pager products . Magellan expects its work_force of 150 to expand by at least 15 % annually -- not large by Southern California standards but part of an important trend in small , high-tech companies that dot the region ' s industrial landscape . California firms dominate the market for GPS devices , which are being used increasingly in navigation systems for automobiles , trucks and airlines . Eventually , the devices will be linked to laptop_computers , pagers and mobile telephones . The acquisition has already been approved by Orbital ' s board and does not require a shareholders ' vote , a spokeswoman said . The transaction is expected to be completed next month . About 2.6 million Orbital shares will be issued for Magellan , and a further 400 # 000 shares will be set_aside for stock_options already held by Magellan officers and employees . Orbital ' s stock closed Monday at $ 19.125 a share , off 62.5 cents , in Nasdaq trading . Magellan , founded in 1987 , is a privately held_firm whose stock is largely owned by venture_capitalists . Orbital , which specializes in low-cost space systems , expects to launch the first two satellites for its Orbcomm pager system in January , and to have a complete network of 28 satellites in place within about two years . * With the Magellan deal , Orbital hopes to capture 20 % of the consumer market for pagers that will use its new system , said Orbital Chairman David Thompson . Within the next year Magellan will have to consider expanding its production capacity , though both Hoffman and Thompson said it would be &quot; premature &quot; to say in what state the expansion might occur .</TEXT>
