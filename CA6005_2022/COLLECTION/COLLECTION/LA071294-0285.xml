   <HEADLINE> EXPLOITERS WON ' T GET THIS ACTIVIST ' S MARK ; INDIA ' S KAILASH SATYARTHI HAS DEVISED A LABEL CERTIFYING THAT A CARPET WAS MADE WITHOUT CHILD LABOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was 14 years ago that Kailash Satyarthi and his followers began staging daring raids on Indian workplaces to free children who were being treated little better than slaves . To date , the tall , bearded activist from central India estimates , he has helped retrieve 25 # 000 children , including 7 # 000 from the carpet industry , and reunited them with their parents . It ' s not enough , he says . Often , muses the chairman of the South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude ( SACCS ) , he would go_to a station to catch the train home after raiding a carpet manufacturing_plant in Uttar Pradesh state , where children are forced to work no less than 12 and as_many as 20 hours a day . Feeling pleased with himself for having freed 10 children , Satyarthi would then watch , aghast , as a labor broker arrived in Varanasi or Mirzapur on an inbound train with 50 new youngsters to satisfy the industry ' s endless hunger for labor . &quot; We are freeing children at the cost of our lives , but the number of child laborers keeps rising , &quot; Satyarthi says . When he speaks_of the risks involved , he is not speaking idly . Two of his comrades have been killed -- one_shot to death , the other beaten so badly he succumbed to his injuries . Employers , or their agents , were to blame , he says . The solution to India ' s child labor problems , the coalition ' s founder has concluded , lies not in India but in the United States and other foreign countries that buy 98 % of India ' s carpets . In Germany , he noticed during a 1990 visit , tomatoes are labeled to alert the consumer that they are environment-friendly and healthy . &quot; I said , ' If you are so concerned about your health and environment , why not show the same concern for children ? ' &quot; By the end of this year , Satyarthi expects the result of his lobbying , negotiating and coalition-building involving Indian and foreign grass-roots organizations and charities to be available to consumers in Europe and North_America : a label , called the &quot; rugmark , &quot; certifying that a carpet was made without child labor . * All other carpets from India and neighboring Nepal and Pakistan should be boycotted , he says . &quot; If you put your legs on a beautiful Indian carpet , you are crushing the backbone of a child , &quot; he insists . More_than 50 Indian carpet makers have agreed to the rugmark scheme , Satyarthi said in a recent interview at his group ' s New Delhi headquarters . The cooperating companies have provided a list of their weaving units so that inspectors from his group can verify that no children are employed on their premises . that ' s necessary , he says with a wry smile , because the industry can ' t be trusted to police itself . &quot; When the All India Carpet Manufacturers Assn . talked_about putting_on the label , I was 100 % sure that not only would it be a fake label but that they would build a new factory to make_it where children would be employed , &quot; he says . The rugmark , Satyarthi says , will be awarded by an independent body that includes representatives of carpet manufacturers and exporters ; non-governmental social_service organizations ; U.N. agencies such_as UNICEF and the International_Labor_Organization , and the Indo-German Export Promotion Project . &quot; Now it is going_to function , &quot; Satyarthi said with confidence of his brainchild . &quot; We are sure that the Americans and Europeans will find labeled carpets in their shops by Christmas. &quot; Others involved in the program said Satyarthi ' s timetable might be optimistic , but they agreed it is only a matter of time before the rugmark reaches stores in the West . SACCS , which comprises about four dozen organizations in South Asia , estimates that 80 million young children are working in India , Nepal , Pakistan and Bangladesh . As children and families have migrated to the cities over the past 15 years or so , they have met the growing employment needs of the region ' s export industries . &quot; The governments need dollars at any cost . So they give these industries all possible facilities , legally and sometimes illegally , &quot; he says . * Satyarthi has heard the arguments in favor of child labor , including those made by free-market advocates , and thinks they are all moonshine . &quot; The relationship isn ' t capitalist , one of employee to employer . It ' s feudal , &quot; he says . &quot; The child is like a slave. &quot; A decade ago , when the Indian carpet industry was exporting $ 100 million worth of production , a commissioner of the Supreme Court of India estimated it was employing 75 # 000 to 100 # 000 children . Now exports have tripled and so has the number of child weavers , to an estimated 350 # 000 . The increase has come_in spite of a 1986 law , the Child Labor Regulation and Prohibition Act , that bans employment of children in dangerous or health-endangering industries , including carpet manufacturing . Similar legislation to protect children under age 14 exists in the other countries of the region . &quot; Not a single violator of the 1986 act has been punished , &quot; Satyarthi says . &quot; Not a single person has been imprisoned in India or Pakistan under such laws. &quot; One reason for the lack of official and public concern in India , he believes , is that most of the bonded children are from the loathed untouchable caste or from equally low-status tribes . In 1983 , Satyarthi made his first raid on a carpet factory . Thirty-two children ages 6 to 12 from the village of Chichori in Bihar , India ' s poorest state , had been procured by middlemen who offered a bit of money to their parents , then whisked the youngsters away . When the children rebelled at having to work long hours for little or no pay , they were branded with red-hot irons or hung upside down from trees . * Such raids , he says , may be the only way to guarantee the youngsters a_few years of normal childhood . &quot; If a child has become a carpet weaver , the master never lets him go unless he falls sick , &quot; Satyarthi says . Usually , he says , after seven to eight years of intensive weaving work , the children ' s eyesight becomes impaired , and they have inhaled so_much woolen fluff that their lungs are damaged . Not being able to count_on his own group ' s courageous if piecemeal efforts -- and seeing government as too often a crony of the carpet makers -- Satyarthi is now banking on Western consumers to help release hundreds of thousands of Indian children from bondage by making child-woven carpets impossible to sell . &quot; If people can be so concerned about fur , &quot; he asks , &quot; why not about children ? &quot;</TEXT>
