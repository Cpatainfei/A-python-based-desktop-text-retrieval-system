   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; ' MY FATHER ' A SORDID REMAKE OF A SEX COMEDY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The arrival of &quot; My Father , the Hero &quot; ( citywide ) begs the question : Why does Hollywood persist_in remaking French sex comedies ? Most of the originals -- including &quot; The Tall Blonde Man With One Black Shoe &quot; and &quot; Les Fugitifs , &quot; remade as &quot; Three Fugitives &quot; -- weren ' t all that sexy or funny to begin with . And with the exception of &quot; Three Men and a Little Lady , &quot; none of these remakes , which also include &quot; The Toy , &quot; &quot; Blame It on Rio , &quot; &quot; Partners &quot; and &quot; Buddy Buddy , &quot; has been a smash hit . Or sexy . Or funny . &quot; My Father , the Hero , &quot; remade from a French comedy virtually unseen in this country , at least has Gerard Depardieu in the cast , which gives it a pedigree . Depardieu , who has appeared in every French film for the past 20 years , give or take a_few , makes his third appearance in a Hollywood movie . ( The first two were &quot; Green_Card &quot; and &quot; 1492 : Conquest of Paradise. &quot; ) It ' s enjoyable watching Depardieu wrap his mouth around the_English language ; he seems to enjoy it as much as we do . Less enjoyable is watching Depardieu ( or , in long_shot , his stunt double ) water skiing and wallowing through treacherous shoals . ( A friend said he reminded her of Shamu. ) Depardieu may be fun to watch but he ' s not enough reason to see the movie . The plot is one of those ooo-la-la jobs that was probably pretty smarmy even in the original ( except the_French can get_away with these things better than we can ) . It ' s about what happens when Andre ( Depardieu ) , an errant , divorced dad , takes his 14-year-old daughter , Nicole ( Katherine Heigl ) , to a Bahamas resort for a quality-time vacation . * When Nicole falls_for a hunky local , Ben ( Dalton James ) , she concocts a jealousy-making scheme to rope him in : She pretends Andre is actually her lover and an international spy . ( The father-daughter relationship is supposed to be a ruse to get_around the illegalities. ) The vacationers all think Andre is a child_molester and give him scorching stares ; Nicole , meanwhile , with her princessy , sweet-young-thing wiles , enjoys teasing the resort ' s male staff and playing_up her role as kept woman ( or child-woman ) . Does this sound like the comic premise we ' ve all been waiting for ? The screenwriters , Francis Veber and Charlie Peters , have worked_on many of the previous France-to-Hollywood adaptations . ( Peters contributed to the script for &quot; Blame It on Rio , &quot; which also dabbled_in incest yuks. ) Along with director Steve Miner , they try to muffle the essential sleaziness of the plot while at_the_same_time playing_up to it . Nicole is ogled not only by the local guys but by the camera . There ' s something sordid about the way the filmmakers offer_up this -- shall we say questionable -- entertainment as a refreshment .
