   <HEADLINE> CHIAPAS REBELS OVERRUN MEXICO LEADER ' S AGENDA ; REVOLT : BUREAUCRATIC GAFFES , RURAL AREA ' S SPECIAL PROBLEMS FRUSTRATE EFFORTS TO SETTLE THE DISPUTE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A month after rebels from the Zapatista National Liberation Army took_control of four county_seats in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas , their cause continues to dominate the national agenda . The uprising in the impoverished Mexican state near the Guatemalan border has overshadowed President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s weekend trip to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland . It has become an issue in the national presidential campaign , provoking speculation that the party that has dominated Mexico for more_than six decades may be forced to change candidates in response . And , in a disturbing sign for Salinas himself , the rebellion has shown itself to be immune to the stunning , snap solutions that have served him so well for five years . The president -- who proved his strength days after taking_office by arresting the powerful head of the oil workers ' union in a shootout -- has gotten bogged down in efforts to settle the Chiapas dispute because of bureaucratic gaffes and for reasons that can only be seen and understood here , far from the capital . Consider , for example , the experiences of peasant farmer Valentin Gomez and his neighbors . He says the guerrilla occupation is the closest that his edge-of-the-jungle village of adobe huts has come_to peace in his 23 years . Constant disputes with private ranchers over land and cattle have kept the semi-communal farm , called an ejido , in an uproar for decades . Gomez said the army always seemed to take the side of the ranchers . When the rebels swept into this area , they installed a roadblock just outside of town -- a blockade that Gomez and his neighbors now see as protection from the army . &quot; In our communities , we can say that peace has not existed , &quot; Gomez said . &quot; We have been_quiet because the army has kept us that way . We cannot sue a rancher because his cattle trample our corn . We cannot organize a demonstration because people are afraid of being beaten_up . This is not peace. &quot; Gomez and his guerrilla-sympathizing neighbors are not eager for normalcy to return if that means the army and government will regain control . Their resistance has contributed to the deadlock that has plagued Salinas and his government negotiators , who have come under increasing pressure from refugees , ranchers and international public_opinion to settle the Chiapas crisis . Earlier , Salinas appeared to move decisively , firing his Interior minister and naming Manuel Camacho Solis , the former Mexico_City mayor and his government ' s top conciliator , as his peacemaker . Salinas and Camacho agreed to accept help from Samuel Ruiz , an Indian rights activist and bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas who has often clashed with the government over its treatment of descendants of the Maya Empire who make_up one-third of Chiapas ' population . Ruiz opened a line to the Zapatistas . And there has been some progress toward a settlement . On Friday , for example , the government freed 38 of 70 prisoners suspected of participating in the rebellion , and it ordered an investigation into the deaths of five guerrillas the army denies having executed . Still , a promised government announcement of a peace proposal was canceled last week . And while Camacho said Saturday that both sides have agreed to an agenda for face-to-face talks , no date has been set . Meantime , other government initiatives have produced embarrassments as they have played into longstanding feuds in Chiapas . There was , for instance , the radio campaign to get Chiapans to turn_in suspected guerrillas . Such efforts instead have turned_into witch hunts in which neighbors have sought to settle old scores with neighbors , said Ellen Lutz , a representative of Americas Watch . This is what apparently happened in Oxchuc , 12 miles east of San Cristobal . Army troops arrived there on Jan . 15 , allegedly to protect residents who had been clamoring for aid since Jan . 2 , when Zapatistas retreating from San Cristobal entered their county_seat , also called Oxchuc , burning government buildings . But to the chagrin of many in the area , by the afternoon after the army arrived , local officials were combing villages and arresting people . In the village of Tuxaquilja , they reportedly pulled one man from his house , boxed his ears and threw him in the back of a pickup , without explanation . On the ride nine miles down a mountain to the county_seat , the man said he was kicked and beaten . He was turned_over to soldiers , who tied his hands behind his back and took him in a troop truck to a nearby army_base , along with 16 other men from the township . At the army_base , the man said he was beaten and threatened with execution unless he confessed to being a Zapatista . &quot; Of course , I confessed , even though I had never heard of the Zapatistas until they entered Oxchuc , &quot; he said . The Defense Ministry has denied that the army has tortured prisoners . The 17 Oxchuc prisoners eventually were taken_to Cerro Hueco prison in the state_capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez ; there they received food for the first time since their arrest , the man said . On Jan . 20 , the men were released . All were members of the civic group Tres Nudos , &quot; Three Knots , &quot; the Spanish translation of Oxchuc and a reference_to the Mayan belief that a rope tied_in three places is strong and well-balanced . For two years , the 24 Oxchuc villages that formed Tres Nudos have received direct government loans and aid to start a corn mill and tortilla factory , as well as_to finance corn , bean and potato crops . Group members argue that municipal authorities were angry at them because they had bypassed the usual aid channels -- meaning some officials lost a chance to get_at the government money . Local officials refused to talk with reporters . Similar incidents have been reported in communities where Zapatistas invaded , then left . The government ' s National Human_Rights Commission reported last week that charges have been dropped against 58 of the 131 people arrested in connection with the uprising . As the guerrillas have fled to the jungle , they have sent_out a steady stream of refugees , worsening the chaos confronting Salinas . Manuel de la Cruz was returning to Agua Dulce , the family ranch a_few miles from San Miguel in guerrilla-held territory . He was_full of determination to defend the family homestead after a three-day meeting organized by independent peasant groups in San Cristobal . But when he stopped in to see his sister , who lives_in a village along the route , he found that his father , Alejandro , the 82-year-old patriarch , had brought three generations of the family out of Zapatista territory . Mounted on 10 horses with grandchildren trailing on foot , the De la Cruz family abandoned the ranch Alejandro had bought with his savings as a day_laborer 20 years earlier . Rebels stopped the caravan at roadblocks along the route and tried to force them to turn_back . &quot; I told them that their pistols did not scare me , &quot; Alejandro said . &quot; ' I ' m old . If you want to kill me , kill me . If not , get_out of my way. ' &quot; As the uncertain cease-fire in the region drags_on , more people are making the same decision , filling refugee camps in towns outside the rebel areas . They are straining the state ' s limited resources at_the_same_time the fighting is destroying its never-robust economy . The coffee harvest is already lost ; the cattle appear to be next . When guerrillas swooped down on the 470-acre ranch he and his father own , killing and eating a steer , Jose Francisco Lopez decided not to go_back . Lopez , manager of the Ocosingo Cattlemen ' s Assn. , which ships 25 # 000 head of cattle a year to the United States for fattening , said 46 local ranches have been sacked since the year began . Local newspapers reported that 150 ranchers have left their spreads in or near rebel territory . &quot; There are constant confrontations between comrades and ranchers , &quot; Gomez , the peasant farmer , said . &quot; These are problems that have gone_on for 40 or 50 years. &quot; And even when peasant groups , such_as the Rural Collective Interest Assn. , have won some victories , he said , they have often proven hollow . Two years ago , for example , at the collective ' s insistence , the government expropriated a 6 # 000-acre ranch called El Rosario , dividing the land among six ejidos , including San Miguel . Peasants soon realized the land was suitable only for pasture and applied for loans to buy cattle so they could begin ranching . They were told that for environmental reasons , there is an embargo on ranching so close to the Lacandon rain_forest . Some people have tried planting corn on the land , but yields are low , Gomez said . Ironically , some observers believe the peace process has gotten mired in large part because , in the past , the government was so slow to respond to Chiapas peasants ' peaceful petitions for land , schools and medical service . As one parish priest noted , &quot; The conflict would never have occurred at all if the government had not taken so_long to find solutions that people became desperate. &quot;</TEXT>
