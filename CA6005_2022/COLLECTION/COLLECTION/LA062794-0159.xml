   <HEADLINE> MEMBERS PRAISE ' INTENSE ' SERVICE OF SMALLER CLUBS ; CONEJO VALLEY : THOSE IN SOROPTIMISTS AND ZONTA CREDIT STRENGTH TO THE UNIQUENESS OF THEIR CAUSES , AND THE VIGOR AND CREATIVITY WITH WHICH THEY APPROACH THEIR WORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They may lack the numbers of the Rotary_Club and the presence of the Optimists , but Conejo Valley ' s two women ' s service_clubs are by no means invisible . In the first six months of this year , club_members have run a literacy fair , a high_school essay contest , a Special Kids Day and a road rally . They have bought newspapers for school students . They have donated makeup to a battered women ' s shelter . They have raised money for women scientists , college_students , libraries , earthquake relief , senior centers , medical equipment and swimming_pools . And , as members of the two clubs will tell you , that ' s not the half of it . &quot; Our plate is so full it ' s overflowing , &quot; said Martha Desch , a member of the Zonta International chapter . &quot; There are days when I ask myself , ' What have I gotten_into ? ' &quot; For all_the meetings they attend , the fund-raisers they throw and the projects they undertake , the 28 members of Zonta and the slightly larger Soroptimist Club chapter see themselves as service_clubs outside the spotlight . In the shadow of such powerhouses as the Rotary_Club and the Optimists , these small clubs fight an ongoing battle for membership and attention . And they credit their continuing strength to the uniqueness of their causes , and the vigor and creativity with which they approach their work . &quot; We go_about this in a much more intense way , I think , than the other clubs , &quot; said Betsy Bourne , president-elect of the Soroptimists . &quot; Every single member is in it up_to her ears . If they weren ' t , we would n ' t survive. &quot; The clubs , both founded in the early part of this century as all-women versions of the Rotary_Club , share a number of traditions with their larger service counterpart . Their meetings are strikingly similar to Rotary -- jovial affairs with speakers and fines levied on members who have missed meetings or events . And there is a hint of networking . Each club looks_for members who are professionals from diverse backgrounds . Zonta counts among its ranks a printer , banker , car-parts importer and office manager . The Soroptimists have an optometrist , nurse , bookkeeper and stockbroker . But while members of both clubs acknowledge the networking possibilities , many members said they avoid the practice . &quot; There ' s pressure to network , but that ' s not our main focus at all , &quot; Soroptimist President Sandra Vawter said . &quot; Our club is focused more on helping other women. &quot; Vawter said members of Soroptimist believe that the gains that women made in the latter part of this century have been eroding . &quot; We see women being pushed_out of work by computers and women struggling over the conflicts between work and parenthood , &quot; Vawter said . &quot; And we want to get_in there and help. &quot; Both Soroptimist and Zonta members contribute heavily to causes for women -- last year , Zonta ' s national organization gave 35 scholarships worth $ 6 # 000 each for women studying fields of science . The local Soroptimist club raised $ 10 # 000 for battered women . And it runs a program in which members visit a Ventura County shelter for women who have been abused . They take the women shopping , give them makeup and clothes , and treat them to dinner . &quot; We know that we aren ' t solving all_of these women ' s problems , &quot; Vawter said . &quot; But you ' d be amazed at what a difference it can make to look good . You give these women a different image of themselves and you ' ve given them hope . And that does make a difference. &quot; The charity work , Zonta President Mary Lou Miller said , is more important to the members than making contacts in the business world . But putting business interests on the back burner has cost both groups , she said . It is why , when two members of Zonta were accepted into Rotary last year , their employers refused to support their Zonta membership . &quot; We were devastated , &quot; Desch said . &quot; I ' m sure they didn ' t have any choice . I ' m sure their companies told them that ' s where the power is , that ' s where the clout is . It was Rotary or nothing. &quot; For Southern California Edison , a company that frequently sponsors employee memberships in_service clubs , the decision is clear . &quot; If we ' re involved in a service_club , it ' s usually going_to be Rotary , &quot; said John Katch , a regional spokesman for Edison . &quot; Rotary has a track record in most communities , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re in there for business reasons -- it ' s not just for social_activities . It ' s not a written policy , but in most places , Rotary is the club we ' ll support because they ' ve got what we ' re looking for. &quot; And Rotary does not apologize for that , Thousand Oaks Rotary President Hugo Roche said . &quot; I think every group does their own thing , and both ( of the women ' s groups ) are really important , &quot; Roche said . &quot; But Rotary does seem to be more prominent and , when companies come_out to underwrite a membership , I ' m sure that ' s something they ' re looking for. &quot; For Zonta and Soroptimist , clubs with memberships dwarfed by Rotary , the difficulty in attracting large companies to underwrite the expense of membership has hurt . &quot; We ' ve lost two members and I ' m sure they won ' t be the last , &quot; Desch said . &quot; And for us , every member is critical. &quot; Each new member makes the task of holding events or raising money more manageable , Miller said . &quot; With the economy , and all_the other clubs around trying to raise money , that ' s hard enough , &quot; Miller said . &quot; But it certainly makes_it harder for us because of our smaller membership . We just keep plugging_away at it. &quot; Finding people to help organize events is also a chore . Each year , Zonta plans Special Kids Day -- a trip for 450 disabled children to the Conejo Valley Days amusement_park . This past year , just one day before the event , the 28 Zonta members had recruited 250 volunteers -- not nearly enough to support an event that pairs each child with an adult . Desperate , the women continued making calls well into the night . &quot; I ' m not exactly sure what happened , but somehow we pulled it off , &quot; Desch said . &quot; Every year , people have so many commitments to so many different clubs , it makes_it really tough . We just hope for the best. &quot; Bourne said club_members are able to endure the stress of such events as Special Kids Day because of the camaraderie between the women . &quot; I know it might sound sexist , but when I came_to this club , I was really looking_for a women ' s group , &quot; Bourne said . &quot; There is something different in the way we work together . It ' s just very gratifying to be involved in something where everyone is_on equal footing. &quot; That , Vawter said , is why the groups are optimistic about their futures . &quot; We don ' t have to worry so_much about how large or small we are or what ' s going_on with the other clubs , &quot; Vawter said , &quot; because we ' re making the most of what we ' ve got. &quot;</TEXT>
