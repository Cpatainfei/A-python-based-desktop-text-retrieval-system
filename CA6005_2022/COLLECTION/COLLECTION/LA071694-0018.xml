   <HEADLINE> EU PICKS CHIEF ; CRITICS CALL LOW-PROFILE CHOICE A BLOW TO INTEGRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Leaders of the 12-member European Union ended an embarrassing impasse Friday by selecting an uninspiring minor political figure as the next president of the union ' s powerful executive commission . Their choice of Luxembourg Prime_Minister Jacques Santer , 57 , who has made almost no impact during his decade as leader of the EU ' s smallest member country , was greeted with a mixture of dismay and disbelief by advocates of stronger European integration . If confirmed as expected next week by the European Parliament in Strasbourg , France , Santer will succeed Jacques Delors , whose second five-year term expires at the end of this year . Some feared that Santer ' s appointment would only encourage a challenge to commission power that has become increasingly visible from member states during the past year . &quot; It ' s the confirmation of our worst fears that Bonn , Paris and London want to cut_back the power of the commission , &quot; said Stanley Crossick , chairman of the Brussels-based Belmont European Policy Center . &quot; that ' s what ' s most disturbing. &quot; Fernand Hermann , a Belgian member of the European Parliament from Santer ' s own Christian Democratic Party , added , &quot; He ' s not the candidate of our dreams. &quot; Reaction , which came earlier in the week as Santer ' s name first surfaced in speculative press reports , was so negative that those involved in the decision coupled the nomination with a plea to reserve judgment . &quot; I hope he ' ll be given a fair chance of showing what he ' s capable of doing , &quot; said German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , who introduced Santer at a news_conference here following the summit_meeting . &quot; We need someone who can bring reasonable compromise . Jacques Santer is the right man at the right moment. &quot; At the same news_conference , Santer echoed Kohl ' s plea , saying : &quot; You have to judge me once I actually do something , not before . I ' m fully committed to building the future of Europe. &quot; Santer was a participant in several key events in recent years , including the 1985 summit that committed the 12 nations to the single market and the historic 1991 meeting in the Dutch city of Maastricht , where the leaders pledged themselves to the goal of full economic and political union . But he appears to have contributed little that anyone can recall to these occasions , nor does he seem to have made a mark in any other field beyond the borders of his tiny Grand_Duchy . The reaction to Santer ' s appointment is in many ways a reflection of Delors ' own stature and the high expectations he has created for the job . During his tenure , Delors breathed new life into the flagging EU , launching such revolutionary ideas as a European monetary union and transforming the member nations into a border-free , single , unified market for goods and services -- a task largely completed at the end of 1992 . In the process , he built the office of EU commission president into one of the most powerful in Europe . But it apparently was too powerful for the union ' s 12 national_leaders , most of whom seemed more intent_on taming the commission ' s challenge to their own power than in furthering the cause of European integration . Indeed , Santer ' s main qualification for the job seemed to be that he is unlikely either to pose a threat to those who chose him or to add significantly to the executive commission ' s influence . As such , his was the classic choice by &quot; a smoke-filled room. &quot; The result is expected to further fuel the controversy about the lack of democratic involvement in filling the job some have come_to call &quot; president of Europe. &quot; Because Germany now holds the rotating six-month EU presidency , the choice of Santer effectively was made by Kohl , who quickly sounded_out the other 11 heads of government before Friday ' s emergency summit . That meeting came exactly three weeks after the 12 failed to agree on a candidate at a routine summit on the Greek island of Corfu . There , British Prime_Minister John Major vetoed Belgian Prime_Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene , who was heavily promoted by France and Germany . Other , potentially more powerful , candidates -- including Dutch Prime_Minister Ruud Lubbers , Spanish Prime_Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the EU ' s energetic trade commissioner , Leon Brittan -- also proved unacceptable . Santer ' s appointment is especially significant because his five-year tenure spans a crucial period for the union . It faces a de_facto constitutional convention in 1996 when the Maastricht Treaty on political and economic union comes under review . New initiatives to resolve Western Europe ' s severe unemployment problem and the task of integrating the former Communist democracies of Central and Eastern Europe into the union are also considered vital for the region ' s future . The commission wields considerable power , largely because it enjoys a monopoly in proposing EU-level legislation and directives -- a function it carries_out with the aid of 15 # 000 civil_servants .
