   <HEADLINE> PEOPLE ONCE KNOWN AS LEPERS STILL FACE STIGMAS THAT HAVE LINGERED SINCE BIBLICAL TIMES . BUT A COUNTY-USC CLINIC PROVIDES A PLACE FOR THEM TO SHOW THAT THEIR ILLNESS IS . . . ; ONLY SKIN DEEP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There was a time when Abraham Almorade would have been quarantined by the U.S._government , exiled to a life that excluded all except those who shared his mysterious and feared condition . Today , he need only visit a clinic for medication and kinship , but his burden is by no means slight . Almorade , 65 , of Los Angeles , has Hansen ' s disease -- known since biblical times as leprosy -- a difficult-to-transmit bacterial ailment that attacks body tissue and is controlled by medication . It has slowly eroded his body since he was diagnosed in the 1950s , covering his skin with sores and leaving his nose deformed as the cartilage collapsed . Sitting in an examination room recently at Los Angeles County-USC Medical_Center , where a clinic has served Hansen ' s patients since 1973 , Almorade discussed his condition . Hansen ' s disease has robbed his hands of sensation , making_it difficult to feel routine cuts , burns and scrapes . Without feeling , such accidents have become major health risks and over the years have reduced Almorade ' s fingers to stumps . As a precaution , he no longer performs tasks that might injure him , such_as cooking or cutting . &quot; I have to protect my hands , &quot; said Almorade , a retired soldier from the Philippines . &quot; They were always numb with no sense at all and I didn ' t want to hurt them . I don ' t cook anymore . I just eat. &quot; He is one of about 500 Hansen ' s disease patients who visit the Los Angeles clinic regularly . Roughly 500 additional patients are served by clinics in San Diego and San Francisco . &quot; Leprosy is still very common around the world , &quot; said Dr. John Leedon , head of infectious_diseases at County-USC . The World_Health_Organization estimated that in 1991 there were more_than 5.5 million cases worldwide , down from more_than 10 million in the 1980s . A 1992 article in the journal Clinical Dermatology , however , said there were between 10 million and 15 million patients worldwide , most in Africa and India , and about 6 # 000 in the United States , primarily in Texas and Louisiana . &quot; The figures differ depending_on how you count them , &quot; said Dr. John Trautman of the National Hansen ' s Disease Center in Carville , La . &quot; The World_Health_Organization doesn ' t count patients who have completed drug treatment . In the U.S. , we ( do ) . &quot; Scientists believe the disease is transmitted only by prolonged , close contact with someone who is infected , although its precise route into the body is not known . It causes a &quot; significant disability &quot; in about 30 % of those infected , said Dr. Thomas Rea , a dermatologist who heads the clinic at County-USC . Still , most of the clinic ' s patients function normally day to day , often wearing long sleeves and explaining away their sores as bug bites and other minor maladies . They are all ages , although most are adults . Some have jobs , spouses and children . And all visit the clinic periodically to work with doctors at controlling their symptoms . There is little to distinguish the Hansen ' s disease clinic from others at County-USC . A chair-lined hallway serves as a waiting room outside a large check-in desk . Patients wait quietly before being escorted to small , plain treatment rooms . Despite the chaos often found at a large public hospital , patients are treated individually . &quot; It ' s complex , because there ' s a whole spectrum of problems , &quot; said Dr. Jim Kunkel . &quot; This clinic has been built into something that can take_care of all types of people . ( The disease ) affects different people in different ways , so you have to take people individually. &quot; The clinic has become an important part of life for patients like Jesus Villa , 52 , of Los Angeles . &quot; It ' s like a haven , &quot; he said . &quot; The doctors work with me to find_out what is best . It ' s good , because I ' ll be taking medicine the rest of my life . I am also able to talk_about the disease with other patients . I ' m not embarrassed. &quot; Rea said the disease and its treatment have changed quite a bit over the years , but that the image of Hansen ' s disease patients has changed little . &quot; There ' s quite a stigma associated with the disease , &quot; he said . &quot; The idea of the patient being outcast , unclean and the lowest of the low , those things are reinforced in the Bible . Despite the efforts of the informed , cultural values seem to change very , very slowly. &quot; After the Bible , which mentions leprosy more_than two_dozen times -- usually as a punishment or other negative reference -- the 1959 epic film &quot; Ben-Hur &quot; may be the most famous cultural reference_to the disease . The biblical stigma remains so great that the emotionally loaded terms leper and leprosy are no longer used . In 13th-Century France , more_than 2 # 000 facilities were built to house sufferers rounded_up by the government during an epidemic . As late as the 1930s , those with the disease in China were sometimes burned . And in the United States , laws existed in the early 1900s that allowed authorities to arrest patients . Most were sent to so-called &quot; leper colonies , &quot; the most famous of which was established on the Hawaiian island of Molokai in the 19th Century . Most of the colonies have been closed . The National Hansen ' s Disease Center , located for almost a century in Carville , is believed to be the only residential treatment center in the United States . &quot; The disease carries with it quite an emotional charge , &quot; he said . &quot; It varies a lot from culture to culture . There is a difference between ethnic_groups and within ethnic groups. &quot; Though many of the clinic ' s patients emigrated from countries that still discriminate against Hansen ' s disease patients , many who visit the clinic say life in the United States is not perfect , either . Villa , an unemployed immigrant from Mexico , said the disease not only impaired his ability to work -- he is arthritic and losing feeling in his legs -- but also affected his marriage . He and his wife recently separated . &quot; It could be the disease , &quot; he said through a translator . &quot; There are other problems , of course , but I couldn ' t say ( the breakup ) wasn ' t related to my disease . I felt embarrassed with my family and friends because , in the past , it was a disease that people have feared . I tended to keep to myself and away from the family. &quot; Villa now lives alone , collecting a small Social_Security pension . He must cook and clean for himself , endangering the limbs that lack sensation . &quot; I sometimes feel_like I ' m deteriorating , &quot; he said . &quot; I feel_like my skin is thin and I ' m constantly burning myself . When I pick_up something hot , it doesn ' t feel hot . When I take a shower , it doesn ' t feel hot or cold . &quot; I wear loose clothing so it doesn ' t bother my skin . Now I have to focus_on wearing comfortable shoes because it ' s important . I cannot drive , so I don ' t socialize. &quot; Formerly a factory_worker , Villa said he is embarrassed because he can no longer work . He anticipates having to employ someone to take_care of him soon . While Villa is uncertain about his future , other patients have had an easier time . Many report little or no trouble with the disease beyond the obvious . &quot; I used to go_to the beach and swim , &quot; said Frederico Amador , 43 , of Los Angeles . &quot; that ' s something I can ' t do anymore . I ' m embarrassed . I ' m not_able to wear clothes that reveal my arms , so I ' m not as comfortable . Initially , I felt depressed . But as time goes_on , it gets better. &quot;</TEXT>
