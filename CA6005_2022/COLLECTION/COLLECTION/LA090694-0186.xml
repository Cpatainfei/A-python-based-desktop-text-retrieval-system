   <HEADLINE> MERGER MAY LEAD TO CUTBACKS IN COMMERCIAL VENTURES ; CONVERSION : EXPERTS PREDICT THAT LOCKHEED MARTIN WILL DUMP BUSINESS_LINES THAT AREN ' T SOLID MONEY-MAKERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lockheed Corp . and Martin Marietta say their planned merger will accelerate their expansion into commercial markets . But analysts are skeptical . They say the merger aims chiefly to create a leaner , meaner defense contracting giant . Beyond that , experts figure , the consolidation is a chance for both firms to give their commercial ventures a long , hard look -- and dump the ones that aren ' t solid money-makers with roots in defense . Besides defense , &quot; everything will be_on the table now , &quot; said Rohit Shukla , executive_director of the nonprofit Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance . Calabasas-based Lockheed and Martin Marietta , based in Bethesda , Md. , announced plans last weekto combine forces , creating an aerospace powerhouse with $ 23 billion in annual sales . Both say their commitment to diversify away from defense remains_firm in the aftermath of the merger , the largest defense consolidation in industry history . And the companies ' chief_executives predicted that the new Lockheed Martin eventually would grow , after the unspecified job cuts that will come_with the merger . But job applicants shouldn ' t hold their breath . Analysts paint_a_picture of a smaller , tighter Lockheed Martin , pared_down to the areas in which it has clear superiority -- be those civilian or military . Commercial markets expected to be emphasized by the new company include space systems , information services and environmental technology . As for other non-defense business_lines , &quot; They will shed like you would n ' t believe , &quot; predicted Shukla . Ventures such_as CalComp , Lockheed ' s Anaheim-based computer_graphics concern , will be among the first dumped by the new defense giant , he said . Profits at CalComp , which employs 1 # 600 worldwide , have been disappointing , and Lockheed tried unsuccessfully to sell the firm a_few years ago . CalComp officials last week said it was premature to discuss the unit ' s future in a merged Lockheed Martin . Access Graphics , headquartered in Boulder , Colo. , is another computer-related Lockheed venture that ' s likely to be a square peg in the new company , said Lior Bregman , an analyst with the investment banking firm Oppenheimer &amp; Co . in New York . &quot; Graphics and computer_peripherals never fit , and it still doesn ' t fit , &quot; he said . Even profitable companies such_as Burbank-based Lockheed Air_Terminal , the airport management company , may eventually be sold , said Shukla . In recent years , the company has expanded from airport management to airport development , and exploring projects in far-flung spots such_as Turkey and Siberia . But despite its modest success , the company &quot; does not contribute anything to their core business , &quot; Shukla said . Lockheed and Martin Marietta have made strides in recent years to diversify away from making weapons and military aircraft . Lockheed is involved in everything from collecting highway tolls to developing commercial launch vehicles . U.S. defense sales shrank_from 70 % of Lockheed ' s total sales in 1991 to 64 % last year . Martin Marietta ' s sales outside U.S. defense accounted_for more_than 30 % of sales last year , up from 25 % five years ago , said Charles P . Manor , a Martin Marietta spokesman . Martin Marietta ' s diversification efforts range from a joint partnership with a firm that dissolves pollutants in molten metal , to providing computer graphic technology for video_games to Tokyo-based Sega Enterprises . Both companies were_on a path toward expanding non-defense to 50 % of sales , and that evolution will continue apace with the merger , Manor said . &quot; Everyone has focused . . . on the creation of a defense juggernaut , &quot; he said . &quot; But we did this not just to have a critical mass with ( the Department_of_Defense ) , but to compete in global markets. &quot; Some analysts question , though , whether the huge new Lockheed Martin will be any more competitive outside defense . Being big &quot; makes_it harder for them to be flexible , adaptable and operate as a commercially successful enterprise , &quot; said Dan Flaming , president of the Economic Roundtable , a nonprofit public policy think_tank in Los Angeles . Lockheed ' s more successful commercial offspring include Lockheed Information Management Services Co . in Teaneck , N.J. The company provides systems for processing parking_tickets and toll-road collections for local_governments . It also has developed so-called &quot; intelligent highways , &quot; which will use sensors to assess fees to commuters as they drive by toll booths . But the company ' s most celebrated defense-conversion efforts are at Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co . Inc. , based in Sunnyvale . The unit is rooted in the development of ballistic_missile systems . But it has also worked in space exploration for NASA , developing support_systems and tests for the Hubble Space Telescope , and designing pieces of NASA ' s proposed manned space_station . Nowadays , the missiles and space division is using its technological base to expand into satellite images for map-making , commercial satellite launch vehicles and advanced materials for aircraft . It has also secured a $ 700-million contract with Motorola Satellite Communications Division to develop parts of a constellation of orbiting communications satellites called Iridium . For its part , Martin Marietta is an old_hand in space technology . The company makes both the Titan and Atlas rocket systems . &quot; Space is the common_denominator , &quot; said Bregman , the Oppenheimer analyst . &quot; All ( Lockheed ' s ) space-related efforts fit very well with Martin Marietta ' s. &quot; The same goes_for environmental services , he said . Lockheed ' s ventures in that sector are &quot; a perfect fit &quot; with Martin Marietta ' s , he said . Besides its agreement with Molten Metal Technology Inc. of Waltham , Mass. , Martin Marietta also oversees toxic-waste cleanup at federal_Department of Energy facilities . Until recently , Lockheed Environmental Systems and Technologies Co. , based in Houston , was considered an unimpressive business . Earlier this summer it burst into prominence by landing a $ 5-billion , five-year federal_Department of Energy contract to manage the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory . Together the companies are poised to take_advantage of growing concern over pollution problems overseas , said Shukla of the Regional Technology Alliance . &quot; There are huge markets out there , &quot; he said . Lockheed Martin will also move rapidly toward commercialization of its military business , Shukla said . &quot; They won ' t design from the ground up for a specific customer any more . They will design one product and market it in many ways , &quot; he said . Military business is likely to be subjected_to the same ruthless culling as Lockheed Martin ' s civilian operations , added Jim Schwendinger , Los Angeles-based director of national consulting for the accounting_firm Deloitte and Touche . &quot; They will decide what they have superiority in , and what they come second in , and they will spin those off , &quot; he said . For now , though , both these behemoths are likely to spend some time digesting . &quot; There ' s a limit to how much an organization can absorb and assimilate at one time , &quot; Schwendinger said . &quot; It ' s going_to take them a couple years at least. &quot;</TEXT>
