   <HEADLINE> DELAY IN NOTIFYING CORONER HURT SIMPSON CASE PROBE ; INVESTIGATION : EFFORTS TO PINPOINT TIME OF DEATHS WERE HAMPERED , TOUGH LAPD POLICY WAS VIOLATED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles police_detectives disregarded state law and their own departmental policy when they waited hours to summon the county coroner to examine the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman , documents and interviews show . The delay -- one in a string of late notifications that has frustrated the coroner ' s office in recent years -- hampered efforts to pinpoint a precise time of death and now looms as a scientific problem in the case against O.J. Simpson , forensic experts say . Documents show police were warned two years ago that state law required them to notify the coroner immediately in cases of murder and certain other deaths , and Police_Chief Willie L . Williams responded by issuing a tough new policy to that effect . But records show that detectives did not follow those guidelines in the hectic hours after the bodies were discovered at the Bundy Drive murder scene June 13 . In another development , Simpson lawyer Johnnie L . Cochran Jr . said Friday night that &quot; the majority view on the defense_team is that Simpson should testify &quot; and added that his client &quot; wants to testify &quot; at his trial . However , he said , &quot; A final_decision has not been made because we have not had to make that decision. &quot; Cochran said he expected &quot; a healthy discussion &quot; on the issue among the defense_lawyers . He predicted that differing views would be voiced and that the group would try to forge a consensus and if necessary take a vote . The Times was unable to reach Simpson ' s other lead lawyer , Robert L . Shapiro , on Friday . Earlier in the day , police spokesman Lt . John Dunkin said he would not discuss why detectives waited to notify the coroner ' s office about the bodies . &quot; Those are issues that are going_to be examined in detail during the course of the upcoming court trial and it ' s not appropriate for us to discuss them outside that setting , &quot; he said . But a police source close to the investigation added : &quot; ( The delay ) is not unusual , that ' s all I can say. &quot; California law makes_it a misdemeanor for a physician , funeral_director &quot; or other person &quot; not to immediately notify the coroner about violent and suspicious deaths , including suicides and murders . The coroner ' s office has legal responsibility for determining the manner and time of death . In the overwhelming majority of murder cases , however , homicide detectives say it is either impractical or unnecessary to call a coroner ' s investigator to the scene immediately . It is often obvious how and when a person was killed , they say , and their first duty is to preserve the crime scene for the collection of evidence . Having another official present might disturb such things as fingerprints and bloodstains , detectives said , and the fact that the coroner arrives later is of little consequence . But in the grisly slayings of Nicole Simpson and Goldman -- where the time of death is a crucial element -- experts now warn that the 10-hour delay before a coroner ' s investigator was allowed to test the bodies is a major investigatory gaffe . The delay , forensic pathologists say , effectively prevented the coroner from estimating a time for the attack reliable enough for the prosecution to contradict Simpson ' s alibi that he was at his Brentwood home at the time of the attack , waiting for a ride to the airport at 11 p.m. Tests performed at the death scene include taking the temperature of the victim ' s liver , observing the onset of rigor_mortis and testing for how quickly blood has settled into the body ' s extremities . Indeed , Los Angeles Deputy Medical_Examiner Irwin L . Golden testified at Simpson ' s preliminary hearing in July that the murders were committed &quot; somewhere between 9 ( p.m. ) and midnight , &quot; and he admitted under cross-examination that the standard measurements upon which he based his decision would have been more accurate if taken sooner . &quot; The farther away you go from the time of death , the more inaccurate you become , &quot; said Werner U . Spitz , former Wayne County , Mich. , medical_examiner and author of a widely used forensic pathology textbook . &quot; The big problem is that the coroner ' s office should have been informed immediately because the coroner at the scene would have the ability to take the temperature and make other observations . . . to have a much better foundation for the time of death , &quot; Spitz said . A more precise time of death also could have been to Simpson ' s advantage if it indicated the murders took_place after 11 p.m. , when a limousine driver testified that the football great got_into his car for a ride to the airport . Still , the three-hour period specified by Golden also gives defense_attorneys room to raise reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors . Simpson has pleaded not_guilty . Jury selection in the case is expected to begin Sept . 26 . Dean Gilmour , captain of the Los Angeles County coroner ' s investigations division , said Friday that in most cases , police and other emergency services have been prompt in giving notification about deaths -- but exceptions are noteworthy and disturbing to coroner ' s investigators . He said the Police_Department and coroner ' s office held a high-level meeting July 26 to try to resolve the long-running notification problem underscored by the Simpson case . Gilmour said that several years ago he received a call_on the midnight shift about a man who had died of a heart_attack on a city bus at 3rd and Ord streets that afternoon . &quot; Here , a gentleman had been_on the back of the bus for eight hours before we were notified , &quot; he said . In 1992 , coroner ' s officials wrote two letters to LAPD Chief Williams reminding him of state law and urging him to make_sure the department gave prompt notification . Craig R . Harvey , chief of the coroner ' s operations bureau , wrote July 24 , 1992 , to complain that police waited seven hours before calling about an off-duty California Highway Patrol officer who was gunned_down by an angry motorist near the Los Angeles Convention Center the night before . And in September , 1992 , former coroner ' s department Director Ilona Lewis wrote to Williams about how police handled a Metro Rail Blue Line accident in which a driver and his passenger were killed at a crossing gate in South Los Angeles . Lewis said that police never called , although two LAPD traffic divisions were notified , and that the coroner ' s office decided to send_out investigators after hearing radio reports about the traffic backup . Williams changed department policy when he issued a special order Nov . 17 , 1993 , requiring that &quot; the investigating officer at the scene of a death . . . shall make notification immediately upon determining that the death falls within the purview of the coroner ' s office . If the coroner is not immediately needed at the scene , the investigating officer shall advise the coroner of an approximate time when the coroner ' s deputy can respond . &quot; When circumstances indicate that the investigation of the death requires the expertise of a specialized investigator ( e.g. , homicide detective , traffic collision investigator ) , immediate notification to the coroner shall be made by the concerned specialized investigator who responds to the scene of the incident , &quot; the order says . Despite Williams ' order , grand_jury testimony , court transcripts and coroner ' s records show that police waited hours before calling the coroner in the Simpson case . Led by Nicole Simpson ' s dog , a neighbor discovered the bodies about 12:10 a.m. , and Gilmour said the coroner ' s log showed that both Nicole Simpson and Goldman were pronounced dead by other authorities at 12:45 a.m. LAPD Homicide Detective Mark Fuhrman testified in the preliminary hearing that his supervisor called him at_home about 1:05 a.m. and that he first arrived_at Nicole Simpson ' s condominium at 2:10 a.m. &quot; When it became apparent who was involved in this , a determination was made that this was one that would be handled by the Robbery Homicide Division , the elite corps &quot; of homicide detectives , Lt . Dunkin said . According to grand_jury testimony , robbery homicide Detectives Philip Lewis Vannatter and Thomas Lange received telephone_calls at_home about 3 a.m. Vannatter arrived_at the murder scene shortly after 4 a.m. and Lange , his partner , got there about 4:30 a.m. The detectives testified that they stayed_at Nicole Simpson ' s condominium until about 5 a.m. , when they went_to Simpson ' s nearby house on North Rockingham Drive . It wasn ' t until 6:55 a.m. that police officially notified the coroner ' s office , Gilmour said . &quot; They said , ' Wait , we ' ll call you back when we ' re ready , ' &quot; he said . Gilmour said police called again at 8:10 a.m. and coroner ' s Investigator Claudine Ratcliffe was sent to the murder scene . She arrived_at 9:05 a.m. but was asked to wait until shortly after 10 a.m. before she could approach the bodies and begin collecting evidence and performing the standard tests . Ratcliffe took the bodies to the coroner ' s office Downtown about 12:20 p.m. , Gilmour said . Golden testified that he relied_on Ratcliffe ' s field observations and the contents of the victims ' stomachs to place the deaths within a three-hour &quot; range. &quot; In all , records show , it was more_than 10 hours between the time the bodies were discovered and the time Ratcliffe conducted those tests , including a liver temperature test . Elapsed time from when the first LAPD detective arrived_at the scene : about eight hours . Time from when robbery-homicide detectives Vannatter and Lange appeared : about six hours . &quot; It was a long_time , &quot; Gilmour said . By comparison , he said , LAPD gave late notification in only four other homicides during June and the time_lag ranged between three and five hours .</TEXT>
