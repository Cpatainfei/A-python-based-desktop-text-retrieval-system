   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO ACT IN 10 ABORTION CLINIC ATTACKS ; INDICTMENTS : CHARGES ARE EXPECTED AGAINST AN EXTREMIST IN PRISON FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER . AUTHORITIES HOPE ACTION WILL LEAD TO NAMES OF OTHERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Signaling a mounting federal commitment to crack_down on anti-abortion violence , the government will soon seek charges in connection with 10 separate attacks on abortion clinics in Northern California and elsewhere in the West , The Times has learned . The central target of the expected charges is Rachelle Shannon , an anti-abortion extremist in prison for the attempted murder of an abortion doctor , according to government and non-government sources . The indictments , under_consideration by federal grand_juries in Sacramento and Portland , Ore. , could come early this week . The indictments involve a series of fire-bombings and acid attacks on clinics in California , Oregon , Nevada and Idaho , sources familiar_with the cases said . Although the government is not expected to seek indictments against any others at this time , sources said investigators hope the charges against Shannon will pressure her to reveal the names of other extremists . Shannon is serving nearly 11 years in Kansas State_Prison for the 1993 attempted murder of Dr. George Tiller in Wichita . She was convicted March 25 of shooting Tiller as he drove_out of his clinic on Aug . 19 , 1993 , wounding him in both arms . She also was convicted of aggravated assault for pointing a gun at a clinic employee and was found in contempt_of_court for refusing to say where she obtained the weapon . At her sentencing , Shannon compared herself to Jesus and insisted she had done no wrong . The incident is one of three shootings of abortion doctors that have occurred in the last two years , leaving two physicians and one clinic escort dead . Attacks at clinics across the nation prompted the passage of tough federal legislation against anti-abortion violence , and federal law_enforcement agencies have stepped_up efforts to investigate the possibility of conspiracies behind the violence . The expected charges will deal with three arson attacks on clinics in Sacramento and Redding and an incident at a Chico clinic , where a foul-smelling acid was used to disrupt the facility . All occurred in 1992 . Attacks on clinics in Reno , Eugene , Ore. , and Idaho are also involved . Shannon is a longtime anti-abortion activist and 38-year-old mother of two from Grants Pass , Ore . She has talked extensively in prison with agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms and has acknowledged certain incriminating information , sources familiar_with the investigation said . One source noted that Shannon ' s apparent cooperation came_after she was confronted with some of the evidence ATF agents had gathered . But the source said agents at first were concerned she could have been admitting to attacks for which she had not been responsible . &quot; You ' ve heard of a boaster ? &quot; the source asked . &quot; There ' s also the technique of copping_out to some things you didn ' t really do &quot; to try to protect those truly responsible . As a result , investigators conducted an extensive review of Shannon ' s statements , the source said . The investigation of Shannon ' s participation in clinic attacks was prompted largely by a treasure_trove of evidence obtained after her arrest in the Tiller shooting , and by her statements and letters she wrote from jail about her activities . After her arrest , authorities searched her home and dug_up materials in her back yard . Investigators obtained diaries and paraphernalia , including bomb-making materials and manuals , that seemed to provide a road map to her secret past . Her diaries also revealed close ties to other extremists previously convicted of clinic attacks . Just weeks before she shot Tiller , for example , Shannon had traveled_to Ohio to visit two anti-abortion leaders being held_in different prisons on charges stemming from clinic bombings and vandalism . Both leaders openly advocate anti-abortion violence , and Shannon was an editor of a newsletter for one of their organizations . Her diary entries describe her prison meetings with them as &quot; awesome. &quot; An account of Shannon ' s life , which has emerged from court testimony , interviews and government sources , shows that by the time she shot the doctor , she had gradually let her life become consumed by the anti-abortion cause . Shannon ' s life in the anti-abortion movement began in 1988 , when she began attending meetings of the Southern Oregon chapter of Right_to_Life . But she quickly found Right_to_Life ' s emphasis on peaceful picketing and political lobbying stultifying . She said she was frustrated by its refusal to take direct_action against abortion . Shannon soon moved_on to Operation Rescue , which used the tactics of nonviolent civil_disobedience and street theater to attract attention . But ultimately her views moved beyond even Operation Rescue ' s nonviolent tactics , and she drifted into splinter_groups that believed that violence aimed at stopping abortion was justified . ATF agents have for months considered Shannon the prime suspect in the April , 1992 , fire at the Catalina Medical_Center in Ashland , Ore . Last January , Shannon wrote to Chico police to confess to vandalism at a clinic there in 1992 . And , in a letter she sent to a Wichita newspaper in February , Shannon acknowledged she was involved in a string of clinic arsons across the nation . &quot; I figure at least six different states , several places in some states , &quot; Shannon wrote . &quot; that ' s what I get for traveling hither and yon , doing this , that , and the other thing. &quot;</TEXT>
