SO HOW ARE THEY COPING WITH THEIR SEXUALITY ? THE REALITY IS THAT WHILE MANY TEENS ARE PRUDENT IN THEIR BEHAVIOR , OTHERS CASUALLY TAKE CHANCES THAT COULD CHANGE THEIR LIVES FOREVER. ; DESPITE RISKS , TEENS SHUN RESPONSIBILITY AND PROTECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A little latex never hurt anybody . Yet , despite the consequences , many teens still refuse to use condoms or any form of contraceptive when engaging in sexual_intercourse . In a recent survey of 587 students at Troy High_School in Fullerton , 68 % of those students who are sexually active said they use protection on an irregular basis or neglect to use it altogether . When Troy senior Steve ( students are identified by first_name only to protect their identities ) engaged in unsafe sex , he allowed his emotions to override his good judgment . &quot; When I would go_to ( my girlfriend ' s ) house , I would n ' t take any condoms because we were coming closer and closer to having_sex , and I thought that if I wasn ' t prepared I would n ' t have_sex . That wasn ' t the case , though , and we ended_up having_sex and I just wasn ' t prepared , &quot; Steve said . &quot; I ' ve been educated all my life , and I know what the consequences are . I think it was a stupid risk . I ' m ashamed to say it , but if I had the same situation to live_over under the same circumstances , I ' d probably do the same thing over again. &quot; Unfortunately for teens such_as Steve who don ' t take precautions , there are consequences . More_than 2 million teens across the United States are infected annually with STDs , according to the Centers_for_Disease_Control in Atlanta . Locally , in 1992 there were 1 # 199 new cases of sexually transmitted diseases among those age 10 to 19 , according to the County of Orange Health_Care Agency . Currently , the most feared sexually transmitted disease is AIDS . In Orange County , as of Dec . 31 , 1993 , seven males and two females age 13 to 19 have been diagnosed with AIDS . Both of the females and four of the males have died , according to the Health_Care Agency . Another serious repercussion is teen pregnancy . In Orange County in 1992 , 51 # 623 babies were born -- 4 # 781 of those were to teen mothers . Back in 1990 , there were 377 pregnancies reported among 7 # 336 young_women age 15 to 19 in the Fullerton Joint Union High_School District . Troy senior Susan became part of those statistics and learned firsthand the effects of unsafe sex when she got pregnant her freshman year . &quot; Sometimes my boyfriend and I would use a condom ; sometimes we didn ' t , and I know it was one of the times we didn ' t that I got pregnant . My mom always told me that if I ever got intimate_with my boyfriend to come_to her and she would give me condoms . But when you ' re having_sex , it ' s not like you ' re thinking about it . Until you skip a period , you don ' t think_about what could happen to you , &quot; Susan said . &quot; When I got pregnant it had nothing to do with ( inadequate ) information . I ' d heard it from my mom and from school . It ' s in the back of everyone ' s mind , I know it is , that little voice saying , ' I know I shouldn ' t be doing this , ' but they all think ' it can ' t happen to me. ' You can only harp on someone so_long before they ' ll tune you out. &quot; Modifying sexual practices will require sex educators to do more_than inform students about the consequences of unsafe sex , Troy health instructor Bill Morris said . &quot; I think nationwide , health educators are trying to come_up with a curriculum that would be_best suited to help in the area of behavioral change . By now we should have seen a significant drop_in the number of unwanted pregnancies and STDs in our society , but that ' s not the case , &quot; Morris said . Brian McMichael , community educator for Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties , said there are , basically , four components that determine how responsibly a person will behave sexually , and knowledge is just one of them . &quot; First , you need to know the facts : ' How do I catch an STD ; how don ' t I ? ' The other component is skill . There are two kinds of skills , technical skills , like how to roll_down a condom without rupturing it or spilling the contents . You also need to have social skills to bring_up the issue ( of using protection ) , &quot; McMichael said . &quot; Self-esteem is another one : If you don ' t have good self-esteem , you won ' t stand your ground when you ' re confronting your partner . The last is community , and not just the PTA , but peer support . What do we call guys who don ' t have_sex very much ? What do we call a woman ? The truth is we insult them . We don ' t pat ourselves on the back for taking_care of ourselves , &quot; McMichael said . Society , ultimately , has the biggest influence on teen-agers ' conduct , and education alone cannot reverse its effects , McMichael said . &quot; How do you combat the hours and hours of sex , with all_the allure and power as it ' s portrayed on TV , with an average of 555 minutes of sex education ? &quot;</TEXT>
