   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : LAGUNA BEACH ; ARTWORK HONORS LEE , GOLD MEDALIST DIVER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As artist Robert B . Krantz on Friday unveiled a three-foot-tall bronze artwork honoring Dr. Sammy Lee , the first Korean American to win a gold medal in the Olympics , Krantz offered an anecdote from Lee ' s coaching days . Known as a great but insistent diving teacher , Lee trained two-time Olympic gold-medal winners Bob Webster and Greg Louganis . He won a gold medal and a bronze medal in the 1948 Olympics in London and a gold in the 1952 Helsinki Games . But Krantz ' story at a Rotary_Club luncheon at the Hotel Laguna had to do with a young diver . &quot; The diver was not getting_off the board as high as Lee wanted her to , &quot; Krantz said . &quot; And , Lee had this stick , a long pointer . No whip . He held it up , about three feet above his head , saying to her , ' I want you to get that high off the board. ' She looked_at him and said , ' I can ' t go_up that high. ' But Lee was insistent . He looked_at her and firmly said , ' I didn ' t ask_for your opinion. ' Well , the diver cleared the mark. &quot; As Lee was introduced to the Rotarians , the diminutive , five-foot-tall coach told them : &quot; Krantz didn ' t tell you I stood on a box when I held that stick up. &quot; Lee ' s self-deprecating style of humor always seems to catch audiences off_guard . It belies a man whose accomplishments include becoming a U.S. Army major , a physician , Olympic diver , and diving for the U.S. Olympic diving team . Now retired as an ear surgeon and living_in Huntington Harbour , the 73-year-old dynamo has not lost anything growing older . He still , on occasion , helps train a group of high school-level and younger divers at the Mission Viejo Recreation Center ' s Olympic diving complex . Lee doesn ' t sway from debate on the center ' s future which is in_question due_to funding . &quot; It ' s a shame if we lose that training facility because it has produced more gold medal Olympic winners in swimming and diving than anywhere else in the United States , &quot; Lee said . Krantz said it was this energy , Lee ' s motivation for trying to get the maximum from everyone he trained , condensed and put_in visual form in the bronze . The artwork , commissioned by the Laguna Beach-based Kalos Kagathos Foundation , is a three-piece representational bronze that has a world globe at its base , with two hands emanating and supporting two statuesque divers of both sexes . Bruce Hopping , Kalos foundation chairman , said the artwork will be known as the Sammy Lee Award , which is selected by the World Diving Coaches Assn. , every four years as the most prestigious award in competitive diving . The artwork will be displayed at the International Swimming Hall_of_Fame Museum at Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , Hopping said.DAVID REYES</TEXT>
