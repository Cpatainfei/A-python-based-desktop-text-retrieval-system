   <HEADLINE> EARTHWATCH : DEFENSE_CONTRACTORS LOOK TO ENVIRONMENT ; THEY ARE SEEKING CLEANUP JOBS IN THE WAKE OF CUTBACKS IN MILITARY SPENDING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last week , I shared an excellent meal with a group of recyclers . These were not my normal brand of recyclers -- you know , the ones who dine on organically grown veggies in a retrofitted adobe . No , these were defense_contractors , eating mahi mahi at a Radisson Suites hotel in Oxnard . And what they were recycling was themselves ; they were there to find_out how to become environmentalists . The event was a meeting of the Channel Islands chapter of the National Contract Managers Assn . This is a group of local business folk who administer contracts that , until recently , flowed in torrents to American industry from the Department_of_Defense . Companies employ them to function as go-betweens between the defense supplier and the armed_services involved . &quot; We ' re high-level buyers , &quot; explained my table-mate for the evening , Marilyn Erwin of Mission Research Corp . The topic of the evening was how to get work from industries not being affected by the shrinking defense budget . And that , according to the evening ' s speaker , might mean cozying up_to the environmental industry . Yes , there is such an industry . Big companies , like the oil and chemical firms , also big government_agencies like the EPA and the Energy_Department have been putting_out contracts for cleanups and retrofitting . And some trained and qualified person has to be there to &quot; monitor the performance , &quot; as Erwin put it . Are you and I , fellow Sierra Clubbers , going_to go_on daily patrol with our Geiger_counters and bean counters to see that the repair work gets done and at the price promised in the cleanup contract ? Well , maybe , but I doubt it . There may be a big difference between building an air_base and cleaning_up after three generations of air-warriors have been refueling there , but at this dinner , I discovered that the same people who built America ' s war machine and supplied it for 50 years are gathering_in hotel_rooms around the country to learn how they can , in_effect , clean_up after the kids . &quot; Environmental Contracting_in the ' 90s : Opportunities and Pitfalls &quot; was the announced topic for my night out_in Oxnard . The speaker , F . J . ( Jack ) Schroeder , is a leading light in this new trade . According to the printed program , Schroeder was originally an engineer on Air_Force design and construction jobs in 20 countries . He scared listeners -- including this one -- half to death with a recitation about the degradation of our local soil , air and water . But the audience was there to find_out about new business opportunities , not to open a vein , so he thoughtfully switched to a list of businesses where members of the audience might offer their services as environmental contract supervisors . Those in the crowd , asserted Schroeder , have been involved in keeping track of lots of hazardous materials ( such_as bombs and rocket_fuel ) , as well as piles of war surplus materials ( such_as planes , parts , paints and parachutes ) . He suggested that they now look_to companies that handle toxic materials ( such_as paint and petroleum manufacturers ) , firms that transport waste_products , and non-defense , public agencies that are stuck_with messes ( such_as abandoned mines and toxic_waste_dumps ) but have some money for cleaning them up . In a pamphlet on the dinner_table , which described the National Contract Management Assn. , I got a glimpse of the future -- sort of . &quot; In the near future , almost everyone in the field will contend with environmental issues , &quot; was a quote attributed to the group ' s national president , Mary Mayer . I once saw a movie about the launderette business . One character challenged another about the profitability of such an enterprise . The proprietor retorted proudly : &quot; Oh , there ' s money in muck. &quot; Details * FYI : Business people , technicians and lawyers interested in a seminar entitled &quot; Commercial Environmental and International Contracting : An Evolving Focus , &quot; scheduled from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. March 4 at the Harbortown Marina Resort in Ventura , should call Deanna Carney at 987-8831 , Ext . 219 , for information .</TEXT>
