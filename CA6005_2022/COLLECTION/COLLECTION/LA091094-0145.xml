   <HEADLINE> RELIGION / JOHN DART ; JEWISH LETTER REACHES ACCORD ON SEX</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Unmarried Jewish men and women with loving , committed relationships &quot; embody a measure of morality &quot; in their sexual lives if they follow ethical norms expected of married_couples , says a nearly completed pastoral letter for the Conservative branch of Judaism -- a document that reaches a consensus on sex that has eluded many Christian denominations . Sex that is not coerced , fidelity to one ' s partner , attention to birth_control and healthy practices are among the considerations incumbent upon heterosexual couples who , for a variety of reasons , have decided they won ' t or can ' t live_up_to the Jewish ideal of married love , according to the pastoral letter . &quot; Most Jews assume that since Judaism wants people to restrict sex to marriage that you might as well forget about Jewish tradition saying anything else about sexual_relations , &quot; said Rabbi Elliot Dorff , the author , who has nursed the document through seven drafts in an effort to reach consensus among rabbis in the 1.5-million-member Conservative wing of Judaism . &quot; These people assume that it ' s all or nothing , &quot; said Dorff , recently named the equivalent of dean of the faculty at the University of Judaism in the Sepulveda Pass in Los Angeles . &quot; My point is that nothing in Judaism is all or nothing. &quot; * It will be a rare document for a mainstream U . S . religious body , saying something officially -- other_than condemnation -- about the widespread phenomenon of unmarried couples who live together but have not necessarily dropped their religious ties . The Presbyterian_Church ( U.S.A. ) , Evangelical Lutheran_Church in America , United Methodist_Church and Episcopal Church have been trying in recent years to fashion broad &quot; human sexuality &quot; statements at the national level , but without much success . The biggest impasses have arisen over whether church bodies can give qualified blessing to committed relationships of gay and lesbian members or admit them to the ranks of clergy . But even where solely heterosexual issues are concerned , any expression in early drafts of limited sympathy for divorced , widowed or other single adults in mature sexual_relationships quickly runs_into opponents who cite church tradition that requires &quot; fidelity within the covenant of marriage , &quot; to cite a phrase used at Presbyterian national meetings . Last month , the bishops of the Episcopal Church adopted a &quot; study document , &quot; downgraded from a more authoritative &quot; pastoral letter , &quot; on human sexuality issues that attempted to address the concerns of single adults while reiterating the church position that human sexuality reaches its &quot; fullest potential &quot; in the union between husband and wife . Again , the most difficult disputes were over homosexual relations . The Conservative rabbis were able to avoid that impasse by referring unresolved issues -- such_as blessing same-sex unions and ordaining gays and lesbians -- to the Jewish Law Committee of the Rabbinical Assembly , the international_organization of Conservative rabbis . The document deals with gay and lesbian issues only in cases where Conservative_Judaism has reached a consensus -- for instance , that they should be welcome in synagogues and that homosexuality should be_better understood . Dorff said he has sent the latest version of &quot; A Jewish Pastoral Letter on Intimate Relations &quot; to officers of the Rabbinical Assembly and to the sponsoring Commission on Human Sexuality for any last-minute , minor changes . The final version will probably go_to the printer in late October , he said . In an accompanying letter , Dorff told his colleagues that he changed what was probably the most controversial sentence in the sixth draft &quot; in which I said that non-marital sex can partake_in varying degrees of holiness , &quot; depending_on the degree that it incorporates high standards articulated elsewhere in the document . Dorff changed &quot; holiness &quot; to &quot; morality. &quot; The letter does not break new ground in Jewish law , nor does_it set policy , cautioned Rabbi Joel Rembaum of Los Angeles ' Temple Beth Am in an interview . But Rembaum said it takes what many rabbis already tell individuals in private counseling sessions and places that stance in a public document that might be used for broader educational purposes . &quot; The reality is that vast numbers of ( unmarried ) people are living together , &quot; said Rembaum , who is current president of the Southern California Board of Rabbis . &quot; We feel there is an obligation to say that any kind of relationship between men and women be conducted along the highest standards of ethical conduct , &quot; he said . Since many couples live together before getting_married , they may have already established how they relate to one another and to their Jewish heritage , he said . &quot; You can ' t expect them to say , ' Now we change because we ' re married , ' &quot; Rembaum said . * The pastoral letter repeatedly asserts that couples should restrain from sexual_intercourse until marriage for the benefits of lasting companionship , for the obligation and blessings of raising children , and for the education of children . Sexual relations that are incestuous , adulterous , casual or promiscuous were condemned by the rabbis , but they acknowledged there are others with an ongoing , loving relationship who engage in non-marital sex for a variety of reasons . Among those reasons , the document said , may be &quot; because a suitable mate has not yet been , or may never be , found ; . . . marital commitment ( is ) premature , often for emotional , educational , economic or professional reasons ; or because experience with divorce or the death of a partner has necessitated a gradual healing process , including experience of several transitional relationships prior to remarriage. &quot; The pastoral letter also advised that in light of the AIDS crisis , any new sexual contact should call_for full disclosure of the partner ' s sexual history , HIV testing , and careful and consistent use of condoms until the risk of infection has been ruled_out . If the pastoral letter is somewhat liberal on non-marital sex , the document nevertheless took some relatively conservative stances stemming from worries about the numerical decline of Jews through intermarriage and smaller families . Critical of the trend by couples to postpone marriage and childbearing until they are in their 30s , the rabbis ' document said , &quot; Jews should consider it reasonable to marry and to begin to have children in their 20s. &quot; The document also urges that Jewish teen-agers date fellow Jews exclusively . &quot; As much as marriage may seem eons away , dating is the usual way in which young people meet and ultimately marry , &quot; the letter said .</TEXT>
