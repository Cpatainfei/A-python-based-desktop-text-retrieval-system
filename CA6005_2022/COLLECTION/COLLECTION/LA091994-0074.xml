   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE CREW LOOKS_FORWARD TO LANDING BUT MAY BE DELAYED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With their mission accomplished , Discovery ' s six astronauts looked_forward to coming_home today and taking their first showers in a week and a half . They may have to wait . Stormy weather was forecast for Kennedy Space Center at 11:23 a.m. PDT , the time of the scheduled landing . NASA could send the shuttle to Edwards Air_Force Base in California later in the day . The astronauts have a second landing opportunity in Florida at 12:55 p.m. PDT if bad_weather or technical problems force them to pass_up the first . &quot; It ' s pretty fatiguing up here . I think a lot of us are looking_forward to getting home , getting a good shower and some good old earthbound things we enjoy , &quot; Discovery ' s pilot , L . Blaine Hammond Jr. , said Sunday . On the other hand , Hammond said he and his crew mates would n ' t mind spending another day in orbit &quot; because it ' s an opportunity so rare. &quot; They ' ve been aloft since Sept . 9 . The astronauts achieved everything they set_out to do . They released and retrieved a sun-gazing satellite , measured the damaging effects of_their_own jet exhaust on space structures and helped direct laser pulses at Earth for an atmospheric study . And -- most spectacularly -- they tested a new jet pack during a rare untethered spacewalk . Astronaut Mark Lee described the spacewalk as a once-in-a-lifetime &quot; special treat. &quot; He became the first human satellite in 10 years on Friday when he disconnected his lifeline and used the jet pack to drift over an open cargo bay . Lee ' s partner , Carl Meade , gave him a spin and a toss to see if the jet pack would steady an astronaut tumbling out of control . It did . Meade also tried_out the jet pack . &quot; The total blackness of space just overwhelms you when you don ' t see the shuttle , &quot; Lee said during Sunday ' s space-to-ground news_conference . &quot; That part was probably the scariest of the whole part : When you ' re rotated , you ' re tumbled and all_of a sudden you see black . . . you hope that the shuttle shows_up again when you come around. &quot; The $ 7-million jet pack , called Safer , is intended as an emergency rescue device for future space_station crews . Only two exist but NASA plans to build more now that engineers know Safer works . The new units should be ready by 1997 . During routine landing preparations , the crew test-fired the 38 steering jets . One jet failed ; NASA said that would pose no problem for the trip home .</TEXT>
