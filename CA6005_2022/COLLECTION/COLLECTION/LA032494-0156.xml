   <HEADLINE> SUIT AGAINST NATO IS FILED BY YUGOSLAVIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The International_Court_of_Justice said Wednesday that Yugoslavia has started proceedings against NATO , accusing members of breaching the U.N. Charter by threatening to use force in Bosnia-Herzegovina without Security_Council authorization . The court said in a statement that Yugoslavia , now made_up of Serbia and Montenegro , has filed suit against NATO ' s member states for issuing an ultimatum threatening to bomb Serbian artillery encircling Sarajevo . Yugoslavia says the ultimatum breached U.N. rules because the threat of force had not been authorized by the Security_Council . At the time of the ultimatum , NATO officials said the threat of force was permissible under previous Security_Council resolutions relating to the Bosnian crisis . Artillery attacks on the Bosnian capital ended when the Serbs withdrew their guns from surrounding hills after NATO threatened air strikes if they were not removed by midnight Feb . 21 . The international court indicated that Yugoslavia ' s case may never be heard if individual NATO states do not agree to answer the charge .</TEXT>
