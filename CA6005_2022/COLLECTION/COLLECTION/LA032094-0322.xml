   <TEXT> The making of the man known as &quot; Japan ' s Oskar Schindler &quot; started this way : At 5:15 on a chilly summer morning in 1940 , Chiune Sugihara awoke to the sound of a low rumble outside . He was no industrialist , like the German who saved more_than 1 # 000 Jews by employing them in his factories , a story captured in the movie &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; Rather , Sugihara was Japan ' s consul general in Lithuania . On this particular morning , he peeked outside the curtained windows of the consular building and was startled to see the quiet street choked with a crowd of more_than 200 . Unnerved and afraid , Sugihara woke his wife and three children and hid them in a closet . But when he took a closer look , he saw that the people outside were not hostile . They were desperate . Their eyes were bloodshot . They looked fatigued . There were older_men in beards and hats , young boys , mothers holding infants . When they saw him , some put their palms together in prayerful entreaty . Others , excited , tried to climb over the fence . They were Polish Jews fleeing the encroaching German army , and Sugihara was their last hope to avoid the Nazi death camps . As war rumbled through Europe , all escape routes from Poland had been cut_off except a treacherous journey through the frozen hinterlands of the Soviet_Union via Lithuania . From the eastern port of Vladivostok , the refugees could sail to Japan and , from there , try to flee to China , North_America or the Dutch colony of Curacao . But they needed a transit visa through Japan . So they lined the streets , waiting for days , outside the Japanese mission . The pleas presented Sugihara with the kind of searing dilemma that confronts few people in a lifetime : a choice between individual conscience and national duty , between life and death . To issue the visas , he would have to defy orders from his government not to accommodate the Jews . Three times the 40-year-old official sent urgent cables to the Japanese government seeking permission to proceed ; three times he was refused . Japan was_on the verge of entering a military alliance with Germany and Italy and was being pressured to cooperate in addressing &quot; the Jewish problem. &quot; &quot; I had to do something , &quot; Sugihara told the U.S. military newspaper Stars and Stripes a year before his death at age 86 in 1986 . &quot; Those people told me the kind of horror they would have to face if they didn ' t get_away from the Nazis , and I believed them . There was no place else for them to go . &quot; I had to look_at it from the standpoint of humanity . I could only be fired and returned to Japan . What else were they going_to do ? &quot; He decided to defy his government , a choice that would change his life forever . He was in fact fired by the Foreign Ministry upon returning to Japan seven years later . Paradoxically , he remained a diplomat during the war , serving in various postings . For 28 days , from July 31 , 1940 , until the Japanese government ordered Sugihara out of Lithuania to Berlin , the consul general feverishly handwrote transit visas . From morning to night , he interviewed one applicant after another and wrote one visa after another . He lost_weight and grew weak with exhaustion . His wife , Yukiko , also suffered from stress ; she became unable to nurse their newborn son . But Sugihara kept writing permits , even after he closed the consulate and moved to a hotel for a_few days to wait for the train that would take him and his family to Germany . He kept writing even on the train , thrusting the precious pieces_of_paper through the window to waiting hands outside . In the end , he managed to write an estimated 1 # 600 visas , which the Israeli government and various scholars credit with saving the lives of 2 # 000 to 6 # 000 Jews . ( An entire family could travel on one visa. ) As the train rolled slowly out of the station , Sugihara bowed deeply to the Jewish refugees still crowding the platform and apologized : &quot; Please forgive me . I can ' t write any more . I will pray for your safety. &quot; Yukiko still recalls the look of shock on the faces of the remaining refugees . Nevertheless , as the train pulled_away , one shouted , &quot; Banzai , Japan ! &quot; Sugihara , we will not forget you ! &quot; the refugee shouted as he ran alongside the departing train . &quot; We will see you again. &quot; Most of the refugees never did see him again . But few forgot him . One who remembers is Samuiel Minski , 73 , a retired hosiery salesman living_in Framington , Mass . Thanks to a visa from Sugihara , the Polish native managed to escape to Japan with his mother and two siblings and , from there , join his father in the United States . The Minskis braved capture by the Lithuanian police as they crossed the Polish border . They took a two-week Trans-Siberian train journey over Russia and spent three months in Japan on an expired visa , departing on one of the last boats to leave before the Japanese attack on Pearl_Harbor . Today , Minski is a father of three and grandfather of six . &quot; Everyone is talking_about Schindler , but he used people as slave labor and made money off of them , &quot; Minski said . &quot; I ' m not minimizing what he did , but I feel we are forgetting the people who did these acts for pure good . &quot; Mr. Sugihara didn ' t get any money for what he did , and he suffered greatly for it . If it were not for his generosity and humanity , I am sure I would not be here today. &quot; Despite official opposition to Sugihara ' s acts , however , Jewish scholars say the Japanese government paradoxically supported Jews because it viewed them as rich potential allies . The government reportedly even developed an intriguing scheme , known as the &quot; Fugu Plan , &quot; to create a haven for Jews in Japanese-controlled Manchuria in exchange for financial help in developing the region and political influence in improving ties with Washington . Like fugu , the famous blowfish that is exquisite to eat when properly prepared but poisonous when not , Jews were seen as possible allies who could enrich Japan -- or destroy it if not handled carefully . The plan was never executed -- some people question whether it actually existed -- but Japan did continue to admit Jewish refugees into its settlement in Shanghai when other nations had closed their doors , and allowed them to overstay their visas by months . &quot; Jews have a debt they owe Japan , at least ( for its actions ) during World_War_II , regardless of motivation , &quot; said David Kranzler , author of &quot; Japanese , Nazis and Jews. &quot; Chiune Sugihara was born_on a day seeming to brim with promise : Jan . 1 , 1900 . The second son among six children , he quickly distinguished himself . His intelligence and sense_of_responsibility caused him to take_on many family duties normally given to the eldest son . When his father , a tax_collector , moved to Japan ' s colony of Korea to work , Sugihara supported the family by doing delivery jobs . After the father retired and began running a Japanese inn , the family joined him in Korea . There , the young Sugihara saw his father take_in impoverished Japanese even though they couldn ' t pay , while his mother cleaned their clothes and hair of lice . Sugihara proved an ace at foreign languages , entered Tokyo ' s elite Waseda University and , at age 19 , went_to study Russian in Manchuria . In 1924 , he entered the Foreign Ministry . For the next two decades , he would teach Russian , work as a translator and be posted to Lithuania , Berlin , Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European stations . He married a Russian woman in Manchuria , said his sister , Ryuko Nakamura , who lived with them . They divorced about 10 years later , and Sugihara married Yukiko , whom he met on a visit to Japan . Sugihara was a ladies ' man -- a source of many marital arguments -- and he loved to dance , play the piano and violin , throw parties and play mah-jongg . Ultimately , his choice to help the Jews probably shattered his career and his dream to become an ambassador to Russia . When he returned to Japan in 1947 , he was abruptly fired . Yukiko says he was clearly told it was because of the insubordination in Lithuania . The Foreign Ministry , however , denies any connection and says he was laid_off because of Allied orders to streamline the bureaucracy . The fact that he was given full retirement_benefits indicated it was a normal layoff , said Muneo Suzuki , a former Foreign Ministry official who investigated the case . Sugihara was reduced to peddling light_bulbs , working as a translator for international radio_broadcasts and running the PX operation for the Allied Occupation Forces , a job he considered beneath his dignity , said his son , Hiroki . In 1960 , he returned to Moscow with a trading firm and stayed there 15 years . When he went_back to Japan in 1975 , his family life was in disarray because of his long absence . &quot; There was never a sadder life than his , &quot; his sister said . But Hiroki said his father was not disappointed at all and felt he had achieved much . For nearly half a century , Sugihara ' s case remained virtually unknown in his country , although Israel gave him its version of the Nobel Peace Prize , the Yad Vashem Prize for Righteous Gentiles , in 1985 . A tree was planted in his honor near Jerusalem . No such laurels were bestowed upon him in Japan . Part of the reason was Sugihara himself : A modest man , he did not tell even his siblings about his heroic deeds in Lithuania . Nakamura , his sister , read about it in the newspapers four decades later . In a nation that honors obedience to authority more_than individual conscience , Sugihara ' s acts were not viewed_as particularly honorable by many top officials . In 1991 , Masamichi Hanabusa , then consul general in New York , appealed_to the Foreign Ministry to bestow official recognition on Sugihara before a visit by the Japanese foreign_minister to Israel that year . Hanabusa wanted to improve Japan ' s relations with Israel and the United States , and present the image of a Japanese humanitarian . But his faxes were never even acknowledged , said Suzuki , who at the time was the ministry ' s second-highest official . It took Suzuki , a politician then serving as the Foreign Ministry ' s parliamentary vice minister , to wrench open the case over the objections of reluctant bureaucrats . He was preparing to make Japan ' s first visit to the newly independent Lithuania , and , for better or worse , Sugihara still remained the most famous and important Japanese official there . &quot; I wanted to restore his honor , &quot; Suzuki said . &quot; He was a magnificent person who did an act of great humanitarianism and courage. &quot; But top Foreign Ministry officials vehemently objected , saying restoration was unnecessary since Sugihara was never dishonorably dismissed . Suzuki spent three days persuading them to go_along . Suzuki met with Sugihara ' s family in October , 1991 . Although he did not apologize for Sugihara ' s firing , he did express regrets for ignoring the family for five decades and officially praised Sugihara ' s acts . &quot; It was wrong for him to violate the orders , but it was an honorable act to save the lives of human_beings , &quot; Suzuki said . Shortly thereafter , then-Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa praised Sugihara in a Parliament hearing -- but also stopped short of an apology . Since then , the case has begun receiving broader public attention . The Education Ministry recently approved a textbook that presents his case for the first time . In 1992 , the Fuji Television Co . produced a docudrama about the case , &quot; Visas for Life. &quot; The program is attracting attention in the United States as well , where Boston University communications professor Robert Barram is spearheading efforts to circulate the film among colleges , libraries and study groups and broadcast it on both local television and PBS . Those who knew Sugihara say he would squirm under the limelight , for he believed he had done nothing extraordinary . &quot; They were human_beings . They needed help . I ' m glad I found the strength to give it to them , &quot; he said in a 1985 interview . &quot; For a Japanese , this is a natural thing to do. &quot; Researcher Chiaki Kitada of The Times ' Tokyo Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
