   <HEADLINE> ZEDILLO CASTS HIS NET WIDE -- AND KEEPS THE OPPOSITION OFF BALANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By boldly acting to reform Mexican politics in his first two weeks in office , President Ernesto Zedillo is raising hopes in a nation accustomed to cynicism and is confounding an opposition primed for confrontation . For starters , his nomination of Antonio Lozano of the National Action Party ( PAN ) to be attorney_general shocked stalwarts in the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) . Lozano will take_charge of the corruption-tainted federal police , the war on drugs and the investigations into the assassinations of two prominent PRI politicians . The appointment sends a message that impunity in high places will no longer be tolerated . This message carries a high political cost . Some of the more corrupt segments of the PRI , which supported Zedillo ' s candidacy , are feeling betrayed . Like former President Carlos Salinas de Gortrari , who courted the support of the more business-oriented PAN to neutralize PRI opponents of his economic reforms , Zedillo is inviting the collaboration of his foes to offset the loss of conservative support within his own party . The difference is that Zedillo is taking_on the far greater challenge of political reform and -- not coincidentally -- casting his net far wider to include the left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) . So far , at least , the changes have been dramatic . Six years ago , Salinas chose Enrique Alvarez del Castillo as his attorney_general , who while governor of Jalisco was linked to the murder of U.S. drug-enforcement agent Enrique Camarena . The appointment reassured political elites that they need not fear prosecution for corruption . For secretary of government , the second most powerful post after the presidency , Salinas chose Fernando Gutierrez Barrios , best known for his role in the 1968 massacre of several hundred student protesters in Mexico_City . That was a clear warning to the opposition not to protest too vigorously . When Gutierrez turned_out to be more the conciliator , Salinas replaced him with Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido , the governor of Chiapas who had gained notoriety by filling the jails with dissident Mayans , teachers and priests . By contrast , there are no hard-liners among Zedillo ' s key appointments . Salinas turned_to the army and police to deal with PRD protests ; Zedillo invites PRD legislators to lunch . In Chiapas , the spirit of collaboration has led to an unusual political appointment . Eduardo Robledo , the newly inaugurated governor whose election is disputed by the opposition , has chosen Eraclio Zepeda of the PRD to be his secretary of government . Zepeda , a longtime veteran of the Mexican left , has ties to the civilian wing of the Zapatista insurgency . Robledo could not have made such an appointment without the approval , perhaps encouragement , of Zedillo . All this courtship is causing confusion and division within the PRD , which is more accustomed to repression . Part of its leadership , including a party founder , Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , continues to see the PRI-dominated government as the agent of political murder and fixed elections . Thus , any overture from Mexico_City must be resisted as a cynical attempt at manipulation . But another segment of the PRD leadership sees an opportunity for a political breakthrough . While still wary , it is eager to test the new government ' s intentions . Spearheading this group is the party president , Porfirio Munoz Ledo , a brilliant political strategist with one of Mexico ' s most striking resumes . While a member of the PRI , Munoz Ledo served as secretary_of_labor , secretary_of_education , ambassador to the United Nations and president of the PRI . He quit the PRI in 1987 , after an ill-fated attempt to democratize the party from within . A year later , he was elected the first opposition senator in Mexican history and , in 1989 , joined Cardenas in founding the PRD . As Cardenas ' political star fades , the outcome of waning public support and personal inflexibility , Munoz Ledo is emerging as a major player on the Mexican political stage . Although he has not endorsed Zepeda ' s decision to take the No . 2 job in Chiapas , neither has he condemned it . Zedillo ' s initiatives also threaten to soften public sympathy for Subcomandante Marcos and his Zapatista rebels . The rebels ' central demand has been democracy and political reform . With no one seriously doubting that Zedillo won the election , they can no longer question the legitimacy of the federal_government . Nor -- with Zedillo proposing an overhaul of the police and the judiciary and the replacement of all members of the supreme_court -- can they argue that the president is not serious about reform . That leaves two outstanding issues . One is land_reform , which may be addressed through the appointment of Arturo Warman , another old leftist , to replace PRI stalwart and millionaire businessman Carlos Hank as secretary_of_agriculture . The other is electoral reform in Chiapas . Although some in Chiapas insist that the issues are for the state to resolve , they are inevitably a national concern . Clean elections at all levels of government are essential to the proper functioning of a federal system . Otherwise , the security of the entire federation is imperiled , as Chiapas is demonstrating . To ease tensions , and send an unmistakable message to other states and municipalities , Zedillo will need to ensure the replacement of Chiapas ' discredited electoral_system with a scrupulously fair one designed in collaboration with the president ' s new PRD luncheon guests .</TEXT>
