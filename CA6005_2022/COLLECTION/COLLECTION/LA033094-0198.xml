   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL WOES SURROUND JACKSON TV SPECIAL ; CONCERT : CHARITIES WILL RECEIVE $ 100 # 000 OF THE ESTIMATED $ 4.5 MILLION RAISED EVEN THOUGH PRODUCTION WAS BILLED AS A BENEFIT . PRODUCER SAYS CAST AND CREW ARE STILL OWED ABOUT $ 2 MILLION , AND MONEY FROM TICKET SALES HAS BEEN TIED_UP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The &quot; Jackson Family Honors &quot; NBC-TV show was brutally panned by critics when it aired Feb . 22 , but the mishaps on camera were nothing compared to the financial imbroglio unfolding behind the scenes . Five weeks after the show was taped at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas , the producer says the cast and crew of the 200-member production are still owed about $ 2 million -- with little evidence of money to pay them . In addition , only $ 100 # 000 of the estimated $ 4.5 million raised from the musical benefit will ever reach charities . &quot; I ' m angry and I ' m embarrassed , &quot; said Gary Smith , the Emmy-winning executive producer of the telecast , who said he has received only partial payment on his $ 400 # 000 producer fee . &quot; The Jacksons refuse to pay the money they owe me , and as a result I ' m unable to compensate the people I hired to work_on the show . The most frustrating part is how arrogant they act about it . In fact , Jermaine ( Jackson ) has never even called me since the show. &quot; The financial problems stem in part from the fallout of sexual molestation allegations made against Michael Jackson last summer by a 13-year-old boy . A series of complications resulted , including the loss of corporate sponsorships , debts incurred by postponing and moving the event to Las Vegas , and slow ticket sales . Since the event , financial disputes over possible ticket refunds have tied_up concert proceeds , and revenues from foreign broadcast fees are still forthcoming . Smith and others affiliated with the production also accuse members of the Jackson entourage of running_up expenditures on security , wardrobe and limousines in the days leading_up to the event . Various sources said the Jacksons spent at least four times more on room service than the $ 5 # 000 going_to the Library of Congress ' American Music Program -- one of several charities advertised as a beneficiary of the concert ' s net proceeds . &quot; Nobody here has heard a word from the Jacksons since the show , &quot; said Jill Bret , a public affairs officer at the Library of Congress . Jermaine Jackson , executive producer of the show and president of Jackson Communications Inc. , said his family did not waste money from the charity event , but acknowledged that bills are still outstanding . &quot; All this negative stuff is just being cooked_up to take_away from the beauty of what took_place , &quot; the 39-year-old performer said . &quot; I ' m sick and tired_of people picking on the Jacksons . This family did not spend hardly any money in Vegas . I didn ' t make one penny off this show and I mean , really , how much can clothing and limousines cost ? I ' m doing the best I possibly can . These people will get a check as soon as I get paid. &quot; Regardless of whether the production crew gets paid , the charities -- who were promised the show ' s net proceeds -- will receive no more_than $ 100 # 000 from Jackson Jubilee , a New Jersey-based nonprofit foundation . As it stands , St . John ' s Hospital in Santa Monica will receive about $ 50 # 000 with another $ 50 # 000 to be divided between the Northridge Hospital Medical_Center , the Library of Congress , the Friends of Conservation , the Red_Cross and the Salvation_Army , according to officials of the Studio City-based Permanent Charity Committee of the Entertainment_Industry , which could receive as much as $ 15 # 000 . Despite the lure of it being Michael Jackson ' s first formal stage performance since halting his world concert tour , the &quot; Jackson Family Honors &quot; event raised only half the projected $ 2.2-million ticket gate -- even though the price of thousands of mid-level seats were slashed from $ 350 to $ 150 after representatives of the pop superstar threatened that he would not appear if the house was not full , sources said . After the discount failed to stimulate sales , sources said an estimated 3 # 500 tickets were given to Jackson associates , MGM employees , casino patrons , Nellis Air_Force base personnel , charity groups and youth organizations from Las Vegas to Los Angeles at the last minute to fill the arena . In the fallout , TicketMaster , which handled the sale of tickets for the event , has refused to turn_over nearly $ 500 # 000 in proceeds after demands for refunds from customers who paid $ 350 for tickets only to find themselves seated next to people who paid $ 50 or nothing at all . The MGM Grand hotel has frozen an additional $ 400 # 000 in box_office proceeds after encountering similar ticket complaints and also to cover room service_charges and labor costs associated with the event . &quot; When a show doesn ' t turn_out exactly the way it ' s planned , everybody starts pointing fingers , &quot; said real_estate attorney Robert Petrallia , chief_executive_officer of the Iselin , N.J.-based Jackson Communications . &quot; As soon as we have a full accounting of where all_the money is , we will pay those whom we owe. &quot; Sources close to the concerts aid the family cannot possibly take_in enough money to pay_off the $ 5.7 million accrued in bills . The production was deeply in the hole before a single performer set foot on stage at the MGM Grand Garden Arena . The special -- originally scheduled to be taped Dec . 11 in Atlantic_City and broadcast Jan . 10 -- lost $ 2 million in corporate sponsorships and incurred $ 1 million in debts because of the postponement after Michael Jackson went_to Europe to reportedly treat a drug_addiction that he said stemmed in part from the 13-year-old ' s allegations of sexual molestation . Jackson Communications secured $ 2.6 million from NBC for broadcast fees in the United States after moving the show to Las Vegas . But even if the Jacksons collect the $ 700 # 000 in outstanding foreign broadcast fees and recover the $ 900 # 000 frozen by MGM Grand and TicketMaster , the foundation will come_up at least $ 1.7 million short . It is unclear where the remaining $ 1.1 million from NBC went . Sources speculated that Jackson Communications -- which collected a $ 300 # 000 fee -- spent the money on advertising , security , travel arrangements , plus legal and accounting fees and other costs associated with the event . Some insiders associated with the production have also begun to question the legitimacy of the Jackson nonprofit foundation . &quot; The Jacksons advertised this concert as a charity benefit , but all they really ended_up doing was throw themselves a big lavish party , &quot; said another executive close to the project . According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , Petrallia -- who organized the event with Jermaine Jackson and his parents -- was the target of a 1978 securities fraud investigation and pleaded guilty in 1982 to a tax misdemeanor after being indicted for conspiracy and mail_fraud by a New Jersey grand_jury . Petrallia said the Jackson Jubilee was incorporated under New Jersey law Nov . 8 , 1993 , and that applications were filed for nonprofit status soon after . The Internal Revenue Service , the New Jersey Charities Registration Office and the California Registry of Charitable Trusts have no record of the group . &quot; I am offended that anyone would try to turn all_the work I ' ve done for Mrs . Jackson and the Jackson family into something seedy and improper , &quot; Petrallia said . &quot; These allegations are absolutely erroneous . Jermaine Jackson agreed . &quot; This organization was set_up solely to help people , &quot; he said . &quot; We have integrity . We ' re going to make_good on our promises. &quot;</TEXT>
