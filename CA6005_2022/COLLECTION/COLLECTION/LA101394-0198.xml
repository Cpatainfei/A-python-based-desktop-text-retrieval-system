   <HEADLINE> UNION , MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS FREEZE ON SIGNINGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eugene Orza , associate general counsel of the baseball_players ' union , said Wednesday he expects to continue conversations with management officials today on the owners ' request for a 45-day freeze on contract signings and a delay in the start of free-agent filing from Saturday to Nov . 30 . However , Orza said collective_bargaining , tentatively scheduled to resume today , would probably not resume until next week because of business and travel commitments by many of the key people . He also said that the union would not make a decision on the freeze until Tuesday or Wednesday and that eligible players would be advised to hold_off filing until then . The union believes the freeze is designed strictly to give owners time to decide what provisions they want to retain in the salary-cap proposal they plan to implement and to shorten the off-season decision time for prospective free_agents and players in_general . The owners , citing the possibility of a bargaining agreement or eventual implementation of the salary-cap proposal , say the freeze would prevent the possibility of players signing under two sets of rules while giving the two sides an extended period to concentrate_on negotiations . Management lawyers have said they will consider imposing the freeze unilaterally if it is rejected , an act that would probably prompt the union to file a collusion grievance . ROSS NEWHAN</TEXT>
