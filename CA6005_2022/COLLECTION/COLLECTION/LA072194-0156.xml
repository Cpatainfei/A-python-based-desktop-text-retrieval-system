   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : MICROSOFT ' S MOMENT TO ' OPEN ' WINDOWS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As far as &quot; Billionaire Bill &quot; Gates is concerned , his Microsoft has finally popped the painful pimple of antitrust litigation . &quot; It ' s over , &quot; he told one newspaper . &quot; None of the people who run ( Microsoft ' s seven ) divisions are going_to change what they do or think or forecast . Nothing . Nothing . There ' s one guy in_charge of licenses . He ' ll read the agreements. &quot; Needless to say , the trustbusters over at the Justice_Department and the European Union beg to differ . But for all_the political posturing and Microsoft machismo surrounding this consent decree , the crucial issue here was not just the proposed breakup , restructuring or per-processor punishment of the world ' s most successful software company . The real issue is : What does this clash say about the future of software development and pricing ? Is it in Microsoft ' s best interests to proceed as if all_of its legal and political obstacles have , in_effect , been vanquished ? Or could the company exercise creative options that might let it neutralize further antitrust intervention even as it expands its market influence ? Few Microsoft competitors believe that Bill Gates is anything but a ruthless pragmatist who is even more concerned about Microsoft ' s market share than its margins . Remember , Gates became a billionaire not by charging premium prices for his wares but by continually cutting them . &quot; Bill will do whatever is necessary to achieve world domination , &quot; says Adobe Systems vice_president Deb Triant , tongue barely in cheek . &quot; For Microsoft , market share is everything . Market share_in the operating system is what drives their clout on the other ( applications software ) side of the business. &quot; Indeed , Microsoft ' s popular Windows operating system -- the software that coordinates and controls the internal workings of a personal_computer -- has rapidly evolved into a de_facto global industry standard . You can buy Windows software today for less than $ 60 . The overwhelming majority of entrepreneurs and enterprises developing applications software for PCs now write their software to conform_to Microsoft Windows . Numerous companies complain that Microsoft enjoys an unfair competitive advantage because Microsoft applications development people might have access to operating systems information that outsiders do not . that ' s one of the reasons why the trustbusters focused_on Windows as a key indicator of Microsoft ' s alleged monopolistic practices ( though this was not part of the consent decree ) . But Microsoft is now in a unique position to call everybody ' s bluff about the way it manages Windows . The company has a new , more powerful operating_system called Chicago coming_out early next year . In the wake of the consent decree , now is an excellent time for Microsoft to &quot; open_up &quot; its Windows operating system and put it into the public_domain . In the same way IBM created the &quot; open architecture &quot; personal_computer , Microsoft should turn Windows into an open-architecture operating_system . Over the next year or so , it should publish the source_code ( the system ' s blueprint ) and specifications and license them -- for a fee -- to software developers . Manage Windows as a standard , not just as a product , and it ' s entirely possible Microsoft becomes even more influential and Bill Gates becomes even richer . &quot; I think it would make a lot of sense for them to publish ( Windows specs ) and make their operating_system more open , &quot; acknowledges Adobe ' s Triant . &quot; Our developers would be ecstatic if Microsoft opened_up its source_code . They could accelerate applications development and come_up with much richer functionality. &quot; Sources at Microsoft say the idea has indeed been kicked_around . Of course , an open-architecture Windows could be sold more cheaply , though a company like Microsoft -- with a brand-name reputation for excellence and support -- could probably continue to command a premium price . &quot; that ' s the reason people follow Microsoft -- they continue to deliver value for the price , &quot; says Michael Tiemann , president of Cygnus Support , a small Mountain View , Calif. , software company that derives most of its revenue from servicing the software it in_effect gives_away . Tiemann argues that pushing Windows into the quasi-public domain would create a rich installed base from which Microsoft could reap service revenue . &quot; Microsoft has already made their money back on Windows and they ' re going to make their money on the next-generation operating system , &quot; contends Esther Dyson of EDventure Holdings , who has tracked Microsoft for more_than a decade . &quot; So it ' s an interesting option , but I don ' t think it ' s in character for the company. &quot; Moreover , Dyson points_out , Microsoft competitors such_as Novell would claim that a cheap , open-architecture Windows would qualify as &quot; predatory pricing ' and would undermine efforts to launch rival operating systems . &quot; I don ' t think Novell would take it kindly , &quot; she says . &quot; They ' d call_in the Justice_Department to investigate. &quot; that ' s the paradox , Dyson says : Making Windows a more open system may be seen as anti-competitive , even though it would give more developers and consumers more choices at lower prices . But isn ' t giving consumers standards that promote more choice at lower prices a goal of public policy ? Bill Gates is simply wrong if he believes that consent decree means he should go_back to business as usual . He has a provocative opportunity to rewrite the rules of the software game yet again by putting his company ' s flagship product into the public_domain -- and making money and market share from it . Let ' s see the Justice_Department explain how that is not in the public interest .</TEXT>
