   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON : DOUGLAS , REUTHER JOIN FORCES AGAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With Hollywood film production already running at a feverish pace , add another competitor to the power rolodex . Actor / producer Michael Douglas on Thursday announced that he has formed a company with veteran entertainment executive Steven Reuther . Douglas Reuther Productions is negotiating with possible equity partners , in addition to working_on a domestic distribution_agreement . One source denied speculation that the company is close to a striking a deal with Warner Bros . Douglas , whose production credits include the Academy Award-winning &quot; One Flew Over the Cuckoo ' s Nest , &quot; is disbanding his Columbia Pictures-based Stonebridge Entertainment . Reuther , who recently resigned as president of New Regency Productions , previously worked with Douglas on &quot; War of the Roses , &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; and &quot; Falling Down. &quot; * Lyle Lovett has another new partner besides actress Julia Roberts -- PolyGram Music Publishing Group . Lovett is the first major performer signed by the company ' s new president , David Simone , who has been brought_in to bolster PolyGram ' s roster in the publishing area . PolyGram beat_out larger companies such_as Warner / Chappell Music for the Lovett catalogue , which has been administered by Criterion Music . Ken Levitan , his manager , says Lovett chose PolyGram because of his friendship with Simone , who used to work_at MCA , and because PolyGram offered &quot; a wonderful environment as a place to house Lyle ' s songs. &quot; Lovett ' s recording contract with MCA is not affected by the deal . Simone says he plans to work with other divisions at the London-based conglomerate , including PolyGram Filmed Entertainment , to find new ways of exploiting songs by Lovett and other publishing clients -- including U2 , k.d. lang and the Cranberries . * As Tom Hanks accepted the best actor Oscar for &quot; Philadelphia &quot; on Monday , former TriStar Pictures Chairman Mike Medavoy watched from a hotel_room outside Palm Springs . Medavoy , who gave the go-ahead to the film at TriStar , says he left town to escape all_the Oscar hubbub . After arriving_at his hotel , Medavoy says he spent most of the evening &quot; watching the stars and just gazing out into the air. &quot; He switched_on the telecast just in time to catch Hanks ' emotional acceptance speech . After a half-hour , and not feeling well , he &quot; turned_off the TV . . . and went_to sleep. &quot; Medavoy , who left TriStar two months ago , says he is in no hurry to rejoin Hollywood ' s rat_race . But that doesn ' t mean that he ' s turned a totally deaf ear to the pitter-patter of little paws . He confirmed published reports of business conversations with Peter Hoffman , the former Carolco executive who heads the production / dealmaking firm Cinevisions ; and Arnold W . Messer , who used to run Columbia / TriStar International . Medavoy says he has also met with &quot; foreign entities , &quot; though he refused to identify the companies or the nature of the discussions . &quot; I ' m kind of looking_at everything to see what I should do , and want to do , &quot; he adds . * American films may_not be much in_evidence at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival , based on recent reports . But organizer Julie Sisk says the American Pavilion definitely will return . The pavilion is a lively gathering place for industry-oriented panel_discussions , celebrity appearances ( this week ' s Oscar winner for best actress , Holly Hunter , opened the center last year ) , the crowded bar scene and the nighttime parties , including a raucous New Line Pictures event last year for &quot; Menace 2 Society. &quot; Sisk says she is still lining_up sponsors . Also at_issue is whether the pavilion will return to its usual location next to the festival headquarters , since organizers are considering a change of venue . Either way , says Sisk , the show will go_on . * Count Bruce McNall as one forgiving guy . The Los Angeles Kings owner and sometime movie producer was conspicuously not absent from the exclusive Vanity_Fair party on Oscar night , even though he ' s accused in the magazine ' s current issue of being a former coin smuggler . McNall has downplayed the significance of events described in the magazine . A spokesman says that the Kings owner came_to the party because he was invited . McNall spent much of the evening with a fellow ice_hockey magnate , Walt Disney Co . Chairman Michael D . Eisner . Other East / West Coast powerbrokers at the party , co-hosted by producer Steve Tisch and Vanity_Fair editor Graydon Carter : Advance Publications ' S.I. and Donald Newhouse , financiers Ronald Perelman and Marvin Davis , QVC Chairman Barry Diller , Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg , Universal Studios Chairman Tom Pollock and Robert Daly and Terry Semel of Warner Bros . From Washington there was presidential spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers and political power couple James Carville and Mary Matalin . Behind the scenes Hollywood figures included producers John Davis , Joel Silver , Ted Field , Leonard Goldberg , David Friendly , Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer , and talent_agents Jim Wiatt , Jay Moloney and Rick Nicita .</TEXT>
