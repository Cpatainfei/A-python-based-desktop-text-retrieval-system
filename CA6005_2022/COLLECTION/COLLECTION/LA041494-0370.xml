   <HEADLINE> SECURITIES FIRM ALLEGES RAIDS ON TALENT , SUES PRUDENTIAL ; BROKERAGES : IRVINE-BASED LIBERTY CAPITAL MARKETS CONTENDS INDUSTRY GIANT USED UNFAIR ADVANTAGE TO IDENTIFY , LURE 4 TOP SALESPEOPLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A small securities company , joining a growing group of operations upset that major brokerage_houses are raiding their talent , has sued giant Prudential Securities Inc. for $ 12 million , alleging that it lured away its four top salespeople . Liberty Capital Markets Inc. accuses Prudential in a San Francisco Superior_Court lawsuit of using their confidential working relationship to identify and hire Liberty ' s top producers , thus disrupting Liberty ' s business . Prudential had been Liberty ' s agent in clearing all securities transactions , thus gaining access to customer activity and salespeople ' s performances , Doyle L . Holmes , Liberty ' s president , said in a prepared statement . In addition , the Irvine bond broker and dealer contends that Prudential defamed it by suggesting in a pamphlet at a recent convention that Liberty was out of business , said Liberty ' s lawyer , Joseph L . Alioto , a former San Francisco mayor . Prudential spokesman William J . Ahearn said he knew_nothing about the alleged defamation , but he denied that his firm did anything wrong . Prudential recruited one of the four Liberty brokers two years ago , and the others approached Prudential about jobs 16 to 18 months ago , he said . On the other hand , Prudential has asked a court to stop Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis from hiring any more of its employees . Dain Bosworth had lured 13 Prudential salespeople from the company ' s Bellevue , Wash. , office in the past five months . Liberty ' s suit , filed Monday , is one of a number of lawsuits filed recently against major brokerages accusing them of wrongly raiding smaller companies . &quot; In the industry , raids happen on a fairly regular basis , &quot; he said . &quot; We don ' t normally pursue these matters much . Some companies go_to arbitration , some go_to court. &quot; Top salespeople , he said , are being offered &quot; significant &quot; pay packages now , so more job switching is occurring , and that is probably leading to more arbitrations and lawsuits . Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville , for instance , recently sued Smith Barney Shearson Inc. in federal_court in Miami for allegedly luring away its top three salespeople and two assistants .</TEXT>
