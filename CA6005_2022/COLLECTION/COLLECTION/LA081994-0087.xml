   <HEADLINE> DEAR BOSS : WE WON . BYE ; INSURANCE_FIRM LOSES ENTIRE DEPARTMENT WHEN 4 LOTTO MILLIONAIRES QUIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four co-workers at an Irvine insurance_company fulfilled just about every employee ' s fantasy Thursday : They promptly quit their jobs after winning a share of the $ 20-million lottery jackpot . The women ' s investment in a winning SuperLotto ticket ( which came_to $ 3.25 each for 13 quick picks ) catapulted them from &quot; unimportant , unlucky &quot; claims processors at Fidelity National Title Insurance Co . to millionaires , they said at a news_conference at a California Lottery district office . The four friends will be sharing $ 6.8 million of Wednesday ' s $ 20-million jackpot . That means they each will receive $ 85 # 250 a year , before taxes , over the next 20 years . Two other winning tickets have not been turned_in yet , lottery officials said . The departure of the four Fidelity workers means the 150-employee Irvine branch will lose an entire department . Their boss , however , remained sanguine about the turn of events . &quot; They were the claims payment processing department , &quot; said Frank P . Willey , executive_vice_president of Fidelity . &quot; we ' ll hire new people unless they end_up reconsidering . Maybe their euphoria will temper a little . It ' ll be business as usual. &quot; But there were no signs of waning excitement as the four women checked_off a list of &quot; to do ' s &quot; with their first check . Although they declined to say how much they made at Fidelity , they said it was &quot; much less &quot; than what they will be getting_in lottery money each year . And there were no mentions of returning to work -- except maybe to help train the new employees . &quot; I wish I had a picture of ( Willey ' s ) face when we told him , &quot; said Suzanne Seibold , 40 , of Westminister . Tina DiGeorge , 22 , of Garden Grove had worked in the department for only a week when she adopted 13 as the group ' s lucky number and urged co-worker Debra Larson to buy 13 quick pick tickets at a liquor_store in Fountain Valley . Seibold had to scrounge in her purse for enough money to pay_for the lottery tickets , she said . Karla Bresette , 22 , of Westminister also contributed . Larson , 31 , of Garden Grove said : &quot; We just went nuts &quot; when lottery officials verified their good_fortune Wednesday at 8:08 p.m. &quot; We were yelling , crying , screaming . It was pandemonium , &quot; Larson said breathlessly .</TEXT>
