   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; EURO DISNEY SHARES OFF 3.3 % AFTER FRENCH MAGAZINE PROJECTS LOWER PARK ATTENDANCE ; ENTERTAINMENT : THE COMPANY CONDEMNS THE REPORT AS HAVING ' NO BASIS IN REALITY , ' SAYS IT WILL PROVIDE ITS OWN FIGURES NEXT MONTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Euro Disney shares fell 3.3 % on Monday after a French business magazine reported the park will show substantially lower attendance in the year ended Sept . 30 , along with disappointing merchandise and food spending . The theme park , whose parent company is 49 % -owned by Walt Disney Co. , quickly refuted the report by L ' Expansion , saying it had &quot; no basis in reality. &quot; Euro Disney ' s results for the fiscal_year are expected to be released next month . Analysts have expected the company to stem the flow of red ink after losing close to $ 1 billion in its last fiscal_year . In addition , Chairman Philippe Bourguignon said earlier this year that losses would be lower , but he didn ' t elaborate . The company , which is also operated by Disney , underwent a financial restructuring -- including a $ 1-billion rights issue -- with its 61 banks earlier this year . French securities regulators put a warning in the prospectus saying that the company is not expected to be profitable before fiscal 1996 . Euro Disney has been plagued by soft attendance since opening in April , 1992 . It has been trying to boost the number of visitors to the park by slashing prices and launching special promotions . But attendance has been falling steadily . In its first year , the park outside Paris had 10.5 million visitors ; that fell to 9.8 million in the fiscal_year ended Sept . 30 , 1993 . The L ' Expansion article claimed total attendance at the park won ' t exceed 8.2 million in fiscal 1994 . Previously , Euro Disney officials had forecast about 9 million visitors . The article also said Euro Disney attracted 25 # 000 visitors on some days in July and that in August the average was 40 # 000 . It added that visitors were spending much less on food and Disney merchandise . The article also said the average spending on food by each visitor totaled 51 francs , compared to the 53 francs forecast by the company at the time of a restructuring . In addition , average spending on merchandising totaled 48 francs per head , compared to Euro Disney ' s forecast of 53 francs , the magazine said . The article also said revenue will be lower than the $ 919-million figure in fiscal 1993 . &quot; The attendance figures published in L ' Expansion don ' t bear any resemblance to reality , &quot; said Jacques-Henri Eyraud , a spokesman for the company . &quot; These figures are wrong , and Euro Disney deplores the slapdash journalism of a magazine whose article contains a number of factual errors. &quot; Euro Disney declined to comment specifically on L ' Expansion ' s account of tourist spending . The company did not supply its own numbers , but it said it will provide data when its results are published in November . Euro Disney has blamed its problems on the slow European economy , the strong French_franc that has made the park more expensive for visitors from surrounding countries and the lack of spending by visiting tourists . Saudi Prince Al Waleed ibn Talal ibn Abdulaziz al Saud recently announced he would acquire up_to 24 % of the park . He is believed to own about 10 % now . Disney ' s stock closed $ 1.125 higher at $ 39 on the New York Stock_Exchange on Monday .</TEXT>
