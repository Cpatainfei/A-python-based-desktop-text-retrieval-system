   <TEXT> When banker Doug Lawson moved his family here recently from Singapore , he learned the hard way what real_estate_agents are fond of calling &quot; shock_therapy , Hong Kong-style. &quot; The first jolt came when he finally found an apartment big enough to house his wife , Laura , and four children . The apartment , on the 30th floor of a high-rise in trendy Tai Tam on Hong Kong Island , was less than half the size of his former townhouse in Singapore . The rent : a lofty $ 9 # 000 a month . The second shock came the next day when he sent_in a check to secure the lease . The landlord claimed to have other tenants ready to move_in and bumped the rent up_to a budget-busting $ 11 # 000 a month . &quot; We didn ' t have a choice , &quot; Lawson recalled . &quot; I had to sign before they raised it any more . It ' s just crazy out there. &quot; Move_over , Tokyo . In the unreal world of Hong Kong real_estate , prices for everything from offices to parking_spaces are now among the world ' s highest . Monthly apartment rentals in five figures are not uncommon , while lucky owners of apartments have seen their small down_payments blossom into multimillion-dollar fortunes . At one benchmark complex , the Royal Cliff , in an area favored by Americans on the south_side of Hong Kong , apartments go_for $ 25 # 000 a month . A house on Victoria Peak , Hong Kong ' s swankiest address , recently sold for a record $ 35 million to a buyer who wants to put a housing_development in the home ' s back garden . &quot; My agents always keep a box of tissues in the car , &quot; said Jan McNally , associate director for residential property at broker Richard Ellis , which caters to American and British executives . &quot; The wives always cry on the first day out looking_at what ' s available. &quot; Underlying the high prices is tremendous demand from foreign businessmen flooding into the colony hoping to cash_in_on the boom next door in China , combined with an extreme shortage of land in crowded Hong Kong , one of the most densely populated areas in the world . In addition , because Hong Kong ' s currency is tied directly to the U.S. dollar , low interest_rates and high inflation have made real_estate a much more attractive investment than parking spare cash_in a bank . But the dizzying prices have raised a number of pressing concerns about Hong Kong ' s future . Some multinational companies are beginning to relocate administrative staff to less costly locations in China or Singapore . Many local couples entering the housing market for the first time can no longer afford to either buy or rent an apartment . But most worrisome of all is the possibility of a collapse in property prices of the magnitude experienced in Los Angeles and Tokyo in recent years . By some estimates , property accounts_for more_than 60 % of the Hong Kong stock_market and a sudden downturn could have a major impact on the economy of the territory , and in adjoining Chinese provinces . Many see a real_estate crunch as a greater threat to Hong Kong ' s future than its scheduled hand-over to Chinese rule_in 1997 . Sensing that the market was severely overheating , Hong Kong ' s British rulers took steps_in June to deflate the property market gently . Prices have already come_down more_than 10 % and many speculators have moved to the sidelines , at least for now . On the other hand , almost half of Hong Kong ' s 6 million residents are insulated from the immediate effects of the high costs because they live_in public housing_developments where the rent is as little as $ 135 a month . There were cries of outrage recently when the government reported that nearly one-sixth of the families in public housing also owned private apartments for speculative purposes , even though the apartments are reserved for low-income families . At one point , real_estate was in such demand that members of Triad gangs , wearing the signature white gloves of Hong Kong ' s underworld hoodlums , tried to gain control of the huge lines of prospective buyers trying to get_into new real_estate deals . The government responded by adopting strict laws requiring property_owners to sell new developments by lottery under the supervision of an accounting_firm . &quot; We ' re gradually letting the air_out of the balloon , &quot; said Fanny Law , deputy secretary for planning , environment and lands . &quot; There was too_much speculation in the market , and prices pushed_up too rapidly , driving_out the genuine homeowners. &quot; Nonetheless , skeptics like Swiss fund manager Marc Faber , a renowned pessimist about Hong Kong real_estate , believe the market is heading for a selloff of major proportions . &quot; In real terms , I doubt if property prices will ever rise this high again . Forever. &quot; Although Faber ' s view is still not widely shared , Hong Kong banks have sharply curtailed their lending to avoid the kind of crisis that buffeted the U.S. savings and loan industry in the late 1980s . At least two major banks have stopped providing mortgages because they have reached their government-imposed ceiling of 40 % of assets in real_estate loans . At other major banks , getting a mortgage has become much harder . Michael Broadbent , a spokesman for the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. , the territory ' s largest bank , said buyers now need to put_up 50 % of the purchase_price in cash for apartments costing more_than $ 675 # 000 , up from the 10 % demanded last year . Less expensive apartments require a 30 % down_payment . &quot; We don ' t see a collapse , &quot; Broadbent said . &quot; Fundamentally , demand is there . Hong Kong is still very strong. &quot; According to First Pacific Davies , a real_estate firm that closely tracks the market , residential rental prices have surged 53 % in the last year , while apartment sale prices have soared an average of 38 % and office rents have risen 47.3 % . Those increases have affected everyone in Hong Kong , from those in $ 20 # 000-a-month luxury apartments in prime districts to $ 1 # 000-a-month tenements in the back_streets of poor neighborhoods . As in Los Angeles in the 1980s , real_estate has become a Hong Kong obsession , a recurring theme of cocktail_parties and dinner conversations . Those who have made a killing can ' t resist exulting , while those who stayed out of the market forever lament their misfortune . &quot; One of the most boring things about Hong Kong is people must talk_about how much money they make , and especially how much money they have made in real_estate , &quot; said Stuart Wolfendale , a popular columnist for the Eastern Express newspaper . He noted that high-priced real_estate is driving_out many artisans and writers who can no longer afford the rents . In fact , prices of apartments are so high that small-time speculators have developed a niche market for parking_spaces . A spot in a good location costs more_than $ 125 # 000 , car not included . &quot; Imagine paying more for a parking_space in Hong Kong than for a house in Australia ! &quot; said Isabel B . Michie , residential director at First Pacific Davies . &quot; While housing prices in Britain have increased by three times in the last 10 years , in Hong Kong housing prices have increased six times. &quot; Office space is even more precious than apartments ; offices in Exchange Square , the Hong Kong equivalent of Wall_Street , rent for $ 14 a square_foot per month , one of the world ' s steepest rates . One sign of the burgeoning value of office space : Seven major hotels have been pulled_down in recent months to make_way for office towers , despite a hotel occupancy_rate of 85 % in the territory . Even the landmark Hong Kong Hilton , which just completed a $ 12-million renovation , announced that it was closing its doors in January . At current prices , each of the Hilton ' s 750 rooms is estimated to be worth more_than $ 1 million . The engine driving the property boom at the top end of the market is a surge in foreign business people setting_up shop in the territory as a base camp for doing business in China ' s booming economy . Official immigration figures show the number of Americans in Hong Kong has gone from 19 # 300 in 1990 to 29 # 500 in May , 1994 . Equally dramatic increases have been registered for Japanese , British , Australian and Canadian business people . Gerald L . Murdock , chairman of the American Chamber_of_Commerce , noted that the high rents have failed , so far , to deter many companies from setting_up operations here . &quot; If China is your No . 1 priority , Hong Kong is_on its doorstep , &quot; Murdock said . &quot; There ' s nobody even close for doing business in Asia. &quot; Many American companies are keeping their U.S. executives in Hong Kong rather than China because prices are almost as high in Beijing and Shanghai , and most Chinese cities lack basic amenities such_as schools with a curriculum for foreign students . The market appears to have been driven by U.S. financial_institutions , which have poured personnel into Hong Kong in the last two years to take_advantage of the region ' s economic boom . The investment bank of Salomon Brothers , for example , had only 60 employees in Hong Kong 18 months ago , but now has 250 , mostly expatriates . &quot; We ' ve seen_doubling rents in that time , &quot; said Jim Ward , head of human resources at the investment house . &quot; We ' re trying to hold the line. &quot; Companies such_as Merrill Lynch , Unisys and Britain ' s Standard Chartered Bank have moved a substantial number of employees to Singapore , where rents are about half as high . But most companies cite operational reasons other_than the high cost of real_estate for their moves . Cathay Pacific , Hong Kong ' s international air carrier , has been aggressively trying to move jobs out of the territory . Last year , it transferred some of its accounting operations to Guangzhou in China and recruited 250 people locally . It is moving its data center to Sydney , Australia , in 1995 &quot; because of cheap land , &quot; said Cathay Pacific spokesman C . F . Kwan . Cathay also has offered its pilots , who are predominantly British or American , the option of living in their countries_of_origin . Cathay gets_to keep its $ 7 # 000-a-month or so housing allowance , while the pilots commute to work from as far as Los Angeles . So far , 100 out of the airline ' s 1 # 100 pilots have volunteered for the plan . One intrepid Australian businessman , an insurance_broker named Clive Wolstencroft , even commutes to work here from Macao , the Portuguese colony that lies across the Pearl River estuary from Hong Kong . Wolstencroft endures a three-hour daily commute by hydrofoil but says he is able to afford a house with a swimming_pool at half the cost of a Hong Kong apartment . While few executives are emulating Wolstencroft ' s marathon commute , real_estate_agents said that all but the most affluent companies are trying some form of &quot; downsizing , &quot; such_as setting a fixed housing allowance , which either requires executives to find smaller apartments or move_into outlying districts , formerly considered socially unacceptable . Rather than being a single territory , Hong Kong is a collection of islands off China ' s southern coast , plus the Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories beyond , all linked by ferry , tunnel or rail . Most foreigners tend to prefer the_British colonial atmosphere of Hong Kong Island to the more ethnic Chinese character of Kowloon . But even the New Territories , a 90-minute trip from the financial district , are sprouting yuppie apartment_buildings where rice_paddies used to bloom , with incredibly tiny , 8-by-10-foot &quot; micro-apartments &quot; selling for more_than $ 20 # 000 . For those Hong Kong Chinese not protected by public housing , the real_estate boom has turned some people into millionaires but threatens to undermine new families starting_out . Newspaper cartoons poke_fun at the endless battles taking_place between young wives and mothers-in-law forced by economic necessity to share the same roof . &quot; The 116 % increase in residential property prices recorded in the past three years &quot; has outstripped the growth in what people earn , said a study by Hang Seng Bank . The result is &quot; that home purchases have become increasingly unaffordable to most &quot; buyers . Housing prices also have been driven_up by another unforeseen phenomenon : the return to Hong Kong of thousands of Chinese who emigrated to the United States , Canada and Australia after the crackdown on human_rights in China during the Tian An Men Square demonstrations in 1989 . An estimated 20 # 000 Hong Kong Chinese with Canadian passports -- known colloquially as &quot; astronauts &quot; because they leave their families behind in the West and fly back to Hong Kong on business -- have returned home because they were struggling to make ends meet overseas . Because many sold their homes_in the bear_market after Tian An Men , a lot of the &quot; astronauts &quot; can ' t find an affordable house in today ' s Hong Kong .</TEXT>
