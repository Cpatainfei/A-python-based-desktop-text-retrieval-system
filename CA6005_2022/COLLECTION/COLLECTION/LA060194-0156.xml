   <HEADLINE> DEFENSE SELDOM RESTS_ON ISSUES OF ETHICS AND DUTY ; LAW : ATTORNEYS WALK FINE LINE IN COACHING CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS . SOME CASES WEIGH HEAVILY ON THE CONSCIENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Criminal defense_attorney Cristina Arguedas was representing a black_man charged with raping a white_woman . The police had picked him up as a registered sex offender -- he previously served prison time for three rapes -- and the victim tentatively identified him in a lineup . During the trial , Arguedas attacked the victim ' s identification of her client as not only weak but racist . She won an acquittal . Four months later , she picked_up her telephone and heard a public_defender say that the man had just been arrested again for rape . &quot; I went_through this whole reflective , guilty thing that I had used my skills to injure another woman , &quot; she said . It was the ultimate criminal defense_attorney ' s nightmare . Obligated to defend with zeal , these lawyers nevertheless confront personal dilemmas in their relationships with their clients , caught between duty to the accused and revulsion for their violent crimes . Like all lawyers , they also wrestle with ethical boundaries in the lengths they can go_to defend and coach their clients . They can shape the story their clients will tell at trial , but they are not supposed to fabricate a script . For Arguedas , the nightmare proved short-lived . After a week of torment , the public_defender called her back . Her former client had been in a bank at the time of the rape and could not possibly have done_it . &quot; So then I was a hero , &quot; said Arguedas , who has been a criminal defense_lawyer for 15 years . &quot; It was at that time I realized that this isn ' t for me to figure_out . The system requires that someone like him have an absolutely vigorous defense. &quot; Although defense_attorneys are often reviled by a crime-weary public , they are viewed_as being among the more ethical members of the legal_profession because prosecutors and , in some cases , the public , scrutinize their every move . They usually get paid whether they win or not . &quot; The criminal defense bar is far more honorable to deal with than the civil bar , &quot; said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist . Atty . Marsh Goldstein , a prosecutor for nearly 30 years . Considered the emergency doctors of the legal world , the nation ' s estimated 15 # 000 to 25 # 000 criminal defense_attorneys face realities that would have disappointed audiences of Perry Mason . Most of their clients are guilty : About 90 % of them plead so , although usually to reduced charges , experts say . The attorneys practice alone or in small firms , enjoy less status in bar associations than other lawyers , and , as a group , tend to distrust government and gravitate to the underdog . Although a_few earn fame and enormous riches , about half earn less than $ 80 # 000 a year and only a quarter make more_than $ 125 # 000 , according to a 1991 survey by a defense_lawyers association . Lawyers who defend white-collar criminals tend to earn the most . Arguedas is one of the rising stars of the profession . Working_out of a warehouse district near Berkeley , she dresses in casual slacks , a long-sleeved shirt and sensible walking boots that would be appropriate on a hiking trail . Her defense of the accused rapist violated no ethics : She was obligated to challenge the victim ' s identification , even though she personally suspected that he probably had raped the woman . The ethical land_mines arise in the shaping of the defense , the intimate conversations between attorney and client where strategy is plotted and testimony is planned , where the story the defendant will tell in trial is pieced together . These conversations are usually privileged , and the lawyer , like a priest hearing a confessor ' s sins , is obligated not to disclose them . But defense_lawyers described a variety of techniques they use with their clients , and ethics experts disagreed about how far the lawyers should go_in molding a defendant ' s tale . Discrediting a prosecution witness the lawyer knows to be truthful is within ethical bounds , legal ethicists say , but helping a client perjure himself is far more problematic . Lawyers are supposed to obtain &quot; a set of facts &quot; from their clients , not invent a story for them , said Yale law professor Geoffrey Hazard . For instance , the lawyer should not tell a woman who killed her husband that she should claim she was abused by him if she was not . &quot; But the fact of the_matter is , lawyers do tell their clients what to do , indirectly , &quot; said Hazard , who teaches legal ethics . &quot; How artificial they are , how artful , varies . . . . What do you do if you have a dumb client ? &quot; Before asking_for the facts , some attorneys may first inform their clients of the legal defenses to their crime . To a man charged with hit-and-run , the lawyer might say : &quot; If you ran from the scene because you feared the other driver was going_to kill you , you may be acquitted . Take a_couple_of days to think_about why you fled before you tell me what happened. &quot; Some ask their clients what the prosecutor will contend , not what happened , and give their clients a type of Miranda warning to avoid having to keep them off the stand . Others say they want all_the facts immediately and just try to put them in the best light . In many cases , the attorney simply tries to show that the government has not proved its case . Ethical rules approved by state high_courts tend to be ambiguous and often contradictory , and lawyers can interpret them differently . Stanford_University law professor William H . Simon , reflecting a minority view among legal ethicists , believes it is unethical for a defense_attorney to try to impugn a truthful prosecution witness by arguing , for example , that the witness had poor eyesight . Yet Hazard maintains that the lawyer is duty-bound to challenge the witness whose eyesight might be questionable . Even if the client told the lawyer he committed the crime , &quot; that does not mean the witness observed him doing_it , &quot; Hazard reasoned . Simon , whose views are stricter than most other ethicists , also believes a defense_lawyer should not withhold pertinent information from the court -- even if it is damaging to the client -- or present a defense the lawyer is certain is untrue . In a law review_article last year , Simon cited the case of a Washington public_defender whose client was charged with receiving stolen property . Police had arrested him as he and an accomplice transferred the stereo and television from a junked car to the back seat of the borrowed car the client was driving . The client confided to his lawyer that he had put the property in the back seat because he did not have a key for the trunk . But the lawyer argued in court that the client obviously did not know the property was stolen because he did not try to conceal it in the trunk . A jury convicted the defendant anyway . The lawyer , in Simon ' s view , had acted unethically . &quot; He presented misleading information to a jury , &quot; Simon said . Although lawyers can properly suggest a defense if the evidence does not exclude it , basing a case on a lie usually fails , many criminal defense_attorneys say . &quot; If ( clients ) are going_to concoct a defense because you suggested one , they are going_to get torn to shreds on cross-examination , &quot; said Oakland lawyer Robert Kroll . &quot; They are not going_to be believed. &quot; But lawyers must probe their clients ' memories . It is perfectly proper to tell a client in an interview : &quot; I am not sure you were focusing as sharply as you should have when you gave the answer , &quot; or &quot; would n ' t it be just as accurate if you phrased it this way ? &quot; said Hofstra University Law_School professor Monroe Freedman . As officers of the court , lawyers are not supposed to aid their clients in committing perjury , and criminal defense_attorneys almost uniformly insist that they do not allow their clients to perjure themselves . Rules vary by state . California ' s bar association recommends that lawyers withdraw from a case if they cannot dissuade their client from lying on the stand . If they cannot withdraw , they should refrain_from repeating the lies_in courtroom arguments . But lawyers have latitude as long as they have no actual knowledge , such_as corroborating evidence , that the testimony is perjurious , Freedman said . In any case , most lawyers do not consciously or deliberately allow their clients to lie on the witness_stand , said Yale ' s Hazard . &quot; Either they talked themselves into the fact that it is not going_on , that the person is just skirting the truth . . . or the lawyer manages to persuade herself that it might be the truth , or maybe it is not the truth and the lawyer pretends to be surprised , &quot; he said . San Francisco Public_Defender Jeff Brown recalled that in his first criminal case , the defendant changed his story in the middle of the trial after realizing the prosecution ' s witnesses were unsure of the weapon he used in an assault . At first the client said he had a gun , later a wrench . Brown asked the judge to allow him to withdraw from the case once he realized his client was going_to lie on the stand . The judge balked -- &quot; We ' re in the middle of a trial &quot; -- and told him to proceed . The perjury worked . The jury was hung , and charges were dropped to a misdemeanor . &quot; I think what you have to do is say to your client , ' Look , I don ' t think this a very good idea , ' and try to convince him not to lie on the stand , &quot; Brown said . &quot; But as a practical matter , an awful lot of perjury goes_through the courts , not just in the criminal bar . It ' s pervasive throughout the system. &quot; Beyond the ethical quagmires , criminal defense_attorneys say they must overcome their personal horror of their clients ' suspected crimes to become effective advocates . &quot; You fight against any impulse of being repulsed by the crime itself , &quot; said San Diego criminal defense_attorney Chuck Sevilla , the appellate lawyer for Robert Alton Harris , who was executed in 1992 . Harris killed two boys and then ate their hamburgers . North Carolina attorney Donald H . Beskind , who teaches trial skills at Duke University Law_School , said people always ask how a lawyer can defend someone so awful &quot; because they never have to meet the person who is charged with the crime. &quot; &quot; They hear the crime and then they presume what the person is like , &quot; Beskind said . &quot; When you . . . meet the person and understand what has gone_on in their lives that made them that way , you have a very different reaction to them. &quot; Concerned about a client repeating his crime , defense_attorney Alan Dershowitz subjects the defendants he represents to a standard lecture . His clients have included Claus von Bulow and Leona Helmsley . &quot; Every dog gets one bite , &quot; the Harvard law professor tells his clients . &quot; Don ' t dream of calling me if you ever get_in trouble again . Not only will I not represent you , I will be_on the other side. &quot; When Dershowitz won the freedom many years ago of a murder defendant -- he had helped plant a bomb that killed a young_woman -- he was unable to celebrate . The victim haunted him . Rather than suffer such quandaries , some lawyers refuse to accept clients whose crimes are too troubling for them . Arguedas says she is unsure whether she would ever represent an accused rapist who claimed the victim had consented . &quot; I do a really , heavy aggressive cross-examination , &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t want to do that on a woman by saying , ' Didn ' t you really want this ? ' &quot; For defense_lawyer Christie Warren , the test came when she defended child_molesters while she was pregnant . As her child moved inside her , she stood_in courtrooms and defended men accused of violating other children in ghastly ways . Homicide cases were easier for her . &quot; You just have a little more baggage to get beyond &quot; in rape and child molestation cases , said the assistant public_defender in Sacramento . Some defense_lawyers cannot stand the turmoil and pressure and switch to other areas of the law after a while . &quot; I was tired_of being treated as though I was a criminal , &quot; said Beskind , who abandoned his criminal practice in North Carolina several years ago . &quot; It was guilt by association. &quot; This guilt_by_association is widespread . Defense_attorneys say they are often accosted in social settings about what they do , and , in the more extreme cases , receive chilling threats from the public . Lawyer Danny Davis had to move five times while defending Raymond Buckey , who was accused of molesting scores of children at the McMartin Preschool in Manhattan Beach . Two of Davis ' homes were firebombed , and men attacked him physically in the parking_lot of the courthouse . &quot; I learned how to roll under my car , in my suit , &quot; he said . &quot; That is the best defense. &quot; Buckey was acquitted of 40 counts of molestation , and a mistrial was declared on eight counts . On a more benign level , attorney Dershowitz found himself castigated when he took_on the appeal of heavyweight champion Mike Tyson , who was convicted of rape in a trial Dershowitz believed was unfair . Female students at Harvard , where Dershowitz teaches , protested . Dershowitz contends that the female students allowed the rape itself to overshadow the tenet that everyone deserves a defense and a fair trial , that government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt an individual ' s guilt to protect the innocent from being wrongfully convicted . &quot; If even Harvard law_students don ' t understand the role of defense_attorneys , &quot; Dershowitz said , &quot; we have a very , very difficult mission. &quot;</TEXT>
