   <TEXT> Hutu militiamen abducted up_to 40 ethnic Tutsi children Tuesday from a church where they had sought shelter from Rwanda ' s civil_war , and the United Nations feared they would be massacred . Hours later , rebels announced the warring groups had reached a cease-fire . Brig . Gen . Henry Anyidoho , deputy commander of the U.N. force , said the children were taken from the Sainte Famille church , where about 3 # 000 Tutsis are awaiting U.N. evacuation . &quot; When they take them away , they usually kill them , &quot; Anyidoho said . Hutu militias have been blamed for most of the hundreds of thousands of deaths in the two-month war between Hutu government fighters and a rebel group made_up mostly of minority Tutsis . But in Tunisia on Tuesday night , there was hope the bloodshed might end when the warring factions reportedly agreed to an immediate cease-fire under pressure from the Organization of African Unity . If the cease-fire sticks -- and there are no guarantees it will -- it will allow several thousand U.N. peacekeeping troops to move_into Rwanda .</TEXT>
