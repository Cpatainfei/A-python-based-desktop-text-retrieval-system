   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; FISHING INDUSTRY : INSPECT THYSELF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The seafood industry , despite a checkered food safety record , is now being called_upon to police itself with minimal federal oversight under a controversial plan announced last week by the Clinton_Administration . The current , patchwork program -- sharply criticized as ineffective by critics -- will be replaced with a system that relies more on detailed company record keeping than on state-of-the-art government inspections . The U . S . Food and Drug Administration , responsible_for implementing the 500-page regulation , will usher_in the changes without any increase in its Office of Seafood ' s $ 42 million annual budget . The size of the fisheries industry -- including domestic and imported product -- dwarfs the federal inspection effort with annual sales of $ 35.2 billion in this country . Public doubts about seafood safety have resulted in a five-year decline in per-capita consumption of fish and shellfish in the U.S. since a record 16.2 pounds per person were consumed in 1987 . Trade reports indicate that consumption levels dropped to 14.8 pounds in 1992 , the last year for which figures are available . Even industry representatives acknowledge that consumer confidence in seafood needs to be &quot; re-established &quot; and applaud the government ' s proposed changes . Under the Clinton proposal , seafood companies must implement a system_called Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point within a year of the publication of final regulations , expected in April . HACCP , first developed in the 1960s , identifies the most important steps_in food processing and establishes strict sanitation guidelines for these particular plant operations . A company must then chart its own progress in meeting the guidelines . * Among the critical_points in commercial seafood are areas such_as storing , handling , cooking and packaging . For instance , records of where the fish were caught , plant cooking temperatures and freezer levels over extended periods must be maintained by the individual firms and be made available to federal inspectors on demand . The size of the government ' s task , regardless of the inspection system used , is daunting . There are an estimated 350 FDA inspectors to oversee 4 # 846 seafood processors , 1 # 571 repackers / warehouses and 924 importers . ( The Government Accounting Office , an arm of Congress , said in a 1991 food safety report that FDA did not know the location of all seafood plants in the country and thus could not accurately access the industry ' s sanitation record . FDA officials dispute the GAO claim. ) The disjointed nature of the seafood industry , ranging from mom-and-pop domestic operators to extensive fish imports from dozens of nations , has prompted the FDA to concentrate_on about 1 # 000 &quot; high-risk &quot; processors or those that prepare ready-to-eat seafood . However , the high-risk plants will receive only one inspection per year from FDA ; all others will be visited once every three years . The easiest way for consumers to understand the new seafood HACCP program is to compare the FDA plan with tactics used by the Internal Revenue Service . The IRS regularly publicizes the consequences -- fines , jail -- of tax cheating but , in reality , is hopelessly understaffed to verify each and every tax_return . As a result , the IRS targets its resources in specific income groups or where there has been a pattern of violations . Like the IRS , the FDA will require seafood companies to prepare detailed records of their sanitation performance but the agency will be hard pressed to visually inspect , or audit , any but the most likely violators once a year . Yet , the companies will be liable for criminal penalties if they have been found to violate the regulations . Most sides in the seafood safety debate acknowledge that the HACCP-oriented seafood program is a step_in the right direction . But some remain skeptical how the plan will be an improvement , considering that it requires no additional funding , places federal inspectors in processing plants only once a year , at best , and relies_on the seafood industry ' s integrity to maintain accurate records . * &quot; If we find something wrong ( in a seafood plant ) and then we find_out that a firm has been falsifying HACCP records then we will take appropriate action , &quot; said Thomas J . Billy , director of FDA ' s Office of Seafood . The question of the authenticity of the HACCP records will determine the program ' s credibility . The National Fisheries Institute , an Arlington , Va. , -based trade group , says the plan will improve the effectiveness of government inspections because of all_the additional data available . &quot; This is a tough , new program that places legally enforceable requirements on the ( seafood ) industry , &quot; said Lee J . Weddig , institute executive_vice_president . Others claim that all_the additional record keeping will become irrelevant if inspections are not frequent . &quot; The responsibility for making HACCP work is all on the seafood industry , &quot; said Caroline Smith DeWaal , with Public Voice for Food and Health Policy . &quot; This wonderful program is supposed to save us from bad fish but it doesn ' t have the inspection resources or the people or the enforcement authority to adequately get the job done. &quot; * Among the deficiencies , Smith DeWaal says FDA lacks the authority to recall or seize contaminated fish products from the marketplace and is unable to legally close plants operating in an unsanitary manner . Nor does the agency require prior federal licensing for companies that process or market seafood as a means of knowing who -- and how many firms -- are handling the highly perishable food . Further , there will be no dockside inspection of fishing vessels nor inspection of trucks that transport the food interstate , Smith DeWaal says . FDA officials are quick to state that implementation of HACCP is not an abdication of federal responsibility for seafood safety . &quot; I totally disagree ( with claims that FDA is lessening its role ) , &quot; said Billy . &quot; Even now the industry has the responsibility to insure the safety of its products ( under the provisions of the Federal Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act ) . What this HACCP proposal does is prescribe controls that we want to see in every aspect of their operation . . . This signifies further strengthening ( of inspection efforts ) . &quot; Billy said one independent check of the HACCP system will be the continuation of FDA ' s random_sampling of seafood at all stages of the food_chain in_order to independently determine whether there are contamination problems . As estimated 9 # 000 fish and shellfish samples will be taken annually . Yet , it has been during such inspections that FDA has found persistent problem with the performance of seafood companies . In a survey of 500 of the nation ' s seafood plants between 1991 and 1992 , FDA found that 16 % of those facilities surveyed &quot; had problems with general sanitation conditions in their processing areas. &quot; Typically , when violations are detected , the FDA will give the offending company written notice that the inspector has found a sanitation problem . Then the firm is given a choice to either correct the deficiency or challenge the finding , which can initiate a lengthy bureaucratic_procedure . If the violations present a serious public health_problem , the FDA can seek court intervention to force the company to comply , a cumbersome process . By comparison , the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture , which operates the meat and poultry inspection program , has the authority to simply close a plant operating under unsanitary conditions . And the USDA did temporarily close about 30 meat plants for serious violations last year in the aftermath of the outbreak of illnesses related to contaminated hamburger . Yet when a multi-state outbreak of gastroenteritis was linked to Louisiana oysters in November , the FDA could only issue an advisory that consumers should not eat the shellfish from the two implicated harvesting areas . And nothing in the new HACCP seafood inspection proposal will empower FDA to do anything more_than issue similar advisories in the future . Or go_to court .</TEXT>
