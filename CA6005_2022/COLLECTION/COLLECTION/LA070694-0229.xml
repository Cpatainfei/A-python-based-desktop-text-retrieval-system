   <TEXT> Debra Haffner , executive_director of Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States -- an advocacy organization and clearinghouse on human sexuality in New York -- says there are five criteria for a sexual_relationship between adults this summer , whether it ' s a one-night stand , a vacation fling or a marriage : 1 . The relationship should be consensual . 2 . It should be non-exploitative , meaning &quot; no one is using each other. &quot; 3 . It should be honest . The relationship should mean the same to both parties . &quot; Whether it ' s love or a one-night both partners should know and communicate that. &quot; 4 . It should be mutually pleasurable . 5 . Both parties should have the right to know about each other ' s sexual history . They should also practice safe_sex . That means using condoms and being protected against sexually transmitted diseases , AIDS and pregnancy . MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</TEXT>
