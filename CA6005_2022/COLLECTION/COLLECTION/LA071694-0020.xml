   <HEADLINE> JAPAN CALLS NORTH_KOREAN WEAPONRY DEVELOPMENT A THREAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Japanese government , in a defense white_paper approved Friday , for the first time called North_Korean weaponry development a grave threat to Japan . North_Korea , meantime , resumed its propaganda attacks on South_Korea . The flurry of charges interrupted a mourning period leading_up to the funeral of North_Korean President Kim Il Sung and underscored the continuing tensions in northeast Asia . The funeral , initially scheduled for Sunday , was postponed until Tuesday , according to an announcement today by official North_Korean media . The statement said the delay would allow more people to pay their respects . Japan ' s Cabinet approved the long-planned annual defense_policy paper a week after Kim died of a heart_attack and eight days before Socialist Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama is to visit Seoul . The report said North_Korea is believed to have acquired chemical and biological weapons and is suspected of developing nuclear bombs to go_along with a proven missile capacity . &quot; The situation on the Korean_peninsula has become a grave destabilizing factor for the security of East Asia , including Japan , &quot; the report said . It noted that in May , 1993 , North_Korea successfully test-fired a missile with a range of 620 miles , meaning the device would be capable of striking Osaka . Pyongyang also is believed to be working_on a longer-range version that could reach Tokyo and most of the rest of Japan . &quot; If the development of nuclear_weapons is matched by the development of missiles , this could pose a more dangerous situation , &quot; the white_paper said . Hirotsugu Ota , counselor at the Defense Agency in Tokyo , said Japan &quot; would have to consider measures in the future if North_Korea went_ahead with its missile development. &quot; He did not elaborate , but his statement apparently referred to the development of an anti-missile system . The United States has offered to work with Japan to produce weapons capable of shooting_down incoming missiles . Earlier this year , the Japanese government declared that Tokyo would not seek a nuclear arsenal of its own even if North_Korea developed nuclear_weapons . As for the resumed propaganda attacks by North_Korea on South_Korea , Pyongyang condemned Seoul for ordering a military alert immediately after the announcement last Saturday of Kim ' s death and for banning its citizens from offering condolences . It compared the alert order with &quot; rashly igniting a fire at a funeral home. &quot; &quot; Far from sharing sorrow at the unexpected misfortune on the threshold of North-South summit talks , the South_Korean authorities abused ( Kim ' s death ) politically and provoked their fellow countrymen ( in the North ) who have lost the leader of the nation , &quot; the North_Korean Central News_Agency commented . It said that South_Korean President Kim Young Sam , who had been scheduled to meet the North_Korean dictator July 25-27 in Pyongyang , &quot; cannot be called a human_being , still less a politician. &quot; On Monday , North_Korea notified the South that a first-ever North-South summit would have to be &quot; postponed. &quot; Its condemnation of Kim Young Sam was the first since the death of Kim Il Sung , who is expected to be succeeded by his 52-year-old son , Kim Jong Il . Meanwhile , Kim Young Sam and President Clinton agreed in a 20-minute telephone_conversation to continue tripartite U.S.-Korea-Japan consultations to deal with North_Korea ' s suspected development of nuclear_weapons and any changes in circumstances on the Korean_peninsula .</TEXT>
