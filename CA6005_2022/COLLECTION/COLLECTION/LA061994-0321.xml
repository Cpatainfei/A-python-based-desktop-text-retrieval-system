   <HEADLINE> CLINTON TO ANSWER JONES ' SUIT WITH HIGH-RISK LEGAL STRATEGY ; LAW : AN ELABORATE MOTION TO DISMISS SEEKS TO AVOID ANY DETAILED RESPONSE TO SEX HARASSMENT CHARGES . FAILURE COULD MEAN A HUMILIATING TRIAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In their rebuttal to the sexual_harassment charges filed by former Arkansas employee Paula Corbin Jones , President Clinton ' s attorneys intend to summon the support of some powerful historical allies : John Quincy Adams , Thomas_Jefferson and Richard Nixon . By invoking the names of these former presidents , each of whom helped to define the legal prerogatives of the presidency , the President and his advisers hope to persuade the courts to dramatically expand a long-observed principle that has shielded presidents from civil litigation while they are in the White_House . This high-risk legal maneuver will be the centerpiece of an elaborate motion for dismissal that the President plans to file with the court this week in response to Jones ' suit , according to Clinton ' s advisers . U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright , who coincidentally was a constitutional law_student of Clinton ' s at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville , is expected to rule on the issue shortly thereafter . If Clinton ' s legal strategy succeeds , he could be spared the embarrassment of responding in detail to Jones ' allegations that as governor of Arkansas he tried to entice her into a sexual liaison in a Little_Rock hotel_room in May , 1991 . In addition , he would succeed in charting a new legal prerogative for himself and all future presidents . But if it fails , his advisers concede , he almost certainly would be forced to endure a humiliating court trial that would focus national attention on his sexual habits . A ruling in Jones ' favor could also be a serious blow to the institution of the presidency , making_it more vulnerable to political attack through the judicial_system . By claiming presidential immunity from civil litigation , Clinton ' s legal advisers hope to persuade Wright to dismiss Jones ' suit without hearing any testimony on her sensational allegations . At minimum , if Wright agrees to hear arguments on the immunity issue before proceeding with the substance of the case , the dispute over presidential prerogatives could delay hearings on the complaint for months -- or years -- especially if both sides are inclined to carry their battle all_the way up_to the U.S. Supreme Court . During a 40-minute telephone conference_call last week between Wright and attorneys in the case , the judge gave Clinton ' s lead attorney , Robert S . Bennett , 10 days to file a memorandum supporting his request to handle the immunity issue first . Jones ' lawyers will then have another 10 days to respond to Bennett ' s argument . Meanwhile , Atty . Gen . Janet Reno has asked Solicitor_General Drew S . Days III and Acting Associate Atty . Gen . William C . Bryson to recommend how the Justice_Department should approach the sensitive issue of presidential immunity . It is likely the Justice_Department will file a brief supporting Clinton ' s claim of presidential immunity . In her vividly descriptive suit filed_in early May , Jones , a former $ 6.35-an-hour employee of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission , alleged that three years earlier Clinton lured her into a Little_Rock hotel_room and asked her to perform oral_sex . Clinton insists he has no recollection of meeting Jones , and his defenders are known to have witnesses who will testify that Jones did nothing more_than shake hands with the governor that day . As many lawyers see it , Jones ' sexual_harassment case is deficient in a number of respects . Not only did she file her suit after the statute of limitations had expired under the most pertinent laws , but she has not yet substantiated her claim that she suffered retribution in her job after refusing Clinton ' s alleged sexual overtures . Indeed , Jones acknowledged in an interview last week that she received several raises after the incident but insisted they were not comparable_to those awarded her peers . Complainants in sexual_harassment suits usually are required by the court to establish that they worked in a sexually hostile environment . Or they must establish a link between the harassment and their treatment on_the_job . Despite the apparent weaknesses of her complaint in that regard , however , sources said Clinton ' s advisers have told him that Wright is unlikely to dismiss the complaint simply on those grounds . And if the judge begins hearing testimony in the case , they have predicted , the President could be forced to present graphic evidence in court to disprove Jones ' contention that she saw &quot; distinguishing characteristics in Clinton ' s genital area &quot; -- much as music star Michael Jackson was forced to do_in response to a sexual abuse complaint filed against him by an unidentified boy . As a result , Clinton ' s advisers have concluded that a trial on the merits of the case must be avoided , even if they feel confident of a favorable outcome . That is the reason Clinton ' s lawyers are depending so heavily on their claim of presidential immunity to win dismissal before a trial . Under current law , there is no doubt that presidents are immune from any litigation relating to their official duties . The precedent was established in a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1982 involving a suit filed against Nixon by government whistle-blower Ernie Fitzgerald . But the ruling is silent on suits such_as Jones ' that deal with matters beyond the purview of a President ' s official duties . Herbert J . Miller Jr. , a veteran Washington attorney who argued Nixon vs . Fitzgerald on behalf of the late President , said the ruling does not provide a solid precedent for Clinton ' s situation . &quot; I don ' t think the Nixon case is a firm precedent for granting the present President immunity for pre-presidential conduct , &quot; Miller said in an interview . Jones ' attorneys , Gilbert K . Davis and Joseph Camaratta , said they will assert that the decision in Nixon vs . Fitzgerald has no bearing on their complaint because an encounter with Jones would be unrelated to his presidential duties . But those representing the President are prepared to argue that Jones ' suit would divert the President ' s attention from governing , just as the Fitzgerald complaint would have distracted Nixon had it been allowed to proceed . Quoting from Adams and Jefferson , the President ' s lawyers are certain to argue that the nature of the presidency requires the courts to reject such suits , sources said . Adams wrote that subjecting a President to lawsuits would violate the separation of powers by giving the courts authority over him . But Clinton ' s immunity against Jones ' suit should last only as long as he is President , his lawyers will argue . If Jones wants to refile it after he leaves the White_House , nothing should prevent it , in their view . Another citation likely to show_up in the President ' s legal_brief : the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act of 1940 , which protects servicemen from liability while they are acting in the line_of_duty . If such protection belongs_to a lowly soldier , Clinton ' s lawyers believe , it belongs_to the commander_in_chief as well . One of the central points that the President ' s lawyers are likely to raise has more to do with politics than law . They are certain to note that Jones was first introduced to the national press earlier this year at a news_conference staged by Clinton ' s conservative critics . If Jones is permitted to sue the President , one Clinton adviser mused , &quot; isn ' t this going_to be the next partisan tactic to be used in an era of partisan annihilation ? &quot;</TEXT>
