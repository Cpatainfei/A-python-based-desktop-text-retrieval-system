   <TEXT> The music began as we stepped off our bus in the adobe village of Wupu in northwestern China . Barely perceptible at first , a seductive whine gathered force as it welled_up in the throats of middle-aged men and reverberated from their long-necked stringed instruments and sheep-skin tambourines . Next came the dancers -- a troupe of little_girls , 6 or 8 years old , with winsome smiles , velvety brown eyes and shiny pigtails . Dressed in a blaze of mismatched patterns , bright leggings , clunky white tennis_shoes and embroidered square caps , or dopas , they repeated a mystifying litany of arm movements as they danced from the front of Wupu ' s City_Hall down a street lined three or four deep with villagers . The entire population of Wupu seemed to have turned_out to welcome us . Maybe there wasn ' t much else to do on Sunday in this remote bit of Chinese Turkestan . Maybe our international group of 50 art conservators , scientists and journalists looked as exotic to the citizens of Wupu as they appeared to us . Or maybe the Getty Conservation Institute ( GCI ) , which had organized our tour last fall of ancient cultural sites along the fabled Silk_Road , had pulled a_few strings to provide us with a heartwarming spectacle . All three possibilities turned_out to be true , but we wasted little time speculating . Instead , we did what all red-blooded tourists would do : whipped out our cameras and began snapping pictures . Everywhere we looked , there were friendly , open faces and photogenic costumes . Old_men with goatees wore long coats , heavy leather boots and embroidered dopas ; younger_men and boys had_on wide-billed caps and woolen sweaters ; women covered their heads with bright kerchiefs and their legs with thick brown cotton stockings , which , pulled over pantaloons , gave their legs a lumpy appearance ; young_girls turned_up in Western-style warm-up suits in red , fuchsia and turquoise . One by one , the dancers approached members of our party and bowed demurely , inviting us to join them . We lumbered into the center of the street , doing our best to emulate the graceful youngsters . We had arrived in Xinjiang ( shin-JAHNG ) , a vast area of western China that became a Chinese province in 1884 and was declared the Xinjiang-Uygur Autonomous Region in 1955 , making the area an independent state . And we had come face-to-face with the Uygurs ( oo-ee-GOORS ) , Turkic-speaking Muslims who constitute the largest ethnic minority in a region bordered by Mongolia , Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Afghanistan , Pakistan , India and Tibet . &quot; This is the Far West of the Far East , &quot; a friend mused , as we attempted to figure where Chinese Turkestan fit into our concept of geography . We had signed_up for a professional , six-day tour of cultural monuments along a northern segment of the Silk_Road , from Dunhuang to Urumqi ( oo-room-CHEE ) . But for the first time in a day and a half of bus travel -- through some of the most Godforsaken territory I had ever seen -- the journey promised rewards outside the bounds of scholarship . We would feast our curiosity on contemporary life as well as ancient wonders . The Silk_Road is the seductive modern name given to a network of trade_routes which , from the 3rd Century BC to the 14th Century AD , linked Xi ' an ( CHEE-AHN ) , the historic capital of China , with the Mediterranean . Many tours of the Silk_Road begin at Xi ' an . Our journey started at Dunhuang , where we had attended a conference on the conservation of the Mogao Grottoes , a spectacular complex of 492 caves filled with Buddhist art . Located on the southwestern edge of the Gobi_Desert , 1 # 200 miles west of Beijing , Dunhuang isn ' t exactly a garden spot , but it seemed comparatively lush as we left it behind and forged northwest into Xinjiang . The landscape soon deteriorated into a gray crust , sliced by a recently paved , two-lane highway used almost exclusively by overloaded trucks . Our first meal on_the_road -- box lunches of bread , water and a_few unidentifiable items -- was served near a highway truck_stop . Considering our options , we carried the boxes across the road , past a pig and a garbage_heap to the top of a dry hillock , where we chowed down and considered the view . Staring_down the bleak road and across the decidedly unpicturesque desert , we had reason to question our sanity for making the journey at all . Not that we weren ' t warned . &quot; This is not an easy trip , &quot; Sara Tucker , GCI ' s special projects coordinator , wrote in a memo to tour participants before departure . &quot; We hope that short presentations by lecturers will liven_up the journey on the long drives from Dunhuang to Hami and Hami to Turpan . The other difficulty is lack of facilities : There are no restrooms along the road , except behind sand_dunes . Our only option is men to one side of the road , women to the other. &quot; Tucker was right about the lack of amenities , but the trip was not difficult . Although I never encountered a completely functional modern toilet and I ate parts of animals that I hope never to encounter again -- chewy goat ' s head , crispy chickens ' feet , slimy camel ' s paw -- my most vivid memories of Xinjiang don ' t concern faulty plumbing . The Silk_Road I remember took me to ruins of ancient cities , an astonishing array of regional art , spectacular scenery and modern cities that appear more Turkish than Chinese . But little of this had been apparent on our first night in Hami . Although we had dined sumptuously and had boned_up on Xinjiang history -- with the help of our erudite guide , Jeffrey Riegel , chairman of the department of East Asian languages at UC Berkeley -- the city was dispiriting . Like the brand new Hami Hotel , where a glitzy lobby is a front for dirty , dysfunctional guest rooms , the city seemed to pride itself on shoddy new construction . Furthermore , we had been hit with a demand from the Hami police for $ 17 per person . Xinjiang was dangerous , we were informed , and the fee was necessary &quot; insurance. &quot; As far as we could tell , the charge was the cost of a police escort service that we neither needed nor wanted . ( Hami &quot; insurance &quot; was only one of several attempts by the Chinese to exact a little more along the way . As many travelers discover , prepaid travel packages in China do not always preclude the possibility of additional charges. ) But now , only an hour ' s drive from Hami , we were in a tranquil old adobe village with a spirit of generosity . Primitive as it is , Wupu is a model of architectural integrity , built to accommodate people who live_in a climate that ranges from well below zero to more_than 100 degrees Fahrenheit and gets less than an inch of rain each year . Throughout the region , water is channeled underground from mountains to lowland agricultural areas where fruits and vegetables are grown and later dried . In sharp contrast to high-rise apartment_buildings that are sprouting up around cities , traditional homes are one-story , thick-walled structures with underground storage_rooms for produce . After the dancing , a Wupu town official escorted us to lunch in a four-room adobe_house with a roof of poplar beams and reed , a walled courtyard in front and an arbor-covered patio in back . We washed our hands under an outdoor hose and passed_through a hallway into a living / dining / sleeping room , where we took_off our shoes and crawled up_on a brick platform that fills most of the room , serving as both a heated sleeping area and a dining place . An abundance of colorful fabrics lent the simple house -- the private home of a local family -- an air of opulence in keeping with the Silk_Road . Runners of printed fabric , laid_over richly patterned carpets , served as our tablecloth . Shelves set into the adobe walls were stuffed with bright quilts and pillows decorated with metallic stitchery . Feeling a bit like voyeurs in the world of Marco Polo , who traveled this way to the court of Kublai Khan in the 13th Century , we sat cross-legged on the floor and indulged in a feast : great rounds of naan , grapes and dates , followed by generous pots of mutton and potato stew , rice mixed with vegetables , beer and tea . After another round of entertainment by the same little dancers who had greeted us , we finally got_down to the business of visiting a nearby burial_ground . Excavations of Wupu ' s 3 # 000-year-old graves in 1978 and 1984 unearthed 50 corpses , along with clothing , pottery and utensils . ( Examples , including mummies , are displayed in a small museum that occupies three rooms on the second floor of the Hami Cultural Office. ) The children of Wupu bade us a noisy farewell as we boarded the bus back to Hami . On our approach to the city we stopped to see a complex of tombs built for kings who reigned over Hami from 1697 to 1930 . Mixing Islamic and Chinese design , the royal tombs are adjacent to the 300-year-old Great Mosque of Adker , where crowds gather on Islamic holy_days . After another night at the Hami Hotel , we set_off for Turpan , the most appealing of the three major cities we visited . Stretching_out over a large , flat area that lies below sea-level , it ' s a peaceful town of about 100 # 000 people where grape_arbors cover sidewalks and hand-painted billboards lend splashes of color to major thoroughfares . Ancient men in great coats mingle with women in dark dresses and heavy brown stockings in Turpan ' s marketplaces , while children in Western-style warm-up suits seem to come from another planet . Despite such evidence of change , the people live simply . Walking_around the city early one morning , I saw sleepy residents emerging from tiny mud-brick buildings that double as shops and living quarters . With little space inside , they brushed their teeth and ate their porridge outdoors , where they would later sell produce . Serving as a base for bus tours to several major ancient monuments and home to a regional museum , Turpan offers a satisfying mix of history and modern culture . Two monuments that bring archeologists and art conservators to Turpan are remains of 2 # 000-year-old adobe cities on the outskirts of town . In a wetter climate , the buildings would have long since disintegrated . But here , where rain is a rare occurrence and dust a constant challenge , large sections of the structures are intact . Jiaohe , the larger of the two ruined cities , was established during the Han dynasty ( 206 BC-AD 220 ) to protect the Silk_Road . At its peak in the 9th Century , it was home to more_than 6 # 000 people , but was abandoned during the 13th Century as a result of war , a lack of water or both . Most of the remains date_from the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) . About six miles west of Turpan , Jiaohe sits on a plateau formed by the juncture of two rivers . A mile-long stone path through the center of the city divided residential and commercial zones . Archeologists have found remains of Buddhist temples and courtyard dwellings , as well as artifacts that attest to the cultural richness of the deserted city . Wandering through the ruins is an eerie experience that evokes thoughts of ancient civilizations and profound awareness of the power of nature . While the foundations and walls inspire awe for the people who imposed an orderly structure on such a harsh land , erosion has chiseled many of the ruins into craggy spires that resemble natural rock formations . As the sinking sun cast dramatic shadows across my path and I walked alone in the ruins , I had no difficulty imagining a caravan laden with silks and spices arriving_at this historic citadel . The other ancient ghost_town , Gaochang , is about 30 miles southeast of Turpan . Also built as a Han dynasty garrison , the city was abandoned during the 16th Century . Although smaller and less well-preserved than Jiaohe , Gaochang was the capital of a region that included 21 other towns . Unlike Jiaohe , which was protected by steep river banks , Gaochang was fortified by walls . Nothing remains of the palace at Gaochang , but archeologists have found houses , temples and tombs , as well as Buddhist artworks , mosaic floors and manuscripts in seven languages . Neither Gaochang nor Jiaohe has an on-site museum , but artifacts from both cities can be seen in the Turpan Museum and the Xinjiang Museum in Urumqi . The same is true of Astana , a large burial_ground near Gaochang , where we went_by bus . Three of Astana ' s tombs are open_to the public , but visitors have to go_to the two museums to see a cache of Tang dynasty statuary , textiles and artifacts excavated there . Also near Turpan , in a breathtaking setting , is a complex of Buddhist caves known as the Bezekelik Grottoes , which we visited by bus . Situated in a valley near red sandstone hills ( known as the Flaming Mountains ) Bezekelik has all_the natural beauty a desert-weary traveler could desire . Majestic sand_dunes rise behind the caves , a river runs_through a lush oasis below them , and the air is refreshingly crisp . The man-made component of the site -- about 100 caves constructed of adobe_bricks and cut_into one side of a long , curving cliff -- is striking as well . Indeed , if most of the Buddhist wall_paintings that once filled these caves hadn ' t been removed by German archeologists and taken_to Berlin -- where about half of them were destroyed by bombs during World_War_II -- and if the remaining frescoes hadn ' t been defaced by Muslim zealots , Bezekelik would surely be a Mecca for art-loving travelers and scholars . Unlike the Mogao Grottoes -- which remain a magnificent cache of Buddhist art despite damage caused by the elements , pollution , vandals and losses to foreign museums -- Bezekelik ' s artistic glory can only be divined from photographs and in fragments of frescoes at the caves and in Berlin ' s Museum of Indian Art . Monks built the Bezekelik Grottoes between the 4th and the 14th centuries , while Buddhism was making its way from India to China along the same road that transported old Cathay ' s precious commodities to the West . Artists covered walls and ceilings of the caves with larger-than-life-size portraits of Buddhist monks , paintings of Buddha and an international assembly of devotees , and depictions of Indian gods . The caves were forgotten and filled with sand in 1905 when German adventurers Albert von Le Coq and Theodor Bartus found them . Clamoring around the monastery complex , the men started an avalanche of sand that revealed the paintings . &quot; Suddenly , as if by magic , I saw on the walls . . . splendid paintings in_colors as fresh as if the artist had only just finished them , &quot; Le Coq wrote_of his chance discovery . Le Coq , Bartus and their colleague Albert Grunwedel cut 620 frescoes out of the caves and transported them to Berlin , where they were installed in an ethnological museum . Like other explorers who have ripped great works_of_art out of their original context , the Germans may have believed they were saving the frescoes , but the transported works that couldn ' t be moved to safety during the war were lost . Destruction of the Bezekelik paintings may have been inevitable , however . After European explorers were thrown_out of China in the late 1920s , Muslims disfigured all_the images of gods and human_beings they could get their hands on . Depressed by thoughts of these cultural atrocities , we returned to Turpan and cheered ourselves up with the spectacle of its street life . The most energetic members of our group rented bicycles and rode around the city , while the rest of us visited the Emin Minaret ( a tapered brick tower built_in 1778 ) and strolled along arbor-covered sidewalks , past colorful shops and hand-painted billboards promoting local produce and Communist virtues . The largest slice of life on view in Turpan is the central market , which fills cavernous buildings and sprawls into surrounding outdoor areas . Sunday is said to be the big day , but we found no shortage of attractions on Monday and Tuesday . A staggering array of clothing , textiles , housewares , hardware and food -- is_on display . Being a far more dedicated observer than acquisitor , I wandered into side corridors and outer reaches , where I saw everything from the preparation of noodles to open-air shops for shoe and watch repair . A section of health-related products displayed medicines , herbs and hypodermic_needles . Nearby , a grubby shack offered dental services . How do I know ? By the big , hand-painted pictures of teeth posted outside . Unlike Dunhuang , where cheerfully aggressive street vendors had greeted us with a chorus of hellos every time we ventured into their territory , Xinjiang ' s merchants seemed to take little notice of foreigners until the latter showed an interest in making a purchase . The serious shoppers in our group bought carpets , silk scarves and jackets , cotton yardage , cashmere sweaters , donkey saddle bags and dopas during our trip . * Our final stop was Urumqi , the capital of Xinjiang . This bustling , traffic-snarled urban_center seems to be gripped by an urge to obliterate everything old and replace it with something new , big and ugly . Our temporary home , the Friendship Hotel , was not new , but it was big and ugly . Inconveniently located on the southern edge of town , the hotel had the look of a Communist retreat that had outlived its usefulness . In contrast , a towering new Holiday Inn in the center of town is an obvious symbol of capitalistic enterprise . The din and traffic_jams of Chinese jeeps and Russian and Japanese vehicles that greeted us in Urumqi were a shock , but urbanity has its rewards . One of them is the Xinjiang Museum , which has a 30 # 000-piece collection of regional artworks , artifacts and costumes , as well as cultural relics dating_back to the Stone_Age . We had already seen an impressive array of ceramic tomb figures and textiles from the Astana burial_ground at the Turpan Museum . The larger showcase at Urumqi displays even more treasures from Astana -- small figurines depicting ethnic minorities , statues of male acrobats , paintings of women playing chess and serving food and brocade footwear . The last_day of our journey took us to Heavenly Lake , a mountain retreat where Khazak people live_in yurts and offer tourists horseback rides and short boat trips . Colorful signs offered lodging_in a yurt , local dishes and pictures &quot; fine and cheap , &quot; but we contented ourselves with hikes and views of the alpine scenery . As we flew out of Urumqi the following morning , the desert swallowed_up all_the sights , sounds , smells , tastes and textures of Xinjiang . Chinese Turkestan was already a dream . Back in Beijing , after a dinner of pasta and red_wine in the squeaky-clean , Swiss-managed Movenpick Hotel , I felt as if I had never left home . But now , as I leaf through a small mountain of tour books , museum catalogues , notebooks and photographs , searching for ways to put an adventure into words , I remember Xinjiang . It ' s a little_girl inviting me to dance , women in kerchiefs and heavy brown stockings , goateed men in great coats . It ' s the haunting remains of Jiaohe , Gaochang and Bezekelik . It ' s the modern Asian crossroads that has replaced the historic Silk_Road .
