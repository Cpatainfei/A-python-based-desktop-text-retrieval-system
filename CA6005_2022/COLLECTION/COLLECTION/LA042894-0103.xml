   <HEADLINE> MEXICO CANDIDATE TAKES CAMPAIGN TRAIL TO L.A. ; ELECTION : CUAUHTEMOC CARDENAS , THE OPPOSITION PARTY ' S PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL , SAYS HIS NATION SHOULD ALLOW EXPATRIATES TO VOTE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In what was billed as a historic visit , Mexico ' s leading opposition candidate Wednesday brought his long-shot presidential campaign to Los Angeles , home to millions of expatriate Mexicans and U.S.-born residents of Mexican ancestry . With his Southern California audience in mind , Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party in presidential elections scheduled for Aug . 21 , denounced &quot; xenophobes and racists &quot; who foment hatred of Mexican immigrants , and called_for the Mexican government to seek bolstered protections for its citizens who live abroad . In addition , Cardenas reiterated his position that the Mexican Constitution should be revised to allow citizens living abroad to vote_in national elections , just as U.S. citizens residing overseas can cast absentee_ballots . Ruling-party lawmakers have blocked efforts to permit such a potentially huge number of expatriates to influence the Mexican electoral process . Observers said the visit of Cardenas , son of a revered former Mexican president , marked the first time that a Mexican presidential hopeful had traveled abroad during the formal campaign period . Mexican lawmakers last year revised a statute that had long prohibited presidential aspirants from leaving the country during campaigns . Cardenas came_to Los Angeles not to campaign , aides said , but in response to an invitation from the Los Angeles World Affairs Council , a nonpartisan citizens group . In comments Wednesday , Cardenas generally stressed familiar themes , calling_for true democracy in a nation ruled since 1929 by the Institutional Revolutionary Party , known as the PRI . &quot; We are demanding an opening to democracy , &quot; Cardenas told a morning news_conference at the Biltmore , where he later gave a formal address before meeting with Mexican residents at an auditorium near Downtown . &quot; We want to put an end to the party-state regime. &quot; Cardenas went one step further , though , calling_on Mexico_City to request that the United Nations send a formal contingent of observers to monitor the elections in August . Amid pressure for reform , Mexican authorities recently amended the law to allow some independent electoral observers in a nation where ballot stuffing , repeat voting and other chicanery have traditionally marred election_days . Many supporters still believe that Cardenas himself was robbed of the presidency in the 1988 elections . Official tallies gave Cardenas almost one-third of the votes , leaving him second to Carlos Salinas de Gortari . Salinas won a bare majority , announced after an eleventh-hour computer breakdown delayed counting . Cardenas ' visit to Los Angeles -- at least the fourth trip he has made here since the 1988 elections , supporters say -- underscores the increasing importance that Mexico ' s ever-growing expatriate population has_on events back home . Both opposition and ruling-party leaders have endeavored to extend their popularity to compatriots north of the border , knowing that such moves may pay political dividends in Mexico , where visits such_as Cardenas ' trip tend to be heavily publicized . &quot; There ' s a very high sensitivity in Mexico to the exploitation of the migrant worker , and to the extent that he ( Cardenas ) can associate himself positively with that issue , it can only gain him support , &quot; said Wayne A . Cornelius , who directs the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego . Cardenas has also been eager to shore_up his reputation among U.S. and Mexican business_leaders , many of whom are suspicious of his leftist leanings . &quot; We need foreign investment , &quot; Cardenas pointedly told a Los Angeles World Affairs Council luncheon . * Although Cardenas opposed the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , he vowed Wednesday that , if elected president , he would enforce the accord , in_effect since Jan . 1 . Although he now heads Mexico ' s leading opposition force , Cardenas , 59 , was long a PRI loyalist and served as governor of the state of Michoacan under the party ' s tricolor banner . He broke_with the PRI before the 1988 elections , however , after launching a movement that he said was intended to bring greater democracy to Mexico . Polls show Cardenas trailing substantially behind Ernesto Zedillo , who was named the PRI standard-bearer after the assassination last month of Luis Donaldo Colosio in Tijuana . But Cardenas has gained somewhat since Jan . 1 , when rebels in the southern state of Chiapas launched an insurrection that has galvanized opposition nationwide to what critics -- including Cardenas -- call the ruling party ' s economic program of concentrating wealth at the expense of the poor and middle_classes . A strong pro-Cardenas network has arisen in Los Angeles . Supporters were predictably thrilled about his visit . &quot; Cardenas is the man to change Mexico , &quot; declared an exuberant Jesus Cardenas , who runs an Eastside tortilla factory . Disputing that viewpoint was Ruben Arenas , president of a Los Angeles-based group that supports the PRI . &quot; Cardenas is just trying to get publicity for himself here , &quot; said Arenas , a businessman . &quot; He ' s wasting his time. &quot;</TEXT>
