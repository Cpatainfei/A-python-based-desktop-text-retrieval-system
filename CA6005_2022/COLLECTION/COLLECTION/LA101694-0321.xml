   <HEADLINE> PORT OF ORANGE COUNTY ; FIRST-EVER DETAILED EXAMINATION OF SCOPE AND TONNAGE OF THE CARGO MOVED BY LOCAL IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS OFFERS OVERVIEW OF FOREIGN TRADE AND IMPACT ON ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cotton isn ' t grown in Orange County , but about 2 # 000 metric_tons of the fluffy white stuff -- packed in bulging , 600-pound burlap-wrapped bales -- was shipped overseas last year by a Santa Ana exporter from the ports of Los Angeles and Long_Beach . The cotton shipped by R.W. Zebrowski Inc. came mostly from mills in central California , Texas and Oklahoma -- the nation ' s major cotton-growing regions . But like most export brokers , Zebrowski does business all_over the world , buying products at the source and having them moved by truck or train to the most convenient seaport for shipment to buyers overseas . When a seller is in Orange County and its buyer is in Japan , China or anywhere along the Pacific Rim , it likely means the goods_will travel through the Long_Beach or Los Angeles ports . In the past , the size of the county ' s export-import business has been a matter of educated guesswork by local economists . But trade analysts at the ports of Long_Beach and Los Angeles recently prepared_for the Times Orange County Edition a first-ever look_at the scope of the cargo that exporters and importers load each year onto the decks of the S.S. Orange County . The analysts ' numbers for the first_half of 1994 show a nearly 8 % increase in ocean cargo exports by Orange County-based shippers as well as a 15 % hike in imports being sent to Orange County companies . That could add 2 # 000 more jobs to local payrolls and boost the economy by about $ 500 million , said Esmael Adibi , director of the Chapman University Center for Economic Research . * Examining the county ' s entire volume of exports and imports is clouded by the lack of information about goods shipped by air and truck -- the shipments are not tracked by city or county of origin , as are goods moved by ship . But the U.S. Customs Bureau estimates that 75 % of all export and import goods -- by weight -- comes_through the nation ' s seaports , so a review of Orange County ' s use of the ports of Los Angeles and Long_Beach is indicative_of the county ' s foreign trade . Orange County ' s own harbors are given over to a military base and several marinas , but having two of the nation ' s largest commercial seaports less than 30 miles away has helped bring a large and growing number of export-import companies here : companies like 19-year-old R.W. Zebrowski and the recently opened national headquarters of Japanese electronics giant Hitachi Corp. ' s U.S. transportation and distribution subsidiary . &quot; Orange County is a major distribution center for importers and exporters alike , and it is because the county is near the two ports , &quot; said Adibi , an economics professor at the private university in Orange . The adjacent ports , which stretch in an arc from Long_Beach to San Pedro , handle the majority of Orange County ' s export and import goods . Ocean transport is far less expensive than air freight and many products are too bulky to go any other way : cars , business machinery , heavy construction equipment and scrap steel and paper are among Orange County ' s leading exports . A recent export shipment by Fluidmaster Inc. , the Anaheim plumbing repair parts maker , illustrates the case for ocean cargo when time is not a factor . &quot; We just pulled a 20-foot container off the dock and sent it by air instead , at the customer ' s request , &quot; said Fluidmaster ' s international trade director , Tricia Murdock . The Australian customer wanted the material sooner than the five weeks it would have taken_to get_it there by freighter . By air , it took four days from the time the container left Anaheim until it cleared customs in Australia . But the customer paid dearly . The approximately four-ton shipment would have cost $ 3 # 500 to send by sea . The air freight bill was $ 15 # 007 , Murdock said . Anil Puri , Cal State Fullerton ' s dean of economics , said the business of exporting represents 9.6 % of Orange County ' s gross annual production and is responsible_for about 10 % of the jobs in the county . For 1994 , that would equal $ 7 billion and 112 # 000 jobs . * There are two principal reasons for the increase , economists and trade specialists say . Because of its location , Orange County is a principal distribution point for goods being shipped out and brought_in by companies throughout the nation , and the U.S. import-export industry has grown as most states participate in a mild recovery from the recession that began in 1990 . More important , said export consultant Marilyn Loewy , Orange County businesses have become more aggressive in their overseas marketing to make_up for domestic sales lost in the recession . In 1993 , companies in Orange County shipped almost 400 # 000 metric_tons of goods from the two ports and imported about 500 # 000 tons . That places the county just slightly above the midway mark in a list of 18 regions that use the two ports : at just under 2 % of the total tonnage shipped through the ports , Orange County ' s businesses are a bigger user than all_of the companies in Mexico or Washington state , for instance . But local firms ship fewer goods through the Los Angeles and Long_Beach ports than the combined businesses of the nine New England and Mid-Atlantic states , which use the two ports as their outlets to the Pacific . The bulkiest and heaviest cargoes_shipped by Orange County businesses are scrap-paper and metal -- destined for recyclers in Japan , Korea , Taiwan and China . Last year , brokers such_as Global Fibers in La Palma and Yao Yang Enterprises in Los Alamitos shipped nearly 175 # 000 metric_tons of paper to customers in Asia . In the first_half of 1994 , an additional 122 # 000 metric_tons were shipped . ( Shipments are weighed in metric_tons -- 2 # 204.6 pounds versus 2 # 000 pounds for a standard U.S. ton -- because most of the world uses the metric system. ) * Like Zebrowski ' s cotton , most of the paper and a lot of the produce , scrap metal and consumer goods shipped by Orange County companies originated_in other parts of California or in other states and was transported directly to the ports without ever entering Orange County . It is credited to the county as an export because that ' s where the shipper is based . Chemicals are the second largest of the county ' s export cargoes by weight -- more_than 100 # 000 metric_tons in the 18 months ended June 30 . In third place is fresh fruit -- 45 # 000 metric_tons . Export cargo tonnage drops rapidly after that , though in many cases the value of the cargoes -- everything from hides and fabrics to resins and auto parts -- goes way up : the 5 # 245 tons of electronic machinery , scientific_instruments and other electronic_equipment shipped to foreign buyers by Orange County companies in 1993 and the first_half of 1994 had a cumulative worth well in excess of the value of the 175 # 000 tons of paper , trade analysts said . So did the 3 # 000 tons of computers and other office equipment . The value of specific cargoes is not released for competitive reasons . But the trade office of the Port of Los Angeles , which has handled about 45 % of the tonnage shipped in and out of Orange County in the last six months , said the value of all exports from Orange County-based businesses from January through June was $ 3.7 billion while the value of_imports destined for companies in the county was $ 2.9 billion -- an aggregate of $ 6.6 billion for one port for half a year . At first glance , the list of Orange County ' s exports and imports makes the area look_like an underdeveloped region -- more raw_material and agricultural products than finished goods are exported and far more high_technology and consumer products are imported than shipped out . Imports also outweigh exports by nearly 30 % . &quot; The imbalance between imports and exports is a problem and the whole country faces it , &quot; said Eugene J . Milosh , president of New York-based American Assn . of Exporters &amp; Importers . &quot; But we have to trade goods where we have an economic advantage . That means we ship a lot of chemicals and forest products , because we have more_than most other countries . &quot; And we ship a lot of scrap metal and paper because we produce and consume so many_more finished products than most other countries that we produce a lot more waste. &quot; In addition to being an attractive place for brokers and freight forwarders like Zebrowski and Burlington Northern in Irvine to set_up shop , the nearby ports have helped Orange County manufacturers , including computer maker AST Research Inc. and scientific equipment maker Beckman Instruments Inc. , achieve significant growth through foreign trade . &quot; We also have the U.S. headquarters of big companies like Hyundai and Toshiba and Mitsubishi , &quot; which has both automobile and electronics subsidiaries in Orange County , &quot; and they ' re not here just for the weather , &quot; said Adibi , the Chapman University economist . * Hitachi Transport System America Inc. , in fact , held an open_house earlier this month to show_off the 340 # 000-square-foot warehouse complex it opened in Anaheim in August to handle goods that Hitachi ships to the United States -- most of it arriving_at the Port of Los Angeles . There are 110 employees there and in just two months in business they have distributed $ 55 million worth of consumer and commercial products ranging from sophisticated surgical equipment and medical_instruments to televisions and video players through Anaheim to Hitachi sales facilities throughout the nation . By contrast , R.W. Zebrowski has only five employees , including Hans J . Holste , the company ' s president and buying agent , and majority owner Hilla Zebrowski -- whose late husband , Rolf , founded the business 19 years ago . Though small , Zebrowski ships about $ 50 million worth of cotton linters -- a type of short cotton stubble recovered when cotton seed is processed for its oil -- to customers throughout Europe and Asia . A lot of it goes_through the ports of Long_Beach and Los Angeles . A week ago , the company sent 1 # 000 metric_tons of linters to China via the Port of Long_Beach . This cotton byproduct is used to produce high-quality cellulose for explosives , food processing , plastics and paper-making . It was Zebrowski ' s first deal with the Chinese and one of the first shipments of foreign-produced cotton linters into that nation in the wake of a dramatic fall-off in Chinese cotton production last year . * As different as they are , the American cotton shipper and Japanese-owned electronics_company illustrate Orange County ' s import-export industry and its reliance on the neighboring seaports . Foreign trade is important to entrepreneurial Orange County , where most companies are small : It rewards drive and initiative as well as size and financial muscle . And for several years it has been one of the only growth areas in an otherwise sluggish economy . &quot; We had 10 % to 15 % growth in the business in each of the last two years even though the economy has been down , &quot; said Don Miller , president of the World Trade Center Assn . of Orange County . &quot; And we expect that growth again this year. &quot; Without the ports , however , the growth would not be as significant or constant , he said . Port of Orange County In 1993 , Orange County companies shipped almost 400 # 000 metric_tons of goods from the ports of Los Angeles and Long_Beach . Imports totaled about 500 # 000 tons . One metric_ton equals 2 # 204.6 pounds . Orange County ' s share amounts to about 2 % of the tonnage shipped into and out of the ports .

JONES / Los Angeles Times What We Give and Get Orange County exports through the two ports are dominated by two commodities -- paper products and chemicals ; imports are more balanced . Paper products and foodstuffs are the only two products that appear near the top of both export and import lists . Top commodities in metric_tons : EXPORTS Paper products : 163 # 026 Chemicals : 86 # 639 Fruits : 30 # 807 Paper ( including waste ) : 11 # 538 Foodstuffs : 10 # 325 IMPORTS Building_materials : 46 # 113 Automobiles : 39 # 516 Paper products : 31 # 238 Office equipment : 29 # 696 Foodstuffs : 29 # 072 Sources : Ports of Los Angeles and Long_Beach ; Researched by JOHN O ' DELL / Los Angeles Times * TRADING PLACES : Growing need by smaller companies helps trade brokers proliferate .
