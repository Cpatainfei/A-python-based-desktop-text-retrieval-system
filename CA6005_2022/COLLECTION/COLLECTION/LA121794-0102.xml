   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; JOBLESS RATE CONTINUES TO FALL IN ORANGE COUNTY ; EMPLOYMENT : NOVEMBER ' S 4.8 % IS THE LOWEST SINCE 1991 . FISCAL CRISIS HAS NOT YET HAD IMPACT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County ' s unemployment_rate for November fell to 4.8 % , the lowest level for the key economic indicator since December , 1991 , and substantially below the statewide average of 7.5 % last month . And despite the staggering investment losses disclosed by Orange County officials earlier this month , the jobs picture is not likely to change significantly in coming months , economists said . &quot; There will be some layoffs . . . but we expect the main impact on government will be to stop new hiring , &quot; said Esmael Adibi , director of the Center for Economic Research at Chapman University in Orange . &quot; Nothing much should show_up until early next year &quot; in unemployment statistics , he said . Adibi predicted Orange County ' s unemployment_rate will decline for this month , too , as merchants make last-minute holiday hires . Much of the employment improvement since October , when the county ' s jobless rate was 5.1 % , came from retailers hiring help for the holiday shopping season . But a separate tally of employment at businesses in Orange County showed a substantial number of permanent jobs added_to local payrolls since November , 1993 , when the jobless rate hit a nine-year high of 7 % . Orange County ' s jobless rate last month was the second lowest in the state , trailing only the 4.1 % figure reported for Marin and San Mateo counties in Northern California .</TEXT>
