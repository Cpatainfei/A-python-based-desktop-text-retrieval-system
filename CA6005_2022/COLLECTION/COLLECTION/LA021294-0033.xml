   <HEADLINE> HOWARD TEMIN ; WON NOBEL PRIZE FOR RESEARCH ON GENETICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nobel Prize_winner Howard Temin , a cancer researcher who helped change the way scientists look_at genetics and became a tireless opponent of smoking , has died of lung_cancer at age 59 . Temin , a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who specialized in cancer and AIDS research , made a brief public announcement in 1992 to discuss his illness and to note that he had never been a cigarette_smoker . Temin , who spent many of his final years campaigning against smoking , died Wednesday of adenocarcinoma , a form of cancer that is not caused by smoking . He won the Nobel Prize for physiology in 1975 when he was honored with his Caltech professor , Renato Dulbecco , and David Baltimore of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for their research on possible links between viruses and cancer . Temin also received the National Medal of Science in 1992 . Temin ' s work in helping discover the enzyme reverse_transcriptase led to acceptance of his theory that some genetic reproduction is the reverse of what scientists had thought . Temin said some viruses carry their genetic information in ribonucleic_acid , or RNA , which is then copied into the viruses ' deoxyribonucleic_acid , or DNA . The theory challenged the belief that DNA always passed information to RNA , rather than the other way around . But the discovery of the reverse_transcriptase enzyme proved his theory was right . The enzyme also played a key role in identifying the AIDS virus and has been crucial to genetic_engineering , which has produced such drugs as human insulin and tpa , a clot-dissolving substance that can stop heart_attacks . Temin joined the University of Wisconsin-Madison staff in 1960 . The Philadelphia native began his career with the study of chickens and how viruses affect them . From those studies , he learned that some genetic reproduction is the reverse of what scientists had thought normal .</TEXT>
