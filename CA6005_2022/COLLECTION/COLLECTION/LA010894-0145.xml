   <TEXT> They feared the threat of atomic war , of hostile superpowers firing nuclear missiles over the horizon , forever changing the lives of innocent civilians . But they never expected the radiation to come from their own government . For the Inupiat of northwest Alaska , it came from the caribou , who got_it from the lichen , which absorbed it from the radioactive debris scattered across the tundra by scientists . For a group of cancer patients in Cincinnati -- mostly poor , mostly black -- it came_in the form of &quot; treatments &quot; administered by an eminent researcher in radiation . For children at the Fernald School for the Mentally Retarded , it came_along with their breakfast cereal , served_up by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . From Alaska to Boston , one of the Cold_War ' s most chilling legacies is finally coming_to_light , dragged into the open by the very agency that zealously safeguarded the nation ' s nuclear secrets for decades . At the direction of Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary , her department has vowed to &quot; come clean &quot; on the human radiation experiments conducted under the sponsorship of the federal_government over nearly three decades . Beyond the shocking crudeness of some of the experiments lies another injustice : The subjects of the government ' s secretive studies were not just guinea_pigs in a series of potentially lethal experiments . Many were drawn from the ranks of society ' s dispossessed , either by virtue of their race , age , income or intelligence . In a sense , some were victims twice over : Already socially disadvantaged , they were used by a government and medical establishment that appeared to value science and prestige and military supremacy more highly than the rights of individuals on the fringes of society . The picture that is emerging is one that , as a government scientist familiar_with the testing put it in 1950 , &quot; has a little of the Buchenwald touch &quot; -- a reference_to the Nazi concentration_camp in which grotesque experiments were conducted on prisoners . From 1945 until the mid-1970s -- years of concern about the Soviet_Union ' s military intentions -- the federal_government underwrote a number of experiments that involved exposing human subjects_to highly radioactive substances . In several experiments , scientists injected toxic plutonium into gravely injured hospital patients . In another , they exposed indigent cancer patients to whole-body radiation 10 times more powerful than that recommended as treatment for leukemia . They dangled prison inmates ' testicles in irradiated water , and served poor pregnant women a drink containing radioactive iron filings . Although the research proceeded independently at different times and in different places , all_of it ultimately was financed with tax dollars . As the government and the scientific community scour files for evidence of such experiments , they are confronting ethical issues as old as the Hippocratic oath and as recent as the Nuremberg Code of 1947 , which articulated international standards of informed consent . So far , O ' Leary has discussed details of only one of the experiments . Others have come_to_light as a result of congressional hearings or independent investigations . Altogether , information involving more_than 30 experiments has been disclosed , and government officials acknowledge that many_more are likely to be unearthed . Of those cases for which specific information is available , roughly a dozen involve subjects drawn from the ranks of the disadvantaged . Ruth Faden , a medical ethicist at Baltimore ' s Johns Hopkins University who will chair the review panel created by O ' Leary , said &quot; it would not be surprising &quot; if the full body of experiments was to show a significant pattern of abuse of vulnerable and dispossessed people . &quot; There is a pattern already existing &quot; of such abuses in experiments outside of the area of radiation studies , she noted . In fairness , most of the experiments were conducted at a time when far less was known about the long-term hazards of radiation exposure , and they are being judged by far more sophisticated standards than were available to scientists at the time . Even so , the revelations raise disturbing questions about the subjects chosen . Did the researchers understand that some of their experiments might be ethically questionable ? Some of the principals have defended the studies as reasonable and necessary in light of the apparent threat of nuclear warfare . Today ' s critics say the choice of subjects suggests scientists knew even then that their research might not stand_up to public scrutiny . &quot; The best evidence , &quot; said Stanley Chesley , an attorney involved in several radiation compensation cases , &quot; is that they were doing_it to poor and black people . You didn ' t see them doing_it at the Mayo Clinic. &quot; Did they know their experiments might harm their subjects ? A 1963 memorandum obtained by The Times suggests that in at least one case , scientists strongly suspected that it would . Neatly hand-printed at the bottom of a proposal to irradiate the testicles of some Northwest prison inmates are the words of Dr. Charles W . Edington , a radiological expert who later participated in the study : &quot; I ' m for support at the requested level , as long as we are not liable . I worry about possible carcinogenic effects of such treatments. &quot; Were prospective subjects made to understand the known or likely effects of the proposed procedures ? And if so , did they have a realistic option of declining ? In several cases , the answer clearly appears to be no . Faden said the independent panel established by O ' Leary will focus_on the standards used in choosing subjects and on the extent of informed consent by participants . In examining those issues , Faden said , members will consider whether Cold_War anxiety -- the sense of military urgency that clearly prompted support for many studies -- is a valid excuse for any abuses that occurred . In the view of some medical ethicists , that question already has been answered . &quot; We heard that defense , and heard it loudly at the Nuremberg trials , and we rejected it , &quot; said Arthur Caplan , author of &quot; When Medicine Went Mad : Bioethics and the Holocaust. &quot; &quot; It just won ' t wash to invoke it now . In fact , I find it an even less persuasive defense now , because these people didn ' t experiment on themselves or their families . They said , ' Let ' s round_up the insane , the inane , the disabled , debilitated and vulnerable , and experiment on them. ' They rounded them up and put them on the altar of the Cold_War , &quot; he said . Among the experiments already documented by congressional studies and independent investigators , a_few follow the tradition of scientists experimenting on themselves , their colleagues and even their loved ones : In one study at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico , 57 consenting adults -- including the wife of the principal_investigator -- were fed tiny spheres of radioactive material to see how quickly it would pass_through their intestinal tracts . But as investigators comb the scattered records of government-sponsored experiments , they may find a disproportionate number of anonymous subjects who were disadvantaged . Among them were pregnant women who sought free health_care at the Vanderbilt University Medical_Center in Tennessee . In 1945 and 1946 , doctors at Vanderbilt gave 751 women in the later stages of pregnancy a radioactive tonic to see how they would metabolize radioactivity and to determine safe levels of radiation exposure . The doses -- 30 times higher than normal environmental radiation -- were not considered safe at the time . For five years starting in 1961 , researchers at MIT injected 20 subjects , ages 63 to 83 , with radioactive Radium-224 and Thorium-234 . The subjects , drawn from the Age Center of New England , had volunteered to participate in &quot; a variety of research projects on aging , &quot; according to a 1986 report . At the same time the search for victims takes investigators to the edges of American society , it is taking them to the pinnacles of medicine and academia . &quot; The most important field of investigation today is that of attempting to understand and mitigate the possible effects of nuclear warfare upon human_beings , &quot; Eugene Saenger , the University of Cincinnati radiologist who conducted whole-body radiation experiments on low-income subjects , told an interviewer in 1970 . &quot; I ' m a person who takes the defense of our country very seriously , &quot; Saenger was quoted as saying in &quot; The Great American Bomb Machine , &quot; a book by Roger Rapoport . &quot; I think it is important to find_out the kind of things we are learning in this study. &quot; &quot; Why didn ' t they put their bodies where their patriotism was instead of applying for grants from the Atomic Energy Commission ? &quot; asked Arjun Makhijani , president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research , a watchdog group . &quot; This whole_thing was about power and money . that ' s why it was easy to use subjects who were disempowered. &quot; Officials believe the government ' s far-flung program of radiation experimentation , often involving unwilling or unwitting subjects , may have left an indelible mark on the lives of about 800 people and their families . And those numbers could swell as the Energy_Department combs through about 32 million pages of information -- a stack of documents three miles high -- related to the nuclear_weapon and energy program . Over the next several months , the search will take federal investigators into prisons -- considered by medical ethicists today to be one of the most questionable venues for medical experiments . It will reach_into nursing_homes and schools for the mentally disabled , into busy city hospitals where the nation ' s poor are treated without charge , and into Native_American communities scattered throughout Alaska and the West . Some of the experimental subjects -- like a group of comatose brain cancer victims injected with uranium -- were critically ill at the time that doctors proposed untested radiation treatments on them . Others , like the Inupiat of northwest Alaska , were so perfectly adapted to their frigid environment that scientists were interested in determining whether white soldiers could handle the cold as well as the Inupiat . Still others belong_to groups placed under the extended guardianship of the government , making_it much easier to monitor the results of experimentation over an extended period . &quot; We feel_like we were used as guinea_pigs , &quot; said Ray Koonuk , an Inupiat from Point Hope , near where scientists in 1962 seeded the tundra with as much as 10 curies of radioactive debris . In the Three Mile Island nuclear_reactor accident of 1979 , by comparison , approximately 15 curies of radioactive material far less toxic than that apparently used in Alaska was said to have been released into the environment . &quot; I guess we just didn ' t have very much knowledge of what was going_on in the outside world , what kind of chemicals were in the bombs . We feel taken_advantage of , &quot; Koonuk said . Like other subsistence hunters in the Point Hope area , Koonuk hunted and gathered bird eggs in the unmarked experimental area with his grandfather , who is dying of cancer , and with a friend who died of cancer at 36 . After the issue was raised last spring by Alaskan lawmakers , the Clinton_Administration promised to investigate . &quot; People are just frustrated and scared , asking , ' Am I next ? ' &quot; said Koonuk . &quot; There ' s no trust any more in the government. &quot; Indeed , since the revelations began emerging in early December , the sense of fear and distrust seems to have spread as insidiously as radioactive fallout after a nuclear blast . The Energy_Department ' s switchboards have been jammed with about 10 # 000 calls per day . Many of the calls are from people who probably received standard medical radiation treatments in recent decades but fear they may have been subjects of additional tests without their knowledge . Their suspicions are understandable : At the time the experiments were conducted , many subjects were told little or nothing about the scientific objectives and possible effects . At the University of Cincinnati , many terminally ill subjects in one experiment were told that an experimental dose of full-body radiation was part of their &quot; treatment. &quot; Since patients in the study had a median IQ of 87 , it is unclear whether further explanation of the study ' s risks -- if any -- would have satisfied modern-day standards of informed consent . An IQ of 100 is considered to be average . In a 1946-47 study conducted at the University of Rochester in New York , six patients were injected with increasing doses of a radioactive concoction in an effort to determine what levels of radiation would damage the kidneys . One patient was homeless and consequently &quot; agreed willingly to enter the metabolic unit for special studies , &quot; according to study reports . And three subjects were alcoholics -- one of whom was admitted to the study while in a &quot; hallucinatory state. &quot; Most subjects received little or no recompense for their participation : In 1957 , the Eskimos and Athabascans of northern Alaska -- few of whom even spoke English at the time -- received an apple and an orange for allowing Army doctors to inject radioactive Iodine-131 into them . For a decade starting in 1963 , 131 state prisoners in Washington and Oregon penitentiaries were paid $ 5 per month to allow scientists to irradiate their genitals . The bizarre experiment was designed to gauge what levels of radiation exposure soldiers , astronauts and nuclear production workers could tolerate without reproductive side_effects . James Daughterty , a prisoner who participated in the experiments , told a researcher in 1980 that the money &quot; meant an awful lot at the time , &quot; when , without income , he had no cigarettes and none of &quot; the little necessities. &quot; &quot; You hate to be without toothpaste or anything , &quot; Daughterty told researcher Arnold Levinson , whose notes are_on file at the Center for Investigative Journalism in San Francisco . Three decades later , the Clinton_Administration is considering the possibility of providing compensation to some of the victims -- at levels far above the cost of toothpaste and cigarettes . Experts warn that a comprehensive program of compensation for experiment victims could involve payments of hundreds of millions of dollars , increase cynicism toward the government and open a Pandora ' s box of demands from those who feel they are victims of the Cold_War . But Administration officials insist the issue could be a political boon -- a sure-fire way to expose the wrongs of past administrations and a dramatic demonstration of President Clinton ' s &quot; putting people first &quot; philosophy . Moreover , Energy_Secretary O ' Leary has said that without a massive effort to flush out such nuclear secrets , there will be no redemption for the government -- or her department -- in the jaded eyes of American citizens . &quot; We have got_to restore the ability of the government to do_good things , &quot; said Dr. Tara O ' Toole , the assistant energy_secretary for environment , safety and health who is overseeing the review of the experiments . &quot; That means trust , and that means we have to be honest and tell the truth about what happened , &quot; O ' Toole said . &quot; We are not under any illusion that this will be easy or pleasant , but I don ' t see any alternative . This is the right thing to do. &quot;</TEXT>
