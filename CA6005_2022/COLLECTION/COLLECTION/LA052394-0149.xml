   <HEADLINE> LAX SCRUTINY FOSTERS FRAUD IN TRUST_DEEDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If anyone were watching , the First Pension Corp . disaster might have been headed_off as long ago as Aug . 12 , 1987 . On that day the firm ' s owners filed notices with a California agency claiming that each of 23 virtually identical real_estate investment pools was exempt from regulation as a public_securities offering because it was not to be offered to more_than 35 sophisticated investors . To any attentive regulator such a flurry of exemption claims would have suggested that the promoters were trying to evade the normally strict rules of disclosure for public_securities offerings . But no one was watching . The exemption notices were stamped by a department clerk and filed . No one from the state watchdog agency got_a_look at the books of promoter William E . Cooper or his partners . No one -- not even the president of the First Pension affiliate selling the pools -- ever knew what trust_deeds , or mortgages , underlay the investment pools or even whether they existed . Now , nearly seven years later , these pools are among hundreds offered by affiliates of First Pension into which nearly $ 100 million of investors ' funds may have vanished . That the filings passed unnoticed -- as did dozens of other potentially fraudulent offerings from companies affiliated with First Pension -- illustrates a gaping hole in the regulatory safety net that has contributed to hundreds of millions of dollars in investor losses in California real_estate investments in the last 15 years . About 11 # 000 investors may have lost more_than $ 450 million to mismanagement and fraud at three firms alone : San Diego ' s Pioneer Mortgage , Property Mortgage Co . of Sherman Oaks , and First Pension . Based in Irvine , First Pension sold many of its retirement-fund clients questionable mortgage investments packaged by its sister companies , Vestcorp and First Diversified Financial Services . Investors typically were referred to First Pension by their accountant or stockbroker . The surge of losses has refocused attention on the riskiness of these investments as well as the difficulty of policing the field . Many attorneys and government officials familiar_with the trust-deed business say it is notoriously prone to fraud and firmly resistant to regulation . Regulators say they have neither the money nor manpower to supervise the investments thoroughly . State agencies require no special expertise from those who set themselves up as mortgage brokers . Although a real_estate license is required to handle certain transactions , licensees need get no special training in mortgage lending . Moreover , promoters of trust_deeds can &quot; rent &quot; real_estate licenses by simply hiring licensed brokers to front for their firms . Regulatory jurisdiction is shared by two state agencies that do not habitually share information with each other : The Department of Real_Estate oversees transactions between individual borrowers and individual lenders . But if the trust_deed is &quot; fractionalized , &quot; or broken_into pieces for_sale to more_than one investor , it comes under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corporations . No one can expect the average investor to negotiate the resulting maze of jurisdictions . At least one First Pension customer was misled when he asked the Department of Corporations whether the firm ' s owners had clean histories . In August , 1991 , the agency told one Ventura County investor that the firm , its affiliates and its principals had &quot; no disciplinary records. &quot; In fact the Department of Real_Estate had revoked the license of Cooper , one of First Pension ' s three principals , in 1984 for misappropriating more_than $ 577 # 000 of his clients ' money . The department denied his application for reinstatement twice on grounds that he still owed more_than $ 100 # 000 to more_than seven clients who claimed he had given them worthless promissory_notes to settle legitimate debts . ( Cooper finally did get a new license. ) Other investors faced a regulatory runaround . When Helen G . Schroeder of Torrance wrote the Department of Corporations last July to complain that First Pension fraudulently kept $ 6 # 500 of a $ 9 # 500 distribution due her , she got a form_letter noting that the department gets 16 # 000 investor complaints a year and &quot; has no jurisdiction over a company ' s failure to provide a full accounting of funds. &quot; To the extent that the trust_deed business does come under regulation , those performing the oversight are overworked and underpaid . &quot; The ( regulators ) I ' ve worked with are all conscientious , &quot; said Dennis Schmucker , a lawyer who has acted_as court-appointed receiver for Pioneer Mortgage , American Home Mortgage and several other fraud-tainted operators in the business . &quot; But there ' s too_much for them to do. &quot; Adds Scott Metzger , a San Diego attorney who represented 900 investors in a lawsuit against Pioneer Mortgage : &quot; As a practical matter there ' s not enough money in California for them to send auditors to check_out all_the firms they regulate. &quot; The Department of Real_Estate , for example , employs 30 auditors to cover the entire state . &quot; We ' re just busy putting_out fires , &quot; said Deputy Commissioner John Liberator . The Department of Corporations also lacks the resources for systematic review of the exemption claims filed by investment pools , although something of the sort might have picked_up Cooper ' s blizzard of claims in 1987 . Under law , essentially similar offerings from a single promoter have to be treated as if they are all one . Thus , instead of 23 offerings to 35 customers each , Cooper was really making a single pitch to more_than 800 customers . If regulators had noticed that , they would have held the promoters to stringent terms , including audits , public disclosure of their financial_backing and an accounting of exactly which properties and what kind of mortgage investments they were selling . The state commissioner of corporations would have to give his approval before the investment could be offered for_sale . &quot; These are just routine filings and we get 40 # 000 of them a year , &quot; said G . W . McDonald , the agency ' s regional enforcement chief . &quot; There ' s no red flag system to pick_up the violations. &quot; First Pension was long a beneficiary of such cracks in the regulatory edifice , and not only at the state level . Although as a pension administrator it was subject_to auditing by the U.S. Department_of_Labor , regional officials at that agency say they did not get_around_to examining its books even once in its 14 years of existence . Trust_deeds entered the universe of popular California investments in November , 1979 , when voters approved Proposition 2 , lifting the usury ceiling of 10 % on mortgage brokers . Barely a year later the business had generated its first major fraud investigation when the Securities and Exchange Commission charged San Bernardino-based Western Sierra Group with defrauding investors of as much as $ 100 million by telling them they were buying second_mortgages when in fact they were buying thirds , fourths or fifths . &quot; There ' s a lot about this business that attracts problems , &quot; said Sheldon M . Jaffe , who was receiver for Southern California Realty , a trust_deed firm that went_under with millions in investor funds in the 1980s . Start with the borrowers . Typically homeowners turn_to trust_deed lenders because &quot; traditional lenders won ' t touch them , &quot; Schmucker said . The reason may be a poor credit history , a lost job , or concerns that the home equity being posted as collateral is not enough to support the mortgages already on it . In any event , Schmucker said , &quot; there ' s not enough high-quality product to go_around in a business where your best loan is already a questionable loan. &quot; In the pattern followed by most of the failed trust_deed brokerages , as defaults mount on their best loans -- and as new money continues to flow in from unwitting investors -- the promoters go trolling among ever more suspect borrowers . Defaults proliferate and &quot; then the Ponzi scheme starts , &quot; Schmucker said . To mask the defaults_on the earlier loans they use money coming_in from new investors . &quot; They begin to make loans they know they shouldn ' t , to buy_time , &quot; he said . &quot; Pretty soon they ' re making phony loans and pretty soon they ' re in jail . I ' ve handled four or five of these and they all fit the bill. &quot; These problems naturally intensified with the crash in California property values of the last few years . &quot; In the real_estate industry , a lot who were running an honest business just got killed , &quot; said Steven Gourley , a Los Angeles lawyer who was chief deputy commissioner of the Department of Corporations during the last great surge of trust_deed scams , in the early 1980s . &quot; If you were playing fast and loose from the beginning , this economy cut you in half. &quot; It is precisely the decline in real_estate that has uncovered many of the latest problems , the way old shipwrecks are exposed by a receding tide . &quot; As long as property values went_up , no one ever counted the money to see if it was still there , &quot; Gourley says . Meanwhile , as a putative investment in real_estate offering high returns -- some promoters have contended that they could pay their customers 20 % a year or more -- trust_deeds have attracted inattentive or incautious investors . &quot; The widow Jones , left a half-million dollars by her husband , at 5 % gets $ 25 # 000 a year . She ' s a prime target for someone who says he can give her 10 % , &quot; Jaffe said . &quot; The broker is minimizing the risk of the investment and she ' s convincing herself to believe him. &quot; Many investors are especially unaware that they may need to put_up more capital to protect their investment if the borrower defaults . If a homeowner stops making payments on his first_mortgage , for example , a foreclosure by the bank or other institution holding the first will typically wipe_out all_of the other mortgage holders -- unless they keep_up the payments on the first long enough to foreclose themselves , a period of at least four months . Most small investors in trust_deed pools do not have the wherewithal to do that . But as most investment experts say , the best defense against such surprises is for investors to be more careful going in . &quot; If the average investor would ask the promoter for the same information he gives when he fills_out a MasterCard application , most of these guys would just go_away , &quot; Jaffe said . &quot; I ' ve seen people invest in these with less information than I ' d use to buy a stereo. &quot;</TEXT>
