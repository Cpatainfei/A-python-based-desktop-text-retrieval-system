   <HEADLINE> HUMAN_RIGHTS IN CHINA OR JOBS IN CALIFORNIA ? CLINTON ' S MFN DECISION POSES A QUESTION OF CONSCIENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not many people were thinking economics on June 3 , 1989 , the day Chinese troops mounted their brutal assault on peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators in Tian An Men Square . But five years later , business and trade are the watchwords for the anniversary of an event that horrified the world . China ' s economy is going gangbusters now , expanding 13 % a year and emerging as a major engine for global trade . The Tian An Men blood bath is fading in memory , and persistent human_rights abuses don ' t seem to rouse the public or spook the American business_community anymore . Indeed , California companies are_on the front_lines of a nationwide movement urging President Clinton to put aside human_rights concerns this June 3 , which is , coincidentally , the deadline for his decision on whether to renew China ' s most-favored-nation status in trade . ( MFN permits nearly all U.S. trading partners to export goods to the United States at preferential , low-tariff rates. ) In a letter to Clinton late last month , a group of more_than 400 California companies calling itself the Business Coalition for U.S.-China Trade warned that rescinding China ' s trade privileges would have a disastrous effect on the California economy . Assuming China would retaliate and impose punitive tariffs on U.S. goods if its MFN status were revoked , the coalition estimated that more_than $ 1.7 billion worth of California exports to China , representing some 35 # 000 jobs , would be at risk . A study released last week by Sen . Mark O . Hatfield ( R-Ore. ) estimated that revoking MFN would cost American consumers $ 10 billion a year and hurt U.S. companies competing for some $ 400 billion in public works projects and capital goods orders that China is expected to put to bid over the next five years . Southern California ' s aerospace industry is especially vulnerable , said Mark Schlansky , manager of commercial aircraft for McDonnell Douglas ' Long_Beach subsidiary , Douglas Aircraft , which manufactures and exports MD-80 aircraft kits for assembly in Shanghai . &quot; We look_into our crystal ball and we see China . that ' s where the market is for us , &quot; Schlansky said . &quot; And this is what President Clinton is talking_about when he says he wants to protect high-skilled , high-paying jobs. &quot; Last June , under pressure from congressional critics of the Beijing regime , Clinton approved a one-year extension of the MFN status on the condition that China improve its human_rights record . But a defiant Chinese government has continued to jail political dissenters , while denouncing U.S. interference in its domestic affairs . Linking trade to respect for human_rights has entangled the Administration in a diplomatic Gordian knot : Backing_down would be an embarrassing display of weakness , while charging forward could endanger some $ 9 billion in annual U.S. exports to China -- and strain political ties_in the face of an emerging nuclear menace from Chinese ally North_Korea . Under the circumstances , the White_House is considering compromise proposals intended to avert an all-out trade war . One plan would involve selective sanctions against Chinese state-run enterprises ; another would impose codes_of_conduct on U.S. companies operating in China , perhaps by executive order . The recently reinstated &quot; Super 301 &quot; provision in U.S. trade law -- which allows the President to impose sanctions on specific commodities -- is yet another possibility for a limited approach to pressuring Beijing . Leaders in the business_community dismiss even these ideas , however . They say it is impossible to distinguish between state-owned and private enterprises in chaotic China economy and that a code of business conduct would be onerous because it would label companies &quot; agents &quot; of the U.S._government . &quot; Targeted sanctions would be as bad or worse than MFN withdrawal , &quot; said Richard Brecher , director of advisory services at the Washington-based U.S.-China Business Council . &quot; Going beyond whether it could be practically implemented , it would still leave us in the same box and invite retaliation. &quot; State enterprises , Brecher noted -- not the private , export-oriented companies in China -- purchase the most American goods and services in the critical aerospace , telecommunications and power industries . &quot; I think the Administration has got_to step_down and admit that its policy has been wrongheaded , &quot; he said . &quot; We can ' t keep hammering on ( the Chinese ) , threatening trade retaliation , without following through. &quot; Although many human_rights advocates and some members of Congress still demand that MFN be revoked , other activists are beginning to shift their strategy -- perhaps sensing a loss of momentum . Richard Dicker , associate counsel for the group Human_Rights Watch / Asia , said one alternative -- short of withdrawing MFN -- would be to quietly persuade U.S. corporations to adopt a uniform code_of_conduct for China voluntarily , before one is mandated . Under the group ' s code , which resembles one proposed by Sen . Max Baucus ( D-Mont. ) , U.S. companies would certify that prison labor was not used by their Chinese suppliers . Companies would agree to bar political indoctrination from their premises , to protect employees from losing their jobs for political reasons and to &quot; convey concerns about human_rights violations &quot; to Chinese authorities . &quot; I think it ' s the same for California businesses as for New York businesses : They ' re important players in Chinese economic transformation and development , &quot; Dicker said . &quot; They ' re making real contributions , and they ' re well placed to influence the Chinese on raising human_rights standards. &quot; Such a code would have the potential to emulate the government-mandated &quot; Sullivan Principles , &quot; which guided U.S. corporate engagement in South_Africa during the apartheid years , Dicker said . But he acknowledged that the American public is far less concerned about Beijing ' s policies than it was about business ties to Pretoria ' s white regime , which sparked widespread campus protests . Brecher , of the U.S.-China Business Council , recoils from the idea of a conduct code . &quot; We ' re not part of the problem , we ' re part of the solution , &quot; he said . Schlansky , the McDonnell Douglas executive , said U.S. companies are already carrying_out a human_rights mission on the ground in China . &quot; Many of us are there already with our own principles of conduct , our own way of doing business , &quot; he said . &quot; By letting us compete in the market , we ' re bringing a lot of change -- not necessarily revolutionary change , but certainly evolutionary. &quot; In its April 26 letter to Clinton , the California business group said U.S. trade and investment provide &quot; crucial support for the entrepreneurial forces in Chinese society that advocate further economic and political reform and pose a fundamental long-term challenge to the hard-liners &quot; in Beijing . &quot; All of us deplore human_rights abuses in China and elsewhere around the world but believe that revoking MFN would undermine important steps toward greater respect for human_rights and political freedom for the Chinese people , &quot; said the letter , which was endorsed by firms such_as Hewlett-Packard , Intel , Atlantic Richfield and Pacific Telesis . Not all U.S. companies share this outlook . Levi Strauss pulled_out of China in 1992 . Timberland , the Hampton , N.H.-based sports shoe maker , this year dropped Chinese suppliers out of distaste for the authoritarian regime . &quot; Dealing with China seemed inconsistent with a broader sense of morality , &quot; said Jeffrey B . Swartz , Timberland ' s chief operating officer . Ultimately , the debate over China ' s MFN status may fade from the headlines not because the sticky human_rights conflict is resolved , but because of a new interpretation of U.S. trade law . China was accorded MFN status in a bilateral agreement , but only on the condition that the President each year waive the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 , which denies the trade privileges to countries with state-planned , non-market_economies . Jackson-Vanik was a Cold_War restriction meant for the Soviet_Union and other communist nations , but it remains on the books . Greyson Bryan , a Los Angeles lawyer specializing in international commerce , said the China problem could be resolved simply by redefining the Chinese economy as market-oriented . &quot; I think there is a serious question as_to whether China has already evolved out of a non-market_economy , &quot; Bryan said . &quot; If so , then Jackson-Vanik doesn ' t apply and China ' s MFN status shouldn ' t come_up for review every year. &quot; In any event , revoking MFN in June would be a devastating blow to California ' s economic recovery , Brecher said . &quot; California , more_than any other state , &quot; he said , &quot; would be hard hit by the withdrawal of MFN. &quot;</TEXT>
