   <HEADLINE> FAVORED SCIENTISTS GOT CIGARETTE FIRM FUNDING ; RESEARCH : SUPPOSEDLY INDEPENDENT COUNCIL STEERED GRANTS TO STUDIES THAT MIGHT AID INDUSTRY , DOCUMENTS SHOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cigarette company lawyers for years ran a &quot; special projects &quot; division within the putatively independent Council for Tobacco Research , steering grants to favored scientists whose research might be used to defend the industry from legal attack , internal documents show . Documents from the files of Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co . show that top lawyers from the major cigarette firms during the 1970s and ' 80s made &quot; special project &quot; grants to scores of scientists and research organizations , bypassing a scientific advisory_board of outside experts . &quot; The industry research effort has included special projects designed to find scientists and medical doctors who might serve as industry witnesses in lawsuits or in a legislative forum , &quot; said B &amp; W general counsel Ernest Pepples in a 1978 memo to then-company Chairman Joseph E . Eden . Tobacco_industry officials long have asserted the council ' s independence from business and legal concerns , saying its grants are based on scientific merit alone . The claim has been central to the defense of smoker-death cases , in which industry lawyers have cited lavish support for the council as proof of an honest quest_for knowledge about the effects of tobacco products . Neither Pepples nor officials of the Council for Tobacco Research , based in New York , could be reached for comment . However , Tom Fitzgerald , a spokesman for Brown &amp; Williamson , said : &quot; We believe the Council for Tobacco Research operates with integrity and funds meritorious research by independent scientists who are then encouraged to publish it. &quot; Council materials are among reams of B &amp; W documents recently provided to congressional tobacco foes Reps . Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) and Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , and to several news organizations , including The Times . B &amp; W -- the No . 3 U.S. cigarette firm , which markets Barclay , Kool and other brands -- says the documents were stolen by a former paralegal for a law_firm that represents the company . The council will be the focus of a hearing today before Waxman ' s House subcommittee on health and environment . Originally called the Tobacco_Industry Research Council , the CTR was the industry ' s response to early studies linking smoking and lung_cancer -- a linkage so unspeakable for tobacco executives that B &amp; W ' s parent , British-American Tobacco , for a time used the code word &quot; ZEPHYR &quot; to describe the disease . The council was launched in 1954 with ads in 448 U.S. newspapers . Under the heading , &quot; A Frank Statement to Cigarette_Smokers , &quot; the tobacco firms proclaimed : &quot; We accept an interest in people ' s health as a basic responsibility , paramount to every_other consideration in our business. &quot; According to the announcement , the research council would get_at the truth of the health allegations by investigating &quot; all phases of tobacco use and health. &quot; An advisory panel of experts &quot; disinterested in the cigarette industry &quot; would screen research proposals for scientific merit . In the years since , the body has provided more_than $ 223 million in research grants , according to the council ' s 1993 annual report . The new disclosures are not the first to raise questions about the council . Tobacco foes in the past have denounced it as a public relations ploy meant to promote the fiction of a continuing debate on the health effects of smoking . In a candid 1974 memo introduced in a trial over the death several years ago of a New Jersey smoker , the research_director of Lorillard Inc. acknowledged : &quot; Historically , the joint industry-funded smoking and health research programs have been selected . . . for various purposes , such_as public relations , political_relations , position for litigation etc. &quot; But the newly leaked papers provide the most detailed information yet on the council ' s role in industry legal strategy . The documents include dozens of letters from attorneys with two big industry law_firms -- Shook , Hardy &amp; Bacon in Kansas City , Mo. ; and Jacob , Medinger &amp; Finnegan in New York -- seeking approval of CTR &quot; special project &quot; grants for various researchers . The letters were sent to Pepples and top lawyers for the other big cigarette firms . At least some of the &quot; special project &quot; grants went_to researchers studying alternative explanations for high rates of heart_disease and lung_cancer among smokers . Lawyers for Shook , Hardy , and Jacob , Medinger declined to discuss details of the special project grants , although Shook , Hardy attorney Gary Long said the research was not secret and grantees were allowed to publish their findings . The documents show that at least one researcher rejected for regular funding from the council turned_to the lawyers instead . According to the papers , after Louisiana State University researcher Dr. Henry Rothschild was turned_down in 1981 , industry lawyers granted CTR special project funding for his research on genetic and environmental factors_in lung_cancer . Rothschild later testified for the industry before Congress , according to the documents , which include a 1978 journal article , co-authored by Rothschild , that criticized as dubious such advice from doctors as &quot; the complete elimination of cigarettes. &quot; &quot; I don ' t think there were any restrictions placed on what we found , &quot; Rothschild said in a telephone_interview Wednesday when asked about his special project funding . &quot; There was no quid pro quo. &quot; A perennial recipient of special project funds was Carl C . Seltzer , formerly of the Harvard_University School of Public Health . The documents include four newspaper_clippings and four television_news transcripts chronicling a trip to Australia in May , 1979 , in which Seltzer ' s view that smoking does not cause heart_disease was widely quoted . &quot; Reports from colleagues in Australia and New Zealand indicate that Dr. Seltzer ' s visit ' was a great success , ' &quot; said a Shook , Hardy lawyer in a letter to Pepples . &quot; The CTR supported all kinds of research , &quot; including research &quot; contrary to the interests of the tobacco companies , &quot; Seltzer , now semi-retired , said in a telephone_interview Wednesday . &quot; I think that ' s a very important thing. &quot; Other documents include a position paper by foes of California ' s Proposition 10 , a smoking control initiative defeated by voters in November , 1980 . The paper , issued by a group called Californians Against Regulatory Excess , quoted several recipients of special project funds as debunking the problems of secondhand smoke -- but did not disclose their industry ties . The documents also reflect the council ' s legal significance to the industry as it braced for a surge in claims that tobacco caused smokers ' deaths . In 1978 memos to top B &amp; W executives , Pepples explained how CTR solved a huge legal quandary involving the industry ' s need to both fund research and be able to dismiss adverse findings . The CTR &quot; avoids the research dilemma presented to a responsible manufacturer of cigarettes , which on the one hand needs to know the state_of_the_art and on the other hand cannot afford the risk of having in-house work turn sour , &quot; Pepples wrote_on Sept . 29 , 1978 . &quot; The point here , &quot; he wrote , &quot; is the value of having CTR doing_work in a non-directed and independent fashion as contrasted with work either in-house or under B &amp; W contract which , if it goes_wrong , can become the smoking pistol in a lawsuit. &quot; On at least one occasion , however , Pepples voiced alarm that the council had funded sensitive &quot; red_light &quot; projects without the companies ' knowledge . These were biological tests related to cancer causation , including an effort to produce tumors in mice by injecting them with condensate from tobacco smoke . &quot; I confess that I was somewhat jarred by the revelation to me about tests on mice through the CTR , &quot; Pepples said in a March 10 , 1977 , memo to another B &amp; W executive . &quot; Jack Roemer ( a top R.J. Reynolds lawyer ) also finds that incongruous . He has checked with Ed Jacob ( of the Jacob , Medinger law_firm ) . . . . Ed was unaware of the fact of tests on mice , &quot; Pepples wrote . &quot; Pursuing the thought just a bit further , these tests are so-called red_light tests , &quot; Pepples wrote . &quot; No matter what our explanation happened to be , the fact of the red_light in our own hands would be a serious burden to the tobacco_industry if it came_out in legislative hearings or in litigation. &quot; Tobacco foes said the disclosures debunk industry claims about the council . &quot; It ' s an amazing situation , because to have a group of lawyers basically selecting scientific_research . . . completely goes_against the normal process by which scientific investigations are conducted , &quot; said Stanton Glantz , a University of California at San Francisco medical professor and longtime industry critic . The documents , he said , &quot; really reveal that the CTR as it was presented to the public was just a sham. &quot;</TEXT>
