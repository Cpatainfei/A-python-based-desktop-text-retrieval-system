   <TEXT> Actress Catherine Butterfield was_on tour with a play in Boston and decided to give an old boyfriend a call . They chatted for a while , and he invited her over to meet his wife , then seriously ill with breast_cancer . The two women , both in their late 30s , bonded fast . &quot; She was one of those women you meet and like instantly , &quot; Butterfield explains . &quot; I had just met her , but something about her made me feel I knew her for a long_time . And the stakes were dramatically heightened by the fact she was dying. &quot; Butterfield , who is also a playwright , couldn ' t start writing_about the evening fast enough . At first it was cathartic , helping her sort through a very emotional encounter . But soon she was transforming that experience into theater . She turned_out a first draft in three weeks , and several months and rewrites later , her play , &quot; Joined at the Head , &quot; premiered at New York ' s Manhattan Theatre Club , in October , 1992 . The award-winning drama , which is onstage at the Pasadena Playhouse through Feb . 20 , depicts how a new friend ' s illness affects the life and times of an emotionally guarded , wisecracking novelist . Butterfield ' s tale chronicles the unusual and intense friendship that develops between single novelist Maggie Mulroney , and Maggy Burroughs , the dying wife of Mulroney ' s former boyfriend Jim Burroughs . As much about life and vitality as about sickness and death , &quot; Joined at the Head &quot; follows the three friends from the two women ' s initial meeting through and beyond Maggy Burroughs ' death . But Silver Lake-based Butterfield wasn ' t content to write her story and leave it there . She also chose to play one of &quot; Joined at the Head ' s &quot; three principal characters . And her choice was not the role of novelist Mulroney ( played in Pasadena by Robin Pearson Rose ) that is so_much modeled on_her_own experience . Rather , it is the role she created in New York -- Maggy , the dying wife of Jim ( played here by Jeff Allin ) . &quot; I wanted to play the muse , &quot; Butterfield says matter-of-factly . &quot; No one else who could play the part knew her . I wanted to communicate her essence and felt it would be very difficult to explain her . Maggie Mulroney was more open_to interpretation because she was an amalgam of people. &quot; But there was more to it . &quot; The traps are lying all_over the place with the Maggy Burroughs role . The temptation to go_for pathos or pity or try to make her some kind of angelic , long-suffering martyr figure is very strong. &quot; The dying wife was also the smaller of the two roles , and Butterfield was , after all , the author of a new , untested play that might need rewrites . &quot; The amount of work you potentially do the first time a play is produced could be enormous , &quot; says Pamela Berlin , who directed the play in both New York and Pasadena . &quot; If either the writing or the acting had to suffer , I was much more concerned she ( first ) get the play_up to where it had to be. &quot; The play is complicated structurally , full of flashbacks , asides to the audience and even replays of scenes from different characters ' points_of_view . &quot; There were many nights she was up for hours working_on rewrites , &quot; Berlin says , &quot; but she was really able to separate herself . When she was onstage , I know her writer ' s mind was going , but she could allow herself to become the character. &quot; Butterfield , a professional actress for 20 years , has been trained to do that . When the play was first read at Manhattan Theatre Club , in fact , Artistic Director Lynne Meadow recalls , &quot; I thought the woman reading the part of Maggy was wonderful . I asked who it was , and they said , ' that ' s the playwright. ' &quot; * Butterfield was back on a New York stage last fall_for the WPA Theatre production of her play &quot; Snowing at Delphi , &quot; and she is the first to admit she ' s usually writing parts she would enjoy playing . Like everyone from Harold Pinter to &quot; A Bronx Tale ' s &quot; Chazz Palminteri , Butterfield knows the value of writing herself a good_part . As a 40-year-old woman , Butterfield also knows that good_parts for women over 30 are rare : &quot; I know so many talented women who are out_of_work and I know so many not-very-talented men who are working a lot , and I find that really appalling . &quot; I write to purge myself . But I also write to create good roles , honest roles for women instead of the usual panoply of bimbos and mothers . I know women who consider themselves lucky to be playing somebody ' s basically characterless mother on TV when they are worthy of so_much more. &quot; It no doubt helps to be as attractive , self-assured and outgoing as Butterfield . It probably also helps to be raised in a media-aware family ; her father managed different CBS affiliate stations around the country , and her mother is a former playwright , radio writer and TV talk-show host currently affiliated with San Diego Magazine . Butterfield , the oldest of five children , started writing plays in second grade and would enlist family members for performances in the garage or basement . New York-born , she lived long periods in Massachusetts and Minnesota , has a degree in theater from Southern Methodist University in Dallas and did stints with California Actors Theatre and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival before winding_up back in New York . She was doing_well with her acting career in New York when , in 1983 , she came_down with hepatitis . During her six-month recuperation , she picked_up a pen and yellow pad and started to write . &quot; I couldn ' t act and had all these juices that needed to flow , &quot; she explains . She sent that first play off to the Eugene O ' Neill Theater Center ' s prestigious National Playwright ' s Conference . It wasn ' t selected for a reading , but it did make the finals . &quot; I took it as an encouraging sign , &quot; Butterfield says , &quot; and thought I should keep going. &quot; If she had any doubts left , reception to &quot; Joined at the Head &quot; should erase them . New York Magazine ' s John Simon called it &quot; an incontestable achievement , &quot; and other critics generally predicted good times ahead for Butterfield . Last fall she received Newsday ' s George Oppenheimer Award , given annually to a writer making an initial New York bow and awarded in prior years to such writers as George C . Wolfe and Beth Henley . * Butterfield was also ready for this breakthrough play when she ran_into Kathy and Peter , the Boston couple she identifies only by their first_names . She had joined the touring production of Wendy Wasserstein ' s &quot; The Heidi Chronicles &quot; in 1990 , understudying the lead character at Hollywood ' s Doolittle Theatre and elsewhere , to stock up both money and free_time to write plays . She brought along her portable_computer . It is clear talking with Butterfield that Kathy and Peter were far more_than muses . Asking if the interviewer would like to see what they looked_like , for instance , she immediately produces a photograph , and the photograph remains close_at_hand , propped_up against a vase throughout the entire visit . &quot; Joined at the Head &quot; closely parallels her own relationship to the couple during the last few months of Kathy ' s life . Portions have been imagined or altered for dramatic tension , she says , but the basic main structure is true . She tried to be particularly faithful to the character modeled on Kathy . Aside from dropping Kathy ' s Boston accent , Butterfield says , she wrote her character much as she perceived her , from her bright , colorful wardrobe to her bravery and humor in such an unfunny situation . Her novelist-narrator Maggie Mulroney , she says , is &quot; partly me , partly my speculations about successful women like Wendy Wasserstein and partly all my girlfriends who don ' t have men in their lives but have careers . that ' s where I came_up with the idea of her being kind of a lonely outsider who meets these people and is affected by them deeply. &quot; * Much of &quot; Joined at the Head &quot; is drawn from Butterfield ' s experience , of course , including a riotous depiction of a pompous TV talk-show host . She was writing away in her Boston hotel_room when a cable interview with Wasserstein came_on TV . &quot; I had been sort of fascinated with her , this successful writer who seemed kind of lonely in some ways , &quot; Butterfield says . &quot; I think some of her bled into the play. &quot; ( Wasserstein , who was also a judge on the Oppenheimer Award , says she enjoyed that scene in Butterfield ' s play and considers her &quot; a playwright with a great_deal of promise because she is both witty and humane . Also , she ' s able to treat a tragic subject with humor , which is very difficult to do. &quot; ) &quot; Joined at the Head &quot; evolved through several readings , including one in a Washington , D.C. , hotel_room during the &quot; Heidi &quot; tour , another at the New Voices playwriting program at Los Angeles ' Matrix Theatre and , eventually , at Manhattan Theatre Club . Hearing in Butterfield &quot; an interesting new voice , &quot; MTC ' s Meadow booked the play for a full production . Commitment from a major New York theater put Butterfield in a quandary : how to tell her friends she had turned their lives into theater and was already speculating on Kathy ' s death . &quot; Kathy was a nurse and knew her prognosis ; the cancer had reached her vital_organs , &quot; she says . &quot; But it felt kind of presumptuous , which is why when they said they were going_to do the play , I was thrilled and terrified at the same time. &quot; She also wondered when to tell her friends . So when Peter was dancing with her at her October , 1991 , wedding to agent Larry Corsa in New York , &quot; I thought , ' This is the moment , ' and I told him. &quot; Both members of the couple read the play and , she says , &quot; Kathy called to say , ' You got everything right . You told the truth. ' After we hung_up , I burst into tears. &quot; The play was postponed once , which worried Butterfield . Kathy was &quot; failing fast &quot; and had a goal of getting_to New York to see the play . Kathy , who made_it to previews , died eight weeks later on the show ' s closing day . &quot; It sounds like hubris , &quot; Butterfield says today , &quot; but I really felt our play was keeping her alive. &quot; In fact , she says , it was difficult for her to play in the show again in Los Angeles , particularly repeating her role as the dying wife . She says she had hoped to play the larger role of the novelist this time_out but was convinced by Pasadena Playhouse producers to reprise her New York performance . &quot; It was so meaningful the last time , so supercharged , &quot; says Butterfield , her eyes filling with tears . &quot; Now that she ' s gone , it ' s more difficult to play her with the same hopefulness , and I sometimes go_home very depressed. &quot; It probably helps that she ' s written a sequel of sorts . The Manhattan Theatre Club commissioned &quot; The A.V. Man , &quot; a drama that follows Jim ' s life after his wife dies . The play , which MTC is considering for next season , opens with a grief-therapy group session but is less tied to real events than is &quot; Joined at the Head. &quot; Not one to waste an experience , Butterfield has also started work_on a new play that came indirectly from her publicity efforts on &quot; Joined at the Head. &quot; After her mother started questioning remarks Butterfield made in the Village Voice about growing_up with Hedda Gabbler , the playwright thought it might be interesting &quot; to rework ' Hedda Gabbler ' as a woman trapped in suburbia in the ' 50s. &quot; Meanwhile , she ' s not about to give_up acting : &quot; I know there ' s much more demand for good writers than for good actresses , but I don ' t want to give acting_up , because it ' s so satisfying . So if I can do both , I ' d consider myself the luckiest of women. &quot;</TEXT>
