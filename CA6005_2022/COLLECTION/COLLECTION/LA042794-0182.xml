   <TEXT> The top movie in town was &quot; Klute , &quot; starring Jane Fonda . &quot; The Godfather &quot; was being filmed on the streets of New York ' s Little Italy . Sonny and Cher were scheduled to do their popular Sunday night variety_show , but they were about to get preempted because President Richard Nixon had a bombshell to deliver on national TV . That night , Aug . 15 , 1971 , Nixon wrote himself into the economics books by imposing wage and price_controls on workers and businesses and taking the American dollar off the gold_standard . Economists and participants in the Nixon Administration recall the simultaneous moves as among the most popular steps Nixon ever took as President . As the country prepares_for his funeral today , it is worth noting that his decision to let the dollar float in value against other world currencies is the foundation of the modern-day global financial market -- certainly one of Nixon ' s most enduring legacies . &quot; Everything ( in the markets ) today is about learning how to deal with fluctuating currencies , &quot; says Herbert Stein , then a member ( and later the chairman ) of the President ' s Council of Economic Advisers . Nixon observers and his former advisers argue that few things exemplified his streak of practicality -- and opportunism -- as much as his economic_policies . &quot; He was a pragmatist on economic affairs , which was very much to his credit , &quot; says Robert Eisner , an economist at Northwestern University . &quot; With the wage and price_controls , he assured a more rapid short-term economic recovery , &quot; says Nobel Economics Laureate Paul Samuelson , &quot; and he made_it absolutely certain he would be the overwhelming victor in the 1972 election. &quot; The morning after , as it happened , came during the Administration of his successor , Gerald R . Ford . Nixon ' s approach to business and economics exemplifies how hard he could be to categorize as a political being . As a Republican President , he established the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration , enduring Republican whipping boys as symbols of government regulation . He also tried to get welfare and health_care reform through Congress but failed ; this week , Hillary Rodham Clinton herself invoked his memory in promoting her own health_care reform initiative . Just as his overtures to China and the Soviet_Union contradicted his image as a Cold_War hard-liner , Nixon ' s wage and price_controls won him praise from liberals and curses from conservatives . The Nixon Administration spanned a period of considerable economic uproar . He took_office during a period of relatively high inflation and unemployment and spent the first two to three years of his term contemplating measures to stimulate the economy . America ' s balance_of_trade emerged for the first time in years as a major political issue : Administration critics were warning that the country was_on the verge of recording its first foreign trade_deficit of the century . The nation already had a trade_deficit with Japan of $ 3.2 billion ( $ 63.2 billion today ) . Then in 1973 came the first of two &quot; oil shocks &quot; when the OPEC cartel decided to sharply raise the price of crude_oil , leading to gasoline shortages and lines at the pump . But by that point , Nixon had made his stand . * On Friday , Aug . 13 , 1971 , he sequestered himself with his top economic and political advisers at Camp David . The group included Nixon speech writer William Safire , Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Paul McCracken , Treasury_Secretary John Connolly and Stein , all_of whom were set for working_out details of the wage-price freeze and the end to the gold_standard . That Sunday night , Nixon went_on television to inform the American public that the United States would &quot; temporarily &quot; suspend the right of foreign governments to trade their dollars for gold . The move , he said , would result in a &quot; slight &quot; devaluation of the dollar ( in the event it sank by more_than 10 % ) . The wage-price controls began with a 90-day period in which all wages , prices and rents were frozen . Under Phase 2 , beginning Nov . 14 , 1971 , two government commissions had the right to set strict guidelines on price increases and wage hikes . The Price Commission limited price increases to 2.5 % during 1972 , for example . The Pay Board announced a plan to limit wage increases to 5.5 % a year , but under pressure from organized labor , it subsequently approved some major contracts at higher rates . &quot; Nixon knew at the time that the freeze was an economic mistake , but he saw it as a political necessity , &quot; says Stein , adding that the boldness of the move could be traced to Connolly , the former Democratic governor of Texas . &quot; Connolly was a person for the dramatic gesture , &quot; Stein says . The idea was that the freeze would enable Federal_Reserve_Board Chairman Arthur Burns to institute hugely stimulative policies without worrying about higher inflation . The country reacted with enthusiasm . The stock_market soared , sending the Dow Jones industrial average up a then-record 32.93 points to 888.95 on record volume of 31.72 million shares . ( By comparison , the Dow closed at 3 # 699.54 on Tuesday ; New York Stock_Exchange volume today averages nearly 10 times the 1971 level. ) &quot; It was the most popular thing he ever did , &quot; Stein says . &quot; People thought , ' Now someone will protect us from our butcher and our landlord. ' &quot; Americans contemplating that era from today ' s vantage_point can be forgiven for wondering what all_the fuss was about . The inflation_rate in 1971 before Nixon ' s speech was 4.6 % and the unemployment_rate was 5.9 % . * The wage-price freeze did succeed in shutting_down inflation -- temporarily . The increase in consumer prices dropped to a 2.7 % annual average from August , 1971 , through June , 1972 . But by then , wholesale price pressures were building throughout the economy . Food shortages began to appear as farmers kept goods off the market . When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries drove_up oil prices in 1973 , the Administration knew it had lost the price_control battle . In 1974 , the nation entered its worst recession since the 1930s ; inflation reached 12.3 % . &quot; I think the only good thing you could say about Nixon ' s controls is that because of him , no one will try them again for a long_time , &quot; Stein says . Taking America off the gold_standard was a different issue . At the time , Americans were forbidden to privately own gold in bulk . Meanwhile , foreign countries owned so_much U.S. currency that there was not enough gold in Ft . Knox to settle their claims if they all turned_in their cash at the fixed rate of $ 35 per ounce . The overvalued dollar made imports cheap and exports expensive , exacerbating the growing U.S. trade imbalance . To limit capital outflows , the government imposed heavy taxes on foreign investments by U.S. companies , which made American businessmen howl . Closing the gold window ended all that . The dollar quickly fell by more_than 10 % . Within months , today ' s system of floating exchange_rates began to take_shape . Its offspring govern the modern_world of finance ; the volume of world trade_in goods and services in 1992 was about $ 3.7 trillion , but the value of foreign_exchange transactions designed to finance that trade and to hedge fluctuations in currency rates was an astounding $ 220 trillion . &quot; Only with floating exchange_rates could we possibly have had the explosion in world trade we ' ve seen over the last 25 years , &quot; McCracken says . &quot; Without it , we ' d just have been limping along. &quot; * RELATED STORY : A1 Nixonomics : The Greatest Legacy ? On August 15 , 1971 , President Richard M . Nixon made economic history by imposing wage and price_controls and taking the American dollar off the gold_standard . Here ' s a snapshot of the way things were_on that fateful day , compared to now . 03 # 31 , 17 # 18 Then Now Inflation 4.62 % 2.51 % Gold price $ 35.00 $ 374.30 Dow Jones industrial average 888.95 3699.54 U.S. trade_deficit with Japan $ 3.2 billion $ 63.2 billion U.S. budget_deficit * $ 24.787 billion $ 226.272 billion Unemployment_rate * * 5.9 % 6.5 % * Yearly for totals 1971 and 1993 , respectively * * Seasonally adjusted ; August , 1971 , and March , 1994 , respectively Sources : WEFA Group , Dept . of Labor , International Public Relations Inc. THE IMPACT Abandoning the gold_standard : Nixon suspended the so-called Bretton Woods system under which world currencies were pegged to the dollar and through it to gold , thus maintaining fixed exchange_rates . In suspending that system , Nixon wanted to let the dollar fall to a new level that more realistically reflected international assessments of the U.S. economy ' s strength . He reasoned that such action would give the United States more flexibility in economy policy . But by 1973 , inflationary pressures and volatile capital flows led governments to give_up attempts to maintain fixed exchange_rates . Floating exchange_rates are now a foundation of the modern-day global financial market -- perhaps Nixon ' s most enduring legacy . Wage and price_controls : Nixon ' s imposition of controls on wages , prices and rents was an unprecedented U.S._government intrusion into a peacetime economy . The initial 90-day freeze initially worked , as the vast majority of Americans cooperated and inflation was temporarily stemmed . But Nixon later abandoned the controls amid growing inflationary pressures -- including those created by the 1973 oil embargo . In 1974-75 , the nation endured its deepest recession since the 1930s , following the worst inflation in the postwar era .</TEXT>
