   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : MEXICO POISED FOR ECONOMIC VOTE OF CONFIDENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mexico is about to offer the world a live demonstration of how important faith and confidence are to an economy . If its national elections next Sunday are carried_out &quot; cleanly &quot; -- without tampering or egregious vote fraud -- then no matter which presidential candidate comes_out ahead , confidence in Mexico will surge . Internationally and domestically , that will uncap tremendous flows of pent-up business investment and the country , without fear of inflation , will be able to push its economy for much-needed growth -- 4 % or even 5 % , sufficient to create 1 million jobs a year . A good election will confirm the wisdom of the economic program that has guided Mexico for the last six years and from which Americans could learn a thing or two . The latest news is encouraging . With a week to go , confidence is rising that the election will be open and above board and launch Mexico on a new political path more suited to its economic maturity . But if the election result is clouded by substantial charges of tampering by the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , it will unleash demonstrations throughout the country . Financial markets will sell_off , and investors will put their money elsewhere , deducing that Mexico isn ' t going_to change after all . Why such tangible , pesos-and-centavos consequences from intangible faith and confidence ? Because of all_the body blows to confidence that characterized Mexico ' s economy in the 1970s and ' 80s : massive devaluations , loan defaults , nationalizations of industry . Foreign investors were burned badly , and most are_on the fence today . But that foreign discomfort was as nothing compared to the sufferings inside Mexico . In 1987 , the year before the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his band of U.S.-educated &quot; technocrats &quot; took_office , inflation in Mexico was 159 % and the government deficit was 16 % of gross_domestic_product . Yet this year , inflation is down to 7 % and there is no government deficit , zero , none . Americans , who wring their hands_over chronic government deficits , should take_a_look at how Mexico solved its problems . It sold state industries and used the proceeds to pay down debt . And it lowered taxes . The result is that Mexico ' s national_debt today is equal_to 11 % of its total annual output , or GDP , compared to roughly 60 % in the U.S. and more_than that in Japan . Also , lower taxes on a broader tax_base have increased government_revenues , while encouraging investment and saving . &quot; We lowered the corporate tax_rate from 42 % to 34 % and repealed the tax on dividends , &quot; explains Francisco Gil Diaz , deputy governor of the Bank of Mexico -- the nation ' s central_bank -- and the man responsible_for the tax reform . &quot; For individuals the top rate was 55 % . We lowered it to 35 % , and we have no state and local income_taxes . And we introduced a treatment for capital_gains that practically means they are not taxed . &quot; Also if you own a share_in a corporation and you are in a lower bracket than the corporate 34 % rate , you can claim a credit for the difference between tax the corporation paid and the tax you owe , &quot; says Gil , whose doctorate in economics is from the University of Chicago . The purpose of such tax relief is that it encourages saving and capital formation in a country that is starved for capital . Yes , but one reason for political unrest is that Mexico is a country of large income disparities , with a government that lacks credibility due_to a well-earned reputation for doing favors for its friends . Was tax reform another bauble for Mexico ' s billionaire families ? No , because along with lower rates went tougher collections , so that income_tax revenues have risen from $ 5.9 billion in 1988 to $ 20 billion last year . And savings among the Mexican people , even though poor , may be the surprise story of the next few years . There is pent-up demand for mortgages , which are coming_back after disappearing in the inflationary chaos of 10 years ago . There is great demand for housing , in short supply at all levels . Condominium properties in Mexico_City sell for $ 300 to $ 500 a square_foot , prices comparable_to Beverly Hills and Manhattan ' s East_Side . Change is already here in Mexico . For if tax relief was the government ' s carrot for industry , the stick is competition . Trucking has been deregulated and shipping charges are way down . State-owned airlines have been sold and are now lower-priced and competitive . The privatized Telefonos de Mexico will face long-distance competition in a_few years . And Mexico is spurring bank competition by allowing new banks to form and by inviting in more_than 100 foreign banks and investment_firms . Mexico ' s economy remains volatile , to be sure . To finance a trade and current_account deficit , the government is borrowing short term and in dollars . As Mexican industry restructures for NAFTA and global competition , earnings prospects and stock prices of Mexican companies could tumble . But if the election goes well , the boost to Mexican business will be powerful and immediate . Specifically , Mexico will soon gain an investment grade credit rating from Moody ' s and Standard &amp; Poor ' s , a measure of faith and confidence that will allow its companies to borrow at lower interest_rates on world markets . What price faith and confidence ? Mexico ' s companies , even big ones , are now forced to borrow at 10 % to 12 % interest while global competitors pay only 7 % for credit . After Aug . 21 , Mexico should get_to demonstrate what a renewal of confidence is worth . * MUTUAL_FUNDS : Fund managers are upbeat about Mexico . D4</TEXT>
