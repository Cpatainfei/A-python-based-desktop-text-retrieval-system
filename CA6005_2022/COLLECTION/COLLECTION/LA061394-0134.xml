   <HEADLINE> BACKLOG OF NEEDED ROAD REPAIRS IS MOUNTING ; TRANSPORTATION : DOZENS OF IMPROVEMENTS ARE DELAYED DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS . OFFICIALS SAY PROBLEMS IGNORED TODAY MAY MEAN BIG TROUBLE IN FUTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Each day , motorists crawl down torn-up California 118 through Saticoy , sitting in stalled traffic as road crews labor to complete a project launched more_than a decade ago . Across the county , commuters inch along the Moorpark Freeway , narrowed to one lane in each direction so that workers can roll fresh asphalt onto off-ramps . that ' s the good news . These traffic tangles will end with the completion of both projects , scheduled later this summer . But traffic is increasing throughout the county , adding strain to the area ' s aging road system , which county transportation leaders don ' t have the funds to ease . By the end of this year , more_than 100 miles of worn-down roadways throughout Ventura County will go unrepaired . Projects to widen dozens of jammed intersections will be delayed and plans to install scores of stoplights postponed . Streets identified as among the most congested in the county may languish for 30 years or more before money to fix them becomes available . While the county ' s infrastructure may appear mostly trouble-free to the average motorist , transportation experts warn that cracks and traffic snarls barely noticeable today are the harbingers of more serious problems . City and county officials warn that it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain aging road systems as public_transit programs are poised to compete for an already limited pool of funds . They predict that even with careful planning , traffic is going_to get_worse before it gets better . About 144 # 000 vehicles a day crossed the county_line east of Thousand Oaks on the Ventura Freeway in 1989 , the last time the state counted traffic there . By 2010 , that number -- which includes traffic into and out of the county -- will jump to 199 # 000 , according to the California Department_of_Transportation . &quot; Ventura County has done a good job of controlling growth , so congestion here is not as bad as in other parts of Southern California , &quot; said Chris Stephens , a planner for the Ventura County Transportation Commission . &quot; The problem is that even with limited future growth , we ' re going to see an increase in cars on_the_road and all_of the problems that brings. &quot; During the past 20 years , Ventura County ' s population has nearly doubled and traffic has increased even more . From 1980 to 1990 , the number of miles driven each day in Ventura County jumped 61 % , according to Caltrans . Over the same period , the number of new miles of roadway increased by 8 % and funding for transportation inched up just 3 % . Meanwhile , four years ago , the state took_control of millions of dollars in fines and forfeiture fees that cities depended_on to boost their road revenue . &quot; It used to be when our Police_Department arrested a drunk driver , we could count_on $ 1 # 000 in fines that would go right to roads , &quot; said Norm Wilkinson , Santa Paula ' s director of public works . &quot; Now all we get is the bill for the booking fee , and the city streets wait another year. &quot; Nearly 60 streets in Thousand Oaks , Simi Valley , Oxnard , Ventura , Camarillo and Port Hueneme must be widened or repaved to avoid increased congestion , city officials say . However , most city and county officials say they don ' t have enough money for repairs , let alone road improvements . &quot; We are basically hanging_on by our teeth , &quot; said Art Goulet , the county ' s public works director . &quot; We look_at all_of the projects that need doing , and then we put most of them off for another year. &quot; Yet prolonged delays can cause the costs of repair_to skyrocket . A quick patch job on a mile of damaged roadway costs about $ 80 # 000 . If the work is postponed and the problem worsens , the costs of completely stripping and repaving that same stretch runs about $ 800 # 000 . &quot; What happens is we will get_to a point where the roads are so bad that a_few patches are not going_to do the trick , &quot; Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani said . &quot; We are going_to wind_up with major road repair projects on our hands and no money to fix them. &quot; As for highways , a financial crisis at Caltrans will likely force delays in planned projects throughout the state . Caltrans announced in August that unless the funding picture improves , many projects planned for construction after 1995 will have to be downsized , delayed or eliminated . &quot; We ' re looking_at a statewide crunch , which means everybody is going_to suffer , &quot; said Jerry Baxter , director of Caltrans District No . 7 , which includes Ventura and Los Angeles counties . &quot; For Ventura County , it might mean some projects don ' t get done. &quot; In the past , a planning document called the State Transportation Improvement Program provided a detailed blueprint of all_the major highway and rail projects to be undertaken by Caltrans over a seven-year period . In Ventura County , the Transportation Commission has listed the top 15 highway projects . Seven are included in the Caltrans blueprint . Until last year , projects on the list were virtually assured of being completed . Now , a decline in state gas tax_revenue and federal funding means that the future of those projects is uncertain . Among the jeopardized projects are the widening of the Ventura Freeway from Vineyard Avenue to Johnson Drive , the construction of a new Seaward Avenue bridge and the widening of the Moorpark Freeway from Moorpark to Thousand Oaks . &quot; Beyond the first few projects on the list , it ' s really a wish list , &quot; Stephens said . &quot; It ' s hard to say when we ' ll be able to tackle many of those projects. &quot; A project to widen California 33 through Casitas Springs is scheduled for the year 2023 . &quot; We ' re going to be in_for some very long waits , &quot; said Ginger Gherardi , executive_director of the county ' s Transportation Commission . &quot; And the costs are just going_to keep going up. &quot; Adding_to the concern are new state and federal regulations that require counties every two years to evaluate congestion levels and submit plans to reduce traffic tie-ups or risk losing millions of dollars in transportation funding . Ventura County stands to lose up_to $ 6.2 million a year if it fails to submit the plan . The Congestion Management Plan provides the county with a standardized way to measure traffic levels and the impact of new development on traffic . Under the plan , roads throughout the county are graded , like schoolwork , on an A-through-F system . A ' s are granted to perfectly free-flowing roads and Fs to poorly functioning areas that suffer rush-hour traffic_jams . The most recent plan , completed in December , gives flunking grades to six spots throughout the county and assigns dates for fixing the problems . The problem spots are California 33 through Casitas Springs , the Ventura Freeway at Hampshire Road in Thousand Oaks , the intersection of Tierra Rejada and Moorpark roads in Moorpark , High_Street in Moorpark , California 118 in Saticoy , and the three-way intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Saviers and Wooley roads in Oxnard . The completion last fall of a $ 39-million connector linking the Simi Valley and Moorpark freeways has relieved much of the congestion on High_Street , and Caltrans is working to complete an overhaul of California 118 and construction of a new Saticoy Bridge by August . &quot; These are good projects that are going_to be a big help in relieving congestion , &quot; Baxter said . &quot; But some of these other projects are going_to wait a long_time for funding. &quot; With funding a major source of delays , cities are looking_for other ways to speed_up road projects . Oxnard Transportation Manager Samia Maximous said it can take years to get a project through Caltrans bureaucracy , before ground is even broken for the planned work . But according to Baxter , little can be done to eliminate the delays , which are just a part of the way government works . &quot; There are a lot of precautions you have to take , a lot of guidelines to follow , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s just what you have to deal with when you deal with government . So what ? &quot; Ken Gilbert , Moorpark ' s public works director , gave a recent example of where Caltrans slowed a project . Moorpark was planning to install new storm drains on Moorpark Avenue , also known as California 23 . But when Moorpark asked Caltrans to pick_up part of the cost , the agency would not pay until it had determined how much of the runoff came from city development . After several months of delays and a hydrology study , Caltrans ended_up paying 40 % . &quot; They could have just estimated rather than going_through the study , &quot; Gilbert said . &quot; But that ' s not the way they do things . You ' ve just got_to be patient and push them to get things done. &quot; Caltrans is not the only culprit when projects get bogged down , Baxter said . &quot; We ' ve had tons of problems with joint projects with cities where we ' re ready to go , but the city can ' t come_up with its share of the funding , so the project goes_on the shelf , &quot; the Caltrans official said . &quot; The pendulum swings both ways. &quot; Hoping to improve communication with cities and help speed_up projects , Caltrans several years ago opened a district office in Ventura . City officials said relations with the agency since then have improved somewhat , but problems persist . &quot; I am extremely pleased with dealing with the satellite office , &quot; Ojai Public Works Director Stan Moore said . &quot; But it ' s frustrating sometimes that Caltrans is so big that they don ' t bother to tell their own people what is going on. &quot; In April , during Ojai ' s 95th annual tennis tournament , Moore received several calls from angry residents complaining about traffic backups on California 150 , the main artery through town . Caltrans had launched a paving project . &quot; We were in the middle of this major event and , all_of a sudden , Caltrans is out there doing crack filling , &quot; Moore said . &quot; They didn ' t bother to tell anybody in the city , and it was a real hassle for everyone. &quot; Caltrans has since sent Moore a letter outlining its plans for the project . Even the most amicable of relations between the cities , the county and Caltrans will not bring more money to Ventura County , and cities continue to fret over how they will fund roadway projects . While cities and counties throughout California are facing the same federal funding shortages , Ventura County is the most populous county in the state without a portion of its local sales tax devoted to transportation . In 1990 , Ventura County voters overwhelmingly defeated a sales-tax measure . In November , the measure will appear on the ballot for a second time . In the meantime , much to the dismay of public works directors and traffic engineers seeking more funds for roads , the county ' s Transportation Commission has chosen to tackle the congestion problem from another angle : by beefing_up public transportation . In the past two years , the commission has added Metrolink commuter rail service and , starting July 5 , the commission and the cities will launch an unprecedented countywide bus_service . &quot; The fact is , no matter how much we improve our roadways , we are not going_to be able to avoid the problem of congestion , &quot; the commission ' s Stephens said . &quot; The solution is to drive less , and that raises the need for alternatives. &quot; Tuesday : The struggle to get commuters out of their cars and onto Metrolink .

Source : Ventura County Transportation Commission Saticoy Bridge Project This timeline gives a step-by-step look_at one Caltrans project , from conception to near-completion : * 1983 : Caltrans reports that each day the rickety Saticoy Bridge handles more_than 27 # 000 cars and trucks , the highest traffic volume on any two-lane state_highway in Ventura County . A Caltrans environmental study finds the 34-year-old bridge &quot; structurally deficient as well as functionally obsolete. &quot; Caltrans proposes a project to : -- Tear_down the old two-lane Saticoy Bridge and replace it with a modern , four-lane span . -- Widen 2.3 miles of highway on either side of the bridge from two to four lanes , from the interchange of California 118 and the Santa Paula Freeway to Vineyard Avenue . -- Build a new , direct link between the Wells Road section of California 118 and the Los Angeles Avenue section of the route , eliminating a dogleg that causes traffic backups as drivers are forced to wind through the heart of Saticoy . Projected cost : $ 17 million . The estimated year state funding is expected to be available : 1987 . Year the bridge is scheduled for completion : 1990 . * 1984 : Public hearing in Saticoy on the project draws more_than 150 residents , who raise concerns about noise , traffic and plans by Caltrans to condemn local businesses to make room for the new road . * 1985 : A $ 300-million shortfall in the state ' s $ 5.3-billion highway project fund forces Caltrans to delay the project indefinitely . * 1989 : Ventura County Transportation Commission reschedules project for construction beginning in 1992 . Estimated cost increases to $ 21.85 million . * 1990 : In January , Saticoy residents join forces to protest delays , saying the bridge is unsafe and needs immediate repairs . Blaming rising land prices , Caltrans in December increases estimated cost of Saticoy project to $ 30 million . * 1991 : In response to the increased cost and delays in buying rights_of_way , Caltrans splits the project into two parts . -- Phase One includes construction of the new bridge and road widening . Estimated cost : $ 18 million . -- Phase Two entails adding a new California 118 link . Caltrans condemns 7 businesses to make room for the new stretch of roadway . Estimated cost of Phase Two : $ 12 million . * 1992 : Nine years after the project was conceived , work begins on Phase One . At the urging of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , Caltrans spends $ 12 # 000 on 12-foot-high mesh screens to hang from the bottom of the old bridge_deck to shield nesting swallows from construction work . Overall , bids come_in lower than expected because of the recession . Cost of Phase One drops to $ 13.1 million . * 1993 : Ten years after the project was conceived , work begins on Phase Two . Recession lowers cost to $ 9 million . * Aug . 6 , 1994 : Entire project scheduled for completion , four years behind schedule and $ 5.1 million over original budget . Source : Caltrans</TEXT>
