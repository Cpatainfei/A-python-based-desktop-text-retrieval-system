   <HEADLINE> PRAISE THE LARD ; RESTORING A FAT ' S SPATTERED REPUTATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a Mexican chef and restaurateur , I am always being asked , &quot; Do you cook with lard ? &quot; My answer is always , &quot; Yes , yes ! &quot; I love lard . I use it when I want its flavor , as in refried beans , or the lightness and fluffiness it brings_to tamales , or the crispness it gives to pastries and fried antojitos , or the way it melds the flavors of the countless ingredients in some moles . But when I first moved to New York , I was surprised to find that hardly anyone there cooked with lard . They said lard severely shortened your life span . ( I thought_about my great-aunts who died in their late 90s , and how the only cooking fat they ' d ever used was lard. ) They told me it had a peculiar odor and a bad taste . When I tried the commercial lard available in New York , I understood what they meant . I ' d grown_up on home-rendered lard , made from pigs lovingly fed_on the scraps of my mother ' s delicious cooking and on the corn and acorns from our ranch . Store-bought lard is nowhere as good . * No wonder people were avoiding lard . &quot; People are so proud_of not eating something they would n ' t eat anyway , &quot; Kurt Vonnegut told me one recent afternoon . I grew_up on a cattle_ranch in northern Mexico . There were no stores around for 50 miles , and we grew our own food . So when it was zucchini season , we ate zucchini almost every day , and when we killed a cow , we ate beef every day . But when we killed a pig , we could have an endless array of flavors . Pig butchering was always a cause for celebration . All the ranch women would congregate in my mother ' s kitchen to gossip , laugh and turn every part of the pig into some delicacy . One of the legs was made into chorizo sausage ; another would be cut_into thin strips , coated with red chile paste and air-dried for carne adobado . Still another leg was given to the cowboys , and my father would make a ham with the remaining one . The skin and the feet would be pickled . Even the blood was used -- it went_into an aromatic morcilla ( blood_sausage ) . As for the fat , huge tubs were set_out on the barbecue pit for rendering it into lard . As a byproduct , this produced scrumptious chicharrones ( cracklings ) , with their crunchy bits of meat sticking_to the fat . My sister Aida would eat the fat and throw_away the meat -- I would eat the meat and throw_away the fat . And we liked the rendered lard itself so_much ( especially the sediment , with its crunchy bits of crackling ) that we would spread it on freshly made corn tortillas in place of butter . * The feast always ended with a joyful tamalada , a tamale-making party . We ' d beat the cornmeal masa with the lard until it floated , spread it on corn husks and roll_up the tamales with a filling of meat from the pig ' s head and the butt , cooked with lots of garlic , oregano and peppercorns , shredded and mixed with red chile salsa . When I give cooking lessons , I defend lard . I tell my students that it is the most misunderstood of fats ; according to the USDA it has less than half as much cholesterol as butter . On the other hand , it contains a large amount of oleic_acid , which actually helps break_down cholesterol . ( After one of those classes , the food writer Peggy Knickerbocker told me the Lard Trade Board should make me their spokes-model , the way the Avocado Trade Board hired Angie Dickinson a_few years ago . I politely declined the suggestion , not because I had any serious quarrel with lard but because I did not want to be the butt of lard jokes. ) Considering lard ' s present disrepute , it ' s difficult to believe that up until the ' 20s , when commercial oils and shortenings started making an appearance , lard was the principal cooking fat in this country . Cooks trusted lard . When vegetable shortening came_on the market , Crisco tried to look as much like lard as possible . * Pork and all its products have been used since the Neolithic Age , when man learned to grow crops and domesticate animals and settled_down to live_in villages , where there was a steady supply of food . The sheep and goats helped clear the land of weeds and wild grasses to make_way for crops . Pigs could not digest grasses and weeds , but they could be fed_on scraps from the table . They were a walking garbage_disposal -- or let ' s say , recycling -- system . Once salting and smoking were discovered as methods of preservation , pork became even more valuable . The lean , dry , stringy meat of goats and sheep is less suited to these methods than pork . Preserved , the pig guaranteed a supply of food for the lean winter months . Fattening pigs became a central part of family life and started as soon as the piglets were weaned . In many places the butchering of pigs coincided with the time of harvest . It was a time of rejoicing , and pork and its fat soon became associated with holidays . Witness the Christmas ham or suckling pig of today , and the sweets made with lard ( such_as bizcochos ) or fried in it ( the Italian sfince , the Latin_American bunuelos ) . Montse Guillen , a Catalan chef , once told me that though she cooks with olive_oil , she always adds a spoonful of lard for flavor . George Lang , the famed restaurateur and author of &quot; The Cuisine of Hungary &quot; ( Atheneum : 1971 ) , says : &quot; When making dishes with paprika , the Hungarians use lard almost exclusively , because the burning point of lard allows the paprika to release a higher percentage of its color and flavors. &quot; * Pork is so important in China that the word for meat literally means pork . Until the extraction of oils from plant sources was perfected in this century , lard was used in Chinese cooking both for deep frying and stir-frying . Cookbook author Barbara Tropp writes that it is still used in shrimp pastes and dim sum pastry_doughs . Pork was important in Europe too , and not just in the Germanic and Slavic lands . Paula Wolfert quotes a chef in &quot; The Cooking of Southwest France &quot; ( Harper &amp; Row : 1983 ) as saying , &quot; You must understand how important the pig is to us . It is the basis of our cuisine. &quot; Before the Spanish arrived , the indigenous people of Mexico used no fats at all ; frying was completely unknown . But when the pig was introduced , lard began to appear in everything from refried beans and tamales to crisply fried tacos . Even stewed dishes often contain a step where ingredients are fried ; lard beautifully melds the flavors and textures in moles and pipianes . It is still a favorite Mexican cooking fat . However , most Mexican cooks are using safflower and other oils these days because they ' re cheaper . * Another factor_in lard ' s fall from popularity , of course , was the discovery of the connection between cholesterol and animal_fats such_as lard , butter and beef_tallow . But fats and oils , which differ mainly in that fats are solid at room_temperature , have more in common chemically than people think . Both are made_up of a glycerol molecule linked with three compounds belonging_to the group known as the fatty_acids . Now , a fatty_acid molecule is a chain of carbon , oxygen and hydrogen_atoms . The length of this hydrocarbon chain varies , but there is a maximum number of hydrogen atoms it can have . If a molecule has its full capacity of hydrogen , it is called saturated . If it has two fewer hydrogen_atoms , it ' s mono-unsaturated , and if it has room for four or more hydrogen atoms it ' s polyunsaturated . Though shortening and margarine are made from plant sources , they have to be hydrogenated to give them a solid consistency . Hydrogenated -- that is , saturated . They ' re still plant_products , but the health benefits of mono- or polyunsaturation have suddenly diminished . The hydrogenation process also produces trans-fatty acids , which are considered to be as harmful as saturated fats in causing coronary heart_disease . And the hydrogenation process also lowers the smoke point ( the temperature at which fats break_down into gas ) . Smoking margarine or shortening doesn ' t just smell bad , it produces chemically active materials that remain in the liquid and may ruin the flavor of fried foods . And the scorching also produces the chemicals classed as free_radicals , which have been associated with cancer . * While vegetable_oils have a smoke point of 450 degrees , hydrogenated shortenings smoke at 370 degrees . Lard , however , has a smoke point of 400 degrees . When it ' s flavor and crisp texture you want , lard makes an excellent fat for pan- or deep-frying . Because lard has a grainy texture , its coarser and less homogeneous particles separate the gluten from each other in dough , producing wonderfully flaky crusts . In doughs made with the rolling-and-folding method , it isolates whole sheets of dough from each other . This is true of home-rendered lard , but less true of the homogenized varieties available in most grocery_stores . Lard has a place in the kitchen , not only because biochemically it is not as great a villain as it has been made_out to be -- it ' s superior to other saturated fats and contains large amounts of beneficial fatty_acids , namely oleic_acid , which helps keep arteries unclogged -- but because in some dishes no other fat will do . Most of the dishes at my restaurant are not made with lard , but there are some I just won ' t make without it . Que viva manteca ! * &quot; En escabeche &quot; means pickled in vinegar . &quot; I don ' t know what makes this a crazy escabeche , &quot; says Martinez . &quot; that ' s just what it ' s called. &quot; The cinnamon called_for here , as in most Mexican recipes , is true or Ceylon_cinnamon , which is paler and more delicate than what we call cinnamon in this country ( American &quot; cinnamon &quot; is more correctly called cassia ) . Quintana Roo oregano comes from a tree , rather than a shrub , and has long leaves that turn black when they dry . Ordinary or Mexican oregano can be substituted for it . TURKEY IN CRAZY ESCABECHE ( Pavo en Escabeche Loco ) 1 ( 12-pound ) turkey , quartered 2 heads garlic 1 / 2 pound lard Salt 1 large red_onion 1 cup white vinegar 8 large leaves Quintana Roo oregano , or 1 1 / 2 teaspoons Mexican oregano 1 ( 3-inch ) stick Ceylon_cinnamon 6 cloves 1 teaspoon cumin_seeds 4 allspice berries Scant 1 / 4 cup whole peppercorns 1 bunch cilantro 1 bunch radishes , trimmed and thinly sliced 1 head romaine , shredded Rinse turkey inside and out and pat dry with paper_towels . Roast garlic heads on ungreased griddle over low heat , turning frequently , until soft , about 30 minutes . Let cool . Remove skin from garlic and mash softened cloves with fork . Mix garlic with lard and salt to taste . Rub turkey skin all_over with mixture . Place rack over turkey roaster or large baking dish . Add 1 / 2 inch water to dish . Arrange turkey pieces on rack , place in oven and cook at 350 degrees until half done , about 45 minutes . Slice red_onion thinly or cut_into 1 / 4-inch dice . Cover onion with boiling water , let rest 2 minutes and drain . Add 1 / 2 cup vinegar and salt to taste . Reserve . While turkey cooks , grind oregano , cinnamon , cloves , cumin , allspice and peppercorns in spice grinder or blender . Mince cilantro . Add cilantro and remaining 1 / 2 cup vinegar to spices . When turkey is 1 / 2 done , remove from oven and rub all_over with vinegar and spices . Return to oven and continue to cook until done , about 45 more minutes . Remove from oven and let rest until cool enough to handle . Turkey may be served in pieces at this point . Remove turkey skin . Shred meat , discarding cartilage . Combine shredded meat with cooking juices and pickled onion . Serve with radishes and romaine . Makes 12 servings . Each serving contains about : 548 calories ; 210 mg sodium ; 236 mg cholesterol ; 30 grams fat ; 4 grams carbohydrates ; 61 grams protein ; 0.25 gram fiber . * These Central_American filled tortillas are known as pupusas in San Salvador . In Mexico , where they are called tlacoyos , they ' re shaped like a huarache ( sandal ) , by which name they are also known . They ' re often sold on the street at stands called agachados ( &quot; hunched-over ones &quot; ) , which have no seating , so the customers eat standing_up , hunched_over the counter . The fillings for tlacoyos vary , but beans are especially popular . When topped with salsa fresca , some sliced longaniza ( a spicy sausage ) and shredded queso fresco ( fresh Mexican cheese ) , they make a great appetizer or even a light dinner . Most of the ingredients , including the queso fresco , masa harina and longaniza , are available in Latino grocery_stores . BEAN-STUFFED CORN TORTILLAS ( Tlacoyos ) 1 tablespoon lard 1 small onion , thickly sliced 1 cup pureed cooked black_beans 2 cups masa harina Warm water 1 / 2 cup crumbled queso fresco , optional 1 / 2 pound sauteed sliced longaniza or chorizo sausage , optional Fresh salsa , optional Before beginning , prepare anti-stick liner for tortilla press by cutting open 2 sides of 1 medium-size ( 6-inch-square ) heavy plastic bag , such_as zip-closing freezer storage bag , to make rectangle at least 12x6 inches . Heat lard over medium-high heat in small , heavy pan until melted lard ripples . Add onion and fry , stirring often , until browned , about 5 minutes . Remove and discard onion . Add pureed black_beans to lard , reduce heat to low and cook , stirring often , until mixture has reduced to smooth paste , about 10 minutes . Combine masa harina and 1 cup warm water in medium-sized bowl . Using wooden spoon or hands , mix to form smooth , somewhat stiff dough . Add more water as needed . If using fresh masa , place in bowl and work with wet hands to check consistency . If it is crumbly , work in water by tablespoons until masa holds together . Dampen hands with cold water and shake_off excess . Shape dough into 10 to 12 equal balls , about size of ping pong balls . Dampen hands again as needed . Take 1 ball , pat to form 3-inch circle and place 1 teaspoon bean puree in center . Fold sides of tortilla over bean puree and roll carefully back into ball shape . Repeat with remaining balls . Keep balls covered with damp towel while working to prevent drying_out . Heat griddle or cast-iron skillet over high heat until drop of water sizzles on contact . Using paper_towel dampened with vegetable_oil , quickly rub surface to grease . Open tortilla press and place plastic liner in it with creased edge next to hinge . Place 1 ball dough in center of press between flaps of plastic , then lower top of press and press_down lightly on handle to make tortilla 4 to 5 inches wide and about 1 / 10 inch thick . Open press . Peel top flap of plastic off , lift_out tortilla and peel away bottom flap , dampening hands again if needed . Place tlacoyo on hot griddle and cook until lightly flecked with brown on under side , about 1 1 / 2 minutes . Turn with spatula and cook 1 to 1 1 / 2 minutes on other side . Repeat with remaining balls . To serve , place warm tortillas on plates and top with cheese and sausage . Serve with salsa . Makes 10 to 12 tlacoyos , about 6 appetizer servings , 3 entree servings . Each of 10 tlacoyos , without optional ingredients , contains about : 100 calories ; 1 mg sodium ; 1 mg cholesterol ; 2 grams fat ; 18 grams carbohydrates ; 3 grams protein ; 0.33 gram fiber . * These lard cookies come_out crisp if they ' re rolled thin , puffy if they ' re rolled thick . If you have the decorative bizcocho cutters sold in Mexico and the Southwest , you can cut them into shapes of birds , flowers , suits of cards and other fanciful images . This is one case where Martinez prefers cassia to true cinnamon for a Mexican recipe , because cassia has a sharper flavor . Recipe from &quot; Food From My Heart. &quot; HOLIDAY COOKIES ( Bizcochos ) 1 / 2 pound lard 1 cup sugar 1 jumbo or 2 medium eggs Grated zest 1 orange 3 to 3 1 / 2 cups unbleached flour 1 1 / 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 / 4 teaspoon salt 1 to 2 tablespoons orange_juice , optional 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon Cream lard in large mixing_bowl with spoon or electric_mixer until light and fluffy . Beat_in 1 / 2 cup sugar little at time . Beat_in egg and orange_rind . Sift flour , baking powder and salt together in bowl . Add flour mixture to creamed lard mixture about 1 cup at time , beating well after each addition . After 3 cups flour are added , dough should be smooth and workable , somewhat stiff . If it seems too loose , beat_in up_to 1 / 2 cup more flour . If too hard to mix , add_up to 2 tablespoons orange_juice . Refrigerate dough until thoroughly chilled , 30 to 40 minutes . On lightly floured surface , roll_out dough about 1 / 8-inch thick and cut with cookie cutters ( or pipe onto ungreased baking sheet using large pastry bag fitted with No . 5 star tip ) . Bake on ungreased baking sheet at 350 degrees until edges are golden , about 10 to 12 minutes . Combine cinnamon and remaining 1 / 2 cup sugar in bowl and roll cookies in mixture . Makes about 36 small cookies . Each cookie contains about : 119 calories ; 38 mg sodium ; 18 mg cholesterol ; 7 grams fat ; 13 grams carbohydrates ; 1 gram protein ; 0.03 gram fiber . * If you don ' t have a tamale steamer , Martinez recommends propping a cake rack on sawed-off tin_cans in a large stockpot or Dutch_oven , or placing the tamales directly on the bottom of a large Dutch_oven and leaning them tepee-style against a central prop such_as a large ball of wadded aluminum_foil ( if the tamales are tightly wrapped , they will not leak when you add the 1 inch of boiling water needed for steaming ) . Remember that water evaporates faster in a wider pot . Banana leaves and piloncillo ( conical loaves of brown_sugar ) are available in most Mexican markets . Recipe from &quot; Food From My Heart. &quot; OAXACAN PUMPKIN TAMALES ( Tamales Miahuatecos ) 1 pound banana leaves , thawed if frozen 2 heaping cups masa harina 2 to 2 1 / 2 cups warm chicken_stock or water 1 / 2 pound lard 2 cups pureed cooked or canned pumpkin or winter_squash , drained if watery 1 1 / 2 teaspoons ground Ceylon_cinnamon or 1 / 2 teaspoon cassia cinnamon 3 ounces piloncillo , grated or crushed , or 1 / 2 cup firmly packed dark-brown sugar Salt Bean Filling Unfold banana leaves , being careful not to split them unnecessarily . Wipe with clean damp cloth and pat dry . With kitchen scissors , trim leaves into 12 to 14 rectangles , each about 14x11 inches . Save some of longer trimmings . Mix masa harina in bowl or pot with enough warm stock to make soft but not sticky dough . Beat lard in separate large bowl on medium speed until very_light and fluffy . Add masa harina mixture and pumpkin puree to lard little at time , beating on medium speed and scraping down as needed . Mixture should be as light as butter cream . Beat_in cinnamon , piloncillo and salt to taste . Place 1 or 2 banana leaf rectangles flat on work space . Tear_off some long , thin strips from reserved banana leaf trimmings . Place 2 / 3 to 1 cup masa mixture in center of leaf and with spatula or fingers spread into 3x4x1 / 2-inch-thick oval . Place 1 heaping tablespoon Bean Filling_in center of oval . Fold right and left edges of banana leaf toward center to meet , overlapping little to cover filling , then fold top and bottom edges to center to make neat , flat package about 4x5 inches . Fasten by tying with thin strip of banana leaf . Repeat with remaining banana leaves , masa and filling . Place tamales flat in steamer , seam-side-up , arranging in layers as necessary . Place some extra banana leaves on top to help tamales absorb steam . Steam , covered tightly , over boiling water 1 hour , replenishing with hot water as needed . Remove steamer basket and let tamales rest 10 minutes before serving . Makes 12 to 14 tamales . Each of 12 tamales contains about : 351 calories ; 184 mg sodium ; 20 mg cholesterol ; 22 grams fat ; 33 grams carbohydrates ; 6 grams protein ; 1.13 grams fiber . Bean Filling 2 cups water 2 teaspoons anise 2 to 3 dried Oaxacan pasilla or dried or canned chipotle chiles 2 to 2 1 / 2 cups cooked or canned black_beans , drained 5 to 6 garlic_cloves , peeled 2 tablespoons lard Salt Put water in small pan , add anise and boil until reduced by half . Strain and reserve infusion . If using Oaxacan pasilla or dried chipotles , cover with boiling water and let soak until softened , about 10 minutes . Drain and remove stems . Canned chipotles need no preparation . Working in batches , if necessary , puree beans with chiles , garlic and anise infusion in blender or food_processor fitted with steel blade . Melt lard in heavy skillet or wide , shallow saucepan over high heat . When very hot , add bean puree , watching for splatters . Reduce heat to medium and simmer , uncovered , stirring occasionally to prevent sticking , until liquid is evaporated . Season to taste with salt . Cool to room_temperature .
