   <TEXT> Cities and school districts throughout Orange County slammed the brakes Tuesday on expenditures and projects , many of them in the works for years . Off the planning_boards for now is a $ 17.5-million extension of Newport Coast Drive that would have provided a toll-free bypass connecting Irvine to Newport Beach . In Foothill Ranch , school trustees delayed the ballyhooed opening next month of a new elementary_school . Brea city officials postponed the groundbreaking for a $ 7-million community_center , scheduled for later this week . And that was not all . The reverberations from the widening financial crisis continued to shake many of the 187 cities , school_systems and special districts that have relied_on Orange County to invest their savings . Officials said Tuesday that they were acting to protect their remaining assets , deferring all but the most necessary expenditures until the situation is clearer . &quot; We ' re still in the shock mode , in the grieving mode , &quot; Fullerton City_Manager James L . Armstrong said after hearing the news Tuesday that the county investment pool had lost 27 % of its value since January . &quot; Obviously , I ' m angry . You entrusted your money to somebody who you thought was managing it appropriately and they weren ' t. &quot; Jeff Niven , Irvine ' s manager of finance and fiscal services , said he was particularly irked Tuesday to learn that the county treasury continued to borrow money and tie investments to interest_rates this spring . He and other local officials learned Tuesday that the money they had entrusted to Orange County ' s investment pool may have dropped even more in value than previously feared . &quot; You invest some money and the next day , it ' s gone . Ouch ! &quot; Niven said . &quot; To deposit money in the county four months ago and incur a 27 % loss is staggering. &quot; One week after the county declared bankruptcy and froze all funds in the ill-fated pool , officials of the agencies that had participated were struggling to come_to terms with news that seemed to grow worse with each passing day . Several said their latest actions -- including hiring freezes and postponing numerous capital improvement projects -- could be reversed or modified should the situation prove to be less serious than feared . But few of those interviewed Tuesday appeared to hold_out much hope . La Habra City_Manager Lee Risner , who announced that the city was instituting a hiring freeze and deferring three flood-control projects , was openly hostile toward county officials . &quot; Until we see that the county is serious about paying_out money , we ' ll have to hold a lot of things , &quot; Risner said , including park development , storm drain repairs and street projects . Public offices throughout the county were tallying the losses Tuesday . Among the most common actions were postponement of planned construction projects . In Irvine , officials said they have been told by the county and its toll-road agency that there is no money right now for a $ 17.5-million extension of Newport Coast Drive that would have provided a toll-free bypass to a section of the San Joaquin Hills toll road . Assemblyman Gil Ferguson ( R-Newport Beach ) , confirmed that the county financial crisis would probably scuttle it . In Huntington Beach , officials announced that they had postponed indefinitely the construction , set to begin Jan . 2 , of a new Ruby ' s restaurant at the end of the pier . The project had been planned for three years . &quot; We ' d be foolish to blindly spend our money on . . . capital outlays without finding_out where we ' re going and where we are down the road , &quot; said Richard Barnard , Huntington Beach deputy city administrator . Brea officials postponed breaking ground on a $ 7-million community_center , scheduled for a construction start this week . Assistant City_Manager Tim O ' Donnell called the move a precautionary measure . The city of Anaheim has put $ 86.5 million in capital improvement projects on hold , most involving the planned widening of the Santa Ana Freeway , city officials said at a council meeting Tuesday . Other planned but now postponed expenditures included sewer improvements along the freeway corridor and three separate high-occupancy-vehicle-lane projects . The city , which has $ 167 million invested in the county pool , also has begun a detailed cash-flow analysis and has hired a portfolio and investment_adviser and a law_firm specializing in bankruptcies . Anaheim City School District officials said Tuesday they are holding_off on building a new Head_Start facility at one elementary_school and putting_off repairing the drainage_system at another . District Supt . Meliton Lopez remained optimistic that his district would recover all_of its money in the fund , despite the sharp drop_in the fund ' s value , but the district has ceased all non-essential spending , he said . &quot; We ' re not replacing textbooks that are lost , we have canceled all seminars , workshops , anything teachers were planning to attend that would require a substitute , &quot; Lopez said . In other cities and school districts , hiring was the No . 1 issue on managers ' minds . The Orange Unified School District put negotiations with the teachers union on indefinite hold , Supt . Robert L . French said . In Los Alamitos , the city suspended contract negotiations with the Los Alamitos Police_Officers Assn . until early next year , City_Manager Robert C . Dunek said . At the Irvine Unified School District , selection of a new superintendent will be slowed by the bankruptcy , officials said ; the district does not yet know whether it will have the money to hire a search firm . And plans for a new high_school and elementary_school will also be placed on hold , along with negotiations between teachers and administrators for a new three-year contract . &quot; Every element of this district will be ultimately impacted , &quot; district Clerk Tom Burnham said , reacting to Tuesday ' s news of the county ' s investment loss . &quot; The haircut of 27 % is substantial . It ' s certainly going_to create a lot of pain. &quot; The Fullerton School District was suffering even more basic problems . Supt . Duncan Johnson told the school_board Tuesday night that a vendor refused to fill a $ 5 # 000 purchase_order for audio visual equipment such_as televisions and videotape recorders for use in classrooms . After being turned_down , the district was able to persuade another vendor to fill the order , Johnson said . He did not identify either vendor . Last week , another unidentified vendor refused the district ' s request for 8 # 000 gallons of gas to fuel school_buses -- instead giving the district only 1 # 000 gallons . District officials said Tuesday that they threatened to stop doing business with the vendor , who then filled the rest of the order . The Newport Beach City_Council voted to put_off the purchase of a new firetruck , even though the city could have delayed paying_for the unit for at least a year and saved $ 36 # 000 by making a commitment this week . &quot; I ' m a little queasy about making this kind of a commitment this early on in this kind of an environment , &quot; Mayor John W . Hedges said . Two school districts are holding_off on projects that already have cost them considerable sums . The Saddleback Valley Unified School District has put_off the opening of its new elementary_school in Foothill Ranch . The school was expected to open next month . The county pool contained $ 22 million the district had set_aside for construction projects and needed to tap into in_order to complete the school . Officials said the district also has asked its vendors to hold all shipments of supplies until further notice . In the Capistrano Unified School District , spokeswoman Jacqueline Price said the county ' s financial crisis cut_short a final scheduled $ 2.5-million payment from the pool for an elementary_school site in Aliso Viejo at Sanborn and Wood Canyon Road . District officials had hoped to open a school there in September , 1996 , but that schedule is now in limbo . Nonetheless , Capistrano Supt . James A . Fleming sounded a note of certainty Tuesday that even if the county does not free funds in the pool relatively soon , the state will act to protect the schools . &quot; We feel that the state will not permit schools to go_under or suffer , &quot; Fleming said . Others also tried to remain optimistic , hoping that the latest dose of bad news from the county might somehow spell little in the way of problems for them . Laguna Niguel City_Manager Tim Casey , for example , said the 27 % loss was actually less than many had expected . And no current projects are endangered in his city , he said . &quot; We are only deferring the commencement of some capital improvement projects , &quot; Casey said . Those include a $ 1.5-million street resurfacing project and another $ 3.3 million in improvements to street medians and local parks . City officials in Cypress too said they saw few impacts for their city . City_Manager Darrell Essex , in his job for 32 years , said he saw no immediate changes or hardships for the city . &quot; Everything ' s fairly normal , &quot; he said Tuesday . But frustrated members of the public were not always seeing things the same way . Many were telling_off city or school district officials who had chosen to invest taxpayer money in the ill-fated pool . At a meeting of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District on Tuesday night , Yorba Linda resident Thomas Turk called_for the resignation of the top administrators who had borrowed an extra $ 50 million to invest in the county pool . Addressing school_board members , Turk said , &quot; Each of you brings special talents to the board . None of you are elected for your financial expertise so it ' s understandable that you rely_on the expertise of the management team . That the management team remains in a position of trust is not understandable. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Fund Drop Hits_Home Orange County school districts , cities and water districts have begun to hold_the_line on spending with news of a 27 % drop_in the value of the county-managed fund in which they invested .
