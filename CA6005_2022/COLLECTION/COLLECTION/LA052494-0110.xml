   <HEADLINE> ETHNIC DISCORD ; THREAT OF U.N. PULLOUT RAISES A ' NIGHTMARE SCENARIO ' IN BOSNIA ; FRUSTRATIONS HAVE LED TO CALLS FOR DEADLINES ON TROOP USE . THE BLUE-HELMETED LIFELINE WOULD COLLAPSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Threats by Western countries to pull U.N. troops out of embattled Bosnia may be as hard to deliver on as earlier promises to protect civilians here , but the prospect has nevertheless stirred fears of devastating consequences for all_of the Balkans . As fighting in the region grinds through its third year and hopes for a negotiated solution evaporate , fatigue and frustration have prompted countries contributing troops to the U.N. command to impose deadlines for a peaceful settlement or a pullout . France has put UNPROFOR , the U.N. Protection Force , on notice that it will cut its 6 # 800-troop contingent by 2 # 500 , and Britain has threatened to withdraw all 3 # 300 of its soldiers if the Bosnian government and Serbian nationalist rebels have not made_peace in two months . While those and similar warnings by other NATO-member countries give the impression of a new , get-tough attitude with the Bosnian combatants , the consequences of such a pullout could be lopsided and would almost guarantee a widening of the war . British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , the U.N. commander for 15 # 000 troops in Bosnia , said in interviews he is certain all sides recognize that a pullout would lead to &quot; a nightmare scenario. &quot; &quot; If we go , who is going_to feed the 2.7 million people here who are totally dependent_on aid ? &quot; Rose asked . &quot; Who is going_to push the peace process ? The cease-fire in Sarajevo would unravel . Even in central Bosnia , where there is already a political agreement , there is the risk that everything would come unstuck. &quot; Without U.N. troops to protect aid convoys trying to reach hungry civilians trapped behind the front_lines , deliveries to besieged pockets and this encircled capital city would have to stop , confirmed Kris Janowski , spokesman for the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees . Sarajevo , which the refugee agency uses as a base for feeding 440 # 000 Bosnians on both sides of the encircling confrontation line , is served by a humanitarian airlift now operated and protected by U.N. forces . &quot; If UNPROFOR pulled_out , the airport would stop functioning and there would probably be a huge escalation in the fighting , &quot; Janowski predicted . &quot; And UNHCR cannot run an airlift under conditions of total warfare. &quot; The eastern Bosnian pockets of Gorazde , Srebrenica and Zepa would also likely lose their aid lifelines , because there would be no U.N. troops or armor to muscle deliveries through the Serbian rebel cordons entrapping more_than 150 # 000 people , mostly Muslims , in those U.N.-designated havens . The United Nations and its aid agency have observed strict neutrality throughout their nearly two years in Bosnia , feeding nearly all_of the population still left here after 200 # 000 deaths and the flight to other countries of as_many as half of the 2 million displaced . But because the dependent Serbian civilians live_in areas adjacent to their patron state of Serbia or Croatian land conquered by fellow Serbs during an earlier phase of the regional war , the nationalist rebels have less at risk with the food pipeline if they defy the peace deadline than the Muslim-led government , whose backers would be left to starve . Despite the inequity of aid deliveries that would result from a U.N. withdrawal , officials of the Balkans force see counter-pressures that they believe should compel the Serbian rebels to quit while they are so far ahead and get what they can through negotiation . &quot; Implicit in a pullout is lifting of the arms embargo , &quot; one officer said , pointing to the mounting pressures in Washington and Western Europe to nullify a 1991 U.N. prohibition of arms deliveries to what was then Yugoslavia but has since fractured into independent republics , each of which holds widely disparate shares of the old federation ' s weapon stockpile . Serbia inherited the arsenal of tanks , heavy guns and aircraft that belonged_to the massive Yugoslav People ' s Army , the fourth-largest force in Europe , which has given its Serbian rebel proxies in Bosnia the military might to conquer more_than 70 % of this republic . &quot; If the U.N. is forced to leave , the chances of the Serbs getting ( U.N.-imposed economic ) sanctions lifted is zero and they have to worry about the Muslims being rearmed , &quot; another European officer noted . &quot; In both respects , time would not be_on the Serbs ' side. &quot; Bosnia ' s Muslims and Croats had been fighting each other in a war-within-a-war until March , when a U.S.-brokered agreement restored their alliance against the Serbian land grab . But the Serbs have so far refused to commit themselves to a proposed Bosnian federation of ethnically based ministates , preferring to press_on with a quest to annex their conquered Bosnian territory to a Greater Serbia . Officials of the Bosnian government have reacted with pique to the threats of a pullout . Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic denounced Britain ' s two-month deadline as an attempt to force the leadership of a U.N.-member state to cave_in to its own destruction . The United States recently joined Russia and European Union nations in_demanding that the Bosnian combatants accept an immediate cease-fire and agree to a split of the territory that would give the Serbian rebels internationally recognized authority over half of this republic . &quot; There does seem to be a attitude throughout the international community now that Bosnia is already dead and it just needs a proper burial , &quot; said a Western diplomat here who regards the ethnic partitioning ordered by the major_powers at their May 13 conference in Geneva as a solution that would be a short-term one at best . Some observers believe , though , that the threats are having the desired effect of confronting the two sides with no other option but to sit_down and negotiate . Mirko Pejanovic , a Bosnian vice_president who is a non-nationalist Serb , said he sees little chance of a U.N. pullout and growing signs that the leadership is ready to compromise on the issue of how long they will cease military activities to give the peace process a chance . The foreign_ministers who met in Geneva insisted that both sides agree to a four-month cease-fire and resume negotiations that deadlocked early this year . The Serbs insist that four months is too short , because they hope to draw_out the negotiations endlessly so as_to strengthen their grip on all_the territory they now hold . The government , fearing that delaying tactic , wants a finite term by which a fair settlement is negotiated or the intransigent party punished for refusing to bargain in good_faith . &quot; Whether it is one , two or three months isn ' t what is important , &quot; Pejanovic contended . &quot; There is no military solution to this conflict , so both sides must realize there is nothing to be gained by continuing to fight. &quot; A well-known political analyst for the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje , Merhet Husic , agrees the risk of a U.N. pullout is extremely slim , for the same reason cited by Pejanovic -- that the two sides are likely to accept the logic of negotiations . But he also believes that the international community ' s prestige is at stake . &quot; They ' re bluffing , &quot; he said of the_British and French threats to withdraw from Bosnia . &quot; They have to be here for the sake of_their_own political futures . They don ' t care about Bosnia , but if they leave this place while war continues , they would be admitting they are nothing , that not even NATO can protect people from senseless killing. &quot; * Despite the obvious dangers of a U.N. pullout , officials warn that political realities in the parliaments of Europe could pressure those governments to put a limit on their patience and a mission whose costs and casualties have become increasingly difficult to defend . &quot; There will come a stage where they have to say , ' that ' s it , ' &quot; Rose ' s aide , Lt . Col . Simon Shadbolt , said of the growing sentiment for giving the combatants an ultimatum to make_peace . &quot; We are not yet at that stage , and the mission will continue . But if we have provided the conditions for the peace process and both sides make clear they do not want peace , there will come a stage where we have to ask ourselves what the hell we ' re doing here. &quot;</TEXT>
