   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEW ; ' FRONTLINE ' COOLLY LOOKS_AT ' MADNESS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Questions , questions and more questions bombard us in &quot; A Place for Madness , &quot; a new &quot; Frontline &quot; report on the deinstitutionalizing of the mentally_ill ( at 8 tonight , KCET-TV Channel 28 ) . A good_deal of the questions , however , seem to have no good answers . The real head-scratching is going_on in Northampton , Mass. , where the state psychiatric_hospital by court_order has permanently closed its doors and released patients -- with few exceptions -- to non-institutional settings . The town , as the report coolly terms it , has become &quot; a national laboratory &quot; as former patients try to integrate into life beyond the hospital . Not only is the place a lab but a debating center_on the issue , and &quot; A Place for Madness &quot; airs every side . Attorney Stephen Schwartz , who engineered the court_order known as &quot; the Northampton consent decree , &quot; is an unflinching advocate and harsh critic of those who would treat the mentally_ill as criminals . * Schwartz doesn ' t even blink at what appear to be very real problems in Northampton . The violent cases are rare , but they still shake_up the townspeople . They especially shook_up the Rev . Leroy Moser and his wife , Jane , whose mentally_ill son , David , is legally free although he once violently assaulted his parents . Massachusetts judges must be shown beyond a reasonable doubt that a mentally_ill defendant is not a threat to himself or others : David ' s judge viewed him as ill , but not a threat , and granted him freedom . As the Mosers reel from this decision , they wonder about a system that prevents them from getting treatment for David , who denies his illness . The balance of public safety and individual liberty is unsure in &quot; A Place for Madness &quot; ; the only certain thing is that the old system of closeting the mentally_ill is a thing of the past .</TEXT>
