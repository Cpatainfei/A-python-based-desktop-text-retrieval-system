   <HEADLINE> ZEDILLO AWAITS CONFIRMATION OF PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY IN MEXICO ; ELECTION : WITH 90 % OF RETURNS COUNTED , OFFICIALS SAY IT IS ' STATISTICALLY CLEAR ' THAT HE IS WINNER . PRD STILL REFUSES TO CONCEDE DEFEAT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ernesto Zedillo , a once-shy shoeshine boy from Mexicali thrust onto center stage by an assassin ' s bullets in March , was all but declared this nation ' s next president Wednesday , extending 65 years of Institutional Revolutionary Party rule into the next century . As the last of a record 35.4 million ballots were being counted from Sunday ' s election , described by many as a watershed of Mexican democracy , the quasi-independent Federal Electoral Institute began a marathon session Wednesday to confirm returns . The public process could take days to complete as opposition representatives and independent commissioners contest ballots from 96 # 000 precincts nationwide . But election officials said it was statistically clear from the 90 % of returns tabulated thus far in the presidential and legislative balloting that Zedillo had defeated his two leading challengers , winning just more_than 50 % of the vote . The PRI also appears to have won a large majority in both the 500-seat Chamber of Deputies and the 128-member Senate . Sunday ' s elections , officials said , drew an unprecedented 77.5 % of Mexico ' s 45.7 million registered voters to the polls . Diego Fernandez de Cevallos -- Zedillo ' s closest rival and a charismatic , conservative criminal lawyer -- did not concede defeat Wednesday ; no loser in a Mexican presidential election has done so this century . Fernandez simply said he would await final word from electoral officials . But , barring proof of massive fraud , most analysts expected his National Action Party representative appearing before the 10-member election_commission to eventually approve the final results . They would give Fernandez 27 % of the vote and the PAN a projected 28 Chamber seats and 24 Senate seats , based on Mexico ' s proportional_representation system . Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , in third place with 17 % of the presidential vote , and his Democratic Revolutionary Party , will receive 13 seats in the Chamber and nine in the Senate , under the commission ' s preliminary results . PRD forces were less conciliatory than those of the PAN . The PRD representative at the election_commission angrily challenged the legitimacy of the entire electoral process dozens of times Wednesday . The party was expected to reject any confirmation of results , which then must also be approved by another election tribunal . Formal declaration of Zedillo ' s status as president-elect can be made only by the next Chamber of Deputies , which convenes for its first session Nov . 1 . Cardenas , alleging massive fraud , is demanding an annulment of the elections and a new vote nationwide . He called_on his supporters to flood Mexico_City ' s historic main plaza Saturday to protest the elections . That protest will provide another barometer of popular support for Cardenas ' claim of fraud . But a similar Cardenas-led protest Tuesday drew just 20 # 000 . On Wednesday , the office of the special prosecutor for election_fraud -- created in July as part of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s electoral reforms -- said it had received just 10 formal , documented complaints of abuses , adding that it is still accepting such claims . There also was an attempt to sabotage the election at its very heart , Jose Carpizo MacGregor , the commission ' s chairman , disclosed Wednesday . Carpizo , who doubles as Mexico ' s appointed Interior Minister , said unknown forces unsuccessfully attempted to plant a computer virus in the election_commission ' s central computers during the count . He said the incident is under investigation . Mexican poll watchers and international visitors monitoring this nation ' s elections for the first time reported a range of ruling party abuses -- from intimidation and ballot-stuffing at the precinct level to the misuse of state resources nationwide for electioneering . Most incidents , they said , occurred in remote , rural_areas that delivered the late PRI vote surge that pushed Zedillo over the 50 % mark . But most monitors agreed that the illegalities and irregularities they witnessed appeared to have had no major impact on the presidential vote . There was , however , continuing concern Wednesday about the possible disenfranchisement of an unknown number of Mexicans , who were directed to special polling_places set_up for voters to cast ballots while_away from their home districts . Many reported that the polling_places ran_out of ballots before they could vote . This also affected a large_number of voters who had official credentials but whose names did not appear on a new , $ 730-million registration list . They also were sent to the special polling sites , where they too complained of insufficient ballots . The election_commission is investigating if the names were deliberately excised from the lists -- a process known here as &quot; shaving &quot; the vote -- or if the problem was unintentional . Besides these problems , the independent poll watchers agreed that the ruling party also had built-in advantages in the elections . After six decades in power , the PRI has become inseparable from the institutions of government , a reality Zedillo has acknowledged and vowed to reform during his six-year term , which officially begins Dec . 1 . With a higher margin of victory than initial returns had indicated , it was unclear whether Zedillo ' s new administration would adhere to his pledges of fundamental party reform . The promises were a key factor for many voters who selected the PRI , according to opinion polls and exit interviews before and during the elections . For Fernandez , the need for just such change led to his bottom-line assessment of Mexico ' s new , improved electoral process . &quot; I cannot bless it , &quot; he said , &quot; nor can I damn it. &quot; In a wide-ranging session with reporters , Fernandez outlined specific reforms Zedillo must put_in place if he is to convince Mexicans that Sunday ' s elections were the dawn of a new age of Mexican democracy . Fernandez spoke_of still-feared &quot; mafias &quot; within the government that &quot; pretend at total change , but a change that will leave everything the same. &quot; He condemned the PRI abuse of power in the elections , echoing the observation of many of the foreign visitors that the party blatantly threatened to withhold government subsidies to poor farmers , effectively buying millions of votes_in the rural_areas . He cast himself in a new role as a catalyst for change , saying , &quot; No one can imagine another six years with more of the same. &quot; He said he would not retire from politics but would work urgently to dismantle what he said was the undemocratic PRI machine . Fernandez also criticized his fellow opposition rival for having &quot; shored_up the official system. &quot; &quot; Paradoxically , for all that he has highlighted against the system , Cardenas has justified many_a vote_in favor of the government candidate , &quot; Fernandez said . &quot; His belligerent attitude and his intolerance have encouraged a fainthearted vote for the government ' s candidate. &quot; Cardenas offered no response Wednesday , indicating that he was saving his comments for the weekend rally . But other independent observers saw great import in Sunday ' s vote . Sergio Aguayo -- the respected chairman of an umbrella pro-democracy group formed to monitor and assess the elections -- said the balloting was a landmark event in Mexican history , if only because it showed the immediate need for reform . &quot; From the perspective of a nonpartisan citizen , the presidential elections give many reasons to celebrate , lament and reflect , &quot; he said in a report that included his Civic Alliance ' s findings of widespread irregularities in the polls . He recalled all_the turbulence that had occurred in this election year , including : an armed peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas ; the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio , the PRI ' s original presidential candidate ; economic uncertainty , and a bitter election battle . Aguayo echoed the view of many voters in concluding that &quot; 1994 has been one of the most turbulent and unstable years in our history. &quot; Such events might explain why voters had shown a conservative streak , bolstering Zedillo ' s apparent victory after a campaign in which he cast himself as the only safe change and the only choice for stability and peace .</TEXT>
