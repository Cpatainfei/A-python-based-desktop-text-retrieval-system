   <TEXT> As the Federal Aviation Administration weighed recommendations more_than two years ago that it require more landing distance between Boeing 757 jetliners and planes following behind them , the agency found itself trying to serve two oft-competing masters : the welfare of the public it is charged to protect and the industry it was formed to promote . At the root of recent revelations that the FAA had repeated warnings that 757s produced dangerous wake turbulence lies a harsh economic reality : The agency knew any landing restriction it imposed would mean flight reductions and further revenue losses for an industry that has gone $ 10 billion in the red since 1990 . Following the Dec . 15 crash of a corporate jet in Santa Ana that flew into 757 wake turbulence , killing all five people aboard , and a similar accident that killed eight people in December , 1992 , many observers believe the FAA may have chosen the industry ' s rail-thin profit_margin over the public ' s safety margin . The FAA took no action on the 757 turbulence issue -- until recently -- despite compelling evidence from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , the United Kingdom ' s Civil Aviation Authority and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . &quot; You can make a safety recommendation , but then the economic factors come_in to play , &quot; said Leo Garodz , a former FAA manager who was among the first to bring the 757 wake turbulence problem to the agency ' s attention . An FAA specialist in wake turbulence for 20 years , Garodz said his 1991 recommendations on the 757 were not made lightly , but he is sympathetic to the FAA ' s plight . &quot; You ' re between the_devil and the deep blue sea . On the one hand , you ' ve got safety . On the other , you ' ve got the industry. &quot; The reason for the dilemma , critics say , is easy enough to illustrate : On average , 74 Boeing 757s land every day at Los Angeles International Airport , mostly during peak travel hours . Other jets must remain at least three miles behind . If the FAA landing distance requirement was increased by two miles and made mandatory -- as some have suggested be done_in the wake of the accidents -- it would effectively push_back all_of the planes bound for the airport . To the airlines , it could mean roughly 30 fewer jets could land during peak travel days . At an average of 200 passengers per plane , the lost revenue is significant . And that ' s just one airport -- multiply that times the number of airports in the country and you can see how quickly it adds_up to millions of dollars in lost opportunity . FAA spokesman Fred O ' Donnell in Los Angeles acknowledged that the agency does have twin missions : to keep the skies safe and &quot; to foster the growth of civil aviation. &quot; But he said it was an &quot; oversimplification &quot; to characterize the 757 decision-making process as a safety-versus-money matter . He said the evidence given to the FAA over the past two years , while compelling to many , was inconclusive to the FAA . Since the fall of 1991 , at least two formal reports on the potential dangers of 757 wake turbulence were presented to the FAA , in addition to anecdotal evidence garnered from pilots by NASA ' s Aviation Safety Reporting System . One of the reports , a study by Garodz and Kirk Clawson , a NOAA researcher , concluded that the medium-sized 757 appeared to generate the most powerful wake turbulence they had ever measured -- more powerful than aircraft nearly four times its size . The researchers recommended to the FAA that it immediately require smaller planes be kept four miles behind 757s on final approach under all circumstances and that further testing be done . Wake turbulence occurs when a jet speeds through the air , leaving an invisible , but potentially lethal trail of horizontal cyclones that spring out from each wingtip . Such turbulence can cause even mid-sized jets to pitch violently , but it can toss around smaller aircraft like mere toys . The most recent accident believed to have been linked to 757 wake turbulence claimed the lives of two executives of the In-N-Out burger chain when a twin-engine jet landing about two miles behind a 757 at John Wayne Airport went_out of control . Garodz said his and Clawson ' s landing distance recommendations &quot; went_over like a lead balloon &quot; because &quot; there always is pressure from the industry to close_down separation distances. &quot; In fact , Garodz said , when the FAA embarked_on the study , which also called_for testing the large Boeing 767 , it harbored hopes that the results would allow it to decrease the existing separation requirements for those two aircraft . So did United Airlines , which proffered aircraft to use in the study . &quot; United Airlines believes the potential benefit of this scientific test -- proving that airport capacity can be increased 5 to 10 % by safely reducing the separation between planes -- justifies its contribution of aircraft and crew_members for this study , &quot; James M . Guyette , a United executive_vice_president , said at the time . Garodz and Clawson also advised the FAA that the space requirement for the 767 -- six miles for smaller aircraft -- not be reduced . That , too , was greeted with &quot; less than enthusiasm , &quot; Garodz said . &quot; Nobody likes delays , &quot; he said . &quot; They want to bring the planes closer and increase traffic flow. &quot; To this day , the FAA says it regularly receives proposals from airline carriers , manufacturers and airports to increase the number of passengers they handle by decreasing space requirements between aircraft . The reason : because the bottom_line in aircraft spacing is just that , the bottom_line . Industry experts say the distances planes are kept_apart are designed to maximize the number of paying passengers filing through airports -- and therefore , industry profits -- while meeting acceptable safety criteria . Increasing that distance can mean reductions in flights and delays . And in the commercial aviation industry , minutes can mean millions . According to the FAA , an average delay of just 10 minutes per flight -- which would be a minor annoyance to a passenger -- at an airport the size of Seattle-Tacoma International results in a combined $ 93-million in losses for the airlines . In 1991 , according to an FAA report , 23 of the nation ' s largest airports each suffered more_than $ 32 million in losses , solely due_to delays , many of which occurred because the approach routes to those destinations were so packed with planes . The problem is , there is only so_much navigable airspace to go_around , and every airline wants to be in it during convenient flying hours , from dawn to dusk . Any lengthening of distance requirements between aircraft makes_for fewer flights and fewer opportunities for takeoffs and landings during optimal flying times . &quot; They ' ll never say it , but the FAA is in the business of keeping aircraft moving , &quot; said pilot Peter Murray , who has flown commercial jets for 28 years and regularly skippers 757s . &quot; It basically comes_down to dollars and cents. &quot; All of which makes hard-hit airline carriers more interested in reducing airplane separation standards , which would allow them to land more planes , more frequently , and would improve their bottom_lines in tight fiscal times with existing resources . In fact , said John O ' Brien from the Air Line Pilots Assn. , which often finds itself fighting for increased space between aircraft for safety reasons , &quot; We see much more interest in doing these things when people are looking_for a way to better themselves economically. &quot; The FAA acknowledges there is a direct_correlation between the lack of navigable airspace and aircraft separation requirements , and it is an area of concern &quot; to the FAA and the entire industry , &quot; spokesman O ' Donnell said . Listed among the goals of the FAA ' s 1991 annual report on the airport capacity problem : &quot; More efficient spacing along the final approach path. &quot; &quot; The FAA ' s position is that there is insufficient capacity in this country to meet the projected needs , &quot; O ' Donnell said . Despite the fact that the FAA has recently taken actions that suggest the 757 could be re-classified as a &quot; heavy &quot; jet , which could require up_to two miles of increased spacing , from four miles to six miles , for smaller tailing aircraft , the agency strongly asserted that it did not sacrifice safety by ignoring the data it had received . However , it was with no information other_than the two recent crashes that prompted FAA Administrator David Hinson to issue a bulletin Dec . 22 , instructing the nation ' s air traffic controllers to inform pilots landing behind 757s they are following a &quot; B-757 &quot; and should be aware of potentially heavy turbulence . O ' Donnell said the agency would never compromise the &quot; traveling public &quot; or the &quot; public that lives under the flight path. &quot; But , he said , &quot; we do recognize that certain orders will have a definite economic impact . We have to be realistic , &quot; he said . &quot; We have to ask , ' Will this create an economic hardship that will destroy the industry ? ' &quot; We are concerned about the economic viability of an air carrier and whether or not they stay in business , &quot; he said . &quot; But we will not compromise safety . . . just for the sake of allowing that business to stay in business. &quot; While the FAA looks_out for airline manufacturers and carriers , O ' Donnell said , the agency does not shirk from taking a tough stand . He referred to the Noise and Capacity Act of 1991 , which required by the year 2000 that the industry phase_out older models such_as 727s , 747s and DC-9s in favor of quieter , more fuel-efficient , twin-engine aircraft such_as the 757 , 767 and the new 777 . &quot; The airline industry did not like it , &quot; said O ' Donnell . &quot; They maintained that it would force many of them out of business . Nevertheless , we felt there was a need to do that , and we did it. &quot; For its part , Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese said the company , which has been hit hard by recession and in February announced the phasing out of 28 # 000 jobs over the next two years , would need to &quot; examine closely &quot; any proposal to increase separation distances for the 757 . In addition to the concern about increased delays , Reese said , there is another complication : Many environmentally sensitive airports , such_as John Wayne in Orange County , bar aircraft classified as &quot; heavy. &quot; Reclassifying the 757 as a &quot; heavy &quot; would likely make the aircraft builder ' s third most popular jet less marketable , experts say . &quot; Slots are few and airports are real crowded , &quot; Reese said . &quot; You try to get the airplanes in and out as fast as you can. &quot; At a minimum , aviation sources say , even if the FAA didn ' t want to adopt stricter spacing requirements when it first learned of the 757 ' s dangerous wake turbulence problem , it was obliged to alert pilots so they could take extra precautions . Murray , the commercial jet pilot , said air traffic controllers are very busy and frequently encourage pilots to fly under visual-flight rules , which takes much of the responsibility for maintaining a safe distance between aircraft off the controller ' s shoulders . &quot; It ' s obvious with this wake vortex problem you can ' t just tell a small-plane pilot , ' There ' s a Boeing 757 in front of you , good_luck . You ' re on your own. ' &quot; He has no way of knowing how far he is from the jet in front of him , &quot; said Murray , whose son flies commuter planes . &quot; He ' s hoping he ' s far enough away , but the controllers know. &quot; Murray , who asked that the airline carrier he flies for not be named , said he has no doubts that economic issues played a role in the decision not to act_on the 757 spacing recommendations . He suspects the 757 spacing criteria may change now . &quot; The only possible reason for not doing_it is because it means dollars and cents , &quot; Murray said . &quot; They ' ll say , ' This is one of the world ' s busiest airports and how are we going_to stretch aircraft out , ' but that ' s just tough . &quot; This is something that needs immediate reaction . You know , all these kids are getting killed at this crosswalk . We need to put_in a stoplight . We don ' t want to do_it ; it ' s going_to cost a lot of money . But we ' ve got to. &quot; O ' Brien from the Air Line Pilots Assn. , which represents 40 # 000 pilots from 38 airlines , said ALPA for years has asked that the type of wake turbulence testing done three years ago on the 757 be made a routine part of the airline certification process . But &quot; there wasn ' t great enthusiasm for that , &quot; he said . It appears a stronger case could be made_for it now , he said . William Reynard , head of NASA ' s Aviation Safety Reporting System , which twice alerted the FAA last year to the 757 problem , said the FAA does the &quot; best it can &quot; in weighing safety and economic issues . But he said &quot; I think it ' s intelligent at this point &quot; that the FAA has begun further testing on the 757 and is considering creating a special category for spacing purposes . Tim Carey , a close friend of John O . McDaniel , the pilot of the plane that crashed in Santa Ana last month after encountering 757 wake turbulence , said safety_factors should far outweigh monetary ones . &quot; I ' m not an aviator , but safety comes first and nothing else should be considered , &quot; said Carey , the captain of a container_ship that regularly makes trans-Pacific runs between Los Angeles and Honolulu . &quot; Granted , you want your company to make some profits , but I don ' t see throwing_in a risk factor for monetary reasons . &quot; Look what could have been avoided in this case , &quot; he said . Carey said if McDaniel , a skilled pilot by all accounts , had at least been warned about the 757 wake turbulence problem , he would have paid special attention . &quot; It just seems a shame that they ' ve known about this for so_long and didn ' t say anything , &quot; Carey said . &quot; There ' s a lot of families affected by this -- a lot of wives , a lot of kids , a lot of friends , a lot of lives. &quot; Times staff writers Richard O ' Reilly and Caroline Lemke contributed to this report .</TEXT>
