   <TEXT> * Re &quot; Emergency Doctors Found Lacking Special Training , &quot; Sept . 8 : The article states that many emergency departments across the country are staffed by residents and / or physicians without adequate training to care_for the many types of medical problems which confront emergency physicians . It says that only half of the nation ' s 25 # 000 jobs in emergency medicine are filled by doctors certified to provide emergency care . This picture is painted with far too broad a brush stroke . Our emergency department is staffed exclusively by board-certified specialists , including moonlighters . The same can be said for many of the emergency departments in Southern California . In addition , a large percentage of those doctors lacking certification have extensive training and experience . They have been unable to take the emergency medicine boards because of technical , bureaucratic reasons . Attempts are currently being made to develop an alternative certification process . I agree that certifying practices for emergency departments are antiquated . Those departments that use highly qualified personnel should be credited for this and the information provided to the public . However , it must be remembered that the underlying reason less qualified physicians are used in some emergency departments is that many other medical specialties are more highly compensated while emergency_room work is often more difficult , demanding and sometimes dangerous , as the shootings last year at L.A. County-USC Hospital showed . STANLEY M . KALTER , MD Medical Director , Emergency Department Huntington Hospital , Pasadena</TEXT>
