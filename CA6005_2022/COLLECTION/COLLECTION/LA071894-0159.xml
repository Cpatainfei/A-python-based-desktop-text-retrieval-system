   <HEADLINE> FOR THE PEOPLE OF INDIA , MANGOES ARE A LUSCIOUS TREAT -- AND BIG BUSINESS ; ASIA : BUT OF THE MORE THAN 1 # 000 VARIETIES OF THE FRUIT GROWN THERE , ONLY A_FEW ARE POPULAR ABROAD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is July , and the thoughts of Indians have turned_to mangoes , their juicy and golden reward after months of torrid heat . The Benazir and the Bhutto are again in season , almost as green as the Pakistani flag . The walnut-sized Angoor Dana ( Grape Seed ) , the blushing Husn-ara ( Beauty ) and the lime-like Laila are now in markets and people ' s pantries . So , across India , are more_than 1 # 000 other varieties graced with the names of royalty ( Prince , Sultan and Viceroy ) , castes ( Thakur and Pandit ) , locales ( Calcutta Amin and Bombay ) and attributes ( Silky , Delicate and Seedless -- plus , for unknown reasons , Lame , Quicksand and Fragile Body ) . In India , mangoes are simultaneously a part of history , culture , mythology and religion -- and a big , thriving business . &quot; Mango is indeed India ' s gift to the world , &quot; said Gokul Patnaik of the Commerce Ministry , whose job is to sell as_many as possible abroad . Though an exotic , even unknown , object in parts of the Western world , the mango is as inextricably bound up with the land of its origin as the olive_tree is with Greece or the grapevine with Italy ' s Tuscany . Even the scientific name , Mangifera_indica , proudly proclaims the mango ' s native_land . The mango has been an integral part of India ' s diet and life for at least 4 # 000 years . It is supposed to have delighted the invading Alexander the Great in 326 BC , and one of the most celebrated of Mogul emperors , Akbar , is said to have had an orchard with 100 # 000 mango_trees , some of which still bear fruit in the present-day state of Bihar . The glories of the mango brought verse to the appreciative lips of one of the most celebrated of Urdu bards , Mirza Ghalib , who praised its flavor by asserting that &quot; even the sweetest of sugar_canes is bland beside it. &quot; Since time_immemorial , the mango has been the symbol of love , pleasure and auspiciousness to Indians . In Hindu mythology , love arrives with the blossoming of the mango_tree . Kama , the god of love , tips his arrow with five flowers , one of them the mango blossom . Its leaves are used to sprinkle sacred water in Hindu rituals . In the ancient holy books , the mango_tree is called Kalpavriksha , or &quot; wish-granting tree , &quot; and Buddha , who founded a religion of_his_own , is supposed to have meditated in its shade . To honor this &quot; king of fruits &quot; -- and try to earn some tourist revenue during a slack season -- the Indian_capital played host earlier this month to the 7th International Mango Festival . Events included a quiz about mango lore and legend , a messy mango-eating contest and an eye-popping display at Talkatora Indoor Stadium of more_than 500 domestic varieties , from the egg-size Anda to the Kakram Jabisaheb , as large as a gourd . Madan Lal Khurana , the chief minister of the national_capital territory of Delhi , inaugurated the festivities with a rousing speech praising the mango as so incredibly delicious that &quot; even a diabetic is tempted to take a slice after meals. &quot; It is also , Khurana said democratically , a fruit so cheap and plentiful that any Indian can afford it . On the rain-soaked pavement outside , growers hawked mangoes from crates and their customers happily demonstrated the correct five-step eating technique : Squeeze the mango all around to liquefy the inside ; rip the skin off the top ; suck the yellow-orange pulp as though eating an ice pop ; when the seed emerges , chew the pulp off it and discard ; continue to suck the mango until no pulp remains . According to Patnaik , the Commerce Ministry ' s salesman , the mango ' s motherland accounts_for about two-thirds of current global production . In the 12 months ending in April , India exported 21 # 000 tons of fresh whole fruit and 33 # 000 tons of mango pulp for sauces , yogurt flavoring and tropical fruit_juice , earning the country more_than $ 34 million . But the richness of mango varieties masks the truth about the nature of today ' s international market and India ' s problems , he said . About 90 % of the country ' s exports , it turns_out , are Alphonso mangoes , primarily from the area around Bombay . The overwhelming majority of other varieties never leave the country because they simply don ' t please the foreign eye . &quot; We go_by taste , we don ' t go_by color , when we Indians decide what mango we like , &quot; said Patnaik , chairman of the ministry ' s Agricultural and Processed Food_Products Export Development Authority . &quot; Unlike you. &quot; When Westerners buy a mango , Patnaik explained , they opt first for fruit whose skin has a rosy , peachlike blush . No matter how good its flavor , a green variety like the Benazir ( the name means &quot; peerless &quot; and , like the Bhutto , is only coincidentally shared by the prime_minister of India ' s archenemy , Pakistan ) consequently appeals_to few non-Indians . To alert Indian mango growers and shippers to what the competition is up_to and what pleases Western taste buds and eyes , Patnaik had rosy-cheeked mangoes from Kenya , Gambia , Jamaica , Venezuela and other producing countries flown into Delhi and put_on display at the festival . &quot; Unpopular varieties have trouble competing for a place in the supermarket , &quot; he noted in a speech at the festival opening . It was an open invitation to the growers of India , his country , who have more_than 1 million acres planted with mango_trees , to reflect on whether their crop is the right variety . Indian producers are faced with an additional , and very formidable , hurdle when it comes_to the United States : They don ' t meet current Agriculture_Department guidelines designed to guard against an infestation of the Oriental fruit_fly . That should now change , Patnaik said . The Japanese , who have similar regulations , are donating a pilot vapor-heat fruit treatment plant , to be constructed in the Delhi area , that would eliminate the fruit_fly danger . The next U.S. requirement would be on-site inspection to verify that the fruit is being properly treated , and Patnaik said his government has already asked that an Agriculture_Department inspector be based in India . As well as the whole fruit , Indians eat_at least a score of mango dishes , including &quot; hot mango pickle , &quot; where the mango is doused with an incendiary mixture of red chili_powder , mustard powder , turmeric , fenugreek , salt and other spices . For Indians , the mango is the symbol of life ' s pleasures . &quot; But most Americans don ' t even know what a mango is , &quot; Patnaik charged . His goal is to open the U.S. market to the Indian-grown delicacy that conquered Alexander the Great .</TEXT>
