   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; A NATURAL SETTING ; STRIPPED OF THEIR INHIBITIONS , NUDISTS AT ELYSIUM FIELDS IN TOPANGA CANYON SAY THE SAFE ENVIRONMENT SETS THEM FREE . THE CAMP HAS ENDURED SINCE 1968 DESPITE EFFORTS TO SHUT IT DOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On warm weekends , its grassy , eucalyptus-scented grounds are covered with naked men and women . Waitresses and teachers mingle with affluent couples and aging hipsters , their tanned bodies glistening in the sun . Some play tennis in nothing but sneakers . Others skinny-dip in the pool . Children romp across the lawn . With the passage of time , the Elysium Fields nudist camp in Topanga Canyon is more quaint than risque . A product of the sexual revolution of the 1960s , it has survived prudish neighbors , prayer vigils outside its gates , and , until recently , persistent efforts by Los Angeles County officials to close it down . Although a_few of the nation ' s 100 or so nudist camps have fallen on bad times , Elysium Fields -- like nude recreation generally -- thrives . The camp , where sex is prohibited , has become a popular venue for self-awareness experts spreading the New Age gospel . Parents take their kids there to explain the birds and bees . Women who would n ' t be caught in a singles bar swear by the secluded , eight-acre compound as a place to meet quality men . &quot; What we were hoping for and fighting for in the ' 60s , people are more comfortable doing now , &quot; said Ed Lange , Elysium ' s 72-year-old founder and a former Life magazine photographer . Sitting on a veranda overlooking his domain , wrapped in a towel as a concession to the weather , Lange resembles a professor who has just stepped_out of the shower . He is among the movement ' s elder_statesmen , having spent four decades trying to demystify the nudist way_of_life . As the publisher of nudist books and magazines , Lange has fought numerous legal battles , including one that led to a 1956 U.S. Supreme Court decision that granted second-class mailing privileges to nudist publications . In the late 1950s , he persuaded Eastman Kodak to change its policy of refusing to return prints of nudes that were sent_for developing . Later , he successfully challenged the publishers of Look magazine after they took_exception to him calling one of his publications Nude Look . He even scandalized daytime TV viewers in the early ' 60s by appearing -- fully clothed -- on &quot; Art Linkletter ' s House_Party &quot; to promote the lifestyle . For the past 26 years , his focus , and the source of his pride , has been Elysium Fields . Nestled below a hill at the end of a tree-lined back road , Elysium is a rustic Shangri-La where visitors are encouraged to shed their problems along with their attire . A sign_on a towel_rack beside the steam_bath reads , &quot; Leave Your Hang-ups Here. &quot; There are no loudspeakers , televisions or radios . Patrons are invited to get_in_touch with their senses , to smell the grass , enjoy the fresh air , count the clouds . On sunny weekends , when crowds number in the hundreds , the grounds are filled with couples and families with lunches spread on picnic blankets . People read , meditate , sunbathe , throw Frisbees . It is a park scene like any other , except that , for the most part , the participants aren ' t wearing clothes . And yet eroticism is strangely absent . &quot; Small bits of clothing are far more seductive than nudity can ever be , &quot; explains a divorced fashion_model , lounging in a lawn_chair , her chin_resting on her knees . She brings her young daughter whenever possible . &quot; If I wanted to be leered at , I ' d go_to the beach. &quot; Although uninhibited among themselves , many nudists remain wary about revealing their lifestyle to others , noting the lingering stigma associated with it . The model , for instance , didn ' t want her name revealed for fear that it would complicate a child custody_battle . &quot; I used to think nudists were wackos , &quot; says Paul Stevens , 82 , a Woodland Hills pharmacist who began coming_to Elysium with his wife in the late 1960s and has continued since her death 10 years ago . &quot; It ' s easy to ridicule something that you don ' t know anything about. &quot; Like other nudists , he extols the lifestyle for its ability to break_down ordinary social barriers . &quot; Communication is easier when you ' re naked , &quot; he said . &quot; Out of their uniforms , people are_on a_level playing field. &quot; He tells of once talking to a pleasant man from England named Alex for nearly an hour &quot; right here where you see me now &quot; and not learning until later that he was Alex Comfort , the noted biologist and author of &quot; The Joy of Sex. &quot; In the pool with Stevens this day was a brain_surgeon , a prominent child psychologist and a former National Geographic photographer on his first visit to the camp . Daniel Kaufman , the newcomer , had brought his 5-year-old daughter to attend one of the numerous &quot; clothed &quot; events hosted by Elysium throughout the year . When his daughter insisted on swimming , he shed his clothes and joined her . At the end of the day , he was hooked . &quot; I didn ' t meet any strange , weird or questionable characters , &quot; he said . &quot; Nor did I see it in anybody ' s eyes. &quot; An oasis of tranquillity where the two most common status symbols -- cars and clothes -- have no currency , Elysium seems an unlikely target for the kind of campaign that forced Lange to spend an estimated $ 1 million in legal_fees in_order to remain open . &quot; A less determined person would have walked away a long_time ago , &quot; said Los Angeles criminal attorney Stanley Fleishman , whose clients , besides Lange , have included the publishers of Henry Miller novels and the exhibitors of the movie &quot; Deep Throat. &quot; &quot; Ed has stuck_to his guns because of his beliefs. &quot; Not until early last year , following a series of court reversals , did the county finally recognize the camp ' s right to exist . A political realignment in 1991 had removed Elysium from the district of County Supervisor Michael Antonovich , a longtime foe . The camp ' s troubles began almost as soon as it opened . Responding to complaints from neighbors , deputies arrested Lange and two_dozen other nudists on successive weekends in 1968 , charging them with indecent_exposure under a 29-year-old county law . After Lange waged a successful legal battle to overturn the law , the county used zoning changes in an attempt to drum Elysium out of business . When that tactic also failed , the supervisors -- led by Antonovich -- asserted that the property was seismically unsafe to accommodate visitors . Some of the complaints once lodged against the camp border_on the comical . Stephen Rohde , a Los Angeles civil attorney , still chuckles when recalling a courtroom exchange with an Elysium detractor , a woman whose house bordered the grounds . &quot; I said , ' After dinner_parties , do you take guests up_to the attic with binoculars to peer over the eucalyptus_trees ? , ' and she said , ' We don ' t do_it all_the time. ' &quot; Although some neighbors still object to the nudist camp , local opposition has largely melted away . The same Topanga Chamber_of_Commerce whose members once shunned Elysium now use its clubhouse for their functions . &quot; All the stuff that our opponents imagined was hidden was revealed to be nonsense , &quot; Lange said . &quot; I didn ' t have a tail and horns and there were no orgies being conducted on the grounds. &quot; Lange became fascinated with nudism as a teen-ager growing_up in Chicago after buying an early nudist magazine , Sunshine &amp; Health , under the counter at a drugstore . Unlike other young_men drawn to the magazine because it was the only publication at the time to offer an unimpeded view of the female anatomy , he was more interested in the articles than the pictures . &quot; I resented guys in school who were only out_to ( score ) , and I resented girls who were only out_to find a lifetime meal ticket , &quot; he said . &quot; Unhealthy attitudes about sex and the human_body seemed to drive each group. &quot; * Abandoning Chicago along with his strict Baptist upbringing , Lange moved to Los Angeles in 1940 . He found work as a set designer and free-lance photographer and renewed his interest in nudism just when one of the movement ' s pioneer West Coast leaders came under_attack . Besieged by hostile newspaper accounts and under pressure from authorities , Lura Glassey was_on the brink of losing her popular Elysia nudist park in the_hills above Tujunga in the San Fernando Valley . The Los Angeles Herald-Express printed stories hinting at &quot; unspeakable orgies &quot; behind the &quot; impenetrable walls &quot; of Elysia . In 1939 , county supervisors passed a law effectively prohibiting the practice of nudism in the county -- the same law that Lange was later responsible_for overturning . To comply , Elysia ' s female members took_to wearing G-strings . But when an unsuspecting sunbather dropped hers to go skinny-dipping , sheriff ' s deputies , peering through binoculars , swooped in . Glassey was arrested . As her case languished in court , she was forced to sell the property and close the nudist park . Through the ordeal , Lange was one of her strongest supporters . &quot; It made me angry , &quot; he said . &quot; From that point on , my dream was to some day open my own camp and do something to improve conditions for nudists. &quot; The nudist philosophy is simple : To be nude is to be natural . It isn ' t that nudists are opposed to clothes . They simply believe that clothing restricts the full enjoyment of nature and outdoor activities . A favorite adage is : &quot; Clothed when practical , unclothed when possible. &quot; Once regarded_as nut-eating , berry-chewing exercise fanatics and treated as social lepers ( outsiders often even referred to their gathering_places as &quot; colonies &quot; ) , nudists by tradition have tended to be socially conservative . &quot; The movement was created in an environment of fear where to acknowledge that you were a sexual being was to imply that you were a pervert of some kind , &quot; Lange said . He and his former wife , June , set_about to change what Lange refers to as nudism ' s &quot; puritanical streak &quot; when they formed the Sundial Club for nudists out of their Hollywood apartment in the early ' 50s . * Many in the movement were dismayed when a stunningly attractive club_member , Diane Webber , posed for Playboy and later became one of the most photographed female sex icons of the ' 50s . Nudist sensitivities were also tested with the opening of Elysium Fields , with its more libertine rules . Elysium allowed touching , frowned_upon at other camps . Professional masseurs , unheard of in the nudist world at the time , were added_to the staff . And Elysium was designated as &quot; clothing optional , &quot; a departure from camps that required guests to disrobe before getting past the entry . Proponents say such changes have helped make nudism more acceptable to the public . &quot; This place represents a different attitude toward sexuality , &quot; said Art Kunkin , who gained notoriety in the ' 60s as founder of the Los Angeles Free Press , the nation ' s first underground newspaper . He works for Lange part time as publisher of Journal of the Senses , an Elysium quarterly . Although not a full-fledged nudist ( &quot; I ' ll take_off my clothes to go_in the pool &quot; ) , Kunkin was attracted to Elysium as a kind of truce zone where men and women relate to each other without being caught_up in the sexually infused gamesmanship involving fashion and possessions . &quot; People here aren ' t abusing one another , &quot; he said . Following the example of Esalen Institute , the personal development center near Big Sur , Lange introduced a curriculum of personal growth seminars -- including yoga , diet and fitness experts , psychological counselors and herbalists -- and promoted them in his own as well as non-nudist publications . &quot; Elysium has been_on the cutting edge_in any number of ways , &quot; said Debra Peterson , an official with the American Sunbathing Assn. , the nation ' s largest nudist group , with 44 # 000 members . Long content to keep a low profile , that group now actively promotes nudism by sending speakers to civic clubs and to trade and travel conventions , places Peterson insists &quot; would have been out_of_the_question just a_few years ago. &quot; At Elysium , the membership roll recently topped a record 1 # 400 , and Lange anticipates a new growth spurt now that the threat of closure has dissipated . * Like nudist camps everywhere , Elysium strives to keep a balance between men and women . &quot; It ' s established that if the balance gets_out of kilter , both men and women start to feel uncomfortable , &quot; says Norm Swirin , a librarian who moonlights as the camp ' s tennis_coach . Camp leaders say that currently , 65 % of members are men . Although not a requirement , male enrollees are encouraged to bring their wives and girlfriends , with discounts provided_for couples . Besides the $ 200 annual dues , members pay daily grounds fees that range from $ 8 to $ 11 , depending_on the season and the day_of_the_week . Sessions for prospective new members are held three times a week . A staff_member gives the newcomers a tour , lays_down what few rules there are ( &quot; Don ' t violate others ' personal space ; use a towel when sitting &quot; ) and tactfully seeks to weed out voyeurs from those genuinely interested in nudism . Even when the weather is lousy , a_few people usually show_up . On one such day recently , a weekday morning , three men came , including Don , a young UCLA graduate_student , and Carl , a retired insurance salesman . Don said he learned of the place after meeting a young_woman at a shopping_mall who had an Elysium bumper sticker on her car . By the end of the day , he was eager to share the experience with his girlfriend . Carl , who was visiting from Florida , had slipped_away from his wife on the pretext of sightseeing . And that was exactly what he was doing . &quot; She would n ' t go_for this , &quot; he said . Betty Lesley , Elysium ' s executive coordinator , insists that people who come for the wrong reasons usually don ' t return . &quot; They see what goes_on and the type of people here and we usually don ' t see them again , &quot; she said . Lesley , a former ballet_dancer , recalls her first day at Elysium 10 years ago with mixed emotions . Stressed from the demands of motherhood and her job as a network TV censor , she had been admonished by a doctor to find somewhere to unwind . A friend suggested Elysium Fields . &quot; I said , ' You ' re kidding , how do you get naked with a whole bunch of people ? ' &quot; Her first husband , the late film director Nicholas Ray , had been a private nudist , shedding his clothes after coming_home from work the way some people toss their shoes . It was not something she cared_for . But her friend was persistent . She recalls mustering the courage to walk_out_of Elysium ' s ladies room after disrobing . &quot; I whispered , ' Let ' s go somewhere up the_hill where nobody will notice us. ' &quot; Soon , the stack of TV scripts she had brought from the office were abandoned . &quot; I discovered for the first time in my life the pleasure of being totally unfettered , like a baby , &quot; she recalled . &quot; It was extremely liberating. &quot; WHERE TO GO What : Elysium Fields nudist camp .
