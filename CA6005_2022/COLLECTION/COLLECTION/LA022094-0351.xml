   <HEADLINE> 15 SUPPORTERS OF ANC MASSACRED IN SOUTH_AFRICA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Less than 10 weeks before this country ' s first free elections , political violence intensified dramatically Saturday with the massacre of 15 people , most of them teen-agers , who had been preparing_for a voter education workshop . All the victims were supporters of Nelson Mandela ' s African National Congress , ANC officials said . Political bloodshed is common here , but the slaughter in strife-torn Natal province appears to be the worst single attack on a political group since the formal election campaign began last month to end more_than three centuries of white minority rule . Police said four unidentified men armed with AK-47 assault_rifles and homemade guns blasted a hut in rural Mahele where the group was sleeping , and then hacked at the bodies with knives . At least three victims died trying to flee the attack . Twelve of the dead were under the age of 18 , police said . A local ANC official , Zabuse Mlaba , said the group had put_up posters Friday in preparation for a voter education program for local residents . &quot; Those who don ' t want people to vote &quot; were responsible , he said . Police initially released few details . &quot; I can say it is political , but I don ' t want to elaborate further , &quot; said local police commander Ben Lombard . Hernus Kriel , the minister of law and order , said in a statement that the massacre &quot; was yet another indication that levels of political intolerance and intimidation have reached very dangerous levels. &quot; In Washington , the White_House said it was &quot; appalled &quot; by the massacre . &quot; We view the attack as a cowardly affront to the process of democratic reform in South_Africa , &quot; Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said . Political leaders and international monitors concede that free and fair elections may be impossible in several pockets of the country because of violence . Although radical groups , both black_and_white , warn almost daily of looming civil_war , the more likely scenario is an upsurge in the tit-for-tat attacks that have already killed nearly 15 # 000 people in the last four years . But it ' s not clear whether the bloodshed will simply punctuate the transfer of power to the black majority or will mark the start of a descent into racial and ethnic conflict , with a human and economic toll that will undermine attempts to build a new multiracial democracy . Mahele is southwest of Pietermaritzburg in southern Natal province , one of the country ' s most troubled areas . Members of Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi ' s Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party , which is based in the black homeland of Kwazulu in Natal , clash regularly with rival supporters of the ANC . Nearly 2 # 000 people were killed in the province last year alone , almost half the country ' s total . Not all_of the violence is clearly political . Traditional tribal and clan disputes over land , cattle , women and honor often form the backdrop to the political attacks . The impoverished area is beset by social problems as well , since many of the Zulu men work in mines , factories or cities far from their families . But tensions in Natal have risen in the week since Buthelezi announced that he and his party will boycott the April 26-28 elections , and his nephew , Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini , unexpectedly demanded that the government cede him an independent Zulu monarchy that would include all_of Kwazulu and Natal . Buthelezi has rejected a package of unconditional constitutional amendments offered Wednesday by the ANC and President Frederik W . de Klerk ' s reformist government to draw him and his right-wing allies in the Freedom Alliance into the election . At a news_conference in Cape_Town , he repeatedly refused to say what , if anything , he will do to persuade Natal residents not to vote . But the South_African Press Assn . reported Saturday that scores of people have begun fleeing the Kwazulu capital of Ulundi , where Buthelezi is based , following a series of attacks on residents suspected of being ANC supporters . At least one man was killed , and a woman ' s home was partly burned , after their names appeared on a list of reputed ANC activists . One of those to leave was Simon Gumede , a senior aide to Buthelezi . Although he denied supporting the ANC , he resigned his posts in the Kwazulu Cabinet and Inkatha and fled Ulundi after his name appeared on the list . Although De Klerk said Friday that &quot; the door remains open &quot; for further negotiations , Buthelezi appeared to harden his opposition by complaining to a local radio_station that he and his supporters no longer have enough time to campaign even if they wanted to join the race . He appealed for international mediation to delay the election . &quot; It ' s not really fair ( that ) if our concerns are met now , they don ' t consider giving us space to campaign and to electioneer , &quot; Buthelezi said . Buthelezi has demanded full autonomy for Kwazulu and constitutional protection of the Zulu monarchy . His white-separatist allies demand a racially segregated volkstaat , or people ' s state , where they can govern themselves . The groups have threatened to use armed resistance to win their demands . ANC leaders say one reason for Buthelezi ' s stonewalling is that polls show Inkatha would lose to the ANC , even in Natal . Buthelezi , a proud and prickly politician , would be humiliated by losing in his own stronghold . Mandela and De Klerk have ruled_out postponing the election , the first in which the black majority will be eligible to vote . Mandela ' s ANC is expected to win the race in a landslide .</TEXT>
