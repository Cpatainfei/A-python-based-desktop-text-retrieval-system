   <HEADLINE> THEY MADE THEIR MARK IN THE YEAR THAT WAS ; CSUN STUDENTS ; FUNDING PROPOSAL REJECTED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Somewhere at Cal State Northridge , somebody fits the following profile of the school ' s average student , which is based on school demographic data and the results of two critical campus elections : Female , undergraduate , age 24.5 , not particularly crazy about contributing money to college sports . It ' s the latter that has put the Northridge athletic department in hot water . Athletics faces a deficit of $ 700 # 000 for 1995-96 and it was hoped that the student body would help foot the bill . Not now , students said . Twice . A handful of colleges in the state had succeeded with a rather simple fund-raising plan and Northridge decided to try its hand . Last spring , a referendum was placed on the Associated Students ballot and voters were asked to voluntarily hike their semester fees , with the money earmarked for athletics . The spring referendum , with little formal campaigning by the athletic department , was defeated . The vote was painfully close , 993-906 . Administrators believed that a more-organized campaign , which would underscore the Northridge plight to the public , would succeed . Another referendum was placed on the ballot in October . Athletics organized a formal campaign and enlisted the support of its athletes , many of whom spoke_to student groups and their peers . The school outlined the negatives associated with another referendum defeat . Namely , after five years at the NCAA Division I level , a move to Division II was a possibility since programs would be slashed . The price_tag for each student was $ 49 per semester , which would have generated $ 2.25 million annually . For their largess , students would be granted free admission to home athletic events and two new programs would be created . Despite facing no organized opposition , the measure was defeated in the largest election turnout in Northridge history , 2 # 315 to 2 # 116 . The percentage breakdown , compared to the results of the spring referendum , was identical -- the nay vote was 52.2 % . Months later , athletics officials are still waiting for the other shoe to drop . A series of funding scenarios have been presented by President Blenda J . Wilson . Twice beaten , thrice shy ? Not exactly . School officials plan a third referendum in March . School officials indicate it will be the last -- and it could mark the last breath for four programs . Football , women ' s basketball , men ' s soccer and men ' s swimming will be eliminated if the referendum fails .</TEXT>
