   <HEADLINE> FINAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN TAY MURDER TRIAL ; COURT : JURORS ARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN DELIBERATIONS TODAY ON WHETHER TO CONVICT ROBERT CHAN OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER OR VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER IN THE 1992 KILLING OF HONOR STUDENT STUART A . TAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jurors were asked Monday to choose between first-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter convictions for a teen-ager accused of masterminding the 1992 New Year ' s Eve slaying of honor student Stuart A . Tay . Deputy Dist . Atty . Lewis R . Rosenblum told the Orange County Superior_Court jury that it could disregard the prosecution ' s entire case and still have enough evidence from Robert Chan ' s own testimony to prove he is guilty of murdering Tay , 17 , of Orange . Chan insisted that others orchestrated the killing but tripped himself up by admitting that he followed orders during the fatal attack , Rosenblum told the jurors during closing arguments . Accomplices are held equally culpable under the law , the prosecutor told jurors . &quot; He convicted himself ; he was convicted out of_his_own mouth , &quot; the prosecutor told the jury . &quot; There ' s no room left for Mr. Chan to weasel out of it . It ' s over , &quot; he later added . But defense_attorney Marshall M . Schulman said Rosenblum ' s case was weak because it relied heavily on an admitted liar who pleaded guilty to his role in Tay ' s slaying and agreed to testify against the other teen-agers in exchange for being prosecuted as a juvenile . The key prosecution witness in Chan ' s trial was Charles Choe , 18 , of Fullerton . Choe , who admitted participating in the slaying but said he did not strike Tay , is expected to be released from the California Youth Authority when he turns 25 . Chan has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic . At the time of the slaying , Chan told jurors , he was under the delusion that Tay had rigged his home with explosives and was about to kill him . Under the theory of &quot; imperfect self-defense , &quot; jurors should convict Chan of the less serious charge of voluntary manslaughter , Schulman said . &quot; This is an individual with an extremely troubled mind , &quot; Schulman told the jury , which is expected to begin deliberating today . &quot; If Stuart Tay was not eliminated , in ( Chan ' s ) mind , Stuart Tay would kill him. &quot; Prosecutors say Chan plotted Tay ' s death because he feared Tay would double-cross him in a planned computer heist . Tay was lured to a Buena Park back yard and beaten unconscious with baseball_bats before rubbing alcohol was forced down his throat . Chan , once a candidate for class valedictorian , admitted to jurors that he then taped Tay ' s mouth and nose before burying him in a shallow grave . * Jury selection begins today for three other youths charged in Tay ' s death : Abraham Acosta , 17 , of Buena Park and Mun Bong Kang , 19 , and Kirn Young Kim , 18 , both of Fullerton . Chan faces life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder and charges that he used a baseball_bat and ambushed Tay , who attended Foothill High_School in Santa Ana . The accused murderers attended Sunny Hills High_School in Fullerton . The six teen-agers got_together to plan the robbery of an Anaheim computer parts dealer . The scheme began to unravel when Chan learned that Tay was lying_about his identify and background . The defense_attorney told jurors that some of the blame for the killing rests with the victim . Tay allegedly tried to impress his new friends by claiming to be a 19-year-old crime figure with dozens of followers and involvement in illegal activities ranging from counterfeiting to weapon sales and computer pirating . Chan began to fear Tay , Schulman said . In his feeble mental_state , Chan became convinced that Tay had planted bombs in his home and was about to kill him , the defense_attorney said . The victim was &quot; playing with fire and didn ' t realize it , &quot; Schulman said . &quot; Whether it ' s true or not doesn ' t matter , &quot; Schulman said of Chan ' s fear that he was about to be killed . &quot; It ' s what he believes. &quot; But Rosenblum asked jurors to not be &quot; gullible &quot; and noted that the plot to kill Tay was hatched over many days . &quot; The issue is not whether or not ( Chan ) is paranoid schizophrenic , because it doesn ' t matter , &quot; Rosenblum said . &quot; This young_man knew exactly what he was doing every step of the way. &quot;</TEXT>
