   <TEXT> A nonpartisan children ' s advocacy group on Saturday urged voters to select political candidates who make the interests of California ' s children their top priority . Children Now of Los Angeles issued its fifth annual report outlining various critical problems many children face in education , safety , health and economic security . The report will be submitted to the Wilson Administration and the Legislature . &quot; We must elect leaders who will create policies that put the interests of children first by investing in the right start for every child , &quot; said Lois Salisbury , executive_director of the nonprofit group . &quot; Only then will we get the return on the investment that California needs to remain a thriving and unique state. &quot; The organization , which consists_of educators and business_leaders from throughout California , urged voters to ask candidates at the local , state and national levels where they stand on children ' s issues before going_to the polls Nov . 8 . Among the report ' s statewide findings , which were mostly based on 1992 statistics collected from various state and federal agencies that track the well-being of children in California ' s 58 counties : * Twenty-four percent of fourth-graders could not fully understand a basic reading_assignment , while 20 % of eighth-graders could not write a basic essay . In Los Angeles County , the percentages were 29 % and 26 % , respectively . They were 17 % and 14 % in Orange County , and 18 % and 15 % in Ventura County . * Although the high_school dropout rate has fallen_in recent years , fewer than one-third of students who finish high_school are adequately prepared_for college . * The largest_number of children killed by guns die in the seven major counties where gun sales are the highest . The counties are Los Angeles , Orange , San Diego , Alameda , San Bernardino , Riverside and Sacramento . A total of 432 children were killed by guns in Los Angeles County in 1992 . In Orange County , there were 37 such deaths , and there were five in Ventura County . * Every year more_than 4 # 000 California babies die before their first birthday , including at least 1 # 421 in Los Angeles County , 280 in Orange County and 72 in Ventura County . The group blamed many of these deaths on the lack of proper prenatal care . * Nearly 1.7 million California schoolchildren cannot afford to buy lunch and are enrolled in the school free lunch program , including 616 # 711 in Los Angeles County , 96 # 325 in Orange County and 27 # 541 in Ventura County . &quot; The picture for all children is grim , but it is particularly disturbing for African American and Latino children , &quot; said the report , noting that California is the first_state to have a majority of its children , or 56 % , be African American , Latino , Asian or Native_American . Although mostly critical , the document cited signs of improvement in some areas . &quot; We are heartened by the improvements that we can identify , &quot; said James P . Steyer , president of Children Now . &quot; Although they are not as extensive as we would like , they prove that good programs do exist and conditions can be turned_around . But it requires constant pressure from the public to demand that our elected officials do right by our kids. &quot; Improvement was in the decreasing high_school dropout rate and in the number of students who are prepared_for college on a statewide basis , Steyer said . The group ' s political_platform calls_for proper health_care for every child and family , early_childhood education , quality care_for needy children , economic security for all children and their families , quality education , and a safe and nurturing environment for all children .</TEXT>
