   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER ; THEY HERD IT IS A PROBLEM WHEN THE MOOSE RUN LOOSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Among the first things a visitor notices when heading into the Norwegian countryside are the roadside moose-crossing signs . The triangular , red-edged white signs with the moose silhouette are everywhere . that ' s because in southern Norway , moose are abundant . There is even a moose-crossing pin , a popular item among traders . They call them elk here , but moose they look_like and moose they are . The largest wild animal in the country , moose have trekked the lowlands east of Oslo and north through Lillehammer for centuries . This winter , because of the deep snow , they are having a difficult time . Instead of following their usual routes , many are taking the path_of_least_resistance , wandering placidly along plowed roadways and railroad_tracks . And because of that , and increased rail traffic to accommodate Olympic travelers , according to Arild Vollan of NBS Norwegian State Railways , moose have been dying in alarming numbers . More_than 300 have been killed throughout Norway this winter . That means lots of cars and some train engines are considerably the worse for wear as well . The railroad has been working_on the problem , though , and has arrived_at some solutions . One of them is wolf urine . Besides humans , the moose has only one natural enemy , the wolf . Wolves are scarce in Norway these days , but the moose don ' t know that and so the railroad has hung sachets of chemically produced essence of wolf urine on lines along moose trails near the tracks . The moose smell the wolf urine and return to the forest . The railroad also has plowed old logging roads and strewn moose food -- cut saplings , bales of hay and eight tons of pine needles , a moose delicacy -- along them , far from the tracks . Finally , a helicopter patrol keeps track of meandering moose and warns train engineers to slow when the big animals are near the tracks . Just the other day , the ' copter spotted 70 within 500 yards of the tracks . The helicopter also carries a long line and a net -- for instant moose relocation when necessary . And , says the railroad ' s Ingri Garberg , the save-the-moose measures are working . Since the start of the Games , only three have been killed . MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
