   <HEADLINE> RISE IN PRICES , INVENTORIES HINT AT SLOWDOWN , ANALYSTS SAY ; ECONOMY : BUT EXPERTS EXPECT THE FED TO RAISE INTEREST_RATES TO FEND OFF FUTURE INFLATION PRESSURES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3 % last month and unsold goods continued to pile_up on store shelves , the government said Friday , but analysts said the reports will not keep the Federal_Reserve_Board from raising interest_rates again next week to further cool the economy . The Labor_Department said the modest rise in its consumer_price_index was fueled by big jumps in the prices of gasoline and coffee . In the first seven months of this year , consumer prices rose at a 2.7 % annual rate -- an exact match to last year ' s increase . Meanwhile , the Commerce_Department said that business inventories rose 0.4 % in July -- the third straight monthly advance -- as manufacturers churned_out more goods than consumers wanted to buy or retailers could sell . Combined , analysts said , the two reports show that inflation remains under_control and that the economy is slowing . Stocks rallied and bond yields fell on the news , with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining nearly 17.81 points and the yield on the newly auctioned benchmark 30-year bond falling to 7.50 % from 7.56 % Thursday . But most economists agreed that the Fed will probably still raise interest_rates when its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday , hoping to squelch the inflationary pressures that some board_members believe are growing . &quot; The Fed ' s job is to worry about inflation several months down the road , not what inflation is doing today , &quot; said Lynn Reaser , chief economist for Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bank . &quot; And the fact is , some inflationary pressures seem to be building up. &quot; Some analysts have become increasingly concerned about rising energy prices . The CPI report said a 3.5 % jump in the price of gasoline pushed the typical American ' s overall energy costs up 1.8 % in July , the biggest increase in nearly a year . Higher energy prices , coupled with a 0.5 % hike in the cost of food , easily offset the 0.4 % decline in the cost of new clothes . Analysts say energy prices could go higher in the months ahead , especially if an oil workers strike in Nigeria continues to crimp supply and the economic recovery in Europe raises demand . When the volatile cost of energy and food is excluded , the &quot; core &quot; rate_of_inflation rose a tinier 0.2 % last month . But with prices on the producer level already rising fast -- the Labor_Department said Thursday that wholesale prices surged 0.5 % in July , the biggest increase in more_than a year -- inflation could make a comeback if the Fed doesn ' t raise rates again soon . &quot; The Fed ' s concerns about inflation are real , even if we don ' t see high inflation today , &quot; said Cynthia Latta , senior economist at DRI / McGraw Hill in Boston . Latta said the Fed will probably raise its federal funds rate by one-quarter of a point when it meets next week , to 4.5 % , but that a half-point increase is still possible . &quot; Some level of increase is inevitable . Now it ' s just a matter of how large it is going_to be , &quot; she said . The 0.4 % rise in business inventories was another sign that the Fed ' s four rate hikes earlier this year have already put the brakes on the nation ' s economic_growth . Consumers began cutting_back on their spending about the same time that the Fed hiked rates for the first time last February . But manufacturers kept their plants operating at full speed , causing their warehouses to fill_up and retailers ' shelves to overflow . However , a third report released Friday indicated that consumers may be feeling a bit more upbeat about their economic future . The University of Michigan said its preliminary consumer sentiment index for August stood at 92.6 , up from 89 in July .
