   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; JOAN AND JERRY MCMILLIN THOUGHT THEIR CHILD-RAISING DAYS WERE DONE . BUT WHEN THEIR DAUGHTER WAS SLAIN , LEAVING TWO GRANDCHILDREN , THE MCMILLINS HAD TO BECOME . . . ; TWICE THE PARENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like a lot of people in their late 50s and early 60s , Joan and Jerry McMillin had a retirement_plan : Travel the country in a camper , grow old with friends , put some money aside for their grandchildren ' s education . Six years ago , those plans evaporated when their daughter was stabbed to death by her husband in front of their two children in an Orange County motel_room . Today , the McMillins are parents again , raising grandchildren George , 11 and Audrey , 10 , in a white bungalow in Bellflower after a five-year custody_battle that exhausted their life savings and left them in debt . &quot; Neither of us wanted to do this , &quot; Joan McMillin said . &quot; We had a beautiful picture in front of us that we were moving toward . But the glass broke and the picture was destroyed. &quot; The McMillins are among a growing number of grandparents thrust into the job of raising children for a second time , missing out on long-awaited retirements . According to census data , in 1990 three times as_many grandparents were raising their grandchildren as in 1980 . What happened to the McMillins was an extreme case ; more often , grandparents assume child-rearing roles while their own children deal with drug_addictions , spousal abuse , divorce or financial pressures that limit the time they can devote to parenting . Dozens of support groups have formed throughout the United States to help grandparents such_as the McMillins cope_with the financial , physical and emotional demands of raising children . One of the country ' s first groups -- Grandparents as Parents -- started in Long_Beach eight years ago . The McMillins say they found kinship and solace at the weekly meetings . The organization brought_in experts in family law , the social_welfare bureaucracy and financial matters_to give grandparents advice . At picnics , holiday parties and counseling sessions , grandparent members shared information -- from cooking tips and child-rearing strategies to horror stories about battling their own children for custody of the grandchildren . The McMillins met a retired Los Angeles nurse with colon_cancer who is raising five grandchildren , all born addicted to drugs . They met a couple from Lakewood who have been battling for custody of an 8-year-old grandson abandoned at birth by his drug-addicted mother . Another member of the group , a single grandmother , had won custody of her grandson from his drug-addicted , abusive mother , only to learn that the boy ' s father , who is in prison for attempted murder , might gain custody when he is released in a_couple_of years . * Grandparents also learn to cope_with guilt stemming from their own children ' s problems . &quot; We learned we weren ' t bad parents , and we ' re not failures , &quot; McMillin said . &quot; Some of the guilt was lifted and we could go on. &quot; Joan McMillin , 58 , a beautician , appears to be flourishing in her role as mom . On a recent afternoon , the aroma of chicken_soup wafts from the kitchen where she is standing_in front of a pot , stirring . Jerry McMillin , 60 , a former refrigerator repairman , sits in an armchair in the living room , overseeing George Gallagher Jr . and Audrey Gallagher as they do math homework . On the living room wall is a portrait of their mother , Barbara . She looks radiant , youthful , her head cocked , her smile self-assured . The picture is deceiving , though . Barbara ' s life was never as easy as the photograph suggests . Barbara was the youngest of Joan McMillin ' s seven children . When Barbara was still a baby , McMillin left her abusive first husband in Massachusetts , packed the kids in the car and drove to California . She moved to Bellflower in 1970 , working_at odd jobs to keep food on the table . She went_back to school but continued to work nights and weekends . She often had to leave Barbara in the care of the older children . Joan met Jerry , a divorced father of three grown children , in the late 1970s . They married a_few years later . * Barbara met George Gallagher when she was 14 . He was 20 , with the looks of a TV anchor , and had a well-paying aerospace factory job . Almost immediately , Barbara became pregnant . In 1983 , at age 17 , she was married and the mother of two children . During the marriage , George Gallagher drank , smoked marijuana and beat Barbara , according to Joan and Jerry McMillin . The two children lived_on and off with their grandparents . In February , 1986 , Barbara and George divorced and the court gave custody of the children to Barbara . But Barbara kept returning to George , despite the pleas of Joan and Jerry McMillin to leave him for good . Barbara exhibited the classic symptoms of a battered woman , said Sylvie de Toledo , a licensed clinical social_worker who founded Grandparents as Parents in Long_Beach . &quot; Somehow the man still has a lot of power and control , &quot; de Toledo said . &quot; When there are children involved , and you ' re dependent_on an abusive man emotionally and financially , it ' s very hard to break_away because you ' re wondering how you ' re going to survive. &quot; In January , 1988 , Barbara , George and the children moved_into the Twin Cypress Motel in Orange . One day six months later , Audrey and George Jr . were helping pack the car for a trip to the beach . Their parents started arguing about money . George Gallagher pulled_out a knife and stabbed his wife repeatedly in the head . Audrey was 4 at the time . George Jr . was 5 . * George put the children in the car and went_to his mother ' s house in Yorba Linda . In front of Audrey , he stabbed his sister Mary in the chest , killing her . He put the kids in the car again , drove onto the Costa Mesa Freeway and crashed into the center divider . He left the kids , who were uninjured , took_off his clothes and ran naked through a nearby neighborhood , where he was arrested without a struggle . After a two-day trial , a Superior_Court judge ruled that Gallagher was insane when he stabbed his wife but was sane when he stabbed his sister . Gallagher was ordered confined to a state mental_hospital , where he remains . Even if he is declared sane in the future , however , Gallagher will face a prison sentence of 26 years to life in the death of his sister . After Gallagher ' s trial , Joan McMillin told a reporter : &quot; Now I know there ' s a safe future for our family and my grandchildren. &quot; But their problems were far from over . Despite the McMillins ' objections , Orange County social_workers placed the children with Gallagher ' s teen-age sister . A few months later , the McMillins won temporary custody of George Jr . and Audrey , but George Gallagher ' s mother and brother sued for permanent custody . There followed a five-year battle in Orange County Juvenile_Court involving the McMillins , George Gallagher ' s family and social_workers . Although the children remained with the McMillins , a series of hearings were held to determine whether they would be suitable parents , and to determine how the children were adjusting . * At various times , Joan McMillin says , she was blamed by some social_workers and the Gallagher family for her daughter ' s death and denounced as a bad mother and grandmother . &quot; The stress was horrible , &quot; McMillin said . &quot; I couldn ' t eat or sleep . You start even wondering about yourself . Maybe they ' re right , maybe you ' re wrong . &quot; The kids are not a problem , &quot; she said . &quot; I can do 10 kids . I roller-skate , I ride bikes , I do all that stuff. &quot; It was the custody_battle that took its toll . In 1990 , Jerry McMillin suffered three strokes , causing mild brain damage that forced him to give_up his successful refrigerator-repair business . The McMillins now live_on Social_Security and what Joan McMillin earns from three part-time jobs : cosmetologist , demonstrator of grocery_store products on weekends , seasonal worker in a marmalade factory . The children , who were aware that a court might force them to leave the McMillins , also were having problems . Audrey talked like a baby . She lay on the sofa in the fetal position . She wet the bed every night . She forgot how to read and write and had to repeat kindergarten . For a time , she refused to go_to_bed unless the windows and doors were covered with blankets . She kept saying she was afraid that &quot; daddy would come get me , &quot; according to Joan McMillin . She said George Jr . &quot; would get angry and throw and break things . He would hit Audrey and she would hit him . When I tried to get him to talk to me , he would say , ' Why can ' t we just live with you ? Why do we have to go_to court ? Maybe they ' re going to send us away. ' &quot; It was very hard to convince this little boy that he was going_to stay with us. &quot; * Even so , neither Joan nor Jerry ever considered giving_up . &quot; I had to do what I thought was right , to stand_by my wife and take_care of the kids , &quot; Jerry said . &quot; I promised the kids I ' d be as good a father as I could . When I make a commitment , I do my best to keep it. &quot; Court Commissioner Gale Hickman said the case dragged_on partly because he was concerned whether the McMillins were up_to the task of raising children who had experienced such trauma . &quot; Anyone who had the kids , including the McMillins , would have a difficult task raising them , &quot; Hickman said . &quot; I never had any doubt about the McMillins ' energy and willpower but ( doubted ) whether they had whatever it might take_to cope_with these kids . &quot; I ' d have thought that about anybody , &quot; Hickman said . &quot; These kids were very disrupted. &quot; Last year , Hickman ruled that the McMillins should have permanent custody of George and Audrey . Breaking the bond between the McMillins and their grandchildren might cause George and Audrey irreparable damage , the commissioner decided . &quot; What happens to kids who . . . have bonded only to have the bond destroyed ? They stop trusting , &quot; he said . &quot; And when they stop trusting , they get angry and they carry their anger around . It disrupts them forever and ever. &quot; * In the year since the McMillins were awarded permanent custody and the court terminated its monitoring , George and Audrey &quot; have done 10 times better in attitude , in feeling secure , in school , than they had in the previous six years , &quot; Joan McMillin said . &quot; They ' re calm , they ' re happy , their lives turned right around. &quot; George , a sixth-grader , does_well in school , plays the saxophone and complains about not being allowed to go_to the mall unattended or stay out after dark or see R-rated movies . Audrey loves math , reading and talking to her grandmother about clothes , boys and the latest hairstyles . McMillin sews Halloween costumes for herself and the kids , and bakes cookies with them at Christmas for teachers and neighbors . She takes them to school the first day , monitors their studies closely and encourages them to do their best . She worries , though , about allowing George and Audrey outside after dinner , about letting them ride bikes alone , about whether their clothes will inadvertently offend gang members , about what might happen if they walk through the wrong neighborhoods . She acknowledges that she didn ' t have to worry about most of these things with her own children . Audrey and George rarely see their paternal grandmother , Janine Phillips , 61 , one of the Gallagher family members who sued for custody . Like Joan McMillin , Phillips was a single mother who raised seven children alone after her first husband left her . Now , she is helping raise three other grandchildren . Phillips said the custody dispute also left her in debt , forcing her to declare bankruptcy . Though she is unhappy with the custody ruling , she is resigned to it . &quot; The main thing is that the children are doing_well , &quot; she said . &quot; I hope and pray the kids are all right. &quot; * Audrey still thinks_about her mother at times . &quot; Sometimes I wish I had a mom , &quot; Audrey says . &quot; Kids at school ask me , ' Where ' s your mom ? ' So I brought_in a picture of her grave . &quot; When people ask me what happened , it brings_back bad memories . I just say , ' My mom ' s dead . My dad killed her. ' And I leave it at that. &quot; George Jr . says , &quot; I just don ' t talk_about it. &quot; Although the children are adjusting , Joan McMillin says , &quot; I see heartache when they reach puberty and the parents of a girlfriend or boyfriend want to know about their parents . What happens when ( someone ) finds_out their dad ' s in prison ? What if ( the parents ) say , ' You ' re not going_out with my son or daughter ? ' &quot; that ' s why we talk_about it . So they aren ' t devastated by it. &quot; * Joan McMillin says she has few regrets about forgoing her retirement dreams and becoming a parent again . She feels best when friends compliment her about the job she and Jerry are doing with the kids . &quot; Some of them are envious , the women especially , because their kids are married and gone and they ' re left with the old_man . &quot; We listen to our friends and , since they ' ve retired , they don ' t do anything . Some are_sick ; some have died ; some , their backs went_out , some have bad feet . &quot; But we ' re as crazy as we were . It ' s just that we don ' t have money , so we can ' t go too far , &quot; she joked . &quot; And now we need a baby-sitter. &quot;</TEXT>
