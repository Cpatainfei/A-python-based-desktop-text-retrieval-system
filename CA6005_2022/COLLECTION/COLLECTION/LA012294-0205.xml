   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK ; TROUBLED WATER ; HOW THE EARTHQUAKE AFFECTED THE SOUTHLAND ' S WATER_SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What Happened : 1 . The shaking and buckling caused havoc with the steel and concrete pipes and the aqueducts operated by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power . 2 . The Los Angeles Aqueduct , which brings water from the Owens Valley , broke just south of Soledad Canyon . The flow of water was quickly transferred to a second aqueduct , but engineers soon found that it too was leaking badly and shut it down . 3 . A 10-foot section of the Metropolitan Water District ' s major importation pipeline was severed at the Joseph Jensen Water Filtration Plant in Granada Hills . That precluded the MWD from bringing water from Northern California until early Thursday morning , when repairs were completed . The DWP repaired damage to its second aqueduct early Thursday , but when water began to pour through , additional leaks were discovered and officials were forced to shut it down again . Repairs on both aqueducts could take_up to a week to complete . The aqueducts are only part of the DWP ' s problems . Of the five major trunk_lines that serve the northwest San Fernando Valley area , only three are operating . Upward of 4 # 000 additional breaks_in local mains have been reported and officials fear that as water service is restored , still more leaks in the system will be discovered . As of Friday , about 20 # 000 customers in some areas of the Valley , including Granada Hills and higher elevations of the Santa Monica Mountains and West Hills , were still without water . Limited Service Temblors can break underground sewage pipes as well as potable water_mains . If water pressure drops -- from high demands fighting fires or because of restricted incoming supplies -- sewage can seep into the water_lines . Areas facing possible contamination include : Limited : The northwest San Fernando Valley north of Devonshire Street and west of DeSoto Avenue , where service is slowly being restored . Intermittent : Residents between DeSoto and Balboa Boulevard and north of the Foothill Freeway ( Interstate 210 ) between the Golden State Freeway ( Interstate 5 ) and Hubbard Avenue where there is currently intermittent service . Suspect : Customers in the area west of Fairfax Avenue and south of Sunset Boulevard had been under the boil-water advisory until it was lifted Friday morning after tests showed there was no contamination . The order remained in_effect for residents of the San Fernando Valley and the Santa Monica Mountains north of Sunset Boulevard -- including the communities of Bel Air , Beverly Glen , Mount_Olympus , Hollywood Hills and Pacific Palisades . What Is Being Done More_than 400 DWP workers are in the San Fernando Valley fixing breaks_in the water_system . DWP crews are being supplemented by crews from Orange County , Long_Beach , San Diego , Las Vegas and Northern California . Work is continuing on the aqueducts , trunk_lines , mains and at a series of damaged water_tanks that serve higher elevations in the west Valley area . The Los Angeles Fire_Department is assisting the DWP in pumping water to higher elevations in the North West Valley above Devonshire . Some MWD water is being routed through the DWP ' s pipeline network , and water from the State Water_Project is now being filtered and processed by a repaired DWP plant in Sylmar . The DWP is utilizing the seven- to 10-day supply of water it has stored in area reservoirs , and officials have begun pumping ground_water from the San Fernando Valley aquifer to supplement the supply . Most of the 20 # 000 residents currently without water should have service restored within a week . How to Treat Contaminated Water If you suspect your water is polluted , strain through paper_towels or like material and boil vigorously for five minutes . This will usually make_it safe from harmful bacterial contamination . Or you may purify the water by adding the chemicals shown in this table . Amount of water : 1 quart Amount of chlorine bleach to add_to clear water : 2 drops Amount of chlorine bleach to add_to cloudy water : 4 drops Amount of tincture_of_Iodine 2 % to add_to clear water : 3 drops Amount of tincture_of_Iodine 2 % to add_to cloudy water : 6 drops * Amount of water : 1 gallon Amount of chlorine bleach to add_to clear water : 8 drops Amount of chlorine bleach to add_to cloudy water : 16 drops Amount of tincture_of_Iodine 2 % to add_to clear water : 12 drops Amount of tincture_of_Iodine 2 % to add_to cloudy water : 24 drops * Amount of water : 5 gallons Amount of chlorine bleach to add_to clear water : 1 / 2 teaspoon Amount of chlorine bleach to add_to cloudy water : 1 teaspoon Amount of tincture_of_Iodine 2 % to add_to clear water : 3 / 4 teaspoon Amount of tincture_of_Iodine 2 % to add_to cloudy water : 1 1 / 2 teaspoons The Hidden Threat Because of the close proximity of sewage and water_lines under streets , there can be a cross-contamination after breaks caused by earthquakes . Officials are uncertain how much , if any , contamination has occurred until they can survey breaks throughout the system . Graphics by MICHAEL HALL . Research by FREDERICK M .
