   <HEADLINE> MANY SCHOOLS TO SCALE BACK ANNUAL MOCK QUAKE DRILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Principals , teachers and parents are balking at a Los Angeles Unified School District plan to stage a mock magnitude 7.5 earthquake next week , saying the drill would be an all-too-vivid reminder of January ' s 6.8 temblor . Students are still too traumatized by the quake and its aftershocks and will not react well to an extensive practice drill , according to some critics . The annual drill , called Shake ' 94 , could also be difficult for teachers and other school staff_members who lost homes and possessions in the quake . &quot; I think we ' ve had enough practice , &quot; said Maureen Diekmann , the principal at Van Gogh Street Elementary in Granada Hills , which remains closed -- with its students relocated -- because of earthquake damage . &quot; We ' re definitely not going_to do the whole nine yards . We ' re not going_to have anyone hurt and we ' re not going_to have anyone stuck anywhere. &quot; School district officials say that the drill , scheduled for Tuesday , is held every year at this time to coincide with the state-designated Earthquake Preparedness Month and that it is particularly important this year to test schools ' emergency plans . &quot; Do we stop everything ? &quot; said Jim Sugahara , a district administrator who oversees the emergency services office . &quot; If you have a car accident , when do you go_back in the car ? How long do you want us to wait ? I ' d rather see our schools prepared and going_through this exercise than not. &quot; The bulletin sent to schools describing Shake ' 94 tells principals to simulate a magnitude 7.5 quake at 10:30 Tuesday morning . &quot; The impact upon the Metropolitan Los Angeles area is significant , &quot; the memo says . &quot; Power , water , gas , sewer and telephone_systems fail in all areas . Freeway bridges have collapsed , critically disrupting the transportation_system . Fires are reported at district sites . Hazardous materials are released into the air in South Gate . Supt . Sidney A . Thompson declares a state of emergency and orders staff to remain at their sites. &quot; The drill typically is elaborate . Students pretend to be injured or missing and some are carried_off on stretchers . Teachers administer first_aid and conduct search-and-rescue missions . Others hold_up signs depicting fires . A large aftershock hits 25 minutes into the drill . This year , however , principals across the district say it will be a low-key affair . &quot; I don ' t think the kids need to go_through this -- they ' ve been through enough already , &quot; said Dan Balderrama , the principal at Langdon Avenue School in North Hills , where about 70 students just returned after the January quake . &quot; we ' ll just walk through it with the office_staff and support people. &quot; And at Canoga Park Elementary , Assistant Principal Sara Applebaum said : &quot; We ' re still living it . We haven ' t stopped living it . Ideally , we ' d like to not have to think_about this again. &quot; At Hobart Boulevard Elementary near Downtown , teachers will be told to keep reminding students that it is just a practice . &quot; We ' re trying to take every precaution so that our children won ' t be scared by it , &quot; said Betty Daniels , the assistant principal in_charge of the drill . &quot; My main emphasis will be to reassure the children that everything will be all right. &quot; Most principals said instead of conducting a 45-minute drill , they will scale back the exercise to about 10 minutes and avoid giving students much description about the effects of the simulation . Some principals say students have just returned to school , others are sharing homes with two and three families , and still others are getting counseling because of quake trauma . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s wise right now , &quot; said Debbie Moorman , whose daughter attends Kennedy High_School in Granada Hills , where classroom buildings are closed and students take classes in portable bungalows . I think they should wait until at least the fall semester. &quot;</TEXT>
