   <HEADLINE> IT ' S GONNA BE A VIDEO JUNGLE OUT THERE ; VIDEO-GAME STARS DONKEY KONG AND SONIC THE HEDGEHOG WILL BATTLE IT OUT WITH NEW GAMES BACKED BY TECH ADVANCES AND MEGA-MARKETING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On movie screens this fall , Tom Cruise will compete with Robert De Niro . On television , Tim Allen and Kelsey Grammer are duking it out . In record stores , Pearl Jam will square_off against Michael Jackson . And in the world of video_games , look_for the battle of Sonic the Hedgehog and Donkey Kong . The expected hit titles , Sega of America ' s Sonic &amp; Knuckles ( due in_stores Tuesday ) and Nintendo of America ' s Donkey Kong Country ( due Nov . 21 ) , both purport to radically advance 16-bit video-game technology ( the former on Sega ' s Sega Genesis system , the latter on Nintendo ' s Super NES system ) . They will also be backed by unprecedented marketing campaigns : Sonic &amp; Knuckles will be propelled by a worldwide , $ 45-million drive , while Donkey Kong Country will be boosted by $ 16 million in advertising in America alone . By contrast , a high-profile video_game usually receives a $ 5-million send-off . Matthew Franco , supervisor of Game Dude , a video-game shop in North Hollywood , calls the battle &quot; the Nintendo mascot vs . the Sega mascot. &quot; These Hollywood-sized campaigns are reflective of a business that has become as lucrative as movie-making . While the cost of developing a video_game is roughly the same as a modest , independent motion_picture -- roughly between $ 100 # 000 and $ 2 million -- they can make blockbuster-style money , with hits earning more_than $ 100 million in sales . If both games , each retailing for $ 69.95 , meet their sales goals , they ' ll make at least $ 140 million in the United States . Sonic &amp; Knuckles is the fifth Sega Genesis game starring Sonic the Hedgehog , whose $ 1 billion in sales of games and ancillary merchandise makes him easily the hardest working hedgehog in history . This game teams him up with Knuckles , a red Australian Echnidna with dreadlocks , in an effort to defeat Dr. Robotnik and his fearsome Death Egg . The game ' s gimmick is its unique &quot; Lock-On &quot; technology , in which previous Sonic games can be inserted into the top of Sonic &amp; Knuckles while it in turn is inserted in the Sega Genesis game . This will introduce Knuckles and his distinctive movies into the previous Sonic games and allow players to discover new playing_fields hidden in the old games . &quot; This is something that has been two years in development , and we weren ' t sure we ' d be able to do_it until maybe the last six or eight months , &quot; says Roger Hector , director of the Sega Technical Institute . &quot; We were pretty far along in developing this game before we proved to ourselves that technically we could modify the other games. &quot; &quot; Lock-On , &quot; or the physical connection between the two game cartridges , &quot; allows_for potential sharing of game memory , and what was a 16-megabit game , Sonic 3 , when combined with an 18-megabit game in Sonic &amp; Sonic &amp; Knuckles , in_effect becomes a 34-megabit game , &quot; Hector explains . &quot; We had to develop a pretty highfalutin program to allow_for that kind of swapping of memory. &quot; Once the two games are merged , Knuckles becomes the featured character in both Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and 3 . &quot; Knuckles has different abilities . He can climb , fly , glide and punch his way through things that Sonic couldn ' t do , &quot; says Hector . &quot; So not only does he get transported into the game , but the game itself becomes modified , with new places Knuckles can go_to . Knuckles can actually climb to places that Sonic never could . &quot; that ' s the one thing that kids and parents appreciate , &quot; Hector says . &quot; Once they ' ve breathed new life in an older game that isn ' t being played as much anymore , that ' s definitely more bang for the buck. &quot; Franco of Game Dude says , &quot; I think it ' s a really great idea on their part . It ' s the first time anyone has done something like that , but it ' s good marketing . It will get people to go_out and buy the older cartridges. &quot; Sega ' s overall sales goal is to sell 2 million units in America , and another 2 million worldwide . But Nintendo ' s goals for Donkey Kong Country are even more ambitious -- the company hopes to sell 2 million games in the month between the game ' s release and Christmas . Donkey Kong Country revives the ape from Nintendo arcade and video_games a decade back ( said games spawned the string of Mario Bros . games ) , unites him with a sidekick named Diddy Kong , and sets them loose on a playground of some 60 regular playing levels and another 40 secret , hidden levels . Their exploits are rendered in spectacular 3-D images and animation created on Silicon Graphics workstations . Donkey Kong Country , Franco marvels , &quot; has some of the best graphics I ' ve ever seen in a video . It can ' t be compared to anything else . It ' s like high-end computer graphics. &quot; That 2-million sales figure in one month is &quot; unprecedented , &quot; admits Peter Main , the vice_president of marketing for Nintendo of America , &quot; but it ' s based on the off-the-chart reactions we ' ve received from game players and retailers . It ' s something they haven ' t seen enough of , in terms of breakthrough components , that advances the state of game-play , visuals and audio ( the music from the game will be released separately on CD ) . &quot; They see in this product the same things that have been promised for ( more expensive and more powerful ) CD-ROM and 32-bit games and it ' s a miracle that it can be delivered in a 16-bit cartridge. &quot; In order to significantly enhance the texture of the graphics , very little in terms of game play or response_time was lost , according to Dan Owsen , product manager for Nintendo of America . &quot; We did have to sacrifice some color , but it ' s still a 256-color screen , so it ' s close to a personal-computer level of colors. &quot; Owsen adds that an upcoming racing game , UniRacer , will incorporate some of the same style of 3-D graphics . All well and good , but what are the characters in these games like , up close and personal ? Main describes the ape Donkey Kong as &quot; meaningful , &quot; &quot; lovable &quot; and &quot; empathetic. &quot; Diane Fornasier , group marketing director for Genesis and Game Gear , allows that &quot; Knuckles is definitely a bit edgier than Sonic . . . . He definitely has a mission in life , and it ' s a very strong commitment . His edgy attitude is reflected by the knuckles on his fists and his dreadlocks . &quot; It actually gets_to be funny , &quot; Fornasier says , &quot; how we start talking_about these characters like they ' re real . They do have their own personalities . we ' ll say , ' Knuckles would love that ' or ' Knuckles would love to do that. ' &quot;</TEXT>
