   <HEADLINE> SEISMIC REPORT ON COLISEUM AT CENTER OF DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dispute over who was responsible_for failing to provide a 1991 structural engineer ' s report of Coliseum earthquake danger to the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission has degenerated into finger-pointing , with the stadium ' s architects and its managers blaming each other . A central issue -- to be investigated by city , county and state_attorneys -- is why a warning of possible Coliseum earthquake damage was never acted_upon . The warning by engineer Nabib Youssef came_in a seismic report to the HNTB architectural firm , which at the time was preparing Coliseum renovation plans . Youssef ' s report stated that the Coliseum did not meet current seismic construction codes and described potential damage that did , in fact , largely occur in the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake . HNTB architect Terry K . Miller said in an interview last week that in 1990 and 1991 , Spectacor , the Coliseum ' s management company , and the Los Angeles Conservancy , a preservationist group , rejected any seismic retrofit at the Coliseum . Miller said that Spectacor officials informed him in 1991 that a retrofit would cost several million dollars , more_than the firm could afford . He added that as early as a 1990 workshop on Coliseum renovation , conservancy representatives opposed a retrofit because it would alter the appearance of the stadium too dramatically . Officials of Spectacor and the conservancy disputed Miller ' s statements . &quot; We never told ( HNTB ) that seismic retrofitting was out , &quot; said Peter Luucko of Spectacor , who was responsible_for managing the Coliseum at the time . &quot; We simply told them to meet our design and financial criteria . I ' m not going_to tell anyone what criteria to use , because we ' re not qualified to do that. &quot; Tom Michali , a member of the conservancy board who was present at the 1990 workshop , called Miller ' s statements about the conservancy inaccurate . Opposing a seismic retrofit as such &quot; is not something we would ever say , &quot; he said . &quot; What we would want is a retrofit that would be sensitive &quot; to the appearance of the stadium , which is_on the National Register of Historic Places . The leader of the workshop , Michael John Pittas , noted in a separate interview that the final report of the workshop characterizes a retrofit as likely . &quot; The conservancy signed_on to that report , &quot; he said . Miller -- the chief architect at HNTB who was concerned with designing Coliseum renovations -- said that the firm has documents that prove it gave Youssef ' s report to Luucko of Spectacor . But he said the firm would not release the documents at this time . &quot; We were not in a position to determine what was going_to happen to the report &quot; once it got_to Spectacor , he added , saying it was the prerogative of the managers and not the architects to decide whether to give it to the Coliseum Commission . &quot; We were not working for the commission at the time , &quot; Miller said . The commission , the Coliseum ' s governing board , hired Spectacor in 1988 to manage the facility and the adjacent Sports Arena . Luucko , however , said he received 200 to 300 separate reports from HNTB , and he does not specifically recall receiving Youssef ' s report . &quot; These were very technical reports , and you rely_on your technical people , &quot; Luucko said . &quot; All I can say is , it didn ' t send up a red flag . . . . I might have gotten_it and it didn ' t register. &quot; Chris Joseph of Environmental Planning Associates is also unhappy that Youssef ' s report was not provided . Environmental Planning Associates was charged in 1991 with preparing a draft environmental impact report for Coliseum renovations . No final environmental impact report was produced because the ambitious renovation project was dropped . But there was a draft of several hundred pages prepared by Nov . 20 , 1991 , that Miller said HNTB relied_upon , in part , for concluding that the earthquake danger at the Coliseum was not particularly ominous . The environmental report said quake damage at the Coliseum would diminish in direct proportion to the distance to earthquake epicenters , and it put most faults at a considerable distance . This was at_variance with discoveries in some previous earthquakes -- such_as the 1985 Mexico_City quake and the 1989 Loma Prieta quake -- that severe damage could occur irregularly at varying distances from the epicenters . Joseph , however , said that HNTB should have passed Youssef ' s report , which was dated Dec . 4 , 1991 , to him . If Joseph had received it , he said , Youssef ' s assessment would have been incorporated in later versions of the draft environmental impact report . &quot; This is damage_control by HNTB , or spin control , &quot; Joseph said of Miller ' s statements . &quot; We should have seen the Youssef report . . . . The bottom_line is that HNTB blew it . . . . I can ' t imagine them doing_it intentionally , but it probably just slipped through the cracks. &quot; * Tom Bonaventura , chief_assistant Los Angeles city attorney , said he does not know how long the inquiry into the_matter , ordered by the Los Angeles City_Council , will take . Bonaventura has served as an advisory attorney from the city to the commission . He said another longtime commission adviser , Donovan Main , the county ' s attorney advising the tripartite commission , and Richard Magasin , the state ' s legal adviser to the panel , will also participate in the inquiry . None of the attorneys saw the Youssef report either , until it was delivered to the Coliseum Commission more_than two years after it was first made , 16 days after the Northridge earthquake , Bonaventura said . As the controversy swirls , the disputing central parties remain active at the Coliseum and are working together on current plans to repair the Coliseum . Miller is the principal architect , Spectacor still manages the Coliseum , and the L.A. Conservancy has an important consultants ' role . Youssef was hired last month to evaluate the quake damage . The commission itself came under criticism Tuesday in City_Council for awarding a Coliseum repair contract to the Tutor-Saliba construction company without bids or a precise price_tag . First estimates put the cost at $ 35 million , with funding expected from the federal and state disaster relief programs . ( Southland Edition ) Quakes and the Coliseum Here are some of the key events regarding the Los Angeles Coliseum since late 1990 : * Sept . 11 , 1990 : Raiders owner Al Davis signs an agreement to keep his team in Los Angeles , contingent_on a $ 145-million renovation of the Coliseum by the Spectacor Management Group . * Dec . 15 : Four-day environmental workshop on Coliseum renovation concludes with little public discussion of seismic reinforcing . Final report calls such work likely . * Nov . 20 , 1991 : A draft environmental impact report on the proposed renovation notes that 123 earthquakes over magnitude 5 have occurred within 100 miles of the Coliseum since 1800 , the closest a magnitude 5.3 one mile away in 1905 . * Dec . 4 : Structural engineer Nabib Youssef submits a report to Spectacor ' s architect , HNTB , saying that the Coliseum walls do not meet seismic safety codes and would be seriously damaged in a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on the nearby Newport-Inglewood Fault . * Dec . 31 : Spectacor , blaming the bad economy and disappointing sales of club seats , puts the renovation on hold . The firm later cancels it and gives_up its role in renovating the stadium . * Dec . 2 , 1992 : Coliseum Commission , approving a scaled-down $ 15-million renovation to be done with its own funds in 1993 , states that no &quot; permanent seismic retrofit or seismic strengthening work &quot; is to be done as part of the work . * Sept . 4 , 1993 : The $ 15-million renovation is completed . * Jan . 17 , 1994 : The magnitude 6.8 Northridge earthquake , centered 20 miles away , seriously damages the Coliseum , which is red tagged by city building inspectors . First damage estimates are $ 35 million . * Feb . 2 : The Coliseum Commission meets and demands a copy of the Dec . 4 , 1991 , Youssef report . Later that afternoon , it is delivered -- 16 days after the earthquake . * Feb . 9 : The Los Angeles City_Council instructs City Atty . James Hahn to investigate who is responsible_for the failure to apprise the Coliseum Commission of the Youssef report until after the earthquake .</TEXT>
