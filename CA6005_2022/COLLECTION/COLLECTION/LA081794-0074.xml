   <HEADLINE> KIMBLE VOWS TO BOUNCE_BACK ; FORMER LOYOLA STAR CHASES NBA DREAM DESPITE FAILURES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bo Kimble still believes . The feeling he has now is not so very different from the adrenaline-primed determination that carried him and his Loyola Marymount teammates on that spine-tingling NCAA tournament run after Hank Gathers had collapsed on the court and died in 1990 . His belief is dogged and passionate -- and probably a little irrational . Kimble still believes he can play in the NBA . It has been little more_than four years since the Clippers made Kimble a lottery pick by taking him eighth in the NBA draft . It was a decision that ranks among the worst of the Clippers ' bad ones . At 28 , Kimble ' s career is a shambles . What remained of his five-year , $ 7.25-million contract was bought_out by the New York Knicks last year after he had appeared in only nine games the season before . He was even sent_packing by a French team in December when his struggling Lyon club made personnel changes . His name has become synonymous with a wasted pick -- a player who might bomb is &quot; another Bo Kimble. &quot; Even a 68-point game last month in the summer pro league at UC Irvine didn ' t convince many scouts that he will ever make_it in the NBA . &quot; People don ' t think he can play , &quot; said one scout who wants to see Kimble make_it but doubts he will . &quot; I ' m not going_to give_up , &quot; Kimble said . &quot; For a long time. &quot; * Kimble has always had an amiable confidence about him , but now that assurance seems more_than a little deluded . He is one of the few who believes his failure has been merely a question of circumstance and opportunity -- and the misfortune of being a Clipper . &quot; A lot of guys who I ' ve played against and who I ' ve dominated throughout my career , I see them playing , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s really hard for me because I know I should be out there also . Guys like Lionel Simmons , Pooh Richardson , these are guys who are friends of mine , but guys I used to get_the_best of throughout my career . So it ' s frustrating to see them playing and know that I belong out there and not to have that opportunity. &quot; NBA scouts say there ' s a reason : The abilities that made him the NCAA scoring champion with a 35.3-point average in 1990 have not translated to the NBA . Some question his quickness . Most question his defense . Others question his strength or ballhandling , or wonder what position he really should play , shooting guard or small forward . Still others think the Loyola system that made him famous created a player who can ' t adjust to the NBA game . Even the one thing that always seemed rock-solid-certain about Kimble came_into question once he reached the NBA : his outside shot . At Loyola , he rained_down jumpers from beyond the pro three-point line , shooting 41 % from three-point range his senior season , and 53 % overall . His first year in the NBA , he made 29 % of his three-point shots and a wretched 38 % overall . Kimble understands this is an important summer , and his goal was clear : He needed numbers . Numbers got him attention in Loyola ' s prolific scoring game , and he needed them again . Desperate to catch some scout ' s eye , he called clear-out after clear-out to take his man one on one . He got his numbers , averaging 35 points and shooting 57 % , 35 % from three-point range . Still , not many are convinced . &quot; He looks_like the same Bo Kimble to me , &quot; said Frank Hamblen , assistant coach for the Milwaukee Bucks , after watching Kimble play . &quot; Defense is not a priority in his game . He has a selfish game , a shooter ' s mentality . But maybe he ' s just playing to his game , because he can really shoot the ball with great range . &quot; He ' s a guy I think really needs to learn the structure part of basketball instead of up and down and let_it_go . I don ' t think he benefits by playing in the L.A. summer league per se , unless he gets with a coach who ' s going_to have some structure . This is like he played in college , up and down , up and down. &quot; Though he drove the lane with ease against lax summer defense , not many are convinced he can do_it regularly in the NBA , where the guards are quicker and Hakeem Olajuwon and Dikembe Mutombo wait in the lane . Kimble laughs . &quot; I ' ve never had a problem getting_to the basket , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ve just had a problem getting_on the court to get_to the basket . I ' m not deterred at all , though . I ' m hoping that before the later years I do get a true opportunity because I have a lot to show people. &quot; He might have to show them in the CBA first . The Rapid City Thrillers recently traded for his rights , gambling they can sign him , even though Kimble would prefer the NBA or Europe . &quot; Players like Bo are really what the CBA is good for , &quot; said Eric Musselman , coach and general_manager of the Thrillers and the son of Bill Musselman , the former Minnesota Timberwolves ' coach . &quot; I think especially with expansion , Toronto and Vancouver coming_in , the CBA is a good route . A lot of times players in this league can build their confidence up , and playing here becomes a short-term thing to help them get_back to the NBA . . . . I know this : If he plays in our league , he ' ll be back in the NBA. &quot; * It ' s easy to forget that Kimble ' s NBA career began well . With Ron Harper out with a knee injury , Kimble started 22 of his first 23 games as a pro . John Hammond , a former Clipper assistant coach who is now an assistant and director of scouting for the Detroit Pistons , remembers the excitement surrounding Kimble ' s arrival . &quot; It was amazing , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' d go_around during the exhibition_season and they would introduce Charles Smith , Danny Manning , Ken Norman . Then they ' d announce Bo , and he got a standing_ovation everywhere we went. &quot; But despite some high-scoring games , by December , inconsistency and a spiraling shooting percentage had cost Kimble his starting job . Harper returned and Kimble ' s playing time dwindled to single-digits , when he played . His confidence crisis deepened , and he never recovered . &quot; With the Clippers , I was told not to play the way I played_at Loyola Marymount , &quot; he said . &quot; Not to shoot a lot of jumpers . They put emphasis on that . Therefore I was caught into hesitating on shots I knew I could make . &quot; I ' m used to unity , and there was no unity on the Clippers . I ' m used to playing as a team and being together . But NBA basketball is quite different than anything I ' ve experienced . I didn ' t have the support of the coach ( Mike Schuler ) . If you ' re drafted to be the scorer and the shooter , and your coach is telling you , ' You ' re not at Loyola . Don ' t shoot this shot , don ' t shoot this shot. ' Well , then you start to wonder . I kind of lost my identity of who I really was . If I can ' t shoot and score , do what I do best , well , then what do you want me to do ? &quot; Hammond spent a lot of time with Kimble after practices , and found himself amazed at Kimble ' s shooting ability , then equally amazed that he couldn ' t seem to show the same touch in games . &quot; He still has put_on some of the most amazing shooting performances I ' ve seen , not in a game , but just shooting around , &quot; Hammond said . &quot; He ' d shoot 25 three-pointers , NBA range , and make 20 . He ' d shoot 25 again , make 21 . He ' d do that consistently , but then he ' d get_in a game , and he didn ' t do it. &quot; In 1992 , Kimble was traded to the Knicks , a throw-in in the trade that brought Mark Jackson to L.A. He was an unneeded fifth guard , and he spent most of the season on the bench or injured . &quot; Knowing the things I know now , I would n ' t have wanted to play for the Clippers , &quot; Kimble said . &quot; It doesn ' t represent what true NBA basketball is about . When I went_to the Knicks , I personally feel I went from worst-class to first-class. &quot; Paul Westhead , Kimble ' s coach at Loyola , said he is still &quot; a little puzzled &quot; over Kimble ' s difficulties . &quot; I thought he was the kind of player who would always find a way to score , &quot; said Westhead , now at George Mason University after an unsuccessful stint with the Denver Nuggets . &quot; Whether that meant he ' d be a standstill jump shooter or a guy who ' d take it to the basket or somewhere in between , I didn ' t know . But I thought he was a very creative offensive player . &quot; I knew there ' d be hurdles to overcome ( adjusting to the NBA ) , but I thought he had a confidence about him that he would do fine . . . . I thought his outside shot would have been good_enough to carry him. &quot; It wasn ' t . &quot; Early on , I was surprised at his reluctance to shoot the ball , &quot; said Westhead , who was coaching Denver at the time . &quot; All at once he became a passer . He ' d get the ball and reverse it . That wasn ' t Bo . Bo gets the ball and says , ' I ' m going_to score. ' That was a sign he wasn ' t comfortable with his game or the game . &quot; Then it becomes easy to track . Once your minutes go_down , if you ' re a shooter you start playing tight . If you ' re not making shots , your minutes keep going_down , and unfortunately what happens to a player is he begins to second-guess his shot and he goes spinning downward. &quot; More_than one scout thinks Loyola ' s system hurt Kimble ' s pro career -- pointing_out that it didn ' t work in Denver . &quot; He might have been the all-time guy who was in the right place at the right time , &quot; one said . &quot; Maybe the Loyola system , which made him what he is and got him his money , also put him in the position he is in . The way Loyola played wasn ' t about defense . It wasn ' t about doing the little things . It was just about outrunning everybody and outscoring everybody . There was no such thing as a bad shot for Bo Kimble at Loyola . In the NBA , there is. &quot; Even Kimble says &quot; the system &quot; made stars out of some marginal players , but he does not mean to include himself . He remains convinced he has the talent to make_it . &quot; The players know I belong out there , &quot; he said . &quot; The people who watch the game , they don ' t understand . All they see is Bo Kimble , great shooter , great scorer , not playing . So they think a variety of things . But the players , among ourselves , we know who has the talent to contribute. &quot; The way Kimble has always carried himself means there are a lot of people in his corner . &quot; Even I got caught_up in ( Loyola ' s story ) , &quot; Hammond said . &quot; He was so possessed , the way he played , the way he carried himself . I mean , he was_on ' The Today Show ' and all those others . I said , ' What a person . This guy really believes. ' &quot; He still believes , but the odds are lengthening , especially at 28 . &quot; It looks_like it hasn ' t worked for him , &quot; Westhead said . &quot; It could have , perhaps , with good_luck and confidence , gone the other way . If Bo Kimble were a starting guard in the NBA , nobody would have been surprised . &quot; But the NBA is a tough league . There are always new players coming_up each year . They get the biggest contracts and there isn ' t a lot of room left . If you don ' t make_it in the first couple of years of your contract , there are a lot of replacements stockpiled behind you . &quot; Bo , I think , is a very resilient and tough-minded guy , especially when the odds are against him . He ' s the kind of guy , if you push him , he ' ll play better . The question now is , is anybody listening ? For his sake , I really hope so . &quot; All it takes is one team that has a need . I think that ' s the harder part . I don ' t think it ' s a cracked Bo Kimble who can ' t get his game together . I think he can and will . . . . I hope for him that he does. &quot;</TEXT>
