   <HEADLINE> THE ARTFUL EXILE FROM DUSHANBE ; FIRST DAVLAT KHUDONAZAROV LOST THE PRESIDENCY OF HIS BELOVED TAJIKISTAN , THEN HE LOST EVERYTHING ELSE . FORCED INTO EXILE , THE CHARISMATIC FILMMAKER AND POLITICIAN MAY BE HIS COUNTRY ' S GREAT HOPE FOR UNITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a crisp winter morning last February , many of Washington ' s ranking gurus in the ways and wiles of the old Soviet_Union slipped out of offices at government_agencies , think_tanks and universities to gather at Georgetown ' s arty Biograph movie_theater . The occasion was a screening of &quot; First Morning of Youth , &quot; a 14-year-old film in Russian shot in the remote Pamir Mountains of the Himalayas about the human impact of the 1917 communist revolution -- a revolution now distinctly over . The film might have seemed passe , except that it was made by Davlat Khudonazarov , the charismatic chairman of the Filmmakers ' Union in Moscow who has emerged from the Soviet ashes as one of the region ' s new political stars . Indeed , his record in mixing politics and art over the past five years would shame any of Hollywood ' s activists . &quot; In his kind of artistic and political activism , the stakes are much higher , &quot; said Blair Ruble , director of the Smithsonian Institution ' s Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies . &quot; At every point of his life , he ' s been pushing the envelope further and further , first in terms of artistic expression and then in politics . And he ' s never wavered , despite the odds. &quot; Artistically , Khudonazarov ' s haunting movies are_best described as a cross between Steven Spielberg ' s portrayal of history ' s obscenities in &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and Robert Altman ' s portrait of human foibles in &quot; Short Cuts. &quot; Because of their searing morality and simple human settings , the New Republic described his films as &quot; touchingly poetic in the manner of Satyajit Ray , &quot; the great Indian director . For &quot; First Morning , &quot; Khudonazarov won two of the 15 major film prizes he ' s accumulated from both the Soviet_Union and his native Tajikistan over a 28-year career . French critic Jean Radvanyi cited the film as an example of a new genre : &quot; The poetic metaphor , particular to the Tajik national mind , gave_birth to classic grand works , as poetic as they are epic. &quot; &quot; First Morning &quot; also won wide praise from Washington ' s experts on the region . &quot; In lyrical feeling and cinematographic technique , it ranks with any of the films that have received Academy Award nominations for best foreign film in recent years , &quot; said Harley Balzer , director of Russian Area Studies at Georgetown University . Politically , Khudonazarov has been widely compared by the Western press to Vaclav Havel , Czechoslovakia ' s foremost playwright who became his country ' s first freely elected president . Khudonazarov first emerged in the late 1980s as a reformist in the Soviet Congress of People ' s Deputies and the Supreme Soviet as both went_through the pangs of change and eventual self-dissolution . After the union broke_up in 1991 , he was then drafted by the new Democratic Party to run_for president of Tajikistan , the poorest and southernmost of the 15 former Soviet republics . He had widespread support , ranging from the labor_movement to the Islamic Renaissance Party , and it was easy to see why . A man of immense energy with an endearing smile and talkative hands , Khudonazarov looks_like an artist but can talk like a learned politician . His black hair is slightly long and shaggy , his dark beard tipped with white . When he smiles , as he does often , the still strong youthfulness in his face makes him look almost impish ; when he ' s serious , his deep_brown eyes turn soulful . Either way , he ' s accessible , candid and generally simpatico . Unlike Havel , however , he lost the 1991 presidential election . Of seven candidates , he finished second in a contest that experts both in and outside the region believe was rigged against him . The election was won by the Communist_Party -- the only one in any of the former Soviet republics defiantly still ruling under its original name . Within weeks , the tensions that played_out before and during the election disintegrated into what still ranks as the most violent war in any of the former Soviet republics . Up to 50 # 000 Tajiks have been killed and half a_million -- or 10 % of the 5 million population -- forced to flee into the countryside , to neighboring Afghanistan or to Moscow . Among the new refugees were Khudonazarov and his family . Late last year , the war waned as the government consolidated its hold with the help of Russian troops and , according to the international human_rights group Helsinki Watch , &quot; gross violations of human_rights , &quot; including summary executions , disappearances and actions by paramilitary groups that &quot; openly terrorize &quot; suspected Tajik dissidents . Tajikistan now has a reputation as the most ruthless regime spawned by the union ' s demise . But Khudonazarov hasn ' t given_up . He is still campaigning for democratic change even though he has to do_it on the run -- exiled from his country and robbed of his home , belongings , resources and even his precious films . For the Biograph showing , he had to borrow a copy from a Moscow museum . I FIRST MET KHUDONAZAROV IN DUSHANBE , THE TAJIK CAPITAL , IN 1991 . I was_on a tour of the five republics in Central Asia shortly after the abortive August coup against Mikhail S . Gorbachev that was the death_knell for the Soviet_Union . The five little &quot; stans &quot; with tongue-twisting names -- which included Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan -- had just declared independence from Moscow , ending more_than 150 years of Russian imperial and then Soviet communist rule . Open_to visitors for the first time , they were exotic new places waiting to be discovered by the outside world . Tajikistan was my last stop . Despite the sterile Stalinesque architecture and the imposed Russian language and culture in each capital , Central Asia had managed to defy Russian absorption . The look and feel of the region -- waist-high gladioli in city parks , vast cotton fields or rugged mountains still populated by nomadic herdsmen in the countryside , bright ethnic dress and a sunny , temperate climate -- are quite distinct . So are the people . Unlike the residents of their European sister republics , the Tajiks and their ethnic brethren are truly Asian . Their features reflect the widely varying mixture of Indo-European , Turkic and Mongol tribes and traders that for centuries roamed the steppes and the ancient Silk Route from China through Central Asia and the Mideast to Europe . They are also predominantly Muslim , and many are now in the process of rediscovering their Sunni faith . For the Soviets as well as the earlier Russian monarchy , keeping Tajikistan and its Central Asian sisters in_line was always an issue . In the 1920s , after a series of uprisings , Stalin arbitrarily divided legendary Turkestan into five separate republics to prevent a lasting pan-Turkic or pan-Islamic bloc from emerging inside the southern Soviet frontier . Then he forcibly moved millions of Russians to &quot; settle , &quot; administer and effectively Russify Central Asia . Yet throughout its existence , the Soviet_Union ' s sharpest internal split remained between the European provinces and the Asian republics . When I arrived in the Tajik capital , Khudonazarov , who was in the throes of campaigning for the presidency , most personified the excitement and expectations then in the air . On the back stairs outside an old house used by the local labor_movement -- where the biggest poster was of Arnold Schwarzenegger -- we began a conversation that would resume again and again over the next three years . During that first meeting , Khudonazarov reflected briefly on the ironies in an erratic career that led him to become the premier democrat in Tajikistan and one of the first in all_the old union . &quot; Until I ran_for the presidency , the most dramatic moment in my life was in 1956 , during the 12th Congress of the Communist_Party , when Stalin was disgraced , &quot; he recalled . &quot; I was a teen-ager and it was a very hard moment for me . I believed_in Stalin . I was brought_up in the Tajik mountains , the son of peasants , living the life of a shepherd . Up in those mountains , Stalin was a god . All of a sudden , he turned_out to be bad. &quot; We talked_about his platform , of his hopes to reconcile European and Islamic cultures as the basis for coexistence both internally and regionally . He explained the need to devolve power from Dushanbe ' s clannish elite to Tajikistan ' s diverse and often rival provinces . And he outlined economic reforms to attract European as well as nearby Asian interest and investment . He was realistic , however , about the depth of independent Tajikistan ' s problems . &quot; We don ' t have proper sovereignty yet . we ' ll need something like the Marshall Plan to revive this republic and to eventually achieve real independence . If we gain economic freedom , political freedom will follow , &quot; he said . The biggest obstacle to democracy was indeed Tajikistan ' s pervasive poverty . An average Tajik earned less than half of a Russian ' s income in 1988 . By 1991 , Tajikistan accounted_for less than 1 % of the Soviet economic output . Tajikistan , which is 90 % mountains , was always the least developed region of the Soviet_Union . During my visit , Dushanbe had a worn feeling about it , from crumbling roads to low-wattage bulbs in public buildings that made rooms dim even during daylight hours . Although the other Central Asian capitals were flowing with local agricultural produce , Dushanbe ' s open-air_market had pitifully little . Bread_lines were starting to be a problem . And if its department_stores were any guide , Dushanbe , the most distant capital from Moscow , seemed to be a dumping ground . Rural areas of Tajikistan were less polluted , congested and crumbling , but visiting them was like going_back in time . Resources were so scarce that candidate Khudonazarov had little more_than pocket_money to pay_for a presidential race in a country almost four times the size of Switzerland . He had no paid support staff . But the problem wasn ' t just finances . Publicity videotapes made at state-owned television turned_out -- always &quot; accidentally &quot; -- to be blank or to have other technical problems when they were supposed to be broadcast . Khudonazarov also had trouble just getting campaign posters , which local companies refused to print . &quot; They had all worked for the Communist_Party . So for me , they were otherwise engaged , &quot; he explained , with a wry grin . Khudonazarov was also realistic about the enduring hold of the old communists . &quot; Decolonialization will take 10 or 15 years . We know for_sure that the way will be difficult , &quot; he predicted . &quot; On the one hand , we have the forces of renewal , and on the other the hanging on of a feudal regime and the nomenklatura . The battle won ' t end with the election. &quot; His local fame and his winsome character probably made Khudonazarov the only person who had any hope of succeeding . &quot; Davlat played a heroic role in standing_up and running as an opposition candidate , &quot; remarked the Smithsonian Institution ' s Blair Ruble . &quot; The government had never faced opposition . And had he not run , there probably would n ' t have been a serious candidate . But in so doing , he put his life on the line. &quot; KHUDONAZAROV ' S FORAY INTO POLITICS PARALLELS HIS FILM CAREER . Indeed , the two often intersect . The obstructions in both would have exhausted lesser men , although getting him to talk_about the ordeals isn ' t easy . &quot; My first film in 1966 was a 10-minute short called ' Lullaby ' about life in the Pamir Mountains . I thought it was lyrical and warm . The critics said it marked the beginning of poetry in film in Tajikistan . It showed village life -- people dressed as they really were , dirty and working in the fields , &quot; he told the audience at the Biograph theater . &quot; I didn ' t think it was negative . But it was banned as anti-Soviet . &quot; At the time , all documentaries showed the sunny side of life . There were parades , people were well-dressed and well-shaven . And every film that had been done before on the Pamirs was about people in colorful clothing happily collecting the harvest -- like it was a festival . That was the kind of image that the government wanted to present. &quot; Khudonazarov ' s &quot; Lullaby , &quot; with its subliminal focus_on Tajikistan ' s ancient Pamiri mountain culture , was also exactly what Moscow and its surrogates in Dushanbe most feared . The government burned all copies . Only 22 at the time , Khudonazarov had already proven to be an exception . He was admitted to the All Union Institute of Film in Moscow at age 16 . But because of &quot; Lullaby , &quot; the government didn ' t even let his next film get_off_the_ground . It was to be a documentary about the millions who perished in Stalin ' s massive purges in the 1930s . Khudonazarov had spent a year buried in state archives personally researching several cases , including one about Tajikistan ' s first leader , who was also the first Tajik to be purged . The idea behind the unmade movie clearly preoccupied him . But it wasn ' t until one of our final talks that he mentioned another morsel from his research . In the archives , he also uncovered information about his own family -- grandparents who had been shot and parents who , as children , had been separated and dispatched to camps for &quot; children of the enemies of the people. &quot; &quot; I ' ve always been intrigued with history and its lessons , &quot; he said , in explaining why he ' d chosen this subject for his first full-length film . &quot; I wanted people to know the truth and to tell them about the people who had been forgotten . The lack of knowledge separates generations from each other . Knowledge connects people. &quot; With his first film destroyed and his second banned , Khudonazarov spent the next 13 years restricted to lower-level jobs as director of photography on nine films and 15 documentary shorts . He finally got a break_in 1978 , when Moscow television gave permission to shoot &quot; First Morning. &quot; It won rave reviews . Not surprisingly , Khudonazarov had resisted the Communist_Party throughout the 1960s and ' 70s . &quot; They asked me to join many times , but each time I said no . I thought I was so rebellious that I ' d be fired , &quot; he said , chuckling . But in 1982 , after a friend advised him that prospects of making his own films would probably end if he turned_down another &quot; invitation , &quot; he finally signed_up . &quot; I also thought I could make a difference inside the party . I decided I was ready to fight the conservatives in the party . So I became the opposition inside it. &quot; This didn ' t end his professional problems . In 1984 , he directed a documentary on the history of Tajikistan . It , too , was promptly banned . Tajik Communist_Party boss Rakhman Nabiyev said the film , which ran 90 minutes , was too long . But as reform swept the Kremlin in the late ' 80s , Khudonazarov ' s star rose . For a change , he had the right credentials . In 1989 , he was elected to the Soviet Parliament . In 1990 , he was named to the Supreme Soviet ' s Committee on Science , Public Education and Culture . Forced to put his films on hold , he told a Western journalist at the time that he felt &quot; as if I ' m neglecting one of my children. &quot; But he lasted less than two years . After the August , 1991 , putsch against Gorbachev , he quit the party in frustration and anger . &quot; Democratizing the party turned_out to be too hard a task . The party ' s reactionary essence led to its inevitable demise , &quot; he told me two months later . Khudonazarov was ready to go_back to making movies full time , and he had plenty to do with the Soviet Filmmakers ' Union , which had elected him chairman in 1990 . Then the Soviet_Union fell_into 15 independent pieces , and he instead found himself running_for the presidency against Communist_Party candidate Nabiyev -- the old party_boss who ' d banned his films . In the end , he lost and , for the time being , so did democracy in Tajikistan . By official count , Khudonazarov won 30.5 % of the vote , Nabiyev 57 % . Afterward , he urged reconciliation . &quot; I gave speeches and said , whether we like the new president or not , he is elected . And while he is the first , he will not be the last . We have to find legal paths to build a civil society and a legitimate government , &quot; he explained . Khudonazarov returned to Moscow , where he was asked to stay_on as chairman of the new Confederation of Filmmakers ' Unions . But as trouble , including secessionist demands , spiraled in the first_half of 1992 , Tajik politicians and friends appealed_to him to return and help mediate . &quot; He had been in the hospital with a heart problem , but they said they needed his help , so he went anyway , &quot; said his wife , Gavhar Djuraeva , who has collaborated on some of her husband ' s films . &quot; For almost a month , he went_to the places where there was trouble or fighting to speak_to both sides . It was terribly dangerous because not everyone wanted peace . Four times they tried to kill him . I remember how he ' d call me at 3 a.m. or 6 a.m. and say , ' See , I ' m still alive. ' But eventually he got them around a peace table . After that , many prisoners were freed. &quot; According to Nancy Lubin , a Central Asian specialist at the Center for Post-Soviet Studies , &quot; Davlat has that rare combination of impressive , creative intellect and enormous political skill . As confrontation among the former communists and opposition democratic and Islamic factions intensified , he became the only mediator with whom all_of the warring parties were willing to talk. &quot; But the ceasefire lasted only a month , as the Tajik president undermined his efforts . Tensions there disintegrated into full-scale war . Then , shortly after his last trip in December , 1992 , Khudonazarov was indicted in absentia for inciting rebellion -- despite an earlier parliamentary commendation for his peace efforts . The charges carry a death sentence . &quot; He became a symbol of the opposition against the government , &quot; Lubin said . &quot; The debate centered around him . So he became a target. &quot; In subsequent government raids on his home , his films were seized and destroyed -- and much of his life ' s work disappeared . WHEN THE RUSSIAN PRESS REPORTED LAST YEAR THAT HIT_MEN WERE pursuing Khudonazarov as far as Moscow , the director-politician was at the San Francisco Film Festival . He later reflected that attending the festival probably saved him and his family , including his son and daughter . &quot; There are many members of the Tajik parliament , including the former speaker , the one who ordered Lenin ' s statue taken_down after independence , who have since disappeared , &quot; he said . &quot; Nobody knows what happened to them . The speaker is believed to be dead , although no one has found his body. &quot; With the help of friends , Khudonazarov stayed in the United States . He ' s now a guest scholar at the Kennan Institute , and will be a Peace Fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace this fall . Some experts believe he may_not be safe even in the United States . But he refuses to seek asylum , so he can maintain Tajik citizenship and return home . He misses the sources of inspiration the most . &quot; Especially for an artist , living_in the spirituality of one ' s homeland is everything , &quot; he said one afternoon in Washington . &quot; It ' s my father , my mother , the air , the trees . It ' s the songs_and_dances . And the fact that I ' ve been torn_away from them is the most difficult thing. &quot; Yet he spoke more with frustration than anger . &quot; There ' s a special quality about Davlat that combines sophistication and simplicity in a way you can ' t forget , &quot; Ruble said . &quot; He is clearly someone who has strong principles and beliefs by which he lives . There are a_few remarkable human_beings like that , and you feel it when you ' re in his presence. &quot; In Washington , he ' s still working_on Tajikistan ' s political crisis . He ' s met with leading U.S. policy-makers . He speaks_to foreign affairs groups or anyone else who ' ll listen . And he ' s studying . &quot; I often think_about my presidential campaign platform . We knew what we wanted to do , but we didn ' t know how to do_it . I want to understand how the democratic system works -- the mechanisms from the ground_level to the top , &quot; he explained . But Khudonazarov claims he has no further personal political ambitions and that he ' s quit running_for office , adding : &quot; Once I have this knowledge , of how practically to produce change , I ' d like to work with whoever is interested . Then I ' d be happy to make my movies again. &quot; I once asked Khudonazarov about his favorite film . &quot; ' One Flew Over the Cuckoo ' s Nest , ' &quot; he said . &quot; Because of the absurdities and injustice ? &quot; I asked . &quot; No , &quot; he replied . &quot; Because of the freedom. &quot;</TEXT>
