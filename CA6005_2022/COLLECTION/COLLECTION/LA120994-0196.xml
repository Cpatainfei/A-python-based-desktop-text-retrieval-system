   <HEADLINE> WILSON OKS BAY CLEANUP PLAN , BUT OBSTACLES REMAIN ; POLLUTION : DISPUTE AMONG ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND A PROBE HEADED BY SENATE COMMITTEE LEADER TOM HAYDEN THREATENS PROPOSAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite approval Thursday by Gov . Pete Wilson , a long-awaited strategy to clean_up Santa Monica Bay faces formidable obstacles because of a rift between environmentalists and rebukes from state Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) , who heads a legislative committee that has begun investigating the plan . The plan -- which outlines priorities for spending $ 67 million on repairing one of the Los Angeles area ' s most popular and beleaguered natural_resources -- was conceived last spring after five years of consensus building among warring factions of business representatives , environmentalists , government regulators and scientists . On Thursday , Wilson endorsed the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project ' s action plan &quot; without condition , &quot; calling it a vital , ambitious and broad approach to reduce pollution and restore the ecology of the bay , which stretches_along 50 miles of Los Angeles County coast . The plan awaits approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and funding from the state Legislature . The Santa Monica Bay project &quot; reinforces my belief in the effectiveness of bringing_together industry , government , conservationists and the general public to create cost-effective solutions to environmental problems , &quot; Wilson said in a letter sent Thursday to EPA Administrator Carol Browner . However , the blueprint for bay cleanup has divided local environmentalists . Some call it a half-hearted effort that could worsen ocean pollution , while others say it is a pragmatic approach given the difficulty of the task . Hayden , chairman of the Senate ' s natural_resources committee , said he wants the plan either strengthened or dumped into &quot; the dustbin of history &quot; after hearing the concerns of some environmentalists at a four-hour hearing Thursday in Santa Monica . &quot; While I remain open_to argument , it is my judgment that the plan does not live_up_to expectations , &quot; Hayden said . &quot; It fails to adequately address many of the most serious sources of bay pollution. &quot; The senator lambasted the committee that drafted the plan for giving more votes to members from industries and state regulators -- whom he blamed for the bay ' s problems -- than to environmental and scientific groups . Environmentalists say the plan targets urban runoff and wetlands restoration , but goes easy on the bay ' s industrial polluters -- most notably Chevron , Los Angeles International Airport and two power_plants . &quot; It puts a Band-Aid on a gaping wound and makes everybody believe that ' s enough . Unfortunately , it probably has poison within the Band-Aid , &quot; said Terry Tamminen of Santa Monica BayKeeper , a citizens program that monitors threats to the bay . However , members of Heal the Bay and the American Oceans Campaign -- which helped draft the plan -- defended the result . &quot; If all ( the proposals ) were implemented , the bay would be much better_off than it is now , &quot; said Mark Gold , a senior scientist at Heal the Bay . &quot; There are a lot of very , very positive recommendations , but there are certainly some shortcomings. &quot; U.S. EPA Western Regional Administrator Felicia Marcus -- a former leader of Heal the Bay -- joined Wilson in supporting the plan , saying it has widespread support and urging Hayden to endorse it and seek creative sources of funding . State and local officials and environmentalists have been struggling for almost 20 years to find ways to improve the condition of the bay , where swimmers and aquatic life are threatened by a mix of urban runoff and industrial pollution . The plan contains about 250 suggestions , emphasizing 73 as priorities , including $ 9 million to hire more city and county staff to manage storm water runoff , $ 3.5 million to educate small businesses about pollution prevention , $ 5 million to restore the Ballona Wetlands and $ 1 million to investigate illegal sewage connections . But it does not offer recommendations about Chevron ' s oil_tankers off El Segundo , a proposed oil_pipeline , commercial sale of contaminated fish or how to handle the millions of pounds of the pesticide DDT that pollute the waters off the Palos Verdes Peninsula . Although about $ 22 million for the plan could come from private donors and government grants , there is no known source for another $ 44.5 million that is needed , said Catherine Tyrrell , the project ' s director and a state water quality official . Thursday ' s hearing was largely a forum for Hayden , a longtime environmentalist , to denounce the plan and the state ' s Los Angeles Regional Water Quality_Control Board for being &quot; too cozy with the polluters. &quot;</TEXT>
