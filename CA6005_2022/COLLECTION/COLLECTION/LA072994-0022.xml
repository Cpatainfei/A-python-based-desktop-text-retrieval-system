   <HEADLINE> CIRCLING BETWEEN OBLIVION AND THE STARS , A POET OF FLIGHT CALLS TO US ; SAINT-EXUPERY : ' THE LITTLE PRINCE ' AUTHOR VANISHED 50 YEARS AGO THIS WEEKEND IN WARTIME SERVICE TO FRANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fifty years ago this weekend , French author and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupery took_off on a World_War_II reconnaissance mission over the south of France and never came_back . In America he is remembered for &quot; The Little Prince , &quot; the classic fable of childhood . But in Europe , North Africa and South_America , where he pioneered air routes , he is revered as a great poet of flight . At the dawn of aviation , Saint-Exupery set_out to explore the planet ; he frequently lost his physical bearings but never his capacity for wonder . He combined courage and sensitivity , traits today ' s men are struggling to reconcile . Once , flying_blind across the Sahara at night , he navigated toward a mirage of Berber campfires , only to discover that they were stars rising above the horizon . He flew_on , navigating by constellations , until he encountered the &quot; bewildering fact that this Earth that is our home is yet in truth a wandering star. &quot; Flying in the 1935 Paris-to-Saigon race , he and his mechanic crashed in the Egyptian desert ; they trudged three days through burning sands before being rescued . Saint-Exupery defied typhoons in Tierra del Fuego and flew reconnaissance sorties during the Nazi invasion of France . A romantic , he loved metaphors and florid language , princes and stars ; today , we might say he was in touch with the child inside . Born into a noble family in 1900 , the young count endured boarding school by indulging fantasies of flying . In 1926 he was an aviator flying the mail across the Western Sahara from Casablanca to Dakar . His insights on these long , lonely flights found their way into his personal journals , scribbled in cafes and desert oases . He described the currents of air , the textures of terrain , the fingerprints left by nomads on nature . Carried aloft in primitive machines that frequently ran_out of gas , lost course or crashed , he was engaged in a quest of consciousness : to grasp , from high above , a pattern of meaning on Earth . The dawn of global awareness is often ascribed to the moment astronauts first beheld Earth shimmering in space . But Neil Armstrong ' s words from the moon , &quot; one small step for man . . . , &quot; pale in comparison to Saint-Exupery ' s 1939 rendering of a colleague ' s passage across the South Atlantic in a hydroplane : &quot; As day was dying he ran_afoul of the Black_Hole region , off Africa . . . . Great black waterspouts had reared themselves seemingly in the immobility of temple pillars . Swollen at their tips , they were supporting the squat and lowering arch of the tempest , but through the rifts in the arch there fell slabs of light and the full_moon sent her radiant beams between the pillars down upon the frozen tiles of the sea . Through these uninhabited ruins Mermoz made his way . . . flying for four hours through these corridors of moonlight toward the exit from the temple. &quot; Saint-Exupery held faith with technological progress , believing air_travel and air_mail would bring countries closer together . But the Nazi invasion of France caused him to despair that the beloved airplane , with all its potential for communication , had instead regressed to weapon of destruction . He flew reconnaissance missions but refused to pilot fighter_aircraft . He was nearly shot down in 1940 , an experience he converted into &quot; Flight to Arras. &quot; &quot; The Little Prince &quot; was written in a Victorian mansion deep in the woods of Long_Island . Saint-Exupery had gone there for a rest but he couldn ' t stand the isolation . Twice as old as the typical military flier , his body wracked by injuries , he returned to North Africa to help liberate France . &quot; If I ' m shot down , I won ' t regret anything , &quot; Saint-Exupery wrote before his final mission in an unmailed letter to a friend . His P-38 Lightning was presumed lost in the Mediterranean ; it remains a mystery whether he was shot down , crashed or , in growing despondency , committed suicide . Today , as we talk_of information highways and virtual_reality making_it possible to travel without leaving our TV screens , Saint-Exupery ' s writings are a guide back to the path of the explorer who risked his life searching for knowledge and truth . In the 50 years since his disappearance , Saint-Exupery ' s literary reputation has stayed aloft . &quot; The Little Prince &quot; has been republished in a special anniversary edition . His aviation books , &quot; Night Flight , &quot; &quot; Wind , Sand and Stars &quot; and &quot; Flight to Arras &quot; -- all still in print -- are guideposts to explore meaning in life ' s journey . Saint-Exupery was not only a pioneer of air routes ; he was one of the first in modern times to grasp a whole-Earth vision . Circling somewhere between oblivion and the stars , the poet of flight challenges us &quot; to set our course for distant destinations. &quot;</TEXT>
