BUT , LIKE MANY FAMILIES IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS , THE REILLEYS HAVE DIRECTED THEIR GRIEF AND ANGER INTO ACTIVISIM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> John and Genelle Reilley have been coping_with a living purgatory of grief , frustration and confusion for 8 1 / 2 years . Their grief is over the loss of their 23-year-old daughter , Robbin Brandley , who was stabbed and left to bleed to death on the campus of Saddleback College in Mission Viejo in 1986 . They are frustrated because whoever killed Robbin has escaped detection . Although the case is still being pursued by Orange County Sheriff ' s Department detectives , solid leads have become increasingly scarce as the years have passed . And , like many families of crime victims , the Reilleys are confused over why violence seems to be tolerated , even celebrated , by American society . They wonder why violent criminals are released from prison at all . Since the death of their daughter , the Laguna Beach couple have shared deeply in both the heartache and occasional ray of hope -- new evidence , an arrest -- experienced by other crime victim families . With the breakthrough last month in the Denise Huber case -- the body of the Orange County woman missing since 1991 was found in Arizona -- the Reilleys revived their hopes for a break_in their daughter ' s case . Although the two murders have many important differences , they have certain similarities . Both Brandley and Huber were returning home from nighttime concerts when they were last seen alive , and both were 23 years old . Both were white_women who lived_in southern Orange County . Huber had graduated from UC Irvine a year before she disappeared ; Brandley was a college_student . The Reilleys hope that prosecutors will ultimately be able to prove that one person committed both murders . &quot; That way , there weren ' t two maniacs out there ; there was just one , &quot; said Genelle Reilley , who had written a letter of commiseration to the Hubers after their daughter ' s disappearance . &quot; I ' m absolutely delighted that . . . the ( Huber ) family doesn ' t have to wonder anymore where their daughter is , if she ' s alive or dead. &quot; Orange County sheriff ' s spokesman Lt . Dan Martini said that when Denise Huber ' s body was found , a detective was sent to Arizona to investigate if John Famalaro , who has been charged in Huber ' s death , is linked to any other crimes . Martini said Famalaro has not been connected to any other case . There have been no breakthroughs in their daughter ' s case , but , the Reilleys point_out , there were none in the Huber case until Elaine Canalia of Phoenix , on a hunch , wrote_down the license_number of a moving van that she said &quot; just seemed out of place. &quot; Her tip to police led to the discovery of the body and the arrest of Famalaro . &quot; This Huber thing turned_on just that one woman , &quot; John Reilley said . &quot; Thank God that this woman put two and two together , gave_a_damn , told of her suspicion and then the police_officers followed it up . The clue didn ' t fall_through the cracks . &quot; Robbin ' s killer came_out of nowhere , killed her in a quick amount_of_time , with such passion , and then disappeared . It ' s hard to believe that he , or she , did not commit a similar type of crime. &quot; * Early on the morning of Jan . 19 , 1986 , the Reilleys were awakened at their home by sheriff ' s deputies who brought them the devastating news . The body of their daughter had been found in a dimly lighted parking_lot on the Saddleback campus , near the Doyle G . McKinney Theatre where she had been working as a student usher . There were multiple stab wounds to her upper body ; there was no sign of sexual_assault or robbery . Robbin was a communications and fine_arts student at Saddleback and a disc_jockey at the campus station , KSBR . She had planned to to pursue a degree in broadcasting at San Francisco State . On the night of her death , she had worked as an usher for a jazz performance and attended a small reception afterward . She was last seen about 10:30 p.m. as she left that event for home . It is the Reilleys ' hope that their daughter ' s attacker has boasted of the stabbing and that someone who has information will be attracted to the reward the Reilleys are offering . At $ 25 # 000 two years ago , the reward now stands at $ 50 # 000 . Anyone with information they believe is connected to the case should contact the sheriff ' s department . &quot; Murderers talk to each other about their crimes , and brag , &quot; Genelle Reilley said . &quot; I pray that someone will come forward. &quot; Martini said that after Brandley was killed , &quot; there were hundreds of leads and phone_calls that developed at the onset of the case . And , as is typical of human nature , ( the reward offering ) did generate more calls . We pass those leads around to detectives . Any new lead that comes_in , we follow. &quot; The Reilleys have spent nearly $ 50 # 000 on_their_own private investigation . In 1988 , they took the Sheriff ' s Department to court in an unsuccessful bid to gain access to the coroner ' s report and complete crime scene information . The Sheriff ' s Department argued that certain aspects of the case are known only to the murderer and that the investigation would be compromised if the reports were released . Two years ago , Genelle Reilley worked_up her courage to confront a woman she had suspected in the attack on her daughter and paid her to take a lie-detector test . It proved negative . * Earlier this month , Genelle Reilley and her son , Jayeson Brandley , joined hundreds of other crime victims and their families at a rally on the steps of the state Capitol . There , they listened as Gov . Pete Wilson asked legislators to support major bills in his anti-crime package . &quot; I met the governor the night before the rally and thanked him for what he ' s trying to do for us and for signing the ' three strikes ' law , &quot; Reilley said . &quot; But it should be only one strike . Why would we even think_of letting a murderer or a rapist or a child_molester out of jail ? Over 200 # 000 people have been murdered ( in the U.S. ) since Robbin ' s death . that ' s more_than Vietnam . We are living_in a war zone . America is a war zone. &quot; Two days after the rally , she drove to the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills for a fund-raising luncheon to benefit Crime Victims United , a support group that lobbies on behalf of victims ' rights . Blaming their daughter ' s death in part on what they say was lax security and inadequate lighting on college campuses generally , the Reilleys have actively lobbied for state legislation to increase illumination in parking_lots and campus walkways . They also backed legislation that has opened_up campus crime statistics to the public . &quot; Before we testified before the Legislature on lighting issues , we went_out and measured the light in different parts of colleges , &quot; John Reilley recalled . &quot; Students are out at 12 , 1 in the morning , walking_around , and we literally surprised each other as we came_across them . It is that dark. &quot; &quot; Students have told me that Saddleback is_well lit now , and that makes me feel good , &quot; Genelle Reilley says . &quot; But my daughter shouldn ' t have had to die for something like that to happen. &quot; * Mental-health experts say that taking activist roles in crime issues is an effective way for families of victims to deal with grief . &quot; Murder is such an outrageous way to lose a child . When families take their grief to an activist role , it ' s often an expression of the outrage of losing their child , &quot; says Carol Waxman , supervisor of homicide victim services for the Victim / Witness Assistance Program of Orange County . &quot; There ' s anger , but there ' s a deep commitment too among people who use the grief in an activist way . They want to take their anger and create some benefit . There is altruism there. &quot; The Reilleys contribute to several state and national crime victim groups that network and lobby for change , including Parents of Murdered Children , Memory of Victims Everywhere and Justice for Homicide Victims . A goal of the Reilleys is to make hand-held security devices available for students to own or rent for use on campus . They are trying to find a legislator to back their idea , which would involve two or three campuses serving as test sites . &quot; With these devices , even if there ' s one guard , he would know where you are when you pushed the button , &quot; John Reilley said . &quot; One model used at the University of Michigan sends_out a million-watt strobe light . If our daughter had had one of these on her key chain , she might be alive today. &quot; * A day does not go_by that Robbin is not in her family ' s thoughts . Genelle Reilley describes her life as &quot; one big why &quot; : &quot; Why did someone do this to my daughter , who never hurt anyone in her life , had no enemies ? Why don ' t schools care about the safety of their students ? Why do we release murderers and rapists from prison ? To see if they ' ll do_it again ? Why would n ' t we want bright lights in parking_lots ? &quot; The Reilleys say they are grateful for the support they ' ve received from family , friends and victims groups . &quot; We have wonderful family , &quot; Genelle Reilley says . &quot; A lot of people don ' t have that , and I don ' t know how they do it. &quot; Jayeson Brandley , 30 , says his sister ' s death will always be with him . &quot; Every day I think_about it , but it ' s becoming a little easier now that I ' ve decided to focus my energies on . . . having tougher penalties against violent felons , &quot; he said . &quot; It gives me a little bit of an outlet , but the grief is not something that will ever decrease. &quot;</TEXT>
