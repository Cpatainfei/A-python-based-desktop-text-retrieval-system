   <HEADLINE> REGRESSING : PLEASANT WAY TO PAST THE TIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The truth is , I don ' t know whether I actually got run_through by a Spanish sword on a Samoan beach at age 15 . It ' s quite possible that I never worked as a manservant on a naval vessel in the 1830s . And I may just have been fantasizing when I remembered being a Dutch aviator in 1935 . Whether any of these things really happened might never be known . This much I do know , however : &quot; Remembering &quot; them during a past-life regression therapy session recently felt strangely gratifying . And it provided enough conversational material to last several lifetimes . &quot; The jury is out for me as far as whether it ' s really reincarnation , &quot; Donna Kannard , my past-life regression hypnotherapist , said before introducing me to the misty nether world of my own subconscious . &quot; Probably won ' t know until I ' m dead . It may be just a metaphor ; I know it works as a therapeutic tool. &quot; Actually , it wasn ' t to deal with some pressing psychological problem that I decided to submit to the vagaries of hypnotherapy . Rather , it was for what Kannard described as a bit of &quot; recreational &quot; regression . The experience began with me sitting on a couch in her Santa Ana office . &quot; You are totally and completely relaxed , &quot; she told me in a gentle yet convincing voice . &quot; Oh , it feels so wonderful to release all that tension and care . . . . &quot; In fact , I ' d been hypnotized before . Years ago , I ' d dabbled extensively in what later came_to be known as the human potential movement . Among other things , I ' d experienced hypnosis and discovered that I made an excellent subject , as does almost any fool with a good imagination and weak will . So when Kannard suggested that we enter a tunnel , I was ready . &quot; We are going_to begin to move backward in time , &quot; she instructed , &quot; backward in time to one of your previous lifetimes . I want you to step into a tunnel to your own past . Create a vivid mental impression of a tunnel. &quot; There it was , a sort of brown and earthy pathway through a mountainside . As she counted backward from 15 to one , I felt myself slowly , inexorably , drawn into it as Indiana Jones is into quicksand ; if he knew what was good for him , he would n ' t be there in the first place . At the end of the tunnel , she told me , would be a past life . Suddenly it was there , that infernal island dotted with coconut_trees . &quot; I ' m on a beach , &quot; I told Kannard . &quot; I ' m about 15 . A bunch of men on boats are rowing ashore . They have swords. &quot; It didn ' t feel_like I was making_it up . It was as if the images were just popping into my head ; as if they were happening in a movie , coming from somewhere outside myself . The best way I can describe the experience is to say that it felt_like a dream , yet one happening while I was fully awake and able to provide an ongoing narrative . After that first life , the one in which the soldiers killed me on the beach , it was fairly easy to flit back and forth in time . Once , it seems , I had been a servant aboard a ship in the 1800s . My master was a handsome young naval_officer wearing a black uniform with plumes on its shoulders . Later I had visions of having been an astronomer living alone in a book-lined house in some quaint European town . And , finally , I got images of a pilot in the 1930s walking_around in baggy pants somewhere in Holland . That life sprang to mind complete with a touching picnic scene in which I said goodby to a sad-eyed girlfriend . There didn ' t seem to be any connecting theme to the images ; if there was some karmic message in all_of it , it went_over my head . Yet there did seem to be an odd sense of relief in the experience , a sort of unburdening as if the very act of &quot; remembering &quot; had a liberating effect . Therein , Kannard explained later , lies the therapeutic value of past-life regression ; its apparent ability to give rest to otherwise restless souls and , in some cases -- especially when directed at particular questions or issues -- provide insight into unresolved problems of the present . &quot; Most people feel better walking_out than walking in , &quot; she said of the 90-minute sessions , for which she charges $ 60 to $ 75 . Next time , I decided , I ' ll try to enter the fray with a specific issue in mind . Like why is it that I hate tuna so_much ? Or why do I have such a hard_time getting_up in the morning ? Or , most important , why oh why do I keep coming_up with such wacky self-deprecating ideas for stories ? Could it be that I am a former sadist working_out his karma from a past life by being masochistic ? Perhaps a one-time convict inflicting penance on himself ? If I go_back far enough , I figure , I ' ll probably discover some horrible truth . Like maybe I once was an editor .</TEXT>
