   <HEADLINE> CRIMEA VOTE SUNDAY COULD TRIGGER STRUGGLE FOR REGION ; EUROPE : CITIZENS TO BE ASKED IF THEY WANT MORE AUTONOMY FROM UKRAINE . IT COULD PUSH EFFORTS TO REJOIN RUSSIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Great_powers have tussled for control over the scenic , strategic Crimean peninsula ever since the Romans clashed with Greek city-states before the birth of Christ . The British , Russian and Turkish empires collided here in 1854 , and a century later Adolf Hitler tried to make Crimea a German Gibraltar . On Sunday , Crimea will hold a controversial vote that could launch a bid to secede from Ukraine and rejoin Russia . Some fear that the ensuing struggle could once again turn this Black_Sea peninsula into a geopolitical tinderbox . &quot; There is no cause for alarm ; everything will be peaceful , &quot; Crimea ' s newly elected president , Yuri A . Meshkov , promised this week . But the plebiscite has already triggered a war of words between Ukrainian authorities and Meshkov , who won 73 % of the vote_in January elections after promising to seek independence from Ukraine and reunification with Russia . Students of history shudder at the prospect of Russia and Ukraine , two increasingly nationalistic nuclear_powers already at_odds over how to divide the Black_Sea fleet , competing for hegemony over Crimea . Ukraine has increased its troop strength in Crimea from 18 # 000 about two years ago to 51 # 000 today , according to the Russian military newspaper Red Star . Meshkov has demanded the &quot; demilitarization &quot; of the peninsula , to no avail . Although no one expects armed strife soon , many see in Crimea the ingredients for another of the ethnic and political conflicts that have flamed_up across the former Soviet_Union . &quot; Border disputes are bloody : Abkhazia , Nagorno-Karabakh , the Trans-Dnestr , &quot; warned Olexander P . Kulyk , editor-in-chief of Crimea ' s only Ukrainian language newspaper , the Crimean Chamber , who sits near a window punctured with a bullet_hole left by an unknown ill-wisher . Server Kerimov , a leader of the Crimean Tatar movement , which believes that Crimea should remain an autonomous republic inside Ukraine , agreed : &quot; The danger of civil_war here exists. &quot; About 250 # 000 Tatars , deported from Crimea by Stalin in 1944 , have returned from exile in Siberia and Uzbekistan in the last five years . Most remain impoverished , unemployed and mistrustful of Russia . But the indigenous Tatars are badly outnumbered in a population of 2.7 million . Russians make_up 68 % of Crimean residents , Ukrainians 28 % . Well-to-do Russians have been summering in the Crimea since the czars built a dacha here in the 19th Century , and the peninsula remained the favorite vacation_spot of the Soviet elite . Whoever controls Crimea inherits not only a strategic military outpost in the Black_Sea but some of the best real_estate in the former Soviet_Union . Nikita S . Khrushchev , the former Soviet leader , gave Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 as a token of Russian-Ukrainian friendship , a meaningless gesture until the Soviet_Union dissolved . The drive for Crimean independence started as soon as Russian residents realized that they had become Ukrainian subjects . However dreadful the Russian economy , it looks positively rosy compared to that of Ukraine . Ukrainian inflation is running two to three times the Russian rate . Crimean production dropped 25 % in the last year , employment fell by 6 % , and living standards plunged for pensioners , who make_up about a third of the population . In his election campaign , Meshkov blamed Kiev for failing to conduct economic reform and promised to hold a referendum on Crimea ' s status . Ukrainian authorities , noting that Ukraine ' s existing borders are guaranteed by international_law and by a Ukrainian-Russian treaty , declared such a referendum illegal . Meshkov promptly announced that the voting would be an &quot; opinion poll , &quot; not a referendum . Voters will be asked to approve broader autonomy for Crimea , more presidential powers and dual Ukrainian-Russian citizenship for residents -- all steps toward de_facto Crimean independence . Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has urged Meshkov to back_down , warning him not to be &quot; too big for your boots. &quot; Undaunted , the Crimean Election_Commission announced Tuesday that the poll will proceed . Although the vote will not be legally binding , Meshkov is expected to win an overwhelming &quot; yes &quot; vote that will strengthen his bargaining position with Kiev as he seeks more autonomy for Crimea . Despite this show of brinkmanship , Meshkov is toning_down his secessionist rhetoric . &quot; There was never a question of reuniting with Russia , &quot; the 47-year-old lawyer said . What Crimea seeks , he said , is an &quot; economic union &quot; with Russia . What Meshkov -- who symbolically put his peninsula Thursday in the same time_zone as Moscow -- plans for Crimea sounds like Monaco on the Black_Sea : a free_trade zone , resort and tax haven that would attract foreign investors despite the obvious political risks . Also proposed is a free currency zone where the Ukrainian karbovanets , the Russian ruble and the U.S. dollar would all be accepted . Such proposals meet with skepticism from the Tatars , who say Meshkov is a Russian nationalist who has long been hostile to their drive for political equality , let alone compensation for their confiscated property . Tatars say they are forced to watch helplessly while houses they were dragged from at gunpoint are &quot; privatized. &quot; Meshkov &quot; combines primitive demagogy with ignorance and a large measure of chauvinism , &quot; said Mustafa Jemiloglu , chairman of the Assembly of the Crimean Tatar People . The group is boycotting Sunday ' s opinion poll . &quot; To solve Crimea ' s economic problems , there is no need either to declare Crimea independent or to rejoin Russia , &quot; Jemiloglu said . As if the politics of the opinion poll were not complicated enough , voters Sunday will also be asked to elect members of the Ukrainian Parliament . But separatist leaders are boycotting this contest , calling_on voters to take their Ukrainian ballots home so the 51 % voter_turnout required to validate the election will not be met . It is unclear whether Crimea will send any lawmakers to Kiev . Crimeans will also elect a 98-member local Parliament . Under a new quota system , 14 of the seats are reserved for Tatars , who had no representation in the old legislature , and four seats are designated for Armenians , Germans , Bulgarians and Greeks , who were also deported from Crimea . Among the leading contenders for the remaining seats is the Russian Party of the Crimea , which favors eventual reunification with Russia by peaceful means . The party is led by Sergei I . Shuvainikov , 39 , who has been endorsed by Russian ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky . Shuvainikov dreams of a great Slavic state that will one day unite Russia , Ukraine , Belarus and Crimea . But he calls himself a pacifist and warns that Meshkov ' s opinion poll will only increase tensions . Meanwhile , Crimeans such_as Yevdokia Gribasova will be voting not their passports but their pocketbooks . The 67-year-old Siberian-born retiree has an impressive-sounding monthly pension of 464 # 000 karbovanets . It ' s now worth about $ 12 . &quot; I got ill this winter , and I really would have liked to have eaten an orange , &quot; she said . &quot; But you know , I couldn ' t afford it. &quot; Gribasova is voting &quot; Da &quot; to Meshkov . &quot; I ' m not against Kiev , &quot; she said . &quot; I just want us to live better. &quot;</TEXT>
