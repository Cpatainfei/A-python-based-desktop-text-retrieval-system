   <HEADLINE> SOUR WELCOME FOR DRUG TO INCREASE MILK PRODUCTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the commercial use of a synthetic drug for cows called bovine somatotropin ( BST ) that will increase milk production ( &quot; Drug to Boost Milk Output Set for_Sale , &quot; Feb . 3 ) . Not only could this flood the market with surplus milk and force family farms_out of business , BST could increase udder infections by forcing a cow to produce more milk than it would naturally . Studies show that all drugs and hormones given to an animal end_up in milk and meat and are passed_on to the person consuming the product , left for the human digestive_system to deal with . It is hard to understand how the FDA can attack the vitamin industry , threaten to reclassify all amino_acids as prescription_drugs and seek to limit the potency of nutrients but approve a synthetic drug for factory farmers to use and pass_on for human ingestion . The FDA claims that its primary goal is truthful labeling . Hopefully , this goal applies to everything ( not just vitamins ) and products will indicate that they are derived from animals given these drugs , so the consumer has a choice whether to buy products with or without these drugs . Thankfully , there is a choice ! There are farmers who are using natural alternatives to growth_hormones , chemicals , pesticides , etc. , on food_products . GLENDA N . MADDOX Irvine * The USDA has stated that it is not absolutely sure what health effect BST would have_on humans . In conjunction with that uncertainty , there have been no regulations requiring the distributing companies that have not already refused to market the genetically derived milk to label their packages as so . I have no desire to participate in this health experiment by the USDA on the general population -- and yet , as a consumer , I have no ability to choose if the milk I drink comes from a cow injected with genetically engineered hormones or not . My choice , then , must be to boycott cow ' s milk altogether . SHELAH MORITA Anaheim</TEXT>
