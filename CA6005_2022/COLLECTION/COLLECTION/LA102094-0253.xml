   <TEXT> Steve Martin greets a visitor politely enough outside the Four Seasons Hotel dining_room before a scheduled 4 o ' clock tea -- but his voice is tinged with disappointment . You see , it ' s still 10 minutes to 4 , and Martin had planned to use those 10 minutes to finish the crossword_puzzle he carries clutched under one arm . Partly inked in with tidy black_letters , the puzzle does indeed appear to have a good 10 minutes worth of blank squares to go . But , once done , running_into someone ahead of schedule is difficult to undo . So Martin gamely heads for his window table to talk_about his new comedy , &quot; Picasso at the Lapin Agile , &quot; which opens at the Westwood Playhouse on Saturday . The one-act play creates a hypothetical meeting between Pablo Picasso and Albert Einstein in Paris , 1904 , shortly before Einstein published &quot; The Special_Theory_of_Relativity &quot; and Picasso painted &quot; Les Demoiselles D ' Avignon. &quot; But , before launching into heady discussions of this explosive fictional meeting , Martin has something else on his mind . He makes a habit of not watching his old movies and TV appearances ( &quot; strange and horrible &quot; ) , but happened to catch an old interview with himself on TV the night before and wondered how that dull , pedantic fellow on the screen could possibly be Steve Martin . &quot; I was ( studying ) quarks -- you know how , when you look_at them , they change ? &quot; Martin said , using the scientific term for the hypothetical building_blocks of subatomic_particles ( a word that rarely finds its way into casual conversation ) . &quot; I know I ' m exactly the same doing interviews . I know I just change . &quot; He paused . &quot; And then I looked_at myself and said , like , ' Maybe I am this deadly boring , serious person. ' &quot; He laughed , then turned somber again . Martin is hardly dead serious and boring . However , he exhibits none of the wild and crazy persona one might expect from a man who first came_to national prominence in the zany laboratory of &quot; Saturday Night Live. &quot; As Martin talks_about his most recent incarnation as a playwright , he seems professorial , intellectual , introspective and maybe just a little . . . quarky . If there are any laughs in a conversation with Martin , they are of the kind described in &quot; Lapin Agile &quot; as &quot; icebox laughs. &quot; Einstein : &quot; You don ' t laugh now , but an hour later you ' re at_home , standing at the icebox , and you laugh. &quot; Take tea at the Four Seasons , for example . Martin is presented with a dizzying array of options . &quot; Orange_pekoe . No . Lemon verbena ? Black_currant , that sounds cute . But is that caffeinated ? &quot; Martin ends_up with passion_fruit tea -- which has caffeine , but about half as much as the other flavors . Later , back at the icebox , the situation is reminiscent_of the coffee scene from Martin ' s &quot; L.A. Story , &quot; in which a table full of Westsiders , deep into the designer coffee religion , order such bizarre permutations as double half-caf espresso with a twist . Martin is buoyed today not just by the dose of half-caf , but by the fact that his play , to be performed here by the Chicago-based Steppenwolf Theatre Company , has enjoyed critical success in Chicago and Boston . He has also written another play , &quot; Wasp , &quot; a surreal comedy about a ' 50s family much like Martin ' s own , which has been performed twice -- at the Ensemble Studio Theatre and at Vassar -- and is slated to open in New York in the fall , at a yet-to-be named venue . He is happy to be bringing &quot; Lapin &quot; home to Los Angeles , and happy that critics , so far , have not adopted the stance that a Hollywood comedy star couldn ' t possibly write good theater . &quot; New York is a place ( where the critics ) would really kill me because I ' m in movies , so I ' m not really eager to take ( &quot; Lapin &quot; ) there , &quot; he says . &quot; But it ' s now ready to be done somewhere where there ' s a risk to me , and that ' s L.A. &quot; I ' ve already been reviewed 20 times with it , so I pretty much know what the critical position is , or can be . You are always vulnerable to someone ' s bad mood , or other vision . But at least it ' s not a horrible celebrity exercise. &quot; While he has no plans to give_up movies -- he stars in Nora Ephron ' s &quot; Mixed Nuts , &quot; a black comedy about a suicide hot_line slated to open in December -- right now Martin is happiest as a playwright . When he decided to try writing a play , in 1991 , Martin says , &quot; I was starting to get really interested in theater . It looked_like a real challenge . I thought , ' I wonder if I could do that , because if I could do that . . . &quot; I think you go_through your career trying to prove to yourself that you can do something . And even after you ' ve done_it , you ' re still trying to prove it . So I thought that would prove if I were a writer or not , if I could write a play. &quot; Martin says he was tempted to take a role in &quot; Lapin Agile &quot; but didn ' t want the play to transform into a one-man show . In &quot; Wasp , &quot; he says , there is a role for him , but thus far he hasn ' t been able to bring himself to play it because it hits a little too close to home . &quot; Lapin Agile , &quot; Martin said , was inspired by a Picasso painting , titled &quot; At the Lapin Agile , &quot; painted in about 1904 . Martin saw it in a book about Picasso . &quot; There was a photo of this painting kind of hanging there , unstretched , unframed on the wall -- Picasso just kind of did_it to decorate the place , &quot; Martin says . &quot; And that year , whenever it was , 1992 , the painting was hanging at the Metropolitan Museum , all stretched_out , with a $ 40 # 000 frame on it . &quot; And I knew it had recently sold for $ 1 million , and it just sent me back to those days when nothing had any ( monetary ) value and everything was just about ideas. &quot; Martin jokes that he ' s not afraid of going_over the heads of his audience because that group will be self-selecting . &quot; Going_against ( the play ) already is the title , &quot; he says cheerfully . &quot; People are already going : ' Picasso , what ' s this ? ' And then by the time you get_to lapin agile , people are going : ' I ' ll go see something else. ' &quot; He pauses . &quot; But there is no other title . I suppose I could Anglicize it , but then it would be ' Picasso at the Agile Rabbit. ' &quot; Martin ' s interest in Picasso stems from a longtime devotion to art ; he sits on the board at Los Angeles County Museum of Art , whose galleries he roller-skated through in &quot; L.A. Story. &quot; He has in some past interviews refused to discuss his art collecting , but says he ' s more_than willing to talk_about art . &quot; ( Collecting ) is what I don ' t want to talk_about -- that ' s just numbers and greed and values , &quot; he says . &quot; Especially in Hollywood. &quot; Martin , who started collecting in the mid- ' 70s before the activity became an ' 80s symbol of Hollywood chic , notes happily that the prestige collecting has slipped out of vogue in the entertainment_industry . About LACMA , recently troubled by financial and personnel problems , Martin says he has not been directly involved but notes that most of the Hollywood money has gone_to downtown ' s Museum of Contemporary Art . &quot; Everyone was interested in contemporary art , or ' modern , ' so-called , &quot; Martin says . &quot; I think LACMA is fantastic , beautiful . I mean , there are Rembrandts there . Rembrandts and Picassos and major collections of Indian art . . . . At LACMA , they have a great collection of American paintings from the 19th Century . that ' s rare , very few museums have that . They have German Expressionist stuff . In Los Angeles . &quot; * &quot; Picasso at the Lapin Agile , &quot; Saturday-Dec . 4 , Tues.-Fri. 8 p.m. Saturdays 5 and 9 p.m. , Sundays 3 and 7 p.m. , no performance Nov . 24 ( Thanksgiving ) with added Nov . 25 matinee at 2 p.m. Westwood Playhouse , 10886 Le Conte Ave. , Westwood .
