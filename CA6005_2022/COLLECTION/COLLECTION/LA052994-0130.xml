   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : ASIA ; VIETNAM , CHINA CRUISING BOOMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In Vietnamese ports , strings of exploding red and cerise paper-covered firecrackers greet cruise_ship arrivals , creating a din and leaving bright scraps like fallen bougainvillea petals on the pavement . The firecrackers are made from scrap paper that is dyed , then hand-wrapped around gunpowder salvaged from bombs and shells left over from the Vietnam_War . The ceremony , which appears to be appreciated by Vietnamese on-lookers , is a traditional greeting to chase_away bad spirits that could hamper the passengers ' journey . There should be a big run_on firecrackers this fall and winter -- if the booming Vietnamese cruise market is any indication . Thirteen ships marketed in North_America are setting sail for Vietnam between now and next April -- a major increase since travel restrictions on Americans visiting Vietnam were relaxed at the end of 1991 , and remaining economic sanctions lifted in February . So , for anyone eager to see the country before old-fashioned cam pho ( roadside noodle shops ) are supplanted by McDonald ' s , now is the time to go . The fact is , traveling_by cruise_ship through the Far East can be far more comfortable and convenient than overland . Most cruises calling_in Vietnam set_out from Hong Kong or Singapore , and range from Club Med ' s seven-day series to 14 days on Cunard ' s Crown Monarch . Cruises may call_at one or more of four major ports -- Haiphong , the port city for Hanoi ; Da Nang , the port for the ancient capital of Hue ; sultry Nha Trang , with its gently moldering French buildings , and , near the Mekong Delta , Ho Chi Minh City ( the former Saigon ) , where shiny new Hondas vie with pedal bikes and citizens wear sunglasses instead of Hanoi ' s conical straw coolie hats . Among upcoming Vietnam sailings : Pearl Cruises ' peripatetic Pearl , which sails year-round in the Far East , visits several Vietnamese ports this summer and fall , and Special Expeditions ' Caledonian Star will sail from Ho Chi Minh City to four other Vietnamese ports , then on to China on its June 13 cruise . Cunard Line is really high on Vietnam , with its flagship Queen Elizabeth 2 and Sagafjord both calling there on around-the-world cruises this winter ; its Sea Goddess II visiting in February and March , and the Cunard Crown Monarch offering two &quot; Asian Highlights &quot; cruises in March . The Royal Viking Sun returns for a second visit to overnight in Ho Chi Minh City and make a maiden call_at Da Nang during its 1995 world cruise , and Princess Cruises ' Golden Princess calls_at Ho Chi Minh City during its 105-day Grand Circle Pacific cruise leaving Vancouver September 22 . Seven Seas ' Song of Flower is set for Vietnam cruises in November and again next March , while Royal Cruise Line ' s Royal Odyssey calls_in Da Nang on January 2 and March 15 sailings . Seabourn Cruise Line ' s Seabourn Spirit sails to Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh City in February , March and April , and the new Marco Polo from Orient Lines calls during its June 18 and September 22 sailings . Traveling_by cruise_ship can also be the best way to visit Myanmar . The former Burma is back on the cruise schedule for the coming season after several years of political strife that reduced tourist visits severely . Three ships scheduled for Myanmar calls are Seven Seas ' Song of Flower , Pearl Cruises ' Pearl and the Royal Viking Sun . After a_few years in the_doldrums , China too has bounced_back into the cruise mainstream with a flurry of super-luxury sailings coming_up , including the entry of Seabourn Cruise Line into China next March . Those once-spartan overland expeditions with primitive , hole-in-the-floor toilets and grimy restaurants have given_way to more cosseted outings as the country ' s tourism infrastructure adds marble-lobbied hotels in the cities and more sanitary wayside stops in the countryside . The Seabourn Spirit is offering an optional overland visit to see the terra_cotta warriors of Xi ' an in conjunction with two March sailings from Hong Kong . Cunard ' s lavish Sea Goddess II also sets_out from Hong Kong March 9 for a cruise along the Yangtse with calls_at several ports , including Fuzhou , a tea port city that was once the center for Christianity in China . Song of Flower from San Francisco-based Seven Seas is offering a March 10 &quot; China Discovery &quot; sailing that calls_at the Special Economic Zone of Shantou on the mainland as well as Taiwan ' s capital of Taipei , and the Oceanic Grace strays from its usual Japanese ports_of_call to visit China in September . Orient Lines ' Marco Polo is beginning its first season in China with 16-day land / cruise packages from Beijing ' s port of Dalian to Hong Kong June 18 and Sept . 22 . Royal Cruise Line ' s Royal Odyssey will also embark_on a series of new China itineraries in early 1995 . Several new_lines will be offering Yangtse cruises , including four new 154-passenger cruisers named Victoria I-IV from New York-based Victoria Cruises , three new German-built river cruisers from Regal China Cruises and Abercrombie &amp; Kent , and the new China Glory from AHI International . All are brand-new Western-built ships that promise a higher level of luxury than previous Yangtse vessels . The Victoria sailings begin June 6 , while the AHI itineraries are set for September and October . The A &amp; K cruises are already in place .</TEXT>
