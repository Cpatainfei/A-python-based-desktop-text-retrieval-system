   <HEADLINE> WAR DIARY RETURNED TO FAMILY IN JAPAN ; JOURNAL : WOODLAND HILLS MAN PRESENTS THE 50-YEAR-OLD MEMENTO TO RELATIVES OF ITS AUTHOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a brief ceremony Wednesday in an isolated town in northern Japan , a San Fernando Valley man returned a 50-year-old diary , which his uncle treasured as a war souvenir , to the family of the Japanese sailor who wrote it . * Mark Elsbernd , 38 , a Woodland Hills manufacturing engineer for a Japanese-owned company , presented the diary to Hiroshi Nemoto , a 70-year-old nephew of Kazumi Nemoto , who died in the Philippines during World_War_II . Since 1945 , the leather-bound volume had been tucked_away by Elsbernd ' s uncle , Albert Elsbernd of Cincinnati , until the elder Elsbernd decided that it should be returned to its rightful owners . &quot; It was an emotional day , &quot; Mark Elsbernd said , following a three-hour meeting that included a tour of the village of Samekawa , about 200 miles north of Tokyo , and of the village ' s war memorial to its dead sons . &quot; I couldn ' t believe the warm feelings I got from the family . And I thought to myself ' It ' s over . The diary is finally back in the place it belongs. ' This world really is a pretty small place. &quot; The diary was found in a desk in a shellfire-pocked building in the Philippines in 1945 and brought_back by a U.S. soldier who gave it as a war memento to his girlfriend ' s little_brother -- Albert Elsbernd , then 14 . Now 64 and retired from the Cincinnati Police_Department , Albert Elsbernd recently decided that the diary , which he never managed to translate , should be returned to the author or his family . For help he contacted his nephew Mark , an engineer for Dataproducts Corp. , owned by the Hitachi corporation of Japan . Mark Elsbernd contacted company executives in Japan , who took a special_interest in the project and launched a search for members of Nemoto ' s family who could claim the diary . Kazumi Nemoto , a Japanese naval aircraft technician who would have been 70 this year , kept the diary for several months in 1945 -- logging not only personal data , but precise accounts of military movements and various aircraft records . The diary also included passages describing a malarial outbreak that killed many Japanese troops -- perhaps killing Nemoto as well . Its final entry was not long before Nemoto ' s death on April 24 , 1945 , at the age of 21 , according to Japanese military records . The search for Nemoto ' s family was taken_up by a high-ranking Hitachi executive , Hiroshi Gonmori , now 70 -- who as luck would have it also served in naval aviation in the Philippines . Gonmori initiated a search of military records and contacted the Japanese press . Nemoto ' s nephew Hiroshi saw a Nov . 10 story in a Japanese newspaper and called the paper to identify himself . Nemoto , the youngest of seven children , is a municipal official in Samekawa who had long given_up hope of collecting any more mementos of his dead uncle . Mark Elsbernd agreed to return the diary on his next business trip to Japan . Elsbernd said he could feel his heart beating Wednesday when he finally came face-to-face with Nemoto . &quot; He bowed to me , and I bowed back , &quot; he said . &quot; Then we shook hands . I smiled . He smiled . Then I gave him the book . I told him . ' Sir , this diary belongs with you , not us. ' &quot; Nemoto then offered a tour of the village , including the burial_ground that includes a monument to the Japanese soldiers from Samekawa . &quot; After the day was over , &quot; Elsbernd recalled , &quot; I felt_like I knew the man. &quot; Added Katsuhide Kato , a Hitachi executive present at the ceremony : &quot; This day is part of the history of World_War_II . A final chapter . Many people died in that war . But this was a happy day. &quot;</TEXT>
