   <HEADLINE> $ 1 BILLION IN INTERIM WITHDRAWALS APPROVED ; COURT : BANKRUPTCY JUDGE PERMITS ACCESS OF 30 % OF WHAT AN INVESTOR HAD IN FUND . IT SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR CITIES AND AGENCIES TO COVER BILLS AND PAYROLLS THROUGH THE END OF JANUARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John E . Ryan approved an interim plan Thursday that will give Orange County and more_than 180 cities and districts access to $ 1 billion from the county ' s bankrupt investment pool to pay emergency bills and payrolls through Jan . 31 . The plan , which should help cities and other pool investors stave_off potentially disastrous shortfalls , limits investors to 30 % of their individual investments in the county fund . It also puts an overall cap of $ 1 billion on fund withdrawals . Ryan called the plan fair : &quot; It is not based on fears about what might happen . It ' s based on hopes about trying to resolve this terrible situation. &quot; Through its attorneys , the county promised that it would abide_by the same rules governing other investors when it requests emergency funds over the next 30 days . Attorney Bruce Bennett said the county will probably ask_for far less than the $ 300 million it would be entitled to demand under the newly approved plan . It was unknown how much other cash-strapped municipalities and government_agencies would demand . Few of the more_than 100 attorneys in court objected to the agreement , which also requires that emergency disbursement requests be reviewed by a creditors committee , a second committee representing pool investors , and the county . Ryan said that municipalities could begin filling_out the two-page emergency withdrawal request forms on Thursday afternoon , and that cash could begin flowing within days . He said he will be available next Thursday to rule on disputes . But that quick pace is barely fast enough for some cash-strapped cities . Montebello in Los Angeles County , for example , said it must withdraw $ 14 million , or all_of its 30 % allotment , to make a partial payment on a debt that ' s due Dec . 30 . Absent the $ 14 million , Montebello ' s creditors are unlikely to roll the debt over , and &quot; if the city defaults ( it ) faces the same problem that ( Orange County ) faces now , &quot; said Montebello ' s attorney , John Lapinski . But Lapinski said the new procedure at least gives the city a chance to make some payment . &quot; I ' m cautiously optimistic that things will work_out , &quot; he said . Bennett also made several important disclosures during the hearing for cities and districts that rely_upon the county to collect and disburse their share of property_taxes . Some of the property_tax payments that Orange County collected before the county declared bankruptcy Dec . 6 were pumped into the troubled investment fund , he said . Bennett didn ' t give a dollar figure for the tax monies now entangled in the complicated bankruptcy proceeding . But Bennett balanced that dose of bad news by saying that today the county will start disbursing to the cities property_taxes that were collected after the bankruptcy filing . Bennett did not say whether the county ' s fiscal woes would result in smaller checks being mailed . Not all attorneys agreed with the plan Ryan approved . In an apparent split that could grow between the county and other investors , several attorneys raised questions about who should be forced to bear the brunt of the $ 2-billion loss suffered by the county ' s troubled bond fund . The arguments provided a glimpse into the complex legal question of what role the county played in the fund ' s losses . Attorneys for two community_colleges and a city objected to the plan because it did not more strictly limit the county ' s ability to make withdrawals . Huntington Beach City Atty . Gail C . Hutton argued that the county should not be allowed to withdraw any funds until it guarantees that all other investors will be reimbursed 100 % . Hutton said her &quot; fiscally responsible &quot; city should be given_back its entire $ 43-million bond pool investment , because the county violated its role as a &quot; trustee &quot; by speculating with investors ' money . She said the county had no authority to impound the funds . Hutton threatened to take the_matter to Superior_Court if the county will not agree to the city ' s terms . &quot; The monies in the pool fund are sacrosanct , &quot; Hutton told Ryan . &quot; We are not unmindful of the county ' s dire straits , but unless the county can guarantee it will protect our interests , the city cannot agree to the county ' s invasion of the city ' s money. &quot; County bankruptcy attorney Bennett responded by arguing that under at least one scenario for resolving rival claims to the fund , the county could win the entire contents of the pool . Bennett said it could be argued that the county merely placed funds for other investors and that &quot; no valid or enforceable trust ( agreement ) existed or survived &quot; between the county and other investors in the fund . That argument would lead to the conclusion that the county &quot; is entitled to the entire ( remaining ) contents of the fund , &quot; Bennett said . Bennett also laid_out several other possible scenarios . At the other extreme , he said , is Hutton ' s argument that the county acted_as trustee for the other agencies and that , as a &quot; failed trustee , &quot; the county ' s claims should be relegated to the bottom of the pile . A third possibility would be to pro-rate the loss equally between the county and the other agencies that invested in the pool , or according to a more complicated formula , he said . Bennett stressed that the county has taken no stand on how the loss should be absorbed , and that other attorneys probably could come_up with other possible outcomes for the tough legal question of how to apportion the $ 2-billion loss among the fund ' s investors . Bennett did suggest that pool participants attempt a negotiated solution . The other option : &quot; Build a courtroom with roughly 200 attorneys ' tables and take no money out of the pool for several years. &quot; But given the first possible scenario in which the county could win all_of the funds , Bennett argued that the county is being generous in allowing other investors to take any money out of the pool . Both the county and the Official Investment Pools Participants Committee , which represents investors , will meet over the next two weeks to come_up with a proposal about how to handle the remaining funds in the pool , committee attorney Patrick Shea said . Ryan said that it is essential for all parties to try to work together to resolve disputes short of litigation . &quot; We have an emergency and the question is how to deal with that emergency , &quot; Ryan said . &quot; If we do_it with litigation . . . that reminds me of Nero with a fiddle. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Targeted for Seizure Here is what search_warrants used by the Orange County district_attorney ' s office specified that investigators should look_for in trying to determine whether any felonies have been committed in the county ' s fiscal crisis : * Documents offering or describing investment of any local agency in the Orange County investment pool from 1989 to the present , including prospectuses , newspapers , letters and other documents . * Notes , contracts and other documents showing participation of any local agency in the pool . * Letters and other memoranda describing the status of local agencies or individuals in the pool . * Statements of accounts , transactions and balances . * Checks and wire transfers of local agency funds to the pool . * Letters and other correspondence notifying local agencies of any trouble or potential risk with the pool . * Correspondence reassuring local agencies or any employees or officials of the safety of the investment . * Correspondence describing how the county intends to extricate itself from problems . * Documents showing any trades of the county in the name of investors . * Lists of brokers and lenders used by the county from 1989 to the present . * Calendars of former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L .
