   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; POSTCARD FROM THE INTERNET ; SPELUNKING THE INTERNET ? BRING LYNX ALONG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' re looking_for the University of Minnesota ' s famous peanut noodle recipe or want to browse an on-line dictionary of computing or desperately need information about California lighthouses , you can sit_down at your computer , issue an arcane series of commands and eventually find this data on the Internet . Or you can use the Lynx program to plug into the World Wide Web ( WWW ) , a library of data stored on the Net and arranged according to the conventions of hypertext.Hypertext lets you jump from a highlighted word or sentence to other relevant information , thus making_it easier to find what you ' re looking_for . To use Lynx , you ' ll need to dial into the Internet using a communications program capable of VT-100 terminal emulation , since Lynx assumes you ' re using that kind of terminal . Then simply type &quot; lynx &quot; at the prompt . Lynx will take you to its opening page and present a menu of exotic islands of Net resources to explore . When traversing the WWW , the arrows on your key pad take_on a special significance : The left and right arrows move you between levels of content ( from the general to the very specific ) , while the up and down arrows move you between topics ( recipes , books or software , for example ) . As you spelunk the deepest recesses of the Net with Lynx , you can place bookmarks in places you want to return to by typing &quot; a &quot; , and you can view these bookmarks later by typing &quot; v &quot; . To get help while using Lynx , type &quot; ? &quot; . If the service you use to access Internet doesn ' t have Lynx , you can ask your provider to obtain a free copy of Lynx via anonymous_ftp from ftp2.cc.ukans.edu in the / pub / lynx directory .
