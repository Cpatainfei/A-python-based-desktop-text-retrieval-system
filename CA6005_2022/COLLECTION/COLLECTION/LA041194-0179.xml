   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A : O.C. CASE SPURS NEW SAFEGUARDS ; U.S. ACTS TO PROTECT INVESTORS AFTER WYMER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The case of Steven D . Wymer , the Newport Beach investment_adviser who pleaded guilty in 1992 to charges that he bilked clients of more_than $ 200 million , sent a shock_wave through the financial community . It was also one of the factors that led to an extensive review of how the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulates investments . In March , SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt cited the Wymer case when he announced new rules that , among other things , prohibit investment_advisers from making decisions about client accounts unless the client receives periodic account_statements directly from an independent custodian . Elaine Cacheris , regional director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and former chief of the regulator ' s West Coast enforcement division , answered questions last week about new provisions of the Investment_Advisors Act Rule , formulated to protect large and small investors . Cacheris , 38 , directs an office that covers California , Arizona , Nevada , Oregon , Washington , Hawaii , Alaska , Idaho and Montana . She headed the SEC investigation of Wymer , who is serving 14 years in federal prison and last week began paying restitution to his former clients . * Q . You described the case against Steven Wymer as one of the &quot; most significant and financially devastating cases of securities fraud ever perpetrated. &quot; Why didn ' t the SEC rules_in effect at the time protect the investors ? A . Several factors contributed to Wymer ' s ability to perpetrate the fraud on his clients and to disguise the amount_of_money that was missing . First , he maintained two sets of books and records . Wymer spent a great_deal of time creating fictitious trade confirmations and customer account_statements that were virtually indistinguishable from genuine documents . It also appears that he may have been assisted by others , including account_executives at the brokerage that held the defrauded investors ' accounts . Our investigation into this is continuing . Third , Wymer was also able to convince the defrauded investors that receipt of trade confirmations and account_statements was unnecessary . He provided sometimes genuine and sometimes forged letters from his clients to the brokerage , authorizing it to send account_statements and confirmations to Wymer alone , bypassing the investors , so they never saw the real status of their accounts . * Q . How have the rules changed since then ? What is the major new safeguard ? A The new rule . . . is specifically designed to prevent a Wymer-type situation by prohibiting investment_advisers from trading discretionary accounts unless the holder of the securities has agreed to send -- and does send -- account_statements to the clients on at least a quarterly basis . By requiring the custodian to send account_statements directly to each client at least every quarter , the rule will make_it less likely that the adviser can gain unauthorized access to client accounts without being detected . * Q . Why weren ' t changes made sooner ? A Although the number of investment_advisers has expanded greatly and we have recognized the need for additional examiners to conduct periodic inspections , there are many existing investor protections . By and large , the industry is relatively safe . The proposed rule will complement the existing regulatory protections by adding a provision designed specifically to address the type of fraud perpetrated by Wymer . * Q . Was the Wymer case a phenomenon of the ' 80s ? A It was definitely an era of higher interest_rates and high earnings . When Wymer offered a better-than-market rate of return supposedly using a sophisticated trading strategy , clients may have found it easy to believe him . It ' s important to realize , however , that in any era there will be individuals who are bent_on committing fraud . * Q . Could the same thing happen now ? A The new rule would make_it substantially more difficult to carry_out such a scheme , although investors must be diligent in learning all they can about their money manager and how their funds are invested . * Q . Are new kinds of scams being perpetrated on investors today ? If so , how do they work ? A . As long as greed and deceit are human characteristics , there will be investment frauds . The particular types of cases we ' ve seen in Southern California of late are wireless cable offerings and prime bank investment schemes . Recently , the commission issued an alert to investors advising of the escalation of fraudulent_schemes involving &quot; prime &quot; bank financial instruments . Typically , these instruments are in the form of notes , debentures , letters_of_credit or guarantees . Generally , there is a promise or guarantee of unrealistic rates of return . The purported association with prime financial_institutions itself serves as an inducement to the unwary investor . In addition , the transaction is described in highly complex terms that make_it extremely difficult for the investor to analyze . * Q . What tips would you give to small investors looking_for a safe place to put their money ? A . Ask a lot of questions before you invest . Ask directly about fees , commissions and all compensation to be received by your broker or financial adviser . Never invest merely on the basis of a phone_call . Take your time to understand the investment . And never invest in anything you don ' t completely understand . * Q . What other sorts of questions should people ask when they are considering an investment ? A . Just last month the SEC joined a group of securities regulators in launching a public awareness campaign to help investors better understand how to invest in_stocks , bonds and other securities . Together they issued a brochure , &quot; Invest Wisely , &quot; which provides basic information to help investors select a brokerage_firm and salesperson , identify decisions to be made before making an initial investment decision and address a problem that may arise . The brochure also helps investors identify questions they should ask , provides background information about the securities industry and describes practices that may signal problems . A copy of the brochure may be obtained at no charge from the SEC or from the other co-sponsoring regulators . * Q . How would you pick an investment_adviser ? A . For probably a majority of small investors , it may make some sense to find a &quot; fee-only &quot; financial planner who will recommend allocating the family ' s resources among a variety of investment types based on the family ' s means and financial goals . These advisers are called &quot; fee-only &quot; because they receive compensation based only on the time spent reviewing your financial situation and recommending investments . These advisers do not receive commissions on the sale of any particular products , so their advice is presumably the most objective . They may recommend placing some assets into a portfolio of no-load mutual_funds , for example . Then the investment strategy and allocations should be reviewed on a periodic basis as the markets and family circumstances evolve . Many advisers are also registered representatives with a brokerage_firm . They may_not charge separately for their financial advice but will receive a commission based on the recommended products that you purchase . Advisers who manage client money on a discretionary continuous basis generally have a minimum account size , such_as $ 100 # 000 . They will charge an annual fee -- from 1 % to 3 % , for example -- for assets under management . * Q . Do you think further protections for investors are necessary ? A . With that goal in mind , the chairman of our agency recently announced the creation of a Consumer Affairs Advisory Committee to assist us in resolving investor problems and being more responsive to their needs . The committee will explore broad , fundamental issues of concern to investors , including matters currently under_consideration by the SEC and topics of emerging concern to investors and the financial services_industry . Selecting an Investment_Adviser The Securities and Exchange Commission recommends taking these steps before you pick a financial consultant : Get referrals : Ask your accountant , attorney or trusted friends with experience in this area . Do a background check : Once you are considering a possible adviser : * Call the Securities and Exchange Commission , ( 202 ) 942-7040 , to find_out if the person is registered . * Call the North_American Securities Administrators , ( 800 ) 289-9999 , or the state securities agency in your area to find_out if the person has a disciplinary history or if past arbitration awards have been made . * When you interview the adviser , go armed with lots of questions . Ask all_of them , and make_sure you get answers you fully understand . Also ask to see the adviser ' s FORM ADV , which is information provided to the SEC when an adviser registers . Before investing : When considering an investment , do not sign the new account agreement unless you thoroughly understand it and agree with the terms and conditions . Do not rely_on verbal representations not contained in the written agreement . QUESTIONS TO ASK * Who will control decision-making for your account ? You are responsible_for all investment decisions involving your account unless you provide your broker with discretionary authority , which allows investment decisions to be made without consulting you first . Do not grant discretionary authority without considering the potential pitfalls , which include poor judgment or outright fraud on the part of the broker . * How will you pay_for your investment ? Most investors maintain a cash_account requiring full payment for each security purchase . An alternative is a margin_account , which allows you to borrow money from the brokerage to buy securities . You will be charged interest on the amount borrowed and will be asked to sign an agreement disclosing interest terms . The brokerage has authority to sell any security in your account , without notice to you , to cover any shortfall resulting from a decline in the value of your securities . If the value of your account is less than the amount of the outstanding loan -- even if the cause is a one-day market drop -- you are liable for the balance . * How much risk should you assume ? That depends_on your investment goals . Understand the distinctions among &quot; income , &quot; &quot; growth &quot; and &quot; aggressive growth. &quot; Each indicates a different risk level , with income considered safest and aggressive growth the most risky . When opening a new account , you will be asked to specify your investment goals . Be sure that the investment products offered reflect your risk category .
