   <HEADLINE> SOUTH_KOREA EAGER TO OPEN BUSINESS WITH THE NORTH ; ASIA : ENTHUSIASM SWEEPS THROUGH COMMUNITY AFTER A WASHINGTON-PYONGYANG AGREEMENT EASED TENSIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There may well be no stranger place on earth to try to do business than North_Korea , ruled by the world ' s last surviving Stalinist regime . While other Communist governments have collapsed or embraced a significant degree of market economics , the hard-line rulers in Pyongyang still exert rigid control over social and economic life . Few foreigners are allowed_in , and they are closely monitored . Nevertheless , enthusiasm for doing business with the north is sweeping through South_Korea ' s business_community in the wake of a Washington-Pyongyang agreement last month that eased tensions over the north ' s apparent efforts to build nuclear bombs . Under the agreement , North_Korea is to give_up its ability to produce plutonium in return for economic aid and diplomatic links with Washington . Even members of the American Chamber_of_Commerce in Seoul have begun thinking seriously about opportunities in the north , despite U.S. laws that currently bar Americans from business dealings there . * &quot; There ' s a wave of enthusiasm running_through our chamber , &quot; said James H . Riddle , chamber president . &quot; That . . . is local management . When you get_back to headquarters in Chicago ( they may say ) : ' Huh , what ? North_Korea ? Are you kidding me ? Get this kid outta here . He ' s mad . Better transfer him out of Seoul . He ' s been there too long. ' &quot; The obstacles to significant levels of South_Korean investment in the north remain huge , and barriers are even greater for U.S. business . But there is also a powerful economic logic to expanded ties between the prosperous south , with its 44 million people , and the much poorer north , with a population of 22 million . And uniting South_Korea -- already the world ' s 12th-largest economy with a 1993 gross_domestic_product of $ 329 billion -- with the north could create a new East Asian powerhouse . Cooperation would benefit both sides , said Park Soon Seo , general_manager for planning at Ssangyong Corp . &quot; We have capital and some technology to provide to them , and they still have enough available land for factories , and manpower . Once we unite . . . we will have a powerful synergy effect. &quot; During a brief period of Korean detente in 1991 and 1992 , the two sides pledged to open direct trade and investment , and some South_Koreans visited the north . But Seoul banned such visits last year when tensions erupted over Pyongyang ' s nuclear program . South_Korean President Kim Young Sam lifted the ban after last month ' s Washington-Pyongyang accord , saying it was time for the two Koreas to cooperate &quot; to establish an economic community. &quot; Pyongyang ' s first response was a nasty propaganda snarl . &quot; The proposal of the traitor was . . . a camouflage for concealing the dark designs of the puppets for national division and total confrontation , &quot; the north ' s official Korean Central News_Agency declared . But southerners dismissed this as typical Pyongyang rhetoric . * A Samsung Corp . official , who spoke on condition he not be identified by name , said the company has kept_in touch with Pyongyang developments through a &quot; messenger &quot; of Korean ethnicity but foreign citizenship , who visits the north every month . Samsung recently received an invitation to send a high-level company delegation to the north before the end of this year , and plans to do so , the Samsung official said . Few in Seoul believe that the north can maintain the rigidity of its system for more_than a_few more years . Battered by a cut-off in Russian aid , the north ' s economy -- 15 times smaller than the south ' s economy -- has been shrinking for four years . Many here think that the government of Kim Jong Il , son and designated successor to the late President Kim Il Sung , can avoid collapse only by embracing Chinese-style economic reforms that would open_up the country . &quot; The north will be a favorite hunting_ground for South_Korean chaebols ( huge business conglomerates ) , and American companies will be playing follower , &quot; Riddle predicted . A senior U.S. official who visited Seoul this month with Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said that an eventual easing of restrictions on U.S. economic ties with North_Korea &quot; is part of the general goal &quot; of the recent Washington-Pyongyang agreement . &quot; But there ' s no set game_plan , &quot; added the official . South_Korean firms already conduct indirect trade with the north , worth $ 232 million in the first eight months of this year , up from $ 25 million in 1990 . Financial arrangements are handled through intermediaries in third countries . Ships must fly third-country flags , but after sailing from South_Korean ports into international waters , they head directly to North_Korea . * &quot; We supply some raw_materials to North_Korea , and we let them make things , and we buy_it back again and sell to other countries , &quot; he explained . &quot; We found that the quality made by North_Korea was acceptable . The labor cost is cheaper than in South_Korea , and we are using the same language , and geographically we have no problem at all for transportation. &quot; Yet Ssangyong ' s partners remain mysterious to the southern firm . &quot; We call it ' blind business , ' &quot; Park said . &quot; We don ' t know who makes our products for us . . . . If one day the middleman disappears , then the business disappears. &quot; While South_Koreans are interested in the relatively developed Pyongyang area -- only 120 miles northwest of Seoul -- North_Korea ' s main interest is in attracting investment to a special economic zone now under construction near its northeastern border with China and Russia . This area includes the small cities of Najin and Sonbong but lacks the electric_power , telecommunications , transport and other infrastructure needed for modern business_activities . It has only two main attractions : its remoteness from North_Korea ' s population centers and its proximity to China and Russia . The idea of attracting foreign investment to a lonely corner of the world ' s most isolated nation may seem absurd . Yet business people and analysts in South_Korea take the Najin-Sonbong zone quite seriously because they believe that North_Korea is desperate for development and while imposing restrictions , will make the areas attractive to foreign investors . North_Korea &quot; will set_up these special economic zones one by one , &quot; Yoo Jung Ho , a Korea Development Institute scholar , predicted . &quot; They ' ll try to get foreign currency and some economic development . But they ' ll try to maintain the politics and the society and all_the rest as usual in the rest of the country. &quot; Under this scenario , Yoo acknowledged , South_Korean and other foreign investment may help prolong the dictatorship by throwing it an economic lifeline . On the other hand , fear of the disruption in the south should the North_Korean government suddenly collapse is a factor encouraging big corporations to consider investing in the north . * Ssangyong hopes to expand from its current trade_in shoes and jackets to joint-venture manufacturing and fishing , Park said . But major progress will take time , Park said . &quot; I ' m living maybe 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) from North_Korea , &quot; he said . &quot; Geographically , it ' s very close , but it ' s very far away in reality . As businessmen , we still think it ' s not a logical place to invest a big amount_of_money , but as a big company , we can take a risk with a small amount_of_money . The South_Korean government is ready . Now the ball is in the North_Korean court . We have to wait to see how they respond. &quot;</TEXT>
