   <HEADLINE> 1994 : THE YEAR IN REVIEW ; WHO WAS BEST IN 1994 ? JUST ASK OUR CRITICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Our pop critics ' favorite albums of the year run from Jann Browne ' s &quot; Count Me In , &quot; Johnny Cash ' s &quot; American Recordings &quot; and Neil Young and Crazy Horse ' s &quot; Sleeps With Angels , &quot; which all tied for the most votes , to relatively obscure releases by country singer Bob Woodruff and Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango . Favorite concerts , meanwhile , included Buck Owens at the Crazy Horse , Love at the Coach_House and the Offspring and the Pretenders at Irvine Meadows . Mike Boehm : Favorite Albums In order of preference : 1 . Jann Browne , &quot; Count Me In &quot; ( Red Moon -- Swiss import ) : a shining link in the Southern California country-rock tradition that goes_back to the Byrds , the Flying Burrito Brothers , Poco and Emmylou Harris . Cohesive , sumptuously melodic , emotionally vivid and insightful and , we hope , available domestically in 1995 . 2 . R.E.M. , &quot; Monster &quot; ( Warner Bros. ) : Back to their garage-rock sources they went . But in toughening up their sound , the captains of the alternative movement didn ' t forget to be soulful . 3 . Liquor Giants , &quot; Here &quot; ( ESD ) : Pontiac Brothers alum Ward Dotson fully assimilated his Beatles / Kinks influences , maintained his Replacements-style plucky-loser viewpoint and served_up a pure-pop masterpiece . 4 . Johnny Cash , &quot; American Recordings &quot; ( American ) : Death and damnation , guilt and redemption are the main subject_matter . But it ' s the sheer , stark presence of the man in black that dominates . A solo-acoustic Cash album was thought to be a daring move , but in retrospect , nobody is more qualified . 5 . Elvis Costello , &quot; Brutal Youth &quot; ( Warner Bros. ) : Many Costello fans think he slipped with this one , but I find it one of the most delightfully catchy and inventively played albums of his career . 6 . Pavement , &quot; Crooked Rain , Crooked Rain &quot; ( Matador ) : The band from Stockton ' s wisecracking , crusty stance belies the poignancy of its position as rock latecomers who can ' t invent the music afresh , but only can take a noisy ax to the legacy their heroes have handed_down . 7 . Various artists , &quot; Songs From Chippy &quot; ( Hollywood ) : A posse of Texas songwriting luminaries led by Joe Ely and Butch Hancock crafted an evocative , timeless and mysterious folk-country song cycle based on the diaries of a prostitute in the Dust_Bowl days . 8 . Hole , &quot; Live Through This &quot; ( DGC ) : One of rock ' s most famous widows has a good ear , a grabbing voice , and high-voltage emotional intensity , and she conveys them all with garage band simplicity . 9 . Neil Young and Crazy Horse , &quot; Sleeps With Angels &quot; ( Reprise ) : It ' s kind of the same ol ' thing from ol ' Neil , but it ' s up_to the high standards of the artistic hot streak he ' s been_on for the last five years . ( Could be time for another recharging left turn , though , the kind he used to take_back in the ' 80s. ) 10 . Gil Scott-Heron , &quot; Spirits &quot; ( TVT ) : a strong comeback for the jazz-R &amp; B songwriter , notable for the warm , openhearted stance he maintains while struggling with inner torments . Honorable_mentions : Iris DeMent , &quot; My Life &quot; ( Warner Bros. ) ; Andy M . Stewart , &quot; Man in the Moon &quot; ( Green Linnet ) ; Eli Riddle , &quot; Eli Riddle &quot; ( Vital Music ) ; Nine Inch Nails , &quot; The Downward Spiral &quot; ( Nothing / Interscope / TVT / Atlantic ) ; Huun-Huur-Tu , &quot; 60 Horses in My Herd &quot; ( Shanachie ) ; Kristin Hersh , &quot; Hips and Makers &quot; ( Reprise ) . Boehm : Favorite Local Albums In order of preference : Orange County is broadly defined for the purposes of this list : It includes L.A. ' s Liquor Giants and Long_Beach ' s One Hit Wonder and Bierce in L.A. on the basis of longstanding historical and musical ties to the O.C. scene . Boehm feels that this easily is the strongest crop of O.C. rock he has encountered since he started covering music here in 1988 . 1 . Jann Browne , &quot; Count Me In &quot; : I ' ll say no more lest I commence gushing , which is unseemly in a critic . 2 . Liquor Giants , &quot; Here &quot; : On top of everything else , it includes a loving cover of &quot; Hold My Hand , &quot; a Dave Davies song that hardly anyone has heard . I hadn ' t , and that ' s saying something when it comes_to the Kinks . 3 . Eli Riddle , &quot; Eli Riddle &quot; ( Vital Music ) : Modest Jon Melkerson is the best alternative-rock guitarist Orange County has produced , and the introspective songwriting , influenced by Television and Neil Young , is as strong as the playing on this do-it-yourself album . 4 . Offspring , &quot; Smash &quot; ( Epitaph ) : a punk_rock album so catchy that it never gets tiresome . Its success was built mainly on_the_hooks , the sonic architecture and a memorable lead voice , but the lyrical substance is there , too , for those who want to look deeper . 5 . Chris Gaffney , &quot; Man of Somebody ' s Dreams &quot; ( Red Moon -- Swiss import ) : would move_up a_few notches if it weren ' t a live album drawn mainly from the two Gaffney studio albums that topped this list in 1990 and ' 92 . 6 . Bierce in L.A. , &quot; Vale of Tears &quot; ( Rococo ) : Bierce ' s auteur , Stanley Wycoff , surrounds himself with superb players , grounds himself in country tradition , then starts taking potshots at its pieties in a gritty , jaundiced collection . 7 . One Hit Wonder , &quot; Not in This Town &quot; ( Lethal EP ) and &quot; Long_Beach vs . the World &quot; ( Doctor Dream single ) : the state_of_the_art in punk-pop . Songs that would make you hum incessantly if their tremendous clout didn ' t knock the wind out of you first . 8 . James Harman Band , &quot; Cards on the Table &quot; ( Black Top ) : Harman ' s always-infectious personality and blues acumen are backed by some of his strongest songs in years . Marks the auspicious recording debut of Robby Eason , teen-age guitarist extraordinaire . 9 . Big Sandy and His Fly-Rite Boys , &quot; Jumpin ' From 6 to 6 &quot; ( HighTone ) : Rockabilly merges with Western swing and a touch of R &amp; B in music that could be dubbed ' 50s nostalgia if it weren ' t so completely vibrant and infectious . The best sort of good-time rock ' n ' roll . 10 . Chantays , &quot; Next Set &quot; ( Chantay Productions ) : Their first new album since 1964 rides a wave of cool fire with clean , taut surf-rock guitar architecture . Strong new material complements remade oldies from Surfin ' Valhalla . Honorable_mention ( alphabetically by band ) : Barrelhouse , &quot; Soul Pimps ' N ' Blues Pushers &quot; ( Steady Rollin ' ) ; Bazooka , &quot; Blowhole &quot; ( SST ) ; Big Drill Car , &quot; No Worse for the Wear &quot; ( Cargo / Headhunter ) ; Cadillac Tramps , &quot; It ' s Allright &quot; ( Doctor Dream ) ; Cisco Poison , &quot; It ' s a Long Way to Heaven . . . &quot; ( Doctor Dream ) ; Dan Crary , &quot; Jammed If I Do &quot; ( Sugar Hill ) ; Dick Dale , &quot; Unknown Territory &quot; ( HighTone ) ; D.I. , &quot; State of Shock &quot; ( Doctor Dream ) ; Diamondback , &quot; Ragin ' Wind &quot; ( Deadeye ) ; Sydney Ellis , &quot; Goin ' Home &quot; ( Black Wallet ) ; Fluf , &quot; Home Improvements &quot; ( Headhunter ) ; Fu Manchu , &quot; No One Rides for Free &quot; ( Bong Load ) ; Various artists , &quot; Homespun : A Collection of Fullerton Artists &quot; ( Homespun ) ; Robert Lucas , &quot; Layaway &quot; ( AudioQuest ) ; Lee Rocker ' s Big Blue , &quot; Lee Rocker ' s Big Blue &quot; ( Black Top ) ; Rule 62 , &quot; Love and Decline &quot; ( Lethal ) ; Smile , &quot; Maquee &quot; ( Cargo / Headhunter ) ; Supernova , &quot; Calling Hong Kong &quot; ( Goldenrod single ) ; Walter Trout Band , &quot; Tellin ' Stories &quot; ( Silvertone ) ; Volkwood Ghost , &quot; Wagon_Train &quot; ( Kismet Ghreen cassette EP ) ; Junior Watson , &quot; Long Overdue &quot; ( Black Top ) ; The Ziggens , &quot; Rusty Never Sleeps &quot; ( Skunk ) . Belated kudos from late ' 93 : Big Enjoyers , &quot; Gronkin ' Quiver &quot; ( Neabuzz ) . Boehm : Favorite Concerts In order of preference : 1 . Nirvana ( L.A. Sports Arena , Dec . 30 , 1993 ) ; 2 . Joe Ely ( Coach_House , Nov . 11 ) ; 3 . Dramarama ( Coach_House , Jan . 8 early show ) ; 4 . Joyride and One Hit Wonder ( Club 369 , April 23 ) ; 5 . Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions ( Universal Amphitheatre , May 11 ) ; 6 . Kristin Hersh ( Coach_House , May 6 ) ; 7 . Offspring and the Pretenders at KROQ &quot; Weenie_Roast &quot; ( Irvine Meadows , June 11 ) ; 8 . James Harman Band and Hollywood Fats Band at &quot; Blues Harmonica Blowdown &quot; ( The Strand , March 19 ) ; 9 . Richard Thompson ( Coach_House , March 18 ) ; 10 . Charlie Watts ( Rose Bowl , Oct . 21 . The rest of the blokes were OK , too ) . Randy Lewis : Favorite Albums In order of preference : 1 . Johnny Cash , &quot; American Recordings &quot; ( American ) : Harrowing songs about sin and redemption , faith and temptation are delivered with naked power by an American legend . Unlike anything else in the Man in Black ' s remarkable career . 2 . Neil Young and Crazy Horse , &quot; Sleeps With Angels &quot; ( Reprise ) : Young ' s fury about an increasingly violent society and its tragic effects come_through loud and clear in his raw lyrics and his stinging guitar work . 3 . Iris DeMent , &quot; My Life &quot; ( Warner Bros. ) : This has a more consistently somber tone than her knockout 1993 debut album , but DeMent ' s songs about love , loss and family are every bit as richly observed and expressively sung . 4 . Jann Browne , &quot; Count Me In &quot; ( Red Moon ) : This Orange County country artist put_together a group of songs as accessible as anything out of Nashville and more insightfully written than 99 % of what ' s on the country charts . So why is this killer album available only in Europe ? 5 . The Proclaimers , &quot; Hit the Highway &quot; ( Chrysalis ) : Craig and Charlie Reid , Scotland ' s twin folk rockers , fleshed_out their folk-skiffle sound with full rock instrumentation on their third album . It makes their songs about the quest_for faith in an often-faithless world that much more powerful . 6 . The Mavericks , &quot; What a Crying Shame &quot; ( MCA ) : This is part of the 1 % of Nashville country that matters . Raul Malo ' s songwriting has gotten razor sharp on the group ' s second album . His writing , singing and the band ' s playing can evoke the grandeur of Roy Orbison , the ache of Hank Williams or the sheer fun of Buck Owens . 7 . Crowded House , &quot; Together Alone &quot; ( Capitol ) : You ' ll look long and hard before finding a more graceful , tuneful or thoughtful pure pop album . 8 . Beausoleil , &quot; L ' Echo &quot; ( Forward ) : a living , breathing , moving tribute to the pioneering Cajun and zydeco musicians who inspired the boys of Beausoleil , the best Cajun band in the land . 9 . Various artists , &quot; Tulare Dust : A Songwriters ' Salute to Merle Haggard &quot; ( HighTone ) : Haggard ' s songs chronicling the seemingly eternal struggles facing the working class are given ideal treatments by the_likes_of Joe Ely , Rosie Flores , Billy Joe Shaver and others . 10 . Bob Woodruff , &quot; Dreams and Saturday Nights &quot; ( Asylum ) : Woodruff ' s solid debut album evokes the underdog spirit of Gram Parsons . Lewis : Favorite Concerts In order of preference : 1 . Buck Owens ( Crazy Horse Steak House , July 19 ) ; 2 . The Proclaimers ( Coach_House , Aug . 7 ) ; 3 . Tabu Ley Rochereau and Orchestre Afrisa International ( Long_Beach Museum of Art , Aug . 24 ) ; 4 . The Mavericks ( In Cahoots , Feb . 16 ) ; 5 . Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions ( Irvine Meadows , May 14 ) ; 6 . Emmylou Harris ( Crazy Horse , July 11 ) ; 7 . Jimmie Dale Gilmore ( Crazy Horse , Feb . 14 ) ; 8 . Preservation Hall Jazz_Band of New Orleans ( Irvine Barclay Theatre , July 7 ) ; 9 . Carlene Carter ( Crazy Horse , Feb . 21 ) ; 10 . Jann Browne ( Rio Grande Bar &amp; Grill , May 6 ) . Jim Washburn : Favorite Albums In order of preference : 1 . Pat McLaughlin , &quot; Unglued &quot; ( Dos Records ) : I ' ve listened to knockabout singer / songwriter McLaughlin ' s disc easily 100 times past these 12 months , and it still stands -- in clear spite of its obfuscatory lyrics -- as the most emotionally direct , affecting and timeless music I ' ve heard this year . Think John Hiatt . Think Van Morrison . Then think_of someone that good who you ' ve never heard . 2 . Ted Hawkins , &quot; The Next Hundred Years &quot; ( DGC Records ) : If Sam Cooke had spent a long life scraping_by , playing for change on sidewalks , he well might sound like this . Hawkins has Cooke ' s melodic sweetness , melodic knack and expressive voice , but they ' re all shaped by a life of hard experience . 3 . Richard Thompson , &quot; Mirror Blue &quot; ( Capitol Records ) : Not one track here can equal Thompson ' s spellbinding live versions , but even so , this remains a remarkable piece of songcrafting . &quot; Beeswing &quot; alone contains more narrative heartbreak than most albums . 4 . Jann Browne , &quot; Count Me In &quot; ( Red Moon -- Swiss import ) : No local favoritism here . Browne and her band have come_up with deeply etched songs and heart-tugging performances that put most other country acts to shame . 5 . Junior Watson , &quot; Long Overdue &quot; ( Black Top ) : O.C. guitarist Watson plays so authentically within blues tradition that you ' d swear nothing here was recorded after 1959 , yet his whimsically stinging solos show that tradition puts no limits on invention and immediacy . 6 . Neil Young and Crazy Horse , &quot; Sleeps With Angels &quot; ( Reprise Records ) : Hard to believe this guy ever put_up with Crosby , Stills &amp; Nash . It ' s the usual Young fare here : the limited voice , the squonky , over-the-top guitar work , and the songs that somehow make_it all fresh and vital one more time . 7 . Chris Gaffney , &quot; Man of Somebody ' s Dreams &quot; ( Red Moon -- Swiss import ) : This live album of singer Gaffney backed by his guitarist Danny Ott and Jann Browne ' s band is a fine sampling of his gritty country style and distinctive songs . He ' s better with his own band -- which plays bars in Orange County almost weekly -- but the closing &quot; Waltz for Minnie &quot; here packs more emotion than a year of Nashville output . 8 . Manu Dibango , &quot; Wakafrica &quot; ( Giant ) : Cameroonian saxophonist Dibango makes a rich musical tour of his continent with help from King Sunny Ade , Salif Keita , Youssou N ' Dour and others . 9 . Jimmy Vaughan , &quot; Strange Pleasure &quot; ( CBS Records ) : With his debut solo album -- and first outing since brother Stevie Ray ' s tragic death -- Vaughan gives the blues some fresh twists , with rich vocal harmonies and jazzy organ , and songs that are like a dip in a spiritual pool . 10 . The Chantays , &quot; Next Set &quot; ( Chantay Productions ) : While Dick Dale is basking in his justly deserved revival , the originators of &quot; Pipeline &quot; have come_back from lounge hell with a powerful , evocative set of surf instrumentals . Washburn : Favorite Concerts In order of preference : 1 . Richard Thompson ( Coach_House , March 18 ) ; 2 . John Hammond ( San Juan Capistrano Regional Library , June 3 ) ; 3 . Samba Ngo ( San Juan Capistrano Regional Library , Aug . 20 ) ; 4 . Jimmy Vaughan ( Coach_House , July 28 ) ; 5 . Rosanne Cash ( Coach_House , Aug . 1 ) ; 6 . Chris Gaffney and the Cold Hard Facts ( the Canyon Inn , just about any Wednesday ) ; 7 . Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions ( Irvine Meadows , May 14 ) ; 8 . The Subdudes , Pat McLaughlin ( Coach_House , May 18 ) ; 9 . Emmylou Harris ( Crazy Horse , July 11 ) ; 10 . Bazooka ( The Lab , Nov . 13 ) ; 11 . Jimmie Dale Gilmore ( A Taste of Orange County , June 26 ) ; 12 . Love ( Coach_House , July 24 ) . Buddy Seigal : Favorite Albums No particular order : 1 . War , &quot; Peace Sign &quot; ( Avenue ) : These ' 70s hitmakers have been an inspiration to many modern hip-hop and acid jazz artists ( not to mention one of the most frequently sampled acts of all time ) , but who would have guessed that they ' d come_back in 1994 with perhaps the most vital and interesting album of their career ? The title cut and &quot; East L.A. &quot; sound better than &quot; Low Rider &quot; and &quot; The Cisco Kid &quot; when played_back to back . The efforts of contemporary imitators such_as the Solsonics come_off as anemic in comparison . Still fresh , still throbbing , still able to pack any dance_floor . 2 . Black 47 , &quot; Home of the Brave &quot; ( SBK / EMI ) : Sounding like a raging cross between the Clash , Doxy ' s Midnight Runners and Bruce Springsteen , Black 47 proves that rock can still be angry and rebellious without being whining or self-important , can still be loud and aggressive without being tuneless and overbearing . Frontman / principal songwriter Larry Kirwan sings political anthems about his native Ireland with a rare passion and intelligence , while the band somehow negotiates a seamless truce between traditional Celtic melody and punk sensibility . An-often jolting album from a group that deserves wider recognition outside of its New York base of operation . 3 . Buster Poindexter , &quot; Buster ' s Happy_Hour &quot; ( Forward ) : In a year when swing and classic R &amp; B made something of a mini-comeback , Brian Setzer ' s embarrassingly whitebread but Disney-backed project seemed to garner all_the attention . that ' s unfortunate , because Buster ' s overlooked gem of an album is the real goods , full of period attitude , swinging arrangements , whiskey-marinated originals and solid covers , which range from Roy Brown and Joe Liggins to the Kinks ( ! ? ! ) . Buster croons and shouts like a real pro , his band jumps the blues till the walls vibrate with brassy ecstasy . &quot; The Worst Beer I Ever Had &quot; ought to be required programming on every dive-bar jukebox in the country . 4 . &quot; Backbeat , &quot; original motion_picture soundtrack ( Virgin ) : Not the album that features a studio band waxing covers of the Beatles waxing covers , but the surprisingly enjoyable album of original jazz compositions by Don Was . Trumpeter Terrence Blanchard and saxophonist David McMurray shine brightly here , turning_in lyrical , intriguing solos throughout , and Was must be credited for linking Bo Diddley to John Coltrane on the eye-opening &quot; You Asked , I Came. &quot; This album is more original and purely listenable than anything released by such young lions as Joshua Redman and Wynton Marsalis this year , a surprising testament to the principals and a damning indictment of stagnation in the modern_jazz scene . 5 . Johnny Cash , &quot; American Recordings &quot; ( American ) : The simple pleasures of Cash ' s reassuring baritone , a warm-sounding acoustic_guitar and a batch of homespun folk_songs remain relevant and essential listening . It takes as much nerve to record an album like this in 1994 as it does raw , native instinct and pure talent to actually pull it off without sounding like you ' re trying too hard . Cash even manages to inject soul and wisdom into a song by heavy-metal muscleman Glen Danzig -- no small accomplishment . 6 . Ben Harper , &quot; Welcome to the Cruel World &quot; ( Virgin ) : If Harper is a singer / songwriter sorely in need of a sense_of_humor , chalk it up_to youthful intransigence -- everyone believes they have all_the answers at age 23 . Harper still manages to display extraordinary originality in his songcraft , vocal technique and bottleneck guitar chops on this , the debut album of the year . Plus , his spiritual / political vision is refreshing and intelligent , if sadly idealistic / unrealistic , in the age of Newt Gingrich , Jesse Helms and Proposition 187 . 7 . Dr. John , &quot; Television &quot; ( GRP / MCA ) : The Good Doctor returns to what he truly excels_at , with a swampy , steaming album of New Orleans funk that picks_up where he left_off way back in 1973 , with his career-best &quot; In the Right Place &quot; album . He could ' ve done without the rap interlude by Anthony Kiedes , though , which sounds more like an old_man ' s grudging nod to the contemporary than it does a vital ingredient in a Dr. John prescription . 8 . Jerry Jeff Walker , &quot; Viva Luckenbach ! &quot; ( Rykodisc ) : definitely an acquired taste , but just as fine as chorizo con huevos washed_down with a Lone Star beer once you ' ve developed it . Walker and the Gonzo Compadres return to Luckenbach to record a live disc on the 20th anniversary of his celebrated &quot; Viva Terlingua ! &quot; album . New tunes , old tunes , celebrations of Texas and its crazed inhabitants , all_of which are sung in a pleasantly artless manner and feel as easy and comfortable as a beat-up old Stetson . Metaphysical quotation : &quot; The call us the Gonzo Compadres / Los gatos con queso / And we love our mommies. &quot; 9 . Al Kooper , &quot; ReKOOPERation &quot; ( MusicMasters ) : Onetime guitarist with the Royal Teens ( &quot; Short_Stories &quot; ) , Brill Building house composer , keyboardist on Dylan ' s prime cuts_in the ' 60s and with the Blues Project , founder of Blood , Sweat &amp; Tears -- not to mention producer , A &amp; R man , author and underrated solo artist -- Kooper has been out of circulation for too many years . He returns here with a ( mostly ) instrumental jazz and R &amp; B album featuring such old running partners as trumpeter Randy Brecker , bassists Harvey Brooks and Jim Fielder , plus legendary saxophonist Hank Crawford , New York guitar hotshot Jimmy Vivino and a host of others . The sound is sweaty , urban and seriously soulful , ala prime Ray Charles and Booker T . &amp; The MG ' s . Kooper plays a meaner Hammond here than ever before , writes some sharp tunes and arranges some groovin ' charts . Welcome back , don ' t be a stranger ! 10 . Various artists , &quot; The Specialty Story &quot; ( Specialty ) : Five-disc box set chronicling the history of the Hollywood-based record label , best known as the home of Little Richard in his hit-making youth . The real story here , though , is the reintroduction of hot sides that have been out_of_print for eons by such important , seminal R &amp; B figures as Roy Milton , Joe and Jimmy Liggins , Percy Mayfield , Larry Williams and Don &amp; Dewey . It also includes obscure but vastly entertaining artists such a Daddy Cleanhead , Joe Lutcher and Jim Wynn as well as rare , early material by the_likes_of Sam Cooke , Lloyd Price , Clifton Chenier , John Lee Hooker , Jesse Belvin , Ernie K-Doe and more . The package includes a 44-page booklet , loaded with great photos and featuring incisive notes by anthology compiler and long-time studio fixture Billy Vera .
