   <HEADLINE> INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT ; UNSER PASSES MICHIGAN TEST , GETS UP TO 226.478</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first four days of practice for the May 29 Indianapolis 500 have been the safest in the track ' s history . Seventy cars have been driven 6 # 930 laps -- 17 # 325 miles -- at speeds_up to 230 m.p.h. with only one minor accident . That occurred when Mike Groff ' s car slid in a patch of oil and hit the wall last Monday . The car , a Lola-Honda , suffered minor damage and Groff escaped with a bruised foot . Windy conditions kept speeds down Wednesday as Al Unser Jr . recorded the fastest lap , 226.478 m.p.h. , in one of Roger Penske ' s Mercedes-Benz-powered cars . That was_well below the 230.403 posted Tuesday by Raul Boesel , in a Lola-Ford Cosworth . Unser credited the quick lap to running 520 miles in a test Sunday at Michigan International Speedway . &quot; It ' s been really , really important for us to run_up there , &quot; Unser said . &quot; It has helped us coming here . I ' ve heard what people are saying ( about sandbagging ) , but the Marlboro Penske is not locked_in for the pole . We need to get the car around the corners to go quick . You can have all_the horsepower in the world , but you ' ve still got_to get_around the corners. &quot; Scott Brayton , in a Lola-Menard , was fastest Sunday , followed by Michael Andretti ' s Reynard-Ford Cosworth on Monday , Boesel on Tuesday and Unser on Wednesday . Pole qualifying is Saturday . * When Bobby Rahal practiced in his Honda-powered Lola , it was the first time a Japanese manufacturer had participated in the Indy 500 , but it was not the first Japanese involvement . Hiro Matsushita was the first to drive_in the 500 in 1991 . The late Takio ( Chickie ) Hirashima , a California-born Japanese , was a riding mechanic for George Robson ' s winning car in 1946 and also was in_charge of Autolite ' s Indy spark-plug program in the ' 70s . * Johnny Parsons , an 11-time 500 starter and a former Los Angeles policeman , has replaced rookie Michael Greenfield in Peter Greenfield ' s ' 93 Lola-Greenfield . The engine is a 209-cubic-inch model similar to Penske ' s Ilmor Mercedes power_plants . Parsons ' father , the late Johnnie Parsons , won the 500 in 1950 . * Defending 500 champion Emerson Fittipaldi , on the death of his close friend Ayrton Senna : &quot; The world lost the greatest athlete in the history of motor racing. &quot; SHAV GLICK</TEXT>
