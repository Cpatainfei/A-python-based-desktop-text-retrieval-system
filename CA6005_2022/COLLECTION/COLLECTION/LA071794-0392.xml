   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; ALL TIED AFTER 56 YEARS ; ITALY AND BRAZIL HAVE SPLIT THEIR FOUR WORLD CUP MATCHES ; TODAY ONE COUNTRY WILL MAKE HISTORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Had the 1994 World Cup proceeded according to the script , this story could not have been written . It was supposed to be Brazil against Germany today at the Rose Bowl , not Brazil against Italy . The Brazilians and Germans were expected to replay their memorable 3-3 tie of a year ago , when the teams met at RFK Stadium in Washington in U.S. Cup ' 93 competition . Yes , this afternoon ' s match was to be the clash of two three-time champions , but one team was supposed to be wearing black , red and yellow , not blue . Despite playing a combined total of 145 World Cup matches , Brazil and Germany have never played each other in the World Cup . A Brazil-Germany final at the Rose Bowl was to have broken that pattern , thereby &quot; making soccer history , &quot; in the organizers ' felicitous phrase . Instead , we have an equally intriguing , if not historic , game between Brazil and Italy . Have they met in the past ? Indeed they have . . . . JUNE 16 , 1938 Italy 2 , Brazil 1 With a frightened Europe moving inexorably closer to war , the third_World Cup was played in France , providing a brief couple of weeks of pleasure in a time of grave uncertainty . The Italians were the defending champions , having taken Benito Mussolini at his word when he sent the team a telegram before the 1934 final saying &quot; Win or die ! &quot; The Brazilians were another of the favorites and had in their ranks a player of sublime skills , a man whose talents were so remarkable that he was given not one , but two nicknames . Leonidas da Silva was his real name , but he was known as &quot; O Homen Borracha &quot; ( the Rubber Man ) for his agility and his bicycle kicks with either foot . More commonly , however , he was called &quot; O Diamante Negro &quot; ( the Black_Diamond ) . His value was immeasurable . In early round victories over Poland and Czechoslovakia , Leonidas scored six of Brazil ' s nine goals . Italy , meanwhile , went_into the semifinal game against Brazil at the Stade Velodrome in Marseille confident of success . The Italians had a remarkable goal-scorer of_their_own , Silvio Piola , whose strength was in the air . In an astonishing decision that even today , more_than half a century later , cannot be rationalized , Brazil ' s coach , Ademar Pimenta , elected not to play Leonidas , explaining that he was &quot; saving him for the final. &quot; The Brazilians never got there , or they might have been playing for their fifth world championship today , not their fourth . Brazil kept Piola in check but could not deny Italy , which satisfied its fans in the crowd of 35 # 000 by providing goals from Gino Colaussi and Giuseppe Meazza . Brazil ' s Romeo scored a consolation goal late in the game , but Italy was clearly the better team . JUNE 21 , 1970 Brazil 4 , Italy 1 This was one of those games that time travel one day will be invented in_order to see . Travelers from the future will line_up in droves to return to Azteca Stadium in Mexico_City on that memorable afternoon . Brazil featured what correctly has been described as the greatest attacking team ever . In its star-studded ranks were , among others , Pele , Jairzinho , Roberto Rivelinho , Carlos Alberto and Gerson . Italy , meanwhile , featured , among others , Giacinto Facchetti , Alessandro Mazzola , Luigi Riva and , if only as a substitute , Gianni Rivera . As things turned_out , it would not have mattered who the Italians put_on the field . The Brazilians were devastating , and the crowd of 107 # 000 was treated to a display of offensive fireworks that has not been equaled . It took them only 18 minutes to score their first goal , Pele rising above the defense to powerfully head_home a cross from Jairzinho . It was a goal for the record books , Brazil ' s 100th in World Cup competition . The Italians pounced on a Brazlian defensive error late in the first_half and Roberto Boninsegna tied the score . The second 45 minutes belonged_to Brazil and , as a result , to the world . Gerson orchestrated the attack , sparking it in the 65th minute with a superbly struck shot from the edge of the penalty area . Gerson then provided the cross that Pele headed into Jairzinho ' s path so that Jairzinho could make history by becoming the first player to score a goal in every round of the competition . Leading , 3-1 , Brazil completed the victory in memorable fashion when Pele sent an excellent diagonal pass to overlapping fullback Carlos Alberto , who rocketed a shot into the back of the net to make Brazil the first country to win the title three times . JUNE 24 , 1978 Brazil 2 , Italy 1 Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires was the scene of the third_World Cup meeting between the Brazilians and Italians , who this time faced each other in a game both would rather have avoided . Nothing more exciting than third place was_on the line . The crowd of 76 # 609 favored the Italians and was rewarded in the 38th minute when Franco Causio headed in a cross from Paolo Rossi , who would make his own name four years later in Spain . Just as in 1970 , however , the second_half belonged_to Brazil , which tied the score in the 64th minute when a 35-yard shot by Nelinho deceived Italian goalkeeper Dino Zoff , then won it 60 seconds later when Dirceu volleyed home a shot from just outside the penalty area . Compared to their earlier clashes , this one was not nearly as exciting , but Brazil did have the consolation of finishing the tournament unbeaten even though it had to settle for the bronze medal . JULY 5 , 1982 Italy 3 , Brazil 2 Played_at tiny Sarria Stadium in Barcelona , the game attracted a capacity crowd of 44 # 000 , with hundreds more watching from the rooftops and balconies overlooking the stadium . And what a match they saw , one of the best of the 1982 tournament . The Brazilians needed only a point to reach the semifinals . The Italians had to win to advance , so they attacked from the opening whistle and went_ahead when striker Paolo Rossi headed in a center from left back Antonio Cabrini . Undeterred , the Brazilians continued to move the ball with ease and in a casual , almost arrogant fashion . Seven minutes later , they were tied , the elegant Socrates having slotted home Zico ' s pass from an almost impossible angle . A Brazilian mistake in the 25th minute proved costly when Rossi intercepted a careless pass_by Toninho Cerezo and fired home his second goal . There was no more scoring until the 68th minute , when Paolo Roberto Falcao struck a left-footed shot that tied the score , 2-2 . Brazil needed only to keep the score tied for another 22 minutes and it would have made the semifinals . But it is not in the Brazilian nature to defend -- at least it was not in those days -- and they continued to attack . That left the door open for the Italians to do likewise . The result was predictable . Needing to win , Italy got the decisive goal with 15 minutes remaining when a poor clearance by Junior fell at Rossi ' s feet and he hammered home the goal that sent his country through to the semifinals and the Brazilians home . Dino Zoff , the goalkeeper who had allowed Brazil two long-range goals in the 1978 game , made a superb save in the closing minutes to preserve the victory . Brazil , as usual , was the most attractive , most adventurous , most exciting team in the tournament , but that was not enough . Italy went_on to win the World Cup for a third time . The fifth chapter in their 56-year rivalry will be written this afternoon .
