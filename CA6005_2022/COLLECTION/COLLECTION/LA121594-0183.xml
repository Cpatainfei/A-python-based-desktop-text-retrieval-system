   <HEADLINE> SIMPSON DISTRAUGHT IN JAIL VISIT , DEPUTY SAYS ; TRIAL : HEARING DEALS WITH ADMISSIBILITY OF DEFENDANT ' S CONVERSATION WITH ROSIE GRIER THAT OFFICER SAYS HE OVERHEARD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A crying and distraught O.J. Simpson blurted_out two sentences to friend and minister Rosey Grier during an emotional jailhouse visit Nov . 13 , according to testimony Wednesday by a sheriff ' s deputy who says he overheard a snippet of their conversation . Although Deputy Jeff Stuart did not repeat what he said he overheard , Deputy Dist . Atty . William Hodgman questioned him at length during a cryptic hearing in which prosecutors and defense_attorneys were forced to argue about a statement that neither has read . Hodgman was hoping to show that the conversation was so loud that Simpson and Grier waived the privilege that normally protects the privacy of discussions between an inmate and a clergyman . Simpson -- who has pleaded not_guilty to the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman -- seemed relaxed and cheerful as Wednesday ' s hearing unfolded , chatting quietly with his lawyers as the deputy testified . The issue of whether the jailhouse talk should remain confidential was unresolved at the end of the day , but Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito is expected to take it up again when Simpson ' s trial resumes this morning . In other developments Wednesday : * Sources close to the case said prosecutors drilled into Nicole Brown Simpson ' s safety_deposit_box last month and secured four photos depicting her with bruises and cuts . Although the photos purport to show injuries inflicted by O.J. Simpson , members of Simpson ' s camp downplayed the significance of the discovery , saying that the photos were taken_in the wake of a 1989 incident in which Simpson pleaded guilty to spousal battery and noting that most if not all_of the photos already were in the hands of prosecutors . * Defense_attorneys angrily announced that they received more_than 1 # 000 pages of prosecution material just hours before they are scheduled to begin a hearing this afternoon on the admissibility of evidence relating to &quot; domestic discord &quot; between O.J. and Nicole Simpson . Among the documents , they said , is a 64-page statement from Faye Resnick , whose salacious book about Nicole Simpson briefly flared as an issue in the case during jury selection . * Prosecutors submitted their formal opposition to a defense proposal for hearing DNA evidence in the case . Simpson ' s lawyers want that hearing to take_place after opening statements and in front of the jury . Prosecutors called that suggestion &quot; as beguiling and simple on one level as it is misleading and without legal merit on the other. &quot; Although it was not resolved Wednesday , the issue of Simpson ' s conversation with Grier continued to overshadow the proceedings , this time as part of a mysterious hearing in which lawyers and witnesses talked at length about a short conversation but never revealed what was said . * Stuart said he had been doing paperwork in a control booth about 10 feet from Simpson when he heard a loud bang -- the sound of Simpson slamming down a phone in the visitors ' area . Simpson then slammed his fist on the table . &quot; Mr. Simpson appeared to be crying , &quot; Stuart testified . &quot; He appeared to be very upset. &quot; Asked to describe Simpson ' s tone_of_voice during a brief exchange with Grier , Stuart replied : &quot; He was yelling . . . . It was very loud , in a raised voice. &quot; Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , one of two lead attorneys on Simpson ' s defense_team , cross-examined Stuart for nearly an hour , eliciting the deputy ' s acknowledgment that the Sheriff ' s Department trains its staff not to eavesdrop on conversations between inmates and their ministers . Moreover , the deputy said he was stationed inside a glass booth whose windows are tinted -- which could have led Simpson to believe that no one was listening while he spoke with Grier . Stuart added , however , that Simpson ' s girlfriend , Paula Barbieri , often peered through the tinted windows and waved at the deputies . She sometimes did that when Simpson was present , Stuart added , which Hodgman said demonstrated that Simpson should have known deputies routinely staffed the booth . Even if Ito allows the statement to be shared with prosecutors , it is not clear that it would hurt Simpson ' s case . Although sources familiar_with the statement say that it could be interpreted as incriminating to Simpson , they add that it is ambiguous . Cochran stressed Wednesday that the deputy did not hear the comments immediately before or after the exchange , so he does not know the context in which the remarks were made . After hearing the exchange , Stuart wrote a document describing what he said he had heard . That document has been given to Ito , but it has not been turned_over to the attorneys on either side of the case . A second set of comments allegedly overheard by three deputies two weeks later also were forwarded to Ito , but those do not deal with the Nov . 13 conversation between Grier and Simpson . After reviewing a copy of their statements , Cochran called them &quot; much ado about nothing. &quot; Ito allowed prosecutors to have a copy . Wednesday ' s hearing underscored what has been a months-long legal tug of war between the Sheriff ' s Department and the defense_team lawyers over where they can meet with Simpson outside of normal visitation hours at the Men ' s Central Jail . From Monday through Thursday , lawyers and clients are able to confer in a first-floor room off the jail ' s main entrance where they can talk and -- with a deputy ' s permission -- pass documents between them across from tables with only a teller-like window between them . But on weekends , they use a third-floor infirmary visiting room , where Simpson and his attorneys confer in private but are separated by glass and must speak_to each other by phone . The Sheriff ' s Department favors the arrangement because a guard already is_on duty and no overtime pay is required . Simpson ' s attorneys say they don ' t like it . &quot; You talk_about special privileges , &quot; Cochran said outside court . &quot; Special privileges is we were put_in a room where bailiffs could sit and stand right behind and listen . . . . We objected to being put_in this room all along. &quot; It was in that visiting area , sitting behind tinted glass , that Stuart allegedly overheard a snippet of conversation Nov . 13 between Simpson and Grier . The incident was reported to Ito 15 days later . The next day , Nov . 29 , Ito and the attorneys toured the jail . Shapiro said he would not return to the visitation area until there are better accommodations to ensure the confidentiality of conversations between him and his client . &quot; We were assured we had it , &quot; he said . &quot; The sheriff told us we had it . The judge told us we had it . And it turns_out we didn ' t. &quot; James M . Owens , principal deputy county counsel , said the Sheriff ' s Department is making plans to modify the third-floor room to take_care of privacy concerns . &quot; that ' s our deal , &quot; Owens said . &quot; When we have our modifications completed , Judge Ito is welcome to come_back and look_at it . . . and give it a yea or a nay . But Judge Ito has been pretty supportive of our position. &quot; * As the judge and lawyers in the Simpson case proceeded with their spirited series of debates over the evidence that will be presented to the jury , prosecutors lodged their formal objection to a novel defense proposal for dealing with DNA test results . In a motion filed Tuesday , Simpson ' s lawyers suggested that Ito delay the vitally important DNA hearing and instead allow them to argue the merits of scientific evidence in front of the jury . Under the defense proposal , the jury , which normally is excluded from such sessions , would be allowed to sit in on the DNA debate , one that could involve weeks of highly technical information . As expected , prosecutors objected Wednesday . &quot; A jury confronted with several weeks of unnecessary scientific testimony will be both unduly burdened with irrelevant evidence and forced to forget important facts , &quot; prosecutors said in their motion . &quot; Neither ( the defense ) nor the prosecution should be compelled to abandon the orderly presentation of evidence. &quot; Before tackling the question of whether DNA test results should be allowed into court , the two sides are readying for another hotly contested debate over evidence . This afternoon they are expected to begin a hearing on the admissibility of evidence relating to domestic abuse during the time that O.J. and Nicole Simpson were married . Among the information that prosecutors may ask Ito to accept are a 1985 incident in which Simpson allegedly smashed the window of a car , a 1989 case where Simpson pleaded no contest to charges of spousal battery , and a 1993 incident during which Nicole Simpson called_for police assistance as a man she identified as her ex-husband tried to break_into her house . It was not clear how the four photographs of a cut and bruised Nicole Simpson seized from her safe deposit_box last month might be used in the case . Prosecutors had most , if not all , of the photos from the 1989 incident ; a court_order from last fall refers to photographs from that incident and notes that they were then in possession of the Police_Department . Nicole Simpson apparently kept copies , which were among the items seized when authorities drilled into her safe deposit_box , sources said . * Times staff writer Ralph Frammolino contributed to this article .</TEXT>
