   <TEXT> C orruptio optimi pessima is an old Latin saying meaning &quot; the corruption of the best thing is the worst kind of corruption , &quot; says Michael O ' Neill , director of the Institute for Nonprofit Organization Management at the University of San Francisco . That is why religious organizations especially should pay_attention to their own ethical behavior , O ' Neill said , &quot; including how they treat their employees and volunteers , and how they communicate with their membership. &quot; As the moderator of a hands-on workshop on ethics and philanthropy titled &quot; Are We Still the Good_Guys ? Ethics and the Nonprofit Sector , &quot; O ' Neill will take_time_off from teaching at the Jesuit university to talk to Angelenos about some of the main ethical issues and challenges that people in religious and other nonprofit organizations face . &quot; It shouldn ' t be assumed about people in any organization that they will behave well just because they ' re in business to do_good , &quot; O ' Neill said . The workshop , scheduled for May 24 at the Japanese American Cultural and Community_Center in Little Tokyo , will pose realistic ethical dilemmas for small panels to tackle with help from the audience . Participants will confront such thorny issues as nepotism and HIV testing for employees . Potential problems will be explored in the areas of financial management , fund raising and marketing , board of director activities , and human resources management . Among the 16 panelists will be Father Gregory Boyle , director of Jobs for the Future , Delores Mission ; Linda Griego , chief_executive_officer of RLA , and Deborah Ching , executive_director of the Chinatown Service Center . O ' Neill noted that the nonprofit sector of the economy accounts_for 1.4 million organizations with a money flow of about half a_trillion dollars a year , 8 million paid staff and 90 million volunteers . He said about half of all charitable giving_in the United States goes_to religious organizations . Mary Jean Gilbert , a conference organizer who is chairwoman of the ethics education committee of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Society of Fund-Raising Executives , said it is important to heighten awareness of ethical behavior in nonprofit organizations &quot; so that we don ' t endanger philanthropic giving -- which comes_down to helping individuals . Los Angeles was ranked 48th among 50 large cities for philanthropic giving_in the February issue of the Chronicle of Philanthropy , O ' Neill said . But he cautioned that the study may_not reflect ethnic giving patterns in cities as diverse as Los Angeles . A study titled &quot; Ethnic Philanthropy &quot; just published by his institute examined practices of giving , sharing and volunteering in eight ethnic communities in the San Francisco area . It showed that members of minority communities are &quot; as likely as in the dominant culture to share money , food , housing and clothing , but in a much less formal way . And ethnic philanthropy in America is even more likely to be linked to religious tradition than white philanthropy , &quot; he said . The ethics workshop , sponsored by the local chapter of the National Society of Fund-Raising Executives and the California Community Foundation , is set for 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. May 24 , at the Japanese American Cultural and Community_Center , 244 S .
