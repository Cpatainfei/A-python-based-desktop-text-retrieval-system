   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; ROAD MAP TO THE WORLDWIDE INTERNET ; DIFFERENT AVENUES FOR GAINING NETWORK ACCESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Say you ' re at the corner of Ventura and Winnetka in Woodland Hills . How do you get_to the Internet from here ? First off , the Internet is not a place . It ' s a thing -- a worldwide network of more_than 15 # 000 computer_networks . It ' s also hot , hot , hot . Fifteen million people are already hooked_up to the Internet , exchanging electronic_mail ( far superior to so-called &quot; snail mail &quot; if only because it ' s free ) , flirting , following the stock_market , playing games , sharing their views electronically on everything from &quot; Melrose Place &quot; to bondage , doing research , telling the White_House what they think and generally having a cyberhoot . But how do you get there from here ? Basically , there are two ways . For years now , Internet access has been one of the standard perks of being affiliated with a college or university . Virtually all college_students , faculty and staff have Internet access at no cost to them through their campus computer_systems . that ' s true at Cal State Northridge , for instance . For those without academic access , by far the cheapest way to get_on the Internet from the Valley is to register with Los Angeles ' first free public-access provider , or free-net . Offered through Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical_Center , the L.A. Free-Net provides full Internet access , including e-mail , for an annual donation of $ 10 ( the donation will be waived for those who can ' t afford to pay ) . According to the nonprofit Hope Unit Foundation , which is the medical_center ' s partner in the project , the donations will pay_for additional phone_lines as usage of the free-net grows . For more information , call the foundation at ( 818 ) 954-0080 . Beginning in October , free or low-cost public access to the Internet will also be provided through many local libraries , thanks to a grant from the California State Library . Valley libraries that are expected to have computers set_up and ready for public use include the L.A. Public_Library branches in Canoga Park , Chatsworth , Encino-Tarzana , Granada Hills , North Hollywood , Northridge , Pacoima , Panorama City , Sherman Oaks , Studio City , Sun Valley , Sylmar , Van Nuys , the West Valley Regional and Woodland Hills . The Glendale Public_Library and the Calabasas branch of the L.A. County Library have also signed_up for the program . The branches will be able to give you more information in the fall . More expensive , but easy to use are the major commercial on-line services such_as Prodigy and Compuserve . The big problem here is that , for now , only DELPHI offers access to all_the resources of the Internet ( most offer little more_than e-mail ) . The good news is that you can sign_up for a five-hour free trial of DELPHI ( 800-695-4005 ) , and its fees begin at a relatively low $ 10 a month ( for the first four hours nights and weekends ) . The bad news is that DELPHI doesn ' t have a graphical interface for its Internet services . Let me explain that in English . The big obstacle to carefree Internet surfing is a historical one . The Internet was created by relatively sophisticated computer users , in the U.S. Defense_Department and elsewhere , whose computers ran_on an operating system known as UNIX . When using this system , they typed various combinations of letters and symbols into their computers to get them to do what they wanted . That was long before the invention of what is fast becoming the standard way to tell your computer what to do -- also known as the easy way : Take your mouse , point at an icon on the screen and click . You have to learn at least a_few of the arcane UNIX commands to access the Internet the old-fashioned way . You will probably want to point and click your way around the Internet , for example , by using a software program called Mosaic . * Among the major commercial users , the one that is gearing_up fastest to serve the computer challenged is America Online ( 800-827-6364 ) . When you sign_up , America Online sends you software that allows you to do most of your business by pointing and clicking . ( The software is also packed in with the June issue of Scientific America and other magazines. ) American Online costs $ 9.95 a month , for the first five hours . And it has an Internet Center that offers an electronic guide called &quot; Zen and the Art of the Internet &quot; and services from the Infobahn ' s favorite magazine , Wired . America Online recently increased its Internet offerings . Subscribers can now tap into Usenet newsgroups ( get a grip on yourself , Chia pet fans ) as well as a menu system_called gopher and a search feature called WAIS . Finally , you can reach the Internet via one of the smaller commercial providers . Netcom ( 800-501-8649 ) is especially popular among local computer users because it has full access , local access numbers and its basic service is $ 17.50 a month ( with credit_card ) , no matter how many hours you use it . There is a one-time sign-up charge of $ 20 . that ' s for something called Shell service that allows your computer to interact with another computer that is hooked into the Internet . Real buffs , seeking to hook their computers directly into the net , thus , becoming a node on the Internet , will want something called SLIP or PPP access . For that , Netcom charges $ 17.50 a month on a credit_card , plus $ 50 to sign_up and $ 2 an hour . Netcom is about to become infinitely more attractive to people who would rather fight than surrender their mouses . By the end of June or the beginning of July , subscribers will have the option of signing_up for Internet access ( the Shell kind ) via Net Cruiser , Netcom ' s new point-and-click software . The company plans to charge $ 19.95 a month for as_many as 25 hours of access . There will be a one-time charge of $ 25 . &quot; It ' s a very nice system , but it still has some bugs in it , &quot; warns a Netcom salesperson . Netcom will automatically update the software for subscribers as the bugs are discovered and worked_out . * You can also get full Internet access via a new provider in Covina , called Lightside ( 1-818-858-9261 ) . Lightside specializes in SLIP and PPP access and costs $ 29.95 a month for the first 30 hours of access , $ 2 an hour after that . There is no sign-up charge .</TEXT>
