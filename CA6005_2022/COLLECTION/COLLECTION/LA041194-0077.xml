   <HEADLINE> VALLEY CHRONICLE : CIVIL WAR BUFFS FORM ROUND_TABLE TO DISCUSS THEIR PASSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the second Tuesday of each month , a small group gathers_in a Van Nuys bookstore to discuss warfare . They are not , however , hashing_over any of the current world hot spots , but instead are fixated on events of 100 years ago . For this disparate band of avid historians , the Civil War is an addiction . They gather to discuss everything from Union Maj . Robert Anderson ' s surrender to Brig . Gen . Pierre G . T . Beauregard at Ft . Sumter to the end of the war when , at Wilmer McLean ' s home at Appomattox Court House , Robert E . Lee , impeccably attired in a full_dress uniform , surrendered to a muddied and disheveled Ulysses S . Grant . The group started at Book Grinders about five months ago , the brainchild of two longtime Civil War buffs , Russell Kean and Steve Phenow . Phenow , a writer with a degree in history , asked Kean if he could organize a Civil War round_table . &quot; There are groups meeting in Long_Beach and Los Angeles , but nothing in the Valley , &quot; Phenow said . The San Fernando Civil War Roundtable was born . &quot; Phenow was the perfect person to start the group because he is so active in so many Civil War historical activities , &quot; said Kean , a Civil War buff for about 45 years . Phenow , 39 , is perhaps best known in the Los Angeles area for his miniatures , which are used to recreate Civil War battles at the Drum Barracks Civil War Museum in Wilmington . &quot; I remember getting interested in the war when I was about 10 years old , &quot; Phenow remembers . &quot; Life magazine , in about 1962 , ran some reconstruction pictures of battles and I was hooked . &quot; By 1982 , when I was living_in San Diego , I had joined a group called the Second Virginia Regiment that held re-enactment battles with other Civil War units at Big Oak Ranch in El Cajon , &quot; he says . When he moved to Los Angeles in the mid-80s , he began re-enacting battles with friends using miniatures of soldiers he created . Phenow showed some of the miniatures to Marge O ' Brien , the Drum Barracks Civil War Museum director in 1990 . Her enthusiasm over his skilled craftsmanship led to the Special Studies in Battles project that Phenow still heads at the museum . &quot; We do battle re-enactments for special groups , but the public is often welcome , &quot; said Phenow , a North Hollywood resident . &quot; If people are interested , they can call the museum to find_out when the next re-enactment will be. &quot; He says everyone is welcome to join the Book Grinders group . &quot; All you have to have is an interest in the Civil War. &quot; The next meeting is at 7 p.m. Tuesday . Jimmy Dunn , a Reseda resident and retired Gas . Co . employee , will be there . Dunn ' s interest in the Civil War started in a dentist ' s Hollywood office in the early 1950s when he was nervously leafing through magazines trying to take his mind off the dreaded drill . An article in a now-forgotten periodical caught his eye and suspended dread for a while as he read that many of the most learned scholars in Britain ' s esteemed universities of Cambridge and Oxford considered the speeches of Abraham_Lincoln to be some of the finest prose ever written in the_English language . &quot; That article led me to start reading Lincoln ' s words and then to want to learn more about the Civil War , Lincoln ' s biggest challenge , &quot; said Dunn . He even named one of his sons Lawrence Lincoln Dunn . Dunn says his studies have led him to many encounters , one of the most interesting with a man he met at the Lincoln Library in Redlands . &quot; I had been sitting reading a treasured old book called &quot; The Letters of a Confederate General , &quot; when I noticed a gentleman looking_at me and the book , &quot; Dunn said . &quot; I asked him if he was interested in looking_at the book when I had finished , and he smiled and said that he would . He told me that he had come all_the way from Cambridge , Mass. , to see it , &quot; Dunn remembers . &quot; Later , over coffee , I learned that he was Samuel Eliot Morison. &quot; The utility company employee and Morison , a renowned naval historian and Harvard scholar , had a good talk , Dunn said . Dunn ' s wife Mary doesn ' t share the same passion , but she is the owner of some Civil War relics , including the dress sword and commission papers of her ancestor , Justin Turner , who fought for the Union . Turner , according to Dunn , was wounded in the battle_of_Gettysburg , and died on a troop train taking him back to his native New York . Another round-table enthusiast is aircraft parts buyer Bill Culver of Valley Village . In 1992 , after inheriting some money , Culver spent several months touring about 40 Civil War battlefields . &quot; For a longtime Civil War buff like me , it was a dream of a lifetime , &quot; says Culver , whose travels took him through much of Virginia , Tennessee , Georgia , Mississippi , the Carolinas and Alabama . &quot; One of the most interesting trips was the Colonial Parkway which links many areas of American history including Williamsburg , Jamestown and Yorktown , where Cornwallis surrendered to the American troops. &quot; He expects memories of that trip to stay with him for a lifetime , and shares brochures and pamphlets from the visit with round-table members . Culver says most of the group members are men , but women have begun to attend too . &quot; I think many of them are interested in learning more about their genealogy . They ' re looking_for relatives who fought in the war , &quot; he says . Parks Event Offers Chance for Stardom If your newest ambition is a part on television ' s &quot; Dr. Quinn , Medicine Woman , &quot; head out_to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area on Sunday between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. There will be a drawing for just such an adventure at the &quot; March for Parks , Head for the_Hills &quot; event sponsored by the National_Park_Service . Everyone who attends will have a chance to win the part by way of a drawing , said Jean Bray of the Park Service . If you just want to take a walk , ride a pony , look_at the exhibits or listen to the stories of Charlie Cook , a chief of the Chumash , that ' s all_right too , Bray said . Proceeds will pay_for bus transportation and on-site naturalist programs for inner_city and local children . The event will be held at Paramount Ranch , where the television_show is taped . Artist to Reveal the ' Nature of Naval Uniform ' We often get news releases from CalArts in Valencia about its much-lauded productions that include all kinds of arts and artworks . But a recent release about Rob Calentine ' s Saturday production called &quot; Suiting a Sailor &quot; has us in the head-scratching mode . It says that &quot; Calentine ' s work will unveil the absolute truth about the homoerotic nature of the naval uniform. &quot; It will be unveiled at 8 p.m. at the Hollywood Moguls Live Theatre-Gallery , should you be inclined to check it out . Study Tour to Follow Tracks of Wild_Horses Ron Wechsler , an associate instructor of animal sciences at Pierce College and a driving force behind the school ' s annual rodeo , has come_up with a new way to entice people to saddle up . Wechsler will be leading a four-day UCLA Extension study tour tracking wild_horses in the Pizona area of Inyo National Forest beginning June 4 . Participants will ride_out by horseback from base camp each day to observe , photograph and examine the social behavior of mustangs . Sissies need not apply . According to Wechsler , the program is limited to 20 participants who will enjoy up_to six hours of riding each day from the Rock Creek Pack Station in Bishop . The adventure costs $ 545 , which includes tuition , instruction , horses , tack , tents and meals . Bring your own chiropractor . The tour coordinator is Herbert London , who owns the Bishop pack station . London has been_active in training government personnel for wilderness packing situations . He says early June is an ideal time to track mustangs . &quot; We ' re apt to see foals at this time , anywhere from one day old on up. &quot; Overheard &quot; I have my new computer , but I can ' t figure_out exactly how to use it . I ' m waiting for my instructor to get home from Little_League practice. &quot;</TEXT>
