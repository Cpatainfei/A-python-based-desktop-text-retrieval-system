   <HEADLINE> GOOD COOKING ; THE BIRDS OF AUGUST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> These waning days of summer pose a challenge in the kitchen . The problem is simple : August . What can possibly be appealing_to cook after a full day of heat ? The following Asian-inspired menu saved the day recently when friends gathered around my table on a sultry evening . The main_course was chicken marinated in an orange-teriyaki sauce and barbecued to a deep-bronze . On the side were fried_rice with summer vegetables and a bold green_salad in a fresh ginger dressing . Both were refreshingly light yet robustly flavored -- and both were made ahead of time during the coolest hours of the day . For dessert , fragrant peaches were tossed_in a simple mix of vanilla , lemon_juice , orange_zest and sugar . CRUNCHY GREEN_SALAD WITH FRESH GINGER DRESSING 6 cups iceberg_lettuce , cut_into 1 1 / 2-inch cubes 3 cups watercress leaves 1 1 / 2 cups radish sprouts , top only Ginger Dressing Combine lettuce , watercress leaves and radish sprouts in large bowl and refrigerate until well chilled and crisp . To serve , toss chilled salad with Ginger Dressing to coat evenly . Adjust seasoning . Divide between 6 chilled salad_plates . Serve immediately . Makes 6 servings . Each serving , with dressing , contains about : 161 calories ; 317 mg sodium ; trace cholesterol ; 15 grams fat ; 6 grams carbohydrates ; 2 grams protein ; 1.22 grams fiber . Ginger Dressing 3 tablespoons peeled , minced ginger root 1 tablespoon sesame_oil 1 tablespoon paprika ( preferably Hungarian ) 1 tablespoon sugar 1 / 4 cup rice vinegar 1 / 3 cup peanut_oil 3 / 4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground pepper Mix ginger , sesame_oil , paprika , sugar , rice vinegar , peanut_oil , salt and black_pepper to taste in food_processor fitted with metal blade or blender until ingredients are well-blended . Can be made day ahead and refrigerated . Let come_to room_temperature before using . * This colorful rice dish is tasty whether it ' s served hot , at room_temperature or chilled . It ' s essential to use chilled cooked rice for the best texture . FRIED RICE WITH COLORFUL VEGETABLES 2 large eggs 1 1 / 4 teaspoons salt 2 tablespoons peanut_oil 1 tablespoon sesame_oil 3 cups chilled cooked rice 2 large cloves garlic , minced 1 cup julienned carrots 1 cup corn cut_off cob , about 1 large ear 1 cup thinly sliced green_onions 1 cup frozen tiny peas 3 tablespoons rice vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon light soy_sauce Red_pepper flakes Whisk together eggs and 1 / 4 teaspoon salt .

But if you ' re watching your fat intake , skinless chicken_breasts also grill successfully . To substitute chicken_breasts , put them between two sheets of plastic_wrap and gently flatten with a meat mallet until they are uniform in thickness , then marinate them . Cook five minutes or less over a hot fire , turning them once . Brush_on the reserved marinade as indicated for the hens . ASIAN ROASTED CHICKENS 1 / 2 cup lite teriyaki sauce 3 tablespoons peanut_oil 1 / 4 cup thawed frozen_orange_juice concentrate 4 large cloves garlic , minced 2 ( 3-pound ) chickens Salt Freshly ground pepper Combine teriyaki sauce , peanut_oil , orange_juice concentrate and garlic in small bowl .
