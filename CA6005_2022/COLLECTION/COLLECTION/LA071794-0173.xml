   <HEADLINE> ARCHEOLOGISTS SEARCH HIGH FOR AIR DISASTER CLUES ; AVIATION : CLUB_MEMBERS GO THROUGH ARCHIVES AND COMB SITES TO LEARN THE DRAMA AND DETAILS OF CRASHES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Hank Peterson and Doug Wyman were teen-agers in 1954 , they were spellbound by the news of a spectacular airplane crash , the stuff movies are made of . It took 45 hours to find the wreckage of the Northeast Airlines DC-3 in the mountains of New Hampshire that winter . There was death and survival , a heroic flight_attendant , a cryptic radio message and a dramatic rescue by helicopter . Thirty years later , the two set_out on what became a painstaking search for the crash site . Thus was born the Aviation Archaeology Club of New Hampshire , one of only a_few such clubs in the country . Aviation archeologists can be motivated by goals as lofty as looking_for history or as mundane as escaping weekend yard chores . Lawrence Webster , 47 , of Shannock , R.I. , a mechanical design engineer who calls himself &quot; an aviation archeologist-lunatic , &quot; says New England has a smattering of such groups , some more formal than others . New Jersey , Virginia , North Carolina , Colorado and California all have a_few groups and individuals who search for plane wreckage , he said . &quot; Some like to restore antique planes , others just like the recreation part of it , &quot; Webster said . Formal organizations are rare , though , he said . &quot; The air museums and the industry like to avoid us because we ' re a reminder that people die when airplanes crash. &quot; Webster has extensive computer_files of New England crashes going_back to the 1908 crash of &quot; an airship , &quot; probably a balloon , at a fair in Waterville , Me . The operator , C.O. Jones , was killed . His records indicate that the first airplane flight in New England produced the region ' s first crash , &quot; a hard landing on ice &quot; in Essex , Mass . Webster , who also belongs_to several Rhode Island and Connecticut aviation groups , is concentrating_on restoring a World_War_II Navy Grumman Hellcat fighter that crashed off Martha ' s Vineyard in 1945 and was retrieved from the Atlantic last year . One of the few organized clubs is the Maine Aviation Historical Society , a nonprofit group whose objective is to chronicle &quot; anything dealing with Maine and aviation , from postcards to restored airplanes , &quot; said Leo Boyle , president of the society . For years , Boyle of Westbrook , Me. , has searched for evidence of L ' Oiseau Blanc , the White Bird , a seaplane two Frenchmen set_out to fly across the Atlantic from Paris to New York a_few weeks before Charles Lindbergh made his historic New York-to-Paris solo flight in 1927 . Boyle , 67 , is convinced that the legendary plane , which Lindbergh himself called the &quot; White Ghost , &quot; crashed in the mountains of Maine . Peterson and Wyman have a less scholarly bent . Their fascination with the 1954 DC-3 crash 13 miles from the Berlin airport was rekindled periodically . &quot; ' My God , it ' s still there ! ' &quot; Peterson recalls telling Wyman once after seeing a picture of the wreckage in a newspaper anniversary story . The plane crashed just below the summit of 3 # 570-foot Mt . Success . &quot; ' Another 100 feet and they would have made_it , ' &quot; Wyman said . Two of the seven people aboard were killed ; a flight_attendant heroically tended to the wounded . The two resolved to act one day in the early 1980s as they were returning home to Concord from a hike in the White Mountains . &quot; ' Remember that DC-3 crash when we were kids on Mt . Success ? , ' &quot; Wyman , 54 , recalls asking . &quot; ' Let ' s go find it. ' &quot; Wyman , a police_lieutenant at the time , spent days at the state library and state archives doing research . &quot; It took us three or four trips and we couldn ' t find it , &quot; he said , although the wreckage was only 100 yards from a hiking trail . Determined , they kept searching . Finally , with the help of a game_warden , they found what they were looking_for in 1982 . Of the 31 serious crashes in New Hampshire recorded in various state and federal archives since the mid-1940s , the club ' s members have visited and inspected 18 . &quot; We don ' t bother with the accidents that were little more severe than rough landings in cow pastures , &quot; said Nick Wallner , 47 , head of a travel_agency branch in Concord and the club ' s historian and chief researcher . The club ' s work is recognized and cited by the state Aeronautics Commission . The four members ( a fifth died last year ) carry a letter from the agency asking landowners to allow them access . &quot; I think they have a wonderful time and are very helpful to us , &quot; said Rick Bolin , a commission inspector . Bolin said information the club has collected on crash sites has helped planes making air-to-ground searches ignore wreckage from previous crashes . Club_members can describe details not only about the planes , but their pilots and passengers , their occupations , destinations , who was drunk or off-course , whose flying license had been suspended , which plane was stolen . They can tell a heart-rending story of three men who died on Mt . Kearsarge after their plane crashed on Aug . 19 , 1960 . The pilot was found in the wreck ; a second victim was found 70 feet away . The third , Oliver Newcomb , was found along a brook more_than a mile away . He had fashioned a small flag from his shirt to mark the spot and left a farewell message to his family on the back of a credit_card . Dr. Ralph Miller and Dr. Robert Quinn , whose plane crashed on Feb . 21 , 1959 , in a snowstorm in Lincoln , survived for four days in subzero weather . They wrote messages on the plane ' s upholstery . They tried to get_out of the wilderness on makeshift snowshoes and managed to build a campfire before they died . Even with topographical maps and compasses , finding wrecks can be difficult . One of the most frustrating searches was in Waterville Valley , Wallner said . &quot; We found it literally when I stepped onto the tire . I ' ve been back four times and know the exact heading -- 143 degrees off Jennings Peak -- and I haven ' t been able to find it again . If you ' re off by five yards , you can miss it because the terrain is so overgrown. &quot; For that reason , the club is trying to get a $ 400 GPS ( global positioning satellite ) finder that can find any spot on Earth within 50 feet . Wallner compares the club ' s work to searching for sunken treasure in the ocean , &quot; except that ours is two-dimensional and a lot less expensive. &quot; Lost treasure is part of the lore of the Parker Mountain crash of an amphibian Grumman in Center Strafford on May 6 , 1946 , that took the lives of three people , including a Columbus , Ohio , industrialist . &quot; Supposedly the plane had a box of jewels on it , and when that rumor got_out , everybody from Rochester and Center Strafford went_up that mountain looking_for those jewels , &quot; Wyman said . &quot; Of course there was no jewel box , which later was found in a safe in a New York City hotel. &quot;</TEXT>
