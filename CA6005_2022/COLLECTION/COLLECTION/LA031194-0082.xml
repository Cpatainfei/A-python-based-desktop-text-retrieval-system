   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON : THE GAUL TO HELP GAIN ENTREE TO EUROPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After being excluded from the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last year , Hollywood may have finally found a sympathetic ear within the protectionist-minded French government . Bernard Miyet , a former French consul general in Los Angeles with friends in high places in Hollywood , has emerged as a key figure in discussions over the industry ' s access to European markets . He quietly met with the American Film Marketing Assn . in Los Angeles last week , then traveled_to Washington on Wednesday for follow-up talks with Motion_Picture Assn . of America President Jack Valenti . Both groups said Miyet came_off as a conciliator who favors a more open discussion between Hollywood and the European Union , formerly known as the European Community . &quot; He said that it ' s time to put the antagonism behind us and see if we can find some way into the future that all sides find agreeable , &quot; Valenti said Thursday when asked about the meeting . While Miyet has no formal role in the_French government , he ' s known as a close associate of Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur , for whom he served as a special emissary during the GATT discussions . As a consul general based in Los Angeles until 1989 , Miyet also got_to know his share of moguls . Valenti called Miyet , who speaks fluent English , an &quot; old friend. &quot; While Valenti cautioned that it ' s too soon to say what will come of the talks , he added that Miyet &quot; clearly has the ear of important people &quot; in Europe . &quot; I don ' t know whether he ' s coming under instructions or not , but he is certainly well regarded there , &quot; Valenti said . Hollywood has been grappling with its future in Europe since December , when it was excluded from the GATT agreement at the 11th hour . The French are the strongest advocates for increasing quotas and fees on Hollywood films and TV_shows , but exhibitors and filmmakers in other European_countries have also taken_up the battle_cry . Last month , European Union audiovisual commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro turned_up the heat another notch by calling_for the dismantling of United International Pictures , a major distributor of Hollywood films overseas . Pinheiro later said he was open_to discussing the issue further . Meanwhile , his group is working to complete a set of broader policy recommendations . If those recommendations are too Draconian , one executive suggested Thursday , Hollywood could retaliate by boycotting the Cannes Film Festival in May . While Cannes caters to the worldwide film community , Hollywood has traditionally provided its glitz and cachet . No matter how radical the sanctions appear to be , however , most industry sources consider any type of formal boycott unlikely , because Hollywood derives considerable benefit from the international exposure Cannes offers . No studio has made a major commitment to the festival yet , but stay tuned . Organizers next month will announce who ' s participating . * Forget about a Range Rover , a window_seat at Locanda Veneta or a cellular_telephone with call_waiting . The latest status symbol in Hollywood is a meeting with Sumner Redstone . Rumors had the incoming Paramount Communications leader in talks with everyone short of Elvis during his victory tour of Los Angeles this week , which included a stopover in Las Vegas for the NATO / Showest convention . While much of what went_on was ceremonial , sources say Redstone also conducted some actual business during his mad dash through the corridors of power . On Wednesday , he lunched with MCA Chairman Lew R . Wasserman and President Sidney J . Sheinberg . The wide-ranging discussion is said to have touched_on everything from Redstone ' s new role in Hollywood to the disposition of the USA Network , the valuable cable network that is co-owned by Paramount and MCA and which may now be bought by one or the other . Others who met with Redstone , and / or his chief_executive , Frank Biondi , over the course of the week reportedly included Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg , Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael Ovitz , MGM / UA Chairman Frank Mancuso , International Creative Management Chairman Jeff Berg , Castle Rock Entertainment Chairman Alan Horn and Jonathan Dolgen , president of Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion_Picture Group . Sources said Redstone and Biondi repeatedly stressed their support for Paramount Pictures Chief Sherry Lansing during the meetings . At the same time , the two said they still intend to hire a business_executive to oversee film and TV operations at the studio . That job was previously handled by Stanley Jaffe , the outgoing Paramount Communications president . Among those casually mentioned for the post : Dolgen , HBO Chief Michael Fuchs , CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky and Time Warner International executive Arthur R . Barron . * Speaking of Katzenberg , he wins the man of the people award of the week for flying coach on Southwest Airlines to the NATO / Showest convention Tuesday . Katzenberg turned a lot of heads when he ambled onto the $ 30 one-way flight from Burbank to Las Vegas . The Disney chief was there for the studio ' s live stage show and tent party , which attracted roughly 4 # 000 people and created a lot of positive buzz for Disney ' s upcoming animated feature , &quot; The Lion King. &quot;</TEXT>
