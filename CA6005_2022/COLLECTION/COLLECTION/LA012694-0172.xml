   <HEADLINE> THE STATE OF THE UNION ; THE PRESIDENT ' S PRIORITIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The objectives outlined in President Clinton ' s State of the Union speech conflict with ever-more-restrictive budget constraints . In his 1995 budget , Clinton will ask_for roughly $ 16 billion to finance new domestic initiatives -- slightly more_than half of the $ 29 billion he originally planned to request from Congress . But just to receive $ 16 billion -- an 18 % increase over last year ' s investment agenda outlays -- Clinton must reduce spending in &quot; non-priority &quot; programs . So far , the Administration has not disclosed a full list of winners and losers in the 1995 budget he will present to Congress on Feb . 7 . But a partial list of those already divulged indicates the direction the Clinton agenda will take this year . WINNERS * EDUCATION -- The largest increase in the education budget will go_to Clinton ' s Goals 2000 program , which is slated to receive $ 600 million to $ 700 million in funding . The initiative is designed to create national academic and skills standards for elementary and secondary_schools . * EMPLOYMENT -- Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich plans to unveil a training-and-skills agenda to help U.S. workers remain competitive in the global economy . It will be highlighted by an initiative to transform the unemployment system into a &quot; re-employment system , &quot; with the long-term unemployed receiving educational and training opportunities . * HEALTH AND WELFARE -- A big beneficiary within the Department of Health and Human Services is the National Institutes of Health , which will get a 4.7 % funding hike . Others include the Head_Start program , targeted for an increase of $ 550 million to $ 1 billion ; AIDS research , including funding for the Ryan White Act , and the WIC nutrition program for pregnant women and infants . * LAW_ENFORCEMENT -- Among the short_list of winners in the battle for scarce federal dollars are the Justice_Department and crime prevention programs . To fund an anti-crime bill expected to pass Congress soon , the Administration has allocated an extra $ 2.5 billion for 1995 to help put 100 # 000 more police_officers on the streets , provide money for &quot; boot camps , &quot; and finance prison construction . Over five years , the Administration plans to spend about $ 22 billion on anti-crime initiatives . * COMMERCE -- For the first time in memory , the Commerce_Department has become a top priority at the White_House . The Administration plans a 12 % increase in the department ' s budget_for 1995 , primarily to help fund new technology initiatives . One of the biggest beneficiaries is the Advanced Technology Program , an initiative to re-create the Pentagon ' s success in fostering technological research and development on the civilian side . It would receive about $ 451 million in 1995 , up from $ 190 million . LOSERS * HOUSING -- The Department of Housing and Urban Development appears to be an unexpected casualty of the White_House budget wars . The Administration is imposing new cuts on HUD that rival those of its Republican predecessors . For example , the Administration plans to cut programs for renovating and building traditional public housing by about $ 2 billion . Clinton is targeting_programs that fund construction of new public housing units and renovate old ones . On the positive side of the ledger , programs for the homeless are expected to get a boost of about $ 1.5 billion . * AGRICULTURE -- Another big loser in the Clinton budget is the Agriculture_Department , which was a major target of the Administration ' s &quot; reinventing government &quot; task_force . The 1995 budget will include a plan to close more_than 1 # 200 farm program field offices . * DEFENSE -- The biggest blow of all will land at the Defense_Department , which is feeling the effects of the end of the Cold_War . Clinton decided not to give the Pentagon $ 21 billion to cover the anticipated costs of inflation over the next five years , and he told defense officials they must fund $ 9 billion in military pay raises over that period by taking money from other accounts . * TRANSPORTATION -- The Transportation Department fought_off steep budget_cuts proposed by the Office of Management and Budget , but the Administration still plans to cut operating subsidies for mass transit systems . The Federal Aviation Administration will see its budget frozen at 1994 levels . * INTERIOR -- Faced with steep budget_cuts , the Interior_Department will eliminate 860 jobs in its personnel division alone . Similar personnel cuts will be felt at a wide range of other agencies , ranging from Veterans Affairs to the Treasury . The Administration ' s proposal to provide $ 6.6 billion in emergency aid for earthquake-ravaged Southern California will not count against the budget ceilings , and therefore will not reduce the amount available for other Clinton priorities .</TEXT>
