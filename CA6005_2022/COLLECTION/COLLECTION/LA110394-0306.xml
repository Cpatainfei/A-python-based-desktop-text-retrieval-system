   <HEADLINE> RESIDENTS ANGERED BY COTO DE CAZA MOB ATTACK ; INQUIRY : SHERIFF ' S OFFICERS WILL INTERVIEW 5 TEENS ABOUT ASSAULTS ON 2 MEN . NEIGHBORS MEET TO DEMAND ARRESTS AND POLICE PROTECTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Incensed by the brutal Halloween night attack by a mob of teen-agers on two of their neighbors , more_than 100 residents of this exclusive , gated community gathered Wednesday to demand better police protection and the arrests of the attackers . &quot; I am in a cold rage , &quot; Ron Greek , co-chairman of the Coto Citizens Advisory Council , a residents ' group , told the standing-room-only crowd at the Coto Valley Country_Club . &quot; We ' ve played ostrich out here too long , thinking that we had a pristine community free_of urban problems . We ' re going to pursue this until the perpetrators are prosecuted to the full extent of the law ; we ' re going to make an example of them so that this will never happen again. &quot; The meeting had been called_in response to separate attacks Monday night on race_car driver Rocky Moran , 44 , and attorney Bernard Moran ( no relation ) , 45 , who live_in the gated community . Rocky Moran sustained a dislocated shoulder , while Bernard Moran is nursing a broken rib , broken ankle , two battered knees , bruised hips and a black_eye . The two men , both over 6 feet tall and 200 pounds , confronted the youths who were blocking their cars as the men tried to ferry their own children home from trick-or-treating . Speaking_for the Orange County Sheriff ' s Department , Lt . Bob NeSmith told the residents Wednesday that six investigators and a sergeant had been assigned to the case full time . &quot; This is a serious situation , &quot; he said . &quot; This community is running amok with people doing whatever they want to be doing . The Sheriff ' s Department takes this very seriously. &quot; As of Wednesday night , he said , sheriff ' s investigators had identified five teen-agers they plan to question about the violence . Those deemed responsible , he said , could be charged with felony assault or assault with a deadly weapon . Eventually , NeSmith said , investigators plan to talk to as_many members of the teen-age mob , which he estimated at 100 , as possible . &quot; These are kids who live here , &quot; he said . &quot; A hundred kids just didn ' t jump over the fence. &quot; Some residents said Wednesday that teen-age belligerence is a longstanding problem in the community . &quot; It ' s like we ' re held hostage in here , &quot; said one , who did not want to be identified for fear of retribution . &quot; I feel_like I ' m living_in Cuba or Russia. &quot; Said another , who also did not want to be identified : &quot; My reaction was one of horror , but not surprise . . . . The kids who live here have done damage to this golf_course many , many times. &quot; Resident Marsha Lassen , 48 , said she believed that many of the youths who participated in the attack lived_in the community , where houses sell for up_to $ 10 million , or opened the gates to those who didn ' t . &quot; My reaction is one of grave disappointment , &quot; Lassen said . &quot; But you know , I thought it was bound to happen sooner or later . Here we are , living_in this community that we moved to because we longed to be safe , and now , we aren ' t . You know what can be done about this ? Nothing . Because none of these parents will do anything about it. &quot; Karen Barkovitz , who does not live_in the community but plays golf at its course , said earlier Wednesday : &quot; You know what the problem is now ? These kids are too rich and too spoiled to know better , and that ' s their parents ' fault . Had my son attacked an adult , he never would have heard the end of it. &quot; Bernard Moran was still angry almost 48 hours after the attack as he sat in his living room Wednesday afternoon nursing a wounded body and numerous swollen joints . Getting_up from his chair , he could barely walk . A broken rib didn ' t make_it easier . &quot; The worst thing they could do now would be to come_after me or my family . I want them to know : That will not be a good thing. &quot; Bernard Moran said his memory of the attack is hazy . But he remembers being attacked by at least nine rock-wielding teen-agers , who took offense to Moran confronting them for blocking the street and then &quot; smashed me with a combination of fists and rocks. &quot; &quot; If these kids want to play in an adult world , they ' re going to have to take adult responsibility , &quot; said Moran , who has not ruled_out taking legal_action against the parents of the teens . He said the attack lasted about a minute &quot; that felt_like four hours &quot; and was witnessed by &quot; dozens &quot; of other residents , most of whom were &quot; terrified mothers taking their little ones home from trick-or-treating. &quot; He said the mob was composed of males and females but that he was attacked only by males . He said his 13-year-old daughter had heard students at the Santa Margarita intermediate school brag about the attack . Rocky Moran , who along with Bernard Moran recounted his ordeal for the rapt audience Wednesday night with one arm in a sling , said , &quot; It was a melee . They just pummeled me. &quot;</TEXT>
