   <TEXT> A bomb exploded in a prayer room at Iraq ' s Ministry of Religious Affairs on Wednesday , killing a senior civil_servant and seriously injuring five people . No one claimed responsibility , and official media reports did not identify any specific group . But the official Iraqi news_agency INA said the bomb was locally made . Iraqi television blamed &quot; agents hired by the enemies of Iraq , &quot; usually considered to be a reference_to Kurdish separatists or Iranian-linked Shiite Muslim rebels . Baghdad residents said the explosion , in the northern district of Bab al Moaddam , sent plumes of smoke over the city . Streets near the building were littered with glass and stained with blood . TV images showed the frame of the aluminum ceiling collapsed into the wreckage of broken glass and desks . The force of the blast bent ceiling fans and cracked concrete walls . The morning explosion was first reported by Shebab ( Youth ) television , run_by President Saddam Hussein ' s son , Uday . INA carried the news hours later and named the dead man as Attallah Mohammed Saleh , a director general in the ministry . Civil defense sources told the agency that six pounds of dynamite smuggled into the building wrecked a prayer section and damaged ministry annexes . Earlier reports on Shebab channel said nearby houses were also damaged . There has been a string of bombings over the last two years as U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq ' s August , 1990 , invasion of Kuwait throttled the country ' s economy . One person was killed and three people were wounded in similar blasts in Baghdad in the past year . The last such attack was Aug . 22 , when a booby-trapped car exploded outside the state-run Al Jumhuriyah newspaper office , causing no injuries . Not all these attacks have been reported by the official media as the government has sought to play_down public discontent . Iraq has accused Iranian government_agents of staging previous bombings . Wednesday ' s blast coincided with reports that Iranian troops had attacked an anti-Tehran guerrilla base inside Iraq . The Moujahedeen Khalq , an Iranian opposition group , said Wednesday that Iranian troops had attacked the main base of its guerrilla army inside Iraq just after midnight . The soldiers fled when the guerrillas returned fire , the Moujahedeen said , adding that there were no casualties . The attack , if confirmed , would be the first Iranian cross-border raid since May , 1993 .</TEXT>
