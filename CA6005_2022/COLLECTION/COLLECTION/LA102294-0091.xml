   <HEADLINE> CLINTON TO SIGN SCHOOL GUN CURB IN CALIF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton will visit a troubled Bay Area high_school today to dramatize his tough stance on school violence by signing an order that requires a cut-off of federal school aid to districts that do not expel gun-carrying pupils . A $ 12.7-billion federal education aid bill signed Thursday by Clinton orders states to require expulsions of gun-carrying students . But the law specifies no penalty for districts that fail to carry_out those policies and Clinton_Administration officials fear that , without specific sanctions , some school districts may drag their feet in complying . The signing will come_in a one-day swing that is Clinton ' s first visit to California in five months and that will bring him together with his party ' s most visible -- and embattled -- California candidates , Sen . Dianne Feinstein and gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown . Clinton will appear with Feinstein at Carlmont High_School in Belmont and later is to attend an evening fund-raiser for Brown in San Francisco . The school-violence directive continues a recent series of campaign-season events in which Clinton has tried to emphasize his concern about education and crime -- two issues that the polls show are now foremost on voters ' minds . Clinton talked Monday to a police_chiefs convention on youth crime and three days later signed the schools bill in a ceremony in Framingham , Mass. , with Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) . Carlmont High was chosen for today ' s event because it plays to what is considered to be one of Feinstein ' s stronger issues . She was co-sponsor of the law requiring expulsion of pupils who bring firearms to school . Feinstein sought to add language to the bill that explicitly would have cut_off federal aid to districts that failed to comply . The clause was cut_out as House-Senate conferees reconciled differing versions of the legislation , but its removal did not mean that the government was barred from imposing the sanctions administratively through the Department_of_Education , as Clinton ' s order will do . Many districts are moving toward stiffer penalties for students who bring guns to classes . But only California and Michigan so far have the blanket expulsion rules , called &quot; zero tolerance &quot; policies , according to the Children ' s Defense Fund . About one in 20 high_school students carries a gun to school , according to a 1990 survey by the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention . And Clinton is expected to point_out in his remarks today that two children are killed with guns in California every day . &quot; The single most important thing we can do to improve education for everyone in this country is to make schools safe , &quot; according to a draft of Clinton ' s prepared remarks . Clinton ' s appearance will put him in the midst of a cross-fire , which began before he had even left Washington . Rep . Mike Huffington ( R-Santa Barbara ) , who as Feinstein ' s opponent has played_up her ties to Clinton , sought to turn the tables on the visit . &quot; I sent him a free ticket to come_out to California , &quot; Huffington said in an interview . &quot; He wants to keep Feinstein in office so that , when he wants to raise taxes again or have a government controlled health_care plan , he has somebody to support him. &quot; For her part , Feinstein insisted that she does not believe Clinton ' s popularity has declined in California . &quot; And I ' m really very proud he is going_to sign this executive order tomorrow and I ' m proud to be with him when he does_it , &quot; she said . A recent Los Angeles Times Poll showed that Clinton ' s approval rating had risen to 49 % in California , making the electorally crucial state one in which his support is strongest . Times staff writer David Lesher in Los Angeles contributed to this story .</TEXT>
