   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; DISPUTES ABOUT ARISTIDE ADD TO DILEMMA ON HAITI ; CARIBBEAN : SOME SEE OUSTED LEADER AS PROPHET , OTHERS AS MADMAN . CONTROVERSY COMPLICATES U.S. POLICY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To his most devoted followers , he is a latter-day Old_Testament prophet whose jeremiads against the mistreatment of Haiti ' s long-suffering poor bring_down the wrath of the Establishment , religious as well as secular . To his severest detractors , he is a political radical and a madman . Now , almost three years after the bloody military coup that drove him from the presidency of Haiti , Jean-Bertrand Aristide has become a living symbol of his country ' s brief experiment with democracy -- and of one of President Clinton ' s most difficult foreign_policy conundrums . Under a U.N. Security_Council resolution adopted July 31 , Clinton has the authority -- should he decide to use it -- to invade Haiti and clear the way for Aristide to return to the presidential palace that he left in handcuffs Sept . 30 , 1991 . So far , Clinton has put his faith in economic sanctions to drive_out Haiti ' s military_leaders . His reluctance to use force is described by Administration officials as prudence and derided by Aristide ' s supporters as an indication that the President is less than serious about his own policy toward an impoverished island republic with a mostly black population . In defending the Administration ' s effort to oust Haiti ' s military dictators by whatever means , Clinton emphasizes traditional U.S. support for democracy . The growth of free societies throughout Latin_America , he argues , is a fragile process that must be nurtured and protected as a matter of U.S. national interest . And he maintains that the unbuttoned brutality of the present military regime sows instability -- including waves of impoverished refugees -- in a region too close to the United States to ignore . But the question of whether to risk the lives of U.S. troops to restore Aristide to power cannot be divorced from another puzzle : the complex , mystifying and often-irritating personality of the 41-year-old Roman_Catholic priest himself . In fact , Aristide is not a politician at all but a theologian who had spent years scorning politics and politicians from the pulpit . Drawing something bordering_on adoration from Haiti ' s impoverished masses , he captured two of every three votes_in what is generally regarded_as the only free and fair election in Haiti ' s history . His personality is immersed in mythology -- some of it clearly of_his_own making . In both Haiti and the United States , people love him or hate him , with very few falling_in between . After surviving for almost a decade as an anti-Establishment firebrand in a country that is among the world ' s leaders in per-capita political killings , Aristide has developed an aura of immortality . In a 1985 incident that forms a central part of the Aristide mystique , the future president delivered a stinging denunciation of the Jean-Claude ( Baby Doc ) Duvalier dictatorship from the pulpit of the cathedral of Port-au-Prince , near the presidential palace . Later , a man suddenly appeared in the church and pointed a pistol at Aristide from close range . For a_few seconds the men stared at each other . Then the gunman opened his revolver , removed the bullets and handed both to the priest . To Aristide ' s supporters , it was a miracle . On Sept . 11 , 1988 , thugs , almost certainly dispatched by the dictator of the day , Lt . Gen . Henri Namphy , burned_down Aristide ' s church and killed at least 12 parishioners . But Aristide escaped . Between assassination attempts , Aristide preached a social gospel , emphasizing the Bible ' s warnings against mistreatment of the poor . With his words circulated on audiocassettes , he developed a devoted following in the slums of Port-au-Prince and across the impoverished countryside . But as Aristide ' s reputation grew among the poor , Haiti ' s well-to-do elite reacted to him with fear and hatred . To the wealthy , he was a radical , a Communist and a menace . And the upper_classes were terrified by passages in some of his speeches that seemed to be calls_for mob justice . The Catholic hierarchy joined the elite in its opposition to Aristide . Shortly after the 1988 fire that destroyed his church , Aristide was suspended by the Salesian Order , which accused him of fomenting class_struggle . Not all_of the questions about Aristide , however , can be dismissed as politically motivated . He is known to be subject_to wide mood swings , cited by detractors as evidence of madness . After his church was destroyed and he was stripped of his priestly duties , for example , a depressed Aristide disappeared from public view for a considerable period_of_time . But to one supporter , &quot; depression was the only sane reaction &quot; to such a series of reversals . To neutral U.S. observers , Aristide clearly comes_off as eccentric . But judged from his conduct in office and later in exile , he seems to be at least as capable as_many of today ' s political_leaders . If the Cold_War were still on , Aristide ' s speeches -- at least those he delivered before his election -- would have given U.S. policy-makers the willies . But as president , his policies were far more moderate than his rhetoric might have suggested . And , with communism in retreat around the world , Aristide ' s words seem less threatening than they once might have . If it is U.S. policy to support democracy around the globe , it can hardly turn_away from Aristide , who won a greater share of the popular vote_in Haiti than , for example , any U.S. President since James_Monroe , the nation ' s fifth . Moreover , Aristide ' s return to power would certainly stem the unwelcome flow of Haitian refugees to the United States , most of whom are Aristide supporters facing repression by the military government . If Aristide regains power , it seems inevitable that some of his supporters will try to even scores with the military and the Haitian elite . A blood bath could be a severe embarrassment to the Administration . But during Aristide ' s brief tenure , human_rights violations fell far below the bloody Haitian standard established during earlier regimes , so there is reason to believe that retaliation can be kept_in check . Since Aristide was deposed , he has been biding his time in exile , living_in a modern Washington apartment_building and waiting for the United States to restore democracy to an island nation that has known only seven months of it in 190 years . Asked if he wants to return to office behind U.S. bayonets , Aristide usually says the Haitian constitution prohibits him from advocating foreign intervention . But then he says the Haitian people want to regain democracy regardless of the method , so it is up_to the international community to decide on the means . Sometimes he seems to rule_out U.S. military_action , while at other times he seems to encourage it . The ambiguity of his position seems to be carefully crafted . But it leads to widespread misunderstanding and tends to undercut his own supporters . There is some irony to Aristide ' s reliance on the support of the United States . He used to denounce &quot; the cold country to the north &quot; and blame it for most of Haiti ' s woes , from the grinding poverty to a constant succession of dictators . In the years that preceded his election , Aristide ' s rhetoric was often anti-American . Critics on Capitol_Hill such_as Sen . Jesse Helms ( R-N.C. ) frequently quote Aristide ' s verbal excesses as evidence that he is not a person Washington should help or trust . While in office and later in exile , however , Aristide softened his criticism of U.S. policy . Randall Robinson , executive_director of the TransAfrica think_tank and a devoted Aristide supporter who earlier this year staged a hunger_strike on his behalf , says Aristide ' s rhetoric was understandable in light of U.S. involvement in Haitian history , which includes an invasion and a 19-year occupation starting in 1915 . &quot; It is not surprising that sane people representing the poor in Haiti would use rhetoric that might sound to Americans to be anti-American , &quot; Robinson said . &quot; If this Administration succeeds in restoring democracy in Haiti , that , for the first time , puts a new page in this book . I would assume that on that occasion , President Aristide would respond differently. &quot; The George_Bush Administration clearly was displeased by Aristide ' s election victory , unenthusiastic about him in office and , following his ouster , ambivalent in its support for his restoration . Although the Administration voted for a resolution in the Organization of American_States denouncing the coup , Bush did nothing to reverse it . Clinton has been far more outspoken in his support of Aristide ' s cause . But Lawrence A . Pezzullo , the veteran diplomat who coordinated the Administration ' s Haiti policy until he resigned April 22 , has become increasingly critical of Aristide . &quot; He was catapulted into the presidency and formed a mediocre and partisan government , &quot; Pezzullo said . &quot; He didn ' t understand the governing process , and the people around him didn ' t either . You need a man of tremendous skill to put_together a reform program . He couldn ' t do that . If you talk to him about programs , he is bereft_of any concept of policy. &quot; But it misses the point to regard Aristide as a conventional politician . After years of heaping scorn on politics and politicians from the pulpit , Aristide entered the 1990 election at the last minute and swept to victory on votes of the impoverished masses . It was the first time the poor had been given a fair shot at the ballot_box , and they made the most of it . In office , Aristide tried to pare Haiti ' s bloated public payroll , and he cooperated with an International Monetary Fund austerity program that had drawn complaints from leftist political_parties . His administration was stifled from the start by political gridlock in Parliament . U.S. supporters admit that he was unable to enact a single piece of legislation during his seven-month tenure . Pezzullo , who tried without success to pressure Aristide to form an alliance with opposition parliamentarians to broaden his political base , said the ousted president will be unable to govern even if he regains his office . &quot; He never had a majority in the Parliament and it is a parliamentary system , not a presidential system , &quot; Pezzullo said in reference_to the Haitian constitution , which remains theoretically in_force although it is generally ignored by the military government . &quot; What I ' m concerned about is the larger political comity that you develop through the major political activists so you have a coalition government , which is the only way you can govern there . He gives no indication of wanting to develop that. &quot; Burton V . Wides , a Washington lawyer representing Aristide , said the ousted president broke_with parliamentarians who ran with him as part of an electoral coalition over matters of &quot; patronage and pork. &quot; He said Aristide intentionally declined to convert his mass support into a political organization . Since Aristide took_up his exile residence in Washington , he has generated support and opposition almost as emotional as the feelings he produced at_home . For instance , Rep . Joseph Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) first encountered Aristide when he traveled_to Port-au-Prince to attend the inauguration primarily because of the novelty of a democratically elected president in a country that had known little but dictators . &quot; It was one of the most exciting political dramas that I have ever seen , &quot; said Kennedy , whose family knows something about political charisma . &quot; I have seldom seen so many people so united and so excited about a political leader. &quot; But Helms , the North Carolina Republican who has led opposition to Aristide on Capitol_Hill , calls him &quot; a demonstrable killer. &quot; &quot; This cruel man has made fiery speeches exhorting his followers to use the necklace method , as it is called , to destroy his political enemies in agony , &quot; Helms said in reference_to mob execution in which a gasoline-soaked tire is forced over the victim ' s head and shoulders and set_afire . There is no doubt that Aristide made inflammatory speeches that easily can be read as advocating execution by necklace . But the State_Department ' s Human_Rights report shows that political killings and rights violations were far lower during Aristide ' s tenure than they were under the military dictatorships that preceded and followed it .</TEXT>
