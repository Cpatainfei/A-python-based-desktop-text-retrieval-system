   <HEADLINE> IRA SUPPORTERS STEP_UP DEMANDS THAT BRITISH WITHDRAW FROM ULSTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Irish_Republican_Army ' s political wing , Sinn Fein , on Saturday stepped_up demands for a complete British military withdrawal from Northern_Ireland , despite olive_branch offers from Prime_Minister John Major . But politicians and clerics who have contact with armed Protestant extremist groups said they thought Major ' s gestures could help persuade the outlawed groups to join a 17-day-old IRA cease-fire . Sinn Fein supporters staged small protests outside heavily fortified security bases in Belfast , the province ' s capital , and held a march in Londonderry , the second city . &quot; We have come here today to move_on the ( peace ) process and take_back our city . We want an end to the_British army in this city . We want them out of here . . . as soon as possible , &quot; Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness told supporters in Londonderry . In a minor skirmish in Belfast , teen-agers stoning a military base were hosed_down with water by security_forces . The demonstrations went_ahead despite Major ' s announcement Friday that he was lifting a broadcast ban that kept Sinn Fein voices off radio and television for six years . His efforts were aimed at reassuring the majority pro-British Protestant community as well as Roman_Catholics , most of whom want the province united with the rest of Ireland . Major insisted the IRA must still prove it has permanently renounced violence in its war against the_British . But he had a sweetener for Protestants , guaranteeing that the result of future peace talks would be put to a referendum in the province . Many Protestants have welcomed the plan , seeing it as a pledge that they will not be forced_out of their union with Britain against their will . But Sinn Fein wants any referendum to include a vote_in the_Irish Republic . Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds welcomed Britain ' s promise of a referendum on Northern_Ireland . In a television interview in Hong Kong , Reynolds described the referendum announcement as &quot; a considerable contribution toward consolidating and solidifying the peace process. &quot; The British and Irish governments are now waiting to see if loyalist extremists will lay_down their arms . The armed extremists have said they will not match the cease-fire until they are satisfied that the IRA truce is permanent and convinced that the_British government has made no secret deals to dilute Northern_Ireland ' s British status . David Ervine , spokesman for the small Progressive Unionist Party , who speaks with members of the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force , said he thought the extremists would be pleased . &quot; I think if the loyalist paramilitaries are convinced of Northern_Ireland ' s position , guaranteed as a partner within the United Kingdom , then they will lay_down their weapons , &quot; he told British Broadcasting Corp . radio . Meanwhile , the_Irish Times in Dublin said Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams will start a visit to the United States this week . Quoting &quot; reliable &quot; sources in Washington , the newspaper said the Clinton_Administration has lifted a ban on official contacts with Sinn Fein and will be offering Adams a visa .</TEXT>
