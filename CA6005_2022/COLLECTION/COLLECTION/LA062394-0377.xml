   <HEADLINE> 4 OFFICERS FIRED , 1 SUSPENDED OVER PRISON ESCAPE ; CORRECTIONS : INMATE IN OCTOBER INCIDENT WAS CAUGHT QUICKLY . NEW STATE FACILITY HAD BEEN CRITICIZED FOR PERCEIVED LAX SECURITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four correctional officers have been fired and a fifth given a 30-day suspension for allowing a convicted murdered to escape_from the new state_prison in Lancaster last October , interim Warden John Ratelle said Wednesday . Ratelle said he took action against the officers in late May but did not make_it public until a meeting of the prison ' s citizens advisory committee . Committee_members said they were pleased to hear about the punishment . The Oct . 6 escape had triggered a citywide outcry concerning security at the prison , which opened in February , 1993 . Inmate Eric Rene Johnson , 23 , climbed over an eight-foot block wall and two 12-foot chain-link fences , all topped with razor wire , to make his escape . He was recaptured five hours later outside a convenience market in Lancaster , several miles from the prison . Prison officials said no officers would be disciplined until an investigation had been completed . As the months went_by , some local leaders expressed impatience over the delay . At Wednesday ' s meeting , Ratelle said investigators simply determined that the officers were not paying_attention to the prisoner or the fences when Johnson escaped . &quot; I know exactly how it happened , &quot; the warden said . &quot; The inmate saw an opportunity and took it . He saw the staff was lax . that ' s what happened here -- a lack of attentiveness. &quot; Ratelle said he could not identify the disciplined officers because of state privacy laws . The officers had been with the state_Department of Corrections for four to seven years . The officers can appeal their firings to a state board , but they cannot retain their jobs while awaiting the outcome , Ratelle said . He did not know whether any of the officers had filed an appeal . A sixth officer who also was investigated in connection with the breakout received no punishment . Johnson ' s escape angered many residents because at the time the prison was proposed , many city leaders fought it partly because of security concerns . But state officials insisted that escapes were extremely rare . The new prison -- which houses more_than 3 # 000 maximum- and medium-security prisoners -- received a second blow to its reputation in January when another prisoner , serving a life sentence for attempted murder , escaped by hiding inside a garbage_truck . He , too , was recaptured , but a month later state officials removed the prison ' s first warden , Otis Thurman . Ratelle , who has been running the prison since then , said the investigation into the second escape is continuing and that no officers have been disciplined yet . But he said the prison has changed its garbage_collection procedures to reduce the prospects of another such escape . The warden also said an electrified fence , now under construction , will make_it highly unlikely that another inmate can escape the way Johnson did . The electrified fence , which will carry a potentially lethal charge , is expected to be activated at the Lancaster prison in January .</TEXT>
