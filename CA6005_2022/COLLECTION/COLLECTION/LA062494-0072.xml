   <TEXT> Graduation day is drawing_near for thousands of high_school seniors in Ventura County . For seniors and underclassmen alike , it is time for great celebration . Unfortunately , end-of-the-school-year celebrations , such_as graduation , often result in drunk-driving accidents . As we look_to these upcoming graduation ceremonies with pride and pleasure , we must remember to take the time to remind our graduates to have a safe and sober evening . It is also important to make_sure that our children are aware of the lifelong consequences that result from driving under the influence . In 1991 , according to the California Highway Patrol , 66 kids , all at the age of 18 , died as a result of alcohol-related accidents . Twenty-nine of these kids were passengers in the car . That is an almost 50-50 split between the number of deaths for drivers and passengers . So whether you are the driver or the passenger , the odds are not in your favor . Drinking and driving is not a game , and it ' s a sure bet you ' re going to lose if you try to play . As your state representative , I know it is my job to fight for tougher sentences for those who choose to drive drunk . As a father of five children and grandfather of four , I know it is my personal responsibility to educate my family on the damaging effects of this irresponsible behavior . Let ' s all make a conscious effort to make 1994 ' s graduation a safe and sober evening . Congratulations to the graduating class of 1994 , and also to the parents of these bright individuals , for the hard work and determination it takes_to receive a high_school diploma . A special thank_you as well , to all_of the individuals across California who are helping to sponsor Grad Night activities for the youth in our communities . My hat is off to all_of you for making a difference . NAO TAKASUGI Assemblyman , 37th District</TEXT>
