   <HEADLINE> OFFICIAL SAYS EUROPE WILLING TO DO LUNCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An influential European official involved in film and television policy-making assured Hollywood on Tuesday that Europe will be open_to discussions about loosening its restrictive film and television policies . But Joao de Deus Pinheiro also warned that European_countries may impose further &quot; shrewd protectionist measures &quot; unless their moribund entertainment_industry recovers . Pinheiro , European commissioner for culture and audiovisual policy , traced protectionist sentiment that came_to a head in December ' s Geneva trade talks to the poor_shape of Europe ' s film and television production . In the eventual trade agreement reached under the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , Hollywood was unable to get audiovisual issues included -- thus missing an opportunity to have European protectionist measures eased . Some countries , for example , impose quotas on U.S. films broadcast on television . &quot; If the industry picks_up and it is seen as picking_up , then all these measures will fade_away , &quot; Pinheiro predicted . His remarks came during a luncheon speech and news_conference at the American Film Market in Santa Monica . Hollywood gets_about 50 % of its box_office revenue from overseas . Reflecting the seriousness of the issue , many of Hollywood ' s top leaders have been meeting with Pinheiro this week while he is in town . Pinheiro said European Union officials plan to draft a &quot; green paper &quot; on audiovisual issues , although the paper ' s eventual purpose remains vague . &quot; What it means is not to identify remedies , but rather to stir the discussions , &quot; Pinheiro said . Jack Valenti , president of the Motion_Picture Assn . of America , said the trade group has offered its input but hasn ' t been invited to give it yet . &quot; The only thing I hope is that they don ' t make things sterner , tougher and increase the governmental regulatory thicket through which one must pass , &quot; Valenti said . Separately , Pinheiro denied reports that he is out_to lower the boom on United International Pictures , which distributes movies in foreign markets for Universal Pictures , Paramount Pictures and MGM / UA . Reports have quoted Pinheiro as opposing an extension of an antitrust waiver to UIP . He said he was only expressing the widely held view of European business , not his personal opinion .</TEXT>
