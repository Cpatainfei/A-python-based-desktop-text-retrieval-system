   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / SPOTLIGHT ON TAIWAN ; THE TAIWANESE ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taiwan , which in 1991 ended the nearly 43 years of emergency rule that had prevailed since Chiang Kai-shek ' s Kuomintang established a government opposed to the communist takeover of the mainland on the Formosa island in 1949 , has also moved_in recent years to restructure its economy , including decreasing protectionism , increasing foreign investment and allowing Taiwanese businesses to invest abroad . The economy is currently booming , as evident by a string of annual trade surpluses . Taiwan has the world ' s largest foreign currency reserves , now close to $ 90 billion . Labor About 40 % Taiwan ' s 20.6 million people are in the workforce . The government provides free primary and junior_high education and schooling is compulsory for youth aged six to 15 . The adult literacy rate is about 91 % , considerably higher than mainland_China ' s literacy rate of 73 % , but slightly lower than Japan or the United States , which both average at about 98 % . Manufacturing Taiwan ' s major manufactured products are electronics and automobiles . Textile and garment making and toy manufacturing remain significant industries , but because Taiwan ' s wage rates have risen in recent years , jobs in these labor intensive industries have been moving to Asian_nations with lower labor costs , particularly mainland_China . Taiwan exports much of its manufactured output and in recent years has waged a campaign to increase exports of its higher value manufactured goods . Manufacturing accounts_for 40 % of the nation ' s gross_domestic_product . Services Making_up 45 % of Taiwan ' s GDP , the service_industry in Taiwan is expected to grow faster than other sectors in the next few years . Since the government loosened rules on foreign participation in its economy in the early 1980s , international advertising_agencies and foreign management_consultants have been flooding_in . There are more_than 30 foreign banks in Taiwan , but most have only one branch because foreign banks are still restricted to three branches . Transportation In 1991 , the government started a six-year program to improve infrastructure and promote domestic jobs . Foreign companies have been vying aggressively for a part of the program , expecting to cost hundreds of billions of dollars . Most parts of the island are accessible by highway and railway networks . Construction of a mass transit system is underway in Taipei . Because Taiwan lies between two major business travel destinations-Japan and Hong Kong-Taiwan ' s Chiang Kai Shek international airport is increasingly becoming a hub for intra-Pacific air_travel . Agriculture Agriculture -- now 3.5 % of GDP -- has played a lessor role in the economy since 1965 when manufacturing began to boom . However , agriculture is still crucial to Taiwan because of its political situation -- it is only recognized by about 30 countries . Intensive farming , for instance , has made_it self-sufficient in rice . Other major crops include sugar_cane , maize and sweet_potatoes . Trade Taiwan ' s major trading partners are Japan and the United States . The United States , which does not recognize Taiwan as a nation , has been pressuring Taiwan to reduce its huge trade surplus . Fearing , reduced trade with the United States because of approval of the North_America Free_Trade Agreement -- which reduces trade_barriers among the United States , Mexico and Japan -- Taiwain has increased investments in manufacturing in Mexico .
