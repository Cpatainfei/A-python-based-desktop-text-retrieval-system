   <HEADLINE> THEATER NOTES ; WINNING ENTRIES FROM A FULL FIELD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So_much professional theater takes_place in the Los Angeles area that any &quot; best of &quot; list is bound to be unfair , because no one has the time to see even half of what ' s available . I saw 141 performances this year -- all but a handful of them in Los Angeles and Orange counties . That may sound like a lot . But it ' s not even a quarter of the shows that are offered under Actors ' Equity agreements in Southern California during an average year ( final figures for 1994 are not in ) . Caveats aside , I ' m particularly grateful I saw these 1994 shows , in alphabetical order : &quot; Assassins &quot; ( Los Angeles Repertory Theatre at Los Angeles Theatre Center ' s Theatre 4 ) . This Stephen Sondheim / John Weidman musical-comedy about the troubled souls who try to shoot the President moves from little Theatre 4 to a larger LATC hall on Jan . 17 , opening_up a lot more seats ( and more comfortable ones at that ) , all_of which deserve to be filled . &quot; Awake and Sing ! &quot; ( Odyssey Theatre ) . 1994 brought several remarkable revivals of brawling American work from the ' 30s ( &quot; Counsellor-at-Law , &quot; below , and the Blank Theatre ' s &quot; The Cradle Will Rock &quot; ) . But none topped the Odyssey ' s rendition of Clifford Odets ' portrait of a Brooklyn family on the edge of despair . Still playing . &quot; The Collected Plays of Justin Tanner &quot; ( Cast Theatre ) . Justin Tanner emerged in 1994 as L.A. ' s most currently interesting home-grown playwright , thanks to the decision by Cast producer Diana Gibson to stage all eight of his Cast-nurtured comedies in repertory . Still playing . &quot; Counsellor-at-Law &quot; ( Interact Theatre ) . In two dramas from different eras , John Rubinstein played upscale American Jews beset by personal woes in the assimilation process . In the fascinating &quot; Sight Unseen &quot; at the Odyssey , Rubinstein merely replaced another actor . But in Elmer Rice ' s sprawling &quot; Counsellor-at-Law , &quot; he co-directed as well as starred . The result is fairly miraculous -- 24 actors create one memorable characterization after another at this small theater in a residential neighborhood in North Hollywood . Still playing . &quot; Everyman at the Mall &quot; ( Cornerstone Theater at Santa Monica Place ) . Bill Rauch and Shishir Kurup cooked_up the year ' s most inventive staging , using the storefronts and escalators of a shopping_mall to illustrate the anti-materialist theme of this ancient English morality_play . Their multicultural and ecumenical adaptation fits beautifully into the 1990s . &quot; The Glass Menagerie &quot; ( Theatricum Botanicum ) and &quot; A Streetcar Named Desire &quot; ( South Coast Repertory ) . Seeing these sterling productions within a_few days of each other in the late summer more or less settled the question -- for a_few weeks , at least -- of whether Tennessee Williams really was America ' s greatest playwright . Director Heidi Helen Davis ' decision to split the character of Tom in &quot; Menagerie &quot; between two actors worked magnificently . &quot; Green Icebergs &quot; ( South Coast Repertory ) . Cecilia Fannon ' s comedy about the reshuffling of the marital deck for two Orange County couples during an Italian holiday wasn ' t totally credible , but it was giddily entertaining throughout and ultimately made a trenchant moral comment , without being preachy . &quot; House_of_Correction &quot; ( Theatre 40 ) . This welcome revival of Norman Lock ' s biting black comedy about the impossibility of justice moved like a rocket . &quot; Hysteria &quot; ( Actors ' Gang ) . Tracy Young revised her 1992 musical_comedy about women ' s control over their own bodies , and her audacious split-level show was second only to &quot; Assassins &quot; in the provocative musicals sweepstakes . &quot; Life in the Trees &quot; ( Melrose Theatre ) . Catherine Butterfield ' s three one-acts have different characters and casts , but they ' re tied together in a variety of tantalizing and amusing ways to create a whole that ' s greater than the sum of its parts . Mary Lou Belli ' s staging couldn ' t be better . Still playing . &quot; Marvin ' s Room &quot; ( Tiffany Theatre ) . Dennis Erdman directed a funny and heartening production of Scott McPherson ' s comedy about facing death . &quot; Men on the Verge of a His-panic Breakdown &quot; ( Celebration Theatre ) . Guillermo Reyes ' series of monologues about gay Latino immigrants was fired_up by the dynamic and chameleonic performance of Felix A . Pire . &quot; 1940 ' s Radio Hour &quot; ( Actors Co-op at Crossley Theatre ) . Alan Johnson ' s staging of Walton Jones ' warmhearted slice of life is a peerless re-creation of a time and a place . Still playing . &quot; Old Business &quot; ( Court and Coast theaters ) . As a high-powered father and son , Harold Gould and Alan Rosenberg waged war on each other without ever appearing on stage together . It was a moving confrontation , guided by Joe Cacaci ' s deft writing and direction . &quot; The School for Scandal &quot; ( A Noise Within ) . Director Art Manke applied a thin but stylish layer of updating to the design of this Richard Sheridan classic and assembled a wonderful gallery of comic characterizations . &quot; The Visit &quot; ( Pacific Resident Theatre Ensemble ) . Friedrich Durrenmatt ' s great play about the quality of justice was enormously compelling in Stephanie Shroyer ' s environmental staging . Honorable_mention : There are too many autobiographical monologues in L.A. theater , so I hesitate to encourage others . But Marga Gomez ' s &quot; Memory Tricks , &quot; Colin Martin ' s &quot; Virgins and Other Myths &quot; and Lynn Redgrave ' s &quot; Shakespeare for My Father &quot; momentarily managed to redeem the genre . Also here ' s a nod to three grand star turns_in old-fashioned musicals : Sandy Duncan in &quot; South Pacific , &quot; Marie Osmond in &quot; The Sound of Music , &quot; Karen Morrow in &quot; Hello , Dolly ! &quot; Finally , a tip of the bowler_hat to Bill Irwin and David Shiner for &quot; Fool Moon. &quot; For me , this show lacked the sense of discovery that I felt during the two men ' s individual earlier efforts . But for the many who had never seen them , the tonic of their post-earthquake appearance at the Doolittle certainly qualified as one of the year ' s more blessed_events .</TEXT>
