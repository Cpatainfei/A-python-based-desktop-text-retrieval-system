   <HEADLINE> HOW HITCHCOCK FOUGHT NAZIS ; THE MASTER MADE TWO PROPAGANDA FILMS THAT HAVEN ' T BEEN SEEN HERE , UNTIL NOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even the most ardent Alfred Hitchcock buffs , who know every twist and turn of every film and TV episode the master of suspense presented , are in_for a surprising cinematic treat next month with the release on video of two short Hitchcock films never before seen in the Unites States . The intricately plotted films -- the 26-minute &quot; Bon Voyage &quot; and the 31-minute &quot; Aventure Malgache &quot; -- were made in 1944 when , at the request of the_British Ministry of Information , Hitchcock returned to England from Hollywood to make anti-Nazi propaganda movies . The bilingual Hitchcock was asked to film the movies in French , so they could be smuggled into Occupied France to be shown to Resistance fighters there . But the films , which the ministry ultimately deemed &quot; too subversive &quot; and cynical to be used as propaganda films , have languished in the possession of the_British government since the ' 40s . * Los Angeles Hitchcock fans will also be able to see them on the big screen , May 11 and 12 at the New Beverly Cinema , which will do full justice to the films ' superb black-and-white cinematography by Gunther Krampf , a German who was then in exile in Britain . The films , a cooperative venture of Milestone Film &amp; Video in New York and the_British Film Institute , are both in French and carry English subtitles provided by British film scholar Tom Milne . When British officials finally screened the two films , not too surprisingly , they were stunned to learn they had been given something quite different from what they had bargained for . The films are subtle , intricate , carefully detailed film noir , models of compression and resourcefulness ( and clearly show the work of Hitchcock at his prime , coming as they do between &quot; Shadow of a Doubt &quot; and &quot; Spellbound &quot; ) , with Hitchcock clearly relishing pushing the limits of exceeding a limited budget ( Hitchcock himself was paid a nominal fee ) and shooting schedule . The films were shot between Jan . 20 , 1944 , and Feb . 25 , 1944 , at the Associated British Studios at Welwyn Garden City . Both featured members of the Moliere Players , a French exile group that included many amateur actors , many of whose families were still in France . In the first , &quot; Bon Voyage , &quot; a young Scottish RAF gunner ( British actor John Blythe ) , who has escaped_from a POW_camp in Germany , makes his way to London , where he is interviewed by an officer of the Free French Intelligence . In flashback , the gunner , Sgt . Dougal , who ' s amusingly always hungry , tells how he was helped by another escapee , a Pole , and made his way through France with the help of the Resistance . When the officer tells the sergeant that the Pole was really a Vichy spy out_to uncover as_many members of the Resistance as possible , this triggers a rerun , in flashback , of the sergeant ' s journey , which takes_on a whole new meaning , with many subtle details revealed . At once a homage to the Resistance and a cautionary tale , &quot; Bon Voyage &quot; was actually smuggled into France during the war , where it had limited exposure . &quot; Bon Voyage &quot; was written by J.O.C. Orton and Angus McPhail from an idea by Arthur Calder-Marshall . In 1967 , Hitchcock told Francois Truffaut , in their book-length interview , that during the making of &quot; Bon Voyage &quot; he had to bear_in_mind the serious hardships faced by the_French who were his intended audience . &quot; In ( one ) shot , I showed a restaurant . Ordinarily you would never think_about the look of a table where a meal has been finished . But in representing a French restaurant of the day , you did . There are no crusts left on the table . If I permitted anything like that , it would simply mean to future French audiences that the people who made the picture didn ' t know what they were doing. &quot; He also learned , he told Truffaut , how divided the Free French really were . That essential conflict became the subject of &quot; Aventure Galgache , &quot; in which a French lawyer , formerly a resident of Madagascar , plays himself in a dramatization of his experiences helping compatriots escape to join De Gaulle . The lawyer , Clarousse , tells his story with much humor to his fellow actors in a dressing room of the Moliere Player ' s theater ; this device allows Hitchcock to cut_back to the dressing room for some quick exposition and to underline the satirical tone with which he treats the lawyer ' s enemies , a corrupt group loyal to the Vichy Government . Written by Hitchcock with noted French actor Claude Dauphin , &quot; Aventure Malgache , &quot; although it saluted the heroism of Clarousse and others , revealed the ambiguity and treachery among the_French themselves to an extent surely not equaled until Marcel Ophuls ' 1970 documentary &quot; The Sorrow and the Pity. &quot; Naturally this was further than the Ministry of Information had intended the film to go and &quot; Aventure Malgache &quot; never made_it to France . Patricia Hitchcock O ' Connell , the director ' s daughter , reached by phone at her home_in Solvang , said that while she didn ' t remember her father ' s talking much about the films , she remembers clearly how she and her mother had to stay behind in Bel-Air while her father traveled_to war-torn London . Hitchcock originally was to make his shorts for American audiences rather than for the_French . Yet it was David O . Selznick who , when asked his opinion of the films , declared that they were &quot; too inferior &quot; for the U.S. market . And when the_British government requested the services of Hitchcock , Selznick , to whom he was under contract , balked at releasing his greatest director and finally relented -- only with the proviso that while in London Hitchcock would at_the_same_time continue working_on the script for &quot; Spellbound. &quot;</TEXT>
