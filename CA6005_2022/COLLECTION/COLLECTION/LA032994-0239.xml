   <HEADLINE> U.S. RUSHES TO REASSURE JAPAN AFTER CARJACKING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the weekend slayings of two Marymount College_students sent shock_waves through Japan and Japanese American communities , U.S. dignitaries rushed Monday to reassure frantic parents and to counter charges in the Japanese media that Southern California is a gun-infested danger_zone . In Washington , State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the U.S._government is very concerned that the carjacking killings of Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura , both 19 , will create &quot; a very distorted and one-sided view of the United States abroad. &quot; President Clinton expressed condolences to Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa during a telephone_conversation about Japan ' s new economic plan . In Orange County , Gov . Pete Wilson called_on the state Legislature to impose the death_penalty on those who commit murder during a carjacking . As headlines in the Japanese press decried America ' s fascination with guns , Japanese exchange students throughout the Southland were suddenly more cautious and fearful about this foreign land . Yoshimoto Hirakawa , 20 , a business student at Chapman University in Orange , said he was lucky to have friends who told him about the dangers of crime when he arrived here from Japan . &quot; When I first came_to the United States , my friends told me what to worry about , &quot; he said . &quot; Now I share these things with newcomers , like never walk alone after midnight . Never drive alone into a bad neighborhood , especially at night . And , listen to the local guys about where you should and where you shouldn ' t go . &quot; In Japan , it ' s so safe you don ' t have to worry about anything , &quot; he continued . &quot; that ' s why we take_it_easy when we come here . We just don ' t think it can happen to us. &quot; Ito , a Japanese citizen , and Matsuura , who was born in the United States but grew_up in Japan , were shot in the head late Friday night in a carjacking in the parking_lot of a San Pedro supermarket . Police -- who remained close-mouthed on Monday about the case -- recovered their white 1994 Honda Civic on Sunday not far from the scene of the crime , but not before the two young_men died after being taken_off life-support at Harbor-UCLA Medical_Center . Seiko Kagami , an English student at Cal State Fullerton , said she , for one , will not be going_to her local supermarket after dark anymore . &quot; We are very scared , &quot; Kagami , 22 , said . &quot; This problem never happens in Japan. &quot; Ako Kasahara , 34 , who is studying English at UC Irvine , said she hopes the tragedy will not make people in Japan think America is a &quot; terrible country. &quot; &quot; I like this country , I like California , the weather and the people , &quot; she said . &quot; But you need to know you ' re not in Japan anymore. &quot; Meanwhile , Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan called a news_conference in Los Angeles with the Japanese consul general , Seiichiro Noboru , hoping to assuage the alarm of tourism officials in Japan . &quot; Los Angeles is not a place where this or any other type of violence should be tolerated , &quot; Riordan said , vowing not to rest as mayor &quot; until Los Angeles is safe. &quot; And Noboru refrained_from making generalizations about violence in the United States , promising instead that the incident &quot; should not and will not have any effect upon the friendly_relationship between this country and Japan ( or ) . . . change the love of the Japanese people toward sunny and warm Southern California. &quot; But those promises faced an uphill battle against a growing impression in Japan that the United States is a dangerous and violent society that , unlike Japan , has done little to control the use and ownership of guns . &quot; Gun Society . . . Another Tragedy in Los Angeles , &quot; trumpeted one headline in the newspaper Sankei Sports . &quot; For a Car ? &quot; Added an editorial in the Japan Times : &quot; A beginning must be made to combat the American gun culture , which is getting_out of control. &quot; Meanwhile , Japanese students in Southern California reported that parents have been calling frantically from abroad , hoping to persuade their children to return home . Morikazu Sano , a communications student at Cal State Fullerton , said he also had a call from his worried family , who more_than ever want him to come_home to Japan once he graduates this summer . Sano , 23 , said he has been more aware of crime problems since his own car was burglarized two years ago in downtown Los Angeles . &quot; That shocked me so_much , &quot; he said . &quot; After that , I couldn ' t trust anyone . That woke me up . I don ' t go_out alone at night . I don ' t even go_to Ralph ' s or other supermarkets at night. &quot; Takayuki Nishio , a 23-year-old exchange student studying English at Cal State Fullerton , said he believes colleges could do more to inform foreign students of crime problems . &quot; Cal State Fullerton is pretty safe , &quot; he said . &quot; But we cannot be too careful. &quot; More_than 3 million Japanese tourists and students visit the United States each year , about one in six of them bound for Los Angeles County . Aside from the damage the slayings could do to Los Angeles ' international reputation , officials said , the deaths could cause financial repercussions . Some smaller colleges have become increasingly dependent_on Japanese enrollment , and even before the killings , many students had trouble convincing their parents that the United States -- and Los Angeles in particular -- was a safe place to attend school . Such concerns have helped dampen the flow of students from Japan to the United States in recent years , although the slumping Japanese economy and the increasing popularity of European destinations have also been factors . The number of Japanese students in the United States jumped from 17 # 000 in 1983 to a peak of nearly 58 # 000 in 1990 , aided by the strong yen , but slipped to about 40 # 000 last year , according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service . Meanwhile , Los Angeles-area tourism officials expressed concerns about the impact the slayings will have_on the flow of nearly 500 # 000 Japanese who visit Los Angeles County annually . &quot; The Japanese tourist market is much more volatile and problematic than most , &quot; said Stanley Plog , a travel and tourism research specialist . &quot; There have been no cancellations , but I think it will affect tourism , not dramatically or immediately , but gradually , &quot; said Shiro Monden , the Los Angeles general_manager of Japan Travel Bureau International , a large Japanese tour operator that sends about 100 # 000 customers a year to Southern California . The killings in Los Angeles , which have sparked outrage locally and abroad and which have been widely covered by the Japanese news media , have fed a longstanding Japanese perception that the United States is a dangerous place . Shooting deaths of Japanese students in Baton_Rouge , La. , in 1992 and in Northern California in 1993 were covered by the Japanese press as continuing evidence of the ruthlessness of America ' s &quot; gun society. &quot; &quot; After the ( Baton_Rouge ) killing , of course we were worried sick to have a child go_to the U.S. , &quot; said Rumiko Ito , mother of Takuma Ito , on a Japanese television broadcast . &quot; We said : ' Why would you even think_of going_to that country ? ' But this was his dream , to go_to college there. &quot; Some Southland colleges and universities on Monday were planning special safety presentations to make international students more aware of crime problems . &quot; I can only hope that from a tragedy of this magnitude , we can somehow find an opportunity in this to make everyone a little bit more aware , &quot; said Bob Ericksen , director of international education and exchange at Cal State Fullerton . It is too early to know whether the incident will have any impact on enrollment of Japanese students at local colleges . Southern California is the most popular foreign destination in the world for Japanese students , according to Japanese education sources . A significant part of the 40 # 000 Japanese who come_to study in the United States each year head for Los Angeles , attracted by its reputation for beaches , good_weather and easygoing atmosphere . But Masaru Yamada , president of ICS , a Japanese company that facilitates foreign study programs , said the impact of the slayings could be significant . The news , he noted , hit just as students are preparing their applications for summer study-abroad programs . He said he expects some students to change their destinations from Los Angeles to smaller_towns in the United States or to Australia , Canada or Britain , which are perceived as safer . * TOUGH STANCE : Governor visits Orange County to push anti-crime agenda .
