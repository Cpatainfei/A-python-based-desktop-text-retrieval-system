   <HEADLINE> CLINTON TARGETS HAITI ' S ELITE WITH NEW CURBS ; SANCTIONS : FLIGHTS TO U.S. , FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ARE BANNED IN EFFORT TO PRESSURE SUPPORTERS OF THE JUNTA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton tightened sanctions against Haiti on Friday with a ban on commercial flights and financial transactions between the two countries -- steps likely to punish Haiti ' s prosperous elite but to have little direct effect on its ruling junta . Supplementing measures enacted nearly a month ago , Clinton announced a ban on commercial flights beginning June 25 . The move is expected to halt at least two-thirds of scheduled air trips to and from Haiti . The prohibition on transactions is intended to suspend wire transfers of cash , trade financing and even the carrying of cash from the United States to the Caribbean nation . &quot; The message is simple : Democracy must be restored , the coup must_not endure , &quot; Clinton said at a White_House briefing . Shortly afterward , the State_Department said it is withdrawing embassy dependents and some employees from Haiti . It urged private U.S. citizens who are not affiliated with humanitarian programs to leave as soon as possible . State_Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said about 120 Americans will leave and 80 will stay . She said the action is being taken because the unstable situation has the potential for random violence . The flight ban announced by Clinton includes exemptions for humanitarian missions that have been organized to support the feeding of about 1 million Haitians . Similarly , to enable Haitian Americans to continue to support their families in Haiti , the sanctions will permit them to send $ 50 a month . Since members of the Haitian military have already had their travel restricted and assets frozen , the new sanctions are directed at a Haitian civilian elite that is assumed to support the junta . &quot; The emphasis here is . . . to apply pressure to those groups that are supporting the coup leadership , &quot; said William H . Gray III , Clinton ' s special envoy to Haiti . But observers in the United States and Haiti said that many of those Haitians have already moved their assets to third countries , such_as the Cayman Islands . Many have also stockpiled goods on the island for their own survival and comfort . The travel ban is likely to come as a shock , at least at first , for the better-off Haitians who continue to travel , observers said . One Haitian businessman predicted that the flight ban will have a &quot; deep psychological impact &quot; on Haitians who &quot; have developed the idea that they have a right to go_to Miami for recreation and to do business. &quot; But he and others were skeptical that the ban will create pressure that would move the military to give_up control . &quot; They are in this to the finish , &quot; the businessman said . Ernest Preeg , a former U.S. ambassador to Haiti , said it is doubtful that such pressure will prompt the army to give_up power . &quot; They ' re desperate . If it all falls_apart , their lives will be at risk , &quot; said Preeg , now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . Despite such outside skepticism , U.S. officials emphasized their belief that the steps would work , if only indirectly . Gray said that while sanctions &quot; don ' t solve any crisis , &quot; he believes that they will &quot; create the kind of atmosphere where we can have a diplomatic breakthrough and a solution where the coup leaders will step down. &quot; White_House officials recently have played_down the likelihood of a U.S. invasion to restore exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , who was ousted by a military coup in September , 1991 . But by declaring that they fully expect these steps to force change , U.S. officials have preserved the option of later declaring that the failure of a measured response had compelled them to turn_to a military solution . Gray said that recent efforts to tighten the economic embargo are showing signs of success . An increase in gasoline prices , he said , showed that efforts to close_down the smuggling from the Dominican_Republic are beginning to take_hold . U.S. officials said they did not impose the flight ban immediately in_order to allow those wanting to leave Haiti to do so in orderly fashion . American Airlines , one of the chief U.S. air carriers to Haiti , has added extra flights . About a third of all commercial flights to and from Haiti will not be directly affected by the U.S. suspension . Most of these are by Air France , the rest by Canadian and Dutch airlines . Canada said Friday that it will suspend commercial flights June 25 . Gray said U.S. officials expect that the other countries will consider whether to follow_suit . Gray said the exemption for small amounts of cash will provide a lifeline for people abroad who help support family and friends in Haiti . &quot; When you ' re talking_about a society where annual income is about $ 350 , ( $ 50 ) is a significant amount , &quot; he said . He said the United States intends to continue its humanitarian aid to Haiti -- now totaling about $ 75 million -- though Haitian thugs have seized about $ 12 million of it . Air cargo service and charter flights to and from Haiti are already prohibited under a U.N. trade_embargo that took_effect May 21 . A U.N. oil embargo has been in_effect since last fall . Last Tuesday , the Organization of American_States banned commercial flights and financial transactions between its members and Haiti . Preeg , the former ambassador , said the flight ban will also make life significantly riskier for the 10 # 000 foreigners , many of them charity workers , who remain in Haiti .
