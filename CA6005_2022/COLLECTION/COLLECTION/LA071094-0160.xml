   <HEADLINE> AMERICAN CEOS NEED TO GET SOME CULTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While Michael Schrage ( &quot; U.S. Is a Free Market When It Comes_to CEOs , &quot; June 2 ) makes a good case for the openness of American corporations to considering foreign executives as CEOs , there are some significant points that are being missed . Even if foreign companies were inclined to consider Americans as chief_executives for their multinational corporations , few would qualify . Whereas Michael Spindler , for example , converses with ease in English , the vast majority of American candidates for CEO consideration have at best a dim recollection of high_school German or French , and their knowledge of foreign culture usually does not extend beyond the superficial and frequently incorrect cliches served_up by the American entertainment media . European executives generally are fluent in at least one foreign language and have a working knowledge in one or two others . Schrage ' s assertion &quot; that it is almost impossible to imagine a set of circumstances where Nestle is run_by someone other_than a Swiss &quot; would certainly hold for the typical American candidate , who would probably need an interpreter just to find the executive washroom . I believe foreign multinationals are not nearly as averse to considering American candidates for the top spot as is implied , if they could find some that have at least a working knowledge of the local culture and language .
