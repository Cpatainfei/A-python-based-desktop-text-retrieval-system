   <HEADLINE> MAJOR NARROWLY SURVIVES KEY VOTE IN BRITISH PARLIAMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> British Prime_Minister John Major won a narrow victory Monday on a crucial vote to increase Britain ' s contribution to the European Union , saving him from calling a general_election that he would almost certainly have lost . But the ruling Conservative_Party , lagging 25 points behind the Labor_Party in public_opinion_polls , was left with deep internal wounds after Major adopted strong-arm tactics to force anti-European members_of_Parliament into line . An opposition Labor_Party amendment designed to wreck the bill was defeated on a 330-303 vote , with Major having to rely_on Northern_Ireland MPs to shore_up his fragile majority of 14 . On the final question , Labor_Party members abstained in the 329-44 vote . The bill would boost Britain ' s $ 3.75-billion contribution to the European Union next year by $ 118 million . Future contributions also would be increased . About 20 government rebels originally threatened to scuttle the measure , but Major warned that he would call a general_election if the bill were defeated . In the end , seven Conservative MPs ignored strong pressure and abstained on the vote . They now risk being barred from taking_part in ruling-party business in the House of Commons .</TEXT>
