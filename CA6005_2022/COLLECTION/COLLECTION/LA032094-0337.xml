   <HEADLINE> CLINTON TAKES HIS HEALTH REFORM PLAN TO THE PEOPLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton is going_back to the basics to sell Americans on his battered health_care reform plan , insisting that there is a lot more in the 1 # 342-page blueprint that will benefit people than they realize . &quot; Everywhere I go families tell me we ' ve got_to do something about health_care , and they ' re right , &quot; Clinton said Saturday in his weekly radio address . But , he said , &quot; the defenders of the status_quo are trying to confuse the issue by making_it seem complicated . &quot; Next week and in the months ahead , I ' m going_to tell people all across America about our health reform plan and what it really means. &quot; He spelled_out what he said are its core principles : &quot; Guaranteed private insurance , your choice of doctors and health plans , outlawing unfair insurance practices , preserving Medicare , guaranteeing health benefits at_work . &quot; It ' s that simple . I want to cut_through the complexity , the confusion and downright distortion. &quot; He said that as Congress debates his health_care plan , the issue should be decided by informed citizens , &quot; not by special_interests , skilled at spending millions of dollars to prevent progress and to promote their own narrow interests. &quot; &quot; Let ' s face the facts , debate our choices , and make a historic decision to build_on what ' s best and fix what ' s worst in our health_care system , &quot; Clinton said . In the Republican response , Sen . Hank Brown of Colorado asserted that &quot; the President ' s health_care plan is dead. &quot; Brown said the proposal is doomed because of its potential cost and the creation of new federal bureaucracy . He called_on Clinton to work with the GOP to develop a new health_care plan that would ease paperwork and assure that people can take their coverage with them when they change jobs . Brown also proposed a tax_break for small businesses offering health_insurance .</TEXT>
