   <HEADLINE> JUDGE FREES FUGITIVE IRISH NATIONALIST ; COURTS : JAMES JOSEPH SMYTH WOULD FACE PERSECUTION IN PRISON , FEDERAL JURIST RULES IN BARRING EXTRADITION TO BRITAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal judge Thursday refused to order the extradition of an Irish nationalist and prison escapee to Britain to complete his sentence for attempted murder , saying the man would face persecution because of his political views . U.S. District Judge Barbara Caulfield ordered the immediate release of James Joseph Smyth from jail , where he has been held except for short intervals since his capture by federal_agents in San Francisco in June , 1992 . Based on evidence of conditions in Northern_Ireland and Smyth ' s past treatment in and out of prison , he would probably be in danger in prison and after his release , Caulfield said . The &quot; frequent stops , arrests , interrogations , beatings and searches of his home &quot; to which Smyth was subjected as a known Irish nationalist are &quot; a harbinger of things to come if Mr. Smyth returns to the streets of Northern_Ireland , &quot; Caulfield wrote . She also quoted a prison warden as saying he could not guarantee Smyth ' s safety in prison . Smyth was released from the federal prison at Dublin , Calif. , about an hour after the ruling was issued , and he headed for a celebration at an Irish pub in San Francisco , according to one of his supporters , who asked not to be identified . Smyth ' s case is a potential precedent-setter for other fugitives from Northern_Ireland , including three fellow participants in a 1983 jailbreak now awaiting extradition hearings in San Francisco . Caulfield is the first judge to interpret restrictions on extradition under a 1986 treaty between the United States and Britain . The treaty bars extradition of anyone who would face persecution on account of race , religion , nationality or political opinions . The British government , represented in the case by the U.S. Justice_Department , has appealed every unfavorable ruling so far , and has twice won reversal of Caulfield ' s decisions freeing Smyth on bail . Smyth , now 40 , of Belfast , describes himself as an Irish nationalist and member of Sinn Fein , the political_party affiliated with the_Irish Republican Army , but says he is nonviolent and has never been an IRA member . He was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the 1977 attempted murder of an off-duty prison_guard , in which he continues to maintain his innocence . In 1983 , he and 37 other men , all described by British authorities as terrorists or sympathizers , fled from the Maze prison near Belfast in the largest such escape in British history . Nearly nine years later , Smyth was arrested in San Francisco , where he lived under an assumed name , was married and worked as a house_painter . At Smyth ' s trial , his lawyer demanded reports of police_investigations into allegations that security_forces had practiced a &quot; shoot-to-kill &quot; policy against suspected terrorists in the late 1970s . Citing security concerns , the_British government refused to provide the reports . As a consequence , the judge said she would presume that Catholic Irish nationalists such_as Smyth , accused or convicted of crimes against security_forces or government officials , were subjected_to retaliation , physical intimidation and death , with the participation or endorsement of government forces . Although several fugitives have recently been returned to the Maze without incident , the past treatment of Smyth and his fellow escapees suggests that he would be a target , Caulfield said .</TEXT>
