   <HEADLINE> D.A. HAS HIGH RATE OF SUCCESS , AUDIT SAYS ; COURTS : INDEPENDENT STUDY CHALLENGES PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF FAILURE , BUT NOTES BUDGET WOES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite public perceptions to the contrary , the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office has a high success rate in prosecuting crime but is hampered by inadequate financing , according to an independent audit released Tuesday . The audit , conducted by a Santa Monica firm at the request of the 1993-94 grand_jury , also found little basis for criticism that county prosecutors cannot win high-profile cases . Describing that view_as &quot; far short of accurate , &quot; the audit noted that while prosecutors failed to get convictions in the state trial of police_officers accused of beating Rodney G . King , the murder case against the Menendez brothers and on some charges in the Reginald O . Denny case , they sent defendants to prison in the Night Stalker and Cotton Club killings and in the Charles Keating securities fraud case . &quot; Because expectations are absolute , it appears anything short of total success . . . gives_rise to a perception of inadequacy , &quot; the report said . It blamed high expectations on a pervasive public fear of crime , adding that such fear is not entirely justified . &quot; Despite the fact that the overall crime_rate is down across the country , and that no city in Los Angeles County was ranked among the nation ' s 15 most dangerous cities in a recent survey , &quot; the audit said , &quot; that is not the perception of the average person who is constantly exposed to a media litany of violent crime reports. &quot; The audit , conducted by Leonard Fuller &amp; Co. , was part of a full report of the grand_jury whose term ended last month . The report included the results of surveys of former trial jurors and sitting judges conducted separately from the audit by a committee of grand jurors . In the surveys , individual prosecutors ' performances were rated from excellent to such low levels that , according to the committee , some of them should not have been allowed to try cases . Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti , commenting on the report , said he was not troubled by the surveys because they were &quot; unscientific &quot; compared to a professional review by trained auditors of management systems . He said he felt vindicated by the audit ' s findings . &quot; The report should give the community some confidence in the professionalism . . . of the lawyers who represent the people every day in court , &quot; he said . The audit found that , despite a limited staff , high caseloads , low staff morale , weaknesses in some management systems and an inadequate budget , the district_attorney ' s office in 1992 ( the most recent year studied ) had a 93.6 % conviction rate for the 52 # 905 felony cases it tried and a 99.4 % rate for 173 # 835 misdemeanor cases . Many of the shortcomings that auditors did find , the audit said , are traceable to &quot; increasing demand for services with decreasing resources . &quot; The single most pervasive and debilitating problem affecting ( the office ) and the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations is its financial_condition , &quot; the audit said . Since the 1991-92 fiscal_year , it noted , the budget_for the office has decreased 2.4 % , from $ 122.6 million to $ 119.6 million , resulting in the loss of 51 positions for criminal attorneys . Current staffing , the audit said , has left the office with 7.8 prosecutors per 100 # 000 residents , compared to New York County , which includes Manhattan , which has 33.7 prosecutors per 100 # 000 residents .</TEXT>
