   <HEADLINE> SERVICE-SECTOR JOBS GROWTH NO CAUSE FOR CONCERN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Over the past 20 years , Orange County ' s economy has been transformed from a bedroom community into a mature and diversified economy . In this process , Orange County experienced rapid economic_growth and a high level of job formation . Total Orange County non-agricultural employment increased from 474 # 000 in 1972 to 1.126 million in 1992 , an annual average increase of 4.4 % . The service-producing sector of the economy grew at a much more rapid rate than the goods-producing sector over this period . From 1972 to 1992 , the service-producing sector generated nearly 547 # 000 jobs , an annual average increase of 5.2 % . The goods-producing sector , which includes mining , construction and manufacturing industries , generated 105 # 000 jobs , an annual average increase of only 2.5 % . This unbalanced growth has raised some concerns that Orange County ' s economy is being converted from a goods-producing economy into a service-producing one and that this trend is not healthy for the economy . This argument is not necessarily valid . The share of the goods-producing sector of Orange County ' s economy decreased from 34 % of total non-agricultural employment in 1972 to 24 % in 1992 . Several factors exacerbated this trend . The 1990-91 recession , which was relatively mild and short-lived at the national level , adversely affected Orange County for three years and had an especially adverse impact on the construction and manufacturing sectors . In addition , defense spending cutbacks caused significant job losses . But even if the impact of the recession and the job losses derived from corporate downsizing and defense spending cutbacks are disregarded , the share of the goods-producing sector of the economy was already shrinking over time and this should not be surprising . Why ? First , the goods-producing sector , particularly manufacturing , is more receptive to adopting advanced technological changes than the service-producing sector . Consequently , labor productivity in the goods-producing sector grows faster than the rest of the economy . As a result , increases in_demand for manufactured goods are being satisfied mostly by improvement in productivity rather than the increase in employment . Secondly , the service-producing sector is typically labor-intensive operations where higher demand could mostly be satisfied by an increase in employment . Finally , the rapid_growth of the service-producing sector of Orange County has been in response to increasing population . A large quantity of manufactured goods is exported to other parts of the country and abroad . Output of the service-producing sector , however , is produced mainly for the region ' s consumption . Indeed , as the population of Orange County grew , employment in retail trade , services , real_estate , public_utilities and transportation , and local_government experienced rapid_growth . Is anything wrong with a region ' s economy if the concentration of jobs is in the non-goods producing sectors ? The conventional argument is that manufacturing jobs are typically higher paid than other jobs , and the increase in non-manufacturing jobs at the expense of manufacturing jobs will hinder the region ' s income growth . But in Orange County , the average hourly wage in the manufacturing sector in 1992 was $ 12.21 , only 28 cents more_than the service-producing sector . Contrary to common belief , service jobs are no longer limited to flipping hamburgers or washing cars . The quality of service jobs has steadily improved . Continuous increases in_demand for data processing , telecommunications , financial , legal and health_care services have induced a rapid_growth in jobs that require a high level of skills and training , and pay relatively high salaries . No one can really predetermine an optimal mix of goods-producing and service-producing industries . At higher stages of economic development and growth , non-manufacturing jobs are expected to grow at a faster rate . In the process , firms will constantly consider expanding , relocating and shutting_down operations in response to the economic environment , and this is as it should be in a free market system .</TEXT>
