   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; PERRY ' S STEADY HAND STANDS_OUT ON FOREIGN_POLICY TEAM ; PENTAGON : ONCE DISMISSED AS A TECHNOCRAT , THE DEFENSE_SECRETARY NOW COMMANDS RESPECT FOR HIS QUIET EFFECTIVENESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton ' s foreign_policy difficulties may be igniting wide criticism of his national security team , but at least one top official is escaping most of the heat : Defense_Secretary William J . Perry . In the past four months , the soft-spoken former mathematics professor has emerged as one of the Administration ' s few pleasant surprises in the foreign_policy arena . Besides getting a grip on the Pentagon ' s sprawling bureaucracy -- and gaining the respect of the military -- Perry , 66 , has become a quiet but important player in the Administration ' s foreign_policy apparatus , gradually winning plaudits from the Administration and its critics alike . It was Perry , for example , who helped hone the Administration ' s proposal to launch air strikes in Bosnia -- limiting the enforcement to a small exclusion zone that NATO forces could handle easily . He was the Administration ' s point_man in engineering a nuclear_weapons disarmament treaty between Russia and Ukraine . More recently , he has become its chief spokesman in the stalemate with North_Korea over nuclear_weapons inspections . With few glitches along the way , Perry &quot; is dealing with the problems he ' s got as well as anyone can be expected to , &quot; said Robert W . Gaskin , a former Pentagon military strategist who has been a frequent critic of the Administration . Sharing that opinion is Harold Brown , who served as defense_secretary during the Jimmy_Carter Administration . &quot; Is he going_to solve all_of their problems ? I think the answer is no , &quot; Brown said . &quot; But he has done very well. &quot; Admittedly , at least part of Perry ' s overnight rise may have come_by default . By some outside assessments , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher has proved a capable negotiator but not a strategic thinker , and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake has been so low-key that he has failed to enunciate the Administration ' s policies clearly . Perry is known as a problem-solver , and he explains issues articulately and directly . He has also benefited from the inevitable comparisons to his predecessor , Les Aspin . Aspin ' s plans to inject the Pentagon into formulating broad foreign_policy brought him into conflict with the State_Department and the National Security_Council . His frequent public ruminating about policy options , and his accompanying gaffes , heightened the perception that the Administration was in disarray . And his manipulative style alienated many in Congress and the military . By contrast , Perry is demonstrating himself to be a no-nonsense pragmatist who is quick to make decisions and has an impressive command of detail . Invariably straightforward , he has restored good relations with military_leaders and lawmakers . &quot; He has the complete confidence of the military -- he ' s frank , &quot; said Rep . John P . Murtha ( D-Pa. ) , chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on defense . &quot; I think he ' s doing a commendable job. &quot; Others say he has quietly brought order out of the previous managerial chaos . &quot; Perry is nothing that Aspin was , and everything that Aspin wasn ' t , &quot; one Pentagon-watcher said . He also has confined himself to the defense_secretary ' s traditional role of running the nation ' s military Establishment and finding ways to make_it serve the President ' s foreign_policy objectives . Sometimes that means squelching a proposal that seems unrealistically ambitious . For instance , Administration officials say he recently nipped a campaign to mount an invasion of Haiti by publicly questioning what the United States would do once its troops took_over the island nation . Perry is less active in debates on foreign_policy issues where the military isn ' t likely to play a major role , the officials say . Often , insiders say , if Perry sees problems with a particular Administration proposal , he counters with an alternative crafted to meet the same goal , as was true with the Bosnia exclusion zone . The secretary has used his influence in other ways as well . Acting on a conviction that the public must be prepared_for a possible outbreak of hostilities by North_Korea , Perry took it on himself to warn about the risks that a possible military confrontation would bring . Washington and Pyongyang both got the message . To be sure , Perry ' s four months as secretary have not been entirely error-free . In an appearance on NBC-TV ' s &quot; Meet the Press &quot; program in early April , he set_off a major brouhaha by inadvertently leaving the impression that the United States would sit_by and let the Bosnian Serbs storm the Muslim city of Gorazde . While Perry was technically correct in his explanation of the Administration ' s policy , he said he did not anticipate how it sounded or would be interpreted . And a_few weeks ago , he provoked a similar flurry over Haiti when he suggested there were preliminary indications that its military strongman , Gen . Raoul Cedras , was about to resign . The political and diplomatic ripples from that incident caused some consternation in the State_Department , but so far Perry seems to have recovered successfully , vowing to become more careful in his statements to the press . Asked_in a recent interview about his comments on NBC , Perry said : &quot; I have to take a certain part of the responsibility , first of all for not understanding that ( the ) statement standing by itself could be misinterpreted , and ( for ) not catching_it quickly enough . &quot; The lessons I ' ve drawn from that , &quot; he said wryly , &quot; is when I make a direct , flat statement of that sort , to put the qualifiers in the same statement , not in the next paragraph. &quot; Perry is anything but shy about reshuffling things . Within days after taking the helm at the Pentagon , Perry jettisoned three of Aspin ' s most contentious appointees and dismantled his predecessor ' s controversial in-house think_tank . Even now , he has little time for small_talk . Pentagon aides say Perry-led meetings typically are over in 30 minutes . The really big sessions last no more_than an hour , and decisions almost invariably come soon after . There also is a certain aloofness about Perry that unsettles some who remember Aspin ' s more informal style . There is little evidence of a Perry sense_of_humor , and he can be so poker-faced in discussions that some insiders find him almost inscrutable . With a long career in the defense industry -- he is known as the godfather of the Stealth bomber -- and a background in U.S.-Soviet strategy , high-tech weapons and defense-industry problems , Perry said he has already set a firm agenda : to keep the world from drifting back into a Cold_War , to develop a new approach for using U.S. military power in the post-Cold War world and to manage the reduction in the size of the nation ' s armed forces . &quot; I will measure myself &quot; by these goals &quot; when I leave the job , &quot; he said . Critics concede he has made a good start on the first of these , forging and cementing ties with former Soviet Bloc military_leaders , helping achieve an accord with Russia and Ukraine to dismantle their nuclear_weapons , and pressing the Administration ' s new Partnership for Peace program in NATO . He has begun work_on his second objective by creating half_a_dozen new task_forces within the Pentagon to study proposals for altering the way the United States uses military power . On the third , he has begun efforts to streamline the way the Pentagon buys equipment and weapons_systems . He has also sought to ease the impact of military downsizing on the nation ' s defense industries base by eliminating excess regulations and preserving some programs in_order to keep production_lines open . Andrew Krepinevich , director of the Defense Budget Project , a nonpartisan research firm in Washington , predicts that Perry ' s most serious test may come when the rapidly shrinking defense budget begins to force the Administration into making some major choices about what kind of military it really wants . &quot; If present trends hold , the seams are going_to come_apart , &quot; Krepinevich said . &quot; we ' ll see what Perry is made of then. &quot; For all_of Perry ' s long ties with the defense Establishment , aides say he is thoroughly comfortable with Clinton ' s current foreign_policies . Although frustrated at times because he cannot move things along more rapidly , he agrees with Clinton on most major issues . A liberal on social issues , he also backs Clinton ' s decisions to crack_down on sexual_harassment and discrimination against gays in the military -- although he has kept a low profile on both issues . Perry ' s success is somewhat surprising given that he was hardly Clinton ' s favorite for the job . Dismissed earlier as a technocrat , he initially was passed_up for Aspin , who was chairman of the House Armed Services Committee . After Aspin resigned in December of last year , Clinton picked Adm . Bobby Ray Inman , who embarrassingly removed himself from contention after a short time . It was then that Perry ' s name came_up seriously -- as a safe , if unspectacular , choice . Clinton went_along , but with little evident enthusiasm . Today , however , there are few in the Administration who believe that Clinton has settled for a second-rater in the office . If anything , even Perry has been amazed at the pace of it all . &quot; It ' s been a damn exciting ( four ) months. &quot; he said . &quot; It seems like there ' s been a crisis a week ever since I got_into the job. &quot;</TEXT>
