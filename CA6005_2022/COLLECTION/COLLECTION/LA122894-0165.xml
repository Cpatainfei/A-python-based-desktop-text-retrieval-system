   <HEADLINE> U.S. SAYS ISRAEL GAVE COMBAT JET PLANS TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seven years ago , in the face of mounting costs , the United States withdrew from an elaborate project to help build an advanced combat aircraft for Israel . The idea was scrubbed -- or so it seemed . Now , to the consternation of U.S. officials , much of the American know-how and initial planning for the canceled &quot; Lavi &quot; fighter plane are about to be put to use in China . U.S._government officials have recently concluded that China and Israel are collaborating to develop and produce an improved fighter for the Chinese air_force . Comparable_to an American F-16 , the new plane will be based on the Lavi and will incorporate extensive technological innovations derived from that project , according to U.S._government experts on the Chinese military . China and Israel already have finished work_on a prototype , and production will probably start soon at a plant in the Sichuan province capital of Chengdu , U.S. officials said . The plane ' s deployment is seen as a major step_in Beijing ' s effort to modernize its air_force , and some observers believe it has negative implications for China ' s longstanding rival , Taiwan . &quot; This plane would fit_in with a scenario for ( conflict over ) Taiwan 10 years from now , &quot; one U.S._government expert said . &quot; And for someone to help the Chinese build a production_line , a turnkey facility , for this aircraft is ominous. &quot; The U.S._government ' s confirmation of Israel ' s role in developing the new Chinese plane could create tensions between Washington and the Jewish state . The joint work_on the plane is the latest in a series of military projects in which Israel has helped China over the past 15 years . Although China ' s impending production of the Lavi-style fighter has been closely monitored and discussed in the U.S. intelligence community in recent months , White_House and State_Department officials say there has been no official diplomatic protest to Israel about it . Some Administration officials are said to believe the issue is of no great concern . While the plane represents a big step_forward for China , they say , it is based on 1980s-era technology and will not be placed in_service for several years . Marvin Klemow , vice_president for government affairs of Israeli Aircraft Industries International , the Washington subsidiary of Israel ' s state-owned export firm , denied that his company is transferring U.S. technology to China . &quot; IAI does not transfer any technology illegally . Any U.S. technology that requires a license ( from the United States ) , we apply for that license , &quot; Klemow said . &quot; And we have not applied for any license for any Lavi-associated technology for China. &quot; Klemow would not say whether his company is providing China with other , non-American aircraft technology from the Lavi project . &quot; We never confirm or deny who we do business with , &quot; he said . An official at the Israeli Embassy in Washington also denied that Israel had passed_on U.S. technology based on the Lavi . For several years , there was speculation that China and Israel were working together on a new plane based on technology from the Lavi project . But the first report that the plane is nearing production came_in November in a British aviation publication , Flight International . U.S. officials confirmed that report in recent interviews . &quot; The plane is in the prototype stage . The prototype has been built , &quot; one U.S. official said . &quot; It is a very capable aircraft . It uses extensive U.S. technology. &quot; The official said the combat fighter will be ready for flight-testing in about a year and will be in full service in China ' s air_force about a decade from now . The plane , which China intends to call the F-10 fighter , represents the latest in a prolonged effort by Beijing to obtain modern combat planes and to be able to manufacture them on its own soil . Most of China ' s current combat planes are 1960s-era aircraft based on Soviet designs . In 1986 , the Ronald Reagan_Administration agreed to provide modern-day electronics , navigation and radar equipment for some of those Chinese planes in a $ 550-million project called Peace Pearl . The project was suspended when the George_Bush Administration imposed sanctions on military sales to China after the 1989 Tian An Men Square crackdown . China , which became increasingly irritated by mounting costs associated with Peace Pearl , pulled_out of the deal in 1990 . It was_after Peace Pearl ' s cancellation that China turned_to Israel , apparently aiming to obtain indirectly some of the American-style military technology it could not obtain from the United States itself . The principal U.S. defense firm in the aborted Peace Pearl project , Grumman Corp. , was heavily involved in the Lavi project too , according to U.S. experts . By producing the new plane , China ' s once-antiquated air_force will take a quantum leap forward , U.S. officials said . &quot; Right now , China can ' t establish air superiority even over China itself . India has a better air_force than China does , &quot; one U.S. official said . &quot; But 10 years from now , China will be able to establish air superiority over all_of China ' s territory , and also over the periphery of China , in places like Vietnam and the South China Sea. &quot; China has made extensive territorial claims in the South_China_Sea , particularly in the Spratly Islands , many of which are claimed by other countries in the region , including Vietnam and Taiwan . Two years ago , in the first big step toward modernization of its air_force , China bought 26 Sukhoi-27 advanced jet fighters from Russia . U.S. experts said the Russian planes have a longer range than the F-10 China is about to build . But the F-10 will be faster and will have a greater ability to intercept enemy aircraft . &quot; A competent air_force would need both of them , just like we have the F-16s and F-15s , &quot; one U.S. official said . &quot; The SU-27 fits for a scenario involving the Spratlys . The F-10 would fit_in better with a scenario for Taiwan 10 years from now. &quot; Unlike the SU-27 deal , in which China simply purchased jet fighters made in Russia , the new project with Israel will give China the ability to manufacture its own advanced jet fighters . According to Flight International , officials of Israel Aircraft Industries have helped guide the way for the Chinese air_force to develop and produce the plane under a contract signed_in 1992 . Over the past 15 years , China has established itself as the biggest customer for Israel ' s arms export industry . The first public demonstration of this cooperation came_in a Chinese National Day parade in 1984 when foreign military_attaches in Beijing were surprised to find Israeli guns , cannons and electronic_equipment mounted on top of Chinese tanks . U.S. laws forbid Israel to pass_on to another country any military technology obtained directly from the United States . Any company that violates those laws can be suspended from doing military business in this country . But it is often difficult to prove conclusively that U.S. technology has been re-exported , because a foreign government or company can claim that it has changed the U.S. technology or has produced something similar on its own . In 1992 , U.S. intelligence agencies reported that Israel might have transferred Patriot missile technology to China in violation of American laws . A State_Department team found there was not enough evidence to support the charge , and a department spokesman said the case is closed . At the same time , State_Department Inspector_General Sherman Funk reported that a leading recipient of American military technology , separately identified as Israel , had engaged in a &quot; systematic and growing problem of unauthorized transfers &quot; of U.S. technology to other countries . A congressional staff_member suggested recently that the U.S._government might have quietly accepted or encouraged Israel ' s decision to help build the Chinese plane -- in_effect using Israel as a proxy to supply China with military technology that the United States can ' t provide directly to Beijing . &quot; The question is , was there a conscious decision on the part of someone in Washington to let this happen ? &quot; he asked . Other officials insist , however , that transfers of the Lavi technology to China are not something the United States wants or accepts . Chen Guoqing , a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington , declined to comment on the production of the new aircraft .</TEXT>
