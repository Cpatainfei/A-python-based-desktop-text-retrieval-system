   <HEADLINE> SHARING THE WORD ON AIDS ; TECHNOLOGY : PATIENTS AND OTHERS CAN COUNT ON SISTER MARY ELIZABETH ' S ELECTRONIC BULLETIN_BOARD IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO TO PROVIDE EXTENSIVE INFORMATION FOR FREE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like any good fisherman , Sister Mary Elizabeth rises early -- 4 a.m. -- for her day ' s catch . At a powerful computer in her home here , she casts her net to Washington and across the sea , drawing_in the latest research findings and other information that could help people afflicted with AIDS . &quot; People need information to take_care of themselves , &quot; said Sister Mary , who founded her electronic_bulletin_board in 1990 to provide a free service for people who are isolated by their disease and cannot afford to access for-profit computer information networks . The bulletin_board , with 144 # 000 electronic files that include all_the AIDS-related contents of the Washington-based National Library of Medicine and the Atlanta-based Centers_for_Disease_Control , is considered one of the most comprehensive depositories of AIDS information in the world . Moreover , it is the hub of a North_American network called AIDS Education General Information_System , or AEGIS , sending information electronically to 100 other AIDS bulletin_boards scattered throughout the United States and Canada . And it shares data daily with overseas AIDS computer_networks serving Europe , Asia , Africa and Australia . While there are other AIDS databanks , those who use Sister Mary ' s system say it is extraordinary because it is free , easy to use and extremely comprehensive . The San Juan Capistrano system ' s four telephone_lines operate around the clock , seven days a week , fielding 50 to 100 calls daily . Its 2 # 000 registered users include people afflicted with acquired immune deficiency syndrome , as well as scientists , physicians and officials of federal organizations such_as the Veterans Administration and the Office of National AIDS Policy Coordination . &quot; I use it to keep_up with what is going_on in the world , &quot; said Nancy Hazleton , the Office of National AIDS Policy Coordination ' s global coordinator . &quot; If I need information about what is happening in Thailand , I can shoot a message through the network system ' s e-mail. &quot; Hazleton is not alone in relying_on the system ' s bulletin_boards . Sister Mary , who is a computer_expert , specifically designed it so people with AIDS could , by signing_on by name or anonymously , seek advice , talk with AIDS patients and advocates worldwide , or just eavesdrop to ease their loneliness . On a recent day last week , Robin of San Francisco asked_for information on what to do about night sweats and learned from Kevin of British_Columbia , Canada , that using bedsheets woven with natural_fibers such_as cotton and silk is helpful . Doug Segur is a former bartender with AIDS who taps into the databank and dialogue to supplement the AIDS electronic_bulletin_board he operates in Pittsburgh , Pa . &quot; It is nice to hobnob with ( people with AIDS ) , people who care and have an understanding of what you are going_through , &quot; Segur said . Billi Goldberg , a retired civil_engineer and AIDS activist in San Francisco , said she regularly feeds research information into AEGIS . &quot; Instead of being in a vacuum , &quot; she said , &quot; you have people talking to people . We have had a lot of heated debates about AZT and alternative treatments like ozone and DNCB , herbs and vitamins. &quot; When Tomas Fabregas learned a_few months ago that a virus associated with AIDS was attacking his eyes , he signed_on to the San Juan Capistrano bulletin_board from his San Francisco home . In doing so , he found_out that a Bay Area hospital was experimenting with a promising treatment for the infection , which causes blindness . The 35-year-old Fabregas joined the hospital experiment and had time-release drugs surgically implanted in both eyes . The virus , called cytomegalovirus retinitis , has been suppressed , saving his eyesight . &quot; It was so empowering to find through a phone_call this mass of information , &quot; he said , adding that the computer bulletin_boards and database enable him to work with his own doctor in finding life-extending treatments . Sometimes , users of the system say , the network posts important new medical information before most physicians learn about it . &quot; Physicians today don ' t have the time to read everything that comes_across their desk because of the rapid changes taking_place in treatment techniques , &quot; Sister Mary said . One patient discovered that he was suffering a harmful side_effect from mixing drugs when he read a report that AEGIS had just copied from the National Library of Medicine . As it turned_out , the report had not yet been published in the professional reference_book that his doctor used . At the helm of the information network is Sister Mary , who dedicates her days to exchanging and organizing data . The soft-spoken woman , whose office walls are covered with community service awards and dominated by a crucifix , said she wants to help AIDS patients be healthier and teach everyone how to stop the spread of the incurable and deadly disease . &quot; The system here is the largest ( AIDS ) database in the world , &quot; she said , patting two powerful computers she keeps_in her modest mobile_home , which doubles as her office . Sister Mary stirred controversy in 1988 when , in an action independent of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles ( which includes Orange County ) , she took her first vows in a San Clemente Episcopal church and announced her plans to create a religious_order to serve the homeless and other outcasts of society . Aside from failing to follow religious protocol , there is another factor that makes her bid for recognition by the Episcopal Diocese highly unusual : She is a transsexual . She still hopes for formal acceptance by the diocese as a sister . The sex change brought notoriety earlier in her life . As a man , she served in the Navy as Chief_Petty_Officer Michael Clark . After the sex change operation in 1975 , she enlisted in the Army Reserve as Sgt . 1st_Class Joanna M . Clark . When the surgery was discovered , she was dishonorably discharged . In 1982 , however , she won $ 25 # 000 and an honorable discharge in a legal settlement of a lawsuit she filed against the Army in Washington . Sister Mary , 55 , said she launched the computer information service in 1990 after a trip to rural Missouri , where she saw those with AIDS who were geographically isolated . They were unable to talk_about their disease on the telephone for fear that they would be overheard on party_lines and ostracized in their communities . &quot; This is what God wanted me to do , &quot; she said about her work in creating an AIDS information network . To pay the $ 20 # 000 a year to maintain her computer service without charging any user fees , she accepts contributions and takes part-time jobs as a computer consultant . The mobile_home where she lives and works belongs_to her parents and she observes a vow of poverty . She is determined to keep her service free , because people with AIDS who need the information are often financially devastated by medical_bills , she said . While Sister Mary makes her databank available to the 100 other electronic_bulletin_boards in the AEGIS system , she said many people dial into her system directly because it contains more extensive research material . In addition to her work_on the computer_network , she has also lobbied to make government information free to the AIDS community . Outraged that the National Library of Medicine required a hefty fee to access its AIDS database , she enlisted the help of Vice_President Al Gore , and members of her network sent protest letters to Kristine Gebbie , the national AIDS policy coordinator . As a result , the medical library in January dropped public charges for AIDS files . Sister Mary believes her computer bank would not be necessary if the federal_government did a better job of collecting and disseminating AIDS information . Federal agencies that have electronic_bulletin_boards , she said , have outdated and incomplete AIDS data or are technically difficult to access . &quot; The government has the money and has made a commitment to the information highway , but they have not made the same commitment to AIDS , &quot; she said . And while she finds many rewards in her work , Sister Mary conceded that her job carries a depressing burden . &quot; The difficult part for me is you get_to know the people , &quot; she said . &quot; You get used to their keystrokes and the personality that comes_through . You chat with them and then one day they are no longer there . &quot; The happiest day of my life will be when I can shut the system down and say it is no longer needed. &quot;</TEXT>
