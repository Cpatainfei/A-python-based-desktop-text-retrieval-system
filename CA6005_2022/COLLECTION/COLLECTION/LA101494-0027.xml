   <HEADLINE> NOBEL ' S MODEST LEGACY ; FOR SOUTHLAND ' S LAUREATES , THE THRILL OF WINNING COMES IN SMALL WAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What becomes a Nobel laureate most ? A new Porsche ? A sailing yacht ? How about a trip around the world ? Not quite . A more modest and unusual legacy has awaited Southern California ' s Nobel Prize_winners -- a small fraternity that grew by one this week when USC chemistry professor George A . Olah claimed the world ' s top intellectual honor . For men of such achievement , the thrill of the award comes_in small ways -- like acquiring that new parking_space closer to the lab , buying a long-enduring wife a new watch or putting_away some money for the kids . When Caltech chemist Rudolph Marcus returned to work after his 1992 Nobel , one would have hardly known his life had changed . Marcus remained so remarkably focused_on his study of energy storage that colleagues quipped that he &quot; must have spent his million dollars on a new sweater. &quot; One colleague said he spotted Marcus one day not long after his return from Stockholm parking his car in a space , newly marked with his name and just outside his office . &quot; He said to me ' Well , the Nobel Prize has to be worth something , ' &quot; recalled Stephen Mayo , an assistant_professor of biology . Indeed , Marcus still walks to work most days from his home near Caltech ' s Pasadena campus . He still drives a clunky 1978 Oldsmobile and reports proudly that his wife , Laura , met King Carl Gustav XVI at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences she was wearing a dress that a friend sewed for her . Most of his $ 1.2 million in winnings sits in investments or in the bank . ( He notes , in fact , that the prize had lost 20 % of its value by the time he received his check because of a rapid devaluation of the Swedish_krona . ) The flood of speaking requests and other offers has been so heavy that Marcus has had to take_on an extra secretary half-time just to handle them all . &quot; It ' s best if one doesn ' t think too_much about prizes and things , &quot; Marcus said . &quot; That puts the focus in the wrong place , which should be_on your work . . . on a particular problem and how you should solve it. &quot; If he has made one resolution in his two years since winning the prize , Marcus said it is to get better at saying &quot; no. &quot; &quot; The big question you have to answer is whether you want to turn_into a traveling salesman , or whether to use your time to produce something valuable and something new , &quot; Marcus said . &quot; I like to answer questions. &quot; UCLA ' s Donald Cram shares much the same philosophy and , for years , has loathed the tendency of some Nobel prize_winners to leave their scientific roots and wander off in other directions . He calls Linus Pauling , a onetime hero , a &quot; fallen angel &quot; for leaving the work that brought him a Nobel Prize in chemistry to promote , among other things , world peace and the curative values of Vitamin_C . &quot; I have looked_on the Nobel Prize as an opportunity to do more of what I enjoy and what I am good at and that is science , &quot; said Cram , who received the honor in 1987 for his work in chemistry . &quot; That is the central core of my life . It ' s not a youthful fashion . It is something that has stayed around. &quot; The 75-year-old scientist -- whose colorful bow_ties and guitar concerts are legend at UCLA -- said that most of the time it is easy to remain true_to that central core . When a Korean newspaper association , for instance , wrote to him with a novel proposal , Cram knew he was out of his ken . The association wanted him to join a team of Nobel Prize_winners to rewrite the Ten Commandments . &quot; Something just didn ' t fit there , &quot; said Cram , laughing . As for his financial prize , Cram was not as big a winner as those in recent years . His $ 180 # 000 in winnings reflect the fact he shared the chemistry award with two others and that the bequest of Alfred Nobel has experienced a remarkable increase in value in recent years . Not that Cram hasn ' t put the money to good use . The professor this year bought a home overlooking Orange County ' s Monarch Bay , in part_with his prize_money . From there , he can see as far as the San Onofre beaches and the beloved waves where he has surfed for 40 years . But Cram insists that it is the non-material rewards that have been the most valuable to him . He doesn ' t have to teach classes anymore . He can attract grants now without the old strain and lure colleagues from all_over the world to join his research team . &quot; It has extended my scientific life , &quot; Cram said . And , most happily for him , Cram said the award brought long overdue recognition to his wife and longtime collaborator , Jane . He used the award money to act_on a long-delayed urge to buy Jane a gold watch , too . Although Cram laughingly admits that even on that extravagance , he sought_out the best buy that he could . &quot; I was raised in Vermont , &quot; he said . &quot; Money doesn ' t circulate very frequently in New England and particularly in Vermont. &quot; The area ' s third and senior surviving laureate is 1983 physics prize_winner William A . Fowler who , like Marcus , lives within walking distance of the Caltech campus where he worked for many years . * Now a professor emeritus , he gave two-thirds of his $ 90 # 000 award to two daughters and put the rest into the bank and investments . He had already retired by the time the prize came and a bad back and other ailments have long since led him to give_up the lecture circuit . But even Fowler likes to keep a hand in the old game . Fowler sightings are still a remarkable event on campus and his Nobel status allows him to keep_on an assistant on campus who comes_to his Pasadena home each afternoon to retrieve letters to be typed and to deliver the latest research papers . The 83-year old notes wistfully that a whole new field of nuclear study has opened_up recently and that he still has a_few ideas floating around . &quot; I ' m still hoping to get a second one , &quot; he sighed . &quot; You never know. &quot;</TEXT>
