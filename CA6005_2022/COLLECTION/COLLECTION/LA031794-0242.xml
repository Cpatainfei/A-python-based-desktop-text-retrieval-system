   <HEADLINE> 2ND COLON_CANCER GENE FOUND ; TESTS EXPECTED SOON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the discovery of a second colon_cancer gene , researchers reported Wednesday that they now have identified the causes of more_than 90 % of the inherited form of the disease . Between them , the two genes are responsible_for one in every six of the 156 # 000 new cases of colon_cancer diagnosed each year . They also appear to account_for as_many as 30 % of sporadic ( non-inherited ) cases of colon_cancer . Researchers expect within a_few months to develop diagnostic tests that will show whether an individual has either gene . If one of the genes is present , doctors can monitor for tumors frequently , enabling their detection while they are still curable by surgery . &quot; We can reduce cancer deaths in these families by over 90 % , &quot; said Dr. Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University , a co-leader of one of the two groups that report the discovery today in the_British journal Nature and Friday in Science . The discovery could also lead to new anti-cancer drugs within three to five years , predicted microbiologist Richard Fishel of the University of Vermont , a leader of the other team , which reported its findings in Nature . &quot; I am very confident that in short order we will be able to develop appropriate therapeutics based on our knowledge of these genes , &quot; he said . The same two teams reported the discovery of the first colon_cancer gene in December . Both genes , which are found on different chromosomes , act like the spell-check function in a word_processing program , checking newly synthesized DNA to ensure that no mistakes -- mutations -- occur during cellular proliferation . When either gene is defective , &quot; you accumulate these alterations at an extremely high rate and cancer is the result , &quot; said Fishel . Inherited colon_cancer usually strikes before the age of 50 . &quot; This is a great triumph for science , &quot; said Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala . &quot; These discoveries . . . will lead to screening tests for high-risk individuals soon . Doctors will be able to save countless lives and prevent much needless suffering. &quot; Shalala also raised the concern , shared by the researchers , that screening for the genes could sharply impair the ability of carriers -- people who have the genes -- to purchase health_insurance . Because virtually everyone who has the genes will develop cancer , carriers might be excluded from coverage . About one in every 200 people has one of the defective genes , Vogelstein said , making_it the most common genetic defect in the world . Both groups said they have tentatively identified a third gene that accounts_for most of the remaining 5 % to 10 % of inherited colon_cancer , formally called hereditary nonpolyposis colon_cancer . In 1991 , other scientists announced the discovery of a gene that causes a rarer form of inherited colon_cancer , called familial adenomatous polyposis , that accounts_for perhaps 1 % of all cases of colon_cancer . Researchers know a great_deal about how the two genes work because Fishel and colleague Richard Kolodner , a geneticist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston , have studied virtually identical genes in bacteria and yeast for nearly 20 years . In bacteria , the genes produce two proteins that carry_out the &quot; spell-check &quot; function . The first protein scans newly synthesized DNA to check for any errors that have occurred during its synthesis . If an error is found , the second protein binds to the first and repairs the error . If the first gene is defective , mistakes in DNA formation are not recognized . If the second gene is defective , mistakes are not repaired . Either way , mistakes accumulate until a cancer_cell is formed . The researchers are confident an identical process occurs with the human genes , but that has not been proved . The quick discovery of the human genes , Fishel said in an interview , came_about because of the extensive knowledge that had already been compiled about the bacterial genes , a classic example of basic research as opposed to applied . &quot; This discovery is a coup for the basic research process in the United States , &quot; noted Dr. George Vande Woude of the National Cancer Institute . Both groups are actively developing laboratory tests that could be used to screen members of affected families . That process is complicated , Fishel said , because at least a dozen different mutations of the new gene have been identified and each has to be taken_into_account in any potential screen . The test is expected to initially cost about $ 1 # 000 , about the same as the colonoscopy now used to search for colon tumors . Such testing will be most appropriate in families where at least three members have been diagnosed with colon or rectal tumors within two generations . Fishel said the testing should be conducted &quot; as early as possible , &quot; preferably shortly after birth , because the cancer can strike in the teens . Carriers can also adjust their lifestyle -- adopting a diet low in fat and high in fiber , for example -- to reduce risks . The cost of the screening is expected to decline with increased use , eventually permitting the test to be applied to the whole population . There is some evidence that the genes may play a role in other cancers as well , including those of the lungs , intestine , uterus and ovaries . Such tumors occur at a high rate in families with a history of colon_cancer , and defective versions of the genes have been identified in some of these tumors from individuals . Gene carriers would also be monitored for the development of these types of tumors .</TEXT>
