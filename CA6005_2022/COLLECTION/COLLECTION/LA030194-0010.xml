   <HEADLINE> AIDS PREVENTION FOR TEENS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * This is in reference_to your Feb . 17 editorial , &quot; Get the Information Out ! &quot; As a graduate of Glendale ' s Hoover High_School , I am horrified and disgusted by the news that the neighborhood which I remember as so intelligent , and particularly its school_board , seems to be unwilling to use every possible means to fight the AIDS epidemic . I realize that sexual_activity and orientation are subjects much too &quot; human &quot; and &quot; delicate &quot; for some adults to even discuss , but the agonizing ( and expensive ) death of people at the point where society is just beginning to obtain a return on its investment in their lives should , at the very least , be looked_at as a gigantic economic problem . Will the response be as pussyfooted if the present rise in tuberculosis becomes epidemic ? CHARLES W . FOX Mission Viejo * Abstinence is the answer to stop the spread of AIDS , but when one is dealing with teen-agers -- who are in the age of experimentation -- one needs to inform them of the dangers of the disease . In my junior year at Norwalk High_School , Kaiser Permanente staged its play , &quot; Secrets , &quot; on our campus . I found the play to be responsible by stressing abstinence , yet the play discussed the use of condoms as protection if one chooses to experiment with sex . It is difficult to believe that Glendale school district officials are willing to jeopardize students ' health . It is a fact that high_school students are having_sex . I am not promoting promiscuity , but what I am saying is that if teen-agers choose to become sexually active , they should at least be aware of how to protect themselves from a deadly disease . KAREN D . CARRANZA Los Angeles * Teen-agers are sexually active . Like it or not ! I cannot believe that the Glendale school_board refuses to face facts and promote the proper use of condoms . The play &quot; Secrets &quot; could save some young lives . I agree that abstinence is the very best preventive method for any sexually transmitted disease . As president of Being Alive South Bay , in speaking with young people , I repeat that message time and time again . After clearly stating that , I then state , if , however , your choice is sexual_activity , never even think_about it without a condom properly used . I can only say to the Glendale school_board : Take a reality pill ! GARY VROOMAN Carson</TEXT>
