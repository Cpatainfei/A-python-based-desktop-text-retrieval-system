   <HEADLINE> POLITICS : PAY RAISE FOR THE LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ironically , the first newspaper_article I read about the $ 20 # 000 pay raise being given to California ' s lawmakers was reported on the same page as news that our state ' s unemployment_rate had risen a full percentage_point in the last month . It ' s hard to envision a group of employees less deserving of a pay hike than the politicians representing us in Sacramento.California ' s economy continues to falter and a_million residents can ' t find a job to support themselves or their families . And businesses continue to flee California , taking jobs with them . Our economic plight can be traced to the openly hostile , anti-business attitude of our state Legislature , which has raised almost every tax on the books and added thousands of pages of regulations in the past few years . Yet our elected leaders continue to look elsewhere for solutions , refusing to admit that they are the cause of our economic troubles . Accepting a pay raise in the middle of economic tough times is a slap in the face to California ' s taxpayers . Unfortunately , our Assembly representative Betty Karnette is silently accepting the raise , toeing the line for her mentor , Assembly Speaker Willie Brown ( who actually wants a larger pay raise ) . I ' m running_for election to the state Assembly because I ' m fed up with the nonsense , and I believe I can make a positive contribution in Sacramento , not because I want to line my pockets with taxpayer money . I ' ve pledged not to accept the $ 20 # 000 pay hike . I hope my opponents will do the same . JEFF EARLE Rolling Hills Estates</TEXT>
