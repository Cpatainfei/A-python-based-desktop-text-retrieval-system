   <HEADLINE> THE WEEK AHEAD : WASHINGTON ; KEY VISIT FOR RABIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin originally planned as a routine visit to Washington next week could prove to be pivotal in the Middle_East peace process as Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization attempt to bring their negotiations on Palestinian self-government to a conclusion . In the wake of the Hebron massacre , Rabin trimmed what was to have been a visit of 10 days to just four.However , his advisers suggested Monday that , during the visit , he might be able to sign an agreement with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat on implementing the accord reached in Washington six months ago . Even without a new agreement to sign with the PLO , Rabin ' s visit has become a deadline for resolving issues in domestic politics . Among these issues are broadening his minority government before he leaves , and in economic_policy , how to spend the funds raised under U.S.-guaranteed loans . Under present plans , Rabin leaves Jerusalem next Monday and returns Friday .</TEXT>
