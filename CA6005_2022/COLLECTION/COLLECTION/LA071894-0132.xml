   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FINAL ; TEAM LEFT WITH NO SMILES -- OR APOLOGIES ; ITALY : PLAYERS BELIEVE THEY FINISHED SECOND TO NONE AFTER LOSING CHAMPIONSHIP ON PENALTY KICKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> La commedia e finita . The drama is ended , but it was the curtain that fell -- not the sky -- on Italy ' s dream of a world soccer championship Sunday . Two missed penalty kicks spelled the difference after a 120-minute standoff across a green field where the temperature reached 97 degrees . It was an artificial end for an organic game , and if there were tears of frustration on the field , there were no apologies afterward by the Italians . &quot; We did everything we could . We have to accept the result with tranquillity , &quot; Italian Coach Arrigo Sacchi said . &quot; I would be happy to repeat the experience . We should not look_for alibis . We failed at penalty kicks. &quot; There weren ' t any smiles after the game , but no heads hanging either . &quot; A shootout is like a lottery . You never know who will win , &quot; said Italian captain Franco Baresi , who , like Roberto Baggio , hit his shot over the net . Waiting for the team bus , Baggio swept_up his 4-year-old daughter and clutched her tight , playing kissing games , looking happier than he ever did on the field in USA ' 94 . Her baseball_cap was_on backward too . Like the Brazilians who won , the Italians who lost are professionals . To have lost on the field might have hurt ; to have lost on penalty kicks simply stung . &quot; We played 120 minutes , exhausted at the end of a long tournament . It ' s a shame to end on penalty kicks like this , &quot; midfielder Roberto Donadoni said . &quot; Losing this way is sad , but I believe we come_out of this game second to nobody. &quot; Said Brazilian goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel , a veteran of the Italian first division : &quot; Of course a penalty-kick decision doesn ' t mean that the best team will win . Nobody likes a penalty kick decision. &quot; The irony of a penalty-kick defeat was not lost on anybody in Italy , where a semifinal shootout against Argentina ended Italian championship hopes in Italia ' 90 . &quot; There has to be a world champion , or else we would have tied . We have to accept the rules with a great serenity . But today I felt we played a championships caliber match , &quot; Sacchi said . &quot; When I am old I can say that I lost the championship on penalty kicks. &quot; Baresi , who returned from a leg injury as part of a stout Italian defense that again and again frustrated Brazil with some of the best individual play of the day , left the game with cramps a_few minutes before the end . He returned to kick Italy ' s first penalty shot because Sacchi asked him to . &quot; The few times we have gone_to penalties , he was the first one to shoot , &quot; Sacchi explained . Although Italy lacked the flair of its last two games against Spain and Bulgaria , Sacchi thought his Azzurri played even against the pressing Brazilians : &quot; A very balanced match that could have gone either way , &quot; he said . In a way , Italy ' s defeat was far less dramatic than the last-gasp victories that brought it as far as the Rose Bowl Sunday . Among the pre-Cup favorites for its heritage and the quality of its players , the Italian team stuttered under Sacchi . It qualified for USA ' 94 with great difficulty and then played indifferently in the first round , finishing third in a division the Italians expected to win . In second-round play and the quarterfinals , it took last-minute operatics by Baggio to get past Nigeria and Spain before a semifinal breather against Bulgaria . &quot; We almost seemed destined to end_up like this , in a penalty shootout . To lose this way is disappointing , to miss so many , &quot; said goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca , who stopped the first penalty shot against him but was beaten by the next three . Said Donadoni : &quot; I never thought anyone would miss . Bad luck. &quot; &quot; I was there in body and spirit for the penalty . I don ' t know why I sent it over , &quot; Baggio said . Even in defeat , Sacchi , a coach who thrives on unpredictability has made believers of his hyper-critical countrymen . Early in the tournament , more_than 80 % of them were telling pollsters he should be fired . Now , though , Italy can return with honor and the prospect of more demanding innovation from Sacchi , whose contract lasts another two years . As the Italians filed thoughtfully from the stadium Sunday , fullback Antonio Benarrivo wrote the epitaph : &quot; We ' re not_bad . We ' re good . We showed our class . Tomorrow we start anew. &quot;</TEXT>
