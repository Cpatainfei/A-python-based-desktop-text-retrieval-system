   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / SEMIFINALS ; FAN-TASTIC SEMIFINALS ; SWEDISH FANS CRY AMID SEA OF HAPPY BRAZILIANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Five minutes after the game ended , the Brazilians were laughing and cheering and doing the samba in the parking_lot outside the 14 Below bar in Santa Monica . And Osa Bjurestam was standing there with tears running_down the blue and yellow Swedish flag painted on her right cheek . &quot; Of course I ' m sad , &quot; said Bjurestam , late of Stockholm , currently of Century City , who with a_couple_of Swedish friends had chosen to watch the Sweden-Brazil World Cup semifinal game in , of all places , a bar packed with Brazilian fans . She tried to say more , but couldn ' t . She didn ' t really need to . The tears said it all . Bjurestam , 28 , and her friends represented the sole Swedish contingent in the 14 Below , a tiny island of Swedishness amid a sea of Brazilian yellow and green . They had gone_to the bar , which is co-owned by a Brazilian , to watch the game because it ' s their usual watering_hole , and because they like the passionate way Brazilians watch soccer . &quot; I respect the Brazilians a lot , &quot; said Bjurestam , an interior_design student . &quot; They are like a living legend . And we ( the Swedes and Brazilians ) all get_along very well. &quot; Besides , according to Elisabeth Kihlberg , press officer for the Swedish Consulate in Los Angeles , there weren ' t really any organized plans among the estimated 25 # 000 Swedes in the Los Angeles area to do anything special , except go_to the game at the Rose Bowl or watch it on TV . &quot; Swedish people by tradition are more reserved &quot; than some_other soccer fans , she said . So for two hours Bjurestam and her friends stood together in the packed , sweltering 14 Below bar , bombarded by the relentless beat of samba drums . Every now and then the dozen or so Sweden supporters -- among them a German , a Swiss and an Austrian -- tried to respond with chants of &quot; Sweden ! Sweden ! Sweden ! &quot; But they were good-naturedly drowned_out by the Brazilians . Swedish hopes were high at the beginning . &quot; I think we have a very good chance , &quot; said Eva Turesson , 31 , a Swedish native currently living_in Manhattan Beach . &quot; They ' ve played pretty well . I ' m going_to be very disappointed if they lose. &quot; But the Swedes lost . When Brazil scored the game ' s lone goal in the second_half , the bar erupted in shouts of joy -- except for the Swedes , who looked sadder than an Ingmar Bergman movie . When it was over , they tried to put the best face on it . They pointed_out that Sweden had gotten farther along in the World Cup than anyone really had expected . They also pointed_out that Sweden ' s Queen Silvia is half-Brazilian on her mother ' s side , so a victory for Brazil was sort of a quasi-victory for Sweden as well .</TEXT>
