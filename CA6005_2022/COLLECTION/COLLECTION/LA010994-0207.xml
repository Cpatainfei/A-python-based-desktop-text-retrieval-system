   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; VO NGUYEN GIAP ; THE MAN WHO LED THE TET OFFENSIVE NOW TALKS OF U.S.-VIETNAM TRADE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For close to 50 years , Vietnam ' s revolutionary leaders and the United States have had a complex and troubled relationship of extremes . In 1944 , there was strong U.S. support for those who sought Vietnam ' s independence from the_French . But soon after , Washington became an opponent of the communist-led revolution , with an intensity that far exceeded the strength of its initial support . By the 1960s , that intensity , now fueled by vehement anti-communism , led America into the longest war in its history . Now , 20 years after the Vietnam_War , leaders in Washington and Hanoi are finally talking_about opening trade relations . Until recently , Vietnam ' s economy was in desperate condition , in part due_to self-imposed difficulties but also to U.S. refusal to open economic and diplomatic relations . Lifting the embargo would be an important step_in accelerating Vietnam ' s nascent economic_growth . Throughout these 50 years , one man has remained at the center of events . He is Vo Nguyen Giap , 82 , who founded Vietnam ' s revolutionary armed forces in 1944 . He was at Ho Chi Minh ' s side when the communist leader declared Vietnam ' s independence in 1945 . Also at Ho ' s side were U.S. army_officers who had provided critical support to Ho , Giap and their revolutionary colleagues in their bid to establish an independent Vietnam . Twenty years later , the U.S. army would feel the wrath of Giap ' s response to U . S . military intervention in Vietnam . In the 1968 Tet Offensive , Giap devastated the U.S. psychologically by orchestrating simultaneous military attacks on 68 locations . He had inflicted the same sort of psychological damage on the_French in the trenches at Dien Bein Phu , 14 years earlier . Giap ' s success during the Vietnam_War was enhanced by his understanding of America -- his relationships with U.S. officers during the 1940s were a profound experience for him and continue to be a reference_point even today . Sitting in a conference_room at Vietnam ' s National Institute for Development Studies , which he chairs , Giap feels quite comfortable quoting Jefferson -- here , as always , following the example set by Ho . * Question : Vietnam ' s leaders have called_for the lifting of the U.S. economic embargo and re-establishment of trade and diplomatic relations . Why does Vietnam want this ? Answer : Lifting the embargo will be good for both the U.S. and Vietnam . Many U.S. businesses want to invest in Vietnam because they find attractive opportunities here . Numerous representatives of U.S. business are already here in anticipation of the embargo being lifted . Despite the limitations imposed by the embargo on their activities , the presence of U.S. businesses here demonstrates their belief that the opportunities in Vietnam are very large . Foreign investment in Vietnam is increasing rapidly . Major investments have been made by Taiwan , Hong Kong , Australia , South_Korea , France and China . Vietnam welcomes this investment , because we need it to increase the pace of our economic_growth . We hope that the U.S. will join with the other leading nations of the world in participating in Vietnam ' s economic future . To paraphrase on old saying , &quot; Those who are late will suffer the disadvantage. &quot; Recognizing this disadvantage , President Clinton issued regulations that allow a small opening for U.S. businessmen to enter Vietnam . President Clinton has the authority to open full diplomatic and trade relations with Vietnam . I call_on him to do so . . . . . The embargo policy is out of date . The time has come for us to put the past behind us and to work together for a better future for both our peoples . * Q : In the United States , there continues to be concern about the U.S. servicemen missing in action . How is this issue regarded in Vietnam , and what is being done to respond to U.S. concerns ? A : I want to emphasize most sincerely that I do understand the concerns of American families whose loved ones were missing in action . In response to those concerns , the Vietnam government has done its best to help find information about those missing in action . . . . Vietnam regards the MIA issue as a humanitarian concern and not a political issue affecting the normalization of trade and diplomatic relations . The reason we regard the MIA issue as a humanitarian concern is because we are looking_for our own MIA . Our MIA are nearly several hundred times the number of the American MIA . ( More_than 300 # 000 Vietnamese are missing in action. ) . . . . Vietnamese families also grieve about those they have lost , and they seek all available information , just as American families do . . . . Because we share a common problem , Vietnam and the U.S. can benefit by pursuing a common solution . . . . American representatives are free to go anywhere and to contact anyone concerning MIA ( s ) . We have cooperated , and we will continue to cooperate , with U.S. representatives , because we want as much information as possible to be obtained . I have personally met with numerous American representatives about the MIA problem -- including Gen . John Vessey and other veterans . This matter is a personal concern of mine . In return , we hope that American representatives will want to help Vietnam find information about our own MIAs . . . . Our problem is so_much larger that a small amount of American help can go_a_long_way toward helping Vietnam with its MIA problem . President Clinton ' s Administration has already given us valuable information about those Vietnamese missing in action who were fighting for the former Saigon government . This has been helpful but we need more information we believe the U.S._government has about this matter . . . . So we ask President Clinton to help us with whatever additional information can be obtained about the MIAs from the Saigon armed forces , as well as any information that the U.S._government may have about our own MIAs . . . . But the important point is that both nations stand to benefit by working together in a common humanitarian effort . . . . The common pursuit of MIA information should be another positive reason why establishing trade and diplomatic relations can be beneficial to both nations . The closer the relations between our two countries , the greater our cooperation can be in obtaining information about MIAs of both nations . . . . * Q : What is your vision of the future of Vietnam ? A : My vision of the future is based on the perspective of the past . In the past , our greatest challenge was the invasion of our nation by foreigners . As long as foreigners dominated us , we could not determine our own destiny , nor could we deal with our most pressing problems . Now that Vietnam is independent and united we can address our biggest challenge . That challenge is poverty and economic backwardness . Vietnam is a poor country but its people are rich_in spirit . My vision of the future is one in which the rich spirit of the Vietnamese people will cause our nation to prosper . . . . . You have come_to Hanoi on the 21st anniversary of the U.S. Christmas bombing of our capital city . This bombing destroyed the Bach Mai Hospital . I was in Hanoi at the time of the raid . In the many years of U.S. bombing prior to the Christmas raid , I thought that Americans wanted to make our country look_like a moonscape . With the Christmas air_raid , I began to feel that the target had become the spirit of the Vietnamese people , especially those in Hanoi . Although the Vietnamese people had withstood many challenges over many centuries , the Christmas air_raid of 1972 was a new and formidable difficulty . While I was confident that the spirit of the Vietnamese people would prevail , I looked_for signs of the demonstration of that spirit . Shortly after the Christmas air_raid , Price Sihanouk of Cambodia and his wife , Princess Monique , came_to visit Hanoi . I met them at the airport and escorted them into the city . As we drove from the airport , Prince Sihanouk said that he could see in the eyes of the people along the roadway a sense of pride and a optimistic spirit . . . . Vietnam is a nation that is several thousand years old . Our nation has survived because our culture is strong . The spirit of our people is strong . Fixed in the soul of every Vietnamese is the strong_belief that we will prosper . Some may call this social_psychology . But call it what you will , Vietnam will prevail in the future as in the past because of the spirit of our people . * Q : Looking_back , could conflict between the U.S. and Vietnam have been avoided ? A : This is a very complicated question , which is difficult to give a precise answer . At the end of World_War_II , Ho Chi Minh wanted peace , but France wanted to regain control over Vietnam after losing its position as a result of Japan ' s wartime occupation . France was prepared_for war to regain control . We Vietnamese wanted our independence and freedom . Prior to the collapse of Japanese authority in Vietnam in 1945 , U.S. Army_officers were sent to our country to help us prepare_for our independence . I especially recall Maj . ( Allison K. ) Thomas , who was a native of Michigan . Ho Chi Minh told Maj . Thomas and other American officers in our country , in 1945 , that he saw good relations with the U.S. after the end of World_War_II . Ho Chi Minh was initially correct . America did not support the_French return to Vietnam . But the American position changed in the 1950s with the adoption of the &quot; domino theory , &quot; in which the U.S. came_to believe that what happened in Vietnam would affect all_of Southeast_Asia . . . . Looking_back in history , there can be no doubt that an important opportunity for good relations between Vietnam and America existed at the end of World_War_II . Regrettably , this opportunity was missed . Now , nearly 50 years later , there is another important opportunity for good relations between Vietnam and America . Will a second important opportunity be lost ? Let us make_sure that this present opportunity is not lost . Let us make_sure that Vietnam and America work together to benefit the people of both of our countries . What lessons can be learned from the past relations between Vietnam and America ? It seems to me that there are three . First , do not go_to_war with a nation that is fighting for its independence . Since America fought its own war for independence , I believe Americans can agree with this lesson . Second , no matter how large a nation ' s military and economic power , there are always limits . Nations that recognize their limits , and act accordingly , are more likely to be successful . An arrogance of power has been the downfall of many great nations . No nation is immune to either the limits to power or the tendency to the arrogance of power . Recognizing the one and avoiding the other can be a lesson all nations should agree on . Third , whatever the policies of leaders of nations , it is ultimately the people who will decide . If leaders pursue wrong policies , the people will not follow . If leaders pursue right policies , the people will confirm their rightness by giving their support ; the more nations follow the decisions of their people , the more successful they will be .</TEXT>
