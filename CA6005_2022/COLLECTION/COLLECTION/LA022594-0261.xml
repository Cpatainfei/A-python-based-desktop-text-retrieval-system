   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; TURNER GETS GOLD , BUT NOT HANDSHAKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As if ice_skating needed more mayhem , America ' s Cathy Turner was mortified after winning the women ' s 500 meters in Olympic short-track speedskating Thursday night when the silver medalist from China refused to shake her hand while Chinese team leaders formally protested that Turner should give_back the gold medal . Also called &quot; the dirtiest skater in skating &quot; by a Canadian opponent after a preliminary race , Turner , 31 , of Rochester , N.Y. , was accused of fouling world record-holder Yanmei Zhang in the final . An unsmiling Zhang refused to acknowledge Turner on the victory stand , removed her silver medal as soon as she stepped_down and dropped her floral bouquet on the floor . Asked later if Turner was a dirty skater , Zhang , 21 , listened to a translator ' s interpretation of the question . &quot; Yes ! Yes ! &quot; she said in English . The translator said : &quot; She absolutely agrees. &quot; At that , Xiu Cheng Li , the Chinese team leader , made a long speech in which he claimed that after complaining to officials , then paying a fee to file a formal protest to have Turner ' s victory overturned , he was repeatedly ignored . Xiu said : &quot; We are very , very upset . The American skater very obviously pushed our skater . She , Cathy Turner , should not be given the gold medal , and we strongly require a fair judgment. &quot; Turner was shaken at first , then defiant . &quot; They ' re not taking my medal away , &quot; she declared . Nobody will . A Lillehammer Olympic official interrupted Turner at that point to say : &quot; We have asked the referees for a statement and they have said there is no statement to be made . Ms . Turner ' s victory stands. &quot; With that , Turner thrust up both fists . Her triumph , in the Olympic-record time of 45.98 seconds , gave consecutive gold medals to the colorful Turner -- she ' s a former lounge singer who once wrote a song called &quot; Kinky , Sexy Tomboy &quot; -- in this young but already chaotic sport . When short-track skating premiered in 1992 , Zhang was disqualified in the first heat , and Turner collided in the next with Sylvie Daigle of Canada , who vilified Turner ' s methods afterward . This time , Turner clicked skates in a preliminary with Canada ' s Nathalie Lambert , nearly causing both to wipe_out . Lambert lambasted her , not only calling Turner the dirtiest skater in skating but adding : &quot; I hope she gets what she deserves -- something bad. &quot; Were this a curse , then a three-skater pileup involving Turner in the semifinal appeared to be Lambert ' s revenge . Turner and two others went sprawling , and the accident could have been the American ' s fault . Instead , it was Isabelle Charest of Canada who was disqualified . Of the four women in this heat , three , including Turner , were permitted to start over . Turner won the rerun to advance to the final . There , trailing in the 4 1 / 2-lap race after three times around , Turner drifted outside like a race_car , then dive-bombed toward the inside in what has been called her &quot; kamikaze technique. &quot; She appeared to place a hand against Zhang ' s right shin as she passed her into first place . Zhang skated to all corners of the arena after the race , raising her right leg and pointing to the spot where Turner touched her . Turner said adamantly : &quot; How could I have reached_out and grabbed her when I was in front of her ? I went_in front of her and put my hand_down . Maybe I hit her leg when I put my hand_down on the ice , but I don ' t see how I could have reached_out and grabbed her. &quot; Lost in the hubbub was a bronze medal for America ' s Amy Peterson , who also took a bronze with Turner here a_few days ago in a relay event that ended with similar cries of outrage . In that one , China was disqualified from third place when a skater obstructed Nikki Ziegelmeyer , causing a crash . The American women learned 15 minutes after the race that they had been moved_up to third place . Turner doesn ' t know how much wilder things can get . &quot; For a minute there , I was saying , ' I just want to go_home , ' &quot; she said . Upon entering her news_conference , a happier Turner was intercepted by a team official who warned her about what was being said by the Chinese , who were still in the room . Turner turned_around and left . Through her translator , an angry Zhang was saying : &quot; I think a skater should use two legs , not three legs. &quot; By the time she and Turner traded places , Turner ' s first words were : &quot; I ' m a little scared right now. &quot; Someone asked , &quot; Of what ? &quot; &quot; Well , they ' re talking_about taking_away my medals . Then outside , ( she ) would n ' t even shake my hand or anything . &quot; And then the Canadian men were giving me the dirty looks before the final race , trying to intimidate me . &quot; I didn ' t do anything wrong . Those girls are always elbowing me and everybody else in the gut . I would never do that . And what was I supposed to say to Nathalie ( Lambert ) , ' OK , Nathalie , you can go_on ahead of me ? ' I am not about to do that . &quot; I am not a dirty skater . I won , and I know I won , and I ' m glad I won , and as far as I ' m concerned , that ' s that. &quot;</TEXT>
