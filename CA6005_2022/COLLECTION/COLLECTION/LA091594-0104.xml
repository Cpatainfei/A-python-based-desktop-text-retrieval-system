   <HEADLINE> U.S. SWEETENS DEAL TO GET HAITI LEADERS TO LEAVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton , warning Haiti ' s military rulers that a U.S. invasion could come any day , has made a last-minute offer to spirit them out of the country into comfortable retirement abroad if they agree to step_down , officials said Wednesday . The U.S. offer to Haiti ' s three top leaders includes promises of safe transportation off the island , including protection by U.S. military_units , if needed , and a haven in one of several countries in South_America or Europe . &quot; The time is at_hand , and they need to leave , &quot; Clinton told reporters in the Oval Office . &quot; And they ' re going to leave one way or another. &quot; How they leave , he added , &quot; is up_to them. &quot; &quot; If they decide to leave , we ' ll help them with the arrangements , &quot; Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said on PBS television , adding that the Administration is &quot; taking special steps &quot; to make_sure that the Haitian leaders could negotiate a deal if they choose . Late Wednesday , Haiti ' s army-installed president vowed that the regime will not back_down in the face of increasing U.S. pressure . &quot; We will maintain the chosen direction . . . , &quot; Emile Jonassaint said in a news_conference at the national palace in Port-au-Prince , the capital . &quot; We have harmed no one , threatened neither the peace of America or of the world. &quot; A U.S. official said that secret emissaries have been sent to each of the three top officers in Haiti ' s regime -- Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby and Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois -- to seek negotiations on the terms of their departure . But other officials refused to confirm that . The aim of the offer is to entice one or more of the officers to leave the country voluntarily -- an event that U.S. officials believe would lead to the collapse of the Haitian army and make_it unnecessary for the United States to invade to accomplish its goal of reinstalling exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . The United States has long said that it is willing to help the leaders step_down , but in recent weeks U.S. officials have been working_on ways to make the offer more attractive -- to &quot; sweeten the pot , &quot; one aide said . U.S. diplomats have sought offers of havens in several South_American_countries as well as France and Spain , where Cedras reportedly owns a vacation_home . At least one South_American_country is said to have responded positively . Senior officials turned_down the idea of sending the officers to the neighboring Dominican_Republic . &quot; We didn ' t want them that close to Haiti , &quot; said one . Justice_Department lawyers have researched ways that the Haitian officers can be moved without subjecting them to arrest or exposing them to extradition by the Aristide government , one official said . Officials said that the United States does not plan to pay the Haitians to leave and added that bribery should not be necessary . &quot; They ' ve already got their money hidden away &quot; in other countries , said one official involved . Merely getting the officers and their families safely out of Haiti could pose problems . Lower-ranking officers in the army have reportedly threatened to kill the commanders if they try to leave , so U.S. officials have had to consider &quot; extracting &quot; them in a rescue mission . Several senior officials said that they do not expect that kind of action to be necessary . Nevertheless , in case some kind of covert_operation is needed , Clinton recently sent Congress a secret intelligence &quot; finding &quot; notifying them of the possibility , officials said . A key part of the plan , one aide said , is that the United States is offering each of the three top officers a separate deal -- in the hope that at least one will accept . The result would be a split in the regime ' s leadership that officials hope could lead to the army ' s collapse . &quot; We ' re going to leave no stone unturned to give ( Cedras ) an opportunity to make that decision , which is the right decision , &quot; Christopher said on PBS . But he acknowledged that there has been no clear indication yet that Cedras , Biamby or Francois might leave . Clinton , in an interview with four news_agency reporters , sought to press the message that his patience has run_out after three years of diplomatic attempts to restore Aristide , who was elected in 1990 and ousted by the army in 1991 . &quot; We have literally exhausted every available alternative , and the time has come for those people to get_out , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; They can still leave . They do not have to push this to a confrontation. &quot; Clinton will address the nation on the issue at 6 p.m. PDT today , and aides said that the televised speech will be an ultimatum to the Haitian leaders to step_down . Clinton has not decided whether to give them a specific deadline for leaving , they said . Administration officials have been debating whether such a public deadline will help push the Haitians out or , conversely , stiffen their resolve to stay . During the interview , Clinton held_up grisly photographs of the corpses of murdered Haitian dissidents and said he is &quot; very angry &quot; at the military regime ' s conduct . &quot; I think that , when the American people know the facts of this , they will be supportive , &quot; he said . &quot; . . . I know the timing is unpopular . I know the whole_thing is unpopular . But I believe it is the right thing , &quot; he said . In a preview of his television speech , Clinton spelled_out four reasons why the United States should intervene in Haiti : to stop human_rights abuses , to prevent another exodus of Haitian refugees , to help democracy take_root throughout the Western_Hemisphere and to show that the United States will keep its promises . Clinton refused to say when an invasion might come . But the White_House announced that he will cut_short a planned visit to Los Angeles this weekend , a switch that increased speculation that military_action is near . Clinton plans to attend a Democratic Party fund-raising event in Los Angeles on Sunday . He was originally scheduled to remain until Monday . As the President spoke , U.S. Navy ships loaded with Army soldiers and Marines continued toward Haiti , and Air_Force planes assembled at bases in Puerto Rico and Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . As tensions increased Wednesday over the crisis , the Dwight D . Eisenhower , an aircraft_carrier with the Army ' s 10th Mountain Light Infantry Division troops aboard , left Norfolk , Va. , headed for Haitian waters . The America , another aircraft_carrier capable of carrying up_to 2 # 000 Special Forces troops , was off the north Florida coast on its way to the region . A third vessel , the amphibious command ship Mount_Whitney , is to leave today . It will serve as the command and control_center for any military operation and will be headquarters for Army Lt . Gen . Henry Hugh Shelton . As commander of the 18th Airborne Corps at Ft . Bragg , N.C. , Shelton would be the top U.S. military_leader directing U.S. forces in Haiti . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , asked at the Pentagon on Wednesday morning about more troop movements , indicated that U.S. invasion troops will be ready &quot; very soon &quot; if the military dictatorship in Port-au-Prince does not acquiesce and step_down . In Haiti , two U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopters flew over Port-au-Prince , and low-flying U.S. airplanes dropped thousands of leaflets bearing Aristide ' s photograph and a promise of his return . The military government ' s Ministry of the Interior and Defense declared a partial curfew from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m. , banning driving on main_roads as well as departures of boats and planes . Times staff writer Richard A . Serrano contributed to this report . The U.S. Buildup Administration officials have said that up_to 30 warships and military cargo_vessels , including the aircraft_carriers Eisenhower and America , will be ready to launch an attack as early as next week .
