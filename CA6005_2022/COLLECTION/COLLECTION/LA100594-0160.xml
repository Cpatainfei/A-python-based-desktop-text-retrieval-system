   <HEADLINE> STUDY FINDS CAFFEINE HAS QUALITIES OF ADDICTIVE DRUG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The caffeine in coffee , tea and cola can produce addiction similar to that engendered by alcohol , tobacco , heroin and cocaine , researchers from Johns Hopkins University report today . Although abruptly halting the intake of caffeine has long been known to trigger withdrawal_symptoms that include headaches , lethargy and depression , the new report in the Journal of the American Medical Assn . suggests that the drug produces the full range of characteristics associated with classical psychoactive dependence . Those characteristics include persistent , unsuccessful efforts to reduce consumption , continued use despite medical side_effects , tolerance -- or the need for ever-higher doses to achieve the same psychological effect -- and withdrawal_symptoms when use is stopped . Some evidence suggests that the prevalence of dependence on caffeine is about the same as for alcohol -- about 14 % of users -- according to an editorial by Dr. Richard M . Glass of the association ' s staff . The researchers undertook the study &quot; because there are some people who have problems with caffeine use and are distressed by it , &quot; said Dr. Eric C . Strain , the Johns Hopkins psychiatrist who co-authored the study . &quot; It is helpful because it shows us that caffeine is a drug like other drugs and in terms of understanding the whole addiction process , &quot; he said . Although caffeine can cause symptoms such_as sleeplessness and anxiety , he noted that it has far fewer ill effects than other addictive drugs such_as nicotine , alcohol , heroin and cocaine , so that the significance of addiction to it is not yet clear . &quot; This doesn ' t mean that people have to stop drinking coffee , &quot; Strain said . Nevertheless , the results led Dr. John R . Hughes of the University of Vermont to suggest that &quot; perhaps we should start labeling coffee to indicate its addictive potential . that ' s something I ' d like to know as a consumer. &quot; In a press_release distributed by the International Food Information Council , a trade group , Dr. Peter Dews of Harvard Medical_School said , &quot; This study . . . adds nothing of relevance to normal people consuming caffeine . The majority of these people ( in the study ) had a history of serious substance_abuse or had mood disorders such_as major depression. &quot; Strain conceded that 11 of the 27 participants in the study had previously suffered from substance_abuse or mood disorders , but had been in_remission for four to eight years before the onset of the study . &quot; They did not have active disorders , &quot; he said , and the fact that they had previously had such disorders was not relevant . Fully 80 % of adult Americans consume caffeine regularly , with an average daily dose of about 280 milligrams . ( A 5-ounce cup of coffee or tea contains about 100 milligrams of caffeine , while a 12-ounce cola contains about 60 . Chocolate drinks and chocolate_candy also contain caffeine , but much less. ) Strain and his colleagues ran newspaper_advertisements soliciting people who thought they were dependent_on caffeine . Telephone_interviews of 99 respondents identified 27 , ranging_in age from 21 to 48 , who were willing to visit the laboratory twice , undergo standardized medical and psychiatric interviews and keep a detailed food diary for a week . Examining the 27 subjects , the team found that 94 % displayed withdrawal_symptoms when abstinent from caffeine and 94 % continued caffeine use despite medical counterindications . Some 81 % had made unsuccessful efforts to cut_down on caffeine use , while 75 % needed increasing amounts . Overall , 16 of the 27 showed all four categories that define classic dependence . To further explore withdrawal_symptoms , 11 of the 16 who were caffeine-dependent ( five coffee drinkers , five cola drinkers and one tea drinker ) volunteered to undergo two two-day periods in which they consumed a caffeine-free diet . During one two-day period , they were given their normal dose of caffeine in pill form and in the other they were given a placebo . Eight of the 11 displayed dramatic withdrawal_symptoms when they received no caffeine , including impairment in their normal functioning . One of the subjects on placebo sat in her office at_work with the lights off and her head down , one man made multiple costly mistakes , and another missed work entirely . One woman canceled her son ' s birthday_party and called her spouse home early because of her inability to care_for the children , while another stopped shopping , performing household chores and even such mundane tasks as preparing her child ' s lunch . Five took aspirin or acetaminophen even though the researchers had asked them not to . These withdrawal-related behaviors stopped when the subjects resumed caffeine consumption , the researchers said . Although the Hopkins team had performed a previous study examining caffeine withdrawal , they were surprised by the severity of the symptoms displayed by this group , Strain said . Much more needs to be learned , he concluded , including the prevalence of the dependence and whether it is associated with other problems , such_as mood disorders and abuse of other substances . It ' s conceivable , he said , that some biological mechanism could predispose individuals both to caffeine dependency and other forms of substance_abuse . George Boecklin , president of the National Coffee Assn. , charged that the study group was too small to draw such sweeping conclusions . &quot; It is inappropriate to over-generalize the results of this . . . study , since caffeine as normally consumed poses no health risk to the average consumer and cannot be described as a substance of dependence , &quot; he said . The long-term significance of the study is still undetermined , experts agreed . &quot; If it is true , &quot; said Vermont ' s Hughes , &quot; this is clearly something people need to be educated about . . . . But if you can ' t show that it causes harm , what ' s the clinical significance ? &quot; &quot; This is fertile ground for further research , &quot; Strain said . Caffeine High ( Southland Edition , A20 ) Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have found that the caffeine in coffee , tea and colas can produce a dependence syndrome similar to that caused by alcohol , nicotine , heroin and cocaine . SYMPTOMS OF ADDICTION * Withdrawal : Headaches , lethargy and depression when use is suddenly stopped . * Wanting to cut_back : But inability to do so . * Contining to use : Despite problems such_as anxiety , sleeplessness and gastrointestinal_disorders . * Tolerance : Need for ever-higher doses . LONG-TERM COFFEE USE CAN : * Increase blood cholesterol levels . * Protect against colon and rectal cancer . * Increase the risk of heart_attacks . * Magnify the effects of stress . * Make you feel better and more alert in the morning . * Increase sexual_activity in the elderly . JUST HOW ADDICTIVE ? Unknown . Some very preliminary results suggest 3 % of users have severe dependence and 14 % have moderate dependence . In contrast , 14 % of alcohol users develop dependence and 90 % of smokers do . WHAT TO DO There is no need to give_up coffee , researchers say . If you do give_up caffeine , however , taper_off slowly . Source : JAMA , Johns Hopkins University</TEXT>
