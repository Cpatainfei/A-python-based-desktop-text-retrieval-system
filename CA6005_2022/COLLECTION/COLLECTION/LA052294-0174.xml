   <HEADLINE> LOOKING_OUT FOR LASSIE ; HOLLYWOOD LOVES ANIMALS ( THEY WORK CHEAPER THAN ACTORS ) , BUT THE WELL-BEING OF FOUR-LEGGED STARS ON THE SET IS LEFT ALMOST ENTIRELY UP TO THE TRAINERS . ACTIVISTS SAY that ' s NOT NEARLY GOOD_ENOUGH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During filming in Minnesota last year of Disney ' s &quot; Iron Will &quot; -- the story of a farm_boy ' s triumph in a 1917 dog-sledding race -- a staged fight between two dogs resulted in one receiving a cut near the eyelid . The scene was shot in two takes , each lasting less than 10 seconds , under the supervision of the film ' s animal coordinator and an officer from the American Humane Assn . Each dog was muzzled by use of a clear plastic-coated wire secured around its snout and the back of its head . Despite these precautions , one dog ' s canine tooth apparently slipped through the muzzle . &quot; It was nothing serious or major , &quot; says Ed Lish , the American Humane Assn . officer at the shoot . &quot; We quit right there. &quot; The injured dog was taken_to a veterinarian and its wound sutured . The incident on &quot; Iron Will &quot; serves as a reminder of the dangers that animals face when performing in movies and television even under carefully controlled_conditions . With animal rights now a prominent emotional issue , Hollywood ' s treatment of animal actors is coming under increased scrutiny . Notwithstanding the familiar disclaimer that appears at the end of movies , the welfare of animals used in Hollywood is left almost entirely to the professionalism of trainers , some of whom say their bids are increasingly undercut by competitors ; to movie producers under pressure to control below-the-line costs , and to the American Humane Assn. ' s ability to police productions . Long cherished by studios because they are relatively cheap to produce , movies_starring animals are especially popular now because they provide unambiguous &quot; family entertainment &quot; and can make tons of money on slender budgets . ( Universal Pictures ' two &quot; Beethoven &quot; movies together have grossed more_than $ 200 million. ) Meanwhile , the use of animals in all types of movies is growing . According to the AHA , only 10 % of films produced in 1988 employed animals ; this spring , more_than 50 % of productions include them . Although the nonprofit AHA sets lengthy guidelines for the treatment of animals used in films , reviews scripts and sends its representatives to monitor film and television shoots , it is allowed on sets solely through a clause in the collective_bargaining agreement between the Screen Actors Guild and the Alliance of Motion_Picture and Television Producers , which states that the AHA must be sent a script when animals are used and that the AHA representatives may be present during shooting . While film and television producers cannot bar the AHA ' s representatives from sets , the association ' s recommendations can , theoretically , be ignored . Still , says Betty Denny Smith , director of the AHA ' s Los Angeles office , &quot; it ' s very rare that you come_across a production that will want to do something that we told them is against the guidelines . They can ' t kick us off the set ; they can ' t fire us . We ' re there to say : ' No , you can ' t do that. ' &quot; But should AHA representatives witness acts that violate laws regarding humane animal treatment -- and the association says its guidelines exceed California ' s strict anti-cruelty laws -- their legal recourse is the same as an ordinary citizen ' s . &quot; They can go_to the local D.A. and swear_out a complaint and bring criminal charges if they so choose , &quot; says Ingrid Newkirk , chairwoman of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , the Washington-based animal-rights group . &quot; How many do , I don ' t know. &quot; &quot; The American Humane Association has no power of enforcement , &quot; says game-show host Bob Barker , an animal activist and outspoken critic of the AHA . &quot; They are observers . They have no more power than a stagehand on a set. &quot; Smith maintains that the AHA ' s work is primarily preventive ; citing filmmakers for animal cruelty after the fact runs counter to its mission . * The AHA screens movies featuring animals before they are released , then rates them Acceptable ( the association supervised the production and found no cruelty ) ; Believed Acceptable ( the AHA wasn ' t present but is satisfied the animal action complies with its guidelines ) ; Questionable ( the AHA wasn ' t present , no information available on the film ' s animal action ) , and Unacceptable ( animal cruelty occurred during production ) . The ratings are published in the association ' s magazine , the Advocate . Barker says that the AHA &quot; would have you believe that movie companies cringe with fear about being_on the Unacceptable list &quot; but charges that the average moviegoer does not know the list even exists . Smith says that &quot; if anyone wants the list , they can have it &quot; and that the AHA publicizes the ratings by sending them to other humane societies , which print them in their own publications . &quot; It ' s amazing how many people wait to see &quot; the ratings before attending movies , she says . Barker and Nancy Burnet , director of United Activists for Animal Rights , the grass-roots organization Barker is associated with , were sued for libel and slander by Smith and the AHA in 1989 , partly over allegations made by Barker and the UAAR about the 1987 movie &quot; Project X. &quot; Barker had charged that chimpanzees were beaten and otherwise abused during the making of the film . Prompted by evidence gathered by Barker and UAAR , the Los Angeles City Department of Animal Regulation conducted a three-month investigation and recommended that the district_attorney ' s office bring criminal charges against six animal_trainers involved with the film . ( The trainers and the AHA , whose representatives were present during filming , have denied that the chimps were abused. ) No criminal charges were filed , because the statute of limitations for the charges had run_out . Filing civil charges in the case was considered but dropped because of conflicting testimony and lack of &quot; overwhelming evidence &quot; of abuse . Barker and other defendants finally settled the $ 120-million suit out of court last month for $ 315 # 000 . Both sides promptly began attacking each other in full-page ads in the Hollywood trade papers . Barker says that he was eager for the case to go_to court , that it was settled only because of his insurance_company ' s concern over the expense of a trial and that his attorneys will file a motion to have a protective order covering the case lifted . &quot; We have material obtained under discovery that we cannot reveal to the public because of the protective order , &quot; he says . Information from court documents obtained by the Hollywood Reporter showed that the AHA has received more_than $ 100 # 000 in donations from the Motion_Picture Assn . of America , as well as financial contributions from other organizations with close ties to the film business . The AHA and Smith denied that the donations represent any conflict_of_interest . Barker remains critical of the AHA ' s methods . &quot; I don ' t feel animals are given adequate protection -- I think the system has failed , &quot; he says . Typically , the AHA says , the association receives lists of upcoming productions from SAG , scripts are searched for animal action , and the AHA reviews those scenes with the producers and tries to ensure that they are shot in accordance with the association ' s guidelines . The association also culls the Hollywood trade papers for productions that have not submitted scripts , requesting that they comply . * The AHA ' s Los Angeles office , Smith says , reviewed more_than 700 scripts last year and was present on 340 productions . However , the L.A. office currently employs only six regular representatives and one training officer , although Smith says the association maintains nine part-time regional representatives and calls_on local affiliates across the country to represent it . &quot; The AHA would admit that certainly they aren ' t usually ( on sets ) , &quot; says PETA ' s Newkirk . &quot; It ' s unrealistic and impossible , given all_the films in which animals are used , for them to be present for even the tiniest percentage of them. &quot; Smith says , &quot; I would say we are_on almost every set , &quot; but she acknowledges that on films with &quot; simple animal action in an area where it would be too expensive to send someone , &quot; they are not . When the film_industry is left to its own devices , its treatment of animals has sometimes bordered_on the grotesque . The AHA first found its way onto movie sets_in 1939 amid outrage over the filming of &quot; Jesse James , &quot; in which a stunt rider rode his horse off a 70-foot cliff into white_water , breaking the horse ' s back . Until 1966 , the association was allowed to oversee productions under a clause in the old Hays Code . When the Hays office -- and with it , the AHA ' s official access -- was dissolved , the AHA continued to try to attend shoots ; in one instance it says it was barred , at gunpoint , from the set of &quot; The Legend of the Lone Ranger. &quot; After the association organized a boycott of &quot; Heaven ' s Gate &quot; at about the same time , in 1980 -- during the filming of which , it says , several animals were injured or killed -- the AHA ' s entree on film productions was restored through the present SAG-AMPTP agreement . While Smith says that the treatment of animals in Hollywood is &quot; a world above what used to go_on , from everything I ' ve been told about the old days , &quot; others contend that animal abuse continues but goes unreported because whistle-blowers fear retribution . &quot; People who make waves are not popular in Hollywood , &quot; says UAAR ' s Burnet . &quot; It ' s a very closed industry . They know if they talk , they ' ll be blackballed. &quot; There are stories of animals drugged ( &quot; I know it ' s been done , &quot; says a trainer ) . Of trainers who wildly underestimate jobs when bidding , then find themselves completely unprepared to do them once shooting has begun . Of the TV producer who , upon seeing a trainer shelter his dog with an umbrella after a rigorous take , sneered : &quot; You ' re kissing his ass -- you ' re making us all kiss his ass. &quot; Of the animal film in which the star , according to reports PETA ' s Newkirk received from a source on the set , &quot; was confined all_the time , was intimidated by its handler , was yelled at &quot; and displayed &quot; the classic fear position of its tail between the legs and urinating when spoken to. &quot; With the emergence of animal rights on the national agenda , philosophical schisms are emerging among trainers over acceptable techniques . &quot; Some of the old trainers think in the old ways , like the old circus people , &quot; Newkirk says . &quot; All that ' s changed , and the old trainers haven ' t changed with the times . In our dealings with animal_trainers , we learned that many don ' t know what the federal animal welfare act requires of them , and their feelings are that animals are no more_than props that are quite expendable if the price is right. &quot; * There is no professional accreditation for TV and movie animal_trainers ; they are hired , like any big-name human star , on the basis of their past credits . &quot; They may have done a big-name film , and all they ' ve got_to say is , ' I did that , ' and the producers don ' t check beyond that -- that happens a lot , &quot; says an animal_trainer who has worked in the film business for 20 years . Animals and trainers are sometimes contracted through a production ' s prop department and paid accordingly . &quot; You can still get most animals cheaper than a piece of equipment , &quot; says Clint Rowe , animal_trainer on &quot; Turner &amp; Hooch &quot; and &quot; Down and Out in Beverly Hills. &quot; However , Gary Gero , owner of Birds &amp; Animals Unlimited , one of the industry ' s leading animal suppliers , says that although animals used in incidental scenes may be hired through prop departments , &quot; if the animal is of any significance ( to the production ) , it ' s generally hired through the executive producer , the line producer or sometimes the studio head . They do extensive background checks before you ' re called. &quot; With the increased use of animal actors , competition among trainers has become ferocious . Gero says the competition has lifted the overall quality of the business . &quot; The standards have been rising rapidly , the qualifications are becoming higher , &quot; he says . Other trainers say the opposite has occurred . &quot; Each job is : ' This is the way I need things done -- I need 15 days , ' &quot; Rowe says . &quot; But one of my competitors can say , ' I can do_it in five. ' &quot; Rather than compromise his standards , Rowe says , &quot; I have to take the risk of losing that job. &quot; The upshot , trainers say , is &quot; gimmicking &quot; animal behaviors that normally take weeks or months to train . &quot; You can gimmick any sequence you want . Of course , when you teach it , it becomes more expensive ; therefore , you ' ll lose a job if you ' re not willing to gimmick , &quot; says Doug Seus , a longtime animal_trainer . &quot; The professional isn ' t going_to do these things . To do the job humanely , you need more money and time. &quot; Says trainer Jim Colovin : &quot; Whenever you place unreasonable time constraints and financial chokeholds on quality trainers , it forces ( them ) to compete with people who are more_than willing to ' do what it takes ' to get the job done. &quot; For example , rather than using a dog trained to limp , a trainer can wedge a marble in the paw of an untrained dog . Or a dog can be made to appear to growl by wearing a &quot; snarl cup &quot; prosthetic that pushes_back its lips and exposes its canines . Joe Camp , the animal coordinator on &quot; Iron Will , &quot; says the four-month preparation time for the film was &quot; very comfortable. &quot; &quot; Disney allowed us to show_up ( on location ) eight weeks in_advance to allow the dogs to get used to the climate , &quot; he says . &quot; Everything I asked_for , they gave me , but everything I asked_for , they checked to see if it was legitimate. &quot; Although the AHA guidelines stipulate that fight scenes between animals &quot; shall be simulated , &quot; there is no clear-cut definition of what , exactly , constitutes a simulated fight or where a real one begins . Some trainers argue that muzzling dogs -- which the AHA permits -- effectively allows them to actually fight , albeit without usually harming one another physically . Regarding the fight scene in &quot; Iron Will , &quot; in which both dogs were muzzled , Camp says the dogs were allowed to interact with each other until the more dominant of the pair began to assert himself over the other . &quot; We don ' t fight dogs , &quot; he says . &quot; All we ' re doing is letting a dog display some of that dominance . We ' re not even going_to the threshold of fighting . If it comes anywhere near that , you stop it. &quot; But there ' s another technique for staging fights -- so-called play fighting , which trainer Colovin says he developed 20 years ago . Dogs are trained to roughhouse with each other on command , much the way dogs raised together sometimes gambol unbidden . Although it looks ferocious , the dogs are not , according to Colovin , emotionally or physically fighting . The tip-off : During a play fight , the dogs wag their tails ( which may be tied_down to preserve the illusion of aggression ) . Colovin is convinced that play fighting is &quot; far better for humane treatment as well as looking more realistic. &quot; But it also can take more time and money to train and execute a play fight . Clint Rowe , who has used both muzzled and play fights , says he has sworn_off the former , even though , he says , &quot; if they ' re done properly , nobody gets hurt. &quot; But , he adds , &quot; my standard is not to do them . I don ' t like them ; they feel violent . And they look phony . I did simulated dog fights on ' White Fang , ' and they look great. &quot; Because the dogs realize they are playing , it ' s unnecessary to muzzle them as they grapple and bare their fangs . &quot; The fact of the_matter is you can teach a fight without a muzzle , &quot; says trainer Seus . Says Rowe : &quot; We ' re trainers and should be able to train that . I like to have control of what my animals do. &quot; Nevertheless , the whole notion of animals performing before cameras has been called into question . &quot; Obviously , an animal in an acting situation doesn ' t really know why he ' s doing something over and over again , &quot; says PETA ' s Newkirk . &quot; We ask : What ' s the tangible suffering here ? Mental stress is very real for many animals. &quot; PETA , Newkirk says , would &quot; hold filmmakers to a higher standard by far &quot; than the AHA does . &quot; They are not opposed to a lot of things that we are , and they don ' t go as far as we do. &quot; Says AHA ' s Smith : &quot; We believe animals can be and are used humanely , and that ' s what we ' re there to do. &quot; Trainers , meanwhile , aren ' t eager for the more militant animal-rights groups to assert themselves in the film business for fear they would try to greatly curtail or even outlaw animal actors altogether . &quot; I want to see animals continue in movies , not only for my own livelihood but for the contribution they make , &quot; says one trainer . &quot; For some city people , the only time they see animals is in films. &quot; &quot; The atmosphere in this industry and country is very pro-animal now , &quot; says Gero of Birds &amp; Animals Unlimited . &quot; This industry is very humane . Without exception , the people on shows love the animals . It ' s an insult to the industry even to intimate that a crew would let something bad happen. &quot; &quot; I have my problems with the industry , &quot; says Rowe . &quot; Everybody does . It ' s a business , and ( the studios ' ) business is to bring ( a movie ) in at low cost . As long the job gets done and the animals ' welfare is OK , then you ' re OK. &quot;</TEXT>
