   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : COUNTYWIDE ; OVERALL CRIME DOWN , 1993 STATISTICS SHOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The overall number of reported crimes in Orange County fell_in 1993 despite an unprecedented number of homicides , according to city-by-city crime statistics released this week by the California Department_of_Justice . A record 196 homicides were reported last year , 78 of which occurred in Santa Ana . This represents a 34.5 % increase in homicides for that city compared to the previous year . Despite the increase , overall crime in Santa Ana dropped significantly , statistics show . Westminster , which historically has had a handful of murders each year , experienced a record 10 homicides last year . But , overall crime in the city dropped_by 12 % , according to statistics . Santa Ana and Westminster are reflective of a countywide trend of more homicides and aggravated assaults , but fewer rapes , robberies , burglaries , thefts and arsons . &quot; The numbers have gone_down and that ' s encouraging , &quot; Westminster police Lt . Rick Main said . &quot; But you don ' t want to get too cocky about them because they can swing back . What we want to do is improve upon those numbers. &quot; Main said the drop_in crime can probably be attributed to TARGET , the city ' s gang-suppression program and to the department ' s Problem Oriented Policing program , which focuses_on the city ' s troubled areas . Crime declined last year in five of Orange County ' s seven largest cities . Irvine , which has gained a national reputation as one of the safest larger cities in the United States , had a 13.1 % decrease in violent crime , the largest drop of any city . Other cities that had significant crime decreases were Fullerton , Garden Grove , Los Alamitos , Orange , Tustin , San Juan Capistrano and Stanton . Although Mission Viejo remains one of the safest cities in the county , the city experienced a 21 % jump in crime , mostly due_to a steep rise in auto thefts and burglaries . &quot; We live_in pretty rough economic times , and basically , we ' ve had an increase in crimes related to dishonesty , &quot; said sheriff ' s Lt . Randy Blair , chief of police services in Mission Viejo . Other cities which experienced increases in crime were Laguna Beach , San Clemente , Villa Park and Seal Beach . O.C. Crime Comparisons There were more_than 5 # 500 fewer crimes in Orange County during 1993 than in 1992 . For the most part , the decline was in property offenses . However , even in those categories where there were increases--homicide , assault and motor_vehicle theft--the rate of crime per 1 # 000 residents remained fairly stable . Santa Ana had the most reported crimes in 1993 , but Costa Mesa had the highest rate .
