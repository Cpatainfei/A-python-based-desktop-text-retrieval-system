   <HEADLINE> RESURRECTING IRAN-CONTRA ; ONE-TIME NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER AND CHIEF SCANDAL SCAPEGOAT GIVES HIS FIRST-PERSON ACCOUNT ; SPECIAL TRUST , BY ROBERT C . MCFARLANE AND ZOFIA SMARDZ ( CADELL &amp; DAVIES : $ 25 ; 389 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In August , 1993 , independent counsel Lawrence Walsh issued his final report on the Iran-Contra scandal . His ultimate findings made the front page of many newspapers , but by no means all , for journalists and citizens alike were weary of the story after seven years of partisan finger-pointing , fragmentary reporting , internecine recrimination and never-ending attempts at spin control . The Walsh report , in theory , should have put Iran-Contra to rest , allowing the participants in the scandal -- and the public at_large -- to get_on_with their lives . That hasn ' t happened , of course , and in retrospect it ' s unreasonable to think that any formal document could do_justice , in every sense of the term , to Iran-Contra . In skeletal summary , the story seems the first draft of a B-movie : U.S._government officials secretly sell state-of-the-art military arms to shady figures in one country in_order to procure the release of political hostages in another , with the proceeds sent , again in secret and against U.S. law , to guerrilla fighters in a third country . Add figures such_as Ronald Reagan , Oliver North , John Poindexter , Elliot Abrams and Caspar Weinberger ( not to mention Fawn Hall ) , and you have the makings of a Shakespearean tragedy . Reagan as Caesar in dotage , given to demagoguery but easily swayed by sentiment ; a band of advisers displaying various degrees of loyalty -- George Shultz a dutiful Kent , Weinberger a frustrated Coriolanus , Alexander Haig an un-shrewd Cassius ; North a truly Shakespearean figure , combining Anthony ' s public oratorical skills with Iago ' s private cunning . Who but Shakespeare could capture the moral contradictions , the misguided patriotism , the inevitable personal treachery , that the Iran-Contra scandal would force these and other characters to face . . . or in some cases , ignore ? There ' s one figure even Shakespeare might have trouble with , however : Robert ( Bud ) McFarlane , decorated Marine , one-time national security adviser , chief Iran-Contra scapegoat , famously failed suicide , and now author of &quot; Special Trust , &quot; the latest , and surely one of the last , first-person accounts of the scandal . McFarlane wants to be the principled Brutus , the good soldier who says ( well before agreeing to Caesar ' s assassination ) that he loves &quot; the name of honor more_than I fear death. &quot; In some ways McFarlane deserves the comparison , being a straight-shooter who fell on his sword in 1987 -- actually , took an overdose of Valium -- as penance for setting Iran-Contra in motion . By the time one finishes this memoir , though , McFarlane seems more like Gloucester in &quot; King Lear , &quot; the attempted suicide whose loyalty earns him virtually nothing . Like Gloucester , too , McFarlane is blind , at least metaphorically ; he never saw betrayal coming , failing to understand -- then -- that the Marine ' s motto of semper fidelis is an almost meaningless concept in the political_arena , even when voiced by a fellow corpsman . Oliver North , who stands a good chance of being elected Tuesday to the U.S. Senate from Virginia , has called &quot; Special Trust &quot; &quot; a pitiful and mean-spirited attempt ( by McFarlane ) to glue his broken reputation back together again. &quot; Leave_out pitiful and mean-spirited , and in fact that ' s not a bad description ; McFarlane ' s book , like every_other political memoir , is self-serving , taking as its starting point the idea that negotiating with Iranian dissidents during the Khomeini regime was at first a reasonable diplomatic strategy that subsequently took_on a life of its own , with terrible consequences . On the whole , though , &quot; Special Trust &quot; is a responsible and plausible volume , for McFarlane is less interested in generating sympathy and wreaking vengeance than in putting Iran-Contra in context . He eventually levels some very serious charges -- near the book ' s close he characterizes North as &quot; deceitful , mendacious , and traitorous &quot; -- but by then McFarlane has earned the right to call names . It ' s hard to believe at times that McFarlane was really so trusting of his political and intelligence peers as he professes , but by the same token it ' s easy to see , given McFarlane ' s personal history , why he would presume that such trust was fundamental and beyond question . McFarlane ' s passage into the corridors of power was straightforward . He grew_up largely in Washington , the son of a New Deal Democrat who became a prominent lawyer in the Justice_Department after losing his congressional seat in Texas . Bud McFarlane was a Boy_Scout who would later marry his highschool sweetheart . When in the late 1950s he considered dropping_out of the Naval Academy -- from which a number of his relatives had graduated -- it was with the idea of becoming a pastor . McFarlane ' s father persuaded him otherwise , however , and after obtaining a commission the son served two tours_of_duty in Vietnam . There , like so many other soldiers , he got a troubling dose of political and military reality , but that experience was balanced by a much more favorable two-year stint studying international relations in Geneva . In 1971 McFarlane became a White_House Fellow , working in an office next to that of Henry Kissinger , then Richard Nixon ' s national security adviser ; two years later he was_on Kissinger ' s staff . From that point onward McFarlane ' s ascent , it seems , was assured , for he was good at organizing information and planning for contingencies -- here his Marine training shows -- if not at generating original ideas . McFarlane says more_than once that his father pressed_on his children the idea of public_service , and the son uses that counsel to frame &quot; Special Trust. &quot; The title is taken from the charge given to government officials when they accept their positions : that they have been invested not merely with power but also with a &quot; special trust , &quot; each provided by the people in_order to help officials advance the general good . This is , obviously , a politically astute way to introduce McFarlane ' s story , but it also seems genuine , for McFarlane , unlike many of his colleagues , can ' t be accused of using public_service as a steppingstone to private riches . He can be accused of high ambition -- of trying to give the Reagan_Administration the sort of foreign-policy credibility that Kissinger had given Nixon -- but that ' s hardly_a criticism , especially given the well-known personal and policy disagreements between George Shultz at State and Caspar Weinberger at Defense . It is fair to say , though , that McFarlane ' s desire to be a highly successful diplomat , perhaps as venerated as Kissinger , played a role , however minor , in the events that led to his downfall . An Israeli official , responding to diplomatic feelers , reported in 1985 that his government was in contact with moderates in Iran who might be able to overthrow the Khomeini government and also , so they said , deliver the U.S. hostages held by the Hezbollah terrorist group in Lebanon . McFarlane , national security adviser at the time , was intrigued by the information , knowing how much Reagan wanted the hostages brought_home safely . He soon received the presidential go-ahead to pursue negotiations . Eventually , through Israeli intermediaries , the Iranian dissidents insisted that the hostages would be released only in exchange for 100 TOW missiles , at which point negotiations came_to a halt . CIA Director William Casey alone among the handful of White_House officials consulted on the issue was willing to argue for its legality . But when the Israelis suggested a shell_game -- that they ship the weapons to Iran and later replace the missiles with a duplicate purchase from the U.S. -- the plan was revived . Reagan agreed to it , Shultz and Weinberger remained opposed , and a_few months later , after McFarlane had resigned his White_House post and become a special envoy to the President , he was in Tehran on the verge of destroying his career . This is McFarlane ' s version of the arms-for-hostages agreement , and it generally coincides with established facts , except for Reagan ' s subsequent denials that he knew anything about the plan . McFarlane admits that he at least advanced the deal , if he didn ' t precisely father it , and blames Shultz and Weinberger mainly for disavowing any knowledge of the arrangement ( knowledge later confirmed through the disclosure of their contemporaneous notes on the affair ) . The Contra side of the deal hardly comes_up at all : McFarlane says he learned of it only on the Tehran airport Tarmac , when the Iranians had again failed to deliver the hostages , despite having already received missile shipments -- directly from the U.S. , as it turned_out -- after McFarlane had resigned his White_House position . It was_on leaving Iran empty-handed , McFarlane says , that North , who was nominally working for McFarlane , told him , &quot; Don ' t worry , Bud , it ' s not a total loss . At least we ' re using some of the Ayatollah ' s money in Central America. &quot; North , of course , says McFarlane not only knew and approved of the Contra-bound money but masterminded the entire scheme , giving his assistant general authority over covert_operations in Nicaragua and , later , ordering a cover-up . Both North and McFarlane have been convicted of crimes related to Iran-Contra -- McFarlane pleaded guilty to four counts of unlawfully withholding material information from Congress , while North was convicted of destroying official_documents and obstructing Congress -- but there ' s no question which figure has greater credibility . McFarlane ' s references_to &quot; special trust &quot; might seem like plays to the peanut_gallery except for the fact that he alone freely tried to explain Iran-Contra to Congress and the public , refusing to plead the Fifth_Amendment ( as did Oliver North and John Poindexter ) or insist on immunity from prosecution ( which North did , and which led to his conviction ' s being overturned ) . Yes , McFarlane was naive to believe that &quot; being accountable , telling the truth and expecting the system to respect that approach would lead to justice being done &quot; . . . but he did the right thing nonetheless . McFarlane , now head of an international energy-development company , does not come_out of &quot; Special Trust &quot; smelling like a rose . The book , first of all , is peculiarly well-shaped ; one can ' t help feeling that McFarlane ' s friend and lawyer , Washington lawyer Leonard Garment , made_sure his client ' s public account of Iran-Contra jibed well with the existing , uncontradicted record . McFarlane , moreover , is proficient at interpreting events in conveniently agreeable ways ; he ridicules the 1967 decision to build a high-tech electronic fence across Vietnam ' s DMZ to help monitor enemy movements , but 80 pages later boasts of creating the &quot; Star Wars &quot; ( Strategic Defense Initiative ) anti-missile system , which would have been an immense high-tech disaster . The SDI discussion also shows McFarlane ' s occasional slipperiness ; at first he tries to defend SDI on strategic grounds , despite the fact that it upset many U.S. allies , would have militarized space , and very likely reignited the arms race , but eventually justifies it as simply a diplomatic bargaining_chip . The biggest surprise in &quot; Special Trust &quot; is the fact that McFarlane says relatively little about Oliver North . The second biggest is that the book has been produced by a new and unknown publisher , Cadell &amp; Davies . McFarlane charges in the acknowledgments to this volume that the major publisher with whom he orginally signed turned_out to be interested only in &quot; sensationalism. &quot; These facts -- and there ' s no reason to doubt McFarlane ' s description of how &quot; Special Trust &quot; came_to be -- are not unrelated , for McFarlane can no more adapt his views and methods to satisfy a commercial publisher ' s view of a &quot; good &quot; Iran-Contra book than he can place Oliver North center stage for the dramatic effect the public seems to require . McFarlane ' s portrait of Iran-Contra defies the one we carry in our heads -- of McFarlane , Shultz , Weinberger , and Poindexter overshadowed by the towering figures of Reagan and North ( the latter two dressed , of course , as gunslingers ) . In the end , however , the discrepancy makes his memoir more trustworthy rather than less . It ' s ironic that McFarlane was pressured to make this book more &quot; marketable , &quot; for his refusal to hard-sell himself to Congress , the media , and the public -- as did , routinely , those masterful , telegenic salesmen , Ronald Reagan and Oliver North -- was the chief reason he became Iran-Contra ' s fall_guy . In McFarlane ' s tableau , North &quot; violated the special trust &quot; placed in him by the American people , and one can ' t help but conclude that McFarlane harbors similar thoughts about big-time book publishing . Sad but true , and frightening to boot ; it now seems more important in our culture to be able to project an image of integrity and fidelity than actually to possess those qualities , that we measure someone ' s credibility , not against the evidence , but by the ability to convince .</TEXT>
