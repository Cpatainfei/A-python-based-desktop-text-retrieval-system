   <HEADLINE> TRIAL DATE IS SET IN FIRST COUNTY ' 3 STRIKES ' CASE ; COURTS : MAN FACING FELONY ASSAULT CHARGES COULD RECEIVE 25 YEARS TO LIFE IN PRISON UNDER LAW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first Orange County man charged under the tough-on-crime &quot; three strikes &quot; law was ordered to stand trial Friday after the defense unsuccessfully argued that his first two felony convictions shouldn ' t count as &quot; strikes &quot; against him . Municipal Judge Donald Macintyre in Westminster set a May 31 trial date for Mario Veliz Rodriguez , 30 , who faces felony assault and weapons charges for allegedly shooting a man in the face with a flare gun during a barroom brawl . Rodriguez faces a possible prison sentence of 25 years to life because the new &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; law mandates the term for third-time felons whose earlier convictions included serious or violent felonies . The judge ordered the Garden Grove forklift repairman to stand trial at the close of a preliminary hearing in the case . During the hearing , Macintyre rejected an argument by Rodriguez ' s attorney that the &quot; three strikes &quot; legislation , designed to keep career felons off the streets , only applies to convictions after March 7 of this year , when the law went_into effect . Orange County Deputy Public_Defender Leonard Gumlia told Macintyre that the legislation specifically states that a felony has to be declared a &quot; strike &quot; at the time of conviction . He said the public_defender ' s office intends to take its argument to a higher_court . &quot; we ' ll do_it until the issue is resolved , &quot; Gumlia said . Deputy Dist . Atty . Arnold D . Westra , who is prosecuting Rodriguez , called the legal challenge &quot; really a stretch. &quot; He said the state Legislature clearly intended that felonies prosecuted before March of this year to count as &quot; strikes. &quot; &quot; I don ' t want to comment on Mr. Rodriguez ' s case , but I say taxpayers have seen violent felons commit crimes and be back on the streets , and at some point we ' ve got_to stop this , &quot; Westra said after the hearing . Supporters hail the &quot; three strikes &quot; law as a way to crack_down on repeat offenders . But critics argue that it is overly broad , restricts judges ' discretion and unfairly allows juvenile convictions to count as &quot; strikes. &quot; Defendants -- particularly juveniles -- often accepted plea bargains before the law went_into effect that they never would have gone_for if they knew what the implications would be , Gumlia said . &quot; We assured our ( juvenile ) clients that prior records would be sealed and never be used against them . We told them that , &quot; Gumlia said . The law also allows_for dual convictions stemming from one arrest to count as two &quot; strikes , &quot; another point of contention with defense_attorneys . Rodriguez ' s first two &quot; strikes &quot; were for assault with intent to commit murder and second-degree robbery . His first conviction occurred when he was a juvenile , but he was sentenced in adult court . Friday , Rodriguez sat hunched in the courtroom , his wrists and ankles shackled , listening to a Garden Grove man recount the barroom fight that led to his March 20 arrest and his dubious distinction as the first Orange County felon to be slapped with a &quot; three strikes &quot; enhancement . Donald Moore , 23 , said Rodriguez was drunk and belligerent at Sugar ' s bar that night , dancing &quot; foolishly &quot; with his shirt off . Rodriguez had been kicked_out of the bar twice for bad behavior before he came_back in with a flare gun , Moore said . After Rodriguez pushed Moore ' s friend , Moore testified that he stepped toward Rodriguez , who pointed the flare gun at his face . They struggled for the gun and it went_off about eight to 10 inches from his head , Moore said . He pointed to a crescent-shaped scar on his right temple that he said was caused by the gun . &quot; I heard it go_off . I felt impact and then I felt blood dripping down my face , &quot; Moore testified . &quot; I still had no knowledge that it was just a flare gun . I thought it was a .22. &quot; Gumlia pressed Moore and Garden Grove Police_Officer Vince Purinton , who arrested Rodriguez , for details about Rodriguez ' s state of drunkenness . He argued unsuccessfully that a flare gun may_not qualify as a firearm and said the night ' s events do not add_up to felony assault with a weapon . &quot; He points the gun at Mr. Moore only after Moore took a step toward him . I think he ' s guilty of brandishing a weapon , &quot; Gumlia said . Moore said outside of court that he thinks Rodriguez deserves a 25-year sentence . &quot; I think if I hadn ' t reacted as I did , he would have shot me in the face , &quot; he said . &quot; From what I ' ve read in the papers about his prior convictions , yes , I think he deserves it. &quot;</TEXT>
