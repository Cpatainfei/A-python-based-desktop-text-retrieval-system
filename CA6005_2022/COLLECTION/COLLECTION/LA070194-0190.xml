   <HEADLINE> HAUNTED BY COLOSIO ; CANDIDATE ' S SLAYING SHADOWS MEXICO ' S ZEDILLO ON TIJUANA VISIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ernesto Zedillo , the ruling party candidate in the closely fought and volatile race for the Mexican presidency , Thursday brought his campaign to potentially hostile territory : Baja California . The border state is a bastion of the opposition National Action Party ( PAN ) , whose hard-charging standard-bearer , Diego Fernandez , has emerged in many polls as the main challenger to Zedillo ' s Institutional Revolutionary Party , widely known as the PRI , which has ruled Mexico for 65 years . And here more_than anywhere in Mexico , the ghost of slain PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio haunts the Zedillo campaign . The assassination of Colosio at a March 23 rally in Tijuana catapulted Zedillo , a reserved , 43-year-old economist , into the role of replacement candidate for an increasingly fractious party that confronts an unprecedented threat . In a speech at a sweltering union hall in the port city of Ensenada , the bespectacled Zedillo made_it clear that the border state represents a key battlefield in the Aug . 21 national election . &quot; I am committed to leading our party to a triumph here in Baja California , &quot; Zedillo said , his open-necked shirt drenched with sweat , reminding the crowd that he grew_up in Mexicali and saying he hopes to retire to the coast of Ensenada one day . This regional appeal could help Zedillo make incursions into the PAN ' s power base in an unusually close national race with Fernandez and fellow challenger Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) . Although the PRI has been battered by crises -- the Colosio assassination , an armed uprising in Chiapas , drug violence , corruption -- its political_machine remains formidable , according to Tonatiuh Guillen Lopez , a political_scientist at the College of the Northern Border in Tijuana . &quot; In a race where the margin of victory will be small , Zedillo ' s regional appeal could be significant , &quot; Guillen said . &quot; Ironically , the PRI benefits from the fact that both opposition parties are strong . They could neutralize one another. &quot; Politics notwithstanding , small but unmistakable reminders of the Colosio case marked Zedillo ' s path in Baja . Zedillo made a quick pilgrimage Wednesday night to the site of the assassination in the canyon shantytown of Lomas Taurinas , where he repeated his calls_for justice . Ensenada supporters chanted Colosio ' s name Thursday , describing Zedillo as the man who had picked_up the torch of his fallen predecessor . The candidate ' s security_guards were numerous and vigilant . However , less than four months after a slaying that many Mexicans attribute to a plot within the ruling party , the profile of the Colosio case seems to be fading . Despite its profound impact on Tijuana , the assassination was not mentioned during a live television interview Wednesday night in which Zedillo talked at length about improving tourism and ensuring that Mexican milk_can compete in the era of free_trade . And a crowd of well-wishers pushed very close to Zedillo after the Ensenada speech , shaking his hand , giving him campaign posters to autograph and planting kisses on his cheek . The scene seemed uncomfortably reminiscent_of the moments before Colosio was shot , but PRI stalwarts said afterward that the candidate faced no danger in Ensenada . &quot; The fight must go_on ! &quot; one woman shouted . &quot; He will win . God protect him. &quot; Official efforts to shift public attention from Colosio appear to be working , according to political_scientist Guillen . The public focus_on Zedillo ' s bid derives from a traditional of heavily concentrated power in the Mexican presidency . &quot; It is a product of Mexican presidential ( politics ) : ' The king is dead , long live the king , ' &quot; Guillen said , adding that he does not expect breakthroughs in the much-criticized investigation of the Colosio murder before the August election . During other campaign stops , Zedillo sounded themes consistent with his attempt to reinvent his party as a modernizing , reformist force . He called_for a redistribution of power from the federal_government to state and city authorities -- a dramatic change in the heavily centralized Mexican system and a frequent demand of the PAN . Zedillo urged sweeping law_enforcement reforms , calling lawlessness the nation ' s gravest problem . And he mixed his feisty predictions of victory with a conciliatory tone , promising to work closely with opposition governments in Baja if he is elected .</TEXT>
