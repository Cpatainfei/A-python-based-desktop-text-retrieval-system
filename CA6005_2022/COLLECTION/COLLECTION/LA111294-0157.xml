   <HEADLINE> FEARS ABOUND OVER PRENATAL CARE AT CLINICS ; PROP . 187 : GOV . WILSON ' S ORDER MAKING SUCH PROGRAMS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ONE OF HIS FIRST TARGETS SPARKS CONCERN AND OUTRAGE AMONG WORKERS . FOR NOW , PATIENTS CAN CONTINUE SEEKING MEDICAL HELP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I ' m so scared , I am so nervous , &quot; said the 25-year-old illegal immigrant woman , worrying about Proposition 187 , the initiative that would cut_off her medical_care , after a prenatal checkup at the Venice Family Clinic . Though she had two previous premature deliveries and is having complications with her current pregnancy , the woman said she is considering stopping her prenatal care , and is thinking_about having her baby at_home , in the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her husband and two daughters . &quot; They say we can ' t go_to the doctors if we don ' t have all_the papers , &quot; said the woman , who was moved from Mexico_City to Los Angeles by her mother when she was 15 . &quot; If I have to , I will have my baby in my house . I will do what I have to do. &quot; Proposition 187 , which requires a halt to all non-emergency health_care to illegal immigrants and requires health_care workers to report them to immigration authorities , is expected to have broad public health ramifications . But nowhere are the stakes quite as dramatic as they are for prenatal and well-baby programs . Gov . Pete Wilson , in a post-election executive order , made prenatal programs for illegal immigrants one of his first targets . The executive order , issued Wednesday , represented the start of the 60-day notification period required by law before cuts can be implemented in the state-financed Access for Infants and Mothers ( AIM ) program . The courts could block the order , but for now the Wilson Administration is drafting emergency regulations . A spokesman for the governor said all required paperwork should be in place within 60 days so that the order can be enforced . Such basic services as blood_tests , physician consultations , diet advice , ultrasound tests , and , after the baby is born , well-baby checkups will be cut_off if the order is enforced . Physicians and health_care experts have long considered basic prenatal care to be essential in guaranteeing healthy babies , and studies have linked lack of prenatal care with the delivery of premature and underweight babies and with learning disorders , even fetal_alcohol_syndrome . During his first term , Wilson was instrumental in expanding prenatal services to low-income women . In 1989 , he told The Times that the $ 1 # 200 cost of prenatal health_care was_well worth the money . &quot; It is the best investment . . . if we are to determine if there are problems . . . and I am convinced that would eliminate many of the learning disorders , &quot; he said then . Sean Walsh , a spokesman for Wilson , said Friday he saw no contradiction between the governor ' s earlier comments and his aggressive stance on Proposition 187 . Walsh said that so_much money is going_into health services for illegal immigrants that the AIM program cannot afford to take_care of all_the legal residents of California who need prenatal care . He said Wilson has asked the Legislature to put all savings from the crackdown on health_care for illegal immigrants into the AIM program . Health administrators contend that the drop-off in patients seeking prenatal care will result in more emergency_room cases -- a much more costly situation for taxpayers . Under Proposition 187 , emergency medical_care would continue to be provided . &quot; Without prenatal care , a lot of high-risk cases will end_up with complications and have to go_to the emergency_room , &quot; said Dr. Son Nguyen , a physician at the Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles , which has seen a steep drop_in patients since Election_Day . * Wilson ' s order Wednesday generated widespread alarm among health workers and patients . The 25-year-old woman at the Venice Family Clinic , who asked not to be identified because of her fear of immigration authorities , said that returning to Mexico , as Wilson and other sponsors of Proposition 187 are suggesting , is not an option . Both she and her daughters , ages 8 and 3 , identify as Americans and would feel lost in Mexico . For the moment , she said she trusts the promises of people at the clinic that she is in no immediate danger of being reported to immigration authorities . &quot; You have to trust somebody to tell the truth , &quot; she said . &quot; If they tell me to come_back , I will come_back because my daughters need health care. &quot; But she said if Proposition 187 is enforced , that will change and she will be forced to try to take_care of herself . Six months pregnant , she said she has had to go_to an emergency_room once because of premature contractions . &quot; What am I supposed to do ? &quot; she asked . &quot; I think maybe I have my baby at my house . But what if my baby dies ? &quot; The fear expressed by the woman was resonating throughout the Los Angeles area , health_care workers said Friday . At Queen of Angeles-Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital , prenatal clinic workers said 26 women did not turn_up the day after the election for scheduled appointments . On Thursday , 15 women failed to show_up . By Friday , most of the patients were coming_in , though clinic workers said they were_full of fear . The clinic usually sees 60 to 90 women a day , about 90 % of whom are Latino . Although the clinic services a predominantly Latino clientele , the hospital reported that alarm had also spread to Korean and Armenian immigrants in the Hollywood area . &quot; They were afraid to come_out because they thought we would report them to the Immigration and Naturalization Service , &quot; said Ana Posey , director of the clinic . &quot; One lady said she was afraid to come_out of her house because she saw a gray van in the neighborhood that looked_like an immigration van . We had to send a taxi for her. &quot; * The taxi was just one means used to try to coax fearful families into clinics . The hospital also was sending_out mail , making phone_calls to patients ' homes and using Spanish-language radio and television_stations to make announcements . &quot; I tell them , ' Come_in_for prenatal care , you have nothing to fear , ' &quot; Posey said . Dr. Carol Jennings , who works_at the South Central Family Health Center near Downtown Los Angeles , said some patients , about 90 % of whom are Latino , have called saying they are afraid to come_in . &quot; They ask if we are asking_for documents , &quot; she said . &quot; Morale has been really low . The staff and the patients are feeling bad because of how strongly 187 passed . It ' s like a slap in the face. &quot; Like many clinics , the health center relies_on payments from the state for a significant part of its operating budget . That means the facility , which provides care to about 4 # 000 low-income clients , could be forced to close if it cannot make_up for the lost money through federal grants or private contributions . One woman has told Sue W . Scott , the clinic ' s director , that she would stop bringing her son in_for his treatments for lead_poisoning , treatments which if stopped could lead to long-term brain damage and limited physical development . Although the boy is a legal citizen , the mother is not and she said she could not risk deportation . &quot; I was devastated when I heard that , &quot; Scott said . &quot; I am feeling an incredible amount of anger. &quot;</TEXT>
