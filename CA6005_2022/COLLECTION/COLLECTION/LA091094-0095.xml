   <HEADLINE> LUCKY , UNION DEADLOCKED AS STRIKE LOOMS ; LABOR : NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE IN ORANGE AGAINST A SUNDAY DEADLINE . TEAMSTERS COULD WALK_OUT AGAINST 235-STORE CHAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Working against a Sunday night deadline , negotiators for the Teamsters union and Lucky Stores Friday remained locked in a contract dispute centering_on job security for workers who warehouse and deliver goods to 235 Lucky supermarkets across Southern California . Teamsters leaders say their 1 # 695 members could strike as early as 12:01 a.m. Monday , when the existing labor_contract expires . Other possibilities , union officials said , are a boycott of Lucky , which is the region ' s No . 2 supermarket chain , or an extension of the current contract until a new agreement is reached . But the union said it is unwilling to bend on job security , the issue in_dispute , and both the company and the Teamsters continued to make preparations in case of a strike . About 75 leaders of Teamsters and other food industry unions across the state converged Friday in Orange County , where Lucky ' s three main warehouses are based , in a show of solidarity . &quot; We have had dialogue , but we ' re still far apart , &quot; said Ed Mireles , head of Teamsters Local 952 in Orange . Lucky Stores spokeswoman Judy Decker said the company , a unit of American Stores Co . of Salt_Lake_City , remained hopeful . &quot; We want a solution , &quot; she said . At the same time , however , Lucky employees at the company ' s three Orange County warehouses were assigned to work overtime Friday , as they have in the past week , setting_aside extra pallets of food for easy delivery in the event of a strike . Union_members , however , said they have slowed_down the pace of work in protest . Lucky said it also has a contingent of replacement workers on standby . The company ' s contract dispute with the Teamsters focuses_on the company ' s ability to move distribution and warehouse work in Orange County elsewhere . For many years , Lucky operated three distribution centers -- in Buena Park , Irvine and Fullerton -- to service all_of its Southern California stores and 20 in Nevada . But earlier this summer , Lucky opened a fourth warehouse in Fontana , and soon after that the company shifted liquor products there from its facility in Buena Park . Lucky workers in Fontana have a separate contract with the company and make $ 4.60 an hour less than those in Orange County , whose hourly pay is about $ 16.60. Lucky says it needs the flexibility to move work among its Southern California warehouses to operate efficiently . But Teamsters officials say the shift in liquor products will cost at least 22 of its members their jobs and , moreover , threatens the long-term job security of its members . The Teamsters have not struck a big grocery chain in Southern California since 1985 , when the union walked_out at Vons in what turned_out to be an eight-week strike . But workers at Lucky warehouses Friday were bracing for the worst . &quot; Everybody I ' ve talked to here is trying to line_up temporary jobs just in case , &quot; said one 12-year employee at Lucky ' s warehouse in Irvine .</TEXT>
