   <TEXT> Ilmor Engineering , designer and manufacturer of the Mercedes-Benz and other Indy car engines , has been named recipient of the Queen ' s Export Award for Achievement for the second time in 10 years . The award is given for outstanding export achievement in international motor racing . As if to put their stamp of approval on the award , two of Roger Penske ' s Ilmor Mercedes drivers posted the fastest laps Thursday in practice for the May 29 Indianpolis 500 . Defending champion Emerson Fittipaldi ' s lap of 230.438 m.p.h. was the fastest of the month . &quot; Today was the first day I felt comfortable in the car , &quot; Fittipaldi said . &quot; It took me a_few days after I arrived back from ( Ayrton Senna ' s funeral in ) Brazil before I felt where I was physically and mentally prepared. &quot; Teammate Paul Tracy was second fastest at 228.444. Both Fittipaldi and Tracy had trap speeds of 244 m.p.h. at the end of the straightaway . The third Mercedes driver , Al Unser Jr. , was fourth at 227.457. Only Michael Andretti , in a Reynard-Ford Cosworth , broke the Penske monopoly with a 227.698 lap . * Trivia time : Who is the fastest rookie in Indy 500 history ? * One of the sponsors of the Lola-Buick driven by Stan Fox is the American Bowling Congress , so car owner Ron Hemelgarn had a golf_cart made in the shape of a bowling_pin to tow the car from the garage to the_pits . &quot; It ' s the only golf_cart that takes two mechanics , &quot; Fox said . * Mark Smith , the McMinnville , Ore. , driver who was bumped from the 500 last year by Geoff Brabham , is back again in one of Derrick Walker ' s cars in an attempt to become a footnote to Indy history . In 77 races , no Smith has ever started the 500 . * Trivia answer : Jimmy Vasser , 222.313 m.p.h. , in 1992 . * Bryan Herta of Los Angeles and Adrian Fernandez of Mexico_City are two of the 10 rookies who will attempt to qualify for the 500 . What do they think_of it all ? Said Herta , driving for A.J. Foyt , &quot; I think the speeds at first are a little intimidating . To pass my rookie test I had to go 70 m.p.h. faster than I ' d ever been in a race car. &quot; Added Fernandez , driving for Rick Galles : &quot; Rick Galles and ( crew chief ) Owen Snyder are my coaches . I have to show patience and wait for them to release me to go faster . A lot of people have asked me if this is easy and it isn ' t. &quot; SHAV GLICK</TEXT>
