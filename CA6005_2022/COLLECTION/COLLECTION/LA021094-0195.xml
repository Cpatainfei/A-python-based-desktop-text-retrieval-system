   <HEADLINE> TRAVELING TOY BEAR HELPS OPEN UP WORLD TO CLASS ; EDUCATION : SCOOTER ' S JOURNEY TO SEVEN STATES AND EUROPE HELPS GIVE GEOGRAPHY LESSONS TO STUDENTS AT ST . ANTHONY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He stands only 2 feet tall , weighs no more_than 5 pounds and is stuffed with cotton . But Scooter the Bear has been quite the world_traveler since September , canvassing the globe as an ambassador , sightseer and co-geography teacher to the eighth-grade class at St . Anthony Elementary School in Long_Beach . Teacher Chad Laines decided to enliven his geography lessons by sending the bear_on an experimental journey in September . The students armed Scooter with a note explaining the project , a set of stamped , pre-addressed postcards , a backpack and travel journal . Scooter ' s traveling companions were asked to send the postcards , deposit souvenirs in the backpack , and record their experiences in the journal . By the time Scooter returned to class last month , the cards and journal revealed he had traversed at least seven states and eight European_countries . The light-gray bear had accumulated a wealth of treasures in his backpack , including currency from Poland , a beer_mug from Sweden ( allegedly grabbed after a night of heavy partying with some female companions in Stockholm ) and a shirt from Greece . Laines came_up with the idea for the project with his wife , Annie , who works as a flight_attendant for Delta Airlines . So on Sept . 24 , Scooter , well , scooted off from Los Angeles International Airport . Annie Laines gave the bear to a young_girl on her way from Los Angeles to Portland . After that , Scooter was_on his own . The postcards allowed students to trace Scooter ' s progress on a map , while they studied the geographic , historic and cultural differences of the places he visited . But the journal revealed a more complete picture of his travels : &quot; Today , my family and I are going_to Orlando ( Florida ) to spend five days at Disney World and to see other things , &quot; one girl wrote . &quot; My little_brother has cancer and the Make-A-Wish Foundation granted him his wish to see Mickey_Mouse . It ' s great to have you flying with us. &quot; In another entry , dated Oct . 14 : &quot; I am flying home from Russia where I was born one month ago . I have been adopted by an American family from New York City . . . . My name is Vanessa and I was born in L ' Vov , Ukraine , where my birth mother had no money to support me . I know I will have a happy life in America. &quot; Other entries were unsigned and written as if in Scooter ' s voice : &quot; Here I am in glorious ancient Rome . . . . most impressive are the ancient Roman ruins of the Forum , the Colosseum , the Pantheon and the Baths of Caracalla , &quot; reads one entry . In another , from Greece , &quot; . . . On Thursday we went_to Hydra where we went_on a tour of the island on a donkey. &quot; Many of Scooter ' s companions gave detailed descriptions of geography , population , natural_resources and other facts about the countries they saw . One entry written_on a flight to Moscow outlines the relationship of the former republics . &quot; With the volatile political situation in the former Soviet_Union , this gave me an opportunity to teach about that and put it in some perspective , &quot; Laines said . Laines , 29 , said he was pleased that the experiment worked . The bear ' s return helped restore some of his &quot; faith in human nature , &quot; he said . &quot; I liked the suspense , &quot; 13-year-old Manuel Chavez said . &quot; We were always thinking ( Scooter ) wasn ' t going_to make it. &quot; Laines ' students are eager to send the bear_on his way again , possibly through Asia or South_America . But their teacher is not sure he wants to press his luck , especially after Scooter disappeared for two months during his maiden voyage . The class had stopped receiving postcards in October , and Scooter was not heard from until Jan . 6 , when Laines received a call from the LAX baggage department . Scooter was sitting in a cardboard box , unharmed . The students breathed a collective sigh of relief upon Scooter ' s return , but Laines said he is still baffled . &quot; I ' d love to know what happened during that time ( before January ) , &quot; Laines said . Since Scooter ' s tag requested he be returned to Los Angeles by Jan . 1 , Laines said he figures someone probably returned the bear early .</TEXT>
