   <HEADLINE> N . KOREA , IN ABRUPT SHIFT , OFFERS PLAN TO RESTART U.S. TALKS ; DIPLOMACY : PYONGYANG DELIVERS COMPROMISE THROUGH EX-PRESIDENT CARTER . REGIME WOULD FREEZE NUCLEAR PROGRAM , ALLOW INSPECTORS TO STAY . CLINTON IS HOPEFUL BUT CAUTIOUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> North_Korea abruptly offered a compromise Thursday in its dispute with the United States over its nuclear facilities and President Clinton said it might prove acceptable -- raising the possibility of a breakthrough in what has been an escalating confrontation . The North_Korean proposal , delivered through former President Jimmy_Carter , asks_for a resumption of broad , high-level political and economic talks with the United States in return for Pyongyang freezing its nuclear program and allowing international inspectors to stay in the country . Clinton , who spoke_to reporters late Thursday after meeting with his top national security advisers , said Washington would seek to confirm details of the offer through diplomatic channels in the next few days and might accept it if it proves genuine . &quot; If today ' s developments mean that North_Korea is genuinely and verifiably prepared to freeze its nuclear program while talks go_on . . . , then we would be willing to resume high-level talks , &quot; the President said . &quot; We will just have to see , &quot; he added later . But U.S. officials made_it clear that the United States also would insist on conditions of its own , including that Pyongyang stop reprocessing its spent fuel rods and refueling its current reactor and that it cooperate fully with international inspectors . Officials said Clinton and his advisers discussed options for strengthening U.S. military_capability in and around South_Korea but reached no final_decisions . They said that possibilities included sending radar-evading Stealth bombers to South_Korea . It was not immediately clear whether the two sides would be able to agree on specifics of a compromise . Despite the initial euphoria over the North_Korean proposal , the offer essentially would return the situation to where it was last spring , before Pyongyang blocked inspections of its nuclear plant . But officials suggested that Pyongyang ' s gesture Thursday might provide a face-saving way for both sides to ease tensions and possibly avert a fight over imposition of U.N. economic sanctions against North_Korea , now being considered by the Security_Council . Robert L . Gallucci , assistant secretary_of_state for political affairs , said the Clinton_Administration would begin pursuing the North_Korean proposal through U.N. diplomatic channels in New York today . &quot; Can it -- will it -- take the steam out of sanctions ? &quot; Clinton asked rhetorically , referring to the U.S. proposal for an economic embargo . &quot; It depends_on the facts . . . , &quot; he said . &quot; And that is what we will attempt to determine over the next several hours. &quot; Clinton ' s unexpected appearance before reporters Thursday reflected the belief of his senior foreign_policy advisers that he should explain the situation on the Korean_peninsula and the nation ' s stake in it to the American public . Advisers had grown increasingly concerned that reports on the international showdown over North_Korea ' s suspected nuclear_weapons program had alarmed Americans without clearly informing them of the nature of the threat and how the Administration was responding . Administration officials said that , as a result , the President would make more public appearances to enunciate his foreign_policy in coming weeks . The latest developments began in an initial meeting between Carter and North_Korean leader Kim Il Sung . The former President is visiting Pyongyang ostensibly as a private citizen , at the request of the North_Korean government . A few minutes after the session , Carter called the White_House to outline what he had been told and described the basic elements of the proposal in an interview on Cable News Network , which had been permitted to follow the former President into North_Korea . Clinton , who on Wednesday had been urging the imposition of a series of gradual sanctions on Pyongyang , huddled with top foreign_policy advisers Thursday as White_House officials tried to fend_off questions about how the Administration would respond . Finally , in the evening , Gallucci delivered the Administration ' s formal reply , clearly hoping to strike a balance between being responsive to the North_Korean proposal and being prudent -- even wary -- about how genuine it might be . U.S. officials said Washington still intends to push its sanctions proposal at the United Nations , at least until it is certain of the details of the North_Korean offer . Regarding U.S. military_capability in the region , Clinton said the United States &quot; will do whatever is necessary &quot; to reinforce security for 37 # 000 American troops helping South_Korea protect its border with the North . As described by Carter in his television appearance , the North_Korean offer contains these major elements : * Pyongyang wants the United States to resume plans for a third round of high-level talks with North_Korean officials on a broad range of political and economic issues , including substantial aid and closer diplomatic ties -- possibly ending in full-fledged recognition . * It wants stronger U.S. pressure in negotiations with South_Korea on achieving a &quot; denuclearized Korean_peninsula &quot; -- a stated goal of both sides that the North_Koreans say the South has not pursued genuinely . * North_Korea wants help in replacing its two old-style graphite-moderated nuclear_reactors -- which routinely produce material that can be converted into weapons-grade plutonium -- with light-water reactors that are not associated with such byproducts . * In return , Pyongyang would abandon its earlier plans to expel two inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency , which it announced earlier this week , and will freeze construction on a second reactor that could be used to reprocess spent nuclear fuel . There also were some reports that North_Korea ' s Kim had asked_for direct contact with Clinton but U.S. officials suggested that no such session would be possible until further progress is made on broader talks . The United States had offered Pyongyang virtually everything on its list before the North_Koreans began rejecting the atomic agency ' s inspection requirements . Carter was to have another round of talks with Kim today . Meanwhile , Russia , apparently miffed because it did not believe it had been consulted adequately by the Administration on the proposed sanctions , said it would refuse to support the measure in the Security_Council , at least for now . But Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev , who complained about the United States to reporters , did not say whether Moscow would veto the sanctions resolution . He said he hopes to discuss the proposal soon with Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher . Times staff writers John M . Broder in Washington , Sam Jameson in Tokyo and Richard Boudreaux in Moscow contributed to this report .</TEXT>
