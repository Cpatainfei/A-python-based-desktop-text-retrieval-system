   <HEADLINE> LITTLE GROWTH OR DECLINE IN MEMBERSHIP IS SEEN AT NATION ' S CHURCHES ; TRENDS : THE SIZE OF DENOMINATIONS HELD STEADY FROM 1991 TO 1992 , DATA SHOWS . MOST REPORTED INCREASES OR DECREASES OF 1 % OR LESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Church growth appears to be flattening_out in the United States . The good news is that not one of the nation ' s 10 largest church bodies reported a membership decline of more_than 1 % in the new &quot; Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches 1994. &quot; But neither were there any signs of dramatic church growth , with most churches reporting increases of less than 1 % . For churches such_as the Southern Baptist Convention , coming_off a generation of rapid increases that helped it become the nation ' s largest Protestant_denomination , the church growth figures indicate a spiritual malaise . &quot; We ' re crying_out to God for a fresh touch for our land . We pray that it will fall upon Presbyterians , Episcopalians and Baptists , &quot; said the Rev . Mark Coppenger , a Southern Baptist spokesman . &quot; that ' s our main agenda right now -- revival in America. &quot; The church membership figures , collected by the National Council of Churches , are not always comparable from denomination to denomination because most church groups keep their own statistics and use different methods for determining their memberships . Some denominations only make estimates . But the church council says that the yearbook data is as near an official record of denominational statistics as is available . In the latest edition of the yearbook , no substantial membership changes were reported by the nation ' s 10 largest churches from 1991 to 1992 . &quot; This year represents a fairly stable year across the board , &quot; said Kenneth Bedell , yearbook editor . The National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc. reported a 2.5 % membership gain , going from 8 million to 8.2 million members . The Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints reported a 2.16 % jump from 1991 to 1992 , with membership increasing to 4.43 million . The nation ' s largest religious group , the Roman_Catholic_Church , grew 1.63 % to 59.2 million members in 1992 , according to the yearbook . But most large church bodies reported membership gains or declines of less than 1 % . The Evangelical Lutheran_Church in America lost two-tenths of a percent to drop to 5 # 235 , 000 and the Presbyterian_Church ( U.S.A. ) dropped . 53 % to 3 # 758 , 000 . The Episcopal Church added about 20 # 000 members to increase slightly to 2 # 492 , 000 . The United Methodist_Church dropped . 71 % to 8 # 727 , 000 . For mainline churches , such membership figures are blessings compared to the steep declines of past decades , which cost them substantial portions of their flocks . &quot; I think what we are observing in the denomination is , in a sense , some good news , because the rate of loss has been reduced , &quot; said the Rev . Mearle Griffith of the United Methodist General Council on Ministries . Not only has the rate of membership loss been halved in the last two or three years , he said , but some annual conferences are reporting membership gains . Conservative religious groups , which had enjoyed steady growth in recent years , are now facing leaner years . The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod reported growing less than a tenth of a percent to 2.6 million members . The Southern Baptist Convention reported an increase of . 83 % to 15.36 million members . Sociologist William McKinney , dean of the Hartford Seminary in Connecticut , said membership trends seem to follow sociological trends . Protestant_denominations that have lost up_to a third of their members since the mid-1960s are down to a more committed core of members , McKinney said . &quot; It ' s hard to lose more people when you start from a smaller base , &quot; he said . Meanwhile , growth in conservative denominations has been slowed by lower population growth in the United States and the fact that many immigrants from Latin_America , Asia and the Middle_East are not the traditional pool from which conservative Protestant_churches draw members , he said . Coppenger , vice_president for convention relations of the Southern Baptist Convention , said the news is not all bad . &quot; We ' re still growing at the rate of 750 members and five churches a week , &quot; he said . Still , he said , the denomination is envious not only of its past success but of church growth movements in other parts of the world , such_as Korea , Kenya and throughout Eastern Europe . &quot; It seems there ' s a hardening in America that you don ' t find in some of the mission fields around the world , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
