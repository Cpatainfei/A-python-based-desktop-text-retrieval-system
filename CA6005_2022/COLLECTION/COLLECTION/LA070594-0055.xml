   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; DOLLAR BOUNCES_BACK IN TOKYO SESSIONS ; TRADING : WITH U.S. EXCHANGES SHUT DOWN FOR THE HOLIDAY , ACTIVITY OVERSEAS IS SUBDUED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dollar climbed back above 99 yen early today in Tokyo , recovering from a record low on Monday and inspiring a morning rally in Japanese stocks . Trading worldwide on Monday was becalmed by the Independence_Day holiday in the United States . In between Tokyo trading sessions , the greenback rose slightly against European currencies . With U.S. financial markets closed for the holiday , international attention was turned toward a string of key financial meetings this week -- the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee , the German central_bank ' s policy-making council and the Group of Seven summit in Naples , Italy . Foreign stocks were generally higher and gold prices rose . In Tokyo , the 225-issue Nikkei average gained back most of its Friday loss , adding 88.52 points , or 0.43 % , to close at 20 # 631.93 on Monday . It continued its advance this morning , moving above 20 # 800 . &quot; The market was up ( Monday ) because there was no new bad news , &quot; said Jonathan Davis , broker at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities in Japan . The dollar had closed Monday at 98.67 yen in Tokyo , down from Friday ' s 98.78 close . &quot; The ( G-7 ) summit is a political carnival and you can ' t really expect much support for the greenback to come from it , &quot; said Kaoru Ichikawa , a broker at Kokusai Securities . The dollar has been sliding against the yen over the last few weeks because of confusion about U.S. policy to support the greenback , concerns about U.S.-Japan trade negotiations and bearish speculators . The dollar has also fallen because traders expect U.S. interest_rates to rise . Higher rates erode the value of U.S. bonds and cause foreign investors to look elsewhere . But despite the dollar ' s troubles , many economists believe policy-makers at the Federal_Reserve will not raise interest_rates this week to defend the greenback , deciding instead to put the domestic economy ahead of global currency concerns . The Fed ' s policy-making group meets behind closed doors today and Wednesday . This view , however , is not universal . There are some analysts who think the Fed will boost rates to shore_up the dollar . The Fed has already pushed short-term interest_rates up three times this year . Meanwhile , Japan ' s trade surplus dipped 6.7 % in May , as the country used its strong currency to import more goods , the Finance Ministry said Monday .</TEXT>
