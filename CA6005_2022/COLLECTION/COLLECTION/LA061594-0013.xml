   <HEADLINE> HORMONES AND SEX_DRIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a Los Angeles endocrinologist who frequently treats women with hormonal disturbances , I am compelled to comment on a most peculiar column ( &quot; Whose Sex_Drive Needs Fixing ? &quot; by Karen Engberg , Commentary , May 30 ) . The author , a family-practice physician in Santa Barbara , decried the use of testosterone to improve sexual function in menopausal women , charging that this practice is motivated by purely masculine criteria . She is troubled by a report that women complaining of reduced ( rather than deficient ) sexual_desires described a marked improvement in their own sexual satisfaction , following hormonal therapy . She suggests that these efforts were fueled by their husbands , rather than themselves , and that men might want to consider reducing their own overweening libidos , to meet their partner ' s lesser needs . Taking the doctor ' s comments at face_value , I questioned several of my patients in whom the masculine hormone , testosterone , had been deficient , by female standards . I knew that their diminished libidos had undergone remarkable improvement , restoring them to the level of a previous norm , when treated with this hormone , which is normally present in women . These women insisted , with some humor , that women are normally quite sexual , and that their particular problems had been related to a drop_in , rather than a lifelong lack of sex_drive . Hormone therapy improved the sex lives , not only of their partners , but principally of themselves . These responses are consistent with the reports of Barbara Sherwin of McGill University , a leader in the field who has reported not only an increase in sexuality , but in energy and a general feeling of well-being , when menopausal women are treated with testosterone , as an adjunct to estrogen . Sexual activity is a pleasing biological function , as normal and as essential as eating one ' s dinner . Noted for its anti-depressant influences , it is a tremendous source of tension release . In contrast , lifelong celibacy flies in the face of nature , and is the artificial , rationalized perversion of a natural biological urge . In a holistic sense , diminished libido is often just one of a constellation of abnormal symptoms indicating the possible presence of depression , and can be an indicator of postpartum depression . It seems ironic that I , a male , should promulgate sexual equality , while Engberg , a female , using feminism as the Trojan_horse for her bizarre agenda , proposes a medieval , &quot; let ' s all be miserable together &quot; approach to female sexuality . I have no knowledge of Dr. Engberg ' s agenda . I am at_a_loss to understand where Dr. Engberg is coming from . JOHN O ' DEA MD Los Angeles * In response to Karen Engberg ' s concerns about women being hormonally manipulated to keep pace with male sexual demands , I would like to offer another perspective . When disease , Lupron injections and surgery combined to pull the plug on my libido in my early 40s , not only my husband but I felt the loss . The ability to enjoy one ' s sexuality is as important to a woman ' s emotional well-being and sense of self as it is to her marriage . I am grateful that androgens have helped restore what I lost and that I can look_forward to continued physical intimacy with my loving husband . Many women who feel the stirrings of desire slipping_away in menopause might choose a hormonal solution -- even without pressure from men . SANDY HOTCHKISS Pasadena</TEXT>
