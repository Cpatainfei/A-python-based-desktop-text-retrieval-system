   <HEADLINE> CBS ON WAY TO OLYMPICS RATINGS GOLD ; TELEVISION : THE WINTER GAMES ARE PROVING TO BE A WINNER AS THE NETWORK HEADS FOR THE HIGHEST RATINGS FOR ANY OLYMPICS . THE HARDING-KERRIGAN DRAMA IS ONLY PART OF THE APPEAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even before the final chapter in &quot; Skategate , &quot; the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan soap_opera , the 1994 Winter_Olympics have brought ratings gold to CBS . Record numbers of viewers have been tuning_in to the Winter Games from Lillehammer , Norway , and CBS is_on its way to achieving the highest ratings for any Olympics , network executives said Wednesday . &quot; During the first week of the Olympics , CBS had its highest rating ever in the history of the network , &quot; said David Poltrack , vice_president in_charge of audience research . &quot; We are currently pacing at a_level that will give us an Olympics ratings record , whether for Summer or Winter Olympics. &quot; Through the first 10 days of the Winter Games , the network has averaged nearly a 26 rating in prime_time ( which translates to more_than 24 million homes ) . The previous record for that period was ABC ' s 23.6 rating for the 1980 Olympics at Lake Placid , which featured the surprise win by the U.S. hockey_team . CBS said that , at mid-point , some 170 million viewers had tuned_in to watch at least some of its extensive Winter_Olympics coverage , with the much-anticipated competition between Harding and Kerrigan still to come . * As for why people have been watching in such great numbers , CBS executives could only guess . They acknowledged that the massive international publicity surrounding Harding and Kerrigan aided them in the ratings , but they noted that people would n ' t be watching this much if that was the only thing that interested them -- especially since the women ' s figure_skating didn ' t get under way until Wednesday night and was to continue Friday night . &quot; We were obviously given a great tune-in audience by the Harding-Kerrigan controversy , but the fact that we ' ve held that audience night after night means that people are satisfied with what they ' re seeing , &quot; said George Schweitzer , vice_president in_charge of marketing for CBS . &quot; We emphasized that the Olympics are about human stories , and we talked_about Dan Jansen , Bonnie Blair &quot; and other U.S. athletes . CBS designed its prime-time broadcasts by studying the coverage from the Albertville Olympics in 1992 , analyzing which events were most popular_with viewers . Figure_skating , for example , is very popular_with women , and so there has been skating nearly every night . And the demographics for the 1994 Olympics are running about 60 % female , CBS executives said . Television ratings for the Olympics also are running high in other countries , according to the U.S. Olympic Committee , which may lend credence to the &quot; global water cooler &quot; theory that , with fewer major attractions to bind them , people in the United States and around the globe are enjoying being part of an international event that they know the whole world is watching . The record ratings for CBS are not directly paying_off financially , however , because the network had sold commercial time this year based on an 18.6 rating . So it ' s the advertisers who are benefiting by getting the additional viewership at no additional cost . But CBS was able to sell a_few 30-second spots that had been held_back in case it got a lower rating than had been promised and had to make_up the difference to an advertiser . The cost for one of those spots in women ' s figure_skating ? About $ 430 # 000 -- compared to the average $ 325 # 000 paid by sponsors who paid in_advance . The bigger payoff for CBS will come when it begins to sell commercials for the 1998 Winter_Olympics , because those prices will be based on the ratings garnered this time_out . Some viewers and TV critics have criticized CBS for excessively &quot; cross-promoting &quot; the Olympics on various programs , but the strategy apparently has worked , not only in terms of the Olympics ratings but in ratings for the other shows . &quot; CBS This Morning &quot; is expected to beat &quot; Today &quot; and &quot; Good_Morning America &quot; for the first time ever in the ratings this week , the &quot; CBS Evening News &quot; jumped from its usual third position to a strong second last week , and David Letterman ' s ratings last week were the highest since the week his show premiered .</TEXT>
