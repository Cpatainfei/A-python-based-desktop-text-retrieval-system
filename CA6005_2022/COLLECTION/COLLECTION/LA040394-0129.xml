   <HEADLINE> LOCKED IN A LONG-TIME CONFRONTATION , INDIA AND PAKISTAN REPLAY THE COLD_WAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott reaches India this week , and Pakistan a_few days later , he will encounter bended knees and muted rage . India , con vinced that the United States has forced Indian-U.S. relations_to their lowest point in years , hyperbolically vilifies U.S. policy and stubbornly resists any proposals to alter its attitudes . In contrast , Pakistan believes that after several strained years , it is headed for warmer relations with the United States . Both assessments embrace elements of truth . Washington has stumbled in its efforts to craft a new power balance in South Asia . India feels alternately ignored and deified , and interprets U.S. statements with rancor and regret . Pakistan has yet to overcome its simultaneous dependence and defiance toward the American hand that has so often fed it . It is little wonder that America feels dismayed and bewildered . Talbott , with Assistant Secretary_of_State Robin L . Raphel , is therefore off to mend fences . Those fences are as much historical as current . Talbott will discover that the Cold_War has not ended in South Asia and a new Cold_War between India and Pakistan -- provoked largely by the conflict in Kashmir -- simmers on . He will also discover that remaking U.S. policy requires understanding past misperceptions and misconceived policies . For too long , the United States justified its interest in South Asia by viewing it as a place on_the_road to somewhere more important -- China , Afghanistan , the Soviet_Union -- and foolishly took sides in bilateral disputes to further its goals . Disentangling the United States from the old Cold_War without heating_up the new one is a complicated business . The most immediate irritant is the stalled delivery of F-16 fighter planes to Pakistan . They were sold to longtime U.S. ally Gen . Mohammed Zia ul Haq , who saw them as a reward for services rendered in Afghanistan and a validation of Pakistan ' s strategic aims in the region . India believes that adding_to Pakistan ' s stock of F-16 and Mirage jets will heighten tensions and warns that it will counterbalance Pakistani capacities -- cyclically reflecting Pakistani worries . India thus has lobbied against future aid to Pakistan . Until now , this concern was speculative . In 1990 , the United States canceled not only all foreign assistance to Pakistan but also delivery of the F-16s . The 1985 Pressler Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act required this until Washington certified that Pakistan cannot make nuclear_weapons . But the Pressler amendment unbalanced South Asia even more , and the timing of sanctions -- invoked only after the work was done_in Afghanistan -- gave Pakistan reason to distrust Washington . With Pakistan punished but not India , neither state had incentive to change direction . India points to China ' s nuclear capacities as the primary justification for its program . It feels that U.S.-mandated reductions , while potentially balancing its power relative to Pakistan , would weaken its posture toward China . To India , arms control looks suspiciously like a pro-Pakistani policy . Both India and Pakistan think Washington belittles their security concerns , and thus play the nuclear card in domestic politics , sometimes irresponsibly . The goal of non-proliferation was temporarily lost when Pakistan announced its nuclear capabilities in 1991 . This winter , India tested delivery systems . India and Pakistan are increasing conventional-arms stocks while stirring the nuclear pot . The GOP Administrations that sold the F-16s and then suspended aid , and the Pakistan government that acknowledged its nuclear capacities in response , no longer rule . President Bill_Clinton and Pakistan ' s Prime_Minister Benazir Bhutto and India ' s Prime_Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao all inherited policies they did not promote , and all should put this issue behind them quickly . Otherwise , they will be hemmed_in by policies that predate the dissolution of the Soviet_Union . The old Cold_War will determine politics on the subcontinent long after the world has moved_on to other problems . Pakistan has lobbied to receive the F-16s , viewing their delivery as success against Pressler . It has paid $ 658 million for the jets , whose production to Pakistani specifications continued after sanctions were imposed . Washington held_out the carrot of delivery to moderate the blunt stick of sanctions -- a short-term tactic that is no substitute for long-term policy_changes . Pakistan says it capped its nuclear program in 1990 , but has not agreed to Pressler-mandated inspections . If the United States , India and Pakistan believe , as all say they do , that non-proliferation is imperative , it is time to change strategy . One way is for Washington to return Pakistan ' s payments . Though this would create complex legal tangles between the U.S._government and its arms suppliers , these difficulties might force Congress to act more responsibly in setting sanctions , and provide some impetus for Congress and the executive_branch to coordinate policy . It could also give Bhutto much-needed cash and badly needed negotiating room on a wide range of military and strategic issues . Moreover , this would remove the object of India ' s immediate concerns and force New Delhi to reconsider the substance of its arms-control possibilities . All parties could then reconsider contemporary security needs rather than outdated ones . Another is for Washington to take a stronger stand on the Kashmir conflict . Pakistan considers Kashmir a war of self-determination ; India considers it an internal dispute aggravated by Pakistani meddling . Washington treats it as a bilateral territorial dispute . The United States thus falls_into two traps : it dampens the voice of Kashmiris , and it allows an explicitly international issue -- the protection of rights -- to be reduced to a matter of barter in stalled talks between India and Pakistan . Until Washington makes clear that Kashmiri rights must be respected as a matter of right -- and , correlatively , that Kashmiris should determine their own fate -- U.S. persuasive power in any other policy arena will be limited . Kashmir will remain an excuse for India and Pakistan to refuse serious arms limits and marginalize outside concern . India and Pakistan know their democracies can be defeated by their foreign_policies . The strength of concurrent democratic commitment in India and Pakistan provides a chance for the United States to help them match their democratic rhetoric with peaceful action . Talbott ' s visit offers a rare opportunity to highlight some important truths about Clinton ' s foreign_policy . South Asia can underscore the success of the Administration ' s priorities , or witness their collective weakness . Preventive diplomacy , sustainable development and democracy , multilateralism , rights and non-proliferation -- all are clear , present and possible in the subcontinent today . Talbott ' s foray can demonstrate U.S. commitment to these global goals by attaching them -- rigorously and evenhandedly -- to both India and Pakistan . Only then will balanced development , stability and security be possible .</TEXT>
