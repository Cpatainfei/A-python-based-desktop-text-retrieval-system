   <HEADLINE> SCIENCE ; U.S. HAS CHIPPED AWAY AT STASH OF MOON ROCKS ; SCIENTISTS USE CORE SAMPLES FROM APOLLO MISSIONS TO PROBE LUNAR PUZZLES . ONLY 4 OF 54 REMAIN UNTOUCHED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the last Apollo astronaut ' s memory has blurred , the only real evidence of humanity ' s first venture to another world will be a cache of gray rocks in a guarded vault that proves Earth and the moon , however distant , are one . Twenty-five years after the Apollo 11 astronauts returned to Earth with the first bag of moon rocks , 65 scientists around the world still are using NASA ' s unique collection of lunar samples to analyze the history of Earth ' s nearest neighbor . Rarer than diamonds , as closely guarded as bank bullion , the nondescript chunks of breccia , feldspar and basalt plucked from the surface of the moon have helped open a window into the earliest moments of the solar_system , answering some of the most fundamental puzzles about the moon and its origin . &quot; In retrospect , it was almost comical how ignorant people were about the moon , &quot; said James L . Gooding , curator of the lunar sample laboratory at NASA ' s Johnson Space Center in Houston , where the moon rocks are stored . &quot; There were lots of theories , lots of ideas and a complete lack of information . What the samples have taught us so far is the skeleton of lunar history , &quot; Gooding said . &quot; There are a lot of gaps . Twenty-five years later , people are still asking_for details. &quot; To satisfy the demand , lab technician Linda Watts is still slicing moon rocks . She has worked in the lab 17 years . At a measured pace that makes a diamond cutter seem precipitous , Watts takes six months to prepare the samples from a single pristine core of moon rock . Three times a year , a committee doles out the samples . One day soon , however , she will have worked herself out of a job . Apollo astronauts brought_back 54 core samples from the lunar surface . Now only four are unopened and uncontaminated . Five years ago , there were eight . In all , the 12 Apollo astronauts who walked on the moon from 1969 to 1973 collected 842 pounds of lunar rocks , pebbles and dust from six spots on the moon . With no plans to return to the moon , there is no chance that anyone will prospect for more soon . The only other known lunar rocks are a_few meteorites found on the Antarctic ice sheet in the past decade . &quot; When the science community realized that this was the world ' s fixed , limited supply of lunar samples , they became pretty concerned about their safety , &quot; Gooding said . NASA takes extraordinary care to keep its rocks unsullied by Earth ' s atmosphere or bacteria . Each sample is stored inside a double thickness of Teflon and then bolted inside a sealed stainless_steel container flooded with nitrogen gas . The containers are isolated by an air_lock and a 14-ton vault door with two separate combination_locks . The vault is monitored by security_guards , motion sensors and video cameras . The agency also follows an elaborate accounting procedure to ensure none are lost or stolen . Whatever their inherent scientific value , the moon rocks also are souvenirs of a $ 25-billion space race with the Soviet_Union , in which U.S. astronauts won by simply touching the moon . Today , there is a piece of the moon in almost every state and nearly every one of the world ' s nations , most distributed as diplomatic largess in the Richard Nixon-era &quot; spirit of Apollo. &quot; There is even a piece of the moon in Pasadena -- on display at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory . After decades of investigation , the moon samples convey a complex saga to scientists . The chemistry of the rocks suggests the moon formed from the same material as the planet it orbits , providing key evidence for the theory that the moon was formed out of the molten splash caused when some object collided_with Earth 4.5 billion years ago -- the approximate age of the oldest moon rocks . The rocks show that the moon has never known life , has no water , and no sedimentary layering . All of the rocks examined were produced by extreme heat and melting caused by volcanic_eruptions or by intense meteor bombardment . The rocks also revealed the one thing scientists had not expected -- traces of a planetary magnetic_field like Earth ' s . Increasingly self-conscious about the dwindling store of pristine moon samples , lunar scientists are quick to take_advantage of advances in electron-beam probes and other techniques that allow them to look_for trace_elements , isotopes and other characteristics . &quot; In 1970 , to do that kind of analysis , you would have needed a chunk of rock big enough to hold_in your hand , &quot; Gooding said . &quot; In 25 years , the technology has advanced to_the_point you can do the same thing with a tiny grain of material. &quot;</TEXT>
