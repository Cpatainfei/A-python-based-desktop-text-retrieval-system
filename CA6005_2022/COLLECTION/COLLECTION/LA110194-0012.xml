   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEW ; ' FRONTLINE ' FOCUSES_ON OFFSHORE TAX HAVENS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tax loopholes are the classic case of &quot; if you provide it , they will come. &quot; And come they have to the tax havens of the Caribbean_islands from the Caymans to the_Virgins . But as tonight ' s &quot; Frontline &quot; report &quot; Hot Money &quot; indicates , the offshore islands have sheltered more_than accounts meant to elude the tax man . For years , especially in the boom time of the 1980s , scores of banks in these British protectorates wittingly or unwittingly served as conduits for money-laundering operations crucial to the global drug trade . Despite supposed crackdowns on phony paper companies set_up for the laundering , the number of companies registered in the_British Virgin Islands alone has jumped from 5 # 000 to 120 # 000 in 10 years . Isn ' t the offshore haven merely a nice perk of making money ? Yes , but it permits a brazen flouting of U.S. laws by U.S. citizens . When $ 300 billion due in U.S. tax_revenues is redirected to the island banks , or when insurance_company customers discover that their carrier is a paper company without real assets , or when criminals have such a safe spot for their cash , then it ' s time for the law to step_in . But the FBI cannot simply swoop down on the islands and nail the bad_guys . The law in the protectorates , overseen by British authorities , enforces complete secrecy in financial transactions . The law not only created the offshore business industry , it also brought wealth to the islands . According to Shaun Murphy , who once administered a large money-laundering operation , the island governments have no interest in snooping into the banks or firms that set_up shop . Nevertheless , some U.S. pressure has caused a little reform_movement by British overseers , and the FBI and Scotland_Yard have begun a joint investigation . The joint powers of the BBC and &quot; Frontline &quot; also manage to expose the schemes of John Matthewson , founder of Guardian Bank on Grand Cayman Island , who is recorded explaining how to launder cash . But the report suggests that any further reforms to completely wipe_out the account-secrecy laws are likely to be sunk by British political stubbornness . * &quot; Hot Money &quot; airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 , and at 8 on KVCR-TV Channel 24 .</TEXT>
