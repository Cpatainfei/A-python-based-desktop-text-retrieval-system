   <HEADLINE> SOUTH BAY NEWS ; SVORINICH GRAPPLES WITH EXODUS OF STAFF_MEMBERS ; GOVERNMENT : FORMER AIDES AIR CRITICISM OF FRESHMAN COUNCILMAN . BUT HE DISMISSES BARBS AS ACTS OF REPRISAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Barely seven months after winning election , Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr . finds his office in upheaval with the departure of six aides , including his chief deputy and longtime friend , John Vidovich . While the long-term impact of the firings and resignations is uncertain , what is clear is that the paint-store-owner-turned-politician must spend the coming weeks repairing an office that has seen the biggest City_Hall exodus in recent years . And that alone could make his next few months as bumpy as the last ones , especially with once-loyal former aides now airing sharp criticism of their former boss , whose district stretches from Watts to San Pedro . &quot; I feel very betrayed , &quot; said Brian Hannon , who had been Svorinich ' s field deputy in Harbor City and Harbor Gateway . &quot; I truly believed_in him , believed he was the common_man -- the man with grass-roots support -- who could make a difference at City Hall. &quot; Now , Hannon said : &quot; I don ' t know what to believe . I have lost all respect for him . I have lost all trust in him. &quot; Said another former aide , John Barbieri : &quot; We have all reached the same conclusion that Rudy has a problem : He is simply unable to tell the truth. &quot; In an interview this week , Svorinich dismissed the criticism as predictable reactions to his decision to overhaul the office . &quot; Don ' t you think if you were the person who was asked to leave that you would be very ashamed that your employer no longer had confidence in you ( and ) that you were going_to rationalize any way you could that you . . . are not the bad_guy ? &quot; Svorinich said . He also sought to discount any long-term consequences to his office stemming from the departures . &quot; When all else is said and done , I have to do what is best for people of the 15th Council District . that ' s my job . And I will continue to do that , &quot; he said , predicting the staff positions -- almost half his office -- would be filled within 30 days . The turmoil began Jan . 20 when Vidovich resigned with a biting four-page memo to Svorinich . &quot; Rudy , we have been friends for a long_time , and I feel that this position I ' m in is_on the verge of seriously damaging a 20-year friendship , &quot; wrote Vidovich , an L.A. city fire captain who took a leave from that job to join Svorinich ' s office . Vidovich , 33 , intended to work in the office up_to two years . But his memo portrays his tenure with Svorinich as an exasperating experience . Among other things , the memo claims , Svorinich often ignored his staff , was indecisive on important issues and had alienated both staff and other council_members with his actions . &quot; Rudy , you have to get your act together . You have to stop canceling meetings , stop lying to your staff , and spend more time developing relationships with your colleagues , &quot; Vidovich wrote . &quot; Basically , you have to mature and grow up. &quot; Hannon , 29 , who left teaching to become a field deputy , said he decided to leave after a frustrating two-hour meeting with Svorinich the same day Vidovich resigned . During that meeting , Hannon said , he confronted Svorinich over the councilman ' s refusal to follow recommendations of his staff . Barbieri , an aide to former Rep . Glenn Anderson ( D-Long Beach ) and a congressional candidate himself , charged that Svorinich had undermined his staff and its ability to serve the public . &quot; Your compulsive lying , lack of personal integrity and outright bumbling of your official duties does great harm to the community that has placed its trust in you , and diminishes the value of the office you hold , &quot; Barbieri wrote in a resignation memo submitted after a meeting with Svorinich . Svorinich insisted that such criticism was news to him -- proving , he said , the attacks were motivated by reprisal . &quot; In my first seven months in office , I never had a harsh word , a reprimand or any significant disagreement with any member of my staff . Ever . Nor did a staff_member , until the resignation of John Vidovich . . . ever come_up_to me and say , ' I have a problem with you. ' &quot; Nevertheless , there was additional criticism involving Svorinich ' s office that is unlikely to disappear in the near future . Several former aides , for example , have alleged that political contributions were accepted by staff at a San Pedro field office -- a practice that violates the city ' s ethics laws . In one instance , the date of which is unclear , an envelope containing contribution checks to Svorinich were delivered to the office and taken by a council aide who later reported the incident to the city ' s Ethics Commission . And though Svorinich said the_matter was closed , an Ethics Commission official , as is common practice , refused to confirm or deny whether an inquiry is under way . Meantime , as Svorinich confidently announced his search for new staff , some former aides predicted his quest would all but cripple his political agenda . &quot; I think the whole district is going_to suffer , &quot; Hannon said , &quot; ( because ) Rudy is going_to become so consumed with dealing with this one problem -- all_the resignations -- that he is not going_to be able to do anything else in the district . . . He won ' t be able to do his job effectively. &quot;</TEXT>
