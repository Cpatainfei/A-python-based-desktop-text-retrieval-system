   <HEADLINE> A CONTENDER IN COMPUTERS ; PACKARD BELL MOUNTS A TURNAROUND BY STICKING TO LOW PRICES , MASS MERCHANDISING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two years ago , many observers questioned whether personal_computer manufacturer Packard Bell Electronics Inc. would survive the market ' s relentless price_cutting and cutthroat competition . Packard Bell ' s sales were growing at five times the industry average , but its profits were nose-diving as fast as the dizzying rounds of cuts_in the price of computers . The company canceled a $ 70-million stock offering intended to raise desperately needed working capital when investors were turned_off by Packard Bell ' s $ 93-million debt and negative net worth of $ 4 million as of Dec . 31 , 1991 . &quot; When everyone got_to look_at their books , they were under heavy attack . Everybody , including us , was predicting Packard Bell ' s death . But they regrouped , withstood the barrage and came_back strong . Their computers are everywhere now , &quot; said Bruce Stephen , an analyst with International Data Corp . in Framingham , Mass . In less than two years , Packard Bell has rebounded to become the fourth-largest personal-computer maker in the United States in units sold , behind IBM , Apple and Compaq , according to International Data . While some computer companies like Gateway 2000 sell personal_computers through direct sales or dealers , Beny Alagem , Packard Bell ' s chief_executive_officer , has long followed a strategy of selling his IBM-compatible PCs in high volume and as cheaply as possible through mass marketers like Montgomery Ward , Price Costco , Circuit City and Office Depot . The company was forced to move its headquarters and production facilities from Chatsworth to Westlake Village and Camarillo because of last month ' s earthquake . Its Chatsworth facilities , which were under lease , suffered extensive damage in the quake . In 1993 , Packard Bell ' s revenues grew 35 % to $ 1.25 billion , from $ 925 million in 1992 . Company officials expect 1994 revenues to hit $ 2.3 billion . This is a big change from sales of $ 676 million , and a loss of $ 798 # 000 , in 1991 . Although Packard Bell is still a private company and under no obligation to reveal its earnings , analysts who follow the company believe it is now profitable but they say Packard Bell ' s profit_margin is only 3 to 5 cents for every $ 1 of sales . Applying this formula to the $ 1.25 billion in revenues reported for 1993 , Packard Bell earned a profit of between $ 37 million and $ 62 million last year . &quot; They are nicely profitable . This company is making money , &quot; said Lloyd Greif , president of Greif &amp; Co. , an investment-banking firm in Los Angeles . Although Compaq is considerably larger than Packard Bell both in units sold and revenues , officials of the Houston-based company are keeping a wary eye on Packard Bell . &quot; Quality-wise , we still believe our products are much better . But you ' ve got_to give them credit . Packard Bell is a formidable competitor who is not going_to go_away soon , &quot; said a Compaq official who declined to be identified . How did Packard Bell complete its turnaround from the brink of collapse less than two years ago to a company that now has larger PC makers looking over their shoulders ? &quot; We have remained focused on our key channels of ( retail ) distribution . We remain committed to selling our products through retail channels &quot; rather than selling PCs through specialty_stores or direct sales , said Mal Ransom , Packard Bell ' s vice_president of marketing . Packard Bell also claims to have been the first company to sell PCs with software included , enabling consumers to take a computer out of the box , plug it in and use it immediately . Others offer a more succinct explanation . &quot; Mass merchandising , low cost . that ' s their key , &quot; said Philippe de Marcillac , analyst at Dataquest in San Jose , who follows Packard Bell . Packard Bell computers are affordable to consumers because the company sells them cheap and in volume to mass retailers like the electronics chain Circuit City . Last week , Circuit City stores were selling a Packard Bell Legend 115 model , minus the monitor , for $ 899 retail , only $ 50 more_than what Circuit City paid Packard Bell wholesale for the machine . A complete Packard Bell PC with monitor , keyboard and processor ranges from $ 1 # 100 to $ 2 # 700 at retail . But mass production and inexpensive products have not been the only keys to Packard Bell ' s fast growth . In 1993 computer maker Groupe Bull of France bought 19.9 % of Packard Bell , investing an estimated $ 50 million in the U.S. company . Packard Bell also received $ 100 million in financing from Congress Financial Corp . of New York . The infusion of cash helped Packard Bell clean_up its balance_sheet . &quot; They ' re everywhere . You can ' t walk into a major retailer or discount warehouse without seeing their computers . They ' re not at 7-Eleven yet , but who knows where their product will appear next ? &quot; said Stephen of International Data . &quot; Our studies have shown that 70 % of homes_in the United States don ' t have a personal_computer . Many of the other 30 % that have computers have old technology . that ' s an awesome market . We ' re targeting household penetration , &quot; Ransom said . Packard Bell is also attempting to penetrate the business market , but with less success . About 2 # 000 office workers polled by J.D. Power &amp; Associates in a 1993 survey listed Packard Bell as below average in user support . &quot; The main complaint from business users was that they had a difficult time getting help from Packard Bell when they experienced problems with their machines . The company ' s consumer hot_line was not very helpful , &quot; said Adrian Heryford of J.D. Power . Dell Computer ranked highest in customer satisfaction , followed by Compaq and Gateway 2000 , the only companies rated above average in the study . Apple , AST , CompuAdd , Hewlett-Packard , IBM and Packard Bell were rated below average . Packard Bell officials acknowledged the survey ' s findings , but they claim the company was the first computer maker to offer consumers a toll-free help line in the United States , in 1988 . The company claims the line handles more_than 70 # 000 calls each week , 24 hours a day , in more_than 30 languages . Despite its recent success , the company still suffers from an identity problem . Packard Bell was founded in 1987 by Alagem , Jason Barzilay and Alex Sandel . The trio purchased the name Packard Bell from Teledyne Inc. for an undisclosed sum . Older consumers still confuse the Packard Bell name with the defunct company that manufactured television_sets and radios . Others confuse it with the larger and better-known computer maker Hewlett-Packard . Still , questions remain about the reliability of the company ' s products . Do people buy Packard Bell computers because of brand loyalty or because they are the cheapest on the market ? &quot; People buy our computers because they represent the top end of technology at the right price , &quot; said Packard Bell ' s Ransom . Industry_analysts said that Packard Bell computers are usually 10 % to 20 % cheaper than those offered by IBM and Compaq . An informal poll of shoppers at Office Depot , Circuit City , Good_Guys and Wal-Mart showed that Packard Bell computers are often purchased by first-time buyers looking_for a less expensive model . &quot; My daughter is in high_school and we thought it was time to buy our first computer . I bought a Packard Bell model because it was the cheapest I could find , &quot; said Patricia Warner , who purchased a personal_computer at the Office Depot in Woodland Hills . A salesman at a Good_Guys electronics store in the San Fernando Valley said that consumers whose first personal_computers are Packard Bell models usually &quot; upgrade &quot; to IBM , Compaq or Apple when they purchase a second computer . &quot; Normally , I don ' t recommend Packard Bell . The only thing that makes them attractive is the price , &quot; said the Good_Guys salesman . According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission , in 1991 about 17 % of Packard Bell ' s monthly shipments were returned to the factory for a variety of reasons . However , Ransom said that &quot; returns and adjustments have improved considerably. &quot; But salespeople at several retail_stores said that Packard Bell computers are returned for defects more frequently than other brands . A salesman at a Good_Guys store said the Packard Bell Legend 605 on display did not work when plugged_in the first time . When store employees opened_up the personal_computer , they found a wire that was not connected to the hard_drive and corrected the problem themselves . &quot; With Packard Bell , you can take it home , and if it doesn ' t work when you plug it in , bring it back . Eventually , you ' ll get one that works , &quot; said the salesman . &quot; The return issue is not a quality issue , &quot; Ransom insisted . Instead , he compared the returns to when &quot; your wife goes shopping and buys a toaster . A few days later you decide it isn ' t what you wanted and you take it back. &quot; One thing is certain : Packard Bell is poised for major growth in 1994 . The company expects its sales to double this year in part by expanding its foreign markets in Australia , Europe , Asia and South_America , where Packard Bell maintains offices . In addition , the company will introduce a new series of multimedia machines , including computers that can be used with compact disc-read only memory software and a line of notebook_computers . Packard Bell is not hampered by high overhead . The company leases most of its facilities and runs what one analyst called &quot; a bare-bones , no-frills operation. &quot; &quot; I was in there one day , waiting to meet with ( Alagem ) . I was dressed in a business_suit and felt_out of place while waiting in the lobby . It was pretty Spartan , and there were people pushing trash_cans through the lobby in the corporate office . It was pretty amazing , &quot; said the analyst , who asked to remain anonymous . In December , Packard Bell officials announced plans to move the company headquarters and about 1 # 200 employees out of Los Angeles . The new sites under_consideration at the time included Palmdale , Salt Lake County , Utah , Portland , Ore. , Camarillo and Newbury Park . In January , four days after the Northridge earthquake , company officials told about 420 service center employees in Chatsworth they would have to move to new facilities in Utah and accept pay_cuts of up_to 30 % or be laid_off . Packard Bell said the jobs were being transferred to Utah in_order to cut the company ' s costs . The rest of the company was forced to relocate temporarily to Westlake Village and Camarillo when its Chatsworth facilities were damaged . Ransom said the company had signed a one-year lease for the new facilities and added that the company will not make a decision about whether to move until later in the year .</TEXT>
