   <HEADLINE> POWERBROKER CASTS SHADOW ON POTENTIAL PREMIER ; JAPAN : FOREIGN_MINISTER HATA COULD BECOME THE NEW PRIME_MINISTER . BUT MANY IN THE RULING COALITION OBJECT TO HIS STRATEGIST , OZAWA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tsutomu Hata , this nation ' s mild-mannered foreign_minister , was thrust into the spotlight as Japan ' s tattered coalition began discussions today on choosing a new Japanese leader . Japanese media reported the choice of Hata as a foregone_conclusion . But at a key meeting of the deputies of the eight parties in the coalition this morning , the Socialists , the Democratic Socialists and the New Party Harbinger insisted that new arrangements for decision-making first be worked_out to restrict the power of Hata ' s strategist , Ichiro Ozawa -- who served as the mastermind for outgoing Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa -- in any Hata government . Ozawa , for his part , told reporters that he pushed for an agreement on policies the new government would follow on the economy , tax reform and North_Korea . The deputies scheduled another meeting for this afternoon . Wataru Kubo , the Socialists ' secretary_general , had predicted Tuesday that a decision on a successor might be made today . NHK , the semi-governmental national TV and radio network , reported that a quick decision is unlikely but said the lower house is expected to elect a new prime_minister early next week . Already , reports were circulating about of likely appointments in a Hata Cabinet . Kubo , for example , was cited as the choice for chief Cabinet secretary . Hata , one of the rebels who bolted the Liberal Democratic Party last June and deprived it of its majority , had been one of the former ruling party ' s chief advocates of political reform . His experience as both finance_minister and agriculture minister was expected to help him carry_out reforms of Japan ' s economy that Hosokawa had promised . Last Friday , Hosokawa accepted responsibility for a controversy over his personal financial dealings and declared his intention to resign to break a parliamentary boycott that has prevented enactment of the fiscal 1994 budget . Although his coalition appeared to be_on the brink of a split , its members apparently realized they could not succeed in their rival attempts to link up with segments of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to elect a prime_minister . Ozawa had sent_out feelers to an eager Michio Watanabe , 70 , a Liberal Democratic bigwig , to join his Renewal Party and the Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party in a new mix that would exclude the left-leaning Socialists . On Monday , Watanabe declared he had &quot; the will , the spirit and the physical strength &quot; to serve as prime_minister . But by Tuesday night , it became clear he did not have the votes . Watanabe -- who resigned as foreign_minister and deputy prime_minister a year ago because of ill_health -- would have to gather at least 80 Liberal Democratic defectors to win a lower house election for prime_minister with backing from Ozawa ' s group and the Buddhist party . But lower house followers in his faction , the LDP ' s third largest , number only 46 . For their part , Socialist leaders had hinted that they would be willing to join a coalition with the Liberal Democrats , whose 38-year rule ended last summer , to counteract moves to pick Watanabe . Rank-and-file members , however , rebelled against the suggestion . Socialist , New Party Harbinger and Democratic Socialist leaders initiated a truce in their fight with the Hata-Ozawa Renewal Party and the Clean Government Party on Tuesday by dropping their insistence that all discussions to choose a leader be held among only top leaders of the eight parties . Instead , they agreed to allow party deputies to continue talks . The bid to end the deputies ' discussions was designed to push Ozawa , deputy leader of the Renewal Party , out of the decision-making process . The new moves did nothing to remove the distrust and enmity that have been building_in the coalition since January , when it achieved an assurance that political reforms would be enacted . Political reform and opposition to the Liberal Democrats were the only common goals that brought_together the entourage of leftist and conservative politicians last July . Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Masayoshi Takemura , head of the tiny New Party Harbinger , both repeated demands Tuesday that decision-making within the coalition must be &quot; democratized. &quot; Their meaning : Curtail Ozawa . Ozawa , the leader of last June ' s revolt against the Liberal Democrats , infuriated coalition members in February when he persuaded Hosokawa to announce a plan to increase a 3 % consumption tax to 7 % three years from now to finance an immediate three-year , 20 % income-tax cut . Without consulting the Socialists and leaving even members of his Cabinet in the dark , Hosokawa made the announcement at one of his frequent middle-of-the-night news_conferences . The next day , he was forced to rescind it . Without saying anything about the possibility of his selection , Hata surprised fellow politicians by leaving today to attend a meeting in Marrakech , Morocco , at which a world trade agreement is to be signed . Hata will meet with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and is expected to seek his agreement to resume U.S.-Japan &quot; framework &quot; talks . Hata is scheduled to return Sunday . Meantime , as the coalition moved toward unity , the Liberal Democrats turned toward chaos . An announcement by Yohei Kono , the party ' s president , that he will run_for prime_minister spurred a group of 10 younger Liberal Democrats to threaten to leave the party .</TEXT>
