   <TEXT> Given the recent death of teammate Ulrike Maier , killed in a Jan . 29 downhill crash , the Austrian women might be forgiven for their lackluster performances . American Julie Parisien , who has found it difficult to ski since the death of her brother more_than a year ago , said she understands . &quot; It ' s just been really tough on them , &quot; Parisien said . &quot; Every time they ' re in the start gate , I ' m sure they ' re thinking about Ulli . Every time I ' m in there I ' m thinking , ' Wow , did Ulli talk to these people before she went_down ? Did she click into her bindings the same way ? ' &quot; All this goes_through your head , because she was so close to all_of us. &quot;</TEXT>
