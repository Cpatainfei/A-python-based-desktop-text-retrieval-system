   <HEADLINE> MANDELA SCOLDS GUN-TOTING SUPPORTERS AT RALLY ; ELECTIONS : CANDIDATE SAYS ANC IS COMMITTED TO CONTROLLING FIREARMS IN SOUTH_AFRICA . MEANWHILE , PRESIDENT DE KLERK MAKES LAST-DITCH APPEAL FOR VOTES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was supposed to be a speech about sacrifice and struggle , about ending a long journey and starting another . Instead , Nelson Mandela was furious . At a campaign rally in South_Africa ' s largest black township Saturday , the gray-haired president of the African National Congress and all-but-certain next president of South_Africa was greeted with the rattle and roar of guns being fired into the bright_blue sky . The crowd of 60 # 000 cheered wildly as the impromptu salute of shots echoed for several minutes across the vast soccer stadium . But an open microphone caught Mandela complaining angrily to someone on the makeshift stage : &quot; I asked you to frisk everybody here . Nobody should come_in here with weapons ! &quot; Moments later , as the gunfire subsided , Mandela chastised his supporters . &quot; It is clear that criminality , even among members of the African National Congress , is deep-seated , &quot; he thundered . Saying that the ANC is committed to gun_control , he added : &quot; It is quite clear our organization has been penetrated by criminals . . . . If I find_out the people who are firing these guns , I have no alternative but to expel them from the organization . We do not want them ! &quot; Mandela has tried to rein_in his more militant supporters since his release from 27 years in prison in 1990 , as the constitutionally entrenched racism of apartheid began to crumble . Now , with his victory virtually assured when the country ' s black majority votes for the first time in three days of elections that start Tuesday , Mandela faces the heavier burden of governing a fractious society awash in assault_rifles and steeped in a culture of violence . The death throes of white minority rule have claimed more_than 13 # 000 lives in the last four years , largely in brutal clashes between rival members of the ANC and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi ' s Inkatha Freedom Party . Two ANC members distributing campaign literature were killed Saturday in Ulundi , the capital of KwaZulu , the Zulu homeland that Buthelezi controls . The men were reportedly shot and their bodies burned after an angry crowd surrounded a dozen ANC workers . The survivors took refuge in a police_station . KwaZulu and surrounding Natal province are under a state of emergency , and violence has fallen sharply since Buthelezi dropped a lengthy boycott and joined the race last week . He cut_short his campaigning and rushed back to the volatile capital after the killings . In Cape_Town , President Frederik W . de Klerk wrapped_up his long-shot campaign , making apologies for the past and promises for the future to a foot-stomping , singing and cheering crowd of mostly mixed-race Colored supporters . &quot; Yes , we made mistakes , &quot; De Klerk told 10 # 000 people packed into the Good Hope Center , an auditorium built_on the former site of District Six . That thriving multiracial community was destroyed by the all-white National Party government three decades ago because it was in a &quot; white area. &quot; Many of its residents were forced at gunpoint into crowded townships . &quot; But we have rectified our mistakes . And we have made this the best country in Africa under National Party rule , &quot; De Klerk said . &quot; We know how to build , and we will continue to build with your help. &quot; The supporters , bused in from Colored townships as far as 60 miles away , sported T-shirts , visors and buttons bearing De Klerk ' s likeness . About 1 # 000 people were turned_away from the packed auditorium . Inside , the president was interrupted again and again by enthusiastic applause and chants . De Klerk chose the Western Cape , one of nine new provinces , for his final rally because polls show it is the only province the National Party is likely to win . Colored voters are in the majority there , and many support De Klerk despite the injustices of apartheid . Many Colored voters fear they will suffer even more under a black-led government , perhaps losing the privileges they have had in jobs and housing . &quot; De Klerk is the only person who stands_for us , &quot; said Anthony Kleinbooi , 25 , from the Colored community of Belhar . &quot; Mandela stands only for his people . He ' s black , and he ' s for his people. &quot; De Klerk arrived holding the hand of his wife , Marike , in one of her rare public appearances in the area . The ANC has repeatedly reminded Colored voters of a remark she made several years ago that Coloreds , being neither black nor white , were non-persons . &quot; We ask a mandate in this election , and we promise you that never again will there be racial discrimination on one inch of the soil of South_Africa , &quot; De Klerk said . His speech was briefly disrupted by a white heckler , who scuffled with Colored supporters . But the president intervened , using the interruption to remind his listeners of the intimidation that he contends ANC supporters use . &quot; Please don ' t hurt the man , &quot; he said . &quot; We are a party of peace . Just lead him out of here . that ' s the way the National Party deals with people . We take them out quietly , but we don ' t kill them. &quot; The heckler was ushered from the hall without incident . De Klerk , running_for reelection to the office he won four years ago in whites-only elections , has no public appearances scheduled today , the last_day on which campaigning is allowed . Mandela will hold his final rally in Durban .</TEXT>
