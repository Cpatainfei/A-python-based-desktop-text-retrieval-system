   <HEADLINE> COUNTY WILL HOLD SUMMIT ON TOURISM ; LEISURE : SUPERVISORS SAY STRATEGY IS NEEDED TO COMBAT IMAGE PROBLEMS AND STEPPED-UP COMPETITION IN CRUCIAL INDUSTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Calling tourism &quot; the lifeblood &quot; of Orange County ' s economy , the Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to hold a summit geared toward crafting a marketing strategy that will lure more visitors and keep them here longer . The tourism summit is expected to convene sometime in the next 30 days at the Anaheim Convention Center and will feature more_than two_dozen representatives of the tourism industry across the county , said Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez , who came_up with the idea after meeting with tourist industry representatives last December . An estimated 38 million tourists visited the county in 1991 , the most recent year for which figures are available , and pumped $ 4.5 billion into the economy . But the recent spate of Southland disasters , combined with the recession and the lure of tourist meccas such_as Las Vegas and San Francisco , have contributed to a decline over the past few years , Vasquez said . &quot; There ' s no question that the uprisings , the earthquakes and other issues have not only had an immediate effect on certain groups canceling , but others are choosing other areas , &quot; Vasquez said . &quot; The underlying feeling is , ' We don ' t want to be here. ' We need to regain some of that tourist dollar and there was a feeling that we needed to develop a countywide effort for marketing in_order to do so. &quot; Vasquez said that in addition to the stigma of &quot; fires , earthquakes , mudslides and everything else , &quot; Orange County is simply being beat_out by other areas that have stepped_up efforts to draw a wide range of visitors . &quot; Los Angeles and San Diego have recently expanded their convention center and meeting facilities , and most significant of all perhaps is the retooling of Las Vegas , which is now going_after the family dollar , &quot; he said . Possible topics for the summit : how to accommodate more trade shows and how to tap the Latin_American tourist dollar , particularly travelers from Mexico who are increasingly visiting the region on business because of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , Vasquez said . Most of all , coordination will help visitors tap area resources with greater ease , he said . &quot; If you ' re a tourist in Orange County now , and you want tickets to the ( Orange County ) Performing Arts Center , tickets to Disneyland and tickets to the Pond , there isn ' t one number you can call to get them , &quot; Vasquez said . Packaging the county in a complete way may keep tourists here a day or two longer , he added . &quot; If we promote the Mission at San Juan Capistrano , if we promote the Richard Nixon Library , and that results in a tourist staying an extra day or two . . . well , you multiply that by 10 # 000 , and you have just increased your revenue significantly , &quot; he said . * Vasquez and Supervisor William G . Steiner recommended the summit , which will be co-hosted by Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly . &quot; It ' s not well-known that our performing and visual arts represent the 11th largest non-governmental employer in Orange County and $ 336 million a year in benefits , &quot; Steiner said . &quot; that ' s why I think we need a broader approach to marketing our county , rather than the traditional Disneyland and Knott ' s Berry Farm . There ' s more to it. &quot; Steiner added that there are 130 # 000 people employed in the Orange County tourism industry -- in restaurants , hotels and amusement_parks . &quot; that ' s a lot of people and a lot of jobs , and we need to nurture that , &quot; he said . Plans for the summit prompted widespread support Tuesday from industry leaders , some of whom planned the summit with Vasquez . &quot; Knott ' s is committed to participation at any level , &quot; said Knott ' s Berry Farm spokesman Bob Ochsner . &quot; Out-of-area tourism is somewhat down , and it has a lot to do with the earthquake in the short term . But I think it also has something to do_in the long_run with a lack of cooperation among all_the chambers , the bureaus and the various attractions. &quot; Patrick Hynes , spokesman for the Anaheim Hilton and Towers , said conventions have kept_up hotel business this year , but the number of leisure visitors are down . &quot; We have realized over the last several years that while our hotel is in Anaheim , near the Convention Center and just two blocks south of Disneyland , we are in Orange County and part of the appeal and the attraction should be that we are part of the fun and the sun of Southern California , &quot; Hynes said . Added Ken Moore , president of the Orange County Chamber_of_Commerce and Industry : &quot; To continue to assume that people will come without us making a coordinated effort is probably wrong . The objective of the summit is to be sure that people who come_to visit our attractions , like Disneyland or Knott ' s Berry Farm , know that there are other things they can do , whether it ' s going_to the beach or to the mountains , or to a ( Mighty ) Ducks game. &quot; * The summit is part of a larger realization in Orange County that in_order to compete for business as well as tourism , cities must come_together , he said . The chamber is now working_on a countywide economic development consortium and also expects to sign an agreement with the county in April for a film office that would promote Orange County to the television and film_industry , Moore said . When cities have pooled resources to market their goods , the effort pays_off , said Diane Baker , president of the Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors bureau . Last year , Baker won support from 16 cities and from Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder to publish a 32-page Orange County visitors guide . Now , about 5 # 000 a week are distributed through John Wayne Airport alone , she said . &quot; We have inquiries from Australia and all_over asking_for more guides , and then they ' re calling the individual cities who advertised for more information , &quot; she said . Baker is spearheading a new brochure , scheduled for publication within two months , that touts the attractions of six coastal communities , from Long_Beach to Dana Point . The summit is exactly the type of communication that will help individual cities attract more visitors and keep them in the region longer , Baker said . &quot; You have to look_at regions , not just cities , &quot; she said . &quot; The more communication you can get between the 31 cities in Orange County , the more opportunity you have for business . We need to focus_on how safe this area is , and all_the attractions , both the natural and all_the man-made attractions , because we really have both. &quot;</TEXT>
