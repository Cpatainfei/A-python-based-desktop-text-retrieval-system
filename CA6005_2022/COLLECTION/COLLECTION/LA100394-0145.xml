   <HEADLINE> AN INTIMATE LESSON ON AIDS ; LATINAS LEARN OF RISKS , PREVENTION IN CANDID , BACK-YARD GATHERINGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Amid the playful squeals of neighborhood children , a dozen women put aside their evening chores and carried kitchen chairs to the grass courtyard of their apartment complex to hear a neighbor talk_about AIDS , intimacy and their bodies . The women , Latinas of all ages , picked_up condoms displayed on a folding table , and some asked shyly how they are used . All of them listened intently while group leader Connie Rodriguez explained to them in Spanish how to examine their breasts for early signs of cancer . And some nodded quietly when she described relationships plagued by poor communication . The platica , or talk , was one of four open-air sessions last week in the Jeffrey-Lynne area of Anaheim to educate women about HIV and other health issues . Sponsored by the Delhi Community_Center in Santa Ana , the program also encourages women to speak openly with their children and husbands on such topics . &quot; We realize that to address HIV and AIDS in a vacuum without addressing the issues of power and sex negotiation will not work , &quot; said Irene Martinez , executive_director of the Delhi center . &quot; How do you bring_up the issue when in your culture , in your community , you never talk_about sex and sexuality ? &quot; Rodriguez , a 50-year-old homemaker who lives_in the Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood , organized the evening meetings . &quot; Some husbands don ' t let their wives go_out to the community_centers , &quot; she said . &quot; What I ' m trying to do is go_to their own back yard. &quot; Rodriguez is one of 17 female volunteers who graduated two weeks ago from a Delhi Community_Center program that aims to reach 1 # 000 Latinas across Orange County in the next year . The program , funded by a grant from the State Office of AIDS , is one of only a_few to target the Latino community , local health officials said . Getting the word out is vital . Of the 3 # 388 AIDS cases reported in Orange County through June this year , 207 of the patients were women . Of those , 58 were Latina , according to the Orange County Health_Care Agency . Those numbers reflect an alarming increase over the years . In 1989 , for example , 13 % of Orange County women afflicted with AIDS were Latina . That compares to more_than 28 % of the cases reported so far this year . &quot; We definitely need to continue programs for the Latino population in_general , &quot; said Ron Taylor , STD / HIV Services_program manager for the Orange County Health_Care Agency . &quot; Men and women show the increase. &quot; The Delhi program , he said , may be the only one working specifically with Latinas . Talks cover how a person contracts the virus that causes AIDS , how to prevent it and how to broach the subject with a partner , including how to say no to unsafe sex . They also offer information about mammograms , which detect breast_cancer , and Pap_smears , which can discover cervical cancer . &quot; I learned a lot of things about sexual_relations that I didn ' t know , &quot; said Yolanda Mendez , 28 , one of the platica participants . &quot; Before this class , I didn ' t know anything . I thought you could get AIDS by eating from the same spoon or from a kiss . But now I see that it ' s not so . Now I can go and tell my friends what I learned. &quot; Some of the hourlong sessions also touch_on another sensitive issue : domestic violence . &quot; Sometimes , the woman feels she has to have_sex because , if she doesn ' t , her husband might hit her or become very angry , &quot; said Leticia Leon , a Delhi Community_Center activist who coordinates the program . She spoke_to the neighborhood group at its final session last week . &quot; Many men are accustomed to hit their wives in front of strangers to show that he ' s macho , that he ' s in control , &quot; she told them . &quot; I don ' t know if any of you have experiences with these situations I have described , but they are very common. &quot; Rodriguez , who organized the talks equipped with little more_than a borrowed table , a binder full of Spanish-language medical pamphlets and the condoms used in her demonstrations , said any piece of information passed along might benefit another woman . Rodriguez admits that she knew little about AIDS or the other subjects she now teaches until she attended a women ' s rap_session held by activist Leon last year . What she heard that day so moved her , she said , that she joined 16 other women who signed_up for training and made the commitment to carry the message into their respective neighborhoods . The educadoras range_in age from 22 to 55 and include women from Mexico , Peru , Guatemala , El_Salvador and Brazil , Leon said . Rodriguez was the first to launch her programs , Leon said . Other women plan to hold workshops soon in elementary_schools in Santa Ana and Garden Grove , at a Santa Ana medical clinic , and in as_many Latino neighborhoods as they can reach . At Thursday ' s final Jeffrey-Lynne meeting , Leon handed_out certificates and bonus eyeliner to the women , who lingered to share tacos and sodas while they chatted about what they had learned . Some said their husbands hadn ' t been enthusiastic about the program . Participant Mendez , for example , said her husband wanted her to sit with him while he ate his dinner each night . But after she agreed to prepare his food early and explained to him that the information might be important for the health of both of them , he relented . &quot; It ' s a very delicate subject , &quot; Mendez said . The intimate setting of Rodriguez ' sessions provide the only frank advice some of the women have ever received about sexually transmitted diseases . The program &quot; helps us ask_for information , for counseling , &quot; said Margarita Mendez , 52 , who is pregnant with twins and also has 13 grandchildren . &quot; Now we know what to be careful of , how to guard against infection . &quot; Many times we don ' t know where to go_for advice , &quot; said Mendez , a native of Mexico . &quot; We come from a country far away , and we are alone . We don ' t know where to turn. &quot; Without Rodriguez , she said , &quot; we would n ' t have learned any of this. &quot;</TEXT>
