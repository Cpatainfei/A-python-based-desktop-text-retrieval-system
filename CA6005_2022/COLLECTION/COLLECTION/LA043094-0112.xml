   <HEADLINE> 7 ARRESTED IN TIJUANA POLICE_CHIEF ' S SLAYING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Police on Friday arrested seven suspects in the assassination of the city ' s reformist police_chief as investigators tried to determine whether his ambush was related to the murder last month of a presidential candidate or to escalating drug wars along the border . Police said Jose Federico Benitez Lopez , 42 , director of the Tijuana municipal police , and his bodyguard were cut_down by gunfire from two four-wheel-drive vehicles Thursday night along a busy Tijuana thoroughfare . Neither the identities of the seven suspects nor details of their arrests were immediately released . Baja California Gov . Ernesto Ruffo Appel said at a news_conference that the killing may be linked to the March 23 assassination of Mexico ' s leading presidential candidate , Luis Donaldo Colosio , or to a wave of drug-related shootouts on Tijuana ' s streets . &quot; It could be something having to do with drug trafficking . Perhaps the police operations had interfered with criminal activity , &quot; he said . &quot; It could be . . . that he ( Benitez ) had provided information on the Colosio case. &quot; Ruffo said Benitez had been giving periodic reports on the Colosio case both to the governor and to a special prosecutor handling the case for the federal_government . &quot; He was not exactly investigating , &quot; Ruffo said of the chief . &quot; He was simply expanding and specifying the information. &quot; In the final weeks of his life , Benitez was outspoken about the Colosio case and , unlike federal investigators , shared considerable information with the press that raised questions about the official account . In a recent interview with The Times , Benitez was dubious about the federal_government ' s handling of the Colosio case and expressed suspicion of a cover-up . Although the Colosio case is under investigation by federal authorities , Tijuana city police were involved in the initial arrests and investigation . A knowledgeable U.S. law_enforcement source said Benitez also had been preparing a report for a Mexican congressional commission on his force ' s role in the investigation of the assassination of Colosio , the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party . The assassination is widely viewed_as the product of a political conspiracy . Officials in the Tijuana city administration believe Benitez ' s slaying is connected to the Colosio case They say the killing could have been intended to silence the chief or to send a warning to authorities to back_off their investigation . &quot; He had fired a lot of cops , &quot; the U.S. source said , &quot; but ( Mexican authorities ) don ' t think anyone would kill him over that . They are looking_at the report on the Colosio case . They think he might have been shot to shut him up. &quot; In the wake of the slaying of Benitez and his bodyguard , Ramon Alarid Cardenas , 41 , security was intensified at City_Hall , and there was a report that bulletproof_vests have been requested for Mayor Hector Osuna Jaime and other officials . Alarid was an 18-year veteran of the Tijuana department . Ruffo , Osuna and state Atty . Gen . Pedro Raul Vidal Rosas were surrounded by heavy security during the news_conference , and a task_force of 150 officers has been assigned to investigate the killing . Of the violence that has plagued Tijuana recently , Ruffo said : &quot; I can only say that we have committed ourselves to eradicating crime . . . . I would tend to attribute these incidents to the fact that police are becoming more effective. &quot; Benitez was hit in the arm , neck and head by a gunman or gunmen who drove alongside his official vehicle . Benitez and his aide were driving along Via Rapida Poniente after investigating a bomb hoax at Tijuana International Airport , authorities said . The chief was struck with rounds from a shotgun and an AK-47 assault_rifle , police said . He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital within an hour . The blood-spattered pickup_truck in which Benitez and his bodyguard were slain was_on display Friday at the Baja California State Judicial Police_Headquarters . In addition to arresting the seven suspects , police said they found three vehicles that may be connected to the incident . A city police report that Benitez had released to the news media increased suspicion that a second gunman may have been involved in Colosio ' s death . According to the report , federal_officials in Colosio ' s entourage had contacted city police the night Colosio was slain to say the murder weapon had just been recovered and to request an escort to federal police_headquarters . That presents a possible contradiction of official accounts that Mario Aburto Martinez had identified another gun as the murder weapon during an interrogation just hours after the killing . The federal_government insists that Aburto was the sole gunman in a conspiracy involving three accomplices . During the frenzy after Colosio was shot , officers of Grupo Tactico -- the municipal SWAT team -- were involved in a tense confrontation with federal officers hustling Aburto from the scene . People in the crowd appealed_to the SWAT officers for help , saying they feared that Aburto would be killed or would disappear , according to a report provided by Benitez . The city officers stopped the federal vehicle at gunpoint , and after a heated dispute , escorted the prisoner and his captors to federal police_headquarters . Also , officers of Grupo Tactico arrested another suspect , an agent of the Mexican Interior Ministry , as he ran from the site of the campaign rally wearing a bloodstained shirt . The agent ' s hands tested positive for gunpowder residue . And although he has been released pending further investigation , his possible involvement has been cited by the Baja California governor , who asserted that the issue of whether there was a second gunman has not been resolved . Moreover , Benitez expressed doubt during an interview about the authenticity of a political diary allegedly written by Aburto and of statements to police investigators attributed to a girlfriend of the accused assassin . Benitez said the release of that and other information appeared intended to paint a misleading picture of the case . . Before entering police work , Benitez had been a manager of accounting at a fruit-juice plant for 18 years . He joined the state_government in 1991 as a lawyer handling matters of juvenile_delinquency and transportation . Benitez was appointed in late 1992 as the city ' s first &quot; citizen police_chief &quot; by Mayor Osuna of the opposition party that rules Baja California , the National Action Party ( PAN ) . With his appointment came a mandate to clean_up the police_department . Benitez had instituted the department ' s first internal affairs unit to investigate widespread allegations of bribery and brutality . He led a corruption purge that resulted in the firing of about 400 of the department ' s 1 # 800 officers , and the Mexican press speculated Friday that his murder was in retaliation for the dismissals . He created an anti-drug program for Tijuana schools similar to the DARE program in the United States , and he was trying to expand and improve the police_academy . He reacted to the problem of violent crime in Tijuana by involving neighborhood residents in community policing . &quot; I found him very ethical , professional and personable , &quot; said San Diego Police_Chief Jerry Sanders , who had met with Benitez a dozen times to discuss law_enforcement issues . Benitez ' s funeral is scheduled for noon today at the Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Tijuana . The Mass will be followed by a 2 p.m. ceremony outside Tijuana City_Hall . Burial is to be in the municipal cemetery in Tecate , Benitez ' s hometown . He is survived by a wife and three children . Times staff writer Tony Perry in San Diego contributed to this story . Rotella and Kraul reported from Tijuana .</TEXT>
