   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / SUSAN CARPENTER MCMILLAN : ULTRA-LIBERALS FIGHT MORALITY IN THE SCHOOLS ; HEMET PROGRAM IS A LOGICAL ANSWER TO PREGNANCY AND STDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With teen-age pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases skyrocketing , the sex-education program adopted by the Hemet School District should become a prototype for every school district in Southern California . The Hemet program , which promotes abstinence , begins by placing the primary responsibility for teaching children about sex on parents and the secondary role on schools . The Hemet school_board researched three established and recognized abstinence programs from across the country and combined their findings into one . The program teaches self-discipline , a sense_of_responsibility , self-control and a sound reasoning process . It also gives teens skills on how to say no , along with instructing them that they must never use verbal or physical harassment to intimidate . The study guide emphasizes &quot; that jokes , slurs and derogatory statements made on the basis of sex , sexual orientation , disability , race , color , creed , religion or culture are demeaning and destroy the dignity of the affected individual. &quot; Condoms are not displayed until the 11th grade ; no form of contraception is distributed by the school . Finally , all sex-education programs are age-appropriate . Who , you ask , would ever be against this kind of balanced , informative program that gives our kids the only foolproof method to prevent AIDS and other STDs ? Five sets of parents , backed by none other_than the mother of promiscuity , Planned Parenthood , and its ultra-liberal sidekick , the American Civil Liberties Union . They have sued the Hemet School District and all five board_members to stop the program . Seems like teaching morality in today ' s climate of immorality truly brings_out those who would live and thrive on putting our children ' s health and self-esteem at risk . For the past two decades , these anti-moral parasites have fostered attitudes in our schools that brought us Lakewood ' s infamous &quot; Spur Posse , &quot; where 15-year-old boys boasted of having_sex with girls as young as 10 as part of a competition . One &quot; Spur &quot; mother reported stocking her 14-year-old son ' s room with condoms , while a father proudly called his son &quot; all man. &quot; These twisted attitudes instill in the minds of today ' s teen-agers that , like animals , they simply cannot control themselves . Psychiatrist Richard Bloom has attributed the 200 % rise in teen-age suicide to the free sexual lifestyle practiced by today ' s teens . Roughly 20 % of the teen-agers in a University of Michigan study were infected with chlamydia , and nationwide , 3 million teens a year become infected with STDs ranging from AIDS to syphilis . After billions of tax dollars spent on sex-education programs , 58 % of young_girls still refuse to use contraception during their first act of sexual_intercourse . This insanity -- which turns educators into advocates by allowing them to pass_out condoms and portrays those who dare to suggest boundaries and standards as right-wing religious zealots -- must stop . There is no cure for AIDS ; if a young_person becomes infected , he or she will die . Yet the pro-sex evangelists refuse to tell children that so-called safe-sex condoms have a failure rate of 26 % in preventing AIDS and 16 % in preventing pregnancy . As responsible educators , the Hemet school_board looked_at these disturbing statistics and decided to institute an abstinence-based program . Now the board is being sued for teaching children common-sense values and self-preservation . Bonnie Park , who teaches &quot; sex respect &quot; at Hemet Middle_School , says the program centers_on &quot; the idea that human_beings really can control their behavior , including sexual behavior. &quot; Students support her . As the mother of a 16-year-old , I challenge Planned Parenthood to give me one negative aspect of teaching our children to wait . Where is the flaw in teaching kids how to say no ? Finally , can Planned Parenthood name one child who ever died from abstinence ? Yet , in an apparently concerted effort , small groups of parents from around the country , apparently fronting for those who profit from teen-age promiscuity , are suing school_systems that dare to teach abstinence . In a recent survey at Grand Memorial Hospital in Atlanta , 82 % of the 1 # 043 adolescents questioned said they wanted help in how to say no . Louis Harris ' recent poll found that 87 % of teens did not want sexual services such_as birth_control and abortion referral at their schools . Yet the do-badders plow on . Could it be that these middle-aged proponents of the free-love , anything-goes ' 60s are threatened by the morals their offspring are being given -- the same ones they rejected ? The Hemet school_board should be supported and imitated , not sued and harassed .</TEXT>
