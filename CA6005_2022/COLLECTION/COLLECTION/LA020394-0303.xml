   <HEADLINE> PANEL TO STUDY CLOSING SOME OF NATIONAL LABS ; RESEARCH : ENERGY_SECRETARY O ' LEARY APPEARS TO TAKE_AIM AT ' BIG THREE ' IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA . ALL NINE FACILITIES EMPLOY 19 # 000 SCIENTISTS , ENGINEERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary on Wednesday established a task_force headed by a leading industrialist to study the nation ' s nine national laboratories , with an eye toward the possibility of closing some of them . &quot; With the end of the Cold_War and growing concerns about global economic competition , now is the time to plan how the department ' s laboratories can best help meet the energy , environmental , economic , scientific and defense needs of the future , &quot; O ' Leary said at a press_conference . The energy_secretary , who has shaken_up her department ' s nuclear_weapons bureaucracy by calling_for investigations of radiation experiments , appeared to take special aim at the &quot; big three &quot; labs traditionally engaged in nuclear_weapons research -- all_of which are important to California . Lawrence Livermore Laboratory is based in Livermore . The Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico is administered by the University of California . And Sandia National Labs operate from Livermore and Albuquerque . The University of California system also administers a fourth national lab , the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley . O ' Leary charged the task_force with the responsibility of assessing whether the labs needlessly duplicate each other ' s efforts . While saying that she is not certain that closing any of the labs is necessary , she said that the issue &quot; is certainly one that ( task_force members ) should be examining and making recommendations about. &quot; She selected Motorola chief_executive Robert W . Galvin to lead the effort . The nine national labs are owned by the department , which contracts with private concerns to run them . While the three major labs concentrate primarily on nuclear research , the network also does other energy and environmental research . With annual budgets of more_than $ 6 billion and employment rolls of more_than 19 # 000 scientists and engineers , the facilities are a potent force both in the nation ' s economy and in the communities they occupy . O ' Leary ' s comments Wednesday mark the first time since the establishment of the Energy_Department in 1977 that its secretary has spoken publicly about the possibility of shrinking the network of laboratories . The move comes at a time when many of the labs , especially those that have specialized in nuclear_weapons design , have been reshaping their staffs and their research agendas to reflect the declining importance of the Energy_Department ' s military research . For instance , all three of the labs engaged primarily in bomb design recently signed_on to multimillion-dollar research programs in which they will cooperate with the nation ' s domestic auto_makers in an effort to develop safer cars that meet higher emission standards . Cooperative programs between the national labs and private industry are gaining new interest both from manufacturers and the Clinton_Administration , which has been more active than its predecessors in_using the powers of the federal_government to meet the needs of American industry . Other labs under examination are the Argonne National Lab in Argonne , Ill. ; the Brookhaven National Lab in Upton , N.Y. ; the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho Falls , Ida. ; Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge , Tenn. , and the Pacific Northwest Laboratory in Richland , Wash .</TEXT>
