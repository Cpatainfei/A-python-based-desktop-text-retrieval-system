   <HEADLINE> INEFFECTIVE BUS-LIGHTS LAW WILL GIVE US FALSE SENSE OF TRAFFIC SAFETY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * I am writing in response to your editorial ( &quot; Weak but Needed Safety Step , &quot; Sept . 3 ) in which you supported the bill passed_by the state Legislature regarding the use of flashing lights on school_buses . Although I agree that the bill is weak , I must take_issue with your assessment that it is a first_step toward the ultimate goal of requiring the use of the flashing lights whenever the bus_stops to load and unload passengers . The existing law requires the use of the flashing lights only when children must cross the street to get_to and from their assigned stop , and prohibits the use of the flashing lights in any other circumstance . The new legislation would only allow school districts to obtain permission to flash the lights at stops which &quot; present a unique traffic hazard. &quot; This immediately eliminates most stops . This means that if a school district wanted to designate such a stop , it would be required to prove that it met the &quot; unique &quot; status which the law has defined . It is doubtful that the school districts would be willing to jump through the necessary hoops to accomplish this for more_than a handful of stops if any at all . The argument for using the lights at all stops is simple . Children as young as 4 years old ride the bus . To assume that a child of this age will behave in a predictable manner is courting disaster . We must start with the assumption that children this young will do the unpredictable . Any vehicle passing a stopped bus from the rear would be unable to see a child entering the roadway from in front of the bus . The child ' s view would likewise be obstructed . This creates a condition where chance accidents are guaranteed to occur . The problem with the new legislation is in the randomness of these incidents . Since the danger presented by the lack of visibility is inherent in all stops , we cannot predict at which stop the next accident will happen . This means there would be only an insignificant reduction in the odds of an accident occurring . This is unacceptable . This issue is a matter of life and death and we cannot afford to settle for ineffective legislation which says something but in reality does nothing . The passage of this bill will allow those opposed to using the lights to falsely claim that action has already been taken . I believe that in the long_run this will make_it more difficult to get truly effective legislation enacted . For this reason , I have asked Gov . Wilson to take a stand on this issue and veto the bill in its present form and send it back to the Legislature . In my view it not only doesn ' t do enough , it does nothing at all .
