   <HEADLINE> RSVP ; ORNETTE COLEMAN ISN ' T A PIECE OF CAMPING GEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Scene : Monday ' s industry screening of Showtime ' s &quot; Lush Life &quot; at the Directors Guild . The film about the lives of jazz_musicians airs May 20 . A party followed at the Roxbury club ' s top floor . * Who Was There : From the film came co-star Kathy Baker ( Jeff Goldblum and Forrest Whitaker were off filming ) . Also on_hand were 400 agents and production execs . * Regarding the Locale : One club-goer took_a_look around Roxbury and remarked : &quot; Gee , it ' s nice to be here and not be tripping over Shannen Doherty. &quot; * Best Self-Deprecating Remark by a Film Exec : Showtime ' s Steve Hewitt described his first meeting with &quot; Lush Life &quot; writer-director Michael Elias about making the movie : &quot; Michael looked_at me like he was thinking , ' Here ' s this kid executive who probably thinks Ornette Coleman has something to do with camping equipment. ' &quot; * Regarding Showtime : Long the Avis to HBO ' s Hertz in the cable-TV world , Hewitt described their relative positions as : &quot; We ' re the scrappy kid on the block . They ' re into Little_League , we play stick ball in the street . It gives us more freedom -- we don ' t need to have uniforms. &quot; * Yes , This Must Be L.A. : It was an eight-block walk from the theater to Roxbury . There was about as much chance as the National_Anthem being switched to a jazz tune as there was of anyone heading for the party on foot . * Entertainment : An excellent jazz_band with Chuck Findley , Mike Lang , Dave Carpenter , Gene Estes , Vince Trombetta , Charlie Loper and Ernie Andrews playing . This might have been the first time a grand_piano has somehow been hauled to Roxbury ' s top floor . There was probably more good music played_at Roxbury on this one night than in its entire history . * Quoted : While introducing the film , executive producer Jana Sue Memel said : &quot; To all_the filmmakers out there , I ' d like to say , there ' s no better place to make a movie than Showtime . Which is the speech I ' d like to give this year at the Oscars. &quot; * Observed : As part of an abstract_art exhibit , there was a pair of eerie , headless , seated figures in the DGA lobby . Whether they signify the ill effects of screenings , or what happens to over-budget directors , the DGA would be better_off with a popcorn machine .</TEXT>
