   <HEADLINE> COMING TO A FORK IN THE RIVER ; MIDDLE FORK OF SAN JOAQUIN ISN ' T FAR FROM CIVILIZATION , BUT IT IS A HOT SPOT FOR TROUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For David Moss , there is nothing like standing in the middle of a cool-running river , surrounded by grassy meadows and an evergreen forest . But then Moss used to work in the garment district of downtown Los Angeles . Standing_in the middle of a mud_puddle would be fine with him , as long as it ' s a mud_puddle up here . &quot; I still have to go_to Los Angeles on family_business sometimes , &quot; Moss says . &quot; But that ' s fine , as long as I know I get_to come home. &quot; Moss , 57 , now owns a car rental company in town , but most days he can be found waist-deep in water somewhere on the outskirts , trying to get a rise out of a trout . If he does , chances are the trout will soon be at the end of Moss ' line . Moss is also one of Mammoth Lakes ' top fly-fishing guides . And for a price -- he works_out of Kittredge Sports and charges $ 100 for four hours or $ 150 for a full day -- he will introduce you to the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River , one of the best-kept secrets in town . &quot; People hear San Joaquin and they think you ' re talking_about the Delta , &quot; says Dick Gaumer , a La Crescenta-based marketing consultant who works for the city of Mammoth Lakes . Moss knows better . The Middle Fork of the San Joaquin , with headwaters in the back_country above town at Thousand Island Lake , runs just west of Mammoth Mountain through some of the most beautiful country in the state , before meeting_up_with the main river of Delta fame . Wildflowers and cottonwoods provide a brilliant display of color each fall . Deer graze in the meadows , and bears sometimes wander the river ' s banks . &quot; I may be prejudiced , but I think this is prettier than Yosemite , &quot; Moss says . He isn ' t alone . Paul Payne , 38 , a local hotel owner and avid fisherman , describes a trip to the San Joaquin as &quot; a Yosemite-like experience without the crowds. &quot; Both Moss and Payne are quick to point_out , however , that what makes the San Joaquin unique is that it is the only place within a stone ' s throw from town -- it ' s accessible 10 minutes down the road from the U.S. Forest Service gate at the end of the ski area parking_lot -- where an angler has an opportunity to accomplish a grand_slam of sorts , catching four species of trout -- rainbow , brown , brook and golden -- in a day . Most of the goldens are actually a hybrid , the result of mixed breeding with stocked rainbows , which are planted every_other week at some of the campgrounds . But there are some pure goldens , differentiated by their brighter gold coloring , swimming the upper reaches of the river as well . &quot; Or you can try_for the super grand_slam , &quot; Moss says , referring to stocked and wild rainbows , browns , brookies and both types of goldens . Such a feat is difficult , but far from impossible . The wild trout in the San Joaquin are simply wild about flies , or lures and bait for that matter . &quot; The San Joaquin is a classic dry-fly stream , &quot; says Moss , who fishes the river about 35 days each season . &quot; Particularly if you get_away from the campgrounds ( where the hatchery fish are stocked and tend to hold ) . But if they aren ' t farmed_out ( before the next plant ) , even a stocked fish will rise to a dry_fly here. &quot; So unique is the fishery that it has become a candidate for Wild Trout Stream status , a state listing that , if approved by the Fish and Game Commission , will mandate the Department of Fish and Game to take a more active role in protecting the wild trout in the river . Restricting vehicle access helps keep the pressure down . The U.S. Forest Service allows cars through the gate only before 7:30 a.m. and after 5:30 p.m. And Steve Parmenter , a fishery biologist with the DFG , says a big step toward protecting wild trout populations was taken 25 years ago when the DFG stopped planting hatchery-raised fish in the_Devil ' s Postpile and Soda Springs areas , leaving large stretches of river inhabited almost solely by wild trout . So for now , the fishery seems to be in fine shape . &quot; Now in one riffle you may catch a brown , a brook , a ( wild ) rainbow and something resembling a golden , and there might even be some genuine goldens in that riffle as well , &quot; Parmenter says . &quot; In that little valley you have that whole spectrum of fish. &quot; None of the fish are particularly big -- a 20-inch brown is considered a prize catch -- but they are_full of spirit . And they are apparently as plentiful as the mosquitoes that torment those who dare venture into the valley without dousing themselves with repellent . &quot; It ' s not uncommon for us to go_down there and in a period of a_few hours catch hundreds of fish , &quot; Payne says . * One recent balmy afternoon , Moss set_out to prove how productive the San Joaquin really is . He parked near Pumice Flats Campground and was soon ready in waders and boots . Stan Elmore , a volunteer caretaker at the campground , stopped by and said he had to chase a bear_away the night before . Moss smiled and took_off along the river bank , watching the water along the way . He stopped about a_hundred yards from the camp and carefully stepped_in . Soon he had the fly working beautifully through the air , landing it in a shaded pool and drifting back through the ripples . After a_few casts , a fish rose to the fly . On the next cast , it struck . Moss set the hook , and the fish went skittering across the narrow river . Moss soon landed the fish , a brown_trout about six inches long . He carefully unhooked the fish and it disappeared in a flash . Working his way down the river , casting perfectly to pools beneath the overhanging brush , he landed a larger brown , then caught a brook_trout about eight inches long . Shadows from the pines were forming over the meadow behind the fisherman . There was nobody else in_sight . About an hour passed , and Moss , after catching and releasing several more brown_trout and a_few more brook_trout , landed a golden trout that was more yellow than gold , with a red streak running_down its side . With time running_out , Moss decided to go_back to the campground . He waded into the water , mosquitoes buzzing around his head , and after about a dozen casts he hooked_up again . The fish , a planted rainbow about 12 inches long , put_up a decent fight , but Moss successfully brought it in , completing the grand_slam . He smiled as though he has never done this before . &quot; So what if some of the fish are only three or four inches long , &quot; he says . &quot; The idea is to fool the fish , any fish. &quot; And there seem to be plenty of fools in the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin .</TEXT>
