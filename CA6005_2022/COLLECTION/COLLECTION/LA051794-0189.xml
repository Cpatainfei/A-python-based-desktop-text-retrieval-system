   <HEADLINE> INSIDER ; TUSSLE OVER CHINA TRADE BENEFITS NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL THIS YEAR ; * BOTH SIDES IN DEBATE OVER LINKING COMMERCE WITH HUMAN_RIGHTS PUSH FOR END TO STALEMATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The wrangling has gone_on for nearly five years and now it is showdown time for the American policy on trade with China . As in every spring since 1990 , business_executives are converging on Washington to ask the President to preserve China ' s trade privileges in this country . Human_rights activists , deploring Chinese repression , are calling_for limits on Beijing ' s trade benefits . Some Chinese dissidents are likewise seeking sanctions against China . Emissaries from Hong Kong are pleading that its dependence on trade with China should not be forgotten . Yet this is not just another year . The decisions over the next few weeks by the Clinton_Administration and Congress about whether to continue China ' s most-favored-nation ( MFN ) status as a U.S. trading partner will have more lasting impact than in any previous year . Forces on both sides of the debate are now pushing to end the five-year stalemate . The American business_community is appealing_to the Administration to once and for all &quot; de-link &quot; -- that is , to stop making trade with China conditional upon human_rights improvements . &quot; The time has come_to do what we ought to do , to renew ( China ' s trade benefits ) permanently , &quot; argued Sen . Max Baucus ( D-Mont. ) . Human_rights groups and organized labor , by contrast , want the Administration to break_with precedent and raise the duties on at least some Chinese goods sold in the United States . &quot; I think partial revocation ( of China ' s trade benefits ) is in the cards , &quot; Jeff Fiedler of the AFL-CIO ' s Food and Allied Services Trades said . China says that any such action would deal a serious long-term blow to relations with the United States . These two approaches are not mutually_exclusive . In fact , the Administration is studying both . Some officials have hinted that , in an effort to forge a compromise , the Administration could impose at least a_few sanctions on some Chinese goods over the coming year and at_the_same_time remove many or all_of the conditions for renewal of China ' s trade privileges in future years . The Administration ' s decision will stand unless Congress overrides it . &quot; The debate will be about whether we are going_to de-link without taking some partial step &quot; on sanctions , said one Administration official recently . &quot; Because if the Chinese haven ' t made the sort of progress ( on human_rights ) we ' re looking_for , then we lose credibility , including with the Chinese. &quot; The stakes in the China dispute are enormous . A coalition of U.S. business groups claims that cutting_off China ' s trade benefits would threaten $ 9 billion in American exports to China and as_many as 171 # 000 jobs here . Labor_leaders counter that such jobs estimates are vastly inflated and that China , with $ 30 billion in exports to the United States last year , has much more to lose in a trade cutoff . More broadly , the outcome of the trade dispute could well determine whether the United States seeks to use its trade leverage to try to ease political repression elsewhere in the world . Mike Jendrzejczyk , Washington director of Human_Rights Watch ( Asia ) , said he worries that a decision to extend trade privileges to China would weaken U.S. human_rights policy toward other nations in Asia , such_as Indonesia . That viewpoint is shared by many Chinese dissidents . &quot; International pressure is very important , &quot; said Wang Juntao , one of the architects of China ' s 1989 democracy demonstrations , who visited Washington last week . Wang , who was just released after serving nearly five years in a Chinese prison , reported that &quot; every year , my prison conditions improved when there was an MFN debate in this country . And after the MFN decision was made , my prison conditions would backslide. &quot; * Several factors have combined to bring the controversy on China ' s trade status to a climax this spring : * Under the Clinton_Administration , for the first time , it is official U.S. policy to require China to improve its rights policies if it wants its trade benefits renewed . * American businesses are more threatened than in past years by restrictions on trade because China ' s economy grew by a startling 13 % last year . The Chinese government has fueled the competitive anxieties of U.S. businesses by hosting large business delegations from Germany and other European_countries . * To an unprecedented degree , China has defied the United States on human_rights . Cases_in_point : its roundups of dissidents and its icy treatment of Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher in Beijing in March . China has enjoyed most-favored trade status since 1980 , the year after the United States formally granted diplomatic recognition to the Communist regime in Beijing . These benefits mean that Chinese goods sold in this country carry the same low tariffs enjoyed by most other nations . Only a handful of countries , such_as North_Korea , are denied most-favored status . Countries without it must export goods to this country under Depression-era tariffs that are prohibitively high . Throughout the 1980s , China ' s benefits were extended annually and without controversy . Then in 1989 came the bloody crackdown by Chinese troops on young demonstrators around Tian An Men Square . The toll was at least 1 # 000 lives . Afterward , congressional Democrats sought to demand improvements in China ' s human_rights , trade and arms control policies in return for renewal of China ' s trade benefits . President George_Bush repeatedly vetoed such legislation . During the 1992 presidential election campaign , Clinton accused Bush of &quot; coddling dictators &quot; and said that he favored attaching conditions to the trade benefits . After taking_office , Clinton gave China one more year of most-favored privileges . He also adopted an executive order setting conditions China would have to meet if it wanted the benefits again in 1994 . For example , the Beijing regime was asked to make &quot; overall significant progress &quot; in releasing political_prisoners , in its conduct toward Tibet and in its handling of Voice of America broadcasts into China , which have been routinely jammed . Over the last year , as China ' s economy boomed and the Chinese leadership balked at meeting the American human_rights conditions , the U.S. business_community grew increasingly nervous . Likewise , officials in Clinton ' s National Economic Council and the Commerce and Treasury_departments made_it plain that they were worried about the impact of a cutoff of most-favored status on American companies . Some leading congressional Democrats served notice that they wanted the President to change_course . &quot; I supported the President ' s executive order last year on MFN , in part because I believed it would facilitate a more stable relationship with China while preserving broad congressional backing , &quot; said Rep . Lee H . Hamilton ( D-Ind. ) , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee . However , Hamilton said , &quot; whatever leverage MFN conditionality has provided in the past year , its application in this next phase would probably be counterproductive . It is time to de-link. &quot; * In fact , Administration officials face several decisions over the next few weeks . They must first decide whether to tell the American people that China has made the progress on human_rights described by Clinton ' s 1993 order . In fact , the Administration has launched a secret , intensive diplomatic campaign to get China to make more concessions on human_rights , U.S. officials say . While Administration officials refuse to acknowledge it , they have reportedly dispatched a special emissary to take_charge of these last-minute negotiations . The secret talks seem to have produced at least one result : Over the weekend , China released a prominent dissident who had been jailed as one of the principal organizers of the 1989 Tian An Men Square demonstrations . If the Administration finds insufficient progress in China , it will have to decide whether to revoke trade benefits , impose partial sanctions or take no action at all . Partial sanctions could involve raising duties by a small amount on all Chinese goods or raising them substantially on some kinds of goods -- for example , anything made by China ' s state-owned enterprises or by the People ' s Liberation Army . Clinton must also decide the terms of renewing China ' s trade benefits next year and in the following years . Finally , Clinton will have to win support in Congress for his policy toward China . And that may_not be easy . &quot; There has been 25 % turnover in the House since the last election , &quot; observed Hamilton . &quot; The new members of Congress do not accept , as a given , the importance of U.S.-China relations . They are quick to see the irritants in the relationship. &quot; China Imports From U.S. ( in millions of U.S. dollars ) 1983 : 2 # 753 1984 : 3 # 837 1985 : 5 # 199 1986 : 4 # 718 1987 : 4 # 836 1988 : 6 # 633 1989 : 7 # 864 1990 : 6 # 591 1991 : 8 # 003 1992 : 8 # 895 China Exports to U.S. ( in millions of U.S. dollars ) 1983 : 1 # 713 1984 : 2 # 313 1985 : 2 # 336 1986 : 2 # 633 1987 : 3 # 030 1988 : 3 # 399 1989 : 4 # 414 1990 : 5 # 314 1991 : 6 # 192 1992 : 8 # 590 Source : Direction of Trade Statistics Yearbooks 1989 and 1992 ; and Quarterly Reports for September and December , 1993 ; March 1994 .
