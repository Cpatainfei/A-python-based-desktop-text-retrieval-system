   <HEADLINE> GERMAN JOBLESS RATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Re your article on unemployment in Germany , March 9 : It starts by stating that German unemployment figures are &quot; climbing toward the jobless levels that helped bring Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler to power in 1933. &quot; First of all , this statement is incorrect . Today ' s economic situation in Germany , including unemployment , is totally different from that of the early ' 30s.In February , 1932 , unemployment figures reached their climax of 6.128 million , corresponding to 44 % of the total German labor_force at that time . Since February , 1929 , unemployment had doubled . On the other hand , state subsidies for the unemployed constantly declined during the same period , finally falling below the minimum living_wage . German economic output in 1932 was almost 50 % lower than in 1928 . Today , the jobless rate of 10.5 % is not only four times lower than in 1932 , but fits into a completely different picture . The statement in_question also contains an undertone suggesting that Germany might somehow be again at the brink of a new Nazi dictatorship . This , I think , is unfair , considering the actual situation in Germany . Certainly historic knowledge and awareness as well as comparisons to the past are necessary and useful . But sincere journalism should not revive specters and myths which have no relevance to the political reality and tend to nurture or raise prejudices and fears that are by no means justified . Rather than repeat them we should dissolve them by means of sober analysis , just as your reporter ' s further explanations tend to dissolve her opening statement .
