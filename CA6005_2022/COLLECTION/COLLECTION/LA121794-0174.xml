   <HEADLINE> RELIGION / JOHN DART ; STUDY COUNTS FEWER PRACTICING MUSLIMS ; ISLAM : ADHERENTS IN NORTH_AMERICA TOTAL ABOUT 500 # 000 , A SURVEY FINDS . BUT IT REMAINS A FAST-GROWING RELIGION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first scientific survey of mosques has found that organized Islam in the United States and Canada , although growing rapidly , is no larger than a small Christian denomination of about 500 # 000 adherents , a finding which may sharply lower many previous estimates of the total Muslim population . The study nevertheless indicated that Islam may be , as reputed , one of the continent ' s fastest growing religions , which at the current rate_of_growth would overtake Judaism early in the next century as the second-largest religious group after Christianity . Nearly 80 % of the 1 # 046 Muslim congregations , mostly in the United States , were formed in the past 25 years , according to the survey directed by the Islamic Resource Institute of Fountain Valley . Religious scholars praised the survey as a long-sought starting_point for establishing a factual profile of Islam in the United States and Canada , with its mix of mostly Indo-Pakistani and Arab immigrants and African American converts . A summary of the still-unpublished survey is included in a new Muslim resource guide for the news media , of which The Times obtained an advance copy . &quot; It ' s the first solid research in this area , &quot; said sociologist Wade Clark Roof of UC Santa Barbara , who helped construct the poll . Roof is president-elect of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion . The survey results should reduce some estimates of the overall American Muslim population , said Ihsan Bagby , who completed the study this year before taking a faculty position in international studies with Shaw University at Raleigh , N.C. Some previous estimates by scholars and religious_leaders have placed the number of Muslims in the United States and Canada at 6 million to 8 million . But because Islamic scholars commonly contend that only 10 % of American and Canadian Muslims attend mosques , the new study ' s count of about 500 # 000 mosque-goers indicates a total population of 4.6 million to 5 million , Bagby said . Conversely , that is_well above the 2 million or less estimated by separate national surveys in 1991 by the Gallup Poll and the City_University of New York . Islamic leaders disagreed_with those findings as too low , saying that new immigrants and black converts are often missed by conventional polling . By comparison , other studies show there are about 6 million Jews in the United States and Canada . That is only about 20 % more_than Bagby ' s estimate of the Muslim population , even though the number of Muslims was negligible until the 1960s , while Jews have been established in large_numbers on the continent for more_than a century . To arrive_at the figure of nearly 500 # 000 Muslims who attend mosques , the survey ' s researchers asked each Islamic center how many people take_part in activities other_than Islam ' s two major feast_days -- one marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan and another that celebrates the time of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca . Bagby said that the average number of such active participants per congregation was 465 people , which he multiplied by the 1 # 046 known mosques -- or masjids , an Arabic term for &quot; house_of_prayer &quot; that Muslims prefer . Bagby attributed the rapid_growth of Islamic centers to a combination of immigration , conversions and births . &quot; Based on immigration and conversion ( rates ) alone , &quot; he said , &quot; it is safe to say that the Muslim population is growing a minimum of 125 # 000 a year. &quot; At that rate , the Muslim population would surpass the number of Jews in the United States and Canada by 2010 , he said . Whether many of those people will associate with local Islamic centers is an open question . &quot; The notion of masjid membership is not strong among Muslims , &quot; Bagby conceded . The survey showed that the actual number of &quot; mosqued &quot; Muslims -- those who have taken_part in Islamic center prayer activities more_than twice a year -- may be compared at best to the U . S . memberships of small Christian bodies such_as the Church of the Nazarene , the nationwide Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod and the Orthodox Church in America , an Eastern Orthodox denomination . Without a tally based on actual mosque attendance , however , it has been difficult to gauge the true numbers of American Muslims . &quot; I ' ve always urged people not to exaggerate numbers of Muslims , &quot; said Salam Al-Marayati , director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles . &quot; It adds more to people ' s apprehensions than to people ' s understanding. &quot; Many Muslims attend no mosque , in part , because in Middle Eastern , African and Asian_nations -- where it is often the dominant religion -- Islam is not organized into the local church congregations common in North_America . Moslem immigrants are thus unaccustomed to establishing such affiliations , Islamic leaders say . Bagby said that the study was conducted from mid-1992 to last March through telephone_interviews with representatives of 341 mosques . &quot; Only a handful , fewer than 10 , refused to participate , &quot; Bagby said . &quot; This is the most accurate study to date , &quot; said Yvonne Haddad , a much-published scholar on Islam in America . Haddad , who teaches at the University of Massachusetts , noted that Bagby &quot; had every big gun in Islamic leadership in North_America supporting his research. &quot; One expected finding was that most masjids are multicultural . Seven of every 10 masjids have more_than one ethnic_group worshiping there , Bagby said . Either African Americans or Indo-Pakistanis were the largest groups at most masjids , followed closely by Arab Americans . The New York City area has the largest_number of masjids , 98 , followed by the Chicago metropolitan area with 60 and Southern California with 55 , the study said . But Southern California ranked second highest in estimated total attendance at the traditional midday Friday prayers at its 55 masjids , with 11 # 858 worshipers , compared to more_than 27 # 000 in the New York area . ( Devout Muslims are expected to pray five times daily , at_home or work , and to attend a Friday service , if possible. ) The states with the largest_numbers of masjids were New York ( 132 ) , California ( 117 ) , Illinois ( 74 ) , New Jersey ( 60 ) and Texas ( 58 ) . The highest attendance at Friday prayers was reported by 31 masjids in Washington , D.C. -- with an average of 472 people each -- and the 33 masjids in Toronto and the rest of the Ontario province of Canada , with an average of 328 , the study said . The average Friday attendance in Southern California masjids was reported to be 242 people , a figure which fails to reflect the much larger attendance at some major masjids . For example , the large Islamic Center of Southern California on Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles attracts between 1 # 000 and 1 # 500 people every Friday , according to Al-Marayati . And about 1 # 000 also attend services at the Islamic Society of Orange County in Garden Grove , he said . In the San Fernando Valley , combined attendance at two prayer_services of the Islamic Center of Northridge on a recent Friday was between 320 and 360 , said Hasan Mulla , director of the masjid . The Northridge masjid , which was organized in 1977 , is currently constructing a new building in Granada Hills just north of the Simi Valley Freeway . Smaller Valley area masjids hold Friday prayers in Van Nuys , North Hollywood and Santa Clarita . Islam in this country has loose federations rather than denominations . The survey found that 39 % of the masjids are affiliated with the Islamic Society of North_America , based in Plainfield , Ind. , but 30 % say they are independent . The next largest segment , 20 % , follows the lead of Imam W . Deen Mohammed of Chicago , who has steered the once-sectarian Black Muslim movement into the Islamic mainstream over the last two decades . The Nation of Islam , headed by controversial Minister Louis Farrakhan , was not included in the survey , Bagby said . &quot; The masjids we dealt with recognize each other as all belonging_to the mainstream of Islam , &quot; and they do not consider Farrakhan ' s group in that mainstream , he said . Organized Islam Mosques , called masjids or Islamic centers by Muslims , have been forming at a rapid rate in the U.S. and Canada in recent decades . Nearly 80 % of the existing 1 # 046 mosques were organized in the last 25 years . Years mosques formed : Before 1960 : 11 % 1960-69 : 11 % 1970-79 : 28 % Since 1980 : 50 % Sources : National Survey of Masjid Communities , Islamic Resources Institute , Fountain Valley , Calif .</TEXT>
