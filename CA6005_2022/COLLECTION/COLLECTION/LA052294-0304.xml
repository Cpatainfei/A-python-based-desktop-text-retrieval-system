   <HEADLINE> RETURN TO GRAND_SLAM GLORY ; ROD LAVER WAS THE LAST MAN TO SWEEP FOUR MAJOR TITLES AND THINKS IT CAN BE DONE AGAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dark clouds threatened more rain as Australians Rod Laver and Tony Roche played for the U.S. Open championship on a grass court left soggy by morning showers . The start of the match had been delayed 95 minutes while a helicopter helped dry the court . It was Sept . 8 , 1969 . Laver , 31 , was seven years older than Roche and had lost five of seven matches to him that year . Eight months earlier , Roche had pushed him in the semifinals of the Australian Open before Laver won , 7-5 , 22-20 , 9-11 , 1-6 , 6-3 , in 4 1 / 2 hours . Laver won the Australian title before also winning the_French Open and Wimbledon , moving him three-quarters of the way to a Grand_Slam . But Roche was determined to leave him short of his goal . &quot; I cheered for Rocket to make the Grand_Slam in ' 62 when I was a teen-ager , &quot; Roche said at the time . &quot; But I want to stop him this time. &quot; Roche opened a 5-4 lead in the first set at Forest Hills , N.Y. , but Laver altered the course of the match simply by changing shoes . Switching from tennis_shoes to spikes to improve his footing on the rain-slickened grass court , Laver completed his Grand_Slam with a 7-9 , 6-1 , 6-2 , 6-2 victory . In 25 years since , no man has duplicated the feat , which Laver first accomplished in ' 62 , matching the effort of Don Budge in 1938 . But many , Laver included , believe that Pete Sampras , 23 , could join Laver , Budge , Maureen Connolly , Margaret Court and Steffi Graf as the sport ' s only Grand_Slam winners if he can convert his mastery on faster courts to the slower clay of the_French Open , which starts Monday in Paris . Sampras , who has already won major titles on hardcourts at the U.S. Open and Australian Open and on grass at Wimbledon , won the Italian Open this month , easily the most impressive of his two clay-court titles . &quot; With his game -- he ' s got a beautiful game , a tremendous serve ; he can stay back or go_into the net -- it ' s just a matter of whether he peaks at the right time , &quot; said Laver , now 55 and living with Mary , his wife of 27 years , in Rancho Mirage . &quot; that ' s the all-important part of Pete ' s game -- to come_in strong and fresh and stay determined . &quot; If that ' s the case , he ' s got every chance to win . The clay is probably his toughest test . There are some great players out there who prefer the European clay . It ' s just a matter of playing your right game. &quot; Laver was at the top of his game in 1969 , the first full year of the open era , and had plenty of incentive to show the world how well he could play . The major events were opened_to professionals in 1968 , so Laver was eligible to play in them for the first time since his 1962 Grand_Slam , accomplished as an amateur . His hope was to sweep . &quot; I went_to Australia with that in mind , &quot; said the left-handed redhead from Rockhampton . Laver , in the pre-tiebreaker era , kept his dream alive by outlasting Roche in the two-hour second set of their semifinal match , which was played in 105-degree heat at Brisbane . Laver tried to beat the heat by draping cool , wet cabbage leaves inside his floppy sun hat . &quot; Fortunately , I grew_up in that area and I knew what it was like , &quot; Laver said . &quot; You sort of have a mental feeling of what it ' s going_to take . After the match , you certainly are tired and beat , but it ' s sort of a great feeling to come_through a tough one like that. &quot; Without a questionable call , he might have fallen_short . Laver , having lost in the third and fourth sets after serving for the match at 8-7 in the third , led in the fifth , 4-3 , with each player having held serve . In the eighth game , free-lance writer Paul Fein later reported , &quot; Roche missed a volley , normally his forte , to fall_behind , 15-30 . That set_up a huge pressure point and what would be one of the most famous -- or rather infamous -- line calls_in tennis history . Roche spun his wickedly swerving southpaw serve into Laver ' s body . Laver sliced his return crosscourt and seemingly just outside the singles sideline . &quot; When the official signaled safe , the usually mild-mannered Roche became furious . He turned_around and queried him , ' Did you actually make that call ? Did you really see the ball ? Do you think I stood_out here for more_than 4 1 / 2 hours to get a call like that ? ' &quot; Laver broke the crestfallen Roche , served out the match and didn ' t have nearly as much trouble in the final , winning in straight sets over Andres Gimeno of Spain . Although clay was far from his favorite surface , Laver also won rather easily at the_French Open after surviving a two-set deficit in the second round against countryman Dick Crealy . Another Australian , Ken Roswall , fell_in straight sets_in the final . &quot; I probably played my best tennis in the final , &quot; Laver said . &quot; And with that win , I felt a lot more secure ( about winning the Grand_Slam ) . The next two ( major tournaments ) were_on grass , and that was my favorite surface. &quot; At Wimbledon , in a four-set final , Laver defeated countryman John Newcombe . And so , it was_on to the rain-soaked U.S. Open , where Laver survived a five-set match against Dennis Ralston in the round of 16 -- and the mushy courts -- en route to earning the first prize of $ 16 # 000 , increasing his take_for the year to a then-record $ 106 # 000 . In the final , delayed by a day because of rain , Roche never changed out of his tennis_shoes , despite the conditions . &quot; His feeling was that he might get cramps because you tend not to slide as much , although I was still sliding in spikes , &quot; Laver said . &quot; But I found myself getting a little more confident as the match went_on because you could always get_to the ball ( in spikes ) . The balls were very heavy and would n ' t bounce very high , so you had to get there quickly. &quot; Twenty-five years later , Laver ' s feat seems all_the more remarkable because no man has been able to match it . &quot; You have to be very fortunate to play your best tennis , bring yourself up_to the peak four times during the year , &quot; said Laver , who didn ' t win another Grand_Slam event after 1969 . None of the male players who have followed Laver have won all four major titles in their careers , much less a year . Bjorn Borg didn ' t win the U.S. Open or the Australian Open , Newcombe and Jimmy Connors couldn ' t win the_French Open , John McEnroe never won the Australian Open or the_French Open . Ivan Lendl has not won Wimbledon , and Boris Becker has not won the_French Open . &quot; The new technology , with the bigger-headed rackets , allows the players to all play a lot better a lot quicker , so the competition becomes much more difficult , &quot; Laver said . &quot; And the depth of competition is probably the reason for no one coming_through to win the Grand_Slam . &quot; Back when I was playing , there were probably 20 or 30 ( players ) that you felt you ' d better be very careful against . Today , there are probably 150 . &quot; I thought somebody like Boris Becker , when he won Wimbledon at such a young age , would be a force to win them all . In some ways , you would have thought that one of the players would have put a whole year together and won all_the majors. &quot; Laver said he hopes Sampras can do_it . &quot; We know it ' s a long way off , &quot; Laver said , &quot; but if he can pull it off , hopefully , I ' ll be there first to shake his hand. &quot;</TEXT>
