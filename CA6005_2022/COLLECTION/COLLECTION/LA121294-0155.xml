   <HEADLINE> A BUBBLE WAITING TO BURST ? ; S . KOREAN SALARIES GROWING AT TOO FAST A PACE , MANY FEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Daewoo Electronics Co . has achieved a small but significant milestone in South_Korea ' s drive to join the ranks of the world ' s advanced industrial nations . Its South_Korean workers now earn more_than their counterparts in some of Daewoo ' s Western factories . For example , workers at a Daewoo videocassette_recorder factory in Kumi , South_Korea , now draw average salaries of $ 1 # 300 per month , while employees of a similar Daewoo VCR plant in Northern_Ireland average $ 1 # 200 per month , according to Bae Soon Hoon , president of Daewoo Electronics . The workers at Kumi , unlike their Irish counterparts , also get a free lunch . Thanks to the rapidly rising wages paid by Korean employers such_as Daewoo , free-spending workers are helping to fuel a booming economy here . After a slowdown in 1992 and 1993 , gross_domestic_product is expected to grow by more_than 8 % this year . Times are good indeed , but they may be too good for some Koreans who worry that South_Korea is headed for a crash . Wages are rising too fast and outpacing increases in production , says Bae , a situation that is a &quot; time_bomb &quot; threatening to undermine South_Korea ' s international competitiveness . He notes that while South_Korean wages have caught_up_with Northern_Ireland ' s , Britain ' s per-capita GDP is still about 2.5 times greater than South_Korea ' s . South_Korea could be caught in a bubble of expanding wages and consumption that cannot be sustained by the country ' s fundamental economic strength , leading eventually to a collapse that would bankrupt some companies and bring a jump in unemployment , said Bae , adding , &quot; I hope that will not happen , but it can. &quot; The current boom was ignited by government steps to encourage corporate investment , plus the effect of a strong Japanese yen , which makes South_Korean products relative bargains compared to competing goods from Japan . Inflation is running at a tolerable 6 % , while wages are up an average of 7 % and unemployment is down to just 2.2 % . South_Korea ' s 1993 GNP of $ 329 billion made_it the 14th largest economy in the world , and it is still headed_up fast . &quot; Shipbuilding , automobiles , semiconductors , chemicals -- these industries have been doing_well in the domestic market and also in exports , whereas textiles in_general , footwear , clothing , these kinds of things are doing relatively poorly , &quot; said Yoo Jung Ho , a scholar working with the South_Korean government ' s Economic Planning_Board . &quot; This isn ' t really surprising , because the industries doing_well are relatively capital intensive with a higher level of technology , whereas clothing and footwear are labor-intensive. &quot; Consumer spending , Bae said , has seen &quot; steady growth from last year , although everything became more luxurious . The bigger cars are selling well , the bigger refrigerators are selling well. &quot; But this has him worried too : &quot; Consumers should recognize this is too big for our economy . . . . I wonder when the adjustment is coming. &quot; Others in South_Korea argue that the economy is already making adjustments that will address the concerns raised by Bae . With its labor cost advantage gone , the nation is attempting to take_advantage of the current prosperity to develop technology- driven industries that will help it remain competitive with other nations . The quasi-governmental Committee on High-Tech Industries , in a report last month to the Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy , predicted that by 2005 , South_Korean firms could hold 5.5 % of the global market in a variety of fast-growing high-tech industries . High-technology industries such_as semiconductors , liquid_crystal_displays , industrial robotics and optoelectronics are expected to increase production by 18 % or more each year , the report said . If these growth_rates are achieved , South_Korean high-technology production in 2005 would be valued at about $ 330 billion , or 3.5 times this year ' s total exports of $ 93 billion , the report said . Achieving these goals will require heavy corporate investment , but big firms seem willing . Hyundai Electronics_Industries Co. , for example , has devoted 13 % of its semiconductor revenue to research and development , said Chang Hong Jo , senior_vice_president in_charge of semiconductor research . Corporations and the government are serious about achieving the targets set_out in the high-technology report , said Lee Youn Ho , a scholar at the Lucky-Goldstar Economic Research Institute . &quot; We have to do_it . Without achieving this kind of target , we will be a less-developed country forever. &quot; South_Korean firms are already having dramatic success in upgrading their factories , according to a recent report by Baring Securities in Tokyo . South_Korea ' s 30 largest business groups will invest nearly $ 19 billion in improving factories in the second_half of 1994 , up 77 % from the same period of last year , the report added . By contrast , Japanese firms are struggling just to restore profits after a long recession , the report noted , adding : &quot; It is hard to avoid the conclusion that , in the years ahead , those Japanese companies who compete head-to-head with the Koreans will be facing as difficult and dangerous an opponent as they themselves were over the past 20 years. &quot; The picture was quite different just a couple years ago . Korean economic_growth , which sometimes ran at double_digits in the 1980s , fell to 4.7 % in 1992 , the worst performance since 1980 . Then in late 1992 , longtime opposition leader Kim Young Sam was elected president . Despite his popularity with voters , business_leaders were worried about his policies , and the economic slowdown lingered on for months after he took_office in February , 1993 . The turnaround came last year when Kim invited about 30 top business_leaders to one-on-one private meetings at his official residence -- the Blue House -- to assure them that the government would support the economy and the private sector , said Lee , the Lucky-Goldstar scholar . &quot; He met the owners of the big conglomerates and big companies face-to-face . . . and asked them to invest actively , &quot; Lee said . Those meetings , Korean executives said , gave businesses the assurance and confidence to move ahead with investments that would stimulate the economy . Times researcher Chi Jung Nam in Seoul contributed to this report .
