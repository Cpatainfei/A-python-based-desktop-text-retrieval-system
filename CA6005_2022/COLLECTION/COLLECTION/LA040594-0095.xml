   <HEADLINE> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE : ALSO-RANS IN THE NAME GAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite a plummeting stock_market and jitters brought_on by an overheated economy , 540 Americans stopped worrying long enough to submit more_than 600 of their favorite and least favorite business names to the 1994 Great and Not-So-Great Small Business Name contest . It took one exhausted columnist about 12 hours to open , sort , laugh and review the submissions . While most people sent_in one or two names , some sent_in two_dozen or more . Others , in a blatant attempt to influence the judge ' s decision , sent_in autographed baseball_cards , plastic wind-up toys , T-shirts , computer mouse pads , hand-made greeting_cards , family photographs , videotapes , business_cards and photocopied Yellow Pages from around the country . Proud fathers nominated sons , mothers crowed about their daughters and several husbands cheerfully submitted their wives ' business names . Due_to the overwhelming outpouring of nominations , the runners-up in several categories follow . The national grand prize_winners will be featured in this space next week . Some names , like &quot; The Garden of Beadin &quot; bead shop in Garberville , Calif. , were clever . Irene McDonnell of Falls Church , Va. , nominated a beauty_shop called &quot; Hairforce 1. &quot; The name sticks_in her mind because it ' s near Andrews Air_Force Base where Air_Force One is stationed . A couple of Northwest coffee companies were nominated , including the &quot; Higher Ground &quot; in Eugene , Ore. , and &quot; The Bean Buzz &quot; in nearby Springfield . Isaac Broberg of Minneapolis came very close to submitting this year ' s worst name with the &quot; Cheek to Cheek &quot; diaper service . &quot; Useful Products &quot; based in Los Gatos , Calif. , would win the most boring name category , if there was one . Virginia Leach of Piedmont , Calif. , likes the &quot; Uprisings Bakery &quot; in Berkeley , especially since it ' s &quot; an apt double_entendre if you know Berkeley ' s reputation. &quot; * This year , the construction and home improvement category produced a wealth of contenders . Martha Miller nominated her husband , Gene , who ' s known around Iowa as &quot; Miller the Driller. &quot; His Des Moines-based drilling contractor has been dubbed &quot; Iowa ' s Most Boring Contractor , &quot; and &quot; rest assured , we do the ' hole ' job , &quot; writes Mrs . Miller . Ron Hutson , a Sierra Madre handyman , calls his business , &quot; Ron ' s Around Tuitt Fix-It Service. &quot; Hutson admits he borrowed the name from a small wooden sign he spotted in a Solvang gift_shop . The sign said : &quot; We know your husband can make these for you , but will he ever get_around tuit ? &quot; North Hollywood-based &quot; Totally Nuts &amp; Bolts and Supply Co. &quot; topped the list in the construction category . Eddie Joseph submitted the name with a reminder that his federal trademark registration is pending . &quot; Me and Him Carpet Cleaning &quot; was submitted by its grammatically challenged owner , Trevor Ward . Laurie Touhey of West Paterson , N.J. , cast her vote for &quot; Sham Home Improvement , &quot; based in Queens , N.Y. &quot; The owner ' s name is Ghan Sham , so apparently he thought it was appropriate , &quot; writes Touhey . &quot; I wonder if he realizes the implications his name is giving to his carpentry and Sheetrock business ! &quot; Marsha Sweet likes her husband David ' s name for his Story City , Iowa , construction company : &quot; Home Sweet Home Construction. &quot; And , any knucklehead could figure_out that San Francisco-based &quot; Floods , Floods , Floods Inc. &quot; provides emergency pumping and drying_out services to water-logged businesses . John Smith , owner of &quot; HappyVac Cleaning Service &quot; in Orlando , Fla. , sent_in a color photograph of himself proudly standing next to his HappyVac van . He says his name is great because &quot; it is positive and easy to remember. &quot; &quot; Sewer_Rat , &quot; a sewer cleaning service in Arlington , Tex. , was nominated by Gay Hawke of Centreville , Va. , Treasurer Paul Machado nominated his family ' s &quot; Macho Concrete Construction Co. &quot; in Upper Marlboro , Md . Machado says his mother , who serves as president , &quot; had second_thoughts &quot; about the name , but most people like it . * A Minneapolis health_care consulting firm called &quot; Third Opinion &quot; was a front runner , as was &quot; A Tale of Two Kitties , &quot; a catalogue for cat lovers based in Studio City . &quot; Oph Tha Waul Surfware , &quot; in Orlando , Fla . is pronounced &quot; off the wall , &quot; according to owner Charlie Trefry . &quot; Once our customers figure it out , they can never forget it. &quot; Briefly . . . Save the date : The 1995 White_House Conference on Small Business is set to convene June 11 to 15 in Washington , D.C. But there ' s plenty to do before the national meeting next summer . Fifty-nine state and regional conferences have been scheduled to identify the top small-business concerns and to elect delegates to the conference .

Choosing a Name Douglas Whaley , who works_on &quot; The Simpsons &quot; television_show , says he spends his days &quot; satirizing the wonderful world of business. &quot; Whaley , who previously worked in advertising and design , sent_in these tips for business owners trying to select a good name for their venture : * Keep the name to three or fewer syllables . * Tape_record your voice to hear how your business name will sound to others . * Avoid overused name extensions such_as Bar Stools 2000 or Hair Plugs R-Us . * Make_sure your business name is easy to spell . * Choose a name that accurately reflects your business . Don ' t call yourself Creative Croissants if your business isn ' t innovative in any way . * Visualize your name on a directory .
