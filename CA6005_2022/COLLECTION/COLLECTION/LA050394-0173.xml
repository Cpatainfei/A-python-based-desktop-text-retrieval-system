   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : GLENDALE ; CITY OFFERS ALTERNATIVES TO KILLING PIGEONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> City officials are promoting education over euthanasia after a move by the City_Council to trap and kill hundreds of pigeons ruffled residents ' feathers . The council will review several alternatives -- including an ordinance that would ban pigeon feeding -- during its afternoon meeting today . The alternatives were drafted after a controversial council decision last month to trap and poison the prolific birds with carbon_monoxide by putting them in a cloth sack and tying it to the tailpipe of a running car . Removing the birds became necessary after a flock of pigeons 10 # 000 strong roosted in the downtown business_district -- fouling awnings , sidewalks and ledges , officials said . The city is the first in Los Angeles County to adopt such a sweeping measure , which prompted calls from animal rights activists around the country . JENNIFER OLDHAM</TEXT>
