Beavers ( Abrams / Alliance for the Arts , $ 12.95 paper ) . In fall , many_a Californian ' s fancy turns_to New York . would n ' t a quick trip back there be nice right about now ? The weather , at least theoretically , is beautiful . The hotels and restaurants are hungry for imported business after the summer doldrums . And then there ' s all that culture , culture , culture . That the visitor will be &quot; car-free &quot; in New York City , of course , is understood . Who ' d want to fight traffic , scrap for a parking_space , worry about vandals and thieves with a rented Ford ? &quot; Car-Free in New York City &quot; is a useful guide that goes_far beyond mere public_transport information and tips for getting_around Manhattan . Included are details of free attractions in the city , suggested day trips ( by train ) , interesting neighborhoods , discounts and more . Fodor ' s Flashmaps series ( &quot; The Ultimate Street &amp; Information Finder &quot; ) is a splendid little ( nearly pocket-size ) volume that packs a dazzling quantity of information into its tightly formatted , graphically sophisticated design . Here are easy-to-read maps of everything from airports to restaurants to churches to ZIP_Codes , with addresses and phone_numbers . You won ' t get any particulars here , but the hard facts are copious and easily accessible . &quot; NYC Culture Catalog , &quot; produced by the Alliance for the Arts , &quot; a nonprofit organization dedicated to policy research , information services and advocacy for the arts in New York City , &quot; is laid_out like a catalogue of university_extension courses . It ' s written like one , too ( &quot; Korea ' s rich cultural heritage is celebrated through performance and exhibition programs presented by the Korean Cultural Service &quot; ) . Assuming that this tone doesn ' t bother you , it ' s a comprehensive , information-packed key to what seems like darned near everything cultural to see and do_in Gotham . A THOUSAND LEAGUES OF BLUE ; THE SIERRA CLUB BOOK OF THE PACIFIC ; A LITERARY VOYAGE , edited and with an introduction by John A . Murray ( Sierra Club Books , $ 16 paper ) . The endlessly enthralling Pacific_Ocean , which encompasses everything from the sunny beaches of Southern California to the frozen reaches of the Arctic and the Antarctic , with the Galapagos Islands , Hawaii , Japan , Australia , New Guinea and about 100 # 000 other places in between , has inspired writers ( and preliterate observers ) for thousands of years . This rich , delicious collection goes_back as far as Capt . James Cook ( an account of his visit to Easter Island in 1768 ) and comes_up as close as Barry Lopez on the Galapagos and the volume ' s editor on the aforementioned California coast . Also included are Charles_Darwin , Herman Melville , Mark Twain , Jack London , Edward Abbey , Annie Dillard and Peter Matthiessen . ZOO by Anthony D . Marshall ( Random House , $ 12 paper ) and THE ZOO BOOK ; A GUIDE TO AMERICA ' S BEST by Allen W . Nyhuis ( Carousel Press , $ 14.95 paper ) . Some people hate zoos and don ' t care who knows it . Zoos exploit animals , say the critics , and subject them to mistreatment . The place of wild beasts is in the wild . True , to an extent . But zoos , especially in the United States also protect animals , both individuals and species , and can engender in us urban humans an appreciation and respect for creatures of the wild that might one day translate to their conservation and preservation . Anthony Marshall ' s guide to this country ' s zoos , aquariums and wildlife parks addresses the issues of such conservation and preservation , and tells us not just what ' s in the places he covers but what gets done there , and by whom , and with what intent . Allen Nyhuis ' book is more concerned with facilities and attractions . Both include directions , opening hours and other practical information . Quick trips : NORTHERN CYPRUS ; A TRAVELLER ' S GUIDE by Eileen Davey ( I.B. Tauris Books / St . Martin ' s Press , $ 19.95 paper ) . Northern Cyprus is Turkish Cyprus , less developed than the Greek-run southern part of the island , and still full of unspoiled landscapes and extraordinary human remains ( from Neolithic villages to Venetian walled cities ) . Eileen Davey is an archeologist and historian , and her account is highly detailed , though it does lack scene-setting romantic flair . SOUTH_DAKOTA by T . D . Griffith , photographs by Paul Horsted ( Compass American Guides / Fodor ' s , $ 16.95 paper ) . With handsome color photography , miscellaneous documentary material ( historic portraits , old railway posters ) , numerous sidebars and asides and a fact-filled but lively text , this new entry in Fodor ' s Compass series gives weight and shape to a fascinating state most of us ( for shame ! ) would probably have trouble finding on a map . Books to Go appears the second and fourth week of every month .</TEXT>
