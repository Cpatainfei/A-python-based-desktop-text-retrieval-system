   <HEADLINE> THE VALUE OF RESEARCH ON WOMEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To young_women , Friday ' s article by Times medical writer Thomas H . Maugh II looked_like bad news : Women who are pregnant when breast_cancer is diagnosed are three times more likely to die of the disease and the effect doesn ' t fade entirely until five years after the last pregnancy . But , paradoxically , the end result of this knowledge will be fewer deaths . The international research led by doctors at the M . D . Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and reported today in the medical journal Lancet is the sort of gender-specific research that women ' s organizations have long called_for . Doctors always knew that younger_women died more often of breast_cancer , and that many cancers , in both men and women , are more virulent in younger people . Now that pregnancy is known to be such a large factor , more research is indicated to determine which hormonal or immunological factors of pregnancy are involved in raising the risk and whether women with high known risk factors for breast_cancer are particularly vulnerable . Knowledge is the first prerequisite to better prevention and treatment . While this research is somber news , it is not a reason for women to fear pregnancy . Breast_cancer is rare in young_women , hitting only one woman in 2 # 426 by age 30 , compared with one in eight over a lifetime . And not all women are at equal risk of contracting breast_cancer while young . Earlier research has shown a much higher risk for women with a strong familial pattern of breast_cancer , peaking in women whose mothers had pre-menopausal cancer in both breasts . This latest report is part of a recent spate of studies on breast_cancer , including one that found better survival results for pre-menopausal breast_cancer patients who had surgery at mid-cycle , near the time of ovulation . That breast_cancer is apparently exacerbated by the hormonal and immunological changes of pregnancy is not much of a surprise , but no one had done the research . There are other sorts of gender-specific research that need similar attention , particularly the inclusion of women in trials of new drugs . Almost all_of what we know about the safety and efficacy of drugs comes from trials on adult men , for reasons including worry that a trial participant might be pregnant . But the breast_cancer findings are proof of the benefits of gender-specific studies .</TEXT>
