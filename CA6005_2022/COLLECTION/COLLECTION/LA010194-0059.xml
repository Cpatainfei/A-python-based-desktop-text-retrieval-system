   <HEADLINE> PHOTOS ' RELEASE LEADS POLICE TO SUSPECT IN MOLESTATION ; CRIME : TWO HOURS AFTER BROADCAST OF YOUNG VICTIM ' S PICTURE , TIPS GUIDE AUTHORITIES TO ROWLAND HEIGHTS MAN . GIRL IS BELIEVED TO BE SAFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just two hours after TV_stations broadcast photos of an unknown child molestation victim Friday afternoon , a flurry of phone tips guided police to a suspect in Rowland Heights . The victim is believed to be safe . The unusual case began Thursday when Whittier police received an envelope of snapshots that showed a girl , apparently between the ages of 4 and 6 , being sexually molested by a man . The photos were found by a resident of a Whittier motel who was going_through the motel ' s trash_bin looking_for cigarette coupons . Police sought permission to release a photo of the girl to help the investigation . But at first a Los Angeles County Juvenile_Court judge refused , out of concern for the child ' s privacy . After police exhausted all available leads , Judge Marcus O . Tucker decided Friday to allow release of a photograph of the girl , cropped to reveal only her face . Police also released cropped photos of the room where the molestation took_place , in hopes that distinctive items there , including a collection of alligator-themed pictures and knickknacks , might help in identifying the location . None of the dozen photos found showed the face of the perpetrator . Broadcast of the photos on TV news at 4 p.m. brought a deluge of calls , police said . Within 20 minutes they received the first of three phone_calls identifying the girl and her home , said Whittier Police Lt . Steve Milakovich . The suspect , described as a man who rents a room to the girl and her mother , was detained about 6 p.m. The suspect , Paul Loe , 46 , had been arrested earlier in December and charged with sex crimes against a child , but was released Dec . 28 pending trial , a sheriff ' s spokesman said . If the photos are found to depict a different crime , the spokesman said , Loe will be rearrested . Milakovich said broadcast of the photograph was crucial to finding the suspect . &quot; It was extremely important to reveal the evidence , &quot; he said . &quot; The community responded quite well. &quot; Sheriff ' s deputies took_over the investigation Friday night because the crime allegedly occurred in unincorporated Rowland Heights , in southeastern Los Angeles County . By late Friday evening , police had not talked to the girl , but said she apparently was safe and in the custody of her mother , although they were not at_home . Last October , the release of a photograph in a similar case led to the arrest of two suspects . Photographs found on a street in Koreatown showed a 3-year-old-girl apparently being molested by a man and a woman . Within days of the release of photos showing the faces of the two suspects , they were apprehended . They are now awaiting trial in San Bernardino County .</TEXT>
