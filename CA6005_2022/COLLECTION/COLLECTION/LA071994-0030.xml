   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; PAINTERS PUT WRY SPIN ON HIGH , LOW CULTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Good news for fellow_travelers in the summer art wasteland : Griffin Fine_Art in Costa Mesa is showing hip yet endearing abstract paintings by two young Los Angeles artists through July 31 . * Steve Roden and Daniel Manns have worked_out personal styles based on such disparate things as wordplay , early- ' 60s color_schemes , computer_graphics , Zen pattern-making and a tongue-in-cheek replay of Color Field painting . Roden graduated from the Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design in L.A. in 1986 and earned his master of fine_arts degree at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena . Manns is an Orange County native and attended Orange Coast College . Both artists have been in exhibitions at several critically well-regarded L.A. area galleries , including &quot; Germinal Notations &quot; at Food House and &quot; Sawtelle &quot; at Domestic Setting . Roden ' s paintings on small ( and very small ) wood panels play little visual games with words . The irregular , hand-drawn lettering mingles with decorative devices and ghostly snatches of imagery that often seem trapped beneath layers of beeswax or urethane . I found them instantly captivating for purely visual reasons ; only later did I concern myself with what they may mean . Details coolly recall early- ' 60s fabric patterns ( bull ' s-eyes , elongated ovals , pinwheels ) , Abstract Expressionist painting cliches ( wiry , tangled lines ) or pop culture objects ( martini olives , tears ) . Made with the help of computer-generated imagery , the compositions have a dreamy , subconscious quality -- like a cross between doodling and writing the first draft of a poem . In fact , a_couple_of works ( &quot; Iambic Pentameter , &quot; &quot; The Last Poem of John Clare &quot; ) refer directly to poetry . Painted on tin , the latter work has a flickering metallic sheen . The outline of a tall , stacked shape reminiscent_of a Russian Suprematist construction accompanies a trio of echoing words : nest , vessel , rest . The shape recalls the painstaking job of &quot; building &quot; a poem ; the sheen evokes the luminous effect of getting_it right . Clare was an impoverished English 19th-Century landscape poet who worked as a day_laborer and spent the last decades of his life in an insane_asylum writing what some believe was his best work . In &quot; Inconsiderable Things , &quot; the word silent appears three times , along with three beach_balls and a_couple_of meandering ornamental flourishes . The painting encapsulates a random yet arbitrary universe in which words , images of objects and apparently meaningless designs share the same space . Why should the letters s-i-l-e-n-t and the stripe pattern signifying &quot; beach_ball &quot; be more meaningful than several elaborate squiggles ? Because everything depends_on our tacit understanding of signs and symbols . Silence and emptiness -- scrutinized in a wryly clinical way , as if putting quotation_marks around the self-pitying modes of adolescence and bad poets -- are leitmotifs of Roden ' s paintings and his 39 drawings in_colored pencil on index cards . One of the drawings contains the phrase &quot; tears were standing_in our eyes , &quot; with a group of capital I ' s standing around like lonely figures in an empty landscape . * Nine years ago , Manns ' work in a student exhibition was awarded &quot; best of show &quot; by then-Laguna Art Museum director William Otton . These days , Manns is having fun with a bunch of familiar pop culture and modern art devices , ranging from lipsticked &quot; kiss &quot; prints to striped swatches of fabric that playfully erode the high seriousness of stripe paintings from the 1960s . In these untitled paintings , low culture subsumes high culture in the most beguiling ways . Veering-on-cheesy color combinations ( yellow and tan , peach and green , purple and green ) evoke the curious popular tastes of the early ' 60s . Those years were also the heyday of Color Field painting , envisioned as a coolly rational alternative to the Sturm und Drang of Abstract_Expressionism , as well as Pop Art . Big-scale motifs that look_like unraveled skeins of yarn ( a popular ' 60s craft medium ) variously suggest viscera , DNA and the huge image of canned spaghetti in Pop artist James Rosenquist ' s famous 1965 painting of contemporary American life in overdrive , &quot; The F-111. &quot; In one of Manns ' paintings , a row of giant gray comma shapes superimposed on a tangle of skeins recalls Supergraphics , the commercial Pop spinoff ; below , a small swatch of striped fabric amusingly mimics a bar_code . As smart and witty as this work is , it also communicates beautifully on a purely visual level . Manns ' exuberant compositions keep the eye roving and the senses revved_up . If he still lived_in Orange County , he ' d cream the competition ; as it is , he is one of a glorious crop of younger L.A. artists whose work we too rarely get_to see down here . * Paintings by Steve Roden and Daniel Manns are at Griffin Fine_Art , 1640 Pomona Ave. , Costa Mesa , through July 31 . Hours : 6 to 11 p.m. Thursdays ; 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays ; noon to 5 p.m. Sundays ; or by appointment . Admission : Free . ( 714 ) 646-5665 .</TEXT>
