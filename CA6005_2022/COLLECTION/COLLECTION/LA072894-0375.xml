   <HEADLINE> GETTING O.C. A PIECE OF THE ' ACTION ! ' ; CRISTI SILVERBERG WILL LEAD THE EFFORT TO GIVE THE COUNTY A BIGGER ROLE IN THE MOVIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If your stick-em pads are in color-coded piles on your desk and you hate it when somebody throws you a curve_ball and suddenly wants you to find a place to dry-clean 200 pounds of hockey uniforms , and somebody else calls frantic and says , &quot; Oh , by the way , could you find us 200 hotel_rooms tonight for our entire film crew because we forgot &quot; . . . well , then , you would not want Cristi Silverberg ' s job . As Orange County ' s director of the newly funded Orange County Film Office , Silverberg spends a lot of time reacting to assorted near-disasters . But now that the county has decided to spend some money to make some money off the movie business , Silverberg should have the time and funds to attract more film productions like &quot; Clear_and_Present_Danger &quot; and &quot; North , &quot; summer releases that were shot , in part , locally . What all this means is that government leaders think such showcasing will put us on the map and bring more tourist dollars , besides the dough spent by film crews at hotels , restaurants , catering companies and the_like . Wooing Hollywood , then , is Orange County ' s new game_plan , and Silverberg will lead the effort . Last month , the Board of Supervisors unanimously voted to bankroll a film office that will try attracting more television and motion_picture productions to the county , budgeting $ 242 # 500 for the next three years . That includes Silverberg ' s salary and her office space at the Orange County Chamber_of_Commerce , which will also throw_in some funding . No more sitting_back and waiting for the lucky day when the phone rings with Buick on the line wanting help to find a big clean stretch of highway for a car commercial . Silverberg ' s job now is to actively court the entertainment_industry by marketing the county ' s potential as a backdrop -- and its new willingness to be film-friendly . She will also be aiming to streamline the permit process for film crews by working closely with the county ' s city governments , starting with a workshop Wednesday at the Waterfront Hilton for city administrators called &quot; Film Production in Your Community. &quot; Every time Orange County is used as a backdrop to a car commercial or a TV movie it means money : permit fees and bed tax to the county or city , and other lodging and food bucks to businesses . In approving the new film office funding , the Board of Supervisors pointed to a county report showing that film crews spent $ 27 million in San Diego County last year , contrasted with a paltry $ 200 # 000 in Orange County . But nothing that couldn ' t be quick-changed by a blockbuster series , say Placentia 92670 . Silverberg laughs , but she knows well that a show like &quot; Simon and Simon , &quot; with its San Diego Zoo plot_lines and La Jolla backdrops , is money in the bank . For now , she remains completely un-starstruck . On the set of the &quot; Clear_and_Present_Danger , &quot; a suspense making its debut next month and starring Harrison Ford and John Wayne Airport , Silverberg almost asked Harrison Ford how to find . . . Harrison Ford . &quot; I was staring right at him , and I was about five feet away , and I said , ' Gee , I wonder what Harrison Ford looks_like in this . Has anyone seen him ? ' &quot; she says , laughing . &quot; He did seem to get a kick_out of that. &quot; * As for movies , she rarely sees anything but animated or Disney -- except those with Orange County scenery , of course . A 32-year-old single mother , she has long but accommodating hours that start at 7:30 a.m. She usually leaves her office in The City shopping_center in Orange by 5 p.m. and has an hour to exercise or ride at the stable before picking_up her 4-year-old son at preschool . Up until now , if someone wanted to shoot a commercial or movie in Orange County , they would have to secure permits from each city involved . &quot; Pick_up a phone and call any city to just ask , who do you call ? You can spend hours just trying to find that out , and then that person ' s gonna be_on vacation , &quot; said Glen Everroad , revenue manager of Newport Beach , whose office handles the city ' s film permits . Last year , the city hosted 122 days of filming . &quot; A lot of cities , I think , just don ' t see the benefit . But there is $ 4 billion in film dollars leaving the state of California because bureaucrats such_as myself can ' t accommodate their needs . . . . We can turn_around a permit some days in 30 minutes , but in ( the city of ) Orange , they want two weeks still. &quot; * For several years , Silverberg has been working for the county Environmental Management Agency , one of two people handling public relations matters for the director . When the county ' s public information office was eliminated , its tasks of coordinating with the film_industry were turned_over to the EMA ; it made_sense that EMA , which handles public_property permits , would absorb the processing of applications by production companies for film permits . &quot; I personally think she ' s very competent and really has a love for film , &quot; said Kay Smoot , an EMA planner for whom Silverberg briefly worked , &quot; so she really puts her all behind the job. &quot; Initially , that took_up only about 10 % of her time , Silverberg said . But eventually coordinating with the movie business came_to take_up the majority of her day . The benefits , though , seem pretty obvious : a $ 35 # 000 salary ( her position actually costs the county a total of $ 61 # 000 counting benefits ) and a lot of fun . &quot; I get_to meet a lot of different people , and there ' s always variety , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s always exciting to be_on a movie set , but I ' ve never been a person who really got excited about stars. &quot; * Born in Lakewood , she moved with her parents , two brothers and two sisters to Los Alamitos , then later to San Jose , where she graduated from high_school and then attended two years at San Jose State . She finished her degree in advertising / communications at Cal State Fullerton . After a modeling stint during college , Silverberg decided the limelight wasn ' t for her . She did an internship with an advertising_agency that specialized in music industry clients -- although her first solo account was a Mexican restaurant in Cypress -- and then took a job after college with a landscape_architecture firm . Bor-ing . &quot; I thought I really wanted to be in corporate America , &quot; Silverberg said . &quot; After nine months of doing packets and descriptions for bids , a newsletter and a_few press_releases , &quot; she quit to work in corporate marketing for a firm in banking and real_estate . The company advertised in the Los Angeles Rams football game program but refused to allow ad copy writers to use any sports metaphors -- ' let us drive your investments to the goal_line , ' that sort of thing . They were so conservative , Silverberg ' s said , that her big feat was getting them to change the color of their lettered ad copy . After three months , she quit . Her next job was more colorful : director of group sales for singer Bill Medley ' s nightclubs , called the Hop . All but one have since been sold , and that one is now called Music City , in Fountain Valley . &quot; It was a really fun job , a really good place to be , &quot; Silverberg said . But then came the bar_mitzvah from hell . Seems the chef for a large party that day was very ill , should have gone_home really , Silverberg said . But he didn ' t , and instead was constantly interrupted by bouts of nausea , making the bar_mitzvah lunch 30 minutes late . The boy ' s mother was furious and threatened to sue Medley , who decided he ' d had enough with that hassle and stopped the large-group end of the business . Hence , Silverberg ' s job was eliminated . For the next three years she worked as a cocktail waitress at the Hop . She also worked as catering and convention services manager at the Anaheim Sheraton but eventually quit both to work for the county EMA . * Silverberg says she has no interest in performing before the camera , and none of her friends or family even hit her up for bit_parts , an introduction to Mr. Stallone , a &quot; can ' t you just show him my script ? &quot; -- nothing . Silverberg does enjoy following the process of how a television ad or a movie is created , how all_the scattered parts come_together . &quot; When they were filming ' Clear_and_Present_Danger ' at John Wayne Airport , I watched them do the same scene over and over for two hours , &quot; she said . &quot; They were at the luggage_carousel , and the luggage comes_down and Harrison Ford would pick_up the luggage , look_around -- in this movie he ' s being chased by a sniper -- and then he would walk away and they ' d yell cut . Over and over they did_it . The makeup man would keep running_over and combing ( Ford ' s ) hair -- how could it move_in that time ? &quot; Her marketing efforts will be ongoing , but her typical day involves constant phone work . She works mostly with location managers and producers , who seek her help in finding a certain spot to shoot this car chase or that helicopter landing , help in getting quick permits from cities , working_out problems like not being able to shoot , say , a freeway , when they want to . Generally Silverberg has about 72 hours notice for television shoots , a bit more for feature_films . Sometimes , it ' s less . Sometimes the problems are not so little . When &quot; Mighty Ducks II &quot; was filming in Anaheim , someone from the crew realized -- at the last minute , natch -- that they had hockey uniforms and costumes and no place to clean them . &quot; Yeah , ' Mighty Ducks II ' needed someone who could launder 200 pounds a day for 14 days , and we didn ' t have anyone , &quot; Silverberg said . &quot; I was finally able to convince a uniform company in Irvine that they should bring staff on for it . I felt pretty good about that. &quot; * Then there was the January filming here of the movie based on Tom Clancy ' s novel . &quot; With ' Clear_and_Present_Danger , ' the crew called the afternoon of their first day of filming , saying they ' d forgot to book hotel_rooms , &quot; Silverberg recalls , like it was no big deal at all . Fortunately , she added , &quot; I found the Radisson hotel right across the street from John Wayne Airport that was nearly empty , &quot; and it was $ 15 # 000 a day richer for the duration of the shoot . Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley is probably the most popular filming location in the county because there is a huge airfield the county purchased from the military that has lent itself to a weird variety of shoots . Buick filmed an anniversary commercial there with 60-foot-high candles ringing a big painted logo . Goodyear did a commercial there for this past Super Bowl in which water-skiers pulled by a car were filmed on the park ' s airfield , which had been rigged to hold a thin layer of water , Silverberg said . &quot; Defending Your Life , &quot; starring Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep , also was filmed there . Her first extensive involvement with a film came last year with &quot; Demolition Man , &quot; which starred Sylvester Stallone and parts of Irvine and the Fluor Corp . tower . Still , she never made_it down to the set . Commercials are still the main kind of filming done_in Orange County , and some of it Silverberg doesn ' t learn about until after the fact . &quot; ' Star Trek IV ' was shot at McDonnell Douglas , &quot; she says laughing , &quot; and they were just hidden there the whole time . I didn ' t even know they were here . I guess that means they didn ' t have any problems. &quot;</TEXT>
