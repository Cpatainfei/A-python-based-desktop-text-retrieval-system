   <HEADLINE> BAIUL WINS GOLD ; KERRIGAN TAKES SILVER ; OLYMPICS : FIGURE_SKATING EVENTS WIND_UP -- IN MORE CONTROVERSY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There were as_many arguments inside the Olympic Amphitheatre on Friday night about who should have won the Winter Olympic women ' s figure_skating competition as there were sequins , but one thing almost everyone agreed upon was that Ukraine ' s Oksana Baiul and the United States ' Nancy Kerrigan went toe-loop to toe-loop with the immense challenges that faced them and won . There is , however , only one gold medal , and the fact that it was draped around Baiul ' s neck thrilled her supporters and angered those of Kerrigan , who accepted her silver medal more graciously than they did . What could have been more appropriate than for the controversial events of figure_skating ' s longest winter to climax with more controversy ? The nine judges were divided , five awarding first-place scores to Baiul , and four to Kerrigan after their four-minute freestyle programs , which accounted_for two-thirds of the final score . That was the decisive_factor , although two judges who favored Kerrigan also ranked Baiul behind China ' s Chen Lu , who won the bronze medal . France ' s Surya Bonaly was fourth . With her triumph , Baiul , 16 , became the youngest_women ' s gold medalist since 15-year-old Sonja Henie of Norway in 1928 . Almost forgotten when the night began because she no longer was among the medal contenders after Wednesday night ' s technical program , the United States ' Tonya Harding became the center of unwanted attention again momentarily when she had to leave the ice early in her program with a boot problem . Given a chance to start over later , she finished a respectable eighth . But for the first time in more_than seven weeks , the buzz in the sport was not about Nancy vs . Tonya but Nancy vs . Oksana . &quot; If you go_with one judging panel , you get one result , and if you go_with another panel , you get another result , &quot; said Christy Ness , who coached the United States ' Kristi Yamaguchi to the gold medal in the 1992 Winter_Olympics . &quot; I sat there watching , and I couldn ' t decide. &quot; Others , however , felt certain that Kerrigan should have been given the advantage because she skated almost flawlessly , while Baiul made at least one significant mistake in a program that was less demanding . Kerrigan landed five triple jumps , two in combination , and Baiul landed four , none in combination . Yet , three judges gave the Ukrainian higher scores for technical merit . &quot; I can ' t explain it at all , &quot; said Paul Wylie , the 1992 Olympic men ' s silver medalist who formerly trained with Kerrigan . &quot; Nancy deserved to win without discussion , &quot; said Didier Gailhauguet , who formerly coached Bonaly . &quot; I thought Kerrigan looked stronger and more solid tonight than ever , &quot; said Frank Carroll , who coaches at Lake Arrowhead ' s Ice Castle International Training Center . &quot; She should have won , definitely. &quot; Even the medals ceremony didn ' t escape the melodrama that has enveloped this sport since Kerrigan was clubbed Jan . 6 . It was held_up a_few minutes because no one could find a recording of Baiul ' s newly independent nation ' s anthem . It was Ukraine ' s first gold medal ever . Kerrigan , 24 , said she did not watch Baiul , who skated immediately after she did . As for her own performance , Kerrigan said she thought immediately afterward that it had earned her a gold medal . &quot; For me , in my mind and my heart , I did , &quot; she said . &quot; I was great. &quot; Just as she was here , Kerrigan was first after the technical program in the 1993 World Championships in Prague . But she had a disastrous freestyle program and finished fifth . When she returned home to Stoneham , Mass. , she began seeing a sports psychologist in an effort to overcome her nerves . That seemed to give her renewed confidence entering this season , but then came the assault on Jan . 6 during the national championships in Detroit that injured her right knee . There was a question for the next three weeks about whether she would even be able to compete here . &quot; What Nancy did , she should be proud_of all her life , &quot; said Linda Leaver , who coached 1988 men ' s champion Brian Boitano . &quot; To put what happened a year ago in Prague out of her mind is almost as difficult as overcoming all_the other stuff. &quot; Baiul , meantime , won the world championship at 15 last year and was in second place after Wednesday night ' s technical program , but , the next afternoon , she was involved in a practice collision with Germany ' s Tanja Szewczenko . Cutting herself with her own skate , Baiul sustained a two-inch long , half-inch gash in her right shin that required three stitches . Doctors also treated her for lower back and shoulder pain . After a shaky practice Friday morning , she was still not certain she would compete . But her training partner , 1992 Olympic men ' s gold medalist Viktor Petrenko , told her : &quot; Many times , I have skated through pain . Now , you must. &quot; Kerrigan , performing to a medley of Neil Diamond songs , was the second in the last group of six competitors to skate , and she seemed tentative at first , turning a planned triple jump into a double . Although she was superb afterward , that might have cost her . &quot; She left an excuse for the judges to mark her down , &quot; Carroll said . Baiul , the next skater on the ice , performed a lively routine set to Broadway show tunes . She double-footed her second triple jump and then left_out the most complicated elements in the middle of her program . But just as it seemed she would have to settle for second place or lower , she inserted a triple jump and a double-axel , double toe-loop combination in the last 10 seconds of her program . It was an astonishing move , for a world-class figure skater who has rehearsed her program hundreds of times to make such monumental changes under pressure . &quot; I remembered time was running_out , and with it time for the gold medal , &quot; she said . Baiul ' s father left home when she was 2 , and her mother died of ovarian cancer when she was 13 . She slept on a cot in her training rink until her coach left for Canada . Her current coach , Galina Zmievskaya , took her on a short time later and turned her into a world champion two years later . &quot; All the troubles I have had have made me strong , &quot; Baiul said Friday night . Asked by reporters if there was anything she wanted now that she has a gold medal , she said , &quot; a Snickers. &quot; * JUDGING IN SPOTLIGHT : Some questioned skating judges for giving Nancy Kerrigan only a silver medal , but Tonya Harding appreciated the decision to allow her to restart .
