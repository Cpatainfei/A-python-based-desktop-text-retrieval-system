   <HEADLINE> INTERVIEW ; HE REALLY can ' t HELP HIMSELF ; SHOCKINGLY ECCENTRIC WRITER-DIRECTOR JOHN WATERS OFFERS YET ANOTHER LOOK_AT THE GRUESOME WITH HIS NEW FILM , ' SERIAL MOM. ' IT STACKS_UP NICELY AGAINST HIS CULT FAVES ' PINK FLAMINGOS ' AND ' MONDO TRASHO '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> John Waters , the eccentric and ascerbic writer-director , stands_in a claustrophobic little guest room upstairs in his sprawling Baltimore mansion , giving a tour and offering impromptu tips on being a sterling host . He looks_on pointedly as a reporter picks_up a book from the night stand titled &quot; How to Care_for Your Gerbil. &quot; &quot; This gets them every time , &quot; he snickers . &quot; My guests start to get a little nervous once they get_a_look at this in their bedroom. &quot; You were expecting cookies and milk from the man who has been dubbed Hollywood ' s Rapscallion of Repulsion ? Waters is back , basking in Hollywood camp and bad taste in his latest film , &quot; Serial Mom , &quot; set to open Friday . It stars Kathleen Turner , Sam Waterston and Suzanne Somers in the story of a suburban mom who is a cheerfully psychotic cross between June Cleaver and Ted Bundy . &quot; Serial Mom &quot; marks the 12th film for Waters , 47 , who first came_to prominence after his 1972 film , &quot; Pink Flamingos , &quot; achieved impressive worldwide grosses in more ways than one . Waters has since served_up such bad-taste classics as &quot; Mondo Trasho &quot; and &quot; Polyester. &quot; His two most recent forays , &quot; Hairspray &quot; and &quot; Cry-Baby , &quot; have attempted to take his humor more mainstream . Waters fields the tough questions with aplomb ; it ' s the niggling details that stump him . &quot; What kind of trees are those in your back yard ? &quot; &quot; I don ' t know . Say they ' re green , &quot; he says . &quot; Who designed your clothes ? &quot; &quot; Say I wore green tennis_shoes and a blue shirt. &quot; In other words , he doesn ' t sweat the small_stuff . * Question : In &quot; Serial Mom , &quot; Kathleen Turner plays a mother with sociopathic tendencies , often expressed in revenge for slights against her family . What fascinates you about psychotic behavior ? Answer : I wish my own mother had done that , basically . But I think everybody wishes that their moms would come_to the rescue . &quot; Serial Mom &quot; is a good mom . I don ' t think_of her at all as a villain of this movie . She ' s the heroine . She sticks_up for her kids , who may happen to have an interest in gore movies , but so what ? She wants her daughter to be happy . She ' s a liberal , good mom . * Q : With just a_few bad habits . . . . A : Well , she means well . She doesn ' t kill out of meanness . She does_it out of really caring_for her family . And once she did_it , it agreed with her . It was like a new set of pearls . * Q : You are equating her penchant for killing to acquiring a new set of pearls ? A : Well , she does_it stylishly . She leaves a signature every time . In one scene , she picks_up a knife and then says to herself : &quot; Oh , everyone does_it with a knife. &quot; There are no guns in this movie . It ' s a gun-control movie . * Q : Tell me about your childhood . You were educated partially by nuns , weren ' t you ? A : Yes . The Daughters of Purgatory . I look_back on them and think that they were the first witches I ever met in my life . * Q : But not the last . A : No . The evilest , though . * Q : How did you know that you had an early fascination with the macabre ? A : Whatever I seemed interested in , my parents went : ' Oh , kid , no ! ' I just knew that it was better to keep my interests to myself . I ' d be playing in the baseball_game , and I would n ' t be paying any attention ; the ball would be at my feet , and people would be running_around bases while I would talk to someone about Dagmar ! She was the first buxom , kind of sexy TV comedienne . I liked her a lot when I was a kid , but I realized that maybe that wasn ' t right . I couldn ' t tell the teacher when they were talking_about sports and stuff that I liked Dagmar . So I learned to have secret interests . Now almost everything I ' m interested in I use for my work . * Q : How has your notoriety changed your life ? A : Well , fame is protection if you go_to a scary place . Fame is fun . A lot of people don ' t say anything and you don ' t know they know who you are . But then later they say something that makes me realize that it ' s a good thing I was_on good behavior . * Q : But at that moment , don ' t you wonder if you really were_on good behavior ? A : Yeah . But I figure , so what if I wasn ' t ? It ' s not like I make Disney movies . It ' s not like I ' ve got a morals clause in my contract with Savoy . I had one with &quot; Polyester. &quot; New Line had just never taken it out from the standard thing . So I called New Line , because it said that I couldn ' t make a movie that would offend the community . I said : &quot; Are you kidding ? that ' s what you pay me to do ! &quot; * Q : What led you to cast Turner as the psycho mom ? A : When this film was with other studios , we did not have the budget to hire Kathleen . But when we did , she was my No . 1 choice , believe me . She ' s delightfully wicked . * Q : I only met her once , and she had the firmest handshake in the world . A : Well , she ' s a physical woman . She does her stunts a lot . Kathleen is not one to shrink away from doing anything . She had to duck with knives being thrown . * Q : You ' re known for your eclectic casting . Who else would you like to work with ? A : I ' d like Sharon Stone . Meryl Streep . Really the big_wheels . I ' d work with Johnny Depp again in a minute . I think &quot; Cry-Baby &quot; probably reached the zenith in terms of casting with Joey Heatherton , Iggy Pop and Patty Hearst . * Q : Would you ever consider directing a film from another writer ' s script or conception ? A : I have no interest in ever making a movie I didn ' t write . If they were going_to take my house away , then I guess I might have to . But my agent knows not to even bother sending me the scripts . The fun of it is thinking it up . Then , when I direct it , I ' ve been living with these people for a long_time in my head , so I get_to bring them out on the screen . * Q : I watched &quot; Pink Flamingos &quot; the other night . A : Oh , I haven ' t seen that one for 10 years . It still delivers . It still gets arrested in places ! * Q : Are you surprised that after all this time , the film still holds_up in the shock department ? A : Yeah . I ' m proud_of it . It ' s like having a serial_killer movie . It still works . It still gets threatened with film jail . But on video , it has problems . Where are you going_to put it ? If you put it in the X-rated , people don ' t want to find it . * Q : You ' ll be happy to know that you have your own section in West Hollywood video stores . A : ( Laughter. ) that ' s great . Well , West Hollywood ain ' t Omaha , believe me ! It doesn ' t get busted in West Hollywood . It gets stolen in West Hollywood ! * Q : How has filmmaking changed for you from those early days ? Obviously , the budgets have changed , but has your actual approach ? A : It ' s exactly the same in some ways in that I ' m very serious about making my comedies . Hollywood , at least , knows about me by now . I come_in on budget . I make the exact movie I tell ' em I ' m gonna make . * Q : You have a reputation for being quite meticulous , and although your films look somewhat improvisational , you don ' t like your actors to ad-lib . A : No , we don ' t ever ad-lib much . But we do have rehearsal . We rehearsed &quot; Serial Mom &quot; right here in this living room . Kathleen , Sam ( Waterston ) -- all_of them . That is where I see that perhaps the lines I ' ve written don ' t work and if Kathleen or Sam had an idea , I ' d listen and change it . * Q : What was the budget on &quot; Pink Flamingos &quot; ? A : $ 10 # 000 . I thought I had a lot to work with . I had $ 5 # 000 with &quot; Multiple Maniacs. &quot; It ' s been 30 years since 1964 ' s &quot; Hag in a Black Leather Jacket , &quot; which really cost no money because the leading lady stole the film . * Q : She actually stole the film ? A : Yeah . And the developing . * Q : You once said Laundromats have_the_best lighting . Is that still true for you ? A : No . That was when we had no money for lights . I actually hate fluorescent lighting -- but you know , the coolest bars in Berlin have that on purpose only because the people there are so young and cute that they want it to be bright . It keeps old people out . What do they care ? They look great and they ' re 18 . * Q : Some critics have carped that now you ' re mainstream and that you ' ve lost your edge . A : They say that every time . They said that with &quot; Female Trouble &quot; -- everything after &quot; Pink Flamingos. &quot; that ' s the only thing that sometimes makes me . . . that is a little unfair , and that ' s when they go_back and say : &quot; Oh , this one doesn ' t have the rawness and energy of ' Pink Flamingos. ' &quot; And I remember : They hated &quot; Pink Flamingos. &quot; I have the clippings ! I ' m not trying to be as raw . Definitely I ' m trying to make a hit Hollywood movie . I have unapologetically been trying to make a Hollywood movie . I have unapologetically been trying to make a Hollywood hit movie with the last three movies . One was ( &quot; Hairspray &quot; ) ; one wasn ' t ( &quot; Cry-Baby &quot; ) . * Q : Why is having a hit film so important ? A : It ' s the only challenge I have left . They don ' t have cult movies anymore . There ' s no such thing as midnight movies . It would be foolish to try to make a cult movie -- where would it play ? What movie has caused a sensation on video , except &quot; Faces of Death &quot; ? Hollywood makes all kinds of movies now . Only in the last five or six years has it been possible for me to make Hollywood movies . I never even asked before . I made independent movies . It ' s the same strain and the same trouble as before , only you make more money . I don ' t know how to do anything else . I don ' t know any other job that I could really get . * Q : Well , what would you do ? A : I could work in a bookstore again . I was good at that . * Q : What sort of bookstore ? A : Oh , a good one . A very good one . * Q : Is there anyone that you would not cast in your movies ? A : Well , there are people that I would n ' t have bad taste-wise . I would n ' t put Heidi Fleiss in one of my movies . I would n ' t put Zsa Zsa Gabor in one of my movies . There are people who are bad , bad taste who aren ' t witty or funny . I only put people I really respect in my movies . * Q : Who ' s turned you down ? A : Stockard Channing for &quot; Hairspray. &quot; And who ' s the one who wears the dirty makeup ? Mamie Van Doren . She said that she deserved better than Divine . And Lisa Marie Presley . I have her book upstairs , called &quot; My Dad. &quot; * Q : that ' s not her book . It ' s unauthorized . She ' d never write a book about Elvis . Not in a_million years . A : Well , I ' m sure she didn ' t write it . I ' m a fan of hers . She looks_like the prettiest girl in Baltimore ( grins widely ) . * Q : After 12 movies set here , would you ever make a movie anyplace else ? A : I think it would be asking_for bad_luck . Certainly many of the people I work with behind the scenes live here . I filmed parts of the re-shoots for &quot; Cry-Baby &quot; in L.A. ; it ' s not as if I would have a nervous_breakdown if I had to do_it . The amusement_park in &quot; Hairspray &quot; was in Pennsylvania . But it would be difficult for me to write a movie somewhere else . that ' s why I need to be here . I need to be cut_off from things . It ' s also great to be able to drive_around and spy on people , which I do when I ' m writing . You ' d be surprised . People tell me the most personal things about their lives for no reason -- on airplanes , everywhere I go . People just blurt_out secrets . I ' m not sure why . I think that they see in my films that nothing will make me uptight . I ' m not going_to judge them . * Q : Now that it ' s wrapped , how do you feel about &quot; Serial Mom &quot; ? A : I think it ' s my best movie , actually . But you can ' t tell that until a couple years after . Certainly if I drop_dead tomorrow , my obituary in the Los Angeles Times will say : &quot; ' Pink Flamingos ' and ' Hairspray. ' &quot; * Q : The sad irony of Divine ' s death just as rave reviews for &quot; Hairspray &quot; were coming_in must have been a tremendous blow to you . A : Yeah . I hope nobody dies when this one opens . * Q : Was it difficult for you at first to continue on as a filmmaker without one of your principal sources of inspiration ? A : Yes . that ' s why with &quot; Cry-baby &quot; I made a movie about a man . But I certainly never thought I couldn ' t make a film without Divine . I ' ll be honest with you : I made &quot; Desperate Living &quot; without Divine , so I ' d already made a movie without Divine . But I missed him on the set . I always had to fight to use Divine in my movies . Nobody ever wanted me to . And now he would have been so mad that a heterosexual drag queen ( Robin Williams as Mrs . Doubtfire ) had the No . 1 movie in America . He would have felt gypped . If you have a wife , they love you in drag . If you don ' t : kinky ! * Q : Patricia Hearst is in &quot; Serial Mom , &quot; playing a key juror in the trial of Turner ' s character . You have admitted that you had been obsessed with her . A : Well , I was . I was obsessed with her trial , which made her nervous . But she didn ' t know that when I was at her trial . That was the hardest trial to get_into since the ( Charles ) Lindbergh baby . People waited three days in sleeping bags and stuff . I waited 12 hours , easy . * Q : What did you think_of her then ? And was that how she really was when you actually met her ? A : The Paul Schrader movie called &quot; Patty Hearst &quot; changed my mind about everything . Patricia has said to me : &quot; It ' s because of people like you that I went_to jail , because you wanted me to be something that I was not ! &quot; And she ' s right . We wanted her to be this bad-girl heiress when really she was brainwashed and a horrible thing happened to her . She was sitting at_home doing her homework . But we didn ' t want to hear about that . So we made her into this together thing that really she was not . * Q : On a somewhat related matter , I understand that you advocate having convicted Manson follower Leslie Van Houten released from prison . A : Well , if I ' m talking_about this for the Los Angeles Times , I have to clarify that : Los Angeles is the place where it happened . I know it is a very delicate situation . Leslie is a friend of mine . I ' m not talking_about anyone else in the &quot; family. &quot; I met her in 1983 when I was interested in interviewing her for a possible story for Rolling Stone . We became friends , so I didn ' t write an article about her . I believe_in rehabilitation . If you believe_in rehabilitation , Leslie is rehabilitated . The psychiatrist at the prison says : &quot; She shouldn ' t even have to see me. &quot; The parole board knows she ' s rehabilitated . I believe she deserves a second chance . I am not saying any of this for shock value . What she did was horrible ; I ' m not saying it wasn ' t . She isn ' t either . She ' s been in jail some 20-some years . She is paying_for it . At the same time , I ' ve made a movie that ' s a comedy about a serial_killer . that ' s a very , very different thing . I want to keep those two issues separate . I told Leslie I was making this movie just so that she would not think it was about her or about my experience with her . * Q : What ' s your perspective on the Menendez case ? A : Well , that was certainly an interesting case , especially now , because everybody has doubts . There are also some wild inconsistencies and they never say they did_it . It ' s never as interesting if they admit guilt . * Q : Well , they admit they did_it but contend that it was in fear for their lives . A : But they don ' t admit the guilt ! They have reason , blah , blah , blah . What I ' m saying is that is why it is the A-list trial in America . Suzanne Somers was offered the part of Kitty Menendez in a TV movie . She called me roaring to tell me . I said : &quot; You should take it ! I ' d love that ! &quot; * Q : Are you a romantic ? A : Valentine ' s Day is my mother ' s birthday . If I ' m wildly in_love , I ' ve sent people chicken hearts , which seems to appeal_to the kind of person that I ' ve been in_love with . But no one got a chicken heart from me this year . It ' s an off year . I ' m only in like . I just received a very funny card from a friend of mine . Have you seen these new cards where you open it up and you can record anything you want for the greeting ? His said : &quot; I hate you ! &quot; I bet they just made a fortune because everyone must be saying : &quot; ( expletive ) you ! &quot; You can really abuse what they thought this up for , which I think is great . * Q : Is it safe to assume that you are out of the closet ? A : Oh , sure . I ' ve always been out . I ' ve never said I wasn ' t gay , but people never have the nerve to ask me . * Q : What do you think_about fellow gay filmmakers who are not out ? A : that ' s their business . * Q : You couldn ' t care less ? A : I care . I ' m certainly not going_to tell other people what they should do with their own personal lives . I think it ' s certainly easier for a director to be out . What difference does that make ? The public is not going_to see a movie because the director is gay or straight . It ' s maybe a little harder for an actor or actress because of , you know , the love roles and stuff . But gay people have been impersonating heteros in the movies for years , and this year a straight_person -- Tom Hanks -- won an Oscar for playing a gay person . So , hopefully , that is becoming less of an issue . I think it would have been really great if a gay person had played a gay person . that ' s brave ! I think Tom Hanks was great in &quot; Philadelphia , &quot; but the Baltimore Sun came_to me and asked : &quot; Didn ' t you think he was brave ? &quot; I said : &quot; Brave ? No -- he ' s a known heterosexual . It ' s a great stretch , and he ' ll win an Oscar . What ' s brave about it ? &quot; I ' m a film director . Gay is an adjective that I certainly am , but I don ' t know that it ' s my first one . I think if you ' re just a gay filmmaker , you get pigeonholed just like if you say I ' m a black filmmaker , I ' m a Spanish filmmaker , I ' m a whatever . * Q : What would surprise people about John Waters ? What is your one dirty little secret ? A : ( Silence . ) I once voted Republican . For President Ford . I still like him . I like the whole family . that ' s why I voted for him . Once . * Q : Is there one theme in your films ? A : There is an overall thread , and it ' s always that outsiders win and people that are comfortable with their insanity and are not bitter . And the losers are always the people who are uncomfortable with their own insanity and complain and are bitter and try to take it out on others . &quot; Serial Mom &quot; is comfortable with what she does . She is not_guilty . She is doing what she thinks is best . I do too . * Q : In your book &quot; Crackpot , &quot; you include among your favorite Hollywood things Frederick ' s of Hollywood , Pia Zadora and the National Enquirer . Do you have any new discoveries that make Hollywood special for you ? A : Well , I was there a day after the earthquake . So I experienced all_of the aftershocks . I admit I went ghouling around to look_at earthquake damage . And when I was in Santa Monica , I saw a beauty_parlor that had been hit and the front had the plywood on it . Spray-painted on the front was : &quot; Alive and Still Doing Hair ! &quot; * Q : What ' s the last book you read ? A : ( Putting_on a thick Southern drawl ) &quot; M-y-y S-o-n ! &quot; ( actually called &quot; A Father ' s Story &quot; ) by Jeffrey Dahmer ' s father . I ' m very interested in the families of the people who did something horrible . It is an incredible trauma for them also . It ' s a scary story . People threw eggs at their house , and he had to go_back to work . He said that some of his co-workers said : &quot; I don ' t know what I could possibly say to you. &quot; Some would offer help , and some would act like nothing had happened . Imagine ! Your son is Jeffrey Dahmer , and your friend says : &quot; Hi ! Have you been_on vacation ? &quot; It ' s the infamy of crime which has really always fascinated me . Much more_than the crime itself . that ' s what &quot; Serial Mom &quot; is about . Reading the Dahmer book was very relaxing . It was snowing out ; I stayed home all day and read it cover to cover . ( Smiles , then pauses. ) It was a perfect Sunday . * Q : May I see the rest of the house ? I see you have an electric_chair in your hall . A : ( With much pride ) Yes . . . . Oh , Gawd . I feel_like Jackie Kennedy giving a tour of the White_House . * John Waters will speak at a special screening of &quot; Serial Mom &quot; at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Laemmle Monica Theatre , 1332 2nd St. , Santa Monica , in an Independent Feature Project / West discussion moderated by Quentin Tarantino . For reservations and information , call IFP / West , ( 310 ) 392-8832 .</TEXT>
