   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : VENTURA ; TRASH PRECAUTIONS IN MEDFLY AREA URGED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Homeowners in Ventura County ' s Medfly quarantine area are being encouraged to double bag their garbage , particularly if it contains clippings from fruit_trees or produce , federal agricultural officials said Friday . Doug Hendrix , a spokesman for the state and federal Cooperative Medfly Project , said the double bagging is a precaution against the Mediterranean_fruit_fly spreading to another part of the county while the trash is being transported.Officials at Bailard Landfill turned_away one load of trash about two weeks ago , because it contained trimmings from a lemon_tree within the 86 square-mile quarantine area . The landfill in Oxnard had been ordered to inspect and reject trash loads that came from individual property_owners and contained citrus from the quarantine area . Those loads were then diverted to the landfill in Simi Valley . However , on Thursday , state agricultural officials lifted the restrictions on Bailard . The Oxnard landfill will no longer have to inspect loads from private individuals , and can accept all trash from the Camarillo area . &quot; I suspect they ' ve decided it doesn ' t pose as much of a hazard as they thought initially , &quot; said John Conaway , director of solid waste for the Ventura Regional Sanitation District , which operates the Bailard Landfill . Gary Haden , the district ' s director of operations , said there was little risk of the fruit_fly spawning if it were to arrive_at the landfill . &quot; Once a load comes_in , it hits the ground and is buried within a_few minutes and covered at the end of the day with dirt , &quot; he said . Trash picked_up by commercial haulers is considered less of a risk for transporting the Medfly because the garbage is compressed inside a container . JULIE FIELDS</TEXT>
