   <HEADLINE> STAR SEARCH ; ASTRONOMY : THE CLEAR VIEW FROM 8 # 200-FOOT MT . PINOS LURES HUNDREDS WHO GAZE SKYWARD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Beyond the big-city lights , the stars stand_out in the darkened sky , the smoke-like expanse of the Milky Way emerges , and you can imagine what it must be like up there in the heavens . As_many as 250 amateur astronomers go_to the top of Mt . Pinos near Frazier Park on moonless nights for ideal stargazing . Most go_for other reasons as well , like the magic of capturing a planet , or a star , or some whole galaxy , in the lens of their telescope . &quot; We ' re seeing things in the universe that the average man never sees , &quot; Amos Almeida , a 50-year-old Moorpark truck_driver , said one recent Saturday night . &quot; When you look_at galaxies , you see billions of stars millions of light-years away , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s no doubt in my mind that God didn ' t just create all that for us humans . When I ' m looking_out there , I ' m imagining someone else looking back. &quot; At 8 # 200 feet , the packed parking_lot where Almeida set_up his telescope is considered one of the best places in Southern California for stargazing . Amateur astronomers have been using the site for more_than 30 years . Far beyond the light pollution that can take the luster off the night sky , astronomers such_as Almeida can set_up their telescopes and -- barring cloud_cover -- be guaranteed ideal conditions . &quot; I ' m up here almost every weekend there ' s not a moon , &quot; said Almeida , who spent close to $ 10 # 000 on a new 10-foot-tall telescope with a 25-inch refractor . After spending so_much on telescopes , the die-hards who come here spend countless hours searching for obscure clusters of stars or glowing wafts of hydrogen gas clouds called nebulae , where stars are born . Dressed warmly for the crisp evening , Harvey Freed , a 53-year-old dentist from Los Angeles , kneels before his telescope , programming a small computer to track a star in the sky . He is one of several dozen amateur astrophotographers setting_up cameras mounted on telescopes to take pictures of galaxies and nebulae trillions of miles away . Because the light from these distant celestial_bodies is so faint , a typical photograph can take_up to three hours to make . The computer that Freed is programming will track the star and , accounting_for the Earth ' s rotation , keep the camera focused_on the image as the film is exposed . The irony of his meticulous work is that Freed spends more time looking down at his machine than looking_up at the stars . But it is his fascination with those stars that keeps him tinkering . &quot; I like to shoot galaxies and planetary_nebulae that are so far away you can hardly imagine , &quot; he said . &quot; To think we can capture them in the camera is amazing . For me , it ' s like hunting . Our pictures are our trophies. &quot; If there is one thing that astronomers such_as Freed want to share , it is their fascination with the universe . Almost like carnival barkers , they stand next to their telescopes and offer the uninitiated a chance to see the stars up close . Philo Jewett , 40 , of Studio City swings his telescope around , picking_out what might interest a beginner . He points the telescope up_to Jupiter , tells a stranger about the impacts of meteors from the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 , whose effects are still visible , and reminds them to look_for Jupiter ' s moons . A photographer by trade , Jewett spends many nights on the streets of Studio City with his telescope , offering views of the moon or planets for $ 1 to passersby . &quot; I ' m a sidewalk astronomer , &quot; he said . &quot; I read once in a science magazine that one person out of 100 has never looked through a telescope . I think that gave me a mission in life. &quot; He once let a 75-year-old woman gaze at Saturn and its rings . &quot; She said , ' There really are rings ! ' Imagine that , she was surprised to really see rings on Saturn , &quot; Jewett said . Not far from Jewett , young people lined_up at Almeida ' s telescope , hoping to get a glimpse of the Ring Nebula , which looks much like a perfect smoke ring . Terry Murphy , a 37-year-old friend of Almeida who lives_in Thousand Oaks and works as an engineer for Rocketdyne , explained why he tries to encourage people to take_a_look . &quot; The first time I looked through a telescope , I was 9 . It was a darkened night and I saw Jupiter . It changed my life , &quot; he said . After studying astrophysics and engineering in college , he ended_up working_on rockets used in the space shuttle . &quot; When I see a novice catch_a_glimpse for the first time , it ' s like I ' m reliving that experience , &quot; he said . &quot; Maybe it will change their lives. &quot; Hal Jandorf , 45 , who teaches astronomy at Moorpark College , agreed . &quot; It ' s why I teach , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s incredible to see someone get caught_up in the magic of seeing stars. &quot; Jandorf was conducting an introductory course for a group from the Los Angeles Natural_History Museum . After a short orientation , he led them down the mountain a_few hundred yards from the light-sensitive telescopes , then flicked on a large flashlight to point_out the constellations . With his flashlight beam , Jandorf connected the dots that form Scorpio and Sagittarius . As the constellations seemed to jump_out from the star-speckled sky , the group oohed and ahhed . &quot; You can see why it ' s so addicting , &quot; said Karen Veronico , 56 , of West Los Angeles , who was wearing a &quot; University of Mars &quot; T-shirt and tilting her head skyward . Veronico and her husband have already bought a $ 2 # 500 telescope . She said they liked the camaraderie among the astronomers on Mt . Pinos and would return . &quot; There aren ' t any astronomy snobs up here , &quot; she said . &quot; Everybody is willing to let you look through their telescopes and explain what you ' re seeing. &quot; Except for angry yells when someone drives into the parking_lot with headlights on -- which can destroy hours of work by the astrophotographers -- the astronomers welcome strangers . Among the cars and camper vans pasted with bumper stickers -- reading &quot; Astronomy is looking_up &quot; and &quot; Let the stars get_in your eyes &quot; -- people gathered_in small groups to talk . Someone played the theme to &quot; 2001 : A Space Odyssey. &quot; Two college_students from Los Angeles laid_out beanbag chairs next to their car and leaned_back to look_at the sky . The atmosphere is something akin to a huge cocktail_party . The group around Almeida ' s telescope grew a little bit larger . Sensing the wait he faced , one young_man started to leave . &quot; Wait a minute , &quot; Almeida said . &quot; You ' re gonna want to look_at this . This is something you ' ve never seen before. &quot;</TEXT>
