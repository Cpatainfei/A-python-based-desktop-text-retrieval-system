   <HEADLINE> SUNDAY BRIEFING ; AN OCCASIONAL LOOK_AT ORANGE COUNTY ISSUES ; HOW SAN ONOFRE GENERATES POWER ; ENERGY PRODUCED BY THE SAN ONOFRE NUCLEAR GENERATING STATION TOUCHES THE NEARLY 15 MILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE SOUTHLAND . THE TWO-UNIT PLANT CONTRIBUTES 18 % OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ' S ENERGY MIX . ADVANTAGES OF THE PLANT ' S CONTRIBUTION ARE TEMPERED BY THEIR VERY SOURCE -- ATOMIC ENERGY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Inside the Nuclear Reactor The heart of San Onofre is its nuclear_reactor . It can produce vast amounts of energy from a small amount of fuel . How it ' s done : 1 . Uranium atoms split ( fission ) inside fuel rods ; occurs trillions of times per second , creating heat . 2 . Water circulating inside reactor core is heated to more_than 600 degrees Fahrenheit . 3 . Hot water passes_through pipes into boiler and is converted to steam . Remaining water is pumped back to reactor to be reheated ; cycle repeats . 4 . Steam spins a turbine , which drives an electric generator . 5 . Ocean water , pumped in from a separate pipeline , cools steam and turns it back into water . Ocean water is returned to sea . 6 . Cooled water from condensed steam pumped back into boiler for reuse . * Not drawn to scale ; only a portion of reactor is shown . How High-Level Radioactive Waste Is Stored Nuclear fission results in low- and high-level radioactive waste . Low-level waste ( worker clothing and tools , etc. ) is shipped to licensed disposal sites in Nevada and Washington . High-level waste is stored at San Onofre . * Pools : Steel-lined concrete structures 45 feet deep High-level waste : Clusters of used fuel rods stacked in pools by machine Water : Fuel rods submerged into pools with at least 23 feet covering them ; water cools used fuel rods , acts_as protective shield for workers Multiple Safeguards Uranium , the fuel used to produce nuclear_energy , is naturally radioactive . San Onofre uses several physical barriers to prevent escape of radioactive materials . * Fuel pellets : 1 / 3-inch-diameter uranium pellets lock_in radioactive by-products after fission Fuel rods : 12-foot stainless_steel or metal tubes encase uranium pellets Reactor vessel : Fuel rods placed in 8-inch-thick carbon_steel vessel Steel containment : Vessel enclosed by leak-proof steel-plate shell Containment structure : Airtight , 4 1 / 2-foot-thick reinforced-concrete walls and 11-foot-thick concrete floor , houses reactor vessel and all equipment in direct contact with it Plant Particulars * Ownership : Primarily Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric ; cities of Anaheim and Riverside own less than 5 % of Units 2 and 3 * On line : Unit 1 began producing power Jan . 1 , 1968 . and shut_down Nov . 30 , 1992 ; Units 2 and 3 began operating in August , 1983 , and April , 1984 , respectively . * Construction cost : Unit 1 : $ 88 million . Units 2 and 3 : $ 4.5 billion total * Current status : Units 2 and 3 operating with a capacity to serve 2.75 million households * Employees : 2 # 500-3 # 000 * Employee requirements : Security screening and psychological profiles , physical exams every two years ; operators receive additional training and licensing by Nuclear Regulatory Commission . * Annual payroll : $ 120 million * Annual expenditures : $ 250 million , including property_taxes , salaries and operating and maintenance expenses Edison ' s Energy Mix In 10 years , nuclear_power has gone from being Edison ' s least-used energy resource to being the third-largest . A Edison ' s sources : 1983 Other utilities : 40 % Gas : 33 Coal : 15 Hydro : 10 Non-utility energy : 1 Nuclear : 1 1993 Non-utility energy : 34 % Gas : 23 Nuclear : 18 Coal : 13 Hydro : 7 Other utilities : 5 2003 Nonutility energy : 31 % Gas : 24 Nuclear : 16 Other utilities : 13 Coal : 11 Hydro : 5 Price Comparisons Average_cost of different energy sources per kilowatt_hour in 1993 : Source : Cost Oil : 7.996 Gas : 2.930 Coal : 1.226 Nuclear : 0.537 San Onofre ' s Future The California Public_Utilities Commission ' s Division of Ratepayer Advocates has recommended that San Onofre be shut by 1998 , 15 years ahead of schedule , on the grounds that it is too expensive to operate . Two public hearings before an administrative_law judge were held_in June . Judge will submit a report to the PUC , which is expected to decide the question later this year . * Opponents : Say it would be cheaper to shut San Onofre and use alternate energy sources like solar_power and natural_gas . ( Proponents say San Onofre is cost-effective and will save its ratepayers at least $ 1 billion if allowed to operate through 2013. ) * Proponents : Believe plant infuses $ 250 million in annual revenue into surrounding communities and closure would further deflate an already sagging economy . ( Opponents say the nuclear_power industry is dead in this country and producing electricity through renewable resources will increase the number of local jobs tenfold. ) Thumbs Up , Thumbs Down Advantages of nuclear_power have long been weighed against health , safety and environmental concerns . Some pros and cons of nuclear_energy : ( Graphic : Pro ) * Economics : One pound of nuclear fuel releases as much energy as does combustion of three million pounds of coal . ( Graphic : Con ) * By-products : Uranium produces radiation long after its use as a fuel for nuclear_energy . Safe way to store uranium waste permanently has not been perfected . Nuclear Report_Card Throughout each year , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission evaluates plant operations at San Onofre and other nuclear plants . The evaluation rates the plant on a scale of 1 to 3 -- with 1 being best -- in several categories , including plant operations and maintenance . In the past five reports , San Onofre has consistently rated above average . * 1987-88 : 1.71 1988-90 : 1.43 1990-91 : 1.57 1991-92 : 1.43 1992-94 : 1.50 Average Radiation Doses Exposure to radiation is a fact of everyday life . Most Americans receive about 300 millirem per year . A millirem is a small unit of radiation . It would take a dose of 50 # 000 millirem in one day to produce flu-like symptoms . Some common radiation exposures : * Source : Millirem Chest X-ray : 10 per X-ray Dental X-ray : 130 per full set High-voltage color_TV * : 0.03 per year Wrist_watch : 0.03 per year Smoke detector : 0.03 per year Airplane trip from Los Angeles to London : 4 per round_trip * Depending_on age of set , distance from viewer Power Load The percentage of time San Onofre ' s two reactors are operating at full capacity has increased dramatically . Levels are higher if mandated shutdowns for maintenance and the_like are discounted : * Unit 2 8 / 88-7 / 90 : 75.5 % 7 / 90-3 / 92 : 73.6 % 3 / 92-12 / 93 : 85.4 % 12 / 93-present : 99.5 % Unit 3 8 / 88-7 / 90 : 81.2 % 7 / 90-3 / 92 : 85.2 % 3 / 92-12 / 93 : 81.4 % 12 / 93-present : 97.3 % If the Sirens Sound If an emergency occurs at San Onofre , long , steady sirens will sound for three to five minutes . If you hear an alert : * Keep calm : Sirens sound in time to react cautiously . * Tune_in : Listen to local radio or TV_station for news and instructions . * Neighbor check : Make_sure neighbors heard the sirens and know what to do . * Avoid calls : Do not use the telephone unless absolutely necessary . Emergency workers need lines . Do not dial 911 except to report an immediate life-threatening emergency . * Indoor shelter : If advised to stay inside , close all doors and windows and shut_off all systems that draw outside air into building . Keep pets inside if possible . * Evacuation : If advised to evacuate , leave the area promptly after turning_off lights , appliances and water , locking windows and doors , and taking enough necessary personal items to last several days . Close all vents and windows in vehicle and do not use air-conditioner . * Family : Do not attempt to pick_up or call children or family at schools , hospitals and the_like . Public facilities follow their own emergency_procedures . Glossary Background_radiation : Radiation occuring naturally in the environment through light , heat and radio_waves . Chain_reaction : Continuous , self-sustaining series of fission reactions in a mass of uranium . Fission : To split or break an atom into two new atoms or fragments . Releases energy and produces heat used to boil water and make steam in steam generator . Half-life : Time required for half the atoms of a radioactive substance to decay into another substance . Kilowatt : A unit of power equal_to 1 # 000 watts . Megawatt : A unit of power equal_to 1 million watts . Nuclear radiation : High-energy particles and rays given_off during a nuclear_reaction .
