( &quot; ( He ) spent most of the rest of his life in an insane_asylum ... &quot; ) .Let the Associated Press ' Scott Williams and John Larroquette know that Roky -- institutionalized or not , at this point -- is alive and was still releasing records as recently as 1988 . Veronica Moore , Los Angeles Hollywood ' s Big Night I would like to thank television_news , the media , the newspapers and radio for making Oscar night absolutely predictable , with no surprises whatsoever . There is so_much hype and so_much talk for so_long before the big night that even if you were living_in Siberia , you would know who the winners would be . Toni Jacobson , Monterey Park Whoopi Goldberg deserves an Oscar for her performance as emcee during the Academy Awards . She was funny , good-natured and , most importantly , kept the show at a good pace . I look_forward to seeing her recast next year . Amanda Q . Madison , Beverly Hills</TEXT>
