   <HEADLINE> U.S. , N . KOREA TO REOPEN TALKS ; ASIA : WASHINGTON WILL PUT SANCTIONS DRIVE ON HOLD IN RETURN FOR PYONGYANG ' S SUSPENSION OF NUCLEAR PROGRAM . ACCORD IS ' OPPORTUNITY TO FIND A SOLUTION , ' CLINTON SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States and North_Korea took a major step away from crisis on Wednesday , with the Clinton_Administration agreeing to reopen direct negotiations and suspend its drive for sanctions in return for North_Korea ' s pledge to freeze its nuclear program and allow international monitoring of its reactor . The accord is the &quot; beginning of a new stage in our efforts to pursue a non-nuclear Korean_Peninsula , &quot; President Clinton said , announcing the talks ' reopening . &quot; These developments mark not a solution to the problem , but they do mark a new opportunity to find a solution. &quot; Wednesday ' s announcement firmed_up an offer that North_Korean leader Kim Il Sung made to former President Jimmy_Carter during his visit to Pyongyang last week . White_House officials had expressed caution about Carter ' s announcement that North_Korea would freeze its nuclear program and had insisted on seeing the pledge in writing directly from the Pyongyang government . Under the terms , the North_Koreans pledged not to place any new fuel in their nuclear_reactor or to begin reprocessing of fuel rods withdrawn from the reactor last month . Reprocessing would free plutonium that could be fashioned into nuclear bombs . The freeze would last until the completion of the new round of talks , expected to begin early next month in Geneva . The North_Koreans also agreed to allow continued international inspections and monitoring of their facilities , which American officials say will allow the freeze to be verified . But the agreement does not resolve the issue of North_Korea ' s past nuclear-related actions . The CIA believes North_Korea has acquired enough plutonium , diverted from its reactor in 1989 , to make one or two nuclear_weapons , although North_Korea has never conducted a nuclear test . The new talks will let American officials answer a critical question -- whether Kim ' s regime has pursued a nuclear program to build an arsenal at any cost or whether the program is a bargaining_chip to be traded away in return for international recognition and economic aid . The broad outlines of a possible deal in Geneva are already clear . The United States wants North_Korea to relinquish its capability to make nuclear_weapons . In exchange , North_Korea would like diplomatic relations , economic help , new technology for peaceful nuclear_power and some form of security guarantees from the United States . Carter , in an interview on Cable News Network , hailed the possibility of such a deal , saying &quot; this was one of those perfect agreements where both sides won. &quot; But pessimists in the longstanding debate over North_Korea believe the negotiations will end in frustration , as past rounds have . Even as the White_House celebrated a rare piece of foreign_policy good news , others were quick to denounce the new agreement . Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , for example , asserted that the Administration had agreed to &quot; throw_in_the_towel &quot; by reopening talks . &quot; There is no basis in history or experience to believe more talk and more delay will limit North_Korea ' s nuclear ambitions , &quot; Dole said in a statement . The pessimistic view is that , after a delay of a_few months , the United States and its allies may once again be forced to discuss some form of collective action against North_Korea ; Pyongyang , meantime , will have bought more time to develop its program . Those in the cynical camp have long argued that North_Korea has no intention of giving_up its nuclear program . They contend that Kim wants weapons for their own sake -- to ensure his regime ' s survival and , perhaps , to help achieve the long-cherished goal of reunifying the Korean_Peninsula by force . That would be the only means of overcoming South_Korea ' s huge and embarrassing victory over North_Korea in the economic sphere . The top priority for American officials in the talks will be to see if North_Korea will agree to make its program freeze permanent and verifiable -- effectively putting an end to the threat that the North will begin to develop a full arsenal of nuclear_weapons . One element of an agreement would be American assistance for North_Korea ' s stated desire to obtain a new , light-water nuclear_reactor to replace its graphite reactor . Graphite reactors breed a ready source of plutonium that can be diverted to weapons , while light-water reactors do not . If the program can be capped , American officials would then turn_back to the issue that until recently had dominated U.S.-Korean tensions -- whether North_Korea already has weapons . Until Carter ' s visit to Pyongyang , the Administration had insisted that tracking North_Korea ' s past behavior would be a precondition for new talks . Last month ' s removal of fuel rods from the reactor destroyed the most readily available evidence of the amount of plutonium that may have been diverted . The only way now to determine what occurred is through &quot; special inspections &quot; of sites where nuclear material may have been stored or dumped . In their letter , delivered to American officials Wednesday afternoon , the North_Koreans pledged , &quot; in the context of an overall solution , that they will fully implement the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) safeguards , &quot; a senior Administration official told reporters . U.S. officials interpret that to mean an agreement to abide_by special inspections . But the official conceded that the Administration cannot be sure North_Korea meant that . Until now , the North_Koreans have steadfastly refused to allow special inspections . Wednesday ' s announcement capped a period in which the United States and North_Korea seemed to be moving inexorably toward a military confrontation . Tensions mounted rapidly after the removal of the fuel rods and the Administration announcement that it would pursue sanctions . North_Korea has warned repeatedly that it would regard sanctions as an act of war . It is possible this escalation may have caused Kim -- who ordinarily leaves day-to-day management of North_Korean affairs to his son , Kim Jong Il -- to use the Carter visit as a chance to turn_around the policies of the North_Korean regime . Washington specialists who follow the North_Korean press say there are signs that the elder Kim , 82 , may have improvised during the Carter visit , doing things not part of the regime ' s original game_plan . Carter said Wednesday that lower-level North_Korean officials seemed surprised by the amount_of_time Kim spent with him and the pledges he made . Alternatively , some analysts suggest , there was no turnaround , and Kim planned this all along . North_Korea is famous for what American policy-makers call &quot; salami tactics &quot; in negotiations -- cutting issues in thin slices and repeatedly adding new conditions that can later be given_up in exchange for concessions from the other side .</TEXT>
