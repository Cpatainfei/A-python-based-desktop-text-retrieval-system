   <HEADLINE> BUS_LINE REACHES FOR THE SKY ; GREYHOUND REVAMPING SERVICE IN A BID FOR SHORT-HAUL FLIERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Greyhound Lines wants more_than ever for you to leave the driving to them . The only nationwide bus_service this week launched an effort to lure more people out of their cars and away from airports and train_stations by lowering ticket prices and adding departures on short-haul routes in Southern California and other markets . The strategy aims particularly to gain passengers from rival carriers such_as Southwest Airlines and Reno Air . But it will take significant improvements in customer service to induce many_more travelers to go Greyhound , analysts and passengers said Friday . &quot; The service would have to be much improved &quot; to get him to travel Greyhound more often , South Gate truck_driver Theatis Sutton said Friday , after waiting in_line at the Greyhound terminal in downtown Los Angeles for 45 minutes even though he had a prepaid ticket . He said he usually flies and was taking the bus only because his employer required it . Greyhound said its changes were prompted largely by its losing customers on trips of 500 to 750 miles -- such_as Los Angeles to Portland , Ore . Under the plan announced Thursday , Greyhound will abandon some of those less profitable longer routes and focus instead on serving cities within 400 miles of each other , said Elizabeth Dunn , a spokeswoman for the Dallas-based company . Besides Southern California , Greyhound is also concentrating_on the Northeast , South , Midwest and parts of Texas . The 100- to 400-mile trip market , where one-way fares are typically between $ 20 and $ 40 and rides last between two and eight hours , includes routes such_as Los Angeles to San Diego , San Francisco or Phoenix , Greyhound President Frank Schmeider said . Those short-haul fares are attractive compared to those for flying or driving , said Sarita Skidmore , a principal in the Menlo Consulting Group , which specializes in travel and tourism . Los Angeles , San Diego , Santa Ana , San Bernardino , Riverside , Barstow , Calexico and Indio are among the cities likely to benefit from lower fares , better and more frequent service or both , Dunn said . Greyhound has tested the concept in key short-haul markets around the country . After it reduced one-way fares from Los Angeles to San Francisco to $ 29 from $ 36 , ticket sales ballooned 61 % and revenue on that route rose 21 % , Dunn said . Greyhound will also cut costs by shedding 100 to 200 of its 1 # 800 buses , eliminating free baggage service and closing terminals during late-night_hours , Schmeider said . An unspecified number of jobs will be cut &quot; at all levels , &quot; he said . Greyhound has lost money in three of its last five quarters , and Schmeider said Thursday that the company will post an operating loss of at least $ 27 million for the second quarter . Greyhound hopes to lure more middle-income travelers who would otherwise drive or take low-fare flights . The average annual income of a Greyhound passenger is $ 16 # 444 . To succeed , Greyhound &quot; will have to do something to provide really good service , the way ( Amtrak ' s ) Metroliner has changed the image of the train , &quot; consultant Skidmore said . &quot; If Greyhound ' s service is good , they can compete. &quot; Planes , Trains and Buses Under attack mainly from low-cost airlines , Greyhound plans to restructure its bus_service in California and other markets . Here ' s how bus_fares compare to train and airline fares from Los Angeles . 07 # 17 , 07 # 06 , 07 # 08 , 08 # 09 * 2 * Greyhound * 2 * Amtrak * 2 * Southwest Los Angeles to : O-W R-T O-W R-T O-W R-T San Diego $ 12 $ 24 $ 24 $ 32 $ 49-69 $ 98-138 Santa Barbara 11.50 21 20 26 49-69 98-138 San Francisco 29 58 67 68-134 49-69 98-138 Phoenix 32 61 58-85 58-170 44-62 88-124 All fares are unrestricted .
