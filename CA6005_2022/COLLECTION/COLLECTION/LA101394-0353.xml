   <HEADLINE> HOTHOUSE JUNIOR HOCKEY ; LEAGUE HOPES TO RAISE CROP OF HEARTY , TALENTED PLAYERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The man from Hemet brought his wife to the mountains for a romantic weekend to celebrate their wedding_anniversary . Then they drove past the Ice Castle skating rink here and saw the sign out front . Jr . Ducks vs . SJ Jr . Sharks Hockey ? With no NHL games on TV or at local arenas , the couple pulled into the parking_lot to see what they had been missing since the lockout began Oct . 1 . The cozy bed and breakfast down the road would have to wait . Inside , they saw the opening faceoff of the Western States Hockey_League , a six-team league for advanced players aged 17 to 19 . Don Thorne of Huntington Beach , the league commissioner and president of the Anaheim Junior Ducks , dropped the puck for the ceremonial faceoff , then the game began for real . The hitting was fierce , the passing crisp and the small stands were packed with family , friends and the curious . Soon enough the Junior Ducks wrestled control from the Junior Sharks and turned a close-checking game into an 11-1 rout . The crowd , including the couple from Hemet , filed_out of the rink happy the Ducks had won . Thorne later fretted that the competition wasn ' t quite as_good_as he had hoped . After all , he started this league with the idea that standout players from Orange County would n ' t have to head out of state to play_at a high level . There have always been quality youth programs in Southern California , but never a good junior program for players aiming for a college or even pro career . Most of the players selected in the NHL draft each year are 18-year-olds taken from junior leagues such_as the Ontario Hockey_League , the Quebec Major Junior Hockey_League and the Western Hockey_League . Those three leagues are major junior A leagues . The Western States Hockey_League is classified as junior B . Size and strength are the two major differences between the levels . Thorne ' s son , Mike , advanced through area age-group teams , but suddenly had nowhere else to play once he reached the junior B level . &quot; We really needed a place for kids to play so they would n ' t have to go_to the East or Midwest or Canada to play , &quot; Don Thorne said . &quot; A lot of kids here are trying to attract attention to play_at ( NCAA ) Division I schools. &quot; In May , Thorne contacted USA Hockey , which suggested he start his own league . With an assist from Rick Chartraw , a former 10-year NHL veteran who now works for the Disney Co. , Thorne persuaded teams from Las Vegas , Salt_Lake_City , San Jose , Scottsdale , Ariz. , and Ventura to join up . &quot; It ' s something that ' s absolutely needed here , &quot; said Chartraw , who played three seasons with Kitchener of the OHL before joining the NHL . &quot; Some kids will take the next step ( to the junior A_level ) . Others will simply keep playing the game they love. &quot; John McFarlane , a youth coach from Mission Viejo , was enlisted to coach the Junior Ducks and a crowd of 100 hopeful players turned_out for tryouts . McFarlane cut the squad to 22 , including 10 players from Orange County , and they began play last Saturday . It ' s a program similar to most in Canada . The Junior Ducks pay to play -- about $ 1 # 200 per season , which covers equipment and transportation to home and away_games . Because ice time is scarce as well as expensive at Orange County rinks , the Junior Ducks call the Ice Castle home . Most players live at_home and continue attending school while playing_on weekends . &quot; This league is something I didn ' t foresee when I first started coaching in California , &quot; said McFarlane , who also played junior hockey in Canada before coming_to the Southland 10 years ago . &quot; There were only 70 kids in the ( youngest ) program , now there are over 300 . ( Wayne ) Gretzky did this magic down here . &quot; We have a_couple_of boys on our team with terrific potential. &quot; David Ahn , a senior at Sunny Hills High , is one . He was 6 when he first saw other youngsters playing_at a rink at the Brea Mall . The rink is gone , but Ahn ' s passion lives on . He played with and against Richard Park , a Rancho Palos Verdes resident who was drafted in June by the Pittsburgh Penguins after a 76-point season with the Belleville Bulls of the OHL . Ahn , a left wing , also played for McFarlane with a team called the Junior Kings . Ahn spent his junior year attending and playing hockey at Upper Canada College , a prestigious boarding_school in Toronto . He quickly asserted himself , impressing the coaching staff with his passing and stick-handling . Saturday , he was late to the Junior Ducks ' season-opener because he was taking the SAT . He hopes to attend Harvard next fall , to study and play hockey . He hopes playing for the Junior Ducks helps land him a spot on the Harvard roster next year . &quot; Since this league formed I ' ve been really happy , &quot; he said . &quot; Up in Toronto , I was totally homesick . I definitely want to go_to college . I love Harvard . I fell_in_love with it on a visit there. &quot; Said his father , John : &quot; This league is going_to be a big help for California kids. &quot; After David ' s year in Toronto , a 90-minute drive to Blue_Jay , near Lake Arrowhead , is only a small inconvenience for the Ahn family . &quot; It was a painful situation , &quot; John Ahn said . &quot; My son was not ready to leave home , but he had ( scholarship ) offers to go_to Toronto. &quot; David could have returned to Toronto or joined an OHL or WHL team , according to his father , but decided to play for the Junior Ducks instead . Like Ahn , Ryan Smith of Mission Viejo started playing_at a young age . Smith , 19 , also has left California in search of better competition , only to return to become a Junior Duck . A goaltender , Smith played last season with Jackson Hole , Wyo. , of the Frontier League . He also has played in Canada . When he was 11 , his coach asked_for volunteers to play in goal . Smith decided to give_it_a_try and has been in the nets ever since . &quot; I ' d never move_back to forward , &quot; he said . &quot; I like it back in the net . There ' s too_much pressure . I like the pressure . All the glory or all_the . . . &quot; Smith hopes the Junior Ducks are a springboard to a junior A team next season . From there he hopes to be drafted by an NHL team . &quot; I ' ve got a long ways to go , &quot; he said . &quot; Eventually , one day , I think I ' ll be there. &quot; If not ? &quot; I ' ll always play hockey , even if it ' s just playing beer league , &quot; he said . &quot; It would be nice to make the NHL . It ' s been my goal since I first_stepped on the ice. &quot; The Junior Ducks simply offer another step toward the NHL for Smith .</TEXT>
