   <HEADLINE> ONLY SIX DECADES AWAY FROM STONE_AGE , ISLANDERS TRADE FAX NUMBERS ; PAPUA NEW GUINEA : UNDER A FLAMING ORANGE HEADDRESS AND CLAD IN A LOINCLOTH , ONE NATIVE ENTREPRENEUR HANDS_OUT BUSINESS_CARDS TO FOREIGNERS SEEKING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Larry Andagali ' s painted face smiled broadly under a spectacular headdress of flaming orange feathers . A carved wooden club spiked with a razor-sharp claw of a flightless cassowary bird was tucked under his arm . He wore a loincloth of woven string and leaves . &quot; This is my fax number , &quot; he said , handing_out business_cards to foreigners seeking investment opportunities in Mt . Hagen , a frontier town in the remote highlands of Papua New Guinea . Andagali is the new face of this young nation with ancient traditions , a warrior turned executive . He and other indigenous entrepreneurs in Papua New Guinea , a region little known to the world before World_War_II , want to play a part in the global economy . At 29 , Andagali manages a company owned by 10 indigenous clans that collect joint royalties for natural_gas pumped from their land . The clans , traditional enemies who fought each other for centuries , became partners in 1990 so the royalties could be used to create jobs and improve living conditions . &quot; The culture of business is a something new_to the culture of my people , &quot; Andagali said . The clans still fight , &quot; but not as much as they used to and never about business. &quot; Western civilization was late in coming_to Papua New Guinea . Some communities saw their first Europeans only a_few generations ago and are only &quot; 60 years from the Stone_Age , &quot; said Julius Chan , deputy prime_minister and foreign_minister . Most of the 4 million people still live_in traditional villages , even though Papua New Guinea has one of the world ' s fastest-growing economies . Because of a boom in the development of natural_resources , the gross_domestic_product grew by 14.4 % in 1993 . Geologists regard the island nation just north of Australia as a mother lode of gold , copper and petroleum . &quot; This country can be called a golden land , &quot; Chan said in an interview during a government-sponsored tour for foreign investors and journalists . &quot; I know it is a cliche phrase , but it is right. &quot; Although Papua New Guinea enjoys a lively parliamentary_democracy with a thriving free press , its governments have been sensitive about foreign media criticism and limit access for foreign journalists . Now , two decades after gaining independence from Australia , the country seeks to use its potential mineral wealth as a ticket to integration with Asian economies . Last year , it was admitted to the 17-member Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) , which promotes trade among Asia , the United States , Canada , Australia , China and Japan . &quot; Membership of APEC is a vote_of_confidence by the rest of the world in our future , &quot; Prime_Minister Paias Wingti said . Several huge mines already are producing and prospectors are scouring the jungles , mountains and outer islands . Mining executives plan strategies in new air-conditioned office_buildings in Port Moresby , the capital , and a stock_market is to begin trading_in November . Ambitious projects in manufacturing , tourism and services are being planned . There is even a proposal to build a launching site for commercial satellites . &quot; Our businessmen now are the first generation of Papua New Guineans coming from a traditional village , &quot; Wingti said . &quot; Their parents could not speak English or write . We are quite proud that we are slowly building a middle_class . . . to play an important role in development. &quot; Despite its potential riches , Papua New Guinea has serious problems . It still relies_on financial_aid from Australia , and health and education services are poor in many areas . Roads , bridges and other infrastructure must be built . Mountains and thick jungles separate cities and towns now linked only by air or sea . Many villages are extremely remote . A 500-mile land border with Indonesia that bisects the island of New Guinea is almost impossible to police . Fellow Melanesians on the other side often cross as refugees , sometimes pursued by Indonesian soldiers . People in some parts of the country have never seen an airplane , Wingti said , and &quot; others might see one only once a month bringing supplies and letters . It is , he said , &quot; a difficult country. &quot; Part of that difficulty is an enormous diversity of cultures and ethnic_groups . In a land of more_than 700 languages , the common tongue has become Pidgin , a stew of English and various European and indigenous dialects . In most villages , food comes from gardens hacked out of the rain_forest , and a man ' s wealth is often measured by the number of pigs he owns . Rural people who grow cash crops such_as coconuts , cocoa and coffee now are suffering from a slump in world prices for those commodities . Rapid modernization has come at a high price . Crime has soared as young people drift into urban_areas . When they find no work , some form what are known in Pidgin as &quot; rascal &quot; crime gangs . Walls topped with razor wire surround tourist hotels and the homes of foreigners . Stores have bars on their windows . The security-guard business is thriving . Police have set_up roadblocks outside some towns to keep potential troublemakers away . Several disputes have arisen between the government and mining_companies over the level of foreign ownership in mineral projects . Some large mines have caused major pollution and logging of the rain_forest , one of the largest after the Amazon , has been a serious concern . On Bougainville , problems between foreign companies and traditional landowners led to a 5-year uprising in which at least 500 people have been killed . Many more are believed to have died from lack of food and medicine caused by a government blockade of the island .</TEXT>
