   <TEXT> Kissing their parents goodby , hugging lunch boxes and notebooks , 300 Jewish children pour into the I.E. Lichtigfeld primary_school each morning through an iron gate and electric doors with bomb-proof glass . Police patrol the streets around the school in the city ' s lush West_End neighborhood while video cameras monitor its hallways . Inside , a_few boys don yarmulkes and sit_down with girls in ponytails for reading , writing and arithmetic , Hebrew and Judaism . Throughout their lessons , the children address the particular dilemma of being German and Jewish . &quot; In history classes , we speak_of their families . They know their parents didn ' t have any aunts and uncles or grandparents , &quot; said Alexa Brum , director of Frankfurt ' s only Jewish school . &quot; They also know that after a while they will have to go_out to gymnasium ( public high_school ) , &quot; she said . &quot; We teach them that it is absolutely normal to be Jewish and that they should be proud -- proud people who eventually have to decide if they want to integrate into this society or go elsewhere . Someday , they must make a decision. &quot; To stay or leave , integrate or isolate . These are the questions that plagued the Holocaust survivors who settled in Germany after the Nazi extermination of 6 million European Jews , and that once again weigh_on their children and grandchildren who see a resurgence of anti-Semitism . Frankfurt is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in Germany and is home to a quarter of the republic ' s 40 # 000 Jews . But even here , Jews say they increasingly feel unwelcome in their own country and , occasionally , threatened . Unified Germany is experiencing a growing sense of national pride that frightens many Jews for whom nationalism harkens back to the Third_Reich . They see Europe ' s most powerful country increasingly anxious that it will be diminished by European unity . And they watch a small but emboldened radical right finding resonance among Germans who seek someone to blame for their severe economic problems -- including the highest unemployment since World_War_II . In this climate , postwar taboos against racism and anti-Semitism are breaking_down : In the last two years , Turkish immigrants have been killed in arson attacks by rightists in Moelln and Solingen ; scores of Germans watched and applauded as arsonists set fire to a home for foreign asylum-seekers in Rostock , and only two weeks ago , a mob of rightists and hooligans attacked black_Africans and destroyed a restaurant owned by Turks in Magdeburg . Once-anonymous hate mail has been sent to Jewish leaders with unabashed signatures . And neo-Nazis fire-bombed the synagogue in Luebeck on the eve of Passover -- the first such attack since the Nazis ' Kristallnacht rampage against Jews in 1938 . After the synagogue-burning , radical-rightist politician and former SS officer Franz Schoenhuber said Frankfurt ' s Jewish leaders are to blame for anti-Semitism in Germany . &quot; The rats have come_out of the holes , &quot; Brum said . &quot; There has always been anti-Semitism , but now they dare to say it out loud and dare to throw bombs. &quot; After the fatal attack in Solingen , sixth-graders at Frankfurt ' s Jewish school bared their fears in essays about being German and Jewish . &quot; The Nazis want to take power over Germany , &quot; wrote 12-year-old Michaela , a Frankfurt native . &quot; They scribble on the walls ' Jewish Pigs ' and similar things . Then I realize that I am in the wrong country . Germany belongs_to the Germans , and Jews have nothing to do here. &quot; About half a_million Jews lived_in Germany before the Nazis were voted into power in 1933 . Nine years later , the 30 # 000-member Jewish community in Frankfurt was officially decreed to have been eradicated . It had been a vibrant community of well-to-do German Jews who contributed financially and culturally to the city -- bankers , industrialists and intellectuals from the so-called Frankfurt School of social_scientists -- and of Polish immigrants who provided craftsmen and laborers . Liberal Frankfurt even had a Jewish mayor . &quot; Jews were not just tolerated , they were accepted , &quot; said Jewish author Valentin Senger . &quot; They were a part of Frankfurt. &quot; Within a couple years , the Nazis turned the city against Jews , Gypsies and anyone who did not fit the Aryan ideal , and carted them off to concentration_camps . Senger ' s apparently was the only Jewish family to survive the Third_Reich in Frankfurt , passing as non-Jews and working in the Resistance . After the war , the_British and Americans set_up displaced persons camps in Germany for survivors of Hitler ' s concentration_camps . One of them , Zeilsheim , provided the base for Frankfurt ' s postwar Jewish community , which today numbers about 6 # 500 . Most of the settlers were merchants and craftsmen from small Jewish communities in Poland who never meant to remain in Germany . They had children and reluctantly put_down roots , reopening the synagogue , a community_center , a home for the elderly , a school for their children . But they were always &quot; sitting on packed bags &quot; because they wished to leave or believed that one day they might have to leave . They wanted nothing to do with Germans , whom they considered immoral . Thus , the children of survivors were raised in a Jewish ghetto of postwar Germany with all its contradictions . Their youth organizations encouraged them to move to Israel . Their parents would not let them date Gentiles . But they went_to German high_schools , spoke German , held German passports . They were citizens of Germany exempted from military_service as the offspring of Nazi victims . &quot; It was schizophrenic , &quot; said David Lieberberg , managing director of the popular_music department at Frankfurt ' s Old Opera_House . &quot; My parents were always proud when I ' d come_home from school with A ' s in German. &quot; But the minute his sister was caught with a German boyfriend , she was sent_away to Israel . German friends at school knew little about Jews or the Holocaust . &quot; History_lessons used to go_through Germany , up_to the Weimar Republic , then move_over to Russia and come_back to Germany after the war , &quot; said Lieberberg , 46 . &quot; During religion lessons in school I had a free hour . Kids said , ' What are you ? A Jew ? What ' s that ? ' They hadn ' t heard. &quot; Largely Protestant and Roman_Catholic Germany is a country with strict norms governing appearance and behavior . Jews generally have different biblical names and darker complexions . They celebrate different religious_holidays . And because of this , German-born Jews are frequently asked where they come from . In adolescence , many children of survivors began to challenge their parents : Why did you come_to Germany ? Why did you stay ? Their parents didn ' t have answers . They had stayed because they had stayed . Frankfurt Jews first emerged from isolation in the fall of 1985 in what became known internationally as the Fassbinder Affair . Reiner Werner Fassbinder ' s play &quot; Garbage , the City and Death &quot; was to be staged at a local theater , and Frankfurt ' s Jews were outraged by a work they judged to be anti-Semitic . On opening_night , they occupied the stage and closed the play_down . For some , the public controversy marked the coming of_age of the German Jewish community . For others , it was another way of hiding , of quieting public discussion . In either case , it marked the emergence of Jewish leaders who believed that Jews were in Germany to stay and must interact with the community at_large . &quot; There must be a conscious , proud , independent Jewish life , &quot; said Michel Friedman , 38 , a spokesman for the Frankfurt Jewish community . &quot; But Jewish life also has to be part of the common society , and there has to be a dialogue between Jews and non-Jews. &quot; In the last couple of years , Jewish leaders have taken political discussions about Jewish issues into public forums . They opened Jewish cultural events to non-Jews and routinely speak out against abuses of all minorities . &quot; I always fight for integration , not for assimilation , &quot; said Ignatz Bubis , 66 , a leader of the Frankfurt Jewish community and head of Germany ' s Central Council of Jews . Some Jews say they never suffered discrimination growing_up in Germany . For decades after the war , anti-Semitism was taboo , buried or , in some cases , overcome . Many Jews felt anti-Semitism more strongly elsewhere , such_as in Poland and France , while guilt-ridden Germans handled them with kid_gloves . To stay or leave , integrate or isolate . Younger Jews began to make_peace with their German heritage and to accept that they belonged_to two cultures . Their bags were unpacked -- they meant to stay in Germany . &quot; I grew_up here , went_to school here , read German books , German is my mother_tongue , &quot; said Josse Reich , 31 , the son of Holocaust survivors . &quot; I make_fun of the Germans . I imitate them very well because I am them. &quot; &quot; What else could I be ? &quot; added Marc Gruenbaum , 24 . &quot; To live with conflict is not normal . You can ' t always be thinking_of leaving or you can ' t concentrate_on your life . When I define myself as German , I can fight for the Germany I ' d like to have. &quot; And now is the time to fight , Gruenbaum said . Jews young and old see German society growing more conservative and rigid since the Berlin Wall was torn_down and a daily reminder of Germany ' s dark history disappeared . Increasingly , Germans say they want to put the past behind them , and the political shift is encouraging radical rightists to act_on their anti-foreigner , anti-Semitic sentiments . Extreme-right political_parties are scoring poorly in election polls , however , and are looking_for new issues , Jewish leaders note . With the tightening of asylum laws last year , they appear to be turning their attention from immigrants to Jews . Bubis ' 30-year-old daughter , Naomi , says the radical right National Democratic Party sought permission to hold a rally outside the Jewish Community_Center recently to protest excessive Jewish influence in German politics . &quot; This could never have happened before reunification . Before , they knew no one would support them . Now , they feel more sympathy ( for their ideas ) in the non-Jewish community , &quot; she said , adding that the permit was denied and the rally never took_place . The memory of the Holocaust and current upsurge in anti-Semitism made_it difficult for Frankfurt ' s Jewish community to recruit a rabbi for their orthodox synagogue . There is no German rabbinical school , and there are no German rabbis . Frankfurt ' s West_End synagogue was without a rabbi for 2 1 / 2 years before members persuaded Rabbi Menachem Halevi Klein to come from Israel last fall . &quot; I am here only for religious reasons , &quot; he said . &quot; There are hundreds of kids who know_nothing about Judaism , and that is my project . There are many Russians , and someone has to tell them that they are Jewish . There is kosher food. &quot; But he shook his head . &quot; It is a very difficult feeling on this ground where so_much Jewish blood was spilled . I don ' t feel afraid , but I don ' t feel good. &quot; At the Lichtigfeld school , children sing Jewish songs and celebrate their heritage unfazed by the tight security measures around them . But director Brum notes that 400 Russian Jewish families that were supposed to emigrate to Frankfurt this year have not arrived . Many stayed in Russia or moved to Israel , fearing anti-Semitism in Germany . Brum , meanwhile , bought a small summer_house in France a_couple_of years ago that she says gives her family a sense of security -- a place to go &quot; if something happens &quot; in Germany . And many Jews born and raised in Frankfurt are beginning to ask themselves whether they should raise their children here . &quot; I don ' t want my children to live_in fear , &quot; David Lieberberg said . &quot; I am German . I feel very German , &quot; Josse Reich added . &quot; But since having a daughter a year ago , I don ' t know if I really want to stay now. &quot;</TEXT>
