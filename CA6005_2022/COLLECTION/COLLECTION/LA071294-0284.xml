   <HEADLINE> AMERICA FROM ABROAD ; TWO U.S. ASTRONAUTS LEARNING TO SAY ' BEAM ME UP ' IN RUSSIAN ; THE PAIR ARE STUDYING HARD TO BECOME THE FIRST AMERICANS TO FLY TO THE MIR SPACE_STATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Compared to mastering what ' s known as &quot; the great and mighty Russian language , &quot; flying a Soviet-designed rocket to the Mir space_station and spending three months in space will be a cinch . At least , that is how it looks these days to veteran U.S. astronauts Norman Thagard and Bonnie Dunbar , in training since March to become the first Americans to fly to the Mir next year . &quot; I ' m in the first_grade and grad school at_the_same_time , &quot; Dunbar said recently , referring to the combination of elementary Russian and advanced space science that makes_up her day . &quot; The language is the biggest impediment -- getting past the language. &quot; Russian is no polyglot ' s picnic . The endings of nouns change , letters mutate unexpectedly and the basic vocabulary has little in common with English . If it is enough to make college_students break_into a sweat , think_of the language stress involved for Thagard , 50 , and Dunbar , 45 , whose lives could at some point depend_on understanding a Russian command or warning . &quot; There is no alternative to knowing Russian by the time we fly , &quot; Thagard , a physician , said with grim determination . As the first-string astronaut -- Dunbar , a biomedical engineer , is his backup -- Thagard expects to fly to the Mir with two cosmonauts next March and then spend three months there with its Russian crew . That would be longer than any American has spent in space . The NASA record , set_in 1973-74 aboard Skylab , is 84 days ; the Russians set the world_record of 366 days aboard Mir in 1987-88 . The mission is notable in other ways too . Americans and Russians haven ' t worked so closely together in space since the U.S. Apollo spacecraft linked up with the Soviet ship Soyuz in 1975 . Thagard will blast_off in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft but expects to fly home on the American shuttle Atlantis , which will attempt to dock at the Mir . And this is the first time that NASA will have a chance to do comparably serious in-orbit research on the physical effects of extended space_travel since Skylab . Above all , the American trip to Mir , combined with a reciprocal program for cosmonauts to fly_on American space shuttles , will help lay the groundwork for the ultimate in U.S.-Russian space cooperation : an international space_station , expected to begin construction in 1997 and to be known as Alpha . &quot; Coming at the end of the Cold_War , we ' re forging a new relationship , &quot; Dunbar said , and &quot; we ( two ) just come as part of a big program. &quot; The pair talk like the government employees they are , in diplomatic tones devoid_of hype or even much excitement about the drama of their circumstances . But drama there is , if only in that they are pioneers in America ' s acquaintance with Russian cosmonauts and are paying the typical pioneer ' s price in discomfort , isolation and fear of pitfalls . The two live about 20 miles from Moscow in a characteristic Soviet-era high-rise apartment_building in the campus-like town of Zvyozdny Gorodok , or Star City , former home to the first man in space , Yuri Gagarin . As in most of these buildings , the elevator can break_down , and the hot water sometimes goes_off . Thagard was joined just recently by his wife and 14-year-old son , but Dunbar remains half a world away from her husband , astronaut Ronald Sega . Phone_calls can be problematic ; poor Soviet phone_lines make connections iffy , and the satellite phone they have with them is too expensive to use much . Both describe the reception they have received from their Russian colleagues as &quot; cordial &quot; but do not sound as if they have been given any star treatment . On the other hand , they have also not been hampered by security restrictions , unlike their American predecessors at Star City -- three astronauts who visited occasionally to work_on the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission . The only warning the astronauts have received , Thagard said , is not to take the electric train from Star City to Moscow -- a ride often populated by drunks and toughs . &quot; They ' re worried a lot about our safety , &quot; he said . The two astronauts have also chosen not to drive_in Russia because the traffic rules are slightly different from those in the United States . Instead , they use Russian drivers . So , they were asked , you ' re brave enough to face the perils of space but not the perils of Moscow ' s roads ? &quot; There ' s no avoiding the risks of riding a rocket , &quot; Thagard said . The astronauts must face another great challenge before entering space : oral_exams at the end of their training , all_in Russian , an ordeal that has no parallel in National Aeronautics and Space Administration training . They also cope daily with lectures in Russian on the technical aspects of their work . Thagard , who had already studied some Russian , does much of the translating for Dunbar . When he gets stuck , a Russian translator steps_in . Fortunately , the studies are not conceptually hard for them . &quot; The principles are pretty straightforward whether you ' re flying here or there , &quot; Dunbar said . &quot; Physics is physics , and chemistry is chemistry. &quot; * Neither would nibble at questions about whether Russian equipment is more primitive than its U.S. equivalent . Thagard repeated that &quot; the fundamental problem is one of language , not technology. &quot; A typical day for the pair might include four hours of Russian and two hours of practicing on a Soyuz simulator ; or two hours of studying the Mir ' s life-support systems , some independent study , two hours of familiarizing themselves with the Mir and two hours of serious physical workout . They have also experienced the special Russian psychological training for long-haul space crews , which the astronauts said consists largely of yoga relaxation techniques . In the fall , they will begin working with their future flight crews . Thagard ' s research aboard the Mir will focus_on the effects of prolonged space_travel on the human_body , in hopes of finding more ways to stem the bone loss and deterioration of the cardiovascular_system that come_with prolonged weightlessness . Russian doctors have been testing cosmonauts during the eight years that Mir has been in orbit , but they did before-and-after comparisons rather than in-flight exams . &quot; This will be the most extensive metabolic study in space , &quot; Thagard said . The logic of the joint project works like this : America has the space shuttle , which can deliver cargo loads easily , but has no space_station to fly it to , while the U.S. shuttles offer Russia improved cargo capacity to and from its space_station . &quot; It ' s very much a mutually cooperative program , &quot; Dunbar said . Four other astronauts will follow Thagard and Dunbar to Star City for training in coming months , and 10 shuttle-Mir dockings are planned . Dunbar and Thagard are already planning the friendly gesture to cement that cooperation . When they return from their flight , Thagard said , they will lay flowers at Star City ' s monument to Yuri Gagarin -- just as all_the other cosmonauts do .</TEXT>
