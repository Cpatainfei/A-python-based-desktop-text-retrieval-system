   <HEADLINE> JUDGE DELIVERS SETBACK TO NUCLEAR DUMP ; ENVIRONMENT : RULING SAYS STATE HAS FAILED TO ANSWER RADIOACTIVE LEAKAGE QUESTION . ACTION SUSPENDS LICENSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a significant setback to California ' s efforts to build a low-level nuclear waste dump in the Mojave_Desert , a Los Angeles Superior_Court judge ruled Wednesday that the state has not adequately addressed scientific arguments that radioactive material could leak into the nearby Colorado_River . Both sides in the case agreed that the ruling by Judge Robert H . O ' Brien effectively suspends the license to operate the proposed Ward Valley dump . That license was issued last year to US Ecology Inc. , a firm that runs several other waste dumps around the country . The judge ' s nine-page opinion dismissed most of the objections raised by opponents in their lawsuit challenging the license . The opponents had argued that the state failed to measure the impact of a dump not only on the river but also on wildlife habitat and misled the public on the amount of highly toxic plutonium that would be buried there . But O ' Brien made_it clear that the state needs to provide more answers on the issue of radioactive leaks into the river . &quot; The questions of most concern to all parties and the public generally are : Will the Colorado_River be contaminated ? &quot; O ' Brien wrote . &quot; Is it threatened to be contaminated ? Is it possible it will be contaminated ? &quot; Those are the questions raised in a controversial document known as the Wilshire Report which Ward Valley opponents claim that state and federal_officials tried to quash when it was released last year . The report by Howard Wilshire , a U.S. Department of Interior scientist , and two colleagues says the geology surrounding Ward Valley would allow contaminated water leaking from the facility to make its way to the Colorado by one of several pathways . The river is about 20 miles from the proposed dump site . The judge found that the California Department of Health Services , the agency responsible_for licensing Ward Valley , had not given the report adequate consideration . &quot; It does not appear that the analysis therein has been placed in a proper perspective , so that an objective person can properly evaluate it with the overall concerns and issues , &quot; O ' Brien wrote . &quot; Due_to the extraordinary importance of what is at stake here , e.g. radioactive waste and drinking_water . . . the analysis of the Wilshire Report should be placed side_by_side , in its complete form , with the counter-analysis before any approval. &quot; O ' Brien was ruling on a lawsuit brought by four groups , including the Ft . Mojave Indians , whose land is located near the proposed dump , Physicians for Social Responsibility , the Southern California Federation of Scientists and Committee to Bridge the Gap , a nonprofit , anti-nuclear organization that has spearheaded the campaign against Ward Valley . Roger Carrick , the lawyer for the groups , hailed the judge ' s ruling as &quot; a courageous decision that cut_to the heart of the issue at Ward Valley. &quot; Now the state must prepare a rebuttal to the Wilshire Report that satisfies O ' Brien and puts the Ward Valley approval process back on track . &quot; I think what O ' Brien is really looking_for is something that both he , the judge , and the public can understand , &quot; said Peter Baldridge , a staff attorney for the Health Services_Department . Baldridge suggested that the job could be time-consuming . &quot; First we need to decide what is the best way to approach it . We are going_to want to provide him with a good explanation . that ' s not going_to be difficult to do , but it ' s going_to take some time , &quot; Baldridge said . Karl Lytz , the lawyer for US Ecology , said the judge ' s ruling could delay legal approval of the project by many months . Even if O ' Brien gives his approval to the environmental assessment , opening of the dump is far from certain . The proposed dump site is owned by the federal_government and it must agree to transfer it to the state before the dump can be built . Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt has pledged to hold a hearing to resolve any unanswered safety questions before agreeing to the transfer . Consisting of several unlined trenches , the dump would accept radioactive waste from nuclear_power plants as well as hospitals and biomedical firms .</TEXT>
