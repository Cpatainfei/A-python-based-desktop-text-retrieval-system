   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEWS ; ' SIMPLE MEN ' GO IN SEARCH OF THEIR DAD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> PBS ' &quot; American Playhouse , &quot; noted for its consistently provocative , creative programming , has blown the limits of viewer patience this time_out . Writer-director Hal Hartley ' s &quot; Simple Men , &quot; about two wildly different young brothers and their joint search on the back roads of Long_Island for their long-lost radical / activist dad , is too quirky and arch an experiment to sustain its shaky moorings . Most aggravating about Hartley ' s style is not so_much the visual dead spots masquerading as pregnant pauses but his stylized dialogue and aphorisms that sound like a collegiate trick . Minimalism as a concept is fine , but the spare , abbreviated conversations here become tiresome , even exhausting . Hartley ' s acting family here features campus cohorts from the acting program at the State University of New York at Purchase ( notably the cynical Robert Burke and the bookish William Sage as the star-crossed brothers , and the quietly absorbing Karen Sillas as an independent-minded proprietor of a roadhouse who falls_for one of the brothers. ) * &quot; Simple Men &quot; airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15 .
