   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / TOM HAYDEN : THE SPECIAL_INTERESTS STILL RULE ; IN ALL THE TALK OF AN ELECTION REVOLUTION , THERE ' S NO MENTION OF CAMPAIGN REFORM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The central political abuse that will not be changed by the new Republican Establishment is the ongoing torrent of special-interest money for consultants , commercials and candidates that corrupts the democratic process . Notably missing from Speaker-elect Newt Gingrich ' s Republican &quot; contract &quot; is any reform of campaign spending or the sordid skulduggery of the estimated 80 # 000 lobbyists encamped in Washington . The new Republican leadership is gearing to stand tall against welfare mothers but can ' t be found when it comes_to confronting contributors seeking handouts . Gingrich declared to political-action-committee representatives in mid-October , &quot; What we ' ve said to all_the PACs and , frankly , to their donors is that this is the year. &quot; He also warned that &quot; for anybody who ' s not on board now , it ' s going_to be the two coldest years in Washington. &quot; But the problem now is bipartisan . In all_the post-election chatter among Democrats , Republicans and Washington pundits , there has been little reference_to reforming a system that obviously disgusts most voters . Nearly $ 100 million was spent in the California gubernatorial and U.S. Senate_races alone , most of that on clashing commercials aimed at a small percentage of undecided voters . If democracy means a majority vote based on independent information , democracy is being killed by advertising . Meaningful change is buried as well . Burning issues like the decline of our cities and schools and the inflationary growth of prisons go unaddressed while small but well-heeled farming and mining interests hammer politicians into protecting their century-old , virtually free access to public lands . Even successful populist efforts of the past , such_as Proposition 103 , which required an elected insurance commissioner , have been turned upside down by stealth money . The insurance_companies elected a pro-industry regulator , Chuck Quackenbush , and were the biggest contributors to Pete Wilson . Most of the key players in the power game benefit from the current fund-raising rules . The Republicans are not going_to surrender the money arsenal that funded their sweep . The Democrats plan to be &quot; comeback kids &quot; in 1996 with funds from interest_groups of_their_own . The consult ant industry and the television networks make millions in fees . Only the public withdraws , retching . If neither party proves capable of breaking its addiction to this treadmill , our situation requires an independent grass-roots movement , a legal challenge to the status_quo , a statewide initiative in 1996 and perhaps even a third_party before the decade is over . To prevent another 1994 electoral debacle , here are the kinds of reform we need : * An educational campaign to reverse the 1975 Supreme Court ruling that the unlimited spending of money in politics is a First_Amendment right . It was supported by the ACLU , mistakenly believing that minority views could only be protected by sympathetic millionaires . It is remarkable that so many politicians attack the courts for being soft_on crime and abortion while none have challenged the courts ' coddling of wealthy contributors and candidates . * Applying anti-trust doctrine to electoral competition , there must be expenditure limits enacted , with public matching funds for candidates who agree to debates and other fair campaign practices . Contribution limits alone are not enough . Any interest_group can arrange for thousands of small contributions in place of one big check . * Regulate or eliminate 30- or 60-second commercials . Paid advertising is a marketing device , not democratic dialogue . It cannot be answered except by those with money . An alternative could be re-establishment of the &quot; fairness doctrine. &quot; * Liberate campaigns from Madison Avenue and center them in a multimedia &quot; town square &quot; through interactive video and the free media . * There is no democratic reason to close voter registration 30 days before an election . Nor should elections be limited to 12 hours on a working_day when they could be administered on a weekend . The new Gingrichites , like the incumbents before them , can celebrate the winning of office but it is unlikely that they can govern fairly or efficiently . Their own arrogance leads to policies that are too self-serving to solve the problems of society . The crisis , then , will deepen until their addictive paradigm is shattered .</TEXT>
