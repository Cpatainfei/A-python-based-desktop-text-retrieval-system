   <HEADLINE> SPECTER OF MARIEL BOAT LIFT IS RAISED -- 14 YEARS LATER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It has been 14 years since 125 # 000 Cuban refugees flooded U.S. shores after President Fidel Castro permitted them to leave the port of Mariel in small_boats in what one U.S. official called &quot; population warfare. &quot; They came_across the Florida Straits in droves , overwhelming resettlement agencies and refugee camps . Castro warned then , as he has done recently , that Washington ' s policy of accepting Cuban immigrants while granting few visas encourages illegal efforts to leave his country . Historians said that the flotilla was spurred by social unrest in Havana and the promise of economic opportunity in the United States . When Castro announced that he would permit Cubans who wanted to leave the country to sail for Florida from Mariel in April , 1980 , hundreds chartered boats . Cuban Americans in Southern Florida used their own boats to help transport refugees . Two weeks after Castro ' s announcement , then-President Jimmy_Carter said that the United States would &quot; welcome the Cuban refugees with open arms and open hearts. &quot; Carter later asked Castro to help regulate the influx of immigrants and instructed the Coast Guard to prevent further boat lifts on May 14 . The Coast Guard was spending nearly $ 700 # 000 a day to stem the flow of immigrants but its efforts largely failed because the sheer numbers of boats leaving Cuba overwhelmed them . Cutters seized more_than 1 # 400 small craft but many_more slipped through . The exodus continued until September , when a Castro order ended it . By then Cuban immigrants had flooded the nation ' s processing centers and begun staging hunger_strikes to protest lengthy detention as they awaited resettlement . An estimated 8 # 000 criminals and hundreds of mentally_ill refugees -- apparently released from Cuban institutions by Castro -- were among the refugees who flooded into Florida and other states . About 1 # 100 of the refugees -- some convicted of crimes in this country -- still are held_in federal prisons without the right to legal immigrant status . But most of the refugees are now U.S. citizens , immigration experts said . Many settled in the Miami area . &quot; When the criminal activity surfaced , Marielito ( a term for those who came_to the United States in the exodus ) became like a bad word , &quot; said Juan Clark , a Miami sociologist . &quot; Once the rotten apples were weeded_out , the whole_thing changed and today you don ' t hear that word much any more. &quot; Miami Beach police officials reported that the city ' s crime_rate soared by 30 % in the first three months of the flotilla . Then-Arkansas Gov . Bill_Clinton called_out National Guardsmen in June 2 , 1980 , to deal with rioting by hundreds of Cuban refugees , who were held at Ft . Chafee , Ark . Other Cuban criminals were held_in a federal penitentiary in Atlanta , where they rioted and set fires in 1984 , causing $ 1 million in damage .</TEXT>
