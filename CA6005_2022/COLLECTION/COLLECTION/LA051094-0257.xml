   <HEADLINE> JAPANESE TRADE SURPLUS RISES 3.3 % TO RECORD $ 130 BILLION ; COMMERCE : HOWEVER , MUCH OF THE FISCAL-YEAR INCREASE IS BLAMED ON THE RISING VALUE OF THE YEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japan ' s current_account surplus , long a source of friction with the United States and other major trading partners , rose 3.3 % to a record $ 130.04 billion in the fiscal_year ended March 31 , the Finance Ministry said Monday . The current_account , a broad measure of trade_in goods and services plus certain other capital flows , amounted to $ 125.90 billion a year earlier . The United States_government has raised the possibility of imposing trade sanctions if Japan does not take steps to reduce its perennial surpluses . Measured in yen , however , the fiscal 1993 surplus narrowed by 10 % from the previous year as the rising yen encouraged spending by Japanese and discouraged purchases of Japanese products abroad . The surplus fell to 14 trillion yen from fiscal 1992 ' s 15.6 trillion . The yen ' s rise against the dollar raises the value , in dollars , of Japanese exports . The dollar was trading at about 102 yen at the end of fiscal 1993 , compared to about 115 at the end of fiscal 1992 . Thus 1 # 000 yen worth of exports would have been worth $ 8.70 at the start of the fiscal_year and $ 9.80 at the end . Over the long_run , analysts expect the dollar ' s effect on Japanese products ' competitiveness to help shrink the surplus in both dollar and yen terms . Last week , the dollar approached its modern record low of 100.40 yen , reached Aug . 17 last year . It closed Monday in Tokyo at 102.41 yen . In March , the surplus fell 16 % to $ 15.76 billion , from $ 18.79 billion a year earlier , the ministry said . In yen , March ' s current surplus plummeted 25 % . The ministry does not provide a breakdown of figures by country or region for the current_account . In calendar 1993 , Japan ' s trade surplus with the United States reached $ 59 billion .</TEXT>
