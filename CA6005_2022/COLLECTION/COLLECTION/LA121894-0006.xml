   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY : THE ROAD TRIP ' HOME '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Originally , Kirk Douglas planned to star with his Oscar-winning son Michael in the father-son drama &quot; Take Me Home Again , &quot; which premieres Sunday on NBC . But the timing wasn ' t right . &quot; About three years ago , Michael sent me the script , &quot; Douglas , a rugged 78 , recalls in his Beverly Hills office . &quot; We have been looking_for about five years for something to do together . He said , ' I think I got something. ' And he sent me the script. &quot; But Douglas thought the script by Ernest Thompson ( &quot; On Golden Pond &quot; ) , about a dying man and his estranged son who travel cross-country so he can die in the bed he was born in , was too &quot; down. &quot; So he told Michael , &quot; We will find something better. &quot; About nine months ago , Douglas was sent the script again . The second time around , Douglas really liked it . &quot; I said , ' Michael , you ' re right . Let ' s do it. ' &quot; But Douglas fils was set to do two movies . So while Michael was making the high-profile Christmas release &quot; Disclosure , &quot; Douglas was off doing &quot; Take Me Home Again , &quot; not as a theatrical film , but for the small screen . Craig T . Nelson , star of the long-running ABC sitcom &quot; Coach , &quot; came_on board as Douglas ' son . Douglas , who has starred in countless film classics , including &quot; Champion , &quot; &quot; The Bad and the Beautiful , &quot; &quot; Lust for Life , &quot; &quot; Spartacus &quot; and &quot; The Big Carnival &quot; ( also known as &quot; Ace in the Hole &quot; ) doesn ' t mind tht &quot; Take Me Home Again &quot; found a home on TV . &quot; I have done about five or six TV movies ( &quot; Amos , &quot; &quot; Inherit the Wind , &quot; &quot; The Secret &quot; among them ) which I have liked , &quot; says Douglas , who describes himself as &quot; a feisty guy , &quot; but comes_across as easygoing and friendly . &quot; When I think_of the ratings that they had , I think more people have seen those movies than have seen a lot of my theatrical movies . I think TV very often allows you to do a movie , not on a very expensive budget , on a subject that is very often difficult to do as a theatrical . I am more interested in finding something I enjoy playing . And ' Take Me Home Again ' was really fun to play. &quot; And Douglas loved working with TV actor Nelson . &quot; I found it very easy working with Craig . He is a real professional . He was very easy to work with , which was nice because we had so many scenes together. &quot; Douglas was a childhood idol of Nelson ' s . So needless to say , Nelson was thrilled to work with him . &quot; I wasn ' t nervous , &quot; Nelson says . &quot; I was just in awe . As a kid I had seen ' Spartacus ' and it was just phenomenal to actually realize you are going_to be working with this guy . I was terribly impressed . He was so professional , such a great guy. &quot; And Douglas , Nelson says , insisted on a lot of rehearsal time . &quot; He made_sure of that , &quot; he says . &quot; We had a lot of good times together . I was very fortunate to have that opportunity . It was a really wonderful shoot . It went_by too quickly. &quot; In &quot; Take Me Home Again , &quot; Douglas plays Ed Reece , a former traveling salesman who is dying of cancer . &quot; I am the old_geezer who wants to go_back where he was born , &quot; he says with a flash of his famous blue eyes . Douglas says the film reminds him of Arthur Miller ' s landmark play &quot; Death of a Salesman. &quot; &quot; From my point_of_view -- that ' s why I was so interested in it as a vehicle for Michael and me -- it is really about a father who wants to get_back with his older son , &quot; he says . &quot; It is usually that way . Very often , the oldest son is a rebel . It was that way with Michael . Michael was always a rebel . For the last eight years we have had a very close relationship . ( Before that ) , we weren ' t close . Michael would always do his own thing and now , it is nice . &quot; We had breakfast this morning . I left a message for him : ' If you are free , come_over to the house at 8 for breakfast. ' And he came_over and looked_at his watch and said , ' Dad , it is 10 to 8 . I said , ' Michael , you and I have that same quality , we have a compunction to be_on time , ' which my other sons don ' t share. &quot; Douglas believes he and the eldest of his four sons have bonded because Michael has carved out his own identity . &quot; I think that happens with all kids , especially if their father is a strong father , a successful father . The sons have to find their own identity . Certainly , if Michael doesn ' t have his identity now he is never going_to find it. &quot; He also found a real kinship with Ed . &quot; As I said before , the closest thing this reminds me of is ' Death of a Salesman. ' Time goes_on and you have been_on the road so_much . I can relate to that . When I was young , I was making three movies a year . You are not spending enough time with your kid . Suddenly you say , ' Wait a minute. ' And you want to catch_up on certain things . In a sense , this movie is catching_up_with your relationship with your son. &quot; Though Douglas is still eager to work with Michael , writing is the elder Douglas ' first priority these days . This past summer , he published his third novel , the critically acclaimed &quot; Last Tango in Brooklyn. &quot; Douglas peruses the shelves of his office looking_for a copy of the novel to give his visitor . He finally finds one and opens_up the title_page to autograph it . &quot; Michael ' s company has been talking_about making_it into a movie , &quot; Douglas says , sliding the book across the desk . &quot; I think you will enjoy it. &quot; Currently , Douglas is writing a sequel to his best-selling autobiography , &quot; The Ragman ' s Son. &quot; &quot; My first book was looking_back , &quot; he says . &quot; My next one is going_to be a continuation of my life_story from a very different point of view. &quot; The new book will start with Douglas ' 1991 accident involving a helicopter in which he was a passenger . The helicopter collided_with a light plane and Douglas was injured ; the plane ' s two occupants were killed . &quot; It will start with the helicopter crash , posing the question : ' Why am I alive ? ' These two people were killed and I felt so guilty . How does that happen ? In a way , this will be a lot more introspective. &quot; Just the other day , Douglas says , he wrote a chapter on his good friend and frequent co-star , Burt Lancaster , who died in October of a heart_attack . He speaks about Lancaster with great warmth , affection and nostalgia . &quot; I wrote a chapter just on our relationship and how I felt about Burt and a lot of stuff I don ' t think people had known , &quot; he says . &quot; We did , like , seven movies together . We did song_and_dance routines . We did a play in San Francisco for six weeks . We fought and argued . He was a great guy . A lot of people didn ' t realize it , but Burt was a big opera buff . He loved opera . I always said , ' I am going_to expose you , Burt . You are a big tough_guy and I am going_to expose you as the intellectual you really are. ' &quot; Douglas looks wistfully around at the film posters that adorn the walls : &quot; The Bad and the Beautiful , &quot; &quot; Seven Days in May , &quot; in which he co-starred with Lancaster , &quot; Spartacus &quot; and &quot; The Last Sunset. &quot; &quot; I don ' t have anything about movies in my house , &quot; Douglas says . &quot; Here I have all_the posters . But when I was writing this article about Burt Lancaster , I looked_around and began to see people ( who I worked with ) who are dead : Gloria Grahame , Gilbert Roland , Dick Powell , Ava Gardner , Burt Lancaster , Laurence Olivier , Rock Hudson , Charles Laughton . It was like the roll-call of the dead . You think , where did all_the years go ? How long have I been around ? He pauses . &quot; I enjoy writing . You are just digging inside of yourself and talking_about things. &quot; Douglas also is a recipient this year of the prestigious Kennedy Center Honors , along with director Harold Prince , folk_singer Pete Seeger , soul diva Aretha Franklin and composer Morton Gould . CBS will telecast the Washington awards ceremony , which was taped Dec . 4 , on Dec . 28 . &quot; What I have said about ( the honor ) is you don ' t have to say anything , &quot; says Douglas , who received the American Film Institute ' s Lifetime Achievement Award three years ago . &quot; You are just properly modest and you sit in the presidential box and watch the show , &quot; he says with a smile . &quot; You don ' t have to worry about making_out a suitable acceptance speech . It is a nice award . I keep kidding people , ' Don ' t you think I am much too young for this prestigious honor ? ' &quot; Receiving such honors has been a double-edged sword for Douglas . &quot; I have gotten several lifetime achievement awards and you say , ' Wait a minute ? Are you telling me it is all_over ? ' Come_on . I just did ' Take Me Home Again. ' I am going_to do a movie with Michael . I am writing another book . It ' s nice , but you wonder if they have looked_at my medical_records and said , ' We better give this guy an award fast. ' &quot; &quot; Take Me Home Again &quot; airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on NBC ; &quot; The Kennedy Center Honors : A Celebration of the Performing Arts &quot; airs Dec . 28 at 9 p.m. on CBS .</TEXT>
