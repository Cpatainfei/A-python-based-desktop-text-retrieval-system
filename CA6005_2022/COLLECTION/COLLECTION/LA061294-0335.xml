   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA UNVEILS PLAN TO CRACK_DOWN ON ORGANIZED CRIME ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : ESCALATING VIOLENCE PROMPTS MEASURES . THEY INCLUDE RETURN OF EX-KGB ' S SPECIAL INVESTIGATORS SQUAD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A day after President Boris N . Yeltsin demanded that Russia be cleansed of its &quot; criminal filth , &quot; the nation ' s top law_enforcement officials announced a $ 2.6-billion program Saturday to crack_down on organized_crime . The move follows a bloody spring of bombings , hijackings , drive-by_shootings , paid assassinations of business_leaders and unrelenting corruption that have undermined Russians ' fragile confidence in their 3-year-old government . Declaring that crime has reached &quot; catastrophic dimensions , &quot; the officials promised a series of countermeasures , including posting police escorts on trains to protect them from bandits ; allowing witnesses to give anonymous testimony against accused mobsters , and adopting sweeping revisions to Russia ' s Soviet-era criminal code . Some of the steps are likely to alarm civil_rights advocates , including the resurrection of the former KGB ' s squad of 700 to 800 special investigators and the creation of a new unit of elite crime fighters under the control of the Federal Counterintelligence Service , one of two successor agencies to the KGB . The Russian intelligence services had deliberately been denied such functions after the dreaded KGB was dismantled . Nevertheless , with crime and corruption rivaling economic hardship as Yeltsin ' s most serious political liability , the president has made_it clear that he wants action . &quot; Crime has become the scourge of Russia , &quot; Yeltsin said at a news_conference Friday . &quot; Criminal forces are trying to take_control of key positions in the economy and even make inroads into politics. &quot; Yeltsin said he will hold Interior Minister Viktor F . Yerin and Federal Counterintelligence Service chief Sergei V . Stepashin personally responsible_for winning the war on crime . On Saturday , in a rare show of cooperation , Yerin and Stepashin jointly announced the new anti-crime program along with Justice Minister Yuri K . Kalmykov , acting Prosecutor General Alexei Ilyushenko and deputy head of the National Security_Council Vladimir Rubanov . But the officials offered only tentative comments on how the new crackdown will differ from previous , unsuccessful efforts to curb crime and corruption . Asked about the role of the new &quot; directorate of active operations , &quot; Stepashin responded , &quot; When it begins to function , you will learn about it. &quot; The officials did promise a sweeping revision of the criminal code to close some of the loopholes in the Soviet-era legal_system . A draft law has been approved by the government and will be submitted later this month to the Duma , or lower house of Parliament , for approval . The new law would for the first time allow prosecution of those who plan or order crimes , making_it easier to target mob bosses who leave the dirty work to their subordinates . And police will be allowed to try to infiltrate criminal groups , a tactic that is now forbidden . &quot; Our legislation is hopelessly outdated , &quot; Yerin said . After decades of isolation , Russian law_enforcement is now eager to learn from other countries that have more experience in combatting organized crime . Russia ' s anarchic new economy and its archaic banking , bookkeeping , taxation and legal_systems have created fertile conditions for money-laundering , drug trafficking , racketeering and theft of state property through abuse of a massive privatization program . But what most disturbs Russians is the violent crime that has burst into the streets of once-serene Moscow and St . Petersburg . Last week , for example , a car_bomb exploded in downtown Moscow , injuring the head of the LogoVAZ auto_manufacturer and killing his driver . Six passersby were hospitalized . &quot; I just can ' t believe this is happening in Moscow in broad daylight , &quot; said Lyudmilla V . Sardzheveladze , 80 , whose living room was carpeted in shattered glass from the explosion , which blew_out six stories of windows in her apartment_building . A Moscow resident since 1939 , she said the only other bomb she has ever seen was dropped near her home by the Germans during World_War_II . &quot; When I heard this explosion , my first thought was , ' They ' re bombing us again ! ' &quot; she said . U.S. officials are also concerned about the criminalization of the Russian economy and the links that Russian organized crime groups have formed with fellow gangsters in the West . At Russia ' s invitation , the FBI plans to open a branch office in Moscow next month . Yerin said the FBI and Russian law_enforcement officials already have about 30 joint investigations under way .</TEXT>
