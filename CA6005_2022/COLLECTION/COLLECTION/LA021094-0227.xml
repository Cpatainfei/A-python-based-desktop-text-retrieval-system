   <HEADLINE> YEAR OF THE DOG IS USHERED IN WITH A WHIMPER ; CHINA : CITIZENS USED FIRECRACKERS FOR 1 # 000 YEARS TO CELEBRATE THE NEW YEAR WITH A BANG . OFFICIALS NOW SAY that ' s TOO DANGEROUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every year for at least 1 # 000 years , dating_from the discovery of gunpowder in the Sung Dynasty , the Chinese greeted their New Year with a deafening roar of firecrackers , the bigger and louder the better . In economic boom times like those of recent years , the streets of the towns and cities were ankle deep in the red wrappers of spent firecrackers , some the size of soup cans , by the next morning . In the afterglow of such explosive evenings , a sulfurous haze blanketed the streets . But at midnight Wednesday in Beijing , the Year of the Dog came_in with a whimper , not a bang . Only a_few stray detonations punctuated the still night . Even the politically rebellious university district in the capital ' s northwest corner was_quiet except for distant rumblings from suburbs outside the Beijing district . Disturbed by what they claimed was an alarming number of injuries in past celebrations , many major cities banned firecrackers this year . But the ban was not universal . In Shanghai , the neon-lit main_street , Nanjing Road , was a cacophony of revelry and minor explosions . Officials in the freewheeling business capital refused to go_along with the prohibition . In stark contrast , it was an eerie , nearly silent night Wednesday in Beijing . Officials attempted to compensate for the absence of pyrotechnics by staging lavish television specials and festive street shows , some performed by costumed People ' s Liberation Army troops . To emphasize the public safety aspect of the firecracker ban , Beijing Television Network aired a program that featured interviews with ophthalmologists and people blinded or maimed by fireworks accidents . One segment focused_on a 10-year-old boy who lost four fingers in a firecracker explosion . &quot; Please don ' t take my picture until my fingers grow back , &quot; the boy begged the camera operator . The Beijing Evening News newspaper published a glowing article about Dong Shuchen , an elderly woman who voluntarily handed_over to the Zhanlanlu police firecrackers she had purchased to celebrate her son ' s marriage during the three-day Spring Festival holiday , as the New Year is known here , that begins today . Historically , many Chinese believed that the staccato explosions of fireworks frightened off ghosts and evil_spirits . Firecrackers are traditional at nearly every festive or auspicious occasion , and for the Chinese New Year , families traditionally spent the equivalent of $ 20 on them . But the newspaper said Dong gladly abandoned tradition for civil responsibility . &quot; My family should take the lead in obeying the regulation , &quot; the newspaper quoted her as saying . &quot; We will be just as happy at my son ' s wedding_ceremony . I felt good about handing_over the firecrackers. &quot; Shopkeepers attempted to put a brave face on the money lost from the firecracker ban . Fu Gongshen , manager of the Chaoyan Yuanfan Sundry Goods store in East Beijing , said his business dropped $ 10 # 000 because of the ban . But he said he was glad to be relieved of the worry that one of the firecrackers he sold might injure a customer . &quot; Last year I was sitting on the edge of a volcano of worry , &quot; he said . &quot; This year I am happy to take the economic loss in exchange for the social benefits. &quot; Not everyone , of course , was happy about the ban . Two boys , their faces covered with sticky sugar from the candied_apples they were munching , watched with bored expressions as army acrobats performed at the Chaoyan District New Year ' s show staged by local officials to make_up for the missing fireworks . The two boys , ages 13 and 14 , reckoned that they would watch television and play video_games instead of igniting firecrackers . But in the mind of the elder boy , a plump child with a mischievous look , the ban was a real shame . &quot; We really liked firecrackers , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s colorful , and you can really make a lot of noise. &quot;</TEXT>
