   <TEXT> There is something almost mystical about good abstract_art . Like a riveting stage performance , it projects an aura of intense conviction and concentration . While some abstraction makes a purely sensory or intellectual appeal , other works contain a palpable spiritual content . But the stakes are very high : Claim a spiritual basis for your art , and you will be held_up to the standards of the world ' s masters , whether they be the anonymous craftsmen of an African village or such Western modernist heroes as Wassily Kandinsky , Mark Rothko or John McLaughlin . At the Laguna Art Museum , where &quot; Augustus Vincent Tack : Landscape of the Spirit &quot; is the centerpiece through May 8 , two smaller shows display other attempts to engage matters of the spirit . While Tack drew_on Asian art_forms for his abstracted landscapes of the 1920s and ' 30s , a later generation of artists was intrigued with the intersection of nature , Eastern religions and the gestural invention that was the legacy of Abstract_Expressionism . Unfortunately , most of the art in &quot; Vertigo Journey : The Early Assemblage of Seymour Locks , 1949-1959 &quot; and &quot; Toward Stillness &quot; ( both through May 1 ) falls far short of the mystical ideal . Seymour Locks ' nail pieces from the ' 50s seem obsessive , but in a studiously organized way . Hundreds of nails driven into redwood and eucalyptus stumps form undulating patterns that variously resemble cell colonies , wind-blown stretches of beach fence or the shimmering scales of a small reptile . The artist is quoted in an authoritative catalogue essay by Bruce Nixon , editor of Artweek magazine , as saying that these pieces are &quot; not embroidered surfaces . . . not decoration. &quot; In Locks ' view , the sculptures are landscapes and meditations -- &quot; places &quot; containing &quot; energy &quot; that the nails tap into and bring_to the surface . It must have been immensely satisfying to make the repetitive hammering movements and to watch patterns of overlapping or carefully spaced nailheads take_shape , sparked here and there with snarls of twisted wire , bits of hammered foil or tufts of scrap metal . But style is a fickle thing : Decades later , the pieces belie Locks ' claims . Rather than tapping reserves of psychic power , in the manner of a West_African fetish , Locks ' sculptures in this show have the earnestly inventive quality of eccentric crafts projects . ( In fact , the earliest nail pieces represented the artist ' s first , unschooled attempt at making sculpture after years of making Abstract Expressionist paintings. ) The patterns are too predictable , too small-scale and tidily decorative to evoke mysterious or powerful forces . If Locks is a shaman , as Nixon affectionately dubs him , his powers seem awfully limited . As the inheritor of a Dada sensibility , he seems lacking in inventiveness . Acting director Susan M . Anderson , the show ' s curator , perhaps best defines his work in her catalogue essay by comparing it with the abstract paintings of the Los Angeles-based Dynaton group of the 1940s and ' 50s , which turned landscape features into &quot; diagrams of energy patterns -- moving whorls of animated dots. &quot; In other assemblages from the period , Locks incorporated such industrial materials as a mop head , a fire sprinkler or car_horns in studied ways that read as consciously &quot; aesthetic &quot; rather than subversively psychological . In &quot; Excavation , &quot; from 1959 , Locks offers something at once funky and expressive : an open box covered only with a layer of resin , through which the viewer can spy what appears to be a tiny black bar stool marooned in a grotto of shimmering silver walls -- perhaps a vision of urban hell . The up-and-coming Funk generation -- including Wally Hedrick ( one of Locks ' students ) , Wallace Berman and Jay de Feo -- would push Locks ' experiments much further into the realm of the weird and the personal . The spiritual component in their art , however , would be more elusive and subversive , streaked with black humor and an anarchic view of contemporary life . * A shared love for the rural life knitted together the four artist friends in &quot; Toward Stillness. &quot; Joachim Smith was in his early 30s when he started teaching at Cal State Fullerton in 1962 , where Tom Holste , Bob Schmid and Doug Smith were his students a_few years later . It was the heyday of Pop Art in the United States , and &quot; fetish finish &quot; in Los Angeles , but -- as Joachim Smith writes in a gracefully impassioned essay -- his group &quot; did not want things too slick or too easy , much less too L.A. We did not want our work too urban , street-smart and glib . Above ( or below ) all , we did not want to be ' tough-minded ' so_much as grounded. &quot; What they did want , he writes , was to examine such things as &quot; the importance of gesture &quot; and to experience the rhythm of &quot; moving through the canvas space in small , densely layered increments. &quot; They drew inspiration from many sources , including the Orange County landscape ; Eastern religions ; nature_worship in North and South_American cultures ; the directness of painter John McLaughlin , their Orange County neighbor ; the &quot; white writing &quot; of Northwestern painter Mark Tobey , and the soft grids of painter Agnes Martin , who lived_in New Mexico for many years . Joachim Smith was by far the most successful of the four in setting_up a resonance between marks on paper and things of the spirit . Each of the large paintings from the ' 60s features a densely intricate graphite web bordered by crisp vertical lines , on an all-over painted ground that grows paler near the edges of the canvas . With titles like &quot; Dhuma Marga ( Path of Smoke ) , &quot; these works convey a meditative quality without visual content , an alpha state that one might achieve by staring fixedly at a wisp of smoke . The focused yet obsessive energy of the hand that drew the webs transmits itself to the viewer as a persistent yet non-specific force , the visual equivalent of a continuous low hum . But the cautious vertical framing lines in the paintings leach away this intensity , reminding the viewer that the paintings are really just arbitrary human designs . Smith , who is a serious student of Zen philosophy , probably had reasons for organizing his works in this manner . But it is possible to confuse zealous interpretation of an idea with the most effective way to convey it visually . To these eyes , the paintings would be far more powerful without the fussy parentheses , as trails of energy knitting themselves into cosmic patterns . Holste ' s untitled airbrush paintings from the ' 60s envelop the viewer in what appear to be out-of-focus patterns of light and dark . Depending_on the colors Holste employed , these giant swaths look rather like hugely magnified views of water or sky or the effect you get when you squeeze your eyes tightly . The effect is dreamlike in a laid-back way . The paintings conjure neither the stillness of the void nor the roiling eventfulness of a drug trip . There ' s no nirvana here , no feeling of discovery , just a warm bath in sense-surround . Striated with a palette_knife and sprinkled with mica chips , Doug Smith ' s paintings are totally bound up in surface effects . Although the all-over glitter effect occasionally resembles the paintings of Mary Corse , it lacks the tantalizingly austere radiance of her canvases . Smith ' s strategies seem constrained and dull , removed even from convincing evocations of landscape formations . Schmid ' s paintings unfortunately resemble painted gift_wrap . Gluey skeins of color are used in a predictable way to represent the seasons ( &quot; Indian_Summer , &quot; &quot; Fall ' s Anticipation &quot; ) . Each canvas sports a contrasting horizontal color_bar in the approximate position of a letter slot in a door . It might have been intended to represent a moment of insight in the continuum of perception , but the overall effect is too glib to evoke a meditative tone . The show also documents how the four artists ' styles have become more literal , sometimes tediously so , over the years . Bolton Colburn , the museum ' s curator of collections , tactfully remarks in a wall statement that &quot; these works may seem less than aesthetically viable , but for these artists , the art world itself had become less than viable. &quot; Schmid turned_to amateurish compositions incorporating dime-store lizards , shells and other objects from the natural world , Holste concentrated_on painting rocks , and Doug Smith ' s recent work includes a dated-looking painting of eucalyptus leaves silhouetted against the sky . The best of these recent works in the show are Joachim Smith ' s elaborate pen-and-ink studies of falling birds , symbolic of the increasing displacement of the natural world . Passionately and minutely observed , the birds sometimes suffer the additional indignity of a light dusting of gold_leaf . ( Gold in a Tibetan painting is one thing ; in a contemporary art context , however , the immediate reference is glitz , not glory. ) There may be many roads to enlightenment , but few that lead to favorable evaluation by the powers that be in the art world . The geometric paintings of McLaughlin from the 1950s and ' 60s -- also based on Zen philosophy -- are now considered seminal modernist works , while the art of the four men in this show has never been widely honored . Joachim Smith , who celebrates the &quot; bodily experience &quot; of making art as primary in his essay , criticizes McLaughlin ' s paintings ( and the work of the &quot; light and space &quot; artists of the 1970s ) as &quot; generally mechanical , even remote , &quot; with &quot; concept and / or dramatic effect &quot; superseding &quot; the intimate personal touch. &quot; Particularly in the context of work inspired by a global philosophical outlook , this carping seems small-minded . Why is a physical reaction somehow more genuine than a mental reaction ? Why is the artist ' s visceral experience in making the work somehow more important than the viewer ' s mental activity in_viewing it ? Being able to trace the movements of the artist ' s hand can be deeply satisfying ( in fact , brush strokes are visible in the McLaughlin paintings I ' ve seen ) , but surely a Zen follower could make a case for , say , a James Turrell light piece that depends largely on the vagaries of a natural_phenomenon rather than fallible human desires . * It should be noted that both shows are accompanied by publications that add insight and context -- an emphasis on education and documentation that has become a hallmark of Laguna Art Museum shows during the past few years . One particularly imaginative format -- Joachim Smith ' s handwritten essay for &quot; Toward Stillness , &quot; reproduced on sheets of stapled gray paper -- serves as proof that elegant and useful guides can also be cheap and casual . * &quot; Vertigo Journey : The Early Assemblage of Seymour Locks , 1949-1965 &quot; and &quot; Toward Stillness : Joachim Smith , Tom Holste , Doug Smith and Bob Schmid &quot; remain through May 1 at the Laguna Art Museum , 307 Cliff Drive , Laguna Beach . Hours : 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday . Admission : $ 4 adults , $ 3 seniors and students , free for children under 12 . ( 714 ) 494-8971 .</TEXT>
