   <HEADLINE> U.S. WILL IMPOSE TRADE SANCTIONS AGAINST TAIWAN TO PROTECT WILDLIFE ; ASIA : BAN IS PROMPTED BY THE NATION ' S FAILURE TO HALT THE USE OF TIGER AND RHINOCEROS PRODUCTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the first American trade sanctions aimed at protecting endangered species , the Clinton_Administration said Monday that it will impose penalties against Taiwan for its failure to halt the use of tiger and rhinoceros products . The sanctions , the first against Taiwan for any reason , will bar American imports of wildlife products from the Asian_nation . Their use reflects the growing attention being paid to environmental issues in world trade . &quot; The world ' s tiger and rhinoceros populations remain gravely endangered and will likely be extinct in the next two to five years if the trade_in their parts and products , fueled by market demand in consuming countries , is not eliminated , &quot; President Clinton said in a letter to Congress on Monday announcing the decision . The import ban affects not just products that use tiger and rhinoceros parts but all Taiwanese products made from wild species , including lizard , crocodile and snakeskin shoes and coral and mollusk jewelry . The tiger and rhinoceros parts are believed_in Asia to have medicinal and aphrodisiac properties and are found in pharmacies there . Details of the trade sanctions will be prepared by the office of the U.S. trade representative . Administration officials said they will cut_off about $ 20 million in trade with Taiwan , the estimated value of the tiger and rhino parts . While the sanctions imposed to protect wildlife are unprecedented , they will affect less than 0.1 % of Taiwan ' s exports to the United States , which are valued at $ 25 billion . Citing legislation approved in 1978 but never invoked , the Administration first warned Taiwan and China a year ago that unless they came_up with plans to reduce trade_in parts cut_out of endangered species , the United States would invoke sanctions . While finding that China had made progress , although stronger actions were needed , an international committee on endangered species determined that Taiwan had failed to meet even minimum requirements . Clinton said China had &quot; consolidated much of its stocks of rhinoceros and tiger parts and products , &quot; and had &quot; used radio , television , newspaper and poster announcements -- as well as burnings of rhino horn and tiger bone -- to educate its population on new laws and the need to protect wildlife. &quot; As a result of such progress , import prohibitions on China were not warranted , the President said , avoiding exacerbation of the Administration ' s deep disputes with Beijing over human_rights . * Clinton had been under pressure from several members of the House and Senate to take action against both Taiwan and China . In a March 18 letter to the President , 39 lawmakers said China &quot; has been unable to account_for over three tons of registered rhinoceros horn and apparently allowed the export of over one ton of tiger bone to Korea &quot; after a ban on such exports went_into effect . Sen . James M . Jeffords ( R-Vt. ) , who led the effort , expressed approval Monday , and an aide said the senator agreed that China ' s progress had been sufficient to remove the immediate threat of sanctions . Clinton ' s decision , Jeffords said , &quot; may be the one step necessary to halt the rapid decline in rhinoceros and tiger populations and protect them from inevitable extinction. &quot; Whether the measures taken by Clinton will be sufficient remains uncertain , because there is considerable economic pressure to keep_up the harvest of the dwindling supplies . Tiger parts can bring_up to $ 25 # 000 and crushed rhino horn brings varying prices , said Ken Connolly , Jefford ' s aide specializing in environmental issues . Connolly said no more_than 5 # 000 tigers remain in Asia -- a decline of 95 % in the 20th Century -- and three of eight known tiger species are extinct . The White_House said the rhinoceros population has declined 90 % over the past 23 years , to a present level of 10 # 000 . The Administration ' s action drew praise from environmentalists , who also said more pressure is needed . The African Wildlife Foundation encouraged Clinton to move against others trading in rhino and tiger parts , including Hong Kong , North and South_Korea and Yemen . Samuel LaBudde of the San Francisco-based Earth Island Institute said the sanctions will be &quot; perhaps the most significant event for species protection to occur in 20 years. &quot; He said that unless China moves effectively , the remaining 150 to 200 Siberian tigers could be extinct after next winter .</TEXT>
