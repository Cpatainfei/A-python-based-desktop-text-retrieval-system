   <HEADLINE> BODY WATCH ; CRUNCH APPEAL ; HOLD THE PUDDING AND PORRIDGE , AND PASS THE POTATO_CHIPS AND POPCORN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Chicago dietitian Alicia Moag-Stahlberg is under stress and hungry , she ' ll usually snack sensibly on low-fat popcorn or pretzels . But sometimes nothing will do but extra crunchy shoestring potatoes -- even though they pack a wallop of fat and salt . &quot; It ' s not just a regular potato_chip , &quot; she explains . &quot; These shoestring potatoes crunch more. &quot; And therein lies the appeal for Moag-Stahlberg and millions of other noisy noshers : They ' re hooked on crunch appeal . While there ' s not a lot of science behind why we crave crunchy foods , there are several reasonable theories . Crunchy foods can ease tensions after a long day , says Elizabeth Ward , a staff dietitian for the Harvard Community Health Plan , Boston , and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Assn . &quot; Think_about what it feels_like to chew something very crunchy , &quot; she suggests . &quot; Compare an apple to applesauce . The apple takes so_much more work to grind it with your teeth that you are using those muscles in your face that you may tense_up during the day. &quot; Tense people can also feel the effects of stress in their neck and shoulder areas , she adds , and eating something crunchy might help relax those muscles . Ward adopted the tension-reducing theory after her sister-in-law explained her fondness for rice cakes by saying , &quot; It just tastes so good to chew. &quot; Although crunchy foods aren ' t meant as a substitute for stress-reduction classes or an hour with a good therapist , Dr. Mark Goulston says the tension-reducing theory makes_sense . &quot; When the world bites you , you want to bite back , &quot; says the Santa Monica psychiatrist . While there is scientific literature on cravings , &quot; there is not a lot of science about why one craves crunchy foods and another craves smoother foods , &quot; Moag-Stahlberg says . &quot; But we eat for a lot of reasons . Hunger is one of the lower ones ( on the list ) . Sensory satisfaction is way up high , and part of that is not only taste but texture . People like in-your-face eating experiences. &quot; Crunchiness can also enhance the sensory experience of eating , according to food chemists , who , of course , don ' t call it crunch . &quot; Food chemists talk_about fractureability , &quot; explains Susan Brewer , an associate_professor of foods and nutrition at the University of Illinois , Urbana . &quot; Think_of hard_candy . When you put it between your back_teeth and bear_down , it fractures and falls_away from the pressure rather than compressing or smashing or sticking_to your teeth . Normally , that ( fractureability ) is one of the main aspects of crunchiness -- the ability to fracture off cleanly , as opposed to sticking_to the teeth. &quot; And let ' s not overlook the auditory dimension of The Crunch . ( &quot; For some eaters , sound is very important , &quot; Brewer says. ) Or its place as a diet aid . &quot; Good crunchy foods , in_general , are high in fiber and are filling , &quot; Ward says . &quot; They take longer to chew than other foods . You feel_like you ' ve really eaten something. &quot; But it might not be a good idea for dieters to rely only on fat-free crunchy foods , particularly because part of the appeal of crunchy foods might be the fat and salt . Moag-Stahlberg suggests indulging in small portions of crunchy foods with fat and salt , satisfying the crunch / salt / fat urge in one fell swoop . Better to have a_few crackers with salt and fat and feel full than to have a half-gallon of air-popped corn and still feel deprived . Crunchy foods could also be a boon for dental health , although those with jaw problems are wise_to avoid them . &quot; There are certain crunchy foods that act_as detergents on the teeth -- your natural plaque removers , like fresh fruits and vegetables , &quot; says Linda Niessen , professor of dentistry at Baylor College of Dentistry , Dallas . But crunchy refined foods -- because of added ingredients such_as sugars and complex starches -- could promote tooth_decay . Crunching ice is discouraged , Niessen says , because &quot; it can cause microscopic cracks in the enamel , which can weaken the tooth. &quot; Biting down too forcefully on peanut_brittle , hard_candy or other hard foods can harm the teeth , too . If crunch adds variety and pleasure , go_for it , nutritionists advise . Says Ward : &quot; Because we get hung_up on nutrients , we tend to overlook that eating is also a psychological experience . And it has to be satisfying on so many levels for people to feel nourished. &quot;</TEXT>
