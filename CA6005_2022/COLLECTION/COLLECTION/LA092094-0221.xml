   <HEADLINE> WEST VALLEY FOCUS : TARZANA ; GROUP GIVES BLIND READERS A HELPING HAND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It all began in Jean Norris ' kitchen more_than 35 years ago when Norris was looking_for a way for blind parents to read to their sighted children and vice versa . It has grown_into the nonprofit American Action Fund for Blind Children and Adults , which is housed in a 7 # 000-square-foot building in Tarzana . The fund produces books , calendars and a newspaper for the blind . As Norris tells it , in 1958 she met a blind mother whose sighted children couldn ' t understand why she couldn ' t read to them . In her kitchen , Norris took the children ' s books apart , added Braille text on separate pages and then re-bound the pages into books consisting_of alternating Braille and printed pages . That way , sighted and blind people could read the books together . Norris named the finished product Twin Vision Books . From books , the mainly volunteer organization went_on to produce a Braille newspaper and Braille calendars that are sent to subscribers throughout the world . In 1964 , Norris , with the help of volunteer transcribers , began to publish Hotline for the Deaf-Blind . The Braille newspaper is sent to the deaf-blind in the United States and 40 foreign countries . The first Braille calendars printed by Norris ' group were intended as Christmas_presents , but many other blind people began requesting the 6 1 / 2-by-6-inch calendars . &quot; In 1965 , the only Braille calendars available were big and bulky and contained philosophy and religious things , &quot; Norris said . Today , her group produces about 30 # 000 calendars a year . Although the organization ' s library is computerized and there are four state-of-the-art Braille presses , the bulk of the transcribing for the books is still done_by volunteers working_at home with Braille machines . Norris said that more_than 100 volunteer transcribers receive printed books by mail , transcribe them into Braille and return the finished pages to be bound . The Braille translations remain as close to the originals as possible , she said . Among the books produced by Norris ' group is a series with raised illustrations , such_as &quot; The Wonderful World of Trees , &quot; which allows blind children to picture the images . Another example features raised images of dinosaurs . About 500 copies of each illustrated book are produced , and copies are sent to every school for the blind in the United States as well as regional lending_libraries . Schools often use the American Action Fund library as a resource for blind children , particularly for supplemental reading materials . Norris said the organization conducts tours at its facility and is supported by donations of books as well as cash gifts . RAY PATTERSON</TEXT>
