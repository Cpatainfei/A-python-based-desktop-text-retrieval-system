   <HEADLINE> TO CATCH A WHALE ; WITH HANDMADE SEALSKIN BOATS AND SNOWMOBILES , WITH 19TH-CENTURY HARPOONS AND CELLULAR PHONES , ALASKA ' S INUPIAT KEEP ALIVE THE MOST PROFOUND RITE OF THEIR ANCIENT CULTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Finally , after a long arctic winter , the vast polar ice_pack cracks and slowly opens_up along Alaska ' s north coast , exposing a thin ribbon of ocean between two vast frozen plates . Spring is the season of wonder here : The temperature has risen to 5 degrees , the wind blusters out of the east with the distant tease of more warmth to come , and darkness has lifted -- the sun bobs in the sky 23 hours a day . Now , as they have throughout their history , Inupiat Eskimos advance onto the blue-white shore ice in a ritual of renewal , affirmation , hope and blood . They have come_to hunt the bowhead_whale . George Ahmaogak faces the ocean , the hood of his parka ringed with a ruff of wolverine fur and his almond eyes alive_with anticipation . He grips my arm with a heavy-gloved hand and nods toward the horizon . &quot; Agvik , &quot; he whispers . &quot; Big one ! &quot; Out in the water , a shiny wet-black hump breaks the surface , a spout of gray steam emerges with a hiss , and an otherworldly low-pitched song vibrates the air around us . A shiver runs_down my neck . &quot; that ' s a * % * big whale , &quot; says Ahmaogak , peppering his speech , as usual , with the unprintable . A smile breaks_out on his ruddy face . A smile with bite to it , the smile of a hunter who has sighted his prey . At 45 , Ahmaogak ( pronounced Ah-MA-walk ) is the charismatic three-term mayor of Alaska ' s North Slope Borough , the northernmost municipal_government in the United States . But more important , at least when the arctic whales migrate , he is one of a select group of men and women known as whaling captains . He and the others shoulder the responsibility of providing traditional food and keeping alive the most profound rite of Inupiat culture : the catching of the whales . This is hunting on an epic scale . Hundreds of villagers are involved in the chase and conquest of one of the largest animals in the world . And there is no such thing as an observer . You are part of the crew or you are off the ice . At Ahmaogak ' s signal , five whalers and I grab axes and chop a trail through blocky ice ridges between camp and the open water so Ahmaogak ' s two boats can be skidded to the edge and launched . One is an umiaq , a paddle craft out of the Stone_Age made of laced sealskin , the other an 18-foot aluminum skiff with an 80-horsepower outboard_motor . This is all-out work , and the crew breathes long streams of steam into the cold air . As ice cakes my beard , sweat runs_down my back under my heavy parka . Ahmaogak , as befits his captain ' s role , supervises . &quot; How long do you think you ' d last if you went_into the water ? &quot; he asks me at one point . &quot; Just seconds , &quot; I hazard . &quot; This whole_thing is_full of danger , &quot; he says grimly . &quot; And you have to know what the * % * you ' re doing. &quot; I , of course , have no idea what I ' m doing . I put my head down and chop . Another whale -- closer this time , huge -- surfaces and blows . Pssssshhhh ! I chop faster . &quot; Pretty soon , we go_out there . Then it ' s boom boom , &quot; Ahmaogak says to no one in particular . He flashes his teeth in another wild smile . FOR CENTURIES , GEORGE AHMAOGAK ' S ANCESTORS HAVE LIVED AND whaled in the land above the Arctic_Circle . Anthropologists believe the Inupiat are the descendants , along with other Eskimo groups , of the second wave of migrants to cross the Bering Sea about 4000 BC . Early evidence of their whaling skills dates_from at least AD 800 . By the 1800s , when Europeans finally ventured through the Bering Strait , these Eskimos were the best sea-mammal hunters on the planet , and their most formidable prey was the bowhead . Like the buffalo for the Plains Indian , the whale was the stuff of survival and social_structure for the Inupiat . Whale meat was their food ; whale_oil , their source of heat and light . The Inupiat commonly lived_in separate family groups , but for the whaling effort , they pooled their resources and talents , with umiaq owners and the best whalers as leaders . Their most important social_gatherings were celebrations of the hunt . Today in Barrow , and in seven other villages that dot the 89 # 000-square-mile North Slope Borough , the Inupiat continue to practice &quot; subsistence &quot; hunting -- and the whale remains their most prized prey . The whalers are still the community leaders . During my visit , the Borough Assembly couldn ' t muster a quorum at its monthly meeting in Barrow -- too many of its members were out on the ice , captaining whale boats . And , as they have through the ages , entire villages still assemble on the ice to haul in a whale and celebrate its capture . To outsiders , it can seem a curious world . In 1994 , these Eskimos take Hawaii vacations and own big-screen TVs . They wear starched white shirts and drive fancy pickups . Some are businessmen , and all_of them are shareholders of the Arctic Slope Regional Corp. , which was established by the federal Alaskan Native_Land Claims Settlement Act in 1972 . Thanks to the tax levies they collect on the Prudhoe Bay oil fields , which lie on their ancestral lands , and the corporation ' s investments , families of the North Slope Borough have the 29th highest median income in the United States . But they also must spend a lot : A bag of Chee-Toes costs $ 4.99 in Barrow . And what other jurisdiction with so few citizens -- 6 # 300 total , 70 % of whom are native -- pays its chief elected official $ 160 # 000 a year ? For the Inupiat , however , dollar prosperity is no substitute for whaling ; it is a means to achieve it . Captains pony_up thousands for the canvas_tents , snowmobiles ( which the Alaskans call snow machines ) , food , fuel , boats , weapons and radios . More important , in the late 1970s the Inupiat applied their new wealth to scientific studies and international lobbying , beating_back angry attempts by environmentalists to eliminate the native hunt along with all other forms of whaling . Now , the International Whaling Commission grants the Inupiat an annual quota of bowhead , based on the number scientists judge can be harvested without further jeopardizing this endangered species . Today , with their prehistoric skin boats and turn-of-the-century harpoons , with their snow machines and rescue helicopters , with their old razor-sharp pole knives and fur clothing , with their briefcases and stock portfolios , the Inupiat Eskimos hover between the past and the present . Holding onto the hunt , they believe , provides the ballast that keeps them upright in the late 20th Century . &quot; It ' s our food , our culture , our tradition , our heritage , &quot; Ahmaogak says simply . &quot; Without whaling there would be no purpose to Barrow , &quot; says Glenn Roy Edwards , Ahmaogak ' s second in command and a jet-set businessman with the Arctic Slope Regional Corp . &quot; I depend_on my job , I like my job . But if it came_down to a choice , I ' d leave it to come_out here and go whaling . I am first a whaler. &quot; &quot; GET_ON . YOU ' LL HAVE TO STEER THE SLED. &quot; &quot; Me ? &quot; A resupply party is about to depart Barrow for Ahmaogak ' s whaling camp , about 10 miles out on the shore ice . &quot; Might as well learn now , &quot; I ' m told . In coastal Barrow , all_the streets are gravel , and those that lead to the ocean are not impeded by stop signs . We have driven_off the end of one of them . In summer , we would be_on an Arctic_Ocean beach . Today our caravan of three snow machines is aimed north on the ice . One of them tows a heavy wooden sled . &quot; OK , &quot; I say , &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; You ' ll see. &quot; I grab the back of the sled and position my feet on the runners . An hour later , after bouncing across fractured shadowy white and aquamarine ice , I have become a sled steerer . Or at least I was able to hang_on . Winding through a two-story-tall pressure ridge , where shifting ice plates have collided and formed a mini-mountain range , we come screaming into the camp . It is pitched_in what might be called a flat meadow of ice , lightly dusted with dry snow . Ahmaogak and his crew set it up a_few days ago , when the ice first began to break_up . It holds as_many as 10 whalers -- the crew waxes and wanes with the press of outside business and the presence or absence of whales . At the moment , there are six of us packed into the camp ' s one plywood-floored 10-by-12 canvas_tent . Outside , an umiaq and an aluminum boat rest_on sleds next to crates of supplies and fuel . Everything is camouflaged white . Whales are known to be spooked by colors . High-powered rifles are slung casually on snow machines and propped against the tent . This is polar_bear country , and polar_bears aren ' t spooked by much of anything . A quarter-mile away , across much thinner &quot; young &quot; ice , is the crack where the polar pack begins to recede . Depending_on the wind and ocean_currents , this &quot; lead &quot; of water can grow to almost three miles wide , only to close right back_up hours later . Through this lead , the bowheads are migrating northeast from their winter grounds in the Bering Sea to their summer range north of the Canadian Yukon in the Beaufort Sea . With the ice in front of us constantly moving , the landscape changes as if in a time-lapse movie . Watch carefully and you can see floes tugged this way and that . Ten minutes later , it ' s all different . The ice we are camped on could break_loose at any time and join this flotilla . For the next seven days , we will rarely take_off our boots and never remove our clothes , always ready to dash for safety . As the newcomer , I am the lowest person in the crew hierarchy ; never mind that I am also the oldest and city-softest . I am assigned to chop and melt ice for fresh_water , make the coffee -- endless pots of coffee -- do the dishes , help cook , chop trail , steer sleds . Even the children -- apprentice whalers -- outrank me . I have lots of questions . Like , how do I get fresh_water from a sheet of frozen sea ice ? &quot; that ' s old ice there , the salt has leached out , &quot; Ahmaogak points to a nearby jumble of clear ice blocks with slightly rounded edges . &quot; Now that , that is sea ice . No good. &quot; He points to another pile of younger ice farther away with sharper corners and a bluish cast . It is still filled with salt . With no warning , he laughs -- a huge , contagious ha-ha-ha bellow , entirely free_of cynicism . I am , as he will tell me from time to time , &quot; a * % * dummy . Ha ha ha. &quot; I always laugh too . It ' s dinner time , and the lead is closed so the atmosphere at camp is relaxed . Ahmaogak ' s wife , Maggie , is demonstrating the two recipes in the Inupiat cookbook -- animal flesh , uncooked or boiled . She is executive_director of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission , the Inupiat organization that manages the annual whale hunts and lobbies Eskimo interests before international regulators . Outside the tent , she opens a wooden grub box and gathers an armload of frozen caribou chunks , each a square the size of a fist . Here , the outdoors serves as meat locker , and ice_chests are used to keep items such_as soda_pop from freezing . Tonight ' s menu turns_out to be , first , slivers of uncooked caribou shaved from the frozen chunks , then caribou soup -- boiled , half-raw meat in a liquid thickened with pancake mix because someone forgot to bring flour . A kerosene_heater and a one-burner propane stove keep the temperature as uncomfortably hot inside the tent as it is uncomfortably cold outside . Idle time is passed smoking cigarettes and cigars and making small_talk , half of it conducted in the language of the Inupiat , an emphatic monotone that few non-natives even attempt . We sit inside on storage boxes or on polar_bear rugs that double as sleeping mats . Always , someone is outside on watch , for bears , for signs that our ice is breaking_loose , for whales . I feel myself becoming lazy and comfortable . Ahmaogak , lounging on a bearskin , detects a shift in the wind and is suddenly worried . If the breeze strengthens from the north , the ice_pack in the distance could be propelled our way . &quot; That big ice out there starts moving , well , * % * . We gotta be ready to evacuate , or we ' ll end_up in Siberia . Ha ha ha. &quot; Ahmaogak , like many Inupiat , speaks English softly , like a whisper brought_up the register to normal volume , and gives equal emphasis to each syllable and every word , as if they are not to be expended lightly . In the arctic twilight that passes for night , six of us prepare to sleep together Eskimo style , under shared blankets . Wind rattles the canvas . &quot; * % * . I hope we don ' t have to evacuate at 4 a.m. , if this country goes_to hell , &quot; Ahmaogak says . The snoring that commences puts me at_ease . Better than listening for the ice to crack underneath me . Below that is 120 feet of frigid Arctic_Ocean . ALTHOUGH LEGEND TELLS OF BOWHEADS MORE THAN 60 FEET IN length , most of the large ones documented now are in the 50-foot range , and 30-footers are most commonly caught by the Inupiat . Chunkier than most whales , a big bowhead can weigh up_to 100 tons . These days , the International Whaling Commission estimates that the bowhead population hovers between 6 # 900 and 9 # 200 in the waters off Alaska , compared with an estimated 20 # 000 a century and a half ago . But bowheads are increasing in number , and the Barrow whalers have been allotted a 1994 spring quota of 18 whales , including those that are landed and those that are harpooned but lost . Bowheads are in the family of baleen_whales , with giant mouths in the shape of upside-down smiles . Instead of teeth , they have an arrangement of slats , like vertical Venetian_blinds . These baleens strain seawater for krill , the small shrimp that is the bowhead ' s main food . Bowhead eyes are down by their bellies , just at the corner of their mouths , and their breathing holes are atop a streamlined hump that forms the apex of a bow-like silhouette . Traveling on the edges and leads of the shifting polar ice , the bowhead has developed the ability to break_through ice two feet thick to reach air . ( Those were not bowheads but less-well-adapted gray_whales that made news around the world when they found themselves trapped under the ice near Barrow in 1988. ) No one knows how long bowheads live . But twice in recent years , the Inupiat have found ivory and jade harpoon tips embedded in the blubber of captured whales , which tantalizes the imagination : Such tips were last used on harpoons at the turn_of_the_century . Like other great whales , the bowhead was savaged in the 19th Century by commercial whaling . In 1848 , with other waters exhausted , Yankee whalers finally ventured north , through the strait between Siberia and Alaska , following the oil-rich bowheads . Within four years , there were 220 whaling ships in the Arctic , seeking oil and whalebone and bringing whites into everyday contact with the Eskimo . By the turn_of_the_century , the abundant bowhead was dying_out and so was commercial whaling . Though contact with whites diminished along with commercial whaling on Alaska ' s north coast , the Inupiat culture had already been changed irrevocably . Missionaries had arrived , white diseases had taken their toll , and the natives had begun to adopt new weapons and tools . Today in the Arctic , the traces of the Yankee whaling days are easy to see -- in the bloodlines of the Eskimos , for instance , and in the Christian invocation pronounced whenever a whale is taken . Nowhere is the link so apparent as in the primary tools used by the contemporary Inupiat to hunt bowheads . Unlike the harpoon cannons of the modern commercial whalers , the Inupiat harpoon is unchanged from those of Yankee whalers in the last century . Hand held and hand thrown , it carries a brass-tipped point and is fixed with a brass gun_barrel . The harpoons are still manufactured in New England , once the capital of the Yankee whalers . The attack commences like this : The boat is driven , or paddled , alongside a surfacing whale . In the bow , the harpooner , standing within a_few feet of the whale ' s back , jabs the animal . Once the tip of the harpoon is embedded in the blubber , it pulls_off from the 10-foot wooden harpoon shaft and triggers the firing of a &quot; bomb &quot; from the gun_barrel -- an exploding foot-long shell on a seven-second fuse . The harpoon tip is attached_to 33 fathoms of rope and a large float that can be followed when the whale dives . If the shell penetrates deeply into the animal and explodes near a vital_organ , the whale dies immediately . Other times , it can take a dozen or more bombs fired from a supplementary 50-pound brass shoulder gun . A minimum crew in a motor-powered aluminum boat is three people . With it , the strategy is to strike with speed . Success with the much more commonly used umiaq requires stealth and as_many as eight paddlers to follow and stay with the whale . Once a whale is struck , the chase can last for minutes or for hours . &quot; &amp; * , DID YOU SNORE ! &quot; Good . I must have slept after all . Ahmaogak fills a skillet with Crisco and fries egg_rolls for breakfast , a good-luck gift from a Filipino , a friend who runs a taxi in Barrow -- one of among the dozens of outsiders who drift here hoping to share_in the oil wealth . The coffee is rich and gritty , four handfuls of grounds dumped into a pot of melted ice . The tent fills with cigarette smoke and kerosene fumes . A portable receiver is tuned to Alaska Public Radio and a marine-band radio crackles with &quot; good_mornings &quot; as the whalers -- there are 44 crews on the ice from Barrow this year -- check_in with their families . I have never met an Eskimo who did not have at least one electronic receiver on at all times -- CB , TV , AM , FM -- often several together . And this year , Ahmaogak is experimenting with a new toy , a cellular_telephone . I ask about two Eskimo myths I remember from my childhood . Back in their more nomadic days , I was told , they left their elderly behind in the snow when they could not keep_up . True , says one . Not true , says another . How about the one where a male traveler was invited to sleep_with the Eskimo ' s wife ? Used to be , if he liked you . But the missionaries took_care of that . Ahmaogak has been described as &quot; the Eskimo John Kennedy , &quot; a man who inspires his people . He is like no politician I have ever met -- confident , authentically magnetic , entirely open , rough-hewn , bawdy and temperamental . It ' s a rare elected official you don ' t mind sharing a tent with . Ahmaogak boasts of earning three days of &quot; good time &quot; off his 10-day jail sentence after a drunken binge . He is a champion of native rights but has hired plenty of non-natives to keep the town running smoothly . He and Maggie met in high_school and married in Los Angeles while she attended MTI Business_College and UCLA and he went_to Northrop-Rice Aviation Institute of Technology in Inglewood . At home_in Barrow , they have a 54-inch TV in the living_room and a whale skull and several frozen seal carcasses in the front_yard . At some cue too subtle for me , everyone suddenly leaps up and explodes into motion . We jump onto snow machines and scream out_to inspect the lead . In front of us , bowheads break the surface , their heads high out of the water . &quot; They ' re looking_around -- looking_for a trail through the ice . would n ' t you ? &quot; says Ahmaogak . We listen to their colossal splashes . Ahmaogak surveys the ice and picks a spot to launch the boats . Whaling captains are years in the making -- men , and a_few women , who have apprenticed for the job since their youth and who command the respect of enough villagers willing to sign_on as crew . They must also be successful enough in their other lives to have the money to finance the endeavor . We begin to chop trail . Good-natured harpooner Perry Okpeaha is helping ; so is stoical shoulder-gunner Larry Itta and 12-year-old Qaiyaan Harcharek , a determined sixth-grader who is in his sixth season as apprentice whaler . By midmorning , we have finished the trail and pulled the aluminum boat down to the water ' s edge , lifted it off its sled and skidded it to the lip of ice , which rises white for several inches above the water and descends translucent blue for a foot underneath . But the wind shifts and the lead begins to close . We retreat . At midafternoon , the water opens again , and the boat is launched . By 6:30 , the crew has chased four whales but never quite come_close enough for Okpeaha to hurl the harpoon . The routine is typical and repeated often -- the crew advances , retreats , rests and then resumes the hunt . On the marine radio , static turns_into cheers . A few miles west of us , captain Jake Adams has caught the first whale of the year for Barrow , a 28-footer . &quot; Bambi , &quot; says Ahmaogak . Once Adams ' whale is secured by a rope to the tail and maneuvered to the shore ice , the crew delivers a prayer of thanks . Then the village airwaves crackle into life , filled with the news . In Barrow and on the ice , snow machines are fired_up to carry as_many as can come_out to Adams ' camp to help pull the bowhead from the water and butcher it into slabs of blubber and meat . The first whale of the year is always divided up among all_the crews in Barrow . From then on , only those who come_out onto the ice to help will receive a share . It can take_up to 36 hours or more of nonstop effort to land and cut_up a big bowhead . A large portion of the food is stockpiled for the year ' s many coming feasts . Something else comes_over the radio . Not far away the ice has broken_loose and two crews are_adrift in the sea . On a big sheet of ice , there is little immediate worry . But big sheets can shatter into little ones by force of waves or in a collision with drifting icebergs , and that can be catastrophic . A search-and-rescue helicopter is launched from Barrow to retrieve the crews and their gear . &quot; Should have watched their back_door . Gotta watch the back_door , &quot; growls Ahmaogak . Ha ha ha . We hurriedly check the ice at our own back_door . Holding solid , say those who know such things . By now , I ' m so spooked I step only in the footprints of someone else . I have been advised to carry a quick-draw sheath_knife so that if I fall_into the water , I can stab the ice and keep_from slipping under until help arrives , if help is handy . I try to visualize the experience . We spend the evening -- which looks almost the same as the morning under the arctic sun -- sitting on a boat sled , with a white canvas windbreak stretched behind us , quietly scanning the water for the steam geysers of surfacing whales . Hours pass with hardly_a word . Even here , the primitive landscape of ice and water is clouded by development . With the Prudhoe Bay oil fields now past their peak , oil_companies have their eye on expanding offshore drilling_in the Arctic_Ocean to keep the Trans-Alaska pipeline flowing . The Inupiat strongly oppose the idea . Not only would they receive no tax_revenues for operations beyond the three-mile coastal boundary , they also fear an oil-well blowout would jeopardize the survival of the bowhead . But they are plenty eager for more onshore drilling , particularly in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the east . Their taxing authority would extend_to such development , plus they hold mineral deeds to some of the potential sites . As the winds pick_up , massive ice_floes begin to dance across the near horizon . &quot; That is some heavy * % * , &quot; says Ahmaogak . &quot; Imagine wind and current pushing_on this -- that ' s our worry . No drilling_rig could stand_up to that. &quot; AS LONG AS THE LEAD IS OPEN , WE SLEEP ONLY INTERMITTENTLY , ON NO schedule whatsoever . Sometimes the tent is too full , and I borrow a bearskin and curl_up in an 18-foot skiff . It is hard to keep a grip on_time . &quot; I have a feeling it ' s going_to be a long day tonight , &quot; is the way one of the other whalers puts it . Whatever stimulates Ahmaogak into action remains a mystery to me . One moment we are sitting quietly . And the next , scrambling . Ahmaogak and crew launch the skin boat and come within feet of striking a whale that approaches head on . They paddle behind a distant iceberg and I find myself alone on the ice . Just two days ago , a polar_bear wandered near camp . Ahmaogak could put both of his oversized arctic boots inside the bear ' s paw print . The marine radio has been reporting bears lurking around other camps . Where did they leave those rifles ? I wonder . A bowhead breaches 100 feet from the ice edge , its mighty head rising more_than 20 feet out of the water . I look_into its saucer-sized black_eye , and it emits a ghostly blow . I take my turn_in the aluminum boat as the crew races up and down the lead , futilely chasing whales but coming so near to their submarine-sized backs that my chest pounds . Okpeaha raises his harpoon , once , twice , three times . Never quite close enough to let_fly . Back at camp , our share of Jake Adams ' whale is delivered to the tent , and I cook the traditional uunaalik -- pungent , boiled finger-sized pieces of whale blubber and skin with the overpowering redolence of fish_oil that brings the whole crew scrambling to the pot . Recipe : Boil strips of whale in water until the blubber floats , about five minutes . We also snack on crunchy frozen chunks of whitefish dipped in seal_oil . One night we break from the native menu and I open several cans of chili , which is followed by a rousing after-supper bout of gas passing , men and women joining in uproariously without the slightest self-consciousness . &quot; Let ' s change our diet ! &quot; says Ahmaogak during another lull in the action . We race off to hunt seals , but find none . We do find a new launch site and move our whaling boats from fragile ice to an even riskier location , where we have to leap across a watery two-foot crack to reach the lead . Here the ice is so thin and flexible it undulates to the rhythm of the sea waves . When the largest icebergs I ' ve seen bear_down_on our camp , Ahmaogak laughs . &quot; Maybe tomorrow we have to move camp back closer to town . Then we ' ll go have a shot of Courvoisier , a cigar and a shower . Ha ha ha . Or maybe we break_off and ride to Siberia. &quot; Instead , we stay_put . Next day , the lead is clear . West of us , the whaling action picks_up . Three whales are struck , and the chase is_on . A cease-fire order comes via radio for the remaining crews while the pursuit continues . No whales are landed , although they eventually will begin to rot and float to the surface as &quot; stinkers , &quot; animals that can be only partly salvaged . Again the radio comes_to_life . Whaling captain Thomas Brower III has caught a 33-footer . I am set to leave soon ; it ' s now or never if I want to see a whale brought_in . I set_out in a snow machine for the 30-mile journey across the ice to the Brower camp , joining perhaps 90 whalers and villagers who will converge to pull the whale out of the water and divide it up . Over the course of more_than an hour , in a massive tug of war , we use rope , block_and_tackle to inch the rubbery , lifeless whale onto the ice . Men climb onto the nine-foot-high carcass to slice it , crosswise , into 18-inch strips of skin and blubber that are undercut and peeled_off in an assembly-line operation . While the adults work , children bounce and play_on the carcass . Finally , the meat and tongue and internal_organs are divided up . The baleens will be scrimshawed and sold to tourists , the only cash derived from a whale . By the time the job is finished , a ragged circle of snow near the lead has turned bright red . WHEN I DRAG INTO CAMP 10 hours later , I ' m as tired as I ' ve ever been . I begin my goodbys . Maybe , it is suggested , I ' ll come_back for the nalukataq feast , which celebrates the end of the whaling season . Then there are the geese and ducks to hunt , as they migrate in their turn . &quot; Boom boom , &quot; says the mayor . And after that the hunt for caribou and moose , and after that , the whales once again , during their return migration . &quot; It ' s something out here , isn ' t it ? &quot; Ha ha ha . Ahmaogak pulls_off his polar-bear mitten , squeezes my hand and turns . He and his crew climb into the aluminum boat . The last I see of them are the backs of three Eskimo parkas , hunched against the wind , fur hood ruffs flying as the captain guns his outboard and disappears into a tangle of icebergs .</TEXT>
