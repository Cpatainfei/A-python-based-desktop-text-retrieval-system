   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON THE U.S. / JAPAN RELATIONSHIP ; PROMISES OF ' CHANGE ' RING HOLLOW ; ONE YEAR LATER , THERE ' S BEEN LITTLE PROGRESS ON LOWERING THE TRADE_GAP AND BREAKING_DOWN IMPORT_BARRIERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The relationship between the United States and Japan is in serious disrepair . Japan ' s huge account surplus , low level of manufactured imports , minuscule inward foreign direct investment and barriers to foreign products and services persist unabated . Why has there been so little progress despite the inauguration last year in both nations of governments espousing &quot; change &quot; ? The answer is inattention , complacency and missed opportunity . Inattention to the relationship has been abetted by a sense of complacency in both countries . In the United States , this complacency has three sources . First , exaggerated media accounts have misled Americans into believing that &quot; the Japanese sun has set. &quot; Although the current recession has lasted longer than expected , the fundamental strengths of the Japanese economy remain intact . Within 12 to 18 months , the cost-cutting , rationalization and restructuring to squeeze_out the excesses of the &quot; bubble economy &quot; of the late 1980s and early ' 90s will have had their effect , and Japan will again emerge as a formidable competitor . Americans should substitute wishful_thinking with objective and realistic analyses of long-term Japanese global economic strategy . Second is the mistaken notion that the &quot; reforms &quot; advocated by Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa -- and passed_by the Diet on Saturday after being rejected by the Upper House on Jan . 21 -- would benefit not only Japan but also its trading partners , in particular the United States . This fallacy was premised on the assumption that the realignment of political_parties in Japan would automatically lead to a more open , transparent , consumer-oriented society . Third , the Clinton_Administration appears to believe that asymmetries in the economic relationship can be remedied simply by asking Japan to commit to &quot; results &quot; -- whether in its current-account surplus , aggregate level of manufactured imports or sector-specific imports . There is an evident lack of appreciation of the profound complexities and difficulties facing foreign firms attempting to export to or invest in Japan and the attention , expertise and resources necessary on the part of the U.S._government and corporations to penetrate the multilayered and deeply rooted barriers posed by the Japanese market . The Administration also lacks an understanding of where , when and how much pressure should be applied for maximum results and minimal Japanese resentment . On the Japanese side , complacency stems from the perception that the United States is too preoccupied with its own domestic problems and with foreign-policy crises to worry much about Japan . There is also a sense that the United States is increasingly dependent_on Japan ' s goodwill and support -- whether for &quot; strategic alliances &quot; between corporations , security cooperation as on the Korean_peninsula , personnel for peacekeeping operations as in Cambodia or for financial assistance as in Russia and the Middle_East . As for opportunity , the Clinton_Administration missed a golden one in early 1993 to set a fundamentally new course for the U.S.-Japan relationship . Japanese officials and business_leaders fully expected the new Administration to institute policies that would force Japan to accept more U.S. products , services and investment in return for continued access to the U.S. market . Rhetoric coming from the Clinton team certainly gave that impression . By calling_for &quot; results , &quot; &quot; targets &quot; and &quot; objective indicators , &quot; the Administration put Japan on notice that , unlike the Republicans , it would not settle for mere changes in procurement rules or procedures . But the flaw was threefold . First , the rhetoric was not supported by a clear , coherent , consistent policy toward Japan . Depending_on the day and the official being quoted , the request or &quot; demand &quot; was described as targets , goals , results , objective criteria , quantitative indicators , qualitative indicators , benchmarks , yardsticks , reciprocity , transparency or none of the above . The clear impression left in Japan was that the Administration was wavering . Second , the Administration ' s inattention early on allowed Japan to undertake a remarkably successful public-relations_campaign that depicted the United States as a &quot; protectionist &quot; nation advocating &quot; managed trade. &quot; Southeast Asian_countries and many members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were persuaded by Japan that if the United States were successful in pursuing a results-oriented trade_policy toward it , they , too , would face similar pressures . Third , the U.S. rhetoric was not backed_up by action . The Administration failed to understand the cardinal principle in negotiating with Japan : Speak softly and carry a big stick . Instead , the Administration did the opposite ; it cried wolf repeatedly but took no action . From Tokyo ' s perspective , the construction scandal was a test of whether the Clinton team would act differently from the Reagan and Bush teams . With more_than 30 senior Japanese government officials and executives arrested in 1993 for bid-rigging , bribery and collusion in the construction_industry , many Japanese knew that if there was ever a clear case of illegal activity that excluded competitive foreign companies from the Japanese market , this was it . Inaction by the Clinton_Administration was seen in Japan not as a gesture of generosity but as a sign of weakness .</TEXT>
