   <HEADLINE> PATIENT ANGELENOS DEAL WITH A NEW CALL WAITING ; COMMUNICATIONS : CALLS FROM THE EAST COULDN ' T GET THROUGH , WHILE SOME IN L.A. RESORTED TO WALKIE-TALKIES . AND GETTING LOTTERY TICKETS WAS NO SURE BET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What ' s that sound ? It ' s the phone not ringing . In a city with three area_codes , a city where people can be spotted walking down neighborhood streets squiring a dog on a leash in one hand and carrying a cellular_telephone in the other , the silence was almost operatic in scope . The morning for many Angelenos got short-circuited when fire knocked_out service at a Downtown Pacific Bell switching facility for several hours Tuesday morning . At the Downtown office of Travel Service International , the clients from the East Coast who usually call early in the morning could not get_through and the agents ' computers that connect them to the airlines were not working anyway . &quot; We couldn ' t pull_up anything , we couldn ' t do anything , &quot; said travel_agent Julie Neilson , who arrived_at 7:30 a.m. &quot; We couldn ' t even get_hold_of the airlines on the phone because the 800 numbers were down. &quot; She busied herself with correspondence . &quot; You get stressed out because you don ' t know how long it ' s going_to be. &quot; When KBIG listener lines went_down , so did the 6:15 a.m. and 7:40 a.m. trivia questions , dashing chances to win a Little Caesar ' s pizza party pack or a $ 100 T.J. Maxx gift certificate . And depending_on where you were , you could forget about cashing_in that winning lottery ticket -- or buying one . And although phones did not go_down everywhere , some fantasized about what it would be like . &quot; I wish they were down , &quot; sighed one harried phone answerer at the Screen Actors Guild . Some were oblivious . &quot; What phones are down ? &quot; asked an emergency_room nurse at Holy Cross Medical_Center in the San Fernando Valley , where there was no phone fallout . Despite the fact that 911 service was temporarily disrupted , no one reported any deaths or injuries because of the delay . But at the brokerage_firm of Smith Barney Shearson in Century City , one stockbroker said : &quot; Somebody got sick in the office and we couldn ' t get_through to 911. &quot; Paramedics eventually arrived and treated the man . Others may have been jumping to conclusions . &quot; On my way into work , I couldn ' t get a signal on my ( cellular ) phone , &quot; said one Downtown lawyer . &quot; Tell him to check his battery , &quot; quipped one wise Angeleno . Some businesses are simply prepared_for phone problems . &quot; As part of our preparation for disasters and earthquakes , our reporters have alternative ways of getting_on the air , &quot; KNX radio_news director Bob Sims said . &quot; All reporters have two-way walkie-talkies . Sims did note that a special high-quality circuit into their City_Hall bureau went_down . Instead , they got_through on a regular telephone_line . Most simply waited . In the City_Hall office of Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky , the phones went dead for 45 minutes . It is not unusual for every one of the seven lines to be lit_up . &quot; I hate having dead phones , &quot; said Katharine Macdonald , press secretary to Yaroslavsky . &quot; I love talking on the phone. &quot; Not only were a significant number of lottery outlets affected because their computer data lines are hooked_up to Sacramento via telephone , the Van Nuys office manager of the California Lottery was personally affected . When Deborah Smith first heard about the phone problems , she tried calling Sacramento from her house -- in the 818 area_code -- to no avail . When she arrived_at her office , her problems continued : &quot; We couldn ' t get_through to Sacramento , we couldn ' t get_through on our WATS line. &quot; And she had no way of knowing how many of the 2 # 300 outlets she manages were suffering difficulties because none could call her either . But forget about Angelenos being shocked by this lack of phone_service . &quot; The closest thing I could compare this to ? &quot; she mused . &quot; The type of disconnection we had with the earthquake -- circuits were busy . You couldn ' t reach personnel. &quot; The Pacific Stock_Exchange reported no problems . It works_on a computer_system that is separate from the phone_system . Although trading proceeded at a normal pace Tuesday , some traders had intermittent problems placing phone_calls to clients and offices in the East . &quot; But persistence won out , &quot; said Karen Sulker-Hall , secretary to the director of floor operations . &quot; One person said it was the challenge of the day. &quot;</TEXT>
