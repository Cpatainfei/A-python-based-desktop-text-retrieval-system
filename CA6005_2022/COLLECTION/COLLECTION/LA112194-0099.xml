   <HEADLINE> COMPETITION FOR SUPPLIES FIERCE AMONG FOOD_BANKS ; CHARITY : COMPANIES INCREASINGLY SELL SALVAGED GOODS THEY ONCE DONATED . MORE OF THE HUNGRY ARE TURNED AWAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nuns and church volunteers who run Los Angeles ' charitable food pantries circle like wily prizefighters around a pile of boxes filled with dented food cans and torn cereal packages at the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank . Today is &quot; Monday Madness , &quot; the bank ' s weekly food grab , where affiliated pantries cart_off damaged foods donated by supermarkets and food_companies . &quot; No pushing ! No fighting ! No name-calling ! &quot; a food_bank employee warns . Volunteers swarm over the heap , colliding as they reach for the choicest loot , running the boxes back to their pantry ' s zealously guarded stash . &quot; Grab it ! Grab it ! &quot; pants one nun to another . Older church workers complain of being nearly trampled in the rush for food , which they take from the food_bank and distribute to the hungry through a network of pantries . Fistfights sometimes erupt . &quot; It ' s like we ' re going into a wrestling match , &quot; says Holy Cross parish pantry director Suzanne Snyder , who steers clear of the coveted frozen meat boxes &quot; for fear of physical harm. &quot; The skirmish for food has turned frenzied as charitable groups -- which flourished in the 1980s as one of America ' s primary responses to a rising tide of hunger -- struggle to survive cuts_in their lifeblood : food_company donations . Gifts of &quot; secondary &quot; and &quot; salvage &quot; foods to Second Harvest , coordinator of the nation ' s largest network of food_banks , slipped 11.2 % in the first 10 months of the year -- a drop of 23.5 million pounds . Companies grappling with debt from leveraged_buyouts and razor-thin margins are selling what they once gave_away , fueling a $ 2.4-billion industry of dented or expired products trafficked under tarps in flea_markets or in secondary food stores -- from Scratch ' N Dent Food_Shops in Plant City , Fla. , to Dentco in Fontana . &quot; There has been a national change in corporate priorities . . . , &quot; frets L.A. Regional Foodbank Executive_Director Doris Bloch , turning with trepidation to a Los Angeles map riddled with 758 red dots -- one for each agency -- that rely_on her bank to feed 300 # 000 weekly . At the food_bank , donations from national food_companies have dropped 41 % so far this year . And in a UCLA study from 1993 , one in four hungry families seeking food were already being turned_away by Los Angeles pantries . &quot; I eat Rolaids regularly . This scares me to death , &quot; says Deborah Keegan , marketing director for Second Harvest , whose affiliated pantries fed nearly 21 million families last year . In the middle of the conflict are the giant food manufacturers , torn between needed profits and charitable giving . The pressures can be intense : At a recent conference , a secondary food_chain executive urged corporations to forsake traditional policies of donations and sell to his market instead . He drilled home the point : selling , not giving , helps companies reel in more cash . Still , the Grocery Manufacturers of America board -- a trade group that represents the nation ' s largest food_companies -- has urged members to keep giving . Augie Fernandes , vice_president of a supermarket consulting_firm and an expert on the salvage business , says four of 10 major food_companies in the past two years have begun selling secondary foods , and he predicts donations could drop another 30 % . Says Fernandes : &quot; The food_banks are in trouble. &quot; In the Pantries : A Daily Balancing Act At the Community Food_Bank of West Covina , pantry coordinator Victoria Portillo begins a daily balancing act : helping people , but not running_dry before closing time . Portillo unlocks the heavy metal door of the old_school that serves as the distribution point for food . People step inside , one at a time , eyes cast downward , voices sometimes cracking . &quot; They never thought they would lose their job . They never thought they would be here , &quot; Portillo says . Outside , a cadre of elderly men , all volunteers , unload food from a rickety donated pickup_truck . Inside , a silver-haired woman prepares the packages to be distributed : a small grocery_bag containing canned goods and pasta , bread and a home-grown cucumber donated by a neighbor , a ration more generous than on some days . A middle-aged woman , divorced , is first to swing open the pantry ' s door . Five children cling_to her skirt . &quot; Is this your first time here ? &quot; Portillo says . When she asks this question , grown men often break_down , quietly sobbing . &quot; You can come five times in a lifetime -- period , &quot; Portillo tells the woman . Portillo calculates what she has in_stock , then plucks one of a_few chocolate_cakes stashed in the pantry freezer and piles that on top of the bag of groceries . The children quickly gather around the food . Their eyes devour the dessert . The mother fights_off tears . &quot; I didn ' t know what I was going_to do for my child ' s birthday this Saturday , &quot; she says , cradling the bag of food in her arms . But when a man comes_in with his wife and three young children , Portillo tells them she cannot help , because they used_up their five visits four years before . The woman ' s expression turns from hope to desperation . Her husband becomes belligerent . &quot; Give me some bread ! Give me some bread ! I got three hungry children here ! &quot; he says , springing menacingly from his chair . Portillo fearfully shoves several loaves into his arms . &quot; This is my last time , &quot; says a young_woman who enters near closing time , a tinge of despair in her voice . Portillo suddenly realizes the pantry is down to a_few loaves_of_bread . She madly snatches back some of the loaves volunteers have put into the young_woman ' s cart ; Portillo needs to stretch what ' s left for the half-dozen families still lined_up outside . Nearly half of 9 # 300 pantries and soup_kitchens surveyed nationwide have recently been forced to slash the amount of food they give each family , Second Harvest found . Glendale ' s Salvation_Army has cut the number of yearly visits in half to six ; some pantries allow one food request per year . At L.A. First Church of the Nazarene ' s pantry , which feeds the first 100 people to arrive three times a week , the hungry line_up before dawn to claim one of the coveted food bags , which are given_out mid-morning . Twenty San Bernardino and Riverside County pantries in the past 1 1 / 2 years have shut their doors altogether , says Daryl Brock , executive_director of Riverside ' s Survive Food_Bank . &quot; There isn ' t much food available , &quot; laments Rita Russo , one of two nuns who founded the Seedling , a South-Central Los Angeles pantry . The line of people stretches halfway down the block from the pantry ' s red , green and yellow tent , where volunteers sort turnips and cans of food into boxes that once contained a week ' s supply , but have dwindled to three or even two days of food . The Seedling and other pantries are bracing for cuts_in their other main food source : government surplus items -- made famous by massive cheese giveaways in the 1980s -- which provide Los Angeles County ' s big food_banks with nearly four of every 10 pounds distributed , but have been slashed by two-thirds for next year . In late 1993 , the Seedling had government surplus foods only , and by Christmas , just two items remained : beans and butter . This year , it may have to close for the holidays . &quot; I ' ve heard desperate mothers say we just prayed through last night because there was nothing to eat , &quot; said Russo , who often watches children sit on the floor of the pantry ' s giant tent and tear open packages of bread , feasting on the floor as if the loaves were ambrosia . &quot; To me , this is a gospel need . Jesus said , ' Feed thy neighbor. ' &quot; Nearly one-third of those who come_to U.S. food agencies are the working poor , people who can ' t pay high rents on minimum_wage and still put three meals on the table , a survey last year by Second Harvest found . Single parents make_up more_than two-thirds of pantry and soup_kitchen clients , and children , who are a quarter of the population , were almost half of emergency food recipients . Most who come_to the agencies were recently unemployed . A majority don ' t get food_stamps , either because of the stigma of applying or misunderstandings about eligibility . More_than four of five who get the coupons said the aid never lasts the month . In the 1980s , food_bank advocates convinced great numbers of food_companies that it was better to donate food than to shovel it into landfills . The Government Accounting Office , Congress ' investigative arm , estimated that as much as 20 % of all food grown in the U.S. -- up_to two tons per person , per year -- was thrown_away . Food_banks touted the write-offs corporations would get , and battled companies ' fear that donating less-than-perfect food would tarnish their product ' s carefully cultivated image . Firms faced the mounting P.R. problem of wasted food as hunger , which appeared to be nearly eliminated by the War on Poverty program , resurfaced in the 1980s . &quot; The trickle of people became a river , &quot; says Carolyn Olney of Los Angeles ' Interfaith Hunger Coalition . Grass-roots food pantries and soup_kitchens quadrupled to 40 # 000 between 1982 and 1990 . Last year , more_than 1 billion pounds flowed to the food_banks from food_companies and supermarkets -- products that flopped , were discontinued or had expired code dates or production errors . General Mills Inc. donated cereals that were too lightly toasted or had flakes that were too small . Its biggest giveaway : $ 3 million of Cheerios boxes containing a toy ball on which a 1-year-old child choked to death . ( The food_banks had to promise to remove the balls before distributing the cereal. ) American consumers -- particularly sensitive since the tampering scares -- set_aside all but the most pristine packages . ( Food_bank volunteers sort through cans , removing any that appear questionable . Laws enacted in the ' 80s protect companies from liability when they donate food. ) But by the 1990s , being hailed as a big donor had become something of an embarrassment -- a red alert to shareholders that a company was wasteful and inefficient . Two years ago , food_company executives began warning food bankers to look elsewhere for food . &quot; They said , look guys , we love you , but we ' re going to sell this . We have to look_to the bottom_line , &quot; recalls Bloch , of the L.A. Regional Food_Bank . Excess food was increasingly sold to Pic ' N ' Save , 99 Cents Only Stores and others . Major American food_companies balk at revealing the proportion of &quot; unsalable &quot; goods they sell to secondary merchants . For example , Quaker Oats Co. , whose donations declined from $ 11.9 million in fiscal 1993 to $ 5.1 million in fiscal 1994 , will not specify how much secondary food it sold . A spokesman attributed most of the drop to increased efficiencies that decreased the quantity of unsalable food available . Despite critics in the world of food_banks , the corporations have many defenders . They note that few other industries are expected to give_away a significant part of their goods to the needy , and that they shouldn ' t be expected to take the place of the government in feeding America ' s hungry . &quot; Food retailers are in business to make money , &quot; says Fernandes , the salvage expert . &quot; Companies have to recover their losses . They want to put these products back onto their bottom line. &quot; And indeed , many firms try to balance charity with fiscal necessity . The Vons Cos . grocery chain sells 15 % of its salvage and much of its discontinued foods , but donates 12 trailers of food each week to 150 local charities . General Mills , which was unable to say how much it sells to secondary sources , donates $ 10.5 million in food yearly . Still , said General Mills Foundation vice_president David Nasby : &quot; It ' s always better to sell your product than to give it away. &quot; Bargain Shopping in the Salvage Aisle Sandwiched on a lonely stretch of road between a massage parlor and a motorcycle shop , Dentco is doing a booming business with the food_companies ' change of heart . Founder Orlan T . Riggs , who until his heart_surgery presided over a five-store dented can empire from Yucaipa to Santa Ana , now pours all his energy into his Fontana store . On Saturday mornings , up_to 50 people line_up outside the mustard-colored cinder_block building , waiting to pick_over the wire bins of taped boxes and tarnished fare . An employee empties dozens of dented cans into huge bins , replenishing what customers have purchased . &quot; All of the name brands are here , &quot; he says , proudly motioning to the damaged items being scrutinized by customers under a Spartan row of fluorescent lights . At the high end of the salvage industry is Canned Foods Grocery Outlets in Berkeley . Known as the the Cadillac of the business , Canned Foods promises a &quot; discreet outlet for remarketing your products &quot; to 76 of the country ' s largest food_companies . Canned Foods has grown_into more_than 100 stores in six western states . Enthusiastic blurbs from executives for Hormel Foods Corp . and Sara Lee Bakery adorn Canned Foods ' glossy marketing brochure . Less glossy -- but highly popular -- is Joe Sanchez ' s place in Lincoln Heights . &quot; It ' s kind of an underground business , &quot; says Sanchez , president of La Quebradita ( the Broken Thing ) , whose facade carries a bucolic rendering of a man wearing a sombrero astride a muscular horse pulling a shopping_cart full of groceries . Sanchez inches past his store ' s beauty_salon and restaurant into a back_room , where huge bins overflow with damaged packages of microwave pudding and torn boxes of cereals . ( Sanchez says the boxes have an inner package that protects the food and that he tosses_out anything questionable. ) The back_room is for the real bargains . &quot; This is where people won ' t run_into their neighbor , &quot; he says . Sanchez buys 2 # 000 boxes full of dented cans each month from grocery chains for $ 6 to $ 11 each , marks_up the price 28 % , and makes an 8 % profit , at least four times what supermarkets in Southern California net . &quot; It ' s a super business , &quot; he says effusively . Starting with a $ 3 # 800 initial investment , Sanchez has used profits to open two large grocery_stores and a sausage company . &quot; Before , supermarkets donated everything . They want the green now . They want cash , &quot; he says . The most vigorous salvage sales have perhaps been at flea_markets , some of which have seen the number of vendors quadruple in the past two years . Al Ruby sold shoes for 11 years at the Cypress College swap meet , until the recession caused sales to dry_up . He looked_across the aisle to see his swap meet neighbor madly selling dented cans of food . &quot; People can ' t afford shoes . But they gotta eat , &quot; he says with a shrug . Low prices scream out from fluorescent pieces of cardboard . Most of the goods on display have outlived their printed expiration date , sometimes by four months . Some cans are rusty . At a neighboring salvage food stand , where food is as much as eight months past the code date , mayonnaise with no paper label sits in the hot sun , huge air_pockets developing in the middle of the jars . &quot; I get a lot of calls each day from people who want to buy this stuff , &quot; says Manuel Duran , manager of salvage operations for Certified Grocers of California , made_up of 2 # 200 small grocers and chains . &quot; C ' mon , just show me what you got , &quot; people cajole him , said Duran , standing in the heart of Certified Grocer ' s salvage operations , a dimly lit City of Commerce warehouse where huge fans churn the heavy air . Last year , he sold about $ 3.8 million worth of food_products to intermediaries that distributed the goods to peddlers and stores . Duran , who says the sales help supermarkets keep regular food prices down , can name only six companies that still require him to donate their damaged products . Out on the dock today , amid a swarm of small flies : crushed packages of cup noodles that he ' ll sell , mangled cans of green_beans , fruit_cocktail . Salvage and secondary food operators such_as Canned Foods aggressively call Second Harvest ' s corporate food donors weekly , often offering to buy products sight unseen . Food_banks counterattack by warning companies that salvage operators might not handle their product well , and prey on their fears that people who buy their brand in a salvage store might have otherwise purchased it at a regular store at full price . Calling salvage sales a ticking time_bomb , they claim that some salvage operators aren ' t careful to eliminate all swollen cans or those dented at the seam that could lead to botulism poisoning , a bacteria infection that can be fatal . Those in the salvage industry counter that they are as vigilant as food_banks and pantries in weeding_out suspect food_products . Alfonso Medina , chief of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services food and milk program , said his inspectors have found at least two cases this year of swollen and potentially dangerous cans of salvage food being sold at swap meets . To be safe , he says , salvagers must glean out about half the cans they buy , tossing_out &quot; flippers , swellers or leakers &quot; -- cans that are swollen on one end , both ends , or dented at the seam . Medina said he knew of no questionable food distributed at food_banks . Salvage customer Julio Herrera is grateful for the secondary food industry and the bargains it provides him . &quot; I can ' t live without these guys ! &quot; raves Herrera , taking a break as he and five of his six children rummage through 16 rows of banana boxes full of motley food_products under a gray tarp at the outer edge of the Santa Fe Springs swap meet . They select torn bags of rice . Before finding the salvage stand two years ago , Herrera was unable on his $ 15 # 000 annual salary as a truck_driver to put three meals on the table for his children . A church pantry , he says , nonetheless rejected him , saying his income was too high . &quot; They said other people were more needy , &quot; he says , casting his eyes downward as he recalls the embarrassment of asking_for food , then being turned_away empty-handed . He now buys 95 % of his groceries at the stand . ' What Is to Become of These Hungry People ? ' As corporations wrestle with whether it is better to sell or give , food_bank proponents have learned they must become more aggressive to survive . Second Harvest typically takes four or five days to tell food manufacturers anxious to clear their docks whether or not they want a food gift , said Mike Mulqueen , director of the Greater Chicago Food Depository . Foodbank of Southern California , Los Angeles ' second largest , left the Second Harvest network in 1991 , dissatisfied that 82 % of what they were receiving were snack_foods such_as candy , potato_chips and sodas . Contacting food_companies on its own , donations rose 86 % the next year . &quot; Before , you waited at your desk for the phone to ring and the food to flow in . Food_banks have to be hungrier and work their tails off now , &quot; said John F . Knapp , president of the Foodbank . &quot; The big major donors may be tapped_out . But lots of medium-sized companies haven ' t been asked to join the hunger fight , &quot; agreed Mark Lowry of Orange County ' s Community Development Council food_bank . Some food_bank authorities say they must also turn_to different and more nourishing foods , such_as produce , fish and leftovers from restaurants . Half of the food_banks approached this year about starting programs to use vegetables and fruits that cannot be sold but are still edible rejected the idea , said Susan Evans , a professor at the Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research at the University of Southern California . &quot; Food_banks haven ' t been responsive to change , &quot; Evans said . Love Is Feeding Everyone ( LIFE ) , a Los Angeles food_bank begun by actors Dennis Weaver and Valerie Harper , trucks milk , meat and bakery products from 52 Hughes markets to needy institutions , but most supermarkets haven ' t been tapped , says James Schiffner , LIFE ' s chief_executive_officer . As another sign of their evolution , a_few pantries , such_as St . Joseph Center in Venice , are becoming social_service agencies , providing help to get jobs , parenting skills and budgeting classes , convinced that the only solution is to stem the number of people who live_in poverty and need help . But for many in the hunger movement , the pantry ' s problems have caused a fundamental questioning of whether their core principle -- that private charity can take the place of government -- works in the leaner ' 90s . &quot; Everyone agrees government services need to be cut . But at_the_same_time , the private sector says they have to be mean and lean , &quot; says Bloch , of the L.A. Regional Foodbank . &quot; So what is to become of these hungry people ? &quot; About This Series In this series , The Times examines four battlegrounds in the war on hunger in Southern California . * Sunday : Hungry children , caught in the battles over school breakfast . * Today : The growing salvage food industry -- spawned by hard_times -- takes a bite_out of charitable food_banks . * Tuesday : U.S. Department_of_Agriculture changes_course and launches a crusade to attract more people to food_stamps . * Wednesday : A one-woman crusade to ease neighborhood hunger , one family at a time . Inside a Food_Bank HOW DOES IT WORK The six food_banks in Los Angeles County are non-profit institutions that solicit unsaleable but still edible food from food_companies , restaurants , produce markets and other sources . They also store government-issued food such_as butter , beans , and , in the past , cheese . They hold the food in a warehouse and distribute it for a nominal fee to the approximately 700 member food pantries in Los Angeles County . These pantries are typically church-sponsored organizations run_on shoestring budgets by volunteers . Some pantries have cut_back on the amount of food they give_out because of shortages . WHO USES FOOD_BANKS Most people who go_to pantries for help do not receive food_stamps -- either because of the stigma of using the coupons or ignorance about the government anti-hunger program . A 1993 research study by Second Harvest , the Chicago-based network for food_banks and pantries , found these statistis on emergency food clients . 31.5 % seek assistance for three months or less . 39.6 % seek assistance for more_than one year . 18.1 % are homeless . 14.3 % own their own home . 45.8 % are children . In the total U.S. population , the proportion of people under 18 is 25.9 % . 61.7 % have no car . 46.7 % have no phone . 39.6 % have no high_school diploma . 48.3 % get food_stamps .</TEXT>
