   <HEADLINE> RECREATION / SKIING : PRACTICE MADE EASY MAKES SKIERS BETTER ; BECAUSE SNOW IS NOT ESSENTIAL , DOWNHILL BUFFS CAN GET IN SHAPE WITHOUT LEAVING ORANGE COUNTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What ' s the single best way to get ready for downhill skiing ? The best thing to do , say the experts , is . . . ski . &quot; If you ' re a skier , you know -- the more you ski , the better , &quot; said Michael Cicchetti , an instructor at Sports Club / Irvine . Obvious though it may sound , the sentiment was echoed by Terry Jarmon , manager of California Ski Center in Anaheim : &quot; The best exercise to get ready for snow-skiing , is snow-skiing. &quot; Thanks to machines , snow is no longer an essential ingredient , and ski buffs can work_on their technique even in the warm months . California Ski Center in Anaheim , for example , has two indoor slopes , one that revolves like a large treadmill . Smaller versions of that machine can be found at some health clubs , including Sports Club / Irvine . As a personal trainer , Cicchetti works with several clients one-on-one on the club ' s &quot; ski simulator. &quot; With no lift lines and theoretically endless runs , students can get_in a lot of skiing in a little bit of time . Also , on the machine , it ' s easier to isolate and solve technical problems . Cicchetti said he ' s working with one young client who ' s never actually been_on a mountain yet , but has already mastered parallel turns . Once he gets_onto real snow , he ' ll be ready to roar . &quot; Skiing should be fun , &quot; Cicchetti said . &quot; You want to be able to just ski and have a good time when you get_to the mountains. &quot; There are ways to get_in shape for the season that don ' t involve skiing the great indoors , however . According to Cicchetti , a conditioning routine undertaken before heading to the slopes can boost endurance and performance , and cut_down on the muscle soreness that can follow a ski trip . Cicchetti will be sharing some of his conditioning tips_in a clinic at Sports Club / Irvine on Sunday from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. ( the clinic is open_to the public at a cost of $ 15 ) . In addition to taking_part in Cicchetti ' s workout , participants will be able to view some of the latest ski equipment and talk to a physical_therapist about avoiding injury . While it ' s tempting to think that the legs do all_the work in skiing , Cicchetti ' s program focuses_on the whole body . &quot; The more conditioned you are overall , the better_off you are , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s not just leg exercises. &quot; What ' s more , the 10-part circuit he teaches can be done at_home with a minimum of equipment . Several of the exercises , including one he calls the &quot; ski ladder &quot; ( a sort of hyper-intense variation of hopscotch ) work_on tendon strength and &quot; quickness and explosiveness , &quot; Cicchetti said , which helps speed reaction_time and boosts performance in several aspects of skiing , from turns_to negotiating moguls . A two-person game of tug-of-war , done with a towel , works_on balance and coordination . Other exercises , including push-ups , sit-ups and a workout on the slide board help other aspects of overall fitness . The format of the circuit , meanwhile , helps to develop the short-burst &quot; anaerobic &quot; conditioning that comes_into play in skiing , in which brief , intense workouts are interspersed with long periods of rest . Participants do each exercise for 30 seconds , with only 10 seconds to move to the next station . &quot; Twice through and you ' re pretty well worn_out , &quot; Cicchetti said . The circuit training is preceded by 20 minutes of warm-ups and stretches . The circuit can be modified for home training , or partially moved to weight machines for health club_members . The key , as it is with any training regimen , is repetition . And while it ' s never too late to start , it ' s ideal to begin before the first snow falls and continue through the off-season . &quot; You ' ve got_to think_about it ahead of time , &quot; Cicchetti said . A ski fitness regimen called SkiFit , a program licensed through Proline USA , a sports marketing firm based in Seattle , applies many of the same principles of strength training that Cicchetti uses , while adding more cardiovascular training . The 24-session program starts with the recumbent cycle , moves to the treadmill and graduates finally to the stair-climber . The program also emphasizes strengthening the muscles and ligaments of the thumb to head_off a common complaint called &quot; skier ' s thumb. &quot; Cicchetti will lead a ski conditioning clinic Sunday , from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. at Sports Club / Irvine , 1980 Main St . Fee for non-members is $ 15 . Call ( 714 ) 975-8400 , Ext . 6501 , for information . * REI , an outdoor equipment store in Santa Ana , will hold a series of free clinics on Thursday nights this month for those who prefer cross-country to downhill skiing . On Thursday , cross-country basics are the topic of a talk by Dave Horine from the Pacific Wilderness Institute , an outdoor_sports instructional center based in Orange . On Jan . 13 , Leon Kolankiewicz will give a slide-illustrated talk_about his weeklong ski tour of the Juneau Icefield in Alaska . &quot; Layering for Comfort , &quot; about how to dress for a variety of winter activities , is the subject of the Jan . 20 presentation . And on Jan . 27 , Gene Mezereny ( author of a guide to local cross-country_skiing locations ) will share tips on equipment and where to ski . All talks begin at 7 p.m. The store is at 1411 S . Village Way in Santa Ana . Information : ( 714 ) 543-4142 .</TEXT>
