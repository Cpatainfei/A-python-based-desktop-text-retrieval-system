   <HEADLINE> THE CUTEST LOBBYISTS ; TORTOISES PARADE IN CAPITOL TO CELEBRATE DESERT PROTECTION ACT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Moments after President Clinton signed the Desert Protection Act into law this week , four baby tortoises and their older brother slowly made their way across his desk to greet him . The tortoises belong_to Whittier residents Elden and Patty Hughes and are known around Capitol_Hill as some of the cutest lobbyists in town . The Hugheses , active members of the Sierra Club , have made about nine trips to Washington with the reptiles in tow to give lawmakers a living example of what the recently signed bill will protect . &quot; Elden supplies the facts and the tortoises make the desert real , &quot; Patty Hughes said . The reptiles have paraded before senators , representatives and Cabinet members . But they spend most of their time at_home in Whittier , eating , sleeping and crawling around the Hugheses ' back yard . The couple has a state permit to keep their 33 tortoises , some of which were rescued after illnesses , injuries and habitat destruction . Most were born in captivity . The Mojave_Desert tortoises are designated by the government as threatened . The animals cannot be returned to the wild once they are domesticated because they might not survive or might spread disease , Hughes said . But the family of tortoises , which range_in age from 2 years to about 80 , seem to enjoy their specially built pen . The enclosure features plenty of soft dirt , plants for grazing , underground burrows with a built-in thermostat and a large net to keep predators , such_as crows and blue_jays , out . The couple , who have been lobbying for the Desert Protection Act since 1986 , adopted four tortoises in 1989 from their former keeper . The original clan , three large females and a male , Mr. BeeBe , have lived with the Hugheses and reproduced rapidly , hatching about 26 babies since they came_to Whittier . As Elden Hughes puts it , &quot; Mr. BeeBe is most attentive to the ladies. &quot; Though the tortoises are beginning to hibernate for the winter , many were_on hand Thursday , basking in the sun and chomping hibiscus flowers . The creatures are vegetarian and live_on a diet of flowers , frozen vegetables and vitamins . Kristin H . Berry , a research scientist with the National Biological Survey in Riverside who has spent 24 years studying desert_tortoises , said they are threatened in their native habitat by such factors as disease , vandalism , agriculture , off-road vehicles , natural predators and development . &quot; In California , most of ( the ) factors boil_down to man , &quot; Berry said .</TEXT>
