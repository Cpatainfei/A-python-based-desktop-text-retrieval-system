   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; GERMAN DEVELOPER ' S DISAPPEARANCE HAS CRITICS CALLING FOR CHANGE ; BANKING : HE OBTAINED LOANS WHILE LOSING MILLIONS EVERY YEAR . BILL WOULD FORCE COMPANIES TO DETAIL OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> German prosecutors have been searching far and wide for developer Juergen Schneider since he disappeared with $ 300 million on April 4 , leaving $ 3.1 billion in debt and unpaid contractor bills . Meanwhile , the banks Schneider allegedly defrauded have been trying to determine how a developer losing about $ 300 million a year was continually able to obtain loans . And critics are demanding changes in the business practices of top_executives that run the web of banks and corporations known as Germany Inc. In the Schneider scandal , in the near-bankruptcy of engineering giant Metallgesellschaft in January and in a billion-dollar fraud revealed this month at flooring manufacturer Balsam , well-connected men at ailing companies conducted risky or criminal business while their supervisors slumbered and the loans kept rolling in . &quot; Something stinks in the system , &quot; said Thomas Schmidt , a senior aide who helped draw_up business reform legislation pending in Parliament . &quot; You or I could never get loans like these . It ' s an insider ' s club. &quot; The bill is backed by the opposition and some legislators from the conservative government . It would force German companies to detail their ownership structures , strip top_executives of some of their duties on sundry boards and give shareholders more power in running companies . But quick passage isn ' t likely . It ' s not likely to pass before the Oct . 16 federal elections , however . And while average Germans may end_up paying_for the Schneider case and other fiascoes , there is no real groundswell for reforming the banks . &quot; Germans are all too trusting of their bankers , &quot; said Ekkehard Wenger , a professor of business at Wurzburg University and a critic of large corporations . They ' ve had reason to be . The tightly organized structure of the banks and corporations enabled the German Wirtschaftswunder , the country ' s astonishing economic rebirth after World_War_II . With top bankers and corporate_executives sitting on one another ' s boards and owning big chunks of each other ' s businesses , they were able to smoothly coordinate a kind of privately controlled command economy . But in the brave new Europe of open borders , quick-moving financial transfers and new competition from Asia and Eastern Europe , the tidy , chummy German business boards can ' t cope , critics say . &quot; The oversight boards have been conquered by the industries they are meant to supervise , &quot; Wenger said . For example , Hilmar Kopper , the Deutsche Bank chairman , sits on the supervisory board of Daimler-Benz , Germany ' s largest industrial concern , which is 25 % -owned by his bank . It ' s a clear conflict_of_interest , Schmidt said . When a major bank such_as Deutsche Bank_lines up behind a developer such_as Schneider , smaller banks quickly fall_in_line . As for the losses , consumers will end_up paying the price through more expensive banking fees , said Thomas Schlier , spokesman for the German consumers union . According to investigators , Schneider , 60 , lived_in a castle outside Frankfurt with his wife , Claudia , a 48-year-old heiress to a retail fortune . The developer was able to qualify for huge amounts of credit by setting_up dummy corporations and getting his buildings valued at far more_than they were worth , investigators say . He set_up 60 dummy companies to keep the credit pouring in , they say . Friends who used to stroll by a Munich building owned by Schneider &quot; were_sick with laughter &quot; when they found_out that the &quot; ugly old building &quot; had been appraised at $ 450 million , Wenger said . Deutsche Bank , Schneider ' s biggest creditor , expects to lose $ 300 million . &quot; You have to remember that he always paid on_time , &quot; spokesman Wolfgang Schumacher said . The bank was the victim of Schneider ' s &quot; criminal energy , &quot; he said , adding that there is no evidence to support reports that bank officers were bribed to help falsify Schneider ' s appraisals . Deutsche Bank has promised to finish the construction jobs stilled by Schneider ' s bankruptcy , but when that will happen is anyone ' s guess . &quot; It ' s a pretty little mess , &quot; said electrician Jens Doerr , one of 66 contractors in the city of Leipzig who is owed money by Schneider .</TEXT>
