   <HEADLINE> ON VIEW ; TYRANTS , TREASURES AND THE HERMITAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Television producer Daniel Wilson thought he had a great idea 15 years ago , when he first approached Soviet officials about making a documentary on the Hermitage , the cultural jewel of the city then known as Leningrad . &quot; I wanted to look_at one of the world ' s great museums and see how it functioned in a closed society , &quot; he recalls . His request was refused on grounds that film crews and TV lights might damage the artworks . But he didn ' t give_up . In 1991 , after Mikhail Gorbachev ' s perestroika policy had opened the country to foreign concepts , Wilson tried again . This time he got a favorable response -- to a far more challenging idea . &quot; What struck me was that I had to tell a story , &quot; he says . &quot; It wasn ' t enough to look_at beautiful paintings . The way to provide access to the art was to put it in historical context so that people could better understand the significance of what they were seeing. &quot; The result is &quot; The Hermitage : A Russian Odyssey , &quot; a three-part series airing on PBS . With veteran broadcast journalist Rod MacLeish as narrator , the documentary takes viewers on a journey through nearly four centuries of history , from the founding of St . Petersburg by Peter the Great , through the collecting passion of Catherine the Great , to the horrors of World_War_II and the collapse of the Soviet_Union . The program charts the phenomenal growth and partial dispersal of the Hermitage ' s European and Oriental art_collection amid a pageant of royal aspirations , political upheavals and human suffering . The first segment , &quot; Catherine the Great : A Lust for Art , &quot; focuses_on an extraordinary ruler who called herself &quot; a glutton for beauty. &quot; She amassed more European masterpieces than the Louvre had collected in four centuries and built a museum in a baroque Winter Palace to house her treasures . &quot; Tyrants and Heroes : The Nineteenth-Century Czars , &quot; the second episode , spans the reigns of Alexander I , who repulsed Napoleon ' s invasion ; Nicholas I , who sold_off 1 # 219 paintings from the Hermitage collection ; and Alexander II , who added a priceless cache of Sythian gold . &quot; From Czars to Commissars : A Museum Survives , &quot; the final hour , tracks the museum through two wars , a revolution that transferred artworks from private hands to state-owned institutions and the emergence of a new , deeply troubled nation . &quot; It ' s hard to show all that history and the vastness of the art_collection on television because it ' s a close-up medium , &quot; Wilson says . &quot; But I felt it was essential to tell the story and be as informative as possible. &quot; He hadn ' t planned to do the last segment , but as the project developed it seemed increasingly important to bring the drama up_to the present , he says . In retrospect , the decision appears inevitable because Wilson and his crew were swept into the evolution of a rapidly changing nation . While the film was in process , the Soviet_Union was transformed into a new Russia and Leningrad regained its former name of St . Petersburg . Right up_to the minute when Wilson and his team gained entrance to the museum , the project was tenuous . In one of many glitches , the film crew discovered that they couldn ' t drive to St . Petersburg from their base in Amsterdam because the roads were too rough for their delicate equipment , so they headed for Sweden and took a ferry across the Baltic_Sea . Then , on Aug . 17 , 1991 , the day before the shoot was to begin , an attempted coup d ' etat against Mikhail Gorbachev threatened to dismantle the government . Upon their arrival at the museum , the crew found 350 # 000 people gathered on an adjacent public_square to hear a calming speech by the city ' s mayor . There would be no filming that day , but the team got_to work 24 hours later . Then came the challenge of gaining the museum staff ' s trust . &quot; After the first couple of days , the curators could see that we were taking great_care with our work , &quot; Wilson says . &quot; Once they saw that we really cared about the collection , there was nothing they would n ' t do for us . The head curator , Vladimir Matveyev , was enormously helpful . He cut_through red tape. &quot; The crew worked from noon to the wee hours , Wilson says , recounting vivid memories . &quot; Filming in the Rembrandt galleries was one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life . But the challenge was to convey the enthusiasm we felt onto the screen so that others could enjoy it. &quot; The Hermitage portrayed on film is a sumptuous palace , packed with superior examples of artworks by no less than Titian , Rubens , Caravaggio and Matisse . But , as news_reports during the last few years have revealed , the ornate buildings are threatened with decay and the artworks suffer from a lack of air conditioning and conservation . One of the most gratifying rewards of making the documentary is that it has helped to raise awareness of the Hermitage ' s dilemma , Wilson says . At the invitation of the Russian government , UNESCO ( the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ) is drawing_up a master_plan for the museum ' s future . In addition , an American organization , the American Friends of the State Hermitage Museum Inc. , has been established to raise money for preservation , restoration and expansion . &quot; I ' m very proud that the program has served as a catalyst for this effort , &quot; he says . &quot; The Hermitage : A Russian Odyssey , &quot; airs all three parts Sunday at 1 p.m. on KCET ; and one segment each Wednesday at 10 p.m. on KOCE beginning this week .</TEXT>
