   <HEADLINE> ' OH , WHAT A PROUD MOMENT IT WAS ' ; SPACE : ROCKWELL EMPLOYEES CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE MOON LANDING AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO HISTORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a Sunday afternoon , but Earl Theaker was at_work when he and a group of Rockwell employees stood spellbound around a television to witness an event unfolding a world away . When Neil Armstrong radioed to NASA ' s Mission Control , &quot; The Eagle has landed , &quot; Theaker and the others exhaled . Later , when Armstrong stepped_on the sandy surface of the moon and offered the poetic words , &quot; one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind , &quot; Theaker and his co-workers broke_into thunderous applause . The shouts of jubilation were accompanied by church_bells ringing throughout a proud nation that day 25 years ago . Around the world , more_than 500 million people sat in front of television_sets , watching grainy images of two men in white bulky spacesuits planting a U.S. flag on the lunar landscape with its black horizon . On Wednesday , a quarter century to the day after the world ' s attention was riveted on Armstrong and the Apollo 11 astronauts , Theaker , now 67 and retired , returned to Rockwell International to celebrate the anniversary of the moon landing . Rockwell , which was the prime contractor for the Apollo spacecraft and the second stage of the Saturn V launch rocket , threw a party for about 2 # 000 employees and retirees at its world headquarters here to celebrate the success of the first lunar landing . The festivities were held outdoors , complete with a band and giant television screen that showed films of the memorable landing and the U.S. space_program . Gov . Pete Wilson and astronaut Edward G . Gibson , who completed 84 days in the Skylab space_station in 1974 , were the featured speakers . For Theaker , who lives_in Lomita , the giddy years between 1961 and 1971 when he worked in the infant space_program were some of the best in his life . &quot; I spent 40 years in aerospace , but those 10 were the most exciting , &quot; said Theaker , who was assistant to the director of aerospace sciences at Rockwell before he retired 10 years ago . However , nothing before or since compares to the day when two U.S. astronauts , Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin , walked on the moon_on July 20 , 1969 , Theaker said . The third Apollo 11 astronaut , Michael Collins , piloted the command_module around the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin romped on the lunar surface . For many Americans , the landing was a brief respite from the turbulence of the time . The country was bitterly divided by the Vietnam_War and racial strife in the cities . But for a single day , the sight of two Americans on the moon briefly united the nation in patriotic fervor . &quot; Oh , what a proud moment it was , &quot; said John Burnett of Torrance . Burnett , 64 , and a Rockwell employee for 34 years , worked_on both the Saturn rocket and Apollo spacecraft more_than 25 years ago . &quot; It was such an unbelievable sight . Many of us here could hardly contain our pride over what we had accomplished. &quot; &quot; You cannot understand the feeling we had . To actually see something you worked_on going_to the moon . It was such a good feeling to see this , and knowing that my hands touched the rocket and spacecraft . It was the best project I ever worked on. &quot; While most Americans were able to see the moon landing live , Henry Phan , then a child in Vietnam , didn ' t see the footage until two years later . Phan , now 27 and an aerospace_engineer at Rockwell , remembered when the moon landing finally was shown on television in Saigon . &quot; I remember it very well . I was a little boy and my family was watching it on television . It was cool. &quot; Despite the decline of the aerospace and defense industries in Southern California , Wilson told Rockwell workers that the exploration of space will continue to provide jobs for the state . California will be converted from &quot; the arsenal of democracy into the launching_pad of space discovery , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; I am convinced that space exploration is our destiny. &quot; The crew of Apollo 11 was honored in the White_House on Wednesday and could not make the Rockwell celebration . But Gibson , who also was an astronaut on the Apollo 12 moon mission , recalled the first time he viewed the Earth from space . &quot; The Earth appears seamless and without boundaries , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
