   <HEADLINE> U.N. DEBATE OPENS ON POPULATION PLAN ; GROWTH : GORE CALLS ISSUE ' SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM HUMANKIND FACES. ' GOVERNMENT LEADERS FROM PAKISTAN AND NORWAY OFFER DIFFERING ABORTION VIEWS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With bitter disputes flaring here already about abortion , world leaders on Monday started debating a historic global population plan to deal with what Vice_President Al Gore called &quot; the single most important problem humankind faces. &quot; The 20-year voluntary program would for the first time downplay demographers ' traditional preoccupation with sheer numbers in discussing population , focusing instead on enriching the health and lives of women and children and seeking a more balanced sharing of the Earth ' s resources . &quot; We would not be here today if we were not convinced that the rapid and unsustainable growth of human population was an issue of the utmost urgency , &quot; Gore said in his opening remarks to the U.N. Conference on Population and Development , the largest such event ever organized by the United Nations , with almost 20 # 000 participants from around the world . He noted that it has taken &quot; 10 # 000 generations to reach 2 billion ( people ) , and then in one human lifetime -- ours -- we leap from 2 billion toward 10 billion. &quot; &quot; These numbers are not by themselves the problem , &quot; Gore said . &quot; But the startling new pattern they delineate is a symptom of a much larger and deeper spiritual challenge now facing humankind . Will we acknowledge our connections to one another or not ? Will we accept responsibility for the consequences of the choices we make or not ? &quot; There already is broad international consensus on many crucial steps that must be taken_to deal with population problems around the globe : giving women more control over their own lives and health ; improving health_care ; ensuring that economic development eases the burden in the world ' s fastest-growing regions , and widening access to family_planning . But some of the world ' s most powerful religions have attacked this conference for considering issues such_as safe abortion , non-traditional families -- which some interpret as an endorsement of homosexuality -- and adolescent sexuality . The Vatican has been joined by a range of Islamic organizations in_demanding that the U.N. delegates , representing more_than 100 nations , eliminate from their 113-page population blueprint all references_to abortion and other language seen as out of step with traditional family norms . The controversy prompted at least four Muslim countries -- Iraq , Sudan , Saudi_Arabia and Lebanon -- to boycott these sessions , scheduled to run until Sept . 13 . Even moderate Islamic countries like Jordan , Turkey and Bangladesh have downgraded their level of representation here . The depth of feeling about the long-controversial issues was evident at Monday ' s opening ceremonies , especially in remarks by the only two female heads of government appearing here . Benazir Bhutto , prime_minister of predominantly Muslim Pakistan , offered a conservative view on abortion and reproductive issues , warning delegates to deal with such matters carefully to avoid &quot; a clash of cultures. &quot; But Gro Harlem Brundtland , a physician and the prime_minister of Norway , offered an emotional call_for legalizing abortion worldwide to end unnecessary maternal deaths . &quot; Morality becomes hypocrisy if it means accepting mothers . . . dying in connection with unwanted pregnancies and illegal abortions and unwanted children living_in misery , &quot; Brundtland said . &quot; Decriminalizing abortion should therefore be a minimal response to this reality. &quot; U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali -- at_home in his native Egypt , whose population of 59 million grows by 1 million every year -- warned against abandoning the mission of effective population management in the search for compromise . &quot; Tolerance must be shown in the strongest possible way , ( but ) it should not lead to cautious compromises , half measures , vague solutions or , still worse , statements that lull us into complacency , &quot; he said , adding , &quot; such tolerance must also be mutual , for we cannot allow a given philosophical , moral or spiritual belief to be imposed upon the entire international community or to block the progress of humanity. &quot; U.N. population officials have repeatedly emphasized that the draft the conference is considering creates no internationally recognized right to abortion and does not encourage use of abortion in family_planning ; it in fact discusses the procedure only in encouraging measures to protect women against unsafe , illegal abortions . &quot; We must look squarely at the facts about abortion , &quot; said Nafis Sadik , executive_director of the U.N. Population Fund and secretary_general of the Cairo conference . &quot; There may be as_many as 50 million to 60 million abortions a year . This is a serious threat to women ' s lives and health . Between 70 # 000 and 200 # 000 lives are lost each year as a result of abortion. &quot; The Clinton_Administration has repeatedly been attacked and accused of seeking to promote legalized abortion around the world . Gore came_out firing Monday , noting that American aid programs do not cover abortion financing . He also outlined the American policy , which emphasizes that each nation must decide for itself whether to legalize abortion . &quot; The United States Constitution guarantees every woman within our borders a right to choose an abortion , subject_to limited and specific exceptions , &quot; the vice_president said . &quot; We are committed to that principle . But let us take a false issue off the table : The United States does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion , and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family_planning . &quot; We also believe that policy-making in these matters should be the province of each government , within the context of its own laws and national circumstances and consistent with previously agreed human_rights standards , &quot; he added . &quot; We believe that where abortion is permitted , it should be medically safe and that unsafe abortion is a matter of women ' s health that must be addressed. &quot; In recent days , American and European officials have sought to broker a compromise that would help address many of the objections to the population conference draft , some 95 % of which is already in_agreement . Timothy E . Wirth , undersecretary of state for global affairs and a former Colorado senator , said a key provision of the proposed compromise would remove in the draft plan any reference_to abortion in the section on family_planning ; instead , it would go_in the section on reproductive health_care services . This would be done to emphasize that this issue should be decided by each nation , not globally , and the reference would be worded almost identically to Gore ' s description of national policy-making and human_rights . Other compromises would clarify &quot; reproductive rights , &quot; specifying that &quot; sexual and reproductive rights encompass respect for the security and dignity of the person and the physical integrity of the human_body as expressed in human_rights documents. &quot; Wirth noted that the population plan &quot; before the conference is 92 % agreed . . . . I think we are very close to having language arrived_at that will move us from 92 % to close to 100 % . &quot; Still , Gore predicted that the 1994 Cairo population plan , like the two that preceded it in the last two decades , would not win Vatican endorsement . &quot; It is remarkably significant that there is a broader consensus in Cairo than on any document in any international conference in history , &quot; he said in a meeting with a small group of reporters . But he added of the Vatican : &quot; They ' re not going_to agree to the final document in any event , and nobody should be surprised by that . They have other disagreements beyond abortion , including issues related to contraception , and regardless of what changes are likely to be made here , they will not endorse the final document. &quot; Bishop James McHugh of Camden , N.J. , a Vatican delegate , warned that the U.S._government ' s advocacy of abortion as an option for women &quot; would be a powerful incentive to American Catholics to walk away from the Democratic Party , as well as the Clinton Administration. &quot; But Gore said he never expected the support of the Roman_Catholic_Church for the Administration ' s backing of contraception and &quot; within our borders . . . a woman ' s right to choose. &quot; He said the government nonetheless had the backing &quot; of the vast majority of American citizens. &quot; The present proposal , proponents say , is unprecedented because for the first time it moves away from simply relying_on target population figures and contraceptive programs . Instead , leaders here also are considering other ways to improve life for the 1 billion humans who now live_in poverty . They still hope to control the world ' s population growth , holding it by the year 2015 to 7.27 billion rather than the 7.92 billion it is likely to reach if left unchecked . There are also proposals to decrease births by educating women and giving them access to safe contraception and related health_care . But for the first time , world leaders here are also discussing issues such_as : reducing violence against women ; providing family leave for fathers to give them a greater stake in child rearing ; reducing consumption by industrialized nations , and providing a range of reproductive health_care programs -- not just contraceptive services -- to women . &quot; The program emphasizes people rather than numbers , &quot; Sadik said . &quot; It concentrates_on the individual ' s quality_of_life and well-being . It takes a wide view of reproductive health and personal choice . A key objective is to meet the needs of families and individuals , especially women . &quot; The measures called_for are simple and undramatic , &quot; she said . &quot; Implementing the program will , however , call_for commitment to change and dynamism . Based on the highest of moral and ethical principles , it is a reminder to every country that they are collectively responsible_for the quality_of_life of every individual. &quot;</TEXT>
