   <HEADLINE> ANGST REPLACES WAR ATROCITIES IN ANGOLA ; AFRICA : THE COUNTRY IS IN RUINS , LAND_MINES ARE EVERYWHERE . AND THE FIGHTING MAY NOT BE OVER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You can see Angola ' s dreams in little dabs of mortar . In the last few days , here and there , ragged Angolans have started patching the bullet_holes that deface every square_foot of the remaining buildings in what was once the loveliest inland city in Angola . Where MIGs once screamed overhead to deliver bombs in one of Africa ' s longest and most brutal civil_wars , women and children filled streets with song this week . The gray-haired elders of this province assembled in sun-bleached khaki uniforms . Yes , they said , they had seen much war and now worried that their people were tired and hungry . But yes , they also said , they could see a calm of peace settling in the land . That is the good news about Angola . Maybe it is good news , as well , that one can visit the battleground of Kuito -- the bloody Beirut of Angola -- and hear only a single gunshot in an entire morning . In the last couple of years , 25 # 000 people died here , a quarter of the civilian population . But there is bad news here . There always is . Despite the first signs of reconstruction to emerge from a Nov . 22 peace accord , Kuito is , in truth , a pile of rubble . Once it had a Mediterranean flavor , with pastel villas and wide boulevards . But the devastation of war is the worst that veteran relief workers say they have seen in modern times , greater than in Vietnam , more horrible than in Afghanistan . Today , almost all_the buildings are uninhabitable , and survivors live_on dirt . Even the cemetery is destroyed . And even if everything went right here from today on , and the world poured_out its heart to help , a Western explosives expert said it could take 300 years to clear from the lush soil the war ' s legacy of land_mines . There are ceramic mines in the ground here , and they might last many centuries . There are more of them here than anywhere in the world -- perhaps 20 million in a country of 10 million people . And worse news still : The brutal , 19-year grudge match of a war between rebel Jonas Savimbi and the government now headed by Jose Eduardo dos Santos may_not be over at all . It is possible , even likely , that the extended trench warfare that divided this city down the middle only two years ago will mutate into a grinding guerrilla campaign of terror and counter-terror in the cities and villages . As the holidays approach , the first 50 of a contingent of perhaps 7 # 000 U.N. peacekeepers have moved_into position to try to keep sporadic skirmishes from exploding again into all-out conflict . The United States is providing one-third of the costs . Relief agencies have swarmed into the countryside with food , cooking_oil and medicine . Practically everyone has fingers crossed , for lack of anything else to do . Savimbi recently emerged from hiding to reveal discord within the ranks of his 28-year-old National Union for the Total Independence of Angola , or UNITA , movement . He added that his soldiers will not obey a U.N. plan to end 19 years of civil_war , a Paris newspaper reported Wednesday . And the Dos Santos government ' s recent military advances are such_that it can all but claim a conventional military victory over UNITA , so why settle for a compromise peace that is at the heart of the United Nations ' goal here ? Hard-line militarists are believed to be pushing for continued attacks on UNITA . However , government officials such_as Economics Minister Jose Pedro de Morais Jr . speak reassuringly to the West : &quot; They have no choice , the leaders of this country . They have to follow the path of change -- in other words , political and economic democracy. &quot; Many outside the government are skeptical , or at least uncertain . Western influence here , unlike in many troubled African_countries , is limited because the government has its own oil revenue to pursue potential military aims . &quot; Right now , it ' s impossible to say whether to be optimistic or pessimistic , &quot; said U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake , who toured Angola on Monday and Tuesday to nudge both sides toward reconciliation . &quot; If you ' re optimistic , you might not work hard enough . If you ' re pessimistic , you might give up. &quot; A reserved man under almost all circumstances , Lake was visibly furious at the sights and stories of a war that had cost so_much and gained so little in Angola : * A green , placid field where 2 # 000 villagers were caught in cross-fire and killed while foraging for food . Some of the bodies remain there still . No one can get_to them for fear of mines . * Fresh mangoes hanging from trees while people suffer malnutrition . Better to risk hunger than join the 150 to 200 civilians who die each week from buried explosives . * The memory of a humanitarian cargo plane that was shot down and crash-landed . The pilot lived . He crawled from the burning plane only to find himself in a minefield . He was injured , and a cease-fire could not be arranged before he bled to death . &quot; It ' s a tragedy that a country so rich_in resources , in people , should be reduced to this , &quot; Lake said . Privately , he was heard to put his emotions less delicately . On behalf of President Clinton , Lake met separately with Dos Santos and a delegation of UNITA officials to try to drive_home the West ' s new message to this oil-rich , politically impoverished nation . &quot; I stress that this may be the last best chance for peace here , &quot; Lake said . &quot; If two peace efforts failed , I ' m not sure the international community will support a third. &quot; The shaky peace negotiated just a month ago in Lusaka , Zambia , followed a U.N.-supervised Angolan election in September , 1992 . No sooner did Savimbi lose the election than he resumed full-scale war which continues today -- despite the peace accord -- in the form of skirmishes in the nation ' s inland areas . Angola , on the continent ' s southwest coast , is one of the few African_countries in which Americans have a significant economic stake . Up to 7 % of U.S. gasoline imports come from coastal Angolan oil leases , and U.S. exports here are the third highest on the continent , behind South_Africa and Nigeria . The country is also blessed with diamonds , a large breadbasket region , reliable rain and healthy fishing grounds . But for 13 years leading_up to independence from Portugal and for 19 years since , the nation has been almost perpetually at war .</TEXT>
