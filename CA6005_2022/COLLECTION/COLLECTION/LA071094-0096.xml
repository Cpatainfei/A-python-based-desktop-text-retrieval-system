   <HEADLINE> POSSUM DEATH STIRS DEBATE OVER CRUELTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The opossum and her seven babies made the mistake of crossing in front of Steven Garity ' s car . They got squished . Garity made the mistake of being in front of a police_car . He got charged with cruelty to animals . And so began the Great Possum Debate , with people around here sinking their teeth into a spirited discussion of animal rights : Are possums such pests that you can ' t be cruel enough to them ? Or do they deserve as much respect as any other living creature ? A judge added his opinion last month , dismissing the case and declaring Tumwater ' s animal-cruelty ordinance too vague . But given the possum passions in this western Washington town , the last word on road-kill morality has yet to be heard . &quot; I ' m not a lawyer and certainly not a judge , &quot; said Michael Ellis , director of a wildlife rescue center in nearby McCleary . &quot; But I have to say that any human_being with any sense of humanity would realize that aiming a car at any animal and running it over intentionally is cruelty. &quot; The case began March 31 , when police_officer Johnna Stevens saw Garity , 39 , suddenly change lanes and hit a mother possum and the youngsters clinging_to her . &quot; They ' re pests , &quot; the officer quoted Garity as saying . &quot; All ' s they do is eat dog_food and cat_food and be a pest . They just hiss at you. &quot; Garity was accused of intentionally running_down the possums and was cited under Tumwater ' s animal-cruelty ordinance , which says it is a crime to &quot; purposefully or recklessly subjects any animal to cruel mistreatment. &quot; The offense carries up_to 90 days in jail and a $ 5 # 000 fine . Garity ' s attorney , Ken Valz , contended Garity was swerving to miss another possum . Valz also argued that the whole case was ludicrous because state wildlife officials consider the possum a pest . He cited a Department of Natural_Resources brochure that tells how to kill a &quot; problem &quot; possum : After trapping it , &quot; gently submerge the trap in water for 10 minutes. &quot; &quot; Most people are astounded that it ' s gone this far -- that any government would prosecute anyone for running_over a possum , intentionally or unintentionally , &quot; Valz said . But the homely possum -- a beady-eyed , naked-tailed marsupial that looks as if nature built it from spare_parts -- has its supporters too . For weeks , possums have been the No . 1 topic in the letters section of the local paper , the Olympian . Writers have been about evenly split , pro-Garity vs . pro-possum . Possum sympathizers tend to invoke comparisons to more likable animals . &quot; What ' s next -- my puppy becomes a pest to someone ? Our cat becomes a pest in someone ' s mind ? Maybe someday my son will become a pest to someone , &quot; wrote Laura Perkinson . &quot; Will that someone then decide to just run_over any or all_of these things ? &quot; Garity ' s supporters lump possums with all manner of vermin . &quot; What would you have said if it had been a rat ? The opossum is worse than a rat in most any way you can think -- larger , more dangerous , and filthy , &quot; wrote J . Dana Kintner . Mina Ensign wrote : &quot; Will some ardent environmentalists soon propose a fine for swatting a fly , lest it interfere with the food_chain ? &quot; City Attorney Pat Brock said the case clearly fell_under Tumwater ' s animal-cruelty ordinance . He said there are exceptions under state law for hunting or for protecting property from pests , and neither applied in this case . But District Judge C . L . Stilz ruled last month that the ordinance is unconstitutional because it doesn ' t spell_out &quot; cruel mistreatment. &quot; Brock said he will consult with the City_Council about what to do next . &quot; we ' ll have to think_about whether the council wants to regulate the type of conduct Mr. Garity wants to engage in , &quot; Brock said . &quot; The part of it that bothers me -- putting aside the value of opossums as animals -- is that , at a minimum , he made a big mess on a road for someone else to clean up. &quot;</TEXT>
