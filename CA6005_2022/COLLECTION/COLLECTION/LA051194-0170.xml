   <TEXT> Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was sworn_in Tuesday as South_Africa ' s first black president in a joyous celebration that ended the agony of apartheid and marked an official welcome for the world ' s newest democracy into the community of nations . &quot; The sun shall never set_on so glorious a human achievement ! &quot; Mandela proclaimed in an impassioned inaugural_address that appealed for peace , reconciliation and healing in this troubled land . &quot; Let freedom reign. &quot; As a symbol of his commitment to human_rights , he said the new government would consider granting amnesty to prisoners &quot; as a matter of urgency. &quot; He did not provide details . Princes , presidents , potentates and prime_ministers -- 6 # 036 dignitaries in all , from nearly every country in the world -- watched as Mandela strode to the podium , carefully put_on his gold reading glasses and began to read the 133-word oath of office with his left_hand on a goatskin-covered Bible . He was so eager he began before the chief_justice , Michael Corbett , had asked him . &quot; In the presence of those assembled here and in full realization of the high calling I assume as president . . . , &quot; Mandela then began to recite again . When he finished , at precisely 12:17 p.m. , Mandela raised his right_hand and added , &quot; So help me God , &quot; and the new South_Africa was officially born . His amplified voice echoed down a long hill and boomed_out across a multiracial sea of tens of thousands of supporters , while his radiant smile beamed from giant television screens . Many wept , hugged or ululated in glee as the authority of government was finally handed from the white minority to the black majority , and Mandela ' s triumph became their own . He dedicated the sun-dappled day of Western pomp and African tribal ceremony to the millions who dreamed , fought or died for liberty here . In a rich , resonant voice , he pledged to &quot; lead our country out of the valley of darkness. &quot; The inauguration , in the open-air amphitheater of the stately Union Buildings , the government ' s seat of power and the emblem of white rule , completed a remarkable personal journey for Mandela . At 75 , he has devoted his life -- including 27 years as a martyr in prison -- to ending the injustice of apartheid and guiding Africa ' s richest nation from the brink of civil_war to a chance for peace . His metamorphosis from enemy of the state to father of the nation was_best symbolized , perhaps , after the speech . The new black commander_in_chief turned_to the wall of bulletproof glass , suddenly required to protect him , and peered out_to review an honor_guard of marching troops from the army he once fought as a guerrilla leader . The white chiefs of the armed_services , their chests hung with medals , stood approvingly at his side as cannons_fired a salute . Moments later , more_than 60 Mirage fighter jets , trainer planes and military helicopters roared overhead in a flyby of six diamond-shaped formations . The final group spewed brilliant long plumes of red , yellow , black , red , white and blue vapor -- the colors of the new South_African flag . Four choppers then clattered by , with huge flags fluttering on poles hung beneath them . Earlier , in his address , Mandela paid tribute to the security_forces , including the police , for their protection of last month ' s democratic elections and their transition from &quot; bloodthirsty forces which still refuse to see the light. &quot; &quot; The time for the healing of the wounds has come , &quot; he added . Mandela denounced the brutalities of legalized racial_segregation as &quot; an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too , too long. &quot; He spoke movingly of &quot; the depth of pain we all carried in our hearts as we saw our country tear itself apart in a terrible conflict. &quot; South_Africa was &quot; spurned , outlawed and isolated &quot; by the world &quot; precisely because it had become the universal base of the pernicious ideology and practice of racism and racial oppression. &quot; But the first all-race voting produced &quot; political emancipation , &quot; he said . &quot; We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing bondage of poverty , deprivation , suffering , gender and other discrimination. &quot; In a land where the most emotive annual holiday is the Day of the Covenant , when white Afrikaners give_thanks for a bloody 19th-Century victory over Zulu warriors , Mandela pledged his own &quot; covenant &quot; to build a society in which all South_Africans are &quot; assured of their inalienable right to human dignity -- a rainbow nation at_peace with itself and the world. &quot; The dignitaries wore a riot of colorful national costumes , from flowing African robes to billowing silk saris . And there was an astonishing array of headgear , from flowing turbans and tasseled fezzes , to kaffiyehs and Panama hats . Others simply shielded their heads with inaugural programs as the hot sun burned_off the morning mist and the 11 a.m. ceremony was delayed until the heat of noon . The crowd interrupted Mandela several times with applause . But the cheers were loudest when he spoke most dramatically . &quot; Never , &quot; he said , &quot; never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another . . . . &quot; He singled_out for praise the last white president , Frederik W . de Klerk , who freed him from prison in February , 1990 . They joined forces to use peaceful negotiations to unscramble one of the world ' s worst racial conflicts . The result , after four years , has been universal suffrage elections and multi-party democracy in a former police_state . De Klerk , 58 , head of the National Party , and Thabo Mbeki , 52 , chairman of the African National Congress , will join Mandela ' s coalition government as deputy executive presidents . Both were sworn_in before Mandela . De Klerk chose Afrikaans , the language of his forebears , while Mbeki used English . After Mandela ' s speech , leaders of the new government went_down to the lawns below , where a concert and dance performance was under way , to speak_to the gathered crowds . Mandela ' s remarks were probably most generous toward the man with whom he has repeatedly clashed in public . He said De Klerk had &quot; engraved his niche &quot; in the country ' s history and praised him as &quot; one of the greatest reformers , one of the greatest sons of our soil. &quot; But Mandela ' s comments were less notable than his security . The three men , plus the wives of De Klerk and Mbeki , stood_in what appeared to be a giant shower_stall . Constructed of thick bulletproof glass , the enclosure made the group look_like a diorama in a natural_history museum . The amphitheater held a partial Who ' s Who of world leaders . Vice_President Al Gore , his wife , Tipper , and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton led a U.S. delegation of 65 , the largest of any nation . Gore ' s third-row seat ultimately wound_up in the fifth row as new chairs were hastily added_up front for late-arriving , or disgruntled , leaders . One of the last to arrive was Cuba ' s Fidel Castro , who wore his olive-green military_uniform . The gray-bearded president of one of the world ' s last Communist countries got a front-row seat and drew cries of &quot; Viva Castro ! &quot; as well as the greatest gaggle of photographers . Castro told reporters he had read Gore ' s book on the environment during the long flight from Havana , but there were no plans for the two men to meet . Elsewhere in the audience were Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Yasser Arafat , chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization . The two men met together with Mandela on Monday . South_Africa ' s two former colonial rulers , Britain and the_Netherlands , were represented by Prince Philip , the Duke of Edinburgh and consort of Queen Elizabeth_II , and the Prince of Orange . U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , who was attending the inauguration in happy violation of protocol , heaped praise on Mandela in a speech of introduction at the official lunch . When it was his turn , Mandela spoke with emotion of an unlikely trio of old friends whom he had invited as special VIPs to the inauguration : his former jailers . He publicly thanked the three white guards who helped him most in his years as the world ' s best-known political_prisoner . &quot; I wanted them to share this because they had a part in it , &quot; he explained . After the Celebration , a Host of Problems South_African President Nelson Mandela has pressing problems to tackle when the euphoria of election victory ends . * Unemployment : 40 % * Illiteracy : 50 % * High expectations : The black majority , 75 % of the population , expects him to keep his promise of providing jobs , 2 million houses , education , health_care and services such_as water and electricity to millions during the next five years . * Violence : Clashes continue between Mandela ' s African National Congress and the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party , particularly in KwaZulu-Natal province . * Politics of compromise : The governing structure of national unity -- in which Mandela ' ANC party must compromise , not fight , with the opposition -- could impede quick action .
