   <HEADLINE> ' 3 STRIKES ' LOOPHOLE CAN GIVE OFFENDERS A BREAK ; LAW : SOME FELONS ' NEW ARRESTS ARE TREATED AS PAROLE VIOLATIONS , WHICH AT MOST DRAW ONE YEAR IN PRISON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scores of prison parolees arrested for felonies in Los Angeles County have slipped through a little noticed loophole in the &quot; three strikes &quot; law and avoided stiff new penalties prescribed by the measure . Instead of striking out when arrested on new charges , these offenders have lucked out . A loophole in the law allows a parolee ' s new arrest -- even for a brutal or serious crime -- to be processed as an administrative parole violation , outside the reach of the get-tough crime law signed by the governor in March . Rodney E . Hudson , for example , had already amassed six strikes when he was arrested for violently assaulting a fellow resident of a homeless shelter in April . Hudson , who once burst into the quiet living_room of a Riverside family and opened_fire while absconding with his loot , could have faced 25 years or more in prison . But instead of pressing charges , the district_attorney ' s office referred him to parole officials , who imposed their maximum penalty -- one year in prison . The prosecutor said the most recent case was flawed , largely because police could not locate the victim for further questioning -- even though he was subsequently found by parole authorities and The Times . Deputy District Atty . David Traum , whose unit screens such cases , said his office refers felony arrests to parole officials only if the cases are very weak or the offenses are relatively minor . &quot; It ' s not supposed to be a way to get_rid_of cases , &quot; Traum said . &quot; If they ' re doing that , it ' s wrong. &quot; Over the years prosecutors , especially those in Los Angeles County , have relied_on parole revocations as a swift , sure and economical way to dispose_of certain felony cases and send ex-convicts to prison for up_to a year . The practice has continued under &quot; three strikes &quot; but the stakes have changed dramatically : Now the courts can impose up_to a life sentence for some crimes while a one-year prison_term remains the maximum penalty for a parole violation , no matter how serious the offense or how many strikes the parolee has in his past . The Times examined police , court , parole and prosecutor files for 100 of the 239 felony arrestees sent by the district_attorney to parole authorities from mid-March through the end of August . Records show that many parolees who were not prosecuted are violent , repeat offenders -- the sort of criminals expressly targeted by the new &quot; three strikes &quot; law . Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti said he has not studied the cases his deputies have referred to parole authorities . This area , he added , is &quot; probably something I need to reflect on. &quot; Garcetti acknowledged that there is a potential for prosecutors to circumvent the &quot; three strikes &quot; law by referring prosecutable cases to parole authorities . &quot; I guess you could say it is ( a loophole ) if in fact there ' s a concerted effort by the people in any D.A. ' s office throughout the state to avoid ' three strikes , ' &quot; he said . The district_attorney stressed , however , that his office is committed to following the letter and the spirit of &quot; three strikes. &quot; The law , which does not even mention the word &quot; parole , &quot; is aimed at criminals with prior convictions for serious or violent crimes . The penalties are doubled for felons with one prior strike . Those with two or more strikes face terms of 25 years to life . Voters will be asked to affirm the new law on Nov . 8 . Although the new statute drastically reduces the discretion of judges in sentencing , prosecutors have retained great latitude in determining whether charges should be filed_in the first place , or the case should be sent to parole officials . In examining 100 felony arrests referred by prosecutors to parole authorities , The Times found : In one out of five cases , the parolee had a petty or nonviolent criminal background with no prior strikes . In one out of four , prosecutors lacked information in their files to determine whether the parolee had prior strikes or not , and was subject_to an enhanced penalty if convicted . More_than half the parolees had accumulated at least one prior strike for serious or violent crimes , or were facing a strike as a result of their most recent arrests . Many had multiple strikes for crimes including murder , rape , arson , robbery and residential burglary . For example , records show that : * Norman Anthony Moore had one prior strike for setting fire to an apartment occupied by his ex-girlfriend and her two children . Then he was arrested in July on suspicion of using a screwdriver to kill a man who had been flirting_with a female friend . Deputy Dist . Atty . Theodore Loewen said that it was &quot; clear &quot; Moore committed the murder , but that the admissible evidence &quot; may be insufficient &quot; to convict him . * Andre Juniel is a veteran gang member with five prior strikes for robberies , including the armed holdup of an elderly man . Although several police_officers observed Juniel fleeing with a gun in his waistband in March , they did not recover the weapon when they arrested him for possessing a gun . Juniel initially confessed but later retracted his statement . Deputy Dist . Atty . Traum said , &quot; To be honest , some D.A.s might file this case , &quot; but he added that he believes the case could not be won . &quot; Maybe I ' m wrong . . . but we ' ll never know because we never filed it. &quot; * James Brewer had accumulated two strikes -- for shooting into an occupied dwelling and for sodomizing an 8-year-old girl . Police pulled him over for a traffic violation in April and observed a loaded gun on the front passenger floorboard of the car , a gun_case on the seat next to him and 23 rounds of ammunition in the back seat . Brewer denied owning the gun or the vehicle , so Deputy Dist . Atty . Jaime Hernandez decided not to file charges . &quot; If he ' d confessed , we ' d be home free , &quot; said Hernandez . * Cornell Stefin had one prior strike for murdering his grandmother , then stealing her car to escape and pawning her valuables . In April , Stefin admitted to police that he stole his sister ' s property , valued at $ 1 # 500 , and pawned it for money to buy drugs . Loewen declined to prosecute Stefin for grand theft . Loewen ' s boss , Traum , reviewed the case after a reporter ' s inquiry and concluded that charges should have been filed . &quot; I think we could have convicted him , &quot; he said . Loewen said he was &quot; not absolutely &quot; certain but recalled that the victim had refused to testify . The victim said in an interview that she was willing to testify and was disappointed when prosecutors took no action . In each of the above cases , parole officials determined that there was a preponderance of evidence supporting the alleged offenses and returned the parolees to prison for up_to a year . However , the new parole violation -- regardless of its severity -- is not recorded as a &quot; strike &quot; because , under the law , only court convictions can count as strikes . Garcetti said he would like to review all_the cases his deputies have referred to parole . &quot; If we found , ' Hey , these are some cases that could have been prosecuted , ' then we can change that , &quot; he said . &quot; We can tell our people , ' You should be filing these cases within the system. ' &quot; * The central complaints unit of the district_attorney ' s office in Downtown Los Angeles is staffed by 12 veteran full-time and six part-time deputy district_attorneys who rarely set foot in a courtroom . They tediously screen dozens of arrests each day to size_up which should be prosecuted or rejected , or referred to parole authorities . Although deputies are obliged to file charges whenever there is sufficient evidence to prove a crime , Garcetti said his office is under &quot; pressure from the courts and everyone involved in the justice system . . . to limit the number of cases. &quot; In the complaints unit , decisions must be made quickly , because arrestees must be charged or released within 48 hours of arrest . Often , police work_on the case is unfinished . &quot; The workload is so great in some divisions , &quot; said prosecutor Hernandez , &quot; that patrolmen don ' t even have time to get the names of witnesses. &quot; The complaints unit is described by one veteran deputy as &quot; high-pressure , high-volume work with little recognition. &quot; During the first six months the new law was in_effect , the district_attorney ' s various complaints units filed 33 # 000 felony cases , including 7 # 789 first- or multiple-strike cases . They rejected 14 # 000 felony arrests for prosecution , including many cases referred to parole authorities by police or prosecutors . In 239 of the cases rejected for filing , prosecutors filled_out computerized forms specifically earmarking the_matters for parole authorities . Additional cases were referred there by prosecutors , but were not listed as parole referrals , records show . In rejecting cases , prosecutors often noted weaknesses such_as insufficient evidence , unavailable witnesses , reluctant victims , or incomplete or sloppy police work . &quot; We don ' t file just slam-dunks , &quot; Traum said . &quot; We file difficult cases , but we have to believe we can prove a case before we file it . Sometimes , a case is bungled so badly by police that prosecutors decide it is doomed in the courtroom . Deputy Dist . Atty . Richard Weber blamed inept police work in April for ruining any chance of convicting parolee Charles Carter , who was facing a third strike . Weber noted that police accidentally mixed cocaine recovered from the arrestee ' s pocket with some_other cocaine they found on the floor of the police_station . &quot; A good case ( ' three strikes ' ) turned_to s--- , &quot; Weber said in a case summary . Carter , 36 , already had two strikes against him from a 1984 robbery and brutal beating of a sleeping 73-year-old man . In the latest case , parole authorities gave Carter nine months in prison , but he was released in half that time for good behavior . In many cases , flawed police work or reluctant victims unquestionably left prosecutors little choice but to decline filing charges . But in others , the decision angered victims and police or surprised parole officials . A carjacking victim said she was so distraught when prosecutors declined to press robbery charges against her assailant that she called and complained bitterly to the district_attorney ' s office . Gregory Daniels , a parolee with two prior strikes for robbery , was arrested on suspicion of attacking her April 14 . He allegedly held a gun to her head , choked her and stabbed her foot with a screwdriver before tearing the jewelry off her ears and fingers and fleeing in her car . Daniels had been convicted of a strikingly similar robbery a decade ago . LAPD Detective Richard Record said he objected when the district_attorney ' s office declined to press charges in the carjacking . However , he said , it was the victim who finally persuaded prosecutors to reverse themselves . &quot; I can ' t believe how hard I had to push these people just to do their job , &quot; said the victim . Deputy Dist . Atty . Loewen said he initially rejected the case for prosecution because the victim appeared to lack credibility . But he said he changed his mind after they talked on the phone . A 19-year-old student who was jumped and badly beaten in August by gang members is another victim upset with prosecutors . He was allegedly insulted racially and attacked with rocks and sticks . &quot; Due_to my injuries , I couldn ' t walk , could barely see because of dizziness and had aches and pains in my legs , &quot; he said in a written statement from his hospital_bed . He asked_for prosecution &quot; to the fullest &quot; of parolee Manuel Sanchez , 20 , who had a prior strike for using a gun to steal a car . Deputy Dist . Atty . Lucienne Coleman said that because the victim was not hit in the head or beaten severely , it would be difficult to prove felony assault charges against Sanchez . Coleman referred his case to parole officials , but the police_detective did not alert parole authorities because he said he did not think he was required to , and Sanchez was mistakenly released . Contacted by a reporter , parole authorities did not know of Sanchez ' s arrest or his whereabouts . Police usually notify parole officials when a parolee is arrested . While the alleged violator remains in custody , parole authorities must investigate but have the discretion to release him and take no action . Parolee Michael Hilliard , who already had three strikes , was simply ordered by parole officials to stay 100 feet away from a woman whom he allegedly terrorized in May . Police said Hilliard broke_through her door , demanded food_stamps and ransacked the kitchen , while she and her children cowered . He already had amassed two strikes for armed_robberies and a third for forcing a woman to perform oral copulation on him at knifepoint . But Deputy Dist . Atty . Wendy Moss said that since Hilliard did not take anything , she could not prove that he intended to commit felony burglary . &quot; He may have trespassed or committed malicious_mischief , &quot; Moss said , &quot; but that ' s not a felony. &quot; Another parolee , Daniel Rodriguez , who already had one strike for shooting at a police_officer , suffered no consequences whatsoever from his illegal weapons arrest in April . Police observed Rodriguez standing at a corner brazenly swinging nunchukas , martial_arts fighting sticks that can be used for striking or strangling people . The weapon was booked into evidence . &quot; It was a cut-and-dried case and it got rejected , &quot; said Police_Officer Victoria Shroyer . Deputy Dist . Atty . Hernandez said he declined to prosecute Rodriguez in part because judges typically reduce cases involving nunchukas to misdemeanors punishable by a maximum of one year in county jail . But when Hernandez referred the case to parole officials , they took no action and Rodriguez remained free . * Unlike court trials that cost taxpayers an estimated $ 6 # 000 a day and can last for weeks , parole revocation hearings are inelegant , low-budget proceedings that rarely take more_than about an hour . They are held amid tight security in the cramped hearing rooms of state_prisons or county jails . Presiding are a dozen hearing_officers , without gavels or robes , who travel the state like the circuit judges of yesteryear . They typically finish six cases a day with the proceedings memorialized by a cassette_tape recorder instead of a stenographer . Usually no attorneys are present , but testimony is given under oath . Parolees are warned that what is said at the hearing can later be used against them in court . They frequently make rambling statements to deny or explain their behavior . Hearsay_evidence is allowed , which means that when victims or witnesses do not attend , police_officers or parole agents are allowed to relate their accounts . The case of parolee Rodney Hudson -- the six-strike man accused of attacking a fellow resident in a homeless shelter -- was heard May 16 . Hudson had racked_up strikes for armed_robberies and assaults as well as convictions for burglary , drugs and battery , various parole violations and a lengthy juvenile record . Deputy Dist . Atty . Debra Starr said she declined to prosecute Hudson for assault with a deadly weapon because police were unable to locate the victim and failed to book into evidence Hudson ' s alleged weapons -- a telephone and bug spray . She said it &quot; certainly would have made a difference if the victim were available. &quot; Police reported that Hudson punched the victim and dragged him across a parking_lot , suspecting that he had stolen his watch . Then Hudson allegedly followed the victim into the shelter and pummeled him in the office of the supervisor , pinned him to the floor , struck him with a telephone , and sprayed his mouth with a can of ant and roach spray . &quot; That man is dangerous , &quot; the victim told The Times . The victim missed Hudson ' s parole hearing . He called_in to say he was late and had missed the bus . Police_officers and a principal witness , the shelter ' s supervisor , also failed to attend . Hudson admitted fighting with the victim but denied striking him with the phone or spraying him . Nevertheless , based on a parole agent ' s summary of the case , the hearing_officer found good grounds to believe that Hudson had committed battery and attempted to commit assault with a deadly weapon . Hearing officer Monica Smith said in an interview that she could not remember Hudson ' s case , but that she hears matters every day involving violent crimes . Often prosecutors filed no charges in these cases , she said , because &quot; certain information hadn ' t surfaced until the ( parole ) hearing , or the investigation wasn ' t completed or something just fell_through the cracks. &quot; Occasionally , she said , a parolee makes an admission or a victim or witness comes_forward to provide a break_in the case . But she said it is unusual for a prosecutor to display interest at that point in a case . Records show that out of 9 # 000 parole revocation hearings held statewide during the first six months of this year , the tapes of only 38 were subpoenaed by prosecutors , including just three by the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office . None involved cases filed since &quot; three strikes &quot; went_into effect . &quot; It ' s pretty rare you get something you can use , &quot; explained Traum . Nevertheless , he is considering developing a new policy to help prosecutors &quot; follow up &quot; on parole hearings on the chance that new evidence surfaced , he said . Veteran parole hearing_officer Richard Washington sees up close the cases that prosecutors have declined to pursue , he said . &quot; They ( prosecutors ) let us revoke them instead of prosecuting , &quot; Washington said , adding that this has been common practice for years . Pontrell Williams was arrested July 5 after an off-duty police_officer observed him and another suspect gun_down a man who owed them money . Though Williams was not the triggerman , he was identified as an accomplice and driver of the getaway car . Over the objections of the homicide detective , Deputy Dist . Atty . Coleman declined to prosecute Williams , mainly because of the difficulty in proving he knew a murder was going_to take_place . Instead , she referred the case to parole authorities because Williams had admitted selling drugs at a rock cocaine house . After a parole hearing that lasted about half an hour Aug . 19 , hearing_officer Washington concluded that Williams had not only sold cocaine and acted_as an accessory to the murder , but attempted to commit murder as well . Williams , 24 , who had already served three prison_terms for stealing cars and evading police_officers during a dangerous high-speed chase , received the maximum penalty of one year in prison . Washington said he is frustrated that he cannot impose any greater punishment . &quot; We see more murder cases than the average Superior_Court judge sees in a lifetime , &quot; he said . &quot; I saw six in one day . It ' s not unusual to see two in a day. &quot; &quot; They ( the unprosecuted parolees ) are delighted , because they ' ve beat the big rap . We give them just a year and they say , ' Oh , I can do that standing on my head ! ' &quot; The Paths Back to Prison Instead of prosecuting parolees for new felony arrests , the district_attorney can send parolees to state parole authorities , who operate out_of_reach of the new &quot; three strikes &quot; law . The maximum penalty parole officials can impose on parolees arrested for new crimes is one year in prison , no matter how serious the parolee ' s new offense or how many strikes the parolee has accumulated . The chart below illustrates two paths back to prison for parolees , and the vast difference in_length of prison_terms that can be meted_out by the courts and by authorities . Parolee arrested Case referred to the district_attorney PAROLE PATH No charges filed Parole agents review arrest Parole revocation hearing held Parole revoked Maximum penalty : ONE YEAR IN PRISON PROSECUTION PATH Charges filed_in court Court trial or plea bargain Court conviction Maximum penalty : LIFE IN PRISON About 24 # 000 parolees returned to prison by parole authorities for parole violations and new arrests in 1992 . These include 6 # 000 parolees arrested for violent crimes , 4 # 000 arrest for property crimes and 4 # 000 arrested for drug offenses . About 18 # 000 parolees returned to prison by the courts with new sentences for new crimes in 1992 . These include 2 # 800 parolees convicted of violent crimes , 8 # 200 convicted of property crimes and 5 # 400 convicted of drug offenses .

Routed Around ' Three Strikes ' After felony arrests , these parolees with prior strikes were referred by the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office for administrative parole hearings : DERRICK BOWIE In late March , Bowie was arrested for assaulting a woman motorist with a broomstick and taking her property from her car after a traffic collision and brawl . Bowie already had one strike for brandishing a firearm at a peace_officer , as well as arrests on suspicion of murder and kidnaping that had not been prosecuted . As a juvenile , he was convicted of murder and four counts of assault with a firearm arising from a drive-by_shooting . During the March incident , police got statements from various witnesses and recovered the broomstick that Bowie allegedly used as a weapon . Deputy Dist . Atty . Rebecca Lewis , who reviewed the arrest , was the same prosecutor who had won the murder_conviction against Bowie 13 years earlier . In declining to file assault charges against him , she noted that witnesses gave conflicting accounts and that Bowie had claimed self-defense . She referred the case to parole authorities . They returned Bowie to prison for one year . TONY WASHINGTON Washington was arrested in mid-March on suspicion of grand theft auto when he was spotted driving a car reported stolen . At the time , Washington had already piled_up six strikes for residential burglaries and one for robbery , as well as convictions for selling narcotics and numerous parole revocations for alleged offenses that were not prosecuted . When he was arrested in March , he told police that he had borrowed the car from a friend . Noting that Washington had keys to the ignition , Deputy Dist . Atty . Ellen Berk declined to file charges . &quot; If somebody has the keys and makes no incriminating statement and doesn ' t run , it ' s normally not a filing , &quot; she said . However , parole officials concluded that Washington had committed grand theft auto and returned him to prison for nine months . He did not contest their findings . ALGIMANTOS ENREKUS Enrekus was arrested but not prosecuted in May on suspicion of setting fire to a halfway house . Enrekus , a Russian immigrant who spent 35 years in Siberian prisons , had one prior strike for attempting to commit arson . Probation officials identified him as the suspect in 11 blazes set_in two Lithuanian communities where he lived . In May , residents of the halfway house said the fire broke_out just a_few minutes after Enrekus was rattling the windows to get_in after curfew . Deputy Dist . Atty . Ellen Berk declined to press charges against Enrekus , despite strenuous objections from arson investigator Derek Chew , who said in an interview : &quot; We ' ve convicted people with less ( evidence ) . &quot; Berk characterized the evidence against Enrekus as &quot; less than circumstantial , &quot; and urged investigators to try to locate an unnamed witness who reportedly had seen him fleeing . Enrekus asked through an interpreter at the parole hearing : &quot; If I am really considered to have started an arson , and this is a criminal offense , why am I not being tried in a court of law ? &quot; He was returned to prison for a year by parole authorities . WALTER AUSTIN Austin was arrested in April on suspicion of assault with a firearm . He had previous convictions for drugs and weapons , and a prior strike for firing a semiautomatic weapon , point-blank , at a victim who backed_away begging for his life . One of the bullets lodged_in the victim ' s neck . Deputy Dist . Atty . Theodore Loewen decided that Austin ' s April arrest would be &quot; better handled as ( a ) parole violation &quot; because the victim failed to make a timely report of shots that Austin allegedly fired during a dispute over money . Police_Officer Christopher Amador , who arrested Austin , agreed that proving an assault charge in court would be difficult , but said prosecutors could have charged a lesser offense -- ex-convict in possession of a gun -- that could have subjected Austin to a seven-year prison_term . At his parole hearing , Austin was returned to prison for 10 months , after the hearing_officer concluded that he had violated parole by possessing a gun . HUGO LICEA Licea was arrested in May for robbery after he allegedly approached a car , reached in the window and grabbed a gold chain from the driver ' s neck . Licea admitted to police that he had asked the victim for money but denied taking anything . Licea already had a conviction for selling drugs and one prior strike for pulling a knife on a pedestrian , robbing him of his wallet and tearing_off his gold necklace . Deputy Dist . Atty . Loewen declined to prosecute Licea in May , noting that police did not recover the chain and that the only witness was a friend of the suspect ' s . The victim was cooperative and testified at Licea ' s parole revocation hearing , where it was determined that Licea had committed robbery . He was returned to prison for 10 months . Licea ' s parole agent , Michael Mays , said , &quot; If the D.A. had . . . convicted him in court he ' d have a second strike , and he could get life next time &quot; that he is convicted of a felony .
