   <HEADLINE> HILL RESIGNS BUT FAILS TO SET DEPARTURE DATE ; SENATE : COMMITTEE PUTS ASIDE MOTION TO EXPEL THE CONVICTED LAWMAKER , PENDING CLARIFICATION OF HIS APPARENT INTENTION TO REMAIN UNTIL SENTENCING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Republican state Sen . Frank Hill of Whittier , convicted last week of corruption , resigned Thursday , but threw the Senate into confusion by refusing to say when he will actually leave . In a one-paragraph letter , Hill , 40 , said his resignation would &quot; become effective immediately upon an official judgment_of_conviction , &quot; which commonly occurs when a defendant is sentenced to prison . For Hill , this is scheduled to happen Sept . 12 , when he appears in U.S. District Court to face sentencing on his conviction for extortion , conspiracy and money_laundering . He faces a sentence that could exceed six years in prison . Hill , who has refused public comment since his conviction , declined to elaborate on his letter . Hill submitted his resignation shortly after a demand was made on the Senate floor by Sen . Leroy Greene ( D-Carmichael ) , chairman of the Ethics Committee , for Hill to be expelled immediately . Greene told colleagues that to ignore the federal_court jury verdict &quot; is to turn our back on the criminal justice system which we have established. &quot; &quot; The people of this state have a right to expect that we will judge convicted criminals in this house by the same standards by which we judge others , &quot; Greene said . But the Senate Rules Committee put aside consideration of the expulsion motion after it received Hill ' s letter . Members were puzzled by Hill ' s failure to set a date for his departure and said they needed more time to clarify whether he would leave by Sept . 12 . Meanwhile , Gov . Pete Wilson , a fellow Republican , was asked by reporters whether he thinks the Senate should expel Hill . &quot; Yes , I do , &quot; he said . &quot; I have sympathy for a lot of people who are in_trouble . That doesn ' t mean I condone their actions. &quot; Under the law , elected statewide officials must resign when convicted of a serious crime . However , the requirement does not apply to legislators , who can be expelled only by a two-thirds vote of their colleagues . Hill , popular among many legislators , appeared to be gambling that supporters of expulsion could not muster enough votes , at least before Sept . 12 , legislative sources said privately . The last expulsion from the Senate occurred in 1905 and also involved a criminal scandal . It was clear from the debate on the Senate floor over Greene ' s proposal that the expulsion resolution will face stiff opposition in obtaining the needed 27 votes_in the 40-member chamber . Hill was the first Republican lawmaker tried as part of a lengthy federal political corruption investigation that surfaced nearly six years ago when the offices of Hill and three other lawmakers were searched by FBI_agents . Hill was videotaped accepting a $ 2 # 500 honorarium from an undercover FBI_agent posing as a businessman seeking a legislative favor in 1988 . The Rules Committee stripped Hill of his committee assignments but did not defuse the controversy over a convicted felon remaining in the Senate as a lawmaker . Hill voluntarily agreed not to vote on bills . Hill has secluded himself in his Capitol office and has continued to draw his $ 52 # 500-a-year salary and $ 101-a-day tax-free living allowance . Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer ( D-Hayward ) said he wants to get clarification from lawyers before deciding whether an expulsion proceeding should go_forward next week . Acknowledging that the lack of a quick resignation will anger the public , Lockyer said , &quot; It is hard to get people to understand that basic justice necessitates some fairness and due_process . And even politicians should be granted those basic rights. &quot; He described Hill as contrite and heartbroken over how the conviction is affecting his wife and three children . Lockyer said that Hill believes &quot; he is the victim of an out-of-control criminal justice system. &quot; In the morning , Hill walked through the Senate chamber , greeting colleagues and staff_members . &quot; I ' ll have an announcement by the end of the day , &quot; he said . A few minutes later , Greene introduced the measure demanding Hill ' s expulsion , triggering a spirited debate , including supporters of Hill who urged against hasty action . &quot; We have to ask ourselves . . . what if the conviction is reversed ? &quot; said Sen . Nicholas Petris ( D-Oakland ) . &quot; I don ' t believe it is necessary to rush to judgment. &quot; Senate GOP leader Ken Maddy of Fresno , who testified on Hill ' s behalf at the trial , said lawmakers regard Hill as a good friend . &quot; It is like a lot of tragedies that enter people ' s lives . . . I think he was more of a victim of circumstances and the venue than he is of committing a crime , &quot; Maddy told reporters . But fellow GOP Sen . William Craven of Oceanside , a member of the Rules Committee , introduced a measure requiring legislators to resign when convicted of a felony . &quot; I don ' t want to sound like an ogre , but we are not judging ( Hill ) on the basis of being a nice guy . The people don ' t understand a lot of the nuances about how legislators feel toward each other . They say , ' What ' s that got_to do with it ? If they are guilty , they are guilty. ' &quot; Some Democrats indicated privately that if Hill were to resign effective July 1 , Gov . Wilson could consolidate a special election to fill the seat with the Nov . 1 general_election . This would save local taxpayers the cost of a special election . Likely contenders in the GOP district include Republican Assemblymen Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar and Richard L . Mountjoy of Arcadia .</TEXT>
