   <HEADLINE> DANA PARSONS : GETTING BEHIND THE PADDLING IDEA , IF APPLIED EQUALLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s late Friday afternoon and the sun hasn ' t been out all week . I ' m feeling poopy . Could that be why Mickey Conroy ' s idea about paddling graffiti vandals doesn ' t sound like a bad one to me ? Conroy , the esteemed assemblyman from Orange , is_on to something , but even he shrinks in the face of a good idea . I ' ll do him the unsolicited favor of arguing his case for him and , even more graciously , attaching an amendment . Resolved , that the state sanction the paddling of convicted spray-painters . Uncivilized ? Let ' s not kid ourselves . My fellow Americans , we ' re a country that went kicking and screaming just to ban assault weapons for private use . We ' re a country overwhelmingly in favor of killing people for capital crimes , even if it takes 15 years to get_it done . We go_to_sleep at night as the state sends thousands of volts through people in the electric_chair . Surely , we can incorporate into that mind-set a_few whacks on the fanny . The only proviso should be that the person is physically sound enough to handle the paddling . If they ' re able , they can be caned . Most of us of a certain age can remember when public_school administrators were allowed to paddle our behinds . Catholic_school kids remember getting their knuckles rapped with Sister Elizabeth ' s ruler . If corporal_punishment in schools was leading us down the path to barbarism , then abolishing it should have played some role in making us less violent . Yeah , right . However , let me hasten to say I oppose corporal_punishment in the schools . For one thing , it would put too many school_principals in peril from avenging students who now pack guns . I doubt you ' d find too many principals who ' d want to risk getting shot over a paddling . Giving_out suspensions is risk free ; most of the violators probably welcome them . So , forget the schools . But what about the criminal justice system ? And for a crime as demoralizing to the larger society as graffiti vandalism ? Why blanch at that ? Vandals never expect to get caught in the first place , and many spray-painters are driven by their twisted sense of turf wars to mark their territory . Add_to that their near-certainty they won ' t pay a penalty for getting caught , and the rest of us are pretty much at their mercy . A city attorney in Orange County told me that most youngsters brought_up on graffiti violations today probably get probation . That sounds to me like they get one free crime . I ' ll give them a free crime if it ' s shoplifting bubble_gum from a candy_store . But defacing entire buildings or highway signs ? Sorry , Charlie ; bend over . So , we must inject some punishment into the equation . Vandals shouldn ' t be taking_up jail space . This isn ' t a crime that deserves incarceration ; however , because defacing property is particularly obnoxious and arrogant , we should fashion a punishment designed to cut the perpetrators down to size . Precisely where a public spanking fits_in . Graffiti , more_than most , is a crime against all_of us , because we ' re all forced to see the results of it . Just as the sunset soothes us , junk graffiti riles us . This is not a victimless_crime . We ' re all victims , and we should all have the chance to smirk at the little twerp who uglied up our town . The public - humiliation aspect is critical . The psyche of the vandals is that they ' re putting something over on the rest of us . A few quick pfft-pfft-pffts from the paint can and they ' ve defaced another bridge abutment . The cruelest punishment for someone like that is to be embarrassed in public . What better way to embarrass them than to de-pant them and redden their cheeks with a_few whacks ? They like color ; we ' ll give them some color . Public paddling may_not stop graffiti wars , but it would sure make the rest of us feel better when we did catch one of them . It would send a loud signal that the public isn ' t helpless and that , every so often , we ' ll get the last laugh . Now , for the much-needed amendment . If paddling is such a good idea , Mr. Conroy -- and it is -- why limit it to juvenile graffiti sprayers ? If your goal is to punish , to deter and to embarrass wrongdoers , why not do_it to adults too ? If a spanking would deter a 14-year-old , imagine what it might have done to some of your colleagues in the Legislature who have moved_on to houses of detention for various affronts against the public ? Off the top of my head , I can think_of a_few people in Orange County who have ripped_off citizens in ways that spray-painters couldn ' t dream of . Yes , the violators have gone_off to prison , but why not a_few sturdy lashes in the town square before they hit the road to Lompoc ? Believe me , Mr. Conroy , the public would love my amendment . So , yes , proceed with the paddling proposal , but don ' t limit yourself . Yes , we ' re sick and tired_of graffiti masters . But we ' re sick and tired_of lots of other people , too . Dana Parsons ' column appears Wednesday , Friday and Sunday .</TEXT>
