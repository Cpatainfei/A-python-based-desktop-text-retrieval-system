   <HEADLINE> OUTLOOK IS PESSIMISTIC AT AIDS CONCLAVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A sense of foreboding pervaded the gathering Sunday of more_than 11 # 000 scientists , journalists and AIDS activists and patients from 128 countries for the 10th International Conference on AIDS . Asia has so far escaped most of the ravages of the disease , but that situation is changing rapidly -- almost literally in front of the delegates ' eyes . During the last year alone , the number of cases in Southeast_Asia has increased more_than 700 % , from 30 # 000 to 250 # 000 . In northern Thailand , 8 % of pregnant women and 20 % of military recruits are infected with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , according to Dr. Michael H . Merson , head of the World_Health_Organization ' s Global Programme on AIDS . In Bombay , 30 % of prostitutes are HIV-positive , as are fully 50 % of intravenous drug_users in some regions of northeast India , he said . The World_Health_Organization expects the number of HIV-positive individuals in Asia , 2.5 million now , to quadruple to 10 million by the turn_of_the_century . Dr. Naoko Yamamoto , chief_executive of the conference , said it is important to &quot; bring the world ' s leading experts on AIDS to a region that is rapidly becoming the center of the global AIDS epidemic. &quot; Those experts are not bringing words of good cheer . Advances in treating AIDS are few and far between , and most experts expect few revelations in Yokohama . &quot; There will not be major breakthroughs ( announced ) here , &quot; said Dr. Peter Piot of the World_Health_Organization . At the first of these conferences , held nine years ago in Atlanta , researchers predicted the development of a vaccine by 1986 . On Saturday , in contrast , Dr. George Lundberg , editor of the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Assn. , predicted that &quot; no successful method of treatment or prevention will have been fully implemented &quot; at the end of the next century and that &quot; AIDS will still be a serious endemic disease throughout the world &quot; then . While other experts think that ' s an extreme expression of pessimism , the pace of research has been so slow that the conference sponsors are abandoning their yearly format in favor of holding the gatherings every_other year . The next meeting will be in Vancouver , Canada , in 1996 . Unlike the pace of research , the pace of disease is quickening . Worldwide , the estimated number of AIDS cases has gone_up 60 % in the last year , from 2.5 million in July , 1993 , to about 4 million today , according to the World_Health_Organization . The total number of HIV-infected individuals is 17 million . The pace of increase is somewhat slower in the United States , according to figures released Saturday by the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention . Through the end of June , CDC had received reports of 401 # 749 cases of individuals with AIDS , 243 # 423 of whom had died . In the last 18 months , 47 % of new cases were among gay_men , 28 % among intravenous drug_users and 9 % among heterosexuals who contracted it through sex . The proportions of cases among females , African Americans and Hispanics all increased slightly . Japan has a low incidence of AIDS so far , according to Dr. Simpei Ozaki of the Japan Ministry of Health and Welfare . Through the end of June , he said , the country had 764 cases of AIDS reported to the government and 3 # 075 HIV-positive individuals . Three out of every five of those cases were related to the use of contaminated blood in transfusions and blood products in hemophiliacs . Now that the problem of contaminated blood has been brought under_control by testing , Ozaki said , the biggest number of new infections has been among &quot; female foreign residents &quot; -- the euphemism for prostitutes from Thailand and other developing countries , most of whom contracted the virus in their home countries . Ozaki insisted that the number of new infections reported among such women dropped substantially last year . Japanese journalists , however , said the women simply stopped reporting new cases , both because they were getting_in trouble for their reports and because they were not receiving treatment from the national health system . Japanese AIDS patients have also complained recently about discrimination in a homophobic society , alleging that they have been turned_away from some hospitals . Ozaki conceded the charges , noting that &quot; current arrangements are not satisfactory. &quot; His ministry intends to establish &quot; model hospitals &quot; to demonstrate appropriate AIDS care in all_the country ' s 47 prefectures , or states , he said , but so far only eight are operating . That homophobia and fear of AIDS has so far apparently not proved to be a problem for the meeting , however . The government went_out of its way beforehand to make_it clear that AIDS patients and HIV-positive individuals were welcome to attend , and special classes in dealing with such people have been held for the staffs of Yokohama hotels . So far , the only complaints have been about the high cost of staying here . Delegates to the conference , which has been widely publicized here , were greeted Sunday with a lively opening ceremony that featured a laser show and computer_graphics on a large screen behind the speaker ' s podium . The kickoff event was attended by Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama and Crown_Prince Naruhito . Among those addressing the session was Toshihiro Oishi , one of the few Japanese to publicly admit being infected with HIV . Japan is &quot; a difficult society for us PWAs ( people with AIDS ) to live_in , &quot; he said . A nation with a budding AIDS problem is India . The world ' s second most populous country had only 768 reported AIDS cases through the end of June , according to Dr. Prasanta K . Choudhuri , president of the Indian Medical Assn . But he conceded that the number of cases is probably substantially underreported and that the incidence is growing at &quot; an alarming rate. &quot; He predicted that the country will have 5 million HIV-positive individuals and 1 million AIDS cases by the turn_of_the_century . One of the country ' s main problems , he said , is that the quality of condoms -- the best method for preventing spread of the virus during sex -- &quot; leaves much to be desired. &quot; The devices , he said , have a nasty habit of breaking . Foreign manufacturers are being brought_in to help local suppliers , he said.HUMAN IMM</TEXT>
