   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; AFTER HARDING STUMBLES , BAIUL , BONALY CONTEND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The woman who seven weeks ago screamed , &quot; Why me ? &quot; shouted to the world Wednesday night , &quot; Why not me ? ' To the question of who will win the women ' s figure_skating in the Winter_Olympics , resilient Nancy Kerrigan , mugged 49 days ago by a man with a blunt instrument and left bruised and crying , has picked herself up , dusted herself off and come_back good as new . Flawless on opening_night , Kerrigan left the arena in first place and laughing , while leaving America ' s other skater , Tonya Harding , in 10th place and gagging . Kerrigan ' s principal opposition in Friday ' s freestyle program for the gold medal will come from Oksana Baiul of Ukraine and Surya Bonaly of France -- not from Harding , who even with her acrobatic freestyling is too far behind . The civil_war between Nancy and Tonya ? That one ' s over . Coughing from asthma and sneezing from an allergic_reaction to flowers presented to her after her performance , Harding departed the Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre with virtually no chance of winning any medal -- gold , silver , bronze or good-conduct . Kerrigan , in contrast , could hardly have felt any better after the shower of flowers that descended toward her . With spectators clapping along in encouragement throughout her 2-minute 40-second technical program , and with an estimated 70 to 80 million Americans expected to view a delayed telecast of it back home , the willowy Kerrigan skated as carefree and naturally as though out on a frozen pond by herself . Even Harding applauded . Kerrigan ' s reaction : &quot; I ' m really proud_of myself. &quot; Both women actually competed with admirable composure considering the goldfish bowl that had become their world . Kerrigan , in particular , was in rare form , earning no score lower than 5.6 ( of a possible 6 ) from the panel of nine judges and even four 5.9s on her presentation . It was a performance worth waiting for , one Harding herself viewed from a private , glass-shielded box . Kerrigan skated nearly 2 1 / 2 hours later than Harding , who landed awkwardly enough on a double flip that she received no score higher than 5.6 -- with even a couple in the 4 ' s . Harding nonetheless pronounced herself satisfied , saying : &quot; It went good . I was ready . I went_out and did_it . I ' m happy with my performance. &quot; Nine other performances were superior to Harding ' s , however , including one by Germany ' s 28-year-old Katarina Witt , winner of two gold medals during the 1980s who was thought to be over the_hill . Witt returned strictly as a lark and placed sixth for the evening , in spite of being petrified beforehand . One would have thought that Kerrigan , 24 , of Stoneham , Mass. , had more reason to feel fearful , but she is leader of the pack with Friday ' s telltale freestyle program yet to come . The 1992 bronze medalist ' s principal opposition for a gold this time will be Baiul , 16 , and Bonaly , 20 , of France , each of whom is eminently capable of winning her country ' s first gold medal in this event . Baiul , dressed like a ballerina , skated to &quot; Swan Lake &quot; and occupied first place until Kerrigan came_on , next-to-last among the 27 skaters on the bill . Nervous ? Kerrigan said afterward : &quot; It would be weird if I wasn ' t a little nervous. &quot; From the first stride , though , her knees were steady and ice_water coarsed through her veins . To a tune called , &quot; Desperate Love , &quot; Kerrigan demonstrated the grace and almost double-jointed agility that had been her signature before the Jan . 6 assault that was meant to sabotage her career . Seven of the nine judges graded her in first place by the time she glided to a stop , and 5.9s for presentation were hers from judges representing Poland , China , Japan and the United States . Kerrigan ' s costume was cute and conservative -- black at the neck and shoulders with an apron of white . She looked_like a carhop . Harding came dressed like a Las Vegas cocktail waitress . No shrinking violet , right to the end , Harding wore an outfit that was scarlet and sleeveless , with a bright red bow in her hair and brighter red rouge on her cheeks . For the 23-year-old skater from Portland , Ore. , innocence is an appearance she is not wont_to convey , although Harding did begin her program with hands folded in prayer and concluded it with a curtsy . Apparently the only human being in Norway who still believes she has a chance , Harding , when asked at what point she would feel successful , said afterward : &quot; When I have a gold medal around my neck . that ' s when I ' ll feel_like I ' ve achieved what I came here for. &quot; While waiting for her scores , seated beside Diane Rawlinson , her coach , Harding was presented a bouquet of flowers . She promptly had a sneezing fit . &quot; She ' s allergic to flowers , &quot; Rawlinson said . Harding began to leave , to light applause from a mostly polite audience that had acknowledged her original introduction with a smattering of whistles and jeers . Then , adding illness to insult , Harding began crouping from an asthma_attack . She granted an interview only to a U.S. Olympic Committee official , and spoke as though she were in second place , not 10th . Never once did Harding give even the slightest hint of concession that her gold-medal chances were nil . Then she took a seat and did what everybody else did . She watched Nancy Kerrigan skate as though nothing had ever happened . * FIRST TEST : Nancy Kerrigan has chance for a gold medal while Tonya Harding is all but out . A1 .</TEXT>
