   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS ; ITALIANS SNEAK A VICTORY ; NORDIC SKIING : THE STRONG NORWEGIAN TEAM IS OVERCOME NEAR THE FINISH IN THE MEN ' S 40K CROSS-COUNTRY RELAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was obviously a setup for the Norwegians . They had the home-snow advantage , about 100 # 000 screaming compatriots backing their efforts , and as dreamy a Dream Team as any Nordic skiing buff could hope to see in Tuesday ' s 40-kilometer men ' s relay . Sture Sivertsen , who won the 10k classical race in the 1993 World Championships , led_off . Vegard Ulvang , winner of three gold medals two years ago in the Albertville Olympics , was up next . And skiing the freestyle legs were Thomas Alsgaard , winner of the 30k race a week ago , and Bjorn Daehlie , who won two of three races here and was second in the other . Surprise ! He finished second again , along with his Viking teammates . Finished second to Italy , a team that led_off with 43-year-old Maurilio de Zolt . In a race that had Europeans saying to North_Americans , &quot; that ' s what we like about cross-country ski racing , &quot; Italian anchor skier Silvio Fauner edged Daehlie by less than half a second . Before a suddenly silent crowd -- slalom star Alberto Tomba was one of the few yelling for his Italian teammates -- Fauner , somewhat reluctantly , passed Daehlie in the hairpin turn leading to the stretch run , then outkicked a hard-charging Daehlie at the finish , winning by about a yard . &quot; For three years , they have been the strongest in the world , &quot; said Marco Albarello , who skied Italy ' s second leg . &quot; The biggest satisfaction was to come_into the stadium and hear that the crowd was silent . We were able to shut them up. &quot; Daehlie said : &quot; I think we disappointed 4 million Norwegians today . Maybe some of them broke their TVs . But we made_good entertainment . It was good promotion for cross-country_skiing , I think. &quot; That it was . For nearly two hours -- Italy won in 1 hour 41 minutes 15 seconds -- the Norwegian and Italian skiers raced as if they were_on a tandem bike , Finns joining them for three-quarters of the way . On the last leg , though , Finnish anchorman Jari Isometsae was unable to keep_up with Fauner and Daehlie , and they had the race to themselves , every grueling stride of it . First Daehlie would pull_away on the uphill portions , then Fauner would catch him on the flat . When he couldn ' t build a lead of any consequence , Daehlie changed the pace , slowing , trying to entice Fauner into a premature sprint . If Daehlie wasn ' t skiing on Fauner ' s tails , Fauner was skiing on Daehlie ' s . When Fauner took the lead for good , it was at Daehlie ' s invitation . The skiers exchanged looks_at the top of the hairpin , then Fauner moved slightly ahead . &quot; Bjorn had tried to open a gap on me but I stayed right behind him , and then he wanted me to go_into the lead ( and set the pace for the finish ) , &quot; Fauner said . &quot; I was tired . He wanted me to go_by but I didn ' t want to. &quot; Daehlie said : &quot; I wanted to go as No . 2 to the finish area . I knew Fauner is a little bit faster so I wanted to go behind ( conserving strength ) , then go quite fast when there were 100 or 50 meters left and beat him at the finish_line . ( In that situation , ) it ' s a little easier to go behind. &quot; As they entered the stadium for the final kick , they were matching strides , as usual , in tandem , Fauner ahead . Then Daehlie jumped over to the left side of the track and kicked . He got almost even with Fauner , then the Italian found his own kick and got home first . Daehlie had nothing but praise for the Italian team , notably de Zolt . &quot; In the 1992 Olympics , I thought , ' He ' s old enough to be my father. ' I don ' t think I ' ll ski as fast as that when I ' m 43. &quot; Each skier went 10k , the first two legs in the classical manner , the last two in freestyle . And de Zolt ' s opening leg was as surprising as it was impressive . Sivertsen was first out and led much of the way but couldn ' t shake Mika Myllylae of Finland or de Zolt . After the first 10k , Sivertsen and Myllylae were even , but de Zolt was only a stride behind . &quot; For me , the day was very hard , &quot; de Zolt said . &quot; If I ran well , the others would be able to run well . If I ran badly , it would have been very difficult for others to catch_up so I tried to run as fast as possible . I never got ( an Olympic ) medal and I thought this might be my last opportunity. &quot; Albarello kept pace with Ulvang on the second leg , then Giorgio Vanzetta skied against Alsgaard on the third , Finns Harri Kirvesniemi and Jari Raesaenen making_it a three-nation race . Isometsae dropped_off early in the last leg -- Finland got the bronze -- and it came_down to Fauner and Daehlie . &quot; I was lucky enough to take gold in the earlier races , &quot; Daehlie said . &quot; I have no excuses . It was just nice to have so many people there. &quot; Quiet people , as it turned_out .</TEXT>
