   <HEADLINE> KOREAN NUCLEAR INSPECTIONS : ELEMENTS OF CRISIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> North_Korea has vaulted onto front pages as Pyongyang and Washington argue about a difficult issue -- nuclear proliferation . In brief , does the North have nuclear_weapons or doesn ' t it ? And if it has , what dangers does that pose to South_Korea , the region and the world ? Here are the key elements in this controversy : Question : Why are the United States and North_Korea at_odds ? Answer : The United States suspects that North_Korea has acquired nuclear_weapons . But Pyongyang won ' t allow international inspectors to test its reactor and other nuclear plants so they can tell for_sure . Under the international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , Pyongyang is obliged to allow inspectors to do their work . It hasn ' t . Q . Does North_Korea actually have nuclear_weapons now ? A . No one really knows . The CIA believes that Pyongyang probably has processed enough plutonium to manufacture at least one nuclear bomb and may well have one or two more such weapons in its arsenal . North_Korea denies having any nuclear_weapons and has not tested any . Q . Why should anyone care whether Pyongyang has a nuclear arsenal ? A . Two reasons : First , North_Korea would be able to use its nuclear_weapons to threaten South_Korea , Taiwan and Japan -- intensifying pressures in the entire region . Second , Pyongyang could also sell nuclear bombs to other countries , such_as Iraq , Iran , Libya and Syria -- as it has in the case of missiles and other weapons . And if North_Korea had a bomb , South_Korea , Taiwan and Japan would probably push to acquire their own nuclear_weapons . Q . What is the International Atomic Energy Agency and why does_it have any business in North_Korea ? A . The IAEA is a U.N.-related organization set_up to serve as a clearinghouse and inspection agency to help administer the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . Based in Vienna , it has a staff of about 100 bureaucrats and nuclear scientists to help carry_out this task . Q . What are nuclear fuel rods and why are they so important ? A . Fuel for a nuclear_reactor is shaped into thousands of rods , which are inserted into the reactor ' s core . In North_Korea ' s case , the fuel is unenriched uranium -- a cheap material from its own mines . The problem is that it is easy to turn unenriched uranium into weapons-grade plutonium-239 -- the material needed for nuclear_weapons . This is done_by removing used fuel rods from a reactor and extracting the plutonium during reprocessing . The reactor core at Yongbyon holds seven to 10 tons of fuel -- enough to provide plutonium for four or five nuclear bombs . Q . How can IAEA inspectors use the used fuel rods to determine whether a country such_as North_Korea is diverting its spent fuel to make nuclear bombs ? A . They analyze the fuel to see how much radioactive waste and contamination they contain , which tells them how old the fuel is and , therefore , how recently the North_Koreans replaced their spent fuel . That , in turn , can help them tell whether fuel has been reprocessed . Q . What brought_on the current crisis ? A . North_Korea decided abruptly two weeks ago to shut_down its reactor and begin removing fuel rods -- leaving IAEA inspectors high and dry . IAEA officials believed that they had a_few more months to negotiate over inspection rights . The shutdown meant they had to act quickly or they would lose the chance to analyze the spent rods completely and tell for_sure whether Pyongyang has been making nuclear_weapons . IAEA inspectors visited the Yongbyon reactor , but were denied access to the materials and records they needed . To compound the problem , the North_Koreans removed the spent fuel rods so rapidly that the IAEA inspectors were unable to complete their work in time . As a result , while the IAEA has confirmed that North_Korea is not diverting spent fuel now for use in nuclear_weapons , it could not tell whether the Koreans did so in 1989 -- the last time the reactor was shut_down . That was the key point in determining whether Pyongyang actually has nuclear_weapons . Since the United States had warned repeatedly that that would be the crunch-point in its dealings with North_Korea , the Administration has begun a push to get the U.N. Security_Council to impose punitive economic sanctions against Pyongyang . Q . How likely is it that the Administration will succeed in persuading the Security_Council to impose sanctions ? A . It ' s unclear . Although the Western allies generally agree that it is time to crack_down on North_Korea , China and Russia -- two of five permanent members of the Security_Council that have power to veto a sanctions resolution -- say they still are not ready to support sanctions . The Administration is trying to work_out a compromise . But it may have to settle for gradual imposition of sanctions . Washington also faces resistance from South_Korea and Japan , both of which fear that imposing sanctions on North_Korea might spur Pyongyang into military_action . Q . What impact would imposing sanctions have ? A . Proponents say that imposing sanctions would squeeze North_Korea economically and might force the regime of longtime leader Kim Il Sung to halt its nuclear program . The North_Korean economy already is in dire straits . Food is at a premium . And fuel supplies are short . Others -- mainly the Russians and Chinese -- argue that tightening the noose now will only make the regime more desperate and force it to become even more recalcitrant . There also is some question -- even among Western economists -- about how effective sanctions would be . Q . Would the United States be ready to intervene militarily if the situation got_worse ? And who would be the winner of such a conflict ? A . Presumably it would . The Clinton_Administration has pledged to protect South_Korea . The United States has 37 # 000 troops in the country . But the United States would only act in defense -- that is , North_Korea would have to be preparing to launch an attack . The United States and South_Korea have the firepower and troops ultimately to win a war with the North . But the allies would suffer heavy casualties . And North_Korea is capable of doing extensive damage to Seoul , which is only a_few miles from the border .</TEXT>
