   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF TO SURVEY EARTH SITES WITH RADAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Space shuttle Endeavour ' s astronauts rocketed into orbit and switched_on a powerful radar instrument Friday to help scientists save vanishing animal species and look_for lost civilizations under the desert sands . The crew of six lifted_off at sunrise on a mission that was delayed 1 1 / 2 months because of a last-second engine shutdown on the launch_pad . NASA plans to survey nearly 600 sites with the $ 366-million radar , including the Silk_Road traveled_by Marco Polo 700 years ago and the area in Rwanda where Dian Fossey worked to save Africa ' s imperiled mountain_gorillas . Other targets during the 10-day flight include the habitat of endangered pandas in China , stagnant pools in countries with malaria outbreaks , sand-covered archeological sites in Israel , Egypt and Oman , and the radiation-contaminated land around the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine . The radar will also track an oil spill in the North_Sea . German oceanographers plan to dump more_than 100 gallons of diesel_oil off Denmark on Wednesday to see if the radar can identify the mess . They promise to clean_up everything within two hours . The radar is flying in space for the second time in six months . There were some bugs after the launch -- the kind that buzz . Minutes after blastoff , shuttle commander Michael Baker noticed streaks on two cockpit windows and what appeared to be big , squashed bugs on the outside . He then discovered a stowaway . &quot; I want to let you know we had an extra passenger . One of those nice Florida mosquitoes is_on board , &quot; Baker said . Also , the shuttle holds 500 # 000 postage_stamps ; the $ 9.95 Express_Mail stamps commemorate the 25th anniversary of the first manned moon landing and will be sold after the flight . The U.S. Postal Service paid the National Aeronautics and Space Administration $ 50 # 000 to fly the stamps and expects to earn up_to $ 12.5 million by selling them to collectors after the shuttle ' s 10-day mission ends . It ' s not the first time stamps have flown in space . The postal_service orbited another Express_Mail stamp in 1983 , which became popular among collectors .</TEXT>
