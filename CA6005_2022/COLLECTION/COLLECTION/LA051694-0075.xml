   <HEADLINE> DRUG FIRM ' S BURST BUBBLE STUNS INVESTORS ; PHARMACEUTICALS : THE FAILURE OF SCICLONE ' S TRIAL OF A HEPATITIS MEDICINE SHOWS THE RISKS INHERENT IN BIOTECHNOLOGY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Without a product to market or its first dollar in sales , the small Silicon_Valley biotechnology company counted_on the allure of a promising experimental drug to entice investors . It was not disappointed . Buoyed by predictions of a drug with billion-dollar sales potential , investors drove_up the company ' s stock_market value to among the highest in biotech . Then the bubble burst for SciClone Pharmaceuticals . In late April , the San Mateo biotechnology firm stunned investors by announcing that a potential therapy to treat chronic hepatitis_B appeared to have flopped in an important scientific trial . Study results showed the drug , thymosin alpha 1 , was no more effective than plain water . SciClone ' s shares , which had peaked at $ 27 in November , plunged 60 % in a single day . The stock dipped below $ 5 , a value that pegged the company ' s worth at no more_than the cash on its balance_sheet . The shares have rallied some since then , closing Friday at $ 7.625 , up 37.5 cents in Nasdaq trading . SciClone ' s problems come at a bad time for the industry . Capital-hungry biotech firms already face a financing crisis that has some experts predicting a major shakeout as weaker companies begin to run_out of cash . Analysts cite the weak stock_market , health_care reform and the growth of managed-care companies as reasons for the money shortage . Another factor_in the financing chill is the fact that many investors have soured on biotech after watching a series of drugs that looked great in the laboratory flop in human clinical trials . SciClone ' s situation has made Wall_Street even more jittery , said Dr. Charles B . Engelberg , an analyst for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco who has been bullish on the San Mateo firm . &quot; People are saying they ' re not going_to place their bets early in the biotech game , &quot; he said , explaining that investors may_not put money into a company until a drug has passed several testing hurdles . &quot; They will invest later and later based on this disappointment. &quot; &quot; A lot of institutions ponied up a lot of money for SciClone shares , &quot; said Evan Sturza , editor of New York-based Sturza ' s Medical Investment_Letter , who is skeptical of SciClone ' s prospects . &quot; This is an incident that will leave a very bad taste in investors ' mouths. &quot; Until recently , SciClone had the appearance of a winner . The company , founded in 1989 , adopted a business strategy that is unique in the industry . Unlike most biotech firms , it employs no research scientists and has no expensive laboratories or technical equipment . Instead , SciClone ' s plan is to buy the rights to promising &quot; late stage &quot; drugs that have faltered at other companies , continue their development and bring them to market . Instead of spending hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a drug from scratch , the company can focus its resources on drugs with some record of safety and effectiveness . SciClone acquired the rights to thymosin in 1990 . The drug -- originally developed by Hoffman-La Roche Inc. -- has been lauded as a potential cure for chronic hepatitis_B , a disease that has 300 million carriers worldwide , most of them in China , India , Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia and Latin_America . About 350 # 000 of those people are believed to have the type of chronic disease for which thymosin is designed . The drug , a synthetic hormone , is expected to be cheaper to manufacture and have fewer side_effects than Schering-Plough Corp. ' s alpha interferon , the only U.S.-approved drug for chronic hepatitis_B . In earlier , smaller clinical studies in the United States , the drug proved more effective against hepatitis_B than did alpha interferon . The drug has been approved for use in Singapore for hepatitis_B . Bullish analysts have estimated that the worldwide market for the drug could be worth several billion dollars . SciClone ' s partner in thymosin ' s development , Bethesda , Md.-based Alpha 1 Biomedical Inc. , was also battered by news of the recent clinical findings . Alpha manufactures the drug and has marketing rights in the United States and Europe . SciClone owns the marketing rights in Asia , potentially the drug ' s biggest market . SciClone and Alpha have been locked_in a yearlong legal fight over marketing and manufacturing of the drug . Last week , the companies said they are discussing a deal in which Alpha would relinquish full worldwide marketing rights to the drug in exchange for SciClone shares . SciClone officials and analysts say they are puzzled_over the negative data in the recently completed study of 99 patients at test sites in Los Angeles , Miami and Detroit . They note that the results show an extraordinarily high &quot; remission &quot; rate among patients who took a placebo -- or patients who got better without taking thymosin . &quot; We feel this is a situation where we have a trial with incomplete and inconsistent results , &quot; SciClone Chairman Thomas Moore said . &quot; Now we ' re in a position of having to explain why this trial has an aberrant data set. &quot; Moore said SciClone and Alpha , which oversaw the clinical study , are still trying to analyze the data . Alpha officials had discussed the results with SciClone &quot; in very sketchy fashion &quot; the day before the data was released publicly , he said . The rocky relations between SciClone and Alpha led some observers to question whether results from the recent clinical tests may have been deliberately tampered with -- a charge both companies strongly deny . Some analysts say the recent tests signal that the drug is unlikely to work . Sturza says the prospects for thymosin have been overblown by SciClone officials and bullish analysts who have referred to it as a &quot; billion-dollar drug. &quot; He contends that much of the interest in the company came_on the basis of a small preliminary test . But Montgomery Securities ' Engelberg continues to rate SciClone a &quot; speculative buy. &quot; He predicts the stock could earn $ 4 a share within two years of the drug ' s launch . That would put a value on SciClone stock of more_than $ 100 a share . &quot; Given all_the published data taken_on balance , we believe that the evidence still supports the efficacy of ( thymosin ) in the treatment of hepatitis_B , &quot; said Engelberg , a doctor of internal_medicine . He said the next crucial test for the drug is a 150-patient clinical study taking_place in Taiwan , but those results probably won ' t be known until later this year . Montgomery , which has taken a lot of heat from angry investors for its support of SciClone , was a co-underwriter with Smith Barney Shearson of SciClone ' s secondary stock offering in January . SciClone sold 2 million shares at $ 23.25 each , raising $ 46.5 million . Moore says the negative results have forced the company to take &quot; an enormous amount of corporate energy &quot; explaining to investors and others what went_wrong . He says the company , which has $ 80 million in cash set_aside , still believes the drug works . And others say Wall_Street ' s punishing reaction to the results show once again that investors still don ' t understand the high risks of biotechnology . &quot; This is an important trial and it ' s a negative that the drug didn ' t do_well , &quot; said Kenneth Lee , Ernst &amp; Young ' s director of life sciences industry services . &quot; But that is not an ironclad conclusion about the power of a drug candidate . &quot; Looking_at a drug at any point of time as the final story is also risky , &quot; he said . Falling Prices SciClone Pharmaceuticals ' stock price took a beating last month when the company disclosed disappointmenting results of an experimental drug to fight chronic hepatitis_B . Monthly closes , except latest : Friday : $ 7.625 , up 37.5 cents . Source : Dow Jones</TEXT>
