   <HEADLINE> GOLF / STEVE ELLING ; CITING SELF-PRESERVATION , GORE ESCAPES WILDCAT TRAP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Make a list of golfers who seem most likely to become the white-knuckle , ulcer-plagued , teeth-gnashing type and Jason Gore of Valencia would rank dead last . Gore won friends easily , always had a wisecrack , a one-liner , a quip . He was magnetic , laughed and joked his way through rounds and seemed oblivious to pressure . It ' s all_in past_tense , because Gore couldn ' t get past being tense . Sometime , over the past couple of years , everything changed , and the results are unpleasant . &quot; It ' s not much fun when you ' re throwing_up blood , &quot; Gore said . &quot; Golf was like a job , a chore. &quot; In what qualified as an absolute shocker in the University of Arizona ' s athletic department , Gore announced this month that he would not return for his junior year . &quot; This is a big loss for me , &quot; Arizona Coach Rick LaRose said . &quot; It definitely affects me personally. &quot; Gore , who was named an honorable_mention NCAA Division I All-American after winning his second consecutive individual Pacific 10 Conference championship last spring , said the decision was borne of self-preservation . He didn ' t like what the game and the Wildcat program had done to him , he said . He was wrapped tighter than a 100-compression ball and was starting to unravel . Over the past few months , he experienced violent episodes of nausea before and during major tournaments . This summer , Gore underwent a_battery of tests , none of which pinpointed the cause of his stomach ailment . At first , Gore thought he had ulcers . Doctors said he might have contracted a stomach virus . He ' s been poked , prodded and probed . &quot; Everywhere , everything , &quot; said Gore , a former Hart High standout . &quot; Every square inch. &quot; Then again , it could be psychosomatic . &quot; Whenever I got real worked_up , I threw_up blood , &quot; Gore said . &quot; It just knocked me out . I had trouble functioning . &quot; I ' ve always been easygoing . I found I was ( angry ) all_the time . Finally , the smile ' s returning to my face. &quot; The same cannot be said of LaRose , who is wondering what went amiss with his star pupil . LaRose said that Gore , with two Pac-10 titles in as_many tries , had a chance of being inducted into the school ' s hall_of_fame . Gore could have been &quot; a great pro someday , and still might , &quot; he said . LaRose , in fact , is reeling . &quot; I treated him like my son and I did a lot of things for him , &quot; LaRose said . &quot; Getting him on that All-American team was not easy . It took a lot of work . I talked to him in June , July , August , and he said he was coming_back . &quot; It shows that you never know what kids are thinking. &quot; Gore has enrolled for the fall semester at College of the Canyons . Eventually , he might transfer to another four-year school , but is still considering his options . However it turns_out , Gore said , he hasn ' t been_sick since he informed LaRose of his decision . &quot; You know , sometimes , the guys who are happiest on the outside are dog-paddling like crazy under the surface , &quot; LaRose said . &quot; Like a duck , underneath , they ' re paddling like mad. &quot; Gore said nothing in particular about the Arizona program prompted him to withdraw . Perhaps expectations were too great -- Gore was_on full scholarship , a rarity in men ' s golf . Maybe Arizona expected the big-hitting , 6-foot , 210-pounder to be a Terminator in cleats and wraparound sunglasses . Coaches perceived him as &quot; soft. &quot; &quot; They wanted me to be intimidating , &quot; Gore said . &quot; Maybe at my size , I should be . But that ' s not really the way I am. &quot; It should be emphasized that Gore didn ' t exactly wilt under pressure at Arizona . He won both Pac-10 championships in sudden_death , including a playoff victory over All-American Todd Demsey of Arizona State as an 18-year-old freshman . Gore triple-bogeyed the 72nd hole to blow a three-shot lead in the 1994 Pac-10 final , then somehow came_back to win the playoff . &quot; He was_sick all week in the Pac-10s and still played real well , &quot; LaRose said . It ' s mystifying , LaRose said . &quot; Golf can be a stressful situation , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s easy to be happy-go-lucky when you ' re beating everybody . &quot; But when people are nipping at your heels , it ' s a little different and people react in their own way , I guess. &quot; * Heavy medal : Todd Golditch of Northridge swiped some of his brother ' s thunder . Golditch , who will be a sophomore at Chatsworth High , won the individual gold medal in the 13-14 division last week at the Maccabiah Games in Cleveland . Golditch , 14 , finished with a 36-hole total of 164 . At the 1992 games in Baltimore , brother Scott , a standout at Taft over the past two seasons , won the gold in the 15-16 division . Scott will play_at Cal in the fall . The family is originally from Philadelphia , but brotherly_love only goes so far . Asked when he expects to begin drubbing his brother , Todd said : &quot; Pretty soon. &quot; * On deck : On the heels of the Women ' s U.S. Mid-Amateur qualifier last week at El Caballero Country_Club in Tarzana comes the male version in Ventura County . Two-year-old Spanish Hills Country_Club in Camarillo , the area ' s newest layout , will be the site of a men ' s Mid-Amateur qualifier on Tuesday . The Women ' s Mid-Amateur begins Sept . 10 in Tacoma , Wash. , while the men ' s event starts Sept . 17 in Minneapolis .</TEXT>
