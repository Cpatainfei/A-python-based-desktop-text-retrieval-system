   <HEADLINE> EXXON VALDEZ STAYS AS SYMBOL OF TANKER RISKS ; ITS NAME HAS CHANGED BUT IT STILL CARRIES OIL IN A FRAGILE SINGLE HULL . LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE , CRITICS SAY , TO IMPLEMENT LANDMARK 1990 PROTECTION LAW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When a 987-foot tanker once known as the Exxon Valdez slipped into a harbor in the Bahamas a month ago , it was sporting a rebuilt hull , a new coat_of_paint and a new name -- the SeaRiver Mediterranean . Much about the ship had changed since it struck Bligh Reef five years ago and spilled 11 million gallons of crude_oil into Alaska ' s Prince William Sound . But to the Greenpeace activists who met the ship with noisy protest in the Bahamas , little was different . It was the same old single-hulled ship carrying the same old cargo of oil , bearing the same old risks of environmental disaster . Five years after the nation ' s worst oil spill , environmental and maritime experts said the repainted Exxon tanker is emblematic of U.S. policy toward oil spills : In some ways , much has changed . And in some ways , little is different . What has changed , primarily , are state and federal laws governing the design and operations of all ships operating in U.S. waters . The most significant law , the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , was passed a year after the Exxon spill to create a sea change in oil-spill prevention and response . The Coast Guard is carrying_out the Oil Pollution Act and contends that the changes are_well under way . But critics in the environmental community accuse the Coast Guard and its masters at the Transportation Department of foot-dragging and charge that the changes called_for by law are stalled . The Oil Pollution Act called_for significant new capabilities in fighting spills at ports around the United States . It required that ports and ship owners operating in U.S. waters put_together plans for responding to spills . It stiffened liability laws , increasing eight-fold the costs for which the owner of a tanker could be held liable and , in some cases , providing_for unlimited liability . It established a 5-cents-a-barrel tax on crude_oil to build a $ 1-billion cleanup trust_fund . And it set_forth a timetable , running from 1995 to 2015 , for requiring new , safer double hulls on large new cargo carriers operating in U.S. waters . So far , the Coast Guard has created three new oil pollution strike teams and a National Strike Force Coordination Center in Elizabeth City , N.J. The Coast Guard has identified 19 ports where oil-spill equipment should be based and has virtually finished putting that equipment in place . In a spill of diesel_fuel off Puerto Rico in January , several of those sites provided the necessary equipment . The provisions of the 1990 law that increase potential liability also appear to have brought improvements in tanker safety . Ship owners and operators facing the prospect of greater liability concede they have paid more attention to the conditions of their equipment and the safety of their operations . &quot; I think it ' s fair to say the liability was another piece to crystallize our thoughts , &quot; about spill prevention , said Art Stephen , external affairs adviser for SeaRiver Maritime Inc. , a wholly owned affiliate of Exxon Corp . and owner of the Exxon Valdez . Experts on all sides of the debate agree . And because little oil is ever recovered from spills , even in the most favorable circumstances , prevention is a critical element of efforts to reduce the environmental impact of oil transportation . Finally , the Exxon Valdez disaster had a powerful impact on coastal communities potentially affected by tanker traffic , galvanizing citizen watchdog groups . In the communities fouled by the Exxon Valdez , the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council -- with a full-time staff paid with funds furnished by Exxon and other oil_companies -- has become a powerful , independent voice in ensuring safe operations . Still , much today remains the same since the Exxon Valdez lurched onto Bligh Reef on March 24 , 1989 . Today , 95 % of the vessels hauling oil in U.S. waters have a single hull , which can be easily breached in a grounding or collision . And a required plan to increase the safety of operating those ships , at least two years overdue already , is not expected to be complete for another year . Earlier this year , the Coast Guard unveiled a plan to make single-hulled ships safer , but it was quickly withdrawn after an engineering firm determined that the plan actually could worsen a spill . &quot; We ' ve been very concerned about the Coast Guard ' s lack of competence and diligence in doing this , &quot; said Sarah Chasis , a senior attorney at the Natural_Resources Defense Council in New York . Watchdogs like NRDC also worry that four years after the passage of the Oil Pollution Act , the Coast Guard has yet to identify environmentally sensitive shipping routes that should be free_of oil_tankers , as the law required .</TEXT>
