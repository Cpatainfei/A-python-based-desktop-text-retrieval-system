   <HEADLINE> ZHIRINOVSKY CALLS CLINTON A ' COWARD '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky on Thursday called President Clinton a &quot; coward &quot; and a &quot; soft man &quot; who should stay home and play the saxophone if he is afraid to meet with the top vote-getter in Russia ' s recent elections . &quot; All of you in the West have become rotten and moldy , &quot; the extremist leader said . &quot; That is why you are afraid that a new honest and brave man has emerged in Russia . You want us to be weak and to rot together with you . . . . Rot without us ! &quot; With his mixture of bonhomie and venom , Zhirinovsky said he is ready to sit_down for peaceful and friendly meetings with Clinton , as well as with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand -- but that they are all afraid of him . Clinton , who will arrive in Moscow on Wednesday , has said that he is prepared to meet with a wide range of Russian leaders -- except Zhirinovsky , whose racist , anti-Semitic and bellicose statements have prompted comparisons with Hitler and Mussolini . &quot; I want to tell him that we should have good , normal relations and he should not be afraid to meet me , &quot; Zhirinovsky said . &quot; He should not show that he is such a coward . He should meet me personally , and I will tell him everything . &quot; There is only one party in this country , tell him that , &quot; Zhirinovsky said of his misleadingly named Liberal Democratic Party . &quot; Some President of the United States of America he is ! Let him play his saxophone back home instead of coming here to meet with nobodies ! &quot; * Immediately after his election , a jubilant Zhirinovsky had said that he would be delighted to meet Clinton and invited the American President to join him for a Russian sauna . Zhirinovsky also said in English that his wife would like to meet &quot; Madam Hillary. &quot; Zhirinovsky headed the national Liberal Democratic Party ticket that placed first in the December parliamentary elections with 23 % of the vote . He was elected to the Duma , or lower house of Parliament , from the city of Shchelkovo , about 18 miles northeast of Moscow . After election officials there handed him his lawmaker ' s identity_card Thursday , he boasted , &quot; The next ID card I get will be as president of Russia. &quot; Indulging his penchant for colorful language , dark humor and bald threats , Zhirinovsky announced that he &quot; did not give_a_damn &quot; about the Poles now that they have forced Russian troops to leave , and said Russians would not lift a finger to help the Poles if Germany tried to take_back Eastern Prussia , now part of Poland . He also called former Soviet leader Mikhail S . Gorbachev a &quot; scoundrel. &quot; &quot; Even Gorbachev has gone crazy and is saying I am a creature of the KGB , &quot; Zhirinovsky said . &quot; He is a scoundrel . He ruined the Soviet_Union and is now tortured by remorse. &quot; At one point , Zhirinovsky delivered a diatribe to a Japanese television_reporter , advocating a naval_blockade of Japan if it refuses to sign a peace_treaty with Russia . &quot; You want to fight with us ? Let ' s fight , &quot; Zhirinovsky said , leaning into the television_cameras . &quot; Tomorrow the Pacific fleet will blockade the Japanese islands and you will starve to death. &quot; Japan and Russia never signed a peace_treaty after World_War_II because of their conflicting claims to the southern Kurils , a group of islands northeast of Japan that have become a symbol for nationalists in both counties . &quot; You want the islands ? I can tell you you ' re never going_to get them , &quot; Zhirinovsky said . &quot; Nobody will get a meter of Russian territory. &quot; * He also lectured a German reporter : &quot; You should have no illusions that after you have ruined Russia you will be getting raw_materials at rock-bottom prices . You are not going_to get anything from us. &quot; Germany should pay World_War_II reparations to Russia instead of compensating Jews for the Holocaust , Zhirinovsky added , repeating inflammatory remarks he made in a German television interview earlier this week . &quot; Why are you paying Israel and saving Jews ? &quot; he asked the German reporter . &quot; You ' re paying every Jew , and how many Russians died ? Twenty-six million . You don ' t give_a_damn . &quot; It was we who destroyed fascism , &quot; Zhirinovsky added . &quot; If it wasn ' t for us , there would n ' t be a single Jew. &quot; During a disastrous European tour last month , Zhirinovsky was expelled from Bulgaria , denied a visa to Germany and told he would be persona_non_grata in France .</TEXT>
