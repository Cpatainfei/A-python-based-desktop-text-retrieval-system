   <HEADLINE> BUDGET OFFICE SEES HEALTH PLAN WIDENING DEFICIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a major setback for the Clinton_Administration ' s health_care initiative , the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday that the reform plan would create a massive new government program that ultimately would prove more costly than Social_Security and would widen the federal_deficit by $ 74 billion during its first six years . In its long-awaited report , the nonpartisan budget agency said the mandatory insurance_premiums that employers would be required to pay under the Clinton plan should be considered government &quot; receipts &quot; and included in the federal budget . Characterizing the payments as receipts is a less politically charged definition than using the term &quot; tax , &quot; but the budget office suggested that the mandatory premiums would have essentially the same effect as new payroll taxes on American workers . Under the Clinton plan -- which the President has asked Congress to approve this year -- most employers would be required to pay at least 80 % of the cost of providing insurance for their workers , with employees picking_up the remainder . The government would subsidize premium costs for some small businesses and low-income workers . The CBO , which provides official budgetary rulings for Congress , said that the Clinton health plan should be regarded_as a huge new federal entitlement program . The premium payments and government subsidies would rise to an estimated $ 513 billion annually by the year 2004 , nearly 20 % more_than projected Social_Security outlays in that year , the agency said . Dealing another blow to the Administration ' s reform campaign , which has sought to portray the President ' s initiative as a private-sector solution to the health crisis , the CBO said that the network of health alliances it would establish should be considered government entities . As envisioned by the Administration , the alliances would act_as insurance buying cooperatives for consumers and employers . The quasi-public entities would collect the mandatory premiums from employers and their workers , and then use the funds to buy insurance from a handful of large private insurers on their behalf . The CBO report is politically damaging because it directly challenges many of the basic_assumptions on which the White_House health_care plan is founded . The Administration has argued that its &quot; managed competition &quot; plan represents a sophisticated public-private partnership designed to harness the power of the marketplace to extend coverage to all Americans , while reining_in runaway health_care costs . Administration officials have taken pains to design the plan so that it would not be characterized as a significant expansion of the federal_government ' s role in an industry that accounts_for 14 % of the nation ' s economy . By defining the proposed system as a new entitlement in the tradition of Social_Security and Medicare , the CBO has made_it much easier for opponents to portray the Clinton plan as a form of socialized medicine . In rendering its bombshell ruling , the CBO resisted intense pressure from White_House officials , including the President and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . The Clintons argued that the insurance_premiums , and most of the plan ' s costs and expenditures , should be left_out of the federal budget . By determining that the President ' s reform effort would create a new government program , the CBO report also will impose much tougher budgetary and cost discipline on the White_House program . CBO Director Robert D . Reischauer told the House Ways and Means Committee Tuesday that including the health plan in the federal budget would make_it far more difficult for the government to use &quot; accounting chicanery &quot; to hide its true costs . The CBO ' s verdict that the plan would increase the federal_deficit is another blow to the Administration . The White_House has stressed repeatedly that its health reform campaign offers the only path to deficit reduction , because it will restrain the exploding costs of the government ' s existing health_care programs -- Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor . The Administration has estimated that its plan would reduce the deficit by $ 58 billion between the years 1995 and 2000 . But the CBO disagreed . Although the agency concurred that some form of health_care reform is needed to curb the deficit , its report found that the Clinton plan would actually increase the shortfall by $ 74 billion for the remainder of this decade . The figure would increase to $ 126 billion by the year 2004 . The budget office said that the Clinton plan would not result in significant deficit reduction until well after the turn_of_the_century . In another troubling observation , the report agreed with private studies that say the Administration has underestimated by at least 15 % the costs of providing health_care to all Americans . While the White_House has said that insurance_premiums would cost about $ 4 # 200 a year for an average family of four under its proposal , the CBO projected a cost of $ 5 # 565 for an average two-parent family . Testifying at a packed committee hearing , Reischauer said that the costs are understated largely because the White_House failed to anticipate many of the consequences of providing universal coverage and subsidizing firms and workers who can ' t afford to pay the premiums . The CBO estimated that the subsidies for employers would cost $ 58 billion annually by the year 2000 , or $ 25 billion more_than the Administration ' s forecasts . Reischauer said the CBO estimates reflect the agency ' s determination that the Clinton benefit package would be more generous than the average health_care plan available to American workers today . Reischauer stressed that his agency ' s report was not intended to be a condemnation of the Clinton plan . The CBO forecasts that by the year 2004 , the Clinton reform measure would reduce overall national health_care spending by 7 % , and &quot; holds_out the promise of reducing the deficit &quot; sometime after the year 2004 , Reischauer said . Clearly stung by the report , the White_House and its Democratic allies in Congress immediately sought to downplay its significance . The President , traveling in Shreveport , La. , insisted it was a minor problem . Following the Administration line , Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee stressed that the question of whether the Clinton health_care system would be considered a government program is an &quot; inside-the-Beltway issue. &quot; Rep . Robert T . Matsui ( D-Sacramento ) , a member of the panel , insisted that the report is &quot; good news for the Administration &quot; because it shows that , under the Clinton plan , both overall health_care costs and the deficit would finally begin to decline by the year 2004 . But Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D-Ill. ) acknowledged the adverse political impact of the report . &quot; I ' ve always said that the Clinton plan would be modified , &quot; Rostenkowski said . Clinton ' s critics agreed that the report could prove politically devastating . In effect , it strips away the distinctions the White_House has sought to create between its managed competition concept and a more direct government intervention in the health_care system . &quot; Today , CBO confirmed what many of us recognized months ago -- the Clinton health_care reform plan requires substantial new taxes , &quot; said Sen . Pete V . Domenici ( R-N . M. ) . Times staff writers Karen Tumulty and David Lauter contributed to this story .</TEXT>
