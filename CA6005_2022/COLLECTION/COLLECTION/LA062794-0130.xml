   <TEXT> Against the blood-stained backdrop of Rwanda ' s torment , two events in Africa -- one the culmination of a generation ' s struggle , the other a historical footnote -- signaled the end of an era last month . The widely chronicled milestone was the inauguration of Nelson Mandela to the South_African presidency . A continent that 47 years ago had been ruled by whites was now in the hands of the black majority . The Organization of African Unity responded by dissolving its liberation committee ; Africa ' s last war against white domination had been fought . What South_Africa ' s election showed the continent was that participants in a conflict could negotiate their differences without Western mediators or a U.N. military presence . The players understood the risks and the stakes , and in a region starved for leadership and new ideas , Mandela was treated as a messiah when he traveled_to Tunisia for the OAU summit this month . The other event was the defeat in Malawi ' s first free election of President H . Kamuzu Banda , 91 . The creator of_his_own personality cult -- his name adorned schools , airports and stadiums , and government-controlled newspapers referred to him as &quot; Savior &quot; or &quot; Messiah &quot; -- &quot; Life-President &quot; Banda was the last of Africa ' s founding_fathers who led their nations from colonialism to independence . A few weeks ago he moved_out of his luxurious Sanjika Palace , ending a 30-year autocratic rule , and into a modest residence on the outskirts of Blantyre . As he made his last official trip through Blantyre in a convoy of 30 cars , waving his fly whisk , the Malawians who had lined the street booed . Though the yardstick is an arbitrary one , the ascension of Mandela and the defeat of Banda seemed a symbolic end to the first chapter of sub-Saharan Africa ' s independence era . It lasted just over 30 years and was characterized by economic stagnation , political instability , deteriorating social_services , repression of individual liberties and the death of hundreds of thousands of innocents in wars the world has long since forgotten . There has been a considerable amount of stock-taking in the African media in recent weeks , much of it prompted by the tribal slaughter in Rwanda . Most commentators seem to agree that although some encouraging fundamental changes are taking_place , politically and economically , Africa begins the next leg of its independence journey in an unenviable position . About 6 million Africans are refugees . Thirty-one of the world ' s 41 countries with critical food shortages are in Africa , 18 of the world ' s 20 poorest countries are in Africa . Africa ' s debt burden stands at $ 300 billion . Wars are being fought in Rwanda , Sudan , Niger , Angola , Mali , Liberia and Sierra_Leone . In Mozambique , a just-concluded war claimed 1 million dead and wounded . Somalia , where people walk the violent streets of Mogadishu at their own peril , hasn ' t had a president or a government since 1991 . &quot; The leadership of Africa today is in a state of deep-seated bewilderment , &quot; said Jonathan Moyo , a Zimbabwean political_scientist at the Ford Foundation in Nairobi . &quot; Everywhere there is a vacuum . We need ideas , but who is going_to produce them ? &quot; The scholars haven ' t . They sound worldly , but they have not yielded usable or intelligible policies , and the universities and research_centers of yesterday have collapsed . The entrepreneurs ? They ' re despised by people as collaborators with the West and have never developed a sensible business culture . All three groups -- political , academic , business -- are bewildered , and even the Africans themselves seem to think this is a hopeless continent. &quot; Such an assessment stands_in stark contrast to the heady days of 1957 , when Britain ' s Gold_Coast became the Republic of Ghana , black_Africa ' s first ex-colony . The next year , France ' s Guinea became the second . In 1960 , 17 new African_nations would be born . Africans dreamed in those days of a united Africa stretching from the Indian_Ocean to the Atlantic . &quot; Since then , &quot; Kenya ' s newspaper , the Nation , said in a recent editorial , &quot; the dream has turned_into a nightmare and now ( with Rwanda ) . . . a horror. &quot; The sheer size of Africa ( four times larger than the United States , spanning seven time_zones ) and its diversity ( 600 million people who speak 2 # 000 languages and dialects ) were sufficient in themselves to render the dream implausible . But other forces were at_work . Some blame the colonialists who divided up Africa in the 1880s and , believing there were no African political_systems worthy of emulation , set_up Western-style institutions ; most crumpled soon after independence . Others blame Western donors who created a welfare continent , or the International Monetary Fund and World_Bank , which encouraged indebtedness . Many say the gravest problem rests squarely with African leadership . With a_few notable exceptions , African presidents , kings , emperors and generals have devoted their energies to defending themselves . This meant putting tribal concerns ahead of national interests . They sought total control , and this entailed destroying any institution capable of providing checks and balances -- the media , the judiciary , the opposition . In the process , these leaders became Boss Tweeds and their countries , Tammany_Halls . &quot; The economic_crisis that is threatening African society today has been caused mainly by the political elites who are interested only in clinging_to power and looting the resources of their country , &quot; said Yemane Ghebreab , head of political affairs for Eritrea ' s ruling party . However bleak the immediate future may seem , the Ford Foundation ' s Moyo and numerous African commentators believe one tragic era has ended and a new , more hopeful one is just beginning . Time , they say , is_on Africa ' s side and the world must take_account of the fact that , in terms of independence , most of Africa ' s 52 states are young and still struggling to put_in place institutions that will work . &quot; It took Africa 30 years to realize that the one-party system was not workable , &quot; Moyo said . &quot; After three decades of coups , this is not going_to become a happy story overnight , but what is wonderful is that the values for change -- the whole question of succession , the need for multiparties and freedom of expression -- those new values are now accepted by Africans . They will not be willing to turn back. &quot; Indeed , in a scenario that would have been unthinkable just a_few years ago , dozens of countries have marked the 1990s by drafting new constitutions , holding multiparty elections , loosening the restraints on freedom of expression and moving toward free-market economies . For every Zaire , which simply no longer exists as a nation-state , and every Nigeria , where the military seems to have become institutionalized , there is a country that has lifted itself out of warfare , tribalism and economic ruin and now appears to be making genuine progress . The common_denominator in each case is a strong president who has not depleted the treasury and who does not practice the politics of tribalism . Ethiopia , Eritrea and Uganda -- given_up for dead as political entities a generation ago -- all have made impressive strides in healing ethnic wounds and promoting democratic reforms and internal security . Mozambique has unified its army and the Renamo guerrillas into a single military_force and will hold elections in October . Togo held its first elections in February . In Zambia , Mali and Congo , entrenched leaders have been voted_out of office -- and abided_by the electoral results . The initiative for political reform and increased respect for human_rights generally has not come from Africa itself but from Western donors who have demanded rehabilitation as a condition for continued aid . Kenya ' s Daniel Arap Moi , widely regarded_as one of Africa ' s most proficient thieves , cut_down on detention and torture and agreed to elections only after the West suspended its entire $ 350-million aid package .</TEXT>
