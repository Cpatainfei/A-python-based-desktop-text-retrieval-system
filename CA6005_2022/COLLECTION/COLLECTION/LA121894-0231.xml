   <TEXT> There is a spiritual dimension to our present economic_crisis in Orange County . While much is being done and will continue to be done to address the fiscal aspect of the crises , we have spiritual work to do as well . For as_many years as I can recall , there has been a certain hubris operative in our county . One might call it the John Wayne syndrome of the individual pulling oneself up by his or her own bootstraps while going it alone defending God , Country and Motherhood . The only problem with this model is that no one goes it alone . Each of us is interdependent with everyone else . And lest we forget , beneath the image of John Wayne is nothing more_than Tinseltown . For as we remind ourselves , there was little more heroic about this fine actor ' s life than retakes of his scenes on the range or on the battlefield . It is time for our county to deepen its sensitivity to those who fall upon hard_times , not out of laziness , but due_to factors beyond their control -- like color of skin , ethnic or religious origin , or someone else speculating irresponsibility with a fiduciary responsibility over which they had little or no control . There is a spiritual principle operative here that goes something like this : What we do_in our lives down here opens_up spiritual energy forces above . For example , we need to be careful not to brag or feel superior over our good_fortune at another ' s expense . We have all had an experience such_as coming_home from a social_event and critiquing another couple . We smugly point_out our virtues over theirs , how they are constantly bickering while we are so sensitive to each other . And sure enough within hours or days we find ourselves bricking beyond control . We have , as it were , opened ourselves to accusation from above , and we find ourselves paying_for the arrogance . For years now we have been , with notable exceptions , less caring then we could have been . Our charitable contributions have fallen far short of our abilities . Even our public pronouncements have seldom created a context of compassion toward those less fortunate than ourselves . Now we as a county are_on the verge of experiencing heartbreak , and we fear for our own economic future . And so I suggest that we have a lot of spiritual work to do . Aside from all_the practical steps that will be taken by our political representatives and fiscal experts , we need to work_on ourselves as well . We need to allow our broken hearts to become open hearts . It is time to begin chiseling away the barnacles of hardness , of arrogance , of superiority feelings and open ourselves to compassion and caring . For each of our spiritual traditions have been telling us that only by our conduct down here on this earthly plane of time and space and monetary_funds do we affect the eternal dimensions above . By our life down here do we open channels of healthy or unhealthy energy flowing_from above . Let us begin this very season that finds so many living without . As we fear for our own fiscal future , let us use our broken hearts so that they open_to others a bit more compassionately and lovingly . Let us reach_out to those who have less so that the heavens may open and shower upon us a bit more wisdom to resolve our own crisis of pocketbook and soul .</TEXT>
