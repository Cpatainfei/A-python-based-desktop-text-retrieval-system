   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson and a delegation of Latino officeholders seeking to improve the quality of debate over immigration met Friday and found themselves in_agreement on at least two important issues . Wilson and the elected officials from Los Angeles agreed on the need for greater economic development in the home countries of immigrants and on the importance of retaining civilian control of U.S. borders , participants said . Two other issues -- the right to U.S. citizenship of children born to illegal immigrants and providing publicly financed health_care and education to illegal immigrants -- remained in_dispute between the governor and the Latino officeholders , all Democrats . However , representatives of the governor and PRIDE -- Proponents for Responsible Immigration Debate and Education -- called the private , 65-minute session in Wilson ' s office helpful in establishing a dialogue over immigration policies . PRIDE is made_up of local , state and federal elected officeholders from Los Angeles . Assemblyman Richard Polanco ( D-Los Angeles ) , chairman of the Legislature ' s Latino Caucus , termed the meeting &quot; historic and a success . The governor indicated he wants and is open_to more information . He welcomes more meetings. &quot; Beth Miller , a Wilson spokeswoman who attended the early evening meeting , called it an &quot; excellent beginning to a good dialogue &quot; even if the two sides did not reach agreement on all issues . PRIDE was recently organized to promote a higher level of public_debate over the emotion-charged immigration issue during this election year . &quot; Our purpose here is to promote a reasonable debate and discussion on public policy as it affects the undocumented and ( legal ) immigrants , &quot; Supervisor Gloria Molina of Los Angeles County told reporters . Other participants included Rep . Lucille Roybal-Allard , Councilman Mike Hernandez and Assemblywomen Martha M .
