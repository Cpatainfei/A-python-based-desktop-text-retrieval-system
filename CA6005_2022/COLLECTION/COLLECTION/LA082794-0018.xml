   <TEXT> The protective ozone_layer over North_America has rebounded from its extremely low level of two winters ago , but that doesn ' t mean it ' s time to relax . High-altitude &quot; ozone over the United States during the winter of 1993-1994 recovered from the record low values of the previous winter , &quot; a team of scientists reports in Geophysical Research Letters , which is published by the Washington-based American Geophysical Union . Ozone levels that were as much as 15 % below normal in 1992-1993 have risen to slightly above normal . The layer of ozone high in the atmosphere helps block dangerous ultraviolet_radiation from the sun . Too_much of this radiation can lead to skin_cancer , premature aging of the skin and eye damage . Samuel J . Oltmans , one of the researchers , stressed that the recovery of the ozone_layer doesn ' t mean it ' s safe to spend time in the sun without protection . &quot; There ' s still the long-term decline ( in ozone ) that ' s been going_on for the past dozen years or so , &quot; he said . &quot; The recovery really is a recovery to the levels represented by the long-term decline , it ' s not a recovery to levels that we saw in the mid-1970s , &quot; he said in a telephone_interview . Researchers at the University of Athens , Greece , reported in the same issue of the journal that their studies indicate a per-decade decline in ozone levels of 2.5 % in summer and 7 % in winter over populated areas . Chemicals from the eruption of Mt . Pinatubo in the Philippines helped cause the unusual ozone decline in the winter of 1992-93 , but that material has largely settled out of the air , scientists report . The new study was based on measurements of ozone in the atmosphere above Nashville ; Fresno ; Wallops Island , Va. , and Boulder , Colo . Oltmans said satellite measurements of ozone had similar findings . Damage to the ozone is associated with the chemical chlorine in the air . Environmentalists have fought in recent years to reduce this by limiting use of chlorine-containing gases in cosmetics and other manufacturing processes . The ozone damage was sharply increased by the chemicals blasted into the air by Pinatubo in 1991 , said Oltmans , of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ' s Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory in Boulder . Also taking_part in the study were researchers from the University of Colorado and the University of Wyoming . The so-called ozone_hole over the Antarctic has attracted the most attention in studies of this problem . During winter there , cold air becomes trapped over the South_Pole , giving chemicals plenty of time to damage the ozone_layer , which becomes seriously depleted . Ozone levels over the mid-latitudes , where most of the world ' s population live , have declined somewhat in recent years , but not to the extent of Antarctica , Oltmans noted . &quot; We ' ve learned something about the ability of . . . ( chemicals ) to affect the ozone_layer , to process chlorine into reactive forms , that we were somewhat less sure about prior to the eruption &quot; of Pinatubo , said Oltmans . The studies are continuing , he added .</TEXT>
