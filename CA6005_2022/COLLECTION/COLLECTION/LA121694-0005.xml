   <HEADLINE> DEMOCRACIES FACE THREATS TO FREEDOM ; HUMAN_RIGHTS : GROUP WARNS OF RISKS FROM ETHNIC TENSIONS , CORRUPTION , MILITARIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although world changes in 1994 have contributed to a record 114 democracies , many of those societies face critical threats from ethnic tensions , runaway corruption , excessive powers of the military or destabilization from abroad , says a Freedom House report released Thursday . &quot; Many democracies face serious challenges to their stability and are incapable of guaranteeing the basic rights of their citizens , &quot; warned Adrian Karatnycky , president of Freedom House , a nonpartisan , nonprofit human_rights group based in New York . Its annual survey of the world ' s 191 countries is the only respected , independent survey rating freedom worldwide . Among key examples cited in the report are Russia and Ukraine , world players undergoing &quot; wrenching transitions. &quot; Both are only partly free because of the absence of effective civic institutions , a truly free press or an independent judiciary , the report says . Russia also &quot; now threatens some neighbors and colludes in efforts to topple certain indigenous authorities , &quot; it asserts . Both countries risk serious regression . They are among 38 of 114 formal democracies that are not fully free , Freedom House ' s rating_system shows . It divides all 191 countries into three categories : free ; partly free or lacking some human_rights or civil_liberties ; not free and lacking most or all_rights and liberties . Elsewhere , major democracies such_as India and Turkey , as well as some new African democracies , have witnessed a &quot; substantial &quot; erosion of liberties because of ethnic and inter-sectarian strife . Many Latin_American democracies -- including Brazil , Colombia and Venezuela -- now face debilitating problems from chronic corruption and influential drug cartels . Bosnia-Herzegovina is the only formal democracy rated not free , because of its inability to provide civil_order as it copes_with ethnic strife and external destabilization . Freedom , the report concludes , &quot; continues to elude the vast majority of the world ' s people , with nearly 80 % living_in partly free and not free states. &quot; Of the world ' s 191 states , 54 are without civil_liberties and human_rights -- compared to 61 that have varying but limited degrees_of_freedom and 76 rated as fully free . Being a democracy does not mean that a country is fully free . And non-democratic states can have some freedoms , such_as free markets . The survey also issued warnings about future world flash_points . &quot; Rwanda ' s ethnic holocaust provided the archetypal nightmare that could occur elsewhere , &quot; it says . Somalia , where clan warfare rages on , faces partition . In India , military atrocities in Kashmir are an &quot; underreported human_rights debacle , &quot; while tensions are also mounting within the Hindu community and between Hindus and Muslims , the report says . In the Middle_East , Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein is engaged in an open campaign to &quot; annihilate &quot; the southern Shiite Muslim community and a covert campaign against northern Kurds . Regionally , Africa is the most volatile part of the world because of the weakness of civil society , the private sector and trade_unions , as well as the &quot; overarching influence of military elites &quot; in African political life , the report says . Despite the problems facing new and old democracies , the report struck an optimistic note . Almost 20 % of the world ' s population now lives_in societies with a complete range of freedoms . Seven new democracies this year -- South_Africa , Haiti , Ukraine , Mozambique , Malawi , Guinea-Bissau and Palau -- account_for an increase of about 70 million people . Even Africa has shown dramatic progress . Over the last five years , formal democracies in sub-Sahara Africa have mushroomed from three to 19 . But only eight of those democracies are rated as free .</TEXT>
