   <HEADLINE> THE HUBER MURDER CASE ; FAMALARO ' S ARREST LEAVES SEDONA RESIDENTS TALKING ; REACTION : TOWN STUNNED BY REVELATIONS , WHILE THOUGHTS OF POLICE TURN TO LOCAL UNSOLVED MURDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When residents learned that area handyman John Joseph Famalaro was accused of murdering a woman whose frozen body was found in his freezer , the thoughts of the town turned_to Marjorie ( Midge ) Hope . Hope , 50 , of Sedona left her job at a local souvenir shop on Halloween , 1992 , and was never seen alive again . Her car was found abandoned along a busy road , an eerie similarity to Denise A . Huber ' s disappearance the previous year . Hope ' s keys were still inside , along with her purse . A part of her skull -- with a bullet_hole -- was later found in the high dessert a_few miles away , along with her jawbone . Sedona Police_Chief Bob Irish said Tuesday that his department is looking_at Famalaro as a possible suspect in the Hope murder partly because of the similarities to Huber , who vanished from an Orange County freeway three years ago . Her bludgeoned body was discovered last week in a freezer in a truck parked in Famalaro ' s driveway in Dewey , about an hour ' s drive from here . &quot; Frankly , ( Huber ' s killing ) is a gruesome murder and we have reason to believe that Midge met a gruesome end , &quot; Irish said . &quot; It might turn_out there is no connection whatsoever but we know he was in the neighborhood when she was reported missing , so we are checking it out. &quot; Many in this artists ' community , which is nestled beneath scenic red rocks , said they were shocked by the arrest of Famalaro , who had worked as a house_painter , carpet cleaner , contract handyman and , most recently , real_estate salesman in the area . &quot; I tell you I considered him a friend . I used to hug him , but when I heard , the first thing I thought_of was ( Hope ) , &quot; said a local dry_cleaner who spoke on the condition that her name not be used . Famalaro had run his home improvement and carpet cleaning business in the area for about two years , operating the business out of a rented post_office box . In April , he began working for a Sedona real_estate company . Famalaro had become active in the local Chamber_of_Commerce and was a charter_member of the Sedona Referrals Club , a business networking group . He dropped_out of both organizations early this year , citing the need to spend more time with his aging parents who live next door to him at the Prescott Country_Club in Dewey . &quot; He was a kind , mild-mannered man , &quot; said real_estate_agent Gary Strohm , president of the networking group . &quot; I think I am a good judge of character , but I have been blindsided by all_of this. &quot; Strohm said Famalaro never talked_about women or indicated he had any kind of social life . He only talked_about business or family . &quot; We felt real sorry_for him because he was under a lot of stress , &quot; Strohm said . The dry_cleaning operator said Famalaro came_to her earlier this year distraught , worried about mounting bills , and feeling stretched thin by work and family obligations . ' At one point we considered having a charity event to raise money for him , &quot; she said . Earlier this year , Famalaro lost his Arizona contractor ' s license after customers complained about shoddy work and refusal to repair mistakes . He then began selling paints and other home improvement items . In court records filed since his arrest , he depicted himself as nearly destitute . In April , Famalaro joined the Real_Estate 101 firm in Sedona after presenting a resume that listed prior work as a licensed chiropractor , extensive college classes and a one-year stint as a Los Angeles Sheriff ' s Department reserve officer , said Dick Holborow , head of the agency . &quot; It was a very impressive resume , &quot; Holborow said adding that many agents did not know Famalaro well because usually worked in the office just one day a week . Before Famalaro joined the firm , Holborow said , he hired the handyman to clean the rugs at the company and was pleased with the results . Holborow said he is worried about the effect Famalaro ' s arrest will have_on his business . &quot; It certainly doesn ' t bode too well for this kind of operation . This whole_thing is bizarre , &quot; he said . Irish , the police_chief , said his interest in Famalaro has been piqued by the suspect ' s loner work habits and the amount_of_time he spent on_the_road as he traveled between California and Arizona . &quot; It could be completely aboveboard but it is something we need to check , &quot; said Irish , adding that Hope also had ties -- mainly old boyfriends -- to California . It is not known if Famalaro and Hope had ever met . Famalaro often advertised his services in the Red Rock News in Sedona . &quot; No gimmicks ! No catches ! No fine print ! &quot; an ad earlier this year promised . A woman who handles business advertising at the newspaper said she and other women in her office often suspected that Famalaro inflated stories about his business prowess to impress them . &quot; Let ' s just say we didn ' t believe all_of his stories , &quot; the saleswoman said , speaking on the condition of anonymity . One fellow real_estate_agent said she was considering fixing Famalaro up with a girlfriend because he seemed so nice . &quot; I am so glad it never happened , &quot; the agent said . &quot; I would never have forgiven myself. &quot; Another real_estate_agent said Famalaro had been urging her to take him around to see homes for_sale -- specifically vacant homes . The woman , who said Famalaro sometimes made her feel uneasy , kept postponing the outing . &quot; To me he just seemed a little weird -- the whole_thing about vacant homes , &quot; she said . &quot; My hair stood_up when I heard he was arrested. &quot; Chuck Warfield , a local printer , said Famalaro often appeared distracted while talking to others but chalked it up_to stress and his family life . Roy Juda , owner of a local engraving shop , said Famalaro had recently come_to him looking_to have a book -- possibly a Bible -- inscribed with calligraphy as a gift . Juda believed it was a gift for a recent graduate . Famalaro also ordered up a plastic real_estate name_tag to wear while doing showings . The tag and its $ 5.35 bill remained at the shop Tuesday . &quot; I don ' t think he is coming_to pick it up , &quot; Juda said .</TEXT>
