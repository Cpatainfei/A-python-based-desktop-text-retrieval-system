   <HEADLINE> ' ARYAN BEAUTY ' KILLING BRINGS DEATH_PENALTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Nazi sympathizer was sentenced to death Wednesday for killing a prominent plastic_surgeon because he promoted &quot; fake Aryan beauty. &quot; Jonathan Haynes was charged with murder in the Aug . 6 shooting of Dr. Martin Sullivan in his suburban Wilmette office . Circuit Judge Earl Strayhorn found him guilty last Friday . Haynes acted_as his own attorney but called no witnesses and presented no evidence . The judge said he searched for mitigating factors that might have resulted in a sentence of life in prison without parole but found none . Haynes , 35 , showed no reaction when the sentence was pronounced . His father and court-appointed public_defender have contended that he is insane , but in November Haynes was ruled fit for trial . The former government chemist espoused neo-Nazi views during his various court appearances . &quot; You fought World_War_II against Aryan beauty , and now you try to fake it with cosmetics , &quot; Haynes said during the trial . Shortly before his sentencing , Haynes reaffirmed his disgust with cosmetic_surgery , hair_coloring and blue-tinted contact_lenses , saying , &quot; I condemn fake Aryan beauty. &quot; Haynes faces extradition to California in the 1987 slaying of a San Francisco hair colorist . Death_penalty cases are automatically appealed_to the Illinois Supreme Court .</TEXT>
