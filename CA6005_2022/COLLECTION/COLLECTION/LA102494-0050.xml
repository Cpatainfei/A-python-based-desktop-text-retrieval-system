   <HEADLINE> TIPS TO BRIDGE THE COMMUNICATION GAP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here ' s some advice from experts about how to have a candid , sincere discussion with your partner about sex : * Resist knee-jerk responses to your partner ' s comments . Listen before you respond . Be kind , gentle and patient . &quot; People get defensive because this is such a sensitive subject , &quot; says Tibor Jukelevics , a Torrance psychologist . For example , they might wrongly assume a partner who fumbles when talking_about sex is being critical . &quot; It ' s just difficult for them to talk . Getting upset , rather than trying to understand , can turn a harmless comment into a hurtful argument. &quot; * Save sexual criticisms , says sociologist Pepper Schwartz . Nothing stings a relationship or squashes an ego more_than a sexual insult , even if it ' s not intended to be one . This is particularly true if the comment relates to performance , or penis or breast size . * Discuss techniques after sex . &quot; It ' s a private and safe time to say , ' I really liked it when you touched me like this , or kissed me like that , &quot; says Marilyn Fithian , co-director of the Center for Marital and Sexual Studies in Long_Beach . Such praise encourages a partner to repeat the feel-good techniques . It also makes them more confident about pleasing a partner ' s sexual requests . &quot; Say it in a way that flatters them , such_as , ' I would love it if you touched me here. ' &quot; * Broach emotional feelings about sex at a time when both partners are relaxed , Fithian says , when intimacy and mutual respect are at their peak . &quot; There ' s likely to be more understanding and self-revelation. &quot; * View portrayals of sex in the mass media with skepticism . Don ' t compare yourself to someone who is not real . Psychotherapist Bonnie Maslin understands why people like to compare . Sex still worries most of us , she writes in &quot; The Angry Marriage : Overcoming the Rage , Reclaiming the Love &quot; ( Hyperion , 1994 ) . &quot; Am I normal ? Do we do_it enough ? Why do I feel this way ? Why do I think this way ? &quot; * Be wary , for example , when hearing about a friend ' s wild night of lusty , no-strings-attached sex . &quot; People often exaggerate to make themselves sound good , &quot; Maslin adds . * Understand that an occasional diminishing interest in sex is normal . &quot; Sexual encounters eventually lose the glow of romantic excitement they had when couples first met , &quot; Maslin writes . &quot; Burning love doesn ' t continue to burn indefinitely. &quot; * Concentrate_on resolving self-esteem and relationship problems . &quot; Sex is not separate from other parts of your life , &quot; says Judith Wallerstein , founder of the Center for the Family in Transition , in Northern California . &quot; A low self-image or communication problems show_up in the bedroom. &quot; * Realize that extra sensitivity is needed if a partner has ever been sexually abused . The recent University of Chicago study found that adults who were sexually touched as children have higher rates of sexual dysfunction . * Acknowledge communication barriers relating to gender , religious and ethnic differences . For instance , a finding from a 1992 study in the Journal of Sex Research discussed how men and women incorrectly perceived each other ' s sexual_desires . &quot; This is because men and women are brought_up differently , &quot; says Jukelevics , the Torrance psychologist . &quot; Women tend to value intimacy while men express themselves through physical activity . The differences can create sexual misunderstandings. &quot; * Pinpoint words that might be a source of embarrassment , Jukelevics suggests . &quot; Sometimes it ' s best for couples to come_up with their own names of genitalia or sexual acts . This makes them more comfortable. &quot; * Learn about sex from books and videos . Stores are_full of them . &quot; I found that to be an easy way to bring_up the subject , especially if we were both studying the same thing , &quot; says Maureen Ward , a Malibu resident who no longer has an unsatisfying sex life . &quot; It ' s easier to say something like , ' Honey , I read this book about hanging from a chandelier , and I think I know a way we can really enhance our sex life.
