   <TEXT> * Whether the consumers are American , Asian or Russian , the basic attraction of American fast-food restaurants lies_in the adjective &quot; fast &quot; ( Column One , Feb . 19 ) . Fast-food chains keep costs down by buying_in bulk , operate efficiently using time-tested methods , and the end_products are consistently uniform and the service is fast . Not too very long ago , eating_out was the sole privilege of the affluent . Now , any plain Joe ( or Chong or Ivan or Kim ) can pack up the kids and go_out to eat_at a local fast-food restaurant ( or Joe can grab a quick lunch and not have to carry a lunch box ) . No wonder the world community embraces this American innovation . LOUISE HAUTER La Canada</TEXT>
