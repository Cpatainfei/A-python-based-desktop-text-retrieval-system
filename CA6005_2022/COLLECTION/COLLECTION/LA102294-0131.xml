   <HEADLINE> AL MARTINEZ : PRIDE AND PREJUDICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I returned from vacation last Sunday just in time to see 70 # 000 human_beings march through the streets of Los Angeles . What these human_beings were marching for was to rally opposition to a ballot measure that is detrimental to other human_beings . The marchers hit the streets with pride and determination , an angry species on a small , blue planet 93 million miles from the sun , trying to make_a_point on a ball in space whose inhabitants are always in a stew about something . The human_beings were marching against a Proposition called 187 that ' s coming_to a vote_in a_couple_of weeks in a state called California that ' s part of the ball bouncing through the void . The proposition is aimed at people who somehow cross an arbitrary line , a border , in_order to , of course , get_to the other side . This angers some_other human_beings who don ' t want those from the other side of the line on their side of the line without getting approval . It ' s kind of like asking &quot; Mother , may I ? &quot; before you cross . I realize that seems kind of silly in a cosmic sense , since they ' re all part of the same species on the same planet and have a lot bigger things to worry about than lines on the ground , but that ' s the way it is . They ' re a primitive species . To punish these human_beings who cross the line without a mother-may-I , others have proposed the measure called 187 , which , by the way , is the state ' s numerical designation for murder . It doesn ' t propose killing the Other-Siders , but it sure would make life unpleasant for them if it passes . * Humans are good at making things miserable for one another . A quick trip through Earth ' s history shows they ' ve been hanging , burning , shooting , crucifying , stabbing , bombing and generally mutilating each other since they crawled out of the swamps . They ' ve gone_to_war over race , religion , culture , language , food , oil , gold , water , pieces_of_paper and all those arbitrary lines they draw_on the ground , and sometimes even on the water and in the air . There ' s been enough hatred on that planet to fill hell , and every identifiable group in the race of human_beings has felt its sting . They killed 6 million of_their_own kind not too long ago , even children , for no reason ; decent , loving , good people . And I can ' t escape the feeling they ' d kill 6 million more of any kind at all if they had half the chance . They ' re still not very far from the edge of the swamp , I guess ; small creatures crawling angrily toward sunlight . Getting_back to the Proposition called 187 , I ' m not saying everyone who ' s for it is a hater or a killer . They ' re human_beings who are worried and afraid about what ' s happening to their world . It used to be humans had moments of tranquillity between wars when they could walk the streets and do their shopping and sit on a park_bench without being shot down for the pennies in their pockets . It used to be they could get jobs easily and rest assured they ' d keep them . that ' s not true anymore and , just as they ' ve always done , the humans are looking_around for people to blame who , though members of the same species , aren ' t quite like them . So they look_to the other side of the line . * I was impressed by the march last Sunday , but I ' m an emotional kind of guy , easily moved when I see members of the same species celebrating their small differences by banding_together for a common_good . So I took the time to talk to a lot of human_beings who say they ' re going to vote for 187 , even though it will keep kids from going_to school and sick people from going_to hospitals . I was right about them . Some are haters , sure , and will tell you there are just too damned many Mexicans in L.A. , but most are humans worried about what ' s happening to their little worlds . They want to send a message to those on the other side of the line to stay there , to master their own destinies , so that both sides can prosper and everyone ' ll be happy . Separate but equal , kind of . I worry too . I worry for all_of us humans and what ' s going_to happen not only to us , but to those around us we love so_much . But I ' m going_to tell you , one human_being to another , that 187 isn ' t an answer to anything . The message is all wrong . It ' s mean and small-minded and punishes those most easily hurt , children and sick people . I ' ve tried to point this out_in a cosmic sense , because maybe it ' s about time we stopped blaming people who cross lines and start looking_around for solutions that will benefit every member of the human_race . When you stop to think_about it , we may_not be much , but we ' re all we ' ve got . And we ' re all on one planet together .</TEXT>
