   <HEADLINE> ALL L.A. ' S A STAGE AS WORLD WATCHES THE SIMPSON TRIAL ; MEDIA : TO MANY OVERSEAS , THE DRAMA DISPLAYS WHAT THEY SEE AS AMERICA ' S ESSENCE -- HOLLYWOOD , RACISM AND VIOLENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As millions of Americans tune_in to the O.J. Simpson murder trial , much of the world is tuning_in to America . From the beginning , the Simpson case has been a kind of two-way mirror . While Americans debate its legal and moral content and reflect on its meaning for American society , the world watches and analyzes America ' s media , its legal_system and its seeming penchant for self-examination . To many abroad , this is simply the quintessential American story : a gruesome murder in Hollywood ( to Europeans , all_of Los Angeles is Hollywood ) ; an American hero ' s flight down a freeway with those all-American accouterments , a gun and a cellular_telephone , broadcast live to a country transfixed ; then , court television and , possibly , a final act played_out in state_prison . The drama is described as American soap_opera and Hollywood action film , &quot; Columbo &quot; and &quot; L.A. Law &quot; in one . When , last June , fans lined the freeway to cheer on a man sought for murder and threatening suicide , it was viewed from afar as the the ultimate Hollywood blurring of life and docudrama . &quot; The fascinated nation is being presented a play that is half Shakespeare , half soap_opera : Othello and Richard Kimble , garnished with a bit of Coppola ' s ' Apocalypse Now , ' &quot; wrote the German weekly magazine Stern , which has made much of the fact that Nicole Brown Simpson was born in Germany . &quot; I can ' t imagine it happening anywhere else in the world , &quot; said Nicole Marchand , a Belgian accountant who viewed the spectacle from Namur . To audiences baffled by a country that prefers a tedious legal_proceeding to the World Cup , foreign correspondents based in Washington and Los Angeles this summer have had to explain American psyche and sociology . Millions of Americans are_on a first-name basis with Simpson , they wrote . No , not first_name -- first initials . They feel as if he is a personal friend . They feel &quot; as if a family member had been torn from their midst , &quot; Stern explained . &quot; No country in the world builds pedestals for its heroes , especially its sporting heroes , as high and as gilded as this one does , &quot; Independent of London correspondent David Usborne wrote days after Simpson ' s dramatic arrest June 17 . Or , as his colleague Peter Pringle saw it , Americans were &quot; once again confusing film_stars and sports celebrities with real heroes. &quot; Europeans in particular seem incredulous at how thoroughly the Simpson case took_over -- and will again consume -- American airwaves and brain_waves . &quot; Remember -- and this may be hard for a British reader to imagine , &quot; Anne Applebaum wrote in the Spectator magazine , &quot; that the O.J. Simpson story was , at various moments over the past six weeks , running_on CNN 24 hours a day while leading all_of the news_programs and simultaneously appearing on the front pages of every newspaper and the front covers of every news magazine . This is not even to mention the dozens and dozens of ever-multiplying talk_shows and television ' magazine ' programs , each with its celebrity host and celebrity guests , each with its own angle , tabloid-trashy or upmarket-serious or caring-therapeutic. &quot; Tragedy as soap_opera is more_than some can stomach . The Montreal Gazette ' s Jack Todd called Simpson fans on the freeway &quot; the warped and weird thousands. &quot; Noting that USA Today had said the case &quot; tarnished &quot; Simpson ' s image , Todd wrote , &quot; If there ' s anything more sickening than the crimes of which Simpson stands accused , it ' s the reactions of the millions who just don ' t get it. &quot; The case confirms the beliefs of many about America ' s worst traits : It is a racist country addicted to violence and sensationalism . The Simpson trial is an extension of the Clarence Thomas hearings and the Los Angeles riots , of the Menendez brothers ' murder trial and the William Kennedy Smith and Lorena Bobbitt and Tonya Harding and . . . . It ' s all one big media blur . &quot; To satisfy the spectacular nature of the market one no longer hesitates to show a manhunt live , &quot; sniffed Paul Nahon in the_French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur . &quot; There is no longer any limit . Neither to the sordid nor the cynical. &quot; Michio Ochi of the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun indicted America for racism . &quot; Time magazine printed a cover of O.J. Simpson that darkened his face so that he looked_like a vicious criminal . It symbolized a malicious intent of white , mainstream people to pull this black murderer of his divorced Caucasian wife down from his ' Hercules ' status and to throw him back into the slum from which he made the toughest effort to escape. &quot; And in the Independent , Kenan Malik wrote , &quot; After Simpson ' s arrest , the Los Angeles Police_Department faced considerable criticism for having allowed him to escape in the first place . ' If it had been any other black_man , ' said a young African American angrily , ' he would have been arrested , handcuffed and thrown_in the slammer so quick he would n ' t have known what hit him. ' He was articulating his anger about the LAPD ' s racist attitudes toward ordinary blacks . White Americans have been making the same point -- but for very different reasons . What they want to know is why Simpson was treated like a celebrity , when he is just a black man. &quot; The international media note that racism is both an agonizing issue for the American public and part of the defense ' s strategy . The defense ' s plan to impugn the integrity of the police_officers who investigated the case will raise &quot; bad cop &quot; issues , as in the Rodney G . King case , and consequently , will force Americans to further examine what is wrong with themselves and their society . &quot; When ( toddler ) James Bulger was murdered by two children last year , Britain also descended into an orgy of self-examination . . . . But in the end , Britain did not put itself on_trial , &quot; Applebaum wrote in the Spectator . &quot; In America , however , the use of terms borrowed from psychoanalysis is so widespread -- popularized by countless self-help books and talk_show hosts with therapy training -- that it no longer seems odd that the whole society should be held accountable for a single crime , &quot; she wrote . Adding that American political commentators sometimes refer to Yugoslavia as a &quot; dysfunctional country , &quot; she went_on to say it is hardly surprising that a celebrity murder is seen &quot; as an occasion for national soul-searching and an investigation of racism -- the great national personality_disorder -- rather than as a time to evaluate the facts. &quot; Now the international media explain how the American trial will proceed , how the two sides will work the jury . As the defense tries to raise doubts about police integrity and competence , the prosecution will try to &quot; wipe_away the image of the nice guy who has worked his way up from the ghetto to the dream factory , and produce the one of a common murderer , &quot; wrote Michael Schwelien in the German newspaper Die Zeit . All of this will be played_out as an American story on American television , the media note . &quot; This kind of television has elements of a brothel , &quot; Schwelien wrote . &quot; But a brothel with a separate room for self-righteousness . The viewer is allowed to moan ' Terrible , terrible , ' while the juicy details of sex- and blood-crimes are put_on the table. &quot; Times staff writers Tyler Marshall in Brussels , Scott Kraft in Paris and Craig Turner in Toronto contributed to this report . Times researchers Chiaki Kitada in Tokyo and Reane Oppl in Bonn also contributed . * JURY SELECTION : Final panelists will fill_out detailed questionnaires . B1</TEXT>
