   <HEADLINE> IT ' S WELFARE POLITICS VS . GROWTH ECONOMICS ; ECONOMY : THE WORLD ' S LEADING DEMOCRACIES MUST MAKE SOME HARD CHOICES BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER GUARANTEE PROSPERITY AND SECURITY TO ALL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The good news for the &quot; economic summit &quot; -- convening in Italy this weekend -- is that the major industrial countries have embarked_on a modest recovery . After a two-year slump , Europe ' s economy seems to be growing at a 2 1 / 2 % to 3 % annual rate . Japan shows faint signs of recovery , and the U.S. expansion continues . The bad news is that a normal recovery won ' t cure the deeper problems of these rich democracies . All face a collision between welfare politics and growth economics . Almost no one wants unfettered free markets ; but rigid markets suffocate economic_growth . Politics specializes in distributing benefits and protecting people against hardship . By contrast , strong economic_growth requires that people take risks and adapt to change . The democratic dilemma is that voters everywhere expect their governments to deliver both prosperity and security . This is a hard , often impossible , feat . Europe , where joblessness is now approaching 12 % , has coped least well . Consider : * In France , the combination of a high minimum_wage and steep payroll taxes makes_it nearly twice as costly for companies to hire low-skilled workers as in the United States . * In Italy , companies can hire only from state employment_agencies and must hire 15 % of workers from a list of &quot; disabled &quot; and another 12 % from a list of &quot; disadvantaged &quot; . * Payroll taxes -- to finance unemployment , health , disability and pension programs -- are as high as 30 % to 50 % of wages . ( The U.S. rate is 15.3 % . ) There are also big mandated labor costs . France requires seven weeks of paid time_off . * By U.S. standards , unemployment benefits are high and last much longer . In some countries ( Spain , Denmark ) , workers receive about 70 % of lost wages ; In the United States , the rate is about 25 % . * In the_Netherlands , disability laws are so generous and lax that one-seventh of the labor_force receives disability_payments , though the Dutch are no less healthy than anyone else . Social justice is not advanced by foolish economics . If you make_it too expensive to hire people , companies won ' t . If you pay people not to work , they won ' t . The damage is not done_by any one policy ; it is the collective impact of many costly policies . In Europe , there has been little net private job creation in two decades . In Japan , the problem is different . Export-led growth is no longer workable , because Japan ' s huge trade surpluses have pushed_up the yen ' s value -- and made Japanese cars , machinery and electronics more expensive . In 1994 , Japanese exports will grow only 1 % . The imbalance in foreign-exchange markets ( as exporters change dollars for yen ) raises the yen ' s value . This will continue until Japan increases its imports by stronger domestic spending and more open markets . There ' s the rub . Domestic spending is hobbled . A cumbersome distribution system raises consumer prices . Inefficient farmers produce expensive foods and oppose imports . Cartels collude on prices and restrict imports . Zoning laws raise land values and impede housing construction . These practices dampen domestic spending but enhance the well-being of strong vested_interests . Japan ' s brand of welfare politics protects these privileges . The effect is to subvert economic expansion . There are lessons for the United States -- and they are mostly ignored . The Clinton_Administration acts_as if it can enact a new tax here and a new program there without having any effect on the economy . It proposes a massive new payroll tax in the form of mandated employer-paid health_insurance . The spirit in Congress is similar . There ' s little recognition that , as in Europe and Japan , the rising burdens of government may accumulate over time and slowly sap the economy ' s vitality . What unites the leaders of the seven major nations at the summit ( the United States , Japan , Germany , France , Britain , Italy and Canada ) is a reluctance to face these problems . But the danger of avoiding them is creating a vicious_circle of slowing growth and rising political conflict . As growth falters , the cost of government welfare rises . This increases tax_rates or budget_deficits , which further impedes growth . Governments are then torn between breaking promises ( by withdrawing benefits ) and suffocating their economies ( by maintaining existing policies ) . Europe is already caught in this trap . Governments are striving to reduce budget_deficits and spur economic_growth by trimming some welfare benefits . But the cutbacks are small and unpopular , precisely because people are so used_to being protected . Sweden recently lengthened the waiting period for &quot; sick &quot; benefits by a day . Absenteeism dropped sharply . What leaders in Europe , Japan and the United States should do ( but aren ' t ) is to use the economic recovery to eliminate the least justifiable government spending and regulations . These changes are hard now , but they will be much harder later . The welfare_state has become too_much a part of the social fabric of too many nations . But someone has to save the welfare_state from itself . If its excesses aren ' t curbed , it will become its own worst enemy .</TEXT>
