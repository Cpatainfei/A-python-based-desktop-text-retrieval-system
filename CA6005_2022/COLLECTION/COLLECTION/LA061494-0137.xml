   <HEADLINE> NORTH_KOREA QUITS NUCLEAR AGENCY , EXPELS INSPECTORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> North_Korea escalated its confrontation with the West over its alleged nuclear_weapons program Monday , saying it is withdrawing from the International Atomic Energy Agency and expelling the agency ' s weapons inspectors from its territory . It also renewed threats -- this time in a formal statement by its Foreign Ministry -- to go_to_war against South_Korea and its allies if the United Nations imposes punitive sanctions , as the United States is urging it to do . Although Pyongyang technically remains a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , its withdrawal from the international agency marks a further act of defiance against the United States and its allies and is likely to intensify sentiment for U.N. sanctions . But at_the_same_time , Western analysts expressed apprehension that North_Korea ' s decision might enable Pyongyang to develop a nuclear_weapons program without fear of serious monitoring by the West . President Clinton is expected to approve a draft resolution today or Wednesday calling_for the gradual phasing in of economic and political restrictions . The step-by-step sanctions would be designed to give Pyongyang time to comply with inspections before a full-scale embargo takes_effect . Madeleine Albright , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said Monday that she hopes to begin outlining details of the plan almost immediately to members of the U.N. Security_Council . Officials said that final Security_Council action could come_by the month ' s end . But officials here said Monday ' s developments could delay final approval of the U.S. proposal , at least until Administration policy-makers can review the situation and decide how to respond . North_Korea ' s withdrawal from the 120-country agency ostensibly is in retaliation for the IAEA decision Friday to withhold $ 250 # 000 in technical aid to Pyongyang as a result of its refusal to allow inspectors to take samplings of spent fuel rods from a nuclear_reactor . &quot; We will immediately withdraw from the IAEA , &quot; the country ' s Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News_Agency . It said that international inspectors &quot; now will have nothing to do any further in our country. &quot; U.S. reaction to the North_Korean announcement was muted -- partly because , except for the statement carried by the news_agency , Pyongyang still has not formally notified the United Nations or the Vienna-based atomic_energy agency of its decision . The agency had already closed for the day . But officials said Pyongyang ' s move would dash allied hopes that North_Korea ' s nuclear program could be monitored satisfactorily . Pyongyang already has destroyed virtually all past evidence that could point to any manufacture of nuclear_weapons . Robert L . Gallucci , assistant secretary_of_state for political affairs , said Monday that a North_Korean withdrawal -- and expulsion of agency weapons inspectors -- would be &quot; a very , very serious development for the worse. &quot; * Pyongyang ' s statement Monday was accompanied by a renewed warning from the Foreign Ministry that any imposition of U.N. sanctions would be &quot; regarded immediately as a declaration of war. &quot; There was no indication how soon , if at all , North_Korea might also withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . Pyongyang withdrew from the treaty briefly last year but &quot; suspended &quot; its decision under pressure from the United States . Analysts are divided over the implications of such a move . While some argue that the West would no longer have a legal basis for imposing sanctions against Pyongyang , U.S. officials said that the United Nations still could act to preserve &quot; international peace and security. &quot; Officials cautioned that the Administration ' s draft sanctions resolution still has not won full approval from U.S. allies . For example , although Tokyo has agreed to block North_Koreans in Japan from sending money home , key details are still undecided . One version of the resolution would allow Japan to postpone any restrictions on sending money to North_Korea until the later phases of the sanctions plan . In another , Japan would block such remittances immediately but only if they exceed a specific amount . The White_House declined to provide further details on the sanctions , which it has described as relatively mild in initial stages , intensifying to a full-scale embargo . Meanwhile , South_Korean newspapers quoted officials there as saying the United States is considering &quot; doubling &quot; the combat capability of U.S. forces in the country and bringing_in more Patriot air_defense batteries . The Pentagon declined to comment . But Defense_Department officials said they are continuing to bolster U.S. forces in South_Korea gradually . Clinton also called Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin on Monday , partly to talk_about North_Korea . White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Clinton also had hoped to call Chinese President Jiang Zemin but was unable to do so because of what the White_House called scheduling problems . Others said that Jiang preferred not to conduct diplomacy by telephone . Both countries are important to passage of a sanctions resolution because , as permanent members of the Security_Council , they have the power to veto any such measure . Separately , former President Jimmy_Carter arrived in Seoul on Monday on the first stop of a trip to South and North_Korea . Although he is technically traveling as a private citizen , he has been briefed by the White_House on U.S. policy .</TEXT>
