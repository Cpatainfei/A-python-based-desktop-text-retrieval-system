   <HEADLINE> THE CASE OF THE MAN IN THE YELLOW SWEATER ; FORMER PHOTOGRAPHER SUES TABLOID FOR LIBEL OVER KENNEDY ASSASSINATION ARTICLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Khalid Khawar ' s hands trembled as he held the latest copy of the Globe . It was the spring of 1989 , and the supermarket tabloid blared headlines about how Marlon Brando was near death , how baldness could be cured with a combination of vodka and Alka Seltzer and how the Iranian secret_police had killed Bobby Kennedy in Los Angeles 21 years before . And inside was a picture of Khawar , and a caption identifying him as an Iranian agent who pulled the trigger . Khawar -- then a photojournalist and now a Bakersfield farmer -- was standing next to Kennedy on that night long ago , only minutes before the assassination . Khawar was wearing a yellow sweater and a camera hung_around his neck . In the tabloid , a large black arrow was pointed at his head , blaming him for the crime . The story , based on a book by conspiracy theorist Robert Morrow , said an Iranian agent -- not Sirhan Sirhan -- was the real killer and that the camera was really a gun loaded with four bullets . Khawar was stunned , then afraid . At first he kept his mouth shut and hoped that no one would notice . But they did . So Khawar got a lawyer and sued . This week , his libel suit is being played_out in Santa Monica Superior_Court . It has turned_into a lively reprise of Robert Kennedy ' s assassination , complete with video clips and testimony from the_likes_of football great Rosie Grier , who was at Kennedy ' s side the night he died . It has offered a glimpse into the strange life and times of conspiracy theorists , the supermarket tabloids and , more_than anything else , the Man in the Yellow Sweater . It was odd how things could change in an instant . For years , the picture of Khawar standing next to Kennedy had held a place of honor in the office of his Bakersfield farm . He treasured the few minutes he had shared the spotlight with the heir to the Kennedy legacy . Minutes after Kennedy left the podium at the Ambassador Hotel , he was led through the pantry on the way to a news_conference . There , a Palestinian named Sirhan Sirhan lunged toward Kennedy firing a . 22-caliber pistol . Kennedy lay dying in a pool of blood , an image that remains fixed in the American consciousness . Sirhan was convicted of the assassination . But the story in the Globe suggested that Khawar was the killer . It ran his picture and said he was an agent sent by the Shah of Iran on behalf of the Mafia , no less , to kill Kennedy . ( Curiously , though , the man in the picture was identified as Ali Ahmand , a variant of Khawar ' s father ' s name. ) &quot; I just couldn ' t believe it . I was in a state of shock , &quot; Khawar said . &quot; I had to sit_down in a chair before I could read the article. &quot; The Globe says it is blameless , that it merely printed allegations made by Morrow in his book . And they also say it is not their responsibility to re-investigate the allegations made in the book . &quot; We ' re here simply as a deep pocket , &quot; Globe lawyer Anthony Glassman said . &quot; We reported a newsworthy event and feel we shouldn ' t be here. &quot; Morrow , who lives_in Cincinnati , has not bothered to come_to the trial . He said he has not libeled anyone and that it would not make any difference in any event because he is an old_man who does not have any money . &quot; I stand_by the book because this is the way I understood it , &quot; he said . This is not the first time Morrow has come_up with theories that have had a bizarre twist to them . He also says he has unwittingly supplied the CIA with the guns used to assassinate John F . Kennedy and wrote another book about how that happened . The chain of circumstances that landed the dispute in the Santa Monica courthouse started in 1962 when Khawar came_to Los Angeles from Pakistan to study at a technical_school , then at Pacific States University . Over time , he said , he began writing articles for a Pakistani magazine , covering such topics as agriculture , baseball and politics . On June 4 , Khawar walked to the Ambassador Hotel , only a_few blocks from where he was living , to cover the Kennedy camp as the primary results rolled in . As the time approached for Kennedy to claim victory , Khawar stepped_on stage with dozens of other reporters and photographers . Cameras clicked , flashes blinked , catching not only the image of Kennedy , but also of Khawar . He stood so close that he could have reached_out and touched Kennedy as the presidential candidate delivered what turned_out to be his last public utterance : &quot; Now it ' s on to Chicago and let ' s win there ! &quot; Then came the terrible events of the next few minutes , with Sirhan killing Kennedy . But according to Morrow , someone else was firing as well -- a man he called Ali Ahmand but identified in several of the book ' s pictures as the photographer in the yellow sweater : Khalid Iqbar Khawar . &quot; Ahmand watched through his viewfinder as the startled and dodging presidential candidate tried to back_away from the wild-eyed gunman , &quot; Morrow wrote in his book &quot; The Senator Must Die , &quot; which sold few copies . &quot; Then as Bobby literally backed into him , Ahmand pushed the lethal camera up behind the senator ' s ear and pulled the release mechanism. &quot; It is interesting to note that Morrow says he has gotten his information about the assassination from a high-ranking member of the Iranian secret_police . Morrow said the informant told him he was willing to testify before a congressional committee but , as fate would have it , was murdered a_few weeks later . While Morrow paints one picture of what happened , Khawar paints quite another . He said he was not_able to get_to the pantry after shots were fired because the way was blocked by the time he got there . In court , Khawar displayed a number of pictures taken_after the killing , most of them of people weeping upon learning that Kennedy had been shot . Khawar said that after the shooting , police interrogated everyone remaining in the ballroom , including him . He said he left the Ambassador Hotel at 2 a.m. and walked home . As for the camera that was supposedly a gun , Khawar said he still owns the Nikon that he wore around his neck that night . In court , one of his three lawyers , Richard Knickerbocker , walked down the row of jurors with the lens removed from the camera body . &quot; Now I don ' t see a gun inside there , &quot; he said , incredulously . In November , with his education complete , Khawar returned to the Pakistani town of Faisalabad , where he had grown_up . But before he left , he said , he called the police and gave them a forwarding address in case they needed to talk to him further about the assassination . Three years later , Khawar returned to Los Angeles with his new wife . The opportunities in Pakistan had been limited and the political climate was unsettled . After working for six years in the electronics field , Khawar struck_out on_his_own , buying 150 acres of farmland near Bakersfield . He eventually expanded the farm to 320 acres of citrus and grapes . The family prospered . Three children arrived . Khawar ' s father came from Pakistan to live with them . For all to see , Khawar and his family were moving through life in relative obscurity , making no waves , paying taxes and , eventually , becoming U.S. citizens . That changed in April , 1989 , when the Globe hit the supermarkets . Inside was the story , with the headline proclaiming &quot; Former CIA Agent Claims : Iranians Killed Bobby Kennedy for the Mafia. &quot; And with it was the picture that hung_in Khawar ' s office , the same picture that had run in Time magazine in the edition immediately after the assassination . The only difference was the arrow pointing at Khawar ' s head . &quot; I got very scared because I had seen on television in 1963 when Lee Harvey Oswald was murdered by Jack Ruby even before he was charged or tried in a court of law , &quot; Khawar said . His next instinct was silence , hoping that no one would notice that the Bakersfield farmer was the same person in the Globe picture . But his oldest son came_home one day asking what was going_on , what was all this about his father and the assassination of Robert Kennedy ? Then came the telephoned threats , his son ' s car being vandalized , the house being pelted with eggs , the fear that something serious would happen to his family . There was another threatening phone_call only last month . Khawar paid a visit to Bakersfield lawyer Craig Edmunson . Now , there are six lawyers lining the tables in the courtroom , three for each side . The trial is expected to last at least another week in the court of Judge Richard Harris . It is being tried in Santa Monica because Morrow ' s now-defunct publisher , Roundtable Publishing , was located there . Morrow , in a letter written to his agent last year , suggested that the whole matter could be cleared_up in his book by taking_out the pictures and changing the name of the supposed assassin , Ali Ahmand , to a generic &quot; Mohammed. &quot; The agent , Andrew Ettinger , said he is surprised the case ever got this far . &quot; I think it ' s bizarre , &quot; he said . &quot; There are so many questions regarding the Robert Kennedy assassination . This is probably the least of them. &quot; On a final note , Khawar , who found himself in this predicament because of a picture , is now ducking photographers . As his lawyer said : &quot; There are a lot of crazy people out there. &quot;</TEXT>
