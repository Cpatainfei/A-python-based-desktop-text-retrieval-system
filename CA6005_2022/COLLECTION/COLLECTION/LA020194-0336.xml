   <HEADLINE> GIVING_UP THE SHIP ; CHEVRON ' S LOCAL TANKER BUSINESS HALTED BY A MISSED DEADLINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chevron Corp. , which fought a decade-long battle to ship oil by tanker through the Santa Barbara Channel , will cease shipping operations today after failing to secure a deal with a pipeline_company to move oil after its shipping permit expires in 1996 , according to public and company officials . Under its California Coastal Commission permit , Chevron had until today to line_up a permanent pipeline to move the crude being pumped from its massive Point Arguello offshore fields to refineries in Los Angeles . Without such an agreement in place , the company must cease shipping operations immediately , state and local officials said . Meanwhile , Chevron has applied for an emergency permit to continue using tankers because the Jan . 17 earthquake damaged a portion of a pipeline used to transport about half of the crude produced at the company ' s Point Arguello fields . The oil_company normally moves about 40 # 000 barrels of oil a day on that Four Corners pipeline , which runs from northern Santa Barbara County to Bakersfield and then on to Los Angeles refineries . With the damage , Chevron has been forced to reroute the oil , slow production and place excess crude_oil in storage_tanks , company officials said . Chevron ' s failure to sign a pipeline agreement also threatens its right to use the marine terminal at Gaviota for loading tankers . * State Lands Commission officials said Monday that its lease agreement with Chevron for use of the offshore terminal was also contingent upon the company finalizing a pipeline agreement by today . &quot; After midnight tonight , Chevron must stop tankering , &quot; Jim Trout , assistant executive_officer of the State Lands Commission , said Monday . &quot; So far , we have not officially heard from the company . And at this point , it would be very hard for this agency to justify this situation as an emergency. &quot; Chevron spokesman G . Michael Marcy said the company was unsuccessful in its efforts to reach a deal with Huntington Beach-based Cajon Pipeline Co. , which will soon start construction of a pipeline from the Barstow area to Los Angeles . Negotiations with the company broke_off in late December . Marcy said Chevron backed_out of the deal because the two companies could not agree to terms and the oil_company did not like the route of the proposed pipeline . Chevron officials instead have opted to pursue development of the Pacific Pipeline , an oil conduit that is proposed to run directly south from Kern County to the company ' s Los Angeles-area refineries . &quot; The Cajon pipeline is not as commercially viable as we would like , &quot; Marcy said . &quot; We had high hopes that we would reach a deal , but in the end could not agree . that ' s business . We ' re not going_to be pushed into a deal just because ( Cajon officials ) may have their construction permits in hand. &quot; Early Monday morning , the Chevron tanker Oregon eased away from its moorings at Gaviota loaded with an estimated 250 # 000 barrels of oil and headed south toward Los Angeles . It could be the company ' s last tanker load unless Santa Barbara County officials approve the company ' s request for an emergency shipping permit . Monday ' s voyage was Chevron ' s 17th since getting the permit in January , 1993 , from the Coastal Commission following a bruising 10-year battle with county and state regulators and local environmentalists . Chevron and its partners have sunk an estimated $ 2.6 billion into the Point Arguello project . The offshore field contains an estimated 300 million to 600 million barrels of oil . &quot; We have to accept our bitter medicine on this one , &quot; Marcy said . &quot; Obviously , we are not going_to meet our deadline and tankering operations will cease effective Feb . 1. &quot; * Bill Douros , deputy director of the energy division for Santa Barbara County , said county officials are considering Chevron ' s emergency shipping request . He said a decision may be reached as early as Wednesday . Chevron asked the county to allow it to use tankers to ship up_to 40 # 000 barrels of oil a day until the Four Corners pipeline is repaired . &quot; We are looking over their request and considering whether or not an emergency truly exists , &quot; Douros said . &quot; We want to determine the exact extent of the damages to the line and find_out when it is expected to be back on line. &quot; Officials are also investigating Chevron and its corporate partners ' ability to store oil until the Four Corners pipeline resumes operation . The companies involved in the Point Arguello project now can store about 800 # 000 barrels of crude . About 80 # 000 barrels a day is produced from the facility . But Linda Krop , an attorney with the Santa Barbara-based Environmental Defense Center , said Chevron ' s request for an emergency shipping permit and the company ' s inability to secure a deal with a pipeline_company were examples of its intent to continue to rely_upon tanker shipping instead of pipelines . &quot; It ' s our belief that Chevron never intended to use the Cajon line and in fact hoped to use a failed deal with them as a reason for the Coastal Commission to grant an extension on their tankering permit , &quot; Krop said . &quot; We hope that when officials examine the situation , Chevron ' s plans will backfire. &quot; Krop discounted Chevron ' s suggestion that the Four Corners pipeline system was so seriously damaged as_to prevent Chevron ' s use . Even if the pipeline is inoperative , Chevron ' s own oil storage units and the temporary use of other pipelines could be substituted until repairs on the Four Corners lines are completed , she said .</TEXT>
