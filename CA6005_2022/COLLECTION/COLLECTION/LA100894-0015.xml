   <HEADLINE> ARMS TRADING ; S . AFRICA FIRM UNDER THE GUN TO EXPLAIN WAYWARD WEAPONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An aging Danish freighter , now anchored off Port Elizabeth , is an unseemly reminder of this nation ' s unsavory past -- and uncertain future -- in the shadowy world of international arms trading . Aboard the Arktis Pioneer are enough guns to equip a fair-sized army -- almost 25 # 000 AK-47 and G-3 assault_rifles , plus 14 million rounds of ammunition . But controversy rides with them . The rifles were bought from Armscor , South_Africa ' s state-owned weapons broker , by a Lebanese middleman named Eli Wazen . Armscor says Wazen provided an end-user certificate , the required international document , showing that the guns were for the government of Lebanon . The ship sailed for Beirut on Aug . 25 . But in a still-unfolding scandal , the vessel instead went_to Hodeida , a Red Seaport in war-torn Yemen . Press reports suggesting that South_Africa ' s new government would fuelarmed conflicts in Africa , not to mention violate an international arms embargo against Yemen , have created huge embarrassment here as President Nelson Mandela completes his state visit to Washington . Armscor officials claim that they were conned . Wazen faked the certificate , they insist , and now has dropped from sight . The Justice_Department has begun to investigate . For now , there are more questions than answers . It ' s unclear why the ship did not off-load in Yemen , for example , or what will happen to the cargo now . The intended recipient of the guns has not been identified . Armscor has denied press reports that the cache was meant for Jonas Savimbi ' s rebel UNITA forces in Angola . That too would violate a United Nations arms embargo . And perhaps most important , it is not clear if Armscor was duped for the first time , as officials insist , or whether it was simply the first time the company ' s long-covert business practices were exposed . After all , until the last U.N. sanctions against the old apartheid regime were lifted in May , all_of Armscor ' s foreign trade violated international_law . The United States retains an arms embargo because Armscor and two former subsidiaries are under a 1991 federal indictment in Philadelphia for allegedly smuggling banned military components to South_Africa and Iraq . Experts say the errant arms shipment simply reflects Armscor ' s long tradition of subterfuge and deception . &quot; This is one of the old-type Armscor transactions , &quot; said Bill Sass , a retired brigadier who is now senior researcher at the independent Institute for Defense_Policy . &quot; A year or so ago , this was how they did most of their business. &quot; Armscor spokesman Don Henning doesn ' t deny it . &quot; Up until May , we were never in the position to demand end-user certificates , &quot; he said . Armscor ' s dirty side was never very secret . Under apartheid , they armed the police who brutalized black townships , helped the government develop a nuclear_weapon and sold arms to renegade states such_as Iraq , Libya and Sudan . Despite sanctions , Armscor boasted that it was South_Africa ' s largest exporter of manufactured products and the world ' s 10th-largest arms dealer . But since then , Armscor has desperately tried to fend_off critics who say the new government should not sell arms and should divert military spending to hospitals , schools and other social programs . With exports last year of about $ 250 million , South_Africa controls about 0.5 % of the world arms trade . Armscor aims to double exports this year , and double them again next year . But officials fear that the current uproar has hurt Armscor ' s image . &quot; We believe it ' s had a very negative impact on us , &quot; Henning said . &quot; We lost credibility. &quot; Sass said he doesn ' t fear for Africa ' s strongest weapons industry , however . &quot; Wars may come , and empires may change , but arms companies go_on forever , &quot; he said with a laugh .</TEXT>
