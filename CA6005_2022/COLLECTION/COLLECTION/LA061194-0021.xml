   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO PUSH FOR PHASED SANCTIONS ON N . KOREA ; DIPLOMACY : U.N. WILL BE ASKED NEXT WEEK TO APPROVE CURBS ENDING IN A FULL EMBARGO IF PYONGYANG REFUSES TO ALLOW NUCLEAR INSPECTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration said Friday that it will formally ask the U.N. Security_Council next week to impose &quot; phased &quot; economic sanctions on North_Korea , ending in a full embargo -- and possibly a naval_blockade -- if Pyongyang does not respond . U.S. officials said the draft resolution , expected on Tuesday , reflects an increasing receptivity by key members of the council -- including Russia and , to some degree , China -- after Pyongyang ' s continuing refusal to allow international inspection of its nuclear facilities . Diplomats said the 15-member body could vote on a sanctions resolution by the end of the month -- relatively quickly by U.N. standards . Presumably , any embargo would take_effect within a matter of days thereafter . The firm move by the United States , which follows a week of preliminary discussions with South_Korea , Japan and members of the Security_Council , marks the first_step toward formal disposition of the North_Korean dispute -- or possible military conflict , if Pyongyang chooses . President Clinton met for an hour with his top national security advisers Friday to discuss the North_Korean situation . The policy-makers met separately for three hours to hammer_out details of the Administration strategy . The U.S. intention was announced in Istanbul , Turkey , by Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , who immediately flew home from a North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization meeting to help plan the U.S. moves . &quot; It ' s time to move forward with the resolution , &quot; he told reporters . Although details of the U.S. proposal were still not firm , officials said it is expected to provide_for a &quot; phased &quot; approach , calling_for imposition of only modest economic restrictions at first , to be followed by a full embargo . At least one official indicated that the sanctions might be enforced by a multinational naval_blockade that would include U.S. warships . There also could be extensive surveillance of shipping traffic in the area by U.S. radar aircraft . U.S. officials said Russia now seems likely to support the general plan . They expressed hope that China will abstain -- or at least refrain_from vetoing the resolution -- despite its current public stance arguing that the United Nations should try more negotiations first . The officials also said Japan and South_Korea both are fully behind the plan . The U.S. assessment appeared to be supported by a series of developments : * In a move clearly designed to cement Moscow ' s backing for the sanctions resolution , Christopher said Friday that the Administration will support a Russian proposal to call an international conference to discuss the North_Korean situation . But officials here cautioned that , while the U.S. proposal will voice Washington ' s support for the idea of a conference , it will continue to press for passage of the sanctions resolution before such a meeting . * In Vienna , the International Atomic Energy Agency , which oversees the nuclear inspection process , voted to withhold technical aid from North_Korea because of its recalcitrance -- and China abstained_from the vote . Diplomats read the development as a signal that Beijing may be softening its opposition to sanctions , at least enough to agree not to veto the U.S.-backed sanctions resolution when it comes_before the Security_Council . * In response to the vote_in Vienna , Pyongyang quickly renounced its obligations to cooperate with inspectors and expelled two international observers . This action , analysts suggested , could heighten support in the United Nations for a sanctions resolution . Immediately after the White_House meeting , top U.S. officials intensified diplomatic efforts to win support for the sanctions resolution , telephoning their counterparts in other countries . Meanwhile , Peter Tarnoff , undersecretary of state for political affairs , arrived in South_Korea to confer_with leaders there . There still was no word whether he will also travel_to Beijing . The Administration ' s new push_on sanctions was accompanied by signs that it is beginning to bolster U.S. military readiness in the face of Pyongyang ' s threats that an embargo might bring_on a new war . Although officials said the Pentagon has not ordered more ships or troops into the region , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry has ordered the aircraft_carrier Independence to remain within three sailing days of Korea , rather than steaming to Hawaii for an exercise . Also Friday , former President Jimmy_Carter conferred_with White_House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake . Carter plans a trip next week to confer_with leaders of North and South_Korea . He was invited initially by North_Korea -- possibly because the Communist regime there is looking_for a face-saving way to defuse the standoff , U.S. officials said . The dispute between the allies and North_Korea involves Pyongyang ' s refusal to permit international inspection teams to monitor and take samplings from its nuclear_reactor at Yongbyon so the country ' s claim that it has no nuclear_weapons can be verified . Although Pyongyang denies that it has any nuclear_warheads , the CIA estimates that North_Korea already has manufactured enough weapons-grade plutonium to make one or two nuclear bombs .
