   <HEADLINE> AFL-CIO TO FIGHT RENEWAL OF CHINA TRADE BENEFITS ; LABOR : LANE KIRKLAND SAYS UNION WILL BACK REVOCATION OF BEIJING ' S MOST-FAVORED-NATION STATUS . STATEMENT COMPLICATES ADMINISTRATION ' S DILEMMA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a serious new complication for the Clinton_Administration ' s China policy , AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland indicated Wednesday that organized labor will strongly oppose renewal of the Beijing regime ' s preferred trade benefits when they expire this summer . The Administration needs the support of organized labor to win enactment of its health_care plan and other elements of its domestic agenda . As a result , the White_House may be reluctant to run_afoul of the AFL-CIO on China policy , as it did last year when President Clinton lobbied hard for support of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . &quot; We are losing jobs to China , &quot; Kirkland said at a news_conference . The $ 20-billion-a-year U.S. deficit in trade with China &quot; is a measure of the dimensions of that , &quot; he said . &quot; But jobs is not the touchstone issue in itself . The issue with us is how our brothers and sisters in China who work for a living are treated. &quot; The statement by organized labor was the second development in the last two weeks that appears to make_it more difficult for China to win an unconditional extension of its most-favored-nation trade benefits . Last week , Chinese authorities rounded_up some prominent dissidents , thus undercutting arguments that the human_rights climate inside China is improving . Over the last two weeks , the Administration has been quietly studying four or five options on trade benefits for China next year . They range from wholesale renewal or revocation of the trade privileges to a possible intermediate step , in which the benefits would be preserved for private enterprises but ended for products of Chinese state enterprises . Any country with most-favored-nation trade status is entitled to export its goods into the United States under the same low tariff rates as other countries with MFN status . China , which has had these benefits since 1980 , now exports more_than $ 30 billion a year in goods to the United States . The Beijing government has said that if China loses the benefits , it will retaliate against American companies that sell to China or do business there . As a result , many U.S. firms have warned that cutting_off China ' s trade privileges could , in the end , lead to a loss of jobs for American workers . On Wednesday , Kirkland -- whose influence in Washington was demonstrated when he was seated next to First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton at the President ' s State of the Union address -- angrily denounced the American business_community for making these claims about China . &quot; I do not believe that American corporations give a tinker ' s damn about jobs in the United States , and any representations they make about their deep and dying concerns over American jobs ought to be taken with a ton of salt , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s quite clear that the soft underbelly of freedom , American corporate enterprise , is doing its level_best to serve the interests of the dictators and the totalitarian regime in China . . . . There are lobbyists lobbying hard on China ' s behalf for the sake of_their_own narrow pocketbook interests and for the right to continue to abuse and exploit labor. &quot; Since China ' s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators at Tian An Men Square , the AFL-CIO has been increasingly active in China policy . Organized labor opposed the George_Bush Administration ' s efforts to reconcile with Beijing , and it has helped support those dissidents trying to organize Chinese workers . On Wednesday , Kirkland made_it plain that labor ' s opposition to MFN renewal for China this year will go beyond its past efforts . &quot; We intend to participate aggressively in that debate &quot; over China ' s trade benefits , he said . He maintained that China &quot; has not met the most minimum conditions for satisfying the requirements of the granting of MFN treatment to their country. &quot; Last year , Clinton imposed a series of specific human_rights conditions that China must satisfy before Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher will recommend renewal of MFN status . These conditions cover issues such_as the use of forced labor in Chinese prisons , jamming of Voice of America radio_broadcasts , release of political_prisoners and China ' s treatment of Tibet . Clinton must decide by June 3 whether to renew China ' s trade benefits for another year . At the same time , he must decide what the rules should be for any further extensions of MFN status next year .</TEXT>
