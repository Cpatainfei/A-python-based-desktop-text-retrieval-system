   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; DISAPPOINTING END FOR U.S. MOGUL SKIER ; FREESTYLE : DEFENDING CHAMPION WEINBRECHT IS SEVENTH . TEAMMATE MCINTYRE WINS SILVER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wednesday ' s mogul final at the Kanthaugen Freestyle Arena was as much about the loser as the winner , as much about seventh place as first . It was about Donna Weinbrecht , the Bambino of Bumps , defending Olympic champion , the winner of 30 World Cup races . The best mogul skier ever . Weinbrecht has been_on the podium so many times she didn ' t know how to react to seventh place . Where should she stand ? Were there parting gifts ? &quot; I have never been down that far before , &quot; she said . Weinbrecht , inexperienced in such things , was gracious enough in defeat . Stine Lise Hattestad , who , like the rest , had long skied in Weinbrecht ' s shadow , at last could bask as she claimed the gold medal on home snow , as jubilant Norwegians waved flags and sang choruses of their anthem , &quot; Victory Is Ours. &quot; Hattestad claimed the gold with a winning score of 25.97 , enough to defeat Liz McIntyre , the American veteran who managed to wait out Weinbrecht long enough to earn the silver . Russia ' s Elizaveta Kojevnikova , who finished second to Weinbrecht at Albertville , earned the bronze . Sensing it might never get any better , Hattestad announced her retirement afterward . Defeating Weinbrecht brought bewilderment . &quot; I don ' t think I quite understand what I ' ve done yet , &quot; Hattestad said . Added McIntyre : &quot; I don ' t think it ' s really hit me. &quot; For McIntyre , a Dartmouth graduate , skiing behind Weinbrecht certainly has been an education . In seven years on the U.S. team , McIntyre has won two World Cup events . Twenty-eight fewer than Weinbrecht . Yet , when it counted , it was McIntyre who raced like a champion . There was some argument , in fact , whether hers was the gold-medal run . &quot; I was very well prepared , &quot; McIntyre said . &quot; I had a lot of fun . I ' m a happy camper in Norway . I tried to stay pretty calm about the whole_thing and treat it like a World Cup . The fact I ' m at the Olympics really hasn ' t crossed my mind yet . I think tomorrow I ' ll start enjoying the Olympics. &quot; Weinbrecht , on a comeback quest to defend her Olympic gold after tearing knee ligaments in 1992 , was not her usual self , despite winning the first six World Cup competitions this season . A week before the Olympics , Hattestad defeated her at a World Cup event at Salen , Sweden . Tuesday , in the elimination round , Weinbrecht bobbled after one of her jumps and finished sixth . Although first-day scores don ' t carry_over , the starting order for finals is arranged in reverse order , from worst to best . It is generally agreed that impressing the judges is more difficult from the middle of the pack . Not that Weinbrecht deserved to win . She said she felt numb in the starting_gate , &quot; like an out-of-body experience. &quot; Weinbrecht clearly had been spooked by Tuesday ' s error . Later that night , in her room , she cried . &quot; I got_up in the middle of the night and I kept seeing the mistake I made , &quot; she said . &quot; I kept playing that over and over in my head. &quot; She can admit now that standing in the starting_gate has been hell all season with those doubts in her head and that heavy brace protecting her right knee . Even as she was winning World Cup races , Weinbrecht would call her mother and say , &quot; Pray for me . I can ' t do_it . I can ' t get_down the course. &quot; Weinbrecht was losing her mental edge . Maybe it was the injury . Or indifference . Yet , she wanted to see the comeback through . &quot; I think I ' d regret it more if I was_on the couch watching the Olympics , &quot; she said . At 28 , there are no more moguls left to conquer , though . Retirement appears imminent . &quot; I feel_like that right now , &quot; Weinbrecht said . &quot; I gave it my best shot. &quot; Before , her best shot was enough . &quot; I have to be very thankful for all_the accomplishments I ' ve had , &quot; she said . &quot; I have a gold medal and I ' ve been a champion . It ' s all_right . I wish things could have gone better . But it just didn ' t happen and I ' ve got_to be a champion without the gold. &quot; Later , surrounded by her family in the freestyle coral , Weinbrecht thanked supporters who made the trip . She hugged her parents . &quot; I don ' t want you to be disappointed , &quot; said her mother , Caroline . &quot; I thought you did great. &quot; Despite the loss , Weinbrecht was elated for McIntyre , calling her performance &quot; awesome. &quot; Weinbrecht said she thought McIntrye had won . As for the U.S. men , Troy Benson , who made the Olympic team only because of an injury to a teammate , finished eighth in the finals . &quot; that ' s all I could have really hoped for , &quot; he said . &quot; I was right where I deserved to be. &quot; American Sean Smith finished 13th in the event , won by Canada ' s Jean-Luc Brassard . Serguei Shoupletsov of Russia took the silver , with Edgar Grospiron of France winning the bronze . Benson had mixed feelings about the day . His own joy and elation for McIntyre was tempered by Weinbrecht ' s finish . &quot; You know , &quot; Benson said , &quot; sometimes somebody has to step_down before somebody else can step up. &quot;</TEXT>
