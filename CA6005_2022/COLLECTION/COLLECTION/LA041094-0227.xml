   <TEXT> There are floating islands in Louisiana -- islands where herons nest in the branches of myrtle trees , alligators cruise beneath the roots and slow ripples spread_out with every step you take . The mat of leaves , stems , and roots sinks beneath your feet and rises again behind you . But now these floating masses of vegetation are in danger , all because of the insatiable appetite of a strange critter called variously the rat beaver , the coypu or the nutria . It is a snub-nosed , slow-moving beast with webbed feet , scraggly fur , a naked , rat-like tail , and inch-long , orange buckteeth . Unlike rats , nutria average 15 pounds , have plush , velvety pelts beneath their scraggly guard_hairs , and are vegetarian . But their diet is a danger to the marsh . They have gnawed some areas down to circles of mud hundreds of acres across , said Greg Linscombe , a biologist with the state_Department of Wildlife and Fisheries . They stymied a study to see if cypress plantings could reduce marsh erosion by gobbling all 100 seedlings within a_few days . &quot; There are some areas where you can go_out and see literally hundreds of animals , &quot; Linscombe said . &quot; It looks_like a big pasture , except the whole_thing is floating . And as far as you can see on the horizon , you see nutria. &quot; But , he said , it is almost impossible to measure overall nutria damage in the masses of vegetation known as &quot; flotants &quot; in French or , in English , &quot; floats. &quot; &quot; These floats are moving_around . You almost have to do aerial photographs and measure land-water ratios over time to see if there is more water and less land , &quot; Linscombe said . Louisiana State University ecologist Charles Sasser is leading a small-scale study . Last summer he and a team of researchers caged_in small areas of the flotant to keep nutria out , and will measure the plants inside and outside the barriers next spring . The enclosed plants were already visibly taller in the fall , he said . A similar study on ordinary marshland wound_up with vast mud_flats surrounding small enclosed stands of high marsh grass . The nutria problem has its origins in Scandinavia where an overabundance of farmed minks reduced the demand for nutria pelts . A few cold winters in Europe might be enough to control the mink competition , at least for a while . From about 20 years starting in 1962 , more_than 1 million nutria pelts a year were harvested in Louisiana -- 1.7 million one year in the late ' 70s , Linscombe said . &quot; During that entire time , you didn ' t hear anything about marsh damage from nutria , &quot; Linscombe said . &quot; You didn ' t hear anything until ' 85- ' 86 , &quot; Linscombe said . Then , he said , the nutria market plummeted . The main reasons were a fashion change from fur to leather , combined with seven very mild winters in northern_Europe , and overproduction of ranch mink that made mink as cheap or cheaper than nutria , he said . Some people put much of the blame on anti-fur protests by animal-rights activists . Linscombe said that may have played a part but was not a major factor . About 6 # 000 to 7 # 000 trappers had to look_for other income . The number of nutria trapped for their fur dropped to a_couple_of hundred_thousand a year , he said . &quot; It looked_like once we got below 500 # 000 to 600 # 000 , we started seeing damage , and having damage reported by land companies , &quot; he said . Nutria are known as coypu in South_America , their original habitat . But when the conquistadors saw them , they mistook them for otter and called them nutria -- Spanish for otter . They also have been called the South_American beaver , but are really their own kind of animal . Their scientific name , Myocastor coypus , reflects the similarity to beaver , which has the scientific genus_Castor . Tabasco creator E . A . McIlhenny brought nutria to Louisiana in 1937 . He figured they could be farmed for their pelts . It was a reasonable idea -- nutria are farmed today in Europe . The pelts are used for both felt and fur and the meat , called ragondin , is sold as a delicacy . Removing the guard_hairs , either by cutting or pulling them out , leaves a rich , velvety pelt . It is used more often as a lining than as an outer fur for coats . &quot; They were raised in tremendous numbers at one time in Poland -- more mutation colors -- whites , blacks , gun-metal gray , &quot; Linscombe said . McIlhenny ' s plans went awry in the floods of ' 39 and ' 40 . Nutria swam out of their pens and into the swamps . Their only predator there is the alligator and , because one female nutria can bear six to eight litters a year , they were fruitful beyond all imagining . Within two years , they had spread to Texas and Mississippi . More recently , they have been seen as far north as Virginia and the Midwest . &quot; The nutria denudes the marsh down to the soil , which is organic in nature . That may be just enough that the marsh cannot recover , &quot; Linscombe said . &quot; It ' s an added factor that aggravates these other , more serious , conditions and may make the difference between the marsh continuing to be marsh or turning_to open water. &quot; The state is looking_at several ways to deal with the problem and the attendant coastal erosion . Linscombe has traveled around North_America and to Europe and the Far East to drum_up interest in Louisiana furs . The Department of Wildlife and Fisheries is also trying to drum_up interest in nutria meat with a Nutria Fest at the Louisiana Nature and Science Center in New Orleans . The first Nutria Fest , last fall , attracted a_few hundred people and a score of chefs with a nutria cooking contest judged by Paul Prudhomme . It was hard to tell what the meat would taste like on its own , but many of the recipes were tasty enough to those who were willing to eat them . Others , like one veteran who had too many close encounters with rats in Vietnam , found themselves queasy at the thought of eating nutria , even though the Nature Center staff stressed that the critters are closer kin to the guinea_pig than to the rat . Some sort of bounty will be needed to encourage trapping , at least at first , Linscombe said . &quot; We have examined a lot of alternatives . We haven ' t found any . We know what works , because it worked in the ' 60s . If you have 5 # 000 or 6 # 000 people out there and they have a reason to trap the nutria , your problem is eliminated. &quot;</TEXT>
