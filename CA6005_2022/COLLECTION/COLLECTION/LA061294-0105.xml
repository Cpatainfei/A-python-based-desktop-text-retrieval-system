   <HEADLINE> NORTH NOMINATION INCREASES ODDS OF GOP FRATRICIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A funny thing happened to the Republicans on their way to riding America ' s disappointment with Bill_Clinton back to national political dominance . The GOP ' s own fratricide has gone_into overdrive -- led by Oliver L . North , the famous Marine lieutenant_colonel turned Washington-basher , hero of the Christian right and devil figure of the GOP Establishment . His U.S. Senate nomination in Virginia , attained last week-end , is a political hand_grenade that threatens to blow_out one side of the Grand Old Party ' s &quot; big tent. &quot; And not just in Virginia , but nationally . In part , that ' s because North ' s chief backers , the religious right , may be past their peak in national support , but they ' re still increasing their clout in the GOP . Party leaders worry that the controversy over North could provoke another crippling backlash like the one produced by the 1992 convention -- or , alternatively , seed a religious-right third-party bolt , which could also be fatal . Democrats , meanwhile , are not in any position to laugh . Midterm congressional elections , like those in November , are usually a referendum on the party in the White_House -- so Republicans could gain three or four Senate seats and 18 to 25 House seats , putting them just shy of control . This means , in 1995-96 , an already weakened Clinton would confront the largest GOP opposition that a Democratic President has faced since 1951-52 . Any North or religious-right embarrassment to the GOP won ' t outweigh Whitewater or Paula Corbin Jones . The GOP ' s problem is that a 1994 midterm success doesn ' t ensure any similar prospect for 1996 . If anything , increased GOP numbers on Capitol_Hill may only focus attention on party political divisions and the cultural tensions between well-heeled pin-stripers who want a 1996 convention city with good hotels and clubs and religious fundamentalist forces more concerned about sermons and trailer hookups . North ' s Senate_race could also reveal declining political loyalty to both major parties . Despite his ability to win at a Virginia party convention dominated by rural , small-town and churchgoing supporters , North ' s controversial 1989 conviction for lying to Congress ( later set_aside ) blocks him from ever expecting a majority of the vote . Normally , such weakness would reelect the Democratic incumbent . But Charles S . Robb has also lost credibility because of scandal . So outgoing Democratic governor , L . Douglas Wilder , throwing party loyalty to the winds , has decided to run as an independent . J . Marshall Coleman , a former GOP gubernatorial nominee with ties to moderates , is also moving toward an independent candidacy . Such fragmentation could be unprecedented . I cannot remember any Senate_race where both parties split , with factions of each deciding to mount independent candidacies . True , Virginia may_not be typical -- one senator , Harry F . Byrd Jr. , was elected as an independent in 1970 -- but this double breakdown of party loyalty may be prophetic nationally . For example , Jesse Jackson ' s current refusal to rule_out an independent presidential bid in 1996 adds_to Wilder ' s demonstration that African Americans are losing their traditional commitment to the Democrats . Meanwhile , the GOP ' s dilemma in keeping its moderates in harness with religious conservatives , populists and nationalists goes_far beyond North . Americans , as_a_whole , continue to tell pollsters what they started saying during the 1992 Ross Perot hubbub -- this country needs a new third_party . The GOP ' s problem , of course , is that keeping its preachers and populists in a common formation with its financial , corporate and lobbying insiders is a high-wire act . The GOP was shaken by related tremors in 1988 and 1992 : first , when religious broadcaster Pat Robertson sought the presidential nomination ; then , four years later , with Patrick J . Buchanan ' s primary challenge to George_Bush , and then by Perot ' s ability to draw_off a fatal number of predominantly Republican voters in the general_election . Not surprisingly , intra-GOP divisions have worsened since Bush left the White_House -- just as the fissures within the Democratic Party widened after it lost power in 1968 . The key is if the GOP ' s religious right feels taken_for granted , much as the Democrats ' racial , ethnic and cultural minorities did back in the 1960s and 1970s -- both groups neglected by a party Establishment eager for their votes , but even more worried about a backlash from too close an identification . The last few years have made religious-right strategists shrewder . They won ' t try again for the party presidential nomination . Instead , they ' re digging in at the grass-roots level , taking_over school_boards and local GOP organizations and dropping hints that if their agendas are ignored , Christian conservatives could go_for an independent movement in 1996 . Whether North wins or loses , his 1994 Senate bid has to be seen as a strategic litmus . The Republicans won Virginia ' s 1993 statewide elections , aided by about 75 % support from the state ' s population of white , Christian churchgoers . But there was one conspicuous failure . The party candidate for lieutenant_governor , Michael Farris , a religious-right supporter , got only 45 % of the total statewide vote because such Establishment GOP leaders as Sen . John W . Warner refused to support him and implicitly agreed with his characterization as an extremist . This infuriated religious-right leaders . Now , with Warner and other GOP centrists taking the same hostile approach to North , a watershed could be at_hand : Some of these people are not going_to be able to stay in the same tent . For the GOP ' s problem does not end with Virginia . The religious right represents a huge pivotal chunk of the party rank_and_file . Indeed , by some calculations , in 1992 , born-again white Christians cast_about one-third of the national votes for Bush . Fundamentalists alone cast one in five . Like gays and other minorities on the Democratic side , white Christian conservatives are now dedicated to proving their muscle -- most prominently by taking_over Republican_party organizations and conventions in some 15 to 20 different states . These are not just Southern or Bible Belt strongholds like South Carolina , Oklahoma or Virginia . In recent years , the religious right has taken_over the state GOP or parts of it in the Midwest -- including Michigan , Minnesota and Iowa -- and in the Pacific Northwest . The struggle also extends_to some of the biggest states . In Texas , religious conservatives are poised to take_over this month ' s GOP state convention . In Pennsylvania , religious conservatives won 40 % of the state committee posts on the ballot two years ago , and made additional gains in this year ' s balloting . These Texas and Pennsylvania trends aren ' t local minutiae . Equally to_the_point , religious-right voters turn_out with an enthusiasm and commitment that often makes their candidate run ahead of poll indications . But there ' s also a drawback . When the Christian right takes_over state GOP organizations , it scares moderate voters away . The same thing often happens when religious-right stalwarts win party nominations . Even this year , one or two U.S. Senate seats and a half-dozen House seats could be lost that way . If this schism within the GOP turns_into a full-fledged split , it could do as much damage as the Democrats ' division did_in the 1960s and ' 70s . North isn ' t just another candidate . What happens to him this year -- and how the national GOP Establishment deals with him -- will tell us much about both the politics of culture and the future of the Republican_Party in the 1990s . So far , the hand-grenade scenario looks_like an even bet. *</TEXT>
