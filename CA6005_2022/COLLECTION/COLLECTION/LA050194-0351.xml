   <HEADLINE> INDICTMENT BID ROCKS EFFORT TO FORM ITALIAN GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Efforts to form a new government were thrown into turmoil Saturday after prosecutors asked_for the indictments of a key ally of Prime Minister-designate Silvio Berlusconi and 36 others on kickback charges . The Berlusconi ally was Umberto Bossi , leader of the Northern League , part of the three-party conservative coalition that won national elections in March.Northern League members are under_consideration for key Cabinet posts . The request also named some of the nation ' s best-known political figures : former premiers Bettino Craxi and Arnaldo Forlani , former Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis and several former Cabinet_ministers . A hearing on the indictment request was scheduled for May 24 . A magistrate must rule_in favor of the indictment request for the case to move forward . Members_of_Parliament have immunity from prosecution unless it is lifted by Parliament at a court ' s request . Bossi is now a lawmaker . Craxi , Forlani and De Michelis are not . The indictment request is a spinoff of the six-month trial of financier Sergio Cusani , who was convicted on Thursday for his role in kickbacks for a large business merger in 1990 . Craxi and Forlani were among dozens who testified in the trial , which examined the merger and quick breakup of chemical giant Montedison and the state-owned ENI chemical group . Many political and business_leaders profited from the deal . Bossi is accused of receiving $ 125 # 000 , and Craxi allegedly took $ 6.6 million in kickbacks linked to the deal .</TEXT>
