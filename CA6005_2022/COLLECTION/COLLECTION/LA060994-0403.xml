   <HEADLINE> TRINITY BROADCASTING PLANS ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX IN TENNESSEE ; MINISTRY : THE TUSTIN-BASED NETWORK , WHICH WILL BUY TWITTY CITY , SAYS THE 30-ACRE GOSPEL AND COUNTRY_MUSIC FACILITY WILL COST $ 13 MILLION TO CREATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Departing from the conservative fiscal strategy that made_it the world ' s largest religious television programming service , Trinity Broadcasting Network has announced plans to create a 30-acre , $ 13-million gospel and country_music entertainment complex outside Nashville . Paul Crouch , founder and president of the Tustin-based network , says Trinity will purchase Twitty City , owned by the family of the late country singer Conway Twitty . In March , Trinity purchased an adjoining attraction , Music Village , USA , which has been renamed Trinity Music City , USA . Trinity , which is tax-exempt and nonprofit , provides 24-hour-a-day Christian programming to nearly 400 television and radio_stations . Together with his wife , Jan , Paul Crouch hosts a nightly Christian talk and variety_show called &quot; Praise the Lord , &quot; being broadcast this week from Tennessee to inaugurate the new complex . &quot; Jan and I are very excited about this opportunity to expand our production facilities at this location , &quot; Crouch said in a prepared statement . Trinity ' s plans include its own recording_studio and label . &quot; ' Pat Boone ' s Gospel America ' weekly television_show will be produced here , and we will incorporate the entire complex in the production of the show , &quot; Crouch ' s statement said . &quot; Plans are also underway for a country-gospel music awards show to be broadcast from the site , and consideration is being given to utilizing a part of Twitty City to house a country-gospel hall_of_fame , &quot; Crouch said . &quot; Trinity Broadcasting Network is an ideal buyer for the . . . property , as it already owns the adjacent land , Music Village , USA , &quot; said Hugh Carden , president of Conway Twitty Enterprises and co-executor of Twitty ' s estate . &quot; The properties complement each other , and it is fitting the purchase was made by another entertainment entity . Their respect for country_music has been evident during the negotiation process. &quot; Music Village , USA , which occupies 21 acres adjoining Twitty City in Hendersonville , Tenn. , is a country-music performance center that also houses shops and museums featuring various stars . Trinity paid $ 10 million for Music City , according to court records . Trinity ' s offer for Twitty City , which has been mired in litigation since Twitty died a year ago , is $ 2.75 million , according to probate_court documents . * Crouch ' s Washington , D.C. , attorney , Colby M . May , said in an interview that both the Music City and Twitty City purchases &quot; are straight cash transactions. &quot; Twitty City includes the homes of Conway Twitty , his 81-year-old mother and his four children , as well as a theater , gift_shop , landscaped grounds and gardens . The family members will be required to leave their homes on the grounds , according to terms of purchase_agreement . Unlike many other major religious broadcasters in the 1980s and ' 90s , Trinity survived and prospered by avoiding such high-overhead financial drains as large churches , colleges and theme-park resorts . Crouch frequently boasted to viewers that the network , with an estimated market_value of $ 500 million , never borrowed money to buy stations and eschewed high salaries and production frills . According to documents filed with the Internal Revenue Service , Trinity listed net assets of just under $ 100 million . May , Crouch ' s attorney , said that Trinity envisions the new complex as a &quot; vehicle &quot; and a &quot; platform &quot; for using gospel music to &quot; expand the ministry by providing that kind of inspiration to a wider and wider segment of our supporter and viewers . . . . The two facilities are fairly large ( efforts ) in taking this first step. &quot; While May said the complex probably will be the site for large-scale crusades and other outreach events , he cautioned against making too_much of the move . &quot; We ' re not talking_about a Christian theme park , &quot; he said . &quot; This is not going_to be an overnight Hollywood East with big overhead. &quot; Nevertheless , commercials last week on Trinity stations began advertising &quot; Gospel Fanfare &quot; on the grounds of &quot; Trinity Music City &quot; last weekend , inviting people to meet country singer Charlie Daniels , along with the network ' s own entertainers . That event preceded the annual country &quot; Fanfare , &quot; which is taking_place all week in Nashville and is sponsored by the Country_Music Assn. , a convention where fans of recording stars line_up to meet their favorite performers . Trinity ' s move_into the music industry may represent a risk . In 1990 , Trinity announced an ambitious plan to make inspirational movies and established its own film division , Trinity Films , to produce them . Its first effort , &quot; China Cry , &quot; was well-received , but according to documents filed with the IRS , Trinity Films still owes more_than $ 8 million to Trinity Broadcasting Network . Trinity and associated organizations controlled or financed by the network or other Crouch family members own more_than a dozen television_stations in the United States . In addition to flagship KTBN Channel 40 in Orange County , Trinity owns outlets in Miami , Dallas and Atlanta . Trinity has an affiliated station in the area of the new complex , which will move its production studios from Gallatin , Tenn. , the network said , into a structure that is a replica of Thomas_Jefferson ' s Monticello . That station , WPGD , is controlled by Jay Sekulow , a high-profile attorney known for successfully arguing landmark cases on behalf of evangelicals before the U.S. Supreme Court . Sekulow also has his own show on Trinity . Among Trinity ' s liabilities listed with the IRS in 1992 , the last year for which figures are available , was an unsecured loan of $ 1.5 million to Sekulow ' s broadcasting_company , Sonlight . According to its April , 1994 , newsletter , Trinity has 390 owned and affiliated radio and television_stations around the world , &quot; now reaching a potential viewing_audience of 70 million in America. &quot; In the same newsletter , Crouch wrote that , in addition to these over-the-air outlets , &quot; Direct Broadcast Satellite ( DBS ) and the Information Superhighway are coming . The day is fast approaching when we will literally have access to virtually every soul on Planet Earth ! &quot; The Nashville Tennessean contributed to this story .</TEXT>
