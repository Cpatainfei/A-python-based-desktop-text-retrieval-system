   <HEADLINE> AMNESTY : ORGANIZATION OF HOPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Americans take their freedom for granted : They hear a joke about President Clinton and Congress and they laugh . But in many other countries , as Amnesty International , the human_rights watchdog , points_out in its annual report , jokes about national_leaders are no laughing matter . A wrong word about an official can result in prison , or worse . The London-based Amnesty International is an invaluable resource for those who care about human_rights . Though it depends_on the targets of oppressive governments for much of its information , its reports are considered highly credible . Perhaps most significant of all its noteworthy work is the annual report , which proves a general picture of state cruelty and oppression the world over . Some of the worst trouble spots are in the headlines . Haiti , Rwanda and Bosnia-Herzegovina , not surprisingly , made the list of countries where politics motivates killings , torture and imprisonment without benefit of trial . In Haiti , Amnesty depended largely on the neutral reports of observers from the United Nations and the Organization of American_States to document numerous executions of supporters of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . In Rwanda , Amnesty reported &quot; systematic and unprovoked killings of the Tutsi minority , &quot; in the strife that broke_out in April and noted the threat of the massacres spreading to neighboring Burundi . In Bosnia-Herzegovina , politics motivated hundreds of &quot; deliberate and arbitrary killings &quot; according to Amnesty , which attributed blame to &quot; all sides. &quot; Amnesty is particularly valuable because it is even-handed . It notes atrocities of oppression by both right-wing and left-wing regimes . And no region of the world is unblemished , according to Amnesty ' s 1994 survey of 151 countries . Since 1961 , more_than a_million volunteers have worked for Amnesty International , helping in various ways to fight the execution , imprisonment and torture of people solely because of their beliefs , religion , race , gender , ethnic origin or politics . This Amnesty army is essential . If such evils are made known , perhaps they will not go unpunished ; the world will respond with action rather than rhetoric . That at any rate is the hope .</TEXT>
