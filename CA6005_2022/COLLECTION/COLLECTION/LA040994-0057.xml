   <HEADLINE> LATIN_AMERICA ; BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES LINK LOTTERY TO POLITICAL CORRUPTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Late last month , on a tip from a prisoner , Brazilian federal prosecutor Antonio Carlos Biscaia led police investigators to a handsome mansion tucked_away in Bangu , a poor suburb west of downtown Rio . There they found a small arsenal of guns and ammunition , video poker machines and five sealed jeweler ' s vaults . Then they stumbled on a wealth of incriminating documents , including some 50 log books and more_than 100 computer diskettes . Biscaia and his team concluded that the house was headquarters for an illegal lottery known as the jogo do bicho , the animal game . Moreover , he claimed , the cache and paper trail were proof of what had long been whispered here : that the animal lottery was a thin front for a vast underworld of crime including drug trafficking , arms running and money_laundering . Worse , he concluded , leading Brazilians not only knew about the misdeeds but profited directly from them . Authorities also linked the Rio crime bosses to the international drug trade , tracing regular_payments from the animal game to Cali , Colombia , home of the world ' s biggest cocaine ring . &quot; We are sure we will be able to prove that the money was used to finance drug trafficking , &quot; Biscaia told reporters . The headlines that trumpeted the scandal shocked but did not surprise many Brazilians , who have seen plenty of thieving by public officials in recent times . In 1992 , President Fernando Collor de Mello was caught with his hand in the public till and came tumbling down in an impeachment trial . The next year , senior members of the Congress were found to have helped themselves to about $ 100 million of the federal budget . The latest scandal threatened even wider damage . The prosecutor had dared to shake the rug where this city ' s underworld had long treaded , exposing a parquetry of crime that extended from Rio ' s ragged shantytowns to the stately chambers of the federal_courts and the National Congress . Biscaia turned_up a log book registering regular payoffs from the bicheiros , or lottery dons , to more_than 100 people , including figures as high up as Collor and as unlikely as Herbert de Souza , a sociologist widely hailed for his courageous fight against hunger , unemployment and AIDS . Souza admitted that taking the money -- for an AIDS prevention campaign -- was a &quot; political error. &quot; Payoffs also went_to Rio ' s mayor , Cesar Maia , said to have received $ 100 # 000 during his 1992 campaign for office , and to Rio state Gov . Nilo Batista , who confirmed that he negotiated a $ 58 # 000 donation from the lottery to Souza ' s AIDS group when he was lieutenant_governor . Congressmen , judges and prosecutors were also on the lists , along with former federal police Supt . Edson de Oliveira -- the man who arrested Paulo Cesar Farias , Collor ' s former campaign treasurer and alleged partner_in_crime . Biscaia allowed that some politicians , such_as Maia , may_not have known of campaign donations taken_in their names by aides . But he was unsparing with the civil police , the investigating arm of the state police . The civil police corps is &quot; permeated by corruption , &quot; he told reporters in Rio . The Rio state secretary of police , Jorge Mario Gomes , also named in the payoffs , resigned last week . The animal lottery , dating to the late 1800s , was a favorite pastime for millions of Brazilians . The bicheiros were tolerated and even revered for their charitable works . Increasingly , however , authorities suspected the bicheiros of involvement in more nefarious activities . Last year , state Judge Denise Frossard sentenced 14 of them to jail for conspiracy to commit a crime and maintaining armed bands . But until the recent raid , there was no solid proof of more serious crimes . Police got their tip after a longtime bookie for Castor de Andrade , a leading bicheiro , decided to become an informant . When the bicheiro ' s son-in-law was arrested for bribing a police_officer with a suitcase of money months before , Andrade had fingered his bookie as the bagman .</TEXT>
