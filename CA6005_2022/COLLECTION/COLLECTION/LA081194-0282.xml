   <HEADLINE> 3 DOCTORS CITED IN TAYLOR DRUG CASE ; MEDICINE : THE PHYSICIANS RECEIVE REPRIMANDS FOR PRESCRIBING EXCESSIVE MEDICATION TO TREAT THE ACTRESS ' S PAIN . THEIR ATTORNEYS SAY THE DECISION IS AN EXONERATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three prominent Los Angeles physicians have been reprimanded by the Medical Board of California for falsifying patient records to cover_up the massive amounts of addictive drugs they prescribed to actress Elizabeth Taylor . The actions , yet to be publicly released , bring_to a close the accusations filed against the doctors in 1990 by the attorney_general ' s office , alleging that the physicians prescribed excessive doses of painkillers to Taylor during the 1980s . But even as the_matter was brought_to a close by the medical board , the settlement reignited a long-simmering controversy over the state ' s disciplinary system for doctors . Attorneys for the doctors said the reprimand amounted to an exoneration of three dedicated physicians who were trying to control Taylor ' s pain and kept inaccurate medical_records only to protect the actress from the prying eyes of reporters for tabloids such_as the National Enquirer . Harland Braun , attorney for Dr. Michael S . Gottlieb , said : &quot; This letter ( of reprimand ) says nothing . It ' s an administrative fig_leaf covering the board ' s private parts . . . . It ought to be labeled a letter of apology. &quot; A public interest watchdog group in San Diego questioned whether the reprimand , which is intended for minor infractions , was an appropriate sanction . Medical board officials said the action was appropriate and avoided the &quot; circus &quot; atmosphere of formal proceedings . Initially , medical board officials had pressed to suspend or revoke the doctors ' licenses . They had rejected as too lenient an offer by the doctors to go_on probation and perform community service . Then , executive_director Dixon Arnett decided last month to mete_out the mildest punishment possible . The decision comes as the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has initiated legal_action to determine whether to revoke the authority of two of the doctors to handle controlled substances . The DEA action against Gottlieb has been dropped . Gottlieb , of Sherman Oaks , is the immunologist who reported the first_AIDS case in the United States . The case also involves his former partner , Dr. Michael J . Roth , and Dr. William F . Skinner , who served until recently as the director of the chemical dependency unit at St . John ' s Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica . &quot; These are three doctors that have a tremendous reputation in the community and a great background , &quot; said Donald Goldman , Skinner ' s attorney . In addition to her doctor-patient relationship , Taylor shared with Roth and Gottlieb a dedication to the AIDS movement . The actress was not identified in the reprimand or the accusation , but her name was revealed during legal discovery . Her case was brought_to the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office in the late 1980s by officials of a detoxification center where she sought treatment . After an 18-month inquiry , the district_attorney declined to press criminal charges but issued a report in April , 1990 , stating that &quot; the prescribing practices of these physicians fell below the accepted standard of medical practice. &quot; Several months later , the attorney_general ' s office filed a formal accusation charging that the doctors had written Taylor more_than 1 # 000 prescriptions during a five-year period dating_back to 1983 for 28 controlled substances , including sleeping pills , painkillers and tranquilizers . The charges , totaling about 80 pages , include an exhaustive list of drugs prescribed in various combinations , both by tablet and by self-injection . Deputy Atty . Gen . Earl Plowman , who supervised the drafting of the complaint , recalled that when a medical expert first looked_at the case , he assumed that the patient must be dead because &quot; the dosages were incompatible with life. &quot; Plowman recalled : &quot; This was a rather systematic effort by the doctors to keep a patient supplied with drugs . . . . It was a classic case of abuse involving multiple prescriptions , multiple controlled substances at different pharmacies at the same time. &quot; Taylor , who has undergone several spinal surgeries , has a history of back , neck and leg pain . Her publicist in New York said she was unavailable for comment . Attorneys said drug dosages that would be excessive for most people were appropriate to combat Taylor ' s discomfort and allow her to function . &quot; Liz Taylor is a different patient , with intractable , long-term , untreatable pain , &quot; Braun said . &quot; She has no life without painkillers. &quot; He added that the doctors did not accurately record the drugs she was given &quot; to protect her from ending_up in the National Enquirer. &quot; Goldman concurred : &quot; You see what comes_out in the tabloid press these days and you can see very clearly why they ( the doctors ) did it. &quot; By all accounts , this case has taken an inordinately long_time to resolve . The conclusion comes as the board , long criticized for slow and lenient discipline of doctors , is struggling to recover from a 1993 scandal that erupted after disclosures that officials had closed , and shredded , complaints without proper investigation . Since then , the Legislature has given the board additional tools to discipline doctors , including the ability to cite and fine them and to issue reprimands instead of pressing charges for minor infractions . In the case of Taylor ' s doctors , Julianne D ' Angelo , at the Center for Public Interest Law at the University of San Diego , questioned the fundamental legitimacy of the letter of reprimand . She said the board has not yet passed regulations setting_forth the criteria for issuing the reprimands . Furthermore , she said , unless the offense is &quot; a minor unprofessional-conduct violation , &quot; a reprimand is an inappropriate sanction . Without commenting on the final action , Deputy Atty . Gen . Plowman , said : &quot; I certainly would n ' t have called these charges minor. &quot; Arnett , the medical board ' s executive_director , defended the reprimands as appropriate and legally sound . He said the doctors agreed to accept the reprimands as part of the settlement , which is permissible despite the lack of published regulations . He said the reprimand was appropriate , given the difficulty of prevailing in court as well as his desire to avoid the atmosphere of high-profile proceedings . &quot; We decided a stipulation was better than a circus , &quot; Arnett said . The reprimands will have virtually no effect on the doctors ' practices . The letters do not have to be posted in their offices and will not be entered into a national database that tracks disciplinary action against doctors . Attorneys said the reprimands will not jeopardize the doctors ' standing with insurance carriers or their privileges at hospitals . Deputy Atty . Gen . Richard Marino , however , insisted that the reprimands did not exonerate the doctors . He said that &quot; because there is some concern about the amounts of drugs and why they were prescribed in this case , Roth and Skinner will have to pass oral clinical examinations in addiction medicine before his office will retract the accusation filed_in 1990 . Marino said that charges against Gottlieb have been withdrawn with no requirement for an exam . Marino , who recommended that the medical board issue reprimands rather than press action in court this fall , said he decided this was the best course after listening to evidence presented by the doctors at a DEA administrative_hearing . The DEA ordered the doctors to show cause at a hearing this spring on why their certificates of registration to handle controlled substances should not be revoked because of their &quot; excessive &quot; prescription of several drugs including Demerol , Valium , Percocet and methadone &quot; without a legitimate medical purpose. &quot; The DEA has accused Skinner of improperly administering excessive drugs to Taylor from April , 1987 , through November , 1988 . The accusations against Roth pertain to the period from March , 1988 , through December , 1989 . Roth also is accused of prescribing excessive drugs to two other unidentified patients from January , 1991 , through February , 1993 . An attorney for the DEA , Wayne Patrick , had no comment on the case . The attorneys for the three doctors said they made a convincing argument at the DEA hearing that the doctors had properly prescribed medication for their patient , Taylor , who had an extremely high tolerance for drugs and very low threshold of pain . &quot; This is a complicated case , &quot; said Bruce Kelton , the attorney for Roth . &quot; A lot of experts testified . This is something that is not black_and_white . There ' s a debate on both sides about how pain should be controlled through medication. &quot;</TEXT>
