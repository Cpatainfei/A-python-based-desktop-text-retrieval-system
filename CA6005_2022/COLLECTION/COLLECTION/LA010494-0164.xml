   <HEADLINE> THE LION WILL ROAR AT LACMA ; MOVIES : MARKING MGM ' S 70TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR , A PRIME BATCH OF THE STUDIO ' S FILMS WILL SCREEN IN A TWO-MONTH , 40-FILM TRIBUTE STARTING FRIDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like the remains of some dethroned colossus , the disparate components of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , once the studio of studios , lie scattered and apart , an almost biblical rebuke to the hubris of those who felt they had created an invincible movie-making machine that could last forever . The fabled MGM lot in Culver City , which once spread_over 275 acres and boasted a lake , a jungle and its own post_office , is now reduced in size and in the hands of the Sony Corp. , which is carefully restoring it to previous splendor . The movies MGM made in its glory days , well_over a_thousand all told , are now owned by the Atlanta-based Turner Entertainment Co. , which is about to put them into service as the centerpiece of a new , commercial-free movie channel to be called TCM ( for Turner Classic Movies , of course ) and set to begin broadcasting in April . * And , after depressing years in an office_building just across the street from its old home , the movie-making part of MGM has relocated in a development in Santa Monica and is trying hard -- witness its current &quot; Six Degrees of Separation &quot; -- to claim a spot as a studio to be reckoned with . For those who long for the old days , when the studio ' s credo was &quot; Make_it good . . . make_it big . . . give it class , &quot; there is a temporary reprieve . Starting Friday ( and marking the studio ' s 70th anniversary year ) , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is hosting a two-month , 40-film tribute , complete with star appearances , to the entire span of MGM , from early silents like 1924 ' s &quot; He Who Gets Slapped &quot; to its more recent triumphs like &quot; Moonstruck &quot; and &quot; Thelma &amp; Louise. &quot; In an age when , unlike today , studios were not owned by diversified conglomerates and so had the opportunity to develop distinctive personalities , several things marked MGM and made_it stand_out from the pack . First was the studio ' s insistence on quality . From top people like art_director Cedric Gibbons and costumer Adrian down to the merest grip , MGM ' s employees believed_in making the glossiest , most glamorous films possible , and often stayed around for decades in_order to make that happen . * And what better to achieve glamour than stars ? Other studios might have the better directors or sharper writers , but not for nothing was MGM ' s motto &quot; More Stars Than There Are in Heaven. &quot; The studio scoured the Earth for likely performers , and when if it felt the potential was there , as it it did with a beautiful but untutored 18-year-old Ava Gardner , it did not hesitate to bring a neophyte out_to the studio for a complete and total make-over , including voice , posture , dress and deportment . Overseeing all this was the man without whom MGM would have been a very different place , Louis B . Mayer , who ran the studio like a benevolent / authoritarian father with a large and unruly family . Working_out of an office so sizable that fellow mogul Samuel Goldwyn claimed &quot; you need an automobile just to reach your desk , &quot; Mayer often out-acted his stars as he threatened or cajoled them into doing things his way . A major_league sentimentalist who claimed to worship women , especially mothers , his fondness for make-believe emotions and real tears marked MGM ' s product as surely as the roar of Leo_the_Lion that proceeded each film . * The museum ' s selection from MGM ' s vast output has , of course , its share of familiar classics that are always welcome on the big screen , from star vehicles like &quot; The Philadelphia Story , &quot; &quot; Mrs . Miniver &quot; and &quot; Dinner at Eight &quot; to familiar and deservedly loved musicals like &quot; Singin ' in the Rain &quot; and &quot; The Wizard of Oz. &quot; The museum is also showing once-celebrated films not often thought_of anymore . For instance , the severely truncated ( by head of production Irving Thalberg ) version of Erich Von Stroheim ' s would-be masterpiece &quot; Greed , &quot; accompanied , as are all_the silent films , by the excellent Robert Israel at the organ . Or the wildly popular weepy &quot; Random Harvest , &quot; a preposterous but irresistible tale of love and amnesia featuring classy performances by Greer Garson and Ronald Coleman . Best of all , the series offers a chance for more in-depth looks_at three areas the studio had something of a reputation in , starting with that most MGM of genres , the musical . The most celebrated were made by the Arthur Freed Unit , and the museum is screening some of these as well as some non-Freed extravaganzas . For instance : &quot; The Harvey Girls &quot; : Though she overmatches her nominal romantic co-star , John Hodiak , Judy Garland is expressive as always in this George Sidney-directed extravaganza about restaurant_chain waitresses who helped conquer the West &quot; with a beefsteak and a cup of coffee. &quot; Also memorable in this beautiful new print are Angela Lansbury as a bar-hall soprano with a permanent smirk , the tap-dancing of Ray Bolger , and the classic showstopper , &quot; On the Atchison , Topeka and the Santa Fe , &quot; which took 20 days to rehearse and eight hours to film . &quot; Lili &quot; : Any musical in which Zsa Zsa Gabor gives one of the stronger performances has got_to be unusual , but the truth is that with one exception all_the acting in this film is undistinguished . That exception is the luminous Leslie Caron , whose enchanting performance as an innocent young waif who communicates with marionettes helped , along with the lilting &quot; Hi-Lili-Hi-Lo , &quot; to make this a perennial audience favorite . &quot; Seven Brides for Seven Brothers &quot; : If the musical is one of the most American of genres , this has got_to be one of the most American of musicals . Set_in the Oregon Territory in 1850 and starring Jane Powell as the intrepid woman who impulsively marries Howard Keel only to find he lives with six unruly brothers , this film is known for its revolutionary Michael Kidd choreography . Brawny and athletic , &quot; Brothers &quot; featured dances that are half brawls and brawls that are half dances . It ' s as energetic and lively a musical as any studio ever made . Although MGM isn ' t always remembered for its horror films , it made more_than its share , some of which are featured in a five-film Horror Movie Marathon . Perhaps the most unusual of these is &quot; Mad Love , &quot; an atmospheric curio starring Peter Lorre as a brilliant but obsessed surgeon who grafts a killer ' s hands onto a concert pianist and lives to regret it . Aside from hearing Lorre say lines like &quot; I , a poor peasant , have conquered science ; why can ' t I conquer love ? &quot; the main interest this uneven film provides is its Expressionistic look and the work of Gregg Toland . MGM was also the home of perhaps the most unsettling actors Hollywood ever produced , Lon Chaney , and this series features three of his films , starting with &quot; He Who Gets Slapped &quot; and ending with Chaney ' s only talkie , a remake of his earlier success , &quot; The Unholy Three , &quot; which was released only seven weeks before the actor ' s untimely death at age 47 . With his expressive eyes and a mobile face , Chaney ' s greatest characterizations mixed pathos with malignancy to extraordinary effect . &quot; The Unknown , &quot; directed by longtime collaborator Tod Browning in 1927 , is vintage Chaney . He plays Alonzo the Armless , a traveling performer who competes with the circus strongman for the affection of the sloe-eyed Nanon ( an early role for Joan Crawford ) . Chaney used a double for some of the armless situations , but the formidable and unsettling presence he brought_to the role is his alone . More characteristic of the studio , and also represented by a marathon , are family films , the warm-hearted sentimental stuff that L.B. loved so well . In addition to &quot; Captains Courageous &quot; and a pair of Garland / Mickey Rooney programmers ( including &quot; Love Finds Andy Hardy , &quot; one of 16 Hardy films the studio turned_out ) , the museum is showing one of the best-loved kids movies ever made , &quot; Lassie Come Home. &quot; According to a fascinating book on the Lassie phenomenon by Ace Collins , MGM auditioned no fewer than 1 # 500 dogs when it decided to film the popular Eric Knight novel . Pal , the male dog who ended_up playing Lassie on film , was originally hired as a stand-in , but when the nominal star refused to do a demanding sequence , Pal ( quite literally ) jumped in , and the rest is history . Finely assisted by Roddy McDowall and an 11-year-old Elizabeth Taylor in her first MGM role , &quot; Lassie Come_Home &quot; earned $ 3 million in its opening weekend , a phenomenal figure for 1943 . As this entertaining series constantly reminds us , making family fare with integrity as well as emotion has become as much of a lost art as all_the other things MGM did so well , things that no one else seems to do at all these days .
