   <HEADLINE> CARTER WEIGHS BOSNIA TRIP AT REQUEST OF SERB WARLORD ; BALKANS : FORMER PRESIDENT WILL MEDIATE IF RADOVAN KARADZIC KEEPS PROMISES TO EASE TENSIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former President Jimmy_Carter said Wednesday that he will visit Bosnia-Herzegovina at the invitation of Bosnian Serb warlord Radovan Karadzic to try to mediate an end to the bloody Balkan war -- provided Karadzic follows_through with a six-point plan to ease tensions . Carter told Cable News Network that , if he makes the trip , he will not &quot; take sides &quot; in the war but will listen to the views of both the Muslim-led Bosnian government and Karadzic ' s Serbian insurgents , who have seized more_than 70 % of the territory of the former Yugoslav republic . That evenhanded approach contrasts with the official policy of the Clinton_Administration , which regards Bosnia ' s Serbs as the primary aggressors in the conflict and considers the government and its supporters to be the victims . The Administration has accused the Serbs of a long list of war_crimes stemming from their policy of &quot; ethnic cleansing , &quot; a program of murder , torture and intimidation intended to force non-Serbs out of areas under Serbian control . In a CNN interview , Karadzic said he outlined to Carter a six-point plan intended to ease the crisis . It includes an immediate cease-fire in the Sarajevo area , along with pledges to end the harassment of U.N. relief operations , release detained U.N. troops , free Bosnian government soldiers younger than 19 , permit the reopening of Sarajevo ' s airport and guarantee human_rights in areas under Serbian control . Carter said that he will accept Karadzic ' s invitation if the Serbian forces keep those promises , which he described as &quot; a step_in the right direction and an improvement on his position over the past few weeks. &quot; &quot; Mr. Karadzic assured me that all_of the tangible moves would be made immediately and then the world could see for itself that he was indeed going_to honor the things that he had committed to do , &quot; Carter said . In a terse written statement , the White_House expressed skepticism that Carter ' s intervention would be enough to settle the conflict that has bedeviled the international community for almost three years . But it welcomed Carter ' s effort . &quot; While we are skeptical about the Bosnian Serbs ' intentions , if the steps outlined by Karadzic are implemented , they would help reduce tensions and ease the humanitarian situation in Bosnia , &quot; the White_House said . &quot; The next step would be agreement among the parties on a countrywide cease-fire and renewed negotiations on a political settlement. &quot; The Administration will give Carter up-to-the-minute intelligence information about Karadzic ' s compliance with his promises , a senior Administration official said . &quot; We want to see how things happen on the ground , &quot; the official said . &quot; We will be in a position to inform former President Carter of the implementation of Karadzic ' s commitments . Carter wants to see if Karadzic makes_good on the promises. &quot; The official said Carter told Clinton that he will make the trip only if the Bosnian Serbs keep their pledge and &quot; President Clinton thinks that is a very prudent course. &quot; Karadzic said : &quot; It is a good opportunity to discuss the situation and confirm that now we are just at about the time to do some breakthrough . I do hope we will have President Carter here to visit Serb and Muslim sides very soon. &quot; The intervention is the third by Carter in less than a year in areas of diplomacy that usually are the exclusive sphere of the White_House and the State_Department . In the two previous situations , in North_Korea and Haiti , the former President negotiated directly with dictators whom the U.S._government was trying to isolate and exclude from normal diplomatic discourse . Both times , Carter defused potentially serious crises , although critics said he agreed to concessions that the Administration had earlier refused to make . Following his two earlier diplomatic efforts , Carter returned with words of praise for North_Korean dictator Kim Il Sung , who died shortly afterward , and Haiti ' s military ruler , Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras . The former President said he had invited Cedras -- denounced by Clinton as a tyrant and a murderer -- to teach Carter ' s Sunday_school_class at the Plains , Ga. , Baptist_Church . Carter operates in a twilight area between private activism and official diplomacy . His status as a former President brings substantial prestige to his activities , sometimes allowing him to make deals that would not be possible otherwise . Carter said that , if he goes_to Bosnia , he will have no official standing . &quot; I don ' t have any portfolio . . . . &quot; he said . &quot; If I should go_to Sarajevo . . . it would be representing the Carter Center , not representing the U.S._government . I have not been asked to be an official_emissary of the government. &quot; Carter said he does not plan to negotiate independently but instead will urge Karadzic to accept the peace plan outlined by the United States , Russia , Britain , France and Germany -- known as the Contact Group -- which would partition the country between the Serbs and a federation of the government and the Bosnian Croats . That plan would give 51 % of the territory to the Muslim-Croat federation and 49 % to the Serbs , who now hold more_than 70 % . The plan has already been accepted by the Bosnian government and the Croats .</TEXT>
