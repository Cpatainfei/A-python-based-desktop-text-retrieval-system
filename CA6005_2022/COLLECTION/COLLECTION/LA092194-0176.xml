   <HEADLINE> INTERVENTION MAY NOT STOP RIGHTS ABUSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The new outbreaks of violence against citizens by the Haitian military on Tuesday expose a potential flaw in the Clinton_Administration ' s Haitian peace accord -- that it may have no effective plan for quelling the human_rights violations that were a major reason for U.S. intervention . Indeed , U.S. military officials concede , the last-minute agreement obtained by the peace mission headed by former President Jimmy_Carter has forced American troops into an awkward partnership with the repressive Haitian military and police_forces they originally had planned to overwhelm and replace . As a result , these officials say , U.S. troops now must seek to &quot; co-opt &quot; the 7 # 000-member Haitian military gradually -- hoping eventually to coax the Haitian army and police_force into making reforms , even though that means allowing some measure of Haitian-against-Haitian violence to continue , at least for the short run . &quot; The task of keeping law and order in Haiti is the responsibility of the Haitian police_force and the Haitian military , &quot; U.S. Army Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , told reporters in Washington . &quot; We are not in a business of doing the day-to-day law and order , for that matter resolving or quelling any demonstrations . . . . &quot; But senior U.S. officials admit that the approach contains risks that may well unravel the entire democratization plan . To begin with , the current policy , under which U.S. troops would have to stand_by even while ordinary Haitians are beaten or shot at , fosters the perception that the Americans are backing the police -- and could prompt a backlash against U.S. forces . Shalikashvili himself publicly conceded Tuesday that the hands-off policy eventually could backfire on U.S. forces , acknowledging that the Haitian-on-Haitian violence contains a &quot; murky sort of threat &quot; that could end_up in &quot; explosive situations. &quot; U.S. soldiers &quot; have to be prepared_for it , &quot; he said . At the same time , U.S. officials are fearful that the increasing appearance of such incidents on American television screens could well prove politically unsustainable in the United States , sparking public outrage that could intensify pressure on Congress to force the Administration to get_out of Haiti early . Moreover , some strategists are predicting that the incidence of beatings and shootings -- which are daily fare in Haiti but probably unacceptable on American TV screens -- is almost certain to increase sharply as the Oct . 15 deadline for the departure of the army commander , Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , approaches . The criticism already has begun in the wake of Tuesday ' s incidents . Pierre Sane , secretary_general of Amnesty International , issued a statement saying the &quot; impunity for human-rights violators granted in the agreement between the U.S._government and the Haitian military puts that country ' s population in immediate danger. &quot; &quot; Letting killers and torturers ( in the Haitian army ) off_the_hook undermines long-term solutions to the country ' s continuing human_rights crisis because it sends a message that they can continue their abuses , &quot; Sane said in a speech delivered at United Nations headquarters in New York . The original invasion plan that the Administration had begun carrying_out on Sunday would have resolved that aspect of the Haitian problem . The operations order called_for U.S. troops to overpower the Haitian military and police_forces and to take_over all responsibility for keeping order in the country . But the arrangements dictated by the Carter accord -- while making_it easier for U.S. troops to enter the country -- require U.S. commanders to cooperate with the Haitian military and police_forces and leave to them the bulk of the responsibility for day-to-day police_action . That means that U.S. troops simply are not to intervene to stop Haitian police or militiamen from beating or even shooting ordinary Haitians , unless the violence becomes so widespread that it threatens the general stability of the country . It also means that except in cases in which U.S. troops feel that they are being threatened , the Americans will not aggressively disarm Haitian units or individuals . Instead , U.S. personnel will try to persuade Haitian military_leaders to recall unauthorized weapons . And they may finance a weapons buyback program to encourage Haitians to turn_in their arms voluntarily . The plan for overhauling the Haitian military is a slow one by any standard -- and an iffy one . A senior Pentagon official said Tuesday that the U.S. military hopes gradually to win the confidence of the Haitian military sufficiently to coax it into making some reforms , or at least into taking steps that may ultimately lead to more serious changes . &quot; It ' s going_to take a hell of a lot longer &quot; than overwhelming and replacing the Haitian military would have , he said . One such scheme calls_for prodding the Haitians to provide members of the military and police_forces with photo identification cards , keeping better track of their weapons and paying them with funds provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development to tie them more closely to U.S. influence . U.S. military_police officers also could accompany them to serve as examples . But the official warned that with the long history of police abuses and violence in Haiti , &quot; you ' re not going_to change Haitian society overnight. &quot; Haiti has a society &quot; that lives by intimidation , &quot; he said . He charged that critics want to establish a standard of violence-control &quot; that you can ' t meet in Los Angeles. &quot; The issue of disarmament also is a touchy one in Haiti . Although the army , which is equipped with Israeli-made assault_rifles and other lesser weapons , is so poorly armed that it is not considered a threat to the U.S. occupation force , hundreds of thousands of civilians are believed to have weapons ranging from target pistols to grenade launchers . Security experts say &quot; thousands and thousands &quot; of Haitians have guns , including civilian auxiliary police_forces called attaches , who are widely regarded_as terror squads and who carry_out the worst of the military ' s brutal oppression . &quot; The really dangerous people have M-16s , 9-millimeters and all sorts of heavy firepower , &quot; one said . Those weapons have been in_evidence recently as groups of civilians , mostly young_men in their 20s and 30s , have taken_over nighttime roadblocks , threatening foreign reporters and promising to punish pro-democracy Haitians . &quot; The army has handed_out at least 3 # 000 rifles to its attaches and other civilian supporters over the last three months , &quot; one expert said . Even those Haitians who criticize the country ' s military say the U.S. plan to buy_up civilian-held firearms is unlikely to work . &quot; You ' re not going_to buy back these weapons , &quot; one said when told of the American scheme . &quot; These people . . . think their lives depend_on their guns . What you ' ll get are rusty pieces of junk and useless stuff. &quot; But some Western observers contend the disarmament plan could work . While U.S. forces may be keeping the issue low-key right now , if disarmament becomes necessary &quot; the guns will be brought_in , at least most of them , &quot; one said . In 1987 , when the Haitian army sought to dismantle the Tontons Macoutes , the 55 # 000-member private_security_forces of the deposed Duvalier family , it simply ordered their weapons turned_in .</TEXT>
