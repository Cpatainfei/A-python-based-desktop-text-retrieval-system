   <HEADLINE> RIGHTS GROUP CLAIMS ISRAEL TORTURES PALESTINIAN PRISONERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A leading American human_rights organization on Tuesday accused the Israeli army and secret_police of systematically torturing Palestinian prisoners , even after the agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization on self-government . Describing Israeli interrogation of Palestinian prisoners as based on routine , officially tolerated -- and even sanctioned -- physical and psychological abuse , Human_Rights Watch called_on the Clinton_Administration to tie the $ 3 billion Israel receives annually in U.S. aid to ending torture . Human_Rights Watch , noting that U.S. law prohibits assistance to countries where the government &quot; engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of human_rights , &quot; said Washington cannot continue to ignore the widely documented torture of Palestinian prisoners and instead should see it as a threat to peace in the Middle_East . Eric Goldstein , research_director for the Mideast section of Human_Rights Watch , said in an interview that Palestinian self-government in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho district in the West_Bank had reduced the number of Palestinians interrogated by Israeli security_forces but changed nothing else . &quot; Torture is still an issue , &quot; he said . &quot; Two weeks after their withdrawal from Gaza , Israelis still had about 200 Palestinians in interrogation centers_on the West_Bank and in Israel ; moreover , they will want the Palestinian Authority to turn_over certain suspects to them for questioning. &quot; Maj . Gen . Ilan Biran , commander of Israeli forces in the West_Bank and in central Israel , dismissed the allegations of systematic torture and said isolated instances , when discovered and proven , were punished . &quot; Forget it -- it ' s not true , &quot; Biran said . &quot; We are doing our best to prevent ( torture ) and behave like human_beings . Unfortunately , there are a_few occasions when soldiers and policemen go_wrong , very wrong , in their behavior . . . . But don ' t try ( to make ) a mistake of one ( interrogator ) into routine brutality. &quot; In a statement , the Israel Defense Forces rejected &quot; unequivocally &quot; the Human_Rights Watch allegations . &quot; Any means of torture or violence against detainees is forbidden by Israeli law and any confession extracted against the free_will of the detainee is inadmissible as evidence , &quot; the army spokesman said , declaring that military interrogators &quot; strictly abide &quot; by these rules . But state-run Israeli television , in cooperation with Human_Rights Watch , broadcast an hourlong special Tuesday on the interrogations that appeared likely to call such assertions into question . Israeli liberals have tried but failed before to launch a national debate on one of the most controversial aspects of Israel ' s 27-year occupation of the Palestinian territories . But it will be hard to ignore troubling accounts by Israeli soldiers of what they did and what they saw while serving at interrogation centers . Drawing_on detailed interviews with 36 Palestinians held_over the past two years , on interviews with four Israeli soldiers who served at interrogation centers and on court testimony by agents of the General Security Service , the secret_police agency known as Shin Bet , Human_Rights Watch concluded that torture is a regular , deliberate practice . &quot; The overriding strategy of Israel ' s interrogation agencies in getting uncooperative detainees to talk is to subject them to a coordinated , rigid and increasingly painful regime of physical constraints and psychological pressures over days and very often for three or four weeks , &quot; the study said . Two-thirds of the former detainees Human_Rights Watch interviewed said they had been beaten -- punched , kicked , thrown against walls or had their testicles crushed by an interrogator ' s boot . Nearly all reported they were deprived of sleep for days or that they were forced to stand_in small closets , were confined to tiny chairs , had been shackled and stretched_out or bent over . And most said they were kept blindfolded or hooded with canvas sacks . &quot; The intensive , sustained and combined use of these methods inflicts the severe mental or physical suffering that is central to internationally accepted definitions of torture , &quot; Human_Rights Watch said , disputing Israeli assertions that the techniques , though harsh , fall far short of torture . &quot; Israel ' s political leadership cannot claim ignorance that ill treatment is the norm in interrogation centers , &quot; the group continued . &quot; The number of victims is too_large , and the abuses are too systematic . Official acquiescence is indicated also by the extreme infrequency with which abuses are punished and the fact that the classified ( secret ) guidelines for ( Shin Bet ) interrogators actually permit , under certain circumstances , the use of ' moderate ' physical pressure to obtain information. &quot; This report bolsters earlier studies conducted by Israeli , Palestinian and international groups , including the International Committee of the Red_Cross , Amnesty International and B ' Tselem , an Israeli organization that monitors human_rights abuses in the occupied territories .</TEXT>
