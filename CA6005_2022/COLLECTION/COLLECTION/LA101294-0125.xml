   <HEADLINE> HAITIAN ARMY PRONOUNCED DEAD AS ARM OF REPRESSION ; CARIBBEAN : WITH ITS TOP LEADERS OUT , DEBATE BEGINS ON HOW TO RESTRUCTURE IT . SOME QUESTION WHETHER THE NATION NEEDS A FULL-FLEDGED MILITARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For all intents and purposes , Haiti ' s army , an instrument of corruption and repression by tyrants and dictators across nearly two centuries , no longer exists , according to U.S. officials and military_officers . &quot; It died yesterday . It is a corpse , it just hasn ' t been buried yet . That comes Saturday , &quot; said a senior U.S. army_officer . He spoke_of the resignation Monday of former Commander_in_Chief Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras and his chief aide , Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby , and this Saturday ' s restoration of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president . Cedras , Biamby and police_chief Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois had ruled Haiti with vengeance and greed for more_than three years since Aristide was driven into exile by a military coup . But with American patience exhausted and President Clinton embarrassed by the Haitian army ' s refusal to give_in to traditional pressure and threats , American troops put an effective end to the troika Sept . 19 . It was never much of an army anyway . Although its current version is a mutant child of a national_guard created by U.S. Marines during their 1915-1934 occupation of Haiti , its mission was never a traditional military one . &quot; From the beginning , &quot; said a Haitian expert , &quot; the army was designed to maintain order and protect the ruling elite and its property against popular movements . &quot; By the time Aristide was elected ( in 1990 ) , it had degraded even from the original goal and was nothing more_than self-serving killers and thieves. &quot; Led by men virtually more experienced in extortion than battle , equipped with weapons more useful to a gun museum than a fighting force and less trained than an American high-school ROTC unit , the armed forces of Haiti couldn ' t even march in step . &quot; It is an embarrassment , &quot; a French officer said in 1991 while watching Cedras lead his stumbling forces through a Military Day parade . &quot; I have tin soldiers who march better than that. &quot; The occupation also ended the entire concept of a Haitian army as it has been understood since Haitian slaves formed a military and drove_out their French masters in 1804 . Since that year , a Haitian political expert said , the army , whether on its own or as the instrument of some class or another , became an institution that preceded all other institutions , according to Haitian experts . &quot; It represented independence and sovereignty for Haiti , &quot; said one former Haitian diplomat . &quot; But in reality it ran this country without regard for any interests but its own . It was always more a feudal group of thugs than a real military institution. &quot; &quot; This army , if you can call it that , had a monopoly on violence and there was no counterweight , &quot; agreed a U.S. official . &quot; It terrorized the people into cowardice , and it killed or corrupted anyone that could oppose it. &quot; That is over now , the sources concluded . &quot; The resignations ( of the three leaders ) are just the start , &quot; said a U.S. official . &quot; Many of the rest of the officers will either quit or be purged , and the entire institution will be reformed and reduced to a relative handful. &quot; The bloody role of the Haitian military right up_to Sept . 19 raises questions in the minds of many Haitians , including some of Aristide ' s closest advisers , about the need for an army . &quot; I know we need police , &quot; said Franz Voltaire , an Aristide supporter and aide to acting Prime_Minister Robert Malval . &quot; But police will be armed only with pistols and side_arms , not M-16s ( assault_rifles ) and Uzis ( submachine_guns ) . &quot; Costa Rica doesn ' t have any army and it gets_along OK . Let ' s just remove the temptation for future abuse. &quot; Privately , many U.S. officials agree . But American policy continues to reflect a debate between traditional U.S. military concern for maintaining a conservative institution to offset regional instability and foreign-service experts who think that a small nation ' s economy and political structure should preclude a serious military Establishment . Alluding to Haiti ' s border with the Dominican_Republic and its long coastline as requiring some sort of defense force , U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager gave the prevailing American view recently : &quot; Our hope is to preserve the army as an institution . . . a smaller one and a more professional one . &quot; Besides , &quot; he continued , &quot; there is the iconography of the institution . Countries think they need an army &quot; as a symbol of nationhood . The army officially has 7 # 000 soldiers , including 1 # 500 police , a figure that Aristide wants cut_to about 1 # 500 . U.S. sources say the total more likely will be about 3 # 000 . The purging is_well under way . U.S. officers estimate that more_than half of the soldiers have deserted and more are leaving . American troops have confiscated nearly every usable weapon , and all_important orders are issued by U.S. commanders . &quot; Cedras ' military had four generals , &quot; said a military planner . &quot; For the new one , a colonel would probably do , but it may have one general for appearances ' sake. &quot;</TEXT>
