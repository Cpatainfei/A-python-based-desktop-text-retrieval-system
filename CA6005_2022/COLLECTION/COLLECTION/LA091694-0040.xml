   <HEADLINE> POLITICAL BRIEFING : VALLEY CONGRESSMEN PART WITH PRESIDENT ON HAITI INTERVENTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> TO WAR OR NOT TO WAR : The usual partisan fissures within the San Fernando Valley congressional delegation have evaporated over U.S. military intervention in Haiti . The five members ( three Democrats and two Republicans ) agree that President Clinton should not get the U.S. militarily involved in the island nation until he has first secured congressional approval . For example , U.S. Reps . Anthony Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) , Howard ( Buck ) McKeon ( R-Santa Clarita ) and Henry Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) have co-sponsored resolutions and written letters urging Clinton to seek prior congressional authorization . And Reps . Howard Berman ( D-Panorama City ) and Carlos Moorhead ( R-Glendale ) share the same view . Moreover , the Valley ' s delegation is decidedly cool about the wisdom of invading Haiti at all . &quot; Howard opposes military intervention in Haiti , &quot; said Jean Smith , Berman ' s chief_of_staff . So do Beilenson , McKeon and Moorhead . Waxman ' s views could not be readily ascertained Thursday because he was observing the Yom Kippur holiday . &quot; It would be a big mistake to go_in there , &quot; Moorhead said in an interview . &quot; I don ' t see our national interest involved . It ' s impossible for us to make a democracy out of every country in the world. &quot; Moorhead also predicted that an invasion would result in significant U.S. losses -- not only from gunfire but from disease . &quot; There ' s a lot of AIDS over there , &quot; he said . McKeon said he is strongly opposed to sending ground troops into Haiti before other initiatives for purging its rulers have been tried . For example , he suggested that Clinton consider Ross Perot ' s plan for an aerial bombing of selective sites in Haiti . That could include the homes and headquarters of the military junta , McKeon said . &quot; We see film of the generals comfortably sipping their drinks_in their homes , &quot; McKeon said . &quot; Let ' s make them uncomfortable. &quot; Clinton should also consider offering the Haitian rulers large chunks of U.S. taxpayer dollars to leave their country and go_into exile , McKeon said . &quot; Let ' s buy_off the generals , &quot; he said . &quot; I know it sounds distasteful , but it could be a lot cheaper than spending a lot of money on an invasion and losing American lives. &quot; * PUTTING MONEY WHERE HIS MOUTH IS : With polls showing heavy , across-the-board support for Proposition 187 -- the November ballot initiative denying selected services to illegal immigrants -- its backers may have reason to be smug . The election is seven weeks away , so it ' s still early in the game . But at the very least , the people who put_up money to get Proposition 187 on the ballot have proven themselves adept at putting their fingers to the wind . A Times poll this week found 62 % of surveyed voters favoring the measure . Among the initiative ' s early financial backers is longtime state Sen . Don Rogers ( R-Tehachapi ) , whose 17th Senate District stretches from Kern County into the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys . Rogers , a staunch conservative whose views tilt to the right and stay there like a political Leaning Tower of Pisa , kicked_in $ 25 # 000 to help get the so-called Save Our State initiative qualified for the ballot . The measure would bar illegal immigrants from public_schools , non-emergency medical_care and social_services . In fact , according to the secretary_of_state ' s office , the loan from Rogers ' campaign committee was the third-biggest contribution bankrolling the petition drive . It ranked right after the California Republican_Party ' s $ 86 # 678 and $ 27 # 250 from the campaign committee of Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy ( R-Arcadia ) . Rogers , it may be recalled , was recently in the news when the Legislature ' s Latino and black caucuses criticized him for appearing before a group of suspected white_supremacists in Bakersfield . The senator spoke only of states ' rights and denies sharing any racist views . Whatever else may be said about Rogers , it ' s clear he ' s pretty good at summing_up public sentiment in his district . His Grand Old Party is embracing SOS for the long_haul , and 49 % of registered voters in the sprawling 17th District are Republicans . Democrats trail with 37 % . * SCOOPING_UP VOTES ? : Want to see your bill become law , even after it was already snuffed_out once by a stroke of the governor ' s pen ? Reintroduce it and get_it passed_by the Legislature in an election year . That way it will land on the governor ' s desk at_the_same_time as his campaign calendar update . Perhaps proving that timing is everything , Gov . Pete Wilson this week signed into law a bill similar to one he vetoed two years ago , allowing the state to lease two cutting-edge &quot; super-scooper &quot; firefighting planes . The legislation by Assemblyman Terry B . Friedman ( D-Brentwood ) gives the go-ahead for the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to trial-lease amphibious_aircraft that can scoop_up 1 # 600 gallons of water from an ocean or reservoir to dump on_fires . Wilson ' s turnabout follows a drubbing he took last year when victims of the Topanga Canyon and Malibu wildfires lit_up talk-radio phone_lines to question the governor ' s veto . Wilson nixed the bill in 1992 because it was too costly and he believed it could interfere with a restructuring that was under way in the Department of Forestry . But from the vantage_point of angry property_owners , the bill looked_like just the thing that may have saved their homes . * NO HORSING AROUND : Wilson dealt Assemblyman Richard Katz a major setback this week when he vetoed Katz ' s controversial bill to set_up a domestic-partners registry to benefit gays and seniors alike . But the Sylmar Democrat chalked_up a lower-profile victory when Wilson signed legislation to prevent stolen horses from ending_up on someone ' s dinner_table . This bill was perhaps of more personal significance to Katz , who became a horseman nine years ago as a condition of marriage to Gini Barrett , who in exchange agreed to learn the ins and outs of politics . ( Barrett , a quick_study , has held_up her end of the bargain better , Katz says. ) The new law stems from the growing number of equine thefts in California due_to increased demand for horse meat overseas . It requires law_enforcement agencies to report stolen or lost horses to the Bureau of Livestock Identification , which in turn surveys slaughter herds for the animals before they can be killed . Political cynics note that the new law could directly benefit some four-legged members of the Katz household : Cheyenne , a paint ; Azteca , an appaloosa ; Sundance , a palomino , and Peace , an appaloosa mix . * NAFTA COWBOY : Katz may be enough of an equestrian to ride in cattle-penning contests down at the state fairgrounds , but he ' s better known in public-policy circles for his role in transportation planning . Thus , as chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee , Katz was tapped to serve on a new panel studying international trucking resulting from the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , which went_into effect in January . Katz is the only California state legislator to serve as an appointee of the National Conference of State Legislatures to the subcommittee examining truck size and weight policies . * MONEY TALES : Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and his staff argued last week that he never meant to gain financially by quietly accepting a 5 % pay hike last month , noting that he only wanted the extra money so he could give it to four nonprofit programs in his district . Yet city officials have confirmed that Yaroslavsky could have made the same gift by simply transferring $ 1 # 200 from his $ 642 # 000 office budget to the four programs . &quot; There ' s no bar at all to doing this , &quot; said Steve Wong , a top aide in the chief legislative analyst office . But handling the transaction this way would have meant that Yaroslavsky would not have been eligible for a pension boost , and that the lawmaker could not have claimed the possible tax_advantages of donating to nonprofit groups . To wit , Yaroslavsky had to be looking_for a personal gain , said one city official . The only other explanation was that the chairman of the council ' s Budget Committee and a two-decade veteran of City_Hall didn ' t know how to finesse his own office budget . Hmmm . . . . Some within the City_Council family have also privately pointed_out another tried-and-true method council_members have used to fund nonprofit groups : giving them money from campaign contribution accounts . As of June 30 , Yaroslavsky had $ 177 # 994.61 in his account .</TEXT>
