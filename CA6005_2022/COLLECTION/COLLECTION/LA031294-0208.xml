   <HEADLINE> SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE ; WILL SUCCESS SPOIL MOE , STREET ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ski beat is so fickle . Less than a month after declarations of impending Olympic doom for U.S. skiers , we now consider whether success will spoil them . Remember Bill Johnson , the 1984 Olympic downhill champion who called his shot at Sarajevo , became a hero , was party to a painful made-for-TV movie , then skied off into the sunset ? It will be interesting to track the two U.S. Alpine stars to emerge from the Lillehammer Games : Tommy Moe and Picabo Street . We exempt from concern veteran Diann Roffe-Steinrotter , the women ' s super-G gold medalist , who plans to retire after this month ' s World Cup_finals at Vail , Colo . Moe , 24 , kick-started America ' s four-medal Olympic effort with his dramatic opening-day victory in the men ' s downhill . He followed with the silver in the men ' s super-G . Street , 22 , threw a bear_hug around fame after taking the silver in the women ' s downhill . Now comes the tough part . When we last left Moe , he was trying to reschedule an appearance on &quot; The Late Show With David Letterman &quot; as he sorted through his endorsement possibilities . The whirlwind has already affected Moe ' s performance . Last weekend , at Aspen , Colo. , he finished 55th and 19th in his first two World Cup downhills after his Olympic victory . Moe acknowledged that he was dragging . &quot; I just don ' t have the edge right now , &quot; he said after the Aspen races . &quot; I ' m kind of out of it. &quot; Moe lacks Street ' s marketable personality and catchy name , but he left Norway as the first U.S. male skier to have won two medals in the same Olympics . Street ' s silver might not carry as much weight on Madison Avenue , but it ensures that she will not be denied her 15 minutes of fame . The concern : Moe and Street are impressionable . Both were successful rehabilitation projects . Moe overcame earlier problems with marijuana and untamed adolescence . Street is , by nature , a spitfire who was suspended by the U.S. ski team three years ago because she lacked a work ethic . Both have a lot more to offer . Coaches think Moe can develop_into a four-event skier to rival Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway . This hope is based on two solid slalom runs Moe made in placing fifth in the Alpine combined . He has a long way to go_in slalom , and playing catch-up won ' t be easy . &quot; It ' s very hard to get that last second to the top , &quot; said Aamodt , who is not shaking in his boots just yet . Street , passed_over as an Olympic starter in the super-G , should be scoring much better in that event . She was the racer most affected by the cancellation of the make-up super-G Friday at Mammoth Lakes . After finishing 12th in Wednesday ' s super-G , she needed another solid finish to qualify for next week ' s super-G in the World Cup_finals at Vail . Only the top 20 in each discipline are guaranteed starts in the finals . Street does not rank among the top 20 in super-G , but with a strong finish Friday she could have qualified as an at-large seeded skier based on overall World Cup points . Now , Street will compete only in next week ' s downhill , the event in which she won the silver at Lillehammer . If success doesn ' t destroy or distract them , Moe and Street could be bigger stars at the 1998 Winter_Olympics in Nagano , Japan . U.S. Alpine Director Paul Major said the team will take its cues from Moe , the Pied Piper of Lillehammer . &quot; The true test of a champion is , are they going_to come bouncing_back ? &quot; he said . &quot; The thing we want to do with Tommy is avoid those mistakes . Tommy ' s got such a good head on his shoulders -- he realizes there ' s going_to be lot of pressure on him . There ' s a lot of potential to commercialize him . that ' s fine , given that he can still ski and train properly . But he ' s got his feet on the ground. &quot;</TEXT>
