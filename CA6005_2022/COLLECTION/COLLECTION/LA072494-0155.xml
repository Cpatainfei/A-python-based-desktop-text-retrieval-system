   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON THE SIMPSON CASE ; RACISM PLOY CAN ONLY HURT BLACKS ; REVEALING THE DETECTIVE ' S HISTORY WILL STRENGTHEN SUSPICIONS ABOUT LAPD ; IT ' S CYNICAL AND HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH A DEFENSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a case that until recently mainstream pundits regarded_as &quot; race-free , &quot; race is now emerging as the hidden , potentially explosive subtext . Perhaps the true irony is that the trial of a man regarded by the media as being &quot; race neutral &quot; is beginning to reveal in painful clarity the polarizing and ultimately bankrupt discourse on race and racism . Within the black community , race figured significantly in discussions about the Simpson case from the beginning . The widespread belief that O . J . Simpson was another in a long list of African American men targeted for public destruction initially played no role in mainstream discussions of the case . Yet , with the abundance of conspiracy theories that have circulated within the African American community , it was only a matter of time before such suspicions surfaced as a sensationalized media story , and most important , a possible defense strategy . Revelations regarding Detective Mark Fuhrman ' s unsuccessful 1983 disability petition provide_for many the smoking gun that heretofore existed only as an unsubstantiated but passionately held belief that Simpson is the target of a racially motivated frame-up . Critics of this potential defense strategy have been harsh : Some commentators have decried the possible injury to Fuhrman , who told Newsweek that his career was now ruined ; others have excoriated the defense for introducing the volatile issue of race in a manner that may compromise the integrity of the criminal process and contribute to continuing racial tension in Los Angeles . Yet the real threat of such a ploy -- if in fact it turns_out to be one -- is not to an officer who essentially claimed that blacks and Latinos drove him crazy , nor to the criminal justice system that frequently blinks at the racism that infects its processes . One can rest easy in the belief that the Police_Department and the criminal justice system can and should take the heat . The real loser in all this may be the African American community whose legitimate complaints against police abuse stand to be dwarfed and discredited not only through the defense ' s possibly cynical manipulation of the community ' s concerns and fears , but also by the way the system ' s treatment of Fuhrman denies the realities about race and policing that many African Americans feel they know . The history of Fuhrman ' s unsuccessful bid to win a disability pension for stress says much more about the cavalier attitude of public officials toward African American concerns regarding abusive police behavior than it reveals about the Simpson case . At best , the Police_Department permitted a disgruntled officer who admitted a propensity for violence to remain on active duty . At worst , it determined that a man who expressed hostility toward blacks and Latinos was fit to carry a badge -- and the power of life or death that comes_with it . Despite these deeply troubling characterizations , neither the LAPD nor the District_Attorney averred to the significant risk of relying_on the credibility of Fuhrman and others like him to provide testimony that directly affects the lives of people that officers devalue and disrespect . Perhaps it is a fateful stroke of poetic_justice that with the eye of the nation now trained on Los Angeles , the District_Attorney ' s office has to grapple with its past insensitivity to racism in a case that arguably has little to do with it . These embarrassing revelations suggest that the real threat to the integrity of the criminal justice system is not the raising of the race issue , but rather the failure of government public officials to take racism seriously in the first place . Yet this is a lesson likely to be lost on the authorities . Rather than honestly acknowledging the difficulty presented by Fuhrman , they are poised to take the route guaranteed to anger many African Americans and to strengthen defense_attorney Robert Shapiro ' s hand . Any attempt to defend Fuhrman ' s credibility will imply that he is an exemplary police_officer , thus relegating his self-proclaimed bigotry to the past . In so doing , the prosecution becomes identified as condoning racism within the Police_Department , while Shapiro is seen as championing the truth , namely , that there are some bigoted officers in the LAPD who are quite capable of violating the rights of black citizens . In short , the Fuhrman story opens_up the black community to potential manipulation for the benefit of O.J. Simpson . Of course , the defense is , within bounds , obligated to offer any possible argument that might acquit the defendant . It is important that the African American community not be misled into believing that Simpson ' s defense_team is taking_up the banner to fight abusive police practices . They are acting_on behalf of only one African American , O.J. Simpson . That is why the Fuhrman theory , having been floated into the public consciousness , is likely to be dropped ; there are numerous hurdles to be scaled in substantiating its relevance to the case , and , given the willingness of some jurors to acquit officers who were videotaped beating a suspect , it is unlikely that speculation about Fuhrman ' s off-camera activities would find support in a broader audience . The worst and unfortunately most likely scenario is that the defense simply floated the theory to consolidate beliefs within the African American community that there is a conspiracy . Should the forensic evidence weigh against Simpson , other segments of the population may be persuaded , while many African Americans , taunted by a scenario that was never intended to be fully pursued , hold onto beliefs that , unfortunately , will be dismissed as irrational and paranoid . The real tragedy in this turn_to race may be its ultimate erasure as authorities and media alike , anxious to breathe a sigh of relief , scramble to shelve the issue without resolving it . The realities of race are too important to be simplistically played and subsequently marginalized . Just as African Americans will be challenged to see beyond race , so must the legal and media community undertake to see and speak race . Race should not be overplayed , nor should the legal and political community seek to underplay it . Of course , while the burden to avoid the worst-case scenario should be shared by all communities , it will most likely be borne by African Americans . The task , then , is to weigh and consider all_the evidence -- including the work of Fuhrman -- in light of the competing objectives pursued by the prosecution and the defense . Just as this requires African Americans to keep sight of the interests of the prosecution , so must African Americans keep sight of the limited objectives of the defense , which is to free Simpson , by all means possible .</TEXT>
