   <TEXT> * Your July 31 editorial ( &quot; Greasing the Skids for GATT &quot; ) expresses discomfort at the prospect of anything other_than GATT ' s &quot; slam dunk &quot; approval by Congress . Your article , however , doesn ' t mention some greatly disturbing provisions in the treaty . Certain hard-won environmental and other protective U.S. laws are in danger of being seriously undermined by GATT . For example , according to a report released by Public Citizen in April , U.S. federal , state and local food safety laws can be challenged by other countries as &quot; illegal trade_barriers &quot; before secret tribunals of trade experts where public participation is barred . If any U.S. law is deemed &quot; illegal &quot; under GATT , the law would have to be changed or the U.S. would be stuck paying perpetual trade sanctions . The commission designated by GATT to determine food standards for global trade ( a body heavily influenced by the chemical and food industries ) permits the use of 40 pesticides banned in the U.S. Eight of these pesticides are rated highly hazardous by the World_Health_Organization and six as carcinogens by the EPA . These facts alone mandate that GATT be voted_down since , as you state , Congress cannot amend the treaty . CHERYL S . YOST Los Angeles</TEXT>
