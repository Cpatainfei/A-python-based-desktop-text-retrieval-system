   <HEADLINE> DIVISIVE STATE CAMPAIGN LURCHES TOWARD FINISH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With more_than $ 90 million spent and the jagged emotions of Californians over illegal immigration laid bare , the state ' s nastiest and most contentious election contests in years will rumble to a close Tuesday . More_than 8.8 million Californians are expected to cast ballots , either in_person Tuesday or by mail , electing or reelecting a U.S. senator , a governor and a host of lesser constitutional officers and determining the fate of several hard-fought propositions . Chief among them is the controversial Proposition 187 , the initiative that would deny public education and non-emergency health services to illegal immigrants . The measure has divided the state ' s elected officials and candidates -- largely along partisan lines -- produced a raft of comment from national figures and provoked reaction among the state ' s residents unseen since 1978 ' s groundbreaking Proposition 13 . But even that proposition , which sharply limited property_taxes , did not carry the overwhelming emotional content of Proposition 187 , which has prompted high_school students and tens of thousands of other opponents to take_to the streets , forced proponents to defend themselves against charges of racism and led both sides to conclude that the proposition ' s immediate impact will be a rush to the courts to determine its constitutionality . The proposition ' s fate , and those of the scores of candidates on the ballot , rest in the hands of an electorate that is polarized and discontented , according to pollsters . &quot; Voters are in a mood to hear extremes this year , &quot; said John Brennan , director of the Los Angeles Times Poll . &quot; They are not in the mood to hear a nice message . They are in the mood to hear a nasty message . I hate to say they are angry . They are just ornery. &quot; Immigration -- specifically the hiring of illegal immigrants -- was the dominant focus for the final weeks in the close-fought election for U.S. Senate , which pits Democratic incumbent Dianne Feinstein against Republican challenger Mike Huffington . It is not at all_clear as Election_Day nears whether Proposition 187 will win or lose , or whether it will influence the outcome of the increasingly bitter governor ' s race . Polls taken_in the last week before the election suggested that Republican Pete Wilson was holding_on to a lead over his Democratic challenger , Kathleen Brown , and that backers of Proposition 187 were also winning narrowly . Nevertheless , Brown was scrambling to use her opposition to the initiative to vault past incumbent Wilson , who over the past year has overcome a massive deficit in early polls . Over the weekend , pollsters were nervously fingering their spreadsheets and campaigns were casting_about to determine their standing . While Wilson had at least a bit of breathing space over Brown , polls in the Senate_race had Feinstein and Huffington in a virtual dead_heat . All of their handlers were whispering that the races would hinge_on one overriding uncertainty : voter_turnout . Acting Secretary_of_State Tony Miller said he expected 60.2 % of California voters to cast ballots on Tuesday . That would be a slight increase from the 58.6 % who voted_in the last governor ' s race four years ago . About 14.7 million Californians are eligible to vote Tuesday , 49 % of them Democrats and 37 % Republicans , with the rest belonging_to minor parties . The figure was a record for a non-presidential election , easily eclipsing the mark of 13.5 million eligible voters in November , 1990 . By contrast , 15.1 million were_on the rolls for the 1992 presidential election . Polling places will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday . The races climax today and Monday with candidates and proposition partisans circling the state by car , bus , plane and virtually any sort of transportation_system that can bring them into contact with voters . Those hiding out_in their homes will get no respite , however , given the dawn-to-dusk television commercials that are expected to bombard voters in these last few days before the election . Most of the staggering sums_of_money raised by candidates this election year has been spent on television , the major form of communication in this vast and varied state . Before the last two weeks of spending was even counted , Wilson and Brown set a record in the amount_of_money raised in a race for governor -- and they were expected to spend every_last cent of it . In the last two years , Wilson collected $ 26.8 million and Brown $ 20.7 million . The sums do not include millions more spent after Oct . 22 , when the financial filing period ended . The duo ' s combined running total of $ 47.5 million easily outdistanced the $ 45 million raised and spent by Wilson and his opponent , Feinstein , in the 1990 governor ' s race . The battle for Senate also set a record , with Huffington and Feinstein spending more_than $ 38 million with more_than a week to go before the election . Of that , Huffington spent more_than $ 27 million of_his_own fortune , and Feinstein had loaned her campaign more_than $ 2 million . Having spent all that money , the candidates by Monday night will have little to do but sit_back and worry over who comes_to the polls -- a fact of political life that the major political_parties have spent $ 13 million trying to influence this year . Republicans estimate that their get-out-the-vote efforts will cost $ 4 million , while the Democratic Party plans to spend $ 9 million to urge its voters to the polls , according to party chairman Bill Press . Press described the party ' s effort as its most comprehensive ever , including 50 offices , 250 paid workers , more_than 5 # 000 precinct captains and a blizzard of mail all focused_on 1.2 million &quot; occasional &quot; Democratic voters . Those are voters who , as Press put it , &quot; are the ones that vote for President and never think it is worthwhile to vote for governor. &quot; To help remedy that , President Clinton flew into Los Angeles and Oakland , the heart of the two most Democratic areas in the state , for Friday and Saturday rallies intended to drum_up support for party nominees . Clinton_Administration officials and other national Democrats were casting a wary eye at California , which is central to the often-beleaguered Clinton ' s hopes for reelection in 1996 . The President has been more popular in California than elsewhere in the nation , but his popularity has fallen during his presidency . &quot; ( The year ) 1994 is 1996 in California . It ' s clear , &quot; said Press . Republican get-out-the-vote efforts were meant to target 10 # 000 of the state ' s 25 # 169 precincts , according to party Chairman Tirso del Junco , and by the weekend included more_than 3 million phone_calls made from 1 # 200 telephone_lines set_up at party offices . Like the Democrats , Republicans were assaulting potential voters with mail . The GOP chairman , who has been involved in Republican politics for 30 years , said that his volunteers were being aided by optimism among the ranks . Across the nation , and in California , the political landscape has changed dramatically in the past two years . In 1992 , Democrats were seen as the advocates of change and best suited to address pressing problems . Since then , polls have shown those factors swinging to the GOP side . &quot; I feel very good because you know how bad it was a year and a half ago , &quot; Del Junco said . &quot; When the party smells victory , it ' s a lot easier to do what we are doing. &quot; Republican officials believe that their efforts will at least match those of Democrats because , although they are not spending as much money , they are using more volunteers . Traditionally , Republicans have had the edge_in pre-election vote-getting efforts , a fact that Press has labored to change . As the election neared , those in_charge of get-out-the-vote efforts and the campaigns as well were trying to determine whether Proposition 187 would change the dynamics of the major races on Election_Day . Republicans , who generally support the initiative , argued that it was likely to increase voter_turnout -- but that the impact would be negligible . &quot; At least right now , it appears that it will turn_out approximately the same number of supporters as opponents , &quot; said Dan Schnur , the Wilson campaign spokesman . According to Republican polls and other private surveys , supporters of the proposition were holding their own coming_into the weekend , after having lost ground in the previous two weeks . But Democrats were hoping that their candidates would be propelled into office by the gusts of a late-developing tail wind against the proposition . &quot; The story of this election is 187 , &quot; said party Chairman Press . State_Treasurer Brown , 49 , changed the focus of her campaign in the final two weeks to reflect her belief that the initiative would be defeated -- and Wilson , a supporter , would go_down with it . In travels across the state , she continued to hawk her economic plan but stepped_up her criticism of Wilson ' s position on Proposition 187 and defended her opposition as a morally correct view . &quot; It seems to me the test of leadership today is going_to be the test of holding people together and fighting to rebuild an economy , a sense of community and to rebuild the sense of family , &quot; she told students at Santa Maria High_School last week . &quot; And Proposition 187 tears it apart , takes it apart , and asks people to divide themselves up. &quot; Wilson , for his part , spent the last two weeks of the campaign contending that he was the best candidate on the important issues of crime and jobs . Crime , an issue that he has used to bludgeon Brown throughout the campaign , was the topic Thursday when 200 members of the group known as Memory of Victims Everywhere gathered_in Hollywood to honor the 61-year-old governor for his crime-fighting efforts . &quot; We thank_you for all_the people who won ' t be dead this year . . . because you cared enough , &quot; said Collene Campbell , a leader of the crime victims movement . &quot; We love you. &quot; The Senate_race turned_in its final days on Proposition 187 and the broader question of the candidates ' personal employment of illegal immigrants . The big-spending Huffington campaign was rocked when , a_few days after he endorsed the proposition , The Times reported that he and his wife had employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny for their children until last year -- a violation of federal law and one that inspired catcalls from Democrats that the congressman was a hypocrite . Then last week it was reported that in the early 1980s Feinstein had employed a Guatemalan woman whom Huffington contended was an illegal immigrant . In any case , the employment occurred when it was not against the law and only after , Feinstein said , she had been shown paperwork identifying the woman as a legal resident of the state . Feinstein opposes Proposition 187 . The publicity garnered by the Senate and governor ' s races and some of the propositions has been so overwhelming that it has overshadowed contests for the other statewide offices , in which candidates have spent up_to several million dollars but still languished in relative anonymity . In the contest for lieutenant_governor , Democrat Gray Davis is attempting to trade_in two terms as state controller for the post of second-in-command . Standing_in his way is Republican Cathie Wright , a state_senator from Simi Valley . Acting Secretary_of_State Tony Miller , who took_over for longtime boss March Fong Eu when she left in February to become ambassador to Micronesia , is hoping to win the job outright . Running against him is a former Assembly Republican leader and current assemblyman , Bill Jones of Fresno . The battle for attorney_general has dissolved into a contest of angry denunciations between incumbent Republican Dan Lungren , who is seeking his second term , and Democratic Assemblyman Tom Umberg . Central to their most contentious spats have been an Umberg television commercial that suggests that Lungren ' s policies contributed to the 1993 death of 12-year-old Petaluma resident Polly Klaas , who was kidnaped from her bedroom during a slumber_party . Lungren heatedly denies any connection . The race for state_treasurer will determine whether March Fong Eu ' s family maintains its hold_on state office even after her departure . Her son Matt Fong , unlike Eu a Republican , gave_up his seat on the State Board of Equalization to run_for treasurer . The Democratic nominee is former party Chairman Phil Angelides of Sacramento . For state controller , former Los Angeles city housing director Kathleen Connell , a Democrat , is running against former Republican assemblyman Tom McClintock of Rocklin in a race that has been notable for McClintock ' s ads , which purport to have a flinty Scot relative of McClintock attesting to his cheapness . Seeking to replace John Garamendi as insurance commissioner is fellow Democrat and longtime legislator Art Torres of Monterey Park . His opponent is Charles Quackenbush , a Republican from Cupertino . For the nonpartisan office of superintendent of public instruction , Democrat Maureen DiMarco is running against another Democrat , Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin . Eastin has the backing of most of the Democratic hierarchy . Di Marco , the former president of the California School_Boards Assn. , is Republican Wilson ' s secretary of child development and education . Other propositions overshadowed by 187 include Proposition 184 , which significantly lengthens criminal sentences and is , word for word , the same as a bill passed this year by the Legislature and signed by the governor . Proposition 186 would create a universal health_insurance program for state residents . Proposition 188 , devised and funded largely by tobacco firms , would repeal all local smoking bans and institute one looser , statewide policy . Proposition 181 would authorize $ 1 billion in bonds to finance rail services for Californians . Proposition 183 would increase the number of days in which a governor has to place a recall election on the ballot to 180 from the current level of no more_than 80 . Proposition 185 would impose a 4 % gas tax to finance mass transit and other transportation projects . Proposition 189 would change the state Constitution to clarify that judges can do what they are already authorized to do -- deny bail to jailed , accused child_molesters and rapists . Proposition 190 would restructure the state Commission on Judicial Performance , which disciplines judges , by giving the public majority membership on the commission and requiring proceedings to be open . Proposition 191 would convert the state ' s 47 rural justice courts into municipal courts .
