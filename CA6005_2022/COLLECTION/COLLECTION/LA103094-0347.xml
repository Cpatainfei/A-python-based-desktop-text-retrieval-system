   <HEADLINE> DISNEY ' S MAGIC SCHOOL ; CALARTS STUDENTS ARE AT THE CORE OF THE ANIMATION BOOM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It may be the best investment Walt Disney ever made . Not the mouse who grew to become an American cultural icon , nor the soggy Florida swampland that cost Disney about $ 185 an acre in 1964 and is now worth more_than $ 1 billion as the home of Walt Disney World . Disney ' s masterstroke may have been his founding of a private arts college that squats in relative obscurity among the brown , dusty hills of Valencia about 50 miles north of Los Angeles . Conceived three decades ago , partly as a clever way to funnel an army of skilled animators into the Disney studios , California Institute of the Arts has spawned a generation of students who have become the creative nucleus of the Disney empire -- responsible_for animating the long-locked princesses , chubby lion_cubs and other characters that have brought the company billions of dollars in entertainment and related merchandise revenue . If there ' s one elusive ingredient vital to the incandescent Disney magic , CalArts is it . As Walt Disney Co . continues to dominate the animated film business with hits such_as &quot; The Lion King &quot; and &quot; Aladdin , &quot; CalArts alumni continue to dominate its animation ranks . More_than 50 CalArts graduates contributed to &quot; The Lion King , &quot; which has grossed $ 267 million domestically so far . The co-producer and co-director of 1992 ' s &quot; Aladdin &quot; came from CalArts , as did more_than 50 other animators on the film . More CalArts grads were behind the 1993 movie &quot; The Nightmare Before Christmas , &quot; including producer Tim Burton and director Henry Selick . Nearly 70 CalArts alumni worked_on &quot; Beauty and the Beast. &quot; More are now at_work on &quot; Pocahontas , &quot; &quot; The Hunchback of Notre Dame &quot; and &quot; Fantasia Continued. &quot; These feature_films have helped ignite an industrywide boom in animation and become Disney ' s financial core . While attendance at the firm ' s theme parks lags -- the Euro Disney investment is undergoing a massive refinancing effort amid losses of more_than $ 550 million -- and its live-action record is mixed , animated movies and ancillary products have driven revenue to record levels of $ 7.36 billion for the first nine months of 1994 . Since 1989 , the year of &quot; The Little Mermaid , &quot; Disney ' s filmed entertainment revenue has swelled from $ 1.59 billion to $ 3.67 billion in 1993 , and product sales have more_than tripled , from $ 411 million to $ 1.42 billion . Today , &quot; animated products affect about 30 % of Disney ' s ( annual ) cash flow , &quot; says Harold Vogel , an entertainment analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York . Exactly how big a contribution CalArts makes to Disney ' s bottom_line is nearly impossible to measure , and both Walt Disney Co . and the school like to play_down their interdependence . Disney executives point_out that they also recruit from Sheridan College in Toronto and Ringling Brothers School of Art in Sarasota , Fla. , among others . CalArts emphasizes that many of its graduates migrate elsewhere for work and that animation artists represent only about a fifth of the school , which is also highly regarded for its programs in live-action filmmaking , fine_art , music , dance and theater . But both CalArts and Disney acknowledge that the longtime bond between them has grown_into a powerful synergy that keeps Disney well at the forefront of the animation business -- and brings CalArts money , cachet and connections . Walt Disney Co . Vice_Chairman Roy E . Disney , whose father , Roy O . Disney , took_over CalArts ' construction upon younger brother Walt ' s death in 1966 , says CalArts has had a &quot; huge amount &quot; to do with the studio ' s ability to produce one highly profitable film after another . CalArts students &quot; have such good groundwork that they can start_out at a much higher level in the art than someone coming_in from the outside , &quot; says Disney , who along with recently deposed Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg and Animated Features President Peter Schneider , is credited with the revival of animation at Disney . * CalArts opened its animation department in 1972 and graduated its first animation class in 1976 . But the dynamic partnership didn ' t fully gel until the mid-1980s , when CalArts hit its stride academically and Disney emerged from a long companywide downturn that had depressed earnings and resulted in a series of dismally performing animated films such_as &quot; The Black Cauldron. &quot; At the time , Disney leaned_on the school simply to provide warm bodies . Roy E . Disney says that when he rejoined the company during a dramatic management coup in 1984 , &quot; there was a bit of an exodus &quot; in the animation department . &quot; We had to go_to CalArts and say , ' Who wants to come and work ? ' &quot; The beginning of the resurgence was &quot; The Little Mermaid &quot; in 1989 , which critics said recaptured the Disney magic and which drew millions of moviegoers . But Disney ' s tradition of investing in and nurturing animation artists -- and keeping them in the fold -- is as old as its treasured mouse . In the 1930s , when Walt Disney started art_classes at his studio , a visitor was likely to encounter 30 men in tailored suits gathered around a sandbox , sketching the movements of a live deer in preparation for &quot; Bambi. &quot; &quot; CalArts started with Walt ' s having housed a great group of talented artists under one roof , and seeing them rubbing_off on one another and the synergies that happened when they got_together . And so his notion for the school was to do the same thing as a school instead of as a business , &quot; Roy Disney says . &quot; For sure , he saw it ( CalArts ) right from the beginning as a wellspring of finding talent. &quot; Sixty-odd years later , the school sends forth a steady stream of new talent that receives in-house classes and training_programs at the studio . &quot; School just goes_on here after they leave there , &quot; Disney says . &quot; We think it ' s probably the single most important thing we do. &quot; That commitment translates into generous support of CalArts . Roy Disney sits on the school ' s board of trustees . So does Walt Disney Co . Chairman Michael D . Eisner . So does Katzenberg , who helped drive Disney ' s vigorous comeback in animation before he left the company in August . When Disney hosts an animated movie premiere , the proceeds usually go_to CalArts . Following a benefit screening of &quot; The Lion King &quot; in June , for example , Roy Disney wrote a check to the school for $ 800 # 000 . When CalArts President Steven D . Lavine decided in 1988 that it was important to equip the animation department with computers , the Roy Disney Family Foundation and Walt Disney Co . put_up the money for a three-year plan . In financial terms , Disney ' s investment in the school represents only a smidgen of the company ' s annual revenue , and Lavine says Disney ' s total contribution represents only about 5 % of the school ' s annual budget . But Disney aids the college in other , vital ways . For instance , when the Northridge earthquake caused $ 30 million in damage to the campus in January , Eisner directed the real_estate team at Disney to find a temporary site for the school . And &quot; it was Frank Wells ( the late chief operating officer of Disney ) who approached the Bank of America for us and helped arrange the financing to get us through it , &quot; Lavine says . Lavine also turned_to his board of trustees to write letters urging the Federal Emergency Management Agency to grant money to the school , which received more_than $ 22 million in federal aid . The school ' s A-list board includes Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael S . Ovitz ; QVC Chairman and Chief_Executive Barry Diller ; Bruce Berman , Warner Bros . Pictures president of worldwide production and a former student at CalArts ; L.A. Music Center board Chairman Robert B . Egelston , and computer software guru Peter Norton . &quot; We wanted to be sure that the people at FEMA understood that there is a powerful synergy , and that since in the economy of California the strongest element is the entertainment_industry , that there is good reason to be concerned with the well-being of an institution that feeds the health of that industry , &quot; Lavine says . CalArts ' ability to feed Hollywood ' s health derives from a curriculum that is extraordinarily industry-oriented for a fine_arts school . Classes emphasize what is new and how the arts will define the next generation of entertainment . Hartmut Bitomsky , dean of the School of Film / Video , says that &quot; especially the character animation students . . . are very industry-driven , &quot; inviting comparisons between the CalArts-Disney link and traditional corporate-university relationships such_as that between Eastman Kodak Co . and Rochester University or the aerospace industry and California Institute of Technology in Pasadena . Not that Disney is the school ' s only Hollywood supporter . Lavine says Ovitz has been a key help in CalArts ' recent move_into multimedia . &quot; His agents have been exploring which of the new technologies they think are going_to be the most valuable for their clients to get involved in . . . . &quot; Lavine says . &quot; We ' ve been getting advice from that group of agents about those new technologies. &quot; * A steady influx of Disney-loving students is only one resource CalArts provides its corporate founder . The obsessive control Disney exercises throughout the Magic Kingdom extends into animation largely through CalArts , creating what critics call the &quot; Disney-CalArts look &quot; in its films . &quot; Disney has found a formula and it ' s working for them , &quot; says Becky Bristow , CalArts ' director of character animation . &quot; They are always within their corporate icon. &quot; That predictability has been a key element of Disney ' s success , driving everything from film attendance to patronage of live attractions such_as &quot; The Lion King Celebration &quot; parade at Disneyland to sales of millions of pajamas , CDs , videos , pop-up books , Halloween costumes and other merchandising spinoffs . Characters with the so-called Disney look crop_up often in the work of students at CalArts , where seven of the 20 teachers in the character animation department are employed by Disney . Mark Kausler , a CalArts graduate and veteran Disney animator , says the trademark Disney design &quot; pervades every aspect &quot; of its films , from the story line to the character types to the colors . &quot; I would n ' t say they teach Disney style there ( at CalArts ) per se , &quot; Kausler says , &quot; but they teach Disney building blocks. &quot; Beyond that , he says , &quot; it comes_out by imitation. &quot; Animators point_out the similarities in the latest generation of Disney characters : Pocahontas looks_like the Native_American cousin of the &quot; Aladdin &quot; princess , who in turn looks_like the Arab reincarnation of Belle in &quot; Beauty and the Beast. &quot; The evil Scar in &quot; The Lion King &quot; and the villainous Jafar in &quot; Aladdin &quot; could be relatives . Even the large-beaked Zazu in &quot; The Lion King &quot; resembles Jafar ' s parrot sidekick , Iago . One obvious hallmark of Disney design is characters with huge , expressive eyes . &quot; Disney has a fixation on the eyes , because they feel that the story is told through the eyes , &quot; Kausler says . Other Disney perennials are a lovable lead character , goofy sidekicks that provide the gags and a moralistic tale with an upbeat ending . CalArts ' Lavine insists that the studio maintains a hands-off approach to the school ' s curriculum . Indeed , much of the impetus to create Disney-esque animation seems to come from students who view the school as a ticket to a job at the studio . &quot; There are guys ( at CalArts ) who have big Disney stars in their eyes , and that ' s where they want to be . that ' s where they want to go , &quot; says one recent graduate who declined to be named , out of fear of being blacklisted by Disney . &quot; People sometimes do a Disney-looking film because they want to work for Disney rather than take risks artistically , &quot; he says , adding , &quot; Everyone in my class that wanted to go_to Disney went_to Disney. &quot; &quot; Disney has made the most profound investment in carrying animation . . . to the highest level , pushing the field more , so clearly they attract a lot of our best students , &quot; Lavine says . The studio ' s lure is powerful , despite a strict hierarchy and rigid rules that have led some young critics to label it Mouseschwitz . That analogy also extends_to Disney ' s tight grip on its animators , most of whom sign three- to five-year contracts . Rival companies hoping to acquire a piece of the lucrative animation market accuse Disney of monopolizing talent . Sources at Warner Bros. , Turner Pictures and Steven Spielberg ' s Amblin Entertainment -- which will be merged into the new studio being formed by Spielberg , Katzenberg and record mogul David Geffen -- say Disney has unofficially posted a &quot; no poaching &quot; warning to the industry . The implied meaning , they say , is that competitors who don ' t want to sully their relations with Disney would be wise_to keep their hands off contracted Disney animators . Roy Disney says he is &quot; not aware of anything like that , &quot; adding that if there is such a practice at Disney , &quot; I don ' t want to know about it. &quot; Disney often scoops_up fledgling animators halfway through their schooling , taking_advantage of their eagerness to make money after spending $ 14 # 600 a year in tuition . Animators ' salaries have soared as the business has gained momentum in the past few years . The Cartoonists Union minimum for beginners in theatrical animation is $ 800 a week , and higher-level positions command an average of $ 1 # 500 to $ 2 # 000 a week , topping out at $ 5 # 000 or so a week for the industry ' s handful of superstars . &quot; Students are much more job-conscious now than when I was at CalArts . . . . The films are so successful now , there ' s a desire to be part of it , like being part of a winning football_team , &quot; says Larry White , who graduated in 1979 and is currently animating a pug dog character for &quot; Pocahontas. &quot; White , who has worked for Disney on and off for 15 years , says he was referred to CalArts when he applied for a job at Disney in 1976 . White earned a Disney-sponsored scholarship to help pay_for much of his schooling , and he now teaches beginning animation classes at CalArts two nights a week . White is one of the more_than 600 animation artists moving_in November into new animation headquarters on Disney ' s Burbank lot , a move symbolic of the division ' s growth both in size and importance to the company . At the same time , Disney ' s resurrection of the art has more young people wanting to animate : CalArts ' Bitomsky says the number of animation applicants has grown 60 % in the last several years , to 480 in the current school_year . The school accepted 88 . The fact that competitors are starting to lure CalArts graduates hasn ' t dampened the Disney hubris : &quot; Maybe there are kids who would prefer to work somewhere else for a while . And I think probably that it ' s good for them , &quot; Roy Disney says . &quot; Because you find that if you do get_out there to most places that do animation , and then you come_in here and realize what an enormously high standard we have , it ' s a whole new challenge. &quot; Analysts say Disney ' s animated film revenue has grown so high , it will inevitably flatten over the next few years , no matter what the level of CalArts input . Vogel projects that Disney ' s filmed entertainment revenue for 1995 will leap beyond this year ' s estimated $ 3.7 billion and that filmed entertainment earnings for 1995 will pass the $ 1-billion mark , due largely to &quot; The Lion King. &quot; &quot; Now , at this stage of the game , it gets_tougher . ' The Lion King ' was extraordinary in its success , &quot; Vogel says . &quot; There has to be a ceiling somewhere. &quot; The Return of Animation While the contribution by theme parks to Walt Disney Co. ' s bottom_line has steadily waned , from a 64 % share of the company ' s $ 1.23 billion in earnings five years ago to 35 % today , filmed-entertainment accounted_for 21 % of profit ; for the nine months ended June 30 , it made_up 44 % of the $ 1.53 billion in earnings . Walt Disney Co. ' s operating income by business segment , for 1989 and 1994 : 1989 Theme parks and resorts : 64 % Filmed entertainment : 21 % Consumer products : 15 % * 1994 * Filmed entertainment : 44 % Theme parks and resorts : 35 % Consumer products : 21 % ( * For nine months ended June 30 ) Source : Company reports</TEXT>
