   <HEADLINE> CLINTON FLYING TO ITALY -- AND INTO EUROPEAN FEUD OVER NEO-FASCISTS ; POLITICS : EU ALLIES ANGERED BY BERLUSCONI ' S INCLUSION OF CONTROVERSIAL FIGURES IN CABINET . U.S. TAKES A WAIT-AND-SEE TACK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Launching a nostalgic pilgrimage to salute the World_War_II victory over fascism , President Clinton flies today into a swirling , bitter European controversy with echoes from those desperate days half a century ago : Are the political heirs of Benito Mussolini trustworthy partners in a new Italian government ? Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi , a billionaire businessman on the defensive over the inclusion of neo-fascists in his 2-week-old government , pledged anew Tuesday that there is no threat to democracy . Berlusconi reassured a delegation from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles that he would support their call_for the extradition from Argentina of Nazi war_criminal Erich Priebke . &quot; Berlusconi said he was personally committed to see Priebke brought_to trial in Rome , &quot; said Rabbi Abraham Cooper , associate dean of the center and head of the delegation . &quot; I spoke directly about concerns over neo-fascists in government , and I was very satisfied with Berlusconi ' s responses. &quot; Clinton arrives about midnight for his first visit to Rome , a planned-to-the-minute extravaganza that will include talks Thursday with Berlusconi and a meeting with Pope John Paul II . On Friday , the President delivers a major address at the U.S. military cemetery in Nettuno south of Rome . Clinton will honor soldiers who died in fighting after the 1944 amphibious landing at Anzio , one of the savage battles that marked the beginning of the end of World_War_II . On Saturday , the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Rome , Clinton flies to England and continues to France for D-day ceremonies on Normandy beaches Monday . In assaying the new-look government of one of its closest allies , the United States has proved more sanguine about the five neo-fascist members of Berlusconi ' s Cabinet than Italy ' s partners in the European Union . &quot; Berlusconi has been elected . Let ' s see if he knows how to do his job . Let ' s give him a chance and support him , &quot; Clinton told Italian reporters in Washington in an interview televised here over the weekend . The 57-year-old self-made tycoon entered politics in January , led a right-wing electoral alliance to victory in March and won confirmation by Parliament in mid-May . Since then , however , Berlusconi has been repeatedly rebuffed by European partners for the neo-fascist elements in his coalition , and frustrated by allies at_home in his efforts to effectively launch Italy ' s first right-wing government since the war . On Tuesday , in the latest incident , Socialist members of the European Parliament asked conservative colleagues to help bar neo-fascists from joining the assembly after European elections later this month . In Brussels on Monday , Elio di Rupo , the Belgian vice premier and telecommunications minister and the son of Italian immigrants , refused to shake hands with his Italian counterpart , neo-fascist Giuseppe Tatarella , who was making his first visit . So did the Danish telecommunications minister . Berlusconi was attacked by Italian commentators after reportedly telling an interviewer that Mussolini , who invented fascism and ruled Italy as dictator for two decades , had done some good things . The thin-skinned Italian prime_minister now says he was misquoted . Returned to office after more_than four decades as pariahs , extremists among the neo-fascists are in full cry -- to the embarrassment of Berlusconi and Gianfranco Fini , the leader of the neo-fascist coalition member National Alliance . One neo-fascist member_of_Parliament is demanding veterans benefits for soldiers who fought for the rump republic that Mussolini formed in northern Italy after his overthrow in 1943 . Another wants a constitutional prohibition against fascism lifted . To Berlusconi ' s distress , the shrill few have been louder than the quiet-spoken majority . &quot; The National Alliance condemns any totalitarianism and certainly does not propose a model for a totalitarian or despotic state , &quot; Fini told state radio over the weekend . Fini , a slick , 42-year-old professional politician , has made neo-fascism politically acceptable . But he also triggered a storm after the election by declaring that Mussolini was the century ' s greatest statesman . He says he was quoted out of context . Many of Berlusconi ' s ministers are more technocrat than politician , and in the economic and international arenas they are well-respected . Foreign Minister Antonio Martino , a university professor , won high marks on confidence-building visits to Washington and Brussels . &quot; I ' m sure there will be no difficulty in collaboration between Britain and Italy , &quot; British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said after meeting Martino in Brussels . Berlusconi -- who promises a jobs-producing , more efficient government that is based on free-market economics and is able to pay its bills -- asks to be evaluated &quot; on the basis of facts and not on prejudices. &quot; That was an appeal he made again Tuesday in conversation with the Wiesenthal Center delegation , which has been pressing for vigorous Italian action to bring Priebke to trial . The former SS captain has confessed to being second in command of German soldiers who executed 335 Italian civilians , about 75 of them Jews , at the Ardeatine Caves south of Rome in 1944 .</TEXT>
