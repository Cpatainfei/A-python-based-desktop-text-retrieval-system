   <HEADLINE> O.C. MAN JOINS KIA ' S BOARD OF DIRECTORS ; MANAGEMENT : THE KOREAN AUTO_MAKER ' S ELEVATION OF U.S. OPERATIONS CHIEF W . GREG WARNER IS A FIRST IN THE ASIAN CAR INDUSTRY . JAPANESE FIRMS LIKELY WON ' T FOLLOW SUIT , ANALYSTS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a show of faith in its fledgling North_American operation , Korean car_maker Kia Motors Corp . today will appoint its U.S. operations chief to its board of directors . W . Greg Warner , 51 , becomes the first American executive of an Asian car_company to sit on the corporate board , although Ford , Chrysler and General Motors all have executives who are directors of Japanese auto_companies in which the big U.S. car_makers have invested . But Kia -- Korea ' s No . 2 car_maker -- is the first of the 10 Asian auto_companies with U.S. import and distribution units to reach_into those subsidiaries ' operational ranks for new blood . Elevating its U.S. subsidiary ' s top American executives to the board is a good move for Kia , analysts said , but is unlikely to set_off a round of similar appointments by companies like Toyota , Honda and Nissan . &quot; It might make some sense for all_of them to do something like that , but I just can ' t see it starting a trend , &quot; said Chris Cedargren , an industry_analyst with Santa Ana-based Auto-Pacific Group . One of the reasons , Cedargren and other international specialists said , is that Japanese companies in particular have their own traditions for doing business . Jack G . Lewis , a management professor and director of the USC International Business Education and Research Program , called Warner ' s appointment &quot; symbolically tremendous . Kia is respected in Korea for its efforts to manage its international operations well. &quot; But he said he reserves judgment on the effect that a single appointment will have_on Kia specifically and the Asian auto industry overall . &quot; I cannot imagine a large Japanese auto firm looking_to a small young entry from Korea as a model , &quot; he said . &quot; Boards in Japan typically don ' t have outside members. &quot; Many of the large Japanese car_companies ' U.S. subsidiaries also have their own boards of directors . Toyota Motor Corp. ' s Torrance-based Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. , for example , has a 10-member board . A spokeswoman for the company said that group includes nine Japanese executives and one American , Toyota Motor Sales Executive_Vice_President Yale Giesel . Of the eight Japanese car_companies in the United States , five have appointed the presidents of their U.S. import and distribution subsidiaries to their boards -- but all five of those executives are Japanese nationals . Tai K . Oh , a Cal State Fullerton management professor specializing in Asian corporate behavior and personnel management practices , said it is not surprising that it was a Korean company that made the first move to bring one of its American executives into the top policy ranks . &quot; It is characteristic of Korean business , &quot; Oh said , &quot; to need to stand_out . . . . Japanese companies are subtle and like to accumulate strength without making a big splash , but Koreans tend to make a big splash first. &quot; Japanese companies are also more cautious than Korean businesses about bringing people into their inner_circles , he said . &quot; Japanese companies take a long , long_time to make such an appointment . They want to have made a long examination and holistic evaluation of the person. &quot; Warner ' s three years with Kia make him an infant by Japanese corporate standards , Oh said . Warner , a Southern California native and 22-year resident of Huntington Harbor , said he speaks only a_few words of Korean but has had little trouble communicating with Korean executives , most of whom speak at least some English . And he makes_it a rule , he said , &quot; always to use translators , just to make sure. &quot; Warner is a single parent who meshes his business schedule with the task of raising a 15-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son . One of his passions is golf , and that has helped him to bond with executives in Seoul , where the sport is immensely popular . * Warner said the director ' s job will require him to travel_to Korea four or five times a year for meetings . Scheduling conflicts with events in Kia ' s North_American market will keep him from attending every board session , he said . In addition to adding a Southern California perspective to board deliberations , Warner said , he has been told that he will be involved in the company ' s long-range strategic planning and worldwide product planning . Those efforts are directed by the Kia senior management group , which makes_up a sizable portion of the company ' s board . Warner becomes the 55th director and third non-Korean on the board , whose membership includes one executive from Japanese car_maker Mazda Motors Corp . and one from Ford Motor Co . in Detroit . The two companies own small stakes in Kia . Warner , who was told of the appointment several weeks ago , said in an interview that it was initiated by Kia officials in Korea , and that he had not been lobbying for the position . &quot; It came as a pleasant surprise , &quot; he said . As chief operating officer of Kia Motors America Inc. , Warner is the top-ranking American executive of the Irvine-based Korean car importer . The company ' s president , Hong Rae Park , also serves on the Seoul-based parent corporation ' s board . Warner previously held several positions at Hyundai Motor America , the Fountain Valley import arm of Korea ' s largest car_maker . He was chief of operations there in late 1989 when management at Hyundai Motor Corp . in Seoul swept out all_of the subsidiary ' s top American executives after sales fell sharply from the record-setting pace the company established in 1986 and 1987 . Analysts have blamed the late ' 80s sales slump on quality problems with Hyundai cars of that era , along with heightened competition from Japanese and American car_companies in the low-priced niche that Hyundai had dominated since its U.S. introduction in 1986 . Though Warner has not been openly critical of his experiences with Hyundai , he and others have blamed that company ' s early troubles on the Korean parent ' s reluctance to take marketing and product design advice from non-Korean officers in its U.S. operation . At Hyundai Motor America in Fountain Valley , President Dai Ok Chung is also a member of the board of directors of Hyundai Motor Corp . in Seoul , but chief operating officer N . Doug Mazza -- Warner ' s counterpart -- is not . Warner , who worked as an independent consultant for more_than a year before signing_on with Kia , said in an interview then that he discussed the need for close communication between U.S. and Korean officials at great length before accepting the job . A veteran of the auto industry in the United States , Warner began as a marketing analyst with Ford Motor Co . in 1968 after graduating from UCLA and obtaining a graduate business administration degree at USC . He worked in several executive posts at Toyota Motor Sales from 1971 until joining Hyundai in 1985 . He said he sees his appointment to Kia ' s board &quot; as a positive example of how Kia has committed itself to becoming a truly global business. &quot; Since it launched U.S. sales in February , Kia has opened 85 dealerships and sold nearly 8 # 000 cars . The company so far markets only one model , the four-door Sephia sedan , in the United States . In December it will introduce a compact sports utility vehicle , the Sportage . Kia officials said Warner ' s appointment to the corporate board was in part a reward for his intensive 18-month effort to create an entire U.S. operation from scratch .</TEXT>
