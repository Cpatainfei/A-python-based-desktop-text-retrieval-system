   <HEADLINE> ETHICS OFFICIALS DROP LIMITS ON LOBBYISTS ; POLITICS : PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE PROHIBITED CONTRIBUTIONS TO CITY OFFICEHOLDERS . VOTES WERE THERE ON COUNCIL , PANEL CHAIRMAN SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Facing opposition from members of the Los Angeles City_Council , ethics officials dropped a proposal Friday that would have prohibited lobbyists who have a matter before a city agency from making contributions to elected city officials . The ban was part of a long-awaited reform package proposed by the city ' s Ethics Commission to regulate contributions to special officeholder accounts controlled by each elected city official . The decision to delete the ban came as the set of spending limits and disclosure rules moved a step closer to adoption Friday . The Council ' s Rules and Elections Committee voted to support some of the limits and scheduled hearings to consider other elements of the package . Ethics Commission Executive_Director Benjamin Bycel said he decided to drop the ban after committee Chairman Richard Alatorre told him &quot; loud and clear in words that I could understand that it would not pass the committee. &quot; After the meeting , Alatorre said he told Bycel that the ban on lobbyist contributions was not a key change in the reform package and would not win the support of the entire council . He said he did not want to jeopardize the entire reform package for the sake of keeping the ban . Bycel &quot; didn ' t have the votes for it , &quot; Alatorre said . Alatorre added that council opposition to the ban stemmed from the belief some members had that lobbyists should not be &quot; singled_out and treated differently &quot; from other contributors . The amount of contributions from lobbyists vary from officeholder to officeholder but in most cases amounts to less than half of all donations . Although Bycel said the ban was a key measure in the package , he said other changes will give ethics officials more power to regulate the spending of elected officials . &quot; Before we had a 10-watt light_bulb on the activity in the officeholder accounts , &quot; he said . &quot; Now we have a 200-watt light bulb. &quot; The officeholder accounts were created as part of a landmark ethics package adopted in 1990 after a conflict-of-interest scandal surrounding then-Mayor Tom Bradley . Under the current rules , the city ' s elected officials can only use contributions from officeholder accounts_for legitimate governmental or political purposes . But a call_for reform grew , in part , out of complaints that former city Councilman Mike Woo used his officeholder account illegally in 1991 and 1992 to get an early start on his campaign for mayor . Councilman Hal Bernson was the latest elected official to run_afoul of the officeholder regulations when the Ethics Commission accused the San Fernando Valley lawmaker in April of failing to provide adequate documentation on 69 expenditures totaling $ 30 # 905 from his account in 1991 . Bycel and other Ethics Commission officials said they could not act_on either case because the law was too vague . Under the proposed laws , City_Council members , the mayor , the city controller and the city attorney would be able to collect and spend a maximum of $ 75 # 000 a year , an increase from the $ 25 # 000 limit . But contributions from individuals , which had been unlimited , would be capped at $ 1 # 000 annually .</TEXT>
