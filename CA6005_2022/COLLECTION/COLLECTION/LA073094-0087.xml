   <HEADLINE> DOCTOR , VOLUNTEER SLAIN OUTSIDE ABORTION CLINIC ; CRIME : A THIRD_PERSON IS WOUNDED . POLICE ARREST A LOCAL ACTIVIST WALKING FROM THE SHOOTING SCENE IN FLORIDA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An abortion doctor and his volunteer escort were shotgunned to death Friday outside an abortion clinic , 16 months after a similar fatal attack here prompted federal legislation banning violence against such facilities . Police almost immediately arrested Paul Jennings Hill , 40 , a well-known anti-abortion activist , and charged him with two counts of murder and one of attempted murder in the wounding of the wife of the volunteer escort . Hill often demonstrated outside the clinic with placards advocating violence against doctors who perform abortions . &quot; I know one thing : No innocent babies are going_to be killed in that clinic today , &quot; police said Hill declared after his arrest Friday morning a_few hundred yards away from The Ladies Center , one of two abortion clinics in this city . A fatal attack on an abortion doctor at the other clinic last year rocketed Pensacola into the national spotlight , turning a port town that draws military retirees and conservative Christians into what some have billed &quot; the Selma of the abortion-rights movement , &quot; a reference_to the Alabama city associated with violent resistance to the 1960s civil_rights movement . President Clinton and activists on both sides of the issue were quick to denounce Friday ' s attack , which killed physician John Bayard Britton , 69 , and James Herman Barrett , 74 , and wounded Barrett ' s wife , June , 68 . &quot; I am strongly committed to ending this form of domestic terrorism that threatens the fabric of our country , &quot; Clinton said . Atty . Gen . Janet Reno pledged to investigate any concerted movement targeting abortion clinics with violence . &quot; How many_more people must die in these ' isolated incidents ' before these terrorists are stopped ? &quot; the National Abortion Federation said in a statement . &quot; We will not give in. &quot; Flip Benham , director of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue National , said , &quot; We are appalled. &quot; But he added that the killings &quot; reflected the same spirit of murder that exists inside where they are killing little children. &quot; Susan Carpenter-McMillan , a prominent anti-abortion activist in Southern California , said she had talked to Hill four months ago &quot; and found him a tragedy waiting to happen . . . . I can only conclude that not only is he not pro-life , but he has become as of today that which he condemns , a cold-blooded killer. &quot; &quot; Anything short of aggressive condemnation ( of the murders ) will seriously damage the credibility of the pro-life movement , &quot; she said . The attack occurred as the Barretts , volunteer escorts for about a year , arrived_at the clinic with Britton , a Jacksonville-area doctor whom the couple picked_up from the Pensacola airport for his weekly shift at The Ladies Center , a slightly shabby two-story wooden building fenced_in from all sides on the north_side of town . The three pulled_up in the center parking_lot shortly before 7:30 a.m. and before the arrival of an off-duty , uniformed police_officer hired by the clinic for security . Pensacola police said Hill ambushed the trio , blowing_out both windows of the truck and mortally wounding both James Barrett and Britton , who wore a homemade bulletproof_vest . &quot; It ' s not a pretty sight to see two people shot in the head with a shotgun , &quot; said Pensacola Police Sgt . Jerry Potts , who described the faces of the men as nearly unrecognizable . Officers , responding to a 911 call , found Hill walking away from the scene followed by three to four witnesses who waved and pointed at him as the suspected killer . Hill , who had been ordered by police just 40 minutes earlier to pull_up crosses he had planted outside the clinic as part of an early-morning protest , was arrested without incident . Officers recovered more_than a dozen 12-gauge shells from Hill ' s person and a pump-action shotgun behind an oak_tree on clinic grounds , near the Barretts ' truck . Hill , a bespectacled auto restorer and leader of the militant Defense America anti-abortion group , is scheduled to be arraigned today . As he was led to jail , he was seen smiling . The murder_charges leave open the possibility of the death_penalty if he is convicted . June Barrett , who was struck by shotgun pellets in the attack , was taken from the crime scene to a local hospital , where she was in fair condition Friday afternoon . &quot; There ' s no doubt in her mind that Paul Hill was trying to kill everybody in the car , &quot; Bill Caplinger , a fellow clinic escort , said after a visit with Mrs . Barrett . &quot; She ' s proud_of Jim . He was doing what he believed in. &quot; Jeff White , director of Operation Rescue in California , said he was &quot; grief-stricken &quot; by the shootings . He challenged Planned Parenthood officials to meet with him and others in his group to work_out a solution that would allow people to continue to protest but that would prevent future violence . &quot; We ' re never going_to agree on abortion , but we need to meet and work_out what is acceptable protest in California , &quot; White said . &quot; I don ' t want for California what is happening in Florida. &quot; Nancy Dudley , associate executive_director of the Planned Parenthood in Orange and San Bernardino counties , said , &quot; What is really sad is that both sides of the arguments basically want the same thing , and that is to prevent unintended pregnancies , unwanted pregnancies and abortion . &quot; When abortion is needed -- and that is the choice that these women make -- the physicians and people who are providing these services need to be safe. &quot; Friday ' s violence led abortion-rights supporters to worry that doctors will be further reluctant to provide abortions in a region where anti-abortion sentiment , often vocal and sometimes violent , runs high . Pensacola ' s two clinics , now the scenes of the nation ' s only fatal abortion-related shootings , are the only abortion providers between Mobile , Ala. , and Tallahassee , a stretch of several hundred miles . As such , they have been the targets of several demonstrations and attacks in the past , including a firebombing a decade ago that damaged The Ladies Center , which provides first-trimester abortions . Immediately adjoining the center lies a small plot of land owned by local anti-abortion activist John Burt , a triangular lot sporting a statue of a weeping woman and a sign dedicated to &quot; over 26 million babies murdered since 1973 in the American Holocaust. &quot; Scaffolding erected outside the perimeter of the clinic on land owned by Burt also allowed protesters to peer into the center . Britton , the father of five , knew that working_at the clinics posed a risk and often carried a . 357 magnum in his car , according to a recent magazine profile . &quot; I couldn ' t get him to tell me about how he felt about ( the danger ) . Maybe he was scared -- but not scared enough , &quot; Vanita McKinney , Britton ' s companion and nurse for the last 10 years , said Friday from the home the two shared_in Fernandina Beach , about 300 miles from Pensacola . Volunteers at The Ladies Center were shaken by the attack but vowed to continue their work . &quot; We won ' t back_down . That was Dr. Gunn ' s song , and it ' s a good one , &quot; Caplinger said . &quot; I ' m kind of numb . It seems so impossible for that to happen , &quot; said escort Pat Welch . She said protesters are a regular fixture at the clinic , including Hill , who police said was arrested a month ago on a misdemeanor charge for &quot; hollering and screaming &quot; outside the center . &quot; He would smile and say ' God bless you ' and ' God forgive you. ' I never took him seriously , but I knew he was dangerous. &quot; Welch and others described the Barretts as a warm couple , especially James Barrett , a retired U.S. Air_Force lieutenant_colonel who met his wife just a_few years ago . &quot; He was tough , personable , wasn ' t afraid of a thing , &quot; Welch said . &quot; A very strong man . I felt very secure around him. &quot; Down the road from The Ladies Center , Sandy Sheldon , an administrator of Pensacola Women ' s Medical Services -- the clinic where Gunn was killed last year -- said her office was aghast . &quot; We knew that eventually he ( Hill ) would flip out . We were not surprised to hear it was Paul Hill . It ' s hard to believe it has happened again. &quot; Potts of the Pensacola police_force said security would be stepped_up at both clinics today . He acknowledged that police knew of Hill ' s support of violence against abortion providers and that officers closely monitored his activities during the trial of Michael Griffin , who was convicted earlier this year of killing Gunn . But he defended the department , saying Hill ' s constitutional rights allowed him to carry his signs and protest peacefully . &quot; We could not take that right away from him , &quot; he said .
