   <TEXT> Paul Touvier routinely extorted money from Jews and looted Jewish homes as a militia officer in Vichy France during World_War_II , according to court documents read at his trial Tuesday . Touvier , 78 , the first Frenchman to be tried_for crimes against humanity committed during the war , denied requisitioning the homes and property of Jews in Lyons.He also denied extortion charges , made in depositions filed by four Jews soon after the Allies liberated France in 1945 . Touvier said he was a &quot; victim of people looking_for financial retribution after the war. &quot; &quot; They ' re all maniacs , &quot; he said in a raspy , high-pitched voice . &quot; I don ' t agree with anything you ' ve read . It ' s all fiction . ( Those people ) filed suits just to get money. &quot; Touvier ' s memory was uncertain during the proceedings , and he fumbled for words . Touvier , former intelligence chief for the Vichy militia , denied knowing that people were tortured with electricity one floor above his office or having worked with Klaus Barbie , the Lyons Gestapo chief . Presiding Magistrate Henri Boulard led Touvier through incidents leading_up to the executions of seven Jewish hostages near Lyons in June , 1944 , under the Vichy regime that collaborated with the Nazis . Touvier is accused of ordering the executions . He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for murder .</TEXT>
