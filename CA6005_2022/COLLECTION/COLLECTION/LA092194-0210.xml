Mike Synar lost a Democratic runoff Tuesday to a little-known retired school_principal , becoming the third incumbent this year to lose a congressional primary_election . In Massachusetts ' primary , W . Mitt Romney , son of former Michigan Gov . George Romney , easily won the GOP nomination to challenge Democratic Sen . Edward M . Kennedy . State Rep .

Jack Mildren won a Democratic runoff for governor . In Washington state , voters chose candidates to challenge GOP Sen . Slade Gorton and House Speaker Thomas S . Foley , a Democrat . In Oklahoma ' s 2nd district , Virgil Cooper had 47 # 798 votes , or 51 % , to 45 # 189 votes , or 49 % , for Synar with 100 % of precincts reporting . Cooper acknowledged that some of his votes were protests against Synar , who has been criticized in his rural northeastern Oklahoma district of ranchers and farmers for supporting many of President Clinton ' s policies . &quot; People would grab your hand and you would tell them you ' re running against Mike Synar . They would say ' You ' ve got my vote , ' &quot; Cooper said . Synar , an eight-term congressman , was forced into the runoff after failing to get a majority of the vote_in the Aug . 23 primary .
