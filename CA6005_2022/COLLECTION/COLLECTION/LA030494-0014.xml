   <HEADLINE> THEATER BEAT : COLD_WAR IS HOT AGAIN IN ' PACK OF LIES '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wasn ' t it just yesterday that we celebrated the Berlin Wall ' s demise ? Or was it just yesterday that Aldrich H . Ames sold Central_Intelligence_Agency secrets to Moscow ? The Cold_War is hot again , but timing isn ' t what transforms the Actors Co-op ' s impeccable revival of Hugh Whitemore ' s 1983 espionage drama , &quot; Pack of Lies , &quot; into such a spellbinding experience . Like John Le Carre ' s novels , Whitemore ' s play is more_than a mere spy thriller . And it ' s much more_than a simple story of an ordinary family exploited by counterintelligence agents in the cause of national security . It examines the nature of deceit , of how suspicion mutates into a dangerous psychological obsession . It asks a timeless question : &quot; What ' s the difference between one lie and another ? &quot; Just as in classic Greek tragedy , global political struggles become family feuds . Based on a true story , &quot; Pack of Lies &quot; is set_in 1960s England . To tabloid journalists , this Jackson family might seem tediously normal . Scandal is spilled tea , adventure a teen-ager ' s forbidden motorcycle ride . Civil servant Bob ( a superbly repressed Alan Johnson ) likes a spot of tea after work . His wife , Barbara ( an extraordinary Kristina Lankford ) , likes to pour his tea . Their daughter , Julie ( Jennifer Manasseri , miscast ) , is obedient , cheerful and unassuming . Their best_friends , the Krogers , live across the street and occasionally drop_by . That friendship ultimately ends the Jackson ' s domestic tranquillity . But are neighbors &quot; Auntie Helen &quot; ( a richly ambiguous Sarah Rush ) and her spouse ( David Schall , equally mysterious ) the problem ? Or are the_British Secret_Service insinuations causing the damage ? Discretions grow_into deceptions . Being friendly at Christmas &quot; adds_to the pattern &quot; of suspicion . Gradually , every innocent exchange appears freighted with ominous meaning , every simple word sounds like a potential lie . Director Mark Henderson mutes the potential melodrama , subtly maintaining suspense around habitual routine . The production design is the equal of any Equity contract production . Tim Farmer ' s realistic kitchen and living room , Russell Pyle ' s suggestive lighting , and Alan Falkner ' s sound_effects combine with a first-class ensemble to change the intimate Crossley Theatre into a house of secrets . * &quot; Pack of Lies , &quot; Crossley Theatre , 1760 Gower St. , Hollywood . Fridays-Saturdays , 8 p.m. ; Sundays , 2:30 p.m. Ends March 27 . $ 7- $ 12 . ( 213 ) 964-3586 . Running time : 2 hours , 30 minutes . ' Hero in the House ' Juggles Two Genres For an act-and-a-half of &quot; Hero in the House , &quot; playwright Brenda Krantz and director Chris DeCarlo successfully juggle genres . There ' s the marriage-in-trouble sitcom as emerging feminist wife ( a compelling Suzanne Ford ) is bored with her sofa-salesman spouse ( Lee Ryan , brave in a weakly written role ) . There ' s the farce , as Napoleon Bonaparte returns from the Land of the Dead to help hubby regain command over the family . And there ' s even romantic comedy , as the resurrected Emperor courts the wife . But just before reaching the climax , the Santa Monica Playhouse ' s fascinating artistic juggling act suffers a terrible accident : It tries to make_sense of the nonsense . Until the futile attempt to inject significance , we ' ve been entertained in the manner of contemporary spoofs like &quot; I Hate Hamlet. &quot; Such a silly concept can provoke opportunity for outrageous comedy , as in a seduction scene where Napoleon ' s fetish for women ' s feet is uproariously spoofed . But taking this silliness seriously provokes embarrassment , not epiphanies . Not even droll Nicholas Cascone ' s convincing portrait of Napoleon can defeat New Age cliches about our inner child . &quot; Strong men express feelings &quot; is both the play ' s message and its Waterloo . * &quot; Hero in the House , &quot; Santa Monica Playhouse , 1211 4th St. , Santa Monica . Thursdays-Saturdays , 8 p.m. ; Sundays , 7:30 p.m. Ends April 10 . $ 16.50- $ 18.50. ( 310 ) 394-9779 , Ext . 1 . Running time : 2 hours . Ghost World ' Fails to Haunt James McClure must have a severe case of writer ' s block . How else are we to understand his latest effort , &quot; Ghost World : The Coincidence &quot; ? A funny yet disturbingly derivative park-bench play , &quot; Ghost World &quot; resembles one of those glib warm-up exercises designed to oil the writer ' s lamp before undertaking more serious work . It may be McClure ' s homage to Samuel Beckett ' s &quot; Waiting for Godot , &quot; but even at a mere 45 minutes the waiting feels repetitive . Yet McClure is lucky at Theatre / Theater where &quot; Ghost World &quot; gets salvaged by exquisite acting and Jeff Murray ' s precise direction . Will Utay portrays a successful playwright-screenwriter in Central_Park trying to enjoy lunch while being shadowed by an absurd stranger in a ludicrous Day-Glo outfit . The stranger turns_out to be Jackie Jack the Sturgeon King , a half-written character from one of his unfinished plays . Ritchie Montgomery brings Jack vividly to life with lunatic comic expressions . It ' s a treat to watch Utay and Montgomery Ping-Pong lines , but &quot; Ghost World &quot; is a sporadic hoot that fails to haunt . The evening ' s curtain-raiser is a minor sketch by Utay called &quot; The Agent. &quot; It , too , has its comic moments , thanks to the fierce performance by Howard George as an actors agent . It , too , is soon forgotten . * &quot; Ghost World : The Coincidence , &quot; and &quot; The Agent , &quot; Theatre / Theater , 1713 N . Cahuenga Blvd. , Hollywood . Fridays-Saturdays , 8 p.m. ; Sundays , 7 p.m. Ends April 3 . $ 10 . ( 213 ) 469-9689 . Running time : 1 hour , 10 minutes . ' Doubt ' Questions World of Artists Those who witnessed the sensationally hyped 1989 staging of &quot; Once in Doubt &quot; at Los Angeles Theatre Center should be gratified by its latest revival . A spare production at the Nancy Silverman Gallery emphatically eliminates any lingering doubts about Raymond J . Barry ' s piece . Under Maria O ' Brien ' s energetic direction , a trio of charismatic actors provides convincing proof of the play ' s staying power . Robert Scott Brush is the self-destructive artist struggling with the creative process . A devout abstract expressionist , he takes Jackson Pollock ' s drip-painting method to its logical dead_end : splashing blood from his cut wrist over the canvas . Eleanor Joy Lind is the artist ' s accomplice , the wife whose rage somehow fuels his work . Michael Rollinson is the unsuspecting neighbor lured into the loft by their seductive games . Their repartee is fast , funny and demented , yet still manages to provoke serious questions about the art world . * &quot; Once in Doubt , &quot; Nancy Silverman Gallery , 1009 N . Madison Ave. , Los Angeles . Fridays-Saturdays , 8 p.m. Ends March 14 . $ 7 . ( 213 ) 644-0955 . Running time : 1 hour , 40 minutes . Griffin ' s ' Voices ' a Feminist Classic Showcase theater has gotten a bad rap , automatically receiving dismissive comments from both theater professionals and critics . But sometimes unapologetic showcase work provides valid and valuable exposure to otherwise neglected plays and players . Case_in_point : a visiting production at the West Coast Ensemble of Susan Griffin ' s &quot; Voices. &quot; You know instantly why this show exists with a glance at the program . No biography of the playwright can be located . But there is extensive background information on each of the five actresses and the director , as well as a telephone_number &quot; for industry comps. &quot; And yet none of that matters because Griffin ' s poetic examination of women ' s issues is a neglected feminist classic that rewards repeated viewings . The text reverberates like a musical quintet as the characters speak directly to the audience about their lives , weaving in-and-out of each other ' s stories , sewing a quilt of language . This difficult sound collage requires a director with a conductor ' s touch , and Clair Sinnett orchestrates the voices with radio drama precision . The ensemble never misses a vocal beat and each actress deserves to be mentioned : Jody Carter , Sharon Corbett , Michelle Mikesell , Penny Peyrot , Anita Swanson . But so does the playwright . After all , it ' s the show that best makes their case . * &quot; Voices , &quot; West Coast Ensemble , 6240 Hollywood Blvd. , Hollywood . Mondays-Wednesdays , 8 p.m. Ends March 16 . $ 12 . ( 213 ) 871-1052 . Running time : 1 hour , 30 minutes .</TEXT>
