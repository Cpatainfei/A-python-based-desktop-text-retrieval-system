   <HEADLINE> ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH : EXECUTIVE TRAVEL ; LAPTOP_COMPUTERS NEED TLC ON THE ROAD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Portable_computers are standard luggage for many executive travelers . Yet despite their image as equipment you can use anywhere -- whether perched on a rock overlooking a river or inside a cramped airplane -- portables need some special handling to make_sure they don ' t break_down on_the_road . For one thing , repairing a laptop may be expensive . Desktop_computer parts are readily available even for the more obscure brand names , but portables do not have easily exchangeable parts . And in some cases , the parts most easily broken may cost as much as the entire computer . Here , then , are some first-aid and prevention tips for people who take laptops or notebook-type computers on_the_road . * Make_sure the computer ' s carrying case has adequate padding . The most common way computers are damaged is by being dropped , said Rich Malloy , editor in chief of Mobile Office , a magazine for business_travelers . &quot; You don ' t have to drop them too far ; even a_few inches can cause problems , &quot; he said . Aside from electronic component failures , damage to screens from dropping or bumping is the No . 1 cause of repair calls , said Jaime Fidalgo , sales manager for Man &amp; Machine , a Bethesda , Md.-based company that specializes in portable-computer repairs . But what many people don ' t realize is that replacing the screen on some of the newer models can cost $ 2 # 000 to $ 3 # 000 -- as much as the whole computer , Fidalgo said . &quot; Many people will spend $ 2 # 000 , $ 3 # 000 or even $ 5 # 000 on a nice computer , but don ' t want to spend more_than $ 30 on a bag to protect it , &quot; he said . &quot; But it ' s worth the extra little bit of money to get more padding. &quot; Dropping a computer can also loosen internal connectors , and although this is a pretty simple thing to repair , most computer_experts advise against trying to tighten them yourself . Most laptops are not designed to be opened and worked_on by amateurs , Malloy said . Whereas the components inside a desktop_computer are fairly easy to reach , in a portable there is so_much crammed into so little space that people risk being shocked or damaging the components by trying to fiddle_with the insides . * Don ' t expose the computer to temperature extremes . Travelers often make the mistake of leaving their computers in their rental cars on hot days . Intense heat can cook a computer , damaging components or screens , which are extremely sensitive to temperature . Cold can be just as bad ; it can cause a screen to crack . And fluctuations from high_temperature to low_temperature can lead to condensation inside the computer , another cause of damage . &quot; The solution is to keep the computer with you , &quot; Malloy said . On a cold day , don ' t put it in the trunk . Keep it in the passenger seat . And when it ' s hot , take it into the building with you when you leave the car. &quot; When a computer is operating , its tolerance for temperature variation is even lower . If the computer has become very hot or cold , let it come_back to room_temperature before you turn it on , Malloy said . Similarly , if you see any condensation , let the computer dry_out for at least 24 hours before using it , he said . Even when you ' re using the computer at room_temperature , check periodically to make_sure it isn ' t overheating . If the underside of the unit feels hot to the touch , turn it off and let it cool_down , Malloy said . Most laptops lack the internal fans that desktops have , so make_sure the computer has enough space around it to allow_for good ventilation . * Avoid airport metal detectors . Many travelers are unduly concerned about the X-ray_machines at airports , but these pose no problem , Fidalgo said . Of greater concern are metal detectors . The detectors sometimes contain very powerful magnets , Malloy said . The magnetism can damage floppy_disks , so send any disks you ' re carrying through the X-ray_machine along with the computer . * Be careful not to spill liquids on the computer or keyboard . Because business_travelers use their laptops in a variety of locations , such_as airplanes and restaurants , they are at greater risk for getting things spilled on them . The best thing to do for a spill is sponge_up what you can , then let the unit air for a day to make_sure it dries , Malloy said . Don ' t apply heat to try to dry it out more quickly . If the spill was juice or a drink containing sugar , get the computer serviced as soon as possible to make_sure there is no residue that could interfere with operation . * For overseas trips , buy a transformer to use with an alternating-current adapter . Though many portables come_with auto-sensing AC adapter devices so they can be plugged directly into a wall , voltage regulation in other countries is not always as_good_as it is in the United States . As a precaution , Fidalgo recommends buying an inexpensive transformer , called a &quot; step-down &quot; or &quot; step-up &quot; transformer , because it either raises or lowers the voltage coming from the wall outlet to ensure an even power supply . ( Which one you use depends_on the power sources for that country. ) These devices , which usually cost about $ 15 , act_as fuses . If anything goes_wrong with the power supply , the transformer will blow , not the adapter . Adapters cost between $ 100 and $ 175 to replace , Fidalgo said . * Take the usual precautions regarding computer viruses and backup_files . Travelers should make_sure their antiviral software is up_to date in case a client or friend wants to try_out new software , which could contain viruses . Though it is often less convenient to make backup disks while traveling , this precaution is vital in protecting the work being done . * Carry an extra battery . Despite what some manufacturers ' specifications indicate , many batteries last only a_few hours . Also , carry a battery-charger adapter so you can recharge batteries at your destination . An extension_cord will also be handy if the phone and wall outlets are not conveniently near each other . One more word on batteries : A portable battery discharges rapidly , so make_sure you charge it just before you leave .</TEXT>
