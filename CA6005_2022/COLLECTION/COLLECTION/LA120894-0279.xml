   <HEADLINE> ASIAN FAMILIES INCREASINGLY BECOMING TARGETS OF ROBBERS ; CRIME : IN ONE INCIDENT , FIVE RELATIVES ARE HELD CAPTIVE IN HOME AS THIEVES TAKE CAR AND $ 20 # 000 IN VALUABLES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The strangers at the door asked_for her cousin Jae by name , so Connie let them in . Moments later , she and Jae were_on the floor , duct tape over their mouths , as armed thieves rifled through the house , tearing drawers from bureaus and ripping paintings from the walls and shouting_out demands , &quot; Where ' s the money ? &quot; &quot; Where ' s the jewels ? &quot; &quot; They thought we had money in our pillows , in our mattresses , because we are Asian , &quot; 21-year-old Jae recalled in an interview Wednesday . He asked that his family ' s last_name not be printed . Jae said the robbers captured three other family members as they came_home during the hourlong takeover Monday afternoon . They then locked the family in a bedroom closet and drove_off in Jae ' s black 1994 Honda Accord . Police say home takeover crimes are becoming an increasing hazard for Asian families in the San Fernando Valley , although they are not as prevalent as in the San Gabriel Valley . &quot; As you get more Asians in the Valley . . . they are being targeted , &quot; said Los Angeles Police Detective Jim Tiampo of the department ' s Asian Crimes Task_Force . Police believe that the four men and one woman who robbed Jae ' s home_in the 15400 block of Lassen Street are Asian gang members , Tiampo said . The gangs usually rob for money , targeting Asian families who &quot; traditionally keep cash or jewelry &quot; at_home , he added . The thieves frequently rehearse the actual heist , Tiampo said , and occasionally date girls who live_in the house to scout for valuables . When they strike , they typically hold residents at gunpoint , sometimes pistol-whipping their victims into submission . The family robbed Monday was more fortunate than many because no one was harmed , police say . Jae and Connie were put_in a closet , along with their aunt and cousin who were met at gunpoint when they came_home . An uncle , in his 60s , also came_home at that time . When robbers could not fit him in the closet , they bound and gagged him , then left him under a blanket . The thieves took about $ 20 # 000 in valuables , telling the family not to call police for an hour . The family escaped by breaking_down the closet door . The bandits took Jae ' s Accord , license_plate 3HPR124 . Tiampo says the thieves are most likely from outside the Valley . &quot; These guys are predators ; they will go_out of town to do their crime , &quot; he said . Jae was still stunned at the robbery as he sat Wednesday in his living room , which overlooks busy Lassen . &quot; It was in broad daylight , &quot; he said . The family had just moved to the house from Granada Hills in August . &quot; I would hope my parents move to a condominium or an apartment_building , &quot; Jae said . &quot; Those seem just safer , security-wise . A home is so open. &quot; LOS ANGELES COUN</TEXT>
