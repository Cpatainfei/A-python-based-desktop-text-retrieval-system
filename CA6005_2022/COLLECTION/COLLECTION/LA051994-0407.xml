   <HEADLINE> TOBACCO FIRM PAID $ 950 # 000 TO PLACE CIGARETTES IN FILMS ; MOVIES : COMPANY PAID ACTORS IN CASH , CARS OR JEWELRY IN EARLY ' 80S , MEMOS SAY . INDUSTRY SAYS IT HAS HALTED PRACTICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> SEE APPENDED STORY * Internal memos say that Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp . spent more_than $ 950 # 000 in a span of four years to feature its cigarette brands in more_than 20 movies--including payments of at least $ 300 # 000 to action film_star Sylvester Stallone . The payments took the form of checks , cash and merchandise -- including jewelry and automobiles for such stars as Paul Newman , Sean Connery and Stallone -- over the years 1979 to 1983 , the documents say . Product placement , which involves payments for display of brand-name merchandise in films , is a legal and potentially large source of revenue for filmmakers . But use of the practice by tobacco companies drew harsh criticism in Congress and from health activists in the late 1980s . Critics charged that the tobacco companies were making an end-run around federal laws that require warning labels on cigarette ads and banish tobacco ads from television , where many feature_films eventually appear . According to Brown &amp; Williamson spokesman Tom Fitzgerald , the nation ' s No . 3 cigarette manufacturer--which makes Kool , Barclay and other brands--halted the use of product placement agreements several years ago . Tobacco foes believe that the practice continues in the industry , citing what they consider an otherwise inexplicable rise in smoking scenes in films and television . Among the papers , recently leaked to anti-smoking leaders in Congress and several news organizations , is an April 28 , 1983 , letter signed by Stallone in which he agrees for a fee of $ 500 # 000 to &quot; use Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco products in no less than five feature films. ' A spokeswoman said Stallone had no comment . Jim Bergman , executive_director of the anti-smoking group STAT--which has accused tobacco firms of using movies to hook young smokers--said Wednesday that the revelations are dramatic . &quot; It ' s purposely putting advertising in the movies but pretending that it ' s not advertising , knowing that the movies that Sylvester Stallone is in appeal_to children and youth more_than anyone else , &quot; Bergman said . In 1989 , then-Rep . Thomas A . Luken ( D-Ohio ) conducted hearings on the use of product placement deals by tobacco firms . In the biggest expenditure disclosed during Luken ' s inquiries , Philip Morris said its Tokyo-based advertising_agency had paid $ 350 # 000 to showcase Lark cigarettes in a James Bond film that was to run in Japan . But the placement effort described in the Brown &amp; Williamson documents is the most extensive and costly ever to come_to_light . The papers include a 1983 audit of the tobacco company ' s agreement with Associated Film Promotions , a now-defunct Los Angeles product placement firm . According to the audit , Associated Film ' s records showed that &quot; they have attempted to make placements for B &amp; W in over 150 movies or television_shows and have succeeded in making placements in 22 movies and one television show. ' The report said B &amp; W was paying Associated Film a $ 30 # 000 quarterly retainer in 1983 and had paid a total of $ 278 # 000 in retainer fees since their relationship began in mid-1979 . According to the report , B &amp; W spent an additional $ 687 # 000 for ' special placements &quot; arranged by Associated Film in a variety of movies--including $ 100 # 000 apiece for &quot; Where the Boys Are &quot; and &quot; Harry &amp; Son , &quot; both 1984 releases , and $ 50 # 000 for the Clint Eastwood picture ' Killing Ground , &quot; released in 1983 as &quot; Sudden Impact. ' About $ 300 # 000 of the special placement monies went_to Stallone as part of the five-picture deal worth $ 500 # 000 , the documents said . Among the Stallone films in the deal , according to the documents , were ' Rhinestone Cowboy , &quot; ' Rocky IV &quot; and &quot; Rambo , &quot; which was released as ' Rambo : First Blood Part II. ' The documents suggest that B &amp; W officials were not sure they were getting their money ' s worth , after sitting_down to view seven films in which their brands were to be featured . In &quot; Body Heat , &quot; the blurred image of a Kool poster appeared three times , but two lead characters were &quot; observed . . . smoking Marlboro--industry leader Philip Morris ' flagship brand--throughout the film , the report said . It was the same story with &quot; Only When I Laugh. &quot; That film included &quot; a blurred pack of Kool , &quot; but &quot; the lead character . . . smoked Marlboro throughout the movie. ' Tobacco executives also discovered that in some cases , Associated Film was not paying with &quot; checks to individuals &quot; because movie producers ' prefer cash , jewelry , cars , etc. ' For example , the report said , Associated Film ' s records showed that of $ 20 # 000 paid_for placement in the James Bond film , &quot; Never Say Never Again , &quot; $ 12 # 715 was spent on &quot; jewelry for Sean Connery. ' The $ 100 # 000 purportedly paid_for placement in &quot; Harry &amp; Son &quot; included $ 42 # 307 for a &quot; car for Paul Newman , &quot; the documents said . And of $ 50 # 000 listed for the film that became &quot; Sudden Impact , &quot; $ 22 # 047 was said to have been spent on a &quot; car for Clint Eastwood , &quot; according to the audit . Spokesmen for Connery and Newman did not return phone_calls seeking comment . A spokesman for Eastwood said the audit entry had to be a mistake . &quot; He didn ' t receive a car , &quot; the spokesman said . Robert Kovoloff , a public relations man and former president of Associated Film , declined to discuss the documents . &quot; I have nothing to do with this right now . My answer is I have nothing to say. ' Several tobacco companies told Luken in 1989 they no longer paid filmmakers to feature their brands , but had done so in the past . A year later , cigarette firms wrote a prohibition on placements into the industry ' s voluntary advertising code , according to an official with the Tobacco Institute . The code states that tobacco companies will &quot; not . . . engage in paid movie product or cigarette advertising placements. ' The practice remains common among other makers of consumer goods . One current release , &quot; Major_League II , &quot; includes prominent displays of at least eight recognizable brand names . ---- START OF APPENDED STORY ---- Tobacco Pitchman Agrees Stars Did Not Receive Gifts Cigarettes : Brown &amp; Williamson documents outlined payments . Middleman says information is bogus . By MYRON LEVIN , TIMES STAFF WRITER * Originally published : Los Angeles Times -- Tuesday June 14 , 1994 , Home Edition , Part A , Page 1 , Column 5 , Metro Desk ; 30 inches , 1046 words * Paul Newman did not get a Mercedes . Bob Kovoloff did . Kovoloff , of Encino , ran a nearly $ 1-million campaign in the early 1980s to place Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co . brands in feature_films . His Associated Film Promotions , then among Hollywood ' s most prominent product-placement firms , often eschewed written deals with studios , claiming to rely instead on lavish gifts to members of movie casts and crews . Drawing_on internal documents leaked from B &amp; W to members of Congress and news organizations , The Times reported last month that Newman , Clint Eastwood , Sean Connery and Sylvester Stallone , among others , supposedly got expensive jewelry , cars and other items , purchased by Associated with B &amp; W ' s money . But those reports prompted indignant denials by some of the celebrities . And now , challenged on the details , Kovoloff--a pioneer product pitchman who has faced dozens of lawsuits over his business dealings--says that many of the goods never reached the stars . Sean Connery &quot; never got any jewelry , &quot; he said in a telephone_interview last week . &quot; Paul Newman never got a car . Sylvester Stallone never got a car . Clint Eastwood never got a car . They never got a thing from me. ' Although a B &amp; W audit in 1983 listing the gifts said it relied exclusively on records provided by Kovoloff ' s firm , Kovoloff last week called the listing bogus , denied furnishing the information and said he did not know where it came from . Confusion over how the money was spent was not his doing , Kovoloff insisted . &quot; A lot of ( stuff ) could have been made_up , &quot; he said . Kovoloff declined further comment , and did not return additional phone_calls from The Times . There is no doubt that Brown &amp; Williamson set out--years after Congress barred tobacco firms from advertising on television and radio--to buy display for its products in motion_pictures . But in selecting Kovoloff as its Hollywood pitchman , B &amp; W got fewer results than it hoped for . The product-placement effort &quot; in our view was a failure , &quot; acknowledged B &amp; W spokesman Tom Fitzgerald . &quot; It was not an effective use of our marketing dollars. &quot; Fitzgerald declined to comment on the audit--conducted by B &amp; W to ascertain how its money was being spent by Kovoloff ' s firm--or on Associated ' s use of the tobacco firm ' s money . * Kovoloff , 57 , is no stranger to disputes over property and money . During the 1980s and early ' 90s , he and his companies faced a torrent of lawsuits from angry clients , landlords and employees--a legal onslaught checked only by his bankruptcy filing in 1992 . For example : * Former clients Nikon and Panasonic won court judgments of $ 70 # 000 and $ 349 # 000 , respectively , over expensive photographic and electronic_equipment loaned to Associated as movie props but never returned . In its defense , Associated claimed it was understood &quot; that many of the products would not in fact be returned as that is the custom and practice in the motion_picture industry. ' * After Pizza Inn Inc. , paid a promotional fee of $ 100 # 000 , the firm ' instantly began to be unable to ever locate &quot; Kovoloff , said Jeff Rogers , president of the Dallas-based chain , which was listed as a creditor in Kovoloff ' s bankruptcy filing . * Florida Smoked Fish Co . filed suit against an ad_agency over what it termed an unfulfilled promise of a movie scene in which famished patrons held hostage in a supermarket were to eat bagels and the company ' s fish products . The ad_agency contracted for the placement with a Kovoloff firm . * The Trumbull County Convention and Visitors Bureau in northeastern Ohio won a lawsuit over $ 35 # 000 it paid Associated to promote the area as a film location . &quot; Nothing ever came of it . . . . We would write letters to him , place telephone_calls , and there was no response , &quot; said Darlene Russo , administrative assistant for the visitors bureau . * Kovoloff and his companies also were sued repeatedly by landlords for unpaid rent on office space and luxury homes . &quot; He ' s a deadbeat extraordinaire , &quot; said Ryan Martin , a leasing agent for a Van Nuys commercial landlord who repeatedly sued a Kovoloff firm for unpaid rent . But it is the odd tale of Brown &amp; Williamson ' s campaign to promote its brands in films that has brought Kovoloff ' s bumpy career into focus . In its 1983 audit , B &amp; W said canceled checks and other records showed that Associated had used the tobacco company ' s funds to buy , among other things , a $ 42 # 307 automobile for Newman , a $ 22 # 047 car for Clint Eastwood and $ 12 # 715 in jewelry for Sean Connery . To support the claimed gift to Newman , Associated apparently showed B &amp; W ' s auditors a canceled check for $ 42 # 307 written to Auto Stiegler Inc. , an Encino car dealership . But John Stiegler Jr. , a spokesman for the dealership , said last week that a Mercedes convertible at that price was delivered to Kovoloff , not Newman . Kovoloff subsequently acknowledged he got the car . As Kovoloff also acknowledged , Associated did not buy Clint Eastwood a car from Auto Stiegler , either , despite the audit record . Selling &quot; a car to a celebrity . . . is a big thing to us , &quot; Stiegler said . &quot; I would have known if there was any car going_to Clint Eastwood. ' As for Connery , his attorney stated that the actor did not receive any kind of payment for the placement of tobacco products in movies in which he performed . Another audit entry listed a payment of $ 13 # 000 to David Levy , described as &quot; assistant producer &quot; of the movie &quot; Tank. &quot; But according to the filmmakers and credits , &quot; Tank &quot; did not have an assistant producer--nor any involvement by a David Levy . At the time of the purported payment , however , Associated did pay $ 13 # 000 to a David L . Levy--a real_estate man who had nothing to do with the film . The money was for a security_deposit and two months rent of a West Los Angeles office and warehouse building owned by Levy . The payment was cited in court papers in a lawsuit against Associated--one of several Levy wound_up filing for unpaid rent . * The lW documents also included an April 28 , 1983 , letter to Kovoloff from Sylvester Stallone , in which Stallone agreed for a fee of $ 500 # 000 to &quot; use Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco products in no less than five feature films. ' The B &amp; W audit , prepared several months later , said Associated had received $ 300 # 000 of the funds for disbursement to Stallone . Stallone ' s representatives have declined to discuss the_matter , and it is unclear where the money wound_up . B &amp; W canceled its contract with Associated Film in 1984 . Internal memos show the firm was disturbed by Associated ' s record-keeping practices and didn ' t think it was getting its money ' s worth . Moreover , the cigarette maker had just been hammered by bad publicity over the showing of a Kool cigarette commercial in a Massachusetts theater featuring the G-rated movie &quot; Snow White. ' A memo said Kovoloff and Associated Film Senior_Vice_President James F . Ripslinger were told the deal &quot; was being terminated because of a corporate policy decision. ' B &amp; W ' s parting was more amicable than that of some Kovoloff clients , who sued but were unable to collect their judgments . Collection was stymied by Kovoloff ' s 1992 bankruptcy , which wiped_out debts of more_than than $ 1.5 million to nearly 100 creditors . Despite his seemingly dire financial straits , though , Kovoloff maintained some trappings of the high life . At a court hearing in November , 1990 , involving an unpaid legal judgment , Kovoloff said he and his wife &quot; have nothing . . . . We are as broke as two people can be. ' He acknowledged , however , that his wife was driving a Range Rover . His car ? A Jaguar . ---- END OF APPENDED STORY ----</TEXT>
