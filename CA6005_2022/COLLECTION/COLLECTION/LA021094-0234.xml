   <HEADLINE> NUSSBAUM DEFENDS HIS ACTIONS DURING FOSTER INQUIRY ; WHITE_HOUSE : OFFICIALS HAVE OBJECTED TO PRESIDENTIAL COUNSEL ' S CONDUCT IN THE SEARCH OF CLINTON FRIEND ' S OFFICE AND DISPOSITION OF FILES THERE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Presidential counsel Bernard Nussbaum on Wednesday defended his conduct during the investigation of the apparent suicide of White_House attorney Vincent Foster , saying he was only doing what was required of a lawyer in difficult circumstances . Law_enforcement officials have raised objections to Nussbaum ' s role in the search of Foster ' s office after his death on July 20 , 1993 , the disposition of files found there and the presence of White_House lawyers during questioning of potential witnesses . Nussbaum ' s actions in the aftermath of Foster ' s death are likely to be reviewed by Robert B . Fiske Jr. , the recently appointed special counsel who is investigating Clinton ' s role in the ill-fated Whitewater real_estate and banking affair in Arkansas . Foster was a close friend of President Clinton and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . He handled some of their personal legal matters , including the sale of their interest in Whitewater Development Corp. , a failed Ozark Mountain vacation property venture . Nussbaum ' s actions during the investigation of Foster ' s death contributed to suspicions that the White_House was trying to shield relevant material from investigators , fueling the controversy that led Clinton to reluctantly authorize appointment of the special counsel in January . But Nussbaum , a combative New York lawyer , strenuously defended his actions during an interview Wednesday , insisting that he acted properly and ethically at all times and never intended to impede the investigation or conceal potential White_House knowledge or documents . Police and government lawyers have complained that Nussbaum did not share with them information from files found in Foster ' s office and that he or his staff attorneys sat in on Justice_Department interviews of White_House employees , potentially inhibiting candid responses . Nussbaum disputed those assertions . &quot; We did not interfere with the investigation one whit , &quot; he said . &quot; To accuse me of interference is not to understand the role of the lawyer , the obligations of the lawyer. &quot; He said he had a duty as the President ' s attorney to protect the confidentiality of the Clintons ' private records of their Whitewater dealings , which were removed from Foster ' s office and sent to the Clintons ' personal lawyer , David Kendall of the Washington law_firm of Williams &amp; Connolly . Legal authorities said it is virtually certain that Nussbaum will be called before a grand_jury investigating Foster ' s death and Whitewater under Fiske ' s guidance . The U.S. Park Police , which had primary responsibility for investigating Foster ' s death because his body was found on federal parkland in Virginia , have complained in a still-secret report that Nussbaum did not allow them to inspect the files found in Foster ' s office , sources who have seen the report said . In a 2 1 / 2-hour session in Foster ' s office two days after the death , Nussbaum sorted through his deputy ' s papers in the presence of officials from the Park Police , the Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation and the Justice_Department . Nussbaum placed the documents in three piles -- files relating to official government business , Foster ' s private papers and the Clintons ' personal materials . The Park Police have publicly complained that Nussbaum did not permit them to review any of the papers , making_it impossible for them to determine whether any of the documents would help explain the apparent suicide . Nussbaum said some of the files_in Foster ' s office were the Clintons ' personal_property and could not be turned_over without their permission . Clinton ultimately agreed to yield the files to the Justice_Department and began turning them over last month . The search of Foster ' s office by Nussbaum and two other White_House officials the night of his death also has raised questions . Nussbaum said he was in Foster ' s office , with Margaret A . Williams , the First_Lady ' s chief_of_staff , and Patsy Thomasson , a longtime Clinton associate now on the White_House staff , for about 10 minutes . He said they looked_on Foster ' s desk and on other office_furniture for a note or evidence of blackmail but found nothing . During most of that time , Williams sat crying on the sofa while Thomasson and Nussbaum conducted the search , Nussbaum said . The Secret_Service officially secured Foster ' s office about midmorning the next day . Although Park Police have objected to the presence of Nussbaum or members of his staff during questioning of assistants in his office , Nussbaum said police_officers did not complain at the time and raised their objections long after the fact . &quot; We never cut_off people from asking questions , &quot; Nussbaum said . &quot; This was not a criminal investigation. &quot; He said his staff deals with sensitive matters and a Park Police_officer could have inadvertently raised questions that involved national security or privileged information . Nussbaum rejected suggestions of a parallel between his actions and the insistence by John W . Dean III , counsel to former President Richard Nixon , that he attend FBI interrogations of White_House employees about Watergate . Dean ' s presence at those sessions , which he used to monitor the government ' s investigation for Nixon , contributed to the resignation of Acting FBI Director L . Patrick Gray III , who did not object to Dean ' s presence . The Dean episode should be familiar ground to Nussbaum . He was a senior counsel on the House panel that drew_up impeachment charges against Nixon and in that capacity supervised the work of a young staff_member , Hillary Rodham Clinton . Nussbaum said he disagreed_with a Justice_Department request that the White_House lawyers stay out_of_the_questioning . &quot; But I acceded_to it , &quot; he said . &quot; Most people went_through without lawyers . I wasn ' t happy about it. &quot; * FIRM DENIES SHREDDING : The First_Lady ' s former law_firm denies destroying documents related to the Whitewater Development Corp . A14</TEXT>
