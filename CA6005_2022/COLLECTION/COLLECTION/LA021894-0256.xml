   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : LAGUNA BEACH ; PLAN TO MINIMIZE FIRE HAZARDS OKD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The city is moving ahead on several fronts to minimize future fire risk , including a $ 1-million project to widen and extend the fuel breaks that rim the open space areas of the city . The City_Council voted unanimously Tuesday for a package of proposals to minimize fire hazards , a plan that was praised by most people who spoke at the meeting . Some of the measures will be in place by fall , while others are long-term projects . As part of a larger set of recommendations , the council gave city staff the green_light to inspect all homes next to open space areas by Aug . 1 , a project that could involve as_many as 1 # 800 houses , according to Fire_Chief Richard Dewberry , who presented the plan . &quot; Not that we won ' t lose some houses , but maybe we can minimize the risk so we won ' t lose so many , &quot; Dewberry said . Another proposal that drew support from residents will explore ways to create emergency access_roads in areas that are difficult to escape in an emergency , such_as the Canyon Acres community . &quot; We want to build a safe , defensible community , &quot; one Canyon Acres resident told the council . As part of the effort to minimize fire risks in this city , where more_than 400 homes burned in the October firestorm , the council will hear a staff report March 1 on possible changes in the city ' s building and fire_codes . City_Manager Kenneth C . Frank said it will cost from $ 1 million to $ 1.3 million to improve the fuel breaks but that the federal_government may pay 75 % of the cost . As it has in the past , the city may use goats to clear_away the vegetation , Dewberry said , or it could employ hand crews.LESLIE EARNEST</TEXT>
