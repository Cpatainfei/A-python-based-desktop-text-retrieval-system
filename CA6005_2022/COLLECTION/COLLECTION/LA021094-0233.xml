   <HEADLINE> HENIE SKATED OFF WITH NORWAY ' S LEGACY ON ICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Go figure . Norway , the country that gave the world the original ice princess , Sonja Henie , has no figure skaters entered in the 1994 Winter_Olympics . For people who follow the sport , that is no news flash . Only six Norwegians have competed in Olympic figure_skating since World_War_II , none since 1964 . Henie won a record three gold medals in women ' s individual competition in 1928 , ' 32 and ' 36 and a record 10 straight world championships between 1927 and ' 36 . But she had no impact on the sport in her native_land . Some claim that is because of her purported friendship with Adolf Hitler , who fawned over her . But historians here contend it probably has more to do with the fact that after her competitive career ended she moved to Southern California , where she starred in movies and ice_shows and led a much-publicized lavish , promiscuous life . After becoming a U.S. citizen by marriage in 1940 , she lived_in a Holmby Hills mansion most of the time until her death in 1969 . One of the world ' s first female sports stars , Henie left more of a legacy in the United States , where figure_skating became a popular competitive pursuit for girls because of the exposure she gave the sport . &quot; Every little_girl wanted to be her , &quot; said Carol Heiss Jenkins , who won the 1960 gold medal for the United States . She cited &quot; the fame , the glitter , the way she ' d glide across the ice. &quot; Norway , however , discourages the sport . &quot; We don ' t put money in figure_skating , &quot; said Arne Myhrvold , president of the Norwegian Olympic Committee . &quot; You have to start children when they are 6 and 7 years old . We think it ' s wrong to start sports too early . &quot; If another Sonja Henie shows_up , we will help her . But we won ' t spend the time or money to create another one. &quot; Randy Harvey</TEXT>
