   <TEXT> * * * Mike Henderson , &quot; Country_Music Made Me Do It , &quot; BMG . Henderson ' s debut is refreshingly devoid_of country cliches.A popular studio guitarist , Henderson shows his skills here as a producer , singer and , especially , writer , finding hard truth beneath the surface wit of &quot; Fountain_of_Youth &quot; and tapping classic honky-tonk wish fulfillment in &quot; If the Jukebox Took Teardrops. &quot; New albums are rated on a scale of one star ( poor ) , two stars ( fair ) , three stars ( good ) and four stars ( excellent ) .
