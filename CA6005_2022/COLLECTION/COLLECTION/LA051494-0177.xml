   <HEADLINE> COUNTY MAY SEEK FUNDS FOR PIPELINE STUDY ; ENVIRONMENT : THE FEDERAL DOLLARS WOULD BE USED TO PAY FOR AN INVENTORY OF THE UNDERGROUND NETWORK FOLLOWING RECENT OIL SPILLS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In response to four recent oil spills that fouled local wetlands and rivers , the Ventura County Board of Supervisors is considering applying for a federal grant to inventory the county ' s lattice work of underground oil pipes and assess the risk of future pipeline ruptures . The staff proposal , to be discussed Tuesday , said Federal Emergency Management Agency funds may be available to pay_for a study of the pipelines , many of which are not regulated by any government_agency . The supervisors ordered staff_members to examine the pipeline issue in December , days after 84 # 000 gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline into McGrath Lake near Oxnard . More_than 200 birds and other species were killed in the December spill , which released at least 2 # 000 barrels of heavy crude_oil from a leaking Bush Oil_pipeline before it was discovered by federal_officials Christmas morning . Since then , smaller oil spills near Piru , Ventura and Santa Paula have raised concerns about the condition , age and location of oil and gas pipelines in Ventura County . Detailed maps of working and abandoned pipelines do not exist , the county staff report said . A database of all pipes , chemical facilities , fuel tanks and hazardous materials sites should be prepared to help assess the risk of future spills , the report suggests . Such a study could cost up_to $ 750 # 000 , officials said . But oil_industry representatives say a study by the county is unnecessary , since pending legislation would require a statewide inventory and risk assessment . &quot; We do not oppose a study ; what we do oppose is a duplicative effort , &quot; said Catherine Reheis , managing coordinator for Western States Petroleum Assn. , which represents about 30 oil_companies . Assemblyman Jack O ' Connell ( D-Carpinteria ) introduced legislation in February that would mandate a statewide pipeline inventory , database and mapping effort . It would also require a study by the state fire_marshal to determine whether regulatory gaps exist . Several state agencies now share regulation of pipelines . The bill is in the Ways and Means Committee , a spokesman for the assemblyman ' s office said . Reheis also questioned the rationale for using federal disaster funds for a pipeline study . &quot; To take FEMA funds and set_up an inventory of pipelines in Ventura County . . . to us is a far stretch , &quot; Reheis said . Supervisor Susan K . Lacey said the county could not afford to inventory the pipelines and other facilities without the federal grant . &quot; There may be some really old lines that we don ' t even know of yet , &quot; Lacey said . &quot; We need to know where those lines are. &quot; State officials who regulate pipelines and respond to oil spills said they see nothing wrong with a county conducting its own inventory , regardless of what the state does . &quot; We aren ' t aware of any county that has done this , &quot; said Pam Morris , a spokeswoman for the state Division of Oil and Gas , which regulates pipelines in oil fields but not the long-haul transport lines . &quot; We believe it is a good idea to develop an inventory of pipelines in high-risk areas. &quot; Oil_companies typically keep records of_their_own pipes , Morris said , but oil spills statewide in recent years have called attention to the need to identify pipes that are at risk of rupture . &quot; We have had problems , &quot; said Department of Fish and Game Capt . Roger Reese , whose Ventura-based unit responded to the recent spills . &quot; We don ' t have an active program to inspect facilities or anticipate spills now . We can use any information . . . to identify where leaks come from when they occur. &quot; But in meetings with county staff_members , oil_industry workers downplayed the danger of future leaks , saying &quot; the risk of future oil_pipeline spills has been overestimated and that existing regulatory requirements are sufficient , &quot; according to the staff report . County staff_members have met with representatives from most of the oil_companies doing business in Ventura County to assess the status of their pipelines . &quot; It probably would be more appropriate to make_sure whatever is done is coordinated through state agencies , &quot; said Chevron Corp . spokesman G . Michael Marcy . Ray Hatch , vice_president of corporate development for Berry Petroleum , declined to comment on the proposal , saying , &quot; I really don ' t know what they ' re looking at. &quot; Hatch said his company is putting_together a comprehensive plan for the Department of Fish and Game , detailing pipeline sites and other data . He said many oil_companies are taking similar actions on_their_own . McDonald is a Times correspondent . Wilson is a Times staff writer .</TEXT>
