   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ' S PRISON BUDGET : WHY IS IT SO VORACIOUS ? ; CORRECTIONS : INMATE INFLUX , HIGH WORKER PAY , LITIGATION AND SOARING MEDICAL COSTS ALL TAKE THEIR TOLL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the nation ' s largest prison system , nothing is cheap -- and as felons by the thousands are sentenced under &quot; three strikes , &quot; the cost of operating this unwieldy system is certain to soar . As it is , salaries are inflated to entice people to work in a bleak , isolated , often dangerous world . The annual state_prison payroll exceeds $ 2 billion . Top pay_for correctional officers equals that of the best-paid big city cops . Food alone runs $ 2.45 a day per inmate , but the grocery bill for 130 # 000 of them will be $ 194 million this year . An unhealthy lot , they will rack_up medical costs of $ 300 million , and doctors will do everything from delivering hundreds of babies to treating cancer . A decade into history ' s most expensive prison building boom , California will spend $ 3.1 billion this year to run its prisons . Around the turn_of_the_century , the prison population and the cost of running prisons will double , if the &quot; three strikes &quot; law is enforced to the fullest , according to the Department of Corrections and the RAND Corp . As voters mull the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative on the Nov . 8 ballot , government experts say the state will be unable to pay_for the incarceration of everyone sentenced to prison in years to come , unless sentencing laws are drastically overhauled . To feed the voracious prison budget , the money will have to come from higher taxes or cuts_in state support for other programs -- chiefly the University of California and California State University systems , according to financial consultant William Pickens . &quot; Billions of dollars will have to go from other budgets just for ' three strikes , ' &quot; said Pickens , a former vice_president at Cal State Sacramento . &quot; The numbers are quite clear , irrefutable. &quot; Craig Brown , undersecretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency , said corrections spending can rise without tax increases . As the state emerges from the recession , more people will have jobs and pay taxes , providing more money for all state operations , he said . &quot; we ' ll probably get more_than our fair share , &quot; Brown said . &quot; we ' ll get 20 % of the growth . But we won ' t get all_the growth. &quot; Even without &quot; three strikes , &quot; records and interviews show , California ' s prison system already is strained : * Growing numbers of inmates arrive with communicable_disease -- nearly a fourth of them have the tuberculosis virus -- adding millions in costs and raising fears that workers will contract disease . * One in five inmates has mental problems or brain damage -- and the Corrections Department has lost initial rounds of two class action lawsuits over care of mentally_ill prisoners . The cost of complying with court_orders could add tens of millions of dollars to the department ' s annual budget . * Staffing levels are among the lowest in the country , although the 23 # 000-member California Correctional Peace_Officers Assn . plans to push for more staff to ensure officers ' safety during the expected influx of more unruly prisoners with longer sentences under &quot; three strikes. &quot; * Although a third of its employees are women , the department has a history of sexual discrimination , receiving more complaints and paying_out more in damages -- $ 2.2 million -- than any other state agency in the 1990s . In August , the department lost a $ 1.3-million sexual_harassment judgment , but it is appealing . Corrections officials are trying to solve the problem by spending $ 1.6 million on training and investigations of sexual_harassment claims . * The department has trouble finding competent officers and professionals willing to work in desolate locales where most new prisons open . Some prisons have scores of vacancies , and wardens have been dismissed at three new prisons over management problems . Chuckwalla Valley prison at Blythe has had four wardens since it opened in 1988 . &quot; The biggest challenge corrections faces is coming_up with adequate experienced , well-trained supervisory and middle-level management staff , because we ' ve grown so rapidly , &quot; Brown said . Corrections administrators try to limit costs by centralizing policies and purchasing among 28 prisons , and reducing inmate programs . But the driving cost remains inmates -- and that number rises almost daily . &quot; If the Legislature takes 20 # 000 inmates , they can have $ 100 million ( back ) and I won ' t say a word , &quot; said Corrections Department director James Gomez . Next year , the nation ' s prison population will reach 1 million , and state and federal_governments will spend $ 21 billion to operate their prisons . California ' s share , $ 3.1 billion , will be $ 1.6 billion more_than Texas and $ 1.7 billion more_than New York , according to a national study . Although California has the largest inmate population , its cost per prisoner , about $ 24 # 000 annually , also is higher than in those states . What follows is a look_at some reasons why California ' s prisons cost so_much : Politicians Political leaders , taking a tough-on-crime stance , are unwilling to shorten or eliminate prison_terms for even nonviolent crimes . The state could save $ 157 million next year by eliminating prison_terms for people convicted of petty theft , drunken driving , drug possession , marijuana offenses , forgery and fraud , according to a Corrections Department analysis . The state could save $ 94 million more by eliminating prison for people convicted of drug possession for_sale . The guards union told a legislative committee that it would support &quot; phasing_out &quot; prison_terms for people found guilty of petty theft . Enough inmates are doing time for petty theft to fill an entire prison . But none of those suggestions surfaced in public_debate . The guards union put its efforts into winning passage of &quot; three strikes &quot; and other anti-crime bills . The Legislature obliged , passing 104 bills lengthening sentences . &quot; An election year is not the most opportune time for criminal justice reform , &quot; said Geoff Long , consultant for the Assembly Ways and Means Committee . Unwilling to cut incarceration costs by overhauling sentencing , lawmakers take slaps at the prison budget . A favored target is conjugal visits . California is one of seven states that allow inmates with good discipline records to have private overnight visits with spouses . As the Legislature approved the prison budget this summer , Assemblyman Dean Andal ( R-Stockton ) , running_for a seat on the State Board of Equalization , won passage of a measure to ban such visits for child_molesters . Savings will be negligible because the entire conjugal visiting program costs $ 3.7 million a year . The most likely outcome will be that other inmates will take the place of convicted molesters who are denied conjugal privileges . Meanwhile , at least five inmates serving time for crimes against children have sued over the issue . Staffing The biggest cost in prisons is salaries -- 66.5 % of the budget . The payroll goes_up one position each time six felons arrive . To fill a single position , the department must hire as_many as five employees to cover all shifts . California ' s staff-to-inmate ratio is third lowest in the nation , the Criminal Justice Institute reports . But California also pays its prison employees more_than virtually every_other state . Chief physicians at a prison are paid as much as $ 103 # 212 a year . Chief psychiatrists earn up_to $ 101 # 832 . Wardens make $ 83 # 748 , 20 % above the national average maximum pay , the institute says . The department spent $ 146.6 million on overtime last year , $ 52 million more_than had been budgeted . It also pays $ 2 # 400 bonuses to entice employees to remain for a full year at less desirable posts -- such_as two prisons in Blythe . Employees who remain a year at San Quentin and Soledad prisons are paid $ 2 # 100 housing allowances . Still , at remote prisons , finding professionals is difficult . Pelican Bay_State Prison in far Northern California was open more_than two years before it had a full-time psychiatrist -- prompting allegations of inadequate mental_health care in a major_suit over conditions there . &quot; Ideally , &quot; said Pelican Bay Warden Charles Marshall , &quot; you don ' t send any inmates in until everything is in place . That wasn ' t reality . The reality was they were coming_in at 300-plus a week. &quot; California ' s force of 15 # 798 correctional officers , or guards , will be paid more_than $ 720 million this year , including overtime . The state pays veteran officers more_than any other state except Alaska , New Jersey and New Mexico . Officers at the top pay step -- and more_than half make top pay -- get $ 10 # 000 a year more_than those in the federal Bureau of Prisons , and 47 % above the national average . After seven years on_the_job , an officer makes $ 44 # 676 a year , plus an annual uniform allowance of $ 530 . That rivals the top pay_for a Los Angeles patrol officer -- $ 47 # 940 , attained after 10 years . With bonuses and overtime , a seven-year officer at Blythe could bring_in an extra $ 16 # 000 , boosting his or her pay to $ 60 # 000 , officials say . Novey of the guards union says , &quot; This profession has been in existence for 135 years and it got the raw_deal for 130 of them . They ' re just catching_up . . . . They just want their just wages for a tough job. &quot; Health_Care California spends more on prisoners ' health and mental_health care -- $ 372 million -- than 36 states spend on their entire prison budgets . The cost will mount fast as more prisoners serve longer sentences and some prisons become &quot; essentially retirement communities , &quot; said Norman Carlson , former head of the federal Bureau of Prisons and a professor at the University of Minnesota . &quot; Prisoners by their very nature are in very poor health . Their medical costs far exceed the cost of incarceration , &quot; Carlson said . The medical system includes a new 75-bed , $ 17-million hospital at Corcoran State_Prison , hospitals at three older prisons , and contracts with community hospitals close to each of the prisons . To control costs , improve care and limit the spread of disease , Gomez created a health services unit . Officials say 1 # 153 inmates are known to carry the human_immunodeficiency_virus , which causes AIDS . But a random study by the state_Department of Health Services in 1988 found that 2.5 % of the men and 3.1 % of the women entering prison have the virus . If that number is accurate , the prison system would have more_than 3 # 100 inmates with the virus . A fourth of the inmates -- 33 # 084 -- carry the TB virus , and roughly 100 inmates a year come_down with TB . Still , treatment costs exceed $ 1 million a year . Some money -- no one in corrections knows how much -- is spent on inmates such_as Raymond Jackson . Jackson , in prison for kidnaping , is one of many inmates who arrive as drug abusers in ill_health . Jackson was placed on kidney dialysis in 1981 at the California Medical Facility , Vacaville . Acting as his own lawyer , he also sued to force the department into giving him a kidney transplant . Doctors balked , saying he was an uncooperative patient who hoarded his painkillers . But in 1987 , after a state appellate_court ruled_in his favor , he got the transplant . At least seven other prisoners received kidney transplants at state expense -- about $ 50 # 000 each -- while Jackson waited five years for his , according to his lawsuit . Jackson ' s case did not end with the operation . He refiled it , claiming that the delay amounted to deliberate indifference to his suffering , and has lawyers representing him . &quot; Once the state takes custody of somebody , &quot; said Antonio Ponvert III , one of the lawyers representing Jackson , &quot; that person is precluded from seeking help elsewhere . . . . As a parent does for a child , you have an obligation to care_for that person. &quot; In 1993 , before &quot; three strikes &quot; was part of the criminal justice lexicon , a study done for the Corrections Department found that 11 % of the men and 15 % of the women in prison had serious mental_disorders . The study recommended construction of new wards and renovation of old cellblocks for an estimated 18 # 000 mentally_ill inmates , as well as the hiring of 520 medical and mental_health staff . The total added cost was $ 122 million -- plus $ 68 million already being spent on mentally_ill inmates . The department began funding the improvements last year . &quot; We are aggressively dealing with it , &quot; said the correctional agency ' s Brown . &quot; We ' re required to provide enough mental_health care to avoid cruel_and_unusual_punishment . We ' re not required to provide Mayo Clinic-level care. &quot; Meanwhile , two prisoners rights lawsuits have alleged that 28 # 000 inmates throughout the prison system are being deprived of adequate mental_health care . If the Corrections Department loses and federal_courts seize control of mental_health care in prisons , costs could skyrocket to $ 300 million a year , said Kyle McKinsey , head of the department ' s health_care unit . &quot; They ' re under a constitutional obligation to provide mental_health care , &quot; said Donald Specter of the Prison Law Office , which is pressing both suits . &quot; However ironic it may seem , state_government isn ' t similarly required to provide mental_health care to you and me. &quot; Litigation California inmates file about 1 # 000 lawsuits a year . Many are bizarre and frivolous . But some are serious , like one brought by the family of Tyler Henderson . Sent to prison at 19 on a second-degree murder_conviction , Henderson , an epileptic , arrived_at Pelican Bay in 1990 . Once there , he and his family repeatedly told the prison that he needed a particular drug to control his seizures , but he did not get the medication and suffered more_than 100 seizures during the next 20 months . Henderson died March 15 , 1992 . The Del Norte County coroner determined the reason to be a grand_mal seizure -- a highly unusual cause of death in a day when epilepsy can be controlled with medication . The department settled the case in 1993 for $ 175 # 000 . Citing inexperienced staff at the new prison as a reason for Henderson ' s death , Jerry Prod , chief lawyer for the department , said : &quot; We didn ' t watch him close enough. &quot; The department settled another death case at the new women ' s prison at Chowchilla for $ 360 # 000 last year . The case involved Diana Reyes , 42 , convicted of assault and drug possession . When medical staff found her four hours before she died in June , 1991 , she was_on a mattress on the floor of her cell , caked with dried feces . The circumstances of her death angered some prison staff . Medical technical assistant Robbie Jean Waters testified in a deposition : &quot; Why was she on the floor , and why was she like this , and why hadn ' t she been seen ? &quot; Prod said the department settled the case because &quot; we thought we had a chance of being held liable &quot; in a trial . In all , the department settled nine medical malpractice cases last year for $ 1.8 million . The state_attorney general ' s office assigns 80 lawyers and paralegals to defend the department against prisoners ' lawsuits . The Corrections Department also hires outside attorneys , spending $ 17 million since 1990 on private lawyers to defend it against inmate and employee suits . The law_firms include several that are politically connected in Sacramento . One is Nielsen , Merksamer of Mill Valley , which has a contract worth $ 480 # 000 . Vigo ( Chip ) Nielsen is Gov . Wilson ' s longtime campaign lawyer . Steve Merksamer was former Gov . George Deukmejian ' s chief_of_staff . &quot; They want to win , so they look_for the most qualified law_firms they can find , &quot; Merksamer said . &quot; We didn ' t solicit this business. &quot; Prod said he was unaware that Nielsen is_active in Wilson ' s political operation . He said he selected the firm because its partners include former deputy attorneys_general who specialize in civil_rights law . The department paid $ 2.8 million last year to outside firms to handle employee lawsuits , many of which involve sexual discrimination . While Gomez has tried to crack_down on sexual misconduct , his agency continues to lose cases in court . In August , a Marin County judge ordered the state to pay $ 1.3 million to Lisa Pulido , who quit her job as a correctional officer at San Quentin after years of harassment . Co-workers and superiors propositioned her , followed her home , even assaulted her , said her lawyer , Pamela Y . Price of Oakland . Pulido ' s judgment was the largest sexual_harassment ruling against the department -- but not the only one . In the early 1990s , the department paid $ 1.4 million in sexual_harassment claims , more_than twice the sum paid by any other state agency . Unlike some states , including Texas , California has avoided court_orders that essentially seize control of major parts of the management of the state_prison system . But California has been the target of class action suits brought_on behalf of hundreds or thousands of inmates . When the department loses , the court_orders define much of how it operates . In the 1970s , high-security prisoners mounted a successful suit charging that conditions at San Quentin , then California ' s highest-security prison , violated constitutional prohibitions against cruel_and_unusual_punishment . Partly as a result of its loss in that suit , the Corrections Department built the $ 240-million Pelican Bay prison , which has an operating budget of $ 83.2 million this year . Pelican Bay also has come_into the sights of prisoners rights attorneys , who have alleged that conditions in its security housing unit , open less than five years and reserved for gang leaders and especially violent inmates , amount to cruel_and_unusual_punishment . Programs In the 1950s and ' 60s , California prisons were renowned for educational and vocational_programs . In 1967 , the state became the only one to pass an inmates bill of rights , guaranteeing prisoners most rights enjoyed by free_people , including the right to marry , correspond confidentially with lawyers , and read virtually any book or magazine . A decade ago , 6 # 500 inmates were enrolled in college courses . But with strained state finances , the Corrections Department abolished college courses for prisoners , and last month , Wilson signed legislation curtailing the inmates bill of rights . It all reflects a basic change in attitudes about the purpose of California prisons . Punishment , not rehabilitation , is the primary goal . As more inmates arrive with &quot; three strikes &quot; sentences , the department will be forced to cut deeper into educational_programs , predicted one prison official involved in educating inmates . The state spends 3 % of its prison budget on education . But more_than half the inmates have less than ninth-grade literacy , and an estimated 17 # 000 inmates are_on waiting lists for prison jobs or education . &quot; While other correctional operations , such_as prison construction and hiring of correctional officers , have been shielded from deep budget_cuts , education has taken a severe blow , &quot; the state-funded Little Hoover Commission reported this year . Said Brown : &quot; We could put everybody in programs , but it would cost another $ 100- $ 150 million . The people who complain we don ' t put enough people in treatment often are the same people who complain that we take too big a share of the budget. &quot; Henry Sianez , 51 , is serving a murder sentence of life without parole at the new prison at Folsom . Incarcerated since 1978 , Sianez took college courses until that program was cut . He used to earn enough from leather work that he sent some money to his wife , whom he met and married while at Folsom . Now , he said , his art supplies amount to paper and pen . &quot; There is no program , &quot; Sianez said . &quot; You have a yard , and that ' s about it . There ' s even a bill to do_away_with weights . A lot of these guys , that ' s all they do . . . . It ' s going_to get_tougher , just like on the streets. &quot; Times librarian Mary Edwards contributed to this article . About This Series Prison building already has become a multibillion-dollar industry in California , and with the &quot; three strikes &quot; law , an even bigger boom is forecast for the coming decades . The Times visited prisons , from the Imperial Valley to the North Coast , and reviewed thousands of pages of public records to examine the state ' s prison construction program , life inside the penitentiaries and issues that already are severely straining the penal system . * Sunday : How tough-on-crime legislation has created a Pentagon-like bureaucracy and generated unprecedented prison construction that has touched all corners of the state . * Monday : A journey through the California prisons system , where the flow of inmates has far outstripped construction of 16 new facilities since 1984 . * Tuesday : With the state planning up_to 25 more prisons by the turn_of_the_century , many communities weigh the potential impact on jobs , housing , public_services and property values . * Today : The cost of keeping the ever-expanding prison system running is being driven higher by the influx of inmates , inflated salaries and health_care costs . Standing_Watch To become a correctional officer , a person must be 21 , have a high_school diploma or equivalency and a record of no felony convictions , no marijuana use for one year and no hard_drug use for 10 years . Recruits must complete a physical_fitness test , a background check , a six-week training course and nine months of probationary duty .
