   <HEADLINE> A WAR SHIFTS ITS GROUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It seems no small coincidence that a trial involving the murder of an abortion doctor is in the news at_the_same_time that clinical tests of RU486 , the so-called abortion_pill , are getting under way . The national controversy over abortion is now in a new stage ; clearly the battle for the hearts and minds of Americans on this question has shifted its ground.The constitutional arguments that once preoccupied courts have receded , and the major political_parties are largely sidestepping the issue . Women in need of abortions and the doctors who provide them are pretty much on_their_own and more_than ever are_on the firing_line . Since 1977 , hundreds of bombings , arson attacks , acts of vandalism and threats have been directed at abortion clinics across the nation . In 1993 the threats became deadly reality when Dr. David Gunn was murdered outside a clinic in Pensacola , Fla . Then earlier this year another abortion doctor , John Britton , was killed , also in Pensacola ; Paul Hill , whose trial began Monday , is charged in the case . Hill represents the anti-abortion movement ' s violent fringe , a collection of individuals committed to choking_off women ' s access to abortions in any way they can , regardless of the law . Their tactics unfortunately are paying_off : 84 % of American counties now have no abortion services . that ' s why the U.S. trials of RU486 -- regarded_as safer and more private than a surgical abortion -- are so important . Approval of this drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could come as early as 1996 . When that happens , perhaps the tug of war over abortion clinics will become moot , and none too soon .</TEXT>
