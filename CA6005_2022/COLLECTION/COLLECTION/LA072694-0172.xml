   <HEADLINE> FOR THE LAND ' S SAKE ; RANCHER IS AT FOREFRONT OF MOVEMENT KNOWN AS HOLISTIC RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the surface , there is nothing out of the ordinary about George Work ' s ranch . Sprawled along the_hills of the southern tip of Monterey County , at the end of an old oil road , the 12 # 000-acre property could be any of the cattle-grazing , oak tree-growing , grain-producing lands common to the area . Except , that is , for the corral made of truck tires , or the barn wall constructed of bales of straw and adobe . Or the wild pigs that , by rooting up the less desirable annual grasses , help the oaks and other native plants flourish . And then there are the cattle that trample the dead grass back into the ground , thereby helping to rejuvenate the soil . These are some of the characteristics of Holistic Resource Management ( HRM ) , a philosophy of environmentally minded land management that is slowly gaining adherents here and in other states . Work and his ranch are at the forefront of this quiet movement in California . HRM was developed about 30 years ago by wildlife biologist Allan Savory of Zimbabwe as a way to halt the degradation of the range caused by traditional ranching and agricultural methods . Practitioners aim to restore the balance of nature , revitalize soils and grasses , and strengthen communities worldwide . This approach , Work said , results in &quot; more ecologically sound , economically viable and socially just &quot; decision-making than traditional ranching methods . Jody Butterfield , Savory ' s wife , estimates that about 600 Californians have had some HRM training through Savory ' s 10-year-old Center for Holistic Management in Albuquerque , N.M. In all , about 7 # 000 people from all 50 states and 28 countries have gone_through the center ' s training_programs . HRM is taking some time to catch_on in large_numbers . And Work is hardly surprised . &quot; It seems that we have a nucleus here attempting to practice it . But it ' s kind of slow , &quot; he said . &quot; . . . The ranching community here is overloaded . We can ' t deal with all_the regulations , let alone a change in our management program . Most people are afraid to change , because they can ' t take the risk . They ' ve taken a lot of risks and they are afraid this is the one that will break the camel ' s back. &quot; A third-generation rancher , Work , 57 , planted his first crop in 1959 . He said his recent land-use decisions have little in common with those made before his exposure to HRM nine years ago . &quot; What we do now is , before we say , ' Chop five acres of trees down , ' there are five or six guidelines we have to follow , &quot; he said , such_as &quot; how is it going_to affect the ecosystem ? &quot; Work was introduced to HRM when a friend told him of a talk Savory was giving_up in Redding . &quot; He had attended Savory ' s school and was very excited about this new concept , &quot; said Work . &quot; I had a lot of respect for this person -- he was a very progressive rancher -- and I thought I may as well go see what it ' s all about. &quot; Work was impressed with what he saw . &quot; Savory said if you don ' t manage your finances , along with your family , along with the environment , you ' re going_down the tubes , &quot; said Work . &quot; It was common_sense . . . . &quot; Work soon attended a full workshop at Savory ' s New Mexico center , and has been immersed in HRM practices since . &quot; If we practice HRM as it is intended to be practiced , we can grow the perennial grasses to feed the cows , and improve the water use and the soil , have oak_trees -- and make more profit to stay in business , &quot; Work said . &quot; When it all begins to work , one doesn ' t have to suffer because of the other. &quot; Kurt Kupper , executive_director of the Environmental Center of San Luis Obispo , likes what he sees in HRM , but wonders if it ' s too late . Part of the HRM philosophy calls_for topsoil to be left untilled . Tilling , say HRM practitioners , kills_off organisms and increases the chance of soil_erosion . &quot; It ' s heartening that ( HRM ) is catching_on , &quot; Kupper said . &quot; But I don ' t know if we have time for it to catch_on . We ' ve lost half of all_the topsoil in the world over the last 100 years. &quot; Yet Work said HRM gives him hope for the future of agriculture , and he is trying to share that with others . In May , he led a workshop at his ranch for about 120 ranchers , environmentalists , conservationists and others interested in HRM . One of those who attended was Jack Varian , owner of a 20 # 000-acre ranch in Parkfield , 10 miles north of Work ' s spread . Varian ' s particular interest lies_in the HRM rotational cattle-grazing techniques . &quot; I ' ve been a rancher 35 years on my own and I ' ve just recently begun to understand grazing , &quot; said Varian , who considers Work an HRM guru of sorts . &quot; Previously , I had done_it like everybody else . I purposely spread the cattle out &quot; throughout the fields . What resulted , he said , was a decline in the highly nutritional &quot; good &quot; grasses . &quot; Cows are like people . They are gourmets . They like to eat the best and leave the worst , &quot; Varian said . &quot; They will selectively graze the best and keep going_back and back and back. &quot; Now Varian rotates the cattle in and out of grazing areas . After the cattle have eaten the better grasses , they are moved to another area , allowing the grasses to grow back . It costs more , Varian said , because he has had to set_up more water wells and storage_tanks , and provide larger supplies of water . But he has come_up with ways to offset the cost . &quot; This year for the first time I ' ve opened the ranch to the public for a fee , &quot; he said , explaining how he leads cattle drives for city_slickers . &quot; It ' s necessary for us to survive . HRM makes you ask questions of yourself . If I ' m going_to stay_on this land and make a living , what am I going_to have to do here ? &quot;</TEXT>
