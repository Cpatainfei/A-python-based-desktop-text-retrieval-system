   <HEADLINE> PANEL TO URGE ENDING BAN ON FUNDING HUMAN EMBRYO STUDIES ; BIOMEDICINE : GROUP IS EXPECTED TO RECOMMEND THAT FEDERAL AGENCY ALLOW RESEARCH ON SURPLUS EMBRYOS . ITS DELIBERATIONS HAVE BEEN BITTERLY OPPOSED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal panel is preparing to recommend that the National Institutes of Health -- the world ' s largest biomedical research organization -- end a 20-year moratorium on publicly funded research on human embryos created in laboratories . The 19 policy-makers , legal_experts and medical_specialists on the NIH advisory panel are not expected to make their findings public until next month . But interviews with several panel members and a report in the journal Science , released today , indicate the group is prepared to lower the barriers to such research for the first time in a generation , signaling a new turn_in one of medicine ' s most bitter controversies . Despite a de_facto ban on federal funding , researchers in the United States conduct hundreds of human embryo experiments every year with no public control or regulation . The work is carried_out at many of the hundreds of U.S. infertility clinics with embryos created through in-vitro fertilization . Researchers experiment with spare embryos created during the course of infertility treatments or with embryos that are later implanted in the hope they will develop_into healthy children . The experiments include efforts to improve an infertile couple ' s ability to conceive a child or to ensure the offspring ' s genetic health . So little is known about the biochemistry and genetics of early human development that for most purposes every human embryo created in the laboratory is an experiment . &quot; We are talking_about creating life , &quot; said Patricia A . King , a Georgetown University law professor who is the panel ' s policy chairwoman . &quot; There is a fine balance between doing something that has scientific merit and is also sensitive to the different perspectives and fears about the beginning of human life . There are concerns about going too far in the name of science. &quot; NIH Director Harold Varmus appointed the panel in January to address the moral and ethical issues arising from research using human embryos in laboratory experiments . The move stemmed in part from an international furor over a team of George_Washington University researchers who asserted they had cloned human embryos . The panel ' s meetings stirred such strong feelings that NIH was obliged to hire security_guards to monitor its most recent session . The panelists , who have received hate mail and numerous threats , are also being sued by an anti-abortion group in Pittsburgh intent_on halting their deliberations . U.S. Rep . Robert K . Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) , in a letter signed by 35 members of Congress , questioned whether NIH even has the authority to revise the federal research guidelines . The federal_government has not funded any research using human embryos since 1973 , when a Nashville University embryologist triggered a political firestorm over the propriety of such experiments by proposing that NIH fund a study investigating the health of human embryos created in the laboratory . The panel is expected to recommend that NIH permit research on surplus embryos created during the course of infertility treatments up_to their 14th day of development . &quot; We fully expect that some of the research will be directed toward treating infertility and that some of these embryos would be implanted , &quot; said panel member Thomas Murray , an expert at Case Western Reserve University on medical ethics . &quot; We would have very strict precautions so that there is a minimum risk . &quot; When you are talking_about implanting an embryo in the hope it will develop_into a child , you have the same moral considerations you have when you ask a parent to consent to research on their child , &quot; he said . The panel is also expected to endorse a new technique called blastomere biopsy , in which a single cell is extracted from a laboratory-created embryo and used to diagnose inherited diseases such_as muscular_dystrophy .</TEXT>
