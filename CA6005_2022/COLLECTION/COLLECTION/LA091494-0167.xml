   <HEADLINE> EPA PLANS TO CLAMP_DOWN ON EMISSIONS IN NORTHEAST ; SMOG : THE AGENCY ' S PLAN WOULD APPLY CALIFORNIA ' S STIFF RULES TO 12 OTHER STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday that it intends to approve California-based low-emissions vehicle rules for the District_of_Columbia and a dozen Northeastern states from Virginia to Maine . If the EPA ultimately approves the plan -- which could include electric_cars -- it would create a much larger market for &quot; California rule &quot; vehicles , likely lowering purchase costs for California drivers . Such broad acceptance could also help California maintain the state ' s mandate , adopted in 1990 , for low-emissions and electric_cars , proponents say . &quot; It is clear from the record that the emissions reductions represented by the petition , and more , are necessary in_order to achieve clean , healthy air across the region , &quot; EPA Administrator Carol M . Browner said in Washington . Browner also announced that the EPA will continue to hold broad-based meetings under the Federal Advisory Committee Act to see whether an alternative plan acceptable to all parties can be forged among battling auto_makers , state regulators and environmentalists . Tuesday ' s announcement came despite strong opposition from big auto_makers , which are pushing to build a separate low-emissions car that would be subject_to less stringent pollution standards and be sold in all states besides California . They argue that virtually the same cuts_in pollution in the Northeast can be achieved far more cheaply under their plan . &quot; We ' re disappointed , &quot; said Jason Vines , a spokesman for the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn . &quot; But if there is any glimmer of hope , ( the EPA ) said discussions will continue on an alternative proposal -- and that ' s ours , and it just happens to be a better one. &quot; But environmentalists had threatened to abandon the EPA negotiations if the agency failed to make by Tuesday the procedural move to declare that it intends to accept the states ' proposal . EPA officials and the states -- represented by the Ozone Transport Commission -- have said that any alternate plan would have to achieve equal or better emissions reductions to be approved . A plan proposed by auto_makers was rejected last year by the states ' commission , which said it did not reduce pollution enough to allow the states to satisfy the Clean Air Act . Like California , the Northeast states must present air_pollution control plans to the EPA by Nov . 15 . As part of these larger plans -- which include pollution sources besides vehicles -- the EPA must approve the current or an alternative proposal from the Northeastern states and the District_of_Columbia by Nov . 10 . &quot; If the EPA adopts the Ozone Transport Commission petition as we hope , it would dramatically increase the market for electric vehicles in the nation , &quot; said Mike Gage , president of Calstart , the public-private consortium attempting to foster an advanced transportation industry in California . While the state represents 11 % to 12 % of the national vehicle market , Gage noted , the Ozone Transport Commission region is roughly 25 % of the market . &quot; There has always been some concern that ( auto_makers ) would intensify the heat if it were only California , &quot; Gage said . Such a large combined market would &quot; obviously be something that car_makers will not ignore , &quot; he said . Daniel Sperling , director of the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies , sees a broader advantage for California if the Ozone Transport Commission proposal is eventually adopted . As in California , the commission_plan is more flexible than federal rules because it sets emissions standards based on fleet averages rather than applying rigid requirements for every model . And this , said Sperling , could bring_down the costs of alternative vehicles -- natural_gas , electric or otherwise -- for California drivers . A broader market &quot; will create more economies of scale , &quot; Sperling said Tuesday . The Ozone Transport Commission_plan also adopts California ' s emissions-trading provisions , which will allow auto_manufacturers to trade pollution credits gained when their fleet averages do better than the standard , or to buy credits when they do not . &quot; Adopting the emission-trading program , &quot; Sperling said &quot; will lead to more cost savings itself and it will provide them with an incentive to innovate. &quot;</TEXT>
