   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : AUSTRIA ; ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE ; NEW AUSTRIAN BIKE PATH OFFERS EASY ROUTE THROUGH ALPINE SPLENDOR AND HISTORIC SITES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 2-year-old Tauernradweg ( Tauern bike path ) in Austria is a bicyclist ' s dream come true . It cuts_across some of the world ' s most mountainous terrain , yet it ' s almost all downhill . It passes_through dozens of picturesque towns and villages , yet it stays almost totally clear of the traffic of daily life and commerce -- meandering instead through Alpine meadows and woodland and along the banks of the Salzach River . And it ' s clearly marked , with signs at every turn , for worry-free riding . The path starts in Krimml , a mountain village at 3 # 400 feet in central Austria , and ends 100 miles and 2 # 000 vertical feet later in Salzburg . While some fanatics ride the route in reverse , I preferred to pack my rental bike , a hybrid -- a cross between a mountain_bike and a street bike -- and gear and take the train from Salzburg to Krimml , a three-hour trip to the west . From there I would let gravity take_over for the four-day return . Although several companies transport luggage and offer guide services to cyclists , I toted saddlebags and invested $ 10 in a route map and book . I ' d booked my hotels in_advance , allowing_for about 25 miles of bicycling a day . ( I carried none of the usual spare tire or repair kit since there were repair services in gas_stations , inns and restaurants along the route. ) When I arrived in Krimml , I realized I had underestimated the impact of altitude ( and , perhaps , jet_lag ) on endurance . Even a test ride around the village left me winded . A 90-minute walk midway up the 1 # 000-foot Krimml waterfall , the highest in central Europe , almost did me in . After dinner -- a local seasonal specialty of fried wild mushrooms -- at the Hotel Post , I sat at my window and watched the lights in the valley fade , one after another . I was exhausted . Undaunted -- and with no other choice -- I took_off the next morning , pushing off from the &quot; Start &quot; sign at the base of the waterfall along the path , which , at this point , was paved . A light mist washed over me as I looked_out past the steeple of the 13th-Century parish church into the cloud-filled valley below . Within seconds , and without pedaling , I was hitting 15 , then 20 , then 25 m.p.h. , as the village disappeared behind me . I braked as I came alongside the bank of the Salzach , whose waters would guide me toward Salzburg for the next four days . As the clouds burned_off , snow-topped mountain_peaks came_into view . From both river banks , meadows stretched to the base of the mountains , becoming nearly vertical as soil hit rock . My fatigue vanished . The Tauernradweg runs_along the northern boundary of Hohe Tauern National_Park , Europe ' s largest , complete with 246 glaciers and 304 mountains over 9 # 000 feet . Ibex and other Alpine creatures run wild . I paused again and could hear the wind in the trees , the birds , small brooks and distant waterfalls . The scents of fresh-cut hay and moist moss hung_in the air . Overhead lay the first of several ruins I ' d spot along the way , the stony outcroppings of the ancient Friedburg castle . I ' d found paradise . The sounds of cowbells jolted me from my reverie , as I made_way for a dozen bovines crowding down the path . A bull with menacing horns glared at my bright red jersey , then thought the better of it . The path carried me through tiny hamlets , some no more_than a_few farmhouses and a chapel . In larger villages , such_as Bramberg , life centered around a small market_square bordered by a medieval parish church , several shops and an inn . Most of the time , however , the path wound through farms and fields . At one point a sign even asked cyclists to close the gate behind them to keep the cows in . It was September harvest_time , and I passed whole families toiling with scythes and rakes , cutting and stacking hay . Husbands and wives worked side_by_side , the women in puffy peasant blouses and skirts , the men in green-trimmed leather pants and work shirts . In front of most homes , trees brimmed with apples , pears and plums , and I stopped to see if I could buy some from an elderly farmer . &quot; Moment , bitte , &quot; he said and disappeared . He returned with a small sack and filled it with ripe fruit . He refused money , pushing it back with leathery hands . After I rode another 50 yards , I stopped and looked_back . His wife had joined him , and the two waved as if bidding farewell to an old friend . Around the bend , a neighbor displayed similar hospitality with a sign offering &quot; Fresh Water for Cyclists. &quot; I filled my bottle with ice-cold water flowing_from the mouth of a wood-carved knight . Behind it , a wooden home lay bathed with waves of impatiens and petunias . A few minutes later , I entered Hollersbach , nicknamed &quot; the blossoming village &quot; both for its proud floral displays and for its botanical_garden with more_than 500 different kinds of flowers and herbs . After three hours , 21 miles and a vertical drop of nearly 1 # 000 feet , I arrived in Mittersill , the first sizable town along the route . I locked my bike in the market_square , entered the Meilinger Tavern and enjoyed a lunch of soup with dumplings , spaetzle ( a kind of dense noodle ) with native cheese and , for dessert , strips of crepe mixed with blueberries and powdered sugar . that ' s another benefit of riding : gorging without guilt . From the 14th to 16th centuries , Mittersill lay at the crossroad of two major trade_routes . From Italy came wine , olive_oil , fruit and silk . In return , Austria sent salt , mined nearby and known for centuries as &quot; white gold. &quot; Celts and Romans followed the same route , and I passed a Roman mile-marker later in the day . A medieval watchtower still stands , serving today as a museum marking a millennium of commerce and local history . Later that afternoon I arrived_at my first day ' s destination , Zell am See , an idyllic lakeside town encircled by mountains . My itinerary called_for a one-night ' s stay in Zell , but I wished I ' d planned several . Zell is a year-round tourist resort , and I soon found_out why . First , due_to strict pollution controls and restrictions against gasoline boat engines , the lake itself is known as the cleanest bathing lake in Europe . Others may be cleaner -- but far too cold for bathing . As I walked my bike along the promenade , I saw windsurfers , sailboats and paddle boats . Families fished from docks , and teen-agers water-skied behind electric-powered motorboats . Zell am See and neighboring Kaprun also draw thousands of hikers weekly , from casual day-trippers to more dedicated climbers who spend their nights in mountain huts . A local cycling map and brochure described nearly 40 routes , ranging from seven miles along the lake to 60 miles winding over nearby mountains . Next time . I awoke the following morning to the sound of rain splashing on my window . After a breakfast of fresh fruit and muesli in my hotel , the Sporthotel Alpin , I retrieved my bike from the hotel garage , loaded my packs , put_on my rain gear and headed out . Luckily , as the waters of the Salzach widened , most of the hard-packed dirt route was sheltered beneath a leafy canopy . The rain splattered on the leaves and misted downward in a symphony of sounds and scents . As the symphony reached a downpour crescendo , however , I took refuge in a small restaurant in the village of Taxenbach . Even my mother ' s chicken_soup had never tasted better -- or warmer . After lunch , the rain stopped , and I took one of several hillier side options , climbing nearly 600 feet to a ledge overlooking the river . It was exhausting , but rewarding . At the top , I shared the view with a pair of weary Dutch cyclists who noted , with some understatement , that their country offers flatter cycling . Clouds puffed like cotton through the valley . I slept well that night , just outside the town of St . Johann . Until now , the route had run due_east . The next morning , the Salzach and I turned north toward Salzburg . By midmorning , the powerful Hohenwerfen castle came_into view in the distance . The route passes_by the base of the castle , and I walked up the steep path through a series of mighty walls . Built_in 1077 and rebuilt over the centuries , the fortress today stands a peaceful watch_over the river . Its dungeons are closed , the guns just for show . Just north of Werfen , two mountain_ranges come_together , and the Salzach roars through the narrow chasm , kicking_up 15-foot standing_waves . Cars and trains can take a tunnel through the mountains . Bicyclists , however , must climb through the Lueg Pass , which the river has carved between two sheer cliff walls . As I approached the pass , the walls seemed to merge . To the right , mountain . To the left , the surging Salzach and more mountain . Ahead , a sign warning of falling rocks . I pedaled faster . It was great . After the only real climb of the main route , I coasted downhill into the town of Golling , a manicured medieval town lined with outdoor cafes . I detoured along a path into the deeply wooded Bluntau Valley , sharing the way with families , young couples walking hand in_hand and more cows . I doubled_back and passed St . Nikolaus ' , a small Gothic pilgrimage church set atop a craggy outcropping , where a wedding was just ending . I got_off the bike and walked 10 minutes to the 250-foot Golling waterfall . Even after the 1 # 000-foot Krimml waterfall , I stood_in awe of its power and beauty . Within an hour I was standing_in Hallein , a town of nearly 20 # 000 residents and the final overnight stop of my journey . Hallein had been the center of the millennia-old salt industry until the mines closed_in 1989 , and the streets were lined with the pastel-painted high facades of affluent merchant homes . Medieval alleyways ran in every direction , and I parked my bike to explore . In the distance I saw the entrance to the old mines , a popular attraction where visitors tour the caverns by whooshing down giant wooden slides , walking on ramps across underground lakes and riding in a small miners train . I eventually passed_through the marketplace to the 12th-Century Romanesque Dekanats Church , where &quot; Silent Night &quot; composer Franz Gruber once served as choir director . His grave lay outside the door , his home just beyond . After a dinner that ended with Salzburger Nockerl , a souffle-like specialty , I took a final walk_around town and went_to_bed . My final day of riding carried the anticipation of seeing the famous Hohensalzburg fortress that dominates the Salzburg skyline . Only nine miles lay ahead . The bike path ran_through dense forest , and I heard Salzburg before I saw it . It was Sunday morning , and the city ' s church_bells rang in chorus . Finally , through a break_in the trees , I saw the fortress towering over the baroque spires of the city . I ' d made_it . During the week , cars clog the city ' s narrow streets . On Sundays , pedestrians and cyclists rule . I rode along the Getreidegasse , Salzburg ' s most famous medieval alley . I slowly made my way past the palatial Residenz , former home of the ruling archbishops , now a museum , to the cathedral , where street musicians played their guitars and artists drew chalk Madonnas on the sidewalk . I parked the bike and climbed_up to the fortress . On previous visits to Salzburg , I ' d spent hours there looking_out_over the city . This time , I looked instead to the south , where I could see the bicycle path along the Salzach disappear gradually into the mountains . Memories of the past four days came_in a flood , buffeted by the bells of the city calling the faithful to Mass . Despite the glorious view below , however , the feeling that lingered was somewhat bittersweet ; on a bicycle tour , after all , getting here is all_the fun . GUIDEBOOK : Austrian Coasts Getting there : From Los Angeles to Munich -- easier and cheaper than flying into Salzburg -- Lufthansa flies nonstop ; U.S. carriers Delta , American and United have connecting flights ; high-season round-trip fares , with restrictions , about $ 1 # 100 . Trains run every two hours from Munich to Salzburg ( $ 18 ) or , with advance reservations , take a van direct from the airport to Salzburg ( $ 38 ) . Trains , which can carry bicycles , run several times daily from Salzburg to Krimml via Zell am See ( about $ 18 per person , plus $ 6 per bike ) . Where to stay : I booked my lodging ahead of time with the help of the Salzburg Provincial Tourist Office , which provided me with a list of local tourist bureaus . While this kept me on schedule and offered peace_of_mind , I met some travelers who were taking potluck on accommodations , ranging from hotels and pensions in the towns and villages to private rooms in farmhouses on the bike path . Top-quality hotels , such_as the Hotel Zur Post in Krimml ( 011-43-6564-358 ) and the Sporthotel Alpine ( Gartenstrasse 11 , Zell am See ; 011-43-6542-7131 ) range $ 50- $ 100 a night . Rooms in private homes go_for $ 10- $ 30 . Bicycles : Airline policies differ on transporting bicycles , the cost and to what degree you have to disassemble your bike . I recommend renting there . Rentals are available throughout the Salzburg area . VELOaktive ( Willibald-Hauthaler-Strasse 10 , A-5020 Salzburg ) rents bikes for $ 15- $ 20 per day or $ 60- $ 90 per week , even for state-of-the-art 21-speed hybrids and touring bikes . The Salzburg Provincial Tourist Office provides lists and rental assistance . Make_sure you try your rental out first -- ideally on a local day trip -- before you embark_on a long journey . Carry rain gear . Tour companies : After my solo trip along the Tauernradweg , I joined up with a tour outfit for a ride down the Danube . I enjoyed the company of a dozen international guests , the services of a guide , luggage transport , van support and tours of important attractions , as well as two meals a day and overnight lodging . Tour companies offer similar services on the Tauernradweg for about $ 750 per week . For those who still want some independence , these companies will also provide luggage transport and lodging only for about $ 500 per week .
