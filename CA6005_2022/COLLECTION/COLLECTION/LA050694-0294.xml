   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; FOX HEATS_UP THE ANIMATION WARS ; MOVIES : HEAVYWEIGHT DON BLUTH DISCUSSES THE DEAL THAT WILL BRING HIM AND GARY GOLDMAN HOME FROM IRELAND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While Walt Disney Co . has proven repeatedly that animated films can reach the highest box_office echelons , no other studio has been able to duplicate that success . But with the potential payoff so huge -- not just in ticket sales but in videos , merchandising and other areas -- the major studios are embracing animation like never before . In the latest move , 20th Century Fox announced earlier this week that it is investing $ 100 million in an animation division to be headed by veterans Don Bluth and Gary Goldman , who will leave the independent animation studio they set_up in Ireland nearly eight years ago . Bluth , in his first interview since the announcement , says the pair are looking_to Fox for the kind of sophisticated scriptwriting and marketing that his company lacked . With the muscle of the studio behind them , he said , &quot; I think we have a shot at being competitive. &quot; Bluth and Goldman have enjoyed success with films such_as &quot; The Land Before Time , &quot; &quot; An American Tail &quot; and &quot; All Dog ' s Go_to Heaven. &quot; However , their most recent movie , &quot; Thumbelina , &quot; stalled at about $ 10 million , which Bluth blames on bad marketing . One reason for optimism over the Fox deal is the involvement of newly installed studio President Bill Mechanic , a former Disney executive who built its video merchandising operation into one of the company ' s most profitable businesses . &quot; Animation is potentially a great business , &quot; says Mechanic , &quot; but not a great business in and of itself . I don ' t think we would have invested so heavily without a Don Bluth . Don and Gary are preeminent in the field. &quot; Mechanic also points_out that Disney ' s position in animated features was built_up only over the past decade . &quot; Nine years ago , when I started there , there wasn ' t great success , &quot; he says . &quot; There was a great history. &quot; But Disney ' s renewed commitment to animation enabled it to reclaim its former glory . Now , he believes , Fox can take a similar path . &quot; I would hope we would do the same thing with Don and Gary , &quot; he says . Under terms of their five-year deal with Fox , Bluth and Goldman will create a separate animation production company that will work under the newly formed Fox Family Films division . No site has been picked for the as-yet-untitled animation studio , but it definitely will not be in California , Bluth says . &quot; I don ' t like earthquakes , &quot; he says , &quot; and it ' s too crowded with animation at present. &quot; He says the studio will be located somewhere in the western United States . Bluth and Goldman will have a staff of about 200 , the same as his company in Ireland . The new team will begin production on its first feature_film in October , with a release target date of Christmas , 1996 . Bluth and Goldman will probably make a film every 18 months , which Fox will augment with work from other producers in_order to release an animated feature each year , Mechanic said . Although Bluth doesn ' t begin work_at Fox until May 31 -- Goldman starts July 15 -- he said he already has three projects in development for the new venture . Bluth , Goldman and more_than a dozen colleagues walked away from Disney in 1979 , disappointed with its then-lackluster attitude toward animated films . With financial incentives from the government of Ireland , they eventually created a studio on the banks of the River Liffey in Dublin . Since then , they ' ve attained some success but also weathered some financial problems , including two bankruptcies . Bluth is now an employee rather than an owner of the Dublin company that bears his name . Don Bluth Ireland Ltd . was taken_over by Media Assets of Hong Kong , which was itself taken_over by Rupert Murdoch ' s News Corp . -- owner of 20th Century Fox and its parent , Fox Inc. Twentieth Century Fox President Mechanic says the fact that Bluth and Goldman are essentially moving from one arm of Murdoch ' s empire to another had nothing to do with securing the pair . When the Fox deal was announced in Ireland , newspapers there erroneously reported that Bluth ' s studio would shut_down as a result . In fact , says Bluth , the company is up for_sale and considering offers . The studio is completing work_on the feature_film &quot; The Pebble and the Penguin. &quot; &quot; I ' m attached_to Ireland , &quot; Bluth says . &quot; It ' s an enchanting place . But it ' s a time of going home. &quot; His homecoming coincides with a burst of animation activity in Hollywood . Warner recently hired Disney executive Michael Laney to head a new feature animation division , and MGM launched its MGM Animation division earlier this year . Will there be room in the marketplace for all_of them ? &quot; There ' s only room for the good product , &quot; Mechanic says bluntly . &quot; I think most will fail. &quot;</TEXT>
