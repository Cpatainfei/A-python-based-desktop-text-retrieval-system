   <HEADLINE> MYSTERY SURROUNDS SUIT AGAINST O.C. CONSULTANTS ; COURTS : SEALED DOCUMENTS ALLEGE DECEPTIVE FUND-RAISING TACTICS . LAWYERS FOR THE PAIR DISMISS THE ALLEGATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For four years , hundreds of pleadings , motions and depositions taken_in a politically sensitive civil suit -- enough to fill a pair of three-drawer filing_cabinets -- have been hidden away in an off-limits room in the basement of the Orange County Superior_Court in Santa Ana . No one seems to know who ordered the suit concealed from public view , or why . No one can find the court_order declaring it secret . Even the attorneys cannot -- or will not -- say how it became sealed . But documents that have surfaced elsewhere reveal that the sealed records contain accusations that millions of dollars collected from civic-minded Californians by political_action_committees were transferred to another organization that has never publicly disclosed how the money was spent . Also sealed from public scrutiny are charges that two controversial and powerful Newport Beach political consultants arranged to be paid nearly half the donated millions as their fees . And the files allude to criminal investigations of certain unnamed defendants . The adversary of these well-connected political consultants is a shy , 45-year-old accountant from Sherman Oaks , determined in his fight to bring certain matters_to light , while his legal battle to do so is inexplicably kept_in the dark . The secret case has been reassigned to at least five different judges , and at least once to a special litigation panel of Superior_Court judges when the case became overwhelmingly complex . And decisions in the lawsuit have bounced up_to the Court of Appeal so frequently -- at least five times -- that when the case was sent_back to Superior_Court last year , the justices wrote , &quot; If we could issue frequent flyer miles , these ( lawsuit ) parties would qualify for a free trip somewhere. &quot; Despite repeated attempts by the two principal defendants , William Butcher and Arnold Forde , to get the lawsuit thrown_out , the long-secret suit is scheduled to go_to trial in Orange County Superior_Court on Monday before a judge without a jury . Two judges who have presided over the case acknowledge that all documents relating to the lawsuit have been sealed , even though the California Supreme Court has long held &quot; there can be no doubt that court records are public records , available to the public in general. &quot; &quot; It ' s extraordinary , &quot; said Gary Phillips , the plaintiff ' s attorney , whose partner accidentally discovered 2 1 / 2 years ago that the entire case file had been sealed_in 1990 . &quot; I have no explanation for it . . . . Somebody doesn ' t want public scrutiny and I don ' t know who or how this happened. &quot; David Elson , the attorney for Butcher and Forde , said he does not &quot; recall that I filed a motion to seal it. &quot; He speculated that the suit might have been sealed because the plaintiff would be gaining access to &quot; all sorts of information not generally available to the public. &quot; But local legal_experts say they ' ve never heard of a case involving these types of allegations being totally sealed from the public . Sealed records , they say , are much more routine in civil cases involving such things as children and family disputes , trade_secrets and defective products . While the Superior_Court records remain secret , some details of the 6-year-old suit can be gleaned from a nearly three-foot thick appeal file taken_in 1992 to the Court of Appeal in Santa Ana , which declined to seal its files . The appellate_court records provide a glimpse into the lucrative world of direct-mail fund raising , where campaign consultants like Butcher and Forde , the architects of Howard Jarvis ' Proposition 13 campaign , can charge_up to 25 cents for each of the hundreds of thousands of solicitation letters mailed to potential donors during a typical campaign . Other fees can net them millions more . The files also tell the story of Paul McCauley , the Sherman Oaks accountant who took_on Butcher and Forde after he discovered that the California Tax Reduction Movement , the organization they co-founded with Jarvis in the wake of Proposition 13 , was not registered with California ' s secretary_of_state . Nor had the group publicly disclosed how it had spent the millions it took_in from the political action committees it had spawned -- committees such_as the one to dump former state Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird , or the committee to Save Prop . 13 . &quot; I was more_than a little shocked to find , here they were , the largest political fund-raiser in the state , and they had not filed a campaign statement , &quot; McCauley said in an interview . &quot; I certainly think the public would like to know where the money went. &quot; Under the Political Reform Act of 1974 , the &quot; receipts and expenditures in election campaigns should be fully and truthfully disclosed in_order that the voters may be fully informed and improper practices may be inhibited. &quot; McCauley sent two letters requesting an investigation to the Fair Political Practices Commission , and a third letter to the Los Angeles County district_attorney . When he received no replies , he made use of a little-known section in the Political Reform Act that allows an individual to serve as a &quot; private attorney_general &quot; to sue Butcher-Forde Consulting , CTRM -- now known as the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Assn . -- and Blanche Kelly , who served as CTRM ' s treasurer , for alleged violations of the act . McCauley said he does not believe that Jarvis , who died in 1986 , was in any way responsible_for the allegedly deceptive fund-raising practices . At issue is whether the group was a political_action_committee that should have been making regular public disclosures of where it was getting its money , and how it was being spent . Its attorneys have argued that it wasn ' t subject_to the political reform act ' s reporting requirements . &quot; CTRM was a membership organization , just like a labor_union . It established political_action_committees , which raised money in their own names and reported it , &quot; Lawrence Straw , an attorney for the group , said . &quot; McCauley ' s got all these crazy theories . . . . Next he ' s going_to be saying Butcher and Forde were_on the grassy knoll when ( President ) Kennedy was shot. &quot; Another contested issue is whether Butcher-Forde Consulting was the &quot; de_facto &quot; treasurer of CTRM , and therefore financially liable for what McCauley maintains are violations of the Political Reform Act . In court documents , McCauley contends that Butcher-Forde Consulting used CTRM to set_up various political_action_committees that traded on the Jarvis name and prevailing anti-tax sentiments . The committees would raise money through mass mailings , then transfer much of the proceeds back to CTRM , according to court documents . The money from these &quot; deceptive fund-raising_campaigns &quot; in behalf of CTRM , could then be donated to CTRM and used &quot; to pay BFC ' s exorbitant invoices , &quot; say the court documents . According to a 1985 income_tax_return McCauley obtained from the Internal Revenue Service , $ 3.6 million of the $ 6.9 million the California Tax Reduction Movement spent that year went_to fund raising , and nearly $ 2.5 million was paid to Butcher-Forde as fees . The following year , Butcher-Forde ' s fees accounted_for 47 % of the the group ' s expenditures , or $ 1.8 million , court records state . &quot; Had they reported all this , then fine , &quot; said Phillips , McCauley ' s attorney . &quot; And if the public still wanted to continue sending them money , then P . T . Barnum was right. &quot; McCauley contends that Butcher-Forde Consulting helped found CTRM in 1978 to &quot; enable ( Butcher-Forde Consulting ) to acquire a nonprofit bulk rate mailing permit which could be used to obtain cheaper rates on postage , thereby enabling mailings in the name of CTRM to be more profitable. &quot; CTRM then &quot; lent &quot; its mailing permit to a series of political action committees it formed and controlled -- though a federal lawsuit prohibited them from doing so , court documents show . In 1979 , Butcher-Forde and CTRM signed their first written contract giving Butcher-Forde five cents for every piece of mail sent_out in behalf of CTRM and all_of its committees . Subsequent contracts described in court records bumped that take_up to 25 cents per letter , and also paid Butcher-Forde Consulting 17.65 % of CTRM ' s gross expenditures as a management fee . One of Butcher-Forde ' s mailers in 1986 was a black-bordered fund-raising appeal sent_out to 350 # 000 Jarvis supporters two weeks after Jarvis ' death . The mailing , which also included a photograph of Jarvis and a note from his widow , asked_for donations of $ 10 , $ 15 or $ 20 to the Howard Jarvis Memorial Fund to campaign for a proposition to overturn a state Supreme Court decision that could weaken Proposition 13 . Another fund-raiser in late 1984 sought to raise money to pay_off a purported $ 349 # 000 debt left over from an unsuccessful attempt to amend the state Constitution . McCauley contends in court documents that little or no debt existed . Bank_statements for the fund-raising committee show that $ 858 # 083 was &quot; grossed &quot; from two mass mailings for that fund-raiser . The $ 530 # 404 netted by the fund-raiser was &quot; contributed &quot; to CTRM , court records say . Such allegations have been dismissed by Butcher-Forde ' s attorney as &quot; blatant distortions ( that ) do not raise a single triable issue of fact as_to whether the ( Butcher-Forde Consulting ) defendants intentionally or negligently violated any provision of the Political Reform Act. &quot; Elson also said McCauley ' s claims that his clients are somehow responsible_for CTRM are &quot; groundless &quot; and &quot; hypertechnical &quot; and that his clients were simply hired hands who neither controlled nor served as treasurers of the CTRM during the mid-1980s . &quot; Howard Jarvis was in_charge . I don ' t think anyone would dispute that Howard Jarvis is captain of_his_own ship , &quot; he said . In his appellate brief , Elson labeled McCauley a &quot; bounty hunter &quot; out_to drive Butcher and Forde from the state . Should McCauley win the case , he would be entitled to half of everything Butcher and Forde and CTRM should have reported to the state , including both contributions and expenditures . The remaining half would be put_in the state ' s general fund . Both Phillips and Elson promised that the truth of the secret suit would become clear when the full case is tried in the coming weeks . &quot; I never intended this to be a six-year-long lawsuit , &quot; McCauley said . &quot; It ' s just when we got_into it , the mountain got bigger. &quot; Times Staff Writer Anna Cekola contributed to this report .</TEXT>
