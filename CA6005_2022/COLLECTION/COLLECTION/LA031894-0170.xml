   <HEADLINE> LEGISLATORS OK TOUGHER SMOG CHECKS ; POLLUTION : WILSON IS EXPECTED TO SIGN COMPROMISE WITH EPA . ACTION APPEARS TO END YEARLONG FIGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a compromise with federal_officials who had threatened sanctions if the state failed to act , the Legislature overwhelmingly approved a beefed-up Smog Check program Thursday aimed at the dirtiest cars in the smoggiest regions of California . Gov . Pete Wilson , whose representatives joined legislators in negotiating the clean air agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency over the last three months , is expected to sign the bill soon . The settlement appeared to end a yearlong fight between the Wilson Administration and Clinton_Administration over how best to bring California into compliance with the U.S. Clean Air Act . Assemblyman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) , lead legislative negotiator , told the lower house : &quot; We have put_in place the strongest , most creative program in the country , one that will clean_up our air , be convenient for motorists and keep as_many small ( Smog Check ) businesses as possible in operation. &quot; Under the proposal , starting in 1995 , 15 % of the estimated 8 million cars and small trucks scheduled for testing each year in the smoggiest regions of California , including the South Coast Air Basin and Ventura and San Diego counties , would be routed into new privately operated inspection-only facilities . The testing would be more rigorous than the examinations performed at neighborhood garages that test and repair vehicles . Aimed at worst offenders , these would include vehicles whose smog controls had been tampered with , high-mileage vehicles , &quot; gross polluters &quot; and a 2 % random_sample collected by the Department of Motor_Vehicles . Katz said , &quot; 10 % of the vehicles cause 50 % of the pollution. &quot; Held up as a model for other states , the compromise would set_up a novel program to use public funds to subsidize owners of &quot; gross polluters &quot; for repair costs up_to $ 450 or give them up_to $ 800 to junk their vehicles . The subsidy is intended for low-income motorists whose older vehicles pollute heavily but who cannot afford costly repairs or the purchase of a new car that meets clean air standards . Wilson vetoed a similar bill last year because it would have obligated the state to pay_up to $ 4 # 800 per car . &quot; Either fix the cars or take them off the road , &quot; Katz said of the subsidy proposal , authored by Sen . Quentin Kopp ( I-San Francisco ) . &quot; We ' ve never done that before. &quot; In California , smog inspections are required every_other year , when cars must be registered and upon change of ownership . The three-bill package was carried by Katz , Kopp and Sen . Robert B . Presley ( D-Riverside ) and sent to Wilson on a series of bipartisan votes that more_than satisfied the two-thirds requirement for passage . The key Katz bill won 55-0 approval in the Assembly and 31-3 endorsement in the Senate . The bills supplement legislation signed by Wilson in January that rejected the EPA ' s demand that automobile inspections be separated from repair services conducted at about 9 # 000 licensed garages in California . Wilson and the Legislature sided with Smog Check operators , who protested that separation of the services would throw thousands of mechanics out_of_work . The EPA complained that the new law failed to satisfy federal standards and would bring_about imposition of sanctions . Sanctions could include hundreds of millions of dollars in lost federal highway construction funds and imposition of severe pollution discharge restrictions on new construction or expanded businesses . Shortly after Wilson signed the law in January , the two sides returned to the negotiating table and drafted the compromise , which sailed_through the Legislature with heavy bipartisan support Thursday . The next step will be filing the state ' s compliance plan with the EPA . The compromise included an agreement between the Wilson Administration and the federal EPA to drop the sanctions when the plan is submitted . Assistant EPA Administrator Mary Nichols called passage of the legislation a positive step . Supporters said the compromise contained safeguards to assure compliance even if some components of the package fail to work as expected . For example , if testing showed that federal requirements were not being met , the 15 % test group could be expanded to include more vehicles . If failure persisted , however , federal sanctions probably would imposed , officials said . Other alternatives could include legislation , renewed negotiations or court fights . Democrats and Republicans alike boasted that the bill reflected a determination by California to resolve its own problems rather than give_in to what they called federal dictates . &quot; Big Brother and Big Sister in Washington didn ' t know the right way , &quot; Katz told his colleagues . &quot; We know a better way in California. &quot; Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) , a leading clean air advocate , was the only voice in either house to speak out against the bills . Siding with the American Lung Assn. , Hayden said the compromise offered a false hope and only &quot; put_off the inevitable. &quot; Revised Rules Effective in 1995 , here are the key provisions of new smog check legislation expected to be signed by Gov . Pete Wilson : * Eighty-five percent of vehicles would be checked the same way they are now , at neighborhood service_stations that do both testing and repair . The cost of testing is not expected to increase . * Fifteen percent of the vehicles scheduled for smog inspections in the state ' s smoggiest regions would be directed to inspection-only stations that would use improved equipment . Included would be cars whose smog controls have been tampered with , taxis , high-mileage fleet vehicles , &quot; gross polluters &quot; and a 2 % sample chosen at random . * High-tech roadside sensors would seek_out gross-polluting vehicles and record their identities for action by authorities . * In the high-smog regions , owners of gross-polluting vehicles can collect as much as $ 450 from the state to help pay_for repairs or up_to $ 800 to junk the vehicle and purchase a cleaner-running one .</TEXT>
