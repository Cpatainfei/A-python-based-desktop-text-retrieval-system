   <HEADLINE> APARTMENT LIFE : WHAT TO DO WHEN RENT INCREASES BEYOND LIMIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : I rent in Los Angeles and the owners of my building just increased the rent from $ 425 to $ 495 , a $ 70 increase . When I called them to ask about it , I was told that there is no longer any rent control . When did rent control end in the City of Los Angeles ? ANSWER : Rent control is still in place in Los Angeles . Under the L.A. law , owners of rent-controlled buildings in the city are limited to annual rent increases of no more_than 3 % , unless they pay the gas or electric_bill for a unit , in which case they are entitled to an added 1 % for each utility . The 3 % increases are effective in Los Angeles until at least June 30 , 1995 , at which time they may change . The owners also may be entitled to special increases for things such_as capital improvements , like a new roof , but you would be notified of such increases and the reasons for them . I would let the owner know that rent control is alive and well in the city of Los Angeles and that he is only allowed to increase the rent by 3 % , $ 12.75 , unless special circumstances prevail . Is Owner Responsible_for Outside Lighting ? Q : I rent an apartment in a 32-unit building in Glendale and I have a question for you . Are the owners responsible_for outside lighting at an apartment_building ? I have been burglarized once and at that time there was no outside lighting . They did provide lighting after the burglary , but now they refuse to replace the burned-out bulbs . They say it ' s too expensive and they are only responsible_for inside lighting . I say they ' re wrong . What does the law say ? A : I think I can shed some light on your problem , if not on the building . Although the law does not specifically require outside lighting at apartment_buildings , many courts have determined that apartment owners can be liable if unsafe conditions of which they are aware are not corrected . Many courts have found that the absence of outside lighting of the building ' s common areas was a contributing factor to crimes committed at the properties . The owners who knew of those problems also have been found all or partially liable for the damages resulting from them . You should inform the owners that it is in their best interest to provide outside lighting at the property . If a serious crime occurs there , they could be liable for major damages if a court determines that lack of lighting contributed to the crime . How to Get Deposit From Bankrupt Owner Q : I am having a problem getting my security_deposit back from the owner of the Burbank apartment where I used to live . The owner said he was filing for bankruptcy and could not refund my deposit . The day I moved_out , the manager distributed court papers to all tenants . The papers are from the bank that foreclosed on the owner . They say the bank is not responsible_for the deposits either . I spoke with a bank representative who told me that the bank is not the new owner . I don ' t know who to bring_to Small Claims Court to get my refund . Can you help ? A : While you could bring the former owner to court , even if a judge awarded you anything you may_not be able to collect from him since he has filed bankruptcy . And , since you got copies of the bankruptcy papers , the security_deposit debts probably already have been discharged by the bankruptcy court . Your best bet is to sue whoever holds title to the property now . That may or may_not be the bank . The best way to find_out who has the title to the property , if you only have an address , is to go_to one of the regional Los Angeles County Assessor ' s Offices and request ownership information based upon the address of the property . If the assessor cannot find the property based upon the address you provide him , because the assessor ' s address for the property may_not be the same as the mailing_address ( especially on corner properties ) , you will have to find the map book page and parcel number of the property in_order to find_out the ownership information . Also , it takes six to eight weeks after a change of ownership occurs for the new ownership information to get_into the system . Rent Costs More With Additional Child Q : I responded to an advertisement for a vacant apartment in Burbank . The rent was listed at $ 1 # 195 a month . Since I liked the location , I wanted to rent the apartment . However , when I expressed my interest in the apartment , the owner said the rent would be $ 1 # 250 because I have two children instead of one , like she thought . Is this legal ? What can I do ? A : According to real_estate attorney Duane Hall , &quot; Since there was no contract or agreement entered into at a monthly rent of $ 1 # 195 , the landlord was not bound to rent it to you at that level , even though he had listed the rent at that level. &quot; Hall also said that if the landlord ' s intention in raising the rent were to discourage you from renting the apartment because of the additional child , he could have had some exposure to liability for child discrimination . However , he said , the landlord ' s motive here appears to be a willingness to rent to you regardless of the number of children you have and just to charge more for the extra person . The landlord appears to have acted legally . All you can do is rent the apartment at $ 1 # 250 or look elsewhere .</TEXT>
