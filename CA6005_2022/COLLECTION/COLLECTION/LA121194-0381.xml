   <HEADLINE> BLINDSIDED / ORANGE COUNTY ' S FINANCIAL CRISIS ; WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MONEY ? ; TALES OF INCREDULITY AND SHOCK , OF IGNORED WARNINGS AND MISPLACED TRUST AS THE SAGA OF A FINANCIAL CATASTROPHE UNFOLDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There was a certain smugness about how Orange County went_about the business of investing its money . But there always seemed to be good reason to crow . Then came the first of the terrible days . In the opening hours of the crisis , it all seemed like a confusing bad dream , with incomprehensible losses in a financial medium that was like Latin to a layman . Derivatives . Things that lost money as interest_rates went_up . It was all so unreal . Now those terrible days are beginning their march into weeks , which will surely turn_into months of agonizing choices and pointed fingers and , of course , lawsuits . But those first days will always be the worst , the time when the realization struck that Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron had blundered badly . Would the teachers be paid ? Would someone be around to pick_up the trash ? Are we really cold , flat broke ? There are dozens who have been involved in this , the most dramatic and fateful event ever to befall Orange County . They talk_of sleepless nights and tears , of careers and investment portfolios gone_up in smoke . Spring 1994 / The Wolf Begins to Howl JOHN MOORLACH Republican candidate for county treasurer-tax collector Voices from the past now look so prescient , and none was more forceful than accountant John Moorlach , Citron ' s Republican opponent in the last election . In discussing his losing campaign , Moorlach now talks like a man who has been vindicated . He described in detail how Citron first stalled , then grudgingly gave him a copy of the county ' s investment portfolio in May . Moorlach : &quot; I finally got his portfolio in readable condition on May 2 , a month before the election . I shopped it around to bond brokers around the country . They took all kinds of evening hours to pore over it . They were just flipping out . He ' d increased his leverage from $ 4 billion in March of 1993 to $ 12 billion in March of 1994 . He not only bet that rates would go_down , he bet really big. &quot; On May 31 , Moorlach , who was destined to lose his election by a large margin the following week , sent an eight-page letter to Thomas Riley , chairman of the County Board of Supervisors . What was dismissed by the supervisors then now seems to have been exactly on the mark . The letter : &quot; Every prudent investor chooses safety of principal as the top priority . Next comes the need for liquidity . The last priority is achieving yields . It ' s time to get_back to basics . Mr. Citron has these priorities inversed . He has focused primarily on yields . He has poor liquidity . He has put our principal at risk . He is willing to make highly leveraged , highly speculative and highly aggressive investments . I am very uncomfortable with that and you should be , too. &quot; As it turned_out , few heeded Moorlach ' s warning . He did , however , help convince the city of Costa Mesa , where he lives , to pull most of its funds from the county investment pool . * SANDRA GENIS Former Mayor , City of Costa Mesa One who was most concerned was then-Mayor Sandra Genis , who still rues the fact that the city was unable to extract all_of its money . Still , the city managed to withdraw $ 11 million of the $ 14 million that was in the pool . Genis : &quot; Maybe if I had just beat my head against the wall a little harder , pushed a little more . Maybe when I got real worried last October I should have gotten real obnoxious and beat on people . I know how to be pushy . But I was trying to be cool , to do this quietly . &quot; If we were to withdraw , we didn ' t want a public flurry . If there was a run_on the bank , we didn ' t want to cause it. &quot; Others were more trusting . The city of Cypress had a relatively small $ 5.85-million investment and chose to stay with the tried-and-true Citron even though interest_rates were_on the rise . * CECILIA AGE Mayor , City of Cypress Age : &quot; Citron won that ( political race ) overwhelmingly and assured everyone that everything was fine . I think everyone was comfortable with that after his statement in which he reassured everyone that he ' s been in that office for 16 years or whatever it is and he ' s always had a high rate of return. &quot; His reassurances &quot; eased my fear that there was something wrong there . There was no cause for alarm and there was no cause at that point_in_time to really question it. &quot; Nov . 10 ' I Did Nothing Wrong ' WILLIAM G . STEINER County Supervisor County Supervisor William G . Steiner has a notation on his calendar for the date of Nov . 10 . It says &quot; Ernie Schneider 2:15. &quot; It was_on that date that the county administrative officer notified the supervisors individually that outside consultants were being hired to examine the portfolio and its value . That briefing , according to sources , came only after Assistant Treasurer Matthew Raabe threatened to quit if something was not done to improve the portfolio . But even with this official admission that all was not well with the county ' s investments , Steiner said the belief was that Citron could pull the proverbial rabbit out of the hat . Steiner : &quot; I still had a feeling that Bob Citron had his arms around the problem and that he would save the day . Ten years ago , I was a school_board trustee , a member of the Board_of_Education in the Orange Unified School District . We had really severe financial problems . Citron came_to the rescue and produced a greater return on the investment . It literally kept us from laying_off teachers and increasing class size. &quot; This time , though , there were no miracles . Instead , there was a somber news_conference called by county officials to announce that the unthinkable was happening . On the first day of December , Schneider and Raabe told an incredulous group of reporters that Orange County was $ 1.5 billion in the hole . * DAVE LOPEZ Reporter , KCBS-TV The news_conference was scheduled for 2 p.m. and Dave Lopez , a longtime television_reporter for KCBS-TV , was given the assignment of what was billed as a somewhat innocuous-sounding discussion of county finances . The assignment editors , though , were less than enthused and instead ordered him to Huntington Beach for a story about students chewing gum laced with LSD . But things quickly began to change as word got_around that the news_conference to discuss finances could be big . Lopez was ordered to the Hall of Administration at the last moment , only to find the conference_room crowded with reporters who are not usually there . Lopez : &quot; I ' d done interviews with Citron before and he was just sitting over there all quiet and meek . And I was thinking , something ' s weird about this , really weird . Wall_Street reporters were there , all_the big news services . After listening to Raabe and the other guys , I thought , ' We gotta get Citron to comment. ' So I said , ' Mr. Citron , a lot of people are blaming you , saying this is your fault. ' He started to answer and I said , ' No , no , you ' ve got_to get closer to the mike. ' And he says , ' I did nothing wrong . I feel as though I have nothing to apologize for. ' And then they whisked him off . It was all_of nine seconds . &quot; Friday , I didn ' t touch the story because the Heidi Fleiss verdict came in. &quot; Dec . 2 ' Things Are Going Off a Cliff ' MAYA DECKER President , Newport-Mesa Federation of Teachers Word began to spread . Maya Decker , president of the Newport-Mesa Federation of Teachers , said she got_word on her telephone answering machine that there were going_to be big headlines Friday and that the news would not be good . Her school district had $ 47 million invested in the now-bankrupt pool . Decker : &quot; I went_to the office in the morning . We take three papers , and I looked_at all_of them . ' Frenzy ' was one of the words in a headline . I thought they were overplaying it . . . . My feeling was a lot of people were running_around shouting the sky is falling before having serious time to reflect on it. &quot; * DAN MILLER Santa Ana neighbor of Citron News of the financial disaster sent county authorities and news organizations scurrying while Citron dropped from sight . Citron ' s Santa Ana neighbor , Dan Miller , noticed that all was not as usual in the neighborhood . There seemed to be a lot of cars in front of Citron ' s house . Miller : &quot; I didn ' t talk to him that weekend at all . I didn ' t see him outside . He doesn ' t usually have a lot of visitors . That was the only inkling I had that something was going_on until it broke_out . &quot; I think it was Sunday when they ( the media ) started coming_around . Most of the questions were ' Have you seen Bob ? Have you talked to him ? How is he ? ' They were just coming_up asking . Then they ' d go_away , sit in their car for four or five hours , seeing if people are coming and going . I went_to talk to Bob and I told him , ' I think it would be good to say something . People are saying they ' re concerned about your health. ' Friends of his were calling , too. &quot; Steiner kept to his weekend schedule . He was_on his way to a football game when it became clear to him that events were veering out of control . Steiner : &quot; I was in the car and the car phone rang . I was taking guests to the Rams game . The CAO ( county administrative officer ) , Ernie Schneider , called . He said you have to come . We ' re being told that the SEC ( Securities and Exchange Commission ) is in the treasurer ' s office , that they ' re talking tough as far as freezing the investment pool . . . . There ' s a possibility of civil fraud charges against Bob Citron . &quot; I thought , ' Things are going_off a cliff. ' &quot; Sunday , Citron signed a resignation letter . It was only one sentence long : &quot; After much thought and soul-searching and with much regret , I have decided for the benefit of the county of Orange to resign my elected office. &quot; Dec . 6 The Day It All Collapsed If matters had seemed swift and tumultuous to that point , they only intensified as the drama of the next couple of days unfolded . MARIAN BERGESON State_Senator In Sacramento , state Sen . Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach , who will take a seat on the Board of Supervisors next month , began receiving calls from county officials telling her of the resignation . Even with the political cat fight being waged by Willie Brown to retain his speakership , she boarded a plane and flew to Orange County . One of the ironies was that she had withdrawn her endorsement of Moorlach during the campaign , fearing that his claims might somehow affect the status of the investment pool . Bergeson : &quot; It was a shock , the severity of it . It was inconceivable that this could have happened to the county. &quot; The inconceivable , though , only got_worse . Tuesday , Dec . 6 , will go_down as one of the longest days in Orange County history . No one knows exactly when it began for Citron and Schneider and the county support staff -- or even if they slept at all -- but Steiner ' s day started at 2:55 a.m. with a call from Steven E . Lewis , county auditor-controller . The message was terse . Steiner : &quot; I was told to come_down to the Hall of Administration . Urgent . I was there in 30 minutes . ( Supervisor ) Gaddi Vasquez was the first to arrive . Tom Riley was second . We were in separate offices on the third floor , and that ' s where some incredible things occurred . We were told that the county would potentially default_on $ 1.2 billion in bonds at 11:30 a.m. Tuesday , Pacific_Standard_Time , 2:30 p.m. New York time. &quot; As Orange County slept unaware , the drama began to unfold at the Hall of Administration . The Brown Act , which keeps more_than two supervisors from meeting together at a time , forced the county staff to race up and down the office stairs and deliver their early morning message of doom over and over and over again . * HARRIETT AND IRV WIEDER County Supervisor and her husband One message that was not immediately delivered was for Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder . As the other supervisors began to mobilize for the emergency meeting , Wieder slept on . County Finance Director Eilene Walsh had tried to reach the slumbering supervisor but dialed the wrong number . An hour later , a Huntington Beach police_officer was dispatched to Wieder ' s home with orders to bring her to Santa Ana . As the officer banged on the door , Wieder and her husband , Irv , panicked . Do they let the officer in ? Then the phone rang . It was Walsh . Wieder knew the news would be bad . Harriett Wieder : &quot; I ' ve been here 16 years , and the only other times ( I ' d been summoned ) had been an earthquake and a flood . So this was a major disaster -- a 10 1 / 2 on the Richter scale. &quot; Irv Wieder : &quot; We didn ' t go_into too_much discussion . We just started getting dressed as fast as we could . I think Harriett was reviewing the upside and the downside of what could be the worst , what could be the best , and who does she know who could be of help . Should she call the White_House ? Should she call ( Sen . Barbara ) Boxer ? Should she call ( Sen . Dianne ) Feinstein ? &quot; Here is the problem that was facing the supervisors : Not only were they confronted with their county ' s financial health going_up in flames , but Raabe was talking_about selling_off the portfolio , &quot; the whole damn thing , the whole works , &quot; Steiner said , in an effort to recoup at least something . That made the local officials mighty nervous . And when lawmakers are nervous , they hit the phones . * PETE WILSON Governor of California They called the three biggest investors in the investment pool . They called the senators . Steiner called the governor . It was 7:30 a.m. Two hours later the board began yet another in an interminable string of meetings . And at 9:45 , Steiner was called away . Pete Wilson was_on the line . Steiner : &quot; Pete Wilson is in San Diego giving a breakfast speech . He ' s going_to get_on a plane . I explain to him the magnitude of the problem . I ask him : Will you please call Arthur Levitt , chairman of the SEC ? What I was hoping for was the SEC to freeze trading , freeze the pool and prohibit the investment_bankers from liquidating their positions ; $ 1.2 billion was_due in an hour and a half . What did Pete Wilson say ? ' Oh my God. ' &quot; Wilson : &quot; It was shock . . . and great concern as_to what the dimensions of the problem would turn_out to be. &quot; * CHRISTOPHER COX U.S. Representative In Washington , Rep . Christopher Cox ( R-Newport Beach ) emerged Tuesday morning from the heady atmosphere of a conference_room where he had just been elected to a leadership role in the new Congress , only to find himself facing a bank of television_cameras . Cox : &quot; I walked_out . . . fresh from a 148-77 vote and had this note thrust into my hands . I said , ' I ' m taken_aback by the phone message I just received . It says Orange County may declare bankruptcy by this afternoon. ' &quot; The 10:15 a.m. phone message , which had been handed to Cox by a staffer , was from James McConnell , the county ' s Washington lobbyist . &quot; URGENT , &quot; it read , &quot; Orange County may declare bankruptcy by 1:30 this afternoon . Please call the SEC to urge them to get the federal_court to freeze the asset pool. &quot; After leaving the news_conference , at which he made his comments and thus became the first to leak the extraordinary news of the bankruptcy , Cox called McConnell to confirm that he had left the message . McConnell , in reply , said he had and that he had left similar messages for other members of the delegation . The worst of the worst did happen . At 5:01 p.m. Tuesday , Orange County became the largest municipality in U.S. history to file for federal bankruptcy protection . The decision sent shock_waves through Wall_Street . The county ' s all-important bond_rating , which determines , among other things , at what interest_rate money may be borrowed , took a dive . * TOM RILEY Chairman , county supervisors Immediately after the decision , Supervisor Riley insisted the county had done the right thing , despite the consequences of their action . Riley : &quot; I have taken great pride in talking_about a great county in which to live , what its credit ratings were , how we did everything better and still the cost to live here was not that great . I think we ' ll get_back there . It ' s going_to take some time but I think we have people with the will , the staff with the will. &quot; One uncertainty is just where help will come from . The bankruptcy filing was made only after last ditch appeals_to the state and federal_governments . Wilson : &quot; We at this point can ' t say what the state can do . But I doubt that we can do more , frankly , than possibly advance payments that might otherwise be_due to assist their cash flow problem . I am deliberately not raising anybody ' s expectations because I think there is a very limited role that the state can play. &quot; * MICHAEL REESE Aide to state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown Prior to the crash , Citron and others from his office called state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown looking_for a life_preserver from Sacramento . Although state officials have no statutory authority to bail_out the Orange County fund , Brown aide Michael Reese said her office is keeping an hour-by-hour watch on Santa Ana . Reese , like Wilson , said the state could do nothing to help Orange County and that the treasurer ' s office knew_nothing of the impending collapse . Reese : &quot; We asked to see their portfolio and they have yet to deliver it to us. &quot; Dec . 7 ' Like a Death in the Family ' ROBERT GORE Bond trader While Citron ' s high-risk strategies -- aided by some of Wall_Street ' s biggest firms -- were no secret on Wall_Street , Orange County ' s rapid descent still caught many municipal_bond traders by surprise . It was not until the county announced the investment pool ' s $ 1.5-billion loss that &quot; alarm_bells went_off for everybody , &quot; said Robert Gore , a municipal trader at Crowell , Weedon &amp; Co . in Los Angeles . Gore : &quot; It was like a death in the family . The initial reaction was that everybody was scared . There was a kind of panic trading that went_on early ( Wednesday ) morning . The market for a lot of municipals just dried_up . It subsequently rebounded a little bit , but it was still kind of an eerie feeling. &quot; * RANDY SMOLIK Bond analyst But the loss and the county ' s filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code were not the only shockers for the investment community . A big jolt came from one of_their_own . Federal_Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , appearing before the Joint Economic Committee , said there were no plans for a federal fix . To Randy Smolik , a senior analyst at Municipal Market Data of Boston , it was as if Greenspan &quot; dropped a bomb. &quot; Smolik : &quot; Greenspan was just going_to let Orange County go_down the drain. &quot; Early Wednesday morning there was action elsewhere as well . Tension had reached the breaking point at the county tax_collector ' s office , where clerks had been besieged for days by irate taxpayers . * UNNAMED CASHIER County tax_collector ' s office A cashier , who would not give her name because she feared for her job and her safety , watched as a man paid his property_taxes , then spotted a picture of Citron still on the wall despite his resignation three days earlier . The man swore an oath . The cashier : &quot; He said , ' If you don ' t get that f------ picture down , I ' m coming_back with a lynch_mob and a gun and take_care of this place. ' He looked very sane to me , very normal. &quot; Other taxpayers were venting their anger by writing angry messages on their tax_bills . &quot; You name it . They are writing all kinds of things. &quot; Dec . 8 A Step Toward Recovery There is still no normalcy here on California ' s Gold_Coast , formerly land of the largest luxury car dealerships and now home to the nation ' s biggest bankruptcy . But the first signal that , perhaps , this crisis could be managed came Thursday , when the beleaguered county named former state_Treasurer Thomas W . Hayes as financial adviser . Less than 24 hours after Hayes said at a briefing that he was &quot; strongly urged by Gov . Wilson &quot; to take the job , he had a makeshift office in a former conference_room at the Hall of Administration and was hard at_work at his job . On Friday , the sight of Hayes on_the_job gave great comfort to Supervisor Riley , a retired Marine Corps general who served in the Pacific Theater in World_War_II . Riley : &quot; I went_over at 7 a.m. He was in his office having coffee . I realized he had Marine training . He ' s here , working . He was talking on the phone when I walked in . I was pleased to see he was here . The last several days , I had a little better feeling that we ' re in the right direction . He ' s here. &quot; Contributing to this story were Times staff writers Steve Emmons , Nancy Wride , Dennis McLellan , Rebecca Trounson , Dave Lesher , Chris Woodyard , Mack Reed , Lee Romney and Mark Platte .</TEXT>
