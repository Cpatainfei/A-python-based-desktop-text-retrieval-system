   <HEADLINE> U.S. SOUNDS A WARNING ; U.S. MUST ' STOP THE BRUTAL ATROCITIES ' IN HAITI , CLINTON SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here is the text of President Clinton ' s televised speech about Haiti : My fellow Americans , tonight I want to speak with you about why the United States is leading the international effort to restore democratic government in Haiti . Haiti ' s dictators , led by ( Lt. ) Gen . Raoul Cedras , control the most violent regime in our hemisphere . For three years , they have rejected every peaceful solution that the international community has proposed . They have broken an agreement that they made to give_up power . They have brutalized their people and destroyed their economy . And for three years , we and other nations have worked exhaustively to find a diplomatic solution , only to have the dictators reject each one . Now the United States must protect our interests , to stop the brutal atrocities that threaten tens of thousands of Haitians , to secure our borders , and to preserve stability and promote democracy in our hemisphere , and to uphold the reliability of the commitments we make and the commitments others make to us . Earlier today , I ordered Secretary_of_Defense ( William J. ) Perry to call_up the military_reserve personnel necessary to support United States troops in any action we might undertake in Haiti . I have also ordered two aircraft_carriers -- the USS Eisenhower and the USS America -- into the region . I issued these orders after giving full consideration to what is at stake . The message of the United States to the Haitian dictators is clear : Your time is up . Leave now , or we will force you from power . I want the American people to understand the background of the situation in Haiti , how what has happened there affects our national security_interests and why I believe we must act now . Nearly 200 years ago , the Haitian people rose_up out of slavery and declared their independence . Unfortunately , the promise of liberty was quickly snuffed_out , and ever since , Haiti has known more suffering and repression than freedom . In our time , as democracy has spread throughout our hemisphere , Haiti has been left_behind . Then , just four years ago , the Haitian people held the first free and fair elections since their independence . They elected a parliament and a new president -- Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide , a Catholic priest who received almost 70 % of the vote . But eight months later , Haitian dreams of democracy became a nightmare of bloodshed . Gen . Raoul Cedras led a military coup that overthrew President Aristide , the man who had appointed Cedras to lead the army . Resisters were beaten and murdered . The dictators launched a horrible intimidation campaign of rape , torture and mutilation . People starved , children died , thousands of Haitians fled their country , heading to the United States across dangerous seas . At that time , President ( George ) Bush declared the situation posed , and I quote , &quot; an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security , foreign_policy and economy of the United States. &quot; Cedras and his armed thugs have conducted a reign_of_terror , executing children , raping women , killing priests . As the dictators have grown more desperate , the atrocities have grown ever more brutal . Recent news_reports have documented the slaying of Haitian orphans by the nation ' s deadly police thugs . The dictators are said to suspect the children of harboring sympathy toward President Aristide , for no other reason than he ran an orphanage in his days as a parish priest . The children fled the orphanages for the streets , now they can ' t even sleep there because they are so afraid . As one young boy told a visitor , &quot; I do not care if the police kill me , because it only brings an end to my suffering. &quot; A Terrifying Pattern ' International observers uncovered a terrifying pattern of soldiers and policemen raping the wives and daughters of suspected political_dissidents -- young_girls , 13 , 16 years old -- people slain and mutilated with body_parts left as warnings to terrify others ; children forced to watch as their mothers ' faces are slashed with machetes . A year ago the dictators assassinated the minister of justice . Just last month they gunned_down Father Jean-Marie Vincent , a peasant leader and close friend of Father Aristide . Vincent was executed on the doorstep of his home , a monastery . He refused to give_up his ministry , and for that he was murdered . Let me be clear , Gen . Cedras and his accomplices alone are responsible_for this suffering and terrible human tragedy . It is their actions that have isolated Haiti . Neither the international community nor the United States has sought a confrontation . For nearly three years , we ' ve worked hard on diplomatic efforts . The United Nations , the Organization of American_States , the Caribbean Community , the six Central_American presidents -- all have sought a peaceful end to this crisis . We have tried everything -- persuasion and negotiation , mediation and condemnation . Emissaries were dispatched to Port-au-Prince and were turned_away . The United Nations labored for months to reach an agreement acceptable to all parties . Then last year Gen . Cedras himself came here to the United States and signed an agreement on Governors Island in New York in which he pledged to give_up power along with the other dictators . But when the day came for the plan to take_effect , the dictators refused to leave and instead increased the brutality they are using to cling_to power . Even then , the nations of the world continued to seek a peaceful solution while strengthening the embargo we had imposed . We sent massive amounts of humanitarian aid , food for a_million Haitians and medicine , to try to help the ordinary Haitian people as the dictators continued to loot the economy . Then this summer they threw_out the international observers who had blown the whistle on the regime ' s human_rights atrocities . In response to that action , in July the United Nations Security_Council approved a resolution that authorizes the use of all necessary means , including force , to remove the Haitian dictators from power and restore democratic government . Still , we continued to seek a peaceful solution , but the dictators would not even meet with the United Nations special envoy . In the face of this continued defiance and with atrocities rising , the United States has agreed to lead a multinational force to carry_out the will of the United Nations . More_than 20 countries from around the globe -- including almost all_the Caribbean Community and nations from as far away as Poland , which has so recently won its own freedom ; Israel and Jordan , which have been struggling for decades to preserve their own security ; and Bangladesh , a country working_on its own economic problems -- have joined nations like Belgium and Great Britain . They have all agreed to join us because they think this problem in our neighborhood is important to their future interests and their security . I know that the United States cannot , indeed we should not , be the world ' s policeman , and I know this is a time , with the Cold_War over , that so many Americans are reluctant to commit military resources and our personnel beyond our borders . But when brutality occurs close to our shores it affects our national interest and we have a responsibility to act . Thousands of Haitians have already fled toward the United States , risking their lives to escape the reign_of_terror . As long as Cedras rules , Haitians will continue to seek sanctuary in our nation . This year , in less than two months , more_than 21 # 000 Haitians were rescued at_sea by our Coast Guard and Navy . Today , more_than 14 # 000 refugees are living at our naval base in Guantanamo . The American people have already expended almost $ 200 million to support them , to maintain the economic embargo , and the prospect of millions and millions more being spent every month for an indefinite period_of_time loom ahead unless we act . Three hundred_thousand more Haitians , 5 % of their entire population , are in hiding in their own country . If we don ' t act , they could be the next wave of refugees at our door . We will continue to face the threat of a mass exodus of refugees and its constant threat to stability in our region and control of our borders . Tide of Migrants ' No American should be surprised that the recent tide of migrants seeking refuge on our shores comes from Haiti and from Cuba . After all , they are the only nations left in the Western_Hemisphere where democratic government is denied , the only countries where dictators have managed to hold_back the wave of democracy and progress that has swept_over our entire region , and that our own government has so actively promoted and supported for years . Today , 33 of the 35 countries in the Americas have democratically elected leaders , and Haiti is the only nation in our hemisphere where the people actually elected their own government and chose democracy , only to have tyrants steal it away . There is no question that the Haitian people want to embrace democracy ; we know it because they went_to the ballot_box and told the world . History has taught us that preserving democracy in our own hemisphere strengthens America ' s security and prosperity . Democracies here are more likely to keep the peace and to stabilize our region . They are more likely to create free markets and economic opportunity , and to become strong , reliable trading partners , and they are more likely to provide their own people with the opportunities which will encourage them to stay in their nation and to build their own futures . Restoring Haiti ' s democratic government will help lead to more stability and prosperity in our region , just as our actions in Panama and Grenada did . Beyond the human_rights violations , the immigration problems , the importance of democracy , the United States also has strong interest in not letting dictators , especially in our own region , break their word to the United States and the United Nations . In the post Cold_War world we will assure the security and prosperity of the United States with our military strength , our economic power , our constant efforts to promote peace and growth . But when our national security_interests are threatened , we will use diplomacy when possible , and force when necessary . In Haiti , we have a case in which the right is clear , in which the country in_question is nearby , in which our own interests are plain , in which the mission is achievable and limited , and in which the nations of the world stand with us . We must act . Our mission in Haiti , as it was in Panama and Grenada , will be limited and specific . Our plan to remove the dictators will follow two phases . First , it will remove dictators from power and restore Haiti ' s legitimate , democratically elected government . We will train a civilian-controlled Haitian security_force that will protect the people rather than repress them . During this period , police monitors from all around the world will work with the authorities to maximize basic security and civil_order , and minimize retribution . The Haitian people should know that we come_in peace . And you , the American people should know , that our soldiers will not be involved in rebuilding Haiti or its economy . The international community , working together , must provide that economic , humanitarian , and technical assistance necessary to help the Haitians rebuild . When this first phase is completed , the vast majority of our troops will come_home , in months , not years . I want our troops and their families to know that we will bring them home just as soon as we possibly can . Then , in the second phase , a much smaller U.S. force will join forces from other members of the United Nations , and their mission will leave Haiti after elections are held next year and a new Haitian government takes_office in early 1996 . Tonight , I can announce that President Aristide has pledged to step_down when his term ends in accordance with the constitution he has sworn to upheld . He has committed himself to promote reconciliation among all Haitians and to set a historic example by peacefully transferring power to a duly elected successor . He knows , as we know , that when you start a democracy , the most important election is the second election . President Aristide has told me that he will consider his mission fulfilled not when he regains office , but when he leaves_office to the next democratically elected president of Haiti . He has pledged to honor the Haitian voters who put their faith in the ballot_box . ' Soldiers at Risk ' In closing , let me say that I know the American people are rightfully concerned whenever our soldiers are put at risk . Our volunteer military is the world ' s finest , and its leaders have worked hard to minimize risks to all our forces . But the risks are there , and we must be prepared_for that . I assure you that no President makes decisions like this one without deep thought and prayer , but it ' s my job as President and commander_in_chief to take those actions that I believe will best protect our national security_interests . Let me say again , the nations of the world have tried every possible way to restore Haiti ' s democratic government peacefully . The dictators have rejected every possible solution . The terror , the desperation , and the instability will not end until they leave . Once again , I urge them to do so . They can still move now and reduce the chaos and disorder , increase the security , the stability and the safety in which this transfer back to democracy can occur . But if they do not leave now , the international community will act to honor our commitments to give democracy a chance , not to guarantee it ; to remove stubborn and cruel dictators , not to impose a future . I know many people believe that we shouldn ' t help the Haitian people recover their democracy and find their hard-won freedoms , that the Haitians should accept the violence and repression as their fate . But , remember , the same was said of a_people who more_than 200 years ago took_up arms against a tyrant whose forces occupied their land , but they were a stubborn bunch , a_people who fought for their freedoms and appealed_to all those who believed_in democracy to help their cause . And their cries were answered , and a new nation was born , a nation that ever since has believed that the rights of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness should be denied to none . May God bless the people of the United States and the cause of freedom . Good_night .</TEXT>
