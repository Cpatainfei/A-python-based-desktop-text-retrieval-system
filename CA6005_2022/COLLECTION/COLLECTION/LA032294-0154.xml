   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL , PLO NEGOTIATORS MEET IN TUNIS TO ADDRESS IMPASSE ; MIDEAST : U.S. ENVOY , PRESENT AT TALKS , SAY THREE SIDES HELD ' GOOD DISCUSSIONS. ' BUT NO BREAKTHROUGH IS ANNOUNCED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators closeted themselves in Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat ' s villa Monday with America ' s chief Mideast coordinator to try to break the impasse that has stalled Middle_East peace negotiations . Dennis Ross , the State_Department coordinator for the region , said the three sides held &quot; good discussions. &quot; He prepared_for possible consultations with the Israelis at his hotel through the night before his scheduled visit to Damascus this morning . &quot; There ' s still more work to be done , but there ' s work being done that ' s important , and we ' re going to keep at it , &quot; Ross said , leaving Arafat ' s villa shortly before midnight . A PLO official said the talks &quot; went well &quot; but needed more time . &quot; I think we ' re getting_to the point where we can see that an agreement is possible , &quot; he said . Arafat met for several hours with an Israeli delegation headed by Uri Savir , director general of Israel ' s Foreign Ministry , before meeting with Ross to discuss the possible resumption of Palestinian self-rule talks , frozen since the massacre of about 30 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque by a Jewish settler last month . The two sides then held another round of talks Monday night , as the United States tried to find common_ground on Palestinian demands for increased security for Palestinians in the occupied West_Bank and Gaza Strip in the wake of the mosque attack . PLO sources said the proposals offered by Israel -- reportedly including a Palestinian police_force in Hebron under Israeli control , designation of Red_Cross observers as all or part of an international force in the occupied territories and rounding_up Jewish settlers in the Hebron area into a single location -- are still insufficient . Arafat is said to have responded derisively to the proposal for Red_Cross observers in place of the armed international force of observers sought by the PLO . &quot; He thought the idea was funny , &quot; a PLO official said . &quot; Some people are now even starting to make jokes about it -- about how the international observers will come_in with Band-Aids instead of guns. &quot; Another Arafat adviser said the PLO rejected Israel ' s move for relocating Hebron settlers into a single group , insisting that all_of them be moved_out of the area . The PLO has also rejected the idea of a Palestinian police_force under Israeli control . But there were indications as the talks progressed that some common_ground may be possible to get the negotiations back on track , if not as early as Thursday , when Israel Radio reported hopes for a meeting in Paris between Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres . One PLO official said the Israeli delegation seemed to be sympathetic to the PLO need for a public move_on Palestinian security in the wake of widespread anger and growing opposition to the peace process among Palestinians in the occupied territories after the Hebron massacre . &quot; I think they ' re realistic enough to know that we need something , &quot; a PLO official said . &quot; The most important thing is to start the negotiations again so we can get the Israeli army out of Gaza and Jericho . that ' s the first_step . Because I don ' t think any of us are so naive not to know that when it comes_down to a confrontation between Palestinians and a Jewish settler , which side the army ' s going_to be on. &quot; Yasser Abed-Rabbo , head of the PLO ' s information department , said the meetings Monday afternoon consisted mainly of an exchange of views . &quot; There were no results until now , &quot; he added . Peres , in remarks broadcast Monday , said he expected the PLO to participate in peace talks along with Syria , Lebanon and Jordan in early April . In Israel , meantime , there was speculation in the media Monday that Israel might show some flexibility on troop withdrawals . The Hebrew daily Maariv reported that Israel is prepared to begin withdrawing troops from Gaza even before a final agreement is reached in a renewed round of negotiations . Times staff writer Mark Fineman in Jerusalem contributed to this report .</TEXT>
