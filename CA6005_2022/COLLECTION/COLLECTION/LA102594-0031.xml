   <TEXT> The government of Yitzhak Rabin explains all_the murder and violence with a new cliche , &quot; Victims of Peace. &quot; This is unacceptable . By signing a peace_treaty with Jordan , Rabin abrogates the hard-earned trust he built with Yasser Arafat . He gives the right of caring for the holy_places to the king of Jordan , poking Arafat in the eye , along with telling him to deal with starving Palestinians in Gaza and the West_Bank . In the eyes of Hamas , Arafat has been diminished . Rabin ' s recent statement placing the blame on all Palestinians is wrong . Hamas is the culprit and Arafat cannot control Hamas . The new civil unrest between Arabs will travel from Gaza to the West Gank to Golan to Jordan and back to Tel Aviv . Israel ' s only way to ensure peace is to immediately stop all peace negotiations with all Arab countries . No talks , official or secret , should be held until the Arab countries realize that Jewish blood is not cheap . We cannot go_on burying our dead with the words , &quot; May they rest in peace. &quot;</TEXT>
