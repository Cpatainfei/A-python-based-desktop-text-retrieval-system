   <HEADLINE> SUPERVISORS OPPOSE INITIATIVE TARGETING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Weighing in on the volatile issue of illegal immigration , the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to oppose a statewide ballot initiative that would deny many public_services to undocumented residents . The board ' s 3-2 vote , with Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana dissenting , was an advisory motion that carries no force but sends an important political message . The emotional topic attracted about two_dozen supporters and opponents who sought to sway the board in a lively two-hour public_debate . The controversial measure -- called &quot; save our state &quot; by its backers -- will appear on the Nov . 8 ballot as Proposition 187 . The initiative would deny public education and emergency health_care to illegal immigrants and their children . School and health officials would be required to report children and parents they suspect of being here illegally and law_enforcement agencies would have to cooperate with the Immigration and Naturalization Service in finding illegal immigrants . Supporters argued that the measure would force illegal immigrants to return to their homelands by cutting_off social benefits they say act_as a magnet . &quot; There is no other country in the world that provides a free credit_card for cradle-to-grave services as we do , &quot; said Antonovich . But opponents called the measure mean-spirited and pointless . &quot; I don ' t support illegal entry into the U.S. , but the county of Los Angeles has a responsibility under federal law to provide services to those who present themselves for care , &quot; said Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke .</TEXT>
