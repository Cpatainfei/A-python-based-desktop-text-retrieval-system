   <HEADLINE> GARDENING ; GET AN INSTANT LAWN OFF ON SOLID_GROUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You can purchase strips of sod , which is lawn grass with an inch or so of attached soil , to create an &quot; instant lawn &quot; to cover bare ground or to repair existing lawn . Cool , moist weather is ideal for establishing sod . Sod is sold in strips of a_few feet long and 12- to 24-inches wide . Quality sod should be free_of weeds and pests and be of a type of grass adapted to your site . Arrange for delivery no more_than a_couple_of days or so before you are going_to lay sod . Occasionally sprinkle stored sod strips with enough water to keep them moist but not saturated . You cannot expect sod simply placed upon the ground to grow -- the site must be prepared first . Before working the soil , pick_up a clump and squeeze it to make_sure that it is at the correct moisture level . The clump should crumble with slight pressure . If the soil wads up , it is too wet ; wait for it to dry_out a bit . If the clump is rock hard , it is too dry ; sprinkle it the day before you begin . If the ground is covered with heavy weed growth or existing lawn , strip it off with a shovel or a rented sod stripper to make subsequent rototilling easier . Before tilling , also cover the ground with any lime or sulfur needed to adjust the soil pH and a three-inch layer of some organic material such_as rotted manure , spent mushroom soil , compost or peat_moss . Also spread a high phosphorus fertilizer , such_as 10-20-20 or 5-15-15 , at the rate of 25 pounds per thousand square_feet . Rototill the area lengthwise and crosswise , loosening the soil to a depth of six inches . Do not overtill ; your objective is to leave the soil in pea-sized granules , not dust . Next , rake the surface smooth , discarding rocks and other debris . Roll the surface lightly with an empty lawn roller , and you are ready to lay_down the strips of sod . Lay the first row of sod along a straight_line in such a way that the sod strip is not buckled or stretched at any point . Use your driveway or a path as a guide . Otherwise , use a string stretched tightly between two stakes . Unroll each sod strip , taking_care to avoid tearing , and press it firmly into position . Sod will shrink slightly after it has been laid , so do not stretch it as you put it down , especially where edges meet . If the weather is hot , periodically sprinkle the sod with water . Lay a plank on the first row to distribute your weight as you begin on the next row . Snug the next row , once again to allow_for shrinkage . To avoid concentrating breaks_in the sod in one area , stagger the joints between the pieces in the row so that they do not align with those in the first row . Continue subsequent rows similarly , standing on a plank as you work , staggering joints and sprinkling with water if the weather is hot . When you reach an edge of your lawn , cut the sod to size either with a sharp spade or a serrated knife , such_as a bread_knife . Once the whole ground is covered with sod , go_over it with a roller weighted just enough to get_rid_of air_pockets and to ensure good contact between the sod and the underlying soil . Roll first at right_angles to the strips , then in the direction of the strips . After rolling , gently fluff_up the grass blades with a bamboo rake . You are now finished laying_down the sod . But don ' t just walk away from your new lawn after giving it an admiring look . The top inch of sod must_not dry_out until the roots knit to the underlying ground , so set_up your sprinkler and apply enough water to wet the soil six inches deep . And on every sunny , warm day for the following few weeks , water lightly . Pay special attention to sod near pavement , because those areas dry_out quickest and may need heavier spot watering . As roots from the sod grow_into the soil below , approach a normal watering schedule . If possible , keep_off the grass for the few weeks it takes sod to establish .</TEXT>
