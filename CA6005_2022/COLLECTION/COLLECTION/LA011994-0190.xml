   <HEADLINE> LATEST BOSNIA TALKS OFFER LITTLE HOPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new round of Bosnia peace talks appeared doomed to failure Tuesday , after a day of fruitless wrangling over a map dividing the former Yugoslav republic into three ethnic ministates . Bosnian Serb , Muslim and Croat leaders agreed to prolong their negotiations into a second day today but held_out little hope of an agreement to end the 21-month-old conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina . &quot; The atmosphere around the negotiations has never been less conducive &quot; to peace , U.N. mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg said before the talks . &quot; There is very small chance that the Muslims will accept ( a deal ) , &quot; Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told journalists after more_than 10 hours of discussions at Geneva ' s Palais des Nations . &quot; They want more war. &quot; The Muslims also said no headway had been made . &quot; We have tried once again , but ( the Serbs ) still do not want to return territories seized by force , &quot; said Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic . Bosnia ' s U.N. ambassador , Muhamed Sacirbey , even said the talks could collapse .</TEXT>
