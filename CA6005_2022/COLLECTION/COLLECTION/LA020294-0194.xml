   <HEADLINE> ANAHEIM MAYOR , POLICE UNION CHIEF TALKING PRIVATELY ; LABOR : DISCUSSIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED AS ' FENCE-MENDING. ' WAGE DISPUTE HAS LASTED 18 MONTHS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The president of the police association and the city ' s mayor have been meeting privately in an effort to resolve the officers ' acrimonious 18-month wage dispute . Both officials declined to discuss details , although police union President Bruce Bottolfson characterized the sessions so far as largely &quot; fence-mending &quot; to &quot; bury the hatchet. &quot; Bottolfson , president of the Anaheim Police Assn. , speculated that Mayor Tom Daly made the initiative because he is &quot; looking_for recognition &quot; for putting the deal together . The mayor is protecting his own political interests , Bottolfson said , adding : &quot; I don ' t care , though . If Tom can put the deal together , great. &quot; Daly , for his part , rejected Bottolfson ' s talk_about ulterior motives . &quot; I would n ' t characterize it quite that way , &quot; he said . &quot; I just want to get_to settle this in a fair way . If and when there is an agreement there will be plenty of credit to go around. &quot; The union president added that &quot; Daly , to us , has been the evil emperor. &quot; The contract dispute between the city and police_officers has resulted in several public protests by the officers , including a 24-hour &quot; blue flu &quot; job action two weeks ago . Nearly 200 officers participated in the job action . Anaheim officers have been working without a contract since July , 1992 , and have not had a raise since July , 1991 . The officers are seeking a 10 % raise through July , 1995 , which would cost the city about $ 7.5 million . The city has offered a 6.5 % raise until 1995 with an additional 3.25 % to 5 % raise in 1996 , depending_on the inflation_rate . That package is worth about $ 5.2 million . City officials have insisted that they cannot afford to meet the union ' s demands . Throughout the negotiations , Daly has come under_fire from the police association for what it calls a lack of leadership on the issue . Councilmen Bob D . Simpson and Fred Hunter have also criticized the mayor for failing to resolve the dispute . At one point , an officer , frustrated by the impasse , purposefully ticketed the mayor ' s car for expired vehicle tags , department sources said . Daly acknowledges receiving the ticket but said : &quot; I don ' t have any factual basis for the officer ' s motivation. &quot; And , he said , &quot; I certainly don ' t expect any special treatment. &quot; The mayor said he still believes the offer the city has made to the police is fair , especially with the city facing an $ 8-million deficit next fiscal_year . In fact , he said , &quot; we aren ' t entirely sure how we are going_to pay_for this offer on the table . . . but we want to recognize the outstanding work of the officers . They do a great job. &quot; Daly also said he is committed to increasing the number of officers in the department from 352 to about 400 in the next several years . He has asked city staff to try and find funding for those positions . The city is seeking a federal grant to help fund 22 new police positions . City officials were told Tuesday by White_House officials that they should learn in a_couple_of weeks whether the city will receive the grant .</TEXT>
