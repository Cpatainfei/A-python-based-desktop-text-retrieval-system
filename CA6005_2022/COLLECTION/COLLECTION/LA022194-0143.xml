   <TEXT> Feuding Yemeni leaders signed a reconciliation agreement Sunday designed to end a six-month leadership crisis and bring_about political and economic reforms . In a state ceremony here , Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his vice_president , Ali Salim Bidh , signed the 32-page document , which also bore the signatures of 39 other Yemeni politicians . The agreement envisages a dilution of presidential powers and decentralization of authority aimed at better distribution of resources and economic development . Bidh and his southern Yemeni followers have accused the northern Yemenis , led by Saleh , of trying to dominate the country and failing to unify the armed forces . Present-day Yemen was created in May , 1990 , when North Yemen and South Yemen merged , but it has been plagued by political violence and a breakdown in law and order .</TEXT>
