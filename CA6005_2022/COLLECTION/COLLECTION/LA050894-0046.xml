   <HEADLINE> VENETIAN_BLIND ; FLORIAN DEFINITELY SPEAKS ITALIAN -- BUT THE MENU DOESN ' T EXACTLY SHOUT VENICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the way to Florian , a 6-month-old restaurant named after the celebrated 18th-Century coffeehouse on St . Mark ' s Square in Venice , I went_over my favorite Venetian dishes in my mind : baccala mantecato ( salt_cod whipped with milk or cream ) , sarde in saor ( fresh sardines marinated in a sweet , vinegary sauce ) , tiny cuttlefish stewed in their ink , risi e bisi ( rice and fresh peas ) , fegato alla veneziana , arguably the most famous of Venetian dishes -- calves ' liver cooked with onions and a splash of vinegar . Not one of these classic Venetian dishes was_on the menu . The setting is lovely , however . I ' m charmed by the beautifully painted panels of still_lifes and pale attentuated torsos ( near the ladies ' room , a disembodied hand tweaks a rosy nipple ) . Old-fashioned wall sconces and silk shades edged with braid cast a soft light that is reflected in round , bejeweled mirrors . With only a slight suspension of belief , the decor , inherited from the previous tenant , Tryst , suggests a restaurant on one of the watery city ' s back canals . Aside from that , though , I have trouble understanding why Florian considers itself a Venetian restaurant . The menu includes dishes from all_over Italy -- from Rome , Sardinia , Bologna , Milan , Tuscany and Naples -- while only a handful of true Venetian dishes make the cut : pasta e fagioli , a fish soup , pasta and risotto cooked with various combinations of seafood -- and tiramisu , of course . The menu is the culinary equivalent of Venetian gondoliers singing &quot; O Sole Mio &quot; or &quot; Santa Lucia &quot; for so_long that few visitors are aware the songs extol Naples , not Venice . A restaurant ' s decor , music and menu all do their part to create the illusion that , for this evening , we really are in Tuscany or Provence or New Orleans , at least in spirit . Call the place Mediterranean . Call it Italian . Call it Venetian . Call it whatever you like , but the food should bear more_than a passing resemblance to its namesake cuisine . If the kitchen concentrated_on authentic Venetian cooking ( hard to find in Venice , admittedly ) and cooked it well , Florian would have my heartfelt respect . Instead , we get many of the same old standbys . That said , Florian serves decent , but certainly not memorable , Italian food . What sets it apart is the charming setting and the professionalism of the ever-present Tancredi De Luca , previously maitre d ' at Toscana . Chef Enrico Trova gives a number of dishes a California twist . Mostly this consists_of turning every_other plate into a salad . An antipasto of bresaola , a ruddy cured beef , and Parmesan shavings is heaped with arugula leaves , and the subtly delicious swordfish carpaccio gets its bit of greens , too . Penne alla arrabbiata , a classic dried pasta dish , is dressed_up with grilled chicken , which makes about as much sense as adding poultry to Caesar_salad . I liked both the wonderful rustic pasta e fagioli and the rough-textured minestrone . Pastas have their ups and downs . The spaghetti alla bottarga , made with pressed gray_mullet roe and tossed with toasted bread crumbs and arugula , has a faint tang of the sea . Tagliatelle ai profumi delle Langhe was a disappointment , not for the fragrant sauce of porcini and vegetables but for the quality of the pasta itself . These heavy noodles little resembled the glorious , tender and silky tagliatelle from Piedmont . The risotto Billy Wilder is a confetti of colorful vegetables . The mixed grill of seafood with lemon and capers is consistently one of the best dishes on the menu . A breaded Milanese-style veal chop comes_with oily thick-cut potato_chips for a cholesterol-clogging main_course . The lamb in bread crust arrived more or less medium-rare , but less than appealing wrapped in a soggy white-bread blanket . On the other hand , osso_buco , gentle in flavor and texture , is a respectable-enough version . Florian is very pleasant weekdays at lunch , when you can order from an extensive menu of cold and hot stuzzichini , described as little dishes to mix-and-match tapas-style . With the_French doors open , the glare of the light along La Cienega comes_close , very close , to the quality of light reflected off the water in Venice . Nibbling on half_a_dozen little dishes -- grilled-chicken-and-potato salad perfumed with balsamic vinegar , prosciutto with sliced pear , a thin-crusted pizza topped with fresh arugula and pecorino shavings -- the illusion was good_enough that I almost expected to hear &quot; Santa Lucia. &quot; Florian Ristorante , 401 N . La Cienega Blvd. , Los Angeles ; ( 310 ) 289 - 1600 . Open nightly for dinner and Monday through Friday for lunch . Full bar . Valet parking . All major credit_cards accepted . Dinner for two , food only , $ 45 to $ 80 .</TEXT>
