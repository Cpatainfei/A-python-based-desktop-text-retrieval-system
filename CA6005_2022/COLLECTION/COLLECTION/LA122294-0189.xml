   <HEADLINE> DOUBLE-MURDER CASE MAY NEED 2ND JURY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prosecutors probably will ask_for a second jury to be called_in the penalty phase of Sergio Nelson ' s murder trial , after a first jury deadlocked earlier this week , said Richard Jenkins , head deputy district_attorney in Pomona . Nelson , 20 , of La Verne , was found guilty Dec . 13 of first-degree murder in the Oct . 2 , 1993 , deaths of Robin Shirley , 23 , and Lee Thompson , 22 , both of Pomona . The jury that convicted Nelson could not decide whether to recommend the death_penalty or life without possibility of parole . Although 11 jurors voted for the death_penalty , one person held_out for life in prison , causing a mistrial to be called Tuesday in the penalty phase . Such an occurrence is rare but not unheard of , Jenkins said . A hearing Jan . 10 will decide if a second jury for the penalty phase will be called . Because the case involves multiple murder and because the first jury overwhelmingly voted for the death_penalty , a request for a second jury is likely , Jenkins said . Nelson , who lived with his grandmother , had worked_at the Target store on Foothill Boulevard for about a year . Tension had been growing between him and Shirley in the weeks leading_up to the shooting , police said . Shirley , a Target employee for nearly three years , was given a promotion that Nelson had sought . Prosecutor Gary Hearnsberger argued that Nelson waited for Shirley and killed her at 4 a.m. as she and Thompson sat in Thompson ' s car outside the store waiting for their shifts to begin . Thompson was a new employee who police said happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . But Assistant Public_Defender Roger Whitenhill said Nelson , who suffered from paranoid_schizophrenia since 1991 , was in no mental_state to plan the murders . A second jury would not rehear the entire case but would hear enough of the evidence to decide on the penalty , Jenkins said .</TEXT>
