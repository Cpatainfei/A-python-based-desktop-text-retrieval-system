   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; NORWAY ' S RETURN TO THE PEAK ; PROUD OF THEIR WINTER SPORTS HERITAGE , NORWEGIANS DOMINATED DECADES OF OLYMPIC GAMES . AFTER AN EMBARRASSING SLUMP , THE REVITALIZED NATIONAL TEAM IS PRIMED TO ICE THE COMPETITION AGAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To stunned Norwegians , the humbling events of the 1988 Winter_Olympics were as hard to imagine as having to stand on a table in a crowded cafe and sing the Swedish national_anthem . It was bad enough that they had to listen to the Swedish anthem four times from Calgary , while their athletes -- for the first time since the Winter Games began in 1924 -- won zero gold medals . While the tabloid headlines screamed &quot; disaster , &quot; the more thoughtful newspapers pondered whether elite sports were still as important in a modern , egalitarian society as they were in the days when Norway ' s winter athletes were kicking the rest of the world ' s collective behind . It seems the country ' s sports leaders , with encouragement from the government , concluded the answer to that question was &quot; yes. &quot; Six years ago , they established a program called Olympiatoppen to improve Norway ' s standing in world sports . Olympiatoppen ( loosely , &quot; striving to reach the Olympic summit &quot; ) created the financial_backing and centralized training system needed to make a national sports program successful . When the program ' s director , Thor Ole Rimejorde , a career military_officer , reviewed the results from Calgary , he saw no gold medals . But he did see a golden future . &quot; We won only five medals in 1988 , but we had many young athletes in places four through 10 , &quot; Rimejorde said recently in an interview in his Oslo office . &quot; I knew we were about to move ahead of other countries. &quot; Rimejorde needs only three seconds to name one of those countries -- Sweden , whose relationship with Norway is the geopolitical equivalent of a sibling rivalry . Swedes sometimes even refer to their Scandinavian neighbors as &quot; little_brothers , &quot; which Norwegians do not find especially endearing . &quot; I was very pleased I was not responsible_for Swedish sport because their four gold medals were largely the work of two men , &quot; Rimejorde said . &quot; What has happened since is exactly as I forecast in ' 88 . We are the success ; the Swedes are the fiasco. &quot; Norway ' s slide from Olympic prominence started in 1968 but hit bottom in goldless ' 88 . Not even Rimejorde expected success to be so clear so soon . During the 1992 Winter_Olympics in the_French Alps , Norwegians won 20 medals , nine of them gold , to finish third behind Germany and the since-disbanded Unified Team of former Soviet republics . And now , with the Olympics coming_to Lillehammer , which , town leaders frequently remind visitors , edged out a Swedish candidate for the right to stage the Games , Norway could top the medal standings_for the sixth time -- the first such coup since 1968 . How are characteristically reserved Norwegians handling the anticipation of an avalanche of gold ? Like backslapping , yahooing Dallas Cowboy fans . Forty-eight hours before Saturday ' s opening ceremony at Lillehammer Olympic Park , they are arriving here by the trainload , sporting Viking helmets , Norwegian flags painted on their faces , clanging cowbells and flasks of the national bellywarmer , a potent tonic called aquavit . Norway ' s rediscovered athletic prowess has bred a new concern . &quot; We have to be nice to the world and let them win some gold medals or they will have not such a good time , &quot; said Gerhard Heiberg , an Oslo industrialist who serves as president of the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee . &quot; The people of sport in Norway say I should shut up. &quot; Those people of sport acknowledge that their team ' s resurgence in part arises from the dismantling of the ultra-efficient , state-supported medal machines in the former Soviet_Union and East_Germany . But they also give themselves credit for forming Olympiatoppen after disappointing results in the 1984 Winter and Summer Olympics . They add , however , that the goal was not just to climb in the medal standings but to combat a national malaise borne of the oil boom in the late 1970s and early ' 80s that enriched many Norwegians financially , putting two cars in every garage , televisions in every bedroom and potatoes on every couch . Norwegians fancy themselves rugged outdoorsmen , the snowier and colder it is the better . They argue with the Swedes over whose country should be known as &quot; the cradle of skiing &quot; and like to say that their babies are born with skis on . After winning three gold medals in cross-country_skiing in 1992 , Vegard Ulvang , 30 , said : &quot; I am always amused to read in the foreign press how a Russian or Italian athlete can recall the precise day he was given his first pair of skis . We in Norway can never remember this because we are too young when it happens. &quot; But in recent years , teen-agers have forsaken their skis for MTV and video_games . &quot; I can remember when skiing was a mode of transportation , then our most popular recreation after it became so easy to travel_by car and bus , &quot; Rimejorde said . &quot; Our concern was that it someday would become only a spectator sport and we would become a lazy people. &quot; One aim of Olympiatoppen , he said , was to create new ski heroes , whom the program ' s leaders hoped would become role_models for the nation ' s youth . The government shot even higher , hoping that the success of the skiers would serve as an inspiration to the entire country . Star athletes can serve as models of &quot; team_spirit and cooperation , &quot; Prime_Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said during the 1992 Winter_Olympics . &quot; We must learn from our sports heroes because we are going_to need more of their initiative and perseverance , &quot; she said . &quot; Excellence must become typically Norwegian both inside and outside sports stadiums. &quot; Her message , however , was intended not only for Norwegians but also for the 12 nations of the European Community . Although Norway is divided over whether to become a member , Brundtland wants desperately for the country to be wanted . John Hoberman , a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has written extensively about the Olympic movement , criticized her in a syndicated column for exploiting sports for political purposes . &quot; She played the Olympic card very cleverly , &quot; he wrote . &quot; Her message was that Norwegian businessmen could play with the big boys in the economic major_leagues , that sheer self-confidence could accomplish wonders. &quot; Norway ' s sports leaders know that the secret of their success is not that simple . Tradition , of course , was part of the mix , particularly in sports such_as cross-country_skiing , ski_jumping and speed_skating that provided most of Norway ' s medals when it topped the medal standings in five of six Winter Games between 1924 and 1952 . ( Except for speed_skating , most of those sports originated_in Scandinavia. ) Passionate about cross-country_skiing , Norwegians ordered so many tickets for this year ' s events that the 31 # 000-seat Birkebeiner Stadium could have sold_out six times over . Of the unlucky losers in the ticket lottery , up_to 40 # 000 are expected to line the course each day . Ulvang is Norway ' s most popular athlete , and not just because he won three gold medals in ' 92 . He personifies the image many Norwegians have of themselves as a_people , an explorer-adventurer who has hiked across Mongolia , canoed across Siberia , skied through Greenland and climbed the highest peaks on five continents . While Americans have been following the daily saga of figure skaters Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding , Norwegians have been transfixed by Ulvang ' s lonely treks into the wilderness in an attempt to find his brother , who disappeared during a snowstorm last October . On almost as_many magazine covers , however , are the alpine -- or downhill -- skiers , whose discipline until recently was so little respected in Norway that their results were not even listed in the sports pages under skiing . They were listed under alpine , which as far as most Norwegians were concerned , had more to do with sipping hot wine in front of a fireplace in France or Switzerland than actually skiing . But Olympiatoppen embraced alpine skiing because it attracted the Nintendo generation , which was enthralled by the speed and danger . In the 1992 Olympics , Norway won four alpine medals , including its first since 1952 . The Norwegian Olympic Committee ' s annual spending budget of $ 7.2 million , much of it contributed by corporations and the remainder by the government , has increased by almost 250 % in the last six years . But officials said that how much money is spent is less important than how it is spent . &quot; Knowing we are a small nation with only 4.3 million people , it ' s not wise_to spend our resources on many sports , &quot; said Arne Myhrvold , president of Norway ' s Olympic Committee . &quot; We have to concentrate_on a_few people in a_few sports . &quot; This has led to discussions , for instance , with the athletics ( track_and_field ) federation , which wants to back all disciplines . We say : ' It would be a waste_of_money to spend it on the 100 meters . The Africans and Americans have too_much talent for us. ' But if you are an individual in long-distance running , we are willing to help you. &quot; Norway ' s love for the winter sports is so great that its Olympic committee spends half of its budget on five winter sports and the other half on 39 summer sports . Those in the favored sports are encouraged to trade information with each other . And athletes are expected to participate in numerous pursuits outside their primary sports -- including rock climbing , parachute jumping , karate and ballet -- in_order to have a well-rounded training base . It ' s Norway ' s version of cross-training . &quot; We are considering bungee jumping , &quot; said Ola K . Bakke , head of the alpine skiing federation . As a mental exercise , one of Norway ' s leading violinists , Arve Tellefsen , meets with athletes to share his method of collecting himself after a disappointing concert . Myhrvold said Olympiatoppen has achieved so_much so soon that the Japanese want to use it as a model for their athletes leading to the 1998 Winter_Olympics in Nagano . Infinitely more satisfying for the Norwegians : Even the Swedes -- who won only one gold medal in 1992 -- have copied some of their training methods . Medal Madness Norway ' s Olympic team won no gold medals in 1988 , triggering that has had striking results .
