   <HEADLINE> DISABLED MOTORISTS PRAISE CAR PHONE PROGRAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Unable to walk very far because of multiple_sclerosis , Rebecca Maxwell of Port Hueneme was virtually stranded after her car broke_down three years ago on a freeway shoulder . Only after a good_Samaritan pulled over and gave her a lift was the 37-year-old woman able to leave the dangerous shoulder . It is a predicament that long haunted Phyllis Ellis of Thousand Oaks as well . &quot; You don ' t know when something ' s going_to happen , &quot; said Ellis , 67 , who uses a wheelchair because of post-polio syndrome . &quot; If I ( did ) break_down . . . I would be at everybody ' s mercy on the freeway. &quot; But for Ellis , Maxwell and 233 other disabled motorists in Ventura County , the situation has changed dramatically . Since July , 1993 , the county Transportation Commission has spent about $ 70 # 000 to distribute portable telephones to physically disabled motorists who , in response to a recent survey , have given glowing praise to the only program of its kind in California . The free cellular_phones enable those who cannot readily use roadside call_boxes to instead call 911 from their cars . &quot; This service saved my life by giving me freedom to go_out of the house and feel secure and safe , &quot; an anonymous respondent wrote to the commission . &quot; The phone is like insurance , &quot; another wrote . &quot; You hope you never need it but it ' s reassuring to have it. &quot; To pay_for the program , the county assesses drivers a $ 1 vehicle registration surcharge whose funds are earmarked for call_boxes and other emergency highway services . &quot; It ' s proven to be a program that isn ' t terrible costly and is very easy to administer , &quot; program manager Christopher Stephens said . &quot; It didn ' t create another bureaucracy. &quot; Since circulating its questionnaire in September , the Transportation Commission has received about 160 responses from disabled recipients throughout the county . More_than 20 % indicated they had used their phones to seek personal roadside assistance . Another 20 % called 911 to report incidents or emergencies they had witnessed while driving . As many people used the phones within the county as beyond its limits , particularly in the San Fernando Valley , Agoura Hills and other Los Angeles County communities . &quot; The overwhelming response is tremendously positive , &quot; said commission Executive_Director Ginger Gherardi , whose agency instituted the program to conform_to what the county sees as the spirit of the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act . The federal law , whose specific applications are still being debated , mandates that people with disabilities be able to use transportation services that are available to the general public . But whether such services include call_boxes is not yet clear , Stephens said . &quot; Regardless of how it shakes out , we will have had a program in Ventura County that has been helping people for a number of years , &quot; he added . The cellular_phones , which cost the commission about $ 275 each , are available only to disabled motorists who live_in Ventura County and can be used only to call 911 , unless the user pays_for more extensive service . About 10 are distributed each month by the Transportation Commission . Ventura resident Martin Heyneman , 43 , who uses a wheelchair 80 % of the time because of multiple_sclerosis , said cellular_phones are vital because cars typically break_down so far from call_boxes that most disabled people could not reach them . Maxwell , who now uses a wheelchair , said of her cellular_phone , &quot; I don ' t know what I ' d do without it . It ' s extremely helpful. &quot; She added that she has twice used the portable phone , once to call_for help when her car would not start and another time to call emergency crews to remove a stalled vehicle that blocked traffic on a Ventura street .</TEXT>
