   <HEADLINE> THE LINE THAT ROARS ; MARCH OF ' THE LION KING ' CHARACTERS IS_ON AS DISNEY UNLEASHES ITS NEWEST PARADE ATTRACTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To paraphrase a passage from Disney ' s new animated film , &quot; The Lion King , &quot; the dancing leop ards are in a bit of a spot , the monkeys make apes of themselves on the floats , and you just can ' t forget the &quot; puppetronic &quot; elephant . And those are just some of the noteworthy elements in &quot; The Lion King Celebration &quot; parade , which will be presented twice daily at Disneyland throughout the summer starting on Friday . &quot; We ' ve never used an Audio-Animatronic ( character ) in a parade before , &quot; said show director Robert Ponce . &quot; that ' s Zazu the bird . We have two 10-foot-long remote-controlled crocodiles and three remote-controlled bugs including a scorpion and a dung_beetle . We ' ve got probably the most extensive puppets ever built , worked by a puppeteer so movements are more fluid than robotic-type puppetry . &quot; We also have waterfalls on the floats , and a release of white pigeons every day . We stock about 400 homing pigeons to be able to do_it . Actually , they go_to La Habra Heights and they ' re shipped back in the mornings. &quot; If you thought the &quot; Aladdin &quot; parade was magic , a banner quoting the genie at the end of that procession says it all : &quot; I ' m outta here ! &quot; The Aladdin version makes its final run today . The movie &quot; The Lion King &quot; opens with the presentation of the newborn Simba , heir of Mufasa , king of beasts . It isn ' t long before Simba ' s evil uncle , Scar , is getting the young lion_cub into all kinds of trouble , with lifelong repercussions , despite the watchful eye of major-domo Zazu , a hornbill . Scar ' s henchmen include a trio of hyenas . When Simba ' s father dies , the cub flees in undeserved shame , but he is lucky enough to meet a pair of &quot; no-worries &quot; sidekicks , wart hog Pumbaa and meerkat Timon . Rafiki , the shaman-like baboon , gets Simba back on the right track . Each section of the &quot; Lion King &quot; parade -- which is a street show representing the African continent from the rain_forest to the Serengeti -- represents a different passage in Simba ' s life from cub to king . The production features more_than 85 performers . Zazu and Rafiki lead the parade . Disney-adorable puppetronic characters include walk-about blinking rhinoceroses and 17-foot-tall ear-wiggling giraffes . ( Puppetronic refers to both electronic and manual moving parts , the latter worked by a person inside the costume. ) Rain sticks , gourds and drums are handed_out to parade-watchers , to make the production interactive . You do have to give the instruments back , though . The tropical_rain_forest float actually &quot; rains , &quot; but there were even more realistic touches at a preview on Sunday . It seemed hot as a savannah , for instance , and Whoopi Goldberg , the voice of one the film ' s hyenas , was among spectators who baked in the afternoon sun . According to Disney spokesman John McClintock , Goldberg expressed disappointment that the parade didn ' t feature hyenas . But , McClintock explained , &quot; The parade all takes_place after the story is over , at which point the hyenas have been driven from the pride lands. &quot; Cheech Marin , who also played a hyena , and Ernie Sabella , voice of wart hog Pumbaa , also attended . A 650-member choir singing the African-style songs lent the preview event the air of a roof-raising gospel celebration , but the parade will have to settle for humbler backup on an everyday basis . A studio mix of the music is planned . The parade route runs from Small World past the Matterhorn and down Main_Street U.S.A. The song &quot; Just can ' t Wait to be King , &quot; from Simba ' s carefree cub days , accompanies the parade as it travels , while the more emotional &quot; Circle of Life &quot; plays_out in stationary presentations along the route . The music by Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice proved so infectious that , even at a truncated version of the parade contrived for media photo opportunities earlier that afternoon , park visitors fell_in behind like a scene right out of &quot; The Music Man. &quot; The parade tries to provide something for all ages . At the preview , youngsters delighted in the crocodiles , who came_up_to them jaws agape , and gazed up in wonder and admiration at Simba and Nala ( his girlfriend ) , on their 31-foot-high float . Adults universally seemed taken with the dancing . By comparison , the &quot; Aladdin &quot; parade looked positively static . Though the &quot; Lion King &quot; parade is a spin-off from the movie , one spectator , Donna Fiske of Fountain Valley , felt it actually eclipsed the screen version . &quot; I liked the movie , too , but the parade was better , &quot; Fiske said . &quot; It generated more of a feeling of excitement. &quot; Where and When What : &quot; The Lion King Celebration &quot; parade . When : Friday , July 1 , through Sept . 5 , at 2 and 4:30 p.m daily . ( Call_for time after Sept . 5. ) Where : Disneyland , 1313 Harbor Blvd. , Anaheim .
