   <HEADLINE> FIRST_PERSON : LEARNING DIGNITY FROM A GENERATION THAT KNOWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a hot June day in 1944 , my aunt ' s high_school graduation ceremony -- behind barbed_wire , under an armed-guard tower -- was cut_short by a fierce dust_storm . My aunt , who wore a dreary gray cap and gown , fled to her barracks in the U.S._government ' s internment_camp in Poston , Ariz . Her graduation gift was a piece of chocolate_cake . Fifty years later , I watched with mixed emotions as my aunt and 12 other Japanese Americans finally got the graduation ceremony they should have had in Los Angeles . To a standing_ovation last month at their Class of ' 44 reunion , Los Angeles school district officials presented the Japanese Americans with replicas of the diplomas they would have received in 1944 , had they not been torn from Theodore Roosevelt High_School in Boyle Heights . One woman accepted her diploma with a traditional , waist-deep bow , grateful for getting something that was rightfully hers 50 years late . Later , I was saddened when my aunt , 68-year-old June Tawa Nakano , told a Japanese-English daily paper : &quot; The school did a wonderful deed for us . It brought our spirit back like we were good citizens. &quot; I found their humility moving but also frustrating . It was hard for me , a third-generation Japanese American , to understand why my aunt and her peers showed no bitterness at lost proms , lost football games , lost freedom . Four decades after my aunt ' s internment , my high_school graduation ended with an all-night party at Disneyland . I count my days at Torrance High_School among the best in my life . Those are the years that shaped my identity . The loss of those years would mean a loss of self . How could you ever make_up for that ? I measured disappointment by a different yardstick than my aunt did_in her high_school years . I thought hardship was being stuck_with 20 leftover apple_pies from a Sadie Hawkins dance I had planned as junior_class president . So why is it that I am bitter for my aunt and her peers , even if they are not ? Mine is the self-righteous viewpoint of someone who has the luxury to lament a moral outrage , thanks to those who walked before me . I am a product of their lives , the tail on their comet . They endured the indignities of the war and then moved_on , their heads held high , so that my generation could have a better life . My aunt ' s generation is also private ; she never talked_about the war camps to her son or daughter . My father , a physician , never talked_about it , and I regret not asking . It is a burden I ' ll bear the rest of my life ; he died in 1989 . At the diploma ceremony , I pressed my aunt gently to express her feelings but then stopped . I wasn ' t there to be Barbara Walters . This was her night . * My aunt ' s generation was closely tied to the humble values of its immigrant parents . When they got their marching orders in May , 1942 , they simply went . My aunt packed up , along with her mother and two brothers -- one of them my father , a fifth-grader at the time . My grandfather , a seed salesman , was shipped off to a separate camp in New Mexico for suspected spies . He wasn ' t a spy . Shikata ga nai . It can ' t be helped . On the first night of her imprisonment , my aunt , a high_school sophomore , stuffed a canvas sack full of straw for her mattress . Watch_out for scorpions , someone told her . Yet , later my aunt and her peers remained loyal to a government that had robbed them of their high_school years , and they worked to rebuild their country and their lives . Giri , ninjo . Duty and obligation , from the heart . After the war ' s end in 1945 , more_than 120 # 000 people of Japanese descent were freed . Scores of them had lost their homes , their businesses , their pride . Some of these American citizens came_home to boarded-up businesses covered with graffiti : Go_home , Japs . Shimbo , gaman . Patience , endurance . I am the lucky one for their forbearance . I was born into a world that is slowly awakening to the riches of multiculturalism and diversity ; their world was marred by segregation and intolerance . Yet , my aunt ' s generation , the Nisei , retained dignity in the face of injustice through a collective faith in traditional values -- ones , I ' m afraid , that will all but disappear with their passing . I -- and probably most third-generation Americans -- am more shaped by the values of this country than the ones of my ancestors . My generation prizes openness and assertiveness , values that allow me to begrudge a historic wrong with unrestrained anger . It wasn ' t until I lived_in Japan on a one-year fellowship that I began to understand the traditions of my heritage , even though my mother was born and raised in Japan . Day after day , I saw duty and obligation played_out , even in the interplay of virtual strangers . One day when my American friend , Tyler , bounced a check , a Japanese bank teller who realized the error covered_for him -- with funds from her personal account . Still , my aunt ' s 50th reunion was an eye-opener . &quot; Now , which barrack were you in ? &quot; the graduates asked each other blithely . That was all they said about the camps . That night , as a 20-piece orchestra played Glenn Miller hits , my aunt hunted_down classmates she hadn ' t seen since the war . She hadn ' t gone_to any other Roosevelt reunions because she felt she didn ' t belong without a diploma from there . Don ' t get me wrong . I thought it was lovely and touching that the class of 1944 had remembered my aunt and her peers . The diploma ceremony moved many observers to tears , including M . Bud Weber , executive chairman of the reunion committee that had come_up with the idea to remember the Japanese Americans . &quot; A lot of people had been thinking_about this for 50 years , &quot; said Weber , a Mission Viejo resident . &quot; It was a strange and tragic thing to watch them go . We tried as best we could to make_up for some of it . They are Roosevelt Rough_Riders like us , and we wanted to let them know they belong_to our family for the rest of their lives. &quot; After the diploma ceremony , 68-year-old Bruce Kaji of Gardena gave a short speech on behalf of his peers , imploring the audience to remember the contributions of Japanese Americans during the war against Japan . &quot; You didn ' t forget us , &quot; Kaji told his classmates , &quot; and that is what is deeply and sincerely appreciated. &quot; My aunt and the others said they finally felt complete , with diplomas in_hand . &quot; It was_well worth the wait . It was_well worth the pain . It just made me feel young again , &quot; said 69-year-old Archie Miyatake , of Montebello . &quot; It was thrilling , &quot; my aunt said . &quot; I could talk_about it for years and years. &quot; And I will think_about it for years and years . My aunt and her peers made their peace ; I ' m not sure I ever will . Now , in my head , I can understand how they feel but not truly in my heart . At the same time , I have a new respect for the way they carried_on , with a class and grace that I wish I had . I have giri and ninjo of my own , a duty and obligation that I tend to forget . My struggle is to learn from the wisdom of the generation before and remember that we share a proud culture that is in danger of fading_away . That night , several of the Nisei whom I had just met said they recognized my name from reading The Times . One woman said she scanned the paper for bylines of the Sansei , with their Japanese surnames and American first_names . &quot; We are so proud_of all_of you , &quot; she told me . They are proud_of my generation ; I am proud_of theirs .</TEXT>
