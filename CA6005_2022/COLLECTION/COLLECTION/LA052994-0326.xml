   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; END TO TRADE DISPUTE UNLIKELY TO CEMENT U.S.-CHINA TIES ; DIPLOMACY : RELATIONS WILL BE STRAINED BY CONFLICTS -- OVER IDEALS , FOR EXAMPLE -- THAT TARIFFS ISSUE POSTPONED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton chose to back_away from a human_rights confrontation with China to avoid a damaging rift with one of the world ' s great economic and military powers . But what is likely to ensue now , many experts in and out of government acknowledge , is far from a period of tranquil relations . In fact , now that the dispute over China ' s most-favored-nation trading status is finally being resolved , a number of other conflicts are likely to boil to the surface . Many of these have been suppressed or delayed by the Clinton_Administration ' s preoccupation with the trade dispute . It may well turn_out , some say , that the trade issue was not really the problem between the United States and China but merely a symbol of broader underlying problems -- that is , conflicts over ideals , over economics and over the future geopolitical map of Asia . In other words , relations between the United States and China are shaky enough that all_the efforts expended on the trade dispute may produce only very fragile , short-term gains . &quot; Even if the President were to say , ' I ' m giving MFN to China for five years , ' it ' s Pollyannish to think everything else will be taken_care of , &quot; one U.S. official observed recently . &quot; We will stop focusing_on one debate and start focusing_on others , &quot; the official said . &quot; It ' s just going_to go_on . There are still a lot of other issues that need to be worked_out , and they ' re not even going_to be addressed until MFN gets_out of the headlines. &quot; Over the next few months , the Clinton_Administration is likely to challenge China by moving ahead with other trade sanctions that it has threatened as retaliation for China ' s pirating of U.S. tapes , compact_discs , movies and computer software . Over the next year or two , the United States and China are also expected to clash over China ' s continuing nuclear tests , which are likely to resume soon . In addition , the United States could well find itself complaining again about China ' s arms exports . And China will haggle with the United States over the future of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the terms for its membership in the new_World Trade Organization , the successor to the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . That list of disputes does not even include other , possibly more contentious controversies , such_as those over North_Korea ' s nuclear program and the future of Cambodia , still torn by civil_war despite a 1991 peace_treaty . Once the trade and human_rights linkage is behind them , however , Clinton_Administration officials are likely to try hard to upgrade ties with Beijing . &quot; My guess is that after MFN , they are going_to go_into a full-court press to improve relations with China , &quot; said former U.S. Ambassador to China James R . Lilley . &quot; They ' re going to move fast and hard . We ' ve got important interests in North_Korea and Cambodia , and we could use China ' s help. &quot; As part of that effort , Washington sources said , the Administration is expected to announce the appointment of a new envoy to China soon . The likely candidate is a veteran China specialist : Charles W . Freeman Jr. , now assistant defense_secretary , who served during the early 1980s as deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing . There are some precedents that may give U.S. officials hope that the Administration will succeed in upgrading ties with Beijing -- although they are not necessarily comparisons the Administration would advertise . Before Clinton , one other President had come_to the White_House promising a tougher U.S. policy toward China after a campaign in which he accused his predecessor of being too weak and too conciliatory to the Beijing regime . That President was Ronald Reagan , who complained in the 1980 campaign that the Jimmy_Carter Administration had gone too far in abandoning Taiwan when it established diplomatic ties with China . Reagan suggested that as President he would give greater support to Taiwan . And , just like Clinton , Reagan was greeted with about 18 months of the silent_treatment from China . Finally , in August , 1982 , he negotiated a deal with Beijing . That deal -- a communique in which the United States promised to limit arms sales to Taiwan -- opened the way to more_than six years of generally harmonious ties between Washington and Beijing . All other disputes suddenly became relatively easy to solve . But that was during the Cold_War , when the United States and China shared the same fundamental strategic objective of trying to counteract the military power of the Soviet_Union . The Clinton_Administration does not have the glue of the Cold_War to bring the United States and China back together again . And some U.S. China experts point to other , much more recent trends that suggest that separating the trade and human_rights issues may_not ease frictions between Washington and Beijing for long . Only a year ago , with much less fanfare than last week , Clinton &quot; de-linked &quot; the issues of arms proliferation and China ' s trade benefits . Before Clinton took_office , President George_Bush had repeatedly vetoed legislation that would have required China , before winning a renewal of its trade privileges , to make progress not only on human_rights but also on curbing its arms exports and reducing its trade imbalance with the United States . Clinton enshrined the linkage between most-favored trade benefits and human_rights in an executive order a year ago . But at_the_same_time , he dropped the conditions on arms exports and the trade imbalance , saying that these problems could be dealt with through other means . So what happened ? The Administration felt obliged to prove that , even without most-favored trade linkage , it could take tough action against the proliferation of weapons and missiles . Last August , as punishment for China ' s sale of missile technology to Pakistan , the United States imposed sanctions barring the sale of U.S.-made satellites to China . &quot; They ( Administration officials ) de-linked trade and arms control last year , but the result afterward was a downward trend in the relationship , &quot; one U.S. official said . &quot; And I ' m afraid that , to prove that they still care about human_rights , they ' ll do things now on human_rights that will ring off even more bells in Beijing than MFN linkage , such_as actions to upgrade ties with Taiwan and Tibet. &quot; Indeed , in the first 24 hours after Clinton announced that China ' s trade benefits would be renewed , top Administration officials began to suggest that the President might take other actions on human_rights that could produce new frictions between Washington and Beijing . &quot; I think that , in the future , we ' ll be keeping steady pressure on , through other instruments , in a way that may cause ( Chinese officials ) to make more progress in the future , &quot; Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said . &quot; We ' re certainly not giving_up on improvement in human_rights in China. &quot;</TEXT>
