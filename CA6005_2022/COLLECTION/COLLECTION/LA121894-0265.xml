   <HEADLINE> THE FRAMING OF JOE BURROWS ; THE STORY THAT SENT HIM TO DEATH ROW FOR MURDER CHANGED MANY TIMES FROM THE DAY IT WAS TOLD BY HIS ACCUSER , A WOMAN KNOWN FOR HER CONVINCING LIES . BUT THE JUSTIC SYSTEM HAD DECIDED HE WAS GUILTY , AND IT TOOK A LAWYER ' S BOND WITH A SOCIOPATH TO SET HIM FREE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Circuit Court Judge John Michela and Death Row convict Joe Burrows warily faced each other in a Kankakee County , Ill. , courtroom on Sept . 8 , it was by no means their first encounter . In the spring of 1989 , Michela had presided over Burrows ' two trials on first-degree murder_charges . The first trial had ended in a deadlocked jury ; the second had ended in Burrows ' conviction . The same two eyewitnesses -- a small-time cocaine dealer and a scared , dim 22-year-old -- had composed the sum of the state ' s case at both trials . The difference was , the jurors at the second trial believed them . It had mattered little to Michela what he thought_of this result . It had mattered little to Michela that he found the coke dealer , Gayle Potter , to be utterly unbelievable and wasn ' t sure if the 22-year-old , Ralph Frye Jr. , even knew what he was saying . What had mattered_to Michela -- all that mattered -- was what the jury thought . Michela believed powerfully in the notion that jurors alone were the finders of act . He would never overrule a verdict or tell a jury he disagreed . Juries were the great defense against abuses of power , including his own . If the jury chose to believe Ralph Frye and Gayle Potter , that was it for Michela . The jury had listened to Frye whine on the witness_stand , listened to him go_on and on and on . It was up_to the jury to fathom that , and they ' d fathomed that Joe Burrows was guilty . Not even Joe Burrows ' final desperate plea before sentencing -- &quot; I ' d like to ask the court a question . Just whose job is it to see that justice is done ? &quot; -- had swayed the judge . Michela sentenced Burrows by the book . He could discern no mitigating_circumstances , so by Illinois law , Burrows looked_to be a suitable candidate for the executioner . &quot; It is the judgment of this court , &quot; Michela had proclaimed on Aug . 1 , 1989 , &quot; that this defendant be hereby sentenced to death. &quot; Now , almost exactly five years later , Burrows was back before him , expressionless at the defense table , handcuffed at his wrists , shackled at his waist and ankles . Sitting behind him , family and friends were nervously inching forward in their seats . Standing at his side , defense_attorney Kathleen Zellner was talking . &quot; I cannot cite any precedent for Your Honor because there is none , &quot; she was saying . &quot; Maybe that should tell us something about the enormity of the tragedy played_out in this courtroom... . It is time for the truth to prevail in this courtroom. &quot; The words had to grate on Michela . I don ' t get_into truth , the judge liked to observe . It ' s what ' s provable that matters . You have to separate what you believe from the facts . Faith is for Sundays . &quot; It is time for these shackles to come_off , &quot; Zellner was saying . &quot; I am asking Your Honor to grant my motion because it is right and just . It is time , Your Honor , to send Mr. Burrows home. &quot; From Death Row to freedom in a morning -- the notion left the lawyers in Michela ' s courtroom full of wonder . But so did all that had emerged since the day Michela condemned Burrows . Over four days in late July , at a special hearing in Michela ' s courtroom , they ' d all listened , transfixed , to a cascade of revelations . With the hearing over , Michela no longer needed look_to a jury . Finally , it was his judgment that mattered . He did not hesitate . He nodded at a prison_guard , who began fumbling to remove Burrows ' manacles and leg irons . A moment later , the chains clanged to the courtroom floor , echoing to the high ceiling . Burrows ' wife , Sherri , rushed into his arms . Much has followed this extraordinary moment in an Illinois courtroom . The Burrows family has celebrated , the murder victim ' s family has wept , the news media , TV talk_shows and movie producers have scrambled . Judge Michela has been hailed , Kathleen Zellner cheered , the legal_system studied . Still , the story is not over . Despite her victory , Zellner plans to appeal Michela ' s ruling . She admires what she calls the judge ' s &quot; gutsy &quot; decision , but she laments what she regards_as Michela ' s reluctance , in his ruling , to acknowledge just how an innocent man came_to spend five years on Death Row . She wants responsibility fixed . She wants it understood that judges and prosecutors and defense_attorneys must look_to themselves , not the legal_system ' s thicket of rules and procedures , for justice . &quot; The judge , &quot; Zellner maintains , &quot; is not facing_up to what happened. &quot; William Dulin ' s body , clad in long johns , lay face_up on his living room floor for 36 hours before his daughter Patricia discovered it at 8 a.m. on Nov . 8 , 1988 . Called soon after to Dulin ' s farmhouse in a remote reach of central Illinois ' Iroquois County , about nine miles east of Watseka and 75 miles south of Chicago , state crime scene technician Tommy Martin found no signs of forced entry and no fingerprints . A walk through the house did yield some evidence , though . Two holes and two deflection marks suggested that four shots had been fired toward the ceiling and walls . Dulin ' s broken fingernails and drops of blood suggested a struggle . A . 22-caliber bullet in Dulin ' s neck suggested a murder . That was all authorities had until a bearded man with dark bushy hair , wearing a shirt embroidered with the name &quot; Chuck &quot; and &quot; K &amp; C Auto , &quot; walked into the Iroquois Farmers State_Bank early that afternoon . He wanted to cash a yellow counter check for $ 4 # 050 -- a check that had William Dulin ' s signature on it . Iroquois County was too small and self-contained for such a maneuver . The bank ' s 86-year-old chairman had known Dulin for 70 years , and considered him a good friend . So had others at the bank . Dulin , a small , frail man , born in the first year of the century , had worked in factories as a youth , then settled into farming . He ' d been known as &quot; the apple man &quot; because of the fruit and cider he sold from his small orchard . Bank teller Vesta Metz realized at a glance that the signature on the check wasn ' t Dulin ' s . She also knew what had happened to Dulin ; after all , there ' d been just five murders in 13 years in Iroquois County . &quot; I ' m sorry , sir , we can ' t cash this check , &quot; she said . &quot; This gentleman was found dead this morning. &quot; Bank officials were dialing the Iroquois County Sheriff ' s office even as their visitor rushed to his car . Twenty minutes later , five miles west on County Road 1200 , Sgt . Randy Eimen and Investigator Robert George stopped a black Oldsmobile Cutlass that fit the description provided by the bank . Inside were the bank customer , Chuck Gullion , and a short , heavyset 32-year-old woman with a round face , close-cropped blond hair and the prim manner of a schoolmarm . Gayle Potter had a bloody cut on the back of her neck and bruises behind her left ear , but no check . Halfway down the road , she ' d torn it in four pieces , set the pieces on_fire and tossed the ashes out the window . &quot; Well , hello , Gayle , &quot; Investigator George said , standing on the car ' s passenger side . The two knew each other fairly well . Two years before , George had been obliged to bring Potter back to Illinois from Texas to face auto-theft and forgery charges ; on the plane ride home , they ' d talked all_the way . In fact , past brushes with the law made Potter ' s a familiar face to all those at the Iroquois County Jail -- Eimen , George , Sheriff Joseph Mathy , State ' s Attorney Tony Brasel -- who gathered that day to question her . At first , Potter denied any connection to Dulin ' s murder , insisting that the old_man had given the check to her companion for home repairs he ' d done . Then , crying , she said she might have &quot; set Dulin up &quot; by leading others to believe he had lots of money . Finally , she allowed that yes , they might find her fingerprints at Dulin ' s house , but she didn ' t shoot Dulin . She ' d stolen the check from him three months before , while helping him clean his garage . There is some dispute about what next transpired . Sheriff Mathy says he simply told Potter that she was lying , and &quot; the only way you can help yourself in this deal is to tell us what happened. &quot; Gayle Potter recalls being told they were going_to &quot; fry me like a piece of chicken &quot; if she didn ' t talk . Potter also recalls being told that &quot; I had better come_up with somebody who did that murder or it was all going_to fall on me. &quot; Whatever was said , by evening Potter indeed had come_up with somebody : Joe Burrows , helped by his young sidekick Ralph Frye . She knew Dulin , Potter told the investigators that evening , because her mother had taken_care of Dulin ' s late wife . Dulin sometimes lent money to Potter . On Nov . 6 , the night of the murder , she needed money : She was a drug dealer and owed her supplier $ 3 # 000 for cocaine . At a 9 p.m. meeting at a Mobil station in Urbana , the supplier threatened her . So did the supplier ' s &quot; collector &quot; -- Joe Burrows . Both had yanked her around and pistol-whipped her . Burrows , knowing of her friendship with &quot; the rich old farmer , &quot; suggested she borrow the money from him . Then Burrows and Frye forced her into a Chevy pickup_truck -- a blue pickup with rusted doors and primer spray and a missing front grill -- and drove 65 miles north to Dulin ' s home . Once there , the two men pushed their way into the house with her . When Dulin refused her request for a $ 3 # 000 loan , Burrows pulled a gun -- a . 22 revolver with a wooden handle and a five-inch barrel -- and ordered Dulin to write a check . Burrows and Dulin began struggling . She tried to stop Burrows , but Frye knocked her to the ground . She heard shots fired . She turned_to see Dulin drop to the floor . After that , Potter said , the men shoved her into the truck . Burrows handed Frye the revolver , went_back in to wipe_off fingerprints and came_back out five minutes later with Dulin ' s pants , BB_gun and personal papers . Burrows and Frye drove her back to Urbana . Before leaving her at her trailer , they beat her and warned that she still needed to come_up with the money . That was why she ' d sent Chuck Gullion to cash the check . Gullion , she explained , was the one who ' d run_up her $ 3 # 000 cocaine debt . It ' s unclear why Iroquois County authorities , after listening to this fertile and ever-shifting story , so readily embraced it on the first day of their murder investigation . To be fair , Potter did not mention that the . 22-caliber revolver used to kill Dulin belonged_to her . Or that she had called Dulin at 3:51 p.m. that day and arranged to visit him , hours before Burrows was said to have forced her into his pickup . Or that she disliked Joe Burrows because his brother , who lived five doors down in her trailer_park , had blamed him for a recent burglary at her trailer . Or that since age 15 , psychologists had been saying her &quot; sugary sweet &quot; manner concealed &quot; an extremely effective manipulator &quot; full of &quot; untrue , bizarre stories. &quot; Of course , authorities would not have needed Potter ' s help in these matters if they had tried independently to verify her story . They did not , however , even though they knew she had a rap sheet and a cocaine habit . Instead , they swung into action . By midnight , Sgt . Eimen and Investigator George were_on the road south to Burrows ' home_in Villa Grove . By 12:45 a.m. they and the state police had surrounded the home with shotguns , and were pounding on the door . By 1 a.m. , Burrows was spread-eagled on his living room floor , insisting that he didn ' t know a Bill Dulin . &quot; Are you out of your f------ minds ? &quot; he inquired . &quot; Where the hell is Iroquois County ? &quot; Unlike Gayle Potter , Burrows , then 35 , looked_like a criminal . Tall and burly at six feet and 200 pounds , he had tattoos and crooked teeth and an uneducated manner of speech . He ' d bounced among foster_homes as a boy , skipped school often and worked sporadically as a self-employed house_painter . A former Villa Grove police_chief recalled the young Burrows as &quot; ornery &quot; and occasionally &quot; a troublemaker. &quot; He ' d spent 10 of the previous 15 years in prison for three felony burglaries , one felony possession of burglary tools and one misdemeanor theft . But none of his crimes had ever involved violence . Nor did anything investigators find at Burrows ' home early Nov . 9 suggest he ' d turned_to violence . Burrows had not a scratch on him , nothing that would suggest he ' d been in a struggle hours before . He had two vehicles in his driveway , but neither was a blue pickup . Nonetheless , the investigators felt they had their man . The interrogation back at the local county jail took just seven minutes , by Burrows ' count . By 4 a.m. , Eimen and local deputies were banging on the door of Burrows ' friend , Ralph Frye , at Ehler ' s Trailer_Park in Urbana . Minutes later , the sergeant was handcuffing Frye and reading him his rights . By 5 a.m , Frye was in the booking room of the local county jail , listening to Robert George say he ' d killed an old_man named Dulin up in Sheldon . This is all wrong , Frye tried to say . Where the hell is Sheldon ? Where the hell is Watseka ? It is not hard to see how Frye might have had some trouble with his geography that morning . For one thing , he was groggy , both from being awakened and from the sleeping pills and painkillers doctors had given him two days earlier for severe stomach cramps . For another thing , even when wide awake , Frye was not particularly bright . Frye was sallow-skinned and slight , 5-foot-8 and 150 pounds , with shoulder-length dark brown hair , thick glasses and a sparse mustache . Found to have a learning disability , he ' d spent most of his public schooling in special-education classes and was eventually assessed as having a &quot; borderline &quot; IQ of 76 . A school psychologist thought Frye a &quot; rather pleasant boy &quot; who &quot; wants to do_well &quot; but &quot; does not have sufficient ability to achieve successfully at the high_school level. &quot; He dropped_out in the 11th grade , found occasional jobs at fast-food restaurants and smoked marijuana at every opportunity . At the time of his arrest for Dulin ' s murder , he was_on probation in Champaign County , having pleaded guilty to a $ 48 burglary . &quot; You know where Watseka is , &quot; George told Frye that morning of Nov . 9 . &quot; I did nothing wrong , &quot; Frye insisted . &quot; We know you were there , &quot; George replied . Soon after , Sgt . Eimen left the room , leaving George alone with Frye . There is much dispute now over precisely what happened during the 30 or so minutes that George and Frye were together . Frye says George &quot; got_up in my face &quot; and &quot; threatened to lock me up for a very long time. &quot; Frye says George -- -who is about 5-foot-7 and 300 pounds -- told him what to say , detail for detail , then turned_on a tape_recorder . George signaled with head shakes &quot; whenever I messed_up , &quot; Frye says , and stopped the tape several times so he could adjust his story . George says none of this happened -- he didn ' t threaten , didn ' t get_in Frye ' s face , didn ' t point a finger , didn ' t feed Frye his story . He didn ' t &quot; recall &quot; stopping the tape -- &quot; it would have been possible that I did &quot; -- but at any rate he never signaled Frye with head shakes . Frye simply confessed , on_his_own . Whichever is the more accurate account , it is undeniable that at two minutes before 6 a.m. , the corpulent investigator emerged from the interrogation room with Ralph Frye ' s taped statement in_hand . Although Frye had an alibi -- his girlfriend ' s mother and brother both would later testify they saw him the on the night of Dulin ' s murder -- in his statement he readily placed himself at the scene of the crime . Yes , Frye says near the start of this tape . Yes , he drove_up to Iroquois County on Sunday , Nov . 6 . He rode to Dulin ' s house in a blue pickup_truck , &quot; somewhat banged_up , &quot; with Joe Burrows and Gayle Potter . Was it night or daytime when you went there ? George asks . &quot; Daytime , nighttime , &quot; Frye responds . &quot; Nighttime , &quot; George affirms . The story Frye then tells eventually would become the core -- if not the total -- of the prosecution ' s case . Despite all_the discord connected with this march to Death Row , virtually everyone involved -- the lawyers , the sheriff , the trial_judge , the state Supreme Court -- now agree that Ralph Frye ' s taped statement convicted Joe Burrows . Once they were in Dulin ' s house , Frye says on this tape , Potter started yelling when the old_man would n ' t loan her money . Then Burrows started punching the old_man . Frye protested , but Burrows shoved him aside . They were in a hallway . Burrows pulled_out a revolver -- it looked_like a . 38 -- and began beating Dulin with it . When the old_man grabbed for Burrows ' arm , two shots were fired into the air . Burrows and the old_man struggled , both of their hands on the gun . The gun fired . The old_man fell to his knees . Burrows hit him , knocked him out , took his pants , wallet , checks and gold money clip . Driving away in the blue pickup , Burrows rifled through the old_man ' s pants , then threw them out the window . Frye was sure about that -- Burrows threw the pants out the window about three miles outside of town . Back home_in Champaign County , Burrows drove_out a dead-end road on the far side of Willard Airport and dumped the pickup into a ditch . At this point near the end of his taped statement , Frye ' s account suggests a total of three shots . There were , however , five shots evident at Dulin ' s house . Whether George knew this as he questioned Frye , whether crime technician Tommy Martin had mentioned it while at Dulin ' s house , remains an issue . On the tape , though , it seems clear that the number of shots concerns George . When Frye finishes his narrative , George poses a critical question . &quot; Now , thinking_about it , Ralph , &quot; George asks , &quot; how many shots were fired in the residence ? &quot; Ralph replies : &quot; Two to the ceiling , altogether there must have been five shots. &quot; George : &quot; Five shots , fired. &quot; Ralph : &quot; Yeah , because two of them went_in the ceiling and one of them went_into the old_man . No , three of them went_into the ceiling , yeah ... There were four shots before the old_man , it ricocheted off the wall. &quot; &quot; Is there anything else , Ralph ? &quot; George asks as Frye finishes his account . &quot; No , &quot; Frye responds , &quot; except for that I hope that this is taken_care of right away . I don ' t know what the hell is going_on . I know what is going_on , but this is very unusual for me. &quot; There were , of course , some discrepancies between Gayle Potter ' s and Ralph Frye ' s stories . Potter mentioned no physical beating ; Frye had Burrows beating Dulin in the face with his fists and the gun . Potter said it was a . 22 revolver , Frye a . 38 . Potter said she tried to intervene , Frye said he did . Fundamentally , though , Potter and Frye had told the same story . Frye had provided the critical corroboration to Potter ' s tale . He ' d also provided details Potter hadn ' t mentioned and the police insisted that they hadn ' t known -- the money clip , the pants , the holes in the ceiling , the number of shots . How could Frye , awakened from a drugged sleep , match Potter ' s story so closely , without ever talking to her ? How could Frye know what even the police didn ' t know ? Above all , why would Frye say he was at the murder scene if he was not ? Frye ' s statement , the Illinois Supreme Court would observe three years later , &quot; was particularly telling ... He can hardly be considered someone who was not present at the time the crime occurred ... Frye ' s testimony was very probative of defendant ' s guilt. &quot; By 6 p.m. on Nov . 9 , Frye , Potter and Burrows had all been booked into the Iroquois County Jail on charges of first-degree murder and armed robbery . There , five days later , using the phone available to all prisoners in her upper-center cellblock , Potter called her boyfriend , Rick Gillespie , with whom she shared a trailer . &quot; The gun ' s in the trailer , behind the chair at the front_door , &quot; Potter whispered . &quot; You need to get_rid_of it . You need to get_rid_of that gun. &quot; It took just eight days for Gayle Potter ' s and Ralph Frye ' s stories to start unraveling . On Nov . 17 , Investigator George interviewed and took taped statements from Chuck Gullion , Potter ' s partner in the check-cashing caper , and Rick Gillespie , Potter ' s boyfriend . Both flatly contradicted Potter and Frye . Potter didn ' t drive_up to Watseka with Burrows and Frye in a blue pickup , they informed George . Potter , at her request , drove_up with them in Gullion ' s black Oldsmobile Cutlass . Once in Watseka , Gullion said , they went_to the apartment of Potter ' s cousin . Gullion and Gillespie watched TV there while Potter borrowed the black Olds and left &quot; to take_care of some business. &quot; Shortly after midnight , Potter returned , dazed and covered with blood from a head wound . Seeing her , Gillespie passed_out . A drug deal had gone sour , Potter explained . In her pocket was more_than $ 250 in cash . In the Oldsmobile , on the floor behind the driver ' s seat , underneath a pair of tan dress pants , were Potter ' s . 22 revolver and a black plastic BB_gun . While Potter cleaned_up , Gullion unloaded five fired rounds and four live rounds from the . 22 revolver . Later , they and Gillespie smoked a bowl of marijuana , then drove_back to the Town and Country Trailer_Park in Urbana . There Potter gathered_up the two guns and the pants , and with Gillespie walked into their trailer . Statements by Potter ' s cousin and Gillespie precisely matched Gullion ' s . None of them saw Joe Burrows or Ralph Frye that night . None of them heard Potter mention Burrows ' or Frye ' s name . None of them knew anything about a blue pickup_truck . Gillespie , though , did know about the murder weapon . After giving his statement , he led George to the garbage-filled vacant_lot where he ' d hidden Potter ' s . 22-caliber pistol . Years later , Judge Michela would say that Potter ' s &quot; inconsistent statements on the date of arrest should have raised great doubts as_to the truthfulness of what she said . To accept her final statement of Nov . 8 as true , once the story of the blue pickup proved false , is questionable. &quot; Yet that is just what prosecutor Tony Brasel did . In fact , Potter and Frye ' s now-suspect statements composed the heart of the case he presented to a grand_jury in late November of 1988 . He chose not to introduce Gullion ' s and Gillespie ' s contradictory accounts . In Brasel ' s version of events , Gayle Potter still was driving_up to Watseka with Burrows and Frye in a blue pickup . Brasel had long been a controversial figure . Elected Iroquois County state ' s attorney in 1980 , just two years after passing the bar , he raised eyebrows from the start . In his first year , he failed to disqualify himself in two cases involving former clients . In his second , he failed to disqualify himself when his brother appeared in court on a speeding charge . Eventually , the complaints about Brasel grew more serious , mostly involving accusations of excessive zeal and dirty tricks and duplicitous double-dealing with other lawyers . By the time of Dulin ' s murder , Brasel apparently had worn_out his welcome in Iroquois County -- on the day Gayle Potter was arrested , Brasel had lost his bid for reelection . He remained on the Dulin case as an appointed &quot; special prosecutor , &quot; however , because the man who unseated him was then the county ' s public_defender , and had represented Potter previously . Just why Brasel found Potter so believable from the start , and so quickly eliminated her as the murderer , remains a subject of much speculation . Perhaps it was Gayle Potter ' s uncommon wile that drove him -- other lawyers , witnessing her courtroom performance , have marveled at &quot; the way Potter was able to lie , &quot; at how her initial statement and later quite different testimony were spoken with &quot; the same sincerity &quot; and &quot; no difference in inflection. &quot; If not that , perhaps it was excessive prosecutorial zeal , or an abiding belief that Burrows was the killer -- &quot; If I felt Burrows was not_guilty , I would have never tried the case , &quot; the prosecutor declared last January , in one of the few comments he has offered to journalists . Whatever the impetus , Brasel , in early 1989 , began trying to weave a single consistent story from the various conflicting statements he ' d collected . That effort surely wasn ' t harmed when Sheriff Mathy , near the end of January , transferred Ralph Frye to a cell next to Gayle Potter ' s . Mathy -- who , it should be noted , was Brasel ' s campaign manager -- now regrets this arrangement , although he calls critics of it &quot; armchair quarterbacks. &quot; He also maintains that his jail is so small , with just 30 cells on two floors , that wherever he put Frye , he could have &quot; yelled back and forth &quot; with either Burrows or Potter . Yelling wasn ' t necessary where Frye ended_up , though . Between his cell and Potter ' s was a food slot , through which the two prisoners could , and did , talk for hours every day . Potter and Frye describe their conversations in similar terms . &quot; I scared the living daylights out of Ralph , &quot; Potter says . &quot; You need to see him . He ' s borderline retarded , real slow . It was not hard to coerce him . I told him , ' They ' re going to put us on Death Row unless you go_along with my story , unless you do_it Tony ' s way. ' I worked_on the details with him over and over. &quot; Potter grins at the memory . &quot; I convinced him they would n ' t believe he wasn ' t there. &quot; Frye agrees : &quot; ' We gotta make_it sound better , then they ' ll help us , ' she says to me . She talked_about what to say , what happened , how we got there , how we left . We rehearsed . They wanted to make_sure it was all consistent . I tried to say this was wrong , that I was never there , but what could I do ? What could I do ? &quot; Frye went_to trial first , in late February in the Iroquois County_courthouse , with Judge Michela imported from Kankakee County to preside because the local judge had a conflict_of_interest . Frye had no occasion then to demonstrate what he ' d learned in jail , for his court-appointed defense counsel , Michael Jones , didn ' t call him to the stand . Jones didn ' t call Frye ' s alibi witnesses , either , or move to suppress Frye ' s taped statement , even though he was aware of Gullion ' s and Gillespie ' s contradictory accounts . The jury , after listening to Gayle Potter ' s testimony and Frye ' s statement , readily convicted him of armed robbery and murder . He was not then sentenced and sent to a state_prison , however . Because of an Illinois rule requiring equal sentences for the same crimes , Michela wanted to wait until the others were tried . So Frye remained in the Iroquois County jail_cell adjacent to Potter ' s . Brasel now also joined in the communications between Potter and Frye , in a series of jailhouse meetings allowed , but not attended , by the two prisoners ' attorneys . Jail logs and Brasel ' s billing statements show he had 25 meetings with Frye and 12 with Potter . Brasel describes these as part of the normal preparation for trial ; Potter and Frye remember them differently . &quot; Brasel was threatening life or 85 years if I didn ' t cooperate , &quot; Potter says . &quot; Brasel was promising immunity if I did . As different pieces of evidence were discovered and explained to me , I would change the story to fit them... Tony Brasel would supply me with the fact and then I had to supply the supporting story for it. &quot; Frye ' s account is similar : &quot; Brasel was talking_about a 35-to-65-year sentence , and saying I could help myself . He told me the taped statement wasn ' t very good the way it was stated , so he thought that it would be better if we would prepare the wording a little better...I ' d say this is wrong , but Brasel would say , ' Well , if you don ' t help me , I can ' t help you. ' &quot; Brasel says none of this happened . He denies making threats , offering immunity or feeding evidence . He also denies ever meeting with Potter or Frye without Sheriff Mathy in the room , even though the jail logs don ' t always indicate Mathy ' s presence . All he ever asked of his two star witnesses , Brasel says , is &quot; the truth. &quot; Potter ' s charges , he flatly declares , &quot; are a lie. &quot; Whoever is right , by the time Joe Burrows went_to trial for the first time in mid-March 1989 , with Judge Michela once again presiding in Iroquois County , Potter ' s and Frye ' s initial stories had evolved considerably , and to great effect . On the day of Dulin ' s murder , Potter now testified , she met her drug supplier at the Mobil station around 4 in the afternoon , not 9 at night . There , Burrows and Frye did not push her into a blue pickup and drive her to Watseka , but rather , told her to meet them in a parking_lot in Watseka between 10 and 11 p.m. Potter drove to Watseka with Gullion and Gillespie , dropped them at her cousin ' s apartment , then met Burrows and Frye at the parking_lot . The two men followed her to Dulin ' s house , they in a blue pickup , she in the black Olds . When the old_man let Potter into his house , Burrows and Frye pushed their way through the front_door . When Dulin refused her request for a loan , Burrows pulled a gun and ordered him to write a check . To Potter ' s surprise , the gun Burrows pulled was her own . 22-caliber pistol ; he must have taken it from her trailer . Dulin reached for his BB_gun ; he and Burrows struggled . Potter tried to intervene but Frye forcibly stopped her . Burrows shot Dulin in the head . Potter became hysterical and wanted to call the police . Burrows held her head over Dulin ' s desk and pistol-whipped her , causing her to bleed on the desk . Burrows placed the murder weapon , Dulin ' s gun , some papers and clothing into a paper sack , put the sack in the black Olds , then left with Frye in the blue pickup . Potter returned to her cousin ' s apartment in the Olds , then Gullion drove her and Gillespie back to their trailer in Urbana , carrying the paper sack in as he dropped them off . Potter did not know what was in the sack . It is impossible not to notice that Potter ' s story now was almost entirely consistent with Gullion ' s , Gillespie ' s and her cousin ' s statements . So , it turned_out , was Ralph Frye ' s . When he took the witness_stand , his story had changed , too -- in exactly the same manner as Potter ' s had . In truth , their testimony now dovetailed with all_the evidence in the case . There was in fact no hallway in Dulin ' s house , so now Frye said he ' d made a &quot; mistake &quot; about seeing a hallway . The murder weapon was a . 22-caliber , so no longer did Frye think it was a . 38 . There was no evidence of head wounds on the old_man , so now Burrows had never hit him with his gun or fists . Potter ' s blood had been found on the desk , so now Burrows had beat her head against that desk . No pants had been found in a three-mile radius of Dulin ' s home , so now no pants had been thrown_out a car_window . The blue pickup had never been found at Willard Airport , so now it had not been dumped there . Potter ' s and Frye ' s testimony did more_than just match the evidence , though . Their testimony now , critically , resolved the troublesome fact that Potter ' s gun was the murder weapon , and was found at her trailer . Their story explained how Potter ' s gun came_into Burrows ' possession -- it had been stolen from her trailer -- then explained how the gun moved_back to Potter ' s trailer after the murder -- Burrows dropped a bag containing it into Gullion ' s Olds . The jurors apparently didn ' t buy all this . Perhaps they wondered why Burrows was unscathed after his struggle with Dulin . Perhaps they wondered why Burrows would hand_over to Potter the very gun he ' d just used to kill Dulin -- and to pistol-whip her . Perhaps they wondered how Burrows could be the killer when it was Potter ' s gun , Potter ' s blood and Potter ' s effort to cash Dulin ' s check . Whatever the reason , after 11 hours of deliberation , the jury at Burrows ' first murder trial hung , unable to reach a verdict . During the interim between Burrows ' first and second trials -- mid-March to late May of 1989 -- Frye remained in his cell next to Potter , and continued to talk to her and Brasel . But now others began talking to Frye as well . Everyone understood that Gayle Potter was an inconsistent if not unbelievable witness ; everyone understood that Frye ' s confirmation of Potter ' s story was critical . Everyone also understood that Frye was a weak link , ready to bend either way . With so_much at stake , the gloves came_off . What unfolded in the Iroquois County Jail during the spring of 1989 was nothing less than an unvarnished battle for control of Ralph Frye ' s soul . In early April , Frye ' s sister Kim reached him by phone from her home_in Buffalo . She had received a letter from Joe Burrows ' wife , Sherri , who believed that Frye was getting &quot; a raw deal. &quot; At Sherri ' s urging , Kim told Frye to call Burrows ' lawyer Ron Boyer , and write a letter to Judge Michela . Following his sister ' s advice , Frye called the lawyer . There is dispute now over just what was said . Frye sometimes &quot; can ' t remember , &quot; and sometimes claims Boyer promised to &quot; help him get_out of jail &quot; if he wrote a letter . Boyer insists he told Frye only that he ' d do &quot; whatever he could to get the truth out , &quot; and that &quot; the truth would exonerate him. &quot; Brasel suggests other prisoners , one represented by Boyer , egged Frye on . Whatever the impetus , on April 17 , Frye wrote to Michela , declaring that he ' d never been to the murder scene . &quot; Dear Sir , my name is Ralph E . Frye Jr. , &quot; he began . &quot; I would like to be as honest as I can be . The morning I was arrested... I tried to explain I had no idea of what was going_on , which is true . The two investigators from Watseka were harassing me and telling me some things about what happened up there and what was taken from Mr. Dulin ' s house . I gave them a statement to get them off my back... I had no other choice but to cooperate... My lawyer believed everything I said on the tape . So I would like to get a new attorney if possible... Miss Potter did talk to me and tell me a_few things on what did happen out there that night . The reason I got_on that witness_stand to testify is the simple fact that I was looking_at a very long prison term... My life was at stake. &quot; When Judge Michela received this letter , he promptly appointed a public_defender to represent Frye . Then the scramble started . Before this new lawyer could act , Frye ' s attorney Michael Jones visited him . Prosecutor Tony Brasel stopped by more_than once . Ron Boyer maintained phone contact . In this contest , only Frye ' s relatives weren ' t successful , their efforts to reach him no doubt impeded somewhat by two jail log entries , one instructing that &quot; Ralph Frye ' s sister will not be permitted in facility for visitation , &quot; the other saying , &quot; Advised by Sheriff Mathy if Frye ' s grandmother brings some candy and cookies , to get_in_touch with the Sheriff. &quot; Mathy later testified that he had &quot; no independent recollection &quot; of such orders and &quot; no idea &quot; why he would issue them . Some of what Frye heard in these critical days involved not legal advice but rumors that had long informed Iroquois County legal circles . Boyer told Frye that Brasel was a drug_user ; Brasel told Frye that Boyer was an alcoholic . But eventually , Frye ' s advisers managed to focus_on legal matters . As Frye later recalled it , Jones told him he ' d made &quot; a big mistake &quot; in writing the letter , that the judge would now give him a lot more time . The prosecutor , Frye recalled , asked , &quot; can ' t you see what Boyer ' s doing to you ? He ' s not helping you.... He ' s helping Mr. Joseph Burrows. &quot; And Boyer , he remembers , told him that it was his testimony that was convicting Burrows . Plainly , Frye was overwhelmed . Ten days after writing his letter to the judge , he retracted it in a sworn affidavit . Then , 11 days later , he reversed himself again , urgently summoning Boyer to a jailhouse meeting , where -- over Sheriff Mathy ' s objection and attempt to block Boyer ' s entry -- Frye gave a taped recantation , denying any involvement . Even as Boyer was taping it , Gayle Potter would later testify , she was_on the phone advising Brasel &quot; if you want to save your case , you ' d better get your ass over here. &quot; Within minutes of Boyer ' s departure , Brasel was at the jail , huddled with Frye and Mathy . Once again , accounts of a meeting vary . Frye says Brasel &quot; was getting upset . The man was prancing around the room , he slammed his hands on the desk , he told me that if Mr. Burrows walks free , that I could get nailed for the crime. &quot; Brasel says he calmly told Frye he &quot; wanted to know what the truth was. &quot; All agree that by the time Brasel left , after an hour-and-a-half conversation , Frye yet again had reversed himself . He had decided that his letter to the judge and his recantation statement to Boyer were &quot; mistakes. &quot; Frye was back to corroborating Potter . There matters stood when Joe Burrows ' second murder trial began in late May of 1989 . From the moment he first offered it , Joe Burrows ' account of where he ' d been the day of Bill Dulin ' s murder had been precise , detailed and unchanging . He ' d worked_on his ' 78 Chevy cargo van outside his home all day . A friend , Murray Kellems , an Urbana garbage-truck driver , had helped him . Around 7:30 p.m. , he and Kellems had driven Burrows ' ' 79 Pinto to Potomac , to visit Burrows ' brother Dennis . They ' d gotten there a little before 9 p.m. His brother ' s girlfriend , Lynn Pine , had answered the door , then shut it in Burrows ' face , for she didn ' t like him . Burrows had knocked again , and Dennis had let them in . They ' d talked and watched television with Dennis , Lynn and their visiting friend , Jana West , until just about midnight . Then Burrows and Kellems had left , arriving back home about 1:30 a.m. At Burrows ' first trial , defense_attorney Ron Boyer had called to the stand three of the key people involved in this narrative -- Dennis Burrows , Lynn Pine and Murray Kellems . ( He was never able to locate Jana West. ) All three corroborated Burrows ' story , but at times , Boyer would observe later , they sounded &quot; inarticulate and uneducated and angry. &quot; They did not , he believed , &quot; make a credible presentation on cross-examination by Mr. Brasel. &quot; Kellems , for example , grew agitated when Brasel brought_up his previous theft and burglary convictions , snarling , &quot; What the hell does my past have to do with this trial ? &quot; More damaging still had been Brasel ' s questions about just what they ' d watched on TV that night . When Dennis Burrows said &quot; Gunsmoke , &quot; Brasel quickly established that &quot; Gunsmoke &quot; wasn ' t broadcast on Sunday evenings . For these reasons , as well as a sense that with Frye ' s recantation on tape , he had an &quot; overwhelming &quot; case -- even though Frye now denied that tape -- Boyer decided against calling Burrows ' alibi witnesses at the second trial . But the trial -- held_in Michela ' s own Kankakee County_courthouse because the judge had tired_of commuting to Watseka -- did not unfold as favorably for his client as Boyer had expected . First , prosecutor Brasel refused to grant Rick Gillespie and Chuck Gullion immunity , so these two critical witnesses exercised their Fifth_Amendment privileges not to testify . Then Gayle Potter embellished her earlier statements by testifying that with Bill Dulin on his knees , &quot; crying and out_of_breath , &quot; Joe Burrows had &quot; smiled &quot; as he pulled the trigger . ( Potter , years later , would testify that she ' d added this detail because Brasel had told her &quot; I was going_to have to make the death of Mr. Dulin more graphic ... and more heinous. &quot; ) Probably most damaging , however , was Frye ' s agitated exchange with Ron Boyer as the jury listened . &quot; Didn ' t you tell me that you could also get me out of jail if I had stuck_to this taped statement ? &quot; Frye snapped_at Boyer as Burrows ' lawyer questioned him on the witness_stand about his now-denied recantation and renewed support of Potter ' s story . &quot; Ralph , there is no question to you right now , &quot; Boyer responded . &quot; Well , I ' m handing you one. &quot; &quot; To answer your question , I told you that I would try. &quot; &quot; No , you didn ' t tell me that , you said you would if I stuck_to the taped statement. &quot; Boyer couldn ' t effectively respond without resigning as Burrows ' attorney and testifying ; this he declined to do and Michela declined to require . It didn ' t matter that Frye never could offer a reason , other_than &quot; pure coincidence , &quot; why he and Potter had both made the same &quot; mistake &quot; of initially saying they ' d driven_up to Watseka with Burrows in a blue pickup . It didn ' t matter that the brother of Frye ' s girlfriend swore that Frye , at 10:20 on the night of Dulin ' s murder , opened the door for him at the Urbana trailer they all shared . It didn ' t matter that the now-distraught Boyer , flatly calling &quot; master con_artist &quot; Gayle Potter the true killer , implored the jury : &quot; Don ' t you see what they are trying to do to Joseph Burrows ? &quot; In the end , the jurors chose to believe the prosecutor ' s version of events . On June 6 , after deliberating three hours , they convicted Joe Burrows of first-degree murder . The key , jury foreman Tom Hendrickson would say later , was just what the lawyers had expected it would be -- Ralph Frye ' s corroboration on the witness_stand of Potter . &quot; I don ' t see why you ' d say you were at a murder scene when you weren ' t , &quot; Hendrickson explained . &quot; And how you would know evidence police didn ' t know about. &quot; The jurors had taken so little time and seemed so certain that Boyer decided it would be wiser not to let them determine Burrows ' fate . Waiving the right to a jury sentencing , he left it to Judge Michela to decide whether Joe Burrows should live or die . Michela at 56 is a garrulous man , respected in his county and not much inclined toward the isolation of a judge ' s chambers . After 22 years on the bench , he remains well-connected with his region ' s circuit of lawyers and law-enforcement officers -- enough so to call Sgt . Eimen &quot; Randy &quot; and Sheriff Mathy &quot; Joe. &quot; He also remains personally opposed to the death_penalty . It is hard to say precisely what the judge thought as he faced the momentous question handed to him by Ron Boyer . Michela ' s own comments over the years offer decidedly mixed indications . On the bench midway through Burrows ' second trial , frustrated over Frye ' s vacillations , he had muttered , &quot; I don ' t know if this young_man was ever in Iroquois County until he was brought there on the 9th of November... I ' m not sure if any of us know the truthfulness of any statement ever given_in this trial by anybody. &quot; At Burrows ' sentencing hearing , he spoke_of &quot; the unwillingness of this court to believe ( Gayle Potter ' s ) testimony &quot; and noted that the physical evidence &quot; seems to all have been found in the presence and in the possession of Gayle Potter. &quot; Yet at that same hearing , Michela also talked_about &quot; the overwhelming situation of a young_man ... being awakened in the early hours of the morning seemingly not having time ... to fabricate a story putting himself at the murder scene and testifying as_to what occurred.... &quot; And this past fall , speaking in his chambers after finally freeing Burrows , Michela declared that he ' d found Frye &quot; compelling and believable , &quot; and because of him , would have voted to convict Burrows if he ' d been_on the jury . In the end , Michela says , it just doesn ' t matter what he thought . &quot; Even if I ' d not shared the jury ' s view , &quot; he observes , &quot; I would have sentenced him anyway . My belief in the jury_system is that unshakable. &quot; The judge ' s outlook derives from more_than simple faith : He regards the jury_system as a necessity . You need an organized way to separate facts from belief , Michela thinks , and that requires a system with precisely defined roles for all involved . The police and prosecutors fight to convict , the defense_attorney fights_back for the accused , the judge referees , the jury decides . &quot; You are the sole judges of believability of witnesses , &quot; he always instructs juries . Did citizens instead want the &quot; inquisitorial &quot; system of some European_countries , where judges assembled the evidence , questioned the witnesses and delivered the verdict ? Did citizens really want to give this much power to individual government officials ? Joe Burrows , for one , appeared more_than willing to do so as he stood before Judge Michela at his sentencing hearing on Aug . 1 , 1989 . The function and moral responsibility of judges -- and everyone involved in the legal_system -- was much on his mind that day . &quot; First of all , I ' d like to ask the court a question , &quot; Burrows began . &quot; Just whose job is it to see that justice is done ? Is it mine , Mr. Boyer ' s , Mr. Brasel ' s , or whose ? I ' ve asked myself over and over again , isn ' t there any justice in this country ? So many people know that I ' m innocent , but yet here I am about to be sentenced.... Tell me in all honesty that you believe I ' m guilty.... I don ' t want to be sentenced to death , but I can ' t help wondering ( if it ' s ) preferable to living_in a world where such corruption and injustice goes unchecked... What can a man in my position say ? ...I ' m ready for you to pass sentence on me. &quot; Michela was ready as well . As he read it , Illinois statutes insisted that if first-degree murder_convictions met the criteria listed for Death Row cases , the penalty was death , unless the defense could establish mitigating_circumstances . Michela could discern none . This defendant , Michela declared , is hereby sentenced to death . Not until then , after the tolling of Burrow ' s fate , were Frye ' s and Potter ' s cases resolved , and their sojourn in adjoining cells finally ended . In early September , Michela sentenced Frye to 23 years and dispatched him to the Logan Correctional Center in Lincoln , Ill . Soon after , before another judge , Potter was tried and convicted of first-degree murder , forgery and armed robbery , and sentenced to 30 years in prison . With three convictions and a death_penalty -- his first ever -- to show for it , Tony Brasel ' s tenure as Iroquois County special prosecutor finally was over . It was with considerable reluctance that Naperville , Ill. , lawyer Kathleen Zellner took a phone_call one morning in late December of 1992 from Andrea Lyon , director of the Capital Resource Center . The center , a branch of the Illinois appellate defender ' s office , specializes in defending indigent Death Row clients . Zellner was just finishing_up a grueling case for the center involving a serial_killer . She wanted nothing more_than to return to her normal practice of business law . &quot; How would you like another ? &quot; Lyon inquired . &quot; No way , &quot; Zellner replied . &quot; I ' ve had it. &quot; &quot; But this one is innocent , &quot; Lyon said . Then 43 , Zellner was a newcomer to the Death Row defense bar , and a decidedly odd one . Raised in Oklahoma by parents who were scientists and liberal Democrats , she ' d married young , to a man who is now a CitiCorp executive , and had evolved into a self-described conservative Republican who supported the death_penalty . By 1990 , after several stops , she was practicing at a small business-law firm in Chicago ' s western suburbs . She was also growing restless . Zellner had once dreamed of being an FBI_agent and loved investigating . Constitutional law also fascinated her . The two interests merged in criminal work , so that ' s what Zellner eventually decided she wanted to do . After reading an article about the Capital Resource Center , she called and volunteered to handle a death_penalty case . It had given her homosexual serial_killer Larry Eyler , and before long she was weaving , in courtrooms and the news media , a Byzantine tale of child prostitutes , pedophiles , prosecutorial misconduct and defense_attorney conflict-of-interest . She was also fingering a new suspect -- a library_science professor who ' d befriended Eyler . By the time it ended with the professor ' s acquittal and Eyler ' s death from AIDS , Zellner had opened her own practice and more_than once had been placed under police protection because of multiple death threats . &quot; No way , &quot; Zellner said again to Lyon . &quot; No way. &quot; In the end , though , she couldn ' t resist . &quot; I ' m not expecting you to rely_on me saying I ' m innocent , &quot; Joe Burrows told her in their first phone conversation . &quot; Examine my case , examine the record . Make_up your own mind. &quot; Following Burrows ' suggestion , Zellner grew increasingly astonished . By then the record had grown even more dubious than it was_on the day Judge Michela condemned Burrows . In late July of 1991 , John Hanlon , a state public_defender then representing Burrows , had managed to locate Jana West , the visitor whom Burrows had always insisted watched TV with them at his brother ' s house on the night of Dulin ' s murder . In a sworn affidavit , West unequivocally had affirmed that Burrows was at his brother ' s house on the murder night until past midnight . What ' s more , West said she visited Gayle Potter the next day at her trailer , where Potter said &quot; she ' d killed a man the night before because he had pistol-whipped her. &quot; West didn ' t call the police then &quot; because I didn ' t believe her. &quot; West didn ' t come_forward when Burrows was charged with murder because she didn ' t &quot; care_for him.... That was his problem ... and I didn ' t want to be involved in it. &quot; Besides , &quot; I figured everything would be dropped because I know for a fact the man was not there at that time. &quot; Three months after Jana West ' s emergence , Ralph Frye had yet again recanted his entire story in another sworn , taped statement . This time , the lawyers had made_sure there ' d be no appearance of coercion or promises ; Burrows ' attorney had arranged the interview through Frye ' s new appellate attorney , who attended and approved the taping . &quot; What I ' m telling you people now is the God ' s honest truth , &quot; Frye had said . &quot; Nothing is going_to change my mind. &quot; Zellner couldn ' t believe that despite the whole preposterous record before her , the Illinois Supreme Court in March , 1992 , had upheld Burrows ' conviction , calling Frye ' s Nov . 9 statement &quot; particularly telling. &quot; Frye ? Frye ' s taped statement sounded pathetic to Zellner . It was_full of long pauses , full of leading questions . Frye didn ' t know right from left , Frye didn ' t know day from night , Frye could barely get_up every day and get his pants on straight . Didn ' t anyone see how ridiculous it was that in his initial statement he gave the same lies that Potter gave_in hers ? Didn ' t anyone see that the cops must have fed him information ? The cops kept saying Frye gave them things they didn ' t know -- the money clip , the pants , the wallet . But surely Dulin ' s daughters would ' ve told the cops about missing wallets and money clips when they talked that first day ; besides , none of those things had ever been found . The cops said Frye gave them the number of shots , but did he really ? In his statement , Frye is talking_about two shots , he ' s talking_about three shots , then suddenly it ' s five shots . Are we supposed to believe the cops didn ' t get the number of shots -- in fact , glean every possible detail -- from their own crime technician at the murder scene ? That Frye knew what the technician needed 48 hours to figure_out ? That Ralph ' s personal vocabulary included the word &quot; ricochet ? &quot; There was no point hanging an appeal on Frye , though -- Zellner knew that . He had flopped back and forth so_much he was worthless . So Zellner turned her attention where no defense_attorney for Burrows had looked before -- Zellner turned_to Gayle Potter . The two first met one morning in late March of 1993 , in an interview room at the Dwight Correctional Center in Dwight , Ill . Zellner found the short , stocky woman to be pleasant , articulate and full of smiles . With her glasses , round face and congenial manner , she suggested a librarian to Zellner . But Zellner couldn ' t help noticing that whenever Potter tried to describe an emotion -- sorrow about Dulin , for example -- she sounded cold . It was as if she was mimicking the sentiment , rather than feeling it . Potter would sometimes also veer from her otherwise rational conversation to make wild accusations , or to boast about her glamorous life as a big-time coke dealer . Conspiracies on the highest levels , cocaine parties with the state ' s top leaders , meetings with the Colombian cartel -- all were related with even-voiced calm . She was , Zellner believed , delusional -- a classic sociopath . Others before Zellner had reached similar conclusions . Potter ' s record of psychiatric care stretches back to the age of 8 ; by her early teens she ' d established a pattern of manipulative lying . A report from a junior_high_school psychologist in Camp Lejeune , N.C. , describes Potter ' s history of telling &quot; untrue , bizarre stories &quot; -- including one in which she accused her stepfather of rape , claimed she was pregnant and talked_of getting an abortion . Other reports from a clinical_psychologist at the Iroquois Mental Health Center , written in June of 1970 and 1971 , describe Potter as always &quot; giving the ' right ' answers , &quot; but &quot; not being able to fully conceal the hostility which appeared to lurk just below the surface. &quot; While Potter &quot; at first does not give the impression &quot; of having behavioral problems , &quot; one must constantly keep_in mind that she is an extremely effective manipulator &quot; who &quot; never presents enough evidence to actually get_in trouble , typical of a sociopathic orientation toward life. &quot; After choking a younger sister and shooting ( but only slightly wounding ) a younger stepbrother that June of 1971 , Potter at age 15 ended_up a ward of the court , which placed her in a special facility for troubled adolescents . By 16 she was attending a public high_school ; by 17 she ' d borne a daughter ; by 19 she was a cocaine_addict ; by 24 she ' d lost custody of her daughter ; by 30 she was a forger and auto thief . At the time of her arrest for Dulin ' s murder , she was under a restraining order that barred her from being within three miles of her daughter . &quot; I ' ll never change my story , &quot; Potter announced to Zellner that first morning . But Zellner could tell -- Potter was enjoying the attention . In her second visit , rather than grill her , Zellner tried to listen without judgment . Potter obviously felt grief over her estrangement from her daughter , so Zellner talked_about Burrows ' children . That drew a response . Zellner could tell Potter now was welcoming her visits . Potter began retreating from her testimony on the third visit . When Zellner started saying it was clear Joe Burrows and Ralph Frye hadn ' t been at Dulin ' s house , Potter nodded . Will you put that in writing ? Zellner asked . Yes , Potter answered , she would . Potter wasn ' t yet revealing what did happen . This was only a first_step , Zellner knew . Judges disdained recantations generally , and they ' d particularly abhor one from Gayle Potter . Gradually , Zellner began assembling what she truly needed . In December of 1993 , Zellner ' s associate , who was combing through boxes of files handed_over by the state ' s attorney ' s office , came_across a curious letter Potter had written soon after her arrest , addressed to a friend named Tom Williamson , who lived two miles from Bill Dulin ' s home . In it , Potter pleaded for Williamson to &quot; come_forward &quot; and say he ' d seen a &quot; light blue Chevy &quot; pickup_truck parked outside Dulin ' s home , because otherwise &quot; the police are going_to try to say I was the one who killed Mr. Dulin.... Tom , PLEASE , I ' m begging you. &quot; This was critical evidence , for it suggested Potter ' s early intent to deceive . But Tony Brasel had never shared it with the defense . This looked_to Zellner to be a clear violation of the discovery rules -- and reason alone for a new trial . The next month brought even more reason . In early January , a former girlfriend of Chuck Gullion , feeling troubled , had called the Champaign County police to say that Gullion , repeatedly over the years , had told her Burrows was innocent . This call , in turn , had led Iroquois County investigators to re-interview Gayle Potter ' s old boyfriend Steve Gillespie . In a taped interview on Jan . 14 , Gillespie had added a significant detail to his earlier statements . When a bloodied Gayle returned to her cousin ' s apartment on the night of Dulin ' s murder , he now revealed , she ' d said &quot; she had some trouble with Bill.... She said that he hit her and she killed him. &quot; He hadn ' t told this to the investigators before &quot; because I didn ' t want to get involved. &quot; Gullion and Gillespie , kept_from the witness_stand because Brasel had denied them immunity , finally were speaking out . Zellner now turned_to Potter with heightened zeal . Their meetings stretched on for months , more_than 20 in all between April of 1993 and 1994 . Most lasted more_than an hour . Potter talked often about Brasel ' s &quot; double_cross , &quot; and often about her troubled childhood . In turn , Zellner described Joe Burrows ' suffering , how he sat confined in a nine-by-six cell 22 hours a day , how he couldn ' t touch his family when they visited , how his children were tormented in school . The connection grew , week by week . Potter began to sense empathy , even sympathy , in Zellner . This was no ruse ; Zellner believed she understood Potter , understood her pain . It was happening again , Zellner realized . She was bonding with a sociopath , just as she ' d done with the serial_killer Larry Eyler . Sociopaths , and their mask of sanity , mesmerized Zellner . They appeared normal , but had no conscience , no moral core , no regard for the consequences of their actions . They were aberrations of nature , like the unusual rocks Zellner ' s geologist father used to show her . Studying Potter recalled for Zellner the thrill she felt as a kid when she looked_at snakes at the zoo . She could see the snakes , but they were separated from her ; they couldn ' t get her , couldn ' t bite her . What excited Zellner most was the challenge of beating these sociopaths . She wanted to get them . Time pressed_on her now , though . At the Menard Correctional Center , Joe Burrows was unraveling . His had been a troubled life well before the arrest for Dulin ' s murder . Over the years , he ' d rarely managed to stay out of one jail or another for very long . The gap between one release and the next arrest often was a matter of months , leaving scant time with his three children , who all were under 3 when he went_to prison in March , 1985 , on a burglary charge . Released in January , 1988 , he and his family had struggled -- there was a sojourn in a homeless facility in Urbana , times Burrows slapped his wife around , the day police picked_up Burrows after a screaming fight with Sherri and her brother . For a while that summer the family separated , Sherri and the kids going_to live with her mom . By the fall they ' d reunited , but then came the arrest for Dulin ' s murder . After the Illinois Supreme Court upheld Burrows ' murder_conviction , Sherri had stopped visiting him for four months , until she realized she just couldn ' t walk away . Now , in early 1994 , Burrows started giving_up . He ' d always thought this all was going_to be seen as a mistake , but when he was found guilty and sentenced to die , he ' d shut his brain down . In the journal he ' d started keeping , Burrows last January wrote : &quot; I have been dead for so_long now I doubt if I know how to live any longer.... Today I made the decision to put an end to all_the pain and suffering the only way I can . I will write the court and waive all my rights and petition the court to proceed with my execution as soon as possible . I just pray to God that I have the strength to see it through. &quot; We have to bring this to a close , Zellner realized when she learned of Burrows ' despair . We need a resolution . Visiting Potter one morning soon after , Zellner laid_out the whole intricate story as she saw it . There was something fishy in the Iroquois jail , she told Potter . Burrows and Frye were not there at the murder scene . There was no blue pickup , no money clip , no wallets , no pants . The cops fed Frye , Brasel coached Potter , Potter and Brasel coerced Frye . Listening , Potter admired Zellner . The lawyer had it right almost to every detail . All except who actually killed Dulin . That question Zellner went_after days later . On the morning of April 1 , she drove to Dwight intending to get a confession . &quot; I think a woman committed the murder , &quot; Zellner began , sitting before Potter in the conference_room they ' d shared regularly now for more_than a year . Zellner spoke slowly , carefully . &quot; This was a small , frail , 88-year-old-man , 5 ' 5 &quot; at most , &quot; she said . &quot; A big man like Joe Burrows would n ' t have had to struggle with him . There would n ' t have been any broken fingernails or ricocheting bullets . It would n ' t have happened. &quot; Zellner eyed Potter , who is five feet tall . &quot; The killer was about the same height and strength as Dulin , &quot; Zellner said . &quot; The killer was a woman. &quot; It was so obvious , Potter marveled . &quot; Well , &quot; Potter told Zellner , &quot; a woman did do it. &quot; &quot; Listen , Gayle , I ' m not passing judgment. &quot; &quot; Don ' t ever kid yourself that it matters at all what you think_of me. &quot; It did matter , though . Potter trusted Zellner . This lawyer had always been honest with her , had never tried to twist her around . She ' d always made_it clear she was representing Burrows and not helping her . Potter thought Zellner good at her job . In the Iroquois County Jail , she ' d always had a support_system to help keep this story going . Here , Zellner just was not going_for it . &quot; You ' re right , &quot; Potter said . &quot; A woman did do_it . I was there alone . I shot Bill Dulin. &quot; She would n ' t yet say she purposefully squeezed the trigger ; &quot; the gun went_off &quot; is how she put it . There was , all_the same , a buried hint of pride in her tone . The enormity of it all , the daring of it all , fed Potter ' s self-image . They didn ' t want to think a woman could do this , Potter would later proclaim . But she ran with the big boys , so she was expected to act like the big boys . Three days later , Potter called Zellner . She wanted another meeting ; she wanted to put her story on the record . On Wednesday , April 6 , accompanied by a court reporter , Zellner arrived to tape Gayle Potter ' s confession . Listening as she talked , Zellner considered this woman ' s motives . Yes , Potter hated Tony Brasel and wanted to get him . Yes , Potter knew that the rules against double_jeopardy , and the statute of limitation against perjury , probably protected her from new prosecution . But Potter also knew she was kissing off any chance she might have had for a governor ' s clemency or release through a federal habeas petition . In truth , since her conviction was based on_her_own perjury , the state might still be able to retry Potter . Clearly , Potter ' s confession now was against her own interests . Clearly , there was room for Zellner to run with this confession . All she had to do was convince Judge Michela that he , and his esteemed legal_system , had made a horrible mistake . By the time the hearing on Burrows ' request for a new trial began July 26 -- in the Kankakee courtroom where he ' d been tried , convicted and condemned -- there had been , if not a retreat , a certain adjustment made by some of those who ' d put him on Death Row . &quot; It wasn ' t my job to believe that Joe Burrows committed this crime , &quot; Brasel had told the Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette . &quot; But based upon the evidence , it was always my understanding that he did. &quot; Robert George &quot; could have &quot; stopped the tape during Frye ' s interrogation , Sheriff Mathy had been quoted as saying . &quot; In fact , my investigator is not going_to get_up and say it didn ' t happen.... I wish I ' d been there that night. &quot; Faced with such comments , Kathleen Zellner ' s petition and mounting news media attention , Judge Michela had concluded there was a lot about this case he didn ' t know . He was determined to remedy that situation . From the start , he overruled most of the lawyers ' objections to testimony , and intervened to ask his own questions of witnesses . Plainly , he wanted to hear everything . Truth-seeking , not legal process , was now paramount in Michela ' s court . One by one , various figures from the 5-year-old murder case appeared and settled into the witness_stand . First came Gayle Potter , confessing , describing her exchanges with Tony Brasel , explaining that she let Burrows go_to Death Row &quot; because I was afraid I was going_to be walking in his shoes. &quot; Next came Ralph Frye , recanting , describing how Investigator George &quot; shook his head &quot; and &quot; shut the tape_recorder off &quot; and &quot; said there was five shots. &quot; Then Jana West swore she ' d been with Burrows the night of Dulin ' s murder , Ron Boyer described Ralph Frye ' s first jailhouse recantation , Mathy defended his men ' s actions , George insisted he hadn ' t fed Frye , and Brasel denied everything . Finally , Joe Burrows testified -- for the first time ever . None of these witnesses mattered as much to Judge Michela , however , as did Iroquois County Detective Sgt . Randy Eimen . Eimen took_the_stand late on the first of the hearing ' s four days . Yes , he said in response to a question , it was Gayle Potter who ' d first mentioned the blue pickup_truck , on the day they arrested her . And yes -- he had mentioned that blue pickup_truck to Ralph Frye when they questioned him early the next morning . Frye first had denied any involvement , Eimen testified , then had started saying he ' d driven_up to Watseka with Joe and Sherri Burrows in their car . Eimen had stopped him ; Eimen had said , &quot; Ralph , Gayle said you came_in a truck. &quot; Soon after , Eimen had left the room , and George alone had taken Frye ' s tape-recorded statement . This testimony inspired Judge Michela to ask Eimen some questions . Michela : When you talked to Ralph Frye and Ralph told you that he and Joe Burrows and Sherri Burrows had gone_to Watseka in , I assume , Mr. Burrows ' car , you elected not to believe that ? Eimen : Yes . Michela : You elected to believe Gayle Potter and the blue pickup ? Eimen : Yes . Michela : Once you found_out that you couldn ' t find the blue pickup , that you could not connect Joe Burrows to a blue pickup ... did you ever follow up_to see if , in fact , Mrs . Burrows and Mr. Burrows and Mr. Frye had gone_to Watseka in his car ? Eimen : No , I don ' t believe so . It was a seemingly innocuous moment . But Eimen ' s testimony -- eventually confirmed by George -- was , to Michela , the critical key to the entire hearing , and to Burrows ' fate . Eimen ' s disclosure , the judge would explain later , &quot; absolutely shocked me. &quot; Burrows ' guilt , to Michela , had always hinged_on Frye , on the fact that what Frye said pretty well followed Potter ' s story . Now Eimen on the stand was saying Frye had first talked_about going_up to Watseka with Joe and his wife in a car -- a whole new aspect of what might have occurred . Now Eimen was saying the police had stopped that story to give Frye the blue pickup , and that only then had Frye said , OK , it was a blue pickup . Now Eimen -- most incredibly of all -- was saying that even after they ' d found_out there was no blue pickup , they ' d still stuck_with Potter ' s story and hadn ' t tried to investigate other possibilities . &quot; At that moment , &quot; Michela recalled later , &quot; I decided this ( Nov . 9 tape_recording ) was not Ralph Frye ' s statement , or partly not. &quot; That the police had been the link between Potter ' s and Frye ' s initial statements , of course , had been both a defense theme and a matter of apparent common_sense from the start . There are those who find it shocking that the judge was so shocked . To Michela , however , neither a defense_lawyer ' s argument nor common_sense transformed theory into fact . While on the bench , he felt utterly obliged to separate what he believed from what the facts were . Eimen was the key for him because with Eimen ' s testimony , what was once merely a likely theory -- even common_sense -- was now provable . Michela decided he wanted to listen again , in his chambers , to the actual tape of Frye talking to George , which had been played_at Burrows ' second trial . From what he heard , he couldn ' t conclude that the recorder had been turned_off four or five times , as Zellner claimed , but it was clear that long gaps existed between the questions by George and the answers by Frye . What ' s more , the questions were more like statements requiring Frye to concur . It occurred to Michela now just how different this initial statement of Frye ' s was from his later testimony . Here on this tape , Frye exonerated himself from involvement in the murder , saying he was merely present . In his later testimony , he is an accomplice , Burrows a killer , Potter a hero . He ' d been a little naive about what was going_on in Iroquois County , Michela realized . If he ' d understood , he would have sentenced Frye right after his trial and gotten him away from Potter . The similarity of their testimony no longer looked_to Michela like proof of Burrows ' guilt . The similarity now looked_like proof that Potter had coerced Frye to conform his story to hers . Kathleen Zellner cried as she struggled to write her closing argument at 4 o ' clock_on the morning she was to deliver it . If she failed here , Zellner thought , she ' d stop being a lawyer . It would be too hard to go_back into a courtroom , to feel the same about her profession and the legal_system . She ' d always thought people who were convicted were guilty ; now she ' d seen enough to know that wasn ' t so . The insight frightened and disturbed her . &quot; You , Your Honor , have the power to give Mr. Burrows back his life , &quot; Zellner told Michela later that morning . &quot; I am asking Your Honor to exercise that power.... You are the one who heard the evidence in all three trials , and you ' ve heard the evidence in the last week . Words cannot and will not ever convey the magnitude of the injustice that occurred in this courtroom.... When this is all_over , I want to be able to sit_down with Mr. Burrows ' three children and ... say something horrible happened to your father , but it is finally over . Evil people like Gayle Potter do not win . Lies do not win . I want to tell them that the truth has won. &quot; Five weeks later , on the morning of Sept . 2 , the first page of the judge ' s decision started rolling_out of the fax machine in Zellner ' s office . Then , because of a transmission problem , it stopped . The judge ' s office tried a second fax machine , but it didn ' t work either . At the Menard Correctional Center , Joe Burrows sat waiting_on an open line linked to Zellner ' s office ; the other convicts had donated all their phone time to him . Zellner could tell nothing from the one page that had come_through . She dialed the judge ' s private number . &quot; I ' m sorry , judge , &quot; she said . &quot; This may_not be proper , but I ' ve got_to know . What did you do ? &quot; Michela couldn ' t believe Zellner was nervous . She ' d acted so sure of herself in court . Didn ' t she know what he ' d do ? Potter ' s letter to Williamson and Jana West ' s testimony alone were enough . &quot; Why , I gave him a new trial , &quot; the judge said . Since 1972 , 50 prisoners had been freed from Death Rows across the country after their convictions were reversed or thrown_out , but Illinois had never freed a condemned convict because someone else recanted or confessed . Yet that singular action was precisely the one Zellner asked Michela to take when she and Burrows appeared before him at a Sept . 8 bond hearing . Without the testimony of its two eyewitnesses the state had no case against Burrows at all , she pointed_out , so Burrows couldn ' t possibly be retried . Zellner wanted bail set for Burrows . What ' s more , because he was indigent , she wanted him released on_his_own recognizance . Michela may have had little choice but to honor Zellner ' s request . Still , it is not the custom of trial_judges to release the prisoners they ' ve condemned to Death Row . Trial_judges leave that , if it ' s to happen at all , to appellate judges sitting hundreds or thousands of miles away -- judges looking_at lifetime tenure and piles of papers , rather than at an agitated community and a grieving family and a looming reelection campaign . Michela knew he could pass this thorny Burrows matter_to the Illinois Supreme Court . But he was friends with five of the seven justices ; in 1992 they ' d upheld Burrows ' conviction and sentence -- always a source of pride for a trial_judge . It was not fair or right to ask them now to overturn themselves . He had presided at three trials and this last hearing ; he had sentenced Burrows to death . He would set him free . As a guard , following his instructions , moved forward to unlock the prisoner ' s shackles , the judge spoke_to the man he ' d once condemned . &quot; I would suggest , Mr. Burrows , &quot; Michela advised , &quot; that you be very careful. &quot; Later , amid all_the tumult and hoopla ignited by the image of a just unchained man walking free down the Kankakee County_Courthouse steps , the judge would try to point_out that &quot; all I said was , there ' s enough for a new trial . I didn ' t say Burrows was not guilty. &quot; The heart of the_matter , though , was not lost on Michela ' s colleagues . On the night he let Burrows go , Michela dropped_by a bar where several other judges were watching a local news broadcast . Just as he entered , an image of Burrows exulting at a press_conference filled the bar ' s television screen . &quot; There he is , &quot; one of the judges joked , pointing at Michela . &quot; There ' s the judge who set a killer loose. &quot; All that remains unfinished now in Iroquois County is the fixing of responsibility for how Joe Burrows came_to spend five years on Death Row . The answer most commonly offered puts the blame chiefly on Gayle Potter . With a_few exceptions , that is how the news media and the talk_shows have portrayed the_matter . That also , generally , is how Judge Michela has portrayed it . In his ruling granting Burrows a new trial , Michela agreed with all but two of Zellner ' s six claims . He rejected the one charging Tony Brasel ( and through him , the sheriff ' s office ) with prosecutorial misconduct . He also rejected the one charging Ron Boyer , Burrows ' first defense_attorney , with ineffective assistance of counsel . Responsibility for what happened to Joe Burrows , Michela suggested , rested in places other_than the legal_system or its custodians . &quot; Potter is a case study of what can happen when one deceives , continues to deceive and is believed by the investigating authority , &quot; the judge wrote . &quot; The evidence presented at this hearing does not warrant the conclusion that prosecutorial misconduct occurred . The court does not believe Potter on this point . She is a vicious liar who brings this charge out of vindictiveness . She did not need any assistance from either Mathy or Brasel to create a scenario in which she is the hero and Burrows and Frye the perpetrators. &quot; As for Frye ' s testimony about the prosecutor and investigators , &quot; the court is compelled to conclude that , at this point , Frye does not know what he knows , what Eimen and George told him or what Potter led him to say. &quot; It was not necessary to destroy Boyer and Mathy and Brasel , Michela believed . He didn ' t have to go that far . What he wanted to do was deliver justice , free Burrows . That he had done . If he said Mathy did this , Brasel did that , where would he get_it from ? He wasn ' t going_to get_it from Potter or Frye . Nothing was provable . This conclusion , it goes without saying , does not suffice for everyone , particularly for some of those most intimate_with what has happened in Iroquois County . &quot; Michela absolved all_the lawyers , all_the people he still has to work with , &quot; Gayle Potter observed one fall morning , sitting in the same conference_room at the Dwight Correctional Center where she spent so many hours with Kathleen Zellner . &quot; There ' s a lot more going_on than what the judge wants to admit . that ' s not to lessen my blame , but I couldn ' t have done_it alone. &quot; Joe Burrows agrees . &quot; When someone is_on the inside , they know how they can twist things , &quot; he said as he sat in the kitchen of his home_in Homer , Ill. , fielding a flood of congratulatory phone_calls . &quot; The judge blames Gayle and exonerates the system . But see , it takes two . Gayle can ' t manipulate the system unless someone on the inside is willing to go_with her . Gayle is an evil person , but Gayle was just trying to protect her ass . And Ralph is real gullible . I hold no grudge against them . My grudge is against those inside the system . They ' re supposed to be above people like Gayle. &quot; Others , particularly lawyers , tend instead to blame the court-appointed attorneys who defended Burrows and Frye . Yes , they say , these attorneys have limited resources , yes they are paid a quarter of the going rate for private attorneys . Still , there should have been more investigation and challenges . Above all , there should have been motions to suppress Frye ' s initial Nov . 9 statement . Why didn ' t they call their clients ' alibi witnesses ? Why didn ' t Ron Boyer withdraw as Burrows ' attorney so he could testify about his encounters with Frye ? In an ideal adversary system , the defense_attorney is supposed to fight as hard as the prosecutor . that ' s where the system broke_down . that ' s why this happened . Only a_few , in all this animated discussion , think to point a finger of blame at Judge Michela . Only a_few think to ask just what the role of a judge is in achieving justice , or whether the steward of the legal_system shirks his duty by ceding his judgment to a jury ' s . Among those few who do raise such questions , as it happens , is Judge Michela . He questions himself and plays devil ' s advocate endlessly . He wishes he had kept Frye away from Potter and the Iroquois County Jail . He wishes he ' d removed Ron Boyer as Burrows ' attorney and allowed him to testify . He debates with his wife , who asks , &quot; Why can ' t you guys admit you make mistakes ? &quot; In the end , though , Michela flatly rejects the suggestion that he is responsible_for what happened to Joe Burrows . &quot; The jury chose to believe the testimony of Potter and Frye , which led to death-qualifying conviction of ( Burrows ) , &quot; he wrote in his ruling . &quot; Based on that evidence , the death_penalty was warranted and no apology is_due from the sentencing judge. &quot; God knows , we love the good king , Michela likes to say . But we fear the bad king . As God told Israel , if you want a king , you must take everything that comes_with it . &quot; The power we hand judges to overrule or direct verdicts is awesome , just colossal , &quot; Michela said one November afternoon , weeks after the initial tumult over Burrows ' release had subsided . &quot; It ' s so easy to abuse it , so easy to advance your personal views . Sure , I could have intervened . But would you give me the power to direct a guilty verdict as well ? You know when I ' m a good judge ? When I agree with you . Sometimes a Burrows will happen . I feel badly ; I ' m not an unkind or unfeeling person . But this is the price we pay_for the democracy of the jury_system . It wasn ' t Mathy or Brasel who convicted Burrows , it was a jury . We went_through the system , we followed the process. &quot; And that venerable process , Michela points_out , continues to this day . Everyone , he observes with satisfaction , still is playing their prescribed roles . The Illinois attorney_general ' s office prepares to appeal Michela ' s ruling , claiming the judge &quot; went_against the wishes of the jury. &quot; Kathleen Zellner readies both a cross-appeal , seeking affirmation of her prosecutorial misconduct claim , and a civil suit against Iroquois County and Tony Brasel . Frye ' s appellate attorney plans to petition Michela for his client ' s release . The Iroquois County state ' s attorney considers filing new murder_charges against Gayle Potter . Soon , once again , lawyers will argue , witnesses will testify , judges will listen , juries will rule . There is responsibility yet to be fixed , penalties yet to be paid . &quot; Act I was the crime and the investigation , &quot; Michela says . &quot; Act II was what I did . Act III is still to come. &quot;</TEXT>
