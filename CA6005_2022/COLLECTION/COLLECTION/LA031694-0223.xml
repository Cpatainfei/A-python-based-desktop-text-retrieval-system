   <HEADLINE> NEW COSTA MESA CAR DEALERSHIP GETS HAWAIIAN PURIFICATION RITE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The growth of Orange County ' s international business_community not only expands trade , it also exposes executives and workers to new and different ways of doing things . Employees of South Coast Acura in Costa Mesa received a lesson in cultural diversity Tuesday as they watched a traditional Hawaiian purification and blessing ceremony held to help ease the dealership ' s move_into its new facility . South Coast , formerly situated in Huntington Beach , is owned by Tony Management Group , a Honolulu-based company that has one other California dealership and four auto dealerships , a camper shell factory and an auto paint and body shop in Hawaii . Tony Masamitsu , company owner , said the ceremony is part of the Hawaiian culture and often is conducted in the islands in concert with religious blessing ceremonies at the opening of businesses owned by Japanese , Chinese or Korean investors . Masamitsu , accompanied by his wife , daughter and several associates , flew in from Honolulu for the brief ceremony . Masamitsu asked David Nuuhiwa of Anaheim , an elder in the Mormon_church and a native Hawaiian , to perform the purification rite at the Costa Mesa dealership , formerly the location of Norm Reeves Acura . * Nuuhiwa -- pronounced New-ew-HEE-vah -- began the ceremony with a prayer , in Hawaiian , asking that the business and all those working there be blessed with good things . Wearing a white suit , symbol of purity , and a flowing lei of Mallee leaves from Hawaii , Nuuhiwa then slowly walked through the dealership ' s showroom , offices , service_area and back lot , sprinkling salty water from the tips of a whisk made of Ti leaves . The bitter-tasting salt water , made from Hawaiian rock_salt , is used to drive_away evil and open the building to goodness , he said . &quot; It was interesting , &quot; said Mark Striggles , general sales manager for the dealership . &quot; I ' ve never seen this before , so I learned something. &quot;</TEXT>
