   <HEADLINE> NEW SEPARATIST WRANGLE LOOMS FOR QUEBECKERS ; CANADA : POLLS PREDICT PROVINCIAL VOTERS WILL SIDE TODAY WITH THE INDEPENDENCE-MINDED PARTI QUEBECOIS AFTER A BLAND CAMPAIGN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After an unexpectedly airless , dispassionate campaign , Quebec voters decide today whether to plunge Canada into a new wrangle over whether the province should separate from the rest of the country . Most polls predict a sizable parliamentary majority for Parti Quebecois , which has promised to hold a referendum on Quebec ' s sovereignty within 10 months if it takes_over the provincial government . Despite the stakes , the 50-day campaign has raised more shrugs than hackles in Quebec . Analysts cite a number of reasons for voter ennui . Part of it is timing . The six weeks leading_up to Labor_Day are regarded in Quebec as a period for vacationing , not politics . And neither of the principal party leaders , Jacques Parizeau of the PQ and Daniel Johnson of the Liberals , is particularly inspiring . The last time the country went_through this struggle , in the 1970s and early ' 80s , the forces of Canadian unity were led by the brilliant , acerbic Pierre Elliott Trudeau and the separatists by the anguished , intense Rene Levesque . In contrast , when Parizeau and Johnson , Quebec ' s current premier , met in their televised debate Aug . 29 , they engaged in a bloodless exchange of numbers , like two bookkeepers in a game of dueling calculators . The post-mortem consensus : a thuddingly dull draw . But what may be most important of all are the often contradictory , insular impulses of the Quebec voter . While the rest of Canada , and much of the world , sees separatism as the campaign ' s overriding issue , for most Quebeckers the dominant element is simple fatigue with the Liberals . Liberals have governed here for nine years , the last four of which have been spent in economic recession . The polls say as much , and so does Raynald Coutu , a 51-year-old antiques dealer in this riverside town of 14 # 000 set amid rolling hills about 80 miles southeast of Montreal . &quot; We need a change , and Parizeau has around him some new blood , &quot; Coutu said , sitting behind a formidable desk in a corner of his shop . He also thinks the PQ will be more assertive on behalf of Quebec in the struggles over control of taxes and government programs that are the staples of Canadian domestic politics . &quot; Parizeau will be more aggressive and we ' ll have a better chance to gain something , &quot; he said . But if Parizeau puts Quebec independence to a vote next year as he says he will , Coutu will cast his ballot &quot; No. &quot; In 1980 , when Levesque ' s PQ government put a similar referendum on the ballot and lost , 60 % to 40 % , Coutu voted_in favor . But since then , Coutu has bought and sold one antiques store and purchased another . He made a fine profit buying and refurbishing a Montreal office_building , unloading it before the recession . Sovereignty , and all_the economic uncertainties that accompany it , is a young_person ' s game , Coutu said . &quot; If you ' re 50 years old , and look_at what you have , and your pension coming_up , you wonder , why should you risk it ? &quot; he said . Coutu is in the large middle ground of Quebec ' s French-speaking voters -- pollster Jean-Marc Leger puts it at 20 % of the electorate -- who lean toward independence but are hesitant to take the final leap . What they really are looking_for is some kind of special accommodation from the rest of Canada . The longstanding joke in Quebec puts it this way : &quot; Quebeckers want an independent Quebec within a united Canada. &quot; But the rest of Canada does not seem to be in an accommodating mood when it comes_to Quebec -- and that gives hard-line separatists hope . It is perhaps with voters like Coutu in mind that the PQ came_up with its campaign slogan : &quot; Another Way to Govern. &quot; Parizeau has not backed_away from his promise to hold a sovereignty referendum after taking_over the provincial premiership . But he has tried to focus his campaign on economic issues rather than the separatist option . Parizeau says he is talking_about issues that voters are interested in ; critics suggest he is running_away from his party ' s founding principle . In a recent campaign appearance , Johnson contended that Parizeau is soft-pedaling sovereignty because the case for it &quot; can ' t be made . It ' s no show , no go . . . . If the case could be made , he would have made_it 20 years ago and every day since. &quot; Following what was generally regarded_as a disappointing showing in the debate , Johnson has stepped_up the pace and vigor of his campaign , finally shaking his image as an emotionless technocrat . He is making never-say-die speeches to party faithful and sparring with journalists , particularly opinionated radio talk_show hosts . &quot; You ' re telling lies ! &quot; he shouted at one . &quot; What you ' re saying is dumb ! &quot; Johnson , the son of one Quebec premier and the brother of another , became premier in January after Robert Bourassa retired because of ill_health . A former business_executive with a Harvard MBA , Johnson held various economic posts in the Bourassa government before taking the top job . But political insiders say that unless the Liberals win at least 40 of the 125 seats in the provincial Parliament today , Johnson could be toppled from his leadership post . For all_of his problems , polls continue to show Johnson , 49 , personally more popular than Parizeau , even if his party trails the PQ . Parizeau ' s image problems are longstanding . A former university professor , he fairly radiates smugness , and he is often described in the media as &quot; arrogant. &quot; The holder of a doctorate from the London School of Economics who speaks English with an Etonian accent , Parizeau ' s tendency toward three-piece suits and phrases such_as &quot; good show &quot; brings repeated references in the English-language press to upper-class bumbler Bertie Wooster and other P . G . Wodehouse characters . One of the more amusing aspects of the campaign has been the handlers ' efforts to transform the candidates into Regular Guys . Johnson has been photographed playing softball , volleyball and golf . Unfortunately , he always seems to be wearing street shoes more appropriate for a bank board_meeting . Parizeau , 64 , went_on Musique Plus , the Quebec version of MTV , and disclosed his favorite scatological term and that a childhood nickname was &quot; vibrant weasel. &quot; With the polls showing the PQ building its lead , Parizeau ' s campaign has , of late , curtailed his schedule , limited his access to the press and placed him in carefully controlled appearances . Jobs and the economy are the themes of Parizeau ' s message , but Quebec independence underlies it . For example , he has promised a new freeway and an extension of the Montreal subway , lower air fares to remote parts of the province , shorter waiting times at hospitals and improved social programs -- all without raising taxes or increasing the provincial deficit . The money will be available when independence eliminates duplicative programs of the national and provincial governments , he says . Parizeau ' s estimate is that elimination of duplication would save $ 3 billion , but he has never explained how he arrived_at that total . One potentially incendiary issue that has received little attention in the campaign is language . The last PQ government ( 1976-85 ) enforced a law requiring that all outdoor signs be in French only and that virtually all business in the province be conducted in French . The law was loudly resented by the province ' s sizable non-French-speaking population . It later was modified by Bourassa ' s government , although French remains the officially dominant language . The PQ platform calls_for no major language law changes , but some elements within the party_favor tougher legislation , including such provisions as requiring French proficiency to enter English-language universities . Most polls point to the PQ winning as_many as 85 to 90 seats in the 125-member National Assembly , as the provincial Parliament is called . These same polls show a decline in sentiment for independence , with as few as four in 10 Quebeckers saying they would support some sort of sovereignty for the province . But pollster Leger cautions that the post-election dynamic of a separatist government in Quebec_City could raise support for independence .</TEXT>
