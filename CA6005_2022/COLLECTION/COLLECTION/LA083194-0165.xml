   <HEADLINE> MAN ON PROBATION IN DENNY CASE IS JAILED ; COURTS : ANTOINE MILLER PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO GUN POSSESSION . IN SEPARATE HEARING , A JUDGE ORDERS HIM LOCKED_UP FOR VIOLATING TERMS OF HIS SENTENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A man on probation for assaulting a motorist during the early hours of the Los Angeles riots pleaded not_guilty Tuesday to a gun possession charge but was jailed when a judge found him in violation of his probation . Antoine Miller , 22 , faces a maximum six-year prison sentence if convicted of the charge of being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm , a Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office spokesman said . After pleading not_guilty to the weapons charge Tuesday , Miller appeared before Superior_Court Judge James Bascue , who revoked his probation in a separate hearing and ordered him held without bail . Los Angeles police investigators said Miller was involved in an argument with two men who were in a car Aug . 21 near 71st Street and Normandie Avenue , just a block away from the intersection where trucker Reginald O . Denny and several other motorists were assaulted as rioting broke_out two years ago . During the argument last week , Miller ran_into a house , armed himself with a chrome-plated pistol , pointed the gun at the driver and tried to fire it when it jammed , investigators said . Miller apparently had fired the gun several times before reaching the driver ' s side of the car , police said . Miller was arrested Friday -- five days after the incident -- when police searched a home where he was staying and recovered a 9-millimeter , semiautomatic_pistol , police said . * The case remains under investigation and Miller could face other charges , the district_attorney ' s spokesman said . Although Miller was videotaped opening the door to Denny ' s truck as it stopped at Florence and Normandie avenues , he was charged with attempted murder under a prosecution theory that he aided and abetted those who brutally beat the trucker . Miller ' s case was separated from that of Damian Monroe Williams and Henry Keith Watson . They were acquitted on the most serious charges stemming from the Denny beating . Williams was convicted of mayhem for hitting Denny in the head with a brick , and was sentenced to 10 years in prison . Watson was convicted of misdemeanor assault for placing his foot on Denny ' s neck , but he received no jail time because the 17 months he had spent in jail awaiting trial was greater than the maximum penalty . Three weeks after verdicts were returned in Williams ' and Watson ' s trial , Miller pleaded guilty to felonious assault and two misdemeanor charges in exchange for 27 months probation . He pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon on Marisa Bejar for throwing a telephone_book encased in metal at the car in which she was riding -- opening a gash in her head and showering her 7-month-old child with shattered glass . Miller also pleaded guilty to receiving motorist Alicia Maldonado ' s stolen purse and to grand theft for taking a bag containing papers from Denny ' s truck -- both misdemeanors . When he was sentenced in November , Superior_Court Judge Cecil J . Mills told him : &quot; You will be carrying the key to the penitentiary around in your pocket , young man. &quot; Miller received his first strike under California ' s &quot; three-strike &quot; law in the felonious assault on Bejar , said Mike Botula , a spokesman for the district_attorney ' s office . If Miller is convicted on the weapons charge he faces , that would be his second strike , and the maximum penalty of three years would double , Botula said .</TEXT>
