   <HEADLINE> DOCUMENTARY ; GETTING TO REBEL CHECHNYA IS A BATTLE IN ITSELF ; A CORRESPONDENT RUNS INTO ROADBLOCKS TRYING TO COVER CONFLICT IN THE CAUCASUS -- AND ALSO A CUNNING TAXI DRIVER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The captain at the roadside militia post studied our press credentials and phoned his superior . As we waited , truckers and farmers breezed_through the checkpoint . Half an hour later , he lied to us : &quot; There ' s a crowd of armed people ahead . For your own safety , I cannot let you through. &quot; The captain , a cheerful , stocky little man with a Kalashnikov rifle and bulletproof_vest , was just one of a string of obstacles on the way from Moscow to Grozny , the capital of tiny , secessionist Chechnya . It is a 1 # 000-mile journey that should take two hours by air . But here in the Caucasus Mountains , distance and time have a way of expanding to frustrate the finest of Moscow ' s calculations , the grandest of imperial designs . Even for an unarmed Moscow correspondent , getting_to Grozny is an unpredictable ordeal . Czarist armies needed three centuries to bring this turbulent region to heel . Now , after seven decades of Russian monarchy and seven decades of &quot; scientific socialism , &quot; the Caucasus is again a caldron of ethnic unrest . So it was a historic event when thousands of Russian troops moved_into heavily armed Chechnya to try to crush the oil-rich Muslim republic ' s self-declared independence . Awakened by the news early on Dec . 11 , I fretted over the odds of reaching Grozny ahead of the Russians . The Itar-Tass news_bulletin said three tank columns began converging on the city at 7 a.m. , from 40 to 60 miles away , at speeds_up to 12 m.p.h. At that rate . . . . I rushed to the airport with Sergei Loiko , a Russian reporter for The Times . A Russian blockade had halted flights to Grozny since August . The nearest we could land was Mineralniye Vody , a Russian city 190 miles to the northwest . By 5 p.m. , an intrepid taxi driver named Ruslan had agreed to take us in his big black Volga . Grozny was four hours away , but he warned : &quot; I cannot guarantee we ' ll get there. &quot; We arrived_at 5 the next morning . Along the way was a maze of roadblocks in three tiny republics , each guarded by police , vigilantes and assorted gunmen , each with its own foreign_policy . The militia captain who turned us back in the Russian republic of Kabardino-Balkaria was taking orders from someone in Moscow who didn ' t want reporters to witness the conflict . But Ruslan found a way around -- a two-hour trek on muddy back roads across moonlit collective_farms -- and on to the next ministate , Ingushetia , where the first police roadblock was pro-Chechen . There , Lt . Bekhan Korigov offered help arranging VIP clearance through every checkpoint to the Chechen border . &quot; If the Russians enter Grozny , the Ingush , the Kabards , the Balkars , the Cherkessians -- all_the Caucasus peoples -- will rise_up , and that will be the end of Russia , &quot; the lieutenant declared . &quot; You ' ll see. &quot; But where were the Russians ? Hadn ' t they already entered Grozny ? Not yet . Moscow ' s biggest tank offensive since the Afghan War was meeting far more resistance than Ruslan ' s Volga . The story of the week was not the storming of Grozny but the bogging down of a huge military machine . Before we could begin to find_out why this was happening , it was first necessary to check_out of that death trap of a hotel in Grozny where we had stupidly crashed after 5 a.m. The other guests turned_out to be out-of-town guerrillas -- Muslims lured from places like Afghanistan and Syria to wage holy war against Slavs , and Slavs from Ukraine with their own national grievances against the Russians . It was a multinational snipers ' nest with no food , heat or water . An Islamic Rambo juggled a hand_grenade in the hallway . &quot; We came here to defend Ukrainian and Chechen freedom , &quot; boasted Sasha , a beefy blond with a Kalashnikov rifle , a Los Angeles Raiders jacket and a Miami Dolphins cap turned backward on his head . The first resistance to Col . Ivan Gromov ' s tank column came not from mercenaries like Sasha but from 150 Chechen farmers . Leaving their guns home , they milled_around in the road where his tanks had stopped 20 miles northeast of Grozny . Gromov , a veteran of other ethnic conflicts around Russia ' s edge , is a man who knows his limits . He took us aside , away from the crowd , which , perhaps because of our presence , had started shouting at the Russians to go_home . &quot; My mission is to disarm the Chechens , but I ' m not going_to risk my men ' s lives doing_it , &quot; he said . &quot; You have to be careful even how you talk with these people , &quot; he added . &quot; They are Muslims . A drunken Chechen harassed me , but I couldn ' t tell him he was drunk because drinking is against his religion and he would have felt grossly insulted. &quot; The tanks were_full of other Russian officers and soldiers who didn ' t want to offend the Chechens ' sensibilities . Or spill their blood . Or die in their holy war . So after a week of fog , peaceful and armed Chechen resistance , and wavering Russian will , the columns stopped short of Grozny . Finally , the Russian high_command resorted_to bomb and artillery strikes on the city ' s edges . In the eye of the storm , on the ninth floor of his presidential palace , sat Gen . Dzhokar M . Dudayev , the leader of Chechnya ' s independence movement . Could I interview him ? &quot; That depends_on whether you voted for Bill_Clinton , &quot; said Dudayev ' s press secretary . Huh ? It seems that the American president had irritated the renegade Chechen by dismissing his independence war as an &quot; internal Russian problem. &quot; I had been intrigued , even before coming_to work in Moscow , by Dudayev ' s folk hero status in the little nations under Russia ' s neo-imperial thumb , his railing against Kremlin &quot; cynicism , vandalism , barbarism and satanism , &quot; his threats to blow_up Russian nuclear_power plants . In the eventual interview , the rebel general sounded almost smug about the Russian siege of Grozny , a decrepit and lawless city that ' s a haven for arms traffickers , drug dealers , counterfeiters and car thieves . He had drawn the Russian bear into a quagmire , he said , from which it cannot easily advance nor retreat . &quot; We have achieved a brilliant victory . Now Russia ' s problems will grow in geometric proportions. &quot; When time came_to leave Chechnya , I was amazed at the ease of the journey . No roadblocks , no checkpoints , no tanks . Our taxi averaged 50 m.p.h. to Makhachkala , the nearest airport east of Dudayev ' s republic . I wondered how long it would take the Russians .</TEXT>
