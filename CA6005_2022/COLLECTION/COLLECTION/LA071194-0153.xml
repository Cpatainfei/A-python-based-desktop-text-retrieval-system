   <HEADLINE> KIM ' S DEATH , G-7 MEETING LIKELY TO HIT TOKYO STOCKS ; MARKETS : SOME PREDICT A 300-POINT DROP . DOLLAR RESUMES ITS FALL AFTER INDUSTRIAL NATIONS SHOW NO SIGNS OF A RESCUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stocks are expected to decline today in Tokyo following the death of North_Korea ' s leader and a disappointing meeting of the Group of Seven nations this weekend that yielded little support for the sagging dollar . After leaders of the world ' s major industrial countries failed to come_to its rescue , the dollar resumed its decline against the yen . The dollar opened at 98.30 yen on the Tokyo foreign_exchange market today , down 0.23 from Friday ' s close . But the market ' s focus today in Japan is likely to be_on Friday ' s death of 82-year-old North_Korean President Kim Il Sung . &quot; The most important news , obviously , is North_Korea , &quot; said David Harris , a Japanese equity salesman at Barclays de Zoete Wedd . &quot; The fact that this does create uncertainty is not good for the market at all , and with the stronger yen today , I think we could see this trading down 300 points , &quot; he said . Kim died just two weeks before a historic summit with South_Korean President Kim Young Sam aimed at paving the way for increased economic ties on the peninsula . While tension over North_Korea ' s suspected nuclear_weapons development program has led to a stronger dollar in the past , currency traders in Tokyo expect any rebound in the dollar to be limited . that ' s because any gains will be met with more dollar selling by Japanese exporters to repatriate profits earned overseas . A weaker dollar typically is bad news for stocks because a stronger yen cuts_into profits at Japan ' s big-name exporters and makes fixed asset investments such_as bonds more attractive . On Friday , share prices declined amid concern that the G-7 nations would do little to shore_up the dollar . The benchmark Nikkei 225-stock average dropped 93.51 points to 20 # 526.51. Over the weekend , the G-7 nations showed restraint in supporting a stronger U.S. currency . The countries ' finance_ministers said a further weakening of the dollar against the yen and European currencies is &quot; not desirable , &quot; but they failed to announce a joint plan to defend the greenback . In company news , the Japanese government has decided to comply with a U.S. request that Japan submit &quot; voluntary &quot; measures to increase overseas procurement by Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. , the Nihon Keizai newspaper said Sunday . Japanese trade negotiators have been resisting the U.S._government ' s request to do so , citing NTT as a private company . Japan ' s major trading companies plan to set_up holding companies in China as part of their efforts to increase direct investment in the country , the Nihon Keizai newspaper said . Mitsubishi Corp . has filed a request with the government for permission to set_up such a company in Shanghai . Mitsui &amp; Co . is considering a similar move_in Beijing . Itochu Corp . set_up a holding company in Beijing last year . Toyota Motor Corp. , the largest Japanese car_maker , will start operation of its new plant in Australia on July 18 , the Nihon Keizai newspaper said . The plant , located in a suburb of Melbourne , will supply cars for export to Asia . Japan ' s major steelmakers are reducing the number of engineers by attrition and transfer to affiliates as part of their cost-cutting efforts , the Nihon Keizai newspaper said . Nippon Steel Corp . the world ' s largest steelmaker , will cut the number of engineers by 30 % to 40 % from the current level , the paper said . Nikkei stock index futures for June delivery fell 130 points to 20 # 620 in Osaka and declined 130 points to 20 # 620 in Singapore .</TEXT>
