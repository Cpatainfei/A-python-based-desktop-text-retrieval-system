   <HEADLINE> BACK TO BASICS : THE CHILLY BAVARIAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cool , creamy Bavarian and hot summer days -- a dynamite pairing made even better when fresh summer fruit is added . The texture of the chilled dessert teams well with peaches , nectarines , plums or berries . Vanilla-flavored Bavarian cream makes an excellent foil for the fruit , but for variety you can reduce the extract and substitute fruit_juice , liqueur or wine for part of the milk . Berries or small pieces of fruit can also be folded into the cream mixture before gelling . For a dramatic presentation , chill the Bavarian cream mixture in a decorative mold or parfait_glasses . Layering or marbling two different colors of custard is equally attractive . Traditional Bavarian cream recipes call_for folding beaten egg_whites into the cooked custard along with the whipped cream . Due_to concern over salmonella , updated versions omit the raw egg_whites . The yolks are cooked with gelatin , sugar and milk until the mixture coats the back of a metal spoon ( Step 1 ) . After removing from the heat , vanilla is stirred in and the mixture is cooled , then chilled , stirring occasionally , until it mounds when dropped from a spoon ( Step 2 ) . Sweetened whipped cream is folded into the custard mixture ( Step 3 ) before it is poured into a decorative mold ( Step 4 ) , which has been coated with vegetable spray . Chill at least three to four hours overnight before unmolding -- overnight is preferable . Dip the mold briefly in warm water before unmolding onto a platter ( Step 5 ) or serving dish . Garnish with fresh fruit just before serving .
