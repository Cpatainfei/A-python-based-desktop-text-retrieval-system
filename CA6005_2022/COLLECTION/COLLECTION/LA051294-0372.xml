   <TEXT> TENNIS CHAMPS After taking its knocks in football and basketball , University brought_home a City Section championship trophy . The Warriors defeated Taft , 23-6 1 / 2 , to win the 4-A Division tennis championship Tuesday at the Racquet Center in Studio City . University ' s Jay Jackson won three of his four singles matches and Aapo Aro , a transfer student from Finland , suffered his first loss of the season but won three other matches . The Warriors dominated the doubles competition winning seven of nine sets . University ' s Jason Barkham and Matt Levin , three-year varsity starters , swept their three matches . &quot; We were more talented and more experienced , &quot; University Coach Tom Anderson said . &quot; What makes_it even better is we won with style and class . I don ' t remember a championship being won with such a lopsided score . This is the most rewarding victory of my career. &quot; SWIMMING ALONG Bruno Diederichs and Lenny Krayzelburg were the outstanding swimmers for Santa Monica in the three-day California Community_College state meet at Cypress College . Diederichs swam 4 minutes 37.69 seconds to win the 500-yard freestyle on the opening day and swam a school-record 15:54.51 to win the 1 # 650 freestyle . Diederichs also broke his own record of 9:37.84 in the 1 # 000 and finished fourth in the 400 individual medley ( 4:10.70 ) . Krayzelburg , a Fairfax graduate , won the 100 backstroke in a school-record 50.74. It was also the fastest time in the nation at the community_college level . He also won the 200 backstroke in a national record 1:47.91. He also finished fourth in the 50 freestyle ( 21.29 ) . Krayzelburg was named the meet ' s most outstanding swimmer . ABOVE BELIEF It ' s hard to imagine upperclassmen looking_up_to a sophomore for inspiration . Unless , of course , you ' re volleyball standout Raoul Williams . Williams , a sophomore outside hitter , had 28 kills and served 16 points , including the game-winner , as University beat Bell , 15-6 , 15-12 , 15-10 , Tuesday in the City 4-A finals at University . &quot; He ' s amazing , &quot; Bell Coach Mike Mayfield said about Williams , the Western League co-most valuable player . &quot; I look_at him as a teaching tool for our hitters for next year . He has a great jump serve . Face it , he beat us . They went_to him a_million times. &quot; Nick Strouse had 13 kills and Mark Williams , Raoul ' s younger brother , had nine kills to lead the Warriors ' attack . Setter Jamie Strofs had only one unforced error . The Warriors ( 14-1 ) play Granada Hills ( 15-1 ) at 8 p.m. Friday in the championship match at Cal State Northridge . The City 4-A final matches Williams and Granada Hills ' Mike DiSimone , who had 22 kills Tuesday in the victory over Palisades . &quot; I don ' t think we ' ll try to stop Mike , &quot; University Coach Neal Newman said . &quot; He ' s going_to get his attack and we ' re going to get ours . They are in the same position . They have to figure_out how to stop us. &quot; University won City titles in 1975 , 1985 , 1987 and 1992 . The Warriors will play without Western League co-MVP Michael Rupp , who left the team because of academic reasons . FALLING_SHORT Palisades fell_short in its bid for a second upset . Palisades senior middle blocker Gaby Amar had a match-high 25 kills , but the defending City 4-A champions were no match for third-seeded Granda Hills , 15-7 , 13-15 , 15-8 , 15-12 , in Tuesday ' s other semifinal . The host Highlanders were led by DiSimone , who had nine kills in the deciding game and the match-clinching kill . Amar had 10 kills in the final game to keep the Dolphins close . Junior outside hitter Dan Von Wetter had 11 kills , including the first nine without an error until midway through the third game for Palisades ( 6-10 ) . Steve Pardridge had eight kills and Jeff Lemen added seven for the 10th-seeded Dolphins . Last week , Palisades pulled_off an upset of second-seeded Westchester , 6-15 , 16-14 , 15-5 , and 18-16 . The Comets played without all-league junior outside hitter Kevin Bergschneider , who has been out because of a broken hand . Palisades Coach Howard Enstedt made a lineup change , substituting 6-foot-3 junior Darin Guthrie into the lineup for 5-11 junior Erin Whalley . &quot; I made the move because Guthrie ' s offense is starting to come_around , &quot; Enstedt said . &quot; I switched Whalley with one of our setters on the front_line to give us more firepower. &quot; The Dolphins , who have won nine City championships , missed 6-7 James Turner , who transferred to Ojai Thacher . &quot; He got his scholarship to UCLA and said bye , &quot; Enstedt said . &quot; That set us back three months. &quot; SCOUTING REPORT Attention Division I softball coaches . In need of a quality infielder ? Palisades had four infielders make Western League first_team and Coach Dave Weinstein believes they ' re future Division I prospects . &quot; This is the best infield I ' ve ever had considering the level of competition , &quot; said Weinstein , who coached baseball during the mid-1970s . &quot; They have an uncanny mechanical ability with the glove. &quot; Junior first_baseman Millie Rodriguez led the team with a . 640 batting_average and four home_runs in Coastal Conference play . Sophomore shortstop Mindy Spire ( .625 , four home_runs ) , freshman second_baseman Laurel Swigert ( .475 ) and sophomore Sabrina Romero ( .452 ) proved to be equally adept with the bat as well as the glove . The foursome completed 14 double_plays . Pitcher Meg Reinis ( .390 ) was named to the first_team as a designated hitter and sophomore catcher Maritza Jaramillo ( .425 ) was selected to the second team . Reinis ' brother Lee plays baseball for University . &quot; We have people come_down to see our catcher throw runners out and the infield turn double_plays , &quot; Weinstein said . &quot; Even the varsity baseball_team came_out to watch. &quot; The Dolphins ( 11-4 and 8-2 in Coastal Conference play ) finished second behind Westchester in the Western League . But with all_the key players returning , the Dolphins should contend for a City 4-A title next season . All this team needs is a new coach . Weinstein , who turns 60 in July , is retiring at the end of the school_year . TOUGH BREAK University senior utility infielder Sandy Ginoza suffered a broken right leg two weeks ago while sliding into third_base during a softball_game against Manual Arts . Ginoza suffered a multiple fracture and underwent surgery last week . &quot; I don ' t think Sandy will be playing competitive sports again , &quot; University Coach Patricia Peisner said . &quot; The most painful thing is that she will not be able to compete for her Japanese traveling league basketball team. &quot; Ginoza , who played third_base , outfield and pitched , led University to a share of the Metro League title . The Warriors hope sophomore pitcher Megan Fahey , who missed the season because of tendinitis in her right elbow , will return next season . &quot; She suffers from overuse syndrome , &quot; Peisner said , noting that Fahey also pitches_in a youth softball league . &quot; No one saw much of her this year . She needs to get_on a strength program to handle the grind she has put herself through. &quot; SEAN WATERS and MIKE LAZARUS</TEXT>
