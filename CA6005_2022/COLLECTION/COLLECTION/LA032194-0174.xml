   <HEADLINE> SOME BOLIVIANS FEAR RETURN OF EX-DICTATOR ; SOUTH_AMERICA : GARCIA MEZA IS EXPECTED TO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON FORMER CRONIES , COLLABORATORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The expected extradition of former dictator Luis Garcia Meza , under arrest in neighboring Brazil and wanted here to serve a 30-year prison sentence , could spell trouble for some Bolivians . Brazilian police arrested Garcia Meza in Sao Paulo on March 11 . Since then , Bolivia has been abuzz with speculation that the returning fugitive may incriminate many people who collaborated with his 1980-1981 regime . &quot; There are a lot of people sweating bullets , &quot; said a foreign diplomat in La Paz . &quot; I think a lot of people were hoping he would never be found. &quot; When the Supreme Court began its trial for Garcia Meza in 1986 for a long list of crimes , he was free on_his_own recognizance . But when the court_ordered his arrest in January , 1989 , he went_into hiding . Before and after his conviction in absentia last year , it was common knowledge that Garcia Meza moved quietly around Bolivia and took trips abroad with false documents . &quot; There were more sightings of Garcia Meza than Elvis Presley , &quot; the diplomat said . Garcia Meza ' s capture has been hailed as a strong signal that military coups and dictatorial abuses will no longer go unpunished in Bolivia . Bringing more of his former collaborators and later protectors to justice would reinforce the message . But paradoxically , some analysts said , it might also destabilize Bolivia ' s democracy by stirring_up political and military unrest . According to &quot; sightings &quot; late in 1993 , the former army general had taken_up residence in Sao Paulo . The information was confirmed by an informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Brazil , the diplomat said . He said the DEA passed the information to Brazilian federal police , who tracked the fugitive down and arrested him in an apartment that he had moved_into recently . When Brazilian authorities presented Garcia Meza to reporters after his arrest , he said he had been writing a book that will be &quot; a bomb , &quot; revealing names of people who were secretly involved in his 1980 coup . Bolivian officials say a key tip on Garcia Meza ' s presence in Sao Paulo came from a Bolivian woman living there . The woman wrote to German Quiroga , the Bolivian minister of government , saying she had spotted the general jogging in a Sao Paulo park with bodyguards . Quiroga said he passed the information on to the U.S. Embassy in La Paz . Quiroga has told reporters that the woman deserves a $ 220 # 000 reward that had been offered by the Bolivian government for information leading to Garcia Meza ' s arrest . But there is a problem in paying the reward : The letter-writer identified herself only with initials . Garcia Meza seized power in a violent coup in July , 1980 , that reportedly was backed by neo-fascists and drug_traffickers . During the 13-month regime , notoriously brutal and corrupt , at least 50 people were killed and 22 others disappeared after being arrested . The former dictator and 43 officials of his regime were convicted last April of crimes including genocide , murder , sedition and corruption . Ten of those convicted are now in Bolivian prisons . About 10 are still fugitives , and others have won &quot; conditional suspension &quot; of short sentences . Luis Arce Gomez , Garcia Meza ' s interior minister , is serving a U.S. sentence for drug trafficking . Congressman Juan del Granado said dozens of other Bolivians should be tried_for crimes under the dictatorship . In Garcia Meza ' s trial , Del Granado acted_as an attorney representing Bolivia ' s labor federation and families of victims . He asked_for a second trial for 75 other people , but the Supreme Court ruled against it . When Garcia Meza returns to Bolivia , he may try to incriminate past collaborators who have turned against him , Del Granado said in an interview . &quot; I think he will want to hurt people who took_part in his government and now are with the democratic system , &quot; Del Granado said .</TEXT>
