   <HEADLINE> FRENCH OPEN ; SPANISH CONQUEST ; WOMEN : SANCHEZ VICARIO RATTLES PIERCE WITH LONG RALLIES , TRIUMPHS EASILY , 6-4 , 6-4 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About the only mistake Spain ' s Arantxa Sanchez Vicario made Sunday at Roland Garros Stadium was an innocent one . After winning the_French Open women ' s title by turning hard-hitting Mary Pierce into merely another error-prone player , Sanchez Vicario , speaking in English , thanked the Queen of Spain . She meant King Juan Carlos I , as Queen Sofia was not among the 17 # 000 at Center Court who witnessed Sanchez Vicario ' s 6-4 , 6-4 anticlimactic victory on a wind-swept day in Paris . The Queen did not arrive in Paris until the men ' s final . The Spanish will forgive her indiscretion today because they will be too busy celebrating their ascent to the top of the tennis world . For the first time , a Spanish man and woman have won the same Grand_Slam tournament . Sergi Bruguera won the men ' s title . Spain ' s firm grip on the_French Open was ensured Sunday when Sanchez Vicario defeated Pierce with defensive strokes that left her looking unsure for the first time in two weeks . &quot; I think I was more mentally strong than she was , &quot; Sanchez Vicario said . &quot; I just waited for my opportunities. &quot; And once they started coming , they came like a cascade . Pierce reached the final by losing only a record-setting 12 games in six matches . Possessing the hardest-hitting forehand in women ' s tennis , she flattened opponents with almost too_much ease . But playing for France because her mother , Yannick , is French , she looked nervous Saturday when three games were completed before the match was suspended because of rain . Pierce led , 2-1 , and was playing for a break point . When play resumed Sunday afternoon , Pierce took less than a minute to take a 3-1 lead with a backhand winner for the break . But it already was apparent she was not going_to roll past Sanchez Vicario the way she did the others in Paris . And , finally , serving for a 4-1 lead , Pierce failed to convert three game points -- each time on errors provoked by Sanchez Vicario . Unlike six opponents before , Sanchez Vicario was absolutely steadfast in_forcing Pierce into long rallies . It was a strategy that earned Sanchez Vicario her second major title . She won the 1989 French Open when she was 17 , and has finished second in three other Grand_Slam tournaments . The fifth game was a 15-minute struggle won by Sanchez Vicario when Pierce hit a backhand wide on the fourth break point . The next time she served , Pierce held_off five break points to take a 4-3 lead , but her confidence was shaken . Then Pierce , 19 , did something her coach , Nick Bollettieri , told her not to : She started to think . Instead of serving confidently , Pierce slowly bounced the ball and deliberately tossed it in the air . Inevitably her first serve was long , and one of her vital weapons was rendered useless . At one frustrating point , Pierce looked_up in the stands and said to Bollettieri and her mother , &quot; My feet are like lead. &quot; &quot; I wanted to win too_much , I was taking the game too seriously , &quot; Pierce said . &quot; Up until now I ' d just been enjoying myself . Today I was a little tense. &quot; Pierce , who entered the tournament ranked 12th but will improve to seventh when the rankings come_out this week , has overcome many obstacles -- including problems with her father , Jim -- in the past year to reach her first Grand_Slam tournament final . She and her mother filed restraining orders to keep Jim Pierce from coming_near them last winter . Pierce also was banned from tour events for disruptive behavior in the stands last year . After Mary Pierce defeated top-ranked Steffi Graf in the semifinals , security_guards were hired to protect the athlete although Jim Pierce was home_in Florida . Before Sunday , Graf or Monica Seles had won the 13 Grand_Slam events after the Australian Open in 1991 . This was only the second Grand_Slam final since the 1978 French Open in which neither Graf nor Seles , who has not competed since being stabbed in April of 1993 , played . Fans of women ' s tennis embraced Pierce as a fresh personality to join the elite players , but whether she will develop_into a powerful force is debatable . &quot; It depends_on what she wants to give of herself , &quot; Bollettieri said . &quot; She has the potential , but also a lot of unknowns . we ' ll have to see what her reaction is to having a taste of a major championship ( match ) . &quot; Notes Gigi Fernandez and Natalie Zvereva of Belarus defeated Americans Lindsay Davenport and Lisa Raymond in the women ' s doubles final , 6-2 , 6-2 .</TEXT>
