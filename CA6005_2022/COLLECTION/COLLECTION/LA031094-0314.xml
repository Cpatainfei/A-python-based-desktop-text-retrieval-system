   <HEADLINE> MANSLAUGHTER VERDICT SOUGHT IN SLAYING ; COURTS : JUDGE REDUCES MURDER_CHARGES AGAINST IRANIAN IMMIGRANT IN WIFE ' S DEATH . ATTORNEY SAYS MAN ' S CULTURAL BACKGROUND WAS A FACTOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Outlining his unique &quot; cultural defense &quot; strategy , an attorney defending an Iranian immigrant who admittedly bludgeoned his wife to death told a jury Wednesday that his client will not shirk his responsibility , but that he should be convicted only of voluntary manslaughter . Meanwhile , Van Nuys Superior_Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz dismissed first-degree murder_charges against Moosa Hanoukai in the death of his wife , Manijeh , on the night of March 20 , 1993 . Hanoukai , 55 , erupted and killed his wife after a particularly virulent fight that was laced with many curses and threats , attorney James E . Blatt said in his opening statement . &quot; An explosion occurred out of frustration , of rage , &quot; Blatt said . &quot; Mr. Hanoukai took a wrench from the kitchen and went upstairs and killed his wife , &quot; he said , providing the first details on how the woman was killed . No murder weapon was found , but a medical_examiner testified earlier this week that Manijeh Hanoukai died from blunt force trauma . Blatt made his opening statement after Deputy Dist . Atty . Kathleen M . Cady rested her case , in which she characterized the slaying as a calculated murder that arose from a domestic dispute . As Blatt spoke , Hanoukai wept , and a male juror in the six-man , six-woman panel appeared to wipe_away tears . The body of Manijeh Hanoukai , 45 , was found in the garage of the couple ' s Woodland Hills home five days after she was killed . Blatt said that after the slaying , Hanoukai realized what he had done , cleaned_up the blood and left the body in the garage after wrapping it in plastic and blankets . Hanoukai spent 25 years in a miserable marriage that was arranged by a matchmaker . For years he was forced to sleep on the floor by his domineering wife , Blatt said . Eventually , Blatt added , Hanoukai could take no more , frustrated by his wife , isolated by his inability to speak English and dejected by his life . The defense_attorney promised jurors they would hear evidence about &quot; a culture that is vastly different from yours and mine , &quot; one that is male-dominated and religious . &quot; You will be presented evidence about the stigma of a divorce , &quot; Blatt said , explaining that Hanoukai was prevented from leaving his marriage by his Iranian and Jewish backgrounds . One defense witness , another Iranian immigrant whose family owned a shop in Huntington Park next to the Hanoukai clothing_store , said Manijeh Hanoukai constantly harassed her husband , calling him &quot; stupid &quot; and an &quot; idiot &quot; in public . Hanoukai would never respond to his wife and would only look_at the ground during the woman ' s diatribes , testified Yousef Baghshyandeh . The defense won a victory when Stoltz threw_out the first-degree murder_charges . The ruling means the judge found no evidence the killing was premeditated . Hanoukai now faces one count of second-degree murder , which carries a sentence of 15 years to life in state_prison . If convicted of voluntary manslaughter -- a killing during the heat of passion and the charge recommended by Blatt -- Hanoukai would face 11 years in prison and could be paroled in less than half of that time .</TEXT>
