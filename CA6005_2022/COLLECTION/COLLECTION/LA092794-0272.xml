   <HEADLINE> THE MELDING AMERICAS ; DIPLOMACY ; END OF COLD_WAR HAS RADICALLY CHANGED U.S.-LATIN RELATIONS ; MOST HAPPY TO SEE END TO HEAVY-HANDEDNESS , BUT FEAR NEGLECT BY WASHINGTON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The new American ambassador to Nicaragua stunned observers earlier this year when he acknowledged that the history of U.S. actions in Central_America had essentially encouraged dictators and weakened national political_systems . As he met with polarized Nicaragua ' s left and right , U.S. Ambassador John Maisto also carried this new message : Solve your own problems , Nicaraguans , because the United States is staying out of the fray . Wait a minute . Was this not a representative of the same country whose government spent years and millions bolstering one heavy-handed leader -- Anastasio Somoza -- and then spent more years and more millions to topple another -- Daniel Ortega and his Sandinista colleagues ? The same country that gave us William Walker , the 19th-Century adventurer who declared himself president of Nicaragua ? The same country that , for as long as any Nicaraguan could remember , had been meddling in Nicaraguan affairs -- often at the invitation of rival Nicaraguan groups ? Nicaraguans were confused . Those who had routinely turned_to Washington for help felt abandoned . Those who had been Washington ' s enemies , like the Sandinistas , harbored skepticism . But some Nicaraguans liked what they heard and went_about the business of trying to rebuild a country wrecked by war and poverty . Maisto ' s arrival in the Managua milieu illustrates the changing relationship between Washington and Central_America and the other nations of the hemisphere , a relationship no longer painted in the simplistic colors of the Cold_War , no longer based solely on security issues . &quot; The Clinton_Administration has the opportunity to begin a new generation , a new policy and a new era in the polarizing and contradictory relations that Washington has maintained with Managua for more_than a century . . . and ( with ) the rest of Central_America , &quot; said Xabier Gorostiaga , a Jesuit priest who heads the University of Central_America in Managua . &quot; We cannot fail to take_advantage of this new attitude , &quot; he added , advocating a restructuring of U.S. economic aid to target small_farmers instead of large producers . Mexico expects to parlay the North_American Free_Trade Agreement into a lasting partnership with U.S. business . Chile hopes to gain entry into a regional trade agreement similar to Mexico ' s . And Argentina ' s quest_for closeness with the U.S government has been a cornerstone of its foreign_policy ever since the 1989 election of President Carlos Saul Menem . The relative stability of most of South_America in recent years makes_it an appealing partner for North_American officials and entrepreneurs . But nowhere has the shift in geopolitical dynamics been more dramatic than in Central_America , where the thrust of U.S. policy for the entire decade of the 1980s boiled_down to one goal : fighting communism . This meant pouring money and offering unlimited military_training to wage war against Marxist guerrillas , such_as the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front , or FMLN , of El_Salvador , and leftist governments such_as the Sandinista regime . It meant forming alliances with governments and movements for the shared , singular objective of stopping a Soviet-backed menace . It often meant ignoring or downplaying the human_rights records and corrupt practices of some of those allies , such_as the Honduran army and the Salvadoran right . The governments of Central_America that were U.S. allies became adept at enunciating the same goals , and they benefited as the aid flowed in . Today , Washington ' s relationship with Central_America is more complex . In some cases , onetime friends on the right are now Washington ' s bitter adversaries , while former foes on the left attend U.S.-financed business seminars . And in a startling reversal from previous decades , Washington has found itself sitting on the sidelines of some Central_American political disputes and elections , while Central_American governments have declined to toe the U.S. line on Haiti , at the population conference in Cairo and in other matters . Some critics of past policy say the relationship today is more healthy , more diverse . Others say it suffers from inattention and neglect . Many Central_Americans believe that , after a decade of being a focal_point of U.S. policy , the region has fallen_off the map . The once plentiful money is drying_up , and some capitals went months without U.S. ambassadors , something that would have been unthinkable in the decade of intervention . &quot; Compared to the past , relations have obviously improved , in that the United States no longer gets involved directly in the internal affairs of Central_American_countries . There is no reason to do so , &quot; said Joaquin Tacsan , an official of Costa Rica ' s Arias Foundation , a think_tank run_by former President Oscar Arias , the 1987 Nobel laureate for his regional peace-building efforts . &quot; But on the other hand , the improvements have provoked the other extreme : indifference . Central_American_countries feel they have been displaced from the eyes of the world. &quot; The Central_American_countries that emerged from the 1980s are , generally speaking , more democratic than they were 10 years ago . Opposition parties are able to participate in politics without a high physical risk . The wars have ended in El_Salvador and Nicaragua , and may soon end in Guatemala . But with some exceptions , the countries are also poorer than ever and are faced with huge , costly tasks of reconciliation and reconstruction . The elite continue to enjoy impunity , and justice systems remain flawed . With U.S. economic aid slashed to a fraction of its previous levels , many Central_Americans are now looking_to the United States for investors and partners in trade . Governments are pursuing free-market policies , which promote economic_growth and appeal_to U.S. business , but can plunge the poor deeper into poverty . Also receiving U.S. attention , albeit on a secondary level , is the building of democratic institutions . A new civilian police_force in El_Salvador is largely financed and trained by Americans . And some governments , notably those of El_Salvador and Guatemala , have pleaded for a more lenient U.S. immigration policy . More_than a_million Salvadorans fled north during the last decade , and the money they send home keeps the Salvadoran economy afloat . Large-scale deportations would spell disaster . In the more_than two years since a U.N.-sponsored peace process ended the Salvadoran civil_war , the Salvadoran government has had to adjust to a new Washington agenda with different kinds of strings attached . There is less money to go_around , and the former rebels , who laid_down their weapons and formed a political_party , are receiving a share of it -- much to the chagrin of the United States ' former allies on the right . Through a U.S.-funded land bank , for example , former rebels have been given seed money to start coffee cooperatives and other agricultural projects . Some on the right and in the military , who became accustomed to preferential treatment as long as they presented a unified front against communism , feel left_out and have become born-again patriots . &quot; Strangely , the American Administration today forgets that the FMLN was its true enemy , &quot; said Kirio Waldo Salgado , one of El_Salvador ' s most vocal commentators on the far right . Another sign of changing dynamics came_with El_Salvador ' s presidential election in April . For the first time in recent memory , the U.S._government did not back anyone in the contest , which pitted a candidate from the ruling right against one who had the support of the former guerrillas . The left ' s candidate , former legislator Ruben Zamora , lost . But during the campaign he frequently marveled at the lunch invitations that he , once an outcast , was receiving from the U.S. Embassy . &quot; The crux of the discussion between the United States and Latin_America is no longer communism and anti-communism , leftist and rightist , &quot; Zamora said . &quot; These things are increasingly irrelevant . The crux today is something else -- it ' s free_trade ( and ) the capacity of political groups to guarantee stability inside the countries &quot; of Latin_America . Nevertheless , leftists in El_Salvador and Guatemala continue to protest when U.S. troops arrive to build roads and bridges . Many see an ulterior motive to the rapprochement , believing U.S. officials are currying favor with moderate leftists , hoping to isolate the more extreme elements . And in Nicaragua -- despite Ambassador Maisto ' s upbeat approach -- the years of mistrust have not been completely erased . The U.S. Senate , largely at the behest of Jesse Helms , continues to periodically threaten to cut_off aid to Nicaragua because of disputes over property confiscated during Sandinista rule . And officials in President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro ' s government are resentful of what they see as the failure of the United States to come_through with promised postwar aid . As they prepare_for the Summit of the Americas with President Clinton in Miami in December , Central_American leaders are going_over their wish lists . Most agree that the summit should concentrate_on economic issues : strengthening commercial ties , expanding markets for Central_American textiles and foods , limiting quotas on key exports such_as bananas and sugar and devising a plan of sustainable development . But among the Central_American_countries , in contrast to neighbors in South_America , there is little agreement . Each government seems bent_on defending the interests of its own tiny economy , analysts say . That discord threatens to undermine any effort by Central_America to emerge as a trading bloc .</TEXT>
