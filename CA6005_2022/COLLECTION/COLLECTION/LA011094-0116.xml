   <HEADLINE> STRUGGLING TO STAY TOGETHER ; ACTIVISM : GROUPS FORMED AFTER CHILD KIDNAPINGS AND MURDERS FREQUENTLY FADE AWAY AFTER A_FEW YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They are born in tragedy and nurtured on grief , frustration and anger . Their names are a roll_call of children who have disappeared or died at the hands of strangers : the Kevin Collins Foundation , the Heidi Search Center , the Adam Walsh Center , the Jacob Wetterling Foundation , the Amber Foundation -- and now the Polly Klaas Foundation . In the past decade , more_than a_hundred such organizations have sprouted up in the wake of highly publicized child kidnapings and murders , and they are perhaps the most prolific of the so-called victims ' rights groups . More are created every year as other children -- an estimated 3 # 200 to 4 # 600 yearly -- become victims of kidnaping by strangers . All the groups start_out in much the same way : a child disappears , and scores or hundreds or even thousands of volunteers turn_out to help in the search . Because of the circumstances of the kidnaping or just plain luck , the case attracts extensive local , regional or -- as with the Klaas case -- national media attention . Sometimes the child is never found ; sometimes the child is found dead . In the aftermath , the parents or the volunteers form a nonprofit group to try to &quot; do something &quot; about child abductions . &quot; There ' s so_much intensity put into a search that there has to be an outlet for it , &quot; says Rick Benningfield , operations director for the Heidi Search Center in San Antonio , Tex. , a &quot; child find &quot; group named after 11-year-old Heidi Seeman , kidnaped in San Antonio in August , 1990 , and later found dead . &quot; Even after the body is found , it ' s emotionally difficult to call_off the search . Then you look_around and you see that there ' s a need for an organization to help deal with the problem . So you keep going. &quot; &quot; Most of these organizations are formed out of personal loss , &quot; says Judi Sadowsky , executive_director of L.A.-based Find the Children , a missing child assistance center founded in 1983 . &quot; When a child is missing , the frustration is so great that parents and families often feel the emotional need to get involved in starting an organization . Usually these are ordinary people who ' ve been thrust into an extraordinary situation . Some can rise to it , and some can ' t. &quot; Most of the groups fade_away after a_couple_of years . Although no one keeps track of all_the child victim organizations nationwide , people in the field estimate that at least half the groups formed in the wake of a child disappearance in the past 10 years have closed their doors as the money dried_up and volunteers moved_on . Others remain as not much more_than numbers for phones that may or may_not be answered . Even the groups that survive find that usually there comes a time when the attention -- and thus the money and volunteers -- shifts to another tragedy involving a kidnaped child . &quot; A lot of it depends_on how committed the parents and the volunteers are to continuing the work , &quot; says Julie Cartwright of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Arlington , Va. , a national clearinghouse for information and programs involving missing children . &quot; It takes all your time , and all your emotional energy , and every new case ( of a kidnaped child ) reopens the wound . Often it ' s difficult to keep_up the momentum. &quot; Still , some groups manage to continue long after the tragedy that created them . Gary French , president of the fledgling Polly Klaas Foundation , is certain that his organization will be one of them . * It ' s been just more_than a month since the body of 12-year-old Polly Klaas was found , nine weeks after she was abducted from a pajama party at her home_in Petaluma near San Francisco . But the emotional adrenaline of the case lingers . At the Polly Klaas Foundation , a 6 # 000-square-foot office in a shopping_center across the street from the Petaluma police_station , the phones still ring off_the_hook , hundreds of volunteers still put_in long hours , donations still pour in -- as much as $ 500 # 000 so far . The foundation board of directors , which includes Polly ' s parents , is formulating plans for legislative and educational_programs to &quot; make America safe for children. &quot; The national media still call . &quot; It ' s not going_to taper_off , &quot; French , 48 , says confidently . &quot; Of all those other ( child victim ) organizations that came_before , none has had the national and international visibility that we have had . It gives us capabilities that they simply didn ' t have. &quot; There have been some stumbles . The first head of the foundation resigned after it was disclosed that he had been convicted of a sex crime involving minors in 1967 . Also , members of other child find groups , a number of whom assisted in the Polly search , say privately that the unprecedented media attention in the Klaas case has created arrogance among some Klaas Foundation organizers . &quot; They ' re walking around acting like a bunch of movie_stars , &quot; says the director of one long-established missing child foundation , who declined to be quoted by name . &quot; I don ' t know about arrogance on our part , &quot; French responds . &quot; I know we ' re aware of the tremendous power and influence we have . . . . As far as all_of it going_to our heads , what ' s gone_to our heads is the ability to make significant changes to benefit every kid , and every missing kid , in this country . that ' s what we want to do. &quot; Despite the criticism , the Klaas Foundation organizers believe that their group will not only survive but prosper . They believe that it may even surpass in scope the most successful of the child victim organizations , the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center in Florida , which has three other regional branches , including one in Orange County . ( The group is named after 6-year-old Adam Walsh , who was abducted and murdered in Florida in 1981 ; the case became the basis for the 1983 TV film &quot; Adam. &quot; ) In 10 years , French predicts , &quot; I think we could be one of the premier providers of services to children in this country. &quot; * As a man committed to saving children , 54-year-old David Collins wishes the Polly Klaas Foundation well -- in fact , he spent many hours as a volunteer during the search for Polly . But he also knows that there almost certainly will come a time when the phones at the Polly Klaas Center won ' t ring as often , a time when the group may have to fight for funding , a time when they may be begging the national media for interviews instead of the other way around . Collins knows because he ' s been there . Next month will mark 10 years since Collins ' son , 10-year-old Kevin Collins , was abducted from a street_corner near Golden Gate Park in San Francisco . In the beginning , it was much the same as the Klaas case . Within a week almost a_thousand volunteers had showed_up to help in the search ; the search center , situated in space donated by a local church , was frantic with activity . Kevin ' s face was_on the cover of Newsweek magazine . Donations poured in . Other parents of missing children started calling , and within a_few months , Collins had set_up the Kevin Collins Foundation for Missing Children , dedicated to preventing &quot; stranger abductions &quot; of children ( as opposed to the far more prevalent &quot; family abductions &quot; of children by a non-custody parent ) . Kevin was never found . Now , a decade later , the Kevin Collins Foundation operates out of a 3 # 000-square-foot &quot; boiler room &quot; in the San Francisco Tenderloin District . About five volunteers continue to help on a weekly basis . The foundation ' s annual budget , about $ 95 # 000 , is a little more_than half what it once was . Collins , the foundation president , earns about $ 11 # 000 a year as the group ' s only paid staff_member . One of the group ' s most recent statewide media exposures was a wire_service report that the foundation was closing its doors -- a report denied by Collins . &quot; I ' m tired , but I ' m not dejected , &quot; says Collins , who is resigned to the idea that his son is probably dead . &quot; ( The foundation is ) going_to be here until we ' re not needed any more. &quot; The group has accomplished a great_deal . It has offered support to scores of parents of missing children ; sent response teams to assist in numerous child disappearances ; distributed millions of flyers of missing children -- Kevin included -- and pushed for laws to aggressively track and more severely punish child_molesters . Still , Collins admits that sometimes it is difficult to keep_up the momentum , both in raising funds and in attracting volunteers -- not only for his group but for others in the same situation . &quot; I ' ve seen all kinds of groups spring_up in the past 10 years and then a year later they ' re gone , &quot; Collins says . &quot; Sometimes it ' s hard to keep going. &quot; * &quot; Money ' s the real problem , &quot; says Kim Swartz , 36 , of the Amber Foundation for Missing Children in Pinole , Calif . &quot; I can ' t tell you how many times we ' ve sat_up at night thinking , ' Are we going_to have to close our doors tomorrow ? ' Fortunately , it seems like a miracle always happens and we keep going. &quot; Swartz is the mother of Amber Swartz , an 8-year-old girl kidnaped in Pinole in June , 1988 . She has not been seen since . For Swartz , whose police_officer husband was killed in the line_of_duty while she was pregnant with Amber , the child ' s disappearance , and trying to keep the foundation alive , has been an emotional roller_coaster . &quot; For days and days after ( Amber ' s disappearance ) , there were crowds of volunteers at the command center , &quot; Swartz recalls . &quot; There were just hundreds of people , and you ' re at the center of it . Your whole life becomes an open book , and sometimes you just want to be somebody else . &quot; It brings_out all kinds of people , the good and the bad . I got calls from people who would tell me what they were doing to my daughter right at that moment . The vast majority of the volunteers were wonderful , caring people , but some strange people show_up on your doorstep. &quot; The Amber Foundation , which assists in child search operations and distributes missing child information , operates with a small , $ 25 # 000 annual budget and a core_group of about a dozen volunteers . There are no paid staff_members . Swartz also is working to create the American Missing and Exploited Children Organization , an umbrella association for missing child foundations like hers . &quot; There ' s got_to be a way for us to all work together , &quot; Swartz says . &quot; The way it is now , every time a child is missing and people want to organize a group , you wind_up reinventing the wheel. &quot; * &quot; There ' s a high rate of burnout , &quot; says Patty Wetterling , 44 , a founder and board_member of the Jacob Wetterling Foundation . &quot; You don ' t have a very high success rate in terms of finding a child , so it ' s easy to become discouraged . And if another child is kidnaped , many of those caring people who volunteer move_on to that one. &quot; It ' s been more_than four years since Wetterling ' s then-11-year-old son , Jacob , was kidnaped by an armed , masked man half a mile from Jerry and Patty Wetterling ' s home_in St . Joseph , Minn. , a small_town of 3 # 000 about 85 miles northwest of Minneapolis-St . Paul . Despite a $ 200 # 000 reward , the efforts of hundreds of volunteers , the distribution of hundreds of thousands of flyers bearing Jacob ' s picture and a lot of national media attention , he has not been seen since . Today , the foundation , which emphasizes education to prevent child abductions and has fought for a national convicted child_molester registration act , has an annual budget of about $ 188 # 000 , a full-time staff of three -- including Patty Wetterling , who is not paid -- and a core of about 20 volunteers . &quot; I would encourage parents ( of missing children ) to get involved in the issue , but I ' m not sure I would encourage parents to start a foundation , &quot; Wetterling says . &quot; It ' s very difficult , emotionally and organizationally. &quot; Nevertheless , she adds , &quot; I do gain some strength from working to help other children . It gives me a way to put energy into something positive . &quot; And I never give_up hope that Jacob will be found. &quot;</TEXT>
