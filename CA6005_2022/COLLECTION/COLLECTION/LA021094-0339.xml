   <HEADLINE> GIRLFRIEND OF SINGER RICK JAMES GETS SENTENCE REDUCED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A judge has reduced from four years to two the prison sentence imposed on the girlfriend of funk singer Rick James for assaulting a woman during a drug party in West Hollywood . Van Nuys Superior_Court Judge Michael R . Hoff said he reluctantly reduced the term because James himself , although he had been found guilty of more serious offenses than his girlfriend , probably will be released this fall following treatment in a drug rehabilitation_program . James ' light sentence and the reduction in the term of Tanya Anne Hijazi , 23 , come_in the wake of an investigation into what sources close to the case said are allegations of misconduct by an investigator in the district_attorney ' s office . The investigator was not assigned to the James case but he is under scrutiny because he allegedly had provided drugs to one of the witnesses who testified against the singer . James , best known for the 1981 hit &quot; Super Freak , &quot; was convicted Sept . 17 of assaulting and imprisoning Mary Sauger , 35 , at the St . James Club &amp; Hotel on the Sunset Strip in 1992 . James was acquitted on several charges , although the jury deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of a guilty verdict on six other charges , including torture . Hijazi pleaded guilty to assault on the day she and James were to go_on trial and was sentenced to four years in prison . In exchange for her plea , prosecutors dropped a dozen other charges that carried a potential life sentence . As part of a sentencing deal that sent him to a drug treatment program instead of prison , James also pleaded guilty to assaulting a second woman at his Hollywood Hills home_in 1991 . Prosecutors , saying they had a case fraught with difficulties and that the two victims did not want to testify again , agreed to the sentencing deal under which James is expected to be freed this year -- even though he faced the possibility of life in prison if he were convicted in a second trial on charges the jury was unable to resolve . Leonard B . Levine , Hijazi ' s attorney , said that under the new sentence , he hopes to see her released in August . The judge sentenced James last month to five years and four months in prison , but the term was stayed when he was admitted to the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco . If James successfully completes the 8 1 / 2-month treatment program , he will be released on parole . Hoff said recent events in the case have shown him &quot; the best of times and the worst of times. &quot; &quot; I ' m very troubled by this entire case , and in particular the recent events which have brought us here , &quot; Hoff said . The district_attorney is probing the possibility that an investigator provided drugs to Michelle Allen , one of three women who testified against James , according to sources close to the case . Allen , who was in custody on theft charges and was not named as a victim , testified to bolster the prosecution ' s contention that James chronically abused women . Hoff said he was also disappointed that a gag order he issued to protect the investigation has been violated , leading to news accounts of the alleged misconduct . The judge made_it clear that the prosecutor in the case , Deputy Dist . Atty . Andrew Flier , acted with a &quot; high degree of personal integrity and honesty &quot; and in no way was accused of misconduct . Although the case has now been tainted by the investigation , Hoff reminded everyone that in &quot; the simplest terms , this case is about cocaine , abuse and assaultive behavior toward women. &quot; Defense_attorney Levine characterized Hijazi as a victim who also received beatings from James . &quot; I ' m glad that she ' s not going_to be incarcerated longer than Rick , &quot; said Hijazi ' s mother , Susanne Shapiro . &quot; I think the judge was very fair , &quot; she said . &quot; It gives me a little more faith in the criminal justice system. &quot;</TEXT>
