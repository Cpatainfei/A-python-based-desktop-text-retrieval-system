   <TEXT> Pete Tafoya , an outspoken board_member of the Ventura County Community_College District , has announced his bid for reelection . A former community_college student and community_college instructor , Tafoya , 45 , said his objective for a second term as a trustee is to better manage the district ' s increasingly strained financial resources . &quot; One of the most critical things we have to do is to keep whatever resources we do have directed toward the classroom , &quot; Tafoya said Monday . Tafoya has often clashed with some of the district ' s more conservative board_members . He voted against endorsing a controversial ballot initiative that would have provided public funds for private_schools through a voucher program , which a majority of the board supported . He also advocated lowering fees for foreign students , while other board_members voted to raise them . A resident of Port Hueneme , Tafoya will run_for the Area 5 seat , which represents the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme , and the El Rio area . He works as an engineering manager for the Navy . He studied at College of the Sequoias in Visalia before graduating from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a bachelor ' s degree in engineering .
