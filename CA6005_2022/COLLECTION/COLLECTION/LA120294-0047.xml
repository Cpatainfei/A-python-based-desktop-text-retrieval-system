   <HEADLINE> CYBURBIA : THE GOODS ; TRAVEL PLANNERS DO THE THINKING FOR YOU</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Let ' s get_in the car , take a vacation and get_away from the computer for awhile . Not so fast . First , you ' ve got_to figure_out how to get_to wherever you ' re going , and the faithful computer you ' re going to leave_behind can help find the best route , calculate the mileage , draw a map , suggest motels for overnight stops and even point_out attractions to see along the way . The software used to pull_off these tricks are travel planners , of which four are commonly available for the Windows platform ( none are currently available , as far as could be determined , for Macintosh ) . To test them , we devised an imaginary car trip from Los Angeles to Los Alamos , N.M. , with a side trip to Las Vegas . All four programs -- the &quot; AAA Trip Planner &quot; on CD-ROM , &quot; AutoMap &quot; on floppy_disks , &quot; Map ' n ' Go &quot; on CD-ROM and the &quot; Rand McNally TripMaker &quot; on floppies -- work basically the same way . They allow you to type in your starting point , destination and any side trips you wish to take . Then you get a variety of options , usually allowing you to choose between the quickest and shortest of routes ( the shortest is sometimes not the quickest because of the type of highways you ' ll be using ) and the average speeds at which you plan on driving ( if you aim high , allow extra_time for conversations with highway patrol officers ) . Then the program goes_to work , planning your itinerary . Not surprisingly , the quickest routes planned by the four programs were similar . The shortest in total mileage was &quot; Map ' n ' Go , &quot; which came_up with a grand total of 929 miles . &quot; AutoMap &quot; was the highest with 953 miles . The estimated driving times ranged from 15 hours and 39 minutes to 19 hours and 3 minutes , with the differences due mostly to each program setting its own speed rates . The driving-time estimate is for reference only , anyway , because you will be stopping along the way for meals , bathroom breaks and hopefully on a trip this long , a sleep-over . None of the four programs say exactly where they start in Los Angeles , but all use either the Harbor or Hollywood freeways ( or both ) to get you to Interstate 10 and eastward toward Interstate 15 and the well-known route to Las Vegas . The differences in the itineraries start showing_up on the less-traveled route south from Vegas to highways leading to Arizona and finally to Los Alamos , but again the variations in route are generally minor . The real differences between these programs are in the printouts you take with you and in what they offer in suggestions for sightseeing along the way . The clear favorite is &quot; Map ' n ' Go &quot; from DeLorme Mapping , a pioneer and still a leader in the electronic mapping field . A printout from this program gives you a detailed itinerary , in map form , showing the changes in highways you take along the way and at what mileages . The &quot; Map ' n ' Go &quot; printout for our sample trip ran to 16 pages ( don ' t expect to do the printout just before you get_into the car -- it will take a little time , especially if you ' re using a color printer ) . Stapled together , it made a neat package that was easy to follow , page by page . After planning the itinerary , you can ask &quot; Map ' n ' Go &quot; to show you a list of points of interest along the way . With an adjustable gauge set to show us sites 10 miles or less off the planned route , the program came_up with 64 sites . Then , it launched into a narrated slide show . This was the least useful , but perhaps the most amusing part of the program , as &quot; Map ' n ' Go &quot; showed us Forest Lawn Memorial Park , the Roy Rogers &amp; Dale Evans Museum , the pyramid-shaped Luxor hotel in Las Vegas , Hoover_Dam and the Bradbury Science_Museum in Los Alamos , which a friend refers to as the &quot; our-friend-the-bomb &quot; museum . The narration is of the uncritical &quot; land of many contrasts &quot; variety , telling us , for example , that at the Roy Rogers museum we can see &quot; horse stars Buttermilk and Trigger , and Bullet , the dog. &quot; It does not mention that the opportunity to see these famous movie animals is brought_to us through the miracle of taxidermy . &quot; Map ' n ' Go &quot; costs about $ 40 through mail_order or in software shops . The other programs , all_of which give you a printed itinerary of some type , cost about $ 40 for the AAA CD-ROM to about $ 50 for &quot; AutoMap. &quot;</TEXT>
