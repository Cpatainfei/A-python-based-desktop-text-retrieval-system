   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 : 28 DAYS AND COUNTING ; GERMANY ' S BIG DOG ; VOGTS , NICKNAMED TERRIER , WAS A TOUGH PLAYER , AND NOW AS COACH , HE SOMETIMES CAN BE A TERROR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1958 , a diminutive winger named Mario Zagalo , sometimes known as &quot; the Little Ant &quot; by his teammates and fans , helped Brazil win its first World Cup , in Sweden . Hans-Hubert Vogts turned 12 that year . It was also the year his mother died . In 1962 , Zagalo and Brazil repeated their triumph by again winning the World Cup , this time in Chile . Berti Vogts , who turned 16 that year , was beginning to show considerable promise as a player in the small West German town of Buettgen , near Duesseldorf on the lower Rhine . It was the year after his father died . In 1966 , West Germany , with Franz Beckenbauer , finished second to England in the World Cup . That was the year after Vogts had been signed as a professional by Borussia Moenchengladbach , the only club he would play for . In 1970 , Zagalo , now known as &quot; Lobo , &quot; or &quot; Wolf , &quot; coached Brazil to its third and perhaps greatest World Cup triumph , in Mexico . Zagalo became the first man to have both played for and coached World Cup-winning teams . Vogts was_on the West German team that year , along with Beckenbauer , but the Germans lost to Italy in overtime in the semifinals . In 1974 , Vogts and Beckenbauer combined to lead West Germany to its second World Cup victory , exactly 20 years after the first . In 1990 , in Italy , West Germany won again , with Beckenbauer as coach and Vogts as his assistant . Beckenbauer joined Zagalo ' s club , becoming the second man to have won the World Cup both as a player and as a coach . And now , with the 1994 World Cup less than a month away , there is the chance that Vogts can join them . He is Germany ' s coach , having taken_over from Beckenbauer immediately after the victory over Argentina in the final of Italia ' 90 . Zagalo is Brazil ' s assistant coach , in_line for an unprecedented fourth World Cup title . Both teams are strong favorites to reach the championship game at the Rose Bowl on July 17 . But neither honors nor statistics tell the real story of Berti Vogts , the shoemaker ' s son who became one of the most successful players and respected coaches in the world . Born in Buettgen on Dec . 30 , 1946 , Vogts went_to live with his aunt after his father ' s death . She managed a restaurant owned by the local soccer club . That was that . Vogts ' career was determined . He completed his apprenticeship as a toolmaker , but soccer captured and held him . At 18 , he was signed by Moenchengladbach . He ended_up playing 419 games for the club , scoring 33 goals and helping it win the German Bundesliga championship five times , the German Cup once and the UEFA Cup twice . Vogts was chosen as the league ' s player of the year in 1975 and again in 1979 . His career with the West German national team was equally impressive . Nicknamed &quot; the Terrier &quot; because of his , well , dogged personality , Vogts was a relentless tackler . He would chase and harry opposing forwards nonstop for 90 minutes . Occasionally , like Beckenbauer , he would move_into the attack himself , but more often than not he was back near his own penalty area , guarding the goal . Such was his tenacity that Kevin Keegan , a former England captain and Europe ' s player of the year in 1978 and 1979 , once said , &quot; A team of 11 Berti Vogtses would be unbeatable. &quot; Vogts played 96 matches for West Germany , including appearances in the 1970 , ' 74 and ' 78 World Cup tournaments . He retired in 1979 to become coach of West Germany ' s national youth team , a position he held until becoming national coach in 1990 . Almost all_of Germany ' s players in World Cup ' 94 were coached as youngsters by Vogts . Since taking_over from Beckenbauer , Vogts has kept Germany at the top of the world ' s game , although losing the 1992 European Championship final to Denmark and other occasional setbacks have earned him intense criticism in the German press . If the other 23 World Cup ' 94 coaches think they are under pressure , they might consider this : Every one of Vogts ' predecessors -- Sepp Herberger , Helmut Schoen , Jupp Derwall and Beckenbauer -- won either the World Cup , the European Championship or both . Vogts is expected to win in 1994 . Nothing less will do . But pressure does not trouble him . He shrugs_off the media criticism and goes_about his job of building a German team capable of taking_on the world . The thought_of failure does not cross his mind . &quot; I know we will play positive , attacking , winning soccer , &quot; he said on the eve of the European Championship in Sweden two years ago . &quot; We have great potential among the players . Even if we lose some games , after giving our all , we will not be hurt by that . The public understands that a team cannot always win . &quot; As long as my family life is good , I can take a lot of pressure. &quot; Now , with only weeks to go before Germany plays Bolivia , Spain and South_Korea in the first round of World Cup ' 94 , Vogts is saying much the same thing . &quot; We shall be very difficult to beat if we all concentrate fully on playing football , &quot; he recently told London ' s World Soccer magazine . &quot; I am not that arrogant to claim that we are the world ' s best . For me , the Brazilians are the top_dogs and World Cup favorites . We remain among the leading five , but we know we must improve. &quot; At 47 , Vogts is speaking out more often on matters that affect not only the German team but the sport as_a_whole . He surprised many soccer followers not long ago by coming_out in favor of what would seem to be drastic rule changes . For instance , he favors each team having one timeout per half to give coaches the chance to talk to their players . &quot; I think they would be good for the game , &quot; Vogts said . &quot; It would give the coach more chance to have an influence on the game and , in my opinion , it would make the game much better. &quot; Similarly , when England earlier this year canceled a game against Germany in Berlin , citing fears of violence from English hooligans and German neo-Nazis , Vogts angrily blasted the decision . &quot; This isn ' t a question for sport , &quot; he said . &quot; The politicians have clearly failed here . I ' m very disappointed . If you ( politicians ) can ' t guarantee the safety of the German team and its foreign guests , then you have no right to get annoyed about Germany ' s bad image abroad. &quot; Vogts is an unabashed admirer of the United States . His success has caused some in Germany to call him &quot; Berti Rockefeller , &quot; but Vogts dismisses the intended insult . &quot; I am not a multimillionaire , &quot; he said three years ago . &quot; But one thing that I do have in common with Rockefeller is that we are both hard-working people. &quot; In the same interview , Vogts explained his feeling for America . &quot; I love it , &quot; he said . &quot; It is the only country besides Germany where I would want to live . America is where one is awarded success in return for hard work . It is a country of possibilities. &quot; He also believes World Cup ' 94 will be a success on and off the field . &quot; I have to pay a great compliment to the Americans as far as the structure and organization of the tournament is concerned and as far as the atmosphere in the stadia is concerned , &quot; he said in an April interview with Reuters . &quot; People who think it will not run smoothly are being unfair to the Americans . I have been in five different venues recently and looked_at problems like training pitches and security . We have everything there . They are offering us everything . &quot; There is certainly going_to be a real_World Cup atmosphere . We should maybe have some of it ourselves ( in Europe ) . Sometimes the atmosphere in our stadia is great , but sometimes it is too aggressive . &quot; The American support is more friendly . You don ' t play in a cage . There are only all-seated stadia without a fence . This good atmosphere comes_over ( to the players ) and that is great. &quot; Since those remarks , three of the nine World Cup ' 94 venues -- Dallas , where Germany plays once , Washington and Palo Alto -- have decided to install fencing to separate the fans from the field . Sometimes seen as cold and aloof , Vogts has a good_sense of humor but is equally capable of anger . Last year , for example , he lashed_out at his players after a_couple_of less-than-satisfactory performances . &quot; I made a big mistake in the past by assuming that every player would show their own initiative , and I didn ' t put any pressure on them , &quot; he said . &quot; It must be the biggest thing in your career to put_on a German shirt. &quot; And on Thursday as the team arrived in training camp in Malente in northern Germany , he lashed_out at three players -- defender Thomas Berthold , rising midfield star Mario Basler and forward Ulf Kirsten -- for their conduct in_league play . &quot; I ' m going_to have to talk to all three of them privately , &quot; Vogts said . &quot; I can ' t accept such behavior. &quot; He also brought_in World Cup referee Hellmut Krug to reinforce his message . He will accept nothing but the best . That is the way it was for Vogts , and in World Cup ' 94 he is not about to allow his players to believe or act any differently . After all , a World Cup is at stake and &quot; Terrier Vogts &quot; is not about to let it escape .
