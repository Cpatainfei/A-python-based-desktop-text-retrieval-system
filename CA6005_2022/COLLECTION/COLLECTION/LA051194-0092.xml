   <HEADLINE> PREP TENNIS / SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFF DRAW ; EDISON AGAIN FINDS ITSELF IN A DIFFICULT SPOT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Still on a high from a Sunset League championship and a 15-4 season , Edison High boys ' tennis_Coach Tim Ball answered his office phone Tuesday with a cheery , &quot; Hello , this is Tim. &quot; But when Ball heard that his first-round opponent next Tuesday in the Southern Section Division I team playoffs would be Woodbridge , his spirits quickly sank . &quot; Oh , no , &quot; Ball said , &quot; we played them in the second round last year . How in the heck could that happen ? &quot; Just bad_luck , apparently . Woodbridge is a third-place team , but the Warriors are 15-5 and play in the Sea View League , one of the section ' s more powerful leagues . They are ranked seventh in Orange County , Edison is ninth . Last year , Edison was beaten by Woodbridge in the second round , 14-4 . &quot; I was hoping to do_better than the second round this year , but it ' s going_to be tough , &quot; Ball said . &quot; We do have a lot better team and more depth this year , but I don ' t know how we ' re going to do against Woodbridge. &quot; If the Chargers upset Woodbridge , they would play third-seeded Dana Hills , which is undefeated in 19 matches , and ranked second in the county . &quot; We ' re going to do our best , &quot; Ball said . &quot; My goodness , there ' s no breaks , is there ? That ' ll teach us for winning our league. &quot; University , the second-seeded Sea View team and fifth-ranked team in the county , didn ' t get a great draw either . The Trojans will play Century League-champion Foothill ( 19-1 ) , ranked fourth in the county . Corona del Mar , the Sea View League champion , is seeded fourth and opens by playing host to Lakewood ( 12-7 ) , the third-seeded team from the Moore League . Sunny Hills ( 17-1 ) , the county ' s top-ranked team , was given the top seeding in Division II and will play the West Torrance-Downey Warren winner on Tuesday .
