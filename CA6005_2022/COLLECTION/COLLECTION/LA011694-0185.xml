   <HEADLINE> INTERNET CAN BE BLESSING OR CURSE FOR RESEARCHERS -- IT ' S HIGHLY ADDICTIVE ; ACADEME : CLUSTERS OF LARGE COMPUTERS LINKED TO HIGH-SPEED LONG-DISTANCE PHONE_LINES ARE RADICALLY CHANGING THE WAY PROFESSORS AND STUDENTS WORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When E.J. Crane , 28 , a postdoctoral fellow at Bowman Gray Medical_School in North Carolina , wants to know how fast a particular enzyme reaction occurs , he can calculate it on his Macintosh computer . But that would take 24 hours . Instead , Crane uses the Mac to sign onto the international collection of computer_networks known as the Internet and hook_up_with a more powerful computer at a hospital in Winston-Salem , N.C. On it , he can perform the same calculation in a minute -- using a program made available on Internet by Washington University in St . Louis . At other times , Crane signs onto Internet to send messages to his brother in Minnesota , discuss ideas with other biochemists across the country and copy three-dimensional images of protein_molecules from a national database in Upton , N.Y. The Internet -- clusters of large computers linked to high-speed long-distance phone_lines -- is radically changing the way professors and students carry_out their missions . By making all kinds of information available to anyone with an Internet account , the network has begun to blur the differences between big universities -- with their big computers and big libraries -- and smaller institutions . The computer links also encourage long-distance collaboration , allowing isolated scholars and academic newcomers to tap into the collective wisdom in their fields . Internet users say titles , sex , race and other distinctions fade , because on Internet , everyone is just an address . &quot; It ' s a great leveler , &quot; said University of Richmond professor Elizabeth Gruner . &quot; Anyone can ask anything . . . and anyone can respond. &quot; But universal , round-the-clock access makes Internet a mixed blessing . Highly addictive , it encourages users to spend hours communicating via computer with distant friends and colleagues rather than with the person down the hall . Many users , under the guise of participating in academic discussions , spend hours reading and responding to obvious , repetitive inquiries . Internet often encourages scholars to ask_for help rather than carry_out their own research , and some professors are worried that it will devalue individual accomplishment and encourage intellectual laziness . &quot; My initial optimism in this technology has faded considerably , &quot; said Robert Jay , art_department chairman at the University of Hawaii . &quot; Green graduate_students . . . now seem to believe they can ask the rest of the ( people on the network ) to do the most basic bibliographic research for them. &quot; Some are concerned that Internet ' s capacity for transferring large files at no cost may encourage the proliferation of low-quality electronic journals that publish papers rejected by more established publications . For better or worse , however , Internet has embedded itself in academic life . Consider these developments : * Trotter Hardy , a law professor at the College of William and Mary , has organized two academic conferences entirely on Internet . For each , he chose a topic -- one was the impact of electronic_mail on teaching law -- and invited as_many as 25 people to participate . They exchanged electronic messages for three weeks , then Hardy compiled and sent_out a transcript , entirely on Internet . For professors without time or travel money , such conferences help compensate for a lack of mobility . * Harvard_University ' s government_department has created a special Internet file to help its job-hunting graduate_students . With a quick Internet query , recruiters at other universities can get copies of the students ' resumes , their published articles and sections of their dissertations . &quot; I know of three cases where recruiters learned of our students from our ( Internet ) service and invited them to apply before the positions were officially announced , &quot; said government professor Gary King , who set_up the system . * When Solveig C . Robinson , a University of Chicago graduate_student , stalled in her research into &quot; Shafts , &quot; an obscure 19th-Century publication , she posted a query on &quot; Victoria , &quot; a list of about 600 scholars interested in the period . &quot; Within 48 hours , I had a_couple_of responses that put me in touch with a woman from Texas who had done some work_on ' Shafts ' . . . and we pooled our notes , &quot; Robinson said . &quot; Since she hadn ' t yet published anything , there was really no other way for me to know about her. &quot; * Rochester Institute of Technology mathematician Stanislaw P . Radziszowski has spent 3 1 / 2 years working_on complex logic problems with an Australian colleague , one of only a_few mathematicians who had the necessary expertise in algorithms and computer_programs . The pair , who are in the forefront of programming computers to do formal reasoning , have met in_person only three times and talked on the phone perhaps four times , but they communicate via electronic_mail three or four times a day . Without Internet , &quot; our joint work would have been rather impossible , &quot; Radziszowski said . &quot; Our computers very often work simultaneously on the same problem . . . . They use the same data , and we check each other ' s results by computers. &quot; * Many universities offer courses to long-distance learners on Internet . Students carry_on class discussions , work_on group projects and submit their papers entirely on-line . In the last two or three years , Internet has become ubiquitous in the academic community : Although non-academics usually pay_for access , most universities offer free accounts to students , faculty and staff_members . Many academics now turn first to e-mail and Internet instead of the telephone when they need to reach someone . Scholars simply type up a message of any length , address it , push the send button and whoosh , the electronic letter goes_out on the information highway . The next time the recipient signs_on , the message will be there , waiting to be read .</TEXT>
