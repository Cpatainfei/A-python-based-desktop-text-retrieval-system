   <HEADLINE> POLITICIAN WATCH ; PENSIONS PLUS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors will have the chance today to modify -- although not , unfortunately , eliminate -- one of the more flagrant taxpayer rip-offs in recent memory . Three years ago then-Chief Administrative Officer Richard B . Dixon initiated , and the supervisors oh-so-quietly approved , a plan to permit the cost of benefits to be treated as compensation when calculating county pensions.Thus benefits such_as medical and dental insurance and -- for supervisors and others lucky enough to have them -- car allowances now count as salary when determining pensions . That sweetener will boost taxpayer costs by as much as $ 400 million over the next 30 years . Supervisor Gloria Molina , who was not a member of the board when the pension-spiking scheme was adopted , says that it ' s costing about $ 300 # 000 a week to fund this particular goody . She ' s supporting recommendations made by the Economy and Efficiency Commission to control the plan ' s abuses . Among other things , benefit costs would be excluded when figuring pensions for future employees and the dollar amount allowed_for current employees would be cut or frozen . All this is of course worth doing . Regrettably it won ' t roll back the windfalls that pension spiking already has made_possible . One non-elected official will retire next month , for example , with an annual pension about $ 35 # 000 higher than his current salary . This program is a scandal . It will be a far greater one if the supervisors don ' t act today to curb it . Taxpaying voters are waiting and watching .</TEXT>
