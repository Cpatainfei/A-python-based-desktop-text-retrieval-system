   <TEXT> The assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio confronts President Carlos Salinas de Gortari with the possibility of forging a major democratic breakthrough out of tragedy . A new presidential candidate must be named by the Institutional Revolutionary Party -- the PRI . The choice is expected to be the president ' s . But he could instead take this opportunity to open the selection process to a larger_number of voices in the party and in Mexican society . If the outcome is the selection of a candidate who can be a true unifying force , an effective promoter of Mexico ' s transition to full democracy as well as a guarantor of continuity in the country ' s recent economic reforms , what happened in Tijuana on Wednesday could be transformed from a senseless act of violence to the final catalyst -- after Chiapas -- for a great national renewal . It is widely known that , within the PRI , Colosio ' s candidacy for the presidency was backed most fervently by elements opposed to deeper political reforms that would make elections much more competitive and thus threaten their continued hold_on power . Colosio ' s designation as PRI ' s nominee was seen as a major defeat for the &quot; reform &quot; wing of the party , closely identified with Manuel Camacho Solis -- former Mexico_City mayor , one of the leading presidential hopefuls and , since early January , Salinas ' unpaid envoy to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the Chiapas rebellion . In sharp contrast to the die-hard , anti-reform elements who seemed to surround him , Colosio on many occasions spoke privately about the need to restructure his party , to reduce its dependence on corrupt labor and peasant organizations and community-level political_bosses -- precisely the perpetrators of vote fraud , human-rights abuses and economic exploitation who made Chiapas fertile ground for the insurrection that finally erupted on Jan . 1 . Publicly , in accepting the PRI ' s presidential nomination , Colosio urged his party to reject &quot; one single vote &quot; that was obtained through means &quot; outside the law. &quot; We will never know now how far Colosio , as president , would have gone_to discipline leaders of_his_own party who refused to play by new rules of democratic competition that are demanded by increasingly large portions of the Mexican population . Like his chief political mentor , outgoing President Salinas , Colosio may have been unwilling to take the political risks , including a Japanese-style split of the ruling party , that translating his reformist rhetoric into reality would have posed . The conservative forces within the PRI / government apparatus are poised to take_advantage of the situation created by Colosio ' s untimely removal from the presidential race . They will insist on a tightly controlled selection of their version of a &quot; national unity &quot; candidate to replace Colosio , someone who can be counted_upon to keep the opposition parties &quot; in_line , &quot; and who can reliably deliver to party apparatchiks the public offices and material perks to which they have long been accustomed . They will appeal_to the Mexican public ' s deeply ingrained conservative impulses : their fear of uncontrolled political violence , their thirst for &quot; order &quot; and their belief that strong presidential rule , virtually unchecked by legislative or judicial authority , is necessary to keep the economy growing and the government running smoothly . If these reactionary elements prevail , the outlook is for persistent election-related turmoil , if not violence , with all_the negative consequences for investor confidence and advances in social well-being that come_with an environment of high political conflict and uncertainty . Mexican political culture has changed in the last six years . This is illustrated by the wave of popular protests unrelated to the rebellion in Chiapas that have erupted in many parts of the country since Jan . 1 . Among the protesters ' demands : the removal of corrupt municipal officials , repeal of increases in public_transport fares , the liberation of &quot; political_prisoners &quot; arrested for dissident union activities and improvements in low-income housing . Any attempt to keep the lid tightly on this caldron of social unrest and rapidly rising expectations for greater democracy is likely to fail . On the very eve of Colosio ' s death , the Mexican Congress was approving some of the most significant reforms in electoral laws and procedures that have ever been proposed by the government and the opposition parties . Still other changes that would further equalize the terms of competition and safeguard the integrity of the entire voting process may be enacted when the Congress resumes its debate , including a more active role for foreign &quot; visitors &quot; ( not officially recognized observers ) in monitoring elections . The most fitting tribute to Luis Donaldo Colosio would be the swift and unswerving implementation of these changes , backed_up by a serious effort to cleanse the PRI ' s own practices and to ensure that those who represent the party , at every level , are committed to the kind of election that Colosio knew he could win in 1994 .</TEXT>
