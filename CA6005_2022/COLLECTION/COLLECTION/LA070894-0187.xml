   <TEXT> As_many as 100 # 000 needy Orange County children eligible for free , federally funded lunches are not taking_advantage of the program this summer , a situation officials are trying to correct by stepping_up publicity and signing_on more agencies to distribute the meals . U.S. Department_of_Agriculture officials said Thursday that they hope to improve last year ' s performance , when fewer than 8 % of the eligible county children received free meals , but acknowledged that progress will be measured in small gains . Statistics for this year ' s program , which began in late June , are not yet available . &quot; What we ' ve been hearing so far this summer is that participation has gone_up slightly , &quot; said Dick Montoya , a spokesman for the Agriculture_Department ' s Food and Nutrition Service Division . &quot; But there are still a lot of children that aren ' t being served. &quot; Last summer , just 9 # 316 children in Orange County received hot meals each day under the Summer Food Service_Program , although more_than 122 # 733 were needy , according to officials with the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture . Poor participation has been a problem not only in Orange County , but also throughout the country , where just 16 % of children entitled to free meals receive them . Children ' s advocates and federal_officials blame the low numbers on a shortage of local agencies willing to sponsor the program and poor publicity for the program in the past . However , Agriculture_Department officials say stepped-up outreach efforts have helped to get the word out and attract sponsors . In Orange County for instance , there were no sponsors for the program three years ago , Agriculture_Department officials said . This year , there are 15 sponsoring agencies . &quot; Three years ago , I couldn ' t crack Orange County , &quot; said Cleophus Davis , regional program manager for the Summer Food Service_Program . &quot; But now the program is definitely growing. &quot; A major reason is that the Orange County Community Development Council ( CDC ) has received two grants totaling $ 25 # 000 a year to pay_for an outreach staff person to promote the program . Annette Jewell , the CDC ' s summer food program outreach coordinator , said more_than 70 sites in Orange County currently offer free lunches that range from pizza to chicken and include milk and fruit . Some also offer breakfast . The meals , similar to free and reduced-price lunches offered in schools during the rest of the year , may be the most nutritious food some children eat all day , officials said . Jewell said there is no doubt that children who do not take_advantage of the meals program are suffering . &quot; I ' m told by principals that children returning from school vacations often have visible weight loss , come_back tired and are disinterested and lethargic from not having anything to eat , &quot; Jewell said . The Summer Food Service_Program serves about 2 million low-income children nationwide . Begun in 1968 , the program did not become readily available in Orange County until 1991 , USDA officials said . The lunch sites are run_by local agencies such_as schools , churches and parks and recreation facilities , which are reimbursed by the Agriculture_Department based upon the numbers of meals that they provide . The average reimbursement runs about $ 2.25 per meal . Under Agriculture_Department guidelines , sites must be established in neighborhoods where half the families earn no more_than $ 26 # 548 for a family of four . According to USDA figures , Orange County received $ 772 # 031 in federal funds last summer for the program ; San Diego received $ 710 # 255 . The amount spent in Los Angeles County was not available . One of the largest Orange County programs is at the Oak View School in Huntington Beach , where more_than 1 # 000 breakfasts and lunches are served daily . &quot; The response has been overwhelming , &quot; said coordinator Kathy Conner . &quot; We ' re just about at our max. &quot; On Thursday , students were treated to thin-crust sausage_pizza , fresh fruit , orange shakes and milk . Today ' s lunch will be roasted chicken thigh served with applesauce and milk . Anyone from 6 months to 18 years old is entitled to a meal . All food must be eaten_on the premises . Food program officials stressed Thursday that children are not required to furnish identification proving citizenship . &quot; Some parents may think they have to register or show some type of identification , &quot; Jewell said . &quot; But our only concern is feeding children. &quot; More information about food service_programs can be obtained by calling ( 800 ) 328-6476 .
