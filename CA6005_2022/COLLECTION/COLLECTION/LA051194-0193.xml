   <HEADLINE> SEVERAL CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNING COUNCIL REBUFF ARAFAT ; MIDEAST : PLO LEADER MUST NAME 24 MEMBERS OF AUTHORITY THAT WILL PRESIDE IN GAZA AND JERICHO . BUT KEY PALESTINIANS VIEW TASK AS POLITICAL SUICIDE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even as the first contingent of Palestinian police crossed into the Gaza Strip on Tuesday , the Palestine Liberation Organization faced a crisis in naming its new Palestinian Authority , which will preside over autonomy in Gaza and Jericho until elections this fall . Key PLO officials say PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat has been repeatedly rebuffed by Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories as he tries to set_up the 24-member governing council . &quot; People are depressed , and it seems that the end of the problem will not come soon , &quot; an Arafat adviser said Tuesday . &quot; Until now , many people are refusing. &quot; Over the weekend , the PLO Executive Committee was unable to come_up with a list of names for the new government and postponed a decision until after Arafat ' s trip to South_Africa for the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela . But with Arafat ' s scheduled return here today , there is still no certainty he will find the leaders he needs for the council . A growing number of Palestinian leaders view the authority , which will be only temporary and subject_to Arafat ' s whims , as a ticket to political suicide , or worse . &quot; It seems that nobody is accepting to be used for three months , &quot; one PLO official said . &quot; It could be the end of your reputation -- and maybe your life. &quot; Key leaders from the occupied territories -- such_as Faisal Husseini , Ghassan Khatib and Saeb Erekat -- have all refused posts on the authority , which is to be headed by Arafat and draw 60 % of its members from inside the territories . On Monday , Arafat is said to have phoned Gaza Strip Palestinian leader Zakaria Agha from South_Africa to urge him to join the council . Agha , a PLO official here said , told Arafat , &quot; Until now , it ' s not clear what my responsibility , my power , will be. &quot; The official noted : &quot; People see this as just nominating names with no clear idea of the future , and there is no support , no investment . Arafat is having big troubles. &quot; Another PLO official said that , as matters now stand , it appears that even the next executive committee_meeting after Arafat ' s return &quot; will not be successful. &quot; Arafat was able to persuade Agha , Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij and Gaza Bar Assn . chief Freij abu Midan to sign_on to the authority , according to reports Tuesday from the occupied territories . The first contingent of the Palestinian police , 148 men in olive-drab uniforms and green_berets , crossed into the Gaza Strip from Egypt on Tuesday afternoon . But the group was held at immigration for hours by Israeli security officials , for identity checks and luggage searches . &quot; We are letting 9 # 000 terrorists , retrained and armed to be policemen , into Gaza and the West_Bank , &quot; an Israeli army_officer said , explaining the delay . &quot; Is it any wonder we are rather careful about who is who and what he is bringing ? &quot; Arafat , interviewed by Israel Television in South_Africa , exploded with anger over the delay when asked whether he had not asked_for a slowdown in the hand-over because the PLO was not ready . &quot; Who asked_for the delay ? &quot; he snapped_at the interviewer . &quot; Our security_forces are there . We have not asked_for the delay -- not one hour , not one day . Who can ask_for a delay in returning to his homeland ? &quot; The lengthy processing deprived the policemen of the popular welcome Gazans had planned . For the third day , thousands of people had gathered outside the Rafah border post to greet the police , all members of the Palestine Liberation Army , and thousands more lined the roads , standing around campfires until well past midnight . More Palestinian police are expected to enter the West_Bank town of Jericho as well as Gaza today . Israeli troops handed_over the first of the Gaza bases they will transfer to the Palestine police . &quot; This is a historic day for the Palestinian people because this will be the first day on_the_road to independence , &quot; said Maj . Gen . Nasser Yousef , commander of the Palestinian police . Despite the slow start , plans still call_for 6 # 000 police to be deployed by May 25 . But PLO leaders say Israel has told them that no substantial action on admitting the officers will occur until the Palestinian Authority is named . And even after the officers enter , they say , Israel has said they must remain in camps in Gaza until Israel completes its withdrawal from the new autonomous zones . The delay in naming the new governing council reflects both factional disputes and growing challenges to Arafat ' s single-handed leadership style that have plagued the PLO for months . But it is also a sign of the general confusion in Tunis as the PLO prepares to take_on the greatest challenge in its history : the transition to governing its own people . There are widespread preparations in PLO departments all_over Tunis to shift operations to the autonomous areas . But the PLO also appears to be planning to rely_on the existing Israeli-created civil administration -- which is already in place in Gaza and Jericho -- more_than preparing detailed proposals to take_on responsibilities in areas such_as housing , electricity , schools and health_care . &quot; They ' re having problems with organization . They haven ' t got everything figured_out , &quot; said one Western diplomat monitoring the transition . &quot; They were leading us to believe all along that as soon as the agreement was signed , they were ready to go_in . This is clearly not the case. &quot; Another observer noted : &quot; Despite the fact they ' ve had this time , they ( the PLO ) clearly are not organized . They ' ve got the expertise on the ground in the territories , they ' ve got expertise in the diaspora . But here in Tunis , where they should have experts on the ground working , they haven ' t. &quot; Further , there is surprisingly little confidence that the PLO is up_to assuming the difficult task of ensuring security in the turbulent Gaza Strip once its police are allowed to enter and deploy . Some PLO officials here complain privately that the two men chosen to head the police_force in the territories have backgrounds as commandos , not police_officers . &quot; Is that the kind of experience you want when you are trying to keep things calm ? &quot; one official asked . &quot; What will happen the first time they have to enter one of the camps to arrest a wanted suspect ? The whole camp will be against them ! And they will be seen in the streets as Israeli collaborators. &quot; These concerns have been widely expressed in the international community and in Israel ; that they now are echoed here at PLO headquarters testifies to the immensity of the job ahead for this organization . Still , there is a momentum for peace here -- for pushing_forward with the job ahead at all costs -- that is born of the feeling that there is no alternative . &quot; There will be problems , but there will not be civil_war , &quot; said one Arafat adviser . &quot; We are eager to be in our land . We were obliged to be out , we are all educated , we are open-minded , we have the practice of living_together , and , somehow , we will do it. &quot; Times staff writer Michael Parks in Rafah , Gaza Strip , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
