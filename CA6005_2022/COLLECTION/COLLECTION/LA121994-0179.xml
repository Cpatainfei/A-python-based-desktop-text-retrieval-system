   <HEADLINE> CHECHNYA SHUNS MOSCOW ' S TERMS FOR PEACE TALKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Russian warplanes and artillery pounded the perimeter of his capital , the president of the rebellious republic of Chechnya said Sunday that he is willing to resume peace talks with Moscow -- but only on his besieged home ground . His condition kept the conflict at an impasse . Speaking_to reporters in the flag-draped bunker beneath his presidential headquarters , Gen . Dzhokar M . Dudayev declared that he is not a lackey &quot; who will go anywhere at the wiggle of a finger. &quot; Russian forces have been bombarding scattered points in Chechnya off and on since thousands of troops moved_into the breakaway region Dec . 11 , but Dudayev turned_down flat a proposal that he venture out of Chechnya to meet a Kremlin emissary in the southern Russian city of Mozdok , 60 miles away . Instead , Dudayev said in a terse telegram dispatched to Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin on Sunday evening , &quot; I am prepared to receive your authorized representatives &quot; in Grozny , the Chechen capital . Dudayev made no pretense of softening his stance on Chechnya ' s demand for independence and said , &quot; Relations with Russia amount to a state of war. &quot; A Yeltsin spokesman , Yuri Leonov , said Dudayev ' s message &quot; did not answer &quot; the president ' s proposal . &quot; There will be no more answers to Dudayev ' s telegrams , &quot; he added . The latest fruitless exchange over peace talks , which collapsed Wednesday , came amid some of the heaviest bombing yet in Chechnya , an oil-rich republic of 1.2 million people in the northern Caucasus Mountains . One bomb hit an electric_power station , blacking_out part of the capital . Planes roared over Grozny minutes after a Russian ultimatum to the Muslim Chechens to lay_down their arms expired at midnight Saturday . Dudayev said Russian bombs and artillery hit dozens of places just outside the city , including the republic ' s television transmission center . &quot; The fire is aimed at military targets , but shells hit civilian houses , &quot; said Sergei Kovalyov , one of five Russian lawmakers who came_to Grozny to protest the war . &quot; I have seen destroyed civilian houses and dead_bodies of civilians with my own eyes. &quot; Neither he nor any other official gave casualty figures among the Chechens . Four more Russian soldiers were reported killed Sunday , raising the total to 20 in the 8-day-old operation . Russian authorities said they were hitting ammunition depots , Chechen troop concentrations and other strategic targets . They claimed to have struck five bridges_over the Terek River , although no one here was able to find any that were damaged . In the Staropromyshlovsky district on the edge of Grozny , there did not seem to be anything even remotely strategic about the food warehouse where watchman Magomed Murtazov was jolted awake by a missile attack at 5:30 a.m. The attack left a crater outside his shack five feet wide and his kitchen dishes covered in crumbled plaster and rubble . &quot; They thought this was a military base , &quot; he said , shrugging . A few blocks away , women and children from areas pounded heavily by artillery in recent days huddled in the claustrophobic confines of an aging bomb_shelter . Unheated but warmed by the clammy breaths of its unhappy inhabitants , the shelter gets so full at night that there is barely room to sit , the women said . &quot; They just want to destroy , &quot; said Ruslan Ushmanov , commander of a nearby Chechen fighter base that may have been the target of the missile . Ushmanov said he didn ' t think the Russians were necessarily aiming at him . &quot; They want to destroy houses , &quot; he said . &quot; They just want to destroy everything we have . . . . These are psychological attacks . They keep us expecting them at any moment. &quot; If the tension of unpredictable attacks was meant to break_down the Chechens ' defiance , it appeared to be having the opposite effect among the shelter ' s inhabitants . Lubov Mutsayeva , a 68-year-old woman still recovering from a recent operation , vowed that if only the Russians would stop their aerial bombing and try to take Chechnya by land , &quot; I swear by Allah , I will bite them through the throat with my teeth . &quot; Our hot Chechen blood is like Gypsy blood , &quot; she said . &quot; One of our boys can kill 500 of theirs. &quot; Other Russian strikes fell on cowsheds in the village of Petropavlovskaya near Grozny . What would seem to be the most obvious target of the Russian bombing , the nine-story presidential headquarters from which Dudayev runs the republic , remained untouched . The former Soviet bomber pilot , who spent Saturday night in the building , said Yeltsin was afraid to attack him , because if he did , &quot; then I ' d have the right to bomb the Kremlin. &quot; &quot; We avenge ourselves , &quot; Dudayev said . &quot; We ' re patient . One day , two , three , a year passes , but vengeance is inevitable. &quot; The Chechens are known as a fierce people with a penchant for organized_crime and a powerful tradition of clans and blood_feuds . They have battled the Russians since the 18th Century . In 1991 , Dudayev came_to power and declared Chechnya ' s independence , beginning a new cycle of conflict with the Kremlin . On-and-off negotiations between Moscow and Grozny have repeatedly broken down , and the Kremlin resorted_to covertly supporting a Chechen opposition group that tried to storm Grozny last month and failed miserably , leaving tanks and weapons to Dudayev ' s victorious forces . Dudayev claimed Sunday that suicide soldiers have disabled 12 Russian tanks by throwing themselves beneath them and setting_off grenades . Despite the Chechens ' spirited resistance , some military specialists said they expected a ground assault aimed at seizing control of Grozny -- if only to avoid a demoralizing retreat by the Russian army from Chechnya and possibly the entire Caucasus region . Russian officials emphasized that no such order had been given . &quot; The city will be stormed , and soon , &quot; predicted Pavel Felgengauer , the well-informed defense correspondent of the Moscow newspaper Sevodnya . &quot; Of course , they will try to act with a scalpel and not with an ax . High-precision weapons will be used. &quot; Sergei A . Filatov , Yeltsin ' s chief_of_staff , warned reporters in Moscow not to expect a sweeping advance . &quot; I would like to avoid words like storming , assault and combat operations , &quot; he said . &quot; What we are talking_about is the suppression of gun_emplacements , spots of resistance , military hardware depots . This is not a war . This can be called special operations. &quot; Guarded by more_than two_dozen soldiers spread along the hallways that lead to his bunker , Dudayev looked relatively fresh for a man who had spent the previous night anticipating an attack -- and was still expecting one . He spoke in measured , dramatic tones . His jutting cheekbones , dark eyes and trimmed mustache gave him the look of a movie actor of the 1920s , but his words flirted_with the bounds of sanity . He accused Russia of &quot; blasphemy , cynicism , vandalism and barbarism &quot; and warned that &quot; if this policy of satanism continues , Russia will condemn itself to its own death. &quot; Times staff writer Richard Boudreaux contributed to this report from Moscow .</TEXT>
