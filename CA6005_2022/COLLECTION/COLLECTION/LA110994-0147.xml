   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; ON-LINE PROVIDERS TAKE_AIM AT MICROSOFT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With their firms ' share prices slipping_on worries about Microsoft ' s upcoming on-line service , executives of two of the nation ' s leading on-line service providers took_aim at the software company Tuesday over its ambitions to become a player in their business , suggesting it would be an unfair competitor . America Online shares fell $ 6.75 , or 9.3 % , to $ 66.25 Monday in heavy Nasdaq trading , and shares of H &amp; R Block , which owns CompuServe , fell $ 1.25 , or 2.9 % , to $ 42.375 on the New York Stock_Exchange . &quot; It ' s because of Marvel , &quot; said Keith Benjamin , analyst at Robertson Stephens . Marvel is the code name of the on-line service Microsoft , the world ' s largest personal_computer software company , is developing . Until now , Microsoft officials would not officially confirm that the company would introduce such a service , but the Redmond , Wash.-based firm said its chairman and chief_executive , Bill Gates , will unveil its on-line strategy at the big Comdex computer show in Las Vegas next week . Speaking at a conference in New York on the future of electronic commerce , executives from America Online and CompuServe said they are concerned that Microsoft may include an on-line service directly in its soon-to-be-released Windows 95 operating system . That would enable a computer user to hook into Microsoft ' s service with a click of a mouse . To access America Online or CompuServe , by contrast , users have to load_up a separate program . &quot; The ( Windows ) Operating System is almost like what dial tone is to the phone industry , &quot; said Steve Case , America Online ' s chief_executive . He argued that just as consumers who pick_up a phone automatically get a phone_company ' s signal , Microsoft ' s huge installed base means that anybody who signs_on to a computer will be_on its &quot; line. &quot; Phone firms have been regulated to assure access to other telecommunications concerns , Case said , and in the computer field , &quot; there needs to be a_level playing_field on which companies can compete. &quot; Case said Microsoft should be free to market a stand-alone on-line service that competes with existing services but that such a service must remain distinct from Windows 95 . He noted that the Justice_Department has raised concerns about the antitrust implications of Microsoft ' s acquisition of Intuit Inc. He said America Online is watching to see how regulators will act . Said Tim Oren , CompuServe ' s technology vice_president , who was also at the conference : &quot; We welcome the competition as long as the playing_field is level and we ' re not dealing with cross-subsidies. &quot; In a cross-subsidy , a company sells a product at less than market_value by supporting it with resources from other units . The executives expressed concern about the entry of not only Microsoft , but also the potential for phone_companies , specifically AT &amp; T Corp. , to join the competition .</TEXT>
