   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN FINANCIAL UPHEAVAL ; THE PESO -- PROFIT AND PAIN ; BUSINESS IMPACT : FOREIGN INVESTMENTS , CONFIDENCE IN COUNTRY ' S ECONOMY SHAKEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Mexican fiscal crisis has eroded the value of dozens of U.S. mutual_funds and prompted American firms to re-evaluate their investment plans , undermining international confidence in Mexico ' s economy less than a year after the signing of a free-trade pact that brought high hopes for a new era of prosperity . A wide range of foreign investors -- ranging from corporate giants such_as Ford Motor Co . and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to individual mutual_fund investors -- have been shaken by the surprising devaluation of the Mexican_peso , which has dropped more_than 30 % in value against the U.S. dollar in only two days . &quot; There is no longer the trust &quot; in the Mexican market , said Carlos J . Valderrama , who advises U.S. and Mexican firms on partnerships and business_deals . &quot; Some clients who were planning to invest in Mexico indicated to me that they will hold_off for a while. &quot; On Thursday , the peso continued to plummet after the Mexican government said it will no longer control the value of the currency , instead allowing it to float freely against the dollar . Because of fears that the devaluation might damage the Mexican economy , the turmoil in currency trading quickly spread to the Mexican stock_market , where foreigners own an estimated $ 50.4 billion worth of shares -- or 26 % of the total market . Though the Mexican stock_market rose Thursday , the falling peso translated into continued losses for American investors . In U.S. financial markets , the shares of Mexican firms suffered , as did the stocks of American companies heavily involved in Mexico and Latin_America . Telefonos de Mexico ' s American depositary receipts fell $ 4.25 to $ 40.75 , Citicorp was down $ 2 to $ 41.25 , Coca-Cola dropped $ 1.25 to $ 51.125 and Colgate-Palmolive fell $ 1.375 to $ 61.75. Several U.S. mutual_funds with substantial Mexican and Latin_American holdings have lost nearly 10 % of their value since the crisis began . &quot; The surprise ( devaluation ) has resulted in a very large loss of confidence in the government , &quot; said William Truscott , portfolio manager of the Scudder Latin_America Fund , which has lost about 8 % of its value in two days . As a result , investors will probably focus more on Brazil or Argentina next year . &quot; Our outlook has certainly changed on Mexico , and it ' s changed to the negative , &quot; he said . The peso ' s fall from grace is being closely tracked by U.S. and Mexican firms that have expanded into each other ' s markets to take_advantage of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , which lifted many trade_barriers . The weaker peso will make exporting to Mexico more expensive and reduce the value of investments in that nation . Wal-Mart , the nation ' s largest retailer , might delay the opening of some Sam ' s Clubs and Super Centers in Mexico should the devaluation lead to inflation or possibly a recession , said J.J. Fitzsimmons , vice_president of finance for the company . &quot; If the consumer economy is weak , it will clearly affect our business down there , &quot; said Fitzsimmons , whose firm already operates 33 stores in Mexico in partnership with Cifra , a giant Mexican retailer , and plans to open another 25 in 1995 . &quot; But we will not cancel any project that we have started. &quot; Meanwhile , the much-heralded benefits of NAFTA to many U.S. firms have been undercut . Increased exports of U.S. products to Mexico under the trade pact have been credited with creating thousands of American jobs , but now those products -- cars , for example -- will be far less competitive in Mexico . The devaluation will erase some of the gains Ford had expected in exporting an estimated 25 # 000 U.S.- and Canadian-made vehicles a year to Mexico . Previously , those cars had been made in an inefficient Ford factory near Mexico_City , where all Ford cars sold in Mexico were manufactured under laws abolished when the free-trade pact was enacted . Now the peso has fallen and &quot; those cars will be more expensive , &quot; Ford spokesman Al Chambers said . &quot; This is disruptive. &quot; John Labatt Ltd. , a Canadian brewery , said its 22 % stake in Mexican brewer Femsa Cerveza had dropped nearly $ 148 million in value since the financial crisis began . The Toronto-based company had just bought the stake for $ 510 million in September . But the effect on U.S. firms will not necessarily be bad . In Palm Desert , Richard J . Heckmann , president of U.S. Filter Corp. , which manufactures water treatment plants , spent Thursday morning reassuring some employees worried about the fate of a small but fast-growing number of Mexican projects . &quot; I ' m just telling them it ' s business as usual , &quot; Heckmann said . His firm does not take_out any profits from Mexico and its contracts can be adjusted to take currency fluctuations into account . In fact , Heckmann said , his firm stands to benefit because it buys supplies in Mexico with U.S. dollars , which have gained purchasing power . &quot; This would be the time to buy equipment , and this is the time to sign contracts if they are dollar-denominated , &quot; Heckmann said .
