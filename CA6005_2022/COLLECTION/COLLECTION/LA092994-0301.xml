   <HEADLINE> GRAND_JURY REVIEWING CASE AGAINST FAMALARO ; CRIME : HUBER AUTOPSY REPORTS NO OBVIOUS SIGNS OF SEXUAL ABUSE BUT FLUIDS ARE COLLECTED FOR FURTHER TESTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the Orange County Grand_Jury reviews evidence against a handyman charged with murdering Denise Huber , an initial autopsy report released Wednesday said there were no obvious signs of sexual abuse . But the autopsy noted that bodily_fluids were collected for testing to determine more conclusively whether Huber may been sexually assaulted , a finding that could be a key factor_in either prosecuting or defending the case . John J . Famalaro , 37 , is accused of kidnaping and bludgeoning the 23-year-old waitress in June , 1991 , after her car broke_down on a local freeway less than two miles from her home . Her nude , handcuffed body was discovered in July inside a running freezer at Famalaro ' s home_in Prescott , Ariz . Forensic testing is being performed by Orange County ' s crime lab , but local law_enforcement officials have refused to reveal any results , fearing a local version of the O.J. Simpson case , where details about new evidence are being leaked almost daily . The grand_jury has begun reviewing the latest evidence in the case and law_enforcement sources say an indictment could come_by week ' s end , allowing prosecutors to circumvent a public hearing process in their case against the former Lake Forest resident . The 17-page autopsy report released in Phoenix by the Maricopa County medical_examiner ' s office said Huber suffered at least 14 blows to the head and a fractured nose . The report indicated that the time of Huber ' s death cannot be pinpointed because of the condition of the body . Authorities suspected the murder weapon was a claw_hammer or a nail puller -- objects that appeared to carry bloodstains and were found in Famalaro ' s cluttered home . A forensic anthropologist hired to reconstruct Huber ' s smashed skull to help determine what caused the blows concluded the nail puller was the more &quot; probable &quot; of the two suspected weapons , the report said . The report said &quot; clear frozen fluid &quot; was taken from the vagina and &quot; clear liquid &quot; collected from the rectum for testing . Aside from severe injuries to the head , there are no other signs of inflicted injuries , the report states . Famalaro , who is being held without bail in Orange County , has pleaded not_guilty to the charges . He could face the death_penalty if convicted . Prosecutors handling the case did not return repeated phone_calls for comment Wednesday . But witnesses called so far by the grand_jury include a Lake Forest woman who was formerly engaged to Famalaro and told police he once tried to forcibly handcuff her during a fight . &quot; I was there , that ' s all I can say , &quot; said Nancy L . Gowan , who added she testified before the panel on Tuesday . A spokeswoman for the Yavapai County Sheriff ' s Department said Wednesday that the lead investigator and two others who handled the Huber murder investigation had traveled_to Orange County and were expected to return to Arizona today . &quot; It ' s my understanding they are there for the grand_jury , &quot; said spokeswoman Laurie Berra . Famalaro has easily become one of Orange County ' s most notorious murder_suspects in the wake of his arrest in July , when Huber ' s frozen remains were discovered in a freezer kept inside a stolen rental truck parked in Famalaro ' s driveway . An electrical cord ran from the freezer to Famalaro ' s house , where authorities found the dead woman ' s clothing in a box marked &quot; Christmas &quot; and yellowed newspaper_clippings about her disappearance . Arizona officials were prosecuting Famalaro for the murder until local authorities traced Huber ' s blood to a Laguna Hills storage facility where Famalaro was illegally living at the time of the killing . Huber was coming_home from a rock_concert in the early morning hours of June 3 , 1991 , when her tire blew_out along the Corona del Mar Freeway . Officials now believe Famalaro kidnaped Huber and killed her in the storage facility . He purchased the freezer days after Huber ' s disappearance , records show . The sexual_assault issue is a key one for both sides . Proof could bolster the prosecution ' s death_penalty case or help the defense eliminate a possible motive or assist a theory that the killing was not premeditated . Defense_attorneys have refused to discuss their strategies in the case . In at least one way , however , the case has followed in the shadow of the Simpson trial . In June , the supervising judge of the Los Angeles Superior_Court alluded to the media attention surrounding the Huber case when he ended the grand_jury ' s review of the prosecution ' s case against Simpson . Deputy Public_Defender Leonard Gumlia on Monday asked Orange County Superior_Court Judge Michael Brenner to question grand jurors whether publicity surrounding the Huber case has tainted their ability to fairly review evidence in the case . Gumlia said Wednesday he was recently notified by Orange County prosecutors that a grand_jury review could be imminent but said as a defense_attorney he is not privy to the working of the grand_jury . &quot; It doesn ' t surprise me in any way , &quot; said Gumlia , who said he also presented Brenner with dozens of pages of newspaper_clippings about the Huber case . &quot; We presume that it ( a grand_jury review ) is going on. &quot; Gumlia has already stated his intention to seek a change of venue for his client because he has doubts that Famalaro can receive a fair trial in Orange County . Huber became a household name after her disappearance , as her frantic parents and law_enforcement officials launched a high-profile search for her whereabouts . Famalaro is being held_in protective custody in the Orange County Central Men ' s Jail after becoming the subject of death threats .</TEXT>
