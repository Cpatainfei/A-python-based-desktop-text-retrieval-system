   <HEADLINE> PALESTINIAN CONTROL WIDENS IN WEST_BANK ; MIDEAST : ISRAEL RELINQUISHES SCHOOLS , HEALTH_CARE AND SOCIAL_SERVICES . WHO WILL PAY FOR THEM IS STILL A PROBLEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel formally transferred control of schools , health_care and social_services in the occupied West_Bank to the new Palestinian Authority on Monday , but neither Israelis nor Palestinians were sure how the 3-month-old administration will pay_for them . Although a significant step toward ending Israel ' s 27-year occupation of the West_Bank , the transfer of power highlighted the Palestinians ' dependence on international economic assistance if plans for increasing Palestinian self-government and the overall peace agreement itself are to succeed . To get the money needed , Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization said they will jointly approach Western donors at a meeting scheduled for Sept . 8-10 in Paris to seek $ 30 million to cover an expected deficit in a budget of $ 54.5 million for the next six months . The PLO also will be seeking further allocations to administer the Gaza Strip from the $ 4.6 billion it has been promised in international assistance . The donors meeting is now shaping_up as crucial for the PLO and for Fatah , its major faction . Popular support for Fatah , the political base of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat , has declined in the past three months because of the Palestinian Authority ' s slow start after it took_over the Gaza Strip and West_Bank town of Jericho from Israeli forces . &quot; People are growing impatient , we need to deliver and money is the key -- it determines our ability to meet the people ' s expectations , &quot; Nabil Shaath , the Palestinian planning minister , said after signing the accord . &quot; This agreement is an important step toward full autonomy , but it must be underwritten through international assistance. &quot; But Palestinian authorities on Monday postponed for the third time a meeting that could free $ 400 million or more in development aid because Arafat is too busy with other duties to attend the session , planned for today in Cairo . The Palestine Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development said the meeting was scheduled in_order to hire a firm to oversee the multimillion-dollar development of the West_Bank and Gaza Strip , meeting World_Bank requirements for project supervision and thus freeing $ 400 million to $ 500 million in aid . The meeting will now probably be conducted after the Paris conference of Western donor countries . Arafat ' s presence is not necessary , but he had said he wanted to participate in the discussion . The previous meetings were canceled , first , because a decision had not been made on which firm to hire , then because there was not a quorum of council_members . Under the agreement signed with the PLO on Monday , Israel is transferring control over education , health_care , welfare services , taxation and tourism throughout the West_Bank to the Palestinian Authority as a step toward the extension of full autonomy there . Israel captured the West_Bank and Gaza during the 1967 Mideast War . Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres described the move as a historic event , fulfilling terms of the peace agreement signed a year ago . &quot; For the first time in history , Palestinians will be able to educate their own children in their own language and in their own tradition -- something that has never happened under the_British or the Turks or the Jordanians ( or ) anybody else , &quot; Peres said . Palestinians assumed immediate control of the school_system -- Monday was the first day of class -- and they will assume jurisdiction in the other areas once Western assistance is assured . The Palestinian Authority took_control of the Gaza Strip and of Jericho in May . These five areas make_up about 60 % of the West_Bank budget , but 33 other departments will remain part of the Israeli military government until agreements are reached later this year for their transfer . &quot; The key question is funds , &quot; an Israeli negotiator said . &quot; The Palestinians have the authority to collect the taxes necessary to finance education , medical services and so on , but they do not yet have a full tax_system and the personnel to administer it . They will need at least six months before their tax_collections are sufficient . Thus , the need for aid. &quot; The signing Monday was delayed for more_than two hours as Shaath protested Israel ' s rejection of a Palestinian request to allow a Pakistani diplomat to enter the Gaza Strip on Sunday to prepare_for a visit there by Prime_Minister Benazir Bhutto . The diplomat was kept waiting for nine hours at the Egyptian border , still controlled by Israeli forces , before being turned_away . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin later admonished Bhutto to &quot; learn some manners , &quot; saying that Pakistan had refused to coordinate her visit with Israel . Bhutto then canceled the visit , planned for next Sunday . Predominantly Muslim Pakistan does not recognize the Jewish state , but some Israeli foreign-policy analysts thought Bhutto ' s visit could bring the Islamic world a step closer to approving the agreement with the PLO and accepting Israel ' s existence . Under the autonomy accord , Israel remains in_charge of foreign relations and border crossings into the autonomy zones . The agreement also stipulates that guests from countries without diplomatic relations with Israel &quot; shall be required to obtain a special visitor ' s permit to be issued by the Palestinian Authority and cleared by Israel. &quot; Rabin showed his anger during a news_conference , saying , &quot; You do not declare in the media , ' I ' m going_to come_to Gaza , and I ' m not willing to see any Israeli. ' We have no problem that the lady from Pakistan or her representative will visit , but they have to apply in an orderly fashion , &quot; Rabin said . &quot; I suggest the lady from Pakistan learn some manners. &quot;</TEXT>
