   <HEADLINE> U.S. JETS MAY SEAL OFF HAITI ; EMBARGO : CLINTON CONSIDERS DISPATCHING MILITARY AIRCRAFT TO ENFORCE TOUGHER U.N. SANCTIONS . HE APPROVES OFFSHORE ASYLUM HEARINGS FOR SOME REFUGEES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton is considering the use of U.S. military aircraft to enforce a U.N. embargo on flights in and out of Haiti , including forcing down planes suspected of carrying supporters of the island nation ' s military regime , officials said Saturday . The move is one of several that Clinton is contemplating to make the U.N. embargo effective and concentrate its impact on the Haitian regime , which the United States wants to push from power , officials said . At the same time , responding to protests from supporters of exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , Clinton has decided to provide offshore hearings to Haitian refugees who ask_for political asylum in the United States , officials said . The President does not intend to change the basic policy of intercepting Haitian refugees at_sea and returning them home without allowing them to land in the United States , the officials said . But he has decided that &quot; adjudication in third countries or on ships will be provided within a_few weeks , &quot; a White_House official said . Clinton met for more_than two hours Saturday with his top foreign_policy advisers , including Defense_Secretary William J . Perry and Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , to discuss his options in Haiti , where the brutal regime has ignored U.S. pleas to step_down . &quot; He made several decisions &quot; and may announce them as early as today , an aide said . Clinton has tried several approaches to force the military from power and restore Aristide , Haiti ' s first popularly elected president . For almost a year , the United Nations has imposed an oil embargo on the impoverished nation , but it failed to keep oil out -- or to impress the military . For several months , the Administration tried to broker a compromise between Aristide and the military , but that approach failed too . Now the Administration has won U.N. approval for tougher sanctions , including a near-total embargo on trade and transportation . And , in an apparent attempt to pressure the Haitian military further , Clinton has warned that he will consider U.S. military options if the sanctions fail . But that suggestion has deeply divided the Administration . Perry has publicly dismissed the idea of a U.S. invasion of Haiti as half-baked , asking : &quot; After we ' ve done that , what is Act II ? &quot; In the short term , however , the President is concentrating_on ways to make the new sanctions work in a way the old ones never did -- even though many experts doubt that is possible . &quot; The key thing is that we are convinced that we have the makings of an intensified , broadened sanctions regime that can achieve the objective we have set_out , &quot; a senior official said . The new sanctions approved by the U.N. Security_Council on Friday include an immediate ban on private flights in and out of Haiti . Officials said members of the military and their wealthy supporters had used such flights to ferry supplies to the island . U.S. officials also charge that private planes have been used in illicit drug trade that is enriching the military rulers . Administration officials said they have been looking_at ways that U.S. military aircraft could enforce that ban , in part because they consider it a way to strike directly at the military and its backers . * The broader trade sanctions are scheduled to take_effect May 21 if the military regime does not step_down before then . Clinton and his aides discussed ways to help enforce the embargo , including increased aid to the Dominican_Republic , which shares a land border with Haiti on the island of Hispaniola -- and whose frontier is a major smuggling route . Clinton has also decided to soften his controversial policy of returning refugees directly to Haiti -- but without taking the politically unpopular step of allowing them to land in the United States . Aristide and liberal Democrats in Congress have denounced the policy as racist , and activist Randall Robinson has been_on a hunger_strike in Washington for 26 days to protest it . Robinson said Saturday that he would end his fast if the United States provided the refugees a shelter somewhere and allowed them to make a case for asylum . &quot; The President did decide this morning on an adjustment , &quot; a senior official said Saturday . &quot; We are going_to pursue two options : to provide hearings in a third country or countries , or aboard ships. &quot; He said no other countries have been approached to provide the hearing facilities . In the past , officials have proposed other Caribbean_islands or Honduras as possible sites . Clinton decided to make the change because officials estimated that about 5 % of the refugees have a legitimate claim to refugee status , &quot; and they are put at risk by being returned , &quot; the official said . &quot; We ' re concerned that with increasing harassment and violence , that could get_worse . &quot; This does not mean that people who go_to sea will have a better chance of getting_into the United States than those who apply in Haiti , &quot; he added . &quot; The great , great majority will still be returned to Haiti. &quot; The human_rights group Amnesty International said last week that 139 of the Haitians returned by the United States have been arrested , but the State_Department said most were held for less than 48 hours , and all have been released . Aristide said he was skeptical about Clinton ' s intentions . &quot; It ' s already 30 months ( that ) I ' ve been hearing beautiful statements , &quot; he said , referring to the time since the military overthrew him in 1991 .</TEXT>
