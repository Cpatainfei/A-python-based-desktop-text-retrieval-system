   <HEADLINE> SHOOTING SUSPECT HAS ADVOCATED CLINIC VIOLENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As he stood vigil outside a Wichita , Kan. , courtroom this spring in support of a fellow anti-abortion extremist on_trial for shooting an abortion doctor , Paul Hill explained that he believed he had been called by God to pray for those who commit violence , but did not believe that God wanted him to shoot doctors himself . As the leader of his tiny , self-styled group , Defensive Action , he has traveled the country over the past year encouraging anti-abortion violence , telling fundamentalist church groups that murdering abortion providers was tantamount_to &quot; justifiable homicide. &quot; He even appeared on &quot; Donahue &quot; endorsing last year ' s killing of Pensacola , Fla. , abortion physician Dr. David Gunn . &quot; We all have different callings , and my calling is to minister &quot; to those who kill doctors , Hill , 40 , said in an interview in March . &quot; It ' s largely a matter of calling . I ' ve taken_up the weapon I ' m most comfortable with . I ' ve taken_up the weapon of the spirit. &quot; But on Friday , after Hill was arrested and charged with the shotgun slayings of a Pensacola abortion doctor and his male escort and the wounding of a woman , it appeared that Hill had finally begun to practice what he preached . Friday ' s brutal murders mark the first time that a leader of a militant anti-abortion group has been charged with an abortion-related killing . As a result , the case will almost certainly make_it far more difficult for anti-abortion leaders to dismiss such crimes as isolated incidents , as they have with earlier shootings . And it could intensify scrutiny of the militant subculture of the anti-abortion movement by federal investigators . Congressional leaders on Friday urged the Clinton_Administration and the FBI to mount a major undercover investigation of anti-abortion groups to prevent further violence . On Friday , the FBI joined the investigation into the Pensacola murders . &quot; The federal_government has the tools and the resources to deal with such reprehensible terrorist attacks and the organizations responsible_for perpetrating the attacks , &quot; said Rep . Charles E . Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , the sponsor of legislation just signed into law by President Clinton that makes_it a federal crime to commit acts of violence against abortion providers and clinics . &quot; The FBI must begin to infiltrate anti-abortion groups that advocate the use of violence , and the members of these groups who conspire to commit violent acts should be prosecuted , &quot; Schumer said . Hill ' s arrest could put dozens of leaders of anti-abortion groups on the spot , since many of them have signed petitions circulated in recent months by Hill endorsing acts of murder . &quot; This is not an isolated incident , and it was not committed by an isolated nut , &quot; Eleanor Smeal , president of The Fund for the Feminist Majority , charged at a Washington news_conference Friday . &quot; Paul Hill is a leader of a group advocating what he calls ' justifiable homicide , ' and many people in this movement have signed his petitions. &quot; Over the past year , Hill has become a well-known figure in the radical fringe of the anti-abortion movement , and has increasingly drawn the attention of abortion-rights advocacy groups and of local law_enforcement officials in Florida for his inflammatory public statements . Officials of abortion-rights groups said they have been told that state law_enforcement officials have periodically had Hill under surveillance in recent months , but the Florida Department of Law_Enforcement refused to comment Friday . Hill first gained public attention following the shooting death in March , 1993 , of Gunn in Pensacola ; he created Defensive Action largely to provide support for Michael Griffin , an anti-abortion protester who was convicted in Gunn ' s murder earlier this year . Since then , Hill has appeared on several television and radio talk_shows to debate the morality of violence against doctors and abortion clinics . He also developed close ties to other radicals who have formed anti-abortion splinter_groups around the country . Hill and other extremists argue that abortion doctors are guilty of murdering unborn babies , and thus killing an abortion doctor is a justifiable way of preventing such killing . Those groups , including Defensive Action , have broken_off from the mainstream of the anti-abortion movement out of frustration with the refusal of groups such_as the National Right_to_Life and Operation Rescue to endorse the bombing of abortion clinics and violence against doctors . Operation Rescue , in particular , has been riven with internal division over the issue of whether to endorse violence . While founder Randall Terry and other leaders publicly call doctors &quot; child killers &quot; and the organization now targets doctors and their families for protest and harassment , Operation Rescue has not endorsed the violence when it occurs . Abortion-rights advocates charge that the group tacitly supports the violence , while the more extreme anti-abortion leaders have formed their own groups and charge that Operation Rescue has lost its way . Hill has been in the forefront of that splinter movement , and has close ties to other leaders . He has often written for a publication published by another extremist group , Advocates for Life , which also endorses targeting doctors . In addition , Hill writes his own Defensive Action newsletter , which he has used to generate support throughout the anti-abortion underground , pleading with supporters for cash to support his travels while calling_for help in militant activity . Hill , who has most recently been &quot; self-employed &quot; doing automotive restoration in Pensacola , describes himself as a former Presbyterian minister who was excommunicated in 1993 for his support for Griffin ' s murder of Gunn . He has said that he received a master ' s of divinity degree in 1983 and later worked as a Presbyterian minister in the Pensacola area from 1984 to 1991 . He was clearly bitter over the way he was treated by his church , however , and appeared to become increasingly isolated even within the fundamentalist Christian_church network that provides most of the foot_soldiers in the anti-abortion movement . In July , 1993 , he wrote in the Advocates for Life newsletter that the effects of his excommunication was like being &quot; treated like a non-Christian visitor &quot; to his own church . &quot; I am not allowed to take the Lord ' s supper , &quot; he lamented . But his religious isolation only drove him further to the fringe . On his own , he published a 16-page tract last year called &quot; Was the Killing of Dr. Gunn Just ? &quot; which argued that Gunn ' s murder was righteous retribution for abortion . In their publications , Hill and other militants often target individual doctors by name , and doctors in the Pensacola area had been high on those lists . Dr. John Bayard Britton , 69 , who was killed Friday with a shotgun blast to the head , had been the target of a heavy harassment campaign from anti-abortion protesters ; he was a close colleague of David Gunn , who was murdered at another Pensacola clinic , and the facility where Britton was gunned_down Friday had been bombed in 1984 . On Friday , Britton was wearing a bulletproof_vest because of repeated threats . He was so fearful for his life that he had an escort driving him ; that escort , 74-year-old abortion-rights advocate James Barrett , was also killed , and his wife , June , 68 , was wounded .</TEXT>
