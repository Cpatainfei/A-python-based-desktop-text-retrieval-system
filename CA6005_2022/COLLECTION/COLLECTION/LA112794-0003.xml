   <HEADLINE> THE PURE POETRY OF DESIRE ; DAVID ST . JOHN DOESN ' T BELIEVE WE CAN LIVE IN A WORLD OF PURE BEAUTY AND DESIRE , BUT HE DOESN ' T WANT TO LIVE OR MAKE POEMS WITHOUT THEM EITHER ; STUDY FOR THE WORLD ' S BODY : NEW AND SELECTED POEMS , BY DAVID ST . JOHN ( HARPERCOLLINS : $ 11 ; 142 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> David St . John , who teaches at the University of Southern California and whose new book was nominated for the National Book Award , is a gorgeous writer . This has been true of his work from the beginning , but I think even those who have followed him closely will be taken by surprise when they read &quot; Study for the World ' s Body. &quot; It is a selection of poems , and gathers work from St . John ' s four previous collections , beginning with the stylish and much-praised &quot; Hush &quot; of 1976 , adds_to it the best of &quot; The Shore &quot; ( 1980 ) , &quot; No Heaven &quot; ( 1985 ) , &quot; Terraces of Rain &quot; ( 1991 ) and concludes with a final section of newer poems . This last section is called &quot; Merlin , &quot; and it is what is likely to surprise St . John ' s readers , new and old . Because it is not just gorgeous , it is go-for-broke gorgeous . It is made_out of sentences , sweeping through and across his meticulous verse stanzas , that could have been written , for their velvet and intricate suavity , by Henry_James . But that doesn ' t quite describe them , since they are also full , almost past ripeness , of a floating , sometimes painful , sometimes wistful , intense , dark and silvery eroticism that feels_like it comes_out of some cross between late 19th-Century symbolist lushness -- vague and specific at once -- and the kind of ' 60s and ' 70s European film that talked_about eroticism with a wistfulness so intense that it seemed experience and the melancholy recollection of experience were the same thing . Mallarme and Eric Rohmer , perhaps . Or Rilke and Michaelangelo Antonioni . Here is one such sentence from &quot; A Fan Sketched With Silver Egrets , &quot; a poem which bears the subtitle , &quot; Hommage a Mallarme &quot; : As this flights of egrets Across the silk mask , this fan Held so softly to your lips , Seems to break_apart as slowly As blown ash , feathers rippling in the heavy Weather of evening , you need not speak . . . even here , Concealed by this soft wing ( like a mirror Trembling , like Narcissus ' own breath ) , As I lean closer to you , ready to step Into a future so pure , we will both lose Our separate ways . . . . This is of course , mimicry , homage . And as you can give yourself over to it for the pleasure of it , a question is likely to occur to you : What is a well-known American poet , a Southern California poet in the 1990s , doing replicating , even exaggerating -- but lovingly , without parody , as if it were a hypnotic tracing of the older_hand -- the style of the 1880s ? There ' s not much mistaking this intent . The first of the new poems St . John collects begins with an epigraph from Paul Valery ' s essay on Mallarme , and reads like -- perhaps it is -- a translation , not quite a parody , of one of Mallarme ' s sonnets . Listen to the beginning of it : I know the moon is troubling . Its pale eloquence is always such a meddling , Intrusive lie . I know the pearl sheel of the sheets Remains the screen I ' ll draw_back against the night . This moonstruck tone is not only the very atmosphere of that late 19th-Century style known as &quot; the decadence , &quot; the &quot; troubling / meddling &quot; rhyme is the very sound of Mallarme . Listen to this , a bit further on in the poem : I know the orchid smell of your skin The way I know the blackened path to the marina , When gathering clouds obscure the summer moon , Just as I know the chambered heart where I begin . I know too the lacquered jewel box , its obsidian patina . . . . Readers who don ' t know St . John and start this book at the beginning will come_to these poems last , of course . And I think the experience will be surprising because of these last poems . It ' s as if you were watching a movie of the history of modern poetry being run backward . The book begins with the up-to-date , uncannily deft voice of &quot; Hush &quot; with its mid-70s ironies . Almost 20 years ago , the early post-modern phase , when young poets were fascinated with John Ashbery ' s immaculately impure way of going nowhere in a poem on the plausible theory that there was nowhere to go . In &quot; Hush , &quot; St . John found his own version of the non-sequitur narrative . His second , &quot; The Shore , &quot; is all eros and elegy . The poems have let_go the shifty , playful postmodern manner and turned_to meditative first-person lyrics , something like those of Kenneth Rexroth ' s of the 1940s and ' 50s . They are_full of coastal imagery , radiant with romantic desolation and with loss . There is one line that sums_up this intense melancholy : &quot; Even the sea sings one octave in the past. &quot; What most marks &quot; No Heaven &quot; and &quot; Terraces of Rain &quot; is the experience of Europe , St . John ' s love_affair with the landscapes of Italy and with Italian modernism . &quot; No Heaven &quot; modulates between the styles of the first two books , and if &quot; The Shore &quot; is obsessed by a woman , &quot; No Heaven &quot; is obsessed by women . &quot; Terraces of Rain &quot; includes one of his best , and best-known , poems , a complicated , moving , many-voiced elegy for the Italian poet and film-maker Pier Paolo Pasolini , murdered , apparently , in a sexual encounter in the poor district of Rome where he grew_up and to which he returned late at night to recover some mystery in himself from the boy prostitutes who haunted its streets . It seems to be these poems , with their ambivalence about fantasy and fascination with desire , that lead St . John back to the idiom of the symbolists , straight back to the otherworldly music of poets sick_of this one , permanently fascinated by loss as the romantic condition and by the space between desire and all_the objects it finds to spend itself on in the world . Here is another sentence from the final section of the book , from a poem called &quot; Lucifer in Starlight &quot; : And Nico Pulled herself close to me , her mouth almost Touching my mouth , as she sighed , &quot; Look . . . , &quot; And deep within the pupil of her left eye , Almost like the mirage of a ship ' s distant , hanging Lantern rocking with the waves , I could see , at the most remote end of the receding , Circular hallway of her eye , there , at its doorway , At the small aperture of the black telescope of the pupil , A tiny , dangling crucifix -- Silver , lit by the ragged shards of starlight , reflecting In her as quietly as pain , as simply as pain . . . . This is something more complicated than mimicry . You can ' t quite tell who the speaker is -- a melancholy man who has an apartment in Rome ; he drives a red Lancia -- why not ? -- so it ' s the 20th Century -- but it is the same tone of stylized desire , stylized longing , beautifully rendered . Los Angeles is also that territory in &quot; Los Angeles , 1954 , &quot; a poem whose language has the effect of making the idiom of Raymond Chandler , or Walter Mosely passed_through Raymond Chandler , sound like another smokier , bluesier version of the poetry of longing , which , of course , it was . The speaker recalls a woman from &quot; the old days , / When she used to hang_out at a place / Called Club Zombie , / A black cabaret that the police liked / To raid now and then , &quot; and the black singer who wanted her , and like all_the characters in this poems , had her and didn ' t have her . Even when the setting -- and the sexual repertoire -- is distinctly contemporary and American and the tone is ironic , the long sentences are tinged with a European , bittersweet , retrospective lushness . So what ' s going_on ? What ' s going_on , I think , is that partly from pure , addictive pleasure , partly with analytic cunning , St . John found himself drawn_back through various modernist and postmodern idioms to their place_of_origin in the pure poetry of romantic desire and its most theatrical idiom . that ' s why he ' s quoting Valery on Mallarme : &quot; The definition of beauty is easy ; it is what leads us to desperation. &quot; And it is true . The writing all through these last poems in the book is gorgeous and more gorgeous , and the place it seems to leave writer and reader is pretty desperate . Even the move to that style , as if he were tracing with his hand the poems of Mallarme to see if , written again , they ' d turn_out differently , seems desperate . As if he were testing to see if his instinct was true : that a century after the decadents the poetry of desire is right back where it started from , trapped in an idiom that wants to stay as long as it can in fantasy , memory , erotic longing , erotic regret . It occurs to me to say that this is a theme not uncommon among Los Angeles poets . If all_of contemporary poetry has had to do with the space that desire makes and how we fill it , it seems that a number of Los Angeles writers and poets -- Wanda Coleman , Amy Gerstler , James McMichael , Dennis Cooper , Killarney Clarey , Arthur Vogelsang , Carol Muske , to name some of the very good and very different writers who come_to_mind -- have taken_up the subject and given it an edge and nervous or lush sexual content that might have to do with proximity to a major center of the desire-representing industry . When William Butler Yeats rejected the poetry of his symbolist youth , he pronounced a judgment on it : &quot; We have fed our hearts on fantasy , and our hearts grew brutal on the fare. &quot; St . John ' s recent poems seem to move us back into the space before that judgment , to look again at its sources , its natural environment of languorous deferral in great , sensuous , world-devouring sentences . In the last poem in the book , St . John makes what seems a diagnostic gesture . Actually , the last poem is two poems set side_by_side , making a pair of columns down the page . The first of them , &quot; The Body of Desire , &quot; is over-the-top in a book already full of high romantic rhetoric . It is a kind of exquisite erotic reverie and meditation , complete with a mysterious woman named Seven who lives_in a chateau and wears her boots to bed , written in a style as dense and lushly beautiful as anything in the book . Next to it , across from it , is a second poem , &quot; Of Time &amp; the Body , &quot; which is an elegy to a friend of the poet , written in a much airier , simpler contemporary idiom , perhaps out of William Carlos Williams , that thinks bleakly , clearly , and movingly about the death of a man , a dance critic in_love with Balanchine , and about time and the body , and the limits both impose , and about the way dance is a pure expression of these things : body , movement , limit , time , and death . Here is one passage from the first poem : Seven Turns_to me , lips Lit in the reddish dawn light -- Wild mouth of a fallen poppy -- Ash-scarlet , brash . Naked Beneath the sky ' s low dome Of shadow . Her fingers solemnly Tunnelling my hair , my own mouth Working the hymn of her ribs . A few lines later : There , as I knelt before her , those pearls Gathering like white_mustard seeds At each red ridge . Some nights she ' d rub My body raw with limes , with myrrh . The first few lines seem right at the edge of pornographic cliche , and last line and a half -- very memorable in its way : &quot; Some nights she ' d rub my body raw with limes &quot; -- are at once deeply silly and somehow committed to the fantasy . All through the poem -- it is several pages long -- gorgeous writing , rich musicality , haunting images of desire so fantastic that they rise toward bathos , go_over the edge , and then return again to sheer romantic intensity . You really have to read the poem to get the effect . Next to it , across from it , a straightforward , mostly plain-spoken meditative elegy that occasionally looks ironically at the language on the other side of the page : The presence of a death So_much our own It wears a lover ' s face , The landscape of the lover ' s Worldly body ; where even The sunlight , as they say , Dances along the water Of the fountain . . . . I think the point of putting these two poems together is to end the book at a cul-de-sac , at a sense of the absolute split between , or at least the permanently parallel tracks of , the dream life of desire and the life of mind and body in the world . A split , flat out , unresolved . It ' s a gesture at once supremely confident and desperate by a writer who can ' t quite give_up pure beauty , the pure fix of desire , and doesn ' t believe you can live there , and who also doesn ' t want to live_in a world , or make poems about a world , without it . A very nervy summing-up . And a beautiful , strange , dubious , elegant , enormously skillful , self-mocking book . It will be extremely interesting to see where David St . John goes from here .</TEXT>
