   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 : 3 DAYS AND COUNTING ; GERMANY ' S DRIVING FORCE ; LOTHAR MATTHAEUS THE ENGINE BEHIND HIS NATION ' S DEFENSE OF ITS TITLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lothar Matthaeus represents the finest in German engineering . Lift the hood on the German national soccer team and hear his throaty rumble . While others are taken by showroom models -- your Romarios and Valderramas -- the Germans are driven to success by Matthaeus ' tireless , powerful , dependable pistons . &quot; He is not a leader with elegance , &quot; Wolfgang Niesbach , the German press officer , explained . &quot; He ' s not the leader with the most intelligence . He ' s a leader because of his power. &quot; The 33-year-old Matthaeus is not ready for the scrap heap . In German football lore , only Franz Beckenbauer is more revered . Once , a club manager said of Matthaeus : &quot; The day shall come when I will read in a Friday paper how well Matthaeus played_on Saturday. &quot; Hardly what you would call a Bavarian brute at 5-feet-10 and 165 pounds , Matthaeus plays a much larger game . Stories of his stamina are legendary . First on the practice field and last to leave , he routinely runs younger mates into the ground . Germany , not self , comes first . In the 1986 World Cup , playing with a broken wrist , Matthaeus set_out to guard Argentina ' s Maradona , then the world ' s best player . Matthaeus said broken legs would not have kept him from his appointed pounds . &quot; When I think_of Matthaeus , I always have this vision of him getting the ball in midfield and just running past people for 30 , 40 yards with the ball , &quot; said Sigi Schmid , the U.S. national team ' s assistant coach . &quot; He can just bring the ball_up so fast . He ' s not really a playmaker , but is asked to be a dynamo , the engine . It ' s like , ' OK guys , get_on my back and I ' ll carry you with me. ' &quot; In the 1990 World Cup , Matthaeus stormed Italy like a runaway truck . As captain and attacking midfielder for Coach Beckenbauer ' s brigade , Matthaeus scored four goals in leading West Germany to its third title . Four years later , Matthaeus returns in a new position , with a new disposition , and is quite confident Germany can successfully defend its World Cup title . This time , Matthaeus actually has something to prove . Although his legend is secure , much has changed since Italy . His marriage to childhood sweetheart Sylvia has dissolved . In 1992 , while playing for Italy ' s Inter Milan , Matthaeus ruptured knee ligaments against Parma . Convinced that Matthaeus was finished , Inter Milan sent him packing . &quot; The Italian president and trainer thought the same , that Matthaeus was finished , &quot; Matthaeus said last week from Nottawasaga , Canada , where the German team was training . &quot; For me , it was new motivation for coming back. &quot; Surgery was performed in Vail , Colo. , by Dr. Richard Steadman , the orthopedic surgeon who has reconstructed the wounded knees of notable athletes , particularly skiers . It was Steadman who 10 years ago pieced together the shredded knee of Luxembourg skier Marc Girardelli , who returned to win an unprecedented five World Cup overall titles . &quot; I have to say to Dr. Steadman many times , thanks , &quot; Matthaeus said . &quot; For me , he ' s the greatest . It was a hard injury . I was 31 years old . For many players with that injury , they would be finished. &quot; Following his rehabilitation , which forced Matthaeus to miss the 1992 European Championships , he returned to his old club , Bayern Munich , where Matthaeus had played from 1984 to ' 88 . There , he would strengthen his bond to Beckenbauer , who has long ties to the club . At Bayern Munich , the Germans would tinker with the Matthaeus machinery , change him from a midfielder to a defensive sweeper . In the 1970s , Beckenbauer revolutionized the game as an attacker from the sweeper position . Matthaeus had no qualms about making the change . In preparation for the national team , he played the sweeper role this season and led Bayern Munich to the German club championship . &quot; For me it was no problem , &quot; Matthaeus said . &quot; I had played 14 years in the middle field , but I am happy with this new position . It ' s an important position for the team . I can order the plays from behind , and I have many choices . And when we have the ball , I can go_in the middle of the field. &quot; The downside is that Matthaeus -- now a roving defensive back , sort of soccer ' s version of Ronnie Lott -- is farther from the opposing goal . &quot; There was big discussion about it , that we ' d miss him in the midfield , &quot; Niesbach said . &quot; It is logical , that from the midfield the other goal is closer . He will not be attacking so often , but when he does , when he sees the chance to play offense , it ' s also going_to be a big surprise for the other team. &quot; Despite the similarities , no one is ready to compare Matthaeus with Beckenbauer , who led West Germany to World Cup titles as both a player and a coach . Yet , Matthaeus recently broke Beckenbauer ' s German record of 103 international matches . &quot; Franz is in another light , &quot; Niesbach said . &quot; Franz is ' Der Kaiser. ' &quot; Matthaeus knows his place . &quot; He was and is the first_person of soccer in Germany , &quot; Matthaeus said . &quot; Beckenbauer is the greatest . He was my trainer on the national team and last year my trainer on the club team . But for me , he ' s not only a trainer , he ' s a friend. &quot; The coronation of Beckenbauer has as much to do with the German ' s grace off the field . Matthaeus , by contrast , has always been rough around the edges , a man who lived the way he played . In earlier days , he was a noted womanizer and pub hopper . Once , after a night on the town , he crashed his car into a garden fence . Matthaeus lost his license for eight months . &quot; Beckenbauer was an outstanding person , not just in football , but in the whole German society , &quot; Niesbach said . &quot; Franz is a gentleman , Lothar is a power man . Lothar , he is always a boy in the middle of life . If you drink beer , Lothar drinks one , too . If we were thinking how to speak_to the girl , he was together with the girl. &quot; Matthaeus has reportedly mellowed , and in January , he remarried . His new wife , Lolita Morena , is Swiss and works for Swiss and Italian television networks . Despite his social shortcomings , Matthaeus may be destined to follow in Beckenbauer ' s enormous boot steps . Some have suggested that Matthaeus might be in_line to become German national coach , perhaps early in the next century . Matthaeus does not think that far ahead . &quot; I have a new contract_in Munich for the next three years , &quot; Matthaeus said . &quot; I think for me , I should go_on with the next three years . What is_after the next three years , I don ' t know . To me , what ' s important is the World Cup and the next two or three years in Munich . What is later , I must look. &quot; Matthaeus , though , thinks he would make a good coach . &quot; I think , yes , &quot; he said . &quot; When I see the good coaches in the world , they have spent a lot of time playing football. &quot; But first things first . &quot; I am just happy I can play football , &quot; he said . &quot; After my injury two years ago , my head was empty . I think it ' s finished for me . Later , I came_back . For me , that ' s the greatest . That I can play this sport. &quot; World Cup Player at a Glance Name : Lothar Matthaeus .
