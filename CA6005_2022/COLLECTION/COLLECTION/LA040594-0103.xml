   <TEXT> The young_woman ' s face blushed the color of borscht . Her chin disappeared into the high collar of her fur_coat as she looked furtively around the hospital waiting room making_sure no one she knew was there . Then she whispered that she had caught &quot; it &quot; from her husband . The woman could not bring herself to speak the name of her ailment : syphilis . &quot; Nobody cares how she got_it ; it ' s still considered a disgrace , &quot; said Valery V . Kuznetsov , chief doctor at the Skin and Venereal Disease Clinic No . 7 . In today ' s Russia , where a new sexual permissiveness coexists with the old Soviet puritanism , venereal_disease is still seen as shameful and revolting . Above all , patients feel it must be kept secret from a prying and punitive state . Until about a year ago , confidential treatment for venereal_disease was unknown here -- and most syphilis patients were still being locked_up in a little-known gulag of high-security hospitals . Now Russia is facing an epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases -- an ominous indicator that a serious AIDS problem could be looming , although so far the former Soviet_Union has largely been spared that scourge . Syphilis rates have shot_up eightfold since 1988 and are at twice U.S. levels , according to the Russian Ministry of Health . The incidence of gonorrhea is also climbing . The rise of these diseases indicates widespread unsafe sexual habits that invite HIV transmission , said Mikhail I . Narkyevich , who heads the ministry ' s national AIDS prevention program . &quot; I have no illusions , &quot; Narkyevich said . &quot; Syphilis is rising in the young . In two years , it will be AIDS. &quot; A delayed sexual revolution is under way in Russia . Political liberalization begat an explosion of pornography , prostitution and provocative advertising . Authorities complain that the public has interpreted democracy as a license for promiscuity . But before doctors can heal the sick -- let alone preach prevention -- they must undo the legacy of decades of mistrust created by the frightening , coercive , punitive Soviet system for treating sexually transmitted disease . Take the case of Alexander O. , who spent two weeks in a Soviet prison hospital in 1973 . His crime : contracting gonorrhea . As soon as he realized he was infected , Alexander went_to a local VD clinic for treatment . &quot; I expected them to help me , but instead the doctor subjected me to a real interrogation , &quot; Alexander said . &quot; At the end of it , I felt_like a criminal. &quot; The doctor opened a dossier on Alexander that included his passport number and information about his family and workplace . She demanded that he disclose his sexual contacts . When he demurred , not wishing to subject his girlfriend to the same treatment , the doctor threatened to lock him up . Ultimately , Alexander was sent to one of the 42 high-security VD hospitals the Soviet_Union continued to run decades after the discovery of antibiotics that could cure most syphilis and gonorrhea cases with a single injection . Treatment at the hospital where Alexander was sent was not gentle , and the place was so filthy he was afraid to eat_in the cafeteria for fear of catching an even worse malady . &quot; Doctors examined us very seldom and spoke_to us like scum and criminals , &quot; he said . &quot; There were very few nurses . And you really had to chase a nurse around the hospital to get the prescribed medicine &quot; -- usually , up_to a month of injections of weak Soviet penicillin . If a patient was docile , his ailment was listed on his papers as eczema or another non-contagious skin_disease , sparing him further humiliation . If he was uncooperative , doctors threatened to prolong his hospital stay , or write his true condition on the sick_leave form he would have to give his employer to explain his absence . Five years after his release from the hospital , Alexander contracted gonorrhea again . Determined to stay out of the clutches of the &quot; VD police , &quot; he did what privileged or well-connected Soviet citizens had done for years . He sneaked_off for a private consultation with a doctor recommended by a friend and paid a steep bribe for a prescription . Alexander was able to buy penicillin . Then he bribed a nurse recommended by the doctor to give him injections . &quot; I have been lucky ever since , but if I get sick again , nothing will make me get official treatment , even though they claim you can be treated anonymously now , &quot; he said . &quot; I just don ' t trust the system. &quot; Changing that attitude is an urgent priority for the Russian Ministry of Health , which is determined to convince citizens that treatment today is humane , dignified and confidential . The ministry is gradually closing the VD hospitals , about half of which have already been shut_down . And anonymous treatment for sexually transmitted diseases , although not for AIDS , has recently become available in some areas . But the message is traveling slowly , while the maladies are spreading fast . The rate of reported syphilis shot_up from 4.4 per 100 # 000 people in 1988 to 13.4 in 1992 and 32.3 in 1993 . In some areas , syphilis has spread even faster . In the city of Cheboksary , for example , about 350 miles east of Moscow , the syphilis rate has jumped 20-fold since 1990 . Gonorrhea is even more prevalent , with 211.4 cases per 100 # 000 people . And chlamydia , a disease with few symptoms that remains difficult to diagnose because most Russian clinics do not have the necessary laboratory equipment , is so widespread it has become a leading cause of infertility among Russian women , as it is in the West , public health officials said . Some of the surge in sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) may be explained by better reporting as public health officials spread the word that patients need no longer fear coming_forward . Many of the &quot; new &quot; syphilis patients have in fact been infected for some time , said Lilia I . Tikhonova , who heads the Health Ministry ' s syphilis prevention program . Still , judging by the number of newspaper_advertisements hawking confidential treatment for STDs and the ease with which antibiotics can be bought without a prescription , a private underground treatment network persists . This raises the possibility that the disease rate may be higher than official statistics indicate . So far , the old Iron_Curtain appears to have spared Russia the ravages that HIV infection has wreaked on the West . The first_AIDS case was not reported here until March , 1987 . By then , information about the disease had already reached Russia . To date , 717 Russian citizens have tested HIV positive , and 83 people have died , according to the Health Ministry ' s Narkyevich . AIDS activists say these infection and death statistics are vastly understated . &quot; Those are only the people who have been traced , &quot; said Irina Savalyeva of the AIDS prevention group AESOP . &quot; There were lots of people who might have been ( HIV ) positive but avoided all testing sites because they were afraid their anonymity would not be preserved -- and rightly so. &quot; Public health officials blame the huge increase in STDs on the lifting of restrictions on travel into and out of Russia ; on a marked rise in prostitution that has been accelerated by skyrocketing unemployment among women , and on large migrations of refugees and settlers from the Caucasus , Tajikistan and other war-torn areas of the former Soviet_Union . The old political controls were somewhat effective in uncovering and isolating VD outbreaks . Patients who had been cured had to report back for blood_tests each year . Teachers , day_care providers and food service workers were routinely tested , and all Soviet citizens had to be certified syphilis-free before they could travel abroad . In Soviet times , sailors were not allowed to prowl foreign ports without a KGB minder in tow , Narkyevich said ; today , many Russian sailors come_home with syphilis , and some later test positive for HIV . Still , many infected people simply avoided treatment or paid bribes to doctors who may_not have been trained to treat STDs . Others consulted faith healers or bought antibiotics on the black_market and tried to treat themselves . Some syphilis sufferers managed to mask the symptoms of the disease but not cure it , so it progressed in those patients with ghastly consequences such_as blindness , Tikhonova said . &quot; That is why we finally decided to change our ways , &quot; Tikhonova said . &quot; Now , under democracy , people have more freedom , and every citizen has the right to keep his private life to himself. &quot; But sex education lags . Although state and private AIDS prevention programs exist , they have not yet penetrated the public consciousness -- let alone begun to erode the bias against condoms , even imported ones . That bias is partly left over from the Soviet era , when thick , unreliable domestic-made condoms were long the object of black humor . People who catch STDs continue to be viewed_as lepers . And AIDS patients are often shunned . Even doctors ' attitudes can be slow to change . As late as 1992 , about 80 % of syphilis patients at Kuznetsov ' s clinic were being hospitalized for 20 to 30 days , the doctor said . Yet a dose of penicillin from UNICEF costs about 39 cents . This wildly cost-ineffective system persisted partly because the Soviet_Union neither manufactured nor imported long-lasting antibiotics , and to eradicate syphilis using weaker Soviet antibiotics could require injections for several weeks . Today , Kuznetsov ' s clinic is one of only four in Moscow that are allowed to offer outpatient treatment with imported antibiotics . The clinic hospitalizes only about 10 % of patients , mainly those with complications , said the doctor . The clinic also offers anonymous VD and HIV testing . The service is so popular that by word_of_mouth alone , the clinic has overflowed with people from Moscow and beyond , Kuznetsov said . Those who test positive must give their names if they wish to receive treatment , but now that the process has been decriminalized , most are willing to do so , the doctor said . &quot; We convince people that we are not going_to tell anyone , we are not going_to report them and we are not going_to lock them up , &quot; Kuznetsov said . AIDS activists say the process is moving too slowly . &quot; There ' s still the Soviet psychology that people should be directed and should not be allowed to choose their own lifestyle , &quot; Savalyeva said . &quot; I ' m not very optimistic about government_agencies being able to change their lifelong attitudes. &quot; Tikhonova and her colleagues are trying to re-educate medical personnel to take a non-judgmental approach to sexually transmitted diseases . Patients are told that treatment is voluntary and are encouraged -- not ordered -- to bring their sex partners for testing . In an even more radical step , 200 anonymous treatment centers have been opened across Russia , though none in Moscow . This program is considered experimental , and the results will be re-evaluated in two years , Tikhonova said . A 1971 law that established criminal and civil sanctions on VD patients who refused to submit to treatment or reveal their sexual contacts has been repealed . Authorities , however , want to retain criminal penalties for anyone who knowingly infects an unsuspecting sex partner with syphilis or the HIV virus , Tikhonova said . That is in keeping with a trend toward criminalization of conscious transmission in some U.S. states and many other countries , according to the World_Health_Organization . But Russian officials have concluded that coercion ultimately won ' t work . &quot; All our propaganda used to consist entirely of bans and prohibitions , &quot; Kuznetsov said . &quot; But it ' s impossible to ban sex . So now our task is to educate. &quot; Sergei L . Loiko of The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
