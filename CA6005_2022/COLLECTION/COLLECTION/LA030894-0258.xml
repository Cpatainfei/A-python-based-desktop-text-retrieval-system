   <HEADLINE> MANY IN SOUTHERN MEXICO VILLAGES WARY OF PEACE PLAN ; REVOLT : REBEL BACKERS FEAR PROMISES WON ' T BE KEPT . PROPOSAL ' S LEGALESE IS A PROBLEM FOR THEM TOO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The government peace proposal to southern Mexico guerrillas , received with great fanfare last week in the colonial town of San Cristobal de las Casas , may prove a tougher sell in the rebels ' jungle strongholds . After their first look_at the proposal , supporters of the Zapatista National Liberation Army here and in neighboring Santa Helena were skeptical . In weekend interviews shortly after the 32-point document was announced , they said the government promises are vague , with few guarantees that commitments will be kept . &quot; It looks_to me as if they are trying to get us to halt the armed struggle and go_back to voting and naming delegates , &quot; said Oralia , an outspoken rebel supporter . &quot; Well , we tried that and didn ' t get anywhere . Arms are the only way. &quot; Zapatista spokesman Subcommander Marcos said delegates to the peace talks are visiting communities this week to consult with grass-roots rebels on whether to accept the government proposal . The delegates had not yet arrived in either Ibarra or Santa Helena -- both villages at the edge of the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve , a four-hour hike from the nearest dirt road -- so the guerrilla supporters here had not formally decided their positions . Villagers qualified their opinions by pointing_out that most of them do not read well and normally speak Tzeltal , an Indian language . As a result , they found the legalistic , Spanish-language copies of the proposal that reporters gave them difficult to fathom . Sitting in a circle of benches outside their palm-roofed safehouse , a score of rebel supporters -- including four rifle-toting men in the Zapatista uniform of brown shirts , green pants and red bandannas -- listened intently as Oralia read aloud the government proposal . Two pages into the document , she paused and looked_up at puzzled faces . &quot; You can ' t understand a word of this , &quot; she said , laughing . The laughter grew when reporters noted that they had the same initial reaction to part of the reply , which deals with demands for clean elections and representative government . Rebel delegates said they have translated both their demands and the government ' s answer into the four Indian languages spoken in Zapatista communities . But language may prove less a barrier than basic distrust of a government that has reneged_on commitments for decades . &quot; The government has treated us like dogs , &quot; said Horacio , a community-level rebel leader . &quot; We are tired_of begging . All we get is tricked. &quot; The government is offering democratic reforms , limited autonomy for Indian communities , the country ' s first anti-discrimination law and major investments in social_services . The proposal resulted from nine days of talks aimed at ending a rebellion that began on Jan . 1 and left at least 145 people dead . By calling attention to the corruption and desperate poverty in Mexico ' s most southern state , the uprising embarrassed an administration that has polished a modernizing image internationally . While some rebel demands were for political reforms , most involved basic services , such_as education , water , health_care and roads . One point in the rebel demands and the government reply deals with women ' s issues , promising community mills to make the cornmeal that women now grind by hand every day , as well as bakeries and child_care centers . &quot; We won ' t have any more work to do , &quot; Oralia joked . The proposal includes timetables and transition periods that range from one month to three years . Zapatistas here said that while they like the sound of many government offers , they want specific details before giving an opinion . &quot; Let ' s wait 90 days and see how much they actually do , &quot; said one rebel supporter in Santa Helena . While Zapatistas were skeptical , villagers who did not join the rebellion -- 59 of the 82 families here -- were worried . &quot; What does the agreement say about_turning in their guns ? &quot; asked schoolteacher Pedro Perez . He shook his head when told that arms are not mentioned . Guns and uniforms are far more evident among the village Zapatistas now than they were three weeks ago . Tensions between rebels and pacifists are growing as supplies run_short because guerrilla roadblocks prevent goods from entering the area . Non-rebel villagers here seem far more worried about guns than do government officials , who refuse to comment on the issue . &quot; It was difficult enough to convince people who were prepared_for a prolonged , armed struggle to start thinking_about peace so quickly , &quot; said one source close to the talks . &quot; The arms will come_in time. &quot; The Zapatistas are adamant about keeping their weapons . &quot; If the government wants us to have faith in it , it should have faith in us , &quot; said a young_woman who identified herself as Cecilia . &quot; Our guns are our only defense in case the government tricks us and sends_in the army. &quot; Horacio added : &quot; We are never giving_up our arms . Even if Subcommander Marcos orders us to , we are not turning them in. &quot;</TEXT>
