   <HEADLINE> LOCKHEED NEIGHBORS OPPOSE CLEANUP PLAN ; SAFETY : FEARING AIR_POLLUTION AND HEALTH RISKS , RESIDENTS SAY THEY WILL CHALLENGE PROPOSED VAPOR EXTRACTION SYSTEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hundreds of residents appeared at a public meeting Wednesday to oppose the Lockheed Corp . effort to clean_up contaminated soil on a 90-acre site , claiming it will pose grave health risks to neighbors . Complying with federal orders to remove contaminants left_behind after 63 years of building military aircraft , Lockheed wants to build a so-called vapor extraction system of wells , pipes and charcoal filters that would release up_to 40 pounds a day of potentially cancer-causing substances from a 50-foot tower . The plan -- which has been given preliminary approval by the South Coast Air Quality Management District -- is said to be the best means for Lockheed to prevent further contamination of underground water sources . But it has raised the ire of residents who want to stop work_through legal channels on the $ 13.7-million project proposed for the site of Lockheed ' s former B-1 plant . Both sides are prepared_for a battle . Lockheed has hired two public relations firms to help ease public concerns . And a Tarzana-based law_firm representing nearly 200 residents is seeking an injunction to halt the project . &quot; Did you consider the prior experience these people have already had at the site for years ? &quot; asked David Casselman , one of the attorneys for the residents , during the hearing at the Airport Hilton in Burbank . AQMD senior manager Ben Shaw responded , &quot; There is a risk if we do nothing . . . a non-project is not a choice. &quot; Lockheed officials say the chances of anyone developing cancer are 3 in 1 million after a lifetime of exposure to the proposed system . That statistic , however , is of little comfort , say the people who live nearby . &quot; Lockheed contaminated the water and contaminated the ground and now wants to contaminate the air . It ' s the only thing left . It ' s ridiculous , &quot; said neighbor Dan Fournier , 26 . Caught in the middle are officials with the AQMD , the regional agency that regulates air_pollution . The city also has an interest because a cleanup plan must be in place before the property can be redeveloped . City officials are looking_for an outside consultant to review Lockheed ' s plan . Burbank Mayor Bill Wiggins had previously asked : &quot; What authority does the city have to tell the AQMD to turn these permits down ? &quot; Very little , according to Benjamin Kaufman , an attorney hired by the city to review Lockheed ' s cleanup effort . &quot; The city ' s ability to second-guess the AQMD on matters the state of California has said are AQMD matters is limited , &quot; he said . About the only authority the city has , Kaufman added , is to approve or deny a permit to build the 50-foot tower . The AQMD contends that the project uses the best available technology and meets the agency ' s regulations for treating chemicals in the soil , such_as carbon_tetrachloride , chloroform and methylene chloride . But the agency has not issued Lockheed a permit yet , citing the public concern . Vapor extraction systems are typically used by oil_companies . Volatile organic_compounds are removed from contaminated soil by underground wells , then filtered and released into the air . About 98 % of the treated contaminants in this case will be captured , said Carol Yuge , a Lockheed spokeswoman . The remainder will be pumped into the air 24 hours a day over the next seven to 10 years , she said . City officials are anxious to clean_up the 90-acre site , which they hope will become a center for retailers , post-production studios and light industry . However , Lockheed has been slow in selecting a developer , frustrating some at City_Hall . Said Wiggins : &quot; For every month or two months or three months it takes_to pick a developer , the retail market that could go_on that site is less and less because ( retailers ) locate somewhere else. &quot;</TEXT>
