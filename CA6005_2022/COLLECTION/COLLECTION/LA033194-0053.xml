   <HEADLINE> VENICE : COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF HISTORIC BOARDWALK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The boardwalk ( &quot; Boardwalk Blues , &quot; March 3 ) used to be one of the most interesting neighborhoods in Venice . It was a special place where the public had an opportunity to mingle with an iconoclastic community , where people could be themselves without being judged . This unique setting was then destroyed by Councilwoman Ruth Galanter so that a handful of boardwalk property_owners could maximize profits from their land holdings . Residential zones on the boardwalk were rezoned for intense commercial uses ; neighborhood housing was converted to stores . Petitions containing thousands of signatures from residents were submitted expressing opposition to the commercialization of the boardwalk . Community groups , acting through the city ' s local coastal planning process , opposed further commercialization of the boardwalk . Even Galanter signed one petition before she was elected . It didn ' t matter : She ignored the protests and threw all_of her political weight in support of profits for boardwalk property_owners . As a result of Galanter ' s negligence , abominable weekend traffic , overcrowding on the oceanfront , trash , noise and crime have changed the quality_of_life here and in the greater Venice community . Public safety , not renovation , is the issue on the boardwalk . If you think it is bad now , Galanter ' s plans for more commercialization will bring the boardwalk to its knees . There is no point in renovating the boardwalk until the commercial exploitation of the oceanfront is brought_to an end . That will happen only if people demonstrate their anger to Galanter or someone responsible replaces her at the next election . STEVE SCHLEIN Venice</TEXT>
