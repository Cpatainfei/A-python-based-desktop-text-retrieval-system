   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY : MOON SHIVERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> that ' s one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind . With those immortal words , Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong stepped_on the ghostly lunar surface , becoming the first man to walk on the moon . It was July 20 , 1969 , and the whole world sat enraptured in front of TV_sets as the haunting black-and-white images were beamed back to Earth . But few knew the real story behind America ' s 10-year race to beat the Soviet_Union to the moon . Until now . &quot; Moon_Shot , &quot; a four-hour TBS documentary , chronicles the fierce competition between the United States and the U.S.S.R. to put a man on the moon . The stories of two of the original Mercury 7 astronauts , Alan Shepard and the late Deke Slayton , explore the complexities and difficulties of the mission from their personal perspectives . Both Shepard and Slayton traveled in space and were grounded for several years because of health_problems . &quot; Moon_Shot &quot; features never-before-seen footage , archival photos from NASA and from personal collections of astronauts along with interviews with the astronauts attached_to the Mercury , Gemini and Apollo projects . The special is based on the new Turner Publishing book of the same name written by Shepard , Slayton and Jay Barbree and Howard Benedict . Barry Corbin , who plays astronaut Maurice Minifield on CBS ' &quot; Northern Exposure , &quot; narrates . Kirk Wolfinger , the producer and director of &quot; Moon_Shot , &quot; discussed the making of the documentary with Times Staff Writer Susan King . There are so many amazing stories in the documentary , especially about all_the near-misses in space . Were they public record ? All the stories of what happened in space were a matter of public record , but nobody ever talked_about it -- the near-mishaps , the near-accidents and the guys who almost didn ' t make_it back , especially in the early Mercury days . If you read the articles closely in the newspapers , you ' d get the details of that , but you had to really read for it . It ' s like we didn ' t want to tarnish the National Aeronautics and Space Adminsitration ' s reputation when everything else in the world looked so bad . NASA was this kind of shining beacon . These guys were test_pilots , so their attitude was , &quot; It ' s part of the business , why talk_about it ? &quot; It ' s only now when they are 65 and 70 years old that they are beginning to say to themselves , &quot; What the hell ? It ' s a good_story . We might as well tell it. &quot; You realize watching &quot; Moon_Shot &quot; just how heroic these astronauts were . Absolutely . I think these guys , whatever else gets said about them , for all their personal antics and test-pilot machismo , were real heroes . That took a lot of guts to climb_on top of one of those rockets , especially when you didn ' t know whether it was going_to go_up or down . John_Glenn , that guy was really brave . When he sat on top of that Atlas rocket , it had a one-in-four chance of going_up . I think that ' s pretty amazing . They had no idea what they were getting_into , none of them . They were test_pilots and this looked_liked the hottest ride going . They said , &quot; that ' s where I want to be and if I ' m going_to be there I want to be first. &quot; These guys were real heroes . It was a time we liked heroes . We just loved having heroes . While I think they were overwhelmed by ( celebrity ) at first , I don ' t think there wasn ' t a one of them who said , &quot; I can get used to this. &quot; Where did you obtain the extraordinary footage used in the documentary ? Almost all was gotten_out of the Johnson Space Center . A lot of it has not been seen before . It simply has to do with the tack of the story that we took . When we started to talk_about what story we wanted to do , I had had it up_to here with the kind of &quot; spiritually elevating all mankind , let ' s feel good about going_into space &quot; movie . I wanted to do something about who these guys were , what made them tick . Not one of these guys started off with the idea they were doing this for all mankind . It ' s every man for himself : &quot; I want to be the first man on the rocket. &quot; There was a tremendous spirit of camaraderie and getting the job done . They truly all really liked and respected each other , but , man , they were test_pilots . They wanted that seat and that was the name of the game . Not one of them to this day will deny it . These guys hate the movie &quot; The Right Stuff &quot; ( based on Tom Wolfe ' s book ) . They think the movie is totally wrong . They were all pretty angry the way the story was unwound . I think because of that movie -- and it was very fresh in their minds -- these guys were telling me stories I don ' t think they otherwise would have told me . I think we got &quot; the real stuff. &quot; &quot; Moon_Shot &quot; is seen_through Deke Slayton ' s eyes . Since he died a year ago of cancer , how involved was he in the documentary before his death ? I never met Deke . One of the devices we were going_to do dramatically in the documentary was we were going_to invent an astronaut . We were going_to call him a mythical astronaut who was to be an omnipresent narrator who was there on all_the missions . We were going_to write what we thought was a very clever device . Then Deke died . We looked_at ourselves . We had read everything that Deke had said and written , right down to his light bills . He had an incredible amount of insight and revelations which he shared while he was writing the book . We said , &quot; It ' s all here , so let ' s make Deke our storyteller. &quot; We fashioned the story as told through the perspective of Deke . He was the perfect person to tell the story .
