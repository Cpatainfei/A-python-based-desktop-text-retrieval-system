   <TEXT> HUMAN_RIGHTS WATCH WORLD REPORT 1994 : Events of 1993 ( Human_Rights Watch : $ 20 ; 389 pp. , paperback original ) . The organizations that issue this annual document -- Africa Watch , Americas Watch , Asia Watch , Helsinki Watch , Middle_East Watch -- exist to monitor abuses around world.After analyzing conditions in 68 countries in 1993 , the authors conclude that ongoing communal violence and the growing conceptual challenge to human_rights necessitate the appointment of a United Nations High_Commissioner for Human_Rights . The discussions include major developments within each country , any restrictions on monitoring , the work of regional organizations and U.S. policy toward the country . The inclusion of the latter suggests that the United States has somehow become the sole guarantor of human_rights throughout the world -- a role neither Congress nor the people ever voted to assume . No other industrialized country is subjected_to comparable scrutiny of its foreign_policy . The section on Japan ignores discrimination against people of Korean ancestry and the mistreatment of the aboriginal Ainu .</TEXT>
