   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES : NATURAL BORN FLAP OVER , YES , VIOLENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Oliver Stone ' s upcoming &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; could easily be dubbed Natural Born Jitters , considering Warner Bros. ' and the MPAA ratings board ' s worries about the film ' s violence . Even Quentin Tarantino , who has made his name with such ultraviolent films as &quot; Reservoir Dogs &quot; ( which he wrote and directed ) and &quot; True Romance &quot; ( which he wrote ) , and who wrote &quot; Killers ' &quot; original screenplay , has taken only a story credit and distanced himself from the movie . &quot; This movie makes ' True Romance ' look_like ' Bambi , ' &quot; says one Warners source . &quot; True Romance , &quot; the 1993 film that also explored the murder spree of two lovers , also had entanglements with the ratings board over violence before finally being awarded an R . But Stone , never one to shy from tackling violent projects ( &quot; Platoon , &quot; &quot; Scarface , &quot; &quot; Midnight Express &quot; ) , was candid in an interview about his film and the talk surrounding it . It is scheduled to be released Aug . 19 . The film , which stars Woody Harrelson , Juliette Lewis , Robert Downey Jr . and Tommy Lee Jones , centers_on a serial-killer couple ( Harrelson and Lewis ) and a despicable talk_show host ( Downey ) who spends his time tromping around the country interviewing vicious killers for his tabloid show , &quot; American Maniacs. &quot; Warners and Stone call it a satire on the media ' s insatiable appetite for broadcasting violence , desensitizing its viewing public to horror and making heroes out of anti-heroes . In fact , the juxtaposition of the film ' s being released in the wake of the nation ' s morbid curiosity about the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman , and the subsequent arrest of O.J. Simpson , has given the controversy an even more surreal feel , says Stone . &quot; When I started making this movie I completely envisioned this as satire , &quot; says Stone . &quot; Then this . . . reality . . . happens. &quot; Says Warners spokesman Rob Friedman : &quot; Oliver ' s movie is like looking through a warped mirror . Every frame of this movie is surreal . Its intent is to provoke thinking_about what ' s going_on with the media today . During sweeps week two major networks had interviews with serial_killers , Jeffrey Dahmer and Charles Manson . Donahue wanted to air an execution . So Oliver ' s movie is tame by what ' s being aired . . . but it ' s something he believes we will eventually be seeing on TV. &quot; Warners says the studio ' s concerns were ironed_out with Stone before the film was submitted to the ratings board , which has awarded it an R . He insists any disputes Stone had with executives over the violence were no worse than the typical disputes directors have with the studio over other films . Stone says his is not so_much about violence , but &quot; the forces of chaos. &quot; Therein lies the rub . &quot; The chaos is what the ratings board had concerns about , &quot; Stone says . &quot; When ( the board ) saw the prison riot that was filmed with real prisoners , they got a little concerned . It ( exemplified ) an accumulation of madness. &quot; Stone says he had known about Warners ' policy of not releasing NC-17 movies , only R-rated ones , before submitting the film to be rated . Studio sources say that the director and executives squabbled over cutting certain scenes . Warners Chairman Robert Daly , in particular , had voiced concerned about the nonstop violence . Stone met with the ratings board five times and cut several scenes from the film before it was finally rated R . One cut was a shot of Downey ' s being shot in the hand , then the camera shot other scenes through the hole in the hand . Stone said the uncut version of the film was &quot; screened for kids in Seattle . They laughed_at that scene because of the way it is set_up . It is violence done satirically. &quot; There are other scenes that some consider questionable , which remain in the film . One has Lewis ' character ' s shooting a convenience_store clerk in the head after having_sex with him on the hood of a car . Another shows a knife being thrown through a plate_glass window and landing in a fleeing victim ' s back . The shot follows the knife as if the camera were riding_on it . &quot; These scenes , again , are shot as satiric violence , &quot; says Stone . &quot; That knife scene couldn ' t happen and you don ' t take it seriously. &quot; What the viewer will see is a movie very different from what Tarantino intended , say those close to the young writer / director . Tarantino ' s spokesman says that Tarantino has no desire to talk_about any differences he and Stone had and that he hasn ' t seen the picture . ( His latest directorial effort , &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; will be released in October. ) &quot; Look , Quentin had written this several years before , &quot; says Stone . &quot; And the producers , Jane Hamsher and Don Murphy , brought this to me . The structure and characters are there , but this is a film that addresses why violence is . . . it ' s not just another film about violence. &quot;</TEXT>
