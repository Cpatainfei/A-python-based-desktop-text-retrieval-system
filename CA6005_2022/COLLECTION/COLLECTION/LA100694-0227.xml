   <HEADLINE> FATAL ATTRACTIONS : EXPERTS SEE LINK IN HOW SOME CULTS CAN TURN KILLER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The scenes of 48 dead in picturesque Swiss villages Wednesday bore striking resemblances to those on a Texas plain and in a steamy jungle in Guyana -- previous sites of a fatal conjunction of religion , violence and communal living . In 1978 , 913 followers of the Rev . Jim Jones died in Jonestown , Guyana . Most appeared to have taken their own lives by ingesting grape drink laced with potassium_cyanide . Others were shot . And last year in Waco , Tex. , about 80 members of David Koresh ' s Branch Davidians died in a hail of gunfire and a blaze that followed a standoff with federal authorities . What can drive groups like these to such acts ? From Jonestown to Waco , and perhaps now to the_Swiss towns , cult members appear to be drawn to a charismatic leader and to anticipate a cataclysmic upheaval or feel a threat from outsiders , according to experts interviewed Wednesday . The members see no life for themselves outside the group . &quot; I am always correcting the term ' mass suicide , ' &quot; said Margaret Thaler Singer , a San Francisco clinical_psychologist best known for her study of the 1978 Jonestown massacre . &quot; . . . It ' s done at the direction of a powerful leader who so controls information and information sources that he ' s the only one talking to them and urging them on . Often , they ' re at his mercy because there are armed guards. &quot; Most cults are peaceful . Indeed , some become respected in their communities and even major denominations . Methodists and Mormons , for example , were once considered cult groups . But in a minority of cases , the mixture of doomsday thinking and a charismatic leader can be a mutual fatal attraction . Singer said that cult leaders &quot; bind &quot; and gain control over followers by depicting the outside world as a threat . Koresh , for example , had predicted that his followers would all die by fire , and Jones had apparently convinced his followers to participate in what he called &quot; revolutionary suicide &quot; as the answer to outside threats . Little is known about the_Swiss group , known as the Cross and Rose , discovered Wednesday , and experts cautioned against drawing conclusions based upon the information initially available . However , early accounts said that the Cross and Rose seemed to isolate itself . Residents of nearby villages said they had no idea the group was involved in cult behavior . The group ' s apparent founder , Luc Jouret -- a practitioner of homeopathic medicine -- fled to Switzerland in 1993 when authorities in Canada , where he lived , issued a nationwide arrest_warrant for him after he was charged with weapons possession and conspiracy . It was unknown if Jouret was among the victims Wednesday . It was also reported that both the Cross and Rose and another group Jouret founded in Canada , the Order of the Solar Temple , held apocalyptic views . Religion experts said Wednesday that if the Canadian and Swiss groups held such views , their members would probably have other traits in common with the followers of Jones and Koresh . Factors such_as isolation can make members of cults particularly susceptible to group wishes , according to Robert Ellwood , a professor of religion at USC and author of several books on religion , including &quot; Alternative Altars. &quot; &quot; It ' s like an implosion . They are pulled_back from the world and get so_much into their own ideology and own human_relationships within the group that . . . they can ' t think_of themselves being a person with a life apart from the group , &quot; Ellwood said . When something happens that appears to threaten the existence of the group , Ellwood said , there comes a point when suicide seems the only way_out . &quot; In a way , I don ' t quite get_it , &quot; Ellwood added . &quot; If it were a mass suicide , then you would say ( a leader ) had tremendous power . But if he and his henchmen just went_out and shot them , that ' s maybe mass_murder but it doesn ' t mean he had any mental power over them . He ' s just the one that has the guns. &quot; Another expert joined Ellwood in pointing_out that such traits as social isolation , constant focus_on the group and an intense relationship with a leader do not necessarily lead to violence or death . &quot; Don ' t be too quick to draw analogies , &quot; said J . Gordon Melton , author of The Encyclopedia of American Religions and head of the Institute for the Study of American Religion in Santa Barbara . Melton noted that there are hundreds of groups with such traits whose activities do not culminate in mass_murder or suicide .</TEXT>
