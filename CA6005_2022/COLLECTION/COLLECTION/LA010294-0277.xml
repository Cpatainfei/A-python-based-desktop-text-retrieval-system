   <HEADLINE> CREATIVITY IN THE WAR ON CRIME ; GIFTS-FOR-GUNS EXCHANGE COLLECTS MORE THAN 700 FIREARMS IN NEW YORK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A successful gifts-for-guns swap that has attracted more_than 700 firearms in a violent , drug-ridden area of New York City should be expanded to other cities . Every gun that ' s off our streets makes America a tiny bit safer . The National Assn . for the Advancement of Colored People , which donated $ 5 # 000 to the New York effort , plans to expand the program beyond New York , through its extensive system of branches , by working with authorities in the communities . The Rev . Ben Chavis , executive_director of the NAACP , and Fernando Mateo , founder of the New York effort , will begin with a visit to Los Angeles this week . Chavis said last Tuesday that the civil_rights organization will ask businesses to support this campaign . NAACP leaders now view freedom from violence as a civil_right . Sadly , violence is pervasive in most cities . Americans own -- legally and illegally -- more_than 200 million firearms of various kinds . No gifts-for-guns exchange will rid the United States of all firearms , but good riddance to every one that such offers attract . The successful New York program was set_up recently by Mateo , a civic-minded young businessman . He decided to do something after his 14-year-old son indicated he would willingly trade his Christmas_presents to get guns off the streets . Mateo quickly got help from businesses , including the major retailer Toys R Us , and from police_officers and concerned citizens who donated more_than $ 60 # 000 . The deal in New York : Anyone who turned_in a gun by the end of Christmas_Day would get a certificate for toys . The offer later included gasoline , athletic shoes and other goods . Teen-agers , parents and grandparents responded , taking_to a local police_station weapons that included machine_guns , hunting rifles and semiautomatic_pistols . Police_officers wisely asked no questions , and they were pleasantly surprised by the turnout . Police_Commissioner Raymond Kelly said , &quot; Clearly this program has national implications. &quot; He also said , &quot; What we can ' t measure are the lives that have been saved . . . the crippling injuries that were not sustained. &quot; The success of the initial toys-for-guns appeal prompted further generosity . Foot Locker , a chain of athletic shoe_stores , donated gift certificates worth $ 25 # 000 . The New York exchange program is expected to continue through Jan . 6 . In Los Angeles , Ticketmaster has given_away hundreds of tickets to concerts and sports events in exchange for firearms . Elsewhere , police have used buy-back programs to collect weapons ; as part of the deal , officials make no attempt to trace the guns to any crimes . Reducing gun violence will take such creative exchanges and buy-backs , but it will also take much tougher laws -- laws that all but eliminate the private possession of handguns and assault weapons .</TEXT>
