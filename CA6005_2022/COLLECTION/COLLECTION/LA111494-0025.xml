   <HEADLINE> A GAIN AGAINST AIDS THAT CARRIES ETHICAL QUESTIONS ; SHOULD HIV-POSITIVE PREGNANT WOMEN FACE MANDATORY AZT THERAPY ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A rare piece of good news from the AIDS front poses difficult ethical questions : Should pregnant women be compelled to take the test for the virus that causes AIDS and then , if they test positive , be required to undergo AZT drug therapy to help save their unborn children from the disease ? After all , pregnant women must be tested for syphilis ; why not for the far deadlier AIDS ? Until now , there was no reliable means of preventing the transmission of the virus to the child . But a new study , cited by President Clinton Thursday in naming Patricia S . Fleming as the new AIDS czar , has shown that aggressive intervention to treat both the pregnant woman and the newborn with antiviral AZT can dramatically reduce the infant ' s chances of acquiring the virus . The lesson is clear : Doctors should urge all pregnant women to take the HIV test and then draw into treatment those who carry the virus . However , any attempt to make either the test or treatment mandatory at this time would be counterproductive , probably deterring poor women from seeking perinatal care . The new study found that maternal transmission to newborns can be cut by two-thirds if infected women are given AZT during pregnancy and delivery and the infants themselves are continued on AZT for six weeks . The researchers took the unusual step of ending the experiment early to publish the findings . While encouraging , the findings have caused unease . The prevailing law and ethics of medicine today dictate that no one can be subjected_to tests or therapy without informed consent . In California , even rapists cannot be forced to take AIDS tests ; how could pregnant women be ? The new study shakes those principles of privacy and confidentiality , for the treatment benefits not the mother but her child , who to avoid AIDS surely would consent if he or she could . Last year in New York , an uproar ensued over demands for mandatory HIV testing of newborns because that would violate the privacy of the mother . The new study sharpens the issue in that it offers not just treatment but a means of preventing the disease altogether . The study -- which involved 44 research hospitals in the United States and France , including those of UCLA and USC -- does have limits . It says nothing about the possible long-term negative side_effects of AZT or whether the method is effective when mothers have full-blown AIDS . Nonetheless , the U.S. Public Health Service is expected soon to urge doctors to offer HIV tests to all pregnant women and then counsel AZT therapy for those who test positive . Only 1 # 000 to 2 # 000 babies are born with HIV yearly in the United States , or less than . 05 % of all births . But the number is growing , and in Los Angeles one of every 1 # 000 pregnant women has HIV , one in 160 among African Americans . For now we agree that mandatory testing is not needed . But it may be , should the numbers multiply . The tougher question is whether infected women should be compelled to take therapy to save their children . After all , it is estimated that it costs from $ 35 # 000 to $ 75 # 000 a year in hospital fees to treat a child with AIDS but only about $ 3 # 000 to apply the AZT therapy likely to prevent the disease . It would not be legal to compel treatment now , nor advisable . We have come a long way since the Supreme Court authorized states to sterilize retarded people involuntarily . How could a woman be made to take_five doses of AZT a day unless she were jailed or forcibly hospitalized ? The larger public benefits if authorities ensure privacy and confidentiality , rather than drive people out of the health system with coercion . Most HIV-infected women are poor , women who normally get little or no perinatal care . The challenge here is to reach_out to them and present them with the best alternatives . Doctors at UCLA say such women mostly are quite willing to undergo AZT therapy for their infants when informed of the potential benefits . A breakthrough has been achieved , one that promises to interrupt the spread of AIDS . With 1 million children infected worldwide , no speedy progress will be made in underdeveloped countries . But a good start has been made . New Hope on AIDS Probability of HIV infected women transmitting to their infants . With AZT Treatment : 8.3 % With Placebo : 25.5 % Source : New England Journal of Medicine</TEXT>
