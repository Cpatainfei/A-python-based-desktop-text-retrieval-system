   <HEADLINE> MOVIES ; IF EVERYBODY HAD AN OCEAN . . . ; YES , IT ' S ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT PEOPLE WITH A LOVE FOR WEARING THONGS . ' ENDLESS SUMMER II ' ARRIVES THREE DECADES AFTER ITS ACCLAIMED PREDECESSOR CELEBRATED A LIFESTYLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s been 30 years since director-surfer Bruce Brown released his epic surf film &quot; Endless Summer , &quot; which chronicled the travels of Robert August and Mike Hynson as they journeyed around the world looking_for the perfect wave . That movie , made_for $ 50 # 000 using one windup 16-millimeter camera , was one of the Top 10 box-office hits of 1964 and went_on to earn more_than $ 30 million worldwide . Released in the same year as &quot; Ride the Wild Surf , &quot; &quot; Beach Blanket Bingo &quot; and &quot; Surf Party , &quot; not to mention &quot; Zorba the Greek , &quot; &quot; Endless Summer &quot; eclipsed its companion surf flicks and is still hailed as one of the purest expressions of the sport . Now , three decades later , Brown has returned with &quot; Endless Summer II , &quot; which opens Friday . Cut from the same cloth as its predecessor , &quot; ES II &quot; follows a pair of new surfers who represent the two main styles in surfing . Robert ( Wingnut ) Weaver is a classic long-boarder , who goes_with the wave , carving graceful turns . Pat O ' Connell represents the new surfing style , using a short board to &quot; shred &quot; the waves with sharp turns and radical maneuvers . With Weaver and O ' Connell , Brown visits many of the places he explored in 1964 , noting with both enthusiasm and wisdom the development in the changing surfscape . Weekend surfers Kalle Matso and Scott White explore some of the issues surrounding &quot; Endless Summer II &quot; and surf films in_general , including : What is the appeal of surf movies versus other sports films ? How does the &quot; surfumentary &quot; format compare with those surfing films that have fictional_characters and actors who can ' t surf ? And , of course , does &quot; Endless Summer II &quot; appeal just to surfers or is there something for inlanders as well ? * White : What I ' m wondering is if filmgoers in the ' 90s will pay $ 7 to see a documentary on two guys who just love to surf . The last big surfing movie was &quot; Point Break &quot; in 1991 , and the only reason it was made was because it had this slick Hollywood story line and two popular leading men -- non-surfers Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze . Matso : I think it ' s kind of cool to see a movie that doesn ' t have some hastily constructed plot_line that is just there to give a framework for the main activity . The filmmakers could have easily created a tawdry love triangle plot where some native falls_in_love with Pat but has more respect for Wingnut . It would certainly broaden the appeal of the movie and make_it more commercial . White : On the other hand , adding some trumped_up story line would have negative effects as well . One of the cool things about the movie is that there are these candid discussions about the art of surfing with superstars like Kelly Slater , Gerry Lopez and Tommy Curren . Otherwise , you have some hack_writer ' s inaccurate conception of what surfing ' s all about , squeezed in between scenes of Patrick Swayze splashing_around like a 3-year-old in a bathtub . Matso : Well , we ' ve already established that &quot; Point Break &quot; sucked from a surfing perspective . But other movies , like &quot; North Shore &quot; and &quot; Big Wednesday , &quot; have been successful in combining story lines with good surfing action . The plots served as nice buffers for radical ocean scenes . White : I ' m not saying I don ' t like films that mix fiction with surfing . I ' m just stoked to see a documentary about surfing because it ' s a misunderstood sport , and one that has spawned a large and rapidly growing American subculture . Surfing ' s influences on America can be seen in everything from the way people dress to the way they speak . Still , I can ' t think_of any sport that has generated such a strong -- and sometimes negative -- image . Matso : that ' s true . As soon as people find_out that you ' re a surfer , or even from Southern California , they immediately decide you ' ve spent way too_much time in the sun and start speaking very slowly . White : Yeah . If you tell people you ' re from Augusta , they don ' t ask you if you ' re &quot; one of those golfer dudes. &quot; If I mention to anyone outside of California that I surf occasionally , I automatically inherit this lame &quot; slacker &quot; attitude a la Jeff Spicoli from &quot; Fast Times at Ridgemont High. &quot; People are very surprised that my mantra isn ' t &quot; Hey , Bud . Let ' s party ! &quot; Matso : But doesn ' t every sport have stereotypical attributes ? White : No . People don ' t say &quot; Oh . He ' s such a baseball_player &quot; unless they ' re referring to someone who has great hand-eye coordination and is 20 pounds overweight . Matso : But it ' s not just image . Even in terms of mechanics , surfing is fundamentally different from most activities . Few sports besides surfing involve dynamic motion by both the athlete and the medium ( i.e. , the ocean ) . White : Exactly . Surfing is completely dependent_on the whims of nature and that has an effect on the surfers themselves , who are often unusually reverent of the environment , spontaneous , patient and posses a weird penchant for thongs . Matso : And these traits come_through in both &quot; Endless Summers &quot; and most of the other big surfing films that have come_out of Hollywood in the last 30 years . &quot; Big Wednesday , &quot; &quot; North Shore &quot; and even &quot; Point Break &quot; throw_out the concept of these deep , pensive &quot; soul &quot; surfers . Patrick Swayze ' s character is called Bodhisattva because he ' s so into the metaphysics of surfing -- that and armed robbery . White : Hollywood certainly didn ' t invent the soulful quality that exudes from surf movies . All you have to do is grab a longboard , get_in the ocean and catch a_few waves and you realize that surfing is undeniably more spiritual than truck-pulling . Matso : Besides surfing , I ' d have to say that baseball is the only pastime that evokes these profound feelings . Look_at &quot; The Natural &quot; and &quot; Field of Dreams. &quot; White : But the reasons for that are more historical . There ' s nothing empirically spiritual about baseball . Just when you really start to discover things about yourself , someone charges the mound . I really think that surfing has some kind of intangible draw . The first &quot; Endless Summer &quot; was released in 1964 and was one of the top 10 grossing films of the year . How do you explain that ? Matso : It was competing with &quot; McHale ' s Navy. &quot; How bad could it do ? Also , surfing was such a novel sport in 1964 . Today , you can ' t even call inlanders &quot; Barney &quot; because they know they ' re being insulted . White : I don ' t think novelty is the only reason people liked &quot; Endless Summer. &quot; Both the original film and &quot; Endless Summer II &quot; can be enjoyed on many levels . I thought it was cool that the sequel follows roughly the same path pioneered by the original 30 years ago . It ' s interesting to see the enormous changes that took_place in the interim , especially in Africa . In the first movie , the locals were mostly agrarians . In &quot; Endless Summer II , &quot; they ' re selling time-share condos . Matso : It ' s just hard for me to believe that this movie will be well-received by the non-surfing community . White : Why ? Surfing movies do very well in parts of the world that are extremely alienated from surfing . The title of this movie alone is enough to hook Scandinavians , most of whom would be ecstatic for a two-week summer . Matso : that ' s true . Perhaps , as a surfer from Southern California , I ' m taking the aesthetics of the sport for granted . White : Everything that is associated with surfing -- sunshine , clear water , athletic people -- has universal appeal . I mean , look_at the worldwide success of &quot; Baywatch. &quot; It ' s one of the best-rated series in Germany , right behind &quot; Wolfgang and der Man. &quot; Matso : I ' ve heard other people say that the &quot; Endless Summer &quot; series is like Warren Miller ' s ski films , with more babes and fewer chairlift antics . But I see some real differences between the two . Most importantly , almost everyone dabbles in skiing . Surfing , on the other hand , is much more of an all-or-nothing sport . Either you don ' t surf and never intend to , or you spend all your lunch breaks checking the tide chart in the Metro section . White : Your point being . . . ? Matso : That &quot; Endless Summer II &quot; might have the most polarized audience ever . Because of the very nature of surfing , people will either worship this movie , or think it ' s a mildly interesting travel film that spends too_much time in the water . White : I disagree . I don ' t believe that people have to have an affinity for a sport to appreciate and be moved by it . There is something inherently thrilling in watching two guys in search of the perfect ride , a search that takes them to both familiar and exotic places all_over the world . I also think it ' s a tribute to surfing ' s dynamic quality that a film like this is even made . I doubt that we will ever see a movie about two track_and_field athletes entitled &quot; Endless Vaulting. &quot; That , to me , is the real reason that &quot; Endless Summer &quot; and &quot; Endless Summer II &quot; were made . . . to show that surfing isn ' t just standing on a board . Matso : Aren ' t you just saying that surfing is much more_than a sport ? That it ' s way_of_life , an attitude ? White : that ' s exactly what I ' m saying . Did a surfer say that ? Matso : No -- Jeff Spicoli did_in &quot; Fast Times at Ridgemont High. &quot;</TEXT>
