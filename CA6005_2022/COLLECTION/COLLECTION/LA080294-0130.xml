   <HEADLINE> REPORT SEES SOUTHLAND BOUNCING_BACK ; ECONOMY : THE SURVEY SAYS THE REGION IS POISED FOR A SPURT IN JOBS AND PRODUCTION OVER THE NEXT DECADE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Southern California , still struggling to recover from a punishing recession and the chronic loss of aerospace jobs , is poised for job and economic_growth that could outpace the nation through the next decade , according to an economic report released Monday . The report by the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy projects that employment in the Los Angeles metropolitan area could climb 27.5 % between 1993 and 2005 . Fueled by increased construction and retail spending in the short term and fundamental economic_growth in the long term , such growth would amount to 1.78 million new jobs , the report says . That would represent the largest expansion in terms of economic production and the fastest rate of job growth in the United States , the report says . The region includes Los Angeles , Orange , Ventura , San Bernardino , Riverside and Imperial counties . The projections appear optimistic compared to previous statewide projections , including one in June from the UCLA Business Forecasting Project , which predicted that the state ' s non-farm jobs would remain nearly flat in 1994 and grow only 1.5 % in 1995 and 2.4 % in 1996 . &quot; The question is whether the historic recession that we hope is over now has lasting repercussions for the California and Los Angeles economies , &quot; said David Hensley , an economist with Salomon Bros . in New York . &quot; My view is that it does. &quot; Stephen Levy , the center ' s director and the report ' s principal author , said the long-term projections hinge in part on policy_changes that would improve the region ' s education system , upgrade telecommunications and other infrastructure and reduce crime and air_pollution . &quot; The opportunities are not automatic , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re arguing for where the policy focus should be. &quot; The report is one of the first to make a detailed , long-term projection for the hard-hit Southern California region . So far , the metropolitan Los Angeles area has had the state ' s largest economic decline , losing 500 # 000 jobs from 1990 to 1993 , the report says . In a separate report last month , the center predicted that the entire state would add 3.7 million jobs between 1993 and 2005 , an average gain of 310 # 000 jobs a year and an overall increase of 27.2 % , outpacing the nation ' s predicted 17.5 % gain . The report ' s outlook in the near term is also in keeping with recent data suggesting that the region is finally pulling_out of a prolonged economic slump , though aerospace job losses are expected to continue and a round of military base closings is in the offing . On Monday , Dataquick Information Services reported that statewide building activity rose in June to its highest level since 1991 , with a total of $ 938 million provided by lending_institutions to construction projects , an increase of 32.9 % over June , 1993 . The report reiterates arguments that for the long term , the region ' s economic future will be based on foreign trade , professional services , high-tech manufacturing and entertainment and tourism . Through 2005 , professional services could provide the biggest job growth , with 306 # 300 new jobs , the report says . Wholesale trade and transportation could add 119 # 900 jobs , and entertainment-tourism could add 137 # 600 . Southland Job Growth Jobs in Southern California are expected to increase 27.5 % between 1993 and 2005 to a total of 8.25 million , according to a report by the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy . Job growth and projections for the three biggest industry groups , in millions : Manufacturing : 1.05 Trade : 1.72 Services : 2.58 Sources : Employment Development Department ; Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy</TEXT>
