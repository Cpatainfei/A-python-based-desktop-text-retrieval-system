   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 ; WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / GROUP C PREVIEW ; COMING TO ITS OWN DEFENSE ; GERMANY HAS BEEN AT OR NEAR THE TOP IN THE LAST FIVE WORLD CUPS AND THAT ISN ' T EXPECTED TO CHANGE THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the last quarter-century , Germany has been the dominant force in international soccer . No other nation has come_close , not Brazil , not Argentina , not anyone . Those wishing to contest that claim need only to look_at the Germans ' record over the past two decades . To say it is impressive is a huge understatement . Consider : Germany has won the World Cup twice in that time ( 1974 and 1990 ) , finished second twice ( 1982 and 1986 ) and third once ( 1970 ) . Germany also has won the European Championship twice in that time ( 1972 and 1980 ) , finished second twice ( 1976 and 1992 ) and third once ( 1988 ) . Brazil , previously the best team in the world , has stumbled badly over the past 20 years . Its high point was achieved in Mexico in 1970 when it won the World Cup for the third time . Argentina , meanwhile , has been a formidable challenger , but even staunch Argentine supporters would have to admit their country ' s record , while excellent , is not as_good_as Germany ' s . So what is the Germans ' secret ? How does the country year after year manage to produce national teams that invariably are favored to win whatever tournament they enter ? Franz Beckenbauer , who led the Germans to their 1974 World Cup triumph as team captain and coached them to their 1990 victory , believes the answer lies_in the national character . The German players are not better than anyone else , Beckenbauer argues , but they have self-confidence and a never-give-up attitude that demonstrates itself time and again on the field . Germany can be very dangerous when it is trailing . In perhaps the most famous example , it was down , 2-0 , to Argentina in the 1986 World Cup_final in Mexico_City , but fought_back to tie the score before eventually losing , 3-2 . Now , Beckenbauer ' s successor , Berti Vogts , is preparing to take_on the most difficult assignment in soccer : successfully defending the World Cup . The feat has been achieved twice : by Italy , which won back-to-back titles in 1934 and 1938 , and by Brazil , which matched that achievement in 1958 and 1962 . But Vogts , a defender who was nicknamed &quot; The Terrier &quot; and who was a member of Germany ' s 1974 World Cup winner , believes his team has the ability to retain its crown . To begin with , much has happened since that hot night in 1990 when a penalty-kick goal by Andreas Brehme was all that separated Lothar Matthaeus ' Germany from Diego Maradona ' s Argentina in Rome ' s Olympic Stadium . For one thing , Germany is reunited , East and West having come_together politically and in a soccer sense three winters ago . That gives Vogts a bigger pool of players from which to choose , although only a_few former East_German players -- notably Matthias Sammer -- have successfully made the transition . More important is the fact that many of the 1990 veterans are still on the team , including goalkeeper Bodo Illgner , defenders Guido Buchwald and Juergen Kohler , midfielders Thomas Haessler and Matthaeus and forwards Juergen Klinsmann , Karlheinz Riedle and , somewhat surprisingly , 34-year-old Rudi Voeller . A new generation of stars also is coming_into its own . Look_for players such_as Stefan Effenberg and Andreas Moeller to have considerable impact in the tournament . Moeller inspired Germany to a 2-1 victory over Brazil in Cologne last year in a match that was not only Germany ' s 600th international but also Matthaeus ' 104th , breaking Beckenbauer ' s record . Moeller , a creative midfielder who will be relied_on to provide the ammunition for strikers Klinsmann and Riedle in the World Cup , scored the game-winner and turned_in an excellent performance against an admittedly weak Brazilian team that lacked Bebeto and Romario . Still , his performance encouraged Vogts , who has not been afraid to experiment with his lineup since a lackluster Germany finished second to Denmark in the 1992 European Championship in Sweden . Germany ' s defense has been Vogts ' main concern , especially with central defenders Buchwald and Koehler being older and less nimble . The latest adjustment the coach has tried is to move Matthaeus from midfield to sweeper , and the move seems to be working reasonably well . Unlike other nations , which can afford to slip occasionally and not be too heavily criticized , Germany , as world champion , is expected to be perfect every time it takes_the_field . The German press is relentless in pointing_out bad performances . &quot; The team is always under pressure , &quot; Moeller said . &quot; People expect first-class performances. &quot; The criticism of Germany has always been that it does not play attractive soccer . Effective , certainly , but not attractive . The Germans rely_on superb organization and tactical discipline , excellent physical condition and a fearless approach to the game . They are always a difficult team to beat , but they can also be a difficult team to watch , especially for those who prefer the fluid skills and unexpected improvisations of , say , Brazil or Colombia . But Germany does have its skilled players . Haessler , who is blessed with an astonishing free_kick , is but one example . Another is Klinsmann , whose speed and deadly shot make him Germany ' s most dangerous forward . But Germany has had trouble scoring goals over the past few months and Vogts has tried all sorts of combinations up front . It ' s not for want of trying , however . Anyone who has watched the team in practice knows how each German player loves firing the ball at the net with all_the power he can muster . Lately , however , not that many shots have gone_in . Losses to Argentina last December and to Ireland last month have Vogts alerted to the fact that all is not well , that the team still needs some fine-tuning . Even a 5-1 victory over Austria in the team ' s final preparatory match before leaving Europe did not allay his fears . &quot; We will not have opponents ( in the World Cup ) who will give us a victory on a plate like today , &quot; he said . &quot; We will not be able to become world champions with a performance like this . We will have to perform much better. &quot; Wednesday , Germany scored a 2-0 victory over Canada in Toronto . Despite obvious superiority , Germany still failed to fire on all cylinders . &quot; We failed to take a lot of chances , &quot; Vogts said . &quot; We can ' t do that against Bolivia ( in Saturday ' s opening match ) . &quot; Matthaeus was less worried . &quot; There is more in this team than we have shown , &quot; he said . &quot; It is important to take your chances , but the team has played fluidly . I ' m still confident . &quot; It is not quite there yet , but we will be where we want to be for the World Cup. &quot; Brazil is the oddsmakers ' ( and Vogts ' ) favorite to win the World Cup . But when the tournament starts , Germany will be right there . If the past quarter-century has taught soccer fans anything , it ' s that fact .</TEXT>
