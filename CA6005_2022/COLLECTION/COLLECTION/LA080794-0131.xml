   <HEADLINE> CRUISING : NORTH_AMERICA ; SAILING INTO FALL ; MORE CRUISES ARE LINING_UP TO CAPTURE THE COLORS OF AUTUMN BLAZING CLOSE TO HOME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This tiny seaside village seems at anchor in the shadow of the cruise_ship , rather than the other way around . Even the tender that ferries passengers to shore is bigger than the lobster boats tied_up along the pier . But giant liners like the Cunard Crown Monarch are calling commonly these days at picture-postcard ports along the rugged coastline of New England and eastern Canada . &quot; We ' ve been to the Caribbean three times , &quot; said Ellen McCrories of Gaithersburg , Md. , as she and her husband strolled the streets of Provincetown on a sightseeing shore excursion last fall . &quot; We ' ve been through the ( Panama ) Canal . This is a nice , relaxing cruise that ' s close to home , but something different. &quot; Regular fall cruises have been offered in the Midwest since the late 1940s , with the Delta Queen Steamboat Co . now running two paddle-wheelers along the wooded Mississippi and its tributaries . But 10 years ago in New England , only three cruise_ships sailed the lonely ocean off the coast . In 1994 , 10 ships will ply the North Atlantic , most during fall foliage season , generally considered to be from mid-September to Columbus_Day . At least one more ship is expected to be added_to the lineup next year . &quot; A lot of the charm ( of these cruises ) is the history , &quot; said Ann Burguieres , spokeswoman for Regency Cruises , whose 836-passenger Regent Sun sails weekly , June to October , between New York and Montreal . &quot; You get a taste of Europe in Quebec and Nova Scotia . It ' s a great diversity of scenic opportunities and different types of cultures , yet it ' s not too far away. &quot; Cruise lines have been racing recently to be first to call_at ports in Maine , New Brunswick and Nova Scotia . Last year , Martha ' s Vineyard , Mass. , had a visit from Cunard ' s Crown Dynasty on its maiden voyage . This year , the Seabourn Pride added Kennebunkport , Me. , to its schedule . The ships snake through the narrow Cape_Cod Canal , past the pines and rugged cliffs of coastal Maine and through the Gulf of St . Lawrence , where blue_whales breach . They glide along the Saguenay River and stop in French Quebec . Port calls include isolated fishing villages in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and , in the U.S. , landfalls of the early European colonists . Passengers can disembark with relative ease in places like Bar Harbor , Me. ; Provincetown , Mass. , and trendy Newport , R.I. , while landlocked tourists in cars fume in traffic . Many of the ships ' New_England destinations are all but inaccessible by land or air in summertime and early fall . Still , stops are brief , and scheduled activities ashore occasionally superficial . One cruise line promises that passengers will &quot; meet a licensed Maine lobsterman &quot; in Bar Harbor , Me. , but they probably won ' t have time to see much of Acadia National_Park , the area ' s foremost natural attraction , with a quintessential mountains-meet-the-sea terrain . Some shore excursions are reasonably priced . Passengers on Crystal Cruises meet the Maine lobsterman for free , and on Regency Cruises ' Regent Sun , passengers can return from Montreal to New York by Amtrak train , through New England ' s inland fall foliage , for an add-on of $ 95 . Other side trips are pricier . One high-end example is_on the Seabourn Pride ; when it puts_in for a day at St . John ' s , Newfoundland , passengers can fly_by helicopter to Miramichi Bay in New Brunswick for a day of salmon fishing . The cost for the excursion : $ 700 per person . that ' s about the entire cost of a three-night , fall foliage cruise aboard the Delta Queen or the Mississippi Queen , the paddle-wheelers that operate_on the Ohio , Arkansas and Mississippi_rivers . Both ships hire a naturalist to point_out the highlights of the autumn scenery . The big draw is naturally the foliage , whose peak of color is easy to time , given a choice of frequent sailings . The paddle-wheelers depart Cincinnati , St . Louis and other heartland cities every three or four days . Timing is inevitably more difficult for cruise lines , which schedule their ships two years in_advance . Also , some North_America cruises cover a long , north-to-south stretch of coast , so while the leaves might be golden in Canada , by the time the ship sails to , say , New York they could still be summer green . But , in the words of Jim Godsman , president of the Cruise Lines International Assn. , &quot; Autumn , when the last crowds of summer vacationers have retreated , is quite possibly the best time to take a cruise , &quot; regardless of the color of the leaves . &quot; People can use that cruise as a great way to see those places they might later want to go_back and visit , &quot; in more depth , added Godsman , who said he cruised last autumn from Quebec to New York City . The major drawback to autumn cruising , then ? &quot; The weather , &quot; grunted Crown Monarch Capt . Lennart Jonsson , as we talked in his office aboard the Crown Monarch in Provincetown ' s harbor . Jonsson was navigating through a sea of paperwork on his desk after heavy winds had diverted the ship from Prince_Edward_Island to Sydney , Nova Scotia earlier in the cruise . Yet the crisp New England weather may be what you make_it . &quot; It ' s nice to get_out of the heat , &quot; said Carol Fluhart of Colleyville , Tex. , a passenger on the Crown Monarch . &quot; The Caribbean ? No , thank you. &quot; The pace of most of the Northeast cruises is slow , and the size of the ships that skim the craggy coast generally small . The ultra-luxury , all-suite Seabourn Pride , for example , carries just 200 passengers . &quot; You ' re not in a horde . It ' s not as frantic ( as on the larger ships ) , &quot; McCrories said of the 539-passenger Crown Monarch , whose sister_ship , the Cunard Line ' s Sagafjord , will take_over the New England route this year . &quot; People come aboard on Saturday afternoon . By Monday , everybody knows each other , &quot; said Stephen James , the Crown Monarch ' s cheerful executive chef and , as one of the only New Englanders on the crew , the man called_upon to interpret the native vernacular . Most of the ships making this New England run are small enough that all_the passengers can dine during one seating , or at least find a seat behind the windows that provide a view but also protection from the chill winds . The former Royal Viking Star spends its first fall as the refurbished Star Odyssey this year in New England and eastern Canada . Even the Queen Elizabeth_II makes an annual five-day visit to the former Colonies , a jazz cruise leaving from New York Sept . 19 and stopping in Bar Harbor , Me. , Halifax ( Nova Scotia ) and Newport , R.I. The trip will be lengthened to six days next year . The Holland-America Line will add a New England cruise in 1995 , according to a spokesman . For New England cruises , many people -- mainly East Coasters -- drive to the departure port instead of flying . According to the cruise lines , that keeps fares comparatively lower than on transoceanic , island-hopping cruises . &quot; In the luxury end of the market , the price is a bit lower , because you don ' t have to fold in the trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific air fare , &quot; said Mark Flager , spokesman for Royal Viking Line . &quot; The idea of getting_on a ship that delivers you to your door is irresistible , &quot; said Carol Supplee of Alexandria , Va. , who boarded the Crown Monarch there and cruised to Montreal . It was a shift away from European travel during the Gulf War that forced cruise lines to consider the Canadian / New England market . Capacity has quadrupled in 10 years , according to the cruise lines association , and the number of individual trips has soared from 42 to 72 . &quot; There weren ' t any cruises up here , that ' s why , &quot; is Jonsson ' s theory to explain the sudden interest in the market . &quot; People are discovering it now . It reminds me a lot of Alaska ( before Alaska cruising boomed ) . &quot; GUIDEBOOK : Autumn Cruising in North_America For the autumn cruises below , the cruise line telephone_numbers are good for general information ; actual bookings are_best done through a travel_agent that specializes in cruising .
