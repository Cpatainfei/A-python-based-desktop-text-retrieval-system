   <TEXT> In a desperate bid to quell spiraling pre-election violence , the government declared a sweeping state of emergency in Zulu-dominated Natal province Thursday and ordered a significant military_force deployed to ensure that balloting is possible in the strife-torn region . It is South_Africa ' s first_state of emergency since President Frederik W . de Klerk lifted far harsher nationwide emergency regulations in 1990 at the start of his dramatic campaign to end the legalized oppression of blacks under apartheid and usher_in parliamentary_democracy and black majority_rule . But the crackdown makes a confrontation almost inevitable with defiant Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi , the only black homeland leader who still opposes the nation ' s first all-race elections , to be held this month . His Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party has sworn to boycott the vote , ignore the new constitution and resist the new post-apartheid government . Announcing the decision at a news_conference in Pretoria , De Klerk urged the increasingly tense nation to &quot; remain very , very calm. &quot; Flanked by his defense minister and military chiefs , he added : &quot; We are in control . There is no need to panic. &quot; He cited reports of panic buying of food and gasoline in Johannesburg and other cities &quot; almost as if we were going_into a state of siege. &quot; The military later announced that at least 500 paratroopers and infantry soldiers will be deployed this weekend in the embattled eastern province , including the scattered areas within it that form the self-governing tribal homeland of KwaZulu . Natal is one of four provinces in South_Africa . The emergency gives police enhanced power to ban protests , detain suspects without trial , order curfews and seize weapons . Political meetings or demonstrations will be allowed only with permission from a magistrate , and the KwaZulu police controlled by Buthelezi will be confined to barracks . Buthelezi called the decree &quot; humiliating &quot; and warned that the estimated 7 million Zulus , the country ' s largest ethnic_group , would &quot; see it as an invasion &quot; if South_African soldiers and tanks moved_into their traditional stronghold . Buthelezi showed no signs of backing_down , insisting that the partial suspension of civil_rights only proves his point that his political enemies are determined to crush Zulu culture . He repeated his demand that elections be delayed until international mediators can adjudicate his demands for an autonomous Zulu state and restoration of a long-defunct Zulu kingdom . &quot; Everything that is happening now completely justifies our stand and vindicates us , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re being coerced through the barrel of a gun . We ' re starting another chapter of oppression. &quot; But Nelson Mandela , who is expected to become South_Africa ' s first black president after the April 26-28 elections , applauded the crackdown . &quot; Today ' s action has one purpose -- to stem the tide of violence which threatens to engulf us all , &quot; Mandela told a news_conference in Johannesburg , where a chaotic Zulu protest_march Monday resulted in violence that killed 53 people in the city and townships . He said the army would be fully mobilized and in &quot; complete control &quot; by early next week across Natal . Mandela ' s African National Congress was the target of three emergency decrees imposed by the ruling white minority regime in the 1960s and 1980s to ruthlessly crush black opposition to apartheid . Tens of thousands of people were arrested , including Mandela , who eventually spent 27 years in prison . The government has used far more limited powers several times in the last four years in localized trouble spots ; 11 &quot; unrest areas &quot; were declared Monday , for example , after the bloodshed in Johannesburg . The army has been used twice in the last month to take_over former tribal homelands created under white minority rule . But pacifying the much larger province of Natal may be far more difficult . It holds about one-fifth the country ' s 40 million people . And though Buthelezi has no formal army , KwaZulu has a well-armed police_force and training camps that have armed thousands of ardent Zulu guerrillas . Turf wars between local members of Inkatha and the ANC have grown steadily over the last decade , but the violence has exploded since Buthelezi stepped_up his anti-election rhetoric . At least 290 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in Natal and KwaZulu in March , a grim new record . Even as the bloodshed continued , an independent judicial commission revealed last month that rogue police officials had secretly sold rifles , mortars , grenades and other weapons to Inkatha leaders for distribution to anti-ANC death squads . De Klerk said his action in Natal and KwaZulu is not a takeover . &quot; Law and order will be maintained , and we will not allow anarchy to develop , &quot; he said . Under the interim constitution adopted last December , KwaZulu and the other homelands created under apartheid will officially cease to exist after the elections . The first black-led government will stop paying_for Buthelezi ' s perks , patronage and power base . Analysts questioned whether an emergency crackdown is warranted . The independent Human_Rights Commission condemned the decree , saying &quot; the emergency has placed a cloud_over the legitimacy of the elections. &quot; In meetings this week with election officials , Buthelezi gave half-hearted assurances that voting will be allowed_in Inkatha-controlled areas on Election_Day . But his followers have begun a brutal campaign of burning homes , stabbing election workers , attacking cars and disrupting ANC rallies .</TEXT>
