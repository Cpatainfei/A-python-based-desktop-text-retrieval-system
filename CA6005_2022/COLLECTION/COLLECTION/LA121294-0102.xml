   <HEADLINE> A TRICKY , STICKY SITUATION ; WHAT IS AN AMERICAN ICON ? ELVIS ? A MUSHROOM_CLOUD ? that ' s A DECISION FOR THE STAMP ADVISORY COMMITTEE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s time again for the ultimate test of what ' s in and what ' s out . Early next month , behind closed doors , the Citizens ' Stamp Advisory Committee will meet here to discuss who and what should appear on that singular place of national honor -- a U.S. postage_stamp . The issues are sticky . What about popular but tainted ? Think Elvis stamp , with its $ 36 million in revenue last year -- although other drug-using singers ( Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin ) were rejected . What about historic but tainted ? Think mushroom_cloud , an image on a stamp scheduled for 1995 that the Postal Service agreed to withdraw on Wednesday . These are difficult days in the increasingly difficult business of minting American icons . &quot; It is a burden , no doubt about it , &quot; says John Foxworth Jr. , the auto industry executive who chaired the World_War_II subcommittee that in the late 1980s chose a picture of an atomic blast for a stamp commemorating the 50th anniversary of the bombing on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . &quot; We recognized the atomic_bomb would be controversial , that some people would object . But we just didn ' t feel we could represent the end of World_War_II without depicting the event that ended the war , &quot; says Foxworth , who retired from the group in 1990 . Plenty of people , from Japanese officials to the U.S. State_Department , disagreed . President Clinton , who last month pressured the Postal Service into reinstating a Madonna and Child Christmas stamp after a national squawk about its discontinuance , also prevailed in the_matter of the bomb stamp . The White_House did not object to commemorating the bombings , but the artwork depicting the nuclear mushroom_cloud was a poor choice , said Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers . The Postal Service will substitute a stamp with a picture of Harry S . Truman announcing the end of the war . These controversies have raised provocative questions for the Stamp Advisory Committee and the country : Just who or what is an American icon ? There are some rules . A subject can ' t be commercial . It must have broad national appeal . It can ' t be a living person . The subject must be American , or at least American-related . It shouldn ' t be religious ( with the exception , it appears , of Madonnas ) . Major anniversaries and events , such_as wars and statehood , can be commemorated only every 50 years . Here ' s a quick look_at recent decisions . Richard Nixon ? In . All Presidents get a stamp the year after their deaths , even the ones who quit . ( Other people have to be dead for at least 10 years. ) Marilyn Monroe ? In . The stamp , due out next year , is expected to be a big seller . John Lennon ? Out . ( He was British. ) Annie Oakley ? In , finally , after 10 years of tireless lobbying by one of her descendants . Hanukkah ? Out -- again -- to the dismay of a Marietta , Ga. , plastics engineer who has been writing to the committee for years championing a stamp for the Jewish Festival of Lights . Free_Enterprise ? Out . A swell idea , but how do you draw it ? No decision is final . The 15 members of the Stamp Advisory Committee -- artists , scholars , business_executives , marketers , all with an interest in philately -- can always decide to approve Lennon , Hanukkah or Free_Enterprise at a later date . The committee , chosen by the postmaster_general , does its national duty for expenses and a small stipend . The current group includes actor Karl Malden , sports figure Richard ( Digger ) Phelps and Los Angeles designer Michael Brock . Among former members are author James Michener and actor Ernest Borgnine . Four times a year , the group meets for two days in a conference_room at U.S. Postal Service headquarters . Working several years ahead of when a stamp is actually issued , members pore over an agenda that postal officials cull from thousands of submissions from groups and individuals . As the Postal Service moves toward hip , contemporary and socially inclusive , the chance of an average American ' s hero , passion or ancestor appearing on a U.S. postage_stamp has skyrocketed . &quot; You ' re right up there with George_Washington , &quot; says committee chair Virginia Noelke , a professor of history at Angelo State University in Texas . Some of the new George_Washingtons include Bessie Coleman , the first African American woman aviator and Phoebe Yates Levy Pember , a Confederate nurse who fed soldiers her famous chicken_soup . Panel members say there isn ' t a subject that doesn ' t surface in the requests -- Shaker chairs , fishbowls , the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , somebody ' s grandmother . Can your grandmother make_it ? Possibly . &quot; What did your grandmother do ? &quot; asks 10-year stamp panel member Phelps , the former Notre Dame basketball_coach . &quot; If your grandmother did something great in her own neighborhood , she probably won ' t make_it . But that submission could spark an idea . There might be a groundswell of people whose grandmothers did great things in their neighborhoods , and then we might look_at the idea of grandmothers in_general . We try to reflect what ' s going on. &quot; The committee is not without its critics . &quot; With their need to be politically correct , they ' re ending_up with all these obscure people that John Q . Public has never heard of , &quot; says Michael Laurence , editor of Linn ' s Stamp News , the country ' s largest stamp publication . &quot; George_Washington hasn ' t been_on a stamp in 10 years . Some of the old subjects my constituency longs for have been jettisoned. &quot; Laurence and some_other stamp experts say the committee is really a political buffer between stamp hopefuls and the Postal Service . &quot; You can bet that of those thousands of submissions the committee gets each year , a lot of them are already in the works by the Postal Service marketing department , &quot; Laurence says . The committee says it isn ' t so . &quot; We look_at everything , &quot; says panel member Mary Ann Owens , an international stamp show judge from Brooklyn . While the stamp group sorts through thousands of submissions for about 50 to 100 annual spots , final approval belongs_to the postmaster_general . The President pushes a stamp agenda by pressuring the postmaster_general . &quot; Once , President ( Ronald ) Reagan wanted a Hispanic veterans stamp . He wanted the Hispanic vote , &quot; Phelps says . &quot; Our view was , if you do one group of vets , you have to do every_other group -- Irish , Italian , you name it . &quot; So we said no. &quot; But the decision came_down on the President ' s side . Of the White_House victory on the atomic_bomb stamp , &quot; I ' m not surprised . There certainly are two sides to the issue , &quot; says committee chairwoman Noelke . &quot; Ultimately it ' s the postmaster_general ' s call . He cares what the President thinks as have all postmasters general. &quot; In the end , what is retained in the national memory may have very little to do with what is commemorated by the Postal Service . As with Mozart and Salieri , time -- not a committee -- will tell .</TEXT>
