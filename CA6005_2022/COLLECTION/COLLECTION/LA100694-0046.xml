   <HEADLINE> CHINA AND ARMS : WORRY LINGERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> China has assured the United States -- yet again -- that it ' s ready to commit itself to efforts to control the spread of missile technology . In exchange , the Clinton_Administration will lift the trade sanctions it imposed on China 14 months ago , making_it possible for Beijing to buy from American companies a number of communications and other satellites worth hundreds of millions of dollars . The Administration insists , as a senior official put it , that &quot; this is not an economic decision &quot; but rather a &quot; non-proliferation decision. &quot; Fair enough . The question now is whether China can be counted_on to hold_up its end of the deal . The question has to be asked because of what has gone before . In 1991 China promised Washington that it would abide_by the terms of what ' s called the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) , under which technologically advanced countries have agreed to try to limit the spread of missiles , notably those that could deliver nuclear_weapons . In August , 1993 , however , the Clinton_Administration announced it had &quot; unambiguous evidence &quot; that China had in fact delivered technology for its surface-to-surface M-11 missile to Pakistan , a country that for many years has pursued a nuclear_weapons program . The trade sanctions followed . The MTCR covers missiles with a range of at least 186 miles and able to carry warheads of up_to 1 # 100 pounds . Relatively cheap and easily transportable , these could become poor countries ' strategic delivery systems . The new agreement with China , while a step toward strengthening non-proliferation , falls_short_of completeness . Beijing still hasn ' t committed itself to adhering fully to the MTCR , as Moscow recently said Russia would . It has only agreed to continue talks with the United States to resolve the two countries ' differences over missile exports . That leaves an area of ambiguity that China , as it has in the past , could exploit to its advantage . All this provides a powerful incentive for the United States -- and other concerned countries -- to continue trying to persuade Beijing to keep tight controls over its technology exports , especially to countries that pose a threat to their neighbors . The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is inherently destabilizing . The major_powers , and China is one of them , must be leaders in working to head_off such threats .</TEXT>
