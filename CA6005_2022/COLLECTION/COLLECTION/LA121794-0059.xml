   <HEADLINE> CHECHNYA : YES , IT ' S AN INTERNAL MATTER ; WASHINGTON NEEDS TO HOPE FOR A QUICK AND HUMANE END TO THIS UGLY LITTLE CONFLICT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The wars of 19th-Century imperial Russia go_on . In the northern Caucasus , Russian tanks and troops are besieging tiny , mountainous Chechnya , home to perhaps 1.2 million Sunni Muslims who speak their own language , cherish their own culture , and -- despite frightful oppression in the past -- keep alive a fierce determination to be independent of Moscow . That hope is probably not realizable . It ' s the fate of the Chechens to have settled a_thousand years ago in an area that proved to be rich_in oil . That oil and the pipelines that have been built to carry it to market make Chechnya an economic plum that no Russian government would be prepared willingly to give_up . Further , no Russian government would likely agree to accept Chechenya ' s independence out of a well-justified fear that the precedent could inspire half_a_dozen other non-Russian areas to similarly demand separation from the federation . Despite this , President Boris N . Yeltsin has come under strong domestic criticism for his handling of the crisis . And Friday , after nearly a week of fighting , he was faced with the threat from one of his generals of a mutiny in the field . At this remove it ' s hard to say whether the showdown precipitated by the 1991 declaration_of_independence by the local Chechen leader , Dzokhar Dudayev , could have been handled with greater finesse and effectiveness . Yeltsin has given the Chechen rebels a deadline for surrendering that expires today . But the evident reluctance of at least some of the Russian army to continue fighting raises questions about what Yeltsin could do if his deadline is ignored . Meanwhile , Moscow has turned_up the volume on its propaganda war against Chechenya . Chechens are one among many distinct ethnic_groups visibly identified with the crime_wave that has been running all but out of control across Russia since communism ' s collapse . Now the government has issued a catalogue of felonies attributing to Chechens terrorism , hostage-taking , hijacking , swindling and counterfeiting . At the same time the government has tried to assure concerned Muslim states that there ' s nothing anti-Islamic in its effort to quash the rebellion . Washington ' s line has been to say almost nothing about the Chechnya conflict , referring to it as an internal matter . In this case it won ' t criticize Moscow nor will it -- as it certainly would have in earlier years -- praise the fight for self-determination by a valiant small people . Unhappily , in light of the geopolitical stakes involved and especially the U.S. interest in keeping Russia stable and Yeltsin in office , Washington is probably right . About the best that can be hoped for now is a quick and humane end to this ugly little conflict .</TEXT>
