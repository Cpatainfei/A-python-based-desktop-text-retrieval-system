   <HEADLINE> SCIENTISTS UNLOCK ' FANTASTIC ' GENE TO BOOST PLANT GROWTH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scientists have unlocked a gene that one day could bring bigger ears of corn , more roses on each bush and even faster-growing forests , all by controlling a hormone inside each plant . &quot; When I think_of the uses -- it ' s fantastic , &quot; said Jedrzej Szerszen , a Michigan State University plant pathologist who helped discover how to genetically manipulate plants ' natural growth_hormone . In a study published today in the journal Science , Szerszen and colleagues Robert Bandurski and Krzystof Szczyglowski isolated and cloned a gene that controls the hormone . &quot; It ' s exciting , &quot; said Dr. Jerry Cohen of the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture , who said genetic_engineering might begin replacing growth chemicals in two to five years . &quot; This is the first step. &quot; Plant growth depends_on a hormone called IAA . A gene called iaglu produces an enzyme that controls how much IAA is free within plants to boost growth and how much is inactive , explained Bandurski , who has researched IAA for 30 years . The Michigan State scientists plucked the iaglu gene out of corn , cloned it and manipulated it to produce more of the vital enzyme . They then injected tobacco , which grows quickly and accepts genetic_engineering well , with the gene . Instead of the normally unwieldy plant , they grew bushier tobacco with more branches -- essentially getting the same amount in a smaller space .</TEXT>
