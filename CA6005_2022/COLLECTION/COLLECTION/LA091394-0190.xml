   <HEADLINE> A FALLEN PREMIER REFLECTS UPON JAPAN ' S YEAR OF TUMULT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an interview with The Times , Kiichi Miyazawa , the first of three prime_ministers to be ousted in the past year of political tumult in Japan , gave his views on developments in his country : On a diminishing sense of urgency in Japan about economic frictions with the United States : &quot; We ' ve made all sorts of efforts for countless years , but our surplus with America hasn ' t gone_down at all . We ' ve come_to a kind of resignation , a feeling of giving_up hope . . . . There also has been a reaction in Japan to ( the Clinton_Administration ' s ) harsh approach . And . . . leadership in taking_up this problem directly at the top level has disappeared in Japan . . . . Concern has fallen. &quot; * On Japan ' s trade surplus with the United States : &quot; During the last 20 years , exports from Japan have been ' built into ' American society -- not just consumer goods but capital goods -- even into ( defense ) sectors . A part of the two nations ' economies has been integrated. &quot; * On security policy : &quot; ( Japan ) doesn ' t have any inclination to become a military power or to change the constitution . Therefore , the framework for Japan ' s security into the 21st Century is the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty structure as a stabilizer for all_of Asia . . . . What Asian_countries , including Japan , are most worried about in the 21st Century is the direction China will take . The American presence is very important. &quot; * On sending noncombat troops on U.N. peacekeeping missions : For decades Japan paid no attention to &quot; whatever happened overseas , and we got fat doing that . The Gulf War forced us to go_through great soul-searching . We gave money -- $ 13 billion . But we didn ' t even shed perspiration. &quot; Condemnation of that hurt . Japanese concluded they &quot; probably should have perspired &quot; to give something beyond money but aren ' t prepared &quot; to shed_blood , whatever the cause. &quot; * On why $ 300 billion in government pump-priming has not yet resuscitated the economy : &quot; The economy was swallowed_up . . . in a black_hole ( of deflation ) . . . . Everyone misread the depth of the black_hole . I too misread it. &quot; * On bad_debts that have crippled banks : &quot; The fact that banks couldn ' t fulfill their normal function really hurt the economy . . . . Money , which is the blood of the economy , didn ' t flow smoothly . . . . I offered a government rescue to the banks. &quot; But they rejected it . They feared if they accepted taxpayers ' money , the government inevitably would &quot; start meddling in their business. &quot; * On the future of the economy : &quot; Downsizing has come_to Japan . But while Japan too must do restructuring , its labor customs -- lifetime employment , seniority -- have many merits . Managers won ' t easily mimic the United States . . . . This has been a terrible recession , but Japan ' s potential has not been uprooted. &quot; * On economic reform : &quot; What Japan has learned through this recession is cost-consciousness . . . . Reforms will emerge from what recently has been called the ' destruction of price structures. ' But deregulation can only occur slowly . . . . Japan is a safe society because government protection has been broadly extended . It ' s a regulated society. &quot; * On political and economic turmoil : &quot; It ' s appealing_to try to see change in the economy in_parallel with politics , and then conclude that both are in a terrible mess -- a shambles . . . . ( But ) what has happened ( in the last year ) is proof that changing cabinets ceaselessly is not a change . We must wait until an election is carried_out under the single-seat districts to see what will happen. &quot; * On efforts by the opposition to form a new conservative_party to oppose Miyazawa ' s Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) : &quot; I don ' t think the Renewal Party ( of former Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata ) and that bunch . . . will be able to build a substantial , consistent platform that is different from ours . I am very skeptical that politics will develop_into a confrontation between two big conservative_parties . If it does , it would develop_into a battle over revising the constitution . That would be a misfortune. &quot; * On Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama abandoning 40 years of Socialist ideological policies : &quot; I don ' t think the Socialists have lost their function . We conservatives will support a market_economy , smaller government , deregulation . But a market_economy has its faults . There is a need for a party that speaks out for weaker people who lose out_in competition . . . and other problems , like environmental issues , social welfare. &quot; * On voters ' attitudes : &quot; The LDP was viewed_as tainted , rotten . ( Former Prime_Minister Morihiro ) Hosokawa didn ' t have that image at the beginning , and people saw him as a change after more_than 30 years of LDP rule . . . . ( Now ) most voters are apathetic about politics . There ' s no crisis facing Japan from the outside . Despite the recession , no layoffs have occurred . People don ' t face a bad situation in their daily lives . So they have little interest in politics. &quot;</TEXT>
