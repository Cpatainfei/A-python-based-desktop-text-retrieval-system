   <HEADLINE> WARTIME INTERNMENT_CAMP BINDS GERMAN POWS , AMERICAN GUARDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fifty years ago in the northern White Mountains , the village of Stark became the unlikely site for a remarkable community : a World_War_II prisoner-of-war camp . Camp Stark existed between April , 1944 , and July , 1946 , nearly doubling the community ' s population of about 400 . But despite wartime animosities and suspicions , it left a positive mark on residents of two continents . In 1986 , five former POWs and about 30 of the Americans who guarded them met for a German-American Friendship Day , a reunion 40 years after the lives of captive and captor , native and foreigner had touched . About 1 # 000 people turned_out for the reunion at Stark ' s covered bridge and the festivities that followed , one of the most important days in Stark ' s 220-year history . Dartmouth College history professor Allan Koop , who chronicled Camp Stark in his book , &quot; Stark Decency , German Prisoners_of_War in a New England Village , &quot; describes the POW_camp as &quot; an island of decency in a world at war. &quot; Koop , the son of former Surgeon_General C . Everett Koop , and Madeleine Croteau of the Stark Improvement Society organized the reunion . Now they ' re looking_to a 1996 observance , the 50th anniversary of the closing of Camp Stark and the 10th anniversary of the first reunion . Camp Stark was home to about 300 of the nearly 400 # 000 Germans held prisoner in camps across the country . According to Koop , the camp came_into existence because of New Hampshire ' s powerful politicians . Brown Paper Co. , the North Country ' s largest employer in nearby Berlin , desperately needed woodcutters for its pulp and paper_mills because the war had depleted its work_force . Sherman Adams , a timberland manager in the North Country who was about to become a member of Congress and , later , governor and then aide to President Dwight D . Eisenhower , and U.S. Sen . Styles Bridges used their influence to get a POW_camp to provide labor for Brown . An abandoned Civilian Conservation Corps camp on the south_side of Route 110 about 30 miles from the Canadian border became the camp . The 50 American guards lived_in similar quarters on the north_side of the road . Five of the POWs later became American or Canadian citizens . Except for a_couple_of chimney bases and guard-tower foundations , the camp now is but a clearing in the woods , only a roadside sign marking the site . What made the camp unusual was that its inmates were mostly members of the 999th Division , an assembly of dissidents , communists , socialists and perceived misfits who had once been imprisoned by the Nazis . The 999th was created by Adolf Hitler to give members a chance to redeem themselves for Germany . Generally , they were older and better educated than regular German troops , wiser_to the ways of the world and more cosmopolitan . Some spoke not only German but also French , English , Dutch , Italian and Norwegian . The camp population included an editor of a socialist newspaper and a former socialist politician . Some of the inmates had fought against the fascists in the Spanish Civil War . When the 999th , part of the Afrika Korps , was defeated by the Allies in Tunisia , its members felt no compunction in surrendering to democratic forces . &quot; Many shared the political ideology of their enemies rather than the beliefs of their compatriots , &quot; Koop wrote . Although Camp Stark had its share of Nazis and political strife among the POWs was common , most of its inmates were anti-Nazis , Koop wrote . Indeed , they elected their leader rather than let the ranking officer , a Nazi , be their spokesman . When in 1945 the inmates were shown films of the Holocaust , the reaction was not one of denial , but shame and , &quot; I told you so , &quot; Koop wrote . Stark ' s German cook prepared special food for the camp ' s American interpreter , a Jew . The camp during those two years also enjoyed the reputation of having_the_best food in the North Country . When President Franklin D . Roosevelt died in 1945 , the POWs expressed their condolences to the camp commander and could barely hold_back tears . But when Hitler died two weeks later in his Berlin bunker , there was no emotion , Koop wrote . Although it was allowed by the Geneva_Convention , few inmates wore their German uniforms , preferring their work clothes marked with &quot; PW. &quot; There were escapes , though all POWs eventually were caught . At one time , 10 % of the inmates were_on the loose . The runaways often claimed to be Dutch sailors , and usually were picked_up by the local constabulary in a day or so . One fugitive was picked_up hitchhiking by the Lisbon police_chief . Koop recounts tales of one fast-talking inmate who conned a guard into letting him outside the gate . Another who fled to the_hills made himself a home_in a cave where he was determined to spend the winter , until a_couple_of local hunters persuaded him to return to the warmth of the camp . Two fugitives returned on_their_own with stomachaches caused by eating berries . Koop wrote that the escapes created excitement among local residents eager to collect the $ 15 bounty , which often led police to &quot; capture &quot; surprised local fishermen . The most successful escape was made by an artist fluent in several languages who made his way to New York City and was getting_by drawing portraits of visitors to Central_Park . But three months after he fled Stark , he ran_into the camp ' s interpreter at Penn Station . The irony was multiplied when both men turned_out to be from Vienna and had lived a_few blocks apart . Like most POW_camps , Stark had an escape tunnel , but it was discovered before it was used . Although most of the interaction of the POWs was with their guards , there also was contact with Brown Co . employees and their families and the occasional contacts in Berlin where inmates requiring hospital or dental_care were taken . Koop noted that guards sometimes would help tired prisoners saw wood so they could meet their daily quotas . German mechanics repaired Brown Co . trucks , inmate artists made gifts of drawings and paintings now cherished as treasures and mementos in many North Country homes . In an odd turnaround , inmates , who earned up_to $ 1.50 a day , could buy cigarettes at the camp store while tobacco was rationed to civilians . Koop wrote that cartons of cigarettes would end_up as gifts for Brown Co . employees , as would inmate-made toys for their children . The camp ' s German doctor was preferred by some American guards over their own physician and the German often made rounds of Stark to treat villagers . One day some guards were humming &quot; Don ' t Fence Me In &quot; and , when a German POW asked what the tune was , the guards taught him the words . &quot; The next morning all_the Germans were singing it , in German and English , &quot; Koop wrote . Forty years later , in Stark Town_Hall , former prisoners_of_war and their families , former guards and their families , former civilian foremen and their families , and the people of Stark all linked arms and sang , ' Don ' t Fence Me In. ' &quot; There was not a dry eye in the hall , &quot; Koop said .</TEXT>
