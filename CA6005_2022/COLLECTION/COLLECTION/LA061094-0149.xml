   <HEADLINE> CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE : LITTLE BENEFIT IN KIDS ' LIFE_INSURANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you have small children , chances are you ' ve received a pitch from Globe Life &amp; Accident Co . of Oklahoma_City . The 43-year-old insurer sells what it calls the &quot; Young American_Plan , &quot; life_insurance for healthy people up_to age 25 . The pitch hits all_the right buttons . A few choice phrases : &quot; Make their future secure &quot; and &quot; Start an estate for them. &quot; It ' s easy to forget that the chief purpose of life_insurance is to provide_for dependents . Children don ' t need life_insurance . Globe isn ' t the only insurance_company selling policies for kids . Nonetheless , its offer illustrates how consumers are often at a disadvantage when trying to assess the worth of insurance_policies sold through the mail . The offer is hard to evaluate . The six-page letter provides few details . We ' re told the annual premium for a $ 5 # 000 policy is $ 20 . At age 26 , the premium leaps to $ 75 a year because the policy builds &quot; cash values. &quot; We called a toll-free number provided in the solicitation for more details . A Globe representative told us that we could obtain a copy of the policy only if we applied for insurance and paid_for it . If we didn ' t like the policy , we could cancel it and get a refund . State regulations taking_effect in November will require insurers to disclose important details in mail solicitations to Californians . Insurers won ' t have to provide a policy , though . The Globe representative did offer to answer our questions . Here ' s what we learned . The policy up_to age 25 is a term life policy . This means that if you let the policy lapse , it is canceled and you receive nothing . Those who cancel their policies after age 27 will receive a portion of the premium paid after age 26 . But don ' t get excited . The amount is small . The cash value at age 27 is $ 10 , though $ 150 in premiums has been paid . The cash value rises to $ 724 at age 46 after $ 1 # 500 in premiums has been paid . The Globe representative told us that cash value will never equal or exceed total premiums paid . that ' s stingier than the typical whole life policy . A representative from the National_Insurance Consumer Organization told us that people who hang_on to whole life policies usually get_back at least what they have paid in . The Globe representative couldn ' t tell us how many people collect on the policy . Chances are few people do . On average , half of all term life_insurance policies lapse after 10 years , NICO said . Globe says it has sold millions of these policies , probably because parents figured that at $ 20 a year , they had little to lose . There is also very little to gain . * Check is in the mail : People from as far away as South Carolina are receiving overnight letters from the California Marketing Assn . of Riverside , saying a cash bonus of $ 2 # 500 awaits them . The letters say people have been selected to receive a cash award based on &quot; an entry form sent_in last September. &quot; To get the cash award , people are told to send California Marketing $ 78.50 to cover &quot; overnight express , insurance and handling fees. &quot; We called California Marketing to find_out more about the offer , but our call wasn ' t returned . The Better Business Bureau in Cypress reports that it has received nearly 70 inquiries about the offer from people all_over the country , indicating dozens of letters have been sent_out . According to the Better Business Bureau , some people who accepted the offer are sorry they did . One person told the bureau that California Marketing did not send the bonus check and has not responded to letters and telephone_calls . Postal authorities we contacted were unaware of California Marketing Assn . A spokeswoman for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service said that in most cases , it is illegal to conduct lotteries through the mail . The spokeswoman said consumers should be cautious when asked to pay a fee in_order to receive cash awards or prizes .</TEXT>
