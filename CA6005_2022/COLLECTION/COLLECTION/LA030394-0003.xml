   <HEADLINE> 47 SENATORS OPPOSE EPA ' S PLAN TO BOOST ETHANOL USE ; GASOLINE : AGENCY ' S PROPOSAL SEEN INCREASING COST TO CONSUMERS AND CAUSING MARKETPLACE CHAOS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Almost half the U.S. Senate sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency chief Carol Browner Wednesday urging her to drop a proposal to guarantee the use of ethanol in a big chunk of the market for anti-smog gasoline . The EPA made the proposal in December , even though its own scientists found that corn-based ethanol could actually bring more smog when it ' s added_to gasoline in warm weather . Oxygenates such_as ethanol and methyl tertiary butyl ether , better known as MTBE , add oxygen to gasoline . This improves combustion and cuts emissions of carbon_monoxide , a poisonous gas . Although both additives are already added_to the gasoline sold in many cities in the winter , when carbon_monoxide is a big problem , EPA scientists wanted to ban ethanol use in the summer because of its smog-forming tendencies . Corn farmers cried foul . Banning ethanol in the summer would severely hamper its use in the year-round market for anti-smog gasoline , which starts in some areas in 1995 . Reacting to these complaints , White_House and EPA officials came_up with a plan that would force refiners making anti-smog gasoline to use ethanol or one of its derivatives -- ethyl tertiary butyl ether or ETBE -- for 30 % of their oxygenate needs . Under this plan , refiners could use ethanol or ETBE to fulfill the 30 % requirement in the winter . In the summer , when smog is a significant worry , ETBE would be the only option for fulfilling the 30 % mandate . Now 47 Senators are saying this is a bad idea . &quot; We urge you to reject this market mandate and withdraw this proposal , &quot; they said in their letter to Browner . Sen . Bill Bradley ( D-N.J. ) , a longtime opponent of subsidies to ethanol makers , rounded_up the signatures and signed the letter himself . Others who signed include J . Bennett Johnston ( D-La. ) , the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee , and the ranking Republican on that panel , Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming . The senators say the ethanol plan will increase costs to consumers and cause chaos in the marketplace as refiners struggle to prove compliance with the 30 % mandate . The proposal could also make air_pollution worse , they say , and it will certainly cut the revenue flowing into a federal trust_fund for highway improvement .</TEXT>
