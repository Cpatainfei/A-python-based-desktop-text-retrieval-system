   <HEADLINE> GAYS BECOME NO . 1 TARGET OF HATE CRIMES ; HUMAN RELATIONS : THEY HAVE REPLACED AFRICAN AMERICANS AS THE MOST FREQUENT VICTIMS OF SUCH INCIDENTS , COUNTY REPORT FINDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time since officials began keeping records three years ago , gays and lesbians have replaced African Americans as the most-targeted victims of hate crimes and hate-related incidents , according to a study released Monday . The report , issued by the Orange County Human Relations Commission , showed that the overall number of reported hate crimes and incidents declined slightly from 1992 to 1993 . But reported incidents in which gays and lesbians were targeted rose 40 % , making them the group most victimized . &quot; It certainly doesn ' t surprise us , &quot; said Craig B . Coogan , executive_director of the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center of Orange County . &quot; I think we ' re in a political climate here where politicians and so-called religious_leaders have made gay-bashing an acceptable form of freedom of expression. &quot; Because so many high-profile issues involving gays and lesbians have come_to_the_fore in recent years , such_as whether homosexuals can serve in the military , Coogan said it is understandable that more gays and lesbians would end_up the victims of hate crimes and incidents . &quot; As our struggles are set_forth in the media , people who disagree_with us are expressing that and the result is more hate crimes , &quot; he said . &quot; I hope we don ' t see more violence , and I hope we can educate people who don ' t understand us. &quot; In one of the most widely publicized incidents , two men , aged 18 and 20 , went looking_for gays to fight in Laguna Beach last January , and beat a Vietnamese man so badly that his face was virtually unrecognizable . Both men pleaded guilty to charges arising from the attack . One received a 10-year prison sentence and the other received one year in jail and five years ' probation . In another incident two months later , a man shouted anti-gay remarks and hurled a Molotov_cocktail against the outer wall of a Newport Beach bar as he drove by , causing minor damage . The man , who police say had a lengthy psychiatric history , was committed to an institution . The statistics released Monday also show that reported incidents involving Jewish victims increased 63 % , and incidents with Asian American victims fell by the same percentage . More_than one-third of all cases involved the distribution of racist flyers , the scrawling of swastikas or use of other symbols of skinhead or neo-Nazi groups , the report shows . The Human Relations Commission attributed 45 cases , or one-quarter of the total , to actions related to white_supremacist groups . &quot; We are finding that more and more young people are attaching themselves to hate literature , &quot; said Rabbi Abraham Cooper , associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles . &quot; But it ' s not just one school_system or one area . It ' s a national problem . A hate crime may_not leave a physical scar , but it leaves an emotional scar. &quot; Last year , Southern California was shaken by the arrests of members of the Fourth Reich Skinheads , a group of youths from Orange and Los Angeles counties . Several members were said to be plotting an attack on the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in South-Central Los Angeles , and had thrown pipe_bombs or Molotov_cocktails at a number of residences and synagogues , including Temple Beth David synagogue in Westminster . Two were sentenced to lengthy jail terms . Of the 180 hate crimes and incidents , eight were prosecuted last year using special allegations that a hate crime had been committed , officials say . The cases had mixed success . In one instance , an African American suspect shot and robbed a white victim in Orange after telling a friend he was going_to get &quot; whitey. &quot; The suspect was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 17 years in state_prison . In another case , a 26-year-old African American woman and mother of four was beaten to death after an altercation in a La Habra parking_lot . Although some witnesses said the suspects used racial slurs during the beating , prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to include hate crime allegations , because other witnesses said no racial slurs were used . The three suspects pleaded guilty . Statistics gathered by the Orange County Human Relations Commission may be low , officials say , because some law_enforcement agencies are more diligent than others in reporting hate crimes or hate incidents . Many victims never report incidents of hate crimes . But the news that the overall number has declined pleased members of the Human Relations Commission , says Rusty Kennedy , its executive_director . &quot; Obviously , it ' s better that the number is going_down than going_up , &quot; said Kennedy , who added that &quot; it ' s important to remember that this is not a comprehensive report . It ' s just what we ' ve become aware of . It ' s entirely too many ( incidents ) and we should be concerned about that. &quot; Hate Crimes Decline Reported hate crimes and hate-related incidents in Orange County dipped slightly in 1993 from the previous year . While African Americans and Asians were less frequent targets of attacks , the number of incidents involving Jews and gays and lesbians increased . 1993 02 # 19 , 11 Group Incidents Gays / lesbians 35 Jews 31 African Americans 29 Asians 15 Latinos 12 Arabs 5 Iranians 4 Whites 4 Multiple victims 45 Total 180 1992 02 # 19 , 11 Group Incidents African Americans 61 Asians 41 Gays / lesbians 25 Jews 19 Latinos 12 Whites 7 Arabs 3 Iranian 1 Muslim 1 Jehovah ' s Witness 1 Croat 1 American_Indian 1 Multiple victims 15 Total 188 Source : Orange County Human Relations Commission</TEXT>
