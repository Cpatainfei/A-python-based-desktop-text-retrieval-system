   <HEADLINE> CALENDAR ' S BIG OSCARS ISSUE ; THE MOVIES COME TO HIM ; THE WHITE_HOUSE THEATER IS STILL THE HOTTEST TICKET IN TOWN , AND PRESIDENT CLINTON IS ONE FAN WHO DOESN ' T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE VIDEO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He watches movies , he publicly critiques them , and he even advertises them by wearing goofy hats and T-shirts . This year , he ' s got a role in one , the documentary &quot; The War Room , &quot; which is nominated for an Oscar . Bill_Clinton may never edge out that old actor Ronald Reagan as the Movie President . But it won ' t be for lack of trying . &quot; I ' m a moviegoer almost to_the_point of compulsion -- have been since I was a boy , &quot; Clinton told a Hollywood audience at a fund-raiser in December . Clinton ' s passion for the craft is reflected in the way he has made an invitation to the White_House movie_theater about the most sought-after ticket in this Administration ' s Washington . An invitation to jog with the President is , of course , much desired by power-seekers who want to linger with No . 1 in the camera ' s eye . But 90 minutes of shared goose bumps in the padded comfort of the 51-seat movie_theater -- well , that ' s intimacy . The theater has become a sort of presidential treehouse , a sanctuary from the outside world that he repairs_to with the people he finds most relaxing . Many nights he drifts in with daughter Chelsea , sometimes with one of her friends in tow . On weekends , the core movie-hour guest list is most often the inner_circle of Arkansas pals , beginning with former Associate Atty . Gen . Webster L . Hubbell ( before Hubbell ' s resignation last week ) , top adviser Bruce Lindsey and their families . ( The Clintons took a break from their Whitewater concerns this week to watch &quot; Naked Gun 33 1 / 3 : The Final Insult. &quot; ) The movie-night scene fits_in with the generally pared-down scale of social_affairs favored by the Clintons , who after 14 months have yet to throw a full-dress state dinner at the White_House . On many occasions larger groups have been invited . Then , the staff sets_up tables outside the room with soft_drinks and kitchen-popped popcorn -- unbuttered , it is claimed . The theater , 20 feet by 50 feet and located off the East Wing portico , is designed to accommodate a small audience comfortably . The oversized armchairs could fit a President with the ample proportions of a William Howard Taft or an important visitor the size of , say , the 6-foot-4 German Chancellor Helmut Kohl ( a Clinton pal who has not yet shared the experience ) . The chairs are arranged in rows of four to six seats , on tiers that rise toward the rear of the theater . The chairs are upholstered in a heavy beige fabric , setting_off deep_red carpeting . Red curtains drape the walls for optimal soundproofing . The decor is appropriately dignified but subdued , so as not to compete with the movie-watching experience . At a time of new scrutiny of presidential perks , the White_House hasn ' t offered to give_up the supply of first-run movies it receives from film distributors -- arranged , naturally , by the Motion_Picture Assn . of America . Past presidential staffs have offered the rationale that it would be a security risk -- as well as a traffic obstacle -- for the chief_executive to roam Washington ' s boulevards on weekend nights in search of a multiplex . Clinton has yet to invite any heads_of_state . But he has apparently overcome his anxieties about the perception that he is star-struck and invited a_few film_industry people . Tom Hanks sat in recently , as did Alan J . Pakula , director of last year ' s &quot; The Pelican Brief. &quot; Also there was John Grisham , the Arkansas-born thriller writer , who , it turns_out , is another unexpected member of the Clinton family_tree -- a distant cousin . While he is watching films in the theater , Clinton can contemplate other events of personal significance that occurred there . In the very same room in fall , 1992 , George_Bush prepped to debate Clinton and Ross Perot in practice_sessions with Chief_of_Staff John H . Sununu . Since then , the Clinton team has used it to practice for speeches and debates . Clinton ' s tastes in films are catholic . Just as he is reluctant to give_up on any group of voters , he seems able to find something nice to say about every movie . &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; was not only his favorite movie of 1993 , he declared it the best in 10 years . Second place went_to &quot; Shadowlands , &quot; the tear-tugger starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger . Clinton thought &quot; The Piano &quot; was &quot; interesting &quot; and liked &quot; The Fugitive &quot; and &quot; The Remains of the Day. &quot; He called the AIDS epic &quot; Philadelphia &quot; &quot; good &quot; but found star Hanks &quot; brilliant. &quot; Likewise , he enjoyed &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; but most of all got a kick_out of Robin Williams , whom the President considers &quot; a comic genius. &quot; And he thought Clint Eastwood was &quot; terrific &quot; in &quot; In the Line_of_Fire , &quot; the story of a Secret_Service agent risking his life on the presidential detail . Clinton went_with Chelsea and a friend to see &quot; My Father , the Hero , &quot; a movie about a teen-age girl and her father . Partway through , he decided that this was a movie a girl would want to enjoy without parents around , and slipped out . Apparently he has not seen &quot; In the Name of the Father. &quot; That may be just as well , since praise or a pan for that one could be awkward , considering how difficult Irish-English relations have been for Clinton this year . Clinton told a group of children in Houston last month that his all-time favorite is &quot; High_Noon , &quot; followed by &quot; Casablanca. &quot; And , yes , he ' s seen all_the Elvis movies , though he does not have them in a personal collection , aides say . The White_House movie_theater was built by President Franklin D . Roosevelt in the early 1940s , but every occupant since has made_good use of it , with the possible exception of Harry S . Truman . John F . Kennedy liked adventure movies , especially about the Navy ; Richard Nixon ' s love of &quot; Patton &quot; is_well known . Lyndon B . Johnson also liked Westerns , although it was his habit to fall_asleep amid a crowd of aides in the theater . Reagan , of course , liked Westerns and science-fiction movies . The Reagans used the theater but spent even more time watching films at Camp David on weekends . And George and Barbara Bush also spent many_an evening in its comfort . The signs of Clinton ' s enthusiasm for the movies were there from the start . On Election_Day , 1992 , Clinton , bone-weary from nonstop travel and partisan pummeling , took a mental vacation with a John Wayne Western whose title is lost to history . Even as a kid in Hot Springs , Ark. , friends remember , Clinton would collect the 10 bottle caps needed to get him into the free Saturday matinees sponsored by a soft-drink company . Last fall , when the New York City mayoral campaign was under way , Clinton was filmed jogging while wearing a cap promoting the film &quot; Rudy. &quot; Someone may have pointed_out the political ramifications of this , at a time when he was supporting incumbent Democrat David N . Dinkins over Republican challenger ( and eventual winner ) Rudolph W . Giuliani . The next day , anyway , on a trip to New York , Clinton had the sense to wear a &quot; Dave &quot; cap . Clinton has used movie promotional items to show_off the odder side of his sense_of_humor . In February , the Secret_Service arrested a Florida man and accused him of stalking Clinton on his mornings jogs and making threats to kill him . The next day , Clinton appeared for his run in a black T-shirt from Eastwood ' s movie -- with the words &quot; In the Line_of_Fire &quot; above gray cross_hairs on the back . President Clinton , Hillary and Chelsea -- all decked_out in Oscar garb . ( But no , they won ' t be there. ) Reuters</TEXT>
