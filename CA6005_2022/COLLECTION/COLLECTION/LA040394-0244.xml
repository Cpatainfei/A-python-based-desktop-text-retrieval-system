   <HEADLINE> HUNT FOR SOLUTION IS_ON IN COYOTE CONTROVERSY ; TRAPPING : L.A. OFFICIALS WILL REVIEW BAN IN FACE OF COMPLAINTS , BUT A LOOK_AT 27 OTHER CITIES SHOWS THE METHOD TO BE INEFFECTIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nocturnal howls that awoke Lana Kuhlen from a dead sleep five months ago signaled a change in her Woodland Hills neighborhood and launched her into the midst of a contentious citywide debate over the merits of wild animal trapping . Coyotes soon began to feast on her neighbor ' s ducks , chickens and cats , leaving the carcasses on neighborhood lawns . Finally , a determined coyote scaled a six-foot fence to eat Kuhlen ' s own chicken . &quot; It ' s a huge problem , it really is , &quot; said Kuhlen , who lives_in the flatlands of Woodland Hills , far from the traditional rural habitat of the coyote . &quot; I kinda feel_like we have become the fast food capital for coyotes out here. &quot; In the past year , Kuhlen ' s complaints have been echoed many times over by distressed west San Fernando Valley residents , prompting the Los Angeles Board of Animal Regulation Commissioners to review its 10-month-old ban on coyote trapping . At the heart of that review will be a dilemma with which cities throughout Southern California have struggled for years : Can trapping and killing coyotes put an end to coyote problems , or is a public education program more effective ? If Los Angeles officials look_to other Southern California cities for guidance , they will find that most municipalities faced with coyote problems use traps on a limited basis , relying primarily on educating the public about how to coexist with Canis_latrans . Of 27 Southern California cities with large wildlife populations , none completely ban coyote trapping , according to interviews with officials at the eight animal control agencies that serve those cities . Nonetheless , animal control officials from those agencies stress that trapping is at best an ineffective , short-term solution . By one estimate , trapping is successful only 10 % of the time . Often , the traps snare more pets than coyotes . Moreover , when a coyote is killed , the remaining coyotes in the area tend to fill the void , usually with larger litters . &quot; I don ' t think trapping is effective , &quot; said Marsha Wyatt , a state officer with the Pomona Valley Humane Society , which provides animal control services to 11 cities in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties . &quot; When you move one adult coyote out . . . two juveniles will move in. &quot; In Pasadena , animal control officials tried coyote trapping on a large-scale basis about six years ago but found that only sick or injured coyotes were caught in the traps . The healthy coyotes that preyed on pets escaped . &quot; They are too smart , &quot; said Alicia Goddard , a spokeswoman for the Pasadena Humane Society . &quot; They didn ' t get the name ' wily coyote ' for nothing. &quot; Pasadena still traps and kills coyotes , she said , but only when a coyote is identified as a repeated threat to pets and people . In recent years , however , there have been few such calls -- which Goddard attributes to the agency ' s education efforts . Pasadena and other cities distribute brochures and pamphlets -- sometimes attached_to utility bills -- to provide tips to residents on how to avoid coyote problems . Educational programs warn residents to put pets and pet_food indoors at night , to fence yards and to keep garbage_can lids secure -- thus cutting_off the coyote ' s food supply . Several cities have produced local cable access shows to convey such information . Others mail information directly to new residents of hillside communities . In Laguna Beach , people who live_in areas with coyote problems are not allowed to adopt cats from the city ' s shelters unless they promise that the cat will be kept indoors . Animal control officials say even such aggressive measures work only when entire neighborhoods take the precautions seriously . One household that leaves food out can create problems for everyone , they say . &quot; I think public education is a reasonable approach but ( expecting ) . . . everyone to comply is overly optimistic , &quot; said Richard Wightman , deputy agricultural commissioner for the Los Angeles County Agriculture Commission , which provides animal control services to 12 cities . The controversy over coyote trapping in Los Angeles was sparked in June , 1993 , when the Board of Animal Regulation Commissioners voted , at the urging of animal rights advocates , to ban all trapping of coyotes by city employees . Instead , the panel decided to launch its own educational_program . The city printed about 5 # 000 brochures titled &quot; Co-Existing With the Coyote , &quot; which are available at animal-control and council district offices , and is producing a cable access program on the subject . During a 12-month period before the trapping ban , residents lodged 511 coyote complaints with the city , according to the Animal Regulation Department . During the same period , coyotes were blamed for the deaths of 116 cats , 23 dogs and 50 other pets , mostly in the West Valley and West Los Angeles , the department said . In that same period , the city trapped and killed 34 coyotes citywide . But after trapping was stopped , complaints about coyote sightings and attacks on pets rose . West Valley residents complain that coyotes have become so brazen that they enter back yards to stalk and kill pets in broad daylight . One Woodland Hills man says that in December a coyote came within six feet of his toddler son before the animal was chased away . Animal control officers attribute the increase in coyote attacks and sightings not to the trapping ban , but to recent floods , wildfires , droughts and other forces that have driven the animals out of their hillside habitats and into urban neighborhoods in search of food . In response to the escalating complaints , the Board of Animal Regulation Commissioners instructed its general_manager to re-examine the city ' s policy and draft recommendations to address the new coyote problems . Because they are cowardly by nature , coyotes for the most part are not a threat to humans , wildlife biologists say . In Los Angeles County , animal regulation officials reported 15 # 276 animal bites on humans in 1993 , none of them by coyotes . But coyotes do grow bold when they begin to rely_on neighborhood food sources and , in the process , lose their fear of people -- much the way pigeons and squirrels in city parks become aggressive beggars , wildlife biologists say . Coyotes also are opportunistic , the biologists say . They will not bother to hunt mice , rabbits or other traditional prey when they have easy access to cats , pet_food , or table scraps in open garbage_cans . This was the conclusion of an unusual 1985 study by a Pomona College biologist who compared the habits of coyotes in Claremont , where city-issued garbage_cans have permanently attached lids , and Glendale , where lids were not attached . The biologist ' s analysis of coyote droppings and the stomach contents of dead coyotes showed that coyotes in the Glendale area ate about 15 times as much human-generated garbage as coyotes in Claremont . He concluded that the tightly fitted , hinged lids on trash_cans made the difference . Despite criticism of trapping , some animal control officials say it has been successful to some degree with coyotes that regularly feed_on domestic pets . In San Clemente , for example , padded leg-hold traps were used to catch five coyotes about two years ago , following a reported coyote attack on a small girl and repeated attacks on pets in a particular neighborhood , said San Clemente Fire_Chief Jene Begnell . In San Clemente , the Fire_Department oversees animal control services . Begnell said the trapping did not end all coyote attacks in the city , but it eliminated those coyotes that were believed responsible_for most of the problems . In fact , Begnell added , a wildlife biologist suggested that the coyotes that were causing the problems were probably the second generation of coyotes in that neighborhood to feed primarily on pets . Most of the cities that still rely_on trapping opt_for cage-like box traps that lure animals in with food , considering the steel-jaw traps that clamp onto an animal ' s leg inhumane . By law , the animals caught in the cages must either be released or shot at the site . But box traps have limited success . In Burbank , where trapping is used to target coyotes that attack pets , box traps are steam-cleaned before they are used because coyotes can detect the scent of human_beings on the traps . But even then , Burbank Animal Shelter Supt . Fred DeLange said the traps only catch a coyote about one out of every 10 times they are used . Last year , DeLange said Burbank trapped and killed three coyotes . At the same time , he said , the traps also snared a dog and a cat . Although such mixed results lead DeLange to concede that trapping does not end coyote attacks , he defended the policy as realistic . Education isn ' t a foolproof solution either , he said , except in a perfect world . &quot; It ' s never over , but this is the stand we have taken , &quot; he said . &quot; We would n ' t have to go_out and trap and shoot anything if everybody would do what they are supposed to. &quot;</TEXT>
