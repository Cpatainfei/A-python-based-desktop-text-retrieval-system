   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; FISCAL QUAKE IN O.C. CAUSES TEXAS TREMORS ; PANIC : STATEWIDE FUND HAS LOST 40 % OF ITS DEPOSITS IN A WEEK . COUNTIES AND AGENCIES IN OTHER STATES HAVE ALSO REPORTED LOSSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jitters over Orange County ' s fiscal crisis continued to ripple across the country Tuesday , as nervous officials in Texas resumed their run_on a statewide investment pool that has lost 40 % of its deposits in the past week . TexPool , which manages investments for more_than 1 # 300 school districts and municipalities across the state , has been sapped of $ 1.5 billion since the Orange County debacle began unfolding . Though many local officials believe the fund is sound , they say the stampede of withdrawals has forced them to pull_out their own deposits to avoid getting stuck_with any losses . &quot; There ' s a panic out there , &quot; said Ft . Bend County Treasurer Kathy Hynson , who Monday withdrew $ 4.4 million of her government ' s $ 20.4 million in TexPool deposits . &quot; If everything cools_down , I think we ' ll be fine . But I just wanted to be sure that if the bottom fell_out , I ' d at least have some funds left over. &quot; In an effort to calm anxious officials , Texas Treasurer Martha Whitehead on Tuesday reiterated her pledge to insure the $ 2.2 billion now left in the TexPool account . By using state funds to buy TexPool securities , Whitehead said , she could guarantee that no investor would lose money or be denied access to deposits . &quot; I am confident we will weather this storm , &quot; she said . &quot; My top priority is to reassure participants that they will not lose a dime. &quot; Many analysts agree that TexPool ' s problems have been largely psychological . The fund , founded five years ago to give small municipalities the same investment options as large governments , usually hits a low in November or December anyway , as agencies withdraw revenues traditionally deposited at the beginning of the year . The drop-off , which has tended to run between 30 % and 50 % , was sharper this year because higher interest_rates lured away many investors , experts said . Even before Orange County declared bankruptcy , TexPool ' s assets had dropped from a high of $ 10.8 billion in February to $ 3.7 billion last week . But then came Orange County ' s woes and a critical article in last Friday ' s Wall_Street Journal , which suggested that TexPool ' s investment strategies were similarly suspect . State officials decried the story as &quot; unfair and irresponsible , &quot; saying 90 % of their investments are in the low-risk U.S. Treasury market . By then , however , the rush was_on . Investors yanked $ 369 million on Friday , $ 662 million on Monday and $ 463 million on Tuesday . &quot; It ' s a herd mentality , &quot; said Richard Scott , a former Texas treasury official who now runs his own investment group in Dallas . &quot; People are withdrawing funds without the economic rationale to do so. &quot; Counties and other public agencies in Ohio , Wisconsin , Maine , Alaska , Georgia and West_Virginia have also reported significant losses in investment portfolios in recent weeks . Glenn S . Goldberg , a managing director of Standard &amp; Poor ' s , the bond-rating agency , said that despite these woes , Orange County is an extreme case . Nonetheless , S &amp; P has expedited a review of the riskiness of other local_government investment pools . &quot; The vast majority invest in very to relatively safe securities , many of which have no leverage and no derivative securities , &quot; Goldberg said . &quot; But you ' re always looking_for the exception. &quot; ( In leveraging , a fund borrows money in the hope of investing it at a higher rate of return . Derivatives are complex securities whose value is based on the movement of other financial indicators , from interest_rates to oil prices . Both figured in the Orange County debacle. ) One exception was Auburn , Me. , a city of 24 # 000 north of Portland . It has lost $ 6.5 million out of $ 15.5 million in derivative investments , due_to rising interest_rates . Auburn ' s investments totaled $ 18 million ; its entire budget is $ 44 million . &quot; We didn ' t have an investment policy , &quot; acting City_Manager Patricia A . Finnigan said . &quot; We didn ' t have sufficient internal controls to know what we were investing in. &quot; Auburn had planned to use the investment funds to cushion the city ' s share of the cost of a new regional waste-to-energy incinerator . With the losses , Finnigan said , taxes may be raised as much as 10 % -- a blow to a city unaccustomed to double-digit hikes . Nevertheless , she said Auburn ' s plight is far from being as bad as Orange County ' s . &quot; Orange County was highly leveraged in that they borrowed money to invest , and we weren ' t doing that , &quot; Finnigan said . &quot; We ' re not going_to have to declare bankruptcy . We ' re going to have to watch things a lot more closely . We can live with that. &quot; In Alaska , the state ' s Permanent Fund , set_up in 1976 to preserve Alaska ' s oil wealth from boom times , has incurred paper losses of more_than $ 1 billion since February , a spokesman said Tuesday . The market_value of the fund -- which has paid each Alaska resident a dividend every year since 1982 -- is $ 14.9 billion . In Alaska , as in Orange County , the losses are in the fund ' s bond portfolio . The rise in interest_rates this year , which has sharply diminished the value of bond holdings , &quot; has been eating_up our unrealized gains , but we ' re not too excited about it , &quot; spokesman Jim Kelly said . The fund includes no derivatives , and &quot; we didn ' t do any leveraged buying , &quot; he added . &quot; We ' re meeting our cash needs . Eventually the rates will go_down &quot; and the bond fund will again show strength , Kelly predicted . &quot; We ' ve just got_to ride it out. &quot; Katz reported from Houston and Miller from Washington . Times researchers Doug Conner in Seattle , Edith Stanley in Atlanta and Lianne Hart in Houston also contributed to this report .
