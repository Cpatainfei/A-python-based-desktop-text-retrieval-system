   <HEADLINE> MUSIC REVIEW ; BORISKIN AT BING THEATER IN FIRST OF THREE PIANO RECITALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Michael Boriskin speaks well , plays the piano well and returned to Southern California this week with a fine concept : a three-recital survey of 20th-Century piano music , to be spread_out during the 1994-95 Monday Evening Concerts season . Heard at the first installment , Monday night in Leo S . Bing Theater at the County Museum of Art , Boriskin ' s achievement did not attain the level of his ambition.A program of music by Witold Lutoslawski , Henry Cowell , Lou Harrison , George Perle and Ravel -- half of which the youngish New Yorker had played here previously -- often fell_flat . What was missing was color , variety and panache , not necessarily in that order . Boriskin ' s palette seems monochromatic , his dynamic resources limited , his imagination not fully operative . One could admire all this music for its bright invention , but not the narrow range of its execution . What the pianist played best , Ravel ' s &quot; Tombeau de Couperin , &quot; indicated the parameters of his musical / technical arsenal . Boriskin gets_around the keyboard easily , but fails to produce the sound-differentiations and nuances one expects in this repertoire . His softest playing lacks delicacy , just as his loudest lacks weight . This wondrous suite became neutral ground , mechanically a field of mezzo-forte . Pleasing homages to Chopin and Debussy began each half of this agenda , first in two Etudes Lutoslawski wrote in 1941 ( down_payment on a set the Polish composer never completed , Boriskin told his sparse audience ) , then in Perle ' s characterful &quot; Six New Etudes &quot; of 1984 . Boriskin also exhumed three handsome pieces by Cowell , played efficiently but without passion . At the program ' s center was Harrison ' s cherishable Suite for Piano ( 1943 ) , which had been given its world_premiere at Evenings on the Roof , precursor of Monday Evening Concerts , half a century ago .</TEXT>
