   <HEADLINE> PROBE TIES REAGAN , BUSH TO IRAN-CONTRA COVER-UP ; INQUIRY : REPORT SAYS NEITHER BROKE LAW BUT ALLOWED EFFORT TO DECEIVE . EX-PRESIDENTS CALL CONCLUSIONS UNFAIR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George_Bush engaged in conduct that contributed to &quot; a concerted effort to deceive Congress and the public &quot; about the Iran-Contra scandal , according to the final report issued Tuesday by the independent counsel who investigated the affair . In his findings , Lawrence E . Walsh concluded that neither Reagan nor Bush violated any criminal_laws in connection with the affair -- in which the Reagan_Administration secretly sold weapons to Iran in the mid-1980s in_order to gain the release of American hostages in Lebanon and to generate funds to aid rebel forces in Nicaragua . But Reagan ' s &quot; disregard &quot; for limits imposed by Congress emboldened some of his Administration ' s highest-ranking officials to engage in illegal actions , Walsh said . He charged that Reagan &quot; set the stage for the illegal activities of others by encouraging and , in_general terms , ordering support of the Contras &quot; during a two-year period when Congress had prohibited military aid to the rebels . As for then-Vice President Bush , Walsh said : &quot; Contrary to his public pronouncements , . . . he was fully aware of the Iran arms sales . Bush was regularly briefed , along with the President ( Reagan ) , on the Iran arms sales , and he participated in discussions to obtain third-country support for the Contras. &quot; In separate statements released Tuesday , Reagan , Bush and several other former officials named in the report called Walsh ' s conclusions inaccurate and unfair . Reagan termed the report &quot; an expensive , self-administered pat on the back and a vehicle for baseless accusations that he could never have proven in court. &quot; Bush said no one should try to criminalize what was &quot; a political dispute between the executive and legislative_branches over foreign policy. &quot; Walsh ' s report , released by order of the panel of U.S. appellate judges who appointed him in December , 1986 , marks the official end of a seven-year investigation that cost $ 40 million . All told , 11 people -- including former White_House aides Oliver L . North and John M . Poindexter -- were convicted of charges stemming from the investigation . North ' s and Poindexter ' s convictions were later overturned on appeal . The report forecloses further legal_action against any of the figures named in the probe and ends all scrutiny of them in conjunction with Iran-Contra allegations . The final report , required of all court-appointed independent counsels , was written last August but kept under seal by the federal judges until those mentioned in it could state their objections and offer their views on the findings . Walsh , 80 , a former judge and Wall_Street lawyer with Republican credentials , said in an hourlong news briefing Tuesday that if facts now established had been known in 1987 , Congress should have considered impeaching Reagan and his attorney_general , Edwin Meese III . It was Meese , Walsh said , who concocted a false account of key events in the scandal in_order to protect Reagan . &quot; It certainly should have been considered , &quot; he said of impeachment . &quot; Whether it would ever have reached that point , I think , is doubtful . But the fact is Congress was deprived of that opportunity by the withholding of notes ( by key officials ) . &quot; The report said senior officials and Reagan Cabinet members concealed notes about high-level deliberations and took_part in a strategy to make lower-level staff_members of the National Security_Council , including North , the &quot; scapegoats whose sacrifice would protect the Reagan_Administration in its final two years. &quot; Walsh ' s report , which is more_than 1 # 200 pages long , concluded that &quot; in an important sense , this strategy succeeded. &quot; He said he and his staff attorneys &quot; discovered much of the best evidence of the cover-up in the final year of active investigation , too late for most prosecutions. &quot; The arms sales to Iran during portions of 1985 and 1986 , initially coming from U.S. stocks held by the Israelis , were kept secret from Congress and the public because they violated an arms embargo promoted by the United States on the grounds that Iran engaged in terrorism . Aid to the Contras -- prohibited by Congress -- was also kept secret . The White_House first acknowledged the arms sales and the diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels in a nationally televised news briefing in November , 1986 , at which Meese presented results of an internal inquiry that he said he made at Reagan ' s request . But Walsh ' s report charged that Meese , with help from Poindexter , &quot; attempted to create a false account ( of the arms sales ) in_order to protect the President. &quot; Reagan steadfastly insisted during the last two years of his Administration that there was no connection between the arms sales and the release in 1986 of American hostages held_in Lebanon by forces believed subject_to control by Iran . He also denied knowledge of any diversion of funds to the Contras . &quot; The evidence indicates that Meese ' s November , 1986 , inquiry was more of a damage-control exercise than an effort to find the facts , &quot; the report said . Although Congress held televised hearings into the_matter in 1987 , &quot; congressional oversight alone cannot correct the deficiencies that result when an attorney_general abandons the law_enforcement responsibilities of that office and undertakes instead to protect the President , &quot; Walsh said . At the news briefing , Walsh made clear that he thought the House and Senate investigations missed their mark widely . &quot; Congress didn ' t even call Vice_President Bush or President Reagan , &quot; he said . &quot; It didn ' t even ask_for their depositions . . . . It went_off on the theory of a runaway conspiracy , which proved to be an unsound thesis. &quot; According to the report , former Defense_Secretary Caspar W . Weinberger was among key Cabinet members who were &quot; consistently informed of proposed and actual arms shipments to Iran , &quot; the report said . &quot; The key evidence , &quot; it said , &quot; was handwritten notes of Weinberger which he deliberately withheld from Congress and the OIC ( Walsh ) until they were discovered by the independent counsel in late 1991. &quot; Some of Weinberger ' s notes , as well as those of former White_House Chief_of_Staff Donald T . Regan , disclosed that &quot; Meese appeared to have spearheaded an effort among top officials to falsely deny presidential awareness of the Hawk transaction , &quot; a 1985 shipment of antiaircraft missiles to Iran , Walsh ' s report said . Then-White House Counsel Peter Wallison also &quot; raised concerns about a conflict_of_interest &quot; in allowing Meese , a presidential appointee , to investigate a White_House affair , the report said . Referring again to Weinberger ' s notes , Walsh said they &quot; demonstrated that Weinberger ' s early testimony -- that he had only vague and generalized information about Iran arms sales in 1985 -- was false , and that he in fact had detailed information on the proposed arms sales and the actual deliveries. &quot; Weinberger was among 14 people prosecuted by Walsh on such charges as perjury and conspiracy , but he was pardoned by then-President Bush before his trial , along with five others , on Christmas_Eve , 1992 . Sharply criticizing Bush for the pardon , Walsh said in his report that Weinberger ' s case &quot; marked the first time a President ever pardoned someone in whose trial he might have been called as a witness. &quot; At his news_conference , Walsh singled_out Bush for additional criticism , saying &quot; he will always have to answer_for his pardons -- there was no public purpose served by that. &quot; However , he declined to characterize the Weinberger pardon as part of a cover-up engineered by the Reagan-Bush administrations , saying : &quot; I had no proof that the pardon was conceived for that purpose. &quot; Walsh was kinder in assessing Reagan ' s motives , telling reporters : &quot; He was carrying_out policies that he strongly believed_in . &quot; He may have been willful , but he at least thought he was serving the country in what he did , &quot; Walsh said . &quot; And the fact that he disregarded certain laws and statutes in the course of it was not because of any possible self-centered purpose. &quot; Walsh ' s report noted that Weinberger and former Secretary_of_State George P . Shultz were the only members of Reagan ' s inner_circle who opposed the arms sales . Yet , Walsh said , Shultz joined Weinberger in deceiving Congress about the extent of his knowledge about the arms sales , apparently to shield Reagan . According to notes taken by Charles Hill , Shultz ' s executive assistant , &quot; Shultz knew that the shipments were planned and that they were delivered , &quot; Walsh said . But the report added that Shultz was never prosecuted &quot; because there was a reasonable doubt that Shultz ' s testimony was willfully false at the time it was delivered. &quot; Recounting notes from diaries obtained from Regan , Walsh said Shultz &quot; expressed consternation over the Iran arms sales &quot; shortly before congressional leaders were to be briefed on Nov . 12 , 1986 . Regan ' s notes quoted Shultz as objecting that &quot; this is swapping arms for hostages no matter what we say , and undercuts our efforts with allies , particularly Italians and ( then-Italian Prime_Minister Bettino ) Craxi , who want to sell arms. &quot; Regan ' s notes , according to Walsh , characterized Reagan , Bush and Poindexter as feeling that it was &quot; too risky . . . to go public &quot; at that point . Once the arms sales had been publicly acknowledged , Regan ' s notes show that then-First Lady Nancy Reagan feared &quot; we ' re risking the presidency. &quot; When asked what that meant , Walsh said Regan told investigators : &quot; That similar to Watergate , he ( Reagan ) might be impeached , that we were risking the President ' s tenure in office , his presidency and his reputation. &quot; Times staff writer Doyle McManus contributed to this story . * LOST LESSONS ? Experts fear that scandal ' s lessons have been obscured . A27 Iran-Contra Findings Key findings of the report of independent counsel Lawrence E . Walsh ' s investigation into the Iran-Contra scandal : * There was no evidence that President Ronald Reagan broke laws , but he &quot; set the stage &quot; for illegal activities of his aides . He ordered &quot; in_general terms &quot; the illegal efforts to aid the Contras . Reagan also authorized the illegal sale of arms to Iran in an effort to win release of American hostages in the Middle_East . * White_House Chief_of_Staff Donald T . Regan , Secretary_of_State George P . Shultz and Defense_Secretary Caspar W . Weinberger withheld information that would have given Congress a clearer idea of the scope of the scandal . * Contrary to his public statements , Vice_President George_Bush &quot; was fully aware of the Iran arms sale &quot; and efforts to raise money for the Nicaraguan rebels from third countries . There was no evidence , however , that Bush broke any laws . * Several Reagan_Administration officials systematically withheld a large volume of documents relevant to the investigation . Notes kept by Regan , Shultz and Weinberger during the Iran-Contra scandal were withheld until late in the investigation . * Atty . Gen . Edwin Meese III falsely stated that Reagan did not know about a 1985 Hawk missile shipment to Iran at the time . Walsh considered prosecuting Meese in 1992 for making a false_statement but concluded that the passage of time would make_it difficult to prove the case .
