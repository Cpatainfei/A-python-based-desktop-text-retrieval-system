   <HEADLINE> BRAZIL GIVES COBHAM NEW BEAT AND OUTLOOK ; MUSIC : THE DRUMMER , WHO PLAYS THE COACH_HOUSE ON TUESDAY , FOUND INSPIRATION FOR NEW ALBUM WHILE DOING UNICEF PROJECT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Billy Cobham takes_the_stage at the Coach_House Tuesday with Stanley Clarke , Larry Carlton , Brian Simpson and Najee in the Jazz Explosion Superband , his mind surely will be_on his performance , but his heart well may be in Santos , Brazil , with Ellison , Edison and Washington . One of the more influential musicians of his generation , the 50-year-old drummer spent five months of last year working in the Brazilian town for a UNICEF-sponsored project designed to give homeless children basic care and hope for a future . As if in return , he found the inspiration for his new Evidence-label release &quot; The Traveler , &quot; a Brazilian-flavored outing that reflects his experiences working with the youngsters . &quot; The kids all had single nicknames , strangely enough , in English , &quot; he said last week on the phone from New York between Superband concerts . &quot; Ellison was the biggest , a very cynical 18-year old , though he still wasn ' t a total lost cause . Edison really wanted to go_to school and make something of himself . But it was Washington who really stirred_up the emotion in me . &quot; The first time I met him he was smoking this giant spliff . At 11 , he was already older than most of us in terms of experience . There was talk that he may have committed murder . He ' d really been around . And he loved rap. &quot; Cobham got involved with the fledgling program after , as he puts it , &quot; I opened my big mouth &quot; during a dinner_party in Rome that included some Europeans with ties to UNICEF . &quot; In the course of conversation about helping children , I jumped in and said what you people ought to do is give these kids some direction , put some artist in there with the kids and give them a positive direction to emulate . That was November of ' 92 . Later , they called to see if I wanted to get involved . By January , I was in Brazil. &quot; He had direct contact with about a dozen children ranging_in age from 6 to 18 . Besides providing food and medical_care , the program sought to give them skills to grow on . &quot; Without any knowledge of Portuguese , I found it was uncannily easy to use music as a point of interest in communication , &quot; Cobham said . &quot; We tried to bring_in musicians from the surrounding areas who they knew , to bring an air of respectability to the program . We were actually able to form a concert group , and put_on one concert at the town_hall that was very successful. &quot; In addition to performing , Cobham taught the children a craft that could provide a foundation for their lives : how to repair instruments . &quot; These kids are always concentrating_on how they ' re going to survive the next 30 seconds , &quot; he said . &quot; How would it be if they had some skills , could earn some money ? It would open_up a whole wide world for them. &quot; Still , he thinks the most valuable aspect of the program was the chance it gave the children to express themselves . &quot; Washington took_over the mike ( at the concert ) and just spilled his guts to the kind of rhythm that Arrested Development might play . He rapped just about what had happened to him the night before . But it was poetry and people were blown away. &quot; During those five months , Cobham found himself coming_up with material for &quot; The Traveler. &quot; &quot; I ' d say 90 % of the tunes were written in Brazil . They would come_into my head while I was working and I ' d sing them into a dictation machine . Later , I sat_down at the piano and put it all together . I ' ll always be indebted to the people of Santos for that inspiration. &quot; * The album ' s title is apt for someone born in Panama , raised in New York and living now in Switzerland . Cobham ' s pinpoint , well-muscled sound was at the forefront of a new musical direction that was spawned in the late ' 60s and that resulted in the genre now loosely defined as &quot; fusion. &quot; After a stint with jazz-funk composer-pianist Horace Silver , Cobham joined the ground-breaking though short-lived crossover band Dreams in 1969 . He played_on Miles Davis ' landmark &quot; Bitches Brew &quot; and went_on to record a number of other experimental electric sessions with the revered innovator . But it was his work with John McLaughlin ' s Mahvishnu Orchestra that thrust him into the spotlight . His ambitious , split-hair timekeeping , matched against guitarist McLaughlin ' s machine-gun attack , won_over a generation of listeners looking_for more depth and musical proficiency than was being offered by that day ' s crop of rockers . Cobham went_on to record a number of_his_own albums , beginning with the critically acclaimed &quot; Spectrum &quot; in 1973 ( recently re-released on CD ) . He says he is both flattered and chagrined to hear samples from &quot; Spectrum &quot; being used on other musicians ' recordings , most notably on bassist Bill Laswell ' s latest , on which an entire number is built from a Cobham song called &quot; Red Barron. &quot; &quot; It ' s a wonderful piece , &quot; Cobham said , &quot; but I don ' t like the fact that I wasn ' t given credit or acknowledgment , let alone payment . It ' s not fair . They owe me an explanation. &quot; He finds the current state of the fusion movement to be more focused than the expansive explorations of 20 years ago . &quot; The musical direction has been narrowed ; only small portions ( from the early days ) are being used and amplified . &quot; It ' s because of the way many young musicians view the music and what they ' re putting_together . They don ' t need that complicated Miles alternative or the thing that Mahvishnu had . They need to bring it right into your face , like with the rap thing. &quot; The Jazz Explosion Superband is an ensemble of fellow fusion pioneers who have found common_ground playing each other ' s music . Their tour last year resulted in the Epic release &quot; Live At the Greek &quot; which includes Cobham ' s seriously percussive &quot; Stratus &quot; from &quot; Spectrum. &quot; Cobham said that despite some initial ego problems , the group has come_together very well . He has only polite words for his fellow members : * On Stanley Clarke : &quot; We ' re really getting_to know each other , finally , after thinking we already did . This is a very good experience for us , to perform together over an extended period_of_time ( last year ) , go_away , and then come_back together again . Our relationship started_out a little lumpy and stiff because we played in different environments , but we really understand each other now. &quot; On Larry Carlton : &quot; I ' ve only known Larry since 1992 but I ' ve always admired his work . He ' s very congenial , very easygoing and a wonderful guitarist. &quot; On Najee : &quot; As far as I ' m concerned , he ' s the best-kept secret in woodwinds . He doesn ' t just play tenor and alto but serious soprano and flute too . Every night with him is a joy. &quot; And on Brian Simpson , who has replaced Deron Johnson on keyboards : &quot; He ' s really walked into a difficult situation . He came_in a day and a half before the gig ( to audition ) and just knocked our socks off . He ' s a very supportive keyboard player. &quot; But , Cobham said , the children of Santos are always in the back of his mind . His return to Brazil hinges_on the outcome of this year ' s Brazilian presidential election and approval of UNICEF funding . &quot; I ' m waiting for permission . But the first chance I have , I ' ll be there . I don ' t want to force myself ; I have nothing politically to prove . But I do have a lot to gain. &quot; * The Jazz Explosion Superband with Billy Cobham , Stanley Clarke , Larry Carlton , Brian Simpson and Najee plays Tuesday at 7 and 9:30 p.m. at the Coach_House , 33157 Camino Capistrano , San Juan Capistrano . $ 25 .
