   <HEADLINE> FRAIL PONTIFF URGES CROATS TO FORGE PEACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He came at last to the tortured Balkans as a &quot; defenseless pilgrim , &quot; looking frail and unsteady but sounding resolute . Pope John Paul II on Saturday admonished the welcoming faithful of a Catholic country that it is their &quot; sacred duty &quot; to forge peace in a land riven by ethnic warfare . John Paul ' s first visit to a piece of the former Yugoslav federation was marked by unflagging spirit but physical discomfort : For the first time in 62 foreign trips , the 74-year-old pontiff failed to directly kiss the ground of a new country . The Pope , who broke his hip in April , maneuvered with difficulty and uncertain balance when he arrived in this Croatian capital . With fierce concentration , he descended the 19 red-carpeted steps from his plane slowly , one hand on a thin black cane , the other clutching the gangway banister . Aides sprang to help him with the last two steps . With the Pope clearly unable to kneel , the ground-kissing ceremony was finessed when two welcoming Croats came_forward with a bowl of earth . John Paul bowed and brushed the warm soil softly with his lips . Croatia ' s history is steeped in Catholicism -- 3.7 million of the country ' s 5.5 million people are members of the faith , by Vatican count -- and the Pope received a thunderous welcome . Gigantic crowds lined fields of fresh-harvested corn near the airport and Zagreb ' s pleasant , tree-shaded streets , cheering the Pope as he rode his Popemobile to the cathedral that has been the religious heart of the capital since the 13th Century . After a long , elaborate vespers service , John Paul seemed drained . Vatican aides clustered protectively around him as he shuffled from the church . Peace in the Balkans has become an abiding priority for the Pope . He had envisioned the Croatia visit as one of three to pieces of a Yugoslav federation that was splintered after the fall of communism . But the Serbian government in Belgrade and the Serbian Orthodox Church , which believe that the Vatican sides with Catholic Croatia , said the pontiff would not be welcome there . A papal visit scheduled for last Thursday to the besieged Bosnian capital , Sarajevo , was canceled at the last minute for security reasons . At the airport , John Paul proclaimed himself &quot; a defenseless pilgrim of the Gospel of Jesus , which proclaims love , harmony and peace. &quot; The message has not been embraced in the Balkans . Croatia sent two warplanes to escort the pontiff ' s jet , and reporters making the trip were immediately given a 121-page book chronicling the Serbian destruction of churches in Croatia and neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina . In a strongly nationalist welcoming address , Croatian President Franjo Tudjman applauded the Pope as a friend -- and ally -- of an independent , Catholic Croatia in the face of Serbian aggression . John Paul , though , tried to remain nonpartisan , railing against &quot; bloody fratricidal war &quot; that has too long savaged a land &quot; whose people for centuries were used to reciprocal tolerance and exemplary collaboration. &quot; With scant prospects for peace , war has shifted from Serb-Croat struggles in Croatia to three-sided slaughter in Bosnia-Herzegovina , the Pope said . &quot; How much innocent blood has flowed , how many tears have streaked the faces of mothers , children , young_men and elderly people ? &quot; he lamented in a Croatian-language address broadcast live from the airport . &quot; The Holy_See is continuing to adopt every means available to overcome the existing tensions and toward the re-establishment of justice and peace in the Balkans . However difficult , the peace effort is a sacred duty for every believer . &quot; Peace , if it is really desired , is always possible ! To construct peace on the basis of justice and truth , we must first pray to God , &quot; John Paul said . In a region where peacemakers have been more frustrated than blessed , John Paul begged Croats to promote a tolerant &quot; culture of peace. &quot; &quot; Such a culture does not reject a healthy patriotism , but this is far from the exasperations of exclusive nationalism . . . . Wounds produced by hatred will not be healed by rancor , but rather by the therapy of patience and the balm of forgiveness , &quot; the Pope said . At the cathedral , John Paul told Croatian priests and nuns that it is their &quot; great and serious task . . . to reconcile men with God and among themselves. &quot; The Pope lavished praise on the late Cardinal Aloysius Stepinac , leader of Croatian Catholics during World_War_II and a symbol of unslaked hostility between Croats and Serbs . Croats cherish Stepinac as a patriot , and , to repeated applause from the congregation , the Pope lauded him in the cathedral where he is buried as &quot; a true man of the church , ready for extreme sacrifice not to deny the faith. &quot; Serbs revile Stepinac , saying he and his priests condoned the massacre of tens of thousands of Serbs by Croatian Fascists allied_with Nazi occupiers during the war . Organizers of the papal visit say they expect as_many as half a_million Catholics at a Mass this morning at Zagreb ' s racetrack after John Paul pays a courtesy call_on Tudjman . The Pope returns to Rome tonight , concluding his first foreign trip since a visit to the three Baltic_republics a year ago . A spring visit to Lebanon was canceled because of possible violence , and a trip to Belgium was canceled because of the broken hip . As he completes the 16th year of his reign , the world ' s most traveled Pope has one more 1994 trip scheduled : to the United Nations in New York next month , with brief side visits to Newark , N.J. , and Baltimore .</TEXT>
