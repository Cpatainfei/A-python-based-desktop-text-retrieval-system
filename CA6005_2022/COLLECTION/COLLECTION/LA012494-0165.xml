   <HEADLINE> ' SCHINDLER ' S LIST ' BREAKS THE JINX FOR SPIELBERG ; GOLDEN GLOBES : AWARDS END SPECULATION THAT DIRECTOR WOULD GET COLD_SHOULDER AGAIN ; HANKS , HUNTER , WILLIAMS ALSO HONORED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Now , I can breathe again , &quot; said Steven Spielberg , as he stepped off a backstage podium with his two Golden Globe Awards for &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; -- the first time he has actually won one of Hollywood ' s major film prizes . In the past , he had been nominated for Globes and Oscars but never took one home . Only minutes earlier , Spielberg was sitting among the hundreds of celebrities and entertainment_industry power_brokers who had gathered for Saturday night ' s 51st annual presentation of the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. ' s annual prizes . Hollywood ' s &quot; Moses &quot; himself ( a.k.a. Charlton Heston ) delivered the announcement : &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; a black-and-white film depicting the Holocaust and a German industrialist who saved more_than 1 # 300 Jews from Nazi death camps , had won the best dramatic picture prize for 1993 . Earlier in the evening , actor Gregory Peck had opened the envelope and read Spielberg ' s name as best director . The two wins ended film community speculation about whether the director of the two box-office giants &quot; E.T. &quot; and &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; would again get a cold_shoulder when it came_to prizes . His previous nominated directing efforts for &quot; Jaws , &quot; &quot; The Color Purple &quot; and &quot; Raiders of the Lost Ark &quot; had been overlooked by the Golden Globe voters -- and the members of the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences who vote for the Oscars . To many , it appeared as though the Golden Globes , held at the Beverly Hilton , may have been -- once again -- the dress_rehearsal for the Academy Awards to be presented on March 21 . But what a dress_rehearsal . Nerves were jittery from the Los Angeles area earthquake and the aftershocks as the show began . Hostess Faye Dunaway expressed thanks for the safety and survival of the guests in the ballroom . At the earlier cocktail_party , the earthquake even beat_out Oscar speculation as Topic No . 1 . An unnerved Bette Midler , nominated for best actress in a television film for her role in the musical &quot; Gypsy , &quot; left town with her family and did not attend . She won the Globe , however . It was an evening that drew a variety of celebrities -- the music world ' s Janet Jackson , Huey Lewis , Clint Black and Bruce Springsteen ( who won a Globe for best song for a motion_picture , &quot; Philadelphia &quot; ) , TV ' s Jerry Seinfeld , Steven Bochco and Roseanne Arnold , plus Al Pacino , Angela Lansbury , Sally Kirkland , Anjelica Huston and Jack Lemmon . The evening ' s emotional highs were the heartfelt acceptance remarks that Tom Hanks gave as he won for best actor in a drama for his role in &quot; Philadelphia , &quot; as an attorney dying of AIDS , and the enthusiastic standing_ovation that greeted Peck as he announced Spielberg ' s directing award . Spielberg said the best film honor for &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; really belongs_to the 1 # 300 courageous survivors of the Polish concentration_camp depicted in his movie . It was an emotional moment also for Spielberg ' s co-producers Branko Lustig , who survived the Auschwitz camp , and Gerald Molen , who observed &quot; that one man can and did make a difference &quot; -- the suggestion being that Schindler took_a_chance and so did Spielberg . In remarks backstage , Spielberg was asked if &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; was the favorite of his films . &quot; You ' re not supposed to prefer one child over another . But since the others won ' t take it personally , I can say that ' Schindler &quot; is my proudest moment as a filmmaker . . . . I ' d trade three ' Jurassic Parks ' . . . for all_the letters that I ' ve gotten since the movie opened. &quot; Asked about an incident last week where rowdy , laughing students in Oakland disrupted a showing of his film , Spielberg had this response : &quot; In certain socioeconomic circles a lot of kids are desensitized to violence , because of what ' s happening in the streets . Lots of them are living their own Holocaust. &quot; Hanks said , in part : &quot; It is odd and surreal for me to stand here and say that I feel lucky . As a heterosexual man who does not have AIDS , to say that I was lucky to play him -- a gay_man who suffers from terminal AIDS -- to stand here tonight after all that we ' ve been through as a city , to stand here today in the midst of all that we ' re going through as a nation , as a_people , as a society in the face of the current Holocaust that is taking hundreds of thousands of lives . However , I have to say that I am a very lucky man. &quot; In all , &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; won three awards , the most of any film . Screenwriter Steven Zaillian picked_up the prize for his work . Robin Williams won as best actor in a comedy for his cross-dressing role as a nanny in &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire , &quot; and the film was named best film -- comedy or musical . That tied with &quot; Philadelphia &quot; as a winner of two prizes . A surprised Angela Bassett arrived on stage to whoops and cheers as she collected the best actress prize in a musical or comedy for her performance as pop star Tina Turner in &quot; What ' s Love Got to Do With It. &quot; Holly Hunter , who won as best actress in a drama , for her non-speaking role in &quot; The Piano , &quot; told the press : &quot; It ' s remarkable how much I didn ' t miss speaking . There ' s a magic -- and a lot of economy -- in keeping things private for yourselves . Still , nine weeks into the shoot , ( co-star ) Sam Neill and I were sitting in the make-up trailer and I said to him that I felt I hadn ' t done my part yet . that ' s probably because I hadn ' t spoken. &quot; On the television side , the Castle Rock Entertainment sitcom &quot; Seinfeld &quot; on NBC collected three prizes -- for best series , actor , and supporting actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus . HBO ' s cutthroat business drama &quot; Barbarians at the Gate &quot; and its star James Garner won two Golden Globes . Another multiple winner was ABC ' s controversial dramatic series &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; produced by Steven Bochco Productions . It won as best series and for actor David Caruso . Backstage , Caruso told reporters : &quot; I was one of the people living_in the 100 buildings destroyed in Santa Monica ( by the earthquake ) . So this is a nice way to end the week . I guess I see this as a vindication since people at one point were_after the show ( for its language and occasional nudity ) .
