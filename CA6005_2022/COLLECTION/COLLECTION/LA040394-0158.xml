   <HEADLINE> WHAT ' S THEIR NEW LINE ? DEALING FOR BIG DOLLARS ; WITH TED TURNER ' S BACKING , THE STUDIO HAS MOVED FROM GENRE FILMS INTO EXPENSIVE STAR VEHICLES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even in a town where big deals are commonplace , this one grabbed Hollywood ' s attention . New Line Cinema , known for modestly budgeted genre-driven film series such_as &quot; A Nightmare on Elm Street &quot; and &quot; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , &quot; had paid a staggering $ 7 million to comedian Jim Carrey to star in a movie called &quot; Dumb &amp; Dumber. &quot; The movie company had paid him only $ 450 # 000 to star in its upcoming release , &quot; The Mask , &quot; but that was prior to the surprise box-office success of his comedy &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective &quot; for Warner Bros. , which has grossed more_than $ 64 million to date . But the comedian , perhaps best known for his zany characters on the Fox-TV show &quot; In Living Color , &quot; had no previous track record in feature_films . &quot; Everyone was stunned ( by the Carrey deal ) , &quot; said one industry source . &quot; I think the guy made $ 350 # 000 ( for &quot; Ace &quot; ) , and all_of a sudden someone was handing him $ 7 million. &quot; At the same time , New Line paid $ 3.3 million for Marlon Brando to star opposite Johnny Depp , who received $ 2.75 million , in &quot; Don Juan De Marco and the Centerfold. &quot; Francis Ford Coppola was paid $ 1 million to produce the movie . In rapid succession , New Line also paid a high six-figure sum for a romantic comedy spec script called &quot; Desperate_Measures &quot; ; spent $ 400 # 000 to option a script called &quot; Mango &quot; ( described as an &quot; Odd Couple &quot; -type story in which the Felix character is played by an orangutan ) ; and won a seven-figure bidding war for action director John Woo ( &quot; Hard Target &quot; ) to do a film about a Florida cop tied_up with the mob . They also spent $ 300 # 000 to option &quot; Second Defense , &quot; a big sci-fi movie with Arnold Kopelson ( &quot; The Fugitive &quot; ) producing . If that wasn ' t enough , sources told The Times that New Line currently is in discussions with Carrey on yet another $ 7-million deal to star in a sequel to &quot; The Mask &quot; and talks also are under way inside the company on whether he will star in a movie called &quot; The Best Man. &quot; &quot; They ' re all_over town throwing gobs of money at everything , &quot; quipped one entertainment attorney . There was a time not long ago when the 27-year-old New Line Cinema would not have been a player in Hollywood ' s high-stakes bidding wars . The old New Line never could afford to make movies for more_than $ 15 million and most often they were_well under $ 10 million . Then Ted Turner arrived . In one decisive move , the Atlanta-based cable broadcasting mogul acquired New Line last year in a $ 550-million deal while also negotiating a separate deal worth $ 200 million for another independent , Castle Rock Entertainment , which has released such hits as &quot; In the Line_of_Fire &quot; and &quot; A Few Good Men. &quot; New Line suddenly had the means to compete for hot scripts and A-list actors , directors and writers . &quot; Now , if we found the right vehicle , &quot; said New Line founder and chairman Robert Shaye , &quot; it would only take a telephone_call to Ted and he would provide us with the wherewithal required. &quot; Shaye ' s deal with Turner was so lucrative , in fact , sources said , that as a way of thanking people for his success he invited dozens of close friends to show_up at midnight last Wednesday at Los Angeles International Airport for a mystery charter flight to an unknown warm-weather destination for a four-day vacation . Before Turner , New Line officials said , the company had already decided to expand , but now the process has been accelerated . &quot; We had gone from producing seven films a year to 11 , &quot; said Michael De Luca , New Line ' s president of production . &quot; Post-Turner , we ' re going to try and do 15 a year and three to five of the extra films will be bigger -- directly competitive with the major-studio type of movie . For those films , our budgets will be anywhere from $ 18 million to $ 25 million. &quot; Shaye said that Turner has not broached the subject of what films would be taboo under his ownership and has assured company officials they have autonomy to choose projects . &quot; As he said to me , &quot; Shaye recalled , &quot; ' I ' m not into horror films , but when I was a kid I was . I understand when you are making films for a particular market , you have to understand the market you are making them for. ' His perspective is that whenever possible , take the high road. &quot; Turner told a theater exhibitors convention in Las Vegas recently that his newly purchased companies have more_than $ 500 million in negatives in_progress and that he intends to &quot; kick that up over the next couple of years to over $ 1 billion. &quot; While Castle Rock has already proven it can attract big stars like Clint Eastwood , Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise to its productions , New Line must persuade a wary town that it can do likewise . This &quot; mini-major &quot; studio located in Beverly Hills and New York must show the creative community that it has the marketing savvy to bring_out hit films . The task of selling the town on New Line has fallen on De Luca , 28 , and Richard Saperstein , 32 , the executive_vice_president of production . They are an unlikely pair . De Luca , who grew_up in the company and has been there since he was 19 , wears an earring and trimmed beard , speaks with a soft Brooklyn accent and is just as likely to arrive_at work in Nikes and jeans astride a Harley-Davidson as in an Armani suit at the wheel of his teal Mercedes . Saperstein , a former agent at International Creative Management , seems most comfortable in a blue suit , black shoes and white shirt ( with red polka-dot tie ) . He has studied English literature , dabbled_in poetry and once wrote speeches for Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) . De Luca said that his favorite film is &quot; Lawrence of Arabia , &quot; although he longs for a return of the anti-hero films of the 1970s like &quot; Serpico &quot; and &quot; Dog Day Afternoon. &quot; &quot; To make a ' Taxi Driver ' today would be ideal , &quot; he said . Saperstein said that he would like to make movies like &quot; When Harry Met Sally . . . &quot; or &quot; Terms of Endearment. &quot; &quot; One of my favorite movies is ' The Man Who Would Be King , ' &quot; he said . For the past few months , these men with starkly contrasting styles have been meeting with many of the top agents in town , explaining how New Line will now go_after bigger-budget films . &quot; I want a ' Mrs . Doubtfire ' so bad . . . , &quot; De Luca said , referring to the Robin Williams comedy that has grossed more_than $ 200 million for 20th Century Fox . With Turner ' s deep pockets , New Line has made_it known that it is willing to spend the big bucks . &quot; For the right actor , we ' d offer $ 15 million , &quot; Saperstein said . De Luca conceded that the bidding for Carrey probably went too high at $ 7 million . &quot; Maybe we overpaid a little bit , but ( Carrey ) was already up for $ 4-million and $ 5-million offers ( from Universal and 20th Century Fox ) , &quot; De Luca said . &quot; If we overpaid , it was only by $ 1 million or $ 2 million. &quot; What also moved New Line to act decisively , De Luca said , was that Carrey ' s next film , &quot; The Mask , &quot; is already in the can for New Line and company officials think that it will be a monster hit this summer . So do exhibitors , judging from the strong positive reaction they gave the film ' s trailer at ShoWest Convention in Las Vegas last month . At $ 20 million , &quot; The Mask &quot; is New Line ' s biggest in-house production to date . Based on a dark , best-selling comic series , the PG-13 film will feature state-of-the-art special_effects with a visual effects budget exceeding $ 7 million . Ken Ralston and Lucasfilm ' s Industrial Light &amp; Magic have created digital and optical special_effects for the movie . Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss , who finds a mask and is instantly transformed into a whirlwind of light and power , a human top spinning around his apartment , until he becomes a green-faced contortionist who knows how to fulfill every desire , satisfy every whim and play all kinds of pranks . Carrey said that it was a combination of his success with &quot; Ace Ventura &quot; and what they saw in &quot; The Mask &quot; that made New Line not want him to jump to another studio with his next film . &quot; For them , it ' s a vote_of_confidence in ' The Mask , ' &quot; Carrey said of his multimillion-dollar deal with New Line . &quot; They would n ' t be going this far out with anybody unless they thought they had something that was very cool. &quot; Besides &quot; The Mask , &quot; New Line ' s 1994 lineup includes &quot; Corrina , Corrina , &quot; in which Whoopi Goldberg stars as a housekeeper hired by a recently widowed father ( Ray Liotta ) ; &quot; In the Mouth of Madness , &quot; John Carpenter ' s psychological horror film about an insurance investigator who must find a missing writer whose latest novel wreaks havoc on the life of anyone who reads it , and &quot; Wes Craven ' s New Nightmare , &quot; a return of Freddy Krueger by the creator of &quot; A Nightmare on Elm Street. &quot; New Line ' s emergence as a deal maker has not come without controversy . A small film company called Outlaw Productions recently filed suit against the company , claiming that New Line stole &quot; Don Juan De Marco and the Centerfold. &quot; &quot; For whatever reason , these guys with their new-found muscle , decided to take_over the project , &quot; said one Hollywood source . &quot; They wanted to be seen in a high-profile project in which Marlon Brando and Francis Ford Coppola were working together again ( since &quot; Apocalypse Now &quot; ) . &quot; New Line would not comment on the suit . Despite its longevity , New Line has had to reinvent itself to keep competitive . No longer just a niche marketing and distribution company , the independent movie operation now must earn respect from Hollywood ' s more mainstream creative community . &quot; I think Richard and I are in the ' We need to prove it to the town ' phase of our existence , &quot; says De Luca , &quot; because whenever you start doing something you haven ' t done before , the attitude is ' Prove it to us.
