   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS ; LOOK WHO ' S WANTED ; INTEREST IN HIRING U.S. SKI STAFF INCREASES AFTER AMERICANS ' SUCCESSFUL FIRST WEEK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> America , hide your ski coaches . Two weeks after the U.S. Alpine team was branded &quot; the left-footed snow-plow brigade , &quot; by Sports Illustrated , top European ski countries reportedly are wooing top American ski team staffers . The U.S. team , in a reversal of fortunes , has already won four medals in skiing -- more_than traditional Alpine powers Austria , Switzerland and France combined . &quot; Funny how it changes things , &quot; said Howard Peterson , the outgoing CEO of U.S. Skiing . Peterson said that a Swiss counterpart , whom he would not name , has inquired about obtaining the services of U.S. men ' s coach Ueli Luthi . &quot; He didn ' t even know what Ueli does , &quot; Peterson said . Amazing what four medals in five events will do for a_couple_of reputations . Peterson was the man held most accountable for U.S. skiing woes in the recent Sports Illustrated article . And now even he is beating away offers from the Europeans . &quot; There are two countries who want to hire me , &quot; he said . Peterson declined to name the countries . He took_over as head of U.S. Skiing six years ago but was replaced last fall by Mike Jacki . Peterson will continue with the team through the spring , easing Jacki ' s transition . Paul Major , the U.S. Alpine director , said many of the top Alpine countries are in a frenzy over their poor Olympic performances . &quot; that ' s always going_on , especially this time_of_year , &quot; Major said of the coach-hunting . &quot; Because the teams that aren ' t doing_well are all nervous , their bosses are running_around saying , ' Ah , we ' re going to fire this guy. ' It ' s kind of a sad statement , but that ' s the way it goes. &quot; Austria and France have yet to win an Alpine medal here . Switzerland won its first Monday , when Vreni Schneider took the silver in women ' s combined . Major , also the U.S. women ' s coach , would not say whether he had received any job offers . &quot; I would n ' t tell you if I did , &quot; Major said .</TEXT>
