   <TEXT> The attack of the phantom killers came_on a warm September night in 1991 . Schools of menhaden , a herring-like fish , were swimming down the Neuse River on their annual migration to the sea when they suddenly began battling an invisible foe . By the time the massacre ended six weeks later , millions of corpses were piled along three miles of beach , and it took a caravan of bulldozers to clear the sand of rotting carcasses . The mysterious fish kill -- the worst in state history -- was traced to a microorganism that dwells in the phosphate-laced waters of Pamlico Estuary , a bay along the Atlantic seashore overlooking the Outer Banks . The killer algae , which since has been detected in six states from Delaware to Florida , is the prime suspect in dozens of unsolved attacks on fish and shellfish . Algae blooms are not new ; they probably date_back to biblical times . The first plague visited upon Egypt -- a &quot; bloody &quot; river , dead fish , stinking water -- was almost certainly what is known today as a red tide . But in recent years , algae slimes dense enough to suffocate marine life have been swelling around the world , especially in coastal bays such_as Pamlico Estuary . They are largely caused by fertilizing pollutants called nutrients in human sewage and farm runoff . Some marine experts call this &quot; fertilization &quot; a silent , global epidemic that if unabated could destroy America ' s most scenic and commercially valuable waters . Despite a_few high-profile success stories , most notably Lake Erie , nutrient pollution is worsening . One of America ' s premier environmental laws -- the 1972 Clean Water Act -- has failed to cure the most insidious threat to bays , rivers and lakes . &quot; Nutrient loading is probably the single biggest problem to coastal ecosystems in the U.S. right now , and it will continue to get_worse before it gets better , &quot; said Brian Howes , a scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts who has researched the problem for 20 years . &quot; People are upset about oil spills , and they should be , but the thing with nutrients is that it is happening every day , all day , and in many , many areas it is widely spread and causing declines in coastal water quality and shellfish harvests , &quot; he said . &quot; Whole fisheries have collapsed . It can bring wholesale mass destruction or more subtle impacts on marine_animal communities. &quot; Nationally , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says that at least 3.2 million acres of lakes , 4 # 700 square_miles of estuaries and 82 # 000 miles of streams are impaired by nutrients , which means they cannot fully support fishing , swimming and other uses . From Long_Island , N.Y. , to the Florida Keys , nutrients have devastated many of the East Coast ' s popular fishing spots and shellfish beds . Many coastal bays have turned the hue of pea_soup , and some have regressed to &quot; dead zones &quot; -- water so depleted of oxygen that only primitive creatures such_as bacteria and algae can survive . Meanwhile , an unexplained surge of bizarre , poisonous forms of algae is occurring around the world ; scientists suspect excessive nutrients could be a primary cause . Ten toxic species -- which do not just suffocate fish , but poison them -- have been discovered since the mid-1980s . Most of the 127 coastal estuaries in the United States suffer some symptoms of nutrient overload , although the damage varies greatly , according to government data and interviews with scientists . * At Long_Island , a dense bloom as dark as coffee appears every summer and has wiped_out bay_scallops by smothering the eelgrass that fish use when nursing . * In the Florida Keys , a deep bay that a decade ago was as transparent as gin is covered with thick green scum . Coral beds are dying and the shrimping industry has virtually collapsed . * At Chesapeake Bay , the nation ' s largest estuary , the oyster industry has declined 90 % in 35 years because of nutrient buildup , overfishing and disease ; striped bass and other fish also have declined dramatically . * Near Cape_Cod , Mass. , Waquoit Bay is covered with thick carpets of green_algae that resemble steel_wool ; once-abundant oysters and scallops are disappearing . * About 70 miles of Gulf waters at the mouth of the Mississippi_River are virtually without oxygen . The problem could stem from a variety of pollutants , but the river has a serious nutrient problem largely because more_than 600 sewage plants dump into it . The brunt of the damage , both economic and environmental , has hit bays along the Atlantic and Gulf_of_Mexico . These poorly flushed , slow-moving waters are more vulnerable to vast volumes of sewage and farm runoff than the deep , churning Pacific . &quot; The East Coast estuaries are typically quite shallow and they drain very large rivers . The combination of the two makes the coastal zone a target , &quot; said Raymond Alden , director of the Applied Marine Research Laboratory at Old_Dominion University in Norfolk , Va . Cleaning_up such widespread pollution is a massive challenge because nutrients -- nitrogen and phosphorus -- come from many sources , mainly sewage plants , septic_tanks , livestock farms and fertilizer used on crops and yards . New research also shows that large volumes of fertilizing nitrogen are falling from the air , mostly from car exhaust . In some urban_areas , one-third of nutrients polluting waterways are linked to air_pollution . But whether it is sewage , farms or cars , the problem mainly stems from burgeoning populations . &quot; The nutrient load has been increasing exponentially with the population . Anywhere you have a growing population you have a problem , &quot; said James T . Hollibaugh , director of San Francisco State University ' s marine laboratory . Called nutrients because they nourish plants , phosphorus and nitrates are beneficial to marine ecosystems in small quantities . But such large volumes of human_waste and farm fertilizer carried into streams can trigger a phenomenon called eutrophication -- algae blooms so dense that oxygen levels drop to zero near the bottom . Without oxygen , many fish suffocate and sea grasses , where fish and shellfish breed and nurse , die . Melvin Shepard , a commercial fisherman in North Carolina for 35 years , said finding enough fish to make a living has become harder . He said he is absolutely certain the nutrients from farms and sewage are to blame . &quot; The pollution in our rivers in North Carolina is absolutely terrible , &quot; said Shepard , 60 . &quot; In some of our rivers , there are areas two-thirds of the way down where not even clams live . They have gradually died . There are less fish of all kinds. &quot; Marine scientists suspect such fishermen ' s tales are true because they believe nutrients are forcing subtle shifts in the food_chain of coastal waters . &quot; It can change everything , the whole dynamics of an area , because there are such delicate threads among species , &quot; said Karen Steidinger , a senior scientist at Florida Marine Research Institute in St . Petersburg who is known for her work with algae . &quot; What happens with high nutrients , you get different species compositions , different species dominating . What you wind_up with is a blue-green_algae that nothing wants to eat and spits_out . You ' re short-circuiting the ecological efficiency of an area. &quot; Coastal waters also contain lots of bacteria , which come hand-in-hand with nutrients in sewage and farm waste . In nearly every coastal bay in the nation , shellfish beds that are critical to local economies and recreation have been shut_down by the human disease threat posed by contamination , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Harvesting of shellfish has been banned or restricted in 37 % of the nation ' s waters -- more_than 6 million acres -- and experts predict that more beds will be shut_down . &quot; Although declines in any given year are not dramatic , an almost inexorable trend that threatens to destroy the harvest of wild or natural shellfish continues throughout the nation ' s coastal areas , &quot; according to the 1990 National Shellfish Register , a five-year study by the NOAA . Southern California streams have the dubious distinction of carrying the nation ' s heftiest volumes of both nitrogen and phosphorus because of the region ' s enormous volumes of urban runoff , sewage and farm waste , according to U.S. Geological Survey measurements taken at about 400 sites . As a result , a_few California estuaries , including Newport Bay in Orange County and Elkhorn Slough near Monterey , have murky , algae-prone waters and the state ' s once-productive shellfish industry has been virtually wiped_out by bacteria contamination . But the impact on aquatic life in California is much more discreet than in the East Coast , where waters routinely are discolored and millions of fish smothered . &quot; We typically have deeper , colder waters that assimilate nutrients much better than East Coast waters , &quot; said Craig Wilson , chief of bays and estuaries at the California Water Resources Control_Board . &quot; We just haven ' t had the same kind of depressions in oxygen concentrations that kill fish. &quot; Progress has been made in tackling some of the most visible symptoms of nutrient overload . Twenty-five years ago , Lake Erie was loaded with so_much phosphate that soap_bubbles piled_up on its surface in 15-foot heaps . As a result , phosphates were banned nationwide in laundry_detergents and industries were regulated . Congress passed the Clean Water Act , setting a lofty goal of making waterways safe for fish and people by 1983 . Many freshwater lakes , including Erie , did improve in the 1970s . But the nutrient problem began to re-emerge in the mid-1980s , this time in coastal estuaries , primarily because more people were moving to the coast and bringing sewage and runoff . &quot; There are places where it is really bad , there are places where it is getting_worse , but there are only a_few places where it has gotten better , &quot; said Suzanne Bricker of NOAA , which launched a project in 1992 to assess the nation ' s estuaries . The problem ' s persistence is a main reason environmental groups are pushing to strengthen the Clean Water Act . The debate , heating_up in Congress this year , centers mostly on the cost . Who should pay to cleanse the dirty waterways ? Farmers , home builders and small municipalities all fear the burden will fall on them . Sewage plants are the leading cause of pollution in the nation ' s coastal bays , with agriculture and urban runoff close behind , according to the EPA . Many coastal communities conduct no sewage treatment -- they still rely_on septic_tanks where raw waste seeps into the ground and eventually into streams and bays . Most cities and counties with treatment plants have not installed expensive technology that removes nutrients . &quot; One of the real quiet crises is when we put sewage in our estuaries and it ' s gone -- out_of_sight , out of mind . Very , very small concentrations are causing dramatic changes , &quot; said JoAnn Burkholder , a North Carolina State aquatic botanist who identified the toxic algae in the Pamlico Estuary . At Cape_Cod , the number of homes has risen dramatically along Waquoit Bay since World_War_II , yet all sewage is handled by septic_tanks . Nitrogen in the waste filters rapidly through the sandy soil and seeps into the bay . &quot; It slowly builds_up over time . We ' re mainly just documenting a resource that is degrading , &quot; said Charlene D ' Avanzo , a marine ecologist at Hampshire College in Massachusetts . The transformation of Florida Bay , a deep estuary nestled between the tip of the Everglades and the Keys , is one of the most alarming examples . The waters appeared turquoise crystal until 10 years ago , when algal blooms started appearing and turned the water greenish-brown . Algal blooms now occur year-round and stretch over hundreds of square_miles , said Brian La Pointe of Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution . As the algal blooms started , coral beds and sea grasses began dying and shrimp populations declined dramatically . Fishermen report fewer grouper , snapper and other popular fish . &quot; And it ' s going_to get greener and greener , &quot; La Pointe said . &quot; The reason we are going_to eclipse places like Chesapeake Bay , Boston Harbor and Lake Erie ( in damage ) is because tropical ecosystems like this have exceedingly low thresholds for die-offs . They are the most sensitive ecosystems in the world ' s oceans. &quot; Some researchers say nitrogen from sugar farms and phosphate flowing into the Gulf from a mine near Tampa are to blame , although there is no conclusive proof . La Pointe said the connection is unmistakable , and he blames the state and federal_governments for allowing increased volumes of farm runoff to flow through the Everglades into the bay . &quot; I sounded this alarm way back in ' 84 and ' 85 and it ( has ) fallen on deaf ears . The denial of the problem has continued up_to present , &quot; he said . &quot; Nobody wants to believe that Florida Bay , which is surrounded by one of the world ' s most famous wetlands , could possibly be polluted because of its remoteness. &quot; Other coastal areas have had obvious problems for years . Since the 1980s , Peconic Bay on the east end of Long_Island has had a devastating series of summertime brown tides that kill shellfish . Researchers believe the problem is tied to massive sewage plants serving the New York City area . &quot; It grows very rapidly and shades out the light so that eelgrass , which is essential for scallops and other marine organisms to use as a nursery area , dies . This ( algae ) has caused many , many millions of dollars in damage , &quot; said Edward Carpenter , a professor of biological oceanography at State University of New York who wrote a book on nitrogen pollution in 1981 . Chesapeake Bay , the nation ' s largest estuary , is perhaps the most famous case of nitrogen overload . It has pea-soup water , no grasses where fish spawn and suffers periodic fish kills . Making matters worse , there is no single cause such_as a sewage plant . The huge bay catches the urban waste , air_pollution and farm runoff that flows_from one-quarter of the Eastern Seaboard . An agreement drawn_up by four states surrounding the Chesapeake calls_for a 40 % reduction in phosphorus and nitrogen by 2000 , including efforts to build advanced sewage plants . Other areas also are starting to search for solutions . In Pennsylvania , dairy_farms are installing costly systems to contain cow manure . In Delaware , a municipal sewage plant is spending $ 12 million to remove nutrients discharged into Rehoboth Bay . &quot; It is next to impossible to find who to regulate because the problem is essentially the citizenry , &quot; said Alden of Old_Dominion . &quot; The best we can do is implement some controls and slow the decline , &quot; he said . &quot; There are a lot of people who want to turn the Chesapeake Bay back to when ( colonist ) John Smith first floated in on it . I don ' t want to say I ' m pessimistic , but I ' m not a starry-eyed optimist either. &quot; Next : Scientists look_at the link between poisonous algae and human health . Portrait of a Troubled Bay Many bays along the Atlantic Coast have been devastated by a buildup of pollutants from the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous , which come mainly from human sewage and farms . Here is an example , based on Delaware ' s Inland Bays , of how such damage occurs in shallow estuaries along the ocean . 1 ) Waste from farms , dairies , sewage treatment plants and household septic_tanks flows into creeks that empty into a coastal bay . 2 ) Waste flowing toward the coast meets ocean tides . The salt water is held underneath the waste , forming a nutrient trap . 3 ) Nutrients become concentrated_on the water surface and begin nourishing phytoplankton , causing thick algae blooms . 4 ) Algae take_in oxygen from the bottom of the bay and block sunlight . 5 ) Without sufficient oxygen and light , the bay bottom becomes a dark dead zone that smothers areas of submerged sea grasses where marine life spawns . Fish , oysters , clams and other species start to die . The entire food_chain can be affected , including birds that feed_on fish . Life in an Estuary Here are some examples of sealife found in estuaries , the places where freshwater streams meet the sea : A ) Eelgrass : This submerged , ribbon-like plant , once common along the East Coast , has been virtually wiped_out by pollution and development . B ) Striped bass : These fish , which grow to six feet , live mostly in or near estuaries , moving between fresh and salt water . The species was in severe decline along the Atlantic coast , but is_on its way back because of fishing restrictions . C ) Blue_crab : These tasty crabs , an important commercial species , reach a width of nine inches . They are common in estuaries and seem to be doing_well despite pollution . D ) Shrimp : Found in shallow waters along the Atlantic coast that are vulnerable to pollution , these crustaceans have been depleted in many areas . E ) Oysters : These shellfish have been decimated on both coasts . Chesapeake Bay ' s harvest , 32 million pounds per year in the 1950s , dropped to 3.7 million pounds in 1990 . F ) Soft-shelled clams : These whitish clams with gaping shells are found in water depths to 30 feet . Waters off New Jersey are the biggest source of harvested clams . G ) Winter_flounder : Adult flounder spend summers in the ocean but move_into estuaries in winter to spawn . They are declining because of estuary pollution .</TEXT>
