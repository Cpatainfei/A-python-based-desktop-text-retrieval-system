   <HEADLINE> KERRIGAN DEFENDS IMAGE AFTER FIELDING CRITICISM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A week ago , Nancy Kerrigan could do little wrong . She had overcome one of sport ' s most bizarre incidents -- the Jan . 6 clubbing of her knee -- to win a silver medal in women ' s figure_skating at the XVII Winter_Olympics in Lillehammer , Norway . On Tuesday , she was responding to criticism of her actions since winning the medal Friday . Kerrigan ' s ice-smooth image suffered some cracks almost minutes after Oksana Baiul of Ukraine edged her for the gold medal . When she was told -- mistakenly -- that the medal ceremony had been delayed because Baiul was redoing her makeup , an annoyed Kerrigan was heard on television saying : &quot; Oh , come_on . So she ' s going_to get_out here and cry again . What ' s the difference ? &quot; Kerrigan said her remarks were not meant to slight Baiul , 16 . &quot; I ' ve been through an Olympic medal ceremony before , and they are always very emotional , &quot; she said in a statement . &quot; Everyone cries . I was afraid the crowd was losing its enthusiasm and was starting to leave. &quot; Kerrigan left Norway before the closing ceremony to attend a parade at Disney World in Orlando , Fla. , although Disney officials said the parade could have been held another day . Then , a TV report showed a videotape of Kerrigan , sitting in a Disney World parade next to a Mickey_Mouse character , saying : &quot; This is so corny , this is so dumb . I hate it . This is the most corny thing I ' ve ever done. &quot; Responded Kerrigan : &quot; I was not saying that the parade was corny or dumb . I enjoyed it tremendously . Riding down Main_Street with Mickey_Mouse -- what could be better than that ? &quot; What I was commenting on to my mother was her insistence that I wear my medal during the parade . Since I was a little_girl , I was told not to brag . I was afraid it might look_like bragging and I ' m not comfortable with that. &quot;</TEXT>
