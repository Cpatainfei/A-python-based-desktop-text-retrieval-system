   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; CLEAR AND PRESENT PROPOSAL TO EXPAND A PARTNERSHIP ; FILM : PRODUCERS MACE NEUFELD AND ROBERT REHME WANT TO BRING_OUTSIDE FINANCING TO THEIR PROJECTS FOR PARAMOUNT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the title of their latest hit film indicates , producers Mace Neufeld and Robert Rehme are familiar_with the clear_and_present_dangers involved in making techno-action movies . There was the rebellion in southern Mexico that nearly cost them the right to film special-effects explosives scenes in that country , which they used as a double for Colombia . Then there was the scene that called_for blowing_up a drug lord ' s home--a problem finally solved when they found a couple going_through a bitter divorce who were eager to off their house . Still , nothing topped January ' s Northridge earthquake , in which five reels of close-ups that would have been used in the film ' s final scene were ruined . Despite those hurdles , the duo ' s &quot; Clear_and_Present_Danger , &quot; starring Harrison Ford , turned_into one of the summer ' s biggest hits . It crossed the benchmark $ 100-million point Thursday in domestic box_office receipts and is likely to be the biggest of the three films to date based on the adventures of novelist Tom Clancy ' s CIA agent Jack Ryan . It is also one of two main reasons--the other being &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; --that Paramount Pictures is enjoying its biggest summer in years , with a domestic box_office total of about $ 413 million , just a shade behind front-runner Walt Disney Co . &quot; Mace and Bob have delivered to this company one of its most important franchises ever . These movies aren ' t easy to put_together . They ' ve not only managed to keep it going , but elevate it , &quot; Paramount production chief John Goldwyn said . With &quot; Clear_and_Present_Danger &quot; and other hit films such_as &quot; Patriot Games &quot; as calling cards , Neufeld and Rehme hope to expand their five-year partnership even further by bringing_outside financing to their projects at Paramount . Private financing deals are gaining in popularity with big-name producers because they reap bigger profits from hit films . Producers can also make more movies , as well as riskier films that a studio might be reluctant to fund with its own money . Neufeld and Rehme haven ' t identified a source of financing but say they hope to make as_many as five films a year under such an arrangement , up from the two a year they can handle now . Paramount ' s openness to such a deal is a sea change in itself . In years past , parent Paramount Communications Inc. was always so flush with cash there was no need or desire to forgo any rights to its films . But with its acquisition by Viacom Inc. this year , Paramount is now eager to do such deals under Viacom Entertainment Group Vice_Chairman Jonathan Dolgen . It recently signed a similar agreement with Douglas / Reuther Productions . Neufeld , 66 , and Rehme , 59 , both defy the stereotype of hotshot Hollywood producers . Both are grandfathers who spend little time on the Hollywood social circuit . They also remain active in TV , despite their success in the higher-profile and more prestigious film business . Neufeld and Rehme were executive producers on the critically acclaimed &quot; Gettysburg &quot; --which had a brief theatrical release last year--and are developing another miniseries for Turner Films on Los Angeles gang violence . Rehme is a longtime studio executive who started as a movie usher_in his hometown of Cincinnati . He eventually held posts at Universal , Avco Embassy and was one of the partners at New World . Neufeld has the more eclectic background . His work has ranged from producing the hit TV series &quot; Cagney &amp; Lacey &quot; to helping develop the careers of such stars as Neil Diamond and Don Adams to writing the theme_song for the &quot; Heckle and Jeckle &quot; cartoon show . The two had been friends for years when they united as producers shortly after Rehme and his partners sold New World to billionaire Ronald Perelman in 1989 . Neufeld was already producing &quot; The Hunt for Red October &quot; for Paramount , the first of Clancy ' s books featuring Jack Ryan to be made into a film . After having been pitched projects , being_on the other side of the desk was a new experience for Rehme . &quot; One of the frustrations you experience as a producer is developing what you consider to be very good material and having it rejected , &quot; Rehme says . &quot; Having been_on the other side of the desk , I never did quite appreciate the impact . I must have said no 5 # 000 times. &quot; Rehme still watches the openings of their films with the same nervousness he did as a studio executive . He ' s also been known to irritate theater managers by suggesting they adjust the sound or the focus of his pictures . Neufeld is considered the more hands-on production executive , overseeing even the smallest details on films . He is also the one called_on to act_as diplomat in settling problems , such_as easing concerns of the Mexican government when seeking permission to film . One of the more difficult problems has been with Clancy himself . The author openly complained in the past that Ford is too old to play Ryan . Neufeld and Rehme say they feel vindicated both by the glowing reviews and the box_office numbers for &quot; Clear and Present Danger. &quot; Producers ' Success Stories Some of the films produced by Mace Neufeld and Robert Rehme individually or as a team .
