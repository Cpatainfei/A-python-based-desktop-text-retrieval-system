   <TEXT> Henry Kay survived a concentration_camp because the Nazis needed children to make weapons . Now , children of a more peaceful era will learn the lessons of his life and the lives of other Holocaust victims . Kay was present Friday when Gov . Lawton Chiles signed into law a requirement that Florida pupils learn about the slaughter of Jews and others during World_War_II . &quot; I would never have dreamed of being here , &quot; the 64-year-old Kay said . &quot; It ' s actions like today that give us the hope that the Holocaust will become a recognized part of history -- to help humanity earn its name. &quot; Politicians , Jewish leaders and students attended the bill-signing ceremony at Miami Beach City_Hall . Traditional Jewish prayers , songs and speeches reduced some people to tears . &quot; The souls of those who perished in the Holocaust still cry_out_for justice -- not through retribution , but through education and enlightenment -- the truest enemies of tyranny and brutality , &quot; Chiles said . The law requires that the history of the Holocaust show the results of prejudice and the need to protect democracy . Similar laws have been passed in California , Illinois and Washington . Nevada , New Jersey , North Carolina and South Carolina have laws creating advisory councils on Holocaust education . The new curriculum , which takes_effect July 1 , will be directed at the state ' s half-million high_school students , but may also be used in middle_schools , said Debi Gallay of the Education_Department . Rositta E . Kenigsberg , the executive_vice_president of the Holocaust Documentation and Education Center Inc. , said education is the only way to keep alive the memory of the slaughter of 6 million people . &quot; As long as there is someone to tell the story , there is life , &quot; Kenigsberg said . &quot; As long as there is someone to listen , there is hope. &quot;</TEXT>
