   <HEADLINE> RELATIONSHIPS : TIME SHARES ; JOINT PHYSICAL CUSTODY IS INCREASING AS AN OPTION IN DIVORCE CASES . WHEN CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT , CHILDREN MAY BENEFIT BY DIVIDING THEIR TIME EQUALLY BETWEEN THE HOMES OF PARENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dee Wade of Fountain Valley expected to make traditional divorce arrangements , so she was shocked by what the divorce mediator suggested . The couple ' s 3-year-old daughter , Veronica , should spend alternate weeks living with one parent , then the other , the mediator urged . It ' s called joint physical custody . &quot; The mediator gave me information that showed it could be a positive experience , but that just fed my intellect , &quot; Wade said . &quot; Emotionally , I wanted my daughter with me on a full-time basis. &quot; After eight years , Wade has a different view . Afraid at first that the shuttling between households would damage the girl emotionally , Wade instead has seen her daughter grow_into a happy , well-adjusted 11-year-old . &quot; Her father is a good parent , and we have basically the same ideas in terms of rules and how to handle situations , &quot; Wade said . &quot; Veronica was happy to stay with both of us and has developed friends in both neighborhoods . She ' s been going_back and forth since she remembers , and to her this is how life is. &quot; It ' s how life is for an increasing number of children and their divorced parents as California courts , taking_advantage of a pioneering 1980 law that allowed joint legal custody , are decreeing joint physical custody as well . The Joint Custody Assn . in Los Angeles , which helped lobby for the 1980 legislation , estimates that joint legal custody is now being awarded in 80 % of divorce cases involving children . In about 20 % of such cases , parents are also being assigned roughly equal time with their children . All-out child custody_battles are notorious for being vitriolic , yet , even in seemingly amicable divorces , joint physical custody can be inappropriate , said Alexandra Rosenberg , a social_worker in Newport Beach . &quot; Kids may experience conflicting loyalties if the parents play each household off the other and try to be the better family , &quot; she said . Problems are compounded when each parent imposes different rules for manners and household chores . But when joint physical custody works , it works very well , Rosenberg said . Children grow_up with role_models of both sexes , which is nearly impossible to duplicate with merely occasional visitation , and each parent gets a regular respite from the pressures of single-parent child-rearing . &quot; Raising two boys can be exhausting when you ' re all alone with them , &quot; said Betty Callaway , 43 , an Irvine real_estate_agent . &quot; When they were younger , I was so frazzled by the time they went_to their dad ' s that I couldn ' t wait for them to leave . Then , when it was time for them to come_home , I couldn ' t wait to see them. &quot; The arrangement has allowed her to better balance her business and her child-rearing , Callaway said . &quot; When the kids are at their dad ' s , I will spend a lot of time at_work . The weeks they ' re with me , I focus more attention on them. &quot; And a joint physical custody arrangement can resolve the problem of fathers who , given only occasional visitation , become more like visitors than parents . David Foust , 40 , of Huntington Beach admitted he had been the breadwinning father who spent too_much time at_work and not enough time with his children . &quot; Now , when the kids are with me , I can ' t stay_at work , which is nice , &quot; he said . But some effects of such arrangements are less obvious . Child_support , for example , can change dramatically , said Nola McGuire , an Irvine attorney . California courts set the amount of child_support according to a formula that takes_into_account not only the income of both parents but the time children spend in each household . Joint physical custody can reduce or reverse the usual child-support situation , sometimes requiring that the mother pay support to the father . More involved fathers are also less likely to become deadbeat_dads , according to statistics . Fathers who share physical custody of their children pay their child_support more_than 90 % of the time , according to the 1993 Census , compared to 79 % for fathers who just have visitation privileges and 44.5 % for fathers without visitation provisions . And children , given regular , live-in access to their fathers , may avoid straying from the path , said Michael Pitts , executive_director of the Children ' s Rights Council in Washington , D.C. &quot; Studies show that over 80 % of people in prison come from single-parent homes . Gangs are_full of fatherless young people , &quot; Pitts said . &quot; Over the last 50 years many children have lost their fathers because of the court ' s obsession with sole-custody determination . The very idea of visitation connotes going_to see a stranger and implies a tenuous relationship. &quot; But Jonathan Cannon , a family law judge in Orange County , says there is a basic contradiction to such joint physical custody arrangements . &quot; In a way , it is ludicrous , because these type of situations require a great_deal of cooperation between two people who have demonstrated that they can ' t get along. &quot; Cannon said he will agree to such joint custody when couples request it , but only under the right circumstances . &quot; If both parents are good parents , then getting as close to a 50-50 split as possible is in the best interests of the children , &quot; he says . But such arrangements are feasible only when parents live close to one another and the child is between 2 and 5 years old . &quot; Before the age of 2 , I feel children are too young for a 50-50 split . And when they reach school age , it is best for their educational development to have a primary home during the school_year . They should sleep_in the same bed Monday through Thursday night . In such situations , I would grant a 60-40 or 65-35 split instead , &quot; Cannon said . There is no trouble finding examples of joint physical custody succeeding , said Leslee Newman , a family law attorney in Anaheim Hills . She originally thought such arrangements would fall_apart within six months , but &quot; I ' ve been surprised to find that shared custody arrangements , such_as week on , week off , are lasting longer . In some cases , such arrangements are lasting eight to 10 years . People are beginning to find that the best parents are both parents. &quot; Some of the children are the greatest boosters . &quot; I would n ' t want to see just my mom or just my dad , &quot; said Veronica Wade . &quot; I ' d miss the other parent too_much . I like seeing them both the same amount. &quot; Erik Callaway , 12 , who has alternated weeks living with one of his parents since he was 6 , said , &quot; I like living with both of my parents . In the beginning I got a little confused , but I ' m older now , and I ' m used to it . I would n ' t be happy if I only lived with one parent. &quot; Carissa Terry , 14 , of Huntington Beach , said she would n ' t have it any other way , even though she dislikes packing her bags every Monday to move to her other parent ' s house . &quot; I ' ve been living with both my parents a week at a time since I was 6 , and I ' m close to them both , &quot; she said . &quot; Many of my friends just see their dads every_other weekend , and most of them don ' t have close relationships with their fathers . I would n ' t like that. &quot; Nor would her sister Jill , 16 . &quot; If I just saw my dad every_other weekend , we would n ' t be as close . He ' d be more like an uncle. &quot; Their father , Lee Terry , 45 , said his child-custody philosophy is simple . He may have divorced his wife , he said , but he didn ' t divorce his kids . &quot; I strongly feel that fathers should have a chance to have custody . It ' s their duty to raise their children , and I think many men would like to share custody if they could. &quot; But Ron Wade , father of Veronica , said men should think carefully before choosing joint physical custody . Despite the movement for greater child-rearing rights for divorced fathers , &quot; A person must be really certain that he ' s willing to become a single parent for half the time. &quot; You need an understanding boss , because &quot; at times it ' s necessary to get time_off at a moment ' s notice , because your child is_sick and your spouse can ' t leave the office , &quot; Wade said . You need flexibility and civility in dealing with your ex-spouse . And you may wind_up , as Wade did , buying an entire second wardrobe for your children to reduce the need to pack clothes . Still , joint physical custody is steadily becoming more common , said James A . Cook , president of the Joint Custody Assn . &quot; I think it will become much more popular . The overwhelming drive for this generation is the drive for equality . It has absorbed all_of us . It ' s looked_upon as fairness . It doesn ' t decide custody -- the best interests of the child decides custody -- but we ' re finding that equality gets closest to that. &quot;</TEXT>
