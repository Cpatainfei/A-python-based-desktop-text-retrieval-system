   <HEADLINE> FIELD OF DREAMS ; OFFICER HELPS COMMUNITY REALIZE GOAL FOR A LOT TO BLOOM WITH SOCCER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wearing an uneasy smile and a corsage on her blue uniform , Officer Amanda Serrano waved politely when the crowd cheered her name , but it was obvious she wasn ' t caught_up in the day ' s festivities to honor the opening of a Westlake youth soccer field . &quot; I ' m just too nervous , &quot; the Los Angeles police_officer said while watching scores of gleeful children romp across the field during the July 15 event . &quot; This is our baby . I want everything to be just right. &quot; The creation of the field atop a lot that had sat vacant for 14 years is being hailed by locals as a model of what can be done when private businesses , residents and the government work together . And Serrano , they say , was right in the middle making things happen . &quot; She was the catalyst , &quot; said Paul Gamberg , president of a neighborhood association . &quot; She was a fulcrum , a physical lever that made this happen . . . she reached_out and picked the team that put this together . The quality of leadership that Mandy has is intention without reservation . She was a people-mover. &quot; Serrano said residents had often told her that a field was needed to provide some recreation outlet for the children who live_in the densely populated area . The closest park is three miles away , and many families don ' t have access to transportation . When some locals suggested the site at 3rd and Bixel streets -- a lot known years ago as Crown Hill that had become the site for homeless encampments -- Serrano started knocking_on doors and making phone_calls . The Ketchum Downtown YMCA was looking_for a place to put a field , and it enlisted in the effort . Soon , Cathay City Development , the Hong Kong-based owners of the lot , were being called_upon to temporarily donate the lot . After a year ' s worth of legwork , the &quot; Field of Dreams &quot; organizers persuaded Cathay to let the parcel be converted into a soccer field until a development project comes_along . &quot; A lot of people came_together to make this happen , &quot; Serrano said . &quot; I helped , but I certainly wasn ' t the only one. &quot; For Serrano , the field is not just a playground , it ' s a haven . &quot; The kids around here play soccer in the streets , and that ' s a prescription for trouble . It ' s a real simple formula. &quot; The streets hold other dangers for youngsters , she said . The field will offer organized soccer leagues and lessons by October , after-school options that might keep some youths from finding their way into trouble with gangs or drugs . Serrano , a four-year officer of the Rampart Division , is assigned to the department ' s Police Assisted Community Enhancement program . She and seven other senior lead officers in the division work closely with the community to find long-term answers to crime . &quot; The approach is to identify potential problems before they occur and find ways to get_to the root of problems that already exist , &quot; said Sgt . Ralph McComb , Serrano ' s former supervisor who attended the soccer field opening . &quot; With this project , she turned this trash_heap place into something the community could be proud of. &quot; The field was just the first phase of Serrano ' s plan for the neighborhood , which she describes as a troubled area with &quot; dedicated , energetic residents that have a strong sense of community. &quot; She also hopes to see a building being vacated by the Chamber_of_Commerce turn_into a youth center by the end of the year . The office_building , just a block away from the new soccer field , has a sprawling kitchen and indoor and outdoor dining_areas . * The site would be perfect for a community_center to give area youths a place to study arts and crafts , get tutoring and even learn about photography in a planned photo darkroom . &quot; It ' s almost a done deal , &quot; Serrano said . The Northridge native left a career in banking to become a policewoman six years ago because she wanted to help children , she said . She hopes to someday become a child-abuse investigator , but in the meantime she said she will enjoy her community policing post ' s challenges . &quot; One of the advantages of my type of assignment is I don ' t just meet people who are suspects and victims . I get_to encounter people in positive ways , &quot; Serrano said . &quot; And it ' s rewarding when things get done. &quot;</TEXT>
