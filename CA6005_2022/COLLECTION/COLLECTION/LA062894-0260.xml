   <HEADLINE> 2-MAN UKRAINIAN RUNOFF SET AS RETURNS TRICKLE IN ; ELECTION : INCUMBENT , FORMER PRIME_MINISTER WILL SQUARE OFF NEXT MONTH IN PRESIDENTIAL RACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Divided sharply over whether to look toward Europe or Russia , voters in this nation ' s presidential election put incumbent Leonid Kravchuk ahead in the west , favored former Prime_Minister Leonid Kuchma in the east and sent them into a two-man runoff next month . Official returns Monday from 16 of 27 regions gave Kuchma 36 % of the votes_in Sunday ' s election to 30 % for Kravchuk , followed by five other candidates . But that count was somewhat weighted toward Kuchma ' s expected strongholds . A more complete unofficial tally by Rukh , a nationalist movement that didn ' t field a candidate , put Kravchuk ahead of Kuchma 40 % to 35 % . Complete returns , expected today , may give a clearer picture of who will lead this nuclear-armed former Soviet republic of 52 million people for the next four years . Political analysts said any first-round lead by Kravchuk would be hard to overcome in the runoff because the president , who is weighing a possible Cabinet shake-up , is_better positioned to bargain for support from also-rans . Olexander Moroz , socialist chairman of the Parliament elected last spring , was running third in the official count with 15 % of the presidential vote . That put him in a position to press his demand for supreme power for the legislative_branch , dominated by centrists and Communists determined to slow even the timid free-market reforms backed by Kravchuk and Kuchma . The deal-making in days ahead may also involve Volodymyr Lanovoy , the only radical free-market reformer in the presidential race , who was running fourth with 10 % of the vote . By law , the runoff must be held by July 10 . A former Communist apparatchik , Kravchuk , now 60 , led Ukraine to independence from the Soviet_Union 2 1 / 2 years ago and has steered a cautious course between Russia and the West while presiding over bouts of hyper-inflation , industrial depression and growing unemployment . But in recent months he has moved decisively to join the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace , &quot; sign an accord with the European Union , begin dismantling Ukraine ' s nuclear arsenal and draft economic reforms that would bring the country $ 700 million in credits from the International Monetary Fund . Voters in western Ukraine , stronghold of the independence movement , applauded these moves and rewarded Kravchuk with 70 % to 80 % of the vote_in their regions . Kuchma , 55 , former director of the Soviet_Union ' s largest missile factory , argued that Kravchuk cut economic ties with Moscow too soon after the Soviet_Union collapsed and that restoring them would boost Ukraine ' s fortunes . He ran first in industrialized , Russian-speaking regions east of the Dnieper River , where poverty has soured sentiment for independence . He also got 82 % of the vote_in Crimea , in southern Ukraine , where a pro-Russian separatist movement came_to power in regional elections last spring . Political passions ran so high that 68 % of Ukraine ' s 38 million voters turned_up at the polls . But Kravchuk ran stronger in the eastern Russian-speaking areas than Kuchma did_in the west . The president made a late campaign swing through the east , trying to neutralize his challenger ' s appeal by offering to make Russian an official language . He also exploited fears in the rest of the country that Kuchma is too pro-Russian to prevent the absorption of eastern Ukraine into a political federation ruled from Moscow . Many Ukrainian politicians say that fear is exaggerated , and so is the east-west rift . Except for Crimea , Ukraine ' s Russian-speaking areas are led by politicians with no desire to join Russia . &quot; No matter who is elected president , he will have to establish normal relations with Russia , &quot; said Volodymyr Cherniak , a Rukh leader . Rukh was the only political_movement to declare its position for the runoff . Cherniak told reporters that Rukh leaders would offer to support Kravchuk if he agreed to promote a new constitution , strengthen the presidency ' s powers and hold_the_line on Ukrainian statehood .
