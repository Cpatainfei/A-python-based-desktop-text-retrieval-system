   <HEADLINE> REACTION OF L.A.-AREA JEWS AND ARABS MIXED ; PEACE PRIZE : MANY FEEL THAT THE NOBEL AWARD WAS GIVEN PREMATURELY , IN LIGHT OF THE CONTINUING VIOLENCE IN THE MIDEAST . PLO TERRORISM IS ALSO NOTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jews and Arabs in the Los Angeles area offered mixed reactions Friday to the news that Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO leader Yasser Arafat will share the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize . Many said the award came too early in the light of continuing Mideast violence . But others hailed it as a show of support for the peace process . Jewish leaders , including Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center , found the choice of Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization hard to swallow . They said this was especially true on a day when Israeli troops suffered casualties while storming a home where Islamic militants had held a kidnaped 19-year-old Israeli soldier . The hostage was killed , as were three kidnapers and an Israeli commando . Hier called the prize &quot; tragic and flawed. &quot; &quot; There is something inherently wrong when such a distinguished award becomes a means for repentant terrorists to gain instant respectability , &quot; he said . But Rabbi Laura Geller of Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills hailed Peres ' vision , Rabin ' s negotiating skills and Arafat ' s gumption in rising above the PLO ' s violent record . &quot; All three of them took risks in moving toward peace , &quot; she said . &quot; They all risked a great_deal , and they are all facing serious threats from extremists , as we ' ve seen just today . So my hope is that this prize supports the forces in the Middle_East that want there to be peace . We all recognize that this is still a very long road. &quot; At the Islamic Center of Southern California , spokesman Maher Hathout said the time was not right for awarding such a prize . &quot; It is premature because peace is not there yet , &quot; he said . And one of the worshipers , Amr Ali , said , &quot; All three of them don ' t deserve it . Israel is living_in peace but the Palestinians are definitely not living_in peace. &quot; While some Jewish spokesmen protested the choice of Arafat , saying he was a former terrorist , Hathout recalled that another Israeli prime_minister was similarly honored despite his violent record as commander of a underground group that existed before Israel ' s statehood . &quot; Those that are objecting because of Arafat should remember that Menachem Begin got the peace prize too , &quot; he said . Joel Rembaum , president of the Southern California Board of Rabbis , observed of the new laureates : &quot; You ' ve got_to give these guys credit , because they started a process that up_to now was not as meaningful as it might have been . &quot; Perhaps the hope is the prize will give an impetus to completing that process. &quot;</TEXT>
