   <HEADLINE> NOT ORPHANAGES OR PRISONS , BUT RESPONSIBLE FATHERS ; POVERTY : LET ' S ATTACK THE PROBLEM RATHER THAN WAREHOUSE ITS CONSEQUENCES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The proposal to build more orphanages is similar to our current strategy of building more prisons . Both ideas assume that more brick-and-mortar structures , staffed by public or quasi-public employees , can fill the vacuum in our society created by the growing collapse of parental capacity and the disintegration of the married-couple child-raising unit . Both , in short , are strategies for rescue and quarantine . Both are aimed largely at the growing ranks of fatherless children in our society . Liberals , in my view , have no right to profess outrage at the idea of orphanages , as if current living conditions for millions of our children constituted anything other_than unconscionable cruelty . Nor do conservatives have any business discussing this proposal as part of a triumphant , in-your-face political rhetoric , as if reopening orphanages in the United States at the close of this century constituted anything other_than an admission of failure . Moreover , before we decide simply to accept the trend of family fragmentation , while concerning ourselves only with warehousing some of its consequences , we would do_well to consider the recent experience of the Hennepin County , Minn. , Board of Commissioners . Earlier this year , the board drafted a &quot; vision statement &quot; to identify priorities for the future . The document called_for a community &quot; where healthy family structure is nurtured and fewer children are born_out of wedlock. &quot; This goal produced what the Minneapolis Star Tribune termed &quot; a big ruckus. &quot; A reporter from the newspaper summed_up what many local leaders were saying about the commissioners and their idea : &quot; Exclusionary . Judgmental . Intolerant . Offensive . Stigmatizing . Degrading . Archaic. &quot; An assistant parks_commissioner was outraged : &quot; Why is this statement here ? Why are you pointing fingers ? &quot; The county ' s community health director argued that &quot; we have a lot of single parents who work here . A lot of them feel it was shaming to them as single parents. &quot; A lesbian leader chastised the commissioners for &quot; discounting &quot; gay and lesbian parents . A pastor said that the real issue was jobs , not marriage . A United Way leader said that the real issue was how to &quot; nurture &quot; children , not &quot; how people choose to configure themselves. &quot; A state fiscal analyst told the commissioners that &quot; there are a lot of good single-parent families and there are a lot of bad two-parent families , and you ' re not going_to change that. &quot; In the midst of this firestorm , the commissioners , or at least some of them , insisted that the county ' s escalating rate of unwed childbearing -- about 27 % in 1992 -- was causing or aggravating problems from child poverty to infant_mortality , thus lowering the quality_of_life for everyone in the county . Their message was simple : We need to change our minds on this issue . Moreover , the commissioners hoped that the new goal would help them refocus policy priorities . The traditional goal had been to ameliorate consequences of trend . Now there was an additional goal : to reverse the trend . Two points : First , if you want to say something controversial , say that every child deserves a father and that unwed childbearing is wrong . Second , the Hennepin County vision statement ignited and gave shape to a serious local debate about the possibility of recovering the fatherhood idea . That possibility concerns not just the politics of Hennepin County , but the future of the nation . It is time for all_of us to consider this . Perhaps we can even agree that , as a national strategy for reversing the decline of child well-being , the fatherhood idea is far more consistent with the better angels of our nature than either the prison idea or the orphanage idea .</TEXT>
