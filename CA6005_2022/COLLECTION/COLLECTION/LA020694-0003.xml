   <HEADLINE> MARCHERS PLEAD FOR PEACE IN VIOLENT NEIGHBORHOOD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Armed with green ribbons of neutrality , nearly 50 activists marched through one of Los Angeles ' most violent neighborhoods on Saturday , but few hard-core gang members were_on hand to heed their pleas for peace . To shouts of &quot; Black Power &quot; and &quot; Viva La Raza , &quot; the marchers wound their way through the streets of Venice ' s Oakwood district , where a fierce rivalry between black and Latino gangs has left 11 people dead and more_than 30 wounded in the last four months . The multiracial group -- which ranged from members of the Brown Berets to the Coalition Against Police Abuse to a Mayan spiritualist waving an incense burner -- called_on the gangs to end their warfare and help rebuild a community that has been held virtually captive by reckless gunfire . &quot; We ' re trying to let these guys know that the community supports the need for a truce , &quot; said Michael Zinzun , a longtime political activist . &quot; that ' s why we ' re putting ourselves on the line right now. &quot; But like Zinzun , many in the crowd were from outside the Venice area and appeared to be pushing social agendas that reached far beyond the question of a gang truce . That fact was not lost on Lupe Gonzalez , who watched from her front_yard as the marchers chanted the names of their heroes -- Cesar Chavez , Malcolm X -- and ridiculed those they hold_in low esteem -- the police and CIA . &quot; The kids who should be out here are not out here , &quot; said Gonzalez , 48 , whose home was sprayed with gunfire at Christmastime when an assailant spotted two former gang members helping paint the small stucco bungalow . &quot; We don ' t need anyone to come_into our community and tell us what our problem is. &quot; Saturday ' s rally comes_after months of violent clashes between a black gang in Oakwood and two Latino gangs , one in Venice and the other several miles to the east in the Mar Vista Gardens housing project . Historically , police say , most of the bloodshed in those neighborhoods stemmed from conflicts between the two Latino gangs . But after they forged a truce in 1992 , they began to war with the black gang , which had coexisted peacefully with them on the same turf . Investigators have linked the interracial rivalry to a battle being waged by prison gangs over control of the drug trade . To help fight the violence , the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office Friday announced a program designed to crack_down on hard-core members of the three gangs . Under the plan , Los Angeles police_officers will notify prosecutors whenever a gang member from those neighborhoods is arrested . Prosecutors will advise judges , who will be asked to immediately sentence the suspects for probation violations , regardless of the crime for which they were arrested .</TEXT>
