   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : SPECIALISTS CHECKING INTO VALLEY_FEVER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four specialists from the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control in Atlanta are in Ventura County to examine the high number of cases of valley_fever , health officials said Tuesday . The team has confirmed at least 150 cases of the disease just in the month of February , said Dr. Rana Hajjeh , a medical epidemiologist working_on the CDC team.Over the last few years , Ventura County has averaged 50 cases a year , said Hajjeh , who attributed the outbreak to the dust stirred_up by the Jan . 17 earthquake . &quot; This is the first time that a valley_fever outbreak has been associated with an earthquake , &quot; she said . The virus is spread by spores from a fungus that lives in the soils of Southern California . Symptoms of the virus are much like a serious flu , Hajjeh said , and include chest_pains , fever and aching muscles . It is rarely fatal , and in only 1 % of the cases does the disease spread to other areas of the body , she said . The outbreak in Ventura County has garnered attention mostly because it is associated with the earthquake , Hajjeh said . Other areas have been hit much harder by the disease in recent years . Kern County has consistently had more_than 1 # 000 cases a year , she said . The team , which arrived about two weeks ago , will stay in Ventura County for several more weeks looking_for further confirmation that the outbreak was caused by the earthquake , Hajjeh said .
