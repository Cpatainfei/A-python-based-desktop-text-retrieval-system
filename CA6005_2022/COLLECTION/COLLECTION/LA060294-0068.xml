   <HEADLINE> FRENCH OPEN / MEN ; THE REIGN IN SPAIN IS MAINLY ON THE CLAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alberto Berasategui is the latest clay court specialist from Spain ' s deep reserve to arrive in Paris with a wicked topspin and a resolve to win . Following countryman Sergi Bruguera , Berasategui advanced to the semifinals of the_French Open Wednesday with an efficient 6-4 , 6-3 , 6-3 victory over fifth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic . Like Bruguera , Berasategui has yet to lose a set_in reaching his first Grand_Slam tournament semifinal round . Berasategui has played only 12 sets_in six matches , having won twice when opponents retired because of pulled stomach muscles . He will play Magnus Larsson of Sweden , who saved six match_points in the third set , then blew past German teen-ager Henrik Dreekmann , 3-6 , 6-7 ( 7-1 ) , 7-6 ( 7-3 ) , 6-0 , 6-1 , in Wednesday ' s other quarterfinal match . But most of the attention was_on Berasategui ' s upset of the last remaining seeded player in the men ' s lower bracket . The hard-serving Ivanisevic had a great opportunity to reach the final at Roland Garros Stadium , yet seemed to give it away . Last year , Ivanisevic routed Berasategui , 6-3 , 6-3 , 6-2 , in the second round of the_French Open in their only other meeting . Berasategui , whose second-round appearance last year was his best previous Grand_Slam performance , has an unusual grip that has all_the tennis technicians talking . He uses a severe backhand grip to hit forehands , a shot that often confounds opponents . To make the shot , Berasategui twists his arm awkwardly , with his palm on the underside of the grip , and hits the ball with the same face of the racket as with his backhand . &quot; If I played like that , the ball would be in my shoes , &quot; said Imanol Bollegui , Berasategui ' s childhood coach . Berasategui started using the grip when he was a 9-year-old playing in Arrigorriaga , a village in the northwestern Basque region of Spain . He has stuck_with it because it seems to work . In the end , it was Ivanisevic who could not get a grip . &quot; He didn ' t have to do anything -- nothing , &quot; Ivanisevic said . &quot; It was a disgusting game . I never played like that in my life. &quot; Ivanisevic has advanced past the quarterfinals in only two Grand_Slam events , but was playing his seventh quarterfinal match . Despite his experience , he was as flat as a crepe on a boiling day in Paris . The left-handed Croatian was impatient , playing into Berasategui ' s game . Ivanisevic ' s big serve deserted him with his shot selection . Even when he had an open court at the net , Ivanisevic could not convert . He had 69 unforced errors . &quot; He was a little bit nervous , but I gave him everything , &quot; Ivanisevic said . &quot; I gave him a nice present. &quot; Berasategui gladly accepted the gift as he stayed_on the baseline , content to watch his opponent make mistake after mistake . &quot; I thought it was going_to be much harder for me , &quot; the Spaniard said . &quot; I thought the key was my ( service ) return. &quot; All it took_for Berasategui to gain the advantage was a break_in the seventh game of the first set . Ivanisevic hit a forehand into the net , then sent a ball long . From that juncture , Berasategui never wavered . And the more Ivanisevic failed to volley with confidence , the more he got_into trouble . Berasategui even ended it on a second-serve ace , something Ivanisevic might have done had he played his game . Dreekmann , 19 , looked as if his incredible run at Roland Garros would continue when he dominated the first two sets . Then it quickly ended . Larsson ' s comeback was unremarkable , considering Dreekmann ' s total collapse , and midway through the fourth set it was evident the German was going_down . After fending off the match_points with clutch serving , Larsson won 11 consecutive games , including the third-set tiebreaker . He lost only six points in the fourth set and ended with 19 aces . &quot; I didn ' t know what to do after the third set , &quot; Dreekmann said . &quot; I was only thinking_of the six match_points I had , and then the fourth set was gone. &quot; So was Dreekmann . Tennis Notes Martina Navratilova and Mark Woodforde of Australia lost to Natalia Medvedeva of Ukraine and Paul Haarhuis of the_Netherlands , 6-7 ( 7-2 ) , 6-4 , 7-5 , in the third round of mixed doubles , ousting Navratilova completely from her final French Open . . . . After losing in the third round of women ' s singles , Lindsay Davenport said she could hardly wait to return to her friends at Murrieta Valley High . But wait she will , because she and Lisa Raymond of Wayne , Pa. , advanced to the women ' s doubles semifinals with a 6-1 , 6-0 victory over Nicole Provis of Australia and Elna Reinach of South_Africa .</TEXT>
