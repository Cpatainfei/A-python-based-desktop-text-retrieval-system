   <HEADLINE> METRIC SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Our students deserve our elected officials ' support of the metric_system . U.S. students and eventually everyone will be better_off as a result of the switch . Education in this country seems to be continually under_fire for a variety of reasons.One such reason is the degree of technical literacy achieved by most of our students compared with students of other countries . Currently U.S. students spend time learning &quot; scientific &quot; units , such_as the meter , liter , kilogram and degrees Celsius . ( If it is of any comfort , U.S. students are not entirely alone with this burden . However , the only other students having to learn these units as an additional and separate hurdle are from Burma , South Yemen and Tonga . Everyone else is_on the metric system. ) U.S. federal agencies ( as of Nov . 30 , 1992 ) are using the metric_system . The metric_system is easy to use because it is based on multiples of 10 . For example , our distance units include miles , yards , feet , inches and various fractions of inches , but the metric_system uses the meter and its multiples , e.g. , the kilometer , centimeter and millimeter . If you care about American students scientific literacy , then please support the switch by asking your officials to support it . STEPHEN V . HYMOWITZ Los Angeles</TEXT>
