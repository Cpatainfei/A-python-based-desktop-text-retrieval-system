   <HEADLINE> BAN ON_FIRING STRIKERS BLOCKED ; LABOR : SENATE REPUBLICANS SUCCEED IN A FILIBUSTER ON THE MEASURE . UNIONS HAD SOUGHT TO KEEP FIRMS FROM PERMANENTLY REPLACING THEIR MEMBERS DURING WALKOUTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton and organized labor suffered a stinging defeat Tuesday when the Senate effectively rejected legislation that would have prevented American corporations from firing striking union_members and permanently replacing them with non-union workers . In one of the fiercest political battles between management and labor in a generation , union supporters in the Senate mustered a 53-47 majority but fell seven votes short of the 60 needed to break a Republican filibuster of the striker replacement measure . The Senate ' s Democratic leadership scheduled another vote for today to stop the filibuster , but both sides said they expect the result to be the same . Although union officials were reluctant to comment extensively until after today ' s expected final vote , they did express disappointment and frustration . &quot; We really feel it ' s a travesty , &quot; AFL-CIO spokeswoman Sharolyn Rosier said . Business lobbyists who worked fiercely to kill the bill were ecstatic . &quot; This is a major blow to organized labor , &quot; said a triumphant Richard L . Lesher , president of the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce . Passage of the legislation &quot; would have destroyed the balance_of_power that has existed for more_than 50 years between labor and management , &quot; Lesher said . &quot; We hope that this is the death_knell for organized labor ' s confrontational approach on labor-management issues , &quot; said Dan Yager , a lobbyist with the Labor Policy Assn. , a business trade group . For the labor_movement , the defeat was especially bitter because it comes at a time when corporate America is showing an increased willingness to fire striking workers rather than bargain with them to hammer_out new contracts . Labor_unions and their allies in Congress said the use of permanent replacements for striking workers sharply increased in the 1980s , after President Ronald Reagan fired union air traffic controllers in 1981 , thus signaling to the business_community that the federal_government approved of the practice . Federal law never prohibited the use of replacement workers but , union leaders said , until Reagan ' s action there was a strong cultural stigma that made business_executives reluctant to fire striking employees . As a result , they had insisted that the federal ban was needed so labor could use the threat of a strike as an effective lever at the bargaining table . * While the Senate was voting Tuesday , Caterpillar Tractor was hiring workers to keep its assembly_lines rolling in the face of its second bitter strike in two years . During Caterpillar ' s last strike in the midst of the 1992 presidential campaign , candidate Bill_Clinton made a high-profile visit to striking workers in Illinois and vowed to push for the striker replacement ban if elected . That 1992 strike eventually ended in a union defeat when workers agreed to return to their jobs after the company threatened to find permanent replacements . Clinton ' s campaign promise to sign a striker replacement ban helped energize union support for his candidacy , especially in the general_election campaign against President George_Bush , who had vowed to veto the ban if it reached his desk . The last congressional battle over the issue also died in the Senate while Bush was in the White_House in 1992 . Yet despite his campaign pledge , President Clinton did not mount an aggressive , public campaign in support of the legislation , as he has done on other high-profile initiatives like last year ' s North_American Free_Trade Agreement , prompting quiet frustration among some union officials . For years the striker replacement legislation has been the No . 1 legislative priority of organized labor , which has suffered a long string of political setbacks during the last decade as it has seen its economic power and membership erode . Union leaders said Tuesday that they were satisfied with the Administration ' s effort in support of the striker replacement ban and acknowledged that the ideological battle between business and labor over the issue was so heated that a White_House lobbying campaign would have done little to budge swing votes . &quot; We felt the White_House was trying , &quot; said Rex Hardesty , chief spokesman for the AFL-CIO . &quot; We are satisfied that the White_House did what we could reasonably expect . We also know that they were not successful. &quot; Clinton did , however , make last-minute appeals_to key Democratic senators by telephone from Europe this week , and he assigned senior adviser George Stephanopoulos to head the White_House lobbying campaign on the legislation . Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich also played a leading role in pushing for the bill and made repeated calls_on critical lawmakers in the closing days . But Tuesday ' s defeat still damaged Clinton ' s attempts to improve his ties to organized labor , which were badly frayed by the battle over the North_American Free_Trade Agreement last fall . That trade fight pitted unions against the White_House , which was then allied_with the same business interest_groups that opposed the Administration on the striker replacement bill . Ultimately , the White_House was unable to win_over key Southern Democrats to the striker replacement bill , most notably the two from Clinton ' s home state of Arkansas , Sens . David Pryor and Dale Bumpers , who were under heavy pressure from business lobby groups . Labor lobbyists , who focused their efforts on Republicans while the White_House handled Democrats , also failed to lure many moderate Northern Republicans into breaking ranks with their party leadership . By Tuesday morning , supporters of the striker replacement ban -- which already had passed the House -- knew that they would fall_short , but the margin of defeat was larger than the three to five votes they were predicting . Both of California ' s Democratic senators -- Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer -- voted to end the filibuster . * Republicans Alfonse M . D ' Amato of New York , Mark O . Hatfield of Oregon and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania joined 50 Democrats in supporting cloture . Democrats David L . Boren of Oklahoma , Ernest F . Hollings of South Carolina , Harlan Mathews of Tennessee and Sam Nunn of Georgia joined Pryor and Bumpers in voting with the Republicans against cloture . &quot; This issue has become such a lightning_rod for both sides that it was a very tough , uphill battle all_the way , &quot; an Administration lobbyist said . Sen . Howard M . Metzenbaum ( D-Ohio ) , who sponsored the legislation , argued that the current law &quot; sends the unmistakable message that workers are disposable , reducing employee morale and lowering productivity. &quot; Sen . Tom Harkin ( D-Iowa ) said that &quot; any right to strike today is . . . a hollow right. &quot; Business_leaders and their supporters , by contrast , insisted that the use of permanent replacements is still quite rare but warned that a federal ban on the practice would give unions a new weapon and make labor_leaders much more willing to strike to win contract demands . &quot; The bottom_line is that our system of collective_bargaining has worked well for over half a century and continues to work well today , &quot; said Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , a leader of the bill ' s opposition . &quot; But by eliminating the risk factor from strikes , this bill presents employers with an untenable Hobson ' s choice : Shut down the business -- close_down the factory -- or accede_to the union ' s demands , whether those demands are reasonable or not. &quot;</TEXT>
