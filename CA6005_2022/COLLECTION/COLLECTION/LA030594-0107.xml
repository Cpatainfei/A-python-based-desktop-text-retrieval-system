   <HEADLINE> MAINTENANCE ; ELBOW_GREASE AND POLISH MAKE METALS SHINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You can choose from a variety of commercial metal polishes , or even make your own , to bring_back the sparkle in copper , brass , pewter or silver . Most commercial polishes contain tarnish retardants , so they help maintain a shine as well as remove tarnish . To avoid damaging the finish , you ' ll want to choose a polish designed especially for the metal that needs cleaning . After cleaning , be sure to buff or wash_away all polish because any traces will hasten tarnishing . Here are some specific cleaning and polishing tips : Brass and Copper * Don ' t use polish of any type on lacquered objects . Wash them in lukewarm sudsy water ; rinse ; dry , and buff with a soft cloth . * For unlacquered bright finishes , wash in hot sudsy water and rinse . Apply brass or copper polish with a soft cloth or brush . Let the polish dry thoroughly , then buff with a soft clean cloth . * For dull finishes , mix rottenstone and linseed_oil ( available from hardware_stores ) to form a heavy_cream . Apply with a soft cloth and rub vigorously . Wipe_off the excess , then polish with a soft clean cloth . * If you prefer to make your own polish , you can clean slightly tarnished copper or brass by mixing equal parts of salt , vinegar and flour . Rub the paste on with a soft cloth . Because salt is corrosive , be sure to rinse the piece thoroughly before buffing it . * Rub stubborn stains with salt and vinegar or lemon_juice . Or rub them with a piece of lemon dipped in hot vinegar and salt . Wash , rinse and dry . If this fails , use a commercial polish . Pewter Modern pewter ( also called Brittania metal ) is an alloy of tin , antimony and copper . It resists tarnish quite well and usually needs only an occasional washing in warm , soapy water . Rinse well and dry thoroughly . Dust and burnish old pewter with a soft cloth . If the tin and lead in it cause a brown tarnish , remove it with a bath in washing soda . If necessary , rub the surface with extra-fine ( grade 000 ) steel_wool dipped in vegetable_oil . Because of the lead content , don ' t eat or drink from old pewter utensils . You can polish modern and old pewter with commercial pewter cleaners or make your own modern pewter restorer with ingredients from the hardware_store . For a duller matte , mix rottenstone and vegetable_oil . For brighter matte finishes , apply a paste of pumice and water . Apply either paste with a soft cloth and rub gently . For shiny pewter , use automobile polish and follow label directions . Or mix a paste of powdered whiting and denatured alcohol . When the paste is dry , polish with a clean , soft cloth . Silverware Fine silver should be used frequently , not packed away for special occasions . Continual use enhances its beauty . * As soon as silver flatware has been cleared from the table , wash it in hot sudsy water , then rinse it in clear hot water . * To prevent water-spotting , don ' t allow silverware to air-dry . Dry with a lint-free towel . * Antique or oxidized silverware may_not be dishwasher-safe . Hot water can loosen hollow handles on antique ( or even modern ) flatware and may dissolve a decorative oxidized pattern . * Dip polishes will also remove an oxidized pattern . Use a commercial cream or paste polish instead . * The outer layer of a silver-plated item is soft and thin . Avoid harsh rubbing and frequent polishing . Use a dip polish instead . * To clean tarnish from the edges of fork tines , rub them with a string coated with silver polish .</TEXT>
