   <HEADLINE> SHARING THE SLOPES ; RECREATION : SKIERS HAVE HAD TO LEARN TO MAKE MORE ROOM FOR THEIR MORE RADICAL COUNTERPARTS , SNOWBOARDERS . THE LATTER SPORT HAS A GROWING FOLLOWING IN O.C.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Skiers say they see them coming from a distance , an ominous blur against the white . Charging recklessly across the powder , done_up in snappy mountain threads more street than snow . The outlaws of the slopes , the snowboarders , are here . &quot; Most of them are young and decent kids , I guess , &quot; sighs Larry Evers , 38 , who ' s been skiing for 15 years . &quot; But the thing is , they ' re radical , doing all their tricks and routines . They really mess_up the quality ( of the ski_runs ) by acting so aggressive . . . . They make you nervous. &quot; Oh , c ' mon , loosen your bindings , replies Dan Brown , a former skier turned snowboarder . &quot; Most of us don ' t screw things up any more_than the skiers , &quot; says the 25-year-old Laguna Niguel resident , an avid snowboarder since hanging_up his skis four years ago . &quot; They just like to pick on us . I think they ' re bitter ; they feel left behind because snowboarding is taking over. &quot; That may be a stretch , but just about everybody from resort managers to snowboarding groups agree that the sport has grown quickly in recent years . The Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn . in Corona del Mar estimates that nationally 2.2 million snowboarders are expected to visit the mountains this season , up from 1.9 million last year . Board sales , the association notes , should jump more_than 30 # 000 above the 130 # 000 mark of 1992-93 . Brown and others say Orange County , like most of the Southland , has a loyal and rising number of followers . This demands a peaceful coexistence between skiers and snowboarders , a fact the resorts recognize . While some don ' t allow snowboarding , most do and have tried to minimize tensions by creating special snowboard runs featuring &quot; half pipes , &quot; or banks of snow used for tricks , much like skateboard ramps . They also have staffers patrol the slopes , warning visitors about unruly behavior . &quot; All that helps and I ' m trying to be hopeful , &quot; says Evers , from Huntington Beach . &quot; It ' s a real drag , though , when they come screaming down the slopes , tearing everything up when you ' re trying to have a relaxing day. &quot; Adds Paul Herman , a 29-year-old Long_Beach skier : &quot; What I hate is when they cut you off or act like they own the place . They hoot and holler and say things to you , especially if you ' re in the way . No respect. &quot; It all comes_down to philosophies , concedes Brown . Pointing_out that snowboarders tend to be younger ( the core age_group is 13 to 25 years old ) , Brown says that most skiers go_for fast descents , performed gracefully if boringly , while snowboarders prefer acting_up with almost acrobatic maneuverings on the mountain face . Even their clothes are provocative ; snowboarders have taken the radical urban styles , bright colors and baggy sizes onto the slopes , often annoying the sensibilities of more restrained skiers . &quot; Skiers are into speed , we ' re into style , &quot; Brown says . &quot; Sometimes those ( attitudes ) don ' t get_along . The ( two sports ) are just very different. &quot; Instead of two long skis , snowboarding is done on a sleek fiberglass plank ( which can cost as much as $ 500 new ; used ones come as cheap as $ 100 ) somewhere between the size of a skateboard and a surfboard . The rider stands sideways , with his or her feet hooked into a pair of latches . From this position , the snowboarder can slash and cut_through the powder , leaping from moguls to perform &quot; aerials , &quot; or air-born tricks . The moves are similar to those done_by surfers and skateboarders . No surprise there ; snowboarding actually developed in the early ' 80s in response to both those pastimes . Surfers and skateboarders , already dominating the sea and the asphalt , naturally turned_to the snow . Back then , though , snowboarders were such a minority that most skiers hardly noticed them , and usually only as a curiosity . But not now . Skiers may_not like it , but snowboarding has become an important sport . There are even contests , many of them televised on channels like ESPN . Mt . Baldy , for instance , plans to hold no fewer than four snowboard competitions in the next two months . Some skiers , especially younger ones , have met the lure of snowboarding by crossing over . Mindy Clark , the marketing director for Snow Summit in Big Bear , notes that it rarely works the other way . &quot; Skiers ( become snowboarders ) but not vice versa , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s easier for snowboarders to get good once they learn , unlike skiing which is easier to learn but harder to get good at. &quot; Damon Saunders , 19 , from Westminster , agrees . He says he found skiing somewhat difficult to pick_up , even though he ' s been surfing and skateboarding since he was 12 . But snowboarding felt very natural , almost from the start . Now , he ' s hooked . &quot; A common day when I ' m not in school may start_out with surfing in the morning , then a drive_up to the mountains , &quot; Saunders says . &quot; we ' ll do some styling in the snow in the afternoon , then come_home , watch TV , then go_out and skateboard ' til dark . that ' s a great day ! &quot; An added attraction , Saunders felt obliged to note , are the girls and women who have taken_up the sport in recent years . &quot; There are some hot ones , and young , too . Not like ( the older_women ) skiing , &quot; he says . In fact , snowboarding is experiencing a surge in feminine participation , says Fran Richards of Transworld Snowboarding magazine . This year , she predicts that 30 % of the snowboarders will be women , compared to the 10 % who surf and skateboard . &quot; Women have a greater ability to be more competitive in snowboarding than surfing , &quot; she explains . that ' s what appealed_to Sara Sheen , a 20-year-old from Costa Mesa . Always looking_for a new recreation , Sheen , who also teaches aerobics , tried surfing and skateboarding but wasn ' t impressed . Snowboarding , however , eventually felt right , even though her first outings were difficult . &quot; I ' d recommend trying it twice , not once , &quot; she says . &quot; You fall_down all_the time in the beginning , it ' s not fun . But then you catch_on somehow and there ' s not as much pain . You stop landing on your butt all_the time . &quot; What I like about it now are all_the tricks and maneuvers . To me , it ' s like dancing. &quot; As for the tension between skiers and snowboarders , Sheen has seen her share . Like Brown and Saunders , she ' s been yelled at and joked about while in lift lines . Sheen has also seen fights , as has Brown . &quot; I guess we both bother each other , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s too_bad , but I don ' t thing we like each other. &quot; Evers won ' t go that far , believing that a little respect on both sides can mean a lot . &quot; They ( snowboarders ) aren ' t going_to go_away , skiers have to understand that . But ( snowboarders should ) realize that we were there first and we ' re not going_away either. &quot; Where to Get_on ' Board Here is a sampling of ski resorts , and whether they allow snowboarding , according to Sportours .
