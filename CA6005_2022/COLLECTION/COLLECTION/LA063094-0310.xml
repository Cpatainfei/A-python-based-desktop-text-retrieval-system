   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : BEHIND POLITICAL SMOKE , TOBACCO BIOENGINEERING SHINES AS MODEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As biotech breakthroughs go , Brown &amp; Williamson ' s controversial efforts to genetically engineer a line of high-nicotine tobacco qualified perhaps as something out of &quot; The Gang That Couldn ' t Splice Straight. &quot; So what ' s next ? Pork genetically packed with extra lipids ? Oranges engineered to be free_of Vitamin_C ? But blow away some of the smoke and what you ' ll find is an unusual case study in successful technology transfer , and a superb example of the role of serendipity in promoting biotech innovation . Now , it ' s probably not wise_to rely_on tobacco companies for medical advice or congressional testimony , but when it comes_to exploring the market potential of biotechnology , the people who make cigarettes are not slow on the draw . By sheer happenstance , it turns_out that tobacco companies have the inside_track when it comes_to exploiting innovations in plant genetics and biotechnology . Why ? Because tobacco is the scientific standard . For decades , tobacco has been the experimental plant of choice for researchers in the biotech community . Everyone who ' s anyone in plant genetics has done nicotiana tobacum . &quot; It ' s like a mouse , &quot; says University of Illinois plant pathologist Paul D . Shaw . &quot; Almost everybody uses it one way or another . A lot is known about the genetics ; it ' s easy to construct hybrids and crosses and it ' s a very easy plant to grow . The tobacco_industry , whenever it has a serious disease problem -- on its plants , I mean -- can easily transform the plant and breed other varieties for disease resistance . It ' s just a great plant to manipulate. &quot; &quot; Tobacco happens to be an excellent plant to work_on from a plant-biochemistry and -physiology point_of_view , &quot; agrees Howard Brooks , the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture ' s associate deputy administrator for plant sciences . &quot; It ' s extremely useful as a model plant system. &quot; In fact , tobacco-based research has won the Nobel Prize : Nearly 60 years ago , Rockefeller Institute scientist Wendell Stanley ' s work crystallizing the tobacco_mosaic_virus offered powerful insight into the structural nature of viruses . In other words , scientists probably knew more about tobacco than any other plant in existence . That was the rich research context that would lure the tobacco companies into multimillion-dollar partnerships with so many of the budding young plant biotech entrepreneurs of the 1980s ; it seemed a natural match . &quot; In the early 1980s , we had already been using tobacco as a model system for experiments , &quot; recalls DNA Plant Technology ' s David Evans , the company ' s vice_president for business development . &quot; Our interest was more in tissue culture -- how to get whole plants from just a_few cells -- and what we did_worked better on tobacco than anything else . &quot; But we weren ' t using tobacco strains that were commercially viable . So several companies and us , we scratched our heads and said maybe we can make money off of this . I didn ' t have a clue . There was just the idea that there might be a marriage there . So companies like Crop Genetics and Calgene and us all had deals with tobacco companies in the early 1980s. &quot; So Crop Genetics and Calgene hooked_up_with Philip Morris ; Plant Genetic Systems went_with Japan Tobacco . DNA Plant Technology became partner to the Louisville , Ky.-based , British American Tobacco-owned Brown &amp; Williamson . &quot; They were among the best people we worked with , &quot; says Evans , who recalls that his company &quot; floundered for a_couple_of years &quot; trying to figure_out which collaboration would make the most sense . Brown &amp; Williamson declines to comment . But soon after , the tobacco giant came_to DNA Plant Technology with a high-nicotine plant developed in concert with scientists at North Carolina State -- an excellent example of industry-academe collaboration and technology transfer -- and the company was able to use its tissue culture biotechnology to breed a &quot; better &quot; plant . That plant , grown overseas , yielded the potent leaves that were dried and cured into Y-1 , the high-nicotine &quot; blending &quot; agent that Food and Drug Administration chief Dr. David Kessler condemned as an example of improper manipulation of cigarette nicotine levels . &quot; My view was that we had a technical success , but the company ( Brown &amp; Williamson ) wasn ' t able to commercially exploit it , &quot; Evans says . &quot; A technology success , yes ; a commercial success , no. &quot; Of course , there are other routes through which cigarette companies can exploit biotechnology for nicotine profit . Much as the National Institutes of Health is trying to sequence key portions of the human genome , Philip Morris is reportedly trying to map and sequence the vital parts of the tobacco genome : just which genetic instructions express themselves in the plant ' s tar and nicotine levels . Like other biotech firms , Philip Morris is trying to patent those sequences . It ' s far too early to say whether these approaches will be any more successful than Y-1 . Ironically , however , precisely at the moment when molecular_biology and agricultural bioengineering assume even greater prominence , tobacco is dying_out as the experimental plant of choice . Plant molecular biologists are flocking to arabodapsis -- a relative of cabbage and canola -- because it grows and reproduces faster and has a smaller and easier genetic instruction set than tobacco . &quot; I don ' t think it will be used as much as an experimental model anymore , &quot; says Agriculture ' s Brooks . &quot; In research , tobacco ' s best days are behind it. &quot; But wait ! DNA Plant Technology ' s Evans insists that tobacco still has great potential . &quot; Since tobacco grows so fast and is so easy to grow and manipulate , it will be used to grow alternative materials , &quot; he says . &quot; In five years , tobacco could be used as a medium to grow food flavoring and fragrance compounds. &quot; Indeed , Evans even predicts that tobacco might become a cash crop for &quot; pharming &quot; -- plants genetically engineered to contain life-saving pharmaceuticals than can be processed after harvest . &quot; I think that would attract an awful lot of research , &quot; he says . Indeed , perhaps we ' ll even see a methanol-like subsidy that pays tobacco farmers to grow alternative materials just as grain farmers get one to grow crops for methanol production . Is this the future of tobacco biotechnology ? Or is the industry just blowing smoke ? Don ' t hold your breath . . . . Sorry .</TEXT>
