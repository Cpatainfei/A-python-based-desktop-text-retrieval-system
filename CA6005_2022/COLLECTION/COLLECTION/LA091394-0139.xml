   <HEADLINE> KKR WILL BUY BORDEN IN $ 2-BILLION DEAL ; MERGERS : IT IS THE BIGGEST ACQUISITION BY KOHLBERG KRAVIS ROBERTS &amp; CO . SINCE IT TOOK OVER RJR NABISCO IN 1989 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cash-starved dairy and pasta company Borden Inc. agreed to be acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co . in a $ 2-billion deal that marks the biggest purchase by the leveraged-buyout firm since its takeover of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp . in 1989 . KKR , based in New York , will pay_for the acquisition with RJR Nabisco stock . For Columbus , Ohio-based Borden , which has been struggling with money-losing dairy operations and heavy debt , the price of $ 14.25 a share may be the best it could get , analysts said . As recently as December , the stock was trading above $ 18 a share . In 1991 , it reached a high of $ 38.75. By paying with RJR Nabisco stock , KKR will pare its once-controlling stake in the tobacco and consumer products firm to $ 2 billion , or less than a quarter of the voting shares . The RJR Nabisco acquisition--America ' s biggest corporate takeover--capped the frenzied deal making of the 1980s and crowned KKR as the king of the leveraged_buyout . But RJR Nabisco has not performed well for KKR and its investors , so the Borden deal may provide an escape route from the tobacco_industry . The industry has come under increasing pressure from internal price_wars , municipal smoking bans and Congress , which sees cigarettes as a source of tax_revenue to help finance federal health reform . Under KKR ' s complicated buyout proposal , Borden would become a private company headed by its current senior managers , including Chief_Executive Ervin Shames , 54 , a former executive of Kraft General Foods who came aboard last year , and Chairman Frank J . Tasco , 66 . Borden stockholders would get RJR Nabisco stock . At the completion of the deal , KKR would retain 80 % of Borden , and RJR Nabisco would purchase the remaining 20 % , paying with $ 500 million in newly issued stock . RJR Nabisco would also receive a warrant to purchase an additional 10 % interest . &quot; It is clear that additional investment in our brands and in capital are needed in_order to capture the company ' s potential , &quot; Tasco said in a statement . Borden is perhaps best known for the Elsie the Cow logo that decorates its Eagle Brand condensed milk and other dairy_products . Among its other brands are Prince spaghetti , Pennsylvania_Dutch egg_noodles , Wise potato_chips , Cracker Jack , ReaLemon lemon_juice and Cremora coffee creamer . The profitable non-food division includes Elmer ' s glue , wallpaper and bonding materials for the construction_industry . Borden , which slashed its dividend by 75 % last year and had been selling operations at cut_rates to raise money , did not have enough free cash to market its products , said analyst Allan S . Roness of Fahnestock &amp; Co . &quot; I don ' t think they could have continued this way without sinking into a financial black_hole , &quot; Roness said . Borden tried to put itself up for_sale last year but received no bids . The company ' s dairy operations have lost an estimated $ 30 million in the first_half of this year , said analyst Nomi Ghez of Goldman Sachs . Without the cash to finance marketing and advertising , Borden ' s brand recognition has been slipping , she said . Analysts said the link to RJR Nabisco and its managerial acumen may help Borden improve its operations . RJR Nabisco will have 20 % representation on Borden ' s board and may purchase some Borden businesses later , RJR Nabisco said in a statement . &quot; With greater access to capital and an incentive compensation program that encourages managers to think like owners , Borden will be_well positioned to develop the full value of its many strong underlying assets and excellent brands , &quot; Henry Kravis and George Roberts , founding partners of KKR , said in a statement . Borden stock jumped $ 2 to $ 13.625 in trading on the New York Stock_Exchange . RJR Nabisco shares lost 37.5 cents , closing at $ 6.625. KKR ' s Holdings Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. , which Monday agreed to buy dairy goods and pasta maker Borden Inc. , was one of the kings of the 1980s leveraged-buyout boom , using small amounts of equity and large amounts of bank loans and junk_bonds to acquire stakes in some of America ' s best-known companies . KKR ' s buying binge has slowed in recent years .
