   <HEADLINE> ALTMAN DIARY TO FIGURE IN WHITEWATER HEARINGS ; PROBE : DEPUTY TREASURY_SECRETARY EMERGES AS FOCUS OF CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS BEGINNING NEXT WEEK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Deputy Treasury_Secretary Roger Altman kept a diary that contains embarrassing references_to First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton ' s anger over Whitewater disclosures and describes her as furious that her husband appointed a special counsel to investigate the tangled financial affair , congressional and other sources said Friday . Rep . Barney Frank , the Massachusetts Democrat serving as one of the Administration ' s point_men for the Whitewater hearings getting under way in Congress next week , disclosed the existence of the Altman diary to reporters . Frank did so as the President ' s congressional allies sought to lessen the expected impact of new Whitewater revelations by unveiling them before the hearings start . While there was apparently nothing in the diary ' s references_to Mrs . Clinton that suggested any wrongdoing , they did shed more light on the way the scrutiny had preoccupied the White_House . Until Friday , the only Administration official known to have kept a Whitewater-related diary was Joshua Steiner , chief_of_staff to Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen . Steiner ' s private journal reportedly contains references_to some of the controversial contacts between White_House aides and department officials overseeing the Resolution Trust Corp . investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan , a failed Little_Rock , Ark. , thrift that was owned by the Clintons ' partner in the Whitewater land venture . But Frank revealed at a breakfast meeting with reporters that Altman also kept a private journal and that it contained possibly embarrassing references_to Mrs . Clinton ' s &quot; personal state_of_mind , &quot; describing her as being &quot; upset &quot; and &quot; distracted &quot; by the activities of special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr. , who took_charge of the Whitewater investigation in January . &quot; Mrs . Clinton wasn ' t thrilled with the idea of ( the special counsel ) investigating everything she had ever done , &quot; Frank said . White_House officials stressed that Mrs . Clinton was not upset with Fiske personally , but with the idea that her family ' s personal finances should be subject_to scrutiny by a special prosecutor . A senior Administration official reacted with surprise when told that Frank had disclosed the existence of the diary , but he also confirmed that the lawmaker ' s description of it was generally correct . However , other sources said that the White_House has provided congressional investigators only a heavily censored version of Altman ' s diary that did not contain any references_to Mrs . Clinton personally . Asked about reports that the diary had been censored , Frank said later that he had not read it but had been provided with &quot; the three or four juiciest excerpts &quot; and was basing his evaluation of its contents on them . Those excerpts , he said , are not to be made public in next week ' s hearings . Saying that the White_House had been stunned by Frank ' s remarks , another senior Administration source said he thought that the lawmaker may have &quot; received information about the contents of the diary that goes beyond &quot; what the office of White_House Counsel Lloyd N . Cutler has provided to congressional investigators in censored form . That suggests , one White_House source added , that Frank had seen uncensored excerpts of the journal , which other sources described as not so_much a formal diary as a collection of notes and impressions about other Administration officials . Altman did not respond to requests for comment but the senior economic adviser , who at one time was considered to be the most influential man at the Treasury_Department , was clearly emerging as the main focus of the hearings opening Tuesday in the House Banking , Finance and Urban Affairs Committee and next Friday in the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee . The hearings are expected to last about a week each and , by prior agreement with Fiske , will focus only on the two narrow aspects of the Whitewater controversy that the special counsel has finished investigating . Those are the suicide of White_House deputy counsel Vincent Foster a year ago and the possibly improper contacts between White_House aides and Treasury_Department officials who were overseeing the RTC ' s investigation of allegations that the Whitewater Development Corp . may have been used to illegally siphon funds away from Madison Guaranty , which cost taxpayers an estimated $ 47 million when it went bankrupt in 1989 . Fiske said he found no evidence that anyone at the White_House or the Treasury_Department sought to impede the RTC ' s investigation illegally . Congressional sources said that Altman had turned_into &quot; the main target &quot; for Republican members of the banking committees . Altman became the focal_point after Treasury counsel Jean Hanson gave a deposition to the Senate committee last week that contradicted Altman ' s earlier testimony before Congress . Altman told the Senate committee that he did not learn until March of this year that Hanson had alerted the White_House some six months earlier about the RTC ' s plans . Hanson had told the White_House that the RTC intended to seek a Justice_Department investigation of Madison Guaranty and of the possibility that the Clintons , through their Whitewater connection with its owner , James B . McDougal , may have been beneficiaries of criminal activities related to its failure . But Hanson , in her deposition last week , said that she alerted the White_House about the RTC ' s plans after Altman told her to do so in the fall of 1993 . In a statement issued Friday , Altman acknowledged that he and Hanson have differing recollections of events . While Fiske has said that he found no evidence of any criminal conduct in either Altman ' s or Hanson ' s actions , a Democratic House source conceded that Altman has &quot; some heavy-duty explaining to do &quot; and will be in_for some tough questioning in Congress . &quot; I ' m convinced that he took no actions to impede the investigation , but he wasn ' t as open about his conversations with people as he should have been , &quot; Frank said . &quot; I don ' t know at this point whether he lied or withheld , but he did not seem to give a complete accounting of his conversations &quot; when he testified before the Senate Banking Committee . Frank added , however , that he thought these discrepancies would be the worst thing to come_out at the congressional hearings . He predicted the hearings would be anticlimactic .
