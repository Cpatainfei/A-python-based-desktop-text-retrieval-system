   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / JERRY CROWE ; WITHOUT VISIBLE WEAKNESSES , SAMPRAS IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pete Sampras , home_in Tampa preparing_for the clay-court season after earning more_than $ 1 million already this year , has made the most of his time at the top of the ATP Tour rankings . He has maintained his No . 1 ranking for all but three weeks since April 12 , 1993 . He has won the last three Grand_Slam events -- Wimbledon , the U.S. Open and the Australian Open -- and his 33-2 start this year is the best on the ATP Tour since 1989 , when Ivan Lendl won 36 of 38 matches before losing in the_French Open . Sampras increased his 1994 earnings to $ 1 # 125 , 038 when he won his sixth title of the year , defeating Michael Chang in the Japan Open final on April 10 . And he will take a 21-match winning_streak into next month ' s Italian Open . &quot; It appears that he ' s really head and shoulders above everyone else , &quot; said John McEnroe , who twice spent more_than a year at No . 1 . &quot; He ' s got the confidence factor , he ' s got people intimidated and he looks_to be fitter than I ' ve ever seen him . &quot; He ' s just in that flow right now , so unless someone is able to pick it up , or something happens to him on a physical level , it ' s pretty difficult to envision him losing the No . 1 ranking this year. &quot; McEnroe was dominant in 1984 , winning 82 of 85 matches , but success came so easily , he said , that he grew complacent . &quot; It was the first time that I felt_like I was a_level above the ( other ) players , &quot; said McEnroe , whose U.S. Open championship in 1984 was the last of his seven Grand_Slam event titles . &quot; My mistake was , at the end of the year , I was resting_on it a little bit , saying , ' I ' m going_to see what other people do ( to catch_up ) , ' as opposed to working harder at that particular time . &quot; It will be interesting to see how Pete reacts at the end of this year or , depending_on what happens , the remaining part of this year. &quot; McEnroe , though , said that Sampras has no glaring weaknesses . &quot; I mean , to nit-pick about someone as_good_as that is absurd , &quot; McEnroe said . &quot; He ' s a great player , there ' s no question about it . I ' d love to have that serve for a couple weeks . And he has worked extremely hard . He obviously learns from his mistakes because he ' s been around for a while and now his time is here. &quot; * On the flip side : While Sampras ' star has skyrocketed , Jim Courier ' s has plummeted . Courier spent more_than two years at No . 1 or 2 before last November , but has twice fallen to No . 5 this year and is currently ranked fourth . He has won only one title in the last 11 months , none since August , and only two matches against top-10 opponents , both against Goran Ivanisevic . He lost eight of his last 15 matches in 1993 and has twice lost his opening match in tournaments this year . He has reached the final in only one of his last 14 tournaments . &quot; He ' s obviously lost his confidence , and I think his game is based a lot on his confidence , &quot; McEnroe said . &quot; He ' s not as natural a player as Pete , for example , so he can ' t rely_on his ability . &quot; He ' s got_to rely more on his physical conditioning , and it all plays hand in_hand with his mental frame_of_mind . He ' s probably been going so hard for the last couple years -- he trains so hard -- that he ' s probably a little bit burned_out . &quot; Although it looks right now that he ' s really struggling , he ' s still got time to pull it together , potentially , before the_French Open. &quot; McEnroe suggested that Courier , a two-time French Open winner , might benefit from turning_down the intensity a notch as he prepares_for this year ' s tournament , which opens in Paris on May 23 . &quot; It ' s hard to honestly know what he needs to do without having seen him play a lot and not knowing what ' s in his head at this particular time , &quot; McEnroe said . &quot; But some people , when things go_wrong , they like to train harder . And it looks_like he ' s doing even more of that , from what I understand . &quot; I would probably advocate taking_it_easy a little bit because he ' s certainly in shape . He ' s probably hurting himself at this point . &quot; But he ' ll probably do exactly the opposite. &quot; * Back on track : Steffi Graf , who withdrew from last month ' s Family_Circle Magazine Cup because of a minor knee injury , is expected to return to action this week in the Citizen Cup at Hamburg , Germany . The WTA Tour ' s No . 1 player is unbeaten in 28 matches and winner of five tournaments this year . &quot; I don ' t expect to win everything , but I know I can do_it , &quot; Graf said last month after winning the Lipton Championship at Key Biscayne , Fla . &quot; that ' s what ' s important , to know you can. &quot; * Asian Ace : After winning the Salem Open at Hong Kong this month , Michael Chang is 41-5 in Asia during the last two years , 16-2 this year . Six of his 16 titles have been won in Asia , all since the start of 1993 . Tennis Notes Tracy Austin , who was 17 when she passed the $ 1-million mark in earnings during the summer of 1980 , still needs $ 17 # 991 to pass the $ 2-million mark . . . . It has been almost two years , a span of 33 tournaments , since Gabriela Sabatini won the Italian Open in 1992 for her last WTA Tour title . She has lost in five finals during that time . . . . Next Saturday is the one-year anniversary of the attack on Monica Seles . . . . Randy Snow , 10-time U.S. Open wheelchair tennis champion , will be among the instructors at a camp for players in wheelchairs Wednesday through next Sunday at the Vic Braden Tennis College in Coto de Caza .
