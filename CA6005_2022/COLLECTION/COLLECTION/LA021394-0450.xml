   <HEADLINE> THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE ; HABITAT ; &quot; THE MOST RADICAL APPROACH TO REBUILDING LOS ANGELES IS NOT TO BUILD OR REBUILD AT ALL IN RISKY PLACES &quot;</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Again , Los Angeles looks longingly to its past as it tries chart a future . It is spending billions rebuilding its long-abandoned commuter rail system . For the first time in more_than 30 years , voters elected a Republican mayor who radiated nostalgia for that safer , more manageable city of old . Now , more_than ever , people seem preoccupied with the idea of going_back -- as if the collapse of the freeways revealed the ruins of a more stable , civil society . In Malibu , where fire and earthquakes are perhaps more a part of the life-cycle than in most other places in Los Angeles , Mayor Carolyn Van Horn ponders a new kind of general plan that both shapes and reflects the sense of community she recalls from growing_up in the San Fernando Valley . &quot; Nature was a part of life . People had chickens in their back yards . Everybody had a vegetable_garden . The adults always knew where the children were . You could go next door if you needed something . If they didn ' t have it , you could walk to the store . . . . &quot; The possibility of Los Angeles as a collection of self-sufficient communities -- where people know their neighbors and where King Car no longer reigns -- has nourished the frustrated dreams of local architects and planners for years . The concept of the urban village lies at the heart of two grandiose plans . Playa Vista , just south of Marina del Rey , will be a mostly low-rise cluster of homes , stores and offices for 28 # 000 people of varying incomes . The other , Central_City West , just across the Harbor Freeway from Downtown , is meant to provide an even larger mix of residential and commercial space . Yet these projects were planned in an era that seems eons ago , before recession , riot , wildfire and earthquake . Many of the building_blocks for urban villages are already dotting the landscape , to hear architect Craig Hodgetts tell it . He points to the outdoor farmers ' markets , the swap meets and the empty storefronts that could become neighborhood offices for a decentralized bureaucracy . Linking them together would be the electronic highway that people enter from their home computers . Unlike the Red Car , which went_out of business , the city ' s urban villages didn ' t disappear so_much as become dysfunctional , casualties of crime , job flight and middle-class exodus . And as in small_towns elsewhere , the corner stores were upstaged by the big suburban malls . Yet the outlines remain of the place this once was -- in neighborhoods from Watts to Echo Park , from Boyle Heights to North Hollywood . They have relatively compact housing patterns yet still offer many pleasant side streets of single-family homes that are within easy strolls of shops and schools . Why then , as so many planners ask , struggle to create entirely new towns on a nostalgic model , when the real ones still exist and need cash and encouragement to come_back ? &quot; The most visionary thing of all would be using this as an opportunity to strengthen what we have . Invest in South-Central and South Bay and East L.A. , &quot; said Culver City community development director Mark H . Winogrond , who also heads the Los Angeles section of the American Planning Assn . Perhaps the most radical approach to rebuilding Los Angeles is not to build or rebuild at all_in seismically or otherwise risky places . In densely populated parts of the city , why rebuild every condemned building , when a park or a community garden might serve better ? Overcrowding is &quot; part and parcel of decline . If all we do is repair the earthquake damage , it ' s not going_to stop the cycle of deterioration and the linking of that deterioration to other social problems like drugs , crime and gangs , &quot; said Barbara Zeidman , assistant general_manager of the Los Angeles city housing department . Within those neighborhoods , planners envision building more apartments and opening others into three- and four-bedroom flats to accommodate the larger families of an immigrant population . The old model of ground-level retail and living above the store could be revived ; so could living above the office . Density would go_up in these neighborhoods , but the housing could remain affordable . What matters most is trying something different . Hodgetts talks_about &quot; more improvisational and transitory forms. &quot; Hodgetts ' best-known design , UCLA ' s temporary library , may be appropriate for a city whose faith in bricks and mortar has been shaken : It ' s a huge tent , actually a cluster of interconnected tents complete with heating , air conditioning and the electronic capacity for a 40-station computer lab . No one is foolhardy enough to predict the death of the single-family house with its lemon_tree in a sunny California yard . But what of that house ? Although the model of a wood frame bolted to its foundation withstood the temblors well enough , some have conceived houses better equipped for the aftermath of natural or man-made horrors . That could mean a survivalist ' s fortress , a post-apocalypse &quot; Road Warrior &quot; compound , with its own power generator , heavy security devices and an awesome telecommunications ability . And in case all else fails , maybe a helicopter waits_on the roof . The kindler , gentler version is an eco-house built with recyclable materials proven to withstand quakes . A house that also has its own septic and compost systems independent of city pipes that can break_down , a house that collects rainwater and uses it wisely , taps solar_energy and has , perhaps , some chickens or goats in the yard . Instead of an escape helicopter , maybe several bicycles sit in a shed . For a less extreme lifestyle change ? Craig Kronenberg , an architect with the Johannes Van Tilburg firm in Santa Monica , suggests more plywood , less marble ; garden block walls replaced by old-style wooden fences ; masonry chimneys replaced by prefabricated metal flues or maybe fewer fireplaces altogether ; no more houses on stilts ; less unnecessary heavy ornamentation . &quot; It ' s an aesthetic , &quot; he says , &quot; born of necessity. &quot; FRANK CLIFFORD and LARRY GORDON</TEXT>
