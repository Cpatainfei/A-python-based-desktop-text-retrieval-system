   <HEADLINE> A SAFETY NET FOR EMPLOYEES WITH KIDS ; FAMILY : KNOWING THAT A CHILD-CARE MIX-UP CAN KEEP A WORKING PARENT AT_HOME -- AND CUT PRODUCTIVITY -- A GROWING NUMBER OF COMPANIES ARE OFFERING BACKUP ASSISTANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jane Sherburne was an ambitious junior associate at the venerable Washington law_firm of Wilmer , Cutler and Pickering nine years ago -- and she was also the mother of a 4-year-old boy . The day Hurricane Gloria thundered through the capital , closing Ben ' s nursery_school , her entire professional future flashed -- and nearly crashed -- before her eyes . In desperation , because two of Sherburne ' s partners needed her help and because Ben ' s father was out of town , she brought the child to work . Busied with coloring books , Legos and a stern lecture to be_quiet or Mom ' s career was history , Ben was doing fine while his mother and her colleagues stewed over their papers at a conference_table . Their concentration was abruptly shattered when a tiny voice piped_up . &quot; Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer . . . &quot; Sherburne , now a partner at the law_firm and the mother of two more children , still shudders at the memory : &quot; I watched one of my partners . This shiver started in his toes and went right up_to his face . I thought it was the end of my career. &quot; Instead , it was the beginning of one of the country ' s first backup child-care centers . Nearly a decade later , as large and small businesses alike follow_suit , the Wilmer , Cutler and Pickering facility is cited as the model for a slice of the work / family menu that is now regarded not as corporate benevolence , but as economic necessity . Backup child_care has become &quot; a business imperative , &quot; said Susan Seitel , who edits a Minneapolis-based periodical called the Work / Family Newsbrief . &quot; It ' s all about billable hours. &quot; Few organizations are prepared to minister on-site to sick children . But a growing number of companies have recognized that if an employee can ' t get_to work because of a glitch in child_care , it ' s money down the corporate drain . No one has come_up with an exact number , but more and more businesses are setting_aside on-site space to provide temporary child_care in emergency situations . As the newest piece of the work / family equation , backup child_care remains chiefly the province of big , successful companies or small , forward-thinking enterprises . Those who have embraced it are adamant that backup child_care is vital to the modern work_force . &quot; This is not about philosophy , &quot; said Ellen Reynolds , a managing director at Bankers Trust in New York . &quot; It ' s about productivity , productivity , productivity. &quot; The two backup child-care centers at the Bankers Trust buildings in Manhattan and in Jersey City , N.J. , turned_out to be a godsend when a number of local schools were closed during an asbestos scare , Reynolds said . Bankers Trust is also part of a consortium of Manhattan financial_organizations that share a larger backup center_on Wall_Street , accommodating up_to 40 children from 3 months to 12 years old at a nominal hourly cost . &quot; Whether we ' re talking_about a secretary or a senior-level manager , we know we ' re at_a_loss if that person doesn ' t come_to work because of a child-care problem , &quot; Reynolds said . &quot; I don ' t think anyone would say this is a soft and fuzzy place , &quot; she added . &quot; We ' re very lean and mean and tough . But where possible , we try to provide people with some crutches to get_over the hard spots. &quot; Yet when the subject is day_care , said Richard Stolley , this awareness is confined to a narrow stratum of American business . Stolley , founder of People magazine , is now a senior editorial adviser at Time Warner Inc. He also serves on the board of directors of the Child_Care Action Campaign . Stolley travels the country to meet with top_executives . &quot; You start talking_about on-site child_care to businessmen -- and even businesswomen -- and they turn white , &quot; he said . &quot; They don ' t want to talk_about it. &quot; A major problem in even introducing a discussion of on-site child_care -- backup or otherwise -- among most employers is that &quot; at the level where the decisions have to be made , few of those involved have ever wrestled with the problem. &quot; With the bottom_line on their minds , &quot; what they ' re really looking_for is empirical studies , &quot; Stolley said . Still , survey after survey shows backup child_care to be a source of employee anxiety , said Judi Presser of Work / Family Directions . The Boston consulting_firm has found &quot; people reporting that they miss up_to one to three days of work per month &quot; because of child-care emergencies , she said . Employees say they have no role_models , since no previous generation has seen so many single mothers or working couples in the labor_force , Presser said . A near-universal lament is that workers are unprepared when their baby-sitters get sick , have an accident on the way to work or quit on a moment ' s notice . Unexpected school closings also wreak domestic havoc -- and even predictable holidays can throw working families into a tailspin . Working parents have &quot; this kind of card-house arrangement that we have struggled so hard to build , &quot; said Seitel of Work / Family Newsbrief . &quot; A child-care failure of any kind just knocks_down all_the cards. &quot; But many parents put_on child-care blinders , Seitel said . &quot; Everything is just perfect until something goes_wrong , &quot; she said . &quot; And we pretend that it ' s not going_to happen to us. &quot; As the working parents of two children , Mayer and Sharon Berg of Minneapolis were only too familiar_with the potholes that even the most perfect child-care arrangements can encounter . Six and a half years ago , they turned the nightmare of necessity into a dream invention called Club Kid , catering to families whose child_care has suddenly cratered . From 7:30 a.m. until midnight children from 18 months to 10 years old can now dance , finger-paint or operate computers at five facilities in the Twin Cities area . &quot; With so many working parents and the way things have been going , there was definitely a need , &quot; Berg said . Nancy Platt , the director of work / family services at Time Warner in New York , said her company ' s financial overseers have not quibbled with the $ 400 # 000 it costs each year to subsidize Time ' s backup child-care facility . &quot; We ' ve never done a cost-benefit_analysis , &quot; Platt said . &quot; You can add it up yourself and see the savings , never mind the improved morale. &quot; Top-echelon executives and junior-level clerks are equally likely to use the services on an upper floor of the Time-Life tower , said Patti Maltese , manager of the 1 1 / 2-year-old center . Up to 30 children per day may use the backup program , Maltese said ; each employee parent is entitled to send a child there for free for up_to 20 days in a calendar_year . &quot; The kids love it , &quot; Maltese said . &quot; It ' s like going_to work with Mom or Dad. &quot; At the Cal-Tot Child_Care Center in the Ronald Reagan State Office_Building in Downtown Los Angeles , assistant director Lalila Rivera reported a similar chorus of enthusiasm from parents in the City_Hall vicinity . Cal-Tot is open weekdays from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. , and state employees are given priority for the 80 full-time child-care slots that are available to children from six weeks to six years of_age . Rivera said parents can call to see if there are openings when the need for backup child_care arises . Per-day prices vary , depending_on the child ' s age . &quot; They should have started this a long_time ago , &quot; said Rivera , pointing to the decline in employee absentee_rates since backup care became an option . &quot; I think every building should have one. &quot; Backup child_care also turns_out to be a_leveling experience . At the staid Manhattan law_firm of Cravath , Swain and Moore , attorneys who were born in three-piece suits trip over Brio trains in the firm ' s backup care facility right alongside the parents who are secretaries and mail_clerks . &quot; It ' s the great equalizer , &quot; said Barbie White , who runs the backup care center at Wilmer , Cutler and Pickering in Washington . White giggled impishly , as if to concede that corporate attorneys are not always known as a fun bunch . &quot; It ' s neat to watch the attorneys turn_into parents , &quot; White said .</TEXT>
