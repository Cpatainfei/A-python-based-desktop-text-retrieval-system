   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON NORTH_KOREA ; CREATING A NUCLEAR STRAW_MAN ; THERE ' S NO REAL EVIDENCE OF A THREAT EXCEPT IN THE EYES OF A PENTAGON NEEDING TO JUSTIFY ITS TWO-WAR BUDGET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> North_Korea , lost for years in the back pages of newspapers and absent entirely from TV news , has re-emerged as headline material . Always a hard case , certainly no friend of America , North_Korea has quietly been disintegrating economically for decades while South_Korea has become a powerful economic , political and military_force in Northeast Asia . Now , with twice the population and 10 times the productive output of its neighbor , South_Korea seems well situated to deal with any military threat it might perceive from North_Korea . In 1989 , Pentagon representatives testified in Congress that &quot; South_Korean forces are capable of defending themselves against any threat from the North that does not involve either the Soviet_Union or the Peoples ' Republic of China. &quot; Since then , North_Korea has made no significant change in its military_forces or weapons and has cut its military spending in half ( $ 4.1 billion to $ 2.2 billion ) . During the same period , South_Korea has upgraded its forces qualitatively and increased defense spending almost 50 % ( $ 8.5 billion to $ 12.1 billion ) . It is difficult to explain how South_Korea is more vulnerable now when it is outspending North_Korea by a 6-1 margin and enjoys marked superiority in the quality of its military equipment , technology , mobility and support . For this reason , Pentagon officials have been forced to highlight the North_Korean nuclear program as a &quot; new danger &quot; in_order to justify the official expressions of alarm now dominating the news . Secretary_of_Defense William J . Perry has issued a series of dramatic assessments of the growing nuclear threat from North_Korea . On Easter_Sunday , speaking on NBC ' s &quot; Meet the Press , &quot; he raised the stakes by establishing a six-month time_limit for North_Korea to satisfy U.S. demands that it freeze its nuclear program . This is diplomacy by ultimatum , a notoriously unsuccessful negotiating technique when dealing with authoritarian leaders . And what motivates the ultimatum ? Just what great danger lurks north of the DMZ ? According to Perry , North_Korea may now have enough plutonium to build one or two nuclear explosive_devices . That estimate is far from certain because it rests_on the assumption that the North_Koreans refueled their 5-megawatt reactor in 1989 . If not , they do not have enough plutonium to make a firecracker . Even if North_Korea did refuel , further assumptions must be validated to postulate a nuclear threat : that North_Korea has a reprocessing capability efficient enough to produce up_to 15 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium from the spent reactor fuel ; that it has been able to fashion a reliable &quot; trigger &quot; to produce a significant explosion , and that it has been able to package their design in a configuration small enough for use as a deliverable weapon . Unless all three assumptions are true , North_Korea ' s nuclear program has little military significance , because possessing one or two explosive_devices is a far_cry from the ability to employ nuclear_weapons for military purposes . The tenuous proposition that we face a growing North_Korean nuclear threat was weakened last December by then-Secretary of Defense Les Aspin . &quot; Whatever happened in 1989 , the situation is not deteriorating now. &quot; Aspin said . &quot; They are not developing more plutonium to make more nuclear bombs. &quot; Because it is really impossible to describe a credible current threat , Perry has now resorted_to pointing with alarm at a hypothetical threat that will exist &quot; two or three years from now ( when ) they ' re producing bombs at the rate of a dozen a year , &quot; a conclusion supported by arguable assumptions . Perhaps this would ring truer if North_Korea ' s neighbors were seeing the same threat . Unfortunately for our diplomacy , Russia , China , South_Korea and Japan are not alarmed and are utterly unwilling to support U.S. ultimatums and demands for sanctions . These are the very nations at risk ( as America is not ) , if North_Korea can produce deliverable nuclear_weapons . In truth , China and South_Korea are far more concerned about Japan building_up a huge stock of plutonium than they are about Kim Il Sung ' s meager nuclear effort . All of the evidence suggests that American citizens are being subjected_to a well-orchestrated Pentagon campaign to restore North_Korea to enemy status . In order to justify a budget based on their current two-war strategy , our military needs two enemies . Because North_Korea spends less than 1 % of what we spend for military_forces , it makes a satisfactory enemy only if the specter of nuclear_weapons is raised as a scare tactic . The great danger in promoting this ominous image of nuclear danger is that our words and actions may create a military crisis where none exists , an outcome which could have tragic consequences .</TEXT>
