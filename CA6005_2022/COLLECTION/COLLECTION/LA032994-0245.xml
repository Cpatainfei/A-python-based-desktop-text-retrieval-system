   <HEADLINE> 2ND SUSPECT MAY HAVE AIDED IN COLOSIO KILLING ; MEXICO : FEDERAL POLICE NOW BELIEVE GUARD CLEARED PATH FOR GUNMAN AND ARE HOLDING HIM FOR QUESTIONING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Amid increasing indications of a conspiracy , Mexican federal police said Monday that they now believe a security_guard aided the gunman accused of assassinating presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio last week . Investigators were questioning Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas , a retired police_officer hired to provide crowd_control , whom photos and videos of the incident show near Colosio and accused gunman Mario Aburto Martinez seconds before the fatal shots were fired . A girlfriend of Aburto has told police that Aburto met with Sanchez in a Tijuana park a week before the March 23 assassination , according to Mexican federal_officials , who suspect Sanchez of clearing a path through the crowd for the gunman . Although Aburto is considered the lone gunman , police are investigating &quot; the probable participation of accomplices , co-participants or protectors of Aburto Martinez , as is the case of ( Sanchez ) , &quot; said Deputy Atty . Gen . Rene Gonzalez de la Vega in a statement . &quot; His behavior and his attitudes near the candidate and Aburto Martinez lead us to presume that he participated directly with the accused killer. &quot; These revelations provide the strongest support yet for what journalists , politicians and other Mexicans have been asserting for days : that Colosio , the leading candidate for Mexico ' s presidency , was the victim of a plot involving more_than one person . And the focus of the probe appears to be the possible involvement of members of a security team provided by local officials of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , known as the PRI . Until now , Mexican authorities had said that Aburto , 23 , acted alone when he emerged from a crowd and shot Colosio twice at point-blank range after the candidate finished a speech . But security_guard Sanchez was detained for questioning this weekend because his actions raised investigators ' suspicions , U.S. and Mexican sources said . Videotapes and photographs of the assassination , which took_place in the sloping dirt plaza of a shantytown , show Sanchez -- a tall man wearing a baseball_cap -- in the crowd just behind Colosio . On the right , the gunman can be seen approaching and raising the gun to the candidate ' s head as Colosio shakes hands with well-wishers . Police suspect Sanchez aided Aburto by leading him through the crowd , according to sources in both nations . &quot; They are reviewing the tapes to see if he ' s opening a path for Aburto to get closer , &quot; one official said . Moreover , the girlfriend ' s statement to authorities appears to establish a prior connection between Sanchez and Aburto , who in his confession said he practiced for the shooting with a . 38-caliber revolver . He also hinted that others were involved , according to witnesses to the interrogation last week in Tijuana . &quot; The supposed girlfriend of Mario Aburto Martinez said that he and Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas had a meeting a week before in Tijuana , &quot; said Hugo Morales , press secretary in the attorney_general ' s office . The meeting was in a public park , Morales said . Sanchez is a retired officer of the commercial police , a municipal force that provides security for businesses , federal authorities said . He is described as being in his 50s . Sanchez was hired on the morning of the assassination by Rodolfo Riva Palacio Tinajero , a leader of the PRI , for crowd_control in Tijuana ' s impoverished Lomas Taurinas neighborhood , authorities said . In a news release Monday , the attorney_general ' s office emphasized that Sanchez had no connection to the commanding_officer of Colosio ' s personal security_force -- members of the Mexican equivalent of the Secret_Service , who traveled with the candidate . Instead , Sanchez was one of about 45 local guards provided_for crowd_control , Mexican officials say . Sanchez ' s name , however , does not appear on a typewritten list of guards , American and Mexican sources said . His name was handwritten onto the list , apparently a late addition that has attracted the attention of investigators . The team of Tijuana-based security_guards included former city and state police_officers who belong_to the PRI and were assembled by officials of the local party branch , PRI officials said in interviews Monday . The guards included Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela , 47 , a former deputy chief homicide investigator of the state judicial police . He was arrested in the melee immediately after the shooting but was later released after federal authorities said he was merely a witness who helped subdue the gunman . In a new development involving Mayoral , the father of the accused assassin told The Times on Monday that Mayoral had befriended Aburto months before the shooting . Mayoral is thus the second member of the Colosio security entourage provided by the PRI to be linked to Aburto before the assassination . According to the father , Mayoral sought_out Aburto late last year and bragged to the young_man about his trips overseas to Russia , among other destinations , and also of his former friendship with Lazaro Cardenas , the revered former president of Mexico , who died in 1970 . Mayoral maintained the friendship in recent months , the father said , although Aburto didn ' t like him . &quot; I think Mayoral is the key to this , &quot; said the father , Ruben Aburto , 47 , who resides in San Pedro , Los Angeles ' harbor district , along with two of the suspect ' s brothers . Family members assert that Mexican officials are making Aburto the fall_guy for a larger conspiracy to conceal the involvement of the government . Although they have no proof , relatives maintain that Aburto may have been forced to go_to the scene , perhaps after alleged conspirators threatened to kill other family members in Tijuana . Times staff writers Patrick J . McDonnell in San Pedro and Juanita Darling in Mexico_City contributed to this report . * ANOTHER VIEW : Suspect Mario Aburto Martinez is hard-working , intelligent , friends and family say .
