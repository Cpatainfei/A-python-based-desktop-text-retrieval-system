   <HEADLINE> FOR YELTSIN , IT ' S LONELY AT THE TOP -- BUT NOT BECAUSE HE ' S POWERFUL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since the parliamentary elections two months ago , a new political reality has formed in Russia . Paradoxically , the new constitution has not fulfilled its purpose : to amplify the authority and influence of President Boris N . Yeltsin . The situation is reminiscent_of Mikhail S . Gorbachev ' s . The more new rights and powers the former president received from the Supreme Soviet , the more illusory his authority became . Besides formal authority , a leader needs the people ' s faith -- and Yeltsin has not received a new installment of the people ' s trust . His intention to create his own &quot; party of power &quot; is hollow , since only bureaucrats from his administration would join it . Many influential politicians who only yesterday were totally loyal to Yeltsin now only think_about future presidential elections . After meeting with Yeltsin before announcing her resignation , Social_Security Minister Ella A . Pamfilova said , &quot; He is very lonely. &quot; In other words : Yeltsin is politically isolated , the result of unpopular policies . What is the new disposition of the political forces in Russia ? Though the majority in the lower chamber of Parliament belongs_to the political opposition , Yeltsin cannot even count_on the support of his ostensible allies in Russia ' s Choice . The faction has already announced its opposition to the government of Prime_Minister Victor S . Chernomyrdin and increasingly criticizes the president for accepting virtually all_the conditions of the &quot; government of pragmatists. &quot; Many of his harshest critics -- including , Yegor T . Gaidar , Gennady E . Burbulis , Sergei M . Shakhrai , Nikolai I . Travkin , Grigory A . Yavlinsky -- were once close allies . The speaker of the lower chamber is Ivan Rybkin , who ran_on the conservative Agrarian Party slate . A more favorable situation exists in the Federation Council , the upper house of Parliament , where Vice Premier Vladimir F . Shumeiko , an ally , was elected chair . Yet even that advantage is mixed . Although many members of the chamber , as regional heads of administration , owe their jobs to Yeltsin , the election of Shumeiko became possible only after Chernomyrdin intervened . Indeed , at the center of Russia ' s changing political reality is the prime_minister ' s growing influence . Chernomyrdin not only enjoys greater support in both houses of Parliament . According to the new constitution , the head of the government is the legal inheritor of presidential powers , the &quot; non-elected vice president. &quot; Former Vice_President Alexander V . Rutskoi , who opposed the bankrupt policy of Gaidar , did not even enjoy a fraction of Chernomyrdin ' s authority . Yeltsin has sought to offset Chernomyrdin ' s clout by securing his personal control over the &quot; power &quot; ministries -- defense , interior and security . He apparently anticipates more social and economic troubles and is trying to distance himself from the government , shifting responsibility in the prime_minister ' s direction whenever opportunity arises . But judging from Chernomyrdin ' s behavior , he is not afraid of taking responsibility . He understands that the difficulties connected with reform are tied_in the public mind to Yeltsin and Gaidar . There are equally important developments in the other republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States . The possible monetary union of Russia and Belarus , which served as a pretext for Gaidar ' s resignation , could herald the restoration of a ruble zone . It would hold together a budding economic union of former Soviet republics and facilitate their political integration . The economic and military might of the Soviet_Union , it should be recalled , was based on the union of Russia , Byelorussia , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Ukraine . Any real move toward political and economic integration would not be warmly received in the international financial_centers that advised the course of action followed by economic reformers Gaidar and Boris G . Fyodorov . With their resignations , the Russian state slowly began to change its course . This shift worries those who favored the collapse of the Soviet_Union , in 1991 , and supported the bankrupt policy of &quot; shock therapy. &quot; To reformers , the recent ouster of Stanislav Shushkevich , chairman of Belarus ' Supreme Council , was a major defeat , widely interpreted as the revenge of reform ' s opponents . The next scheduled elections in Russia will be local . Given the growing influence of the regional economic and political elites , the importance of these elections should not be underestimated . Russian and foreign political_scientists and analysts are looking toward the results with concern : Will the elections confirm the tendencies that emerged last December , when the far-right party of Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky unexpectedly won , or will they reveal more favorable attitudes toward the Kremlin ? As in the days when the Communist_Party held political power in the Soviet_Union , the overriding problem is that Russia still lacks one fundamental attribute of a democracy : a legal mechanism for transferring power . Yeltsin ' s starry hour was over long ago . He has clearly run_out of political , physical and psychological resources . It is also evident that Yeltsin has not been involved in the implementation of reforms for a long_time . He is preoccupied with his personal political survival . Political isolation is a worrisome symptom of the approaching political collapse . The main task of the painfully emerging Russian democracy is to separate the personal drama of a politician from a repetition of the national tragedy .</TEXT>
