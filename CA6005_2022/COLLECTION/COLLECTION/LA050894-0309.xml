   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : SOUTHEAST : BELL GARDENS ; STUDENTS OPEN_UP ABOUT GUNS , SUICIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The subject was &quot; Kids Killing Kids , &quot; and scores of junior and senior_high_school students sat motionless , listening as one of_their_own talked_about the temptation of a gun . &quot; Sometimes it ' s weird because I ' m in my house and my parents pressure me a lot about my grades and that ' s when you start to think_about suicide , &quot; said a seventh-grade student from Suva Intermediate School . &quot; We have a gun in the house . My dad keeps it for protection and he taught me how to use it . Sometimes , I get_it from my mom ' s room and I ' m thinking_of what I ' m going_to do. &quot; Within minutes , a second girl , an eighth-grader , approached the microphone . &quot; I ' ve thought_about suicide too . . . . &quot; That was all she could utter before she choked on her words and ran_out of Ross Auditorium to the privacy of the bathroom . About 150 students attended a recent open microphone forum hosted by the city and the Bell Gardens Police_Department , at which they were encouraged to talk_about violence in their community and discuss alternatives . Officials expected talk_of gangs and guns but the forum focused equally on other adolescent conflicts . Emotions ran so high that several students were whisked_away for immediate crisis counseling . The students had been assigned to watch a television special also titled &quot; Kids Killing Kids , &quot; which dealt with teen suicide , gang violence and the dangers of guns , even if used in self-defense or to impress others . The purpose of the forum was to help students realize they are not alone and to help city officials better understand the needs of the community ' s youth , event organizers said . &quot; We are the ones who have to go_out on the street and get the people who are bleeding and dying and we don ' t have the answers either , &quot; said Police_Chief Andy Romero , adding that Bell Gardens officers responded to gunshot calls more_than once each day in 1993 . &quot; A lot of times we adults discuss these issues of kids and violence , but we don ' t live it every day with them on campus so this may give us a better idea of what to do to help them in this battle , &quot; said Assistant City_Manager Karen Nobrega . Initially shy , students slowly came_forward , prompted by Bell Gardens High resource officer Gilbert Gamboa . One described how a classmate threatened her with a gun , another described conflicts with her parents and her life as a runaway , a third told of being dumped by her boyfriend and of her subsequent suicide attempt . City officials helped students come_up with nonviolent solutions to some of their problems and urged them to seek outside help . &quot; Don ' t let a negative response from your parents block you , &quot; advised City_Manager Charles Gomez . &quot; Go_to your teacher or to the police . . . A lot of times the parent is the problem . Keep that in mind , too. &quot; Gamboa said about 600 of 3 # 200 Bell Gardens High_School students have approached him with various conflicts during the past year . They report seeing weapons on campus , conflicts with their parents and in their relationships , and talk_about drugs , gangs and suicide , he said . &quot; Sometimes they may think it ' s really drastic but we say ' It may_not be as bad as you think , ' &quot; Gamboa said . &quot; ' We have resources and we ' ll help you. ' &quot; Bell Gardens High seniors Karen Ray and Christy Defries say they have sought Gamboa ' s advice many times . He recently helped them obtain a temporary restraining order against a classmate who threatened to shoot them . But some students grumbled that ideas such_as &quot; conflict resolution &quot; are unrealistic and seemed unconvinced that any adult would understand their world . &quot; You say ' Go_to counselors ' and that they listen , but they don ' t know what you ' re living , &quot; said Angelica , an eighth-grader . &quot; that ' s why people go_to suicide. &quot; MARY HELEN BERG</TEXT>
