   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL REPORT ; SOUTH PASADENA ; SOLAR PANELS TO SERVE SCHOOL AND HOMES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a groundbreaking project , Monterey Hills Elementary School and Southern California Edison have teamed_up to bring solar_energy to the school and 300 homes_in South Pasadena that were_on the brink of an energy burnout . &quot; This is the first time in the whole world that solar_energy is being used to this extent , &quot; said Edan Prabhu , Edison ' s project manager . In the past , Prabhu said , solar_energy has been used to power individual homes . For the first time , solar_energy will give a power boost to an entire neighborhood , he said . Edison officials chose the 300-house neighborhood , which they call Hill Grid , because of increasing demands that new or remodeled homes have been putting_on 30-year-old power_lines . Instead of rewiring insufficient underground service , Edison placed 180 solar_panels on the school ' s roof two weeks ago . When the sun is at its hottest , the metallic blue panels can harness 15 kilowatts -- or 150 100-watt bulbs -- worth of energy , which is then routed into the school ' s main power_lines . Another set of panels , 125 kilowatts worth , will be assembled on the school ' s roof in February . Eventually , the $ 5-million project sponsored by the federal_Department of Energy and Edison , will place solar_panels on houses and possibly parking_lots in the South Pasadena neighborhood and in areas of San Marino and La Canada Flintridge that face similar problems with inadequate power_lines . Edison officials said they hope that government-sponsored projects such_as this will help lower the cost of solar_energy by generating increased industrial and residential demand . Robert Vanderwall , school director of maintenance and operations , said he approached Edison last year with the idea of using the school after he heard that the utility wanted to bring solar_energy into the neighborhood . The school ' s large , flat roofs have unobstructed exposure to the sun and therefore make an ideal project site . The school will save about 25 % in annual electric_bills . Edison officials are also meeting with residents to see if they are interested in having the solar_panels on their roofs . The school did not have to pay_for its panels , but officials are not sure whether residents will be charged . Currently , one kilowatt of solar_power costs $ 7 , as opposed to less than $ 1 per kilowatt for natural_gas , but officials expect the price to go_down as solar_energy becomes more popular . School_Principal Joe Johnson said he also liked the idea of using the panels as learning tools . &quot; It actually dovetails with our science instruction , &quot; he said . &quot; The kids will find more applications of how solar_energy works. &quot;</TEXT>
