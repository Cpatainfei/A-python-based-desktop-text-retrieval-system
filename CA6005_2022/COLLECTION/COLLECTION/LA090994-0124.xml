   <TEXT> Serbian forces from Croatia and Bosnia launched a major assault Thursday against the Muslim-led army in Bosnia ' s northwestern Bihac enclave , while diplomats said Serbia would allow foreign monitors to check its cutoff of most assistance to the Bosnian Serbs . As more_than 1 # 000 rebel Serbian troops backed by tanks and artillery poured into Bihac from Croatia , Serbian forces fired a surface-to-air_missile at two NATO combat aircraft , U.N. and North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization officials said . The British Royal Navy Sea Harrier jump jets were not hit . The United Nations said the Bihac pincer offensive was alarming because it involved rebel Serbs from neighboring Croatia for the first time . U.N. spokesman Maj . Dacre Holloway , describing the Serbian thrust from Croatia as a major offensive , said , &quot; We ' re talking_of upward of 1 # 000 troops , tanks and artillery -- the works. &quot; NATO ' s Southern Command in Naples , Italy , said the two Harriers were_on a routine training mission and returned safely to their aircraft_carrier , the Invincible , in the Adriatic_Sea . &quot; They were operating in a close air-support training mission . . . when they visually sighted a small surface-to-air_missile coming toward them . Both planes took proper evasive_action , and they returned to their ship safely , &quot; NATO said . In Paris , the_French Foreign Ministry said Thursday that Serbia has agreed to let foreign observers monitor the closing of its border with Serb-controlled parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina . Serbia agreed to allow &quot; an international humanitarian mission &quot; along the border , ministry spokesman Richard Duque said . The mission would monitor implementation of the Belgrade government ' s pledge to cut_off all assistance , except food and medicine , to Bosnian Serbs waging war against the Muslim-led Bosnian government . Duque said Serbia disclosed its agreement Wednesday at a meeting in Berlin of officials from the United States , Russia , Germany , Britain and France . The five countries ' latest plan for ending Bosnia ' s 2 1 / 2-year war was rejected by the Bosnian Serbs last month . Duque gave no details about the composition of the observer team . Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has been under pressure from ultranationalists not to accept foreign military observers , and it appeared from Duque ' s phrasing that a compromise had been reached . There was no immediate official reaction in Belgrade , the Serbian and Yugoslav capital , to the statement . * The United States and the major European powers have offered to lift some economic sanctions on Yugoslavia , now reduced to the republics of Serbia and Montenegro , if the Serbian-led government allows international inspectors to verify that it has cut_off aid to Bosnian Serb forces . As an initial result , civilian air traffic to Belgrade could be reopened within a_few weeks and Yugoslavia readmitted to international sports and cultural events , with other measures to follow . The objective of such a move is to increase pressure on the Bosnian Serbs by separating them from Serbia , their main ally . But some Bosnians fear that the plan will enable the Bosnian Serbs to continue receiving clandestine aid while allowing Serbia itself to recover .</TEXT>
