   <HEADLINE> HEALTH PLAN WON ' T BE TOO COSTLY , ECONOMISTS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nobel laureate economist Robert M . Solow said Thursday that fears that the costs in President Clinton ' s health_care proposals would cripple small businesses are exaggerated , even as the Clinton_Administration seemed to be backpedaling on the issue . Solow said there would be an adverse impact on small businesses , but he suggested it would be short-lived as the new system took effect.Solow , an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , was one of several leading economists attending a conference on monetary policy sponsored by the Claremont Graduate_School . Nobel Prize_winner James Tobin , emeritus Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale_University , said : &quot; The economy can do OK , in_general , whether or not the Clinton plan is passed . It ' s not going_to kill the economy and it ' s not going_to make a big difference the other way , either . It ' s not a big macroeconomic issue. &quot;</TEXT>
