   <HEADLINE> MOVIE RAGS TO RICHES ; AT AN AUCTION OF FILM COSTUMES , A COAT WORN BY RUDOLPH VALENTINO IS EXPECTED TO BRING $ 15 # 000 OR MORE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the coronation scene in &quot; Desiree , &quot; Marlon Brando wore an outfit worthy of an emperor . Based on David ' s famous paint ing of Napoleon ' s actual coronation , the 40-year-old costume includes a crimson robe embroidered with golden bees , lined with white fur and ermine tails , and sporting a train worthy of a royal bride . From the &quot; Star Collection &quot; of Western Costume in North Hollywood , the imperial ensemble is a sartorial showstopper , evidence of what the people who dress the stars can do when they spare neither effort nor expense . &quot; It ' s of regal proportions , &quot; costume expert Glenn Brown says of the Rene Hubert design . And it ' s also on the block , one of more_than 300 pieces from the Western Costume collection that will be auctioned Sunday at Butterfield &amp; Butterfield . Brown , who is the specialist on memorabilia at the Hollywood auction_house , expects the coronation robes to bring more_than the $ 12 # 000 to $ 15 # 000 pre-sale estimate . &quot; Costumes of a military or historic nature tend to go higher , &quot; he says . Among those who have already expressed interest in the costume , which includes a pair of cream satin boots and a gold laurel_wreath , are two museums . According to Brown , more people than ever are interested in collecting pieces of Hollywood history . He estimates that there are more_than 100 major players in the Hollywood costume field and hundreds more with smaller collections . Brown himself is a veteran collector whose coups include paying $ 1 at an MGM sale for a simple gingham dress that turned_out to be the one Judy Garland wore in &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; when she sang &quot; Somewhere Over the Rainbow. &quot; Brown later sold it at auction for $ 9 # 000 . Western Costume is the oldest and largest supplier of costumes to the entertainment_industry . Founded in 1912 to provide authentic Indian costumes to William S . Hart ' s pioneer film company , it is perhaps best known as the maker of Dorothy ' s ruby slippers . Famous for being able to costume casts of thousands , it lent thousands of military_uniforms to the California National_Guard when it was caught short in the wake of Pearl_Harbor . The company has 5 million items for rent . Sunday ' s event is a sequel to the first &quot; Star Collection &quot; sale in October . At that auction , a dress worn by Vivien Leigh in &quot; Gone With the Wind &quot; ( the traveling suit Scarlett wore during her traumatic ride through Shantytown ) sold for $ 33 # 350 , a record for the 1939 film . A brown velvet jacket that adorned Errol Flynn in &quot; Captain Blood &quot; brought $ 31 # 050 . The sailor_suits and dresses worn by the terminally adorable Von Trapp kiddies in &quot; The Sound of Music &quot; were bid up_to $ 19 # 550 . And a person who can only be described as a real Kirk Douglas fan paid $ 3 # 450 for one of his loincloths from &quot; Spartacus. &quot; Items at that first &quot; Star Collection &quot; sale sold for a total of more_than $ 590 # 000 . &quot; Gone With the Wind &quot; fans will find nothing as spectacular as Scarlett ' s suit in Sunday ' s sale , but there are some wonderful bonnets worn by Leigh and Olivia de Havilland as Melanie . And there is a handsome set of clothes designed by Walter Plunkett for Clark Cable in his role as Rhett Butler . The Gable ensemble includes a pair of striped wool trousers labeled &quot; Eddie Schmidt 4 / 17 / 39. &quot; As Hollywood memorabilia expert and collector James Comisar explains , Gable was unhappy with his first &quot; GWTW &quot; costumes -- he said they fit him like a potato sack -- and claimed that he would n ' t report for work until Schmidt , his personal tailor , re-cut them . Gable did not wear the pants , shirt and fancy black vest together in the film , which diminishes their value for the most demanding collectors . But , as Brown points_out , &quot; GWTW &quot; costumes are extremely hard to come_by since most are owned by the family of the epic ' s producer , the late David O . Selznick . Brown thinks that the ensemble will exceed the pre-sale estimate of $ 6 # 000 to $ 8 # 000 . Material relating to the late Errol Flynn has become increasingly valuable in recent years , enhanced by the actor ' s rakish reputation as much as his on-screen charisma , according to Brown . There has been considerable pre-sale interest in a forest guy shirt ( green , needless to say ) that Flynn wore while stealing from the rich to give to the poor in &quot; The Adventures of Robin_Hood &quot; ( 1938 ) . Several of Flynn ' s jackets and a pair of breeches he wore in &quot; The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex &quot; ( 1939 ) will also be sold . Among the big-ticket items in Sunday ' s auction : Rudolph Valentino ' s burgundy-and-silver coat , probably from &quot; Son of the Sheik &quot; ( 1926 ) , which is expected to bring $ 15 # 000 or more . A navy_blue frock_coat worn by Orson Welles in &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; ( 1941 ) is also expected to attract collectors who can afford to pay $ 12 # 000 or more for an important garment from a great movie . And then there are the green-and-white costumes worn by the Von Trapp darlings in &quot; The Sound of Music &quot; ( 1965 ) . The so-called &quot; drapery costumes , &quot; which have a pre-sale estimate of $ 7 # 000 , are expected to trigger brisk bidding , given their special role in the film . These are the play clothes that Maria ( Julie Andrews ) , fresh out of the convent and hired as governess to the Von Trapps , whips_up for her new charges from the draperies in her bedroom . Intriguing items with pre-sale estimates of $ 1 # 500 or less include Charlie Chaplin ' s armband from &quot; The Great Dictator , &quot; Gary Cooper ' s baseball knickers from &quot; Pride of the Yankees &quot; and an Elizabeth Taylor bustier . The last item , Brown says , is pale pink silk , with a plunging neckline , extensively wired throughout &quot; to push and shove. &quot; In preparing_for the two Western Costume sales , a major task was sifting through the company ' s vast holdings in search of significant clothes and accessories . Since Western is a busy , working costume house , the kinds of records archivists long for were rarely kept . Sometimes stars ' names were sewn into their costumes , but not always . Brown , whose personal collection includes five choice gowns from &quot; Marie Antoinette &quot; ( 1937 ) , had to become a sartorial sleuth while helping to select items for the auction . His collector ' s sense began to tingle when he came_across a cream silk bolero jacket trimmed with black soutache that had the look of a star but no label . &quot; When you ' ve been doing this as long as I have , you get sort of psychic about these things , &quot; he says . &quot; And this thing was talking to me. &quot; So Brown went looking_for a bolero in a haystack , riffling through movie still after movie still , costume-test photo after costume-test photo , hoping to catch_a_glimpse of the tantalizing jacket . Then , there it was , worn by Bette Davis , in what Brown calls &quot; one of her many comebacks &quot; -- the 1964 chiller &quot; Hush Hush . . . Sweet Charlotte. &quot; The movie was nominated for an Oscar for costume design . Women ' s costumes are almost always easier to identify than men ' s , Brown says . &quot; Men ' s contemporary clothing is one of the hardest things to do documentation and research on. &quot; The reason : &quot; A black mohair suit is a black mohair suit. &quot; Where and When What : Auction of costumes from the Western Costume &quot; Star Collection. &quot; Location : Butterfield &amp; Butterfield , 7601 Sunset Blvd. , Los Angeles . Time : 1 p.m. Sunday . The items will be_on display from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. today and Saturday and 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sunday . Call : ( 213 ) 850-7500 .</TEXT>
