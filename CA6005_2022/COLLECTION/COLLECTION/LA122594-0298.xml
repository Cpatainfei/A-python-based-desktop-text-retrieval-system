   <HEADLINE> 1994 : YEAR IN REVIEW ; DOWN AND OUT IN H ' WOOD ; ' 94 WAS A LOW POINT , SAY TWO MOVIE FANS WHO ARE ALREADY LOOKING AHEAD TO ' 95 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In considering the year in movies , the word disappointing springs quickly to mind . But why ? Is it that it ' s impossible to impress an audience in the afterglow of a season of cinema that reached_a_peak with notable efforts like &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; and &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; ? Or was this year , with a_few exceptions , simply riddled with bombs and stinkers ? Then again , perhaps 1994 offered some pretty good movies , but we forget because it also produced &quot; Bad Girls. &quot; Movie commentators Kalle Matso and Scott White give a fresh perspective on the year . * Kalle Matso : I ' ll tell you why I think 1994 was a bad year for American movies . The most provocative films -- &quot; Reality Bites , &quot; &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; and &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; -- all struck me as lacking any spirit , notwithstanding an intense love of TV and death . And , unlike in 1993 , the movies that were made just to &quot; pack a wallop &quot; were not good_enough to spawn their own line of action figures . Although some might not concur with me , I ' d bet nine out of 10 people will agree that 1994 was a cinematic downer . Scott White : First of all , I think you ' re giving the American moviegoing public an overly fair shake . I think if you ask 10 people about 1994 , seven of them will yell , &quot; Yabba-dabba-doo ! &quot; Commercially , this was the most successful year for movies ever . Matso : Well , there are other factors involved with that statistic : the economy , for example . White : I don ' t think that makes such a difference . It ' s not like people check the Dow Jones industrial average before buying tickets for &quot; Terminal Velocity. &quot; Matso : Well , what was your second point ? White : My second point is that many of us don ' t care about any spiritual emptiness in cinema . The only reason we ' re down on 1994 is because we ' ve seen about five goodAmerican movies and 50 that made us want to learn a foreign language . Matso : Give me some examples . White : &quot; Beverly Hills Cop III , &quot; &quot; My Girl 2 , &quot; &quot; Major_League II , &quot; &quot; D2 : The Mighty Ducks , &quot; &quot; City_Slickers II , &quot; &quot; Death Wish V. &quot; 1994 could have been called &quot; Derivative X : This Time It ' s My Brother. &quot; Matso : Granted . White : And another very important criterion for me is the quality of the middle-echelon movies : those that weren ' t preceded by eight months of hype . Matso : In other words , how many times did we walk into a theater on a wing and a prayer and end_up the loser ? White : Right , and the answer_for this year is &quot; usually. &quot; I give you &quot; Intersection , &quot; &quot; The Getaway , &quot; &quot; Clean_Slate , &quot; &quot; The Chase , &quot; &quot; Greedy , &quot; &quot; Lightning Jack , &quot; &quot; The Shadow , &quot; &quot; Cops and Robbersons , &quot; &quot; The Cowboy Way , &quot; &quot; Little Big League , &quot; &quot; I Love Trouble , &quot; &quot; The River Wild , &quot; &quot; Even Cowgirls Get the Blues , &quot; &quot; A Simple Twist of Fate , &quot; &quot; Color of Night , &quot; &quot; Airheads , &quot; &quot; Exit to Eden &quot; . . . Matso : You could have bought a Geo Prizm with all_the dough you wasted on mediocre films . White : Exactly . And I don ' t need to spend money to waste two hours of my life . I get a much better bargain at_home watching Nickelodeon . Matso : So why do we get suckered into seeing these movies ? White : I think it ' s the increase in marketing acumen . It seems that the worse the movies are , the better the publicity becomes . It all started_out with &quot; Batman , &quot; a mediocre realization of the story ' s potential . But that didn ' t stop me from getting whipped into a consumer frenzy . Matso : I know what you mean . I bought a cowl . White : Of course you did . The public-relations wizards know we ' re hooked . we ' ll keep seeing the hot release , Friday after Friday , lack of ethics in cinema notwithstanding . Many of the releases in 1994 just didn ' t happen to be so hot , that ' s all . Matso : Every year has bad films , and one year even had &quot; Orca. &quot; It just gets especially annoying when the good movies are few and far between . I mean , it would be pretty tough to put_together a respectable list of best picture Oscar nominees ; you ' ve got &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; for one . &quot; Quiz Show , &quot; &quot; Shawshank Redemption &quot; and &quot; The Lion King &quot; were all pretty good . White : &quot; Pretty good. &quot; Hardly_a ringing endorsement . Matso : Your point being ? White : In almost every genre , this year was a letdown . Last year the big-action flick was &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; which was justifiably nominated for best picture . Though they were decent movies , can you see nominating &quot; True Lies &quot; or &quot; Speed &quot; ? That would be like giving an Oscar to &quot; Octopussy. &quot; Matso : I have to admit the tale of the tape isn ' t too encouraging for 1994 . &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; versus &quot; Little Buddha. &quot; &quot; Philadelphia &quot; versus &quot; Natural Born Killers. &quot; &quot; The Piano &quot; versus &quot; Andre. &quot; White : And the people that we can usually count_on to redeem the year offered us precious little . Rob Reiner gave us &quot; North. &quot; Kenneth Branagh , &quot; Mary Shelley ' s Frankenstein. &quot; The Coen Brothers , &quot; The Hudsucker Proxy. &quot; Oliver Stone , &quot; Natural Born Killers. &quot; Matso : In my opinion , Oliver Stone owes Quentin Tarantino a case of his favorite beer for ruining a good_story idea . White : I ' m not finished . Tim Burton , &quot; Ed Wood. &quot; Barry Levinson , &quot; Jimmy Hollywood. &quot; George Lucas , &quot; The Radioland Murders. &quot; And Mr. Miyagi , &quot; The Next Karate Kid. &quot; Matso : You ' re right . Maybe the best thing about the year were those dark-horse movies that took the analysts completely by surprise . White : Examples ? Matso : &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective &quot; and &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral &quot; both made_it to the screen completely unheralded , both were very entertaining and both cleaned_up at the box_office . White : Sure , and there ' s a reason for optimism . Perhaps , with the success of independent films , Hollywood will be more receptive to throwing some cash at new and more creative talent . Then again , perhaps Jerry Reed will make &quot; Smokey and the Bandit IV. &quot; Matso : The problem is that people in Hollywood have a penchant for misinterpreting the trends . They ' ll cross-reference &quot; Four Weddings &quot; with &quot; Ace Ventura &quot; and buy scripts on comedians who demand prenuptial agreements . Besides , those weren ' t the best movies of the year -- just the biggest surprises . White : For me , the best movies of the year were &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; and &quot; Forrest Gump. &quot; Matso : This is another problem . &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; is_on my top five list too and yet I ' m not convinced it was that great . It was a feel-good movie and Tom Hanks gave an incredible performance -- there ' s an excellent chance he ' ll be offering another lecture at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion this year -- but I thought the movie had real flaws . White : Like what ? Matso : First of all , they went way too far with the technical razzmatazz . Every time Gump met a past celebrity with a badly superimposed mouth , it was about as impressive as shadow puppets . White : Then I guess the most notable aspect of the year in film was the arrival of Tarantino and &quot; Pulp Fiction. &quot; Matso : . . . which , as I alluded to earlier , created a lot of mixed feelings in most theaters . White : What are you talking_about ? &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; was an incredible movie . Matso : Hey , I agree . I ' ve never seen anyone tightrope between nail-biting tension and hilarious satire the way Tarantino does . White : I sense a &quot; but &quot; coming . Matso : But at_the_same_time , I walked_out_of &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; really depressed . White : Why ? Did you empathize with The Gimp ? Matso : No . I mean , it ' s one thing if someone like Tupac Shakur makes a living composing violent raps . He comes from a violent world . This is not a guy you expect to do Peter , Paul and Mary songs . But where does Quentin Tarantino ' s violence come from ? Quentin worked in Manhattan Beach renting videos to no-life kids like you and me . What ' s he drawing_on -- the time we toilet-papered the store ? White : So what are you saying , only John Gotti can make bloody movies ? Matso : No . I ' m just saying the violence is a little easier to take when you know the writer ' s representing experiences and not just conjuring_up a lot of pain for entertainment ' s sake . White : It ' s like you ' re saying violence is sacred . &quot; How dare he make a violent movie ? He ' s never killed anybody. &quot; Matso : But Tarantino treats violence so lightly . I mean , no one in that movie was good or bad . They were all just cool , which makes_it seem totally acceptable to blow people away . White : It ' s supposed to be chilling . I can understand your being disturbed by the film , but I don ' t think you can criticize Tarantino . that ' s the nature of the gangster game . The story would have been very disjointed if , after every hit , John Travolta asked Samuel Jackson to just hold him . Matso : You ' re missing the point . Look_at the most talked-about movies of the year : &quot; Reality Bites , &quot; &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral , &quot; &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; and &quot; Pulp Fiction. &quot; Translation : a movie about people without values , people who go_to weddings but don ' t get_married , people who love to kill , and people who don ' t love to kill but don ' t have a huge problem with it either . White : Why have you suddenly decided to omit entertaining and feel-good movies like &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; and &quot; The Lion King &quot; ? Matso : They were fun and I ' m happy they got made , but it ' s not like those movies are going_to leave a deep imprint on the American psyche , unless you are really in the dark about how vicious hyenas can be . White : So let me get this straight . You ' re disappointed with the year because entertaining movies were too simple and the edgy , benchmark &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; was too disturbing . Matso : that ' s right . And don ' t be so incredulous . You were as disappointed as I was . White : But in a different way . I just want more -- more &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; more &quot; Quiz Show , &quot; more &quot; Forrest Gump. &quot; You want something deeper . You have to either take_up audio books or move to a country that meets your spiritual standards . Me , I just have to wait till 1995 and all those hot new releases .</TEXT>
