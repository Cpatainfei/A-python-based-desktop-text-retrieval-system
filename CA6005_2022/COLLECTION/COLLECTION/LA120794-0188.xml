   <HEADLINE> O.C. FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY ; BIGGEST-EVER CHAPTER 9 ROILS FINANCIAL MARKETS ; CRISIS : SUPERVISORS ACT AFTER WALL_STREET INVESTORS DEMAND $ 1.2-BILLION LOAN REPAYMENT . COUNTY SAYS BASIC SERVICES ARE SAFE BUT MAJOR PROJECTS ARE IN JEOPARDY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County became the largest municipality in U.S. history Tuesday to file for federal bankruptcy protection , after an all-day standoff with Wall_Street investors who insisted the county repay $ 1.2 billion in loans to its troubled investment pool . The stunning news that one of the nation ' s largest , wealthiest and most politically conservative counties was seeking protection from its creditors capped a day of turmoil that shook not just Orange County but the country ' s financial markets . Somber county officials insisted that the filing -- made at 5:01 p.m. Tuesday , an hour after the Santa Ana federal bankruptcy court ' s normal closing time -- would have no effect on the county ' s ability to maintain police protection , the county payroll and other basic services . But the move raised questions about the funding of dozens of major projects in the county , from toll roads to a Disneyland expansion to a possible new stadium for the Los Angeles Rams and California Angels . And it could cost the county its stellar bond_rating , meaning it could become more expensive to borrow for public needs -- if the county and other local_government agencies are allowed to issue debt at all . One rating agency said it would drop Orange County ' s rating today from double-A to triple-C -- meaning its bonds are viewed_as in danger of default . &quot; We took this action on behalf of the county and other investors so that the current financial situation can be resolved in an orderly fashion , &quot; said Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F . Riley , adding that the move will help the county restructure its debts and ward_off claims . The bankruptcy means that the county ' s investment pool -- which includes the savings of 185 cities , school districts and other agencies -- is frozen and restricted from withdrawals . It is unclear which debts the county will pay . State Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) called the bankruptcy a &quot; difficult pill to swallow. &quot; &quot; It ' s a shocking occurrence , &quot; said Bergeson , who will join the board in January . &quot; We ' re going to have to look_to Sacramento , to Washington , and obviously we ' re going to have to look_to ourselves. &quot; Supervisors were roused from their beds at 3 a.m. with news of an impending financial catastrophe . They spent virtually all day behind closed doors meeting with their money advisers and attorneys to sort through the dilemma , made more drastic by investors ' demands that the county come_up with $ 1.2 billion in cash or securities that had come due Tuesday . On Monday , county officials , through a private firm , had tried to liquidate the beleaguered investment pool ' s huge holding of derivatives -- complex financial instruments that magnified the fund ' s exposure to rising interest_rates . A senior executive at one of the four biggest Wall_Street firms , who declined to be identified , said the bankruptcy was made inevitable after Orange County began approaching various firms , but all turned the county down . The firms rejected taking_on such a monumental task , the source said , partly because they found that the fund ' s losses on the derivatives were much larger than the $ 1.5 billion that has been publicly reported . The source declined to give a specific figure , but said his firm concluded that it ' s &quot; hundreds of millions &quot; more_than that , although not double the amount . &quot; They approached a number of people on the Street , including us , to liquidate the portfolio for them , &quot; the executive said . &quot; But no one wanted to trade with them . The people who looked_at it ( the portfolio ) were frightened by it. &quot; By Tuesday , county supervisors and administrators were more nervous , placing calls to state and federal_officials in search of financial help , such_as low-interest loans to help resolve its cash crisis . No assistance came , but one supervisor said the county has received an outpouring of genuine concern . &quot; We talked to a whole_lot of people today . . . congressmen and senators and the governor . . . everybody else we could get ahold of , to ensure -- absolutely ensure -- that every avenue of legal relief was available to us , &quot; Riley said . It was clear by late Tuesday that the county had to file for bankruptcy , despite the embarrassment it would bring , officials said . &quot; There was no alternative given to us , &quot; said Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder . &quot; We were concerned with the fact that we are here to protect the public and to protect the investors. &quot; But investment_bankers still wanted repayment of their loans and the county had no other choice . The county defaulted_on 10 to 12 loans Tuesday . &quot; Everybody walked , &quot; Wieder said . &quot; The bond dealers -- they walked. &quot; Supervisor William G . Steiner expressed some bitterness over the demands of the investment_bankers -- the same people that former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron has done business with for so_long . Citron resigned Monday after 24 years on_the_job . &quot; We ' ve had a steady parade of hot shots in blue suits representing the investment_bankers pitching these sophisticated investment strategies and the treasurer obviously went_down that path , &quot; Steiner said . The supervisor said he had two conversations with Gov . Pete Wilson to ask_for help , including advancing state funds due the county early to provide liquidity to the county fund . &quot; I ' m used to dealing with dysfunction , &quot; said Steiner , the former director of the Orangewood Home for abused and neglected children . &quot; But never anything of this magnitude. &quot; Filing under Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code is a desperate last step for any public entity , because the stigma attached_to such a move can lead to a bad credit rating and make_it difficult , if not impossible , to borrow for public projects , legal and financial experts said . &quot; It ' s rare , it ' s quite rare . . . for any government to take that step -- and unprecedented for a county of that size , &quot; said Bennett Murphy , a bankruptcy expert and partner in the law_firm of Latham &amp; Watkins . &quot; It ' s seldom used , and I ' d say that it ' s quite unusual. &quot; Murphy said Chapter 9 functions much like Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code for businesses -- it provides a government with protection from its creditors while it attempts to work_out a plan for rehabilitating its finances . &quot; Drastic financial distress -- it ' s there for that purpose , &quot; Murphy said . Faced with criticism from federal regulators that state officials have failed to step_in swiftly to help , Gov . Wilson issued a terse , one-sentence statement through his press office . &quot; We will assist Orange County in analyzing the situation to identify the alternatives necessary so that Orange County can bring its finances back into solvency , &quot; Wilson said . Meanwhile , a spokesman for the state_Department of Finance said officials there were gathering information in hopes of developing a strategy to help the county find a way_out of the calamity . &quot; Job One is to get a complete picture of what the situation is , &quot; said spokesman H.D. Palmer . &quot; What we ' ll do depends_on what we find_out . I would n ' t want to prejudge any of that. &quot; The rumors of a bankruptcy filing spread from Wall_Street to Washington to California through the day . Rep . Christopher Cox ( R-Newport Beach ) had been the first to appear on television hinting at a bankruptcy filing . Cox , a former securities lawyer , said he had been in contact with county officials as the financial crisis exploded and will hold hearings to sort_out what happened and find ways to prevent such catastrophes in the future . The bankruptcy filing apparently was triggered when CS First Boston Corp. , one of several large brokerages that has lent the county money to purchase securities , demanded additional collateral for its loans on Tuesday after the county failed to make a payment . When the county was unable to put_up the cash demanded , CS First Boston seized $ 2 billion of the county ' s securities that had been held as collateral for the loans , according to Wall_Street traders familiar_with the situation . The brokerage_firm then placed those securities , mostly U.S._government agency bonds , on the bond market near the close of trading Tuesday , a move that stunned traders , dealers said . CS First Boston officials would not comment on their relationship with the county or on any actions the brokerage might have taken_on Tuesday . Meanwhile , the brokerage with the closest relationship to the county -- Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . -- said it had not asked_for additional collateral and had no plans to cut_off credit to the county . Richard G . Paget , managing director and head of the municipal_bond department at Baltimore-based Alex . Brown &amp; Sons , said rumors of a bankruptcy by the county had been circulating all day . He said bond holders had been trying to sell_off their positions , but couldn ' t because there were no buyers . He said the situation &quot; reminded me of the run_on banks in the 1930s , &quot; when everyone tried to get their money out at_the_same_time . &quot; The situation was simple , &quot; Paget said . &quot; People wanted their money out and couldn ' t get it. &quot; Paget said Alex . Brown received a report Tuesday morning from financial advisers that up_to 180 of the bond issuers with investments in the Orange County fund were having financial problems and might be in danger of default . As a result of the rumors and reports , municipal_bond desks across the country were having extreme difficulty assigning prices to bonds . &quot; It was pretty much confusion and pandemonium as far as credit analysis is concerned , &quot; Paget said . Paget said the bankruptcy declaration was analogous to the federal bank_holiday declared by President Franklin D . Roosevelt during the Depression , which halted the run_on banks . &quot; What this does is buy the county time to sort this out. &quot; Peer Swan , chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District -- which had threatened to pull its remaining $ 300-million investment out of the pool -- learned of the county ' s worsening troubles early Tuesday . &quot; This is high-stakes poker , &quot; Swan said . &quot; I can understand from an investment_firm ' s perspective that this is a bad situation and they have shareholders who are very concerned . However , investment_firms also have to realize that if they pull the plug , that ' s it . And that ' s a hard pill to swallow. &quot; The state_attorney general ' s office had lawyers &quot; looking all day at the situation , &quot; a spokesman said . Spokesman Dave Puglia said the federal Securities and Exchange Commission , which is investigating the Orange County financial crisis , &quot; has made contact with us , &quot; adding , &quot; we ' re working with them in any way that can be helpful. &quot; But Puglia also said the office was rebuffed by the SEC earlier Tuesday after state_attorneys requested access to all information on the ongoing crisis . The two sides agreed to discuss the dispute further on Wednesday . Puglia said the attorney_general ' s office has been in contact with Orange County , &quot; but we have not been made privy to the discussions or decisions of the board. &quot; Sources said that neither the SEC nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission_plans to take any major action in the near future , except to continue their very active investigations . The SEC had considered seeking a court injunction that would have placed the Orange County fund into receivership . But federal regulators ruled that out , concluding such a step might cause more , rather than less , disruption to the securities markets , sources said . One worry was that a receiver might forbid securities firms from selling any of the collateral they hold , which could cause serious disruption in the market . Some of the same ill effects , however , might happen amid bankruptcy proceedings , in which a bankruptcy judge may issue orders about the handling of securities and collateral . In addition , federal regulators were said to be concerned that there might be a political backlash if Washington stepped_in to seize control of the Orange County fund . Federal regulators , however , were concerned and surprised that no one on the state level had moved to take_control of the situation . Some regulators said privately that anxiety on Wall_Street and among investors in municipal_bonds might have been assuaged if Wilson or state Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren had found a way to take_charge and begin issuing directives to sort_out the tangled mess . Mary Shapiro , chairwoman of the CFTC , and William R . McLucas , director of the SEC ' s enforcement division , declined to comment on the situation . Two of the largest investors in the fund said the bankruptcy could have a serious effect on them . Stan Oftelie , chief_executive of the Orange County Transportation Authority , said his agency would be stuck financially if its $ 1 billion in the county ' s fund was frozen for a long period_of_time . &quot; We ' ve taken steps today to make_sure we ' re OK until the end of the year , &quot; Oftelie said . &quot; But after that I don ' t know how long we could last. &quot; He said the agency is counting_on that money next to meet payroll demands . Anaheim City_Manager James D . Ruth , referring to the Disney and stadium projects , said : &quot; We will be looking_at all major projects in the city , including all capital improvement projects , to see if we ' re going to freeze them , &quot; putting them on hold until the crisis passes . Across Orange County , the bankruptcy drew mixed reaction from the cities and other agencies that relied_on the county to invest its money over the years . &quot; We ' re encouraged by ( the bankruptcy filing. ) We think that means the county is taking_control and protecting its assets , &quot; said Tim O ' Donnell , Brea ' s assistant city_manager . &quot; I think ( the filing ) was a wise move_on the county ' s part , &quot; said Seal Beach Mayor George Brown . &quot; A lot of towns were ready to draw their money out. &quot; Others were angry and wondered why the Board of Supervisors weren ' t keeping a closer watch on the county ' s money . ' I think some of our supervisors really should think_about resigning , except for the ones who were just elected , &quot; Santa Ana City Councilman Ted R . Moreno said . &quot; They should all be fired . Citron might be an elected official and treasurer but it was their responsibility as county supervisors to keep_an_eye_on what was happening to the money. &quot; &quot; This is one of the most shattering experiences that any of us in local_government will ever face , &quot; said Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly .

D1 County Seeks Protection In a move that could have severe repercussions , the county Tuesday sought protection under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code . The step , which is expected to result in a lower credit rating for the county , may lead to a host of cost-cutting measures . WHAT IS CHAPTER 9 ? Only a municipality , such_as Orange County , may file for this type of bankruptcy . Chapter 9 buys_time for cities , school districts or other governmental agencies to work_out ways to pay their debts . WHY ORANGE COUNTY FILED &quot; There was no alternative given to us . We were concerned with the fact that we are here to protect the public and to protect the investors . And , of course , the county itself is 37 % of this fund . Then , everybody walked . The bond dealers -- they walked. &quot; -- Harriett M . Wieder , county supervisor WHAT IT MEANS The filing could affect about 185 municipalities , school districts and other governmental entities that have invested billions of dollars in the county investment fund . All of them use their investments to raise money to meet their obligations , such_as new construction , day-to-day services or loan payments . They also might not be able to borrow more money . County Fund Investors About 185 government agencies--schools , cities and special districts--have money in the Orange County investment fund . Money designated as being in the &quot; bond pool &quot; is kept separate because it is governed by specific rules regarding a trading practice known as arbitrage , an effort to profit by borrowing at one interest_rate and investing at a higher one . Here is a partial list of investments as of Nov . 30 . It does not include about $ 550 million borrowed by school districts and some individual investors : 03 # 38 , 19 # 19 Agency Commingled Pool Bond Pool County of Orange $ 2 # 555 , 620 # 144.87 $ 204 # 859 , 991.48 Transportation Corridor Agencies 45 # 469 , 591.93 296 # 294 , 198.03 O.C.
