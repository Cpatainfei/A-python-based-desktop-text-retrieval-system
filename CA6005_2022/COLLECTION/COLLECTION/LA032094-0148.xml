   <HEADLINE> CRUISE VIEWS : BEST OF THE BEST IN THE CARIBBEAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Each of the nearly 100 cruise_ships sailing in the Caribbean has its own special way of showing_off the islands -- from beach days at private islands to shore excursions with helicopters , scuba_diving or submarines . Here are some of the best ways to see the Caribbean . Best whole family experience : American Family Cruises ' American Adventure and its two-day Dominican_Republic stopover at Casa de Campo resort , where kids have their own shore excursions -- from horseback riding to donkey polo , baseball to snorkeling . Parents , in the meantime , can tackle the Pete Dye &quot; Teeth of the Dog &quot; golf_course . Best private island beach day : Royal Caribbean Cruise Line ' s Coco Cay in the Berry Islands of the Bahamas , with a day of exploration and water_sports on every cruise -- snorkeling with underwater cameras , diving , rides_on watercycles , rocket rafts and pedal boats , underwater caves and nature trails to explore , native straw markets for shopping , steel_drum bands and a lavish barbecue buffet for lunch . Most elegant beach barbecue : Cunard ' s Sea Goddess I sends waiters in white mess_jackets and swim trunks to serve passengers chilled champagne and caviar while they sunbathe or wade in the surf at Jost van Dyke in the_British Virgin Islands , followed by a grilled lunch of fresh Caribbean lobster , steaks , even plebeian hot dogs and hamburgers . * Most photogenic port : Panama ' s San Blas Islands , where Cuna Indian women clad in bright red applique molas and gold nose-rings pose for pictures for a fixed fee per click . Get there aboard American Canadian Caribbean Cruises ' Mayan Prince ; Clipper Cruises ' Yorktown Clipper ; Holland America ' s Maasdam , Noordam and Westerdam on April repositioning cruises to Alaska ; Princess Cruises ' Crown_Princess on an April repositioning cruise ; Royal Cruise Line ' s Golden Odyssey , and Special Expeditions ' Polaris . Best onboard entertainment : The stylish and handsome Ballet Folklorique of Martinique , who come aboard to perform on many cruise_ships calling_at Fort-de-France . Most elegant adventure : Sail the distinctive four-masted sailing yacht Sea Cloud and spend days doing Special Expeditions ' diligent shore excursions in search of rare flora and fauna . Once owned by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post , the Sea Cloud maintains its 1930s ambience , complete with marble fireplaces ( non-working ) and gold bath faucets in the grandest suites . Best fantasy beach : The Baths at Virgin Gorda , where passengers may arrive by bow-landing tender , rubberized landing_craft or overland by bus , then swim in the grottoes among the boulders , snorkel offshore or explore the trails around the beach . Most casual cruise : Aboard Windjammer Barefoot Cruises ' tall ships , you can spend your entire cruise barefoot if you like , even opting to sleep on deck under the stars . Certain sailings during the winter are targeted for singles only , and promise an equal number of males and females on board . Biggest sand-and-sea casino combination : If your arm and cash hold_up , you could play all 212 slot_machines , 22 blackjack tables , four roulette and four dice tables on Carnival ' s dazzling Fantasy or Ecstasy en route to Nassau , then take a shuttle shoreside to Carnival ' s 30 # 000-square-foot casino at the Crystal Palace , which adds baccarat to the 750 slots , 51 blackjack tables , seven craps tables and nine roulette_wheels . * Most riveting sightseeing : Passengers line the rails for Panama_Canal transits as guest lecturers tell the story of the building and operation of the canal . Lines that transit the canal frequently during the year include American Canadian Caribbean , Clipper , Cunard Crown , Cunard , Crystal , Holland America , Princess , Royal Caribbean , Royal , Seabourn and Special Expeditions . To go partway into the canal and back into the Caribbean on a shorter , less expensive sailing , check Regency Cruises or Dolphin Cruise Line . Best island-spotting : Two swivel telescopes are bolted to the handsome teak decks aboard the Club Med I for spotting distant islands or identifying ships that pass in the night ( or day ) . Best floating history exhibit : The arts and antiques aboard any Holland America ship , which tell the story of the Dutch West_Indian Co . and early explorers from the_Netherlands through the use of ancient maps , compasses and cannon rescued from watery graves . Best sailings with cartoon characters : Walt Disney characters depart Premier ' s Big Red Boats at the end of March , to be replaced by Bugs Bunny , Daffy Duck and other Looney Tunes characters from Warner Bros . Other good bets : Norwegian Cruise Line ' s Universal theme sailings ( Woody Woodpecker , Andy Panda ) or Dolphin / Majestic ' s Hanna Barbera cruises with Fred Flintstone , Yogi Bear and the Jetsons aboard . Best wildlife sightings : Special Expeditions ' Polaris takes passengers in motorized rubber landing_craft in search of red-footed boobies and black howler_monkeys in Belize ; green_turtles and three-toed_sloths in Costa Rica , and toucans and parrots in Honduras . Best swimming_pool : It happens when the posh Seabourn Pride anchors and lowers its big steel-mesh collapsible pool into the sea , then unfolds the teak decking around for sunbathers . Busiest port : Hands_down , no contest , it ' s Charlotte Amalie in St . Thomas , U.S. Virgin Islands . The port greets four to six cruise_ships a day in winter season , with midweek traffic heaviest and Sundays ( when shops are closed ) quietest . Four vessels are usually tied_up at the West_Indian Dock main port , two others at Crown Bay , and the Norway on Wednesdays is always anchored out_in the bay . Rarest ports_of_call : If you want to avoid cruise_ship passengers altogether , your best bets are the following islands , where ships rarely , if ever , call : Anguilla , Saba , Barbuda , Montserrat , Nevis , Marie-Galante and Canouan .</TEXT>
