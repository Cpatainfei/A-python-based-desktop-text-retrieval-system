   <HEADLINE> ALL PRESIDENCIES ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL ; HAITI : WITH THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION , RETURNING ARISTIDE TO POWER MAY PROVE FUTILE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Restoring Jean-Bertrand Aristide to office in Haiti is not the same as restoring him to power . There is no evidence , however , that U.S. policy-makers are aware of the distinction , or how it affects the prospects for establishing stable democracy in Haiti . We have a tendency to assume that presidencies all_over are more or less the same -- that all are endowed with substantial authority . In fact , the constitutional powers of presidents vary enormously . Many wield far greater formal powers than U.S. presidents , and some , Haiti ' s included , have virtually no political authority . Haiti ' s president does not control the composition of the executive_branch . He does not name the members of the cabinet and cannot dismiss them . This authority is given to Parliament . The Haitian president , moreover , has no formal lawmaking authority . He does not exercise a veto , nor does he have any authority to issue legislative decrees or executive orders . This is all_the domain of a prime_minister and cabinet who answer to the legislature , not to the president . The sole source of power for a Haitian president comes from being the only government official elected by a nationwide constituency . This should give the president a say in national policy-making , but without any formal authority , the choice can come_down to pursuing an agenda by unconstitutional means or not at all . This was precisely what happened in September , 1991 , when a congressional majority tried to dismiss Aristide ' s choice for prime_minister . The Haitian military justified removing Aristide on the grounds that the president was inciting demonstrations to intimidate lawmakers from exercising their constitutional authority to choose the government . The point is not whether Aristide or the military was more to blame for the breakdown of democracy three years ago . It is that a constitution providing_for a popularly elected president , but giving that president no formal authority , is logically inconsistent , and could easily reproduce crises that threaten the stability of democracy . There are other stable democracies with elected , but largely powerless , presidents . A few European parliamentary systems allow_for the popular election of presidents who serve effectively as ceremonial heads_of_state . Ireland , Iceland and Austria are examples . In these cases , however , the institution of a government responsible to parliament was established well before the elected presidency . Ceremonial presidents were introduced in the European cases to replace ceremonial monarchs as heads_of_state , without altering the basic form_of_government . There were no political expectations attached_to the idea of a presidential mandate . The opposite was true in Haiti when Aristide was elected in 1990 . Without any tradition of parliamentary supremacy -- or any tradition of stable democratic institutions of any sort -- Aristide supporters were understandably frustrated by the inability of their champion to control policy through formal channels . What ' s more , the pending agreement , which centers_on Aristide ' s return to office , only reinforces the disjuncture between expectations and likely results . Aristide , arriving with an escort of 15 # 000 U.S. troops and an eventual multinational peacekeeping force , will certainly encounter citizens who expect action and results from the president , whether they support or oppose him . All of this brings us to the goal of the U.S. mission in Haiti . Does_it involve &quot; fixing &quot; the Haitian constitution , to bring powers of the president in_line with the expectations surrounding the office ? The Clinton_Administration has given no hint that such a plan exists , or even that it is aware of Aristide ' s powerlessness . Indeed , the Administration is adamant that its purpose is not to build a nation , but rather to simply restore stability and a constitutional government . The problem is that stability and the current constitution might be fundamentally incompatible . In addition to its litany of other problems , Haiti has a bad constitution . In restoring it as it stands , we may be regenerating a cycle of political instability .</TEXT>
