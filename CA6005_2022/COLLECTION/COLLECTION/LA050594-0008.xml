   <HEADLINE> WINE : DAYS OF FUTURES PAST ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The futures market in fine Bordeaux_wines -- a symbol of frenzied wine collecting for the last decade -- has all but collapsed . Buying wine futures is a tactic of wine collectors who pay a discounted price for wines well in_advance of delivery to assure themselves of getting wines that will be difficult to find at a reasonable price later on , if at all . But the combination of two poor vintages in a row ( 1991 and 1992 ) ; too many great vintages of the recent past ( 1985 , 1986 , 1988 , 1989 and 1990 ) ; a weak U.S. economy , and the collapse of the complicated system of handshake agreements that supports futures deals have left consumers too wary to plunk_down a dime even for wines with a stellar reputation . One Los Angeles wine_merchant summed it up this way : &quot; Everybody is loaded with ' 88s , ' 89s and ' 90s , so there ' s no need to buy the vintage . And you ' re dealing in a weak vintage . Plus there is a lot of skepticism with the whole idea of futures because of what happened last year. &quot; * What happened last year is_best exemplified by the experience of Los Angeles wine collector Tom Pirko , who in 1991 sent_off a check for $ 3 # 000 to buy a number of top Bordeaux_wines from 1990 , a vintage that was rumored to be one of the best of the century . He didn ' t expect to get the wines until 1993 , but he didn ' t mind paying_up front because he was getting a lower price than he ' d pay when the wines were released . This time , though , the system didn ' t work . When Pirko asked Calvert Woodley Discount Wines and Liquors in Washington about his order , they told him they couldn ' t get the wine as expected from a Detroit-area supplier , and efforts to find it elsewhere at a fair price fizzled . Pirko wasn ' t alone . Oakland-based fine-wine merchant Premier Cru said they lost $ 250 # 000 when wine ordered from Cloverleaf Market of Southfield , Mich. , never arrived . And hundreds of others were stung by 1993 collapses in the wine futures business . One Los Angeles wine collector said he lost thousands of dollars in the bankruptcy of a London wine_merchant . Another London futures dealer closed after failing to deliver wines . Many retailers who wound_up with shortfalls absorbed losses as they tried to compensate consumers . Pirko , for example , was offered other wines by Calvert Woodley . But some buyers simply lost money . * The failure of the futures system , though not front-page news , nevertheless caused reverberations among U.S. wine_lovers . It showed the futures system to be little more_than a &quot; chain of faith &quot; that fails if a single link breaks . Barney Rhodes , a Napa Valley wine collector and one of the first U.S. futures dealers , says futures began in the mid-1950s , when winemakers in Europe needed cash and wine buyers wanted rare wines at a discount and were willing to pay in_advance . &quot; Back then , a lot of French vineyardists had no cash , and their pickers had to be paid in cash each day , &quot; says Rhodes , who in the early 1960s imported Chateau Lafite-Rothschild . &quot; So some of the negociants ( middlemen who buy bulk wine from growers to sell lots to other wine_merchants ) would get them to sell tonneaux ( 96-case lots ) before the wine was bottled. &quot; As futures sales became more prevalent , consumers grew accustomed to buying before delivery . The negociants ' price led to a price for each wine offered to wholesalers in the United States . These would be passed along to retailers , who could post prices for top Bordeaux . * All buyers put_down a full- or part-payment based on faith that the merchant would deliver their wine . Merchants had faith the wholesalers would deliver , and wholesalers had faith the import companies had the right to buy the amount of wine they took orders for . &quot; If you pay two years prior to delivery , you always get an excellent price , &quot; noted Los Angeles wine collector Bippin Desai . &quot; The 1990 Bordeaux were paid_up in 1991 and today the price for every 1990 is 30 % to 50 % higher , plus some of them are not available . The 1990 ( Chateau ) Lynch-Bages was about $ 275 ( per case ) then and it ' s at least $ 350 today . The 1990 Margaux was $ 600 to $ 650 ; now it ' s about $ 1 # 000. &quot; But Desai is critical of speculators who tried to sell their wines at a profit soon after they bought them . And , he noted that some speculators lost money when the demand flagged for once high-flying wines . Those who speculated on 1986 Bordeaux are losing money on them , says Desai . And he says today ' s prices for 1988 Bordeaux are now even lower than the futures prices . &quot; Too many people have too_much wine , and this weakens the trade , &quot; he says . * Futures deals are not covered by state or federal laws , says Manny Espinoza of the state Alcohol Beverage Control department , who admits that regulations on futures were considered in the early 1980s . &quot; We were concerned about the potential for fraud , &quot; says Espinoza . &quot; What happens when the person doesn ' t deliver on the goods or goes south with the money ? Basically it ' s people operating_on the honor_system , on faith . But there were no major problems then , &quot; he said , so no laws were enacted . Despite the bad rap the 1991 vintage has gotten ( including the fact that weather was so bad in Pomerol that there was no Chateau Petrus produced during that vintage ) , the wines aren ' t that bad . I tasted the five 1991 First Growth Bordeaux two weeks ago and can say that they are quite good . The wines are lean but classically made , with nice structure . They are quite tart , however , and need time to develop . But they are certainly better than the last poor Bordeaux vintage , 1987 , and considering recent prices for these wines , the $ 50 retail price you ' ll pay_for a bottle of Chateau Margaux or a bottle of Chateau Latour seems a fair price . * Reports_out of Bordeaux say the rainy weather that hurt the vines in 1991 did far less damage in the Saint-Estephe commune , and that these wines fared better than those of other areas . Incidentally , 1992 was also a poor vintage in Bordeaux -- so poor that Alexander de Lur-Saluces says he scrapped his entire production of the classic dessert_wine Chateau d ' Yquem , the top-rated Sauternes . There is also no futures market for any 1992 Bordeaux , according to merchants . There are early indications that futures trading isn ' t quite dead , though , despite the turmoil of ' 93 . Sources say the first offering of 1993 red_Bordeaux , which is still in the barrel , sold_out quickly and at prices well below those of 1990 , with great interest shown by Belgian and Swiss buyers . However , one of the top U.S. wine retailers , Peter Morrell of Morrell &amp; Co. , is advising customers not to order 1993 Bordeaux futures . Morrell calls ' 93 another poor vintage . &quot; We predict there will neither be great demand nor capital appreciation to be realized from early purchase of the 93s as futures , &quot; he said . Morrell said most 1993 red_Bordeaux are better than 1991s and 1992s , but that they are still astringent and bitter .</TEXT>
