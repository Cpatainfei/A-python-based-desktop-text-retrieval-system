   <HEADLINE> CULTURE ; BRAZILIANS GET A KICK_OUT OF NICKNAMES ; SOCCER PLAYERS , DOORMEN AND PRESIDENTS CRAVE THAT INFORMAL TOUCH . IT ' S A WAY OF LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Where I ' m from , everybody has a nickname , &quot; says Waldimiro Autran Dourado , a lawyer and author from the state of Minas Gerais . His is Waldo . &quot; that ' s true all_over , particularly among working-class people , &quot; agrees Jorge Luiz Nascimento , a 52-year-old former police_officer , now a Rio de Janeiro city administrator . Folks where he works call him Jorge Mamao ( George Papaya ) . How Dourado became Waldo and Nascimento was dubbed Papaya are long stories , but the short of it in Brazil is that almost everyone , from the president to the doorman , is addressed informally , either by the first_name or a nickname . It ' s part of the Brazilian culture , explains anthropologist Everardo Rocha . &quot; We ' re just a much more informal society , and that is particularly true when it comes_to how we call each other , &quot; he says . Like all Brazilian professors , Rocha is called by his first_name by his students , despite his doctoral degree . &quot; Public people like politicians try to keep contact and intimacy with the people who vote for them , &quot; the professor says . &quot; Sometimes , if a politician is very important , people will call him by his whole_name and also by his initial or by a nickname that is given to him as a tenderness. &quot; Americans got a taste of the Brazilian peculiarity during the World Cup . While other players wore their last_names on their jerseys , Brazil ' s team trotted on the field with nicknames and first_names applied to theirs . There was Dunga , for instance , whose moniker means Dopey , one of Snow White ' s seven dwarfs . And Branco , a key scorer as the Brazilian team moved to victory in Pasadena last month . His nickname means Whitey . Some of the players were known by diminutives : Bebeto for Roberto and Jorginho , or Little George . And Muller , for which there seems no explanation . Probably nowhere is the relaxed , informal manner in which Brazilians address each other more apparent than the way they refer to their leaders . Every day , newspapers and television newscasts refer to the president , many Cabinet members and legislators by their first_names . Others are routinely quoted using their nicknames . It ' s kind of like picking_up a U.S. newspaper to read &quot; Bill Considers Military Invasion of Haiti &quot; or &quot; Dick Negotiates Settlement to Los Angeles Bus Strike. &quot; The same goes_for the field of 10 candidates vying this year for president . One is Fernando Henrique Cardoso , the nation ' s former finance_minister and architect of the country ' s new economic plan . &quot; But nobody calls him Cardoso , &quot; Rocha says . &quot; He ' s Fernando Henrique. &quot; Or he ' s just FHC in headlines and photo captions . Challenging Cardoso is a former factory_worker and labor_leader named Luis Inacio da Silva . But nobody calls him Luis or Inacio or Da Silva . &quot; He ' s Lula to everybody , &quot; says political_scientist Venicio de Lima . Lula is a boyhood nickname that has been Da Silva ' s moniker throughout his professional and personal life . None of this is new in Brazilian politics . The man sworn_in as the country ' s president in 1985 , following two decades of military rule , was Jose Sarney , except that isn ' t really his name , even though heads_of_state , historians and his current colleagues in the Senate still refer to him as Sarney . &quot; His real name is Jose Ribamar , &quot; says the author Dourado , alias Waldo , who has written a number of books on Brazil ' s culture . &quot; His father ' s name was Ney . He worked for a British streetcar company . As a sort of a joke , a manager there used to call his father ' Sir Ney ' and people in the area picked it up , except ' sir ' became ' sar. ' &quot; Sarney is not alone . Take Congressman Chico Vigilante . The Chico is easy , a common nickname for Francisco . But Vigilante ? &quot; His last_name means watchman , but that ' s not his real name , &quot; says political_scientist David Fleischer , a professor at the University of Brasilia . &quot; He took that name when he was running_for office because he used to be head of the watchman and bank_guard union in Brasilia . Nobody around here even knows his real name. &quot; Then there ' s former Congressman Pinga Fogo from Parana . Nobody knows his real name either . His moniker is one he adopted during his radio days when he hosted a popular show that recounted crime stories in gruesome , crusading detail . It means &quot; Dropping fire. &quot; Brazilians without a nickname are almost invariably known chiefly by their first_name . &quot; It ' s not like in the United States where if you ask someone their name , they give you their complete name , &quot; says Rocha , the anthropologist . &quot; Here , we say our first_name and that ' s it. &quot; Consequently , many are the Brazilians who know their neighbors , co-workers , friends -- and even their lovers -- only by their first_name . &quot; I don ' t know the last_names of most of my friends , &quot; says Silvana da Silva , a domestic . &quot; People never say , and you just don ' t ask. &quot; &quot; In Brazil , the family_name is not so important , &quot; says Jorge Antonio Barros , a hulking assistant city_editor at the Jornal do Brasil known around the newsroom as Jorginho . &quot; For emotional reasons , we give more value to people ' s first_names . Even if people have a formal relationship , rather than call someone Mr. Barros , you ' d call him Mr. Jorge. &quot; Brazilians so identify people by their first_names that legislators are listed alphabetically by first_name in the federal directory and the U.S. Consulate keeps two telephone_directories , one alphabetized by last_name and the other by first_name . Rocha conjectures that the more casual approach to names is partly a reflection of a Brazilian sense of cordiality and informality , one derived from the merging of the country ' s Portuguese , African and Native Brazilian heritages . &quot; The Portuguese ( colonialists and slave owners ) were very formal , &quot; he says . &quot; But the way the Portuguese had to deal with the Indians and Africans made them less formal . Now it ' s absolutely incorporated into the Brazilian way of calling people. &quot; Others say that Brazil is simply so overrun_with a_few common names like Da Silva , Dos Santos and Nascimento that people are looking_for an identifiable difference . &quot; If you have Brazilian friends , they are called by their most unusual name , &quot; says De Lima , the political_scientist . &quot; If they are Jose and they have a German middle name and a Portuguese last_name , they almost assuredly will be called by their German middle name. &quot; Nobody , however , seems to know for_sure . Roberto Damata , a top anthropologist , ponders the question and then says : &quot; It ' s an interesting part of our culture that I ' ve often wondered about . But to tell you the truth , I don ' t have the slightest idea. &quot; The preponderance of identification by first_name or nickname does have its drawbacks , as candidate Da Silva discovered in a 1989 campaign . Election laws required that ballots list candidates ' legal names only . Because he was known almost exclusively in the press and among his supporters as Lula , he would surely lose a sizable chunk of his support because voters simply would n ' t recognize him by his last_name . So he had Lula , which means squid , added_to his official name . Not long ago , when the head of the country ' s tax service decided to go_after the incomes of many of the nation ' s highly paid soccer players , he ran_into a similar problem . Nobody in his office knew the players ' real or complete names . In one small city in northeastern Brazil , the local bank has created a town directory correlating people ' s nicknames to their first_names so it can keep track of checks either signed by or written to nicknames . In one of the odder twists of the language , one version of the Volkswagen Beetle , still in production here and officially called a Fusca , is known affectionately as a Fusca Fafa . In the 1980s , Volkswagen changed the car ' s style by adding large , round , protruding taillights . Brazilians quickly dubbed the new version the Fusca Fafa de Belem , shortening it later to Fusca Fafa . It seems the size and shape of the lights reminded many of the ample proportions of Fafa de Belem , a popular singer and sort of the Dolly Parton of Brazil . Thus , Fusca Fafa . The term is so common now , says taxi driver Erison Aguiar , that &quot; if you go_to the auto parts store and ask_for taillights for a Fusca , they will ask you , ' Regular or Fusca Fafa ?
