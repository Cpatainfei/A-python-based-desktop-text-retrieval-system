   <HEADLINE> YES , DIALING FOR DOLLARS IN 900-LAND IS WORTH EVERY LAST NICKEL ; COMMUNICATION : SURE , PAY-PER-MINUTE PHONE_CALLS COST BIG BUCKS . BUT HOW CAN YOU PUT A PRICE ON THE SHARK LINE AND THE PSYCHIC NETWORK ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lupe the psychic was_on the phone from somewhere in Arizona , and her fortunetelling wasn ' t coming cheap : $ 3.99 for each minute we spoke over the LaToya Jackson Psychic Network . Actually , I got Lupe by chance . A recording answered LaToya ' s 900-number : &quot; If you know the extension number of the psychic you ' d like to talk to , press 1. &quot; As a first-time caller , I took pot luck , and pressed 2 . &quot; Hi . Welcome to the LaToya line . This is Lupe . Who ' s this , please ? &quot; &quot; You ' re the psychic , &quot; I said . But sarcasm would n ' t do ; sarcasm wasn ' t cost-effective . &quot; My name ' s Steve , &quot; I said . For the money this 900-number cost , I got_to the point . &quot; I wanna know what the future holds for Michael and Lisa Marie. &quot; I figured if anyone knew the real dope on the Jackson-Presley affair , LaToya would . And she ' d pass the dirt on to her psychics . &quot; OK , Steve , &quot; said Lupe , pronounced Loopy . &quot; For Michael and Lisa Marie , that marriage is not really hanging_in right . I feel that Michael does love her , though. &quot; She had a slightly slurred voice and an accent I couldn ' t place . She sounded bored . I wondered if she , being a psychic , knew I was thinking that . But the meter was running , faster than a taxi slaloming down Manhattan ' s Second Avenue . I pressed_on . &quot; Will they have children ? &quot; &quot; I see two girls. &quot; &quot; Did she marry Michael for the money ? &quot; &quot; No , she ' s got enough money that her father left. &quot; Aha . &quot; Can you see what Elvis is thinking ? &quot; &quot; Elvis is gone. &quot; &quot; Yeah , but maybe his spirit . . . &quot; I don ' t see his spirit , &quot; Lupe said decisively . &quot; What about my future ? &quot; &quot; For your future , Steve , I see good things coming_in your life. &quot; There was the usual psychic stuff : a broken heart , a better future , a large sum_of_money awaiting me , a love interest . &quot; You are in_love with someone right now , &quot; ventured Lupe . &quot; My wife ? &quot; &quot; How long you been together ? &quot; &quot; Ten years. &quot; &quot; I see the relationship between you and her will get stronger . But she needs a little romance in her life. &quot; &quot; We ordered in Italian the other night. &quot; &quot; Wine her and dine her , Steve. &quot; Final cost for my encounter with Lupe : about $ 30 . And no Elvis , even . * Touch-toning through 900-Land is an adventure not unlike a blind_date . First , there ' s the anticipation . Punching up the digits , one awaits the first response , never certain what it will be . Then there ' s the suspense of expense : For a 900-number that charges upward of $ 4 a minute , the cost of a call can easily parallel the price of dinner and a movie . Instead of asking Dad to borrow the car , you ' ve got_to borrow the phone . But while a blind_date can end in hard reality -- or profound relief -- a 900-call almost always aims to please . And you don ' t have to dress_up . Or dress at all . Lupe was my first blind_date in 900-Land . She was more entertaining than the mechanic at 900-AUTO-HELP who diagnosed a rattle under the hood of the car , not nearly as sultry as the suggestive lady-on-tape at 900-HOT-DUCK who described how her &quot; knowing fingers &quot; would &quot; barely graze &quot; my &quot; firm flesh. &quot; And not as mundane as the factoids at_hand on the 900-lines . Via the pay-per-listen lines , I spent upward of $ 300 punching up the current temperatures in Rome ( it was 81 that day , the dew_point 66 ) , learning how to report a lost pet ( &quot; Press 2 to report a lost cat . . . . Enter the tail length : Press 1 for short , 2 for long &quot; ) and checked the closing quote on a stock on the Dow Jones line . But beyond the ordinary , many of the so-called &quot; information providers &quot; who have established 900-phone numbers have refined the art of the gimmick . There ' s the latest lawyer jokes on call , medical updates on an injured funny-car driver via the Quaker State Speedline , and Band-Aids for the psyche on lines like Summit Solutions , a therapy &quot; advice &quot; line for $ 3.99 per minute set_up this year . Establishing a therapist ' s couch on the information superhighway apparently hasn ' t met with great success . The Summit line is currently out_of_service as its sponsors reorganize . In fact , I was unable to connect with three other therapy lines . However , the Culinary Consulting Service did relay to me a lovely recipe for crown_roast of pork with stuffing . * Even after hours of dialing , I ' d just scratched the surface of 900-Land . Unexplored were the personal ads , the fax lines , the job listings and the soap_opera updates . More_than $ 1 billion was collected through 900-phone lines in 1991 , when phone sex and live &quot; chat &quot; lines were driving the industry , before the bottom fell_out in 1992 and revenues were cut_in half . The trashy aura of store-bought sex also dominated the early years of another technology -- the videocassette_recorder -- and the 900-number industry , which has rebounded in the past two years , is hoping for similar validation . With dial-a-porn , now only one segment of the 900-service , other portions of the market are prospering . InfoText magazine estimates billings will again reach $ 1 billion annually by 1998 . Armed with a wealth of digits culled from 900-newsletters , directories and ads from the back pages of Cosmopolitan and the Village Voice , I had mixed success in the 900-ether . Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that the Tonya Harding line , set_up to solicit contributions to pay the ice skater ' s legal_fees stemming from the attack on Nancy Kerrigan , was out of business . So was the John Wayne Gacy line . Gacy , a convicted serial_killer , was executed in May , which probably explains why the number doesn ' t answer . But the Shark Line was_on . After the standard warnings -- it will cost this much , you must be 18 years old , if you hang_up in three seconds you will not be billed -- the recorded lawyer jokes began , at $ 1.49 a minute : &quot; A lawyer was talking to a friend . He said , ' People take an instant dislike to me when they find_out I ' m a lawyer . Why is that ? ' ' It saves time , ' the friend replied. &quot; Next . * I tried the News from Ireland line ; 99 cents per minute . &quot; The IRA said it carried_out this afternoon ' s bomb attack in the Grove Bar . . . . &quot; What I really enjoyed was my chat with Paige . Paige worked for the Info Services Entertainment Line , conducting one-on-ones with men in search of conversational diversion . To be honest , I reached her by accident : I ' d dialed 900-USA-SURF to find how the waves were breaking_in Redondo Beach , but instead got Info Services , where , a sexy voice explained , &quot; All your fantasies can come true. &quot; Paige was one of the &quot; hot choice &quot; fantasies , for $ 3.49 per minute . She was_on the line from Reno , Nev . We made introductions . I spoke tacitly , nervously , and she was drawling . She pronounced &quot; Steve &quot; as if it were four syllables . &quot; How old are you , sweetie ? &quot; she asked . &quot; Ahhhhhh , &quot; I said . &quot; Let ' s talk_about you . How ' d you get this job ? &quot; &quot; Oooohhhh. &quot; Paige , who is 23 , said she answered a newspaper_ad for &quot; telephone actresses. &quot; &quot; I ' m a showgirl at one of the casinos . When I ' m not at the phone I ' m working_at the casino. &quot; &quot; You must love your work. &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; she giggled , &quot; I ' ve only been doing this three months . There are guys out there that are dying of boredom and in desperate need of somebody to talk to . Some are into some really weird stuff. &quot; &quot; What weird stuff ? &quot; I asked . &quot; One guy wanted me to go find balloons , blow them up and pop them. &quot; &quot; Over the phone. &quot; &quot; Yeah . Then there was the guy who wanted me to make sounds like I was starting my car . And my car would n ' t turn_over . Vrooommm , vrooomm . She did a pretty good imitation of a broken starter , and I couldn ' t think_of much more to ask after that , so we said goodby . Paige turned_out to be an expensive call , but she sure beat the News from Ireland .</TEXT>
