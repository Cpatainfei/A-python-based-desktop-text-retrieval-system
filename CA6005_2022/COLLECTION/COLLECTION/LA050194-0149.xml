   <HEADLINE> TREMORS IN GLASS TOWERS ; WITH EXECUTIVES JITTERY , IT MAY BE TIME TO REGULATE ' DERIVATIVES ' TRADING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Over the last three weeks enormously costly blunders by major companies using arcane financial instruments known as derivatives have sent shock_waves through executive suites . What ' s going_on here ? Has Corporate America been too lax in policing these sophisticated and volatile devices ? Clearly it should do more . Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value from another asset , such_as stocks , bonds or commodities . Their purpose is to diminish risk , and to achieve this they offer all sorts of contracts -- &quot; swaps &quot; or &quot; forwards , &quot; to name a couple -- that can be used to hedge against the normal fluctuations in interest_rates , foreign_exchange rates and commodity prices . However , big and sudden changes in interest_rates , for example , can make_for a bad derivative day . Take the case of Procter &amp; Gamble . The company disclosed in mid-April that it had to take a $ 157-million , one-time , pretax charge to close_out two interest_rate &quot; swap &quot; contracts . Betting that U.S. and German interest_rates would fall , the company entered agreements with Bankers Trust New York Corp . to give the bank options to sell P &amp; G Treasury_bonds and German government_bonds at a fixed price in exchange for floating rate debt , akin to variable-rate mortgages . When those interest_rates rose instead , P &amp; G had to close_out the contracts , at a huge loss . In another high-profile case , General Electric was forced to take a $ 210-million after-tax charge against first-quarter earnings because of problems arising from some derivative activity at its investment banking subsidiary , Kidder Peabody . As a result of the loss , Kidder fired the head of its government_bond trading desk , alleging he created &quot; phantom &quot; trades using &quot; forward &quot; contracts that generated $ 350 million in nonexistent profits . Kidder later fired another trader for allegedly covering_up $ 10 million in losses on a separate bond-derivative transaction . These losses have cast a spotlight on the shadowy world of derivatives , which have become widely used by companies , banks , investment_firms and mutual_funds . With the face_value of derivatives currently estimated at $ 15 trillion , the potential risks are daunting . Used with care and intelligence , derivatives provide a means to manage and reduce borrowing costs . But they can be dangerous , especially if they are poorly monitored . Worse yet would be a company ' s secret overuse of derivatives , which are not broken_out on income_statements or balance_sheets . Greater disclosure and accountability would help . The Financial Accounting Standards Board has proposed rules that would require companies to provide details of derivative strategies and the size of such holdings . Disclosure might prevent jolting surprises for management and for the millions of investors , large and small , who deserve to know what ' s going_on .</TEXT>
