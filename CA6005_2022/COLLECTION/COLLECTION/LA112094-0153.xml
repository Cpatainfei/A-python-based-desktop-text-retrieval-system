   <HEADLINE> FOREIGN_POLICY IN THE COLD_WAR ' S WAKE : A WHOLE NEW BALL_GAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For more_than four decades the Cold_War defined U.S. foreign_policy , focusing American national interests and giving_rise to an unprecedented level of international engagement . Without the Cold_War there would have been no global network of military and political alliances , no costly interventions in Korea and Southeast_Asia , no arms race . At home , national security concerns raised by the ideological competition with communism helped mobilize backing for the federal highway_system , the space_program and government subsidies for scientific_research and education . To an extent perhaps still not fully realized , the Cold_War directed the course of much of American history in the second_half of the 20th Century . Now , in its aftermath , a new agenda of global challenges has emerged to test American leadership . Most Americans , willingly or resignedly , continue to accept that Washington must go_on playing a lead role in international affairs ; most other nations , too , accept this . There simply is no other power whose leadership others immediately look_to when crises erupt or great international ventures are called_for . The United States , says Lt . Gen . James Clapper , director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , has become &quot; kind of the world ' s 911. &quot; Foreigners , however , appear to be more eager than Americans to have the United States take the point position . With the end of the Cold_War has come an unmistakable erosion in the national consensus on just what the scope and nature of U.S. engagement abroad should be , especially where the use of force might be involved . While there was always domestic dissent over the nature of the Cold_War and the means with which it was waged , most Americans generally supported policies that aimed at containing the spread of communism . But in the post-Cold War era , a study by the Times Mirror Center for the People &amp; the Press has found , there is no longer broad agreement on where vital interests lie . The public and opinion leaders agree that protecting U.S. oil supplies and trying to prevent nuclear proliferation are of basic importance , the survey found . Other polls have pointed to a readiness to support intervention related to such domestic problems as illegal drugs and illegal immigration . Beyond that , opinion is unfocused and uncertain . All this can change , of course , as the world changes and as the drama of events works_on popular emotions . Globe-spanning technology that now makes instantaneous communications possible can be a wonderful thing . But at the policy-making level , it can be an insidious thief that robs decision_makers of the time they need to reflect and consult . James A . Baker III , George_Bush ' s secretary_of_state during the Persian_Gulf_War , once said that a CNN broadcast of a &quot; peace &quot; proposal by Saddam Hussein early in the crisis forced the White_House to rush_out a response within the hour , lest Iraq gain a propaganda advantage . Similarly , concern over how the public might react to TV pictures of the devastation along the highway taken by Iraqi troops retreating from Kuwait prompted the U.S. decision to bring the war to what many think was a premature halt . For better or worse , information technology has become an influential force in decision_making . Increasingly , Washington has opted for multinational approaches to world problems , through a stronger United Nations or other groupings . Nowhere is that more important than in trying to contain the chaos and alleviate the suffering produced by the implosion of what have come_to be known as failed states . In coming weeks , The Times will explore some of the key challenges U.S. foreign_policy is likely to face in the years ahead . Based in part on interviews with more_than a score of specialists , we will look_at basic concerns and interests that drive U.S. policy , assess what the nation ' s global priorities should be and what realistic limits govern American efforts . The Cold_War , for all its anxious testing of wills , in time came_to be regulated by implicit understandings among the major_powers . Where Cold War-related conflicts occurred -- in Southeast_Asia , the Middle_East -- they stayed localized . In a crude way , the Cold_War produced something of an orderly world , able to carry_on even under the omnipresent threat of mutual assured nuclear destruction . That threat has been lifted . But while the superpowers have halted their arms race , smaller states have not . Indeed , there has been a breakdown in the restraints Moscow and Washington once could apply to the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction . Controlling proliferation looms as one of the great problems . Henry A . Kissinger has written , &quot; The problems of energy , resources , environment , population , the uses of space and the seas , now rank with questions of military security , ideology and territorial rivalry , which have traditionally made_up the diplomatic agenda. &quot; At the same time , competition for world markets has intensified , even as the need for greater economic integration and cooperation has expanded . American vision and leadership are certain to be severely tested in confronting basic problems of how finite global resources can be justly apportioned among this planet ' s rapidly expanding population . The foreign_policy agenda for coming years -- not a series of discrete problems but a tangle of interrelated ones -- is crowded , complex and worrying . In coming weeks we ' ll look_at some of the major items on that agenda , and offer some ideas about how our country should proceed . * Next Sunday : The U.S. global role .</TEXT>
