   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEWS ; SHOWTIME ' S ' REBEL HIGHWAY ' RECYCLES AIP ' CLASSICS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If they can remake &quot; Angels in the Outfield &quot; and &quot; Lassie &quot; for the ' 90s , by gum , they can remake &quot; Confessions of a Sorority Girl &quot; and &quot; Runaway Daughters. &quot; Which is just the inevitable exercise that Showtime has undertaken with its new series of Friday night movies , collectively titled &quot; Rebel Highway. &quot; The 10 reconstituted titles in this &quot; drive-in pictures &quot; series mostly hail from the vaults of AIP -- American International Pictures , a.k.a. Always Irritating Prudes -- with well-known contemporary directors trying their hands at trash recycling . Were they veritably ripped from today ' s headlines , these stories , like &quot; Reform_School Girl &quot; and &quot; Motorcycle Gang &quot; ? Uh , no . But many hemlines will get ripped , at least , in the coming weeks , and the series ' indomitable appeal proves nothing if not that juvenile_delinquency knows no season . Tonight ' s premiere offering , &quot; Roadracers , &quot; is the second feature-length effort from Robert Rodriguez -- who is uniquely qualified to direct one of these pictures , since his critically hailed debut , &quot; El Mariachi , &quot; was micro-budgeted even by old AIP standards . Though each of these Showtime features costs a relatively robust $ 1.3 million , success hasn ' t spoiled Rodriguez : &quot; Roadracers , &quot; too , looks and feels as if it were done on the fly , with adrenaline dripping into the editing bay . Sam Arkoff would be proud , or at least not ticked_off . A la several of the filmmakers involved , Rodriguez hasn ' t actually remade the original &quot; Roadracers &quot; but just borrowed the title and started from scratch . His version has a good -- or at least , er , soulful -- leather-bearing hood , Dude ( David Arquette ) , battling a nasty one , Teddy ( Jason Wiles ) , in diners and on extemporaneous drag strips all_over town , while an almost nonstop rockabilly soundtrack eggs them on . Dude also has a voluptuous Latino dreamgirl to alternately pout and cheer him along . When he comes_to pick her up , he sticks his tongue down her throat in broad view of her aghast parental units and promises , &quot; I ' ll be sure to get her back as late as I can. &quot; One of their dates is at the roller rink , where Dude and Teddy and their respective cliques will momentarily ditch dragsters for a rumble on skates . It ain ' t quite the &quot; Ben-Hur &quot; chariot_race , but it suffices quite nicely ; watching Dude derail his rival by literally greasing the track with his ' do has to count as one of the week ' s major TV pleasures . &quot; Roadracers &quot; is a giddily shameless paean to misspent youth . By contrast , John Milius ' taut suspenser &quot; Motorcycle Gang , &quot; which airs in two weeks , takes just the opposite tack ; there , Gerald McRaney plays an upright ex-Marine dad who must rescue his virgin daughter from the clutches of socially licentious beatniks and psychopathic bikers . And in three weeks , in Joe Dante ' s very funny &quot; Runaway Daughters , &quot; as a supporting character there ' s the James Dean-like iconoclast who answers his folks ' every query with the tremulously voiced &quot; Don ' t crowd me ! &quot; In the passion pit , it matters little whether the hood is misunderstood or murderous , menace to society or martyr ; the odor of leather will do . Grease up the popcorn : The early , stupidly fun installments of &quot; Rebel Highway &quot; really do smell like teen spirit . * &quot; Roadracers &quot; airs on Showtime at 10 tonight and again on Thursday at 8 p.m. CHRIS WILLMAN</TEXT>
