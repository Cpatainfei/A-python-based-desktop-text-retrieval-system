   <HEADLINE> GETTING INVOLVED : MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY ; THERE ' S NO JOB TOO SMALL AT ANIMAL REFUGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the Wildlife Waystation , a refuge for native and exotic animals in Angeles National Forest , there are no unimportant jobs . &quot; You might start_out with a little bit of involvement , but once you see the need , there is so_much to do here , &quot; said Caryol Smith of Sun Valley , who started volunteering at the way station almost five years ago after raising money for the group in the Los Angeles Marathon in 1990 . Smith is now the outreach chairwoman who coordinates private tours of the 160-acre facility that has cared_for 4 # 000 wild animals a year since it opened in 1976 . &quot; All jobs need to be done , &quot; said Martine Colette , the refuge ' s founder and president . The 40 full-time and 175 part-time volunteers share the workload , taking turns from the menial jobs such_as clearing brush or parking cars for visitors on Sunday tours to the constant feeding of baby animals . &quot; Usually I spend 10 to 12 hours a day , and several days a week , &quot; said Rosella Takata , about her work in the spring as a volunteer for almost 11 years . She takes satisfaction in working in the way station ' s Baby Animal Trailer -- dubbed a BATmobile -- a converted mobile_home that is busiest in the spring and summer when thousands of baby animals must be given nearly constant feedings to keep them alive . &quot; It ' s very rewarding when you see them released , &quot; said Takata , a Monterey Park resident who has also cleaned cages , helped in the animal hospital , raked the property and helped assemble cages . She said she does_it &quot; because I like being around the animals. &quot; The way station is home to lions , tigers , leopards , mountain_lions , jaguars , bobcats , bears and more . Many have been rescued from zoos that had closed , or had been kept as pets around the world and around the country . Many people will acquire the exotic animals as pets , wrongly believing that if they get them young enough , and &quot; love them enough &quot; they will be docile , Colette said . Only later do they realize their mistake . &quot; These are dangerous animals , &quot; Colette said , and the problems in caring for them are much bigger than a private owner can anticipate . Some of the animals at the way station have had their teeth and claws removed , or otherwise handicapped , as a way to control them . &quot; They ' re not perfect , but they do have the right to exist , &quot; said Smith , who has seen the animals have a dramatic effect on developmentally disabled children when they have toured the facility . &quot; You can tell you ' re making an impression on them because they have never had an experience like this , &quot; Smith said . &quot; Mostly , they ' re in_awe_of being able to be so close to the animal. &quot; Aside from educating the public about the needs of exotic and wild animals , the goal of the way station is to release those animals who can still survive in the wild , and find homes for others in zoos when space is available . But that has become a difficult task with limited zoo space . Volunteers also help make animal toys and treats like &quot; Fishicles &quot; -- made of ice , honey , berries and fish -- or pine cones stuffed with peanut_butter or honey for the bears . As the volunteers receive more and more training , they eventually become qualified for the animal handling program , in which they take animals on walks . But every volunteer must keep_in mind that the animal ' s well-being comes first , Colette said . &quot; As long as they keep that as their focus , &quot; they can do_well as volunteers , Colette said .
