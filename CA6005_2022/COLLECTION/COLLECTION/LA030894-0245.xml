   <HEADLINE> U.S. EMBRACE OF RUSSIA AS CLOSE PARTNER COOLING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration , sobered by the new , more nationalistic tone of Russia ' s foreign_policy , is reluctantly cooling its once-warm embrace of Moscow as a reliable strategic &quot; partner &quot; for the West . In unannounced steps over the last few weeks , the Administration has shifted to a markedly tougher policy on international loans to Russia and has warned Moscow against military or political intervention in neighboring countries , senior officials said . The actions reflect growing concern that Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , reacting to the unexpected strength of nationalists in Russia ' s new Parliament , may be turning_away from economic reform and acting more assertively abroad , officials said . Reflecting those worries , President Clinton said Monday that he is concerned about events in Moscow . &quot; Is it possible that we will re-create the Cold_War ? &quot; Clinton said in response to a reporter ' s question . &quot; In one respect , it is unlikely for_sure , and that is the nuclear respect. &quot; But &quot; somewhat more likely , &quot; he added , is that &quot; the Russian people will turn_to leaders who will say the best way to go_for the future is . . . the reimposition of some sort of empire. &quot; &quot; The United States has worked with and supported President Yeltsin because we believe that he followed policies supporting democracy , supporting reform and supporting respect for the territorial integrity of Russia ' s neighbors -- all three things , &quot; Clinton said pointedly . &quot; That is still our policy . We are interested in supporting those things. &quot; Aides said Clinton still considers aid for Russia one of his top foreign priorities and still hopes to work with Yeltsin as an ally rather than a rival in post-Cold War battle zones such_as Georgia and Bosnia-Herzegovina . Moreover , a senior official noted , &quot; all_the alternatives to Yeltsin are much worse. &quot; But after a yearlong honeymoon in which Clinton and his aides extolled Yeltsin as a peerless democratic reformer , they have begun refocusing their rhetoric -- and actions -- on the policies they wish Yeltsin would follow . And they are growing resigned to a warier , bumpier relationship in which the United States and Russia are partners on some days , rivals on others . &quot; There ' s no question that . . . we have hit a more difficult patch , &quot; a White_House official said . &quot; Some people had gotten a little romantic about the possibilities of this relationship . But it ' s becoming more mature , and less romantic , on both sides. &quot; What has happened , U.S. and Russian officials said , is that Russia ' s politicians have rediscovered the political power of nationalism -- and have concluded that cooperating with America brought them relatively little in benefits . Russia ' s parliamentary election in December , in which radical nationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky won far more votes than expected , pushed Yeltsin and his government abruptly toward tougher assertions of Russia ' s status as a great_power . But even before the election , Yeltsin was moving_in the same direction . He warned the West bluntly against admitting Poland and other East European_countries into the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , saying Russia would oppose any alliance unless it was also invited in . Yeltsin asserted his right to intervene in neighboring countries that were part of the former Soviet_Union , saying the fate of ethnic Russians there was a &quot; domestic affair. &quot; And Russia injected itself into efforts to stop the Bosnian war without consulting with the United States , raising fears that Moscow ' s efforts could interfere with Western initiatives . All that , plus the arrest last month of a CIA official accused of spying for Russia , prompted some Administration critics to declare the earlier policy bankrupt . &quot; We cannot be thinking in terms of a partnership , &quot; said Sen . Richard G . Lugar ( R-Ind. ) , former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . &quot; We really have a very strenuous rivalry going on. &quot; Clinton rejected that conclusion , arguing that the United States should continue sending economic aid to Moscow because a stable Russia is in America ' s interest . Further , senior officials added , Russia ' s bark in foreign_policy has been worse than her bite . On most major issues , the two countries are still cooperating nicely . Still , the Administration has quietly taken steps_in response to Russian moves_over the last three months : * U.S. officials have toughened warnings against Russian military_action in former Soviet areas , including a line in Clinton ' s State of the Union address insisting that if Russian troops operate in neighboring states , they do so only when those states agree to their presence . * Officials privately complained to the Russians about their diplomacy in Bosnia . Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev told Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher last week that he would try to consult more fully . * Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk visited the White_House last week and Georgian President Eduard A . Shevardnadze visited Monday -- in part , some officials said , to signal to Moscow that the United States will support those countries ' independence against any Russian pressure . * On the key issue of economic aid , America , once the leading proponent of large-scale loans to Russia from the International Monetary Fund and other financial_institutions , has joined European_countries and Japan in_demanding concrete reform in Moscow before more such money flows . The United States will continue its program of direct aid to support new private enterprises and democratic institutions in Russia , officials said . But as for major aid to the Russian government , &quot; we ' re going to wait and see , &quot; a senior official said . &quot; If there are reforms , we will push . If not , I don ' t think you ' ll see us pushing. &quot; The direct U.S. aid program may_not be as large as once projected . The Administration has sent Congress a request for $ 900 million for the next fiscal_year , well below this year ' s $ 2.5 billion . Earlier , officials said they might well ask_for more aid if Russian reforms continued . But now , &quot; we ' re fairly comfortable with the $ 900 million , &quot; said one . But those changes are not enough for some critics ; they assert the Administration is still too blindly attached_to both Russia and Yeltsin . &quot; Our approach . . . has been characterized by sloganeering , wishful_thinking and a romantic attachment to Russia , &quot; complained Zbigniew Brzezinski , national security adviser to former President Jimmy_Carter . &quot; I think the Administration is beginning to realize that its policy is floundering , is unsound , but is very reluctant to face that fact. &quot;</TEXT>
