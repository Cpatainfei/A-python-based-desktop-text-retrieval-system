   <HEADLINE> NEWS BITES : HARDLY HEALTHFUL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> OK , it ' s good to eat healthfully . Is it more expensive ? Yes , at least for now , find researchers at the Department of Human Nutrition in Adelaide , Australia.In a study published recently in the Journal of Nutrition Education , they show that the most common way to eat a more healthful diet -- replacing high-fat or high-salt prepared foods with their low-fat and low-sodium counterparts -- is more expensive . At least until some future_day when manufacturers provide a greater range of more healthful products at lower cost , it seems your best bet to eat healthfully and save money will be to restructure your diet from the ground up . And that , the authors of the study note sadly , is a great_deal more difficult for most people than simply swapping one food for another . BRUCE HENSTELL</TEXT>
