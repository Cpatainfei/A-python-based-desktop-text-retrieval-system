   <HEADLINE> THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY IN MEXICO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> 1994 will be the crucial year for Mexican democracy . The Party of Revolutionary Institutions ( PRI ) has no viable answers_for the heart of Mexico ' s problem -- its social , eco nomic and cultural realities no lon ger coincide with its political structures . This was Spain ' s problem when Francisco Franco died . The Spanish transition to democracy is , in many ways , a model that Mexico can follow . In Mexico , four factors will determine the nature of this year ' s transition : the electoral year , negotiations in Chiapas , which have now produced a tentative agreement , negotiations in Mexico_City and the president himself . On Aug . 21 , Mexicans will elect a new president , a new Congress and various governorships . But the black_bean in the white_rice , as we say in Mexico , is that our elections are burdened with the dubious prestige of a good whorehouse : They work , but are they virtuous ? Today , there is a general impression that Mexico ' s elections have never been virtuous and no longer work . If the prolonged regency of the PRI once sustained itself on the party ' s offer of internal peace along with economic development , the rebellion in Chiapas has destroyed that image . The country is nervous , unsatisfied . Too many people have been left_behind , and macroeconomic successes can no longer hide or resolve microeconomic realities . But then , as the unorthodox candidate to the Chilean presidency in last year ' s election , Manfred Max Neff , told me in Santiago , &quot; No one lives in the macroeconomy. &quot; This is not to say that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s economic measures do not deserve praise . Stabilizing an economy that had almost hit rock-bottom , controlling inflation , trimming the fat of the state , amassing currency reserves , attracting foreign capital , managing debt and opening_up the sealed , protectionist economy to free_trade and global integration -- all have been largely successful policies , even as they create problems . But the Salinas government was convinced that economic reform at the top would : a ) make people ' s lives better at the bottom and b ) banish , or at least postpone , demands for democratic reform . The Soviet example was constantly invoked in government circles . You can ' t have perestroika and glasnost at_the_same_time , we were told . Obviously , too many Mexicans thought otherwise . Each gubernatorial election since 1989 has been marred by fraud , post-electoral conflict , the deaths of opposition partisans and the naming of interim governors by the president . Right now , of 32 Mexican states , 17 are ruled by interim governors . This means that more_than half the country ' s 90 million people are governed by people they did not elect . Credible elections thus impinge_on another urgent Mexican reform . We need a working federalism , but creating an effective system means establishing a true balance_of_powers , a freely elected Congress and an independent judiciary . All this , in turn , requires checks and balances , accountability and credible elections . A large menu for any country with Mexico ' s authoritarian tradition . The high-handed electoral reforms of the Salinas government gave the PRI automatic majorities in the name of &quot; governability &quot; and left the electoral institutions in the hands of the government and , thus of its electoral hook , the PRI . Demands for electoral reform began last year but got nowhere until Chiapas . The Chiapas rebellion has been the detonator . Even the wooden rifles used by the rebels hit their targets : the inequality of the country is just too great , the conspiracy between local exploiters and local authorities indecent . Wrongs cannot be righted without local democracy in Chiapas , meaning the rights of the peasant and Indian communities to elect their own leaders . But you cannot have democracy in Chiapas without democracy in Mexico , or democracy in Mexico without democracy in Chiapas . The local problems of Chiapas and the national problems of democracy are intimately linked . The people of Chiapas have realized that a brutal change is about to take_place . From being simply exploited over the centuries , they were about to become marginalized for the next millennium in a macroeconomic , technocratic , global village . Millions like them exist in other Mexican states . A signal from Subcommandante Marcos , the rebel leader in Chiapas , could set dozens of Chiapas-like rebellions on the march . Salinas has said he is trying to correct things that had gone_wrong , and he has set the stage for the ongoing political negotiations headed , in Mexico_City , by the secretary_of_the_interior , human-rights advocate Jorge Carpizo MacGregor . No Mexican president before him has admitted to any mistakes . But now , this young , energetic and intelligent president has his task cut_out for him . Mexican presidents are known for one thing . Lazaro Cardenas means Oil . Miguel Aleman , Industrialization . Diaz Ordaz , the Tlatelolco massacre . Jose Lopez Portillo , Debt . They are historically labeled . Salinas , until Dec . 31 , 1993 , would have had just one label : NAFTA . After Jan . 1 , he is tagged by Chiapas . But before surrendering office Dec . 1 , he could -- and should -- have a single historical insignia : Democracy . The negotiations headed by Carpizo have a clear agenda . The electoral law must be reformed yet again so that the electoral authorities are independent of the president and the PRI . The electoral lists must be updated and approved by all political_parties . A limit must be set_on partisan funding , and public resources must_not be employed for partisan ends . Electoral fraud must be penalized . Access to the media must be assured . Results must be known promptly . The big problem of Mexico ' s fraud-ridden system is that it is not credible . In fact , it is so incredible that people only believe there was no hanky-panky if the PRI candidate looses . The electoral reform must make things so credible that people can believe_in the election even if the PRI candidate wins . A big step_in this direction will be the presence of both national and international observers . The former are readily admitted by all . The latter the government balks at admitting . The fourth element of this Mexican poker is the president himself , Salinas as guarantor of a democratic process . But a passive guaranty is not enough . I ' m afraid the president himself has to take_up the banner of democratic reform and campaign as forcefully for it as he did for the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . He cannot go_on making piecemeal concessions without weakening the presidential institution . Salinas was wrong in hurdling over any internal democratic process in his own party and naming one of the three PRI contenders as the PRI candidate through presidential fiat . Both the PRI and the country would have benefited from three pre-campaigns . As it is , Luis Donaldo Colosio was designated not only candidate but heir . Now , after Chiapas , Colosio has to establish his own credibility , his own independence and his own commitment to democracy . He faces not only the traditional right and left opposition , but also an potential challenge from within his own ranks . Manuel Camacho Solis , dead after the president fingered Colosio , rose from his grave when the same president named him peace commissioner in Chiapas on the same day Colosio began his campaign . But democracy will not depend only on a_few men , even on better elections , but on a whole new culture , the culture of the civil society -- its non-governmental organizations , co-ops and unions , media and associations -- rising from the bottom and the margins of our society . That takes time . What 1994 will tell us is how much time : a lot , a little or none at all .</TEXT>
