   <HEADLINE> ONE BIG GLORIOUS BAZAAR ; THE MARKETS AND STREET VENDORS OF ISTANBUL HELP DEFINE THIS VIVID CITY , WHERE IDEAS AND GOODS HAVE BEEN TRADED FREELY FOR CENTURIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ISTANBUL SMELLS OF HONEY AND WOOL , COFFEE and pistachios , newsprint and fried mackerel . It smells of luxury and necessity , of salt , canvas , tar and gasoline . Istanbul smells of commerce.Istanbul is the only city astride two continents . Asia and Europe are both joined and separated by the Bosporus , the strait whose currents flow through Istanbul in two directions -- a warm , northward thrust up from the Mediterranean by way of the Sea_of_Marmara and a colder , less salty flow south from the Black_Sea . Like the fish that have sustained many generations of Istanbullus ( as the city ' s residents call themselves ) , ideas , languages and ambitions -- and mercantile goods of every description -- have also swirled through this conduit . The first city on the site , Byzantium , was a modest Greek trading colony that languished under Rome . Under the Emperor Constantine , though , it became the great Eastern Roman capital of Constantinople . Constantinople ' s language was Greek , its law Roman , its state religion Christianity . We call its epoch , art and intrigues Byzantine , after Byzas , legendary founder of that initial Greek settlement . Constantinople became the most populous and prosperous city of the medieval world . Trade_in hides , wine , frankincense and grain was matched by a traffic in doctrines . Theological hairsplitting provided as much employment as the mercantile fleets . Franciscan monks set_up shop here in the 13th Century , while St . Francis was still alive . In 1204 , the Fourth_Crusade -- Roman_Catholic armies funded by Venetian merchant bankers -- sacked this capital of Eastern Orthodoxy , which was a juicier , more pluckable plum than distant Jerusalem , in the clutches of infidel Arabs . By the time the Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople in 1453 , it had become a depopulated and demoralized shadow of a city . They named their dingy diamond Istanbul , from the Greek phrase eis ten polin , meaning &quot; to the city. &quot; Within 100 years , a Muslim Istanbul was again a booming cosmopolis , where a score of nationalities and sizable communities of Christians and Jews ( refugees from the Spanish Inquisition ) all traded with each other and the rest of the world . Caravans brought slaves from Africa and the Caucasus , spices and jewels from India , furs and amber from Russia , silver and gold from the New World , foodstuffs from around the Mediterranean , cloth from Venice and Samarkand . The famous Silk_Road led here . Today , Istanbul is a sprawling , chaotic agglomeration of peoples and purposes , astonishingly rich_in art and architecture , a quintessential city , a sifter of risk and reward . The worst thing I can say about it is that it ' s locked_in mortal combat with the automobile , the cancer of modern economic_growth . But above the traffic , you can still hear peddlers hawking artichokes and melons , a muezzin ' s call to prayer , church_bells , the melancholy notes of a tavern zither . The evening skyline of domes and minarets , crescents , crosses and dockyard cranes epitomizes the continuum of spiritual and secular endeavor . For all its pulsating neon , Istanbul still has a human heartbeat . The pleasure of the smallest errand or transaction always makes me thankful to be here . &quot; May your cough be gone , &quot; says a bank teller , insisting that I share her herbal_tea ; a boy refuses a tip for carrying heavy parcels ; a taxi driver begins a $ 2 ride with the supplication , &quot; In the name of God , the Compassionate and the Merciful. &quot; This is my idea of civility -- of civilization -- a place where you can wear your jewelry , drink the water , eat the arugula . Even the fax machines work . Can there be any comprehensible introduction , for the first-time visitor to Istanbul , to a city stretching over so_much time and space ? Too many visitors end_up merely awestruck -- and exhausted -- by the city ' s museums and architectural riches . It ' s almost impossible here to know which way to turn , which roads to take . Clearly , a plan or guiding principle is called_for -- and I have a suggestion as_to what it might be . Every time I return to Istanbul , I visit its markets to get my bearings . And every time I show the city to friends , I like to take them on a walking tour that focuses_on trade -- on markets , street sellers , vast bazaars . My aim is to present Istanbul as the unabashedly commercial nexus that it is . After all , it is the &quot; pursuit of piastres , &quot; to quote the Encyclopaedia Britannica , that has fueled centuries of artistic patronage in this gilded city . Of course , the route I follow -- through the European portion of the city -- is incidentally studded with splendid edifices , evocative vistas , delicious snacks and quirky detours . Istanbul ' s markets seem to touch every_other part of the city as well -- which , of course , is the point . Let ' s begin with a glass of freshly squeezed pomegranate juice on the sidewalk in Taksim Square while taking a moment to familiarize ourselves with the city ' s internal geography . You and Taksim Square are in the center of the Beyoglu district , full of garlanded Beaux-Arts apartments and soaring hotels . The Golden Horn , a scimitar-shaped inlet of the Bosporus , separates Beyoglu from Stamboul , the old city where most of Istanbul ' s Roman , Byzantine and Ottoman monuments are located . Off the square runs Istiklal Cadessi , a bustling thoroughfare newly closed to all but emergency vehicles and a quaint tram shuttling along a central track . Istanbul is a city for those who delight in detail , from the tiny Ottoman stone birdhouses on the northwest corner of Istiklal to the modern retail vitrines festooned with bolts of Italian silks , English pin stripes and Turkish mohair in shops along the way . Cane baskets on long ropes dangle from side-street balconies amid the fading signboards of Greek furriers and Sephardic milliners . Tugs and cries allow upper-story residents to consummate transactions with egg or yogurt sellers down below . Virtually any comestible -- from hot kebabs to watermelons cradled in hammocks of old sheets -- may be hauled_up . Halfway down Istiklal , the Cicek Pasaji , or Passage of Flowers , gives_way to a fish market . Trying to sell you a glistening turbot or giant shrimp from the Syrian coast , the fishmongers look genuinely crushed when you confess that you ' re staying in a hotel , without kitchen facilities . Mingling with the seafood sellers are a score of delicatessens selling olives , cheese and comb honey ; an herbalist ( the only source I know in Istanbul for tofu ) , and a restaurant that specializes in tripe soup , an essential hangover cure for habitues of the nearby beer halls . Academic publishers and antiquarian bookstores cluster around the bottom of Istiklal . Atop the steep alley of Galip Dede is Librarie de Pera , a multilingual bookshop that also holds auctions of rare volumes and ephemera . Surrounding shops make and sell traditional Middle Eastern musical_instruments . A simple stringed saz , a kind of long-necked lute , can be had for less than $ 50 . Cross the Golden Horn on the sidewalks of the new Galata Bridge , as bland as its predecessor was lively . The former bridge was framed_in floating fish restaurants from which to ogle this unchanged view of the famed Topkapi Palace above jostling ferries and fishing dinghies . Rumor ( a Byzantine specialty ) has it that the old bridge may be resurrected , but for now it lies dismantled , farther up the Golden Horn , near the cast-iron Church of St . Stephen of the Bulgars , another curiosity . Labyrinthine walkways beneath Stamboul ' s reconstructed roadway snarl lead you to the gray hulk of the Yeni Valide Mosque . Beside it is Misir Carsisi , the Egyptian Market , also called the Spice Bazaar . ( Larger mosques were designed with shops adjacent so that their rents might support pious programs -- Koranic instruction and feeding the indigent. ) The pungency of fenugreek-cured beef pastirma wafts out from the bazaar . Hucksters of apricot aphrodisiacs and kiwi-flavored lekum ( Turkish_Delight ) complement the assault . Sadly , high rents have forced many of the more traditional aromatics shops out of the bazaar , but one that still maintains standards ( as well as a huge selection of culinary and medicinal spices ) is called Acar , located in stall No . 42 . They sell Iranian saffron packaged to resemble miniature peacock fans and keep their very best rose attar locked_in a closet . A few yards from Acar is the Kurukahveci coffee grinding and roasting shop . Mehmet Kurukahveci ' s family has sold coffee since before the Ottoman Empire lost Yemen , the source of its best beans . Today , the beans are Brazilian , but the intense industry and intoxicating aroma of his establishment suggest that business has never been better . Along the Spice Bazaar ' s west wall , a riot of scarlet peppers , eggplants , leeks , okra and purple carrots announce the presence of one of Istanbul ' s best produce markets . Fresh fruit and vegetables aside , its variety of rice and grains is unsurpassed as well . Istanbullus have a reputation as gastronomic spendthrifts , addicted to rice pilaf with lots of butter -- which folklore says is the food of those who dwell in paradise . Stalls on the eastern side of the Spice Bazaar , remains of the Ottoman bird market , now sell nursery plants , garden paraphernalia and pets . ( Falling between the medicinal and pet categories , leeches are sold here , too. ) The guild of nightingale-sellers is long gone , but the fortune-tellers still use rabbits and doves to select folded-paper portents for their clientele . Uphill from the Spice Bazaar , the warm smell of sawdust announces the Uzun Carsi , the Long Market , full of woodworking shops . Beyond these , with their cradles and spoons and such , are suppliers of hunting gear , embroidered military insignia and prayer beads . The brass-workers ' ateliers sell everything from belly_dancers ' finger cymbals to star-and-crescent minaret finials . Also available here : children ' s hair barrettes , evil_eye talismans , Adidas gym bags and seamless white ihrams , simple togalike garments worn on the pilgrimage to Mecca . Toward the top of Uzun Carsi , the veritable suction of the Kapali Carsi , the Grand or Covered Bazaar , begins to exert itself . I always try to resist it , though , long enough to detour to the back of the Bayazit Mosque , where a laconic flea_market spreads beneath a gnarled plane_tree known as the Tree of Idleness . Here , spring-wound watches with lurid green faces and Cyrillic lettering count the hours . Lenin medals gather dust amid postage_stamps and the tarnished coins of defunct empires . Knowing my weakness -- that I could spend hours here -- I swoop quickly over the orange-crate tables , pass_up a photo of Archduke Ferdinand and scan inventories of Bakelite buttons , crucifixes , keyless locks and a one-armed Barbie doll . Sacrilegiously , I ' m reminded of a famous Byzantine fresco in the Church of St . Saviour in the Stamboul neighborhood of Chora . The painting depicts Christ , having broken_down the gates of Hell , yanking Adam and Eve from their graves on the Day_of_Judgment . Around their tombs lie the lost things of everyday life -- dog bones , keys , pieces of jewelry -- as well as the bound Satan . All right , no Barbie dolls , but you get the idea . Sometimes , a dark poyraz wind from the Black_Sea impatiently rustles the leaves on the Tree of Idleness . Whiffs of roasting chestnuts , chick peas , lamb fat and long-brewed tea are in the air , but maybe the poyraz carries other scents to these vendors of cultural castoffs -- pickled cabbage , sour rye , the coal smoke of other towns , other homes washed by the Danube , Don and Dnieper ? What New York was to Eastern Europeans at the end of the 19th Century , Istanbul is to some of their kin at the end of the 20th . Requiring no long weeks in steerage , this is a closer El Dorado , one you can reach by bus or Aeroflot . And you can go_home again , with a bale of blue_jeans and soft leather jackets to unload in Krakow or Yalta . But you ' ll probably come_back to Istanbul again -- to peddle your grandmother ' s wedding_dress , a bogus icon or a dozen jars of caviar . Istanbullus call this &quot; suitcase commerce , &quot; and the whole area between the covered Bazaar and the Aqueduct of Valens thrives on it . Hotels with names like Pisa and Paris are filled with Slavs , Romanians and Hungarians learning the free-market ropes . A hand-lettered sign_in English directs one to &quot; Home-Cooked Cuisine served by Balkanian Turks. &quot; These might be members of Bulgaria ' s oppressed minority or even Muslim Bosnians , whom Turkey continues to accept into its swollen cities . Another kind of desperation -- or boredom -- has adventurous and entrepreneurial non-Muslim &quot; Natashas &quot; from Russia investing their capital -- youth , pretty faces , compliant bodies , distance from disapproving families -- in the most predictable of professions . For respite from the profane , soothe your soul with calligraphic scrolls , marbleized papers and leather bindings in the adjacent Booksellers ' Bazaar , where the written word has been the stock in trade since Byzantine times . Then the Covered Bazaar . . . . After two decades of visiting Istanbul , I know the Kapali Carsi by its scent of indigo cloth , its tinkle of tea-glasses , its blindingly bright windows filled with 22-karat dowry bangles -- a commodity so fundamental in the Turkish economy that their daily price is published beside those other market staples , flour and mutton . ( While a first-time buyer of Oriental rugs almost always pays more for something here than he would back home , virtually no one is cheated_on gold jewelry . Members of the jewelers guild police each other. ) Even more glittering are the bazaar ' s players -- Central Asian Uzbeks hauling bundles of quilted coats ; a Kurd offering an Indian sari he found in Aleppo ; an Assyrian Christian dental assistant-turned-goldsmith who tells me that he ' s Jewish , but his best customers are Kuwaitis , and that his sons can sell pearls in six languages ; a Sephardic leather tailor insisting he ' s Armenian as he flirts_with French tourists ; a former paratrooper-turned-rug-dealer . Personalities shimmer and change color like lengths of silk . Over one portal of Kapali Carsi , stone-carved strokes of graceful Arabic quote the Prophet Muhammad : &quot; The trader is God ' s beloved. &quot; Mine , too .
