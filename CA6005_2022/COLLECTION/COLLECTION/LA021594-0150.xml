   <HEADLINE> MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ : LATEST BREW-HAHA ; BEVERAGE GIANTS BANKING ON ' ICE ' BEER TO RALLY SALES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When John Frank goes bowling Monday nights , he pays almost as much attention to which beers his buddies order as he does to the score sheet . that ' s why Frank , who is editor of Beverage Industry magazine , was all ears recently when a nearby bowler ordered an &quot; ice &quot; beer -- a newfangled beer brewed at super-cold temperatures . &quot; It tastes a lot colder than regular beer , &quot; Frank recalls the thirsty but misguided bowler saying after his first gulp . &quot; That must be why they call it ice beer. &quot; Those words , off-base as they are , make sweet marketing music to the ears of the beer giants . Facing years of declining sales , brewers are desperate to persuade consumers that they have created a beer that is better than yesterday ' s brew . Ice beer is not a frosty mug of beer with ice_cubes clinking inside . It is simply beer brewed at a temperature so cold that ice_crystals form . The process was devised in Germany but popularized in Canada , and beer_makers insist it makes the brew taste richer . Ice beer -- which often has a higher alcohol content than regular beer -- is already being marketed as the hottest thing since , well , dry beer . This week , Miller Brewing plans a national rollout of its light ice beer , and Coors begins a limited distribution of its own icy brew . Industry skeptics say the brewing brouhaha is little more_than a marketing gimmick aimed at prodding beer_drinkers to pay_up to 50 cents more for a six-pack . Because of incessant ad_campaigns from Madison Avenue image makers , &quot; nobody wants to drink their father ' s beer , &quot; said Frank , who marvels at repeated attempts by big brewers to market something new . &quot; I call this the slippery ice beer segment. &quot; But the major brewers call it something else : hope . In Canada , where it has been marketed for slightly more_than a year , ice beer already accounts_for nearly 12 % of the market . By the end of 1994 , industry consultants say ice beer could account_for 2 % of the much bigger U.S. market -- worth almost $ 1 billion in retail sales . By comparison , dry beer sales accounted_for about 1.7 % of the domestic beer market in 1993 . &quot; Every brewer with a marketing department worth its salt is saying : ' Hey , I ' ve got_to get_in on this , ' &quot; said Jerry Steinman , publisher of Beer Marketer ' s Insights , a West Nyack , N.Y.-based industry newsletter . that ' s why each brewer is already claiming some sort of ice beer &quot; first. &quot; Labatt ' s says it was first to sell it in North_America . Coors claims it is first to use the technology domestically . Anheuser-Busch has first dibs on the draft version . And Miller boasts it is brewing the first low-calorie ice beer . Can a clear ice beer be far off ? * Few have forgotten the huge lead that Miller Brewing took_in the light_beer segment in 1973 , when it introduced light_beer and everyone else watched it steal the market . &quot; It ' s a hot time for ice beer , &quot; said Lynn Dornblaser , publisher of the trade magazine New Product News . One year ago , the domestic ice beer segment didn ' t even exist . Today , however , a dozen or so ice beer products have already been announced . &quot; It will probably be one of the hottest new products of 1994 , &quot; Dornblaser said . &quot; But look_for it to fade by 1995. &quot; Yet the industry push for ice beer is almost frantic . that ' s because the beer industry is reeling from five consecutive years of flat sales . The problem is particularly acute in California , where per-capita consumption dropped 12 % last year , according to one consultant . The big brewers have spent millions of dollars over the past decade trying to persuade consumers to buy new beer products that are &quot; dry , &quot; &quot; draft , &quot; &quot; clear , &quot; &quot; light , &quot; &quot; low-alcohol , &quot; &quot; no-alcohol , &quot; &quot; low calorie &quot; and the most recent entry -- &quot; ice. &quot; Several brewers have also just begun promoting &quot; red &quot; beers -- which are slightly heavier brews that typically have a reddish tint to them . Until the mid-1970s , brewers mostly sat_back and watched sales grow . But health concerns led to modified drinking , and some beer_drinkers now prefer specialty beers from brew pubs and microbreweries . This has forced the brewers to battle fiercely for market share . &quot; For the first time in its history , the brewing industry has to come_up with new ways to develop the beer market , &quot; said Bob Weinberg , a St . Louis brewing industry consultant . * But not everyone approves of the ice beers , most of which have an alcohol content of 5.5 % by volume , compared to 5 % for many regular beers . &quot; In a society with 13 million alcoholics , we don ' t need this kind of product , &quot; said Thomas R . Neslund , executive_director of the Silver Springs , Md.-based International Commission for the Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug Dependency . &quot; It will appeal_to younger drinkers in particular -- who are the least well-informed. &quot; But Anheuser-Busch executives point_out that their ice beer has the same alcohol content as their regular beer . &quot; In today ' s environment , we certainly don ' t want to get_into an alcohol content war , &quot; said August A . Busch IV , vice_president of brand management . Miller Brewing Co . executives say the higher alcohol content in their ice beer is only the incidental result of the brewing process . &quot; We are not trying to sell higher-octane beer , &quot; said Richard P . Lalley , director of new business development for Miller , which makes Miller Icehouse beer , and which this week will roll_out Miller Lite Ice . &quot; We have a product with a taste that consumers say they want. &quot; But the additional alcohol has also led to some marketing glitches . State laws in California and Texas are forcing most of the brewers to refer to the higher alcohol brews as &quot; ale &quot; instead of beer in regional advertising . &quot; Sure , it results in some confusion , &quot; Lalley said . Still , Miller ' s ice beer sales could account_for up_to 4 % of its market share by the end of the year , he said . There is even a battle raging over the term ice . Labatt Breweries of Canada , first to sell ice beer in Canada , recently sued rival brewers Miller and Molson for using the term ice brewing in ads , saying it has exclusive_rights to that phrase . Coors Brewing Co. , which signed a domestic licensing deal with Labatt , will this week begin distribution of Coors Artic ( yes , that ' s how they misspell it ) ice beer , said Jon Runge , new product development director . And industry giant Anheuser-Busch began selling Ice Draft beer in the West four months ago . By the end of 1994 , ice beer could account_for 4 % of the company ' s sales . But ice beer has a long way to go_to make a believer out of Dan Snook , general_manager of Stratton ' s bar in Westwood . Although his tavern has plenty of ice beer on_tap , few of the UCLA students and professors who frequent Stratton ' s ask_for_it , he said . &quot; It ' s just a gimmick , &quot; Snook said . &quot; In fact , I ' m planning to phase it out. &quot; Briefly . . . The Los Angeles agency Asatsu / BBDO has picked_up the estimated $ 5-million ad business to help launch a new video component line for El Segundo-based Aura Systems . . . . The Los Angeles agency Stein Robaire Helm has picked_up the $ 2-million ad account_for the Santa Ana-based Orange County Register , which was formerly handled in-house . . . . Canoga Park-based Redken Laboratories has placed its $ 6-million account , which has been handled by Stein Robaire Helm , in review . . . . The Advertising Industry Emergency Fund is accepting requests for financial assistance from qualifying earthquake victims who are ad industry professionals .
