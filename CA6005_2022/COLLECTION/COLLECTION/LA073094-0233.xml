   <HEADLINE> FEDS DO THEIR DUTY IN BRAZIL ; SOCCER : SEARCH BEGINS FOR TONS OF ITEMS BOUGHT IN U.S. BY WORLD CUP CHAMPIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The treasure_hunt is_on . Federal_agents are looking_for the 17.4 tons of personal items bought by Brazil ' s soccer team during the World Cup , cargo that was waived through Rio ' s international airport last week to the chagrin of customs officials . Lafredo Vieira Lopes , a federal judge , gave police the green_light Thursday to search the homes of the 93 players , staff and guests of the team delegation that failed to pay $ 1 million in customs duties on excess luggage . Agents started at the home of Ricardo Teixeira , president of the Confederation of Brazilian Football , who went_over the $ 500 limit on personal items that can be brought_in duty free by Brazilian nationals . Teixeira is the son-in-law of FIFA President Joao Havelange . Teixeira refused to show airport customs officials in Rio his luggage and told players to boycott a scheduled ticker-tape parade there . Moments later , airport officials said a call came from the presidential palace in Brasilia to let the baggage go uninspected . When the feds came , however , Teixeira was apologetic . &quot; We never thought there would be a problem , &quot; he said , after giving the federal police and tax inspectors a list of his luggage . &quot; At no time did we ask that our baggage not be inspected. &quot; Next came Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira , who told police he brought_in $ 3 # 700 worth of items , including a color_TV , personal_computer and laser_printer . &quot; It wasn ' t that we didn ' t want to pay duties , we just didn ' t want to leave our baggage impounded at the airport , &quot; he said . One by one , the agents knocked_on the doors of stars : Romario , Bebeto , Mazinho , Jorginho , Branco , Leonardo , and assistant coach Mario Zagalo . What did they find ? A doll house , and a baby stroller . &quot; My baggage looked big because I bought a doll house for my daughter . But I swear , I didn ' t go_over the $ 500 limit , &quot; Mazinho said .</TEXT>
