   <HEADLINE> TUESDAY SPECIAL ; VALLEY INTERVIEW ; FORGIVENESS CALLED CRUCIAL TO MAINTAINING 7-MONTH GANG TRUCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A truce between Latino gangs in the San Fernando Valley has been in_effect for more_than seven months . There have been episodes of violence during that time , but they have resulted in no deaths of gang members , according to truce organizers . The treaty was arranged by two volunteers , William ( Blinky ) Rodriguez , co-owner of the Jet Center gym in Van Nuys , and Donald Garcia , who spent more_than half his life in prison before turning his life around seven years ago . Later , they were joined by a third man , Steve Martinez , whose dramatic refusal to seek vengeance on gang members who shot him only two days before the first peace_treaty organizing meeting -- he still wore his hospital bandages -- provided a concrete example of forgiveness at a time when the gangs wondered how a treaty could possibly work . Each Sunday the three meet with representatives of gangs to mediate misunderstandings between them that could lead to violence . As the three men sat_down a_few days ago to speak with staff writer John Johnson about the treaty , they were struggling to prevent retaliation by Latino gangs over the accidental killing June 11 of a Latino woman caught in a cross-fire between what police said were black gangs . * Question : What is the state of the truce ? Answer : ( Rodriguez ) We ' re at seven months and 13 days without a killing or gang-related homicide . We ' re at a place where we ' ve put an enormous amount of extra_time into it . There have been some altercations , some different incidents between the neighborhoods . But no one ' s really retaliated . Before , what would constitute a killing was just the idea of killing someone . Now there ' s been some things happening where someone could have died but didn ' t . So we ' ve just been really shoring_up the foundation and doing whatever we ' ve got_to do to keep communication lines between the neighborhoods together . * Q : What led all_of you to get involved ? A : ( Garcia ) For a while , Blinky and myself -- this is before Steve got involved -- we had like a burden in our neighborhoods for the violence that was happening within the barrios . We just fell_into this by what I believe was an act_of_God . Why we ' re involved is because we have this burden . We were raised in the Valley . We see the change . It ' s not like it used to be . The barrio used to protect a barrio . Now you ' ve got little gangs within the barrio , and they ' re fighting among themselves . And that ' s what we ' re trying to prevent . My reward is seeing that the mothers aren ' t crying and the babies , meaning the gang members , aren ' t dying . * Q : Has it taken a toll on you all ? A : ( Martinez ) Yeah , it has . We ' re very tired and weary . There ' s times where one person is not feeling that strength that day , so the next person will take that place . If I ' m too tired or not_able to deal with a situation , one of them will go . It ' s been a lot of work . * Q : Are you making changes in the gang members ? Can they see how things are_better with the truce ? A : ( Rodriguez ) Each and every gang member in this Valley has benefited , just in the fact that they ' re not living_in a constant fear all_the time . Before , if a car drove by , you ' d hide under a car or duck out of the way . Now there ' s more confidence that they can walk down the street -- which seems the most basic thing that an individual in our society can do , take a walk down the street without feeling any kind of a fear or pressure . I feel also that these individuals have learned more about themselves . They ' ve learned to humble themselves a little . They ' ve learned to swallow false pride . * Q : Is this a religiously centered effort ? A : ( Garcia ) Let me answer that . I believe that if it wasn ' t for God , this peace would not be happening . Because the frustrations we go_through , if it wasn ' t for the Lord giving us the wisdom and the strength , I know for a fact that it would n ' t work . Because there ' s times when I want to erupt , but because the Lord is in control of my life and I ' m focused_on him I get control of my emotions and my thinking and my feelings . For example , Steve wasn ' t serving the Lord . He was just a gang member . And after he was around us , all_of a sudden the Lord got ahold of his life and he ' s now one of our members at the head of the table . * Q : Steve , would you mind telling about that meeting where you stood_up and forgave , because it seems that was really important in getting the truce off on the right foot ? A : ( Martinez ) When I saw they were trying to do a peace_treaty that would help everybody , I knew for it to work that I had to forgive . Those guys who shot me couldn ' t wonder if I was going_to be holding a grudge against them . In my heart , I believe that if I held a grudge I would n ' t be able to do the kind of work that I ' m doing now . I did get shot two days before the peace_treaty . The guys ( who did_it ) were there . It was a big surprise . I was very angry at first . I felt very disrespected by the fact of them being there . But for the sake of the peace_treaty , I said I would hold_back and stop anybody from trying to get pay-back for what happened to me . To make the peace work , that ' s where it all started , by forgetting the past . It was only two days afterward and I had bandages on me and everything . * Q : Was that a hard thing to do , to get_up and say that ? A : ( Martinez ) Yes , yes , it was . A lot of emotion . Afterward , they shook my hand and they told me , &quot; We respect you for what you did. &quot; It really hit them hard . We talk to each other real good now . They call me a lot . They use me to consult a lot of the situations they get_into . ( Rodriguez ) The power is the forgiveness . I had to also forgive the people who killed my son ( four years ago in a drive-by attack ) . That is the way of God . But by today ' s standards , to a lot of people , it becomes a weak hustle . We ' ve been very sensitive , so that you don ' t misconstrue what ' s going_on . We ' ve been very careful of the way we have shared the reflection of the love of God through our lives . We don ' t sit in these meetings and Bible-thump people over the head . we ' ll normally open it up , Donald will say a prayer or read a little portion of Scripture . He ' ll break_down the Scripture , what it meant in simpler terms . And then we get_on_with issues and agendas and arbitrations and whatever it takes . There have been a_few that have said , &quot; I don ' t know about this turning the other cheek stuff. &quot; We say , &quot; We don ' t ask anything from anybody , except that you respect us for who we are. &quot; This last Sunday when Donald said the prayer I saw a lot of hats coming_off . Even though when that prayer ' s over they ' re back to their old stinking thinking , the bottom_line is they ' re giving us the respect at that time and place . Don ' t judge us by what we say , judge us by what we do . By the fruits we ' re producing . Right now we ' ve produced seven and a half months without a killing , which is unprecedented , which is historical in this Valley . . . . We might as well be private_investigators . We ' ve got_to go_out , find_out exactly what happened . First of all , they have the respect_to call us . Then we respond , because sometimes you can ' t wait until tomorrow . It ' s got_to be right now , because right now there could be a killing . We respond , we track_down the guys that blew it . We find_out what happened . Then we ' ll go looking_for the other people . It takes one day , two days , three days . We track them down , we bring them together . ( Garcia ) And they call us so they won ' t retaliate . We see them negotiating , coming_to agreements . I don ' t know if they realize it , but they are swallowing their pride a little bit . * Q : What has to happen next to keep this going and make_it last ? A : ( Rodriguez ) There has to be structure . that ' s something that we ' re slowly moving_into . The Jet Center is going_to be the Valley outlet for Cities in Schools , a national dropout prevention program . There ' s funding out there . And there ' s going_to come a time and place where we ' ll have to go_into strategic planning and structure . But at this point_in_time the main concern has been solidifying and putting_out fires , because it is summertime . Summertime is when all_the problems kick_out , where they triple . We were hoping to have a summer baseball_team , something to provide_for these guys to vent . I would like to see them attend a Bible study . We have dialogue with the LAPD . We recognize they ' re a part of it . We ' ve gone_through this attitude of , &quot; What are they about ? Are they no good or are they sincere ? &quot; It hasn ' t been like anyone running to embrace what we ' re doing . Because we ' re dealing with a part of society that ' s an eyesore . Most people say , &quot; Lock them up and throw the key away , they ' re irredeemable. &quot; We ' ve found people that are very redeemable and very salvageable . We haven ' t come_in with data , we haven ' t come_in with documentation , we haven ' t come_in with a blueprint . We just jumped into the water and started swimming . A lot of people thought this thing will never last -- &quot; they can ' t keep this thing going. &quot; * Q : Has the attitude of police turned_around ? A : ( Rodriguez ) I got a call from ( Deputy Chief Martin H. ) Pomeroy . He called me because of the incident that has happened recently on the street ( the woman caught in the cross fire ) . To come from the top guy in the Valley , they ' ve got confidence in us . ( Garcia ) My past wasn ' t a very successful or loving adventure . The first time I talked to police_officers was at a handball tournament . They saw the change in my life . I would even tell them , &quot; We thank_you for being here. &quot; We need the police just as much as they need us . Now I believe they ' ve got a better understanding . ( Rodriguez ) We wish they would realize what we have now is a very special thing . I hear from different guys , &quot; Yeah , right , the peace_treaty . It will fall apart. &quot; Which reminds me of some of the gang members that are negative about the peace_treaty . ( Garcia ) You ' ve got them on both sides . * Q : Regarding the future , what should be done next ? A : ( Rodriguez ) We need to be able to mobilize with more of ourselves . Donald has a full-time job , Steve has a full-time job . I own my own business . We would like to be out there much more , solidifying and recruiting guys that have good brains , good_sense . I recognize there ' s a lot of agencies in this Valley . Especially now , when the No . 1 agenda in the nation is gangs , there ' s a lot of agencies out there that would like to help us but just haven ' t . They haven ' t come and said , &quot; Here ' s some unencumbered dollars. &quot; They wonder , &quot; Whoa , wait a minute , what are you going_to do with these dollars ? You expect us to give you some money with no proposal ? &quot; In other words , red_tape . My worst nightmare is we lose a grip of the handle and then this Valley recognizes what we had . No one in this Valley has been able to do this before . Here we are , willing vessels . But we also have needs . We are looking_for help . There ' s agencies now that are turning their protocol toward gangs because where the federal funds are going is toward gangs . Without getting too political , the situation is that they know how to milk the system , but we can get_it done . * Q : Are you saying unless you get some resources you won ' t be able to continue this ? A : ( Rodriguez ) I ' m not saying that . We will go_with everything we ' ve got , regardless . But we can be more efficient , more effective . We can really pull something together for the San Fernando Valley that has a sense_of_direction . We do need help , though . We ' re not trying to be the Lone Rangers , because this job is too big . * Q : How big a demand has it made on your families ? A : ( Rodriguez ) I ' ve been called_out at 3:30 a.m. ( Linda Garcia , Donald ' s wife ) When I receive those calls , it doesn ' t upset me . It makes me want to give Donald the phone . When I received that call four years ago and Blinky was telling me his son was killed , that was the most devastating phone_call I ever received . I will never , ever turn anyone away . ( Garcia ) We can ' t thank the gang members enough for participating . They ' re the big part of the solution . ( Rodriguez ) The homicide detective is sleeping at night .</TEXT>
