   <HEADLINE> PUC PUSHING FREE-MARKET REVOLUTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In less than a decade , the impeccably conservative Republicans of the California Public_Utilities Commission have unleashed the most far-reaching deregulation of telecommunications , natural_gas -- and now electric utilities -- undertaken by any state or nation . Whether they achieve their intended result -- lower consumer prices and a competitive climate for California industry -- or stir_up the business and consumer woes that have plagued deregulated trucking and airlines will take years to assess . But rather than continue micromanaging utility companies ' business decisions -- and risk dictating bad policy -- the five members of the PUC prefer to let the marketplace have its way with the state ' s power and telecommunications industries . Back in the 1970s , different commissioners with more confidence in government planning bet_on the conventional wisdom that soaring oil prices would never return to earth . The consequence : State programs that promoted new energy sources but also locked_in higher energy costs than might otherwise have lingered after oil prices collapsed in 1986 . &quot; And over the past 20 years , those higher costs have pushed more energy-intensive manufacturing to other states , &quot; said Lynn Reaser , chief economist of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles . That fateful look in the crystal ball weighs heavily on the current commissioners and their brilliant , if occasionally imperious , president , UC Davis law professor Daniel W . Fessler . &quot; Simplified regulation -- less green eyeshade regulation -- if we can bring it off , will reduce the regulatory burden on California ' s economy , &quot; Fessler said , &quot; especially now as we ' re opening this world of competition. &quot; * Throughout its 83-year history , the PUC ' s decisions have cast long shadows on a state whose sprawling growth has been linked inextricably to energy and measured by the march of telephone and power poles into distant suburbs . &quot; We have been always one of the first_states to be_on the cutting edge of technology , &quot; said Fessler , citing California ' s high per capita access to telephones , electricity and other basic services compared to the rest of the country . &quot; And we have -- I think anybody would concede -- one of the most reliable infrastructures for the delivery of energy on the face of the earth , &quot; he added in the resonant boom that has helped make his contracts law classes popular . With much of its free-market revolution yet to take_hold , the future of the PUC was threatened last year . Statehouse planners weighed a transfer of some of the agency ' s authority to the state Energy Commission . Fessler , considered the commissioner with the closest ties to Gov . Pete Wilson , led a stalwart defense , and in the end Wilson called_for eliminating the Energy Commission instead . Having hung_on to their power , what the commissioners want to do is substitute market forces wherever possible for traditional command and control regulation , including the conventional rate-setting authority that has kept tabs on the state ' s investor-owned utilities -- including Southern California Edison Co. , San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. , Southern California Gas Co. , Pacific Bell and GTE . Rapid changes in technology and federal law have brought competition to industries that for most of this century trudged along as &quot; natural monopolies. &quot; Electricity , gas , water and phone_service , it was assumed , would always be public_services that could be delivered most dependably and cheaply by companies given exclusive franchises in their markets -- and then watched hawk-like by the PUC to assure that consumers ' interests were protected . Now , technology -- particularly in telecommunications and in generating electricity -- has changed that . New devices have made_it possible for new companies to compete with utilities . And the technology is so complex and evolving so quickly that withdrawing from micromanagement is the commissioners ' most fervent hope . Competition &quot; puts the customer in the decision-making responsibility , not the commission , &quot; Commissioner P . Gregory Conlon said . &quot; Regulation is just a surrogate for competition. &quot; Deregulation of long-distance telephone_calls , with the 1984 breakup of AT &amp; T , started the PUC down the free market path . In the decade since , long-distance rates have dropped 63 % . This fall , the commissioners are expected to release their plan for bringing competition to regional toll_calls -- such_as those between Los Angeles and Riverside or Irvine and Santa Monica . Already , more_than 120 companies are waiting to get_into that business , said Commissioner Norman D . Shumway , a former Republican congressman from Stockton . &quot; Next is deregulation of the dial tone &quot; -- local_calls -- with a goal of consumer choice by 1997 , Shumway said . The commission considers the deregulation of natural_gas -- which also began after a federal lead in 1984 -- a stirring success , as well . Commissioner Patricia M . Eckert recently had the cost-benefit picture researched for the deregulation of wholesale natural_gas . In the mid-1980s , high-priced , long-term production contracts were renegotiated in light of falling gas rates . For the $ 10 billion invested nationally by gas buyers in the one-time restructuring of contracts , $ 80 billion in payments was saved over a decade . The commission next wants to open_up natural_gas pipelines within the state to competition . Conlon and other commissioners want to expand on an experimental program that gives some residential customers a choice of natural_gas suppliers . California ' s high electric rates -- which run about 50 % above the U.S. average -- have proved a tougher nut . &quot; We started scratching our heads in 1980 , &quot; said Edmund J . Texeira , a 37-year commission veteran and director of its Division of Ratepayer Advocates . In the mid-1980s , the PUC made its first attempt at stabilizing energy prices , implementing a state policy to promote renewable and domestic fuels , thereby lowering_California ' s dependence on foreign oil . That reliance had left the state more vulnerable than any other to the oil shocks of the 1970s , resulting in gas_lines and mile-high prices for natural_gas and electricity . In spring , 1985 , the PUC ordered an auction that led to the state ' s electric utilities signing contracts to buy power from independent power producers -- many of which made their electricity from solar , wind , geothermal and other sources . Today , California has more diverse sources of energy than any place in the world . Some technologies -- notably wind_power -- are becoming competitive . Although rates are high , Californians ' monthly power bills are much lower than the national average because energy conservation programs have been so successful . The bad news is that many of these 1985 contracts were pegged to high oil prices . Until cost adjustment clauses take_effect starting in 1997 , the pacts are pushing_up utilities ' energy costs . Big industries that cannot cut their energy consumption are hard hit -- or hitting the road to other states . &quot; This hangs like the proverbial sword over the economy of California , &quot; said John E . Bryson , chief_executive and chairman of SCEcorp. , parent of Southern California Edison . Bryson , who served as PUC president from 1979 to 1982 , estimates that in 1996 , the independents ' contracts will cost Edison $ 1 billion more_than it would otherwise pay_for electricity for its customers . Until the commission adopts its proposal to deregulate the electric industry -- a plan that calls_for all customers to have a choice of power providers by 2002 -- a new auction of power contracts at more competitive rates is being held_up . The delay has brought the strongest criticism so far of the electric deregulation plan . The state ' s independent power producers are furious , saying that 5 # 000 jobs and $ 1.5 billion in investments are being jeopardized . Environmentalists remain deeply suspicious that deregulation will sacrifice renewable energy on the altar of commerce . &quot; It ' s not a debate about whether to have competition . The environmental community has promoted competition for years , &quot; said Ralph Cavanagh , energy policy director of the Natural_Resources Defense Council . &quot; It ' s over how competition should proceed. &quot; Even as they take_on such far-reaching issues , commissioners have sought to rule apart from the political fray . * In 1912 , reform-minded Republican Gov . Hiram W . Johnson tried to insulate the commission ' s predecessor agency from political influence by enshrining its autonomy in the state Constitution and transplanting its headquarters from Sacramento to San Francisco . But in carving out such independence -- at the time , from the railroads and their political allies -- Johnson also embedded a legacy that rankles critics to this day . Commission decisions can be overturned only by the state Supreme Court -- something Fessler acknowledges happens about three times a decade . Consumer groups say that gives them no practical recourse if they feel ill-served by the blizzard of regulatory decisions that occupy the commission ' s time between big policy moves . They also object that , unlike judges , the commissioners are free to have private conversations with parties to their decisions . That puts residential and small business consumer groups at a big disadvantage versus the utilities , said Robert Gnaizda , senior partner and co-founder of San Francisco-based Public Advocates Inc. , which campaigns at the PUC for consumer protection and minority opportunities . &quot; When some well-paid lobbyist wines_and_dines a commissioner and gives him a 100-page document with a seven-page summary , you can ' t know what he said , so you can ' t refute it , &quot; Gnaizda said . Last fall , the commission was forced to withdraw its initial proposal for deregulating regional toll_calls when it was learned that phone_company executives had been at PUC headquarters the night before the commission vote . After years of public hearings and discussion , changes were made that night that uniformly favored the utilities . The big utilities pay $ 100 million to $ 150 million a year to attorneys who represent them before the PUC , Gnaizda estimates . In contrast , he said , consumer group attorneys -- who are awarded fees by the PUC when they win a case -- have averaged $ 500 # 000 in lawyers and experts fees and court costs annually in the past decade . &quot; Most of the effective consumer groups won ' t appear before the PUC , &quot; Gnaizda said . &quot; It has a bias , sometimes unintentional , for the powerful. &quot; Fessler , although seen by many as the commission ' s strongest consumer advocate -- would rather see less , not more , courtroom procedure . &quot; The old trial model of confrontation -- of everybody starting with the most extreme position and then assuming that the judicial process will move them in the direction of a more reasonable outcome -- is crazy if you ' ve got 15 people staking out extreme positions , &quot; Fessler said . He has also campaigned for an end to state laws that ban commissioners from meeting behind closed doors for procedural discussions . Nonetheless , bills pending in the Legislature would toughen the open meeting rule or allow judicial_review at the appellate_court level . Assemblywoman Gwen Moore ( D-Los Angeles ) , chairwoman of the Assembly Committee on Utilities and Commerce , supports the measures . &quot; Dan Fessler is a very bright and insightful individual . . . and ( he ) provides a leadership that probably has not been present in recent times , &quot; Moore said . &quot; But the PUC has the power to impose billions of dollars in rates on ordinary ratepayers . . . . We have to make the system as fair and open as possible. &quot; No matter what rules they follow , the commissioners have launched policies that could lead to a smaller , less-powerful agency . After the bugs are out of deregulation early in the next century , many commissioners see renewed emphasis on the interests of yesteryear , such_as safety and consumer fraud , and attention to new concerns such_as data security in telecommunications . When the Northridge quake hit , &quot; it wasn ' t an accident that the ( utilities ' ) spare_parts were there , &quot; Fessler said . &quot; It wasn ' t an accident that the contingency plans were there . . . . And that will be_on the agenda when I ' m long gone. &quot;</TEXT>
