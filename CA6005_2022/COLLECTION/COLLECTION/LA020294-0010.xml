   <HEADLINE> LEGISLATURE KNIFES GUN_CONTROL IN THE BACK ; BOMBAST ON &quot; THREE STRIKES &quot; ; WIMPINESS ON KATZ BILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The bill was endorsed by no less than California Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren . By Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block . By L.A. Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti . By the California Police_Chiefs ' Assn . By the California State Sheriffs ' Assn . By the Professional Peace_Officers Assn . of Los Angeles . By the California Assn . of Highway Patrolmen . And the list goes_on . The measure would have made_it easier for authorities to prevent crime and to crack_down on convicted criminals . It would have raised penalties and resulted in more prison time for more criminals . Passage should have been a no-brainer . But Monday , the state Assembly , in another dispiriting victory for the gun lobby , defeated the legislation in a 34-40 vote . AB 1105 , sponsored by Assemblyman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) , was simple : It would have increased the maximum penalty for illegally carrying a concealed gun to close to the maximum penalty for illegally carrying a concealed knife . Although not all gun_control measures are , in practice , crime control measures , AB 1105 clearly was . Why , after all , would someone illegally carry a concealed firearm unless that person contemplated using it illegally ? To add insult to injury , the same day the Assembly buried Katz ' s bill , it passed , with blinding speed , no less than five measures aimed at locking_up habitual_criminals for life , sending those so-called &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; bills on to the Senate and what looks_like legislative passage . There is perhaps no clearer picture of California ' s -- and indeed the nation ' s -- backward response to the escalation of violent crime than that offered Monday by the Assembly , where a gaggle of lawmakers outdid one another with ever-tougher proposals to lock_up repeat criminals and throw_away the key -- while at_the_same_time defeating a measure that actually could have prevented some of those crimes . Legislators , law_enforcement officers and an overwhelming number of private citizens rightly are frustrated over the revolving door in the state ' s overcrowded prison system , a door that sometimes allows violent criminals back onto the street well before they complete their prison sentences . We share that frustration ; we support the impulse behind these proposals . However , we are concerned about unintended effects : the cost of building new prisons to house these offenders , the cost of maintaining a large population of prisoners until they die and the question of appropriateness in , say , imprisoning a nonviolent , three-time-loser drug dealer for life but not a first-time murderer . Doesn ' t deterring criminals from committing their initial -- let alone repeat -- offenses make more sense ? Illegal possession of a concealed gun is currently a misdemeanor punishable by up_to a year in jail . Katz ' s legislation would have permitted the filing of felony charges in such cases ; conviction would have been punishable by up_to three years in state_prison . Summary defeat of this measure by a Legislature that regards itself as now focused_on gun crime as never before is , to quote Assemblyman Katz , &quot; pathetic. &quot; And disgraceful .</TEXT>
