   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : SEMIFINALS ; THE DREAM TEAMS : ITALY-BRAZIL ; SWEDEN SURVIVES 25 SHOTS BUT NOT ROMARIO ' S HEADER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The World Cup will always find its own level . It might allow upstart teams to join the party and play for a time , but it is emphatic about rejecting those it feels have lingered too long . Sweden on Wednesday was relegated to the third-place game and thanked for its participation , as was Bulgaria . Now it ' s serious , the tournament seemed to say , and it ' s time for the nations dripping in soccer tradition to take center stage . That would be Brazil and Italy . Brazil toyed_with Sweden before finishing it Wednesday , 1-0 , before 84 # 569 at the Rose Bowl . Italy earlier had beaten Bulgaria . Thus the two stalwarts had rid the tournament of the teams whose hopes and aspirations had taken them further than their skill . &quot; A great clash of international football , &quot; said Brazil Coach Carlos Albert Parreira , eyes dancing at the thought of meeting Italy in Sunday ' s championship game . &quot; There are two teams that are tri-champions . Finally , the world will have a four-time champion. &quot; Soccer traditionalists awakening this morning and noting the teams in the championship game will smile and remark to themselves that all is right with the world . Sweden was , as always , game and determined and totally and absolutely committed to defense . Its players were athletic and undaunted and also utterly outplayed and overrun . For its part , Brazil put_together its best game of the tournament and Romario , who scored the winning goal in the 81st minute , darted and slashed and repeatedly made dangerous runs . Brazil lacked only the ability to finish -- it outshot Sweden , 26-3 . Parreira ' s assessment of the game might have lacked in charity but not in accuracy : &quot; Tactically and physically we controlled the game ; all aspects , all situations , all game ( long ) . The score of 1-0 does not translate Brazil ' s supremacy. &quot; Swedish forwards Martin Dahlin and Kennet Andersson had no forward support , but it didn ' t matter as Sweden showed it had no real stomach for the attack . Even its midfield played deeply and copied the packed-back defense that had yielded a 1-1 tie when the teams played two weeks ago . &quot; To go_through the Swedish penalty_box was almost impossible , &quot; Romario said . It was a curious comment coming from Romario , who appeared to have little hindrance with his forays forward . Romario teamed with Bebeto and Jorginho , whose constant overlapping runs_on the right side bypassed the clogged midfield . Among them , the three Brazilians peppered Swedish goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli with a fusillade of shots . &quot; I don ' t know what the percentage was , ( but ) they controlled it , &quot; Ravelli said of the ball , the game and every_other significant statistic . &quot; I think it was 70-30 , or maybe even 80-20 . The ball always came_back whenever I shot it out. &quot; At one point in the first_half it was not even left for Ravelli to save the day ; after Romario had pulled the Swedish goalkeeper out of position , leaving a gaping net , defender Patrik Andersson raced to the rescue , kicking away Romario ' s shot that appeared to be a sure goal . It got_worse for Sweden in the second_half . Jonas Thern , the team ' s defensive midfielder , was red-carded for a foul on Dunga . Sweden played a man down in its last game against Romania and survived , but a player down against Brazil is far worse . Soon after that Dahlin the striker was taken_out in favor of Stefan Rehn the midfielder , a defensive substitution , and Swedish Coach Tommy Svensson made known his intentions . It was the soccer equivalent of a boxer retreating to a corner and shielding his face with his gloves , content to absorb the blows . Minutes later Romario scored . The inevitability was clear . &quot; They had many goal opportunities , &quot; Svensson said . &quot; It had to count sometimes . It was not a surprise. &quot; Jorginho , on the right , curved a high cross toward goal . Ravelli stood his line , noting that Romario was to his right but marked by two Swedes . The 5-foot-6 Romario leaped and knocked the ball sharply off the side of his head and into the near corner of the net , his fifth goal of the tournament . Ravelli : &quot; It was a hard and wicked cross. &quot; Ravelli knows . He knows that Brazilians can do odd and dangerous things to the ball on their crosses . They can coax a curve and dip and call the ball back to them . So Ravelli held his line , fearing a trick . There was no trick , only Romario . Opposing goalkeepers in this tournament would argue the semantics . Even as the Brazilian fans pounded their drums and flapped their flags , Sweden held . Its defense bent but rarely broke . Brazil had done_it , it had done enough and everyone knew it would need to do no more on this day . There was still Italy . Brazilian assistant coach Mario Zagalo , reflecting on the win , offered this : &quot; There is a proverb in Brazil , &quot; he said . &quot; ' Dripping water on a hard rock keeps dripping until it wears a hole. ' There was never a time I believed Brazil was not going_to do it. &quot; Trust in Zagalo ' s judgment . He was the coach of Brazil the last time it was in the World Cup championship match , in 1970 . The Brazilians played Italy . And they won .</TEXT>
