   <TEXT> Viewers of the &quot; American Gladiators &quot; television_show probably look_on Shelley Beattie with envy . As &quot; Siren , &quot; one of the show ' s muscular competitors who battle contestants in feats of strength and skill , she seemingly has it all -- the physique of a champion bodybuilder , the looks_to attract an audience and the determination to be a success . Now Beattie , a Malibu resident , is turning heads on the sailing circuit . Despite having no previous sailing experience , she has secured a spot on the first all-female sailing team to compete for yacht_racing ' s pinnacle -- the 144-year-old America ' s Cup . She will be aboard America3 , one of three U.S. yachts entered in the competition , which gets under way Jan . 12 in San Diego . She has been designated one of five &quot; grinders &quot; -- crew_members who use muscle power to raise , lower and change the direction of sails that measure 4 # 500 square_feet and develop several thousand pounds of pressure in strong winds . Beattie ' s achievements are impressive in themselves , but her background makes them remarkable . When she was 6 , doctors found she had a hearing problem . Now , at 26 , she ' s nearly 100 % hearing-impaired . Her parents , unable to cope_with her difficult teen-age years , put her in foster care , where she languished in three homes with no special provisions for her disability . Though often confused and alone during those years , Beattie emerged from a shell of shyness and began using her disability as a motivation for winning . &quot; You get put_down so_much growing_up that you acquire a survival instinct , &quot; she says . &quot; Don ' t tell me I can ' t , because I will show you I will. &quot; Beattie has exhibited such grit from an early age . Blessed as a natural athlete who found security in sports , she excelled in track in high_school and later developed an interest in weightlifting . She wound_up on the professional bodybuilding circuit and in 1990 won the USA Champion contest . She went_on to earn titles in the Ms . International and Ms . Olympia competitions . That led in 1992 to her most visible role -- that of the muscular , supercharged &quot; Siren &quot; on &quot; American Gladiators. &quot; Typically dressed in a red-white-and-blue spandex outfit that reveals every sinewy line on her 5-foot-7 , 150-pound body , she competes against both genders -- effortlessly , it seems -- climbing a 35-foot wall , suspended 20 feet in the air from a harness or sparring with a pugil stick from a seven-foot-high platform . During her third season of taping &quot; American Gladiators , &quot; Beattie ' s husband and manager , Jon Romano , heard about openings for America ' s Cup crew_members and encouraged her to apply , despite her lack of yachting experience . &quot; He believes_in me probably more_than I do , &quot; she said . With an open slot in her schedule -- after completing the &quot; American Gladiators &quot; season and before promoting her new Gold ' s Gym facility in Puerto Vallarta , Mexico , which is under construction -- she decided to take her husband ' s advice . &quot; It ' s nowhere near what I thought I ' d be doing next , &quot; Beattie said of the America ' s Cup competition . &quot; It just came_up and I grabbed the chance. &quot; It wasn ' t as easy at that , however . Beattie was merely one of 600 women athletes who applied for a chance to participate in sailing ' s greatest event . She knew it was a long_shot , akin to a second-string running_back trying_out for a spot in the backfield of a Super Bowl team . But she made_it into the group of 50 invited to three grueling , weeklong tryouts . When the team lineup was announced last June , Beattie ' s name was_on the list with 25 others whose backgrounds included sailing , weightlifting and rowing . Sixteen team members are_on the yacht at any one time , with 10 reserves . As a grinder , Beattie will always be_on board . After taping the final &quot; American Gladiators &quot; segment for the 1994 season , she left Malibu for training camp in San Diego . As taxing as the tryouts were , the struggle in many respects had just begun when Beattie arrived_at camp . Beattie first had to learn the basics of seamanship . A native of rural Monmouth , Ore. , her exposure to the sea was limited before she moved to Southern California after graduating from Western Oregon State University . She learned yachting skills and was coached in the mechanics of being a grinder . That job revolves_around a pedestal winch , which provides the mechanical power needed to pull_in a series of boa constrictor-sized lines used to control the sails . With arms rotating like a bicyclist ' s legs , she may perform the task more_than 100 times during a tacking duel against an opposing yacht . &quot; The effort is comparable_to sprinting 50 meters on a track 30 times , with 20 seconds ' rest between each sprint , &quot; said grinder Stephanie Armitage Johnson , a world-class weightlifter and assistant strength coach for the University of Washington football_team . Armitage Johnson is one of Beattie ' s grinding partners . All of that doesn ' t include the daily gym workouts , beginning at 6:30 a.m. , to improve strength and endurance . Then there are the long days on the water , the labor-intensive chores that include stripping the $ 5-million , 75-foot racing machine of its electronic gear and enormous sails -- it requires at least eight women to carry a sail -- and the seemingly endless team meetings . The team aspect proved most difficult for Beattie . From her early days as a bodybuilder , she had been a solo competitor , depending only on herself for success . Though she earns points for a team during &quot; American Gladiators &quot; shows , she , like the other gladiators , takes_on opponents one-on-one . For a hearing person who has never been_on a team , suddenly becoming part of a group effort is difficult enough . For a hearing-impaired person it is still harder , because teamwork involves communication among the group ' s members . Frustrated because her hearing_impairment made_it difficult to understand the game_plan , Beattie nearly quit the team . &quot; I was going crazy holding in so_much anger -- I want to like people and want them to help me understand what ' s going_on , &quot; Beattie said . But she found ways to cope . She asked the coaching staff to provide her with a sign_language translator for team meetings . She has also begun teaching teammates to communicate with her through touching and gestures -- especially her grinding partners , who help Beattie respond at the appropriate time with hand signals and facial_expressions . Beattie ' s efforts and attitude have not gone unnoticed . Said teammate Amy Baltzell , who has become Beattie ' s close friend : &quot; It is such an honor to work with someone who not only has to struggle with a hearing_impairment but is an incredible athlete with such love in her heart. &quot; Certainly , Beattie has contributed to the success of the team , which in November placed second in the 1994 International America ' s Cup Class World Championship . Along with the winning team from Australia , the regatta attracted all-male teams from the United States , Japan and Russia . More significant than placing second , America3 beat the other two U.S. cup contenders , including the Stars and Stripes , skippered by three-time America ' s Cup winner Dennis Conner . With the trials just weeks away , the team is now training 12 hours a day , seven days a week to prepare_for the 1995 America ' s Cup race . Bodies are tired and nerves are frayed , but Beattie and her teammates say they are determined to win the America ' s Cup , especially for Bill Koch , the multimillionaire and former America ' s Cup winner who founded the team . &quot; You know he believes_in us -- we ' re his family , &quot; Beattie said . Koch , who won the cup in 1992 , is proud_of Beattie and calls her impact on the team a &quot; net plus. &quot; &quot; Everybody has some sort of disadvantage ; it ' s just not as obvious as being deaf or blind , &quot; he said . &quot; Shelley ' s deafness is offset by her determination , physical_ability and good attitude. &quot; For her part , Beattie says , she finds it rewarding to break new ground for women , for the hearing-impaired -- and for herself . Said Beattie : &quot; I feel that I ' m growing as a person and learning for the first time to accept myself in front of others. &quot;</TEXT>
