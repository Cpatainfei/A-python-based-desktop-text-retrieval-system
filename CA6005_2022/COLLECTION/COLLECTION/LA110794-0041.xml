   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW / NOVEL ; FINDING A PLACE OF LIFE IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH ; RECESSIONAL BY JAMES A . MICHENER , RANDOM HOUSE $ 25 , 400 PAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Recessional &quot; is about life among the elderly residents , living and dying , at the Palms , a Florida retirement home . Andy Zorn , a young obstetrician who has lost his license in a scurrilous lawsuit , is hired to manage it , with an eye to increasing profits . He elects to drive from Chicago to Tampa in icy weather and near Chattanooga he is involved in a horrible multivehicle accident in which a young_woman ' s legs are amputated below the knees . Moved by his humane instincts , Zorn aids Betsy Cawthorne and probably not only saves the young_woman ' s life but also her chance of walking again . This encounter leads to romance when she comes_to the Palms for rehabilitation . The Palms has three sectors : the Gateway , a residential home ; Assisted Living , for residents who need daily care ; and Extended Care , for those in need of around-the-clock care . The intellectual core of the Palms is a group of four men who call themselves the Tertulia , which is Spanish for a salon-type gathering . They are a former senator , a Colombian editor , a diplomat and a college president . The Tertulia amuse themselves and prove their daring and skills by building an full-scale airplane in their quarters , fitting it with an engine and successfully test_flying it over the extensive grounds . Zorn is ably assisted in his effort to make the Palms successful by his second-in-command , Ken Krenek , who knows the ropes and isn ' t ambitious to be the boss , and by Nora Varney , a huge nurse who uses her Alabama accent only when she wants to . Zorn is doing_well until he is challenged by Clarence Hasselbrook , a sinister agent for Life Is Sacred , a nationwide organization that opposes euthanasia . Hasselbrook has the ear of the press ; he moves_into the Palms to keep_an_eye_on Zorn , and threatens to ruin him with a lawsuit for assisting in the suicide of Jaqmeel Reed , a terminally ill athlete . Hasselbrook also threatens to hang the nickname Murder Mansion on Extended Care . He uses legal_action to invalidate living wills by which hopelessly moribund residents can speed their escape . Finally , however , he himself is undone by John Taggart , head of the Palms empire of retirement homes , who tapes his threats against Zorn and the Palms . Meanwhile , Betsy Cawthorne is progressing miraculously under a wizard therapist , Bernard Yancey , who has her fitted with artificial legs and soon has her walking . Betsy decides to make her &quot; maiden flight &quot; in the rehab gym before her father , Yancey and Zorn . &quot; Then with her confidence bolstered , she took a series of steps that were miraculously normal. &quot; Zorn is dumbfounded , as is everyone else , but the reader has no doubt that this is the climax . Zorn ' s fate is sealed . Later Betsy invites Zorn to her apartment and , after a_couple_of drinks , leads him to her bedroom . The reader is not introduced to the mechanics of their lovemaking , but has no doubt it was accomplished . There is love between other couples as well , even when one has been afflicted with Alzheimer ' s , a disease that Michener explores in grim detail . Berta Umlauf , who had the beastly job of caring for both her mother-in-law and her husband after they were stricken by Alzheimer ' s , says , &quot; I can tell you better than anyone else that each of them approached death with no inner courage to make_it a natural part of life , and no concern for those they would leave_behind . I can only say that they died miserably and in ways that terrified both them and me. &quot; When young Reed , the basketball star , lies dying of AIDS , he tells his doctor , &quot; I ' ve lost the battle . I ' ve thrown my life away , and I want no aid , no sympathy . I just want to die. &quot; &quot; Jaqmeel , &quot; the doctor replies , &quot; I respect you and I understand what you ' re saying . But you must remember that in this brutal game , we ' re on opposite sides : you try to die , and I try to keep you alive. &quot; Obviously , &quot; Recessional &quot; is not the stuff of musical_comedy . Its purpose evidently is to secure for the hopelessly afflicted the right to die , at_the_same_time celebrating the miracles of modern medicine , as in the case of Betsy . At the age of 87 , James Michener seems preoccupied with the riddles of life and death . The Palms is a place of life , but it lies under death ' s shadow . We miss Michener ' s boundless zest for life in his earlier works . Miraculously , like the Tertulia , he has built a cumbersome airplane , but it flies . P * Jack Smith ' s weekly column appears Monday in Life &amp; Style .</TEXT>
