   <TEXT> Once upon a time , actually it was January , 1937 , Judy Turner cut her Hollywood High_School typing class and slipped across Sunset Boulevard to share a Coke with some friends . My father W.R. ( Billy ) Wilkerson , was already sipping Coke at the same soda_fountain . He often strolled there from his nearby office at The Hollywood Reporter . Over the years a dispute has arisen over the name of this soda_fountain . Some remember it as Curries Ice_Cream Parlor . The star herself always called it The Top_Hat Cafe . The important fact is that it was next to Hollywood High_School and popular as a high_school hangout . As the blonde 15-year-old entered the soda_fountain , she caught my father ' s attention . Even decades later he would recall how &quot; breathtakingly beautiful &quot; she looked that day . Wilkerson asked the manager about the young_girl . &quot; that ' s Judy , Mr. Wilkerson. &quot; My father wanted to meet her . &quot; I ' ll ask , &quot; said the manager . The manager , who knew both of them well , went_over to Judy . &quot; That gentleman over there would like to meet you. &quot; &quot; You can imagine what ran_through my mind , &quot; Lana told me in a 1974 interview . She asked the manager , &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; It ' s OK . He ' s a gentleman , Judy . He owns The Hollywood Reporter just down Sunset. &quot; &quot; Well , if you say so . But stay close. &quot; An introduction was made . My father produced his business_card and asked the schoolgirl if she would like to be in pictures . Judy seemed confused and unsure . &quot; I ' ll have to ask my mother , &quot; she said . A few days later , young Judy visited the publisher ' s office with her mother in tow . They had decided to take Wilkerson up_on his offer . Seated in my father ' s office , Judy exuded the same natural beauty and charm he had noticed in the soda_fountain . There was also an innocence and , not the least , a burgeoning sensuality which , he knew , lights and camera would eagerly enhance . Judy was magic , he would say in later years . &quot; There was something about her that was special . She had a quality all her own that was unforgettable. &quot; My father penned a note to agent Zeppo Marx . Marx signed Judy Turner to his agency and the rest is , as they say , is history . My father ' s hunch was confirmed by the rest of Hollywood . Judy Turner , renamed Lana , was a born star . On that January day , a Hollywood myth sprang to life . In one brief , glittering moment , a schoolgirl was plucked from a soda_fountain counter and catapulted into the eternal firmament of stardom . But curiously , while Hollywood ' s history is littered with dozens of noteworthy discovery stories , this one stuck . Lana ' s much quoted &quot; discovery &quot; became one of the town ' s most enduring legends . It became famous as &quot; The Hollywood Cinderella Story &quot; because it combined a young_girl , Cinderella ; a powerful publisher , the handsome prince ; and a letter to agent Zeppo Marx , the glass slipper that transformed her life . * The Top_Hat ' s owner placed a metal plaque on the seat Lana had occupied on the magical morning of her discovery . Soon , his soda_fountain was swarming with girls eager to meet the mysterious man who had discovered Lana Turner . My father had to stop visiting The Top_Hat . Over the next three years , The Top_Hat became a highly profitable business . In 1940 , having tripled his business , its owner sold_up and retired to Florida . His good_fortune had not gone unnoticed by Leon Schwab , who owned Schwab ' s Pharmacy two miles west of Hollywood High . No matter that Lana would had to have been a track_star to sprint to Schwab ' s , inhale a Coke and make_it back for her next class . Leon sold sodas and Schwab ' s was , like The Top_Hat , located on Sunset Boulevard . He started claiming that Lana had been sitting at his counter when she was discovered , not by Wilkerson , but by her first director , Mervyn LeRoy . Since The Top_Hat no longer existed , few bothered to dispute Leon ' s claim . The myth that Lana was discovered at Schwab ' s was augmented by Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky . As Lana writes , Skolsky was having lunch at the counter when &quot; a busty blonde came_up and asked which stool was Lana Turner ' s . Skolsky simply picked one and pointed it out. &quot; The blonde sat_down and Schwab ' s became a Hollywood landmark , Mecca to thousands of tourists and would-be stars . &quot; We should own stock in Schwab ' s , &quot; Lana told me jokingly in 1974 . * Amid a lifetime of accomplishments , discovering Judy was always one of my father ' s fondest memories . She was , however , by no means the only person he guided to good_fortune . The magic dust from his wings settled_on many , including Clark Gable , Judy Garland , Jackie Gleason , Phil Silvers , famed director Joe Pasternak and mega-film producer Cubby Broccoli . But no other Hollywood discovery has captured the collective imagination as much as Lana ' s . It has fed and perpetuated the rich fantasy that Hollywood is , after all , Dreamland . No screen writer could have written it better . Lana was just minding her own business having a Coke when destiny called . Her discovery became proof that Hollywood was a place of mystery and magic where a schoolgirl can become a screen legend . In 1974 , Lana told me about her enduring gratitude toward my father . Of course , it didn ' t hurt that all through her early years , The Reporter regularly covered Lana ' s career . In 1948 , she personally demonstrated that gratitude by asking Wilkerson to be best_man at her third wedding ( to Bob Topping ) . Flattered , my father offered his house for the ceremony , and the couple delightfully accepted . She recalled her discovery with gushy tenderness . &quot; Other people over the years have been attributed with saying those lines . But it was your father who said them which I think is even more enchanting because it was your father who did find me , even though Mervyn LeRoy gave me my chance . God knows where I ' d have been if I hadn ' t been at that time and place where your father saw me. &quot; Lana ' s passing brings_down the final curtain on Hollywood ' s Golden Era . The Sweater_Girl ' s fairy tale story began with a discovery which made Hollywood history almost overnight . She will always remain that innocent and sensual celluloid spirit , a perfect Cinderella frozen in time , preserved forever for us , her grateful audience .</TEXT>
