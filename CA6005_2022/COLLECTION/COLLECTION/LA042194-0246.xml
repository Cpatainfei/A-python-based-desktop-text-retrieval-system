   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : SCHOLARSHIP NAMED FOR ADAM BISCHOFF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Family and friends of Adam Bischoff , the 15-year-old boy who drowned in the rain-swollen Los Angeles River two years ago , have created a scholarship in his name . Organizers waited until this year to launch the $ 1 # 000 Adam Bischoff scholarship program for college-bound high_school seniors because it coincides with the year that the teen-ager would have graduated from El Camino Real High_School in Woodland Hills.At least one scholarship will be awarded annually . Because soccer was a big part of Bischoff ' s life , the scholarship committee is accepting applications from students who have played soccer with the American Youth Soccer Organization for at least one year . &quot; When you think_about him , you think_about him playing soccer , &quot; said Don Winton , a member of the scholarship committee . Bischoff slipped while riding his bicycle along a flood_control channel in Woodland Hills and was washed into the fast-flowing river during a severe storm . Scholarship applicants must write a one-page essay about soccer and their career goals , and have a grade point of 2.0 or better . The deadline for applications is May 2 . Interested students should call ( 818 ) 544-6731 . SUSAN BYRNES</TEXT>
