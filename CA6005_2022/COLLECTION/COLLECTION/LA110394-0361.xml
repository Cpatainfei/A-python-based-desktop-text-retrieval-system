   <HEADLINE> SEVEN MORE GENETICALLY ALTERED FOODS PASS FDA ' S SAFETY TESTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seven more genetically engineered foods have passed a voluntary safety inspection , the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday , but scientists questioned whether the FDA is scrutinizing such foods closely enough . &quot; I am a little troubled , &quot; Dr. Marion Nestle , an FDA adviser from New York University , told the agency . &quot; It ' s as if FDA scientists have accepted these very complicated ( safety ) assessments on face value. &quot; Among the new foods is a potato produced by Monsanto that naturally resists the Colorado_potato_beetle . The potato produces a natural pesticide that kills beetles that take a bite . The FDA last spring approved the nation ' s first biotech food , Calgene Inc. ' s Flavr-Savr tomato , which has a gene that allows it to ripen longer on the vine and still get_to supermarkets without turning soft . Now the agency has completed much more cursory safety inspections of the potato and six other genetically altered plants , FDA food safety chief Dr. Jim Maryanski said Wednesday . Also approved were : * Three more tomatoes , one that works like the Flavr-Savr and two with altered genes that slow the tomatoes ' natural ripening , so they can be picked earlier and reach optimal ripeness by the time they hit store shelves . * A squash genetically altered to resist two deadly viruses . * Cotton that tolerates a common herbicide , bromoxynil , so farmers could use the herbicide . The cotton is intended to produce cottonseed_oil for animal feed . * Soybean_plants that tolerate the herbicide glyphosate . Although the FDA said the plant will be used for animal feed , soybeans and soybean_oil are consumed by people . The FDA is preparing to mandate that it be notified before any genetically engineered food is marketed . That will give the agency a chance to decide what kind of safety review each needs . &quot; We simply don ' t have the resources to give every plant that intensive review , and we don ' t see the public health need , &quot; Maryanski said . But scientists warned that these foods must be watched closely to ensure that people with allergies aren ' t put_in danger if , for instance , a nut protein is put into soybeans . Some environmentalists were also concerned , Reuters reported . Jeremy Rifkin , head of the Pure Food Campaign , a group opposed to the genetic_engineering of food , said : &quot; When you release a genetically engineered plant into the environment , the organisms are alive -- they can reproduce , they can mutate and you cannot recall them to the laboratory. &quot;</TEXT>
