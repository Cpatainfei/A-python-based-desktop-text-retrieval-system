   <HEADLINE> SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY ; CYBERSCHOOL ; SOUTH BAY CAMPUSES PUT NEW TWISTS ON OLD IDEAS WITH HANDS-ON ACADEMIC_PROGRAMS THAT STRESS INNOVATION IN THE COMPUTER AGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For several days last month at North High_School in Torrance , the ninth grade talked_about virtually nothing but dead fish . Math classes , using various-colored dried beans , learned how the state_Department of Fish and Game estimates the number of fish killed in polluted water . In physical_education , students considered how a pond full of dead fish would affect the health of people nearby . In science , they studied how polluted water kills fish . And language classes concentrated_on different cultural beliefs about the environment . &quot; I kept hearing , ' Oh my God , here it comes again , ' &quot; said Principal Timothy Scully . &quot; But ( students ) saw that the subjects are related and how you could take a project and relate it to everything . . . After all , no science exists purely in application . There ' s really no such thing as just biology or just chemistry or just geology. &quot; North High is among several South Bay schools on the crest of educational reform that are shelving old assumptions about teaching and learning while seeking innovative ways to engage students ' interest . Because of the unusual cooperation among its teachers , North was selected for a statewide network arranged to encourage schools to adopt sweeping reforms proposed by California ' s Second to None program . Second to None , started in 1992 , asks high_schools to change almost every aspect of school life . The program advises schools to prepare students for work as well as college , to create subjects for students to &quot; major &quot; in and to promote teacher collaboration whenever possible , so students will learn to approach a problem from several perspectives . Schools competed for $ 4 # 000 grants , and the winners organized into local networks last month . They were required to pool their money and must decide together how to spend it . North , Peninsula High_School in Rancho Palos Verdes and Mira Costa in Manhattan Beach are the only South Bay schools selected for the networks . At North High_School , Second to None has meant encouraging teachers to collaborate with colleagues . Mira Costa is trying to help ninth-graders make a smoother transition to high_school and to use technology in all aspects of learning . Peninsula also is increasing the use of technology and setting_up a Pacific Rim curriculum similar to a college major program . North High created an integrated science course for ninth- and 10th-graders to demonstrate how , in daily life , problem-solving can require a combination of skills . For example , in a forensics project last month , students analyzed the scene of a fabricated hit-and-run , assault or murder . To solve the crime , students used principles of biology and chemistry to test blood , fibers , fingerprints and hair samples . &quot; They have to understand about swirl patterns to do the fingerprinting and fiber analysis because some fabric filaments won ' t ( show_up ) under ultraviolet_light and others will , &quot; said teacher Glen Tanaka . &quot; Then they have to determine whether they have enough evidence to move ahead and prosecute. &quot; During a mock trial , Dawn Tsuyuki acted_as an attorney presenting evidence to a jury . Tsuyuki grilled students posing as medical_examiners and other specialists about blood under the fingernails of a subject and fingerprints on a gun . The jury finally found the &quot; suspect &quot; guilty . Mira Costa officials determined their school , which is in an affluent district and sends about 85 % of its students to two- or four-year colleges , had dismal computer and technological resources . The school now has two up-to-date computer labs for students and has computerized its library . Through the recently formed network , school officials hope to learn how other schools integrate computers into their classroom lessons . Mira Costa was selected for the network in part because it aggressively seeks grants and partnerships with businesses to help pay_for technology . &quot; We just had a demonstration from Microsoft ( Corp. ) on an amazing new laser disc program that showed how kids can take , for example , the solar_system and learn about it from scientific , historical , mathematical and cultural perspectives , &quot; Vice Principal Kate Nelson said . Mira Costa also is working_on more effective ways to help freshmen make a smoother transition into high_school . &quot; We do_well in preparing our students for college , &quot; said Principal Darlene Gorey . But we need to do something for our entering students. &quot; A team of teachers will help the students understand how expectations change in high_school . &quot; In middle_school you tell the teacher , ' My dog ate my term paper , ' ( and the teacher says ) ' that ' s fine , turn it in next week , ' &quot; Gorey said . &quot; In high_school you say that , and the teacher says , ' that ' s fine , and you ' ve failed the course. ' &quot; Peninsula High has created a Pacific Rim major for about 70 students who study Asian economics , history , cultures and languages for four years . If the Pacific Rim option is successful , majors in health and technology may be added , said Peninsula Principal Kelly Johnson . &quot; Technology has to be a part of everything , &quot; Kelly said . &quot; We ' re trying to upgrade the technology here , and the goal is to put it in every classroom . We would like to have instant communication in each class with a classroom in Russia or the Library of Congress or a school in Princeton , N.J. &quot; Already a school that sends more_than 90 % of its students to college in a year , Peninsula is seeking to improve its track record with students who aren ' t doing as well . &quot; Can everyone be a neurosurgeon ? &quot; Johnson asks . &quot; No . But can people always reach higher and achieve more ? Absolutely. &quot; Johnson uses his own career as an example for students . &quot; I was a janitor at this high_school when it was Rolling Hills High_School -- and I was a good janitor , &quot; Johnson said . He tells them success is linked to high expectations . &quot; I know some people will think that ' s easy to say because we ' re in an affluent community , but we spend less than $ 3 # 000 per kid at this high_school , &quot; Johnson said . Los Angeles Unified School District spends $ 3 # 900 per student . Expectations are high and rules are few but strictly enforced at the school , Johnson said . Students who are late to class seven times or who skip class three times must withdraw from the class and attend study hall . The high expectations seem to work in physics teacher John McGehee ' s class . At the front of McGehee ' s room is a poster of Sir_Isaac_Newton dropping an apple with a bite_out of it . A UCLA poster leans_against a bookcase , and posters of planets and a space shuttle round_out the physics ambience . McGehee is showing a baffling tangle of algebraic equations that he jokingly calls &quot; an orgy , &quot; on an overhead_projector . &quot; Oh no , we ' re talking_about orgies and here comes the principal , &quot; McGehee exclaims as Johnson walks into the room . McGehee is teaching the class how to calculate the velocity of two objects before they collide , and he is trying to coax the answer from the students . In the back of the room , Elyse Co tentatively raises her hand and gives the correct answer . The class chatters appreciatively and McGehee hurls her a lollipop . Correct answers to his questions are rewarded with candy . Wrong answers can inspire McGehee , a UCLA alumnus , to beat_up on the USC Trojan mascot hanging from the ceiling . On days she isn ' t tutoring other students , Co can be found in McGehee ' s classroom after school , building a rubber-band-powered car , which each student is required to build to study power and velocity . Then it ' s home to study for several hours . &quot; You can spend 10 zillion dollars on reform and it ain ' t gonna do a darn bit of good unless that kid will sit_down at_home , &quot; McGehee said . McGehee , who was given a Presidential Award for Excellence in science and math teaching in 1985 , also tries to show students that physics is not just an exercise in abstract ideas but something that contributes to their fun . He has been taking his physics students to Magic Mountain for years so that they can see vividly the properties of mechanics and energy . &quot; We have them do seven ' physics olympics ' events using the rides and they have to solve all kinds of problems , &quot; he said . &quot; In fact , the next olympics is coming_up soon . We always go the Sunday before Einstein ' s birthday. &quot; Which , for the physics neophyte , is March 15 .</TEXT>
