   <HEADLINE> U.N. ASKS BACKING FOR WIDER BOSNIA AIR_RAIDS ; BALKANS : CLINTON IS EXPECTED TO APPROVE TODAY . POLICY WOULD PERMIT NATO STRIKES AT SERBS ATTACKING SAFE AREAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United Nations asked the United States and its allies Monday to agree to wider air strikes to protect Gorazde and other besieged towns in Bosnia-Herzegovina , and President Clinton is expected to approve the request today , officials said . U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said he formally asked the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization to provide air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces if they attack any of six Bosnian towns that the United Nations has named safe areas . A senior Administration official said the U.N. request was made with American encouragement ; Clinton is expected to endorse it after a meeting with his foreign_policy advisers this morning . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry also discussed the question of Bosnia on Monday , disclosing that the Administration is revamping its policy and will announce a plan for &quot; vigorous action &quot; -- possibly including stepped-up military operations -- later this week . Perry said policy-makers are considering both diplomatic and military measures , among them the possibility of lifting the international embargo on arms sales to the Bosnian Muslims . &quot; There ' ll be a new set of actions -- no question about that , &quot; he told reporters during a trip from Washington to South_Korea to review the military situation there . A senior defense official said later that the Administration is not contemplating entering the war in_force in an effort to defeat the Serbs . But it was clear from Perry ' s remarks that some new military_action is possible . The new mandate sought by Boutros-Ghali , which must also be approved by the 15 other NATO governments , would significantly widen the circumstances under which American , British and other Western air_power might be used in Bosnia . NATO officials are expected to meet Wednesday . Until now , NATO has agreed only to provide &quot; close air support &quot; to U.N. forces under_attack in Bosnia . In practice , Western commanders interpreted that mandate as restricting their targets to specific units that were directly endangering U.N. forces . As a result , when NATO launched air strikes against Bosnian Serb units attacking Gorazde , the effort was too small and too late to be effective . Under the proposed guideline , the United Nations could ask_for NATO air strikes against any Bosnian Serb forces attacking the safe areas , whether U.N. forces are present or not . &quot; This goes well beyond what we have done until now , &quot; a senior official said . The ultimate aim of the new expansion of NATO ' s role in the war is to persuade the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims to stop fighting and return to peace negotiations , officials said . &quot; The idea is . . . to put_together a diplomatic approach with a tougher use of force , &quot; the senior official said . It was unclear whether more air_power could be effective in saving Gorazde , where Bosnian Serb forces are already inside the town and Muslim defenses are crumbling . The U.N. commander on the ground , Britain ' s Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , said Monday that air strikes would accomplish little without ground forces to hold territory . But senior U.S. officials were still discussing a proposal to revive a cease-fire agreement that Bosnian Serb leaders had agreed to last week , only to break it almost immediately . Under that plan , Serbian forces would withdraw from Gorazde and its immediate area and the city would be disarmed and placed under U.N. protection . &quot; We ' re not writing_off Gorazde , &quot; one Administration official insisted . But he described the city , crammed with an estimated 65 # 000 terrified refugees , as primarily &quot; a humanitarian problem. &quot; Even if the wider mandate for air_power fails to save Gorazde , other officials said , it could help protect five other safe areas : Sarajevo , Tuzla , Bihac , Zepa and Srebrenica . Under the proposal , the procedure for ordering air strikes would be unchanged . The U.N. commander , Rose , would submit a request to the civilian chief of the U.N. mission in Bosnia , Yasushi Akashi . If Akashi approved the request , he would forward it to NATO headquarters , and NATO ' s commander in the area , U.S. Adm . Jeremy Boorda , would oversee its implementation . American officials said they have no complaints about the way that process has worked in the past two weeks -- after an initial misstep last month when the first request for an air strike to protect U.N. troops took more_than three hours to arrive_at NATO . Instead , they said , the factors limiting use of air_power at Gorazde have been the narrow terms of NATO ' s mandate to protect U.N. forces and the difficulty of operating high-speed aircraft in mountainous , often foggy terrain . After a day of private talks with the United States and other members of the U.N. Security_Council , Boutros-Ghali announced his proposal late Monday afternoon . &quot; I sent a letter to the secretary_general of NATO ( requesting an agreement ) allowing the United Nations to use air strikes to protect the different free_zones in the former Yugoslavia , &quot; he said . &quot; We have the right to use air support , but we need special permission of the members of NATO to use air strikes , which is different. &quot; U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright said she supported the proposal . Yuli Vorontsov , Russia ' s U.N. ambassador , said he opposed allowing U.N. officials to call_for &quot; indiscriminate and automatic air strikes. &quot; But he did not take any formal action against the plan . Clinton ' s foreign_policy advisers discussed the proposal at a White_House meeting that lasted more_than two hours , and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake briefed the President on the plan Monday evening after Clinton returned from a day in Milwaukee , officials said . The President planned to discuss details of the proposal directly with his advisers at a rare meeting of the National Security_Council this morning , they said . &quot; We have to find a way to get the momentum back . . . for the peace effort , &quot; Clinton said early Monday . Still , the Administration appeared torn -- as it has for months -- between its desire to halt the tragedy in Bosnia and its fear of getting sucked into an escalating military commitment there . Officials said one encouraging point was the vocal anger of Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev and his special negotiator in Bosnia over the Serbs ' violation of several cease-fire agreements that the Russians negotiated . &quot; This could be helpful , &quot; a State_Department official said . &quot; Up to now , the Russians have been acting as the Serbs ' protectors . This time they may feel a need to teach the Serbs a lesson. &quot; Times staff writer Art Pine contributed to this report .</TEXT>
