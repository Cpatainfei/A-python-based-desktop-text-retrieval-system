   <HEADLINE> HEIGHTENED SECURITY IS NEEDED AGAINST NEW HIGH-TECH THIEVES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Northridge woman wasn ' t particularly concerned when the cellular_telephone bill arrived with the thickness of something not unlike the first_step in a complicated Internal Revenue Service audit . Advertisements , she thought ; maybe a_few pages of calling plans in which she would have no interest . Perhaps you can imagine her considerable chagrin when she instead found eight pages of telephone_calls she had never made , to numbers she had never seen before , and to all manner of area_codes , the locations of which she could only guess at . The bill was for nearly $ 400 . She didn ' t have to pay it . At most , her inconveniences were confined to the first few hours of shock -- perhaps horror -- at the bill , and to the annoyance associated with acquiring a new telephone_number that had to be memorized and then passed_on to business associates , family and friends . The larger questions involve who made the calls , toward what end , and the ease with which the fraud was perpetrated . Consider it one of the parasitic accompaniments to advanced technology . Your connections to systems designed to make life easier also open many new avenues for fraud and abuse . Times were , for example , that you only had to worry about making withdrawals from automated teller machines during late night hours , in poorly lit or obscure locations , and when suspicious types were lurking nearby . Now , we ' re told that the U.S. Secret_Service is investigating a sophisticated ring of thieves that has been operating in the San Fernando Valley and other parts of Southern California . Using a video camera and a long distance lens , or binoculars , they will record , from a safe distance , the finger movements that reveal the ATM user ' s personal identification_numbers and the time of the transaction . Next , according to Times reporter Tim Williams , they will rummage through discarded receipts left carelessly at the scene . When they have a match , they can use a personal_computer to withdraw money from your account at whatever daily rate that account will bear . The less greedy of these types of thieves will use the same techniques to siphon_off small amounts at barely noticeable rates over a longer stretch of time . This particular problem is dealt with relative ease : always stand close enough to the machine to block it from view_as you access your account ; never leave the receipt sitting at the machine or stuffed whole into the ATM ' s waste container ; always record the transaction in your checkbook and quickly alert the bank to any discrepancies in your balance . So-called &quot; shoulder surfers &quot; use the same techniques of observation and guile at rows of frequently used pay phones such_as those found at the local mall or airports . It ' s all_in the hopes of catching_a_glimpse of the numbers involved in your next telephone credit_card or long-distance or local telephone card number . Once gained , it is quickly transmitted to colleagues for abuse . To guard against this type of telephone fraud , you can use the same shielding techniques we mentioned for automated bank teller machines . You can also throw_in a more careful look_at your monthly telephone_bill for good measure . Cellular phone fraud is a much more difficult matter . According to a seminal article in Scientific American by staff writer Paul Wallich , &quot; Every cellular_telephone call begins with a broadcast of the telephone ' s serial number and billing number , &quot; Wallich wrote in March . &quot; Unfortunately , these numbers are also the only information a thief needs to impersonate a legitimate caller. &quot; And in the annals of suspected thieves of computer software and data from several leading cellular_telephone manufacturers , few are as notorious as the San Fernando Valley ' s own Kevin Mitnick . Mitnick apparently cut his teeth in these matters by breaking_into the Los Angeles Unified School District ' s main computers while he was still a student at Monroe High_School in North Hills . Before pleading guilty to one computer crime and serving a year each in prison and at a residential treatment program , Mitnick broke_into a North_American Air_Defense Command computer at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs , and tapped into the electronic_mail of computer security officials at MCI Communications and Digital Equipment . Mitnick is even suspected of having managed to wiretap the FBI_agents who are looking_for him . Mitnick has been the subject of an FBI manhunt for more_than a year and a half . He is a suspect in the theft of software that can be used for the handling of billing information , determining the location of a caller , and for scrambling wireless_telephone calls to keep them private . As some experts have concluded , the theft of such products could even make future cellular_phone networks vulnerable -- even as their manufacturers claim to have reached new levels of protection and privacy . It is the general ease with which such piracy is effected on everything from bank machines to giant corporations and government_agencies that speaks_to the need for heightened efforts at security in such matters . We have come_to quite a pass in this society when we all need to huddle guardedly in front of bank machines and pay phones like spies making information drops .</TEXT>
