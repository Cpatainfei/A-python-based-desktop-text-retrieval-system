   <HEADLINE> PESTS ; SILENCING THE RAT-A-TAT-TAT OF THOSE LITTLE RODENT FEET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Barbara doesn ' t want anyone to know her last_name or what city her well-kept , 20-year-old house is in . The reason ? She found a rat scurrying across her patio one evening this summer . &quot; It headed for the bushes , and I headed for the phone , &quot; she says . She asked exterminators about their effectiveness , their rates and their trucks . &quot; I didn ' t want some guy driving_up to my house with a big plastic rat on the roof . I wanted to be discreet ; this is a good neighborhood. &quot; But rats and mice are truly democratic animals . They infest neighborhoods good and bad , rich and poor , throughout Orange County . &quot; When they ' re spotted , people are sure they ' re coming from the guy next door or the flood channel nearby , &quot; says Gil Challet , district_manager of the Orange County Vector Control District . &quot; They can ' t believe there ' s a nest on their property , but that ' s often the case. &quot; Vector Control is the county agency charged with keeping track of rodents and other pests that are potential health risks and with educating the public about eradication . The district conducts free surveys for homeowners , showing them the measures needed to prevent rodent infestation . Complaints about rodents to Vector Control have multiplied during the past two years . At the height of the drought , there was an average of 6 # 000 calls per year . But as rainfall and local vegetation have increased , the numbers have climbed : Last year there were approximately 11 # 000 calls . &quot; Rodents are extremely adaptable to their environment , &quot; says Kevin O ' Connor of Global Extermination Co . in Santa Ana . &quot; In lean years , they ' ll have smaller litters ; in years with more vegetation , they ' ll bear more young. &quot; Coinciding with the ideal conditions for rodent populations is heightened public concern about a deadly strain of hantavirus , which some rodents carry and can transmit to humans . The virus , which affects the lungs and is fatal 60 % of the time , has been found in the saliva , urine and feces of deer_mice and harvest_mice . It has not been identified in rats and what is commonly known as the house_mouse . While several cases of the hantavirus have been confirmed in mice trapped in Orange County , there have been no recorded cases here of people infected . Rodents have been known through history for their ability to spread certain diseases . Fortunately , the diseases that can be passed from rodents to humans are not common , say health officials . &quot; Bubonic plague is a possibility , typhus and a mild form of meningitis , but the risks are low , &quot; says Hildy Meyers , an epidemiologist with the county Health_Care Agency . &quot; What you mainly need to worry about with rats and mice are bites and if they contaminate food supplies. &quot; Any type of bite requires immediate medical attention . The mice that are of concern for hantavirus -- deer and harvest_mice -- tend to be found in open , chaparral areas , Challet says . &quot; They ' re not like the typical , urbanized house_mouse , which is indoors. &quot; However , homeowners in areas of new construction near open fields should probably be more aware of controlling rodents on their property . * Most of the rats in Orange County are the roof , or fruit , variety . Although they primarily feed_on plants , vegetables and fruit , &quot; They ' ll eat anything , &quot; Challet says . &quot; If you have them in your yard , you ' ll often find crushed up snail shells. &quot; Seeing them on fences or scurrying across wires may make_it appear as though the neighborhood ' s being invaded , but more_than likely the occupation began long ago . &quot; Rats and mice are nocturnal ; once you start seeing them during the day , that ' s usually a sign that the population is at a pretty good size , &quot; Challet says . &quot; They generally have a main nest and a_few auxiliary nests covering two or three properties on a block. &quot; &quot; It doesn ' t take long to walk through your house and yard and pick_out areas where rats and mice can thrive , &quot; Challet says . Barbara ' s rat problem was traced to an old storage shed in her back yard . &quot; There were some boxes of books and magazines in one corner that were too heavy for me to move ; they had been there for years , and that ' s what the rats called home , &quot; she says . Her scenario was typical of those encountered by rodent specialists . &quot; They ' ll tend to nest indoors , out of the elements , &quot; O ' Connor says . &quot; I once found an old desk that was tucked_away in a garage . Rats had filled_up the drawers with dog_food they had collected and stored away. &quot; Homeowners with cats often believe that they live with an effective rodent exterminator . While felines are natural hunters , they ' re not always successful against rats and mice . &quot; They may be more effective against mice , since they ' re smaller , but cats don ' t always do so well with rats . Every second or third home probably has a cat , yet we still have a growing rat population , &quot; Challet says . Generally , pets are only in danger from a rodent if they ' re bitten , but that ' s not common because rats and mice tend to avoid larger animals such_as dogs and cats . If you do have pets , be aware that a common dinner spot for rodents is the half-empty pet_food bowl . &quot; Bring the bowls in at night , &quot; Challet says . &quot; Otherwise you ' re just inviting them to your property. &quot; The best way to keep rodents at_bay is to eliminate as_many places as possible where they find shelter and food . Any rodents in or around the house should be trapped and removed . An independent exterminator or Vector Control technician can advise you on the best course of action in your situation . Keeping rodents out of your home and yard means putting the &quot; S &amp; S &quot; method into action , O ' Connor says . &quot; You need to seal the outside of your home to prevent them from gaining entry and sanitize your yard to keep them from finding easy food sources. &quot; If you keep garbage_cans or bins outside , check the lids . &quot; If the cover isn ' t on tight , you ' re basically just putting food out for them , &quot; Challet says . Pay special attention to composting bins , making_sure the material is inaccessible from the outside . Heavy vegetation should be thinned_out , and fruit that has dropped from trees and ripe vegetables should be routinely picked . &quot; If you have a severe infestation , you may have to pick your trees and vegetable_garden clean , &quot; O ' Connor says . &quot; The key is to discourage them from finding any food in your yard. &quot; Rats are known for their love of avocados , and it ' s been said that after eating them they ' re immune to poison . &quot; that ' s just a myth , &quot; Challet says . &quot; Avocado has Vitamin_A , which is an antidote to anti-coagulant poisons , but there ' s not enough Vitamin_A to help them , and even if there was , other poisons would be just as effective. &quot; Preventing rodents from entering the house means carefully examining any possible entrances . &quot; A rat can squeeze into a space only half-inch big , &quot; Challet says . &quot; And a mouse can get_into even smaller gaps . One of the best things to do is attach a sweep to the bottom of your garage door , creating a seal that keeps rats out. &quot; Vents leading to a crawl space should be checked , as well as areas where pipes enter and exit walls . &quot; These are often not sealed correctly during construction . You don ' t want to leave any gap for a rodent to travel through , &quot; O ' Connor says . Roof vents are vulnerable because they ' re harder to inspect . Make_sure that screens are intact and that areas where the roof line comes_together are sealed . * Only about 10 % of complaints to Vector Control are for rodent problems inside a house , although that figure climbs to about 15 % during the winter , Challet says . &quot; Like any mammal , when it ' s cold , they ' ll go here it ' s warm. &quot; After a house has been sealed , indoor rats and mice are generally eradicated through trapping , although the techniques differ . &quot; Mice are relatively easy to trap ; they ' re curious about anything new in their area , &quot; Challet says . Rats are very suspicious by nature , making trapping a more involved technique . &quot; What ' s called ' pre-baiting ' is done , &quot; Challet says . &quot; The trap is put_out with a bait like peanut_butter , and it ' s left in their area for a_few nights unsprung . After they become accustomed to it and eat from it , the trap is set. &quot; Setting_out poisons might kill a rodent , but they can lead to complications after the pest has died . &quot; If it gets_in behind the wall , it can be a problem getting_it out , &quot; O ' Connor says . &quot; The exterminator finds it by the odor , which isn ' t pleasant. &quot; Another unfortunate effect after a nest of rats or mice is removed from a home can be mites . &quot; People will often find them after the rodents have been destroyed , &quot; O ' Connor says . &quot; Generally the attic or wherever the nest was is fumigated to kill the mites as well. &quot; * Ridding Orange County of rodent problems may be too idealistic , but the Vector Control District says that by educating homeowners about rats and mice , the problem can be lessened . &quot; The homeowner really has to be determined to keep them out , &quot; Challet says . &quot; But first , they probably have to accept that they ' re not coming from the guy across the fence. &quot; Ground_Covers With Bad Taste If you want to attract rats , plant Algerian ivy -- the familiar , large-leaf variety . Rats not only love it as shelter but as food . It also harbors snails , another rat delicacy . If you don ' t want to attract rats , plant these ground_covers instead : Bronze ajuga ( Ajuga_reptans atropurpurea ) -- Bronze-colored leaves , blue flowers , two to four inches tall , hardy , sun or light shade . Giant ajuga ( Ajuga crispa ) -- Large , very hardy , metallic-colored leaves , blue flowers , up_to nine inches tall , sun or shade . Chamomile ( Anthemis_nobilis ) -- Turf up_to six inches tall , can be mowed , good around stepping stones or walkways , pleasant fragrance , sun only . Creeping speedwell ( Veronica repens ) -- Dense , green leaves with blue flowers , hardy , up_to six inches tall , sun or light shade . Creeping thyme ( Thymus serphyllum ) -- Small , light-green leaves with lavender , white or pink flowers , up_to four inches tall , sun . Dichondra ( Dichondra repens ) -- Usually a lawn plant , can reach three inches in_height and withstand moderate foot_traffic . Germander ( Teucrium_chamaedrys ) -- Bright-green foliage , resembles mint , spreads rapidly , lavender flowers , up_to 10 inches tall , sun . Goldmoss stonecrop ( Sedum_acre ) -- Hardy , succulent evergreen , sun or shade , three inches tall . Hahns ivy ( Hedera_helix ) -- Good for erosion control , sun or shade , up_to a foot tall .
