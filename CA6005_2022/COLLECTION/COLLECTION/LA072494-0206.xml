   <HEADLINE> SCOTT HARRIS : SELLING SPACE , THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Say you are in the market for a dog to herd your cattle . The San Fernando Valley Fair is one place to shop . Here , you will find all sorts of things for_sale . People will sell you a look_at a miniature horse or a giant pig . They will sell you cotton_candy or a bungee jump or a game of Whac-a-Mole and a chance to win a prize . Here , at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank , there are booths that sell telephone_services , newspaper subscriptions and real_estate . Foot_soldiers of the Democratic and Republican_parties will try to sell you on their candidates . And at another booth , people are selling space , the final frontier . The folks from the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena are the Trekkers of fact , not fiction . They are scientists , engineers and technicians , mostly , but they also work in marketing . We are their customers , and we always want to be reminded that the billions and billions of dollars invested in space exploration are worth it . At any fair , and this one ends today , showmanship is a necessity . And that ' s why Kathleen Spellman , an uplink system engineer for the Mars Pathfinder , wanted to show children how to make a comet . It ' s sort of like a cosmic mud pie . The ingredients call_for several small chunks of frozen carbon_dioxide , one cup of dirt , a dash of vinegar for the acetic_acid , and a_few drops of Worcestershire sauce to provide carbon . Wearing thick gloves to guard against frostbite , Spellman places the ingredients in a plastic sack , squeezes them together and . . . BOOM ! Well , now , that wasn ' t supposed to happened . &quot; Don ' t touch it ! &quot; she warns children curious about something that resembles snow but is much colder . Spellman herself had been sprayed with bits of frozen carbon_dioxide and Worcestershire . This bag , she concludes , had been used once too often . Gas rising from the comet stew produced the effect . She tries again . This time , there is no explosion . This time , the children are shown a dirty white clump that smells funny . &quot; It looks_like cauliflower , &quot; someone says . &quot; It looks_like a brain , &quot; says someone else . Now just imagine frozen clumps that are the size of mountains , hurtling through space and smashing into Jupiter . Now those are serious booms . The people at JPL are thrilled with the drama of the comet known as Shoemaker-Levy 9 . Such amazing fireworks , plus the 25th anniversary of the lunar landing , are enough to make grown-ups look_to the sky with the awe and wonder natural to children . The sales pitch is easier when the cosmos and history are pitching_in . &quot; The timing is perfect , &quot; Spellman says . It ' s perfect because , beginning with the Challenger tragedy , the space_program has had to answer_for so_much failure . NASA , the government_agency for which JPL does much of its work , has had to explain such troubles as the malfunction of a major antenna on the $ 1.5-billion Galileo space_probe , the defective lens on the $ 2-billion Hubble space telescope ( later repaired in a shuttle mission ) and , most dramatically , the disappearance of the $ 1-billion Mars Observor . NASA lost contact with it 450 million miles from Earth . At the fair , the folks from JPL prefer to dwell_on the successes . There are , Spellman explains , tangible benefits that far exceed Tang . The technology developed for space exploration , she says , has resulted in many medical advancements , in robotics that benefit industry and optics that help the near-blind to see . &quot; We find so_much about our own planet when we study others , &quot; adds Taguhi Arakelian , who works as a support scientist on the Galileo space_probe . A study of Venus provided us with a better understanding of the &quot; greenhouse_effect , &quot; which is warming the Earth ' s atmosphere , she points_out . &quot; From a selfish point_of_view , we can take better care of_our_own planet. &quot; Then there are the intangible benefits . &quot; We ' re always looking_forward , &quot; Spellman says . &quot; Space exploration gives you hope for the future -- the hope than we can influence the future. &quot; * Still , there are always skeptics . One elderly man who visited the JPL exhibit pointed_out that &quot; some people &quot; wonder whether Neil Armstrong really did make that giant step . Then he muttered something about conspiracies and the ability of &quot; Hollywood studios. &quot; &quot; I hope you don ' t believe that , sir , &quot; Arakelian said , as polite as could be . And now there ' s talk that we ' ve thrown so_much debris into orbit that a space_station may be too risky . The question that is asked is : Why bother ? Why ? Actually , the cosmic version of that question -- the ultimate &quot; Why ? &quot; -- is precisely the reason we ' re out there . A quest_for understanding , for discovery , is deep in the species . Taryn Wolfe , a 9-year-old fifth-grader from Tarzana with plans to be &quot; an actress , singer , veterinarian and doctor , &quot; was rapt as JPL worker Rick Shope described efforts under way to send two space_probes toward Pluto . The launch is set for the year 2001 . The probes will reach Pluto and its moon , Charon , in 2008 . The fountain_of_youth , by all best evidence , is a myth . But regular doses of wonder and awe aren ' t a bad substitute . A child ' s fascination with space , Shope said , usually ends in the teen-age years , when other subjects come_to_the_fore . Taryn ' s 14-year-old brother , Brandon , and his pal Michael Fox , also 14 , proved Shope ' s point . They could stand only a_few minutes of this Pluto stuff . You don ' t come_to the fair to learn about Pluto , they explained . And you don ' t come for the rides and games . You come_to look_for girls . It ' s all a matter of discovery Scott Harris ' column appears Tuesday , Thursday and Sunday .</TEXT>
