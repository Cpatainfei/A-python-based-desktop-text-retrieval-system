   <TEXT> Manson Controversy Sparks State Bill : Responding to controversy over the inclusion of a song by mass_murder mastermind Charles Manson on the Guns N ' Roses album &quot; The Spaghetti Incident ? , &quot; State Sen . Charles M . Calderon ( D-Whittier ) has introduced a bill that would prohibit convicted criminals from financially benefiting from their crimes . Although Manson ' s album royalties will go_to the son of one of his victims under a court ruling , Calderon noted that Manson has received &quot; thousands of dollars in royalties &quot; from T-shirt sales . &quot; The state should do everything possible to prevent criminals from earning money simply because they became famous from the commission of a heinous crime , &quot; Calderon said . The bill would expand the existing &quot; Son of Sam Law , &quot; which places money from the sale of autobiographies or interviews in a trust_fund for court-appointed beneficiaries , to include all proceeds collected as a direct or indirect result of notoriety from crime . * The Final Figures -- What Recession ? : As predicted , 1993 turned_out to be a banner year for the music industry with sales of albums and singles in the United States jumping to an estimated 683 million units -- a 4.3 % increase over last year , according to year-end figures released by the New York research firm SoundScan . Thanks to an 8 % surge in sales of compact_discs , industry sources estimate that record companies last year grossed in the neighborhood of $ 9 billion in domestic revenues . TELEVISION Shake-Up at ABC : Emily Rooney has been replaced as executive producer of ABC ' s &quot; World News Tonight With Peter Jennings. &quot; Rick Kaplan , executive producer at the network ' s &quot; PrimeTime Live , &quot; will take_over the nightly newscast , while ABC producer Phyllis McGrady takes_over &quot; PrimeTime Live. &quot; Sources at ABC said Rooney , who joined ABC News in May , had alienated staffers with her management style . There was also said to be some concern about recent ratings gains by &quot; NBC Nightly News. &quot; Rooney will be offered a new assignment at ABC News . * Wilson Draws Viewers : Bucking conventional wisdom that Southern California TV viewers aren ' t interested in state politics , about 555 # 000 households tuned_in to the complete live coverage of Gov . Pete Wilson ' s State of the State speech Wednesday on KCBS-TV Channel 2 and KNBC-TV Channel 4 . The combined ratings figures easily made_it the most-watched program in the 5-5:30 p.m. slot , according to the A.C. Nielsen Co . By comparison , when Wilson ' s speech a year ago was carried only by KCAL-TV Channel 9 , it drew only 139 # 000 households and was the lowest-rated program in its time_slot . * The Return of Chuck : Chuck Henry , former veteran KABC-TV news anchor and &quot; Eye on L.A. &quot; producer and host , has landed at KNBC-TV Channel 4 as an anchor-reporter . Henry , who has been reporting for the station all week , will begin co-anchoring the 4 p.m. weekday news next week with Carla Aragon , but his permanent anchoring assignment has yet to be determined . * More Animation for Kids : More Walt Disney-style animation is in_store for kids , including two new weekly &quot; theme days &quot; set to be added_to &quot; The Disney Afternoon. &quot; Along with the already announced &quot; Disney ' s Aladdin , &quot; a 65-episode daily program based on the 1992 theatrical feature , Disney plans &quot; Monday Mania , &quot; featuring &quot; The Shnookums &amp; Meat Funny Cartoon Show , &quot; and &quot; Action Friday , &quot; with the dramatic cartoon &quot; Gargoyles. &quot; Disney ' s Buena Vista Television is spending more_than $ 50 million on the three new series . &quot; Disney ' s Aladdin &quot; is set to premiere in September , followed by &quot; Gargoyles &quot; in October and &quot; Shnookums &amp; Meat &quot; next January . PEOPLE WATCH Mickey Rourke Arrested : Actor Mickey Rourke was arrested outside his Miami Beach nightclub , Mickey ' s Place , early Thursday , after he reportedly yelled at some 75 people causing a stir outside his club and at officers who had come_to quiet the ruckus . &quot; Mr. Rourke appeared to be highly agitated , and was clenching his fist as he confronted others as well as the police_officers at the scene , &quot; the police report said . Rourke , 39 , spent a_few hours behind bars before posting a $ 500 bond . If convicted on the misdemeanor charge of resisting an officer without violence , he could face_up to a year in jail and a $ 1 # 000 fine . THE ARTS NEA Starts Cutting : The National Endowment for the Arts is eliminating two of its programs -- the $ 150 # 000 Professional Theater Training Program and the $ 300 # 000 Dance Heritage Initiative -- and greatly scaling back grants to many other arts organizations to help cope_with a $ 4.7-million reduction in the endowment ' s $ 174.5-million 1994-95 budget . The eliminated theater program benefited 16 of the nation ' s premier drama schools , while the dance program provided grants to help companies preserve dance productions on film and video tape . In an interview with the New York Times , Jane Alexander , the new NEA chairwoman , said : &quot; It ' s highly regrettable , but we have to respond to the cuts that Congress handed to us . It ' s cutting_into muscle , since it ' s been a long_time since there was any fat to cut. &quot; A spokesman said the NEA expected to announce more cuts next week . SHAUNA SNOW</TEXT>
