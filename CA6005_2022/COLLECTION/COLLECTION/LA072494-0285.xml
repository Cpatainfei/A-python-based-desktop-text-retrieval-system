   <HEADLINE> FOREIGN_POLICY REVAMP LIT FIRE OF ISRAELI TALKS ; MIDEAST : PLANNERS WERE GIVEN FREE_REIN TO RESTRUCTURE , FIND NEW APPROACHES TO PEACE WITH ARAB NEIGHBORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A year ago , as Shimon Peres and his top advisers began total restructuring of the Israeli Foreign Ministry , they agreed there should be a small group to re-examine the country ' s policy positions and explore new approaches , especially to peace with its neighbors . The instructions to the ministry ' s new political planning branch were : &quot; Be creative , be daring , be provocative , &quot; according to Yitzhak Oren , who oversaw the restructuring as the ministry ' s head of coordination . &quot; We told them , ' Slay all_the sacred_cows -- just butcher them. ' &quot; We could see a real chance of peace ahead , and we knew we needed a lot of new thinking to make_it work . . . . Today , we see some of the results. &quot; Not all_of the progress made in the peace talks_over the past year with the Palestine Liberation Organization and Jordan was_due to the new group ' s work -- the hard decisions were made by Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres -- but the unit ' s efforts reflected the Israeli determination to maintain the momentum of the peace talks with a continuing search for compromises . &quot; The test has been not to rest and not to stand_pat , but to keep pushing for those decisive , crucial breakthroughs , &quot; Mark Sofer , a Peres policy adviser , said . &quot; The decisions are made at the highest levels , as they should be in a democracy , but we have had the most free-wheeling discussions imaginable at the working levels. &quot; And Oren and Sofer credit the half-dozen members of the Foreign Ministry ' s policy planning unit with getting Israeli leaders to think in new directions , consider challenging scenarios , particularly in negotiations with the PLO . &quot; ' Don ' t repeat our ideas to us , ' Peres told them , &quot; Oren recounted . &quot; ' Tell us something new , tell us something provocative , . . . tempt us to think in new ways. ' That is very difficult for any bureaucracy to do , but it is something we had to do if we were going_to find a way_out of this very , very long conflict. &quot; The task before Israeli diplomats over the past year has been immense , both in terms of its life-or-death importance for the country and in its sheer scope and complexity -- five sets of negotiations with different partners , each with its own issues , each with its own forum , each with its own style . A former Rabin adviser compared it to &quot; solving four or five very difficult simultaneous equations , each of which is itself the sum of 10 or 20 other equations. &quot; &quot; Every time we reached an agreement with the Palestinians , we had to ask what impact it would have_on Jordan or Egypt , &quot; he said , referring to the countries that border the self-governing Palestinian territories . &quot; Every sentence we wrote with the Jordanians , we had to examine in terms of the treaty we hope one day we will negotiate with the Syrians. &quot; Since its establishment as a state in 1948 , Israel has longed for the day when it would be able to negotiate peace_treaties with each of its immediate Arab neighbors and achieve acceptance in the region as_a_whole . &quot; Shimon Peres has dedicated years of his life , decades actually , to reach this point , but far from sitting_back and savoring it , he ' s working 20 hours a day to make_sure we succeed , &quot; Sofer said . &quot; These are crucially important times , the issues are incredibly complex and sensitive , and the energy required for so many sets of negotiations is immense. &quot; At the same time , Israeli negotiators are largely drawn from diplomats , along with some soldiers and a_few academics , who have been waiting their entire career for this moment . &quot; In a sense , we have been preparing_for these talks for 45 years , &quot; Oren said . &quot; They have not caught us by surprise . The logistics , the position papers , the internal discussions -- these are things we have been trained and prepared_for . &quot; And so we were ready and we are coping because this is the moment for which we have lived -- the hope that soon we will be at_peace with our neighbors . Idealism , yes , but it ' s an ideal that gives people the energy to work 18-hour shifts and still be sharp and critical and creative. &quot; Yet all their ideas , including those of the brainstorming Foreign Ministry policy planners , are run past Peres and finally Rabin before they are put_on the negotiating table as Israel ' s position . &quot; In the end , the final coordination is done_by Rabin and Peres , especially Rabin , for every move we make must have political support among the Israeli public , &quot; a senior Israeli diplomat said . &quot; That means Rabin sits and weighs what he can sell and what he needs in return to sell it . Those are the nitty-gritty talks : Rabin sitting with Peres and then Rabin sitting_by himself. &quot; As the negotiations proliferated , this has been harder . The volume of decisions has grown and the speed of the process has accelerated : * With Jordan , Israel is negotiating a peace_treaty and agreements on economic cooperation . The issues range from ending the state_of_war between them and delineating a border to sharing water resources and cooperating on road_construction . Adjourned to Aug . 8 , the talks are expected to surge ahead after Monday ' s summit in Washington between Rabin and King Hussein . * With the PLO , Israel is working toward a much broader form of autonomy , extending self-government throughout the West_Bank , holding the Palestinians ' first national elections as well as implementing the present agreement on autonomy for the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank district of Jericho . Talks continue on an almost daily basis in the Palestinian territories or Cairo . * With Syria , Israel is discussing the framework for a peace_treaty . It will be trading withdrawal from the Golan Heights that it captured in 1967 for peace and normal relations , the terms of which are disputed . With U.S. mediation , Damascus and Jerusalem are moving to the substance of the agreement without yet settling its basic parameters . * With Lebanon , Israel has the most straightforward set of talks . It has pledged to pull all its troops out of southern Lebanon within six months of the re-establishment of the Beirut government ' s authority and presence in the border region . Agreement , however , depends_on a settlement with Syria first . * And , across the Middle_East , there are wide-ranging , multilateral negotiations , begun after the Madrid Peace Conference in October , 1991 , that seek to resolve major regional issues , such_as economic development , sharing of water resources , resettlement of refugees and arms control . They involve Israel , its neighbors and a score of countries outside the area . Although the goal is a comprehensive peace , Israel ' s strategy is to pursue agreements with each country and on each regional issue . &quot; Israel learned long ago that it could not negotiate with all_the Arabs at once , &quot; Shmuel Sandler , a political_scientist at Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv , said . &quot; These become negotiations of the ' highest common_denominator , ' and each Arab country is afraid of being seen by the others as weak or too mild , and they wind_up outbidding each other . . . . &quot; To negotiate with all_of them but separately is already an achievement , and maintaining this course of diverse negotiations will be essential to the ultimate success of a comprehensive peace. &quot; Not only are the goals of each set of negotiations quite distinct , Israelis point_out , but so are the styles . &quot; With the Jordanians , we have a foundation of understandings based on years of secret meetings between our leaders , on a working relationship along the armistice line , on common interests that don ' t need to be spelled_out , &quot; a senior Israeli diplomat said . &quot; It is almost an intimacy , if you will . . . . &quot; With the Palestinians , there is a familiarity . We have lived with one another , in sickness and health , in poverty and wealth , in war and peace , for more_than 27 years of the occupation and even longer . For the last year , we have dealt with a crisis a day , or so it has seemed . We just know each other , even if we haven ' t learned to love each other . &quot; But with the Syrians , it remains tense , remote , discussions through the Americans , demands more_than offerings . The feeling , on both sides probably , is : This is something we have to do , but , boy , we don ' t like it. &quot; As a historian of Israel ' s negotiations with the Arabs , Sandler sees a shift back from the totality pursued by the late Prime_Minister Menachem Begin in his dealings with Egypt to the step-by-step approach used by former Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger after the 1973 Middle_East War , when Rabin was prime_minister . &quot; Step-by-step suits Rabin ' s personality , and that matters because he bears the ultimate responsibility for the decisions Israel makes , &quot; Sandler said . &quot; He is suspicious by nature ; he doesn ' t trust people ; he is skeptical of new ideas and of anything that smacks of a ' breakthrough. ' Rabin , in other words , would like to see what he is getting before he goes further. &quot; Yair Hirschfeld , a Haifa University political_scientist who played a major role in the secret Israeli-PLO negotiations , said that the key element in the recent momentum has been the very success of those first moves a year ago . &quot; Nothing is more successful than success , and the Arabs want to become part of what is growing_into a dramatic success of historic proportions , &quot; Hirschfeld said . &quot; The agreement with the Palestinians continues to have an enormous psychological impact , because in solving the Palestinian issue we are removing the announced reason for the whole conflict . . . . Syria may choose to provide the capstone of the endeavor , but the Palestinians laid the cornerstone. &quot; Hirschfeld sees major international developments continuing to drive the negotiations -- factors that lie_in the background but still drive the peace process . They include the end of the Cold_War and the emergence of a new international coalition ; the defeat of radical forces during the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War and the strengthening of pragmatists in the Middle_East ; the threat of Islamic fundamentalism to the pragmatists ; the Palestinian intifada , or rebellion , against the Israeli occupation , and a realism born of 20 years of trial-and-error Mideast negotiations . Hirschfeld also sees the Rabin government willing to use its &quot; mandate for peace &quot; from 1992 parliamentary elections , a feeling of &quot; now or never &quot; among the region ' s leaders and a U.S. Administration with an interest in a foreign_policy success for its own political needs . &quot; In Israel , we have a very , very strong leadership in Rabin and Peres , &quot; Hirschfeld continued , &quot; and they are supported by younger_men with new ideas , by advisers and staffs willing to break_through the old shibboleths . The key , though , is that our body_politic wants peace , and we are finding partners on the other side. &quot;</TEXT>
