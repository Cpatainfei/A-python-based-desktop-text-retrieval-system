   <HEADLINE> SOMALIA CASTS SHADOW ON U.S. FOREIGN_POLICY ; AFRICA : ANALYSTS SAY THE MISSION MAY PROVE AN EXCEPTION TO THE PATTERN OF U.S. ACTION ABROAD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. intervention in Somalia , once heralded as a sequel to the Persian_Gulf_War against Iraq in shaping the new_world order , may turn_out instead to be the exception rather than a precedent for U.S. policy in the post-Cold War world . In a low-key , anticlimactic end to the lifesaving drama launched by President George_Bush 14 months ago under the glare of television lights , the United States on Tuesday began the final month of withdrawing its troops . The Defense_Department says it hopes to have virtually all American ground forces -- 3 # 273 of them were still left as of Thursday -- out of the country by March 25 , six days before the deadline set by Congress . The haunting initial images of stick-thin women and children have been replaced by pictures of dead American soldiers dragged through the streets of Mogadishu . And the anarchy and wanton violence that elicited intervention in the first place appear to be returning now that U.S. and European troops are leaving . For many , the Somali experience has become Exhibit A in the case for staying out of foreign quarrels , no matter how heart-rending . It is casting shadows over U.S. intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Haiti . &quot; It will clearly influence and make the United States more reluctant about decisions to undertake missions of this kind elsewhere in the world , ' former Defense_Secretary Frank Carlucci said . Most analysts differentiate , however , between the U.S.-led Operation Restore Hope , a humanitarian mission that lasted five months , and the subsequent U.N.-directed operation , which pursued more ambitious goals over the last nine months . &quot; In terms of the humanitarian mission , I ' d say it achieved its initial purpose , &quot; Carlucci said . &quot; But when the mandate changed to nation-building -- an impossible task , especially for a multilateral organization -- I ' d have to give it an ' F. ' &quot; Mohammed Sahnoun , U.N. envoy to Somalia before the U.S. intervention , agreed that Operation Restore Hope succeeded . &quot; It established a security framework for emergency relief and demonstrated that a well-organized endeavor by the United States for humanitarian purposes can have a positive impact , &quot; he said . Somalia also offers several other lessons : * Overseas missions need more precisely defined goals . This was easy during the Cold_War , when most foreign operations centered_on the singular goal of containing Communist influence . By contrast , Somalia symbolizes the absence of answers to basic questions , including long-term U.S. goals and the boundaries and rules of intervention . &quot; Somalia was set_up for failure by the terms of reference , &quot; former U.N. Ambassador Donald McHenry said . &quot; Anyone who was naive enough to believe we could go_in and simply feed people and then pull_out was fooling themselves . To follow that course would have ensured the same conditions that forced us to go_in would reoccur. &quot; When the United States intervened in Somalia , analysts said , it failed to look ahead to how it would get_out . &quot; We need greater selectivity and care in defining missions and to make_sure they ' re finite , &quot; said Robert Oakley , U.S. special envoy for Somalia and a former ambassador to that country . * The United Nations cannot be counted_on as an alternative or fall-back when unilateral involvement does not work , and the United States and United Nations must redefine their relationship to fit the post-Cold War world . &quot; Somalia was the first test for U.N. leadership in these kinds of crises of failed states , and it overreached , &quot; Oakley said . &quot; The objective in Somalia became too encompassing and too intrusive and more_than the United Nations could handle. &quot; Since 1989 , the United Nations has launched 17 peacekeeping missions around the world , compared with 13 during the entire four decades of the Cold_War . Its capacities , manpower and finances are now stretched thin . The stickiest issue in the U.S.-U.N. relationship is an international force . &quot; If we don ' t want to be the policemen of the world , and we don ' t want to take criticism for the failure of action in places like Somalia or Bosnia , then we have to come_up with some kind of credible international force as an alternative , &quot; McHenry said . This means that the United States must face_up to such uncomfortable situations as putting U.S. forces under foreign command and contributing to a U.N. reserve_fund to meet crises as they develop , he said . Consequently , he added , the United States is blocking movement toward an international force , even though such a force is in the U.S. interest . * The longer the delay in doing something about the kind of crises represented by Somalia , the higher the costs . &quot; In these kinds of crises , the international community needs to get_in early , &quot; said Michael Clough , senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations . &quot; Somalia would never have happened if attention had been paid at the time ( former President Mohamed Siad ) Barre fell_in 1990 . Everyone saw the total collapse of order coming . But everyone cut and ran . &quot; All it would have taken is a little serious political involvement and sending the right signals to the players on the ground . Instead , the reverse message was sent : Fight it out and whoever wins gets_to be the government . So it took off. &quot; * As cases of crumbling states increase , the United States should not be seen to take sides . The neutrality of the U.S.-dominated U.N. force was compromised after confrontations between U.N. troops and gunmen believed to be supporters of Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid . U.N. envoy Jonathan Howe , a retired U.S. admiral and former deputy national security adviser to Bush , ordered an ultimately unsuccessful manhunt for Aidid , complete with a reward . Singling_out Aidid , Sahnoun said , inadvertently boosted his image and following within Somalia and changed the dimensions of the operation . And the U.N. mission was seen to be assuming sovereign powers rather than allowing Somalis to judge and settle their problems . * In the post-Cold War world , U.S. leadership or preeminence can be a liability in high-profile military operations . &quot; We are going_to have to play a major role , &quot; McHenry said . &quot; But to the extent the operation is seen as an American operation , we will be the one embroiled in political difficulties when they arise , whether internationally or locally. &quot;</TEXT>
