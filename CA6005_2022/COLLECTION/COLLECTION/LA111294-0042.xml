   <HEADLINE> PENTAGON MAY BE LOSING OPERATION_CODE NAME BATTLE ; MILITARY : TITLES THESE DAYS LACK THE INSPIRING QUALITY OF ' OPERATION ANVIL , ' ' OPERATION TORCH ' AND OTHER WORLD_WAR II-ERA MONIKERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They beckon from the past , the great military battles and their still-stirring code names : Operation Overlord , the D-Day invasion of Europe . Operation Torch , the U.S. landing in North Africa . Operation Anvil , the Allied liberation of southern France . Now fast-forward to the 1990s : * The U.S. intervention in Somalia was called Operation Restore Hope . * The U.S. rescue effort in Rwanda was named Operation Support Hope . * The American intervention in Haiti is known as Operation Uphold Democracy . * And last month ' s urgent U.S. mobilization to prevent Iraqi troops from invading Kuwait again was Operation Vigilant Warrior . &quot; Not the sort of thing they ' ll remember in the year 2021 , &quot; a Pentagon strategist conceded . The disparity points to a paradox : While the quality of U.S. forces and their weapons have risen to an all-time high , the art of finding inspiring code names for what they do has become an unexpected casualty of East-West peace . Even former Joint Chiefs_of_Staff Chairman Colin L . Powell , himself no stranger to the plain-vanilla turn of phrase , found Operation Productive Effort -- the name proposed for a U.S. humanitarian aid mission to Bangladesh in 1991 -- too humdrum to let_out of the Pentagon . Defense_Department planners eventually changed it to Operation Sea Angel , but that was inspired by the Bangladeshis , who first used the term to describe the Marine helicopter pilots who delivered relief supplies . It was not always this boring . Winston Churchill , the great communicator of World_War_II , placed special importance on the need for bold-sounding code names for military operations . He favored monikers such_as &quot; Overlord &quot; -- which he approved personally -- in hopes that they might inspire Allied troops ( and presumably entice historians as well ) . In 1943 , he even laid_down guidelines that still serve as a standard for would-be battle-dubbers . The Defense_Department maintains a military-wide computer_database -- known , in typical Pentagon style , by the initials NICKA , for Codeword Nickname and Exercise Term System -- that seeks to prevent duplication by allocating specific initials to individual commands . Navy Lt . Cmdr . Edwin A . Shuman , who heads the NICKA unit , said combat commanders are assigned a series of double-letter blocks -- from EB through EW , for example -- with the first word ( say , &quot; Early , &quot; ) already provided . The commanders then fill_in the second ( Early Bird through Early Wake-Up , to continue the example ) . In a high-profile operation , the names are reviewed by the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff . Once taken , a name is not used again for another two years . All this is just to develop two-word nicknames , which are designed to inspire the troops or to send some sort of message to the public . The actual code names used by the military are only a single word long and are classified as top secret . Shuman said the services use_up to several hundred code names each year , both for combat operations and for training exercises . Some -- such_as Team_Spirit , the annual joint U.S.-South Korean maneuvers -- are given the same name year after year for greater visibility . There is a certain amount of risk in striking out too boldly in picking_out a code name . An Army Reserve unit that once tried to name a road-building venture in Honduras &quot; Operation Blazing Trails &quot; ran_into trouble when a too-literal translation came_out close to the Spanish-language name for Shining Path , the notorious Maoist guerrilla group in Peru . It was abruptly withdrawn . Still , as the evidence clearly demonstrates , too many of today ' s code names are ( a ) lackluster , ( b ) uninspiring , ( c ) not very stirring and ( d ) just plain dull . One exception -- Operation_Desert_Storm , the name given to the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War -- isn ' t bad by historical standards . But the buildup that preceded it was labeled Operation Desert Shield , a name that , perhaps justifiably , already has been all but forgotten . The name &quot; Vigilant Warrior , &quot; for the most recent U.S. deployment to Kuwait , has not found a permanent slot in many memories either and that operation took_place barely a month ago . Stephen H . Hess , a Brookings Institution scholar , pointed_out that the trend toward more lackluster code names runs counter to today ' s emphasis in government on public relations . &quot; The Pentagon is becoming more and more sophisticated at public relations , with more in-house flacks , but somehow these names sound as though they were written by committee -- and the answer is , they probably were , &quot; Hess said . &quot; ( Gen . Dwight D. ) Eisenhower probably woke_up on the morning of the operation , and said : ' I know -- we ' ll call it Torch. ' Now the code name is probably decided by an interdepartmental study group . What a comedown from before ! &quot; Although no one knows precisely when military_forces began using code names routinely , the late New Zealand etymologist Eric Partridge reported that the practice already had become entrenched during Elizabethan days , when London recorded almost 200 military code names . Partridge ' s own research showed that many of the code names of that era were applied to persons or institutions . Lord Burghley , for example , was said to have used signs_of_the_Zodiac , such_as &quot; Cancer &quot; and &quot; Leo &quot; for top officials of that day . Partridge estimated that during World_War_II the Allies and Axis powers ( Germany , Italy and Japan ) together devised more_than 10 # 000 such names . The space race has added several hundred more . Even big companies use code names today . But Soldiers , a U.S. Army publication , suggested that Churchill may have set the standard . Acutely aware of the value of symbolism in maintaining fighting spirit , he rejected names that he thought too boastful , frivolous , depressing or mundane . &quot; The world is wide , &quot; he wrote , &quot; and intelligent thought will readily supply an unlimited number of well-sounding names which . . . do not enable some widow or mother to say that her son was killed in an operation called ' Bunnyhug ' or ' Ballyhoo. ' &quot; Not surprisingly , Churchill also insisted on approving all code names personally . Sometimes code names have been designed to deceive an enemy . In 1943 the Allies dumped a corpse off the shores of Spain , with papers describing a fictitious &quot; Operation Husky &quot; to take_place there . It kept German intelligence occupied for weeks . Code names for joint U.S.-British operations came from the Combined British-United States Interservice Code Word Index , which ranged from &quot; Aaron &quot; ( the battle of Bulawatan in New Britain ) to &quot; Zouave &quot; ( an operation in White_Horse , Yukon_Territory , Canada ) . In between were names such_as &quot; Baldhead , &quot; ( the assault on Masibang , New Guinea ) &quot; Brassiere , &quot; ( the battle of Ulamaingi , New Britain ) , &quot; Fiddlestick &quot; ( an operation in Vogelkop , New Guinea ) and &quot; Yoicks &quot; ( fighting at Visayan Sea in the Philippines ) . Today ' s list is generated entirely by computer , which may explain how the selection got_to be so dull . In recent months , the NICKA program appears to have been stuck_on the words provide and restore , as in_operations Provide Comfort and Restore Hope . Some analysts suggested that what may be needed now is a new effort dubbed Operation Provide Better Choices , followed by Operation Restore Pizazz to the Pentagon ' s code names .
