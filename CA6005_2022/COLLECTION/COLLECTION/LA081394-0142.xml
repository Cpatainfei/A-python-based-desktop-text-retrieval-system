   <HEADLINE> RELIGION / JOHN DART ; ANGELS ABOUND AS THE SPIRITUAL GUARDIANS ENJOY NEW POPULARITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Angels -- whether cherubic , winged and haloed , or personal guardians , divine_messengers or emissaries of the dark side -- are making a comeback . Books on angels are enjoying spirited sales . &quot; They just fly out of here , &quot; said Leora McFarthing , manager of Barnes &amp; Noble Bookstore in Northridge . Phyllis Tickle , religion editor of Publisher ' s Weekly , thought the tide of angel books had crested some 18 months ago . Books on angels had placed 12th and 14th on the general religious best-seller list for 1993 , and a reissue of Billy Graham ' s &quot; Angels &quot; is currently 13th on an evangelical market best-seller list . &quot; But from last May through February next year , we are going_to see 35 new titles come_out , &quot; said Tickle , whose office is in Memphis . On Thursday , &quot; The Oprah Winfrey Show &quot; focused_on angels . And that night , instead of watching the KCET special &quot; In Search of Angels , &quot; 55 people showed_up for a panel_discussion on angels and demons in Northridge sponsored by the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council . The crowd matched the previous high for attendance in the council ' s series of open forums on faith . In trying to account_for the resurgence of interest in angels and other spiritual subjects , religious analysts have cited social troubles , saying they generate hope for aid from otherworldly sources , and a surprising increase in the social acceptability of talk_about spiritual matters . The interfaith discussion Thursday night at Northridge Seventh-day Adventist Church , the host church for this session , may have been representative of a growing curiosity about angels in a predominantly secular culture . Moderated by the Rev . Jeff Utter , a Congregational pastor and instructor in Cal State Northridge ' s religious studies department , the panel included a Catholic priest and a Mormon representative who affirmed their churches ' beliefs in angels and , on the other side , a Unitarian Universalist and a Zen_Buddhist , whose traditions do not talk_of angels but who were personally open_to discussion . When audience members were asked how many &quot; had had something to do with an angel &quot; in their lives , 15 raised their hands . About the same number raised their hands when asked if they had ever had a brush with evil of a supernatural sort . A man in the crowd asked the panel : &quot; Why are people more comfortable talking_about these things than they were , say , five or 10 years ago ? &quot; Keith Atkinson , California public affairs representative for the Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints , as the Mormons are formally known , said he believed that people were increasingly polarized toward either good or evil directions in their lives . &quot; Those who are becoming more good are reaching_into the depths of their soul and examining what it is they really believe , &quot; Atkinson said . &quot; You can sophisticate yourself out of the ability to feel the presence of angels , &quot; he said . &quot; I believe angels come as messengers of God with specific purposes . I have known people who have been blessed with that kind of experience. &quot; Father Andrew Diviney , a Jesuit priest residing at Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Northridge , said there is a discernible yearning for the transcendent among people today . Diviney also sees the increase in angel popularity as a cyclical phenomenon as a new generation revisits a venerable Christian tradition . &quot; As for Roman_Catholic beliefs , angels are in , demons are in . We ask angels for protection against demons , &quot; the priest said . On the skeptical but sympathetic side , Deryck True , president of the Studio City Unitarian Universalist Church , said that his creedless denomination &quot; is a standard bearer for liberal religion. &quot; True said that he believes that everything that happens is a natural_phenomenon , but added that debates about justice , good , evil and spiritual traditions are healthy for society . &quot; It ' s so easy to get mired in routine , paying bills , going_to work , &quot; he said . &quot; I applaud those who deal with what our lives mean and think_about what we are supposed to do with them. &quot; Angels are a traditional part of the world religions born in the Middle_East -- Zoroastrianism , Judaism , Christianity and Islam -- but are not prevalent in Eastern religions . Paula Jakunin Fuld , a psychologist and practicing Buddhist with the Zen Center of Los Angeles , said that the Buddhist tradition does not speak_of angels and only occasionally of demons . The offspring of a mother who was Unitarian and a non-religious Jewish father , Fuld said that at this point her life she is &quot; more interested in religion than psychiatry . &quot; Religion has an enormous gift to give people , &quot; she said . &quot; I feel an upsurge of religious feeling today. &quot; * The panel moderator , Jeff Utter , offered no comments of_his_own during the discussion , which ranged beyond angels and demons to popular accounts of near-death experiences and questions about doctrinal beliefs . After the forum ended , however , Utter , who earned a joint doctorate at Columbia University and Union Theological Seminary in New York , said in an interview that he is very interested in accounts by people who say they have been abducted by space aliens . Utter , pastor of the Congregational Church of Chatsworth , cited especially the books &quot; Human Encounters with Aliens , &quot; by John Mack , a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical_School , and &quot; Angels and Aliens , &quot; by Keith Thompson . &quot; I think there is something unprecedented happening here that has a spiritual dimension , &quot; Utter said .</TEXT>
