   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; COPTER TRAGEDY TARNISHES LUSTER OF GULF WAR SUCCESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The American &quot; friendly fire &quot; that shot down two U.S. helicopters over the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan on Thursday also blew a gaping hole in a fragile success story that has grown out of the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War . As the hours of silence lengthened after the midmorning tragedy , reports here strengthened that U.S. pilots had probably killed all four allied colonels -- American , British , French and Turkish -- who had spearheaded Western efforts to protect the 3.5 million ethnic Kurds of northern Iraq from the armies of the vengeful Iraqi president , Saddam Hussein . The helicopters carrying the colonels and the other victims crashed north of Salahuddin , an old summer mountain resort . The passengers on the doomed helicopters apparently were_due to land in the town for a lavish feast and talks with leaders of the two main Iraqi Kurdish guerrilla groups . Such meetings are usually a pleasant , monthly routine for the high-powered military_mission , which is based in a small house behind a sandbagged perimeter in Zakhu , near the Turkish border in northwestern Iraq . These are the forward elements of Operation Provide Comfort , the successor to allied operations in northern Iraq after the Gulf War . The operation ' s mission is to ensure that Hussein ' s army does not advance over front_lines with Iraqi Kurdistan and repeat the attacks that drove 1.5 million Iraqi Kurdish refugees into the wintry mountains of Turkey and Iran after the collapse of their post-Gulf War revolt . To accomplish these goals , the allies ' chief step has been to declare a &quot; no fly &quot; zone north of the 36th Parallel , incorporating most of Iraqi Kurdistan . ( Allied planes have been enforcing a similar air umbrella over southern Iraq , south of the 32nd Parallel , to protect Shiite Muslims since August , 1992. ) The allies have been enforcing the &quot; no fly &quot; edict with a force of American , French and British warplanes based in Incirlik , near Adana in Turkey . An American spokesman at Incirlik declined to say how many U.S. warplanes fly into Iraq , though the number is believed to be between 20 and 30 . U.S. helicopters are based at another Turkish air_base in Diyarbakir . Ground support crews make_up the bulk of about 1 # 700 service personnel . Under this allied protection , the Kurds have made amazing progress , considering the circumstances of the international embargo against Iraq , regional hostility and a harsh blockade from the Baghdad-controlled south . Hundreds of the thousands of Kurdish villages dynamited by Hussein ' s engineers have been rebuilt . Reasonably democratic elections have been held . An autonomous administration is gradually establishing itself -- to the extent that it stamps passports and has posted some representatives abroad . But entry signs saying &quot; Welcome to Kurdistan &quot; also send shivers in neighboring Middle Eastern states such_as Turkey , Syria and Iran . All these countries have restive Kurdish minorities , totaling more_than 20 million people ; the Kurds commonly are called the world ' s largest nation without a state . Meantime , Iraq has not given_up on its Kurdish mountains . The two main Kurdish groups said in a joint April 12 statement that they had arrested two Iraqi agents with orders to attack the few foreigners still helping or monitoring developments in Iraqi Kurdistan -- U.N. guards , workers for aid agencies and foreign journalists . Under interrogation , the two men were said to have confessed to playing a part in an upsurge in attacks on foreigners in the last month , specifically the murder of German reporter Lissy Schmidt on April 3 and the shooting and injuring of two Austrian U.N. guards on March 27 . In a separate incident , a bomb exploded in the car of a Swedish reporter , who was slightly hurt . On Thursday , Kurdish officials initially expressed their belief that the Iraqis had shot_down the U.S. helicopters as part of this campaign . Besides the smaller-scale efforts that the Kurds say they have detected , other analysts in the region also see signs of increased threatening moves by the Iraqi dictator , who has made clear his unhappiness with the U.N. Security_Council ' s extension last month of the 3 1 / 2-year-old trade sanctions that are strangling Iraq . In recent weeks , analysts say Hussein has strengthened his northern army , which rings the western and southern boundaries of the 19 # 300-square-mile , allied-protected enclave . After moving_up as_many as two divisions of his elite Republican Guard -- equipped with battle tanks and helicopter gunships , backed by other armored and mechanized infantry units -- Hussein has between 150 # 000 and 280 # 000 troops in the north , the Associated Press has said . These troops are facing 30 # 000 or so lightly armed Kurdish guerrillas who call themselves peshmerga , or &quot; those who face death. &quot; Kurdish officials , the AP said , have reported that in recent weeks many of the estimated 3 million people living_in the enclave are packing their bags and preparing to flee because they fear that the unpredictable Hussein will move against them once again . Hussein ' s brutal repression against the Kurds has sparked a global outcry . Thousands of Kurds died of starvation and exposure in the northern mountains after Hussein ' s forces crushed their rebellion in April , 1991 .</TEXT>
