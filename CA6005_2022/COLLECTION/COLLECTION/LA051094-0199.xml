   <HEADLINE> KING JAMES ; AT 36 , JAMES TRUMAN RULES THE CONDE NAST MAGAZINE EMPIRE . WILL HE FIRST TURN HIS EYE TO VANITY_FAIR ? VOGUE ? ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST ? HE ' S PLOTTING , BUT HE ' S NOT TALKING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The elevator floats upward , carrying the young dauphin of Conde Nast to the 14th floor . A too-tanned woman cosseted in Chanel enters on a lower floor and upon engaging those silent blue eyes gushes an invitation to lunch . Soon ? she swoons . Soon , he replies graciously , continuing his ascent . A modification of Ross Perot ' s great sucking sound seems to follow James Truman everywhere these days . It is the sound of sycophancy , sidling_up to him in the foyer -- even penetrating the gray of his temporary office where , strewn about and remarkably obvious to straining eyes , are several notes from Conde Nast editors . &quot; Happy First Day , &quot; writes Mademoiselle Editor Elizabeth Crow . Last month , Truman , former editor of Details magazine , succeeded 81-year-old Alexander Liberman as editorial director of S.I. Newhouse Jr. ' s magazine empire . Over the past three decades , Liberman had masterminded a vision for the 13 magazines by using a remarkable artist ' s eye and perfecting the art of intimidation . Painter , sculptor , pragmatist , the Russian-born Liberman was the job . Writer , wit and Brit , now Truman is the job . &quot; Well , the job is going_to be what I make_it , &quot; Truman says . &quot; I mean the job is , as much as it has a job description , to oversee the Conde Nast magazines editorially and , in particular , to assist those that are in_trouble . And so in part it ' s to be kind of like a magazine doctor , but in the broader sense , you know , Alex made_it more_than that and I would like to make_it more_than that. &quot; The incestuous world of magazines demands more . Which magazine will he doctor first ? ( He won ' t say. ) What new technology should Newhouse experiment with first ? ( He won ' t say. ) Which editor will he burden with his attention first ? ( &quot; that ' s not my style &quot; is all he ' ll say. ) But before all that , why Truman in the first place ? Why , of all_the members of Newhouse ' s senior_class , did he pick this fair-haired boy of 36 to be his ears and eyes and oracle of good taste ? Clearly , Newhouse prefers people he knows , and Truman ' s appointment was not exactly the result of an international dragnet . There were half_a_dozen editors he might have selected and not everyone in the lunchroom wanted the job . Rumors are that Newhouse was turned_down by Tina Brown of the New Yorker and her husband , Harry Evans of Random House . Yet Truman may be a logical choice . His friends insist that he is a pop culture divining rod who can package a sensibility . So perhaps he ' ll help Newhouse storm the youth market and escort Conde Nast into the information age , where it has yet to aggressively venture . And , Truman is immensely charming in a kind of self-effacing , watery way that is suspect at first , yet convincing after awhile and then suspect again . Friends and Details ' underlings slavishly praise him , and even if they are sometimes confused by his opaque style , they are impressed by how nimbly he moves between uptown and downtown , grit and glamour . And Truman succeeds -- although not as effortlessly as he charms . Within a three-year span , he became a star in the Conde Nast galaxy by transforming Details from painfully hip_to incredibly hot , ballooning circulation from 100 # 000 to 450 # 000 . Truman locked into the generation raised on MTV and Super Nintendo , captivating it with humor , sex and its own &quot; I-don ' t-give-a-damn &quot; attitude . But he insists that he wasn ' t brought uptown to paint all_of Conde Nast with some Generation X gloss . &quot; You know , everyone has made a great fuss about my age but , you know , I mean , frankly I ' m too old to be twentysomething . . . I mean , I ' m not worried about being 36. &quot; Older editors -- and they ' re all older -- couldn ' t help but balk . Paige Rense , the 60ish editor of Architectural Digest , was quoted as saying that if Truman bossed her around , she ' d have to &quot; spank him and send him to bed without his supper. &quot; But such rumblings were_quieted by Newhouse , and shortly after , Rense and Truman were seen having a very public lunch . &quot; All the editors are very excited about working with him , &quot; chirps Vogue Editor Anna Wintour , who brought Truman to Conde Nast . Wintour further explains why she won ' t find it awkward working for someone who once worked for her . &quot; It makes_it easier , &quot; she says cheerily . &quot; It ' s much easier for us to have someone here who we know , like and respect. &quot; Although Truman became Newhouse ' s choice , he apparently was handpicked by Liberman . They have spent considerable time together over the past year , presumably with the e minence grise passing_on wisdom to the young prince . ( They have also shopped together with Truman turning Liberman on to his favorite designer label , Comme des Garcons. ) Gabe Doppel , who was redesigned right out of the editorship of Mademoiselle by Liberman , explains that her buddy Truman has much in common with the older_man : &quot; They both observe life from the outskirts ; they both are very flirtatious ; they both have a childish sense_of_humor . &quot; But when I think_of James at_work at his hideously messy desk -- it ' s of a boy sitting behind it with his shoes off , &quot; Doppel adds . &quot; Alex was so different . He always had a clean desk with nothing on it except his folded hands. &quot; * It is still winter , February and bruising , before he has quit smoking , before he has started the new job , before James Truman has become the enigma of Conde Nast headquarters on Madison Avenue . He is still working in Details ' downtown offices , which have that unsettled feel of a college dorm . There is a Pepto-Bismol bottle on his computer , bound copies of his favorite British pop_music weekly on the shelf , a kilim rug with autumnal colors on the wooden floor and a nondescript couch . The windows are thrown open_to relieve the room of smoke and Truman is trying to entertain J-school questions about the future of American magazines and how they ' ll survive CD-ROMS . &quot; The magazines that have succeeded most recently are those that do not in any way condescend to their readers , &quot; he says . &quot; I think Allure is very good at not condescending , given the subject_matter ( beauty ) of the magazine . I think Details did the same thing . I think Spy , when it was good , did the same thing ; I think Vanity_Fair , the same . There was that belief when you picked_up those magazines that you were being treated not as a media demographic , but as a lively , intelligent , interested person. &quot; * Several Conde Nast magazines may be in dire need of re-creating that or some_other belief -- and Truman knows it . In the first three months of this year , eight of the 13 magazines saw their total number of ad pages drop dramatically compared to the same period last year . Only Allure , Self , Details and Conde Nast Traveler increased ad pages , while Vanity_Fair , Mademoiselle and others decreased . While that may_not be an indication of much more_than ad rate increases and does not necessarily explain profitability , conventional wisdom has it that several of the magazines are hurting and Truman is supposed to be part of the solution to renourish them . He is supposed to have fresh ideas ; there is supposed to be content beneath all that lambent wit and style . &quot; Advertising doesn ' t come unless you have the magazine that people are reacting to , &quot; he says . &quot; The advertiser has to feel that the magazine is connecting in a real way with its reader , which makes_it hot -- that terrible word . But you know , hot is really saying this magazine has found its reader and is involved in a very intimate dance with the reader . And I don ' t want to bring_up a rival magazine , but Harper ' s Bazaar is a great example . Its circulation is not doing at all well , but it ' s absolutely packed with advertising because advertisers fear it is connected very passionately with a group of women. &quot; But how do you make those passionate connections ? &quot; I feel that what was lost in the 1980s was that sense of voice , which is why when you read about the new Esquire , they ' re trying to take it back to what it was . Everyone is looking_back to how magazines were as if this kind of aggressive , hysterical kind of shouting that magazines did for 10 years was just an aberration . I think magazines have to find a way_out of that because I think that area is going_to be used_up by television anyway. &quot; There isn ' t a TV in Truman ' s office . There is a Sony mini-component stereo_system and piles of CDs and several photographs strewn about , including one of him and Details ' sex columnist Anka Radkovich and another of him and Kate Moss and Sofia Coppola . Truman looks almost as anemic as Moss in that picture , but it is deceptive . Although reedy and fair , he is sturdy -- an athlete , in fact . He is an ardent boxer who trains once a week . He plays tennis , stylistically awkward but aggressively , a friend says . And everything on Truman ' s face curls -- his lips , his nose , his hair . &quot; I look horrible in photos , &quot; he says as he tries to angle to get his favorite photographer to shoot him for this story . * Farther away and longer ago -- before he collected antiques and had a decorator for his roof-garden apartment in the West Village -- James Truman really was young and unformed and trying to re-create himself on the sidelines of the world of rock_music . It was the late 1970s , a time when post-punk music was exploding and Britain was again becoming the major music capital of the world . Truman was a writer for Melody Maker , an influential British pop weekly , and living_in London . Crumpled over his typewriter , he would imprison himself for days in a corrugated hut constructed within Melody Maker ' s run-down offices because of what friends gently refer to as his &quot; deadline difficulties. &quot; &quot; The most effective way to help James get his deadline met was to bring him an endless supply of doughnuts and orange_juice , &quot; says Ian Birch , then his editor at Melody Maker . &quot; James didn ' t so_much as write stories as sculpt them . But he never took a cliched route . He was always a lateral thinker. &quot; Perhaps his most memorable pieces -- and most labored over -- were_on Bryan Ferry and his group , Roxy Music . The son of a coal_miner , Ferry dressed in white dinner_jackets onstage and made an ironic statement out of everything about being a pop star . At a time when music was jagged , discordant and punk , Ferry presented an elegant , manicured sound -- the smooth music that accompanied models down runways or that filled restaurants in the 1980s . Truman admits to being attracted to Ferry ' s way of bending the world toward his own eccentric vision of it . Truman also says he probably wrote &quot; far too many stories &quot; about the rocker -- although they are now close friends who shoot pool together in Greenwich_Village . &quot; Pop stars become role_models for young writers because they obviously ring bells in their character , &quot; says Birch , publisher of British Elle . &quot; But James was too intelligent for that and it would be too simplistic to say he was writing_about himself when he wrote_about Ferry. &quot; Yet Truman emerged from a Bryan Ferry-like existence , rebelling against his class -- although in a far less dramatic way . While Ferry came from working-class Newcastle , Truman was raised &quot; middle_class &quot; in Nottingham , where his father , Derek , owned various businesses . The Trumans weren ' t landed gentry but they had money . As Ferry achingly rendered Bob Dylan as a soloist , Truman lost himself in Jack Kerouac , who cruised America and wrote_about its dark side . Yet as much as Truman was fascinated by Kerouac , he did not ignore his countrymen , such_as Evelyn Waugh . In a phone interview from the family ' s Caribbean winter home , Valerie Truman says her son owned everything Waugh ever wrote . &quot; A lot of those books are still in his room , &quot; she says . * Truman ' s room in Nottingham also reflects an earlier art . As a teen-ager , he was an avid painter ; when the family traveled throughout Europe in summers , he would spend his time sketching and painting , his mother says . A huge black-and-white mural of three Chinese men smoking hookah pipes still covers the wall of his study . He studied French at the Sorbonne and Spanish in Seville . His art also was expressed in the form of outlandish clothes , his mother adds . &quot; He didn ' t like the old tweed sport jacket and trousers . But he was always quite interested in fashion , the outlandish and weird , like silver jackets or black plastic trousers. &quot; He attended the Oundle Boarding_School , an aspirational although not first-rate school . He decided against attending a university and worked briefly in his father ' s businesses , including an engineering and aircraft firms . &quot; James tried , but he was much more artistic and creative and not into the kind of things his father was , &quot; Valerie Truman says . Instead , he spent a year at journalism school and then found jobs in London , mostly at music weeklies . The British weeklies -- with their seemingly endless amounts of space -- were the perfect proving_ground for young writers exercising their voice . But if London was the place for them to ramble_on and be celebrated as their generation ' s Oscar Wilde , New York was the place to tone it down and make some money . In 1981 , Truman came_to work in New York for the Face , a monthly music and lifestyle magazine , and his dispatches brought him recognition . Like many British expatriates , Truman came_to America because he was more dedicated and ambitious than the polite world he was raised in would allow . &quot; I hated the class system there , &quot; he says . &quot; I hated the fact that if you showed enthusiasm for things there , you were thought to be vulgar in some way. &quot; His attitude toward America , however , was also jaundiced . In one long , amusing article in the Face , Truman suggested that the growing telephone sex business was a perfect metaphor for modern America and its actions in Vietnam . &quot; Isolated , nearly invulnerable , its enemies largely self-created , America had become the lonely turret gunner , seeing the world only at a distance , lost in private , morbid fantasy , &quot; he wrote , adding that America ' s &quot; death-bed image could only be that of a man lying_in a dimly lit room , trousers round his ankles , quietly wanking to the sound of a paid stranger ' s voice. &quot; * While this writing style brought him admirers , Truman ' s personal style brought friends and patrons . Truman met Anna Wintour at a dinner_party at her home . Wintour , working as a fashion editor at New York magazine , was bowled_over by his charm but was blinded by what he was wearing . &quot; It was a tight black-and-white houndstooth-check Armani , &quot; she recalls , laughing . &quot; I went_on Anna ' s list , &quot; he says . Not long after , she became editor of British Vogue and asked him to write a piece about how he dressed . A few years later when she was editor of American Vogue , she hired him as features editor . It was 1988 and Truman took the job gladly . He had just returned from a year in Hollywood trying to write a screenplay with former Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren . Their collaboration didn ' t work and Truman says he found Los Angeles ' &quot; inertia impossible to deal with. &quot; * By 1990 , Newhouse had plucked Truman from Vogue to be editor of Details , which Conde Nast had bought two years earlier . A black-and-white guide to downtown club life , Details was to be Conde Nast ' s vehicle to younger_men and it was up_to Truman to transform it somehow , someway . It took a year -- and from Truman ' s vantage , it was a long , painful year . Perhaps the most reviled was his first issue , in which he and his art_director and close friend Derek Unglass featured a graphic photograph of a man in the electric_chair in Florida . Among the staff the photo was referred to as &quot; Roasted Head of Cop Killer. &quot; Funny as this was in the office , it didn ' t go_over well with advertisers , and for the next several editions Truman ' s critics carped that he simply was getting everything wrong . But Truman eventually found relief the old-fashioned way : He put movie_star Keanu Reeves on the cover and thousands of teen-age girls snapped it up . He also had to fire Unglass , who did not want to give_up on their original edgy concept of the magazine . &quot; Derek and James created this deconstructed , wild , very assaultive product , and Derek became a scapegoat for that , &quot; a former Details staffer says . But Truman ' s Details found readers -- the kind of guys who graduate from college and move_back into their parents ' basements and spend all their spare nights listening to music . Steve Fishman , a frequent Details contributor , says Truman had a unique but effective editing style . In one instance , he recalls Truman advising him to revise a story by &quot; running it through the postmodern blender. &quot; He then got_up and rooted around his office as if he had such an cooking_utensil . &quot; My editor and I walked_out_of the office thoroughly enthused with these high-octane bits , but then we looked_at each other and said : ' Do you have any idea what he was talking_about ? ' But then we figured_out how to put into action James ' extremely engaging conversation. &quot; Joe Conason , now the executive editor of the New York Observer , worked for Truman during Details ' first years . Conason ' s job was to assign serious journalistic efforts , which he hoped would get Details ' young readers &quot; interested in the world beyond the radio_station and mall. &quot; They ran an interview with a Polish journalist , a story on the sale of Soviet weapons in Germany , a profile of Cuban youth . But as the magazine veered toward celebrities , sex and music , Conason left . &quot; The worse insult James would make when he was killing one of my story ideas was ' Joe , that ' s such a worthy idea. ' And then he ' d laugh . And I had to laugh , too . The message was ' Don ' t weigh me down with this story. ' &quot; But Conason left with high regard for Truman : &quot; The irony of it is that James actually likes good writing , really cares about that . I ' m just not sure Generation X cares a whole helluva lot. &quot; * It was Truman ' s idea to hire a sex columnist , and when he came_across young , attractive free-lance writer Anka Radkovich , he gave her free_rein , she says . &quot; James takes chances , &quot; says Radkovich , explaining that their idea for the column was freewheeling and raw . &quot; We didn ' t want it to be a sex column like Mademoiselle or Glamour has . Those are service-type columns . We wanted to go beyond. &quot; And so she has -- with graphic descriptions of her dates and instructive columns on how to put_on condoms . In fact , unlike dowdier men ' s magazines , Details seems comfortable covering sexual lifestyles from heterosexual to gay to in-your-face androgyny . At the same time , the magazine seems to project old-fashioned advice to young_men , such_as how to get a girl into bed . It also deals with AIDS , gay politics and highly confessional stories of relationships . &quot; There ' s a high foreplay factor_in Details , &quot; says a staffer who asked to remain anonymous , &quot; and that ' s because James is interested in sex , the other editors are interested in it , and judging from the letters to the editor and faxes around the place , so are the readers. &quot; Because of the nature of the magazine and Truman ' s elusive manner , his own sexuality has been the subject of speculation . He ' s had a_few enduring romances , friends say . A highly social woman he recently dated reportedly said he dumped her , explaining that he was too busy with work to have time for black-tie parties . ( By the way , he was one of two people out of 1 # 000 at the annual PEN gala who didn ' t wear black-tie . Instead , he wore his uniform of black suit and collarless white shirt. ) Asked if he had anything interesting to reveal about his personal life Truman declares emphatically : &quot; I am heterosexual , I am single and I am not about to get married. &quot; After a contemplative pause he adds , &quot; You know , I always felt it would be difficult to be married and to be the editor of Details , because I think Details is very much a magazine for single people . But I think in my new job , I could get married. &quot; * In the same week in late March , there were two parties celebrating Truman ' s appointment as new head of the principality : one for the grown-ups and one for the kids . Si Newhouse threw the very adult , very subdued event for New York ' s media and fashion aristocracy , including Donna Karan , Calvin Klein , Naomi Campbell and Fran Lebowitz . The Details staff threw the other bash -- a long night that began at a downtown Japanese restaurant and ended at a tragically chic bar . The evening was rowdy and slightly sloppy . Small disposable cameras were placed at each table and the youthful editors , writers , assistants and hangers-on traipsed between tables posing for each other . When dessert -- fresh fruit -- was served , the managing editor had to confiscate the grapes because they were ending_up in the oddest places . &quot; Hour-glass &quot; Anka , as she is sometimes called , planted herself on Truman ' s knee . For the presentations , one editor stood_up with a cassette_player and warbled &quot; To Sir With Love , &quot; an ode of respect for the teacher . There were several rounds of sarcasm and Truman was presented a group picture taken at an elementary_school with the entire Details staff dressed in uniforms and seated behind desks with peanut_butter and jelly sandwiches and cartons of milk . Truman gave a brief speech and , although he was neither weepy nor rendering his garments , he was sentimental , say witnesses , most of whom were too drunk to remember his exact words . Apparently he reminisced about Details by referring to various covers that hang_in the lobby of its offices and how they reminded him of what was going_on in his personal and professional_life at the time . &quot; He was alternately self-aggrandizing and self-effacing , &quot; one writer said affectionately . &quot; He was soooooooo James. &quot; Yet during most of the high_jinks , Truman remained seated in the middle of it all_in his postmodern pose , watching , listening , coolly appraising and dispatching clever one-liners . One of Truman ' s young admirers described him as almost having a &quot; Warholesque quality . He has that passive quality that you read Warhol had that makes people feel free to perform or frolic. &quot; Another noted : &quot; I think he was mysterious to begin with , but now it ' s a tactic . He loves to throw something out and see how it resonates. &quot; There is that James Truman , whom people relentlessly label &quot; elliptical , &quot; and then there is the other private , emphatically warm Truman described by intimate friends . * Henry Edwards , screenwriter and devoted friend , recalls an occasion when he joked about being broke and Truman immediately pushed a handful of cash at him . Ian Birch recalls a trip to New York during which , jet_lagged and slightly ill , he had to be put_in a cab and sent home by Truman . &quot; He was very generous , very concerned , very caring. &quot; Although Gabe Doppel doesn ' t appreciate Truman ' s choice of gifts -- he once gave her fish kettle -- she says that when she was going_through her worse times at Mademoiselle , she would call Truman &quot; 15 times a day and he would take my call every time. &quot; But even close friends say there is always a part of him that remains in the shadows . &quot; He doesn ' t want to people to pick away at the mystery of his mystery , &quot; Edwards says . Roger Trilling , yet another &quot; best_friend , &quot; says that after a decade of knowing Truman , &quot; I still don ' t know him , but I know enough . We talk_about life , we talk_about girls , we talk_about getting older. &quot; And when Truman wrote his final message to the thousands of Details readers who helped launch this latest career climb , he showed that when facing the possibility of emotion , it is always safe to be cool -- and to talk_about sex . &quot; I hate goodbys but let me try this , &quot; he wrote in the April editor ' s note . &quot; I thank_you beyond words for making this magazine a success and in the process making the last four years the greatest adventure of my life . It has felt_like struggle and it has felt_like love . I ' m sorry we never got_to sleep together. &quot;</TEXT>
