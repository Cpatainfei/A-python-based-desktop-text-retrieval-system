   <HEADLINE> HEADSTRONG ARMSTRONG ? ; AMERICA ' S BEST CYCLIST SINCE LEMOND WILL SUCCEED OR FAIL ON OWN TERMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Being an expatriate is seldom easy . Lance Armstrong , a Texan with a treble twang and cowhide-toughness , has discovered just how desperate one can get_on the lonely road to nowhere . As a professional cyclist , Armstrong is stationed for half the year in Cuomo , Italy , in the bucolic Lake District north of Milan . One day last year , he and members of the American Motorola team flew into Milan after a race and found exactly no one waiting to take them to Cuomo . No problem , they thought . They simply donned some cycling clothes , stored their luggage , assembled their racing bikes and pedaled away . Normally , it ' s a two-hour ride for world-class riders . that ' s nothing . But this late spring afternoon was turning_out to be something . After negotiating the_pitted , clogged streets of Milan , the cyclists encountered a little drizzle . Then a little rain . Then lots of rain . They kept pedaling . It started to hail big , icy balls . They kept pedaling . The hailstones left welts on their arms and foreheads , but they finally made_it to Cuomo . &quot; I swore I would never live_in Italy again , &quot; Armstrong recalled . Armstrong is living_in Italy again and plans to continue to do so every year during the spring and summer months , when he is spinning across Europe as America ' s best road racer since Greg LeMond . In his rookie season last year , Armstrong won the world road racing championship in Oslo , Norway , by sprinting past the sport ' s biggest names in the final kilometers . He became the only American beside LeMond to have won the prestigious event , elevating his stature far beyond expectations . Everyone should have known better . It was enough of a struggle to acclimate to Italian culture , much less become a dominating figure on the cycling scene in a year ' s time . So when Armstrong , 22 , lines_up to defend his world championship Sunday in Sicily , it will be the climax to a disappointing second season . Perhaps most frustrating was his failure to win America ' s premier event , the Tour Du Pont , last May . Motorola put great emphasis on winning it , but Armstrong was second to Viatcheslav Ekimov when the Russian gained a large advantage during the first time trial . Armstrong ' s best race also ended in disappointment . He placed second in the Liege-Bastogne-Liege one-day classic last April when Eugeni Berzin of Russia sprinted past him about four kilometers from the finish . Armstrong was among the top 10 during the early stages of the Tour de France , but dropped_out before the serious mountain climbs . Motorola coaches said they had planned it that way . They did not want his confidence to erode with devastating defeats in the_French Alps . Their idea is to bring him along slowly . But cycling purists cared little about development and youth . They expected Armstrong to ride like a world champion as long as he wore the special rainbow-striped jersey signifying his stature . That meant finishing what he started -- no matter what . That jersey has done_in others . No matter what event -- whether a major spring classic or an out-of-the-way local race -- the man in the rainbow jersey will be chased , shadowed and boxed every kilometer of the route . The pressure is nerve-racking , particularly if the cyclist is struggling and a threat to no one but himself . After winning the world championship last August , Armstrong wanted to show he was worthy of the jersey . So , by the time the season began in January with a tour in Mexico , he was exhausted . The O-word was blamed . He had overtrained . &quot; I just said , ' I can ' t ride bad with the rainbow jersey , ' Armstrong said last spring . &quot; I shot myself in the foot. &quot; There was more to it than the pressure of fulfilling competitive expectations . By virtue of his title , Armstrong was thrust into the forefront of the American cycling scene . Taking the torch from LeMond , a three-time Tour de France winner , increased the tension . LeMond had given the sport a boost in the United States since 1986 , when he won his first Tour . But when he lost his edge_in 1992 , the industry was desperate for a new face to fill the void . At 22 , Armstrong was not ready to assume the role . A convert from the triathlon , he needed time to mature in the comfort and obscurity of his Motorola teammates . His first year , after all , had been a long , difficult climb . Everyone remembers the World Championships , but 12 months earlier Armstrong had felt the sting of disappointment by placing 14th at the Barcelona Olympics , where he had been favored . Then , in his professional debut shortly thereafter , Armstrong finished last among 111 competitors at the San Sebastian Classic in northern Spain . As he struggled up the final ascent , Spanish fans lining the road mocked him . Hanging on was his first victory . After that , he began improving , little by little , on_the_roads . And then came the notice in 1993 . And soon the rainbow jersey . And that only brought trouble . &quot; All you hear from these guys , ' Oh , the curse . The rainbow jersey weighs 20 pounds , ' &quot; Armstrong said . &quot; I got really scared and worried about that . I was not going_to let anything interfere with my training. &quot; So , on &quot; Lance Armstrong Day &quot; in Austin last winter , Armstrong could not be found during the ceremony . He was cycling . Episodes such_as that gave Armstrong a bad reputation when all he was trying to do was protect himself . &quot; A lot of people forget that I ' m just 22 , &quot; he said . &quot; They are expecting you to be a 40-year-old politician. &quot; That has never been his style . He ' s always had the tact of a bowling shirt . Armstrong went_to Europe with Texas bravado , telling the cycling press how he would overwhelm the Euro competition . Those who had ridden for years on the circuit were a bit insulted . They wanted more humility from an American . Armstrong might never replace LeMond as a cycling icon , but he will compete on his terms . What is best for the sport ? &quot; Is it a guy who wears his helmet every day ? &quot; Armstrong asked . &quot; Is it a guy who never says a bad word ? Is it a guy who has no character ? Or is it a guy who wins races ? &quot; I ' m not going_to be everybody ' s dream boy . I ' m going_to win bike races and if that ' s your dream , then I ' m your dream. &quot; Just when it seems he is finished , he isn ' t . &quot; Cyclists as_a_whole are just not exactly cutting-edge-type people . I don ' t want to say they ' re nerds , but they don ' t understand personalities very well . &quot; I certainly don ' t want to be Charles Barkley . Deion Sanders is not the answer either . You have to have a personality , but you also have to have some ( decorum ) . &quot; LeMond , who handled outside pressures as well as any world-famous athlete , sees a younger version of himself in Armstrong . LeMond said that before a hunting accident in 1986 altered his career , he wanted to win every race he entered . &quot; Just like Lance , &quot; he said . His advice to Armstrong : Start picking objectives because it is impossible to succeed in all facets of cycling . For LeMond , that meant foregoing the spring classics to win the Tour de France , which led to greater spoils and plenty of criticism that he was not a complete racer . Armstrong may do the opposite . So far , he has shown more potential in the one-day races than in the major tours . Time will tell . Armstrong still is serving an apprenticeship . But he is trying . Since breaking_up with a Texas girlfriend , Armstrong has spent the season with a Dutch rider , Danielle Overgaag . That has helped . So has the familiarity with the cultural milieu . &quot; It ' s becoming less foreign to me , &quot; he said , his twang sounding softer around the edges . It might never replace Texas , but for now , it is home . So , he keeps pedaling .</TEXT>
