   <HEADLINE> SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE : MAIER ' S DEATH REKINDLES OLD DEBATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It can only be hoped that Austrian Ulrike Maier ' s violent_death last Saturday on the downhill course at Garmisch-Partenkirchen , Germany , will raise the decibels on what has been a lopsided debate between racers and the International Ski Federation ( FIS ) over skier rights . To mostly deaf ears , World Cup racers have been complaining about their lack of involvement in course design and safety . As it stands , FIS , the sport ' s heavy-handed governing body , basically lays_down the law : If it determines that a race course is safe , skiers are obliged to hurl their bodies down hills , sometimes to their death . It remains unclear whether the course on which Maier -- a two-time world champion and mother of a 4-year-old daughter -- met her fate was in any way responsible . Course officials at Garmisch maintain that Maier crashed on one of the safest portions of the downhill . Rain earlier in the week froze the course and made_it extremely fast . Typically , downhill racers prefer a hard , fast track . Maier crashed , it appeared , when her right ski stuck_in a patch of softer snow and caused her to lose balance . Some skiers had a different definition of safe . &quot; It was like sheer ice , like trying to survive your way down , &quot; Krista Schmidinger of the United States said in a statement released afterward . Schmidinger was the next skier down the_hill after Maier . American Picabo Street objected to the use of PTX3 , a chemical spread on the course earlier in the week to keep the snow from melting . Street said it made the surface uneven , slick in some spots and sticky in others . &quot; It ' s really getting_out of hand , &quot; said Hilary Lindh , winner of Wednesday ' s downhill at Sierra_Nevada , Spain . &quot; The ( FIS ) are so desperate to get races off , for the money involved and the TV coverage , and sponsors , they ' re almost putting that in front of everything else . I hope the point has been made. &quot; FIS officials have suggested slowing courses down , a plan that skiers would reject . They want the courses safer , not slower . &quot; Downhill is supposed to be fast , &quot; Lindh said . &quot; If not , it ' s got_to be called something else. &quot; Under the best conditions , downhill racing at 60 m.p.h. is a crap shoot . It ' s a risk all skiers accept . &quot; It ' s a dangerous sport , &quot; Bob Beattie , TV analyst and former U.S. ski team coach , said this week from Aspen , Colo . No one argues the point . Given ever-changing weather , creating a race course to satisfy everyone would be next to impossible . But shouldn ' t the skiers at least have some voice in the_matter ? If a large chunk of pavement came loose from the oval at the Indianapolis 500 , but organizers said go_ahead and drive_around it , would drivers object ? The question begs , How would skiers handle more rights ? &quot; It ' s hard , because we ' re not objective sometimes , &quot; Lindh said . &quot; At the same time , we ' re the ones going_down the_hill ; we should have a little input. &quot; All skiers want is some consistency , a standard by which courses are measured . What they get is a double_standard . * The two faces of FIS : Last Saturday ' s race continued even after Maier ' s tragic fall . Earlier this month , at Altenmarkt , Austria , FIS officials waited until 26 of 32 racers crashed near the finish area before halting the race . Yet , last year , a downhill race at Aspen , in which American AJ Kitt was leading , was abruptly canceled because of a small but fixable hole , according to skiers , that developed on the course -- a course designed not by skiers but by organizers . Given the generally poor snow conditions throughout Europe this winter , getting a course in shape is admittedly no easy chore . But despite almost perfect early-season racing conditions in America , the FIS plods on through Europe on sheets of ice and bedrock . Beattie , who helped found the World Cup , said the FIS generally does a good job in preparing World Cup courses . But is good good_enough ? Years ago , when Beattie formed his own professional ski tour , he handed all responsibility for safety and course concerns to the racers . Shifting early-season races to North_America would also solve a lot of problems , but one must never forget that the World Cup is a circuit operated by and for Europeans . &quot; It ' s tough , &quot; Beattie said of racing overseas . &quot; ( The elevation ) just isn ' t high enough . They don ' t have as good man-made snow ( as in this country ) , and often it ' s not cold enough to make snow . People who ski at Mammoth would have a hell of a time skiing in Europe. &quot; Beattie said conditions in Europe typically get better in February and March . So , naturally , after the Olympics , the World Cup will move to North_America for events that include women ' s races at Mammoth Mountain and the World Cup_Finals at Vail , Colo . The death of Ulli Maier will only further galvanize skiers . Last spring , a group of the top women ' s skiers boycotted training runs_on the Olympic downhill course at Hafjell , Norway , claiming the course was too easy . The protest led to a change of venue . The women ' s downhill will now be run at Kvitfjell , site of the men ' s race . It is perhaps too harsh to hang the death of Maier on course officials . Death , sadly , is part of the skiing game . That said , giving skiers a stake in the decision making would , if nothing else , provide some peace_of_mind when the gates open . As it is , Ulli Maier knows a different peace now . Skiing Notes Friday ' s storm has made_for the best ski conditions of the season in the local mountains . The Big Bear resorts and Mountain High in Wrightwood , operating most of the winter on the strength of man-made snow , have received up_to a foot of fresh powder . . . . Mt . Baldy reported eight to 12 inches of new snow , allowing it to open one advanced run from the top on Chair No . 3 , with other runs due_to follow . . . . Big Air Green Valley , the snowboard-only area in Running Springs , resumed operation last weekend and reports 90 % of its runs are open , the exception being the Half-pipe , which could open soon . . . . Ski Sunrise in Wrightwood has also reopened and is operating beginner and intermediate runs while offering a discounted lift-ticket of $ 20 this weekend . . . . Mt . Waterman and Kratka Ridge , both in the Angeles National Forest , report that they are close to opening but need a_few more inches of snow . . . . Chains were required Friday on most mountain roads at the 4 # 000-foot elevation . Chris T . Dropps , the USA Pro Moguls Champion , will compete today at Snow Summit in Big Bear , this week ' s stop on the Budweiser Mogul Series . The event will be televised by ESPN at 10:30 a.m. , PST , on Feb . 13 . . . . Wrightwood will stage its Winter Carnival next Saturday . The schedule of activities -- ski and snowboard races , ice sculptures , sled races and more -- will take_place at Wrightwood Village locations and at Mountain High and Ski Sunrise . . . . For the first time in four seasons , two Americans met in a Women ' s Pro Ski Tour final last weekend at Keystone , Colo . Lynda McGehee of Boulder , Colo. , defeated rookie Sally Knight of Waitsfield , Vt. , to win the slalom of the $ 30 # 000 event . How big is cross-country_skiing in Norway ? An estimated 70 # 000 lined the trails of a recent World Cup race in that nation . The first Olympic event to sell_out was not figure_skating , but the men ' s 4x10-kilometer relay . It is estimated that thousands of fans will sleep_in the woods to secure spots along the Olympic cross-country trails . . . But don ' t expect the Norwegian Alpine team to be a flop , either . Last weekend , Kjetil Andre Aamodt won his first World Cup downhill at Chamonix , France , while Norway took the top three spots in the combined , with Aamodt winning . The U.S. Olympic Alpine team will be named Sunday . Paul Major , U.S. Alpine director , will make the announcement from Oslo . The most notable racer on the U.S. bubble is 1992 Olympic giant slalom silver medalist Diann Roffe-Steinrotter , who is fighting for a spot in super-G and GS . A maximum of 22 U.S. skiers will be chosen , with no more_than 14 of one gender . . . . Hilary Lindh ' s downhill victory Wednesday at Sierra_Nevada , Spain , was the first for an American woman on the World Cup circuit since 1986 , when Pam Fletcher won at Vail .</TEXT>
