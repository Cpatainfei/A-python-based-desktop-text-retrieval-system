   <HEADLINE> SALVADOR WATCH ; NEW LEADER , OLD FEARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Armando Calderon Sol , president-elect of El_Salvador , takes_office amid high hopes and deep questions . About 10 % of El_Salvador ' s electorate was prevented from voting in recent national elections , but even Ruben Zamora , the losing candidate , does not claim that a cleaner election would have given him victory.The questions are rather about what Calderon will do after his inauguration . The new president was the candidate of the extreme right-wing party , Arena , hand-picked for the role by the late party leader Roberto D ' Aubuisson . Though Calderon , unlike D ' Aubuisson , has not been directly implicated in war_crimes such_as the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero , he was certainly close enough to war_criminals to make him -- far more_than outgoing President Alfredo Cristiani -- a figure of fear on the left . Those of his supporters who regard Zamora ' s party and its leftist coalition allies as &quot; communists &quot; might well welcome a return to D ' Aubuisson ' s methods . But there is little doubt that Calderon owes his impressive 2-1 electoral mandate to his success in persuading the voters that he would deliver what both candidates promised : namely , the continued implementation of the U.N.-brokered peace accord that ended El_Salvador ' s brutal civil_war . On the day following his election , Calderon met with Zamora , whose followers hold 21 seats in the 84-seat national assembly . U.S. Ambassador Alan Flanigan joined them . May this conciliatory first_step be followed by others in the same direction .</TEXT>
