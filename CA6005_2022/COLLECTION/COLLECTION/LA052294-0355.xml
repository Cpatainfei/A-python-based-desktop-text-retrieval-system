   <HEADLINE> YEMENI PRESIDENT VOWS TO RETAIN SOUTH ' S STRONGHOLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the eve of the fourth anniversary of a now-shattered merger between North and South Yemen , President Ali Abdullah Saleh vowed Saturday to prevent the southern stronghold of Aden from seceding . &quot; We are now tightening the ring around Aden , &quot; he declared , echoing claims that the north has repeatedly made since the war erupted more_than two weeks ago . So far , they have proved to be exaggerated . But this time , foreign reporters covering the battle for the key mountain base of Al Anad , 35 miles northwest of Aden , said southern forces were retreating there after several days of fierce combat . From the base , soldiers can control the main north-south highway . As they pulled_back in a well-organized retreat , southern troops pounded Saleh ' s brigades with artillery and air strikes , said Ron Bagnulo , a cameraman for Worldwide Television_News , who left Al Anad on Saturday . He said northern troops had moved_into Al Anad , where troops were &quot; looting everything they can get their hands on -- gasoline , mattresses , blankets. &quot; If the southern forces are pushed_out of the mountains , the way will be open for Saleh ' s troops to break_into the coastal_plain where the southern stronghold of Aden lies . Outside the port city , the south reportedly has amassed armor and artillery along with about 30 # 000 regulars and reservists in the city . It is also said to be building fortifications . Saleh , an army general who ruled the former North Yemen from 1978 until the May 22 , 1990 , merger , said the south broke a unilateral cease-fire that his government had declared would begin at midnight Friday . A reporter confirmed that the south had ignored the cease-fire . From its outpost in Hadramawt province , 200 miles northeast of Aden , the southern leadership declared Friday that the south was seceding . On Saturday , Aden Radio began broadcasting the signature_tune and the call sign that it used before the 1990 union . The merger had become increasingly strained since Vice_President Ali Salim Bidh left the capital last August in a political rift with Saleh . Bidh and his men have favored exploiting the south ' s newly discovered oil wealth , which is expected to be greater than the north ' s . Saleh ' s tight control of oil revenue was a key factor_in his feud with Bidh . &quot; After three weeks of pressure from a distance , the No . 1 objective has become the occupation of Aden , whatever it costs , &quot; Saleh told Italy ' s state-run RAI radio network in an interview Saturday . Despite Saleh ' s remarks , his foreign_minister , Mohammed Salim Basindwah , later assured diplomats the north has &quot; no intention of seizing Aden by force &quot; but will encircle it . A complete embargo would be difficult , however , because southern naval forces control the Arabian_Sea coastline and could keep sea_lanes open .</TEXT>
