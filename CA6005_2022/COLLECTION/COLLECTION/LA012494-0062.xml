   <HEADLINE> SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD ' S HARD SELL : PEACE ; MIDEAST : FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY , THE DICTATOR HAS TAUGHT HIS PEOPLE TO HATE , FIGHT AND DESTROY ISRAEL . PERSUADING THEM TO EMBRACE PEACE MAY BE HIS TOUGHEST CHALLENGE OF ALL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four-year-old Faiz Suleimani was playing with his toy pistols , pretending to kill Israelis , when his president appeared recently on the television_set in the family ' s sitting room with a historic message of peace . The Suleimanis had crowded around to hear it . Like millions of other Syrians , they were riveted to the set through the day , while Syrian leader Hafez Assad met with President Clinton in a marathon summit in Geneva . Their government had promised that the session would be a turning point in the quest_for Mideast peace . And by nightfall on Jan . 16 , Syria ' s tough military_leader delivered . For the first time in a quarter of a century of emergency rule , Assad offered the possibility of peace to them and to Israel , a sworn enemy that , until that day , he had taught his people to hate , fight and destroy . Like most Syrians , the Suleimanis were stunned . True , they said , Assad ' s message brought new hope to a nation where many believe_in only the vaguest concept of peace . For them , it was little more_than a dream , this thought_of life without costly armies and official states_of_war , a life free from poverty , international isolation and the need for authoritarian rule . But for the Suleimanis and most of Syria ' s 14 million people -- an entire generation that has lived since birth under a dictatorship that justified itself for 24 years through the belligerence of a more-powerful neighbor -- embracing that peace is quite another matter . &quot; When I was like this kid , I had nightmares about the Israelis , &quot; explained Abdul Razak Suleimani , Faiz ' s 32-year-old uncle and a former Syrian army commando . &quot; My mother said , ' Don ' t worry . When you grow_up , the problem between Israel and Syria will be finished. ' But then I grew_up . I went_into the army . I was shot in the leg . I watched many friends die . These are not easy things to forget. &quot; In Assad ' s Syria , nothing is . It is one of the most highly structured , strictly controlled societies on the globe . Here , a sophisticated regime has employed propaganda , censorship and occasional imprisonment to teach its citizens what to think , where to go and how to behave . Through it all , Syrian society has remained largely loyal , accepting almost universally the sacrifices that the regime has demanded . In place of the freedoms it denied , Assad ' s leadership provided a quarter of a century of unbroken stability -- this in a land where coups , countercoups , rampant crime and bloodshed preceded the 1970 military coup that brought his regime to power . And in exchange for mandatory military duty for all men and the vast military spending that has left much of the nation poor , Assad built an army strong enough to keep its enemies at_bay . But as the Suleimani family demonstrated on the day Assad offered a new era of peace , selling that prospect to his own people now may well be the Syrian leader ' s most difficult challenge . He must do_it at a time when the Syrians ' expectations for economic and political reform are growing for the first time since he took power . And to fulfill what Syrian and Western analysts say is among Assad ' s chief motivations to seek peace , the aging Syrian leader must do so in such a way that he retains enough power to install a hand-chosen successor ; until he was killed in a car accident Friday , most believe that individual was the eldest of Assad ' s four sons , Basil . The regime insists that selling the peace to the Syrian masses , to simple families such_as the Suleimanis , will be no more difficult than it has been to motivate them for war . Like everything else , it will flow_from Assad ' s universally acknowledged cunning and calculation . &quot; First , Israel must withdraw from every inch of the Golan Heights , &quot; said Mohammed Salman , Assad ' s information minister , referring to the strategic plateau Israel has occupied since the 1967 War . &quot; When Israel will withdraw from the occupied territories , certainly there will be some change for Syria. &quot; The return of the Golan , Assad ' s key demand in return for his offer to negotiate peace with Israel , clearly is a goal both strategic and personal for Assad . Assad was Syria ' s defense minister when the Israelis overran and occupied the Golan 27 years ago . And most veteran diplomats and Syrian intellectuals in Damascus said Assad is driven to recover the land before he dies . But those same sources added that the issue of Assad ' s successor , combined with the Syrian leader ' s personal need to solve Syria ' s growing economic disparities and mounting fiscal woes in his final years of life , is at least as strong a motivator for peace as the Golan . The most difficult of the problems Assad must attempt to solve is Syria ' s complex , often confounding national economy , which diplomats , intellectuals and families such_as the Suleimanis said is inseparable from the issue of peace . If the Golan is Assad ' s emotional selling point for peace , the promise of prosperity is the practical one for his people . At the heart of Syria ' s economic nightmare is its huge defense budget , Assad ' s massive spending on a vast military-civilian security apparatus . Western diplomats say it consumes more_than half the national budget . In the years since the collapse of the Soviet_Union -- which was Assad ' s longtime ally and supplied billions of dollars in military hardware and training -- Syria ' s defense costs have ballooned . Many Syrians hope that the regime will reroute these sums into health , education and public_services , many of which are strained by Syria ' s mushrooming population . Already , electricity is strictly rationed in Damascus . Hospitals and schools are overcrowded ; basic government services are plagued by long delays . Syria has one of the world ' s highest population growth_rates ; its population is expected to double in just 20 years , draining the public sector even more and threatening any regime that attempts to manage it . These are demographic realities well-known to Assad , who sensed the imminent collapse of his Soviet benefactors and three years ago launched a bold initiative to strengthen Syria ' s small private sector , diplomats in Damascus said . Assad ' s recent , historic peace offer came at a time when Western and Syrian economists say the regime has been walking a tightrope between its traditional , Soviet-style socialism -- which guarantees all basic needs of its people -- and its post-Soviet , free-market reform . It came at a time when , most economists and intellectuals agreed , those reforms have created a growing disparity between rich and poor , dotting Damascus ' gritty skyline with conspicuous new symbols of wealth that have served only to raise the ambitions of Syria ' s poorer masses . On the day Assad offered Israel his olive_branch , for example , there were few signs of the regime ' s liberalization policies in the lives of the Suleimanis . In a downtown district where late-model Corvettes and $ 100 # 000 luxury sedans jostle with horse-drawn carts hauling gasoline through mounting traffic_jams , the Suleimanis still drive the battered Pontiac Silver Streak the family bought new in 1948 . Only through permanent peace , families such_as the Suleimanis concluded , can that gap be bridged . The regime is also gradually releasing some control over the nation ' s mass media and giving Syrians their first taste of the West . In the last two years , the regime has permitted hotels and foreign residents to install satellite dishes ; American videotapes are now widely available in Damascus . Information Minister Salman confirmed that these samplings of Western culture will become a feast of information later this year when the government offers cable_television for the first time . But Salman insisted that the allure of the West and its open democracies will not turn the Syrians against their deeply entrenched government . &quot; Of course , there is no kind of regime in the world that satisfies all , &quot; he said . &quot; But the Syrian citizen knows well his country , his state and his government . The Syrian people are very organized . Every part of society is organized. &quot;</TEXT>
