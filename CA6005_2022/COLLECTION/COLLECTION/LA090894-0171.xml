   <HEADLINE> CLUSTER OF GENES LINKED TO COMMON TYPE OF DIABETES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> British researchers have identified a constellation of at least 18 genes that lead to the onset of insulin-dependent diabetes , a breakthrough that promises new hope for the prevention and treatment of the disabling disorder that afflicts nearly 1 million people in the United States . The feat marks the first time researchers have used new technology developed for the human genome project -- the ambitious effort to map the complete human genetic blueprint -- to develop the genetic profile of a complex disorder in which multiple genes interact with environmental factors to produce disease . &quot; The technology we have developed here not only helps diabetes , but is also going_to play a role in understanding ( the genetic basis of ) heart_disease , asthma , rheumatoid_arthritis and certain types of cancers , &quot; said molecular geneticist Simon T . Bennett of Oxford_University . &quot; This is a major step forward. &quot; &quot; If we can trace the genetics of diabetes , then hopefully we can find ways of preventing it from ever happening , &quot; said Dr. Sarah King , director_of_research at the Juvenile_Diabetes Foundation International . &quot; Ultimately , prevention is the best cure. &quot; Diabetes is the fourth-leading cause of death by disease in the United States , accounting_for an estimated 160 # 000 fatalities each year . Its complications include blindness , kidney_disease , heart problems , strokes and amputations as a result of peripheral nerve damage . Diabetes is diagnosed in about 650 # 000 people each year . Insulin-dependent , or Type 1 , diabetes results when insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the body ' s immune_system . Insulin helps cells use and store sugars in the diet , and in its absence an individual can quickly fall_into a coma or die . Short-term symptoms can be controlled by regular injection of insulin , but complications develop because of the wide swings of sugar concentration in the blood . Type 2 diabetes , which afflicts at least 12 million Americans , occurs when the pancreas does not make enough insulin or when cells are unable to use it properly . It can usually be controlled with diet or drugs that stimulate insulin production . Its complications are the same as those for Type 1 . Researchers have long known that genes contribute to diabetes , but the role of genes is very different than in simpler genetic_disorders , such_as muscular_dystrophy or Lou Gehrig ' s disease . In those cases , there is a single gene involved . If both copies of the gene that a person carries -- one from each parent -- are defective , the disease will develop . But diabetes , like heart_disease , cancer and many other disorders , is polygenic -- meaning that several genes , each of different importance , play a role in its onset . Also , the presence of the genes alone does not necessarily mean that the individual will develop the disease , but only that he or she is predisposed to developing it . The individual must also be exposed to a trigger in the environment -- a virus or a protein in cow ' s milk , in the case of diabetes -- before the disease occurs . Tracking down the genes in a polygenic disease is a daunting and time-consuming task that requires an immense investment in research and supplies . But molecular geneticist John Todd and his colleagues at Oxford used the modern techniques of high-speed replication of DNA ( the PCR technique used in DNA fingerprinting ) , computerized control of the separation of DNA fragments and automation to speed_up the process dramatically . Using these techniques , they were able to identify 300 genetic markers in thousands of blood samples from the members of 300 U.S. and British families with a history of Type 1 diabetes , a process that would have required decades using conventional procedures . From these studies , the researchers were able to show that 18 separate genes play a role in the onset of the disease . One of them , called IDDM1 , is particularly crucial , accounting_for 40 % to 50 % of the genetic contribution . Three others play a significant role , much like the supporting actors in a play , while the rest are , in_effect , bit players . The task now is to isolate each of the genes and identify the protein for which it is a blueprint . Once that is known , researchers say , it should be possible to fully understand how diabetes develops . But that information is not necessarily essential to developing tests that indicate susceptibility to diabetes . That , said Oxford ' s Bennett , could be accomplished in a_couple_of years . It should then be possible to identify diabetes-prone individuals at birth and take steps to minimize -- and eventually eliminate -- the possibility that they will develop the disorder .</TEXT>
