   <HEADLINE> THEATER ; JUNE KYOKO LU ' S WAIT IS OVER ; FOR THIS VETERAN ASIAN AMERICAN ACTRESS , HER ROLE AS FORGIVENESS FROM HEAVEN IN ' THE WAITING_ROOM ' AT THE MARK TAPER FORUM IS A HEAVENLY BLESSING INDEED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A lone fuchsia bougainvillea stem rises out of a tall vase at the center of a table covered with an off-white cloth , in a quietly elegant dining alcove . The dark wood-paneled walls are filled with tasteful prints and paintings . Theater posters for &quot; The Phantom of the Opera &quot; and &quot; King Lear &quot; hang alongside Asian masks in the adjacent living_room where June Kyoko Lu sits , surrounded by more artwork , much of it of_her_own making . It is a setting as rich with cultural resonance and full of warm welcome as the actress herself . Lu , who ' s currently appearing in the Mark Taper Forum production of Lisa Loomer ' s &quot; The Waiting Room , &quot; has long been familiar to Los Angeles audiences from her work_at the late Los Angeles Theatre Center and on smaller local stages , including , most notably , East West Players . But this role is a breakthrough . Lu plays Forgiveness From Heaven , a wealthy 18th-Century Chinese woman with bound feet . And though the actress is Korean-born , the role is strangely -- and perhaps sadly -- familiar . &quot; The inner life of Forgiveness I know well from watching my mother , &quot; says Lu . &quot; She was a college graduate , but she had no life . She lived through my dad , who was the worst womanizer . I forgave him . I had to , for my own happiness . But I don ' t forget what kind of life she led . I said to myself never in my life , never would I be like her , even though I adored her. &quot; The actress does indeed make Forgiveness From Heaven ring eerily true . &quot; Everything she does has the weight of experience behind it and yet she is beautifully open and has this innocence as an actress that is so beguiling , &quot; says director David Schweizer . &quot; She is also fiercely committed . She ' ll work and work , but she does_it all_in this spirit of complete openness and truth-telling. &quot; It ' s a good_example of how an actor can use her own background to bring a character to life . &quot; It surprised me how easily I could step_in ( to such a role ) , &quot; says Lu . &quot; I know this so well in my bones . I know so many other women even in this day and age -- even some of my contemporaries -- who live totally for men with no lives of_their_own , no self-esteem , nothing . In Asian culture , it ' s like an insult to a man if a woman has a career . It ' s heartbreaking . ( In the role of Forgiveness , ) I can use all that I know. &quot; * &quot; The Waiting Room , &quot; which is a comedy about three women from different centuries who come_together in a contemporary doctor ' s office , attacks America ' s current health-care system . And for this reason too , it strikes_a_chord with Lu . &quot; I have six medical doctors in my family and I ' m doing this play ! &quot; she says , clearly savoring the irony . In fact , Lu puts her faith in precisely the kind of alternative therapies that &quot; The Waiting Room &quot; suggests are anathema to the Western health-care system . &quot; I believe_in holistic natural medicine , &quot; she says . &quot; I had a locked jaw one time and couldn ' t eat or speak and the acupressure person cured me in five seconds , &quot; Lu continues . &quot; I tell my sister who is a doctor ( such ) stories and she says , ' Don ' t tell me about it . You are crazy. ' This play connected me to all these things. &quot; Yet even if &quot; The Waiting Room &quot; didn ' t have such personal resonance for Lu , it would still be a rare opportunity . For even in the wake of 1990 ' s &quot; Miss Saigon &quot; controversy -- which centered_on the casting of a white actor in the role of a Eurasian -- multidimensional roles for Asian American actresses remain few and far between , especially on the main stages of such major regional theaters as the Taper . &quot; We ( Asian American actresses ) don ' t get this kind of stuff often , &quot; says Lu . &quot; A ' Joy Luck Club ' ( comes_along ) maybe every 15 years and you cannot wait for it . I feel so blessed , I want to cry . I just feel_like a lucky star shone on me . I just want more Asian American actors to experience this. &quot; Lu herself knows many of L.A. ' s Asian American theater artists from her days in the Asian American Theater Project at LATC . Lu also began working with the then LATC-based Women Artists Group during that period , as did playwright Loomer , and that is where &quot; The Waiting Room &quot; began . It was just fortunate happenstance that both women were in_attendance on the day that Loomer was ready to have a reading of what would eventually become a scene in her play . &quot; I usually missed a lot of the Women Artists Group meetings because they were Saturday or Sunday mornings , &quot; says Lu . &quot; That morning , I happened to be there . Talk_about luck. &quot; At that point , Loomer had only written one scene . &quot; She was already writing something about cancer , because her mother ( had ) died of that , &quot; says Lu , referring to the disease that figures into the completed drama . &quot; So she just kept writing , adding scenes. &quot; Lu and Loomer hit it off so well that after that initial reading , the actress found herself becoming involved in the playwriting process . &quot; I went_to the Chinese library and checked_out books for Lisa because she was writing for TV then and she was very busy , &quot; says Lu , who also availed herself of the same research materials in_order to more fully understand her character . &quot; If I saw any article about foot binding , I saved it so that she could read through it . I was more_than happy to do it. &quot; And the actress has stayed with the play from these initial phases up_to its present full production . &quot; She has done every workshop and every production of the piece so far , &quot; says director Schweizer , referring not only to Lu ' s Women Artists Group work , but also to the play ' s Taper New Work Festival and the Williamstown ( Mass. ) Theatre Festival workshops . Lu also will be the only member of the cast to go_with the show in the fall to Trinity Repertory_Company in Providence , R.I. &quot; we ' ll be rehearsing something for the umpteenth time and she ' ll find a way to speak it as though she ' s never spoken it before , &quot; Schweizer continues . &quot; Audiences respond to the sense of immediacy around what she ' s feeling. &quot; Of course , the changes of venue along the way have required that Lu make some alterations in her work . &quot; It was an adjustment actually , &quot; she says of making the leap to the Taper . &quot; I was doing small theater for a long_time and it ' s all_of a sudden 10 times as big . In the preview somebody said , ' June , we can ' t hear you , ' and so I was able to make a quick adjustment before the press preview . Training helps. &quot; There are other differences now as well . &quot; Career-wise , I ' m happy that I ' m getting paid , &quot; says Lu . &quot; But even if I didn ' t get paid , I would do_it anyway. &quot; The artistic satisfaction of working_on a character with a detailed emotional history is enough . &quot; This character has a full life , coming from a different time , &quot; says Lu . &quot; She comes from being a gracious and a kind person and being homeless and kicked_out all_of a sudden and losing her mind. &quot; Lu -- who says that she ' d be &quot; committing suicide &quot; if she revealed her age , but that her agent sends her out for parts for someone &quot; between 45 and 55 &quot; -- has led a pretty full life so far herself . Born in Korea , she spent part of her childhood in Japan and speaks Korean and Japanese . Her mother died when Lu was only 12 and she was profoundly affected by the loss . &quot; In ( an ) Asian family , the mother is a kind of bridge between yourself and the father , &quot; she says . &quot; I was quite vulnerable. &quot; It was a trauma from which the actress has never fully recovered . &quot; I still mourn her death , &quot; she says . &quot; It changed my life . I gained 30 pounds in eight months . I would scream at night with nightmares . It was horrendous. &quot; Lu finished high_school in Korea and came_to the United States with her older sister , who had received a scholarship to study medicine in this country . The actress then began her own studies at Cal State L.A. But it wasn ' t smooth sailing . &quot; I was so shy that my speech teacher said , ' June , you go take some acting classes and get_over this shyness. ' I used to , if I was late for class , especially if the door was in front and I ' d have to walk in , I ' d shake , I was so shy . And that ' s when I started to take acting classes. &quot; Her father , who was still in Korea , wasn ' t thrilled with Lu ' s course_of_study . &quot; When I was taking acting classes , he literally freaked_out , &quot; she says . &quot; He said , ' If you don ' t want to be a doctor , at least marry one. ' &quot; Even Lu , though , was hedging her bets against the stage . &quot; I was actually majoring in education because you have to have a career , &quot; she says . &quot; And I did teach ( elementary_school in the L.A. Unified School District ) for about three years , but I was the most unhappy person. &quot; Lu sought fulfillment by acting_on the side . &quot; I was doing theater at night and that didn ' t help , &quot; she says . &quot; Both my acting career and my teaching career suffered. &quot; After about three years of this regimen , Lu decided to break_away . Calling_upon the vocal training she ' d had in college , Lu signed_on as the featured singer with a group of local Asian Americans who billed themselves as Keiko and the Japanese Imperial Dancers . They embarked_on a tour of Hiltons and other venues throughout the United States and Canada . That stint lasted a_few years , at which point Lu returned to L.A. to pursue a master ' s degree in fine_art , also at Cal State L.A. She ended_up quitting -- &quot; I got sidetracked again , &quot; she says -- just seven units shy of completing the program . Lu didn ' t abandon art , though . &quot; I was doing some business with my art , &quot; she says . &quot; I had a display at the Craft and Folk_Art Museum and I was actually making some money. &quot; She translated her knack for design -- and another side interest in political_campaigns -- into a job designing clothes for Kathleen Brown ( then Brown-Rice ) , when she ran_for the L.A. Board_of_Education in 1975 and 1979 . Eventually , though , Lu tired_of going from job to job , avoiding what she had come_to see as her true calling as an actress . &quot; I was a late bloomer , &quot; she says . &quot; My God , I was over 40 and here I was . I finally realized that what I wanted in life wasn ' t fame and money -- I just wanted to make a little dent before I left -- and it was OK if I ate cottage_cheese and hamburger for the rest of my life . It didn ' t make any difference to me because I knew clearly that this is what I wanted to do. &quot; Armed with that clarity , Lu sought further schooling for her chosen vocation . She studied at the Lee Strasberg Institute and with famed director Jose Quintero . &quot; I had to come_back to get proper training , &quot; she says . &quot; I spent seven years in grueling training . And I saved every penny , and it was just fine. &quot; Since the late ' 80s , she ' s worked fairly consistently , including such LATC productions as Tennessee Williams ' &quot; Night of the Iguana &quot; ( 1991 ) and a 1993 play by Michael Ahn called &quot; Sidework , &quot; which the actress produced herself , and &quot; The Wedding &quot; at the Taper Too . Lu has also been seen in New York in David Henry Hwang ' s &quot; Family Devotions &quot; at the Public Theater . Much of her work has been in smaller theaters throughout Los Angeles -- at East West , she ' s been in &quot; Rashomon , &quot; &quot; Asaga Kimashita &quot; and &quot; The Threepenny Opera &quot; -- and she ' s also appeared on TV in &quot; Hangin ' With Mr. Cooper , &quot; &quot; Shannon ' s Deal , &quot; &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; and &quot; MASH. &quot; Her most recent film credit is &quot; Menace II Society. &quot; Lu would naturally like to have more roles as fulfilling as Forgiveness From Heaven . So , partly in_order to make that wish a reality , she coordinates the Asian Pacific American Friends of the Center Theatre Group ' s play-reading series . Getting the 3-year-old series going was no mean feat . &quot; It took years for it to materialize , &quot; says Lu , who brought the idea to Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson along with her fiance , Yet Lock , who serves on the Center Theatre Group board of directors . &quot; It ' s volunteer work and I ' m just thrilled and honored to do it. &quot; The mission is to help emerging Asian American playwrights develop their work . &quot; I wanted to be in a position where I can at least make a change for people starting_out , &quot; says Lu . &quot; We need to nurture Asian playwrights . Otherwise , we have to wait until somebody else writes something for us , and sometimes the voice is different . Sometimes we look_at it and it ' s not right. &quot; So far , a number of scripts that have been read in the series -- such_as Elizabeth Wong ' s &quot; Kimchee and Chitlins , &quot; currently playing_at the West Coast Ensemble -- have gone_on to productions at other theaters . And that makes Lu optimistic . &quot; It is getting better , because we are pressuring , &quot; she says . &quot; We can ' t just be complacent and not do anything . Ethnic groups have so_much violence and friction , but we ' re basically all so_much the same . And theater is a place where we can really learn about each other and solve some of the problems. &quot; * &quot; The Waiting Room , &quot; Mark Taper Forum , L.A. Music Center , 135 N .
