   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; NOBLE TRY TO RECLAIM HERITAGE ; THE CZECH REPUBLIC IS REVIVING ARISTOCRATS ' OLD DREAMS BY RETURNING CASTLES , LAND SEIZED BY THE COMMUNISTS . FORTUNES AND TITLES HAVE FADED , BUT THE CHANCE TO RESTORE FAMILY HONOR STILL SHINES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Count Joseph Kinsky stands tall beside the weathered gables of his family ' s Georgian-style castle . Forty years under communism , including a jail term and labor in the uranium mines , did little to diminish his noble demeanor . The castle , on the other hand , is a wreck . Seized by the government when Communists took_control in 1948 , the 27-room chateau was used for pig breeding , then left to rot . Now it belongs again to Kinsky , who at 80 faces the enormous task of restoring it to its original splendor -- but without a vast family fortune to do so . &quot; My relation_to that castle is clearly emotional -- it was my home , &quot; Kinsky said . &quot; If anyone tells me they envy me because I am rich now , I can only say I ' ve got things to spend money on. &quot; Since revolutions brought_down Communist governments in Eastern Europe five years ago , many nobles have sought the return of confiscated land and castles . But only the Czech Republic is readily handing them back . Kinsky is one of dozens of aristocrats reclaiming the castles and palaces , factories , forests and farmlands seized by a regime that was determined to do_away_with the upper_class . The current government is able to return vast landholdings with little protest from a public raised on socialism because restitution is limited to properties confiscated after the Communist putsch in 1948 and is made only to citizens who live_in the republic . The law excludes so-called traitors among the gentry -- those who opted for German citizenship after Hitler ' s occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 -- while recognizing those seen as patriots for retaining their Czech nationality . This , and the fact that the nobles are not seeking political power along with their old wealth , has made restitution palatable to Czechs , not all_of whom have profited from the country ' s return to capitalism . Property claims have met varied fates elsewhere . Hungary is offering compensation coupons to former property_owners , including nobles , that can be used to buy back businesses , land or even castles at favorable prices . Poland allows former owners to sue in court if they believe that the confiscations were illegal . The German government is bound by its unification treaty not to return property confiscated during the postwar land_reform in East_Germany . A law that would allow former owners to buy back part of those properties at subsidized prices is under discussion . Romania has yet to decide how it will resolve the land issue , and in Russia , some nobility have hinted they might like their estates back . The Czech Republic passed its reclamation laws in 1990 and 1991 -- when it was still Czechoslovakia . In what is now Slovakia , as in the Baltic_states , most of the nobility was foreign and therefore ineligible for restitution or compensation . Those who seek restitution must present proof of prior ownership to the government_agency that owns the property -- usually the municipality , in the case of castles -- and a denial may be appealed in court . About 30 castles have been returned and 75 applications have been denied because the former owners allegedly were Nazi collaborators , according to the Czech Press_Agency . About 100 requests are pending . Whether they fled their homeland or stayed in the country as Kinsky did , most aristocratic Czech families have lost their once-great fortunes . The return of their estates makes them land-rich again , but many remain cash-poor . In addition to the castles being dilapidated , the thousands of acres being returned are in need of reforesting or farming investment . Kinsky , whose nobility dates to the 13th Century , estimates that it will cost about $ 7 million to restore his Kostelec nad Orlici castle , about 75 miles east of Prague , and convert it into a family memorial , a public museum with the Kinsky art_collection and heirlooms rescued from storage or other museums . &quot; It ' s a ruin . And as I have lived 40 years in socialism , I haven ' t got the millions . I am hoping that someone will give them to me , &quot; Kinsky said with a genteel smile . The Nazis had been the first to confiscate the castle , in 1939 , and Kinsky ' s family moved then to Prague , where his Viennese mother took Czech citizenship in solidarity with his father . The castle was returned , then appropriated by the Communists , who allowed Kinsky ' s parents to live_in two rooms until 1951 . Kinsky ' s siblings had left the country , but he and his wife remained behind to care_for his aging parents . In October , 1949 , Kinsky was jailed for two years as a class enemy and put_to_work in uranium mines , where he labored for five years . He subsequently worked in translating jobs , a lacquer factory and , finally , in a state-run insurance_company until retiring in the 1970s . When Kinsky sought the return of his family properties in 1992 , his wife protested that she wasn ' t about to wash the castle ' s 70 windows twice a year . But the government hastened to give_back the decrepit building , and the Kinskys moved_into the former servant quarters last year . They also have received nearly 5 # 000 acres of forest lands and are negotiating with the government for the return of more_than 800 acres of farmland . Kinsky and other aristocrats seem to regard their castles in much the same way as priests do their churches : The castles preceded them by centuries and will outlive them ; the nobles are not so_much owners of private_property as administrators of an estate that is to be passed_on to subsequent generations . In the nearby town of Castolovice , workers pound on the roof of a Renaissance castle with the same name . Diana Sternberg Phipps , whose family bought the estate in 1694 , struggles for words to describe why she returned to the Czech Republic to undertake its renovation . &quot; ( It is ) for my family , for history , &quot; said Phipps , a countess by birth whose family fled to the United States in 1948 . &quot; There is something to the fact that the family has been here since 1200 , in this house since the 1600s. &quot; In fact , records of the family ' s eight-pointed star crest have been traced back as far as 1130 . Castolovice was built a_couple_of centuries later and eventually bought by the Counts Sternberg to be the seat of the head of the family . Like the Kinsky ' s , the Sternberg castle was confiscated during the Nazi occupation . It was returned after World_War_II , and the family lived there before emigrating . The castle was a museum and trade_school under the Communists and , although it is in far better shape than Kinsky ' s , requires a tremendous amount of work . Phipps , a decorator during her years in the United States and England and author of the book &quot; Affordable Splendor , &quot; is paying_for the renovation herself but throws_up her hands when asked the cost . She is improving the museum , installing two restaurants and converting 15 bedrooms and baths into a guest house to be rented_out to conference groups and hunting parties to pay_for the castle ' s maintenance . Some rooms will be renovated as family quarters . Castolovice ' s paintings depict the bygone aristocracy ' s shooting parties , at which hundreds of fowl , deer and wild_boar were brought_in . At nearby Doudleby nad Orlici , also recently returned to its owner , a hallway is filled with antler trophies bearing the dates and names of the noble shooters . Some Czech nobles today dismiss the label of aristocrat , noting that royal courts were abolished by the government of the first Czech Republic after World_War I , and princes and counts became simply &quot; misters. &quot; &quot; We are no aristocrats . We are the descendants of aristocratic families , &quot; Kinsky insisted . &quot; Titles are for snobs. &quot; Phipps notes that she lost her title by marrying a commoner . &quot; I was never impressed with titles , &quot; said 97-year-old Jindrich Kolowrat , a count by birth . &quot; A lot of aristocrats resent that titles were abolished , like somebody stole something from them . But the aristocracy made a lot of historic blunders . Only a_few families really were always faithful . Even we were not always . Some ( Kolowrats ) allied_with the Germans of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. &quot; Kolowrat sits in a winged-back armchair in the living room of the home he built long ago on a hill overlooking Prague . The house was taken by an SS officer during the Nazi occupation and by the Interior Ministry during Communist times as a hotel for spies who came_in from Czech embassies around the world . The count lived_out the Communist years in the United States as a successful businessman , first with a dairy_farm and , later , fitness centers . He returned to the Czech Republic in his 90s because , he said , &quot; we ' ve been here for 800 years . I had no historical connection to America. &quot; Besides his house , his family has retrieved forest land , commercial property and two castles , one in downtown Prague that is rented to the National Theater for the next 20 years -- for one Czech crown ( about 4 cents ) per year . The Kolowrats have a noble name and more money than most Czechs . They are aristocratically vague about how much land they have reclaimed ; one does not discuss money in polite society . But also they are careful not to stir what they believe are undercurrents of resentment among Czechs who have not fared so well under capitalism . The nobles note that some people still dislike the new market economics and suspect that anyone with money must have come_by it illegally . Milan Uhde , president of the Czech Parliament , said that the government has a policy of restitution and that &quot; the return of property to nobility should be judged in the same way as the return of property to anybody else. &quot; Generally it is , except when Czechs feel that nobles are receiving special treatment -- such_as a wink on the residency requirement -- or when they suspect a property_owner of having been a Nazi collaborator . The former Communist_Party newspaper Rude Pravo charged recently that about 200 people had relied_on &quot; influential members of government &quot; to get_back their Czech citizenship so that they could seek the return of their properties . The paper alleged that some of those were &quot; gray cases , &quot; former Nazi collaborators who should not be accepted back . Otherwise , say Czechs such_as 68-year-old economist Miroslav Kuhn , &quot; noblemen are people too. &quot; &quot; I believe all that was stolen should be returned , &quot; said 62-year-old Anezka Smutna , a retiree . Although the aristocrats do not possess the official titles or riches of their ancestors , most Czechs know who the nobles are and frequently address them as count or countess . Many also expect nobility to act like nobility -- a surprise to the generation that left very young and returned after decades abroad . &quot; They see me walking through our buildings with a light_bulb or screwdriver and say , ' Count , you ' re not supposed to be doing that , ' &quot; said Kolowrat ' s 51-year-old son , Tomas . &quot; They have no idea what it meant for my father to start over in America . Everyone has expectations of how a count should behave . But we are American . You are what you make of yourself , not what you inherit. &quot; With the titles also comes pressure to live_up_to the past . Tomas Kolowrat points to 18th-Century family portraits hanging over Interior Ministry furniture . &quot; Look_at them , &quot; he said . &quot; Look_at the people and what they achieved . They are historical characters. &quot; Adam Bubna-Litic , also born a count , was broke and anonymous when he emigrated to Australia in the early 1950s . After a childhood in the Doudleby castle amid Renaissance graffito designs and Baroque stone muses , Bubna worked in a factory and drove a bus before becoming a teacher and , eventually , a principal . He got Doudleby back a year ago and is working_on several projects that he hopes will make the Doudleby self-supporting . He says an aristocrat ' s life is under constant scrutiny . &quot; There is a certain obligation , &quot; Bubna said . &quot; I must always appear as an honest , straight citizen helpful to others . The problem is , at the moment I have to help myself . Already there have been certain requests that are quite unrealistic . They think because I have a title I am made of money. &quot; The nobles say they are not only too poor but also too busy to re-create the aristocratic society and lifestyle of their forebears . They are looking_forward rather than back , looking_to the future of their lands and castles and family memorials . &quot; I took the castle and all_the work_on my shoulders , &quot; Kinsky said . &quot; I ' m 80 and have not many years in prospect . But I want to keep_on that cultural object that was built_up by my family. &quot;</TEXT>
