   <HEADLINE> SOVIET DISSIDENT SAKHAROV ' S WIDOW INAUGURATES LIBRARY ; RUSSIA : YELENA BONNER OPENS ARCHIVES IN BUILDING WHERE WRITER LIVED . YELTSIN , SECRET_POLICE DONATE FILES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With a belated assist from the former KGB , the widow of Soviet dissident Andrei D . Sakharov inaugurated a library Saturday with thousands of pages of writings by him , letters to him and secret_police files on him . The archive , neatly arranged in cardboard boxes on tall metal shelves in the apartment_building where Sakharov lived , is the first collection of such material in one place for public examination . &quot; We talk_about the influence of his ideas , &quot; his widow , Yelena Bonner , said after welcoming reporters and guests to the three-room apartment , remodeled and air-conditioned with a $ 51 # 500 grant from the U.S. Congress . &quot; But have we read Sakharov ? &quot; Later , at a government forum marking the 73rd anniversary of Sakharov ' s birth , the head of Russia ' s Federal Counterintelligence Service made a surprise contribution to the project , handing Bonner two thick blue folders containing 62 KGB &quot; reports on you and your husband. &quot; &quot; I am afraid you will feel pain when you read all this , &quot; said Gen . Sergei V . Stepashin , whose spy agency succeeded the KGB . &quot; But the truth must be known . It is your right to use these notes the way you like. &quot; &quot; What is happening now would have seemed like a Christmas fairy tale a_few years ago , &quot; Bonner replied , musing on the changes wrought by the Soviet_Union ' s 1991 collapse . She joked that her car would not have been stolen if the police had kept_up the surveillance . &quot; I am deprived of your attention , &quot; she said . The KGB reports date_from 1968 , the year of Sakharov ' s seminal essay , &quot; Thoughts of Progress , Peaceful Coexistence and Intellectual Freedom , &quot; to Dec . 8 , 1989 , six days before his death . The last was written by Vladimir A . Kryuchkov , then head of the KGB , to Soviet President Mikhail S . Gorbachev and complained that Sakharov ' s &quot; ambitions &quot; and &quot; anti-Soviet activities &quot; were undermining the state . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin sent his chief_of_staff to the anniversary forum to hand Bonner a smaller folder of documents on Sakharov from the presidential archives and to read a message extolling the late nuclear physicist as a &quot; great son of Russia who almost alone rose_up against the arms race and championed human_rights &quot; in a totalitarian state . Sakharov ' s outspokenness earned him the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize and Soviet punishment by internal exile in the city of Gorky from 1980 to 1986 . Rehabilitated under Gorbachev , he won election to the Soviet Parliament in 1989 as the conscience of the democratic movement . On four occasions , KGB agents in Gorky purloined parts of his diaries -- hundreds of pages in all -- before Bonner spirited out a reconstructed version for publication in the West . The handwritten diaries are now held at Brandeis University in Massachusetts and are being copied for the library here . Speaking in an auditorium of the former Soviet Central Committee headquarters , under a larger-than-life photograph of the famous dissident , Stepashin said all_the seized memoirs had been burned on Kryuchkov ' s orders in 1990 as &quot; revenge against the dead. &quot; He announced that Sakharov ' s KGB dossier had contained 520 volumes in all -- &quot; a Guinness record . . . . No other person in the former U.S.S.R. had such a file. &quot; The burned memoirs and the 62 reports turned_over Saturday are believed to be a tiny fraction of Sakharov ' s KGB file . In a brief interview after the forum , Bonner said that the government is still holding &quot; a lot of documents &quot; on her late husband . Saturday ' s low-key ceremonies , attended by a_few dozen human_rights activists , reflected the disarray of their cause in a country where violent crime and economic hardship threaten to undermine democratic gains . But Carl Gershman , president of the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy , which channeled the aid money to the new library , said Sakharov ' s works_on democracy and arms control &quot; will keep the spirit of this great man alive &quot; and &quot; serve as a beacon for Russian democracy. &quot; The library also includes &quot; tens of thousands &quot; of letters from ordinary Russians &quot; containing moral support as well as curses , &quot; Bonner said . Bonner also announced plans to establish an international human_rights museum in Moscow in 1996 . The museum will be named for Sakharov . Russia will soon get another major library after another superstar dissident and Nobel laureate , Alexander I . Solzhenitsyn , returns to Russia this week after 20 years in exile . The 75-year-old author will bring his personal collection of memoirs from more_than 700 Russians describing their lives during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and two World_Wars , and he will make them available to scholars researching those periods .</TEXT>
