   <HEADLINE> WILSON WOULD EXPEL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM SCHOOLS ; POLITICS : SAYING STATE can ' t AFFORD TO EDUCATE THEM , HE CLARIFIES STAND ON PROP . 187 . BROWN CHARGES HYPOCRISY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Answering a question he has avoided for more_than a year , Gov . Pete Wilson said Thursday that he would favor expelling illegal immigrants from the public_schools if the U.S. Supreme Court allows it . The Republican governor said the state cannot afford the estimated $ 1.5 billion it costs to educate more_than 300 # 000 illegal immigrants now attending kindergarten through 12th-grade classes . &quot; We cannot educate every child from here to Tierra del Fuego , &quot; Wilson said at a news_conference in the Capitol . In general , the Republican governor has backed Proposition 187 -- an anti-illegal immigration measure on the November ballot -- but until Thursday had not taken a stand on the initiative ' s most explosive provisions , which would bar illegal immigrants from the state ' s schools and require educators to check on the citizenship status of all students and their parents . Wilson had said he favored the measure as a way to provoke a legal challenge to a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision prohibiting states from denying illegal immigrants a public education . When pressed Thursday to explain what he would do if the Supreme Court upheld the initiative , Wilson said : &quot; We implement the law. &quot; A Wilson spokeswoman later clarified the governor ' s comments , saying Wilson would prefer to see Proposition 187 coupled with a stronger federal effort to deport illegal immigrants so that children barred from schools do not remain in this country . But ultimately , the aide said , the governor supports the education provisions of the proposition as written . &quot; If it ' s upheld , that is fine with him , &quot; said Communications Director Leslie Goodman . Wilson ' s comments came as the immigration issue re-emerged at the forefront of his reelection campaign against Democrat Kathleen Brown . Brown opposes Proposition 187 . Removing children from the schools , she said Thursday , would be likely to result in &quot; more trouble , more gangs , more guns , more graffiti and more cost to the taxpayers. &quot; Campaigning Thursday in Los Angeles , Brown stepped_up her charge that Wilson has been a hypocrite on the issue . She cited letters that Wilson , then a U.S. senator , wrote in 1987 to President Ronald Reagan and his attorney_general , Edwin Meese , complaining that the Immigration and Naturalization Service was making_it too difficult for Mexican farm_workers to enter the country to pick crops . Brown also blasted Wilson for trying now to curtail health services to illegal immigrants even though he voted as a senator to provide them . And she showed an informational videotape featuring Wilson in which the state encourages non-citizens to apply for government benefits . &quot; Pete Wilson votes to impose health_care mandates -- and now he campaigns against them , &quot; Brown said . &quot; He cut a hole in the fence to allow millions of illegal immigrants in , and now he wants to patch that hole because that ' s what the polls tell him to do. &quot; Wilson aides , in response , said he favored a stricter guest worker program when he was a senator but had to settle for the weaker version drafted by Democrats in the House of Representatives . He wrote the letters , they said , because California farmers faced a severe labor shortage and needed migrant workers quicker than the federal_government was processing them . Sean Walsh , Wilson ' s press secretary , said the informational video cited by Brown was pulled recently after the state Health and Welfare Agency realized it was being shown in informational kiosks throughout the state . &quot; Some bureaucrat somewhere was asleep at the switch , but the governor is absolutely adamant , crystal_clear on his views on this issue , &quot; Walsh said . &quot; Folks better shape up. &quot; Wilson on Thursday also signed legislation cracking_down on immigration fraud , prohibiting the issuance of state contracts to companies convicted of hiring illegal immigrants , and easing the transfer of illegal immigrant felons from state_prisons to federal custody . At his news_conference , Wilson spoke at length about Proposition 187 , which he has said he will vote for but has yet to formally endorse . The measure would prohibit the delivery of public_services , except emergency medical_care , to illegal immigrants . The initiative is opposed by the California Teachers Assn. , the California Medical Assn. , some law_enforcement groups and business associations , which say the measure is too extreme . However , a Los Angeles Times poll this week found wide public support for it , with 62 % of likely voters saying they favor passage of the initiative . Wilson has tried to walk a fine line on the education issue . Although he has complained about the cost of educating illegal immigrants since early 1993 , the governor has refused to say whether he personally favored kicking_out of school those children who are in the country illegally . On Thursday , Wilson again tried to deflect the question by asserting that the federal_government , not the state , would ultimately decide how to handle those children . But when asked to state his personal opinion , he replied : &quot; At some point , I think , there has to be a clear line drawn. &quot; Wilson noted that federal law for eight years has required employers to verify the legal_status of those they hire and said he believes the same standard should apply to public_services . If Proposition 187 were upheld , Wilson said , he would &quot; institute some kind of orderly process of determining who was legally in school or what parents were or were not legal and begin that kind of deportation that is necessary. &quot;</TEXT>
