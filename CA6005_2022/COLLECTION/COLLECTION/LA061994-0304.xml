   <HEADLINE> DEBT FORGES DESPERATION IN RUSSIAN STEEL TOWN ; ECONOMICS : LYSVA ' S FACTORY IS INSOLVENT , THREATENING THE COMMUNITY . NATIONWIDE , MANY FACE A SIMILAR DILEMMA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The factory stands idle , smothered by debt . The city is flat broke . And everyone with a garden is out planting potatoes to see them through the coming winter . Two and a half years after the collapse of the Soviet_Union , the grimy old steel town of Lysva ( population 94 # 000 ) is a requiem for socialism . Capitalism never had a chance to transform this typical company town on the western flank of the Ural Mountains ; Russia ' s lurch toward a free market killed Lysva from afar . The Lysva metallurgical factory , which employs one of every eight residents here , has halted its operations because it cannot pay the $ 780 # 000 in back wages owed its 12 # 000 workers . While Moscow officials put the finishing touches_on a bankruptcy law , small cities like Lysva across the Russian heartland are becoming ever more desperate . &quot; A woman came_to my office last week and begged me to pay her back wages , &quot; factory President Oleg P . Ananin said . &quot; She said she hadn ' t eaten anything but grass in two days. &quot; Deaths from alcohol poisoning have increased , and so have suicides , officials say . Workers are not the only ones going unpaid . The factory is far behind on the city , regional and federal taxes that consume up_to 90 % of its meager profits . It can ' t pay the energy bills that have risen 2 # 000 % in the last three years . It can ' t even buy the raw_materials needed to keep operating . The insolvent factory cannot begin to afford its day-care centers , which serve 80 % of the city ' s preschoolers , or maintain its apartments , in which 70 % of all city residents still live . Nor can the silent plant finance its medical clinics , summer_camps , swimming_pool , hotel , gym , stadium , skiing center or Palace of Culture -- all perquisites that workers came_to expect under socialism but that make the factory wildly uncompetitive in Russia ' s new market-driven economy . In short , the factory that was founded in 1785 by Prince Boris G . Shakhovskoi , won the Order of Lenin in 1942 and was privatized as a joint-stock_company in 1992 is now bankrupt . And since the giant smoke-belcher once provided up_to 67 % of the city ' s tax_base -- as well as most of its social_services -- the city of Lysva has gone bust too . The city owes $ 1.1 million in unpaid wages and utility bills . It has slashed spending drastically , even cutting_in half the subsidies for school lunches , but still the deficit is rising , City Administrator Vadim D . Novosyolov said . Now , the teachers , who have not been paid since March , are threatening to strike . With its poverty , aging brick buildings and disastrous balance_sheet , Lysva is typical of thousands of small Russian cities that were built around one major -- now troubled -- industry . But unlike unemployed Muscovites , who can often find work in the burgeoning private sector , residents of Lysva have nowhere to turn if their employer fails . Despite the inevitable suffering and upheavals , the government of President Boris N . Yeltsin now seems determined to allow the weakest of Russia ' s enterprises to restructure or die . Since Russia passed its first bankruptcy law last year , 30 enterprises have registered as bankrupt , and at least 1 # 200 more are considered insolvent , according to Sergei G . Belyayev , head of the newly created Federal Bankruptcy Agency . Only in the last several weeks , however , has the government begun issuing concrete instructions on how the bankruptcy law is to be implemented . And it is not yet known which of the sinking factories will be bailed_out by the government and which are to be allowed to shut_down or be sold . Officials say the bankruptcy process will give factories such_as Lysva ' s a structured way to reorganize , settle debts and possibly attract fresh capital . Unless creditors can be assured of payment -- at least by a bankruptcy court -- no one will invest here , they note . But it will not be easy to persuade Russians that bankruptcy means anything less than meltdown . The very word bankruptcy inspires terror in a population that for 70 years was told that socialism was superior to capitalism because it would never allow a factory to go bankrupt and throw workers out into the street . &quot; They think bankruptcy means the end , that the factory doors will be nailed shut , and no one will ever be let_in again , &quot; said Viktor V . Golubev , deputy director of the bankruptcy agency . &quot; We need to explain to our citizens , and to our factory directors . . . that bankruptcy itself does not cause unemployment. &quot; Lysva officials believe that bankruptcy will only give foreigners and the Russian mafia a chance to buy_up their plant at rock-bottom prices . &quot; A small group of people in this country are now amassing a huge amount of capital , &quot; factory President Ananin said . &quot; Once it becomes profitable to invest here . . . they ' ll buy_out our plant . I think this is being masterminded. &quot; As in many small cities , former Communist_Party officials still hold most of the powerful positions in Lysva -- and creditors are afraid to tangle_with them , City Administrator Novosyolov said . &quot; I don ' t see a creditor who would dare to force the city into bankruptcy , &quot; Novosyolov said . &quot; We will use this to our advantage. &quot; But local officials believe that the factory could be made profitable if only it could get a temporary tax holiday and be relieved of the expense of providing its workers with housing , day_care , recreation and medical_care . &quot; Of course , all_of this raises our cost of production and lowers our competitiveness , &quot; said Ananin , who had Novosyolov ' s city administrator job before he became the factory president . &quot; We still have a mixture of socialism and a market system. &quot; The plant has been offered a $ 150-million credit to buy equipment from Germany to manufacture cold-rolled steel . But with annual interest_rates at 213 % and the strapped Russian government slashing subsidies to industry , Ananin said he cannot raise the $ 150 million in matching funds he needs to close the German deal -- and is not sure he could pay the money back if he borrowed it . He believes declaring bankruptcy will do nothing to help , because neither the government nor commercial_banks will lend the money the plant needs to restructure . &quot; So what will happen ? The plant will close_down , &quot; Ananin said . &quot; The people will be thrown_out into the street . Who will feed them ? &quot; The Russian labor_force today is virtually immobile . Citizens still need permission to move to Moscow and St . Petersburg , and even if an unemployed Lysva worker found a new job somewhere else , moving would mean giving_up a heavily subsidized factory apartment and paying steep free-market rent . The only private enterprises in Lysva are a_few kiosks and street vendors who peddle cheap imported clothing , food and liquor . Factory_workers lack the capital to start a business , officials say , and high taxes kill_off law-abiding entrepreneurs before their ventures can get_off_the_ground . &quot; Our situation is like the Great Depression of the 1930s , &quot; Ananin said . &quot; There are private businesses in this country , but all they do is buy and sell things . Anyone who tries to produce anything , in industry or in agriculture , has gone bankrupt . In this country , it is not profitable to produce. &quot; Lysva residents cannot understand why their factory is going_under . During World_War_II , the plant made Soviet army helmets , but in the 1960s it converted to peacetime production and began churning_out kitchen_stoves , high-quality enamel pots and pans and other metal products . &quot; We don ' t make tanks or bullets , &quot; Ananin said . &quot; We make consumer products that are in_demand all_over the country. &quot; In fact , the metallurgical factory is a mishmash of the obsolete and the up-to-date , the hopeless and the promising . Until it ground to a halt this spring , the factory was still producing steel ingots in open-hearth furnaces with century-old technology . The process is so inefficient that the steel coming_out of the factory is worth at least 15 % less than the raw_materials and energy that went_into producing it , said Mikhail M . Balan , the company ' s new marketing director . Nearly 2 # 500 people worked in that department , and their prospects for going_back to work are slim . Plant managers are hoping to scrape together the money to reopen parts of the plant soon -- but with at least 1 # 500 fewer workers . The trade_union is protesting the layoffs . &quot; It ' s possible that we are just postponing the inevitable , but we don ' t see any other way , &quot; union leader Alexander G . Lyamin said . &quot; You may think this is strange , but we still think our government ought to help us. &quot;</TEXT>
