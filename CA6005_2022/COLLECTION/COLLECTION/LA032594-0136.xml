   <HEADLINE> STORM BLAMED IN FATAL CRASH ; WEATHER : OXNARD HIGH SENIOR IS KILLED IN THE ACCIDENT . MORE RAIN IS EXPECTED AND OFFICIALS STILL WARN OF POSSIBLE MUDSLIDES IN BURN AREAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A wind-driven storm from the Gulf of Alaska that brought heavy rain to Ventura County on Thursday and contributed to a fatal car accident in Oxnard was expected to drop more rain today , with flash_floods still possible in areas scarred by last year ' s wildfires , forecasters said . Several car accidents occurred across the county during a wave of heavy downpours Thursday afternoon , including the fatal wreck in Oxnard that left a 17-year-old high_school student dead and his classmate in serious condition at a local hospital , authorities said . Eric Duff , a senior at Oxnard High_School , was killed when he lost_control of his car in the pouring rain and skidded into a traffic_signal post on Ventura Road , authorities said . His passenger , 15-year-old Jeffrey Wedemeyer , was in stable condition , said a spokeswoman at St . John ' s Regional Medical_Center . Duff was driving 60 m.p.h. in a 45 m.p.h. zone when his 1988 Volvo spun_out of control , Oxnard fire officials said . In Ventura , about 90 people sought refuge from the rain at an emergency warming shelter run_by the American Red_Cross , officials there said . The California Highway Patrol reported several road closures because of weather_conditions . Potrero Road from Camarillo State Hospital to the Thousand Oaks city_limits was closed because of rock slides , a mudslide shut_down Santa Clara Avenue between Central Avenue and Friedich Road just north of Oxnard , and snow and ice closed a portion of California 33 near Wheeler campground , the California Highway Patrol said . Forecasters predicted fast-moving , intermittent showers for parts of the county today as the powerful storm moves inland , with rain tapering_off late tonight or early Saturday . Temperatures were expected to hover in the mid-50s and lower 60s during the day , dropping into the upper 40s tonight . The storm was expected to drop one to two inches in coastal areas and up_to four inches in the mountains before clearing out this weekend . &quot; This is certainly the best chance of getting some heavy rain this season , &quot; said Harry Woolford , a meteorologist with Weather Data Inc. , which provides forecasts for The Times . Scattered showers began around noon Thursday , growing heavier in the early evening as the sky darkened . Snow began falling on Frazier Mountain in the afternoon , and flakes were expected to dust local mountains at elevations as low as 3 # 000 feet . Off the Ventura County coast , powerful winds prompted authorities to issue a gale warning for outer waters beyond the Channel Islands and a small craft advisory for areas closer to shore . &quot; It would not be a good idea to go_out in your dinghy , &quot; said National Weather Service meteorologist Nick Leivers . The biggest danger posed by the storm was for flash_floods and mudslides in fire-scarred areas near Thousand Oaks , Newbury Park and along Pacific Coast Highway , authorities said . Emergency officials issued a series of warnings about possible flooding , though only minor flood problems had been reported by late Thursday . The National Weather Service issued a flash_flood warning for five major burn areas in Southern California , including the Greenmeadow fire . The warning was downgraded late Thursday , but a flash-flood watch remained in_effect . &quot; This storm would definitely have the potential ( for a flash_flood ) , &quot; Leivers said . County fire officials issued a low-level alert early Thursday requiring firefighters at all stations to inspect their equipment and to be prepared to answer flooding calls . &quot; It ' s just a readiness call , to be prepared_for higher levels of activity , &quot; said county fire spokeswoman Sandi Wells . At four county fire_stations , firefighters were prepared to offer sandbags to residents living_in areas left bare by the Greenmeadow fire . Homeowners can receive up_to 50 sandbags each , though only one person had picked_up sandbags at the Thousand Oaks station by late Thursday . Fire officials said they believed most residents were already prepared from previous storms . Officials with the Sheriff ' s Office of Emergency Services said they had begun no formal disaster preparations , but were giving weather updates to the county fire_department and a disaster coordinator in the city of Thousand Oaks . And Sheriff Larry Carpenter issued a statement urging parents to keep their children away from flood channels , streams and rivers , which could quickly swell with runoff . The sheriff ' s search-and-rescue teams were placed on standby and helicopters were equipped to rescue flood victims . Two flight crews would be working_through the weekend at the sheriff ' s heliport in Camarillo until the storm passed , said crew chief Ron Stufflebeam . In the fatal car accident in Oxnard , Duff was pronounced dead as firefighters tried to extricate him from the mangled car . Rescue crews worked_through pounding rain to remove Wedemeyer from the vehicle . The car &quot; spun_out sideways and slammed hard into the post , &quot; said Oxnard Fire Captain Robert Bradley . &quot; When we got_on scene ( Duff ) had a very faint pulse , but he couldn ' t hang on. &quot; At an open_house at Oxnard High_School Thursday night , administrators announced Duff ' s death and asked_for a moment of silence during a gathering in the gymnasium . The program was later cut_short as shocked students and school staff headed_home early . Students and teachers said Duff was a varsity football_player and a member of the track team . Duff ' s mother is the principal at Sierra Linda School in Oxnard . &quot; He was a very responsible kid . He was very well-liked , &quot; said social studies teacher Chuck Cordes . With the predictions of more wet weather today , agricultural officials were hoping the storm would help the county make_up for a low amount of rain so far this year . Before the storm , the county had received only 68 % of the normal rainfall for this point in the rainy_season , which runs from October to the end of April , said John Weikel , senior engineer with the county Flood_Control District . &quot; Usually storms this late in the season don ' t affect us a whole_lot because they ' re normally followed by warm weather . But this storm is supposed to be exceptionally cold . That could be harmful to our celery and strawberry crops , &quot; said Earl McPhail , Ventura County agriculture commissioner . &quot; The rain helps most of the other crops , but for the short terms we have to worry about disease and decay problems with celery and strawberries , &quot; he said .
