   <HEADLINE> DEMOCRATIC WIPEOUT , VOTER ANGER AND CALIFORNIA ' S CHALLENGE ; THE ELECTION APPARENTLY MARKS A NEW ERA IN POLITICS , AND ONE THAT DEMANDS A NEW INTEGRITY IN POLITICAL LIFE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The political aftershocks continue , from the halls of Capitol_Hill to the State House in Sacramento . Nov . 8 , 1994 , marked the back-to-the-future election , the biggest change in Washington since Dwight D . Eisenhower was President . The Grand Old Party , typically affiliated with the status_quo , became the party of change . President Clinton was dealt what could only be charitably described as a slap in the face as most of the candidates he personally campaigned for fell_in defeat . Senate Democrats Edward M . Kennedy of Massachusetts and Charles S . Robb , who was facing Iran-Contra prevaricator Oliver L . North in Virginia ' s race for the Senate , were among the exceptions . Republicans now hold majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives , and a majority of the 50 governors is now Republican . National Democratic stars such_as Gov . Mario Cuomo of New York and Gov . Ann Richards of Texas are out , replaced by relative GOP unknowns like George Pataki , as well as by GOP royalty like George W . Bush , son of the former President . The Democrats took body blows at every level . Even the House majority_leader , Democrat Thomas S . Foley of Washington , couldn ' t win a seat in Congress Tuesday , though Republican Sonny Bono ( late of Sonny and Cher ) could . Voters were in an exasperated and surly mood . Plainly , Americans want government to deliver , even if they are not always clear on exactly what they want delivered . Let the new GOP majority be warned : Everything in Tuesday ' s vote indicates that if voters don ' t get satisfaction , the electorate will seek more vengeance at the polls two years from now . WILSON ' S HUGE CALIFORNIA CHALLENGE : Here in California Gov . Pete Wilson has won reelection , and he won big . His significant victory over Treasurer Kathleen Brown has fueled speculation that Wilson already is running_for a bigger political prize , the White_House . However , he must face a more immediate concern -- governing California after an election season that clearly revealed the deep fissures along the state ' s ethnic , racial and class lines . This is the challenge that confronts Wilson : Will he put campaigning behind him now and govern as the moderate leader of all Californians or will he continue in campaign mode , which can only deepen the scars left from the divisive campaign for Proposition 187 ? Wilson ' s words on Wednesday were right : &quot; . . . there is no room in California for bigotry , discrimination . We will continue to condemn intolerance . We will continue to protect individual rights . This is a commitment we make to all Californians without regard_to ethnic origin or skin_color . It applies regardless of whether the_English they speak is with an accent. &quot; But the actions Wilson took early Wednesday were not nearly so encouraging . He issued an executive order to begin implementation of the measure that will cut_off social_services to illegal immigrants , including an immediate cutoff of prenatal health_care . He also attempted to define what under Proposition 187 would be a &quot; reasonably suspect &quot; person : one who fails to provide documentation of legal residency . But what exactly does that mean ? Would a driver ' s license with an address be enough to satisfy law_enforcement officials ? The Times strongly opposed Proposition 187 , for the wrongheaded way it attempted to &quot; Do Something &quot; about illegal immigration . The inherent unfairness of Latinos being targeted as &quot; reasonably suspect &quot; for no reason other_than ethnicity , the unanswered questions about how it would be implemented and the lawsuits expected to fight it all_the way to the Supreme Court were just three of many reasons . Proposition 187 passed with large support , by a 59 % vote , a strong measure of just how much voters are demanding that politicians focus_on the very real problem of illegal immigration . The measure received a majority vote only from whites but was astoundingly close among Asian Americans ( 54 % against to 46 % for ) and African Americans ( 56 % against to 44 % for ) . Among Latino voters , the measure failed big , 78 % to 22 % . That disparity reflects one of those fissures Wilson must now address -- constructively , as the governor , not as a candidate . For instance , California ' s population is at least one-quarter Latino , but only 8 % of those who voted Tuesday were Latino . That fact is distressing and serves no one ' s long-term interests . It is a question for Wilson and all_of California ' s other political_leaders : how best to register more Latinos and thus encourage greater participation -- and power -- at the polls . THE RAZOR-CLOSE SENATE_RACE : Sen . Dianne Feinstein apparently is the winner in a race that , based on her record and her opponent ' s lack of one , should never have been close . It ' s a measure of the power of negative television and radio ads that this race came_down to the wire . In the final days of the campaign , charges from both camps about employing illegal immigrants ( Rep . Mike Huffington admitted hiring an illegal immigrant , in violation of federal law ) , not policy issues , dominated the debate . For all_the public bemoaning of negative campaigning , candidates -- unfortunately -- resort_to it for a good reason : It apparently works . Feinstein , once the state ' s most popular politician because of her solid record of achievement , sank_in the polls once Huffington , a relative political unknown before this campaign , began spending heavily , attacking her at every turn_in paid ads . A laugher race became a real horse_race . More_than 500 # 000 key absentee_ballots are still uncounted . * STATE ISSUES : Besides Proposition 187 , another daunting problem looms : the state budget . Wilson and the Legislature , which also gained several Republicans , must come_up with a responsible plan for long-term financing in California . The serious budget problems facing this state will only be exacerbated by the passage of Proposition 184 , the &quot; three-strikes &quot; crime measure that is expected to increase the cost of corrections by a crushing 120 % , adding about $ 5.5 billion to an already overburdened state budget . There is , thankfully , a glimmer of good news : the resounding defeat of Proposition 188 , the pro-smoking measure masquerading as an anti-smoking measure . The measure , bankrolled primarily by Philip Morris , the tobacco maker , started_out as popular in the polls , and no wonder . It was billed as offering &quot; tough , statewide &quot; smoking restrictions , but it turned_out Proposition 188 would have thrown_out the much tougher restrictions already passed_by the Legislature . The word got_out . The voters got_it . The deceit failed . The message is as clear as the air in a smoke-free restaurant : The Legislature had best not tamper with the stringent smoking law due_to go_into effect in January . WHAT NEXT ? : What will the GOP do with its newfound power ? Is it a recipe for more gridlock between a Democratic President and a GOP Congress ? For the moment , at least , putative Senate Majority_Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich promise to work with the President on behalf of the national interests . Although he certainly had precious little choice , a conciliatory Clinton extended the olive_branch Wednesday , vowing to work with Republicans on free_trade , welfare reform , reducing federal spending and other issues on which he and the GOP naturally converge . Given the events of the California election , immigration reform also probably will make its way onto the national agenda , which is exactly where it belongs . Feinstein , who already has worked diligently on increasing law_enforcement at the border , should be helpful in pushing immigration reform in a sensible and fair-minded way . Talk_of tax reduction , too , was big in Washington Wednesday . It ' s going_to be a neat trick to see exactly how Congress and the President achieve that without cutting what amount to huge middle-class entitlement programs -- Social_Security and Medicare . In Washington the air is thick_with pledges of bipartisan cooperation and moving ahead . What Washington must do first is get a clear reading on just what voters want it to move ahead on . Here in California , the air is thick_with unanswered questions as the state and the nation wait to see how California will handle the passage of a Draconian anti-illegal immigration measure . Passage of Proposition 187 carries the potential to either galvanize positive reform in Washington or , if handled badly , tear the state apart . Gov . Wilson , which shall it be ?</TEXT>
