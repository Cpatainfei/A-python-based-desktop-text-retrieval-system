   <HEADLINE> CITY ETHICS PANEL OKS MARATHON FIRM FINES ; SETTLEMENT : MOST MEMBERS EXPRESS REGRET THAT ORGANIZATION LEADER WAS NOT FORCED TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Los Angeles City Ethics Commission on Tuesday reluctantly agreed to settle money_laundering allegations against the firm that runs the Los Angeles Marathon , with a majority of the panel members saying they were disappointed that marathon President William Burke was not forced to accept culpability in the case . The action requires Los Angeles Marathon Inc. to pay a $ 200 # 000 fine for hiding the fact it was the true source of nearly 100 political contributions totaling $ 51 # 000 to candidates in the city . Burke , who has directed the commercial marathon for nine years , last month signed a settlement with the Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission stating that his organization had laundered campaign donations . But he was not personally cited for money_laundering . A former top aide , George Beasley , admitted to illegally funneling marathon funds to candidates . During Tuesday ' s public hearing , three of five ethics commissioners said they strongly suspected that Burke -- husband of Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke -- knew of the money_laundering scheme . But they said their agency could not produce conclusive evidence of Burke ' s involvement because Beasley accepted full blame . &quot; We have somebody in this scheme who was willing to take all_of the responsibility , &quot; Ethics Commission Chairman Dennis Curtis said . &quot; But I think we all understand . . . that there are other footprints and fingerprints all_over this. &quot; Burke did not attend the Ethics Commission hearing , but his attorney released a statement that said Burke and marathon Vice_President Marie Patrick knew_nothing of the money_laundering scheme . The statement , in part , read : &quot; An employee of the corporation used corporate funds to make the contributions without authorization by the principals . Nevertheless , the corporation is accepting responsibility for not monitoring the situation more closely. &quot; The statement also said that an outside accounting_firm has been hired to prevent a repeat of the problems . Attorney Lance Olson declined to respond to the comments made by commissioners during the hearing . The commission ' s unanimous vote to accept the settlement ends a three-year investigation by the Ethics Commission and the FPPC . The state agency is scheduled Thursday to consider a similar settlement in the case , which includes another $ 22 # 000 in illicit contributions to candidates outside of Los Angeles . The state agency is_due to receive a $ 236 # 000 fine , paid over five years . In the stipulations , Burke acknowledged that he had personally signed or authorized others to sign his name to more_than $ 37 # 000 in checks that went_to Beasley or Beasley ' s company . That money , and other marathon funds , were in turn used by Beasley to pay_back contributors to eight Los Angeles City_Council members , former Mayor Tom Bradley , three unsuccessful council candidates , Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris and state Controller Gray Davis , according to the twin settlements with the city and state agencies . By funneling the contributions through others , the marathon was able to exceed city and state limits on campaign contributions . &quot; The public established limits on campaign contributions to diffuse the distortion of the political process that money can have , &quot; said Ethics Commissioner Edwin Guthman , a USC journalism professor . &quot; This was a blatant attempt to circumvent those limits. &quot; The contributions to local politicians were made about the time in 1991 when the marathon firm was seeking an extension of its contract to put_on the race . The City_Council unanimously approved the new contract through 2000 . Guthman , Curtis and Commissioner Treesa W . Drury expressed incredulity that Burke , the majority shareholder in the marathon , would not have known about the money_laundering operation . In intensive questioning of the Ethics Commission staff , Guthman and Curtis noted that Burke admitted to personally authorizing the transfer of marathon funds to Beasley . An Ethics Commission staff report also noted that those who were reimbursed for their contributions included Burke ' s parents as well as other relatives and marathon employees . Three contributions were even made in the name of Burke ' s yacht , Star in Motion , according to the report . Those three checks were signed by a onetime marathon employee who also was skipper of Burke ' s boat . Guthman asked why Burke wasn ' t personally forced to accept responsibility , or at least to testify under oath . &quot; So many times in public life now people don ' t take responsibility for what they do , &quot; Guthman said . &quot; And here we are aiding and abetting . . . someone avoiding responsibility , and that troubles me. &quot; But Rebecca Avila , deputy director of the Ethics Commission , said the investigators could not prove Burke knew of the laundering operation once his longtime confidant , Beasley , accepted responsibility . &quot; In other words you had someone who was . . . willing to say he was fully responsible , &quot; Curtis said .</TEXT>
