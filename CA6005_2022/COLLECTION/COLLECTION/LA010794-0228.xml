   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT : BOND FUNDS ARE LIKELY TO BECOME A DICEY PROPOSITION THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Investors in bond mutual_funds collected healthy returns in 1993 , as falling interest_rates for much of the year boosted the value of older bonds . But for a taste of what might lie ahead , fund investors should focus_on fourth-quarter results alone : A gradual rise in interest_rates left many bond funds with net losses for the quarter . For that period , at least , money_market funds would have been a better investment . Despite the fourth-quarter turmoil , investors who sat in bond funds for all_of ' 93 earned total returns of between 6 % and 20 % , according to fund-tracker Lipper Analytical Services in New York . Those returns handily beat the 2.6 % average 1993 return on U.S. money_market funds . Total return counts both the interest earned ( the yield ) and the appreciation or depreciation of a fund ' s share price , which is a function of market interest_rate moves . As rates fall , older , higher-yielding bonds are naturally worth more , which means fund investors ' shares rise in value . Because market interest_rates have been mostly falling since 1989 , bond investors have enjoyed spectacular total returns in recent years , and especially in 1993 : * The average fund that owns long-term U.S._government bonds posted a total return of 9.3 % last year -- 6.4 % of which was yield , the rest price appreciation . * Long-term corporate_bond funds , especially high-yield junk_bond funds , generally performed better than U.S._government bond funds . Corporates ' yields were higher , and the value of the bonds also appreciated more as market rates fell . * Funds that own long-term tax-free municipal_bonds also sported high 1993 returns , as last summer ' s increase in federal income_tax rates boosted demand for the bonds , adding_to their price appreciation . The average long-term California muni fund had a total return of 12.6 % , only 5.4 % of which was yield . But few Wall Streeters believe that those returns are likely to be repeated in 1994 . If interest_rates continue to creep_up with the stronger economy , the price appreciation that boosted bonds in 1993 will turn_into price depreciation . The risk for bond fund investors -- who now have $ 621 billion entrusted to the funds -- is that market rates move_up so_much that price depreciation more_than negates any yield earned this year . Though fund owners by now ought to fully understand this risk , many experts worry that bond investors have been lulled into a false sense of security by five years of falling interest_rates . &quot; I think there ' s a great lack of perception that bond ( fund ) prices can decline , &quot; says Glen King Parker , publisher of Income &amp; Safety , a fund newsletter based in Fort Lauderdale , Fla . Fourth-quarter fund results , as noted in the accompanying chart , should serve as an early warning . For example , the average total return on U.S._government bond funds in the quarter was a negative 0.36 % : Though investors earned 1.6 % in interest for the quarter ( one-fourth of the 6.4 % annualized yield on the typical fund ) , that was effectively wiped_out because the share value of the funds fell nearly 2 % in the quarter , on average . * Of course , a fund pays_out its yield regardless of fluctuations in share price . For buy-and-hold investors who simply need current income , it may_not matter if higher interest_rates send bond fund values lower this year . Even so , there are steps that fund investors can take_to lessen their risk of loss from an upward turn_in interest_rates this year : * &quot; Ladder &quot; your portfolio . Investors who own long-term bond funds ( which often own bonds maturing in 10 years or more ) should spread some of that money into intermediate-term funds ( which own five- to 10-year bonds ) and shorter-term funds ( which own one- to five-year bonds ) , says Michael Lipper , head of Lipper Analytical . Intermediate-term and short-term bonds will drop less in value than long-term bonds if interest_rates rise across the board , Lipper notes . Though you ' ll earn a lower yield on shorter-term funds , you ' re also lowering the risk of significant loss to your bond investment by diversifying among maturities . Nearly all major fund companies offer funds of varying maturities , so diversification is easy . * Consider corporate and muni bonds . Many investors own U.S._government funds for their perceived safety . But if interest_rates continue to rise in an expanding economy , Treasury securities may depreciate far faster than corporate and muni bonds . Why should corporate and muni bonds hold their value better than Treasuries ? In the case of corporates , a stronger economy should bolster the finances of the companies behind the bonds . That makes high-yield corporate junk issues particularly attractive in 1994 -- at least for a portion of your bond investment -- even after their stellar returns in 1993 , says Income &amp; Safety ' s Parker . Muni bonds , meanwhile , should benefit as high-income investors pour more of their assets into tax-free investments , to offset higher tax_rates . * Go_with a general fund . Rather than hamstring yourself in a single bond category , ask your fund company if it offers a general fund -- one that can mix Treasury , corporate and even foreign bonds . That will automatically give you greater diversification in what is certain to be a dicey market in 1994 . How Bond Funds Fared Bond mutual_fund owners enjoyed a third year of good returns in 1993 . Bond yields were supplemented by share-prices appreciations as market interest_rates fell . 1993 total returns for key bond fund categories : Junk corporate : 19.3 % General bond : 12.9 % California muni : 12.6 U.S._government : 9.3 % Short-term corporate : 6.4 % Source : Lipper Analytical Services Bond Fund Benchmarks Here are average total returns for key categories of bond mutual_funds for three periods ended Dec . 31 .
