   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; SPOTLIGHT ; JUST ANOTHER GAME ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Brazilian Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said his team will not approach the July 4 game against the United States any differently . &quot; We will approach the opponent we ' re going to play like any other , &quot; Parreira said after Tuesday night ' s game against Sweden . &quot; If you reached the final 16 , you did so on merit. &quot; Dunga , a Brazilian midfielder , was a bit more forthcoming . &quot; They ' re a little bit of Europe , a little bit South_American , &quot; he said of the U.S. playing style . &quot; They take good care of the ball . They ' re not a team that just sends the ball mindlessly up the field. &quot; CHRIS DUFRESNE</TEXT>
