   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; ' SANTA CLAUSE ' GREATLY IMPROVES TIM ALLEN ' S STAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It looks_like an early Christmas for Tim Allen . The comedian has scored a rare triple_play with the top-rated TV_show in ABC ' s &quot; Home Improvement , &quot; a best-selling book and this weekend ' s second-highest-grossing movie , Disney ' s &quot; The Santa Clause. &quot; Based on that success , Allen seems poised to become one of Hollywood ' s most bankable comedic stars . On its opening weekend , &quot; The Santa Clause &quot; grossed $ 20 million at the box_office , making_it the third-best premiere for a Walt Disney film in history . Moreover , Allen scored in his first time at bat in all three areas -- TV , movies and publishing . &quot; I feel_like Newt Gingrich right now , &quot; said a jubilant Richard Baker , a partner in the talent management firm of Messina Baker Entertainment , the chief strategists behind Allen ' s career . &quot; Wait . . . maybe that doesn ' t sound so good , &quot; he said with a laugh . Whatever it sounds like , there ' s no denying that Baker and partner Rick Messina , who function as Allen ' s de_facto agents , have in Allen that rare crossover performer . And guess what ? His price_tag just went_up . &quot; Based on the successful opening of this film , Tim will be in the highest echelon of film salaries , &quot; Baker predicted . Baker won ' t quantify it , but observers expect Allen to get between $ 8 million and $ 10 million for his second film -- maybe more -- putting him in a league with Robin Williams and Tom Hanks . The measure that Baker and Messina are applying to Allen might be called the &quot; Jim Carrey multiple. &quot; Shortly after Carrey ' s &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective &quot; premiered with a $ 12-million opening weekend box_office , Carrey was able to command a $ 7-million fee for his next films . Until then , Carrey was_best known as one of the ensemble cast from Fox ' s &quot; In Living Color , &quot; a critically acclaimed but much lower-rated series than Allen ' s &quot; Home Improvement. &quot; Allen has a much higher profile than Carrey . &quot; Home Improvement &quot; is watched by about 40 million people each week . In its fourth year on ABC , the series has turned_out to be the second-highest-grossing prime-time network show in syndication , generating about $ 400 million for the rerun rights of the first 125 episodes . Including advances from syndication proceeds , Allen is said to earn $ 200 # 000 an episode -- or $ 5 million a season . Allen ' s success is also a big bonanza for Disney , which has essentially turned him into a franchise . Besides producing &quot; Home Improvement &quot; and &quot; The Santa Clause , &quot; the company ' s Hyperion books unit published Allen ' s &quot; Never Stand Too Close to a Naked Man , &quot; which is now entering its seventh week on the coveted New York Times bestseller list . Allen and co-writer David Rensin hammered_out the book earlier this spring during lunch breaks_in Allen ' s trailer on the set of &quot; Santa Clause &quot; in Toronto . At a recent management retreat , Disney Studios Chairman Joe Roth was already talking_of more projects with Allen . TV comedians have usually had a hard_time on the big screen , with Robin Williams one big exception . Bill Cosby experienced an embarrassing flop with &quot; Mystery Dad &quot; at the height of &quot; The Cosby Show , &quot; and Roseanne Arnold co-starred with Meryl Streep in the ill-fated &quot; She-Devil &quot; at her show ' s peak three years ago . Not that failure in movies has financially crimped either Cosby or Roseanne . Cosby ' s gross take from the rerun proceeds of his show is estimated at nearly $ 300 million and Roseanne ' s could be about a third of that -- although Money magazine recently declared , after inspecting her divorce papers , that Roseanne and husband Tom Arnold were among the worst money managers in the world . As might be expected , however , good_fortune brings its own set of problems . Allen -- who , unlike most other comedic actors has never had an agent -- lets his managers Baker and Messina field the offers and leaves the hard-tacks negotiating to his lawyer , Dennis Ardi of Shearman &amp; Sterling , a Wall_Street law_firm known more for its work in corporate securities than gross points percentages . &quot; We tried to get Tim an agent when we first started working with him , &quot; Baker recalled . &quot; No one wanted him until he booked the TV series . Then we started getting major agency interest , which increased after the series debuted . . . . The fact that he ' s had this much success without a legit agent is an interesting phenomenon. &quot; And of course , without an agent , Allen doesn ' t have to fork over 10 % of his earnings to a third_party . Though more movies are likely for Allen , Baker thinks they will be limited to about one a year . that ' s because he is contracted to do three more years of &quot; Home Improvement &quot; after this season , which leaves little time for extracurricular_activities -- no matter how lucrative the offers . Some observers credit Allen ' s success in &quot; The Santa Clause &quot; to Disney ' s marketing acumen . The studio found the right vehicle for the comedian . It then ran with the ball , plastering pictures of Allen in his Santa Claus get-up on countless billboards and bus_stops . But Baker rejects the notion that clever marketing alone has anything to do with Allen ' s success . He has heard people question the reasons for the comedian ' s success before , citing a trade magazine review of &quot; Home Improvement &quot; that described the pilot as a &quot; one-note show , and not a very good note at that. &quot; But Baker says Allen has tremendous drawing power . So , a TV_show , a book , a movie -- what ' s next ? &quot; Tim wants his own theme park , &quot; cracked Baker . &quot; Tim Al-land. &quot; Inside Hollywood : For more Company Town coverage and insightful analysis of the entertainment_industry , sign_on to the TimesLink on-line service and &quot; jump &quot; to keyword &quot; Inside Hollywood. &quot; Details on_Times electronic services , B4</TEXT>
