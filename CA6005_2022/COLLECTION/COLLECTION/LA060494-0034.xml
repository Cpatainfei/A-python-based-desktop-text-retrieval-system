   <HEADLINE> NEW HIGH_COURT JUSTICE SWORN IN ; LAW : STATE COMMISSION UNANIMOUSLY CONFIRMS KATHRYN WERDEGAR , WHO DECLINES TO STATE HER VIEWS ON THE DEATH_PENALTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kathryn M . Werdegar , an independent conservative and an old friend of Gov . Pete Wilson , was sworn_in Friday as a member of the California Supreme Court after a state commission unanimously confirmed her . The appointment of Werdegar , 58 , gives the court two female justices for the first time . A state Court of Appeal justice for three years , Werdegar is viewed_as generally conservative but likely to take more moderate positions on occasion than the other four conservatives on the seven-member high_court . She declined to state her views on the death_penalty during the one-hour hearing , even after a commissioner pressed her to say she would uphold the capital_punishment law despite any personal opposition . &quot; I don ' t anticipate any difficulty &quot; in abiding_by the law , she said . As a former research attorney to retired conservative Justice Edward Panelli , whom she is replacing , Werdegar helped write opinions upholding death sentences . But Sacramento Court of Appeal Justice Robert Puglia , one of the three members of the Commission on Judicial Appointments , asked her repeatedly if she would continue to support capital_punishment even if she had a &quot; personal epiphany. &quot; Assuming that the Constitution has been clearly interpreted , she replied , she could not envision such a scenario because &quot; our role and duty is to follow the Constitution. &quot; Wilson swore her in , recalling their days as classmates at UC Berkeley ' s Boalt Hall law_school , where Werdegar was one of four women in a class of 350 . &quot; Everybody wanted to carry Kay ' s books , &quot; Wilson remembered , until they saw her scores and decided instead to try &quot; to look_at her notes. &quot; Six witnesses , all_of them supportive , testified about her nomination in the formal hearing room in San Francisco where the California Supreme Court meets for oral arguments . UC Berkeley professor Jesse Choper argued that Werdegar ' s lack of trial experience would not be a handicap on the high_court . He noted that former U.S. Supreme Court Chief_Justices John_Marshall and Earl Warren were never trial_judges , nor were some of the California court ' s leading jurists . Other witnesses described Werdegar as &quot; disarmingly modest , &quot; thoughtful , quietly confident and a devoted mother and wife . Werdegar also worked for civil_rights as a Justice_Department attorney after graduating from George_Washington University law_school , to which she transferred from Boalt . Judge Thelton E . Henderson , chief judge of the U.S. District Court for Northern California , testified that she helped formulate the government position to get the late Martin_Luther_King Jr . freed from a Birmingham , Ala. , jail and advocated equal accommodations and equal voting_rights for blacks . As one of only two African Americans in his law_school class , Henderson said , he and Werdegar shared many similar perceptions of the law_school experience . Even though she graduated first in her class , law_firms would not give her a job because she was a woman , he said . A California bar commission rated Werdegar &quot; well-qualified &quot; for the high_court , the middle of three ratings given to qualified candidates . The only opposition Werdegar faced came_in a letter to the appointments commission by a California association of criminal defense_lawyers . The group said Werdegar ' s appointment will perpetuate &quot; single-mindedness on the court &quot; because she probably will go_along with its four conservative members who are &quot; often referred to as clones. &quot; James S . Thomson , president of the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice , also said the group felt &quot; great alarm &quot; that Werdegar had drafted many of Panelli ' s opinions upholding death sentences despite courtroom errors . Wilson chose Werdegar in the face of strong pressure to name a minority or a woman to the high_court in this election year . Justice Joyce Kennard , who is part Indonesian , is the only woman and minority now on the court . Wilson ' s only other high_court appointment , Justice Ronald George , a white_man , replaced Justice Allen Broussard , who is African American . Key Upcoming Cases Here are several key cases that Kathryn Werdegar , the newest member of the California Supreme Court , is expected to participate in . Werdegar is considered more moderate than the court ' s four other conservatives -- Chief_Justice Malcolm Lucas and Justices Ronald George , Armand Arabian and Marvin Baxter . * Gays : Can cities pass ordinances to prohibit job discrimination against gays ? Reviewing a San Francisco case , the court will decide whether such ordinances are preempted by state law . Supporters of the ordinances say they are necessary to ensure that victims can sue for harassment and recover attorney fees . * Bias : Can private clubs in California discriminate ? The case was brought by a woman who sued a San Mateo County country_club that prohibits women and children from becoming full voting members . &quot; Business_establishments &quot; in California are not allowed to discriminate , but a lower court ruled that the country_club was &quot; extremely private &quot; and the woman had no grounds for a legal challenge . The state Supreme Court ' s decision in this case could determine whether Boy_Scouts of America can bar gays and atheists from membership . * Hate : Are California ' s hate-crime laws constitutional ? The laws allow_for stiffer punishment if attacks are motivated by bigotry against a victim ' s race , color , ancestry , national origin , religion , disability or sexual orientation . The two cases before the court involve attacks on gay_men in San Francisco and on Latinos in San Diego . * Smoking : Can the use of the &quot; Old Joe Camel &quot; cigarette mascot in advertising be banned as an unfair business practice on the ground that it encourages minors to smoke ? The plaintiffs allege that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . is trying to target minors with the campaign . * Insurance : Are state rules aimed at giving rebates to insurance customers constitutional ? The case is a challenge to Proposition 103 , the insurance reform initiative passed_by voters in 1988 . The court ' s decision will help determine the authority of the state ' s insurance commissioner to regulate rates . * Homeless : How far can cities go_in regulating the homeless ? The court is reviewing the constitutionality of a Santa Ana ordinance that prohibits camping on public_property . * Affirmative_action : Are local ordinances that require contractors to try to hire minority- and women-owned subcontractors constitutional ? At issue is a Los Angeles law that a lower court held violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution . Compiled by Times researcher Norma Kaufman</TEXT>
