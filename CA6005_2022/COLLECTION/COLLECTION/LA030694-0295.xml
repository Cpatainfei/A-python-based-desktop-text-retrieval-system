   <HEADLINE> W . HOLLYWOOD MAY ORDER RATE CUT FOR CABLE TV</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> West Hollywood cable_television subscribers may soon get that long-awaited price_cut . Wielding powers granted by the new federal cable regulation law , the City_Council on Monday is expected to order Century Cable to trim nearly $ 4 off the price of its basic service package , now $ 24.08 a month . The council also may order refunds to the city ' s 11 # 000 subscribers retroactive to when regulation began in September . The action would be the city ' s first foray_into regulating cable_television rates , which skyrocketed after deregulation in 1986 . The 1992 cable law gave municipalities the right to regulate the cost of the most basic level of cable_television -- local broadcast channels plus government and public-access channels . Beverly Hills is also moving to roll back Century Cable rates before a March 17 deadline stipulated by the federal cable act . Santa Monica and Los Angeles officials are studying the rates in their cities . Cable customers have expected lower cable bills since the law was passed_over the veto of former President George_Bush . But instead , many West Hollywood residents were outraged last year when Century Cable repackaged its channels in such a way that customers ended_up paying about $ 8 more to watch the same programs . City officials , who have jousted with the cable firm in the past , helped direct a flood of complaints to the Federal Communications Commission . &quot; We ' ve probably received 600 letters and calls from people complaining , &quot; said Helen Goss , who oversees the city ' s cable_television operations . &quot; People in this community have passionate feelings about Century Cable. &quot; * About half of the city ' s homes are wired for cable , which is about the only way to ensure a good television picture because nearby hills block over-the-air signals . Century also provides cable service in Beverly Hills , Santa Monica and West Los Angeles . Goss said the city expects upcoming federal rules to spell additional cuts and tighter control over the cost of &quot; a_la_carte &quot; packages , which include channels such_as CNN and MTV that used to be part of basic service . The proposed $ 3.72 West Hollywood rollback is based on a complicated federal formula using figures provided by the cable company . The city hired a cable specialist to analyze the financial data . It is not known whether Century will fight the rollback . Company officials had sought to delay Monday ' s hearing because some executives planned to be out of the country , Goss said . But the city has to enact any reductions by March 18 . Century officials could not be reached for comment . Beverly Hills is considering a rollback of $ 1.68 and has filed a complaint with the FCC protesting the creation of the &quot; a_la_carte &quot; packages as an attempt to evade local regulation . Before September , Century offered a 52-channel basic service -- including CNN and other satellite channels -- for $ 26.15. After repackaging , a customer had to pay $ 34.39 to keep those channels and get nine new ones offered in a new expanded package . A new bare-bones basic tier -- containing mainly broadcast , government and public-access channels -- was priced at $ 24.08 .</TEXT>
