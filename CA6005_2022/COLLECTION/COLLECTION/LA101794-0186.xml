   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / JULIE CART ; LIEKOSKI FACES A DIFFICULT TASK GETTING U.S. INTO MEDAL ROUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Recently appointed U.S. Olympic Coach Timo Liekoski spent the weekend at a college tournament in South Carolina , scouting players for his Under-23 national team . Late one night he spoke with a group of coaches about why American players -- with all their athletic talent -- tend to lack the creativity that is at the heart of the game . Could the years of youth soccer car pools and perfectly lined fields dotted with orange cones have produced a generation of solid but unimaginative players ? &quot; I don ' t see the kids going_to a park and playing 2-on-2 soccer , like they do_in basketball , &quot; Liekoski said . &quot; In blacktop basketball you become creative to survive , because if you lose , you have to wait for 23 games to play again. &quot; Liekoski will spend the next year and a half attempting to cull the most creative players from the college ranks for his 1996 Olympic team in Atlanta . An assistant on the 1994 U.S. World Cup team , Liekoski will surely face the most difficult task ever for a U.S. Olympic soccer coach . Consider the context : There presumably will be a heightened interest in the tournament as a result of the World Cup . With the Olympics in the United States , the nation ' s patriotic fervor will not accept a non-medal performance . that ' s the rather high aim Liekoski has set for his team -- a place in the medal round . It has long been unattainable for the U.S. team , in part because of restrictions imposed by the American collegiate athletic system . World Cup Coach Bora Milutinovic , who rarely rules_out any job opportunity , made a face when asked if he would be interested in the Olympic job . &quot; Yes , it ' s the Olympics , &quot; Milutinovic said . &quot; But when would I get the players to train and play ? This is the problem. &quot; It ' s now Liekoski ' s problem . He has chosen to work within the system , rather than fight it . He ' ll make_do with training camps arranged around the players ' academic and vacation schedules . &quot; we ' ll make the most of the time we get , &quot; Liekoski said . Only in January 1996 will the players assemble for their final preparation , preferably at one of the Olympic soccer venues or a place with similar climate . Liekoski and his fellow Olympic coaches will have an interesting card to play in 1996 -- the use of three overage ( older than 23 ) players . Among Americans who have shown an interest are World Cup players Thomas Dooley , Brad Friedel , Claudio Reyna and Alexi Lalas . &quot; Our success in the World Cup has greatly increased the expectations , &quot; Liekoski said . &quot; But if I do my job right , the pressure will take_care of itself. &quot; * Depending_on whom you ask , World Cup ' 94 will / will not give a final financial accounting of the tournament to FIFA next week in New York . But whether the surplus is $ 20 million as the Organizing Committee projected for two years , or $ 40 million to $ 50 million as Alan Rothenberg claimed during his reelection campaign , the key thing to remember is that the money will be turned_over to the U.S. Soccer Federation Foundation as the World Cup ' s most visible &quot; legacy. &quot; Forget about the soccer fields that were never built_in the housing projects , this money will be the real fuel for soccer in the decades to come . Or should be . The first order_of_business for the Foundation will be to hire an executive_director . Presumably , the director will carry_out the wishes of the Foundation ' s board , but we ' ve heard little of late regarding the Foundation ' s agenda or priorities . Assuming a surplus of $ 40 million , what will that actually translate into for soccer ? According to one board_member , the Foundation will invest most of its funds and give_out / loan only 5 % a year . that ' s $ 2 million . &quot; It ' s not a lot , &quot; acknowledged a board_member . The real amount of the seed money could be affected by the outcome of the IRS ' s continuing investigation of World Cup ' 94 ' s $ 5-million &quot; loan &quot; to Major_League Soccer . Despite officials ' assurances that the transfer of money from the non-profit World Cup Organizing Committee to the for-profit MLS was legal , the IRS has not concluded as much . * Italian soccer has been caught_up in the national corruption investigation , this one targeting clubs for tax_evasion and irregularities in the transfer market . It seemed inevitable that soccer -- Italy ' s fourth-largest industry -- would be included in the far-reaching investigation . &quot; Operation Offside &quot; began with raids on some of the country ' s biggest clubs . Documents were seized from 34 first and second division clubs by the Guardia di Finanza . The suspicion is that most Italian clubs are heavily in debt and club officials juggle the books to keep the clubs afloat . Few clubs are immune from the investigation , including mighty AC Milan , owned by Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi . Even the president of the Italian Football Federation is under investigation for abuse of office . &quot; Let ' s not panic , &quot; federation President Antonio Matarrese told the Italian newspaper La Stampa . &quot; We haven ' t fooled anyone , we have nothing to hide. &quot; * As punishment for fan violence , AC Milan has had two points deducted and finds itself at the bottom of its group in the European Champions ' League . UEFA , the governing body for European soccer , took the step against the defending champion as a consequence of the actions of Milan ' s crowd during a Sept . 28 game . In that match at Milan ' s San Siro Stadium , the goalkeeper for Casino Salzburg suffered a concussion from a half-filled plastic bottle thrown by a fan . Milan Coach Fabio Capello accused the goalkeeper of faking the injury in the game that Milan won , 3-0 . Also , Salzburg was fined $ 7 # 500 because its fans lit fireworks in the stadium and Milan was ordered to play its next two matches in the competition at least 200 miles from San Siro .</TEXT>
