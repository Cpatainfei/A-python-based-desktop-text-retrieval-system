   <HEADLINE> EAST COPIES CALIFORNIA SMOG CURBS ; POLLUTION : EPA APPROVES REQUEST BY 12 STATES FROM VIRGINIA TO MAINE THAT LOW-EMISSION STANDARDS BE IMPOSED . MOVE IS EFFORT TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday took a major step toward bringing cleaner cars to 12 Eastern states by approving use of California ' s stringent pollution controls from Virginia to Maine . &quot; We are pleased that the EPA has successfully completed this step toward getting cleaner air in our region , &quot; said Timothy Keeney , head of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection and a member of the Ozone Transport Commission , a group of state environmental commissioners designated by the 12 governors to clean_up the region ' s smoggy air . Under the plan , which requires approval by the individual states , cars , beginning with 1999 models , will have 70 % less emissions than today ' s new cars in Connecticut , Delaware , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , Virginia and the District_of_Columbia , according to the EPA . The plan for the Eastern states is modeled after California ' s low-emission vehicle standards , adopted in 1990 , which call_for slashing smog-forming gases from cars sold between 1994 and 2003 . The states , however , did not request permission to adopt the most controversial component of California ' s standards -- a mandate for_sales of mass-produced electric_cars beginning in 1998 . The committee of 12 states requested EPA approval to adopt California ' s special standards because they face a mandate under the federal Clean Air Act to clean_up ozone , a caustic urban pollutant that forms mainly from motor_vehicle exhaust . Eleven of the 12 states violate the health standard for ozone and must clean_up their air or face a freeze on federal highway funding . &quot; They asked_for_it and we ' ve given it to them and now the ball is back in their court , &quot; said Nancy Sutley , special assistant to EPA Administrator Carol Browner . &quot; We had to make a technical finding that they needed ( these standards ) . There were a lot of different positions on whether this is the best way to go. &quot; To meet low-emission standards , cars will have to be fueled either by alternative fuels such_as natural_gas , or equipped with such new devices as electrically heated catalysts that dramatically cut fumes from gasoline-powered engines . The decision is a boost to companies and utilities that support alternative fuels and to California air-quality officials , who for years have been under pressure to scale back their standards that require new automotive_technologies . While it appears something of a setback for the automobile_industry , which has fought a regional approach to pollution controls and prefers national standards , Browner said an industry proposal is still under_consideration . Under that plan , cars that produce less pollution than now , though more_than the amount permitted by California , would be sold in all 49 states other_than California . It would override regional requirements . &quot; We believe this broader agreement would be the most sensible and cost-effective way of bringing clean air to Americans , &quot; Browner said in a statement . &quot; EPA will continue to convene and support negotiations toward this broader agreement. &quot; Representing Detroit ' s Big Three auto_makers , the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn . said in a statement Monday that the &quot; EPA is sending a strong signal to the newly elected governors in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states that one of their first priorities in office must be to tackle this issue. &quot; The auto_manufacturers group estimates that the new 12-state standards would add about $ 800 to the sticker price of a new car beginning with 1999 models , compared to $ 576 under their proposal for a 49-state approach . EPA officials were forced to act this month on the states ' plan , which was proposed in February , 1993 , because Massachusetts and some environmental groups threatened to sue . But by simultaneously announcing that the EPA will still work toward an alternative agreement , Browner tried to appease the auto industry . &quot; This move will mean cleaner air in the Northeast , &quot; Alfred Munzer , a former president of the American Lung Assn. , told Associated Press . &quot; It will help reduce the health threat that air_pollution poses for children , the elderly and many other vulnerable members of the population , especially those with lung disease. &quot;</TEXT>
