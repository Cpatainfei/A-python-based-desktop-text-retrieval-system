   <HEADLINE> THE TOP 50 MOST COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT SOUTHLAND REAL_ESTATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> 1 . Is this a good time to buy a house ? Experts would say yes , if you meet the following criteria : -- Are not counting_on price appreciation in the short term . Most experts don ' t expect home prices to inflate much in Southern California in the next couple of years . -- Can afford the monthly payments . Remember , the Southland is one of the most expensive housing markets in the United States . -- Plan to stay in the house long enough for the appreciation to cover your transaction costs . The costs of buying and selling a home include real_estate commissions , lender fees and closing costs that can amount to more_than 10 % of the sales price . -- Need a tax_break . The mortgage interest deduction can make homeownership very appealing . -- Prefer to be an owner rather than a renter . -- Can handle the maintenance expenses and headaches . -- Are not greatly concerned by dips in home values . 2 . How do I figure what I can afford to buy ? Roughly , it ' s three times your annual income . Real_estate experts strongly recommend people get pre-qualified by a lender as a way of calculating exactly how much of a home they can afford . When qualifying people for a loan , lenders look_at a borrower ' s full financial standing . Lenders use the relationship between the borrower ' s projected PITI , or principal , interest , taxes and insurance payments , and their gross monthly income . Generally , lenders like to see the PITI not exceed 30 % to 33 % of the borrower ' s gross monthly income . They also consider the ratio of the borrower ' s monthly debt payments , including the PITI , to income . Some lenders have flexibility in these qualifying ratios . 3 . What is considered a low down_payment ? Anything less than the standard 20 % . However , many people borrow with less than 20 % down by obtaining private mortgage insurance ( PMI ) . And numerous programs are available to help first-time buyers with little or no down_payment , including Federal_Housing_Administration ( FHA ) , Veterans Administration ( VA ) and Federal National Mortgage Assn. ' s ( Fannie Mae ) Community Home_Buyers Program . 4 . How much does PMI cost ? &quot; PMI costs vary from one mortgage insurance_firm to another , but premiums usually run about 0.5 % of the loan amount for the first year of the loan . Most PMI premiums are a bit lower for subsequent years . The first year ' s mortgage insurance_premium is usually paid in_advance at the close of escrow , and there is usually a separate PMI approval process , &quot; writes Dian Hymer , author of &quot; Buying and Selling a Home_in California , A Complete Guide &quot; ( Chronicle Books ) . 5 . Can I drop my PMI ? California Civil Code 2954.6 , a disclosure law , requires lenders to notify borrowers within 30 days after the close of escrow whether the borrower has the right to cancel private mortgage insurance . The code also requires lenders or servicers to provide borrowers with an annual notice concerning each borrower ' s right to terminate PMI . Civil Code 2954.7 grants borrowers the right to terminate PMI under certain limited circumstances . Generally , to drop PMI , the loan must be at least 2 years old and the borrower cannot have made any late payments in the last year . In addition , the loan-to-value ratio must be less than 75 % . 6 . How much should I set_aside for maintenance expenses ? According to Bob Vilas , author of &quot; Guide to Buying Your Dream House , &quot; ( Little , Brown &amp; Co. ) : &quot; For maintenance , depending_on the age and condition of the house , you should allocate about 1 % of the purchase_price annually. &quot; 7 . Is it better to make as large a down_payment as possible ? Putting_down as little as possible and taking a larger mortgage allows buyers to take full advantage of the tax_benefits of homeownership . Mortgage interest ( and property_taxes ) are fully deductible from state and federal income_taxes . However , other real_estate experts say it may be more prudent to make a larger down_payment and thereby reduce the amount of debt that must be financed . 8 . Can I buy a house with nothing down ? Although some experts advise against it , home_buyers interested in buying a house with nothing down can do so . But it ' s not easy finding these loans and in some cases they can be risky . Occasionally , a builder will offer nothing-down loans to induce sales in an otherwise slow-moving project . Desperate sellers also may agree to finance the full purchase_price to get_out from under a property . The VA loan program allows buyers to qualify for a nothing-down loan , as well as a loan program offered through the California Public Employees Retirement System . 9 . What programs does the FHA offer ? The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) offers a variety of loan insurance programs through FHA that require about 4 % to 5 % cash down . The down_payment must be the buyer ' s own money -- gift money is not allowed -- but buyers can finance all non-recurring closing costs . FHA loan limits vary depending_on the county where the property is located . Recently , the FHA loan limit was increased to $ 151 # 725 , but only in high cost areas such_as Los Angeles . FHA loans are originated and serviced by private lenders . 10 . What special programs exist for veterans ? VA loans are attractive because in some cases they require no down_payment . With the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs , there is no restriction on the purchase_price . For more information , call the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs at ( 800 ) 827-1000 . In addition , the California Department of Veterans Affairs offers a home loan program . Cal-Vet actually buys the subject property from the seller and resells the property to the veteran on a land contract . The department holds title until the veteran has repaid the amount owed , although the veteran has the right to possession of the property as his or her personal residence . For specific information about Cal-Vet programs and requirements , call ( 310 ) 944-2366 . 11 . Can people who served in the National_Guard use the VA loan program ? Yes , but the qualifying requirements may be more stringent and loan fees for National_Guard veterans are generally more costly . 12 . How does the Community Home_Buyers Program work ? The program is sponsored by Fannie Mae , the Federal National Mortgage Assn. , and administered through participating lenders . The program has an income cap of 115 % of the area ' s median income . In addition , the borrower must attend a seminar on homeownership and the home-buying process . The program allows_for 95 % financing . The borrower may put_down as little as 3 % of his or her own money , with the remaining 2 % coming_in the form of a family gift or loan from a government or nonprofit agency . For a list of participating lenders , call Fannie Mae at ( 800 ) 732-6643 . 13 . What are the standard contingencies in a purchase offer ? According to author Dian Hymer , &quot; Most real_estate purchase_contracts include at least two contingencies . A financing contingency makes the purchase conditional on the buyers ' ability to obtain a loan commitment from a lender . An inspection contingency allows the buyers to have professionals inspect the property to their satisfaction. &quot; 14 . Can I get a home loan with bad credit ? A poor credit history makes_it harder to qualify for a mortgage . There are numerous types of credit report problems that cause a lender to reject a loan_application , says Ilyce R . Glink in &quot; 100 Questions Every First-Time Home_Buyer Should Ask &quot; ( Random House ) : &quot; ' If you ' ve ever missed a credit_card payment , or been late with a credit_card payment , or defaulted_on a prior mortgage or school or car loan , it will probably show_up on your credit report . If you ' ve filed for bankruptcy within the past seven years , that will show_up on your credit report . If you haven ' t paid your taxes , or there has been a judgment filed against you ( perhaps for non-payment of spousal or child_support ) , it will also show_up . Failure to pay your landlord , doctor or hospital may turn_into a black spot on your credit report. &quot; 15 . How can I find_out what my credit report says about me ? Anyone concerned about their credit history can order a copy of_their_own report by calling the three main national credit reporting agencies : Equifax ( 800 ) 685-1111 ; TRW ( 800 ) 392-1122 , or Trans Union ( 312 ) 408-1050 . 16 . Can I legally buy a house with a_couple_of friends or investors ? Yes . The investment approach -- equity sharing -- isn ' t very popular when homes aren ' t appreciating because investors disappear . However , the &quot; tenants in common &quot; ( TIC ) way of holding title is becoming more popular , especially among first-time buyers as a way to purchase property collectively with other unrelated individuals . Generally , TIC properties are eligible for many of the same loan programs as homes owned by individuals , but the underwriting standards are more complicated because the lender must consider the financial situation of all_the parties who hold an interest in the property . 17 . How do lease options help people buy a home ? According to the &quot; Realty Bluebook , 29th Edition &quot; ( Dearborn Financial Publishing ) , a lease with an option to purchase is a tool sellers can use to induce a sale , where the buyer lacks sufficient funds for down_payment and closing costs . Option amounts vary from one deal to another . Lease options generally provide that a portion of the rent is applied toward the purchase if the option is exercised , referred to as rent credit . 18 . What is the mortgage credit certificate program ? The mortgage credit certificate ( MCC ) program is a federal income_tax credit for qualified first-time home_buyers . The credit , which often totals in excess of $ 1 # 000 , reduces the borrower ' s federal tax_liability by that amount . Both the borrower ' s income and the purchase_price of the home must fall within established guidelines . A limited number of California cities have authorized the MCC program . Interested home_buyers should contact their municipal housing departments . 19 . Will sellers consider only offers close to , or at , full price ? &quot; While a very low offer in a normal market might be rejected immediately , in a buyer ' s market the below-market offer will usually either be accepted or generate a counteroffer . When few offers are being made , an outright rejection of offers becomes unlikely , &quot; writes William H . Pivar in &quot; Real_Estate Investing From A to Z &quot; ( Probus Publishing ) . Plus , he said , &quot; There are always some sellers who for some reason must sell quickly &quot; and will consider a reduced price . There are other considerations : -- Is the offer contingent upon anything such_as the sale of the buyer ' s current house ? -- Is the offer made on the house &quot; as is , &quot; or does the buyer want the seller to make some repairs before close of escrow ? -- Is the offer all cash ? An offer at less than the asking price may be more attractive to the seller than a full-price offer with a financing contingency . 20 . How do adjustable-rate loans work ? Adjustable-rate mortgages rise and fall with interest_rates , based on several indexes that cause the cost of funds for lenders to go_up or down . The most common indexes used in California are the 11th District Cost of Funds ( an average of the cost of funds to the 11th Federal Home_Loan_Bank District institutions ) , Treasury Securities ( T-bills ) , Certificates_of_Deposit ( CDs ) and Libor ( London inter-bank offering rate ) . The Times publishes current ARM index rates in the Sunday Real_Estate section . The interest_rate and payment adjustments may or may_not be scheduled to change at_the_same_time . For example , the interest_rate on some plans changes more frequently than the monthly payment , which may result in negative amortization . 21 . Is there such a thing as a no-cost loan ? The state ' s real_estate regulatory_agency , the Department of Real_Estate , is cracking_down on mortgage brokers who claim to offer &quot; no cost &quot; and &quot; no fee &quot; loans . According to DRE spokesman Pablo Wong , &quot; Advertising claims by brokers of ' no cost ' or ' no fee ' loans are patently misleading and are in violation of the State of California Business and Professional Code Section. &quot; that ' s because borrowers are actually paying a higher interest_rate on the so-called &quot; no cost &quot; loan in exchange for not having to pay fees or closing costs up front when the loan is secured . No matter what lenders claim , &quot; there is no free lunch , &quot; said Wong . A zero-point loan is one where the lender does not charge points ( one point is equal_to 1 % of the loan amount ) . But there are other fees involved in no-point loans , as with most loans . 22 . How can I find a good real_estate_agent ? Here are some tips for finding an agent suggested by author Dian Hymer : &quot; The best sources of contacts are friends or associates who have bought or sold recently and can recommend agents . Be sure to ask your colleagues if they would use the agent again . &quot; If personal contacts don ' t generate enough leads , call the managers of reputable local real_estate companies and ask_for recommendations of agents who specialize in your neighborhood if you ' re selling . Find_out if the agent works full time at real_estate and how much experience the agent has. &quot; 23 . I ' m a buyer and want my own agent , how do I go_about it ? In California , it ' s legal for an agent to represent the buyers exclusively in the transaction and be paid a commission by the sellers . More and more buyers are going a step further , hiring and paying_for their own agent , referred to as buyers brokers . 24 . What should I do if I suspect my real_estate_agent has done something unethical or illegal ? Report the agent to the enforcement division of the Department of Real_Estate . If the agent is a member of a local association of realtors , a breach of ethics can be reported to one of these trade groups , which are listed in the telephone_book . The local associations have a disciplinary procedure that promises to root_out problem agents . They also have the power to revoke the agent ' s membership in the trade group . Consumers who suffered an economic hardship from doing business with a licensed real_estate_agent can appeal for relief from a special state fund . Twelve percent of every agent ' s license fee is deposited in this Real_Estate Recovery Fund , which is used to pay damages to consumers from civil action taken against a licensee in cases where the agent has no funds to pay the judgment . 25 . Where do you find a fixer-upper ? So-called &quot; diamonds in the rough &quot; -- distressed properties or fixer-uppers -- can be found in most communities , even the wealthier neighborhoods . A distressed property is one that has been poorly maintained and has a lower market_value than other houses in the immediate area . The basic strategy for a fixer-upper is to find the least desirable house in the most_desirable neighborhood and then decide if the expenses needed to bring the value of that property up_to its full potential market_value are within one ' s budget . Most experts say buyers should avoid rundown houses that need major structural repairs . 26 . Where can I find HUD-repossessed homes ? HUD-owned properties can be purchased only through a licensed real_estate_broker . HUD acquires properties from lenders who foreclose on mortgages insured by HUD . These properties are available for_sale to both homeowner occupants and investors . HUD pays the broker ' s commission up_to 6 % of the sales price . Buyers should be aware that HUD homes are sold &quot; as is , &quot; meaning limited repairs were made but no structural or mechanical warranties implied . In Los Angeles , call ( 800 ) 275-6747 or stop by 1615 W . Olympic Blvd . for more information . 27 . How do you determine which areas are more prone to earthquakes ? There are several sources to research seismic information . The U.S. Geological Survey , located in Menlo Park , can be reached by calling ( 415 ) 853-8300 . State geologists have designated special studies zones along earthquake faults . These designations may_not disclose all risks -- San Francisco is not within a special study zone because the fault doesn ' t run right through the city . Check maps kept at your local city or county planning department to find_out if a property is within a special studies zone . In addition , state law requires home sellers to disclose if their property is within a Seismic Hazards Zone . 28 . Is there any state agency that governs condominium associations ? No . However , condominium associations are subject_to the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act , a portion of the California Civil Code . The Department of Real_Estate regulates units up until they are sold by the developer . Then no one does . Condominium associations are self-regulated by covenants , codes and restrictions ( CC &amp; Rs ) and bylaws . 29 . How are property_taxes calculated in California ? According to the rules of Proposition 13 , property_taxes are limited to 1.1 % of the market_value of a house . The 1978 tax measure limits increases in the taxable value of property to 2 % a year but allows property to be reassessed at its market_price when it is sold . One year after the passage of Proposition 13 , voters approved Proposition 8 , which permits the assessor to lower property assessments after considering reductions in value due_to damage , destruction , depreciation or other factors . 30 . I want to move_out of the city and buy another house to retire . Can I take my property_tax bill with me ? Yes , as long as the new house is of equal or lesser value than the previous home . Twelve counties have ordinances allowing people over age 55 and disabled people moving from another county to carry their old property_tax assessment , presuming they meet all state requirements for Proposition 60 or Proposition 90 . Those counties are Alameda , Inyo , Kern , Los Angeles , Marin , Modoc , Orange , Riverside , San Diego , San Mateo , Santa Clara and Ventura . 31 . Are property_taxes deductible from federal and state income_taxes ? Property_taxes on all real_estate , including those levied by state and local_governments and school districts , are fully deductible against current state and federal income_taxes . 32 . The value of my house has gone_down . Can I deduct the loss in value from my income_taxes ? No . &quot; The IRS allows no deductions for losses on the sale of_your_own home . There ' s no way to use a loss to your advantage on your income_tax_return . It won ' t matter what type of misfortune you may have run_into , &quot; write Edith Lank and Miriam Geisman in &quot; Your Home as a Tax_Shelter &quot; ( Dearborn Financial Publishing ) . 33 . What will increase the value of my property ? Several factors , including overall market trends , the condition of the property , specific home improvements and neighborhood stability can influence property values . The greatest rise in home prices occurs when the economy is strong and the number of home sales is increasing . In recent times in California , that has occurred twice -- in the early 1980s and the late 1980s . During those two periods , almost all property in the state appreciated . However , single-family homes appreciated much more_than condominiums . While overall market conditions are out of the homeowner ' s control , other factors are not . For example , specific home improvements may increase the value above the cost of the improvements . According to a report by Remodeling magazine , a bathroom remodeled in the Los Angeles area returns 75 % to the owner , a bathroom addition 102 % and a master_bedroom suite 78 % . 34 . What is the best way for a married_couple to hold title ? Married_persons in California may take title to real_property as joint tenants or tenants in common . In addition , they have a choice unmarried owners don ' t have : to take title as community_property , which is the option that many experts recommend . When one spouse dies , property held as community_property goes directly to the surviving spouse without formal probate , unless the deceased left their half to someone other_than their spouse . In cases of &quot; tenancy-in-common , &quot; there is no right of survivorship . 35 . We are facing foreclosure . Would a deed in lieu of foreclosure be better ? A property foreclosure is one of the most damaging events in a borrower ' s credit history ; a deed in lieu of foreclosure is not as negative . &quot; A deed in lieu of foreclosure , &quot; according to &quot; California Real_Estate Principles , Third Edition , &quot; Charles O . Stapleton III , Martha R . Williams and Thomas J . Morgan ( Dearborn Financial Publishing ) , &quot; ' may be used to transfer property to the beneficiary of a trust_deed . This may be done , with the beneficiary ' s consent , to prevent a forced sale . Transfer of the property to the beneficiary may be to the beneficiary ' s advantage if the property is worth at least the amount of the remaining debt . The trustor benefits by avoiding the publicity of a public foreclosure sale. &quot; According to John W . Reilly , author of &quot; The Ultimate Language of Real_Estate , 4th Edition , &quot; ( Dearborn Financial Publishing ) , &quot; A deed in lieu of foreclosure is sometimes known as a friendly foreclosure , because it is settled by agreement rather than by civil action . The major disadvantage to this type of default settlement is that the mortgagee takes the real_estate subject_to all junior liens , whereas foreclosure eliminates all such liens. &quot; 36 . Can you explain reverse mortgage loans ? Many long-time homeowners consider a reverse annuity mortgage ( RAM ) , which enables them to borrow against the equity in their homes so they can receive monthly payments needed to help meet living costs . Under this plan , the flow of funds is in reverse to a conventional loan . The homeowner receives periodic ( not necessarily equal ) payments based on accumulated equity , according to author John W . Reilly . Many homeowners who worked to pay_off a mortgage have shunned the RAM program because they are hesitant to take_on new debt . 37 . What expenses beyond mortgage interest are tax deductible ? &quot; Points paid by the buyer are deductible for that year , &quot; say authors Edith Lank and Miriam S . Geisman . In a new ruling by the IRS , even points paid by the seller are deductible . An amended tax_return must be filed to take_advantage of this benefit . Non-deductible expenses include title insurance , loan-application fee , credit report , appraisal fee , service fee , settlement or closing fees , bank attorney ' s fee , attorney ' s fee , document preparation fee and recording fees . 38 . My house has been_on the market for six months and it won ' t sell , what should I do ? Even in a down market , real_estate experts say price and condition are the two most important factors_in selling a home . So , the first_step is to lower the price . Also , go_through the house and see if there are cosmetic defects that you missed and can be repaired . Home sellers should make_sure that the home is getting the exposure it deserves through open_houses , broker open_houses , advertising , good signage and a listing on the Multiple Listing Service . If the seller is using a real_estate_agent and the property isn ' t getting that exposure , find another agent . 39 . Who should pay the closing costs ? Closing costs vary from one transaction to another and often total in the thousands of dollars . They may be paid_up front or added_to the buyer ' s loan balance . However , anxious sellers may offer to pay some or all_of the costs to induce a sale . If one or more real_estate_agents are involved , their commissions are traditionally based on the sales price and paid by the seller at the time of closing . As for typical costs and who usually pays what , real_estate writers Ralph Warner , Ira Serkes and George Devine , authors of &quot; How to Buy a House in California , &quot; 2nd California Edition , ( Nolo Press ) , state them as follows : Buyer pays : escrow fees , deed preparation fees ; recording fees ; pest control inspection ; as well as roof and other inspection charges . Seller pays : title search ; title insurance for buyer / owner ; reconveyance deed ; documentary transfer_tax , and for the one-year home warranty . 40 . The price of my home has gone_down . Can I sell it for less than the loan amount ? Some home sellers in this situation can sell for less than the amount of the mortgage . It is called a &quot; short_sale &quot; or a &quot; short payoff , &quot; and may be accomplished by negotiating with your lender . A real_estate_agent or a lawyer can help in the negotiations . A short_sale may be complicated if the loan has been sold into the secondary market because then the lender will have to get permission from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac ( Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. ) to negotiate a short_sale . Fannie Mae spokesperson Bonnie O ' Dell says the secondary market giant has a policy of looking_at each loan individually . If the loan was a low down_payment mortgage with PMI , then the lender also must involve the mortgage insurance_company that insured the loan down_payment loan . 41 . How can I avoid paying capital_gains taxes ? In considering capital_gains tax from the sale of a primary residence , the critical time frame is two years . Generally , the capital_gain is the difference between the original sales price , capital improvements and some closing costs and the eventual sales price . Tax on the gain may be deferred if the sellers buy another home of equal or greater value within 24 months . People over 55 can qualify for a one-time capital_gains exemption of $ 125 # 000 . 42 . What is a seller obligated to disclose ? Under California law , the seller and the seller ' s broker , if there is one , are required to disclose all &quot; facts materially affecting the value or desirability of the property which are known or accessible only to him &quot; and which are &quot; not known to , or within reach of the diligent attention and observation of the buyer. &quot; In the case of residential properties , the seller must provide the buyer with a real_estate transfer disclosure statement , which specifies the existence and condition of all known physical attributes of the property . &quot; Sellers are responsible_for disclosing only information within their personal knowledge . They don ' t have to hire professionals to answer the questions on the disclosure form , &quot; says real_estate writer George Devine , author of &quot; For Sale by Owner &quot; ( Nolo Press ) . However , sellers must fill_out the form in good_faith . Some of the items sellers disclose include homeowners ' association dues ; whether or not work done on the house met local building_codes and permit requirements ; the presence of any neighborhood nuisances or noises that a prospective buyer might not notice , such_as a dog that barks every night or poor TV reception ; any death within three years on the property ; and any restrictions on the use of the property , such_as zoning ordinances or association rules . 43 . Is it difficult to sell your house yourself to avoid paying a commission ? While many real_estate experts recommend that home sellers engage the services of a licensed real_estate_agent , as_many as 16 % to 19 % of all home sellers sell their homes without the use of these services , according to the National Assn . of Realtors ( NAR ) . A 1992 NAR survey showed that 30 % of all sellers who sold their homes themselves would not do so again the next time . Legal issues a seller should consider include discrimination laws , disclosure laws and laws governing advertising . False or misleading advertising is against the law , and certain terms and disclosures must be included if you are advertising the specifics of a financing package . For sellers determined to sell the property themselves , various guide books are available explaining the process step-by-step . 44 . What should I do to prepare my house to show ? Making your home look as nice as possible may seem obvious . Apparently , it ' s not , because many sellers don ' t do much beyond vacuuming the living room rug and maybe cleaning the ring off the bathtub , says author George Devine . Short of spending a lot of money , Devine offers several steps people can take_to make their home show better : -- Sweep the sidewalk , mow the lawn , prune the bushes , weed the garden and clean debris from the yard . -- Clean the windows ( both inside and out ) and make_sure the paint is not chipped or flaking . -- Be sure that the doorbell works . -- Clean and make attractive all rooms , furnishings , floors , walls and ceilings . It ' s especially important that the bathroom and kitchen are spotless . -- Organize closets . -- Make_sure the basic appliances and fixtures work . Get_rid_of leaky faucets and frayed cords . -- Ensure that the house smells good : from an apple_pie , cookies baking or spaghetti_sauce simmering on the stove . Hide the kitty litter . -- Put vases of fresh flowers throughout the house . -- Pleasant background music is a nice touch . 45 . Where can I find foreclosure properties for_sale ? &quot; Notice of foreclosure must be published once a week for three weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the city where the property is located or in the city nearest the property in the county where a newspaper is published , &quot; according to the authors of &quot; California Real_Estate Principles , &quot; 3rd Edition , ( Dearborn Financial Publishing ) . For a buyer serious about finding a foreclosure , subscribing_to a legal publication may be a first_step , recommends author William H . Pivar . &quot; Many people don ' t even know of the existence of these legal papers . Therefore , default and foreclosure notices published in such papers are likely to mean fewer pre-foreclosure buyers as well as fewer bidders than if the notices had been published in a general newspaper , &quot; Pivar says . Also , written notice describing the property and announcing the time and place of sale is posted for 20 days on the property and in a public place in the city where the sale is to occur . 46 . I want to buy a foreclosure house &quot; as is. &quot; Does this mean there could be problems ? Yes , particularly for inexperienced buyers . Buying directly at the legal foreclosure sale is a risky and dangerous business . It is strictly &quot; buyer beware , &quot; cautions James I . Wiedemer in his book , &quot; The Smart_Money Guide to Bargain Homes , How to Find and Buy Foreclosures &quot; ( Dearborn Financial Publishing ) . The process has many disadvantages . There is no financing -- such purchases require cash and lots of it . The title needs to be checked_in some manner before the purchase or the buyer could buy a seriously deficient title . The property ' s condition is not well known and generally , an interior inspection of the property is not possible before the sale , says Wiedemer . In addition , only foreclosure and estate ( probate ) sales are exempt from California ' s disclosure laws . In both cases , the law protects the seller , usually an heir or financial_institution who has recently acquired the property through adverse circumstances and may have little or no direct information about it . 47 . What happens at a trustee sale ? Trustee sales are advertised in_advance and they require an all-cash bid . Author Wiedemer says the sale is usually conducted by a lawyer , sheriff or constable acting as trustee . They may or may_not be helpful and sometimes downright difficult to work with , he writes . The sale begins when the lender who holds the first loan on the property starts the bidding at the amount of the loan being foreclosed . Keep_in mind that sophisticated investors are present , so novices may find themselves among stiff competition for foreclosed property . The successful bidder at the foreclosure sale can look_forward to a trustee ' s deed , which usually is delivered the following day , Wiedemer says . 48 . How does the lender know how much the projected rents will be_on a rental property ? An appraiser does a rent survey to determine rents in the area . The amount a landlord can expect to receive in monthly rent largely depends_on what the property has rented for in the past , the condition of the building , its location and the current housing market . Lenders also look_at other cash flow considerations . They want to know if the owner has enough reserves on_hand to cover predictable and unforeseen expenses , such_as property insurance , taxes , regular maintenance and repairs . 49 . Can a person who has rented_out their house for the last three years sell that house and defer capital_gains tax by using the money to purchase a new residence ? Different tax rules apply to income properties and a primary residence . Pamela MacLean , spokeswoman for the Internal Revenue Services ' Oakland office says , &quot; If people have rented_out a property that was once their primary residence , they have converted that property to a rental or business property . &quot; If they are taking the tax_benefits of a business property , like depreciation , which you cannot do on a personal home , you must back_up and take special steps if you want the benefit of capital_gains rollover . That is a benefit reserved for personal residence , &quot; MacLean says . 50 . I recently bought a rental property and want to make_sure I maintain a good relationship with the tenants . Where can I find_out how to legally write leases , charge for repairs , etc ? Landlords can turn_to several good_books for legal and management advice . Some , such_as the &quot; Landlord ' s Law Book , &quot; contain sample forms for the tenant ' s move-in condition checklist , owner ' s notice of intent to enter an occupied unit and warning notices . Refer to the following sources : -- &quot; The Landlord ' s Troubleshooter , &quot; Robert Irwin , Dearborn Financial Publishing , Chicago , 1994 . -- &quot; California Rental Housing Reference_Book , &quot; Fifth Edition , California Apartment Assn. ; 1414 K St. , Suite 610 , Sacramento , Calif . -- &quot; Managing Rental Properties for Maximum Profit , &quot; Greg Perry , Prima Publishing , Rocklin , Calif. , 1993 . -- &quot; The Landlord ' s Law Book , Vol . 1 : Rights &amp; Responsibilities , &quot; David Brown and Ralph Warner , Nolo Press , Berkeley , Calif , 1991 .
