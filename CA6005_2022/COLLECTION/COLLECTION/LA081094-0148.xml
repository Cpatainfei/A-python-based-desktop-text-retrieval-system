   <HEADLINE> PROP . 187 TURNS_UP HEAT IN U.S. IMMIGRATION DEBATE ; ELECTION : BACKERS SEEK REVOLUTION IN NATIONAL POLICY . FOES PREDICT ILL-EDUCATED , DISEASE-PRONE UNDERCLASS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three months before Election_Day , the ballot measure known as Proposition 187 already seems destined to join the pantheon of California initiatives that periodically reshape national debate . Its backers have immodestly dubbed the proposal Save Our State , SOS for short , and its subject is illegal immigration . &quot; You are the posse , &quot; an initiative co-founder recently told a receptive gathering in Orange County , &quot; and SOS is the rope. &quot; A_few days later , the proposition ' s looming presence cast a pall over the 20th anniversary ceremonies of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project , the Mexican American electoral rights organization . &quot; Remember , &quot; a speaker urgently warned a disheartened crowd in a Pasadena ballroom , &quot; there ' s only 90 days left to save California ' s Latinos ! &quot; After years of increasingly rancorous debate about immigration , Californians on Nov . 8 will get_to vote directly on the issue , with likely repercussions for the governor ' s race and national immigration policies . Both sides_view the ballot as a kind of plebiscite on California ' s future , although the issue at_hand focuses_on the narrower question of public benefits for illegal immigrants . Nationally , the vote may influence immigration discourse much as Proposition 13 forged a new consensus on taxes and other California initiatives have crystallized matters as varied as environmental policy and auto insurance . Initiative backers acknowledge that what they really want is a revolution in national immigration policy , the exclusive domain of Congress and the executive_branch . With limited influence over Washington , however , proponents have turned_to the liberal California initiative process in an effort to involve state and local_government in immigration matters_to an unprecedented degree . California -- destination of perhaps 40 % of all new immigrants to the United States -- is unquestionably the battleground . Large-scale immigration , particularly from Latin_America and Asia , has dramatically altered the state ' s demography in the last two decades , dismaying many longtime state residents , particularly non-Latino white suburbanites , whose discontent has fueled Proposition 187 . But even as polls show the measure gathering widespread support among voters , its very premise -- that public_services and schools draw illegal immigrants -- remains a matter of fierce debate . The initiative doesn ' t directly address jobs , widely considered by scholars and other authorities to be the principal lure for immigrants . Nor does Proposition 187 do anything about the porous U.S.-Mexico border . Proponents acknowledge that jobs are a magnet , and they would like beefed-up border enforcement . But drafters say Proposition 187 is the most that they could wring_out of California law . They want to deliver a message to Capitol_Hill and the White_House to spur more changes . On a practical level , even if Proposition 187 passes in November , it could be years before its major provisions are enacted , if ever , because of conflict with state and federal laws , constitutional protections and court rulings . Implementation could largely depend_on protracted legal battles . Proposition 187 ' s best-known provisions would bar illegal immigrants from public schooling , non-emergency health_care and social_services . To accomplish those bans , the proposition would create a new realm of official inquiry by police , school administrators , social_workers and health providers . Officials would be required to quiz people about their citizenship or immigration status and then to report those &quot; reasonably suspected &quot; of being illegal immigrants to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and &quot; any other government_agency &quot; that requests it . In perhaps the most drastic move , school officials would be obligated to verify the status not only of students but of parents and guardians -- even if their children are U.S. citizens . By 1996 , parents of all public_school students statewide would be forced to prove citizenship or legal residence status . These laws would test legal and ethical standards of confidentiality , particularly for doctors , nurses , social_workers and others whose professions are steeped in privacy . Explicit in the measure ' s wording is that interrogators must rely_on suspicion . With dozens of official immigration categories , only qualified U.S. authorities can determine status with certainty . The broad new reporting mechanisms , proponents believe , will prompt large-scale &quot; self-deportations &quot; and discourage others from sojourning here without papers . But there is no guarantee anyone will leave the country . State authorities have no standing to deport people . Nor can the state force the notoriously understaffed and inefficient INS to act . Gov . Pete Wilson is expected to back the initiative , which is already endorsed by the California Republican_Party and several GOP legislators . Co-authoring the measure are former INS Commissioner Alan C . Nelson and Harold W . Ezell , former top-ranking Western administrator of the INS . &quot; This is not an anti-immigrant initiative , it ' s an anti-illegal immigrant initiative , &quot; said Nelson , who headed the INS during the Bush_Administration . &quot; The people of California have simply had enough. &quot; Among the initiative ' s grass-roots supporters , there is a barely concealed layer of antagonism toward illegal immigrants . The initiative , they say , is one of many steps necessary to drive them from the state . &quot; Illegal aliens are killing us in California , &quot; said Ronald Prince , a Tustin accountant who heads the Proposition 187 campaign . &quot; Those who support illegal immigration are , in_effect , anti-American. &quot; Critics see proponents ' efforts as Big Brotherism run amok , an invitation to official harassment of the &quot; foreign-looking. &quot; They envision an ill-educated underclass of youngsters roaming the streets , prone to contagious_diseases and drawn to crime , posing constant hazards for citizens and other legal residents . Lost in the fiery oratory , immigrant advocates say , are the many ways that illegal immigrants ' low-wage labor and tax contributions have benefited Californians and propped_up the regional economy . Joining Latino and immigrant activists opposing the measure is a broad coalition of health_professionals , school officials , religious_leaders , unions and law_enforcement authorities . Los Angeles Cardinal Roger M . Mahony , the state ' s top-ranking Roman_Catholic cleric , calls Proposition 187 &quot; a devastating assault on human dignity , &quot; and has vowed to use the churches ' resources and the power of the pulpit to battle it . Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown also has pledged to campaign against the initiative . Most Democratic candidates will also probably oppose it . Although Latinos generally oppose illegal immigration at about the same rate as other voters , polls have shown that they dislike Proposition 187 much more_than the general electorate . This reflects a widely held view among Latinos that an anti-Latino sentiment underlies the initiative , and that Latinos would bear the brunt of any new investigative and reporting requirements . The initiative ' s potential fiscal effects are another matter of great dispute , reflecting disagreements about how much illegal immigrants use public_services . An analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst ' s Office concluded that the proposals would probably save about $ 200 million annually in state and local funds , not including education spending . Excluding more_than 300 # 000 illegal immigrant youngsters from public_schools could save another $ 1.2 billion , but this ban would probably be stayed pending a lengthy court battle . However , the state analysts also found that the proposal would cost tens of millions of dollars annually to implement , and potentially more_than $ 100 million during the first year . Much of the price_tag involves training_school personnel and others in the often-arcane intricacies of immigration law . Moreover , the analysis found that the proposal could put at risk billions -- perhaps as much as $ 15 billion -- in federal funds now provided to California for health , education and welfare programs . This is because of conflicts between the measure ' s provisions and federal privacy , non-discrimination and procedural requirements . U.S. Education_Secretary Richard W . Riley has already indicated in writing that the proposal would endanger federal education money . The following is a breakdown of Proposition 187 ' s major components : EDUCATION The proposition ' s most incendiary ( and perhaps most legally problematic ) provision would bar illegal immigrants from public elementary and secondary_schools . Students believed to be in the country illegally would be given 90 calendar_days to produce legal documentation or &quot; accomplish an orderly transition to a school in the child ' s country of origin. &quot; Verification for new pupils would begin Jan . 1 . One year later , students already enrolled -- along with parents and guardians -- would have to prove their status . New procedures would be required to verify the status of the more_than 5 million public_school students in the state and at least as_many parents -- some of whose whereabouts would undoubtedly be unknown or difficult to track . If Proposition 187 is approved , the schools provisions will doubtless trigger a court challenge under federal or state law -- and possibly both . Drafters have said they would like to see the U.S. Supreme Court revisit its Plyler vs . Doe decision , the landmark 1982 ruling stating that illegal immigrant children are entitled to a public_school education . The California Supreme Court , citing the state Constitution , ruled_in 1992 that public schooling is a fundamental right -- an even broader_interpretation than that of the federal justices . Even if the measure passes , youngsters who are undocumented would still be eligible for federally funded school meal and Head_Start programs . HEALTH_CARE Proposition 187 would bar publicly funded clinics and hospitals from providing care to illegal immigrants , except in emergencies . Federal law requires that no one be refused emergency treatment , generally interpreted to include delivery of babies . But the measure would deny prenatal and postnatal care to women lacking papers -- a proscription that physicians say would elevate public health expenses for their U.S.-born children , who would be citizens . A range of public health benefits is now accessible to illegal immigrants , young and old . Many programs have been kept_open to everyone for a deliberate reason : to head_off infectious_diseases that inevitably cost less to prevent or treat at early stages than afterward , when the illnesses become acute and may spread to others , regardless of immigration status . Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant workers handle food in restaurants and fields . Children who are undocumented could presumably no longer receive immunizations at hospitals and clinics that receive public money -- the vast majority of such facilities . Some fear the resulting spread of diseases such_as measles , mumps , polio , rubella and diphtheria . Also obliged to curtail services would be county-run hospitals and public clinics that provide basic medical services to poor , uninsured residents . Disorders that are treated range from minor wounds to care of serious infectious ailments such_as tuberculosis , a grave problem among many immigrant populations . California leads the nation in reported cases of TB . Some experts predict a rise of sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV infection , syphilis and gonorrhea if the measure passes . In addition , this provision would probably terminate publicly funded long-term nursing_home care_for undocumented elderly and disabled people , along with kidney dialysis treatment . SOCIAL_SERVICES Illegal immigrants are already ineligible for most major social_service payouts , such_as food_stamps , unemployment insurance and federal child welfare payments . But the proposal also would exclude illegal immigrants from publicly funded family_planning initiatives and a smattering of specialized government efforts targeting at-risk populations , including abused and parentless youth , the elderly , blind , mentally impaired , homeless , and drug and alcohol abusers . Nonprofit social_service groups that use state grants to assist illegal immigrants would probably have to stop . LAW_ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION This section requires that law_enforcement agencies &quot; fully cooperate &quot; with the INS , and it expressly prohibits legislative , administrative or other actions banning such collaboration . The result would be the likely nullification of all municipal sanctuary ordinances protecting refugees and the end of limited-cooperation agreements with the INS that some law_enforcement agencies ( including the Los Angeles Police_Department ) have imposed . The provision would require that police , deputies , Highway Patrol officers and all other California law_enforcement officers notify the INS and state_attorney general ' s office of any arrestees &quot; suspected &quot; of being illegal immigrants . Those identified would have to be advised that &quot; apart from any criminal justice proceedings , he or she must either obtain legal_status or leave the United States. &quot; Critics -- including Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block , whose name appears on the anti-Proposition 187 ballot statement -- say the provision turns police_officers into INS agents , heightening community distrust . Fearing deportation , detractors say , crime victims and witnesses may hesitate to contact police . FALSE DOCUMENTS Proposition 187 would amend state law to include stiffer penalties for anyone who uses , manufactures or sells false documents designed to &quot; conceal &quot; citizenship or immigration status . Much of the proposal largely duplicates U.S. and state statutes , which already criminalize the surging false documentation trade . Ironically , authorities say Proposition 187 , with its greatly widened mandate for identification , would probably boost the black_market in documents to new heights . Proposition 187 : What It Does Proposition 187 , which will appear on the Nov . 8 ballot , seeks to discourage illegal immigration by denying publicly funded benefits . Critics say immigrants come_to the United States for jobs , not benefits . Here are the major provisions : EDUCATION * Current law : Court rulings have held that undocumented children are entitled to elementary and secondary public_school education . Illegal immigrants may also attend state colleges and universities , but most are charged non-resident tuition rates . * Proposition 187 : Bars enrollment in all public_schools , colleges and universities . Parents or guardians of all schoolchildren , including U.S. citizens , would likewise have to demonstrate legal residence . The law would oblige school administrators to report students and parents suspected of being illegal immigrants . HEALTH SERVICES * Current law : Illegal immigrants may receive a wide variety of care at publicly funded hospitals and clinics . Federal law bars health_facilities from denying emergency aid to anyone . * Proposition 187 : Denies non-emergency public care to those who cannot prove legal_status , including prenatal and postnatal services . SOCIAL_SERVICES * Current law : Federal and state laws bar illegal immigrants from most major benefits , such_as welfare and unemployment insurance . * Proposition 187 : Cuts_off a host of other state and locally funded programs that are directed toward troubled youths , the elderly , the blind and others with special needs . LAW_ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION * Current law : Many local police agencies avoid getting involved in immigration matters because they believe it would discourage victims and witnesses from reporting crimes . * Proposition 187 : State , city and county law_enforcement authorities would be obligated to question arrestees about their citizenship or immigration status and report suspected illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Naturalization Service and state_attorney general . FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS * Current law : The use of fraudulent documents to prove residency is illegal . * Proposition 187 : Creates new state felonies and stiffens penalties .</TEXT>
