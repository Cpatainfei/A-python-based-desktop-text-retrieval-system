   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS : SPOTLIGHT ON HONG KONG ; A FADING CROWN_JEWEL ? ; UNCERTAINTIES ABOUND AS POWER TRANSFER NEARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In about 1 # 000 days , the_British rulers of Hong Kong will hand_over control of the crown colony to China . While that makes many of Hong Kong ' s freewheeling capitalists uneasy , those concerns are_well hidden by the sights and sounds of a fast-growing economy . At Hong Kong ' s Kwai Chung container port , for example , cargo_ships jam up against the docks piled high with Chinese-made products bound for export . In the main business_district , growing legions of foreign business people brave traffic-choked streets , briefcases and cellular_phones in_hand . On a nearby island , construction workers have begun laying the groundwork for a $ 21-billion airport and related facilities . &quot; Business is booming , &quot; said Meocre Li , managing partner for Arthur Andersen ' s Hong Kong and China operations . In fact , one of Li ' s biggest problems in the territory ' s tight labor_market is expanding Andersen ' s 500-employee Hong Kong office while competitors try to lure away his workers . But Hong Kong ' s powerhouse economy faces numerous problems , including lingering disputes between British and Chinese officials , high inflation and a slumping stock_market . In addition , the colony ' s traditional and lucrative role as a middleman between China and the West is being challenged by Shanghai and other rapidly developing Chinese cities . &quot; Hong Kong is still a very important stepping_stone for American ( and other foreign ) companies to China , &quot; said Wei Li , who follows the Chinese economy as an assistant_professor at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University . But &quot; as China becomes more sophisticated , the importance of Hong Kong as a stepping stone will decline. &quot; Still , Hong Kong ' s economy is expected to grow about 6 % this year and next . The economic well-being of Hong Kong and its approximately 6 million residents depends primarily on the economy and policies of neighboring China . Under an agreement between Britain and China , the Chinese have vowed to keep their hands off Hong Kong ' s free-market economy , policies and currency until 50 years after the power transfer in July , 1997 . * But the Hong Kong and Chinese economies are already intertwined . Since China began to open its doors to foreign investment in the late 1970s , Hong Kong companies have poured an estimated $ 74 billion into the country through 1992 , according to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council . Lured by factory wages that are about half as much as those in the colony , Hong Kong textile_mills , electronic manufacturers , toy makers and other firms have moved_into China . As a result , about 80 % of the estimated $ 134 billion in Hong Kong ' s 1992 exports originated primarily in China , and about half the companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock_Exchange have significant Chinese operations or sales . &quot; When the Chinese economy will slow_down , the Hong Kong economy will also slow_down , &quot; said Richard Drobnick , director of the International Business Education &amp; Research Program at USC . Many foreign companies have established headquarters in Hong Kong to take_advantage of its experience and guanxi -- &quot; connections &quot; -- that play a crucial role in China ' s business dealings . Guanxi , said Wei Li , &quot; can get you a factory built , a long-term contract with a supplier . . . cheap loans from Chinese banks. &quot; Hong Kong ' s growing investment in China has altered the colony ' s economic landscape : Blue-collar industries have declined while finance and services have grown . &quot; It has become the services and management center of southern China , &quot; said Richard Farrell , director of Guinness Flight , a London-based investment_firm . * In fact , China ranks as Hong Kong ' s biggest source of foreign investment . By 1992 , Chinese investment in Hong Kong totaled $ 12 billion to $ 13 billion and was growing fast , according to economic statistics . But Chinese and other foreign investors are fearful about a possible collapse of the territory ' s overheated real_estate market . Those fears have spread to the Hong Kong stock_market , which has declined 20 % since January as real_estate stocks nose-dived . &quot; We see that property-related stocks are still substantially overvalued and may go_down , &quot; said Daniel J . Duane , senior portfolio manger at Prudential Mutual_Funds . &quot; If they go_down , they will drag the whole market down with them. &quot; Disputes between British and Chinese officials have also hampered projects considered vital to Hong Kong ' s role as a center for global trade . The opening of a new shipping terminal for container_ships , for example , has reportedly been delayed by at least 1 1 / 2 years because of China ' s reluctance to approve the project . The construction of the new airport has also been threatened with delays as the_British and Chinese argue over financing . Hong Kong needs to expand both facilities if it &quot; is going_to continue to be a financial and service center , &quot; said Meocre Li of Arthur Andersen . * In addition , Hong Kong needs to improve its expertise in high_technology , which lags far behind those in many neighboring countries , such_as Japan , Taiwan and South_Korea , economic observers say . China has a large appetite for high_technology , but it must go elsewhere for such expertise . &quot; that ' s the sad part , &quot; Li said of Hong Kong ' s limited number of colleges and research_centers . &quot; They have to upgrade . . . in_order to compete in the world market. &quot; The opening of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 2 1 / 2 years ago is a badly needed investment , he said . Hong Kong ' s stature as a gateway to China is also being challenged by the rise of Shanghai , Canton and other Chinese industrial centers . Increasingly , Western companies are dealing with Shanghai-based firms and bypassing Hong Kong middlemen . Ironically , many Shanghai entrepreneurs fled to Hong Kong in 1949 in the wake of communist rule and helped build the colony ' s postwar industries . &quot; People are willing to pay a premium at the moment . . . for being in Hong Kong , &quot; Duane said . But what happens , he said , &quot; if everyone wakes_up one day and realizes that there is an alternative to Hong Kong ? that ' s the big mystery for the market. &quot; A Bad Year The Hong Kong stock_market , one of the world ' s most active , has declined this year , mostly because many listed companies are heavily involved in Hong Kong ' s inflated property market . Weekly closes for the Hang Seng index , except latest : Wednesday : 9 # 532.35 , up 170.03</TEXT>
