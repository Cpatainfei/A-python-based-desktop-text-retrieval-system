   <HEADLINE> THE LAST GENTLEMAN ; THE HOUSE OF PERCY : HONOR , IMAGINATION , AND MELANCHOLY IN A SOUTHERN FAMILY , BY BERTRAM WYATT-BROWN ( OXFORD_UNIVERSITY PRESS : $ 30 ; 454 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an essay called &quot; Stoicism in the South &quot; the novelist Walker Percy observed : &quot; The greatness of the South . . . had always a stronger Greek flavor than it ever had a Christian. &quot; So it is no surprise that in &quot; The Moviegoer , &quot; Percy ' s award-winning 1961 novel , the patrician aunt sends her somewhat unmoored nephew a stern memo quoting the Stoic philosopher and emperor Marcus Aurelius , not St . Paul or New Orleans ' Archbishop Rummel . Indeed , one generation after another of the eminent Percy family turned_to Marcus Aurelius for solace and support . Stoicism helps explain not only the South ' s historic emphasis on manners -- suitable behavior and appearance were hallmarks of this pagan philosophy -- but also on a code of honor . As Bertram Wyatt-Brown , Richard J . Milbauer Professor of History at the University of Florida , points_out in his meticulously researched study of Walker Percy ' s family , the story of honor is here entwined with melancholy -- or in more clinical terms , chronic depression . How various members of this gifted family -- several were poets and novelists -- tried to cope_with the demands of honor and the trials of melancholy through the use and misuse of imagination is treated with singular tact and wisdom in Prof . Wyatt-Brown ' s absolutely riveting history . Although the book ranges as far back as the early 16th Century with an account of an earl ' s suicide in the Tower_of_London and does full justice to antebellum days both in the South and Philadelphia , it is in the chapters on William Alexander Percy ( 1885-1942 ) that the abundant historical detail lavished on the reader comes_into sharp focus . After Walker Percy ' s father committed suicide , &quot; Uncle Will &quot; Percy -- actually , he was the novelist ' s first_cousin once removed -- acted_as surrogate father for Walker and his two brothers . Long before bringing the boys into his roomy bachelor ' s home_in Greenville , Miss. , Will Percy had replaced the pious fervor of his childhood Catholicism with a resigned Stoicism . As Wyatt-Brown speculates , &quot; Will ' s loss of faith in Christianity , and particularly in Catholicism , had much to do with his shame at his own sexual feelings . . . . &quot; Practicing law only out of a grim sense of family duty , Will Percy found his true calling in writing poetry . These poems , Wyatt-Brown comments , might have been a way for Will to cope_with the conflicting emotions aroused by his greatly inhibited homosexuality . Though this somewhat reductionist view of the creative impulse might give some readers pause , Wyatt-Brown also notes how the poet ' s complex stance toward his father echoed a paternal theme in the poetry of Will ' s great-aunt , Eleanor Percy Lee . Indeed , throughout the book Wyatt-Brown points_out similarities in the creative works of Percy family members from disparate generations . &quot; The complicated account of these themes , &quot; Wyatt-Brown writes , &quot; may help to explain how families , consciously and sometimes unconsciously , recapitulate old issues in new settings . . . . &quot; One issue that confronted every generation of Percys was race . Will Percy ' s father , Sen . LeRoy Percy , fought a courageous battle against the Ku Klux Klan that earned him nationwide attention . Although ideals of human dignity and a hatred of cruelty undoubtedly inspired him , Will ' s father based his appeal_to fellow white landowners in Mississippi on simple economics . Already many blacks had left the Delta in search of better wages in Northern industries . &quot; With only three parades , &quot; LeRoy Percy warned , &quot; no matter how peaceful , the Klan could sweep all_the remaining blacks_out of the region . . . . &quot; There would be no laborers to harvest the crops . In the Percys ' bitter struggle with the Klan , Wyatt-Brown doesn ' t ignore the class resentment that surfaced . LeRoy Percy railed that they were &quot; a cowardly , skulky bunch and no thoroughbred ought to have anything but a feeling of contempt for them. &quot; A true patrician who defied the teetotaling self-righteousness of the Klan by openly drinking bootlegged liquor and gambling , LeRoy Percy passed_on to his son a paternalistic attitude not only toward African-Americans but also toward lower- and middle-class whites . As a result , when Will Percy wrote his memoir , &quot; Lanterns on the Levee , &quot; still in print today after its 1941 publication , little if any mention is made of ordinary citizens . &quot; ( B ) lack or white , &quot; Wyatt-Brown notes , &quot; the people outside the family_circle -- unless enemies like Bilbo or dependents like Lige -- were simply invisible. &quot; Yet rather than pass a simple judgment on Will Percy for his blatant prejudices , Wyatt-Brown patiently uncovers the deeper humanity of this anguished , lonely intellectual . Hodding Carter , whose editorials against racism in the Greenville paper won him the 1946 Pulitzer Prize , had this to say about the man who was largely responsible_for hiring him away from a small Louisiana paper : &quot; ( Will Percy ) sent penniless youngsters to college , helped jobless men find work , set_up ambitious people in small businesses. &quot; Some African Americans even referred to him as the &quot; little Jesus. &quot; Will Percy ' s kindness , unusual in a plantation_owner of that time , calls to mind the story of his great-grandfather , Thomas George Percy . By cross-referencing generations in_regard_to such character traits , Wyatt-Brown ' s portraits resonate at time with an almost uncanny perspective . By all accounts Thomas George Percy should have been plagued with the same ambition and depression that afflicted so many other family members . Indeed , his own father had committed suicide and his sister was hospitalized for melancholia . Yet in those antebellum days Thomas George managed to cultivate a quiet happiness , mainly by nurturing devoted friendships . The deep platonic bond between Thomas George and a Princeton classmate who contracted tuberculosis would be echoed in later years by other Percy friendships based on shared intellectual interests . Perhaps the most fascinating connection of this sort was not between two Percy men , but that between a female descendant , Sarah Ellis Dorsey ( 1829-1879 ) , and the ex-president of the Confederacy , Jefferson Davis . A novelist and biographer , Sarah Dorsey found strength in the meditations of Marcus Aurelius during the trials of the Civil War . Although she was &quot; by far the most personally involved in the improvement of black life of all_the Percy connections . . . until . . . Will Percy ' s day , &quot; the terrible fact remains that she , like other antebellum Percys , was a slaveholder . Toward the end of her life Sarah Dorsey invited the married Jefferson Davis to live_in a cottage on the grounds of her Mississippi home so that she could help encourage him to finish writing his memoirs . Wyatt-Brown ' s thoroughly engrossing account of how this proto-feminist and yet still proper Southern lady wound_up giving all_of her money away to the ex-President -- who was never her lover , despite endless gossip -- is a fitting conclusion to the chapters on the remarkably accomplished females in the Percy line . This wealth of family background helps shed a new light on Walker Percy as the book draws to a close with an overview of the novelist ' s life and work . Tentatively , Wyatt-Brown probes a link between Percy ' s last novel , &quot; The Thanatos Syndrome , &quot; and Sarah Dorsey ' s 1864 novel , &quot; Agnes Graham. &quot; Even more striking plot elements are shared_in Percy ' s &quot; Lancelot &quot; and an 1860 best-selling novel by a Percy cousin , Catherine Warfield . Considered Percy ' s masterpiece by Wyatt-Brown , &quot; Lancelot &quot; explores the tension between the family ' s age-old Stoic ideals of honor and the selfless demands of Percy ' s Christian faith . In his 1956 essay on stoicism Walker Percy wrote , &quot; Its most characteristic mood was a poetic pessimism which took a grim satisfaction in the dissolution of its values -- because social decay confirmed one in his original choice of the wintry kingdom of self. &quot; For this last gentleman , though , self was no longer sufficient . A different choice was made .</TEXT>
