   <HEADLINE> WILSON CRIME SUMMIT TO HAVE HARD-LINE FOCUS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With his advisers convinced that voter fear of crime will drive the election , Gov . Pete Wilson opens a two-day crime summit in Hollywood today that will be dominated by law-and-order advocates and crime victims , and light on voices for rehabilitation . The summit , postponed last month because of the Northridge earthquake , will be held at the First Presbyterian Community_Center , a 700-person hall usually reserved for Bible studies and receptions . The invitation-only event will begin with an early morning memorial for crime victims and will be weighted throughout with proponents of the &quot; three strikes &quot; movement that seeks to imprison habitual_criminals for life . Panels will include Marc Klaas , father of Polly Klaas , the Petaluma 12-year-old whose abduction and murder fueled the latest wave of public outrage over crime , and Mike Reynolds , whose daughter was murdered in 1992 and who is the sponsor of the &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; initiative proposed for the November ballot . Harriet Salarno , founder of Justice for Murdered Victims , will be among the parents of slain children who will speak at the opening ceremony . Salarno has been_active in anti-crime efforts since her daughter , Catina Rose , was murdered in 1979 . Public concern about crime is running high and Salarno hopes that in this election year the summit will add_to pressure on lawmakers to approve more anti-crime legislation . &quot; Everything is starting to peak , &quot; Salarno said . &quot; People have been crying_out . They want public safety . They don ' t want to have to look over their shoulder . The timing is perfect . We ' ve got_to take_advantage of the timing. &quot; The cast of political_leaders scheduled to attend includes Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren , Sen . David A . Roberti ( D-Van Nuys ) , Assembly Speaker Willie Brown ( D-San Francisco ) , and many other state legislators . Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and Los Angeles Police_Chief Willie L . Williams will be there . In all , 5 # 000 invitations were sent . Organizers expect 1 # 200 people to attend . Wilson aides say the two-day talkfest is aimed at developing consensus on anti-crime legislation and focusing pressure on the Legislature to pass bills that in past years have been blocked by the Democratic majority . &quot; Every Californian has a fundamental right not to become a crime victim , not to live_in fear , &quot; Wilson said , explaining his reason for convening the summit . Among those not invited are Wilson ' s Democratic challengers , Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi . The governor ' s rivals say the summit will be little more_than a campaign event . &quot; When Republicans screw_up the economy , they turn_to crime . It ' s a time-honored strategy , &quot; said Darry Sragow , Garamendi ' s campaign manager . &quot; The economy is in terrible shape and ( Wilson ) doesn ' t want people focused_on that. &quot; U.S. Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , a Democrat , also was not invited . An aide to Wilson said Reno , the nation ' s top law_enforcement official , was not asked to attend because the governor wanted to limit the event to state officials -- although one of the scheduled speakers is an assistant U.S. attorney . The event will be light on liberal voices . But the governor ' s office did make a late addition by inviting Ramona Ripston , executive_director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California . Ripston will appear on a panel with Reynolds , Rob Bonner , head of the Drug Enforcement Administration under President George_Bush ; Superior_Court Judge Lois Haight , a Justice_Department official in the Ronald Reagan_Administration , and Kern County Dist . Atty . Ed Jagels , long active in law-and-order efforts . &quot; There is a small part of me that thinks by appearing I am playing into their hand , &quot; Ripston said . &quot; But I am willing to take_a_chance . . . . It ' s important that somebody says : ' Wait , this ( &quot; three strikes &quot; movement ) isn ' t going_to do what everybody says . It won ' t make people safer. ' I ' m hoping that I ' ll be the voice of reason. &quot; The summit is being held at a time when the Legislature is rushing to pass anti-crime bills , and when major crime has fallen , down 3.8 % in 1993 in California . Even though crime overall fell last year , homicide climbed 2.6 % . &quot; There ' s a real intensity , &quot; George Gorton , Wilson ' s campaign manager , said of the public ' s perception of crime . &quot; I think it ' s ( because of ) the random nature of the violence and the unpredictability of the violence. &quot; In choosing the location for the summit , Wilson took a cue from Brown , who held a highly publicized economic summit last year at the Biltmore Hotel . The summit is being held_in Los Angeles to ensure television coverage in the state ' s biggest media market . Los Angeles television_stations have no Sacramento-based reporters . Sean Walsh , who is helping to organize the event for the governor , explained that Hollywood was selected as the summit site for symbolic reasons . It is , he noted , a district &quot; struggling with a crime problem. &quot; The Presbyterian community_center was chosen to show that &quot; communities need to be involved &quot; in the fight against crime , he added . The governor ' s staff fretted about holding the summit so soon after the Northridge earthquake . But if Wilson had postponed it further , he would have run_into a conflict with Brown ' s summit on education next week in San Francisco , and other scheduling problems in March . &quot; People are very concerned about crime any way you look_at it , &quot; Gorton said . Although the quake and its aftermath is a concern , voters &quot; certainly have enough room to focus_on both. &quot; Walsh said that before the event was rescheduled , he checked with Los Angeles police to make certain the summit will not interfere with more pressing disaster-related duties . The quake has caused some logistic problems . Federal disaster workers have taken_up many hotel_rooms in Hollywood , and some people scheduled to speak when the conference was set for January could not make_it in February . Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti is among those who was supposed to speak in January , but cannot attend today . Garcetti , an opponent of the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative , will be at a crime conference in Washington , D.C. , his spokeswoman said . At the governor ' s invitation , Los Angeles Deputy Dist . Atty . Sterling Norris , who ran against Garcetti in 1992 and endorses the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative , will be among the panelists . Long active in crime victims organizations , Norris said he hopes that the summit will add_to public outrage over crime , thereby putting more pressure on officials to pass and carry_out tough anti-crime laws . &quot; Unless we enlist the public in the outrage against crime , we are not going_to get anything done , &quot; Norris said . The summit will include sessions on crime ' s impact on business , school violence , crimes against women and children , and juvenile crime . There is no scheduled discussion of the impact of increased incarceration on the state budget . The politically touchy issue of gun_control will be addressed in the last panel , at 4 p.m. Tuesday . Former San Jose Police_Chief Joseph McNamara , an outspoken advocate of gun_control , will be among the speakers on that panel . He is calling_for higher taxes on guns , proficiency tests for anyone buying a gun , and state legislation allowing cities to pass their own gun ordinances . As it is , the state controls gun law -- and legislators rarely pass measures limiting access to firearms .</TEXT>
