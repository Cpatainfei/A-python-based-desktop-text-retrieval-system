   <HEADLINE> LOCAL LEVELS OF SMOG SHOW DECLINE FOR YEAR SO FAR ; POLLUTION : THERE HAVE BEEN ONLY 10 FIRST-STAGE ALERTS . EXPERTS CREDIT THE RECENT WEATHER FOR THE BETTER-THAN-PREDICTED AIR QUALITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First it was too cool and damp for much smog , then too hot . Both of those atypical weather patterns have thus far helped make 1994 even more smog-free than 1993 , which had the fewest first-degree smog alerts ever recorded in the San Gabriel Valley . There have been 10 first-stage smog alerts in the San Gabriel Valley so far this year , compared with 13 at this point last year , according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District . Meteorologists begin tracking yearly smog levels every January , but the real smog season is May through October . This May , unseasonable cloudiness blocked the sun ' s rays , which normally intensify smog by trapping it , lid-like , with its heat , said Bill Kelly , AQMD spokesman . And rain cleared some of the pollutants from the air . On the flip side , the last two weeks in June were unusually hot , exceeding 100 degrees in several San Gabriel Valley cities . Although meteorologists warned residents of approaching first-stage smog alerts , the temperature grew so hot in the valley that the ground air rose , punching through the inversion layer and releasing much of the smog , Kelly said . Of the daily smog alerts expected June 22 to 29 , only one , on June 24 , materialized , said Joe Cassmassi , senior meteorologist with the AQMD . &quot; We weren ' t expecting that kind of heat so early in the season , &quot; he said . A first-stage smog alert is issued when the ozone exceeds 0.20 parts per million in any of the three local cities measured--Glendora , Pomona or Pasadena . On those days , everyone is advised to refrain_from vigorous activity outside , and people with heart or lung problems are urged to spend as much time indoors as possible . Meteorologists generally have expected this year ' s smog levels to be higher than last because the El Nino weather_conditions that kept smog to a minimum in 1993 have vanished . There were 19 first-stage alerts in 1993 . But the weather in the past two months has been so out of character for the region that meteorologists no longer know what to expect for smog levels this year , Kelly said . The number of unhealthful days , when the ozone exceeds 0.12 parts per million , has zig-zagged over the past few years , higher in 1990 and 1992 , lower in 1991 and ' 93 . Regardless of whether this year is slightly more or less smoggy than last , AQMD meteorologists say air_pollution is declining on the whole because of tougher state laws on industries that emit pollutants , said Claudia Keats , an AQMD spokeswoman . In order to tally alerts and unhealthful days for the valley , the AQMD uses the numbers from whatever station has the worst record--typically Glendora . The valley has not had a second-degree smog alert , issued when the ozone exceeds 0.35 parts per million , since 1986 , Kelly said .
