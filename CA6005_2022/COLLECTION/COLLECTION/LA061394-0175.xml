   <TEXT> For years , China relied_on its importance in the Cold_War as its main bargaining tool with the United States . Now it uses its economic might . But for more_than two decades it has had another hidden , powerful weapon in dealing with the U.S. : its sophistication in courting those Americans who count the most . A long-secret , two-volume history of U.S.-China negotiations , released by the CIA to The Times , details how Beijing repeatedly &quot; manipulated &quot; top U.S. officials , from the Nixon through Reagan years . The report , written by the RAND Corp . for U.S. intelligence agencies , is laced with examples of how the Chinese handled the United States ' foreign_policy elite , including Henry A . Kissinger , Zbigniew Brzezinski and George_Bush . Starting with Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai in 1971 , the Chinese used a variety of tactics -- from serving opulent banquets to playing U.S. presidential politics -- to advance their interests on issues such_as Taiwan and Indochina . &quot; The most distinctive characteristic of Chinese negotiating behavior is an effort to develop and manipulate strong interpersonal relationships with foreign officials , &quot; the report concluded . The study contains the first transcripts of top-level conversations between U.S. and Chinese leaders ever made public . Among them are the historic visit of July , 1971 -- when Kissinger , President Richard Nixon ' s national security adviser , became the first U.S. official in more_than two decades to visit the world ' s most populous country -- and Nixon ' s own trip to China in 1972 . Until now , scholars say , virtually all public_knowledge of these events has come from the sometimes self-serving accounts of Nixon , Kissinger and other U.S. officials . The 1985 study , which The Times obtained under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit after five years of requests , paints a less heroic and less flattering portrait of the Americans than the accounts based on their memoirs . In essence , the study shows how skillfully China conducted its diplomacy with the United States -- a lesson demonstrated once again last month by Beijing ' s success in persuading the Clinton_Administration to back_away from its attempts to impose human_rights conditions on trade privileges . From the earliest days of the Nixon-Kissinger initiatives , the study says , the Chinese tried to exploit individual insecurities , play off Presidents against their domestic rivals and orchestrate meetings to maximize Americans ' sense of &quot; gratitude , awe and helplessness. &quot; On the landmark 1972 Nixon visit , for example , Kissinger negotiated the &quot; Shanghai communique &quot; -- in which the United States acknowledged that Taiwan was part of China -- &quot; late at night after a banquet of Peking duck and powerful mao tai liquor , &quot; the study says . In the afterglow of the sumptuous spread , Kissinger is quoted as telling his hosts , &quot; After a dinner of Peking duck , I ' ll sign anything. &quot; Chinese officials tried , usually successfully , to carry_out negotiations on_their_own turf and by their own rules . U.S. officials invariably had the disadvantage of having to lay out their own positions first . &quot; We have two sayings , &quot; Vice Foreign Minister Qiao Guanhua told Kissinger in New York in October , 1976 . &quot; One is that when we are the host , we should let the guests begin . And the other is that when we are guests , we should defer to the host. &quot; Kissinger joked about the imbalance but volunteered , &quot; I will be glad to start. &quot; Likewise , the report says that the Chinese were masters at keeping their visitors on edge and off balance . On a trip to Beijing in May , 1978 , Brzezinski , President Jimmy_Carter ' s national security adviser , engaged in what RAND describes as &quot; almost comical &quot; exchanges with Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders as he repeatedly tried over two days to inform them that Carter wanted to normalize relations with China . The Chinese acted_as though they did not hear Brzezinski or believe him . &quot; We are looking_forward to the day when Carter makes_up his mind , &quot; Deng said . &quot; Let us now shift the subject. &quot; Brzezinski finally burst_out in frustration , &quot; I have told you before , President Carter has made_up his mind. &quot; The RAND report said the incident shows &quot; how the Chinese can hold_off ( a visiting official ) in_order to entice him to accommodate to their position. &quot; In his memoirs , Brzezinski recounted this conversation but minimized its importance , concluding that Deng had shown flexibility on Taiwan issues . RAND completed the study in 1985 . The author , Richard H . Solomon , a RAND specialist on China , had been an aide to Kissinger on the National Security_Council and later served as a senior State_Department official in the Ronald Reagan and Bush_administrations . In commissioning the study , the U.S. intelligence agencies sought insight into China ' s strategies in negotiations with the United States . The Chinese considered it crucial to establish strong personal bonds . &quot; They attempt to identify a sympathetic counterpart official in a foreign government and work to cultivate a personal_relationship , a sense of ' friendship ' and obligation , &quot; the study says . &quot; They manipulate feelings of goodwill , obligation , guilt or dependence to achieve their negotiating objectives. &quot; The report shows clearly that during the Nixon Administration ' s opening to China , Chou and other leaders repeatedly played upon Nixon ' s fear that the historic first_steps might be made by Democratic leaders . As soon as Kissinger arrived in Beijing from Pakistan on his secret trip July 9 , 1971 , a year and a half before Nixon ' s first term was to expire , the prime_minister quietly told him : &quot; The time that is left for President Nixon is quite limited. &quot; &quot; Which time_period is the prime_minister talking_about : 5 1 / 2 years or 1 1 / 2 years ? &quot; Kissinger asked , a reference_to whether he expected Nixon to be elected to a second term . Chou replied that when Nixon came_to China , &quot; he will answer that question. &quot; The next day , the prime_minister let Kissinger know he had &quot; a great pile of letters ( from other U.S. politicians ) on my desk , asking_for invitations. &quot; Nixon was so worried that his political rivals would beat him to China that Kissinger specifically told Chou that the President &quot; wants no political visitors before his trip , &quot; the study says . And two weeks later , in secret talks in Paris , Kissinger also added a new request that the Chinese &quot; keep their distance from American ' left ' groups. &quot; China complied with these requests -- in large part , the study says , because Chou and Chairman Mao believed &quot; that Nixon ' s shift in China policy would in fact contribute to the President ' s reelection and thus they , by dealing with Nixon alone , would put the President in their debt. &quot; Kissinger does not discuss these conversations in his memoirs , although he mentions that on the eve of his 1971 meeting with Chou , Nixon had asked him to seek from China &quot; a severe limit on political visitors &quot; before any presidential trip to Beijing . The quotes used in the study also provide voluminous new evidence of the earthy , sometimes crude nature of Mao , the founding leader of the People ' s Republic_of_China . In late 1973 , Mao wondered aloud to Kissinger why Americans were always &quot; breaking_wind &quot; about the Watergate scandal . Two years later , Mao , brought_up among the peasants of Hunan province , taunted Bush , a Yale graduate who was then head of the U.S. liaison office in Beijing : &quot; You don ' t know my temperament . I like people to curse me . . . . If you don ' t curse me , I won ' t see you. &quot; At other times , the transcripts illustrate Mao ' s philosophical side and his self-proclaimed role as the embodiment of China . &quot; The Chinese are very alien-excluding , &quot; Mao told visiting Americans in early 1973 . &quot; For instance , in your country , you can let_in so many nationalities , yet in China , how many foreigners do you see ? . . . You have about 600 # 000 Chinese in the United States . We probably don ' t even have 60 Americans here. &quot; The study also provides a wealth of fascinating new details about the Kissinger and Nixon trips . For example , it discloses that in the days before Nixon ' s visit , U.S. officials were secretly trying to arrange what would have been an even more stunning coup : a meeting in Beijing between the U.S. President and Le Duc Tho , North Vietnam ' s representative to talks aimed at ending the Vietnam_War . According to the study , the White_House had heard rumors Le would visit Beijing just before Nixon ' s trip . On Feb . 6 , 1972 , two weeks before Nixon landed , the United States sent a secret message to China , through Paris , offering to meet with Le to discuss Indochina &quot; with generosity and justice. &quot; China refused , answering that it supported North Vietnam and would not meddle in the talks . The secret offer underscores how much Nixon and Kissinger had hoped that their overtures to China would lead directly to a peace settlement . When Kissinger made his secret trip to China , the history shows , Chou tried unsuccessfully to persuade him that they should tape-record their talks . &quot; I think they wanted to be able to tell the Vietnamese or the Koreans , ' Here ' s a tape of what we said , ' &quot; Solomon , the author of the RAND study , explained . &quot; He ( Chou ) was trying to find a way to protect China ' s credibility with their close allies. &quot; China constantly tried to pit U.S. leaders against one another or to make use of frictions among the Americans , Solomon ' s study indicates . During the Gerald Ford Administration , Chinese leaders played Kissinger against Defense_Secretary James R . Schlesinger . In late 1975 , they invited former President Nixon to China to help bring pressure on Ford for normalization . During the Carter era , they exploited rivalries between Brzezinski and Secretary_of_State Cyrus R . Vance . When Reagan took_office , they favored Secretary_of_State Alexander Haig over Richard Allen , the President ' s national security adviser . The study says China twitted Kissinger for years with Deng ' s 1974 invitation that Schlesinger visit China . &quot; Don ' t be jealous , &quot; Huang Zhen , head of China ' s liaison office in Washington , told Kissinger on Aug . 18 , 1976 , as Schlesinger was about to make his trip . &quot; You have been to China nine times , I believe . You even said yourself you wanted to go_to Inner Mongolia. &quot; &quot; But I didn ' t get there , &quot; Kissinger answered . &quot; I wanted to see the musk_ox of Mongolia. &quot; The RAND report makes_it plain that the Chinese divided U.S. officials into friends and enemies . &quot; In at least one instance , ( China ) actively attempted to block the appointment of an individual they considered to be hostile to them , &quot; the study says . That was Ray Cline , a former CIA station chief in Taiwan and a strong supporter of its interests , who was helping Reagan ' s 1980 presidential campaign . When Bush , then Reagan ' s running mate , visited Beijing in August , 1980 , Deng asked tough , leading questions about whether Cline ' s pro-Taiwanese views reflected Reagan-Bush policy , according to the report . And after Reagan ' s election , the Chinese , fearing that Cline would be appointed assistant secretary_of_state for East Asia , published attacks on his views . Cline did not get the job . In general , the study concludes , the Chinese did not try to cultivate skeptical or hostile Americans . &quot; The Chinese seem to feel comfortable only in dealing with those who share a basic inclination to establish positive guanxi ( relationships ) at the human level , &quot; it says . Chinese leaders skillfully courted U.S. leaders whom they could depict as &quot; old friends &quot; of China -- particularly Kissinger and Bush . &quot; The official or negotiator is put_in the position of having to ' deliver ' for the Chinese to sustain his relationship with them , or face a loss of respect , prestige and political influence &quot; in Chinese eyes , concludes the study . &quot; Such was the game the Chinese played with Henry Kissinger in 1974-75 when they wanted him to complete the normalization process and , with George_Bush in 1980 and 1982 , when they wanted assurances from the Reagan_Administration that it would not ' turn_back the clock ' on U.S.-China policy. &quot; By late 1975 , when it became clear that Kissinger could not bring_about normalization , China ' s dealings with him &quot; bordered at times on the contemptuous , as he was in their view a ' friend ' who had failed to fulfill a commitment , &quot; the report says . Kissinger ' s two volumes of memoirs stop with Nixon ' s resignation and do not cover his years in the Ford Administration . The frictions of the Ford period seemed to have had some lasting effect . According to the study , Deng made some obliquely nasty remarks in 1981 to Secretary_of_State Haig about Kissinger , asserting : &quot; I am very familiar_with Dr. Kissinger . And we have great admiration for Mr. Nixon. &quot; Despite China ' s occasional scorn , the history shows that Kissinger went_to great lengths to preserve the close relationship he had forged with Beijing . On the afternoon of Aug . 9 , 1974 , within hours after Nixon resigned as President , Kissinger assured Huang Zhen , China ' s de_facto ambassador to the United States , that all informal agreements made by Nixon and the Chinese were reconfirmed . Kissinger then brought Huang in_for a meeting with new President Ford , who handed the Chinese envoy a letter to Mao . Ford had only been in office for a_few hours . In the letter , presumably drafted by Kissinger ' s staff , he promised Mao that U.S. policy would remain unchanged , that Kissinger would stay_on as secretary_of_state and that Ford would give top priority to &quot; accelerating &quot; normalization with China . In addition to analyzing Chinese negotiating behavior , the intelligence study was designed to serve as a secret history of the first 16 years of U.S.-China negotiations , from 1969 through 1984 . That was necessary because the classified records of top-level talks with China by the Nixon , Ford , Carter and Reagan_administrations were spread throughout various U.S. agencies and presidential libraries . The Carter and Reagan_administrations had found that Chinese officials sometimes exaggerated what they had been promised by earlier administrations . RAND was working for the National Intelligence Council , the U.S._government ' s umbrella group that oversees the analytic work of the CIA and other agencies in the U.S. intelligence community . The Times first sought access to the report in a 1989 Freedom of Information Act request to the CIA . After four years of review and appeals , the CIA rejected The Times request last summer , releasing only part of the chronology that accompanied the study but none of the conversations or analysis in the study itself . Three months ago , The Times filed a lawsuit against the CIA in U.S. District Court here under the Freedom of Information Act . After reviewing the case , the CIA in late May declassified most of the study , including many of the conversations and the overall analysis , and turned them over to The Times . A few parts of the study are still being withheld . U.S. officials deleted some information on arms sales to Taiwan on grounds that they remain &quot; highly_sensitive &quot; in U.S.-China relations . And they withheld many conversations involving Deng , who , they observed , is &quot; still politically active. &quot; Over the years in which the CIA and State_Department had refused to make the intelligence report public , they cited the importance of maintaining secrecy and confidentiality in foreign_policy . But some U.S. officials had suggested other motivations . Former U.S. Ambassador to China James R . Lilley said last year , &quot; There was a lot of buttering_up of the Chinese that would n ' t look too good today. &quot; HENRY A . KISSINGER : &quot; After a dinner of Peking duck , I ' ll agree to anything. &quot; Feb . 24 , 1972 MAO TSE-TUNG : &quot; The Chinese are very alien-excluding . . . . You have about 600 # 000 Chinese in the United States . We probably don ' t even have 60 Americans here. &quot; 1973 DENG XIAOPING : &quot; I am very familiar_with Dr. Kissinger . And we have great admiration for Mr. Nixon. &quot; June 16 , 1981 , to Secretary_of_State Alexander Haig</TEXT>
