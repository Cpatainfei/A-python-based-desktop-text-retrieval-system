   <HEADLINE> AN EQUAL-RIGHTS ACTION THRILLER GAINS ' SPEED ' ; MOVIES : ANALYSTS SAY THE PICTURE IS AS POPULAR WITH WOMEN AS WITH MEN -- A DEPARTURE FOR THE MALE-DOMINATED SLAM-BANG GENRE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Who ' d have thought a Santa Monica Big Blue Bus could hold its own against such competitors as Alec Baldwin and Julia Roberts ? The bus , of course , is the centerpiece of the summer ' s hot action movie , 20th Century Fox ' s &quot; Speed , &quot; which has already taken_in $ 84.6 million and proven itself a worthy competitor of such film fare as Baldwin ' s &quot; The Shadow &quot; and Roberts ' &quot; I Love Trouble. &quot; As an action movie , &quot; Speed &quot; has its assets -- the prerequisite psycho villain ( Dennis Hopper ) , some out-of-sight pyrotechnics and Keanu Reeves in his first adult role as a policeman trying to save a busload of passengers . But it also has something that distinguishes it from most films in this male-dominated genre -- its appeal_to women . &quot; This film played to women from the second they saw it , &quot; said Andrea Jaffe , president of domestic marketing for Fox , of &quot; Speed ' s &quot; initial test screenings , adding that the film tested well with women regardless of_age . Exit polls taken opening_night by Cinema Score reflect the same data . Although fewer women went_to see the film , the same percentage of women and men -- 97 % -- liked the movie . Harold Mintz , Cinema Score ' s research analyst , put it simply : &quot; Everybody who goes_to see ' Speed ' likes it. &quot; The film ' s print ad_campaign now reflects this phenomenon . Initially focusing_on Reeves and the bus exploding , it now includes Sandra Bullock , whose character ' s fortitude helps save the day . * &quot; We ' ve definitely geared the campaign equally to men and women , &quot; Jaffe said . Jaffe attributes the film ' s success among women to their interest in Reeves . &quot; We knew ( that ) would take them across genres . Our tests showed that women ' s interest in seeing a movie with Keanu Reeves was really high. &quot; Tom Sherak , executive_vice_president for Fox , believes that Reeves ' co-star , Bullock , whose character Annie manages to keep the pedal to the metal while ensuring that the hero doesn ' t have an emotional breakdown , is a significant factor_in the film ' s crossover appeal . &quot; Sandra ' s just like Keanu , she ' s also our hero , &quot; Sherak said . &quot; Women like to see the woman as the hero , and she ' s just as much of a hero as he is. &quot; &quot; For the first time , there ' s a supporting actress who doesn ' t break_down and cry or whine , &quot; Jennifer Fos , 27 , said after seeing the film at the Del Amo Mall in Torrance . &quot; They played her as well as they played him. &quot; Mark Gordon , who produced &quot; Speed , &quot; said that making Annie an equal was intentional . &quot; When we started three years ago , &quot; Gordon said , &quot; I was very interested in creating a female protagonist who was intimately and aggressively involved in the progress of the movie , rather than being saved by the man throughout the film. &quot; Director Jan DeBont agreed : &quot; Sandra ' s playing such a different part than the usual , she ' s not helpless . . . she ' s in_charge of_her_own destiny . In fact , she ' s more in_charge of herself than Keanu ' s character is. &quot; Also , this is an action movie without a lot of blood and gore . For Dena White , 25 , who saw the film at the Beverly Center Cineplex , &quot; Speed &quot; offered a welcome respite to the usual action fare . &quot; I usually don ' t like action movies , because they ' re too violent , too many people getting killed. &quot; But &quot; Speed , &quot; White said , was different . &quot; It ' s like you ' re pulled_along , and you ' re not sure what ' s going_to happen next . It ' s not like ' Robocop ' where you don ' t care what happens. &quot; DeBont acknowledges that he consciously tried to limit the violence . &quot; I don ' t like to see it myself , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m so fed up with seeing violence in movies , on television . There ' s already so_much in the city that when I go_to the movies I want to have the action based on feeling and emotion rather than on violence and gore. &quot; &quot; Unlike some_other action movies , this one ' s not done with a body_count , &quot; Sherak agreed . &quot; People do die . . . but that ' s balanced by all_the people who get saved. &quot; Gordon concurred . &quot; Most action pictures are all about people being mowed_down by machine_guns . Fewer than 10 people die in this movie . . . . ( Audiences ) have had it with gratuitous violence . &quot; One of the things that keeps people coming_back , &quot; Gordon continued , &quot; and why it has crossed over to women , is that it ' s a ride , a roller_coaster ride. &quot; Sherak thinks &quot; Speed &quot; transcends its action movie status and is instead &quot; the definition of a summer fun movie . It touches all_the right buttons . . . . It ' s a good movie for the public and for the film business . If you see a picture like ' Speed , ' it makes you feel good about movies , and that ' s contagious , it spurs you to see another movie. &quot; And Bullock has reaped the benefits that come_with being in one of the biggest hits of the summer . The actress will next star in &quot; While You Were Sleeping &quot; for a reported $ 1.2-million salary .</TEXT>
