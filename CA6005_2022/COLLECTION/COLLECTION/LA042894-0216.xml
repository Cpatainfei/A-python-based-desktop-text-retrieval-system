   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 / 50 DAYS AND COUNTING ; MORE TICKETS ON SALE ; SOCCER : ABOUT 450 # 000 TO BE AVAILABLE SUNDAY , INCLUDING 60 # 000 FOR ROSE BOWL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About 450 # 000 tickets to individual games in the 1994 World Cup soccer tournament will go_on sale Sunday morning , including about 60 # 000 tickets for matches at the Rose Bowl , The Times has learned . The tickets , returned to the organizing committee by sponsors and nations that failed to qualify , will be available by telephone only and each buyer will be limited to a maximum of 10 per game . This is the final allotment of tickets being individually sold for the 52-game tournament , to be played in nine U.S. cities between June 17 and July 17 . Official announcement of the sale will be made at a news_conference in New York today . Nine of the matches will not be part of the sale . Five of those are sold_out : Italy-Ireland and Italy-Norway at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford , N.J. ; Argentina-Greece and Argentina-Nigeria at Foxboro Stadium in Foxboro , Mass. , and Belgium-Netherlands at the Citrus Bowl in Orlando , Fla . In addition , one semifinal , the third-place match and the final , all at the Rose Bowl , as well as the other semifinal at Giants Stadium , are not included in the individual-game sale . Tickets for those matches can be purchased only as part of multi-game premier packages . Alan Rothenberg , the chairman of World Cup USA 1994 and president of the U.S. Soccer Federation , said Wednesday he is confident every match will be sold_out . If so , the sale of between 3.5 and 3.6 million tickets will bring_in about $ 275 million to the World Cup coffers , he said . &quot; Los Angeles and San Francisco have been selling like crazy , &quot; Rothenberg said . &quot; Of course , New York ( Giants Stadium ) would have been hot regardless of which teams it drew , and then it ended_up with Italy and Ireland . &quot; New York has been a madhouse . There are a_couple_of games there that I wish Giants Stadium had two million seats . I think we ' d sell them all. &quot; Rothenberg said ticket demand has been high at all nine cites . &quot; I don ' t think we ' re struggling anywhere , &quot; he said . &quot; My guess is that there ' ll be a half_a_dozen games around the country that will take probably right up_to game time to sell_out completely . &quot; I think you can pinpoint a game here and a game there that don ' t have glamour teams or aren ' t in a city where there ' s a clear ethnic connection , ( but ) I still remain confident that we will sell them all. &quot; The tickets , which will go_on sale at 7 a.m. PDT on Sunday via World Cup Ticketing ( 1-800-769-1994 ) , could be sold_out quickly because not that many are available . At the Rose Bowl , for example , Rothenberg said availability ranged from 10 # 000 to 20 # 000 per game . Seating capacity for the World Cup will be slightly more_than 90 # 000 . &quot; There are less than 10 # 000 ( tickets ) available for the round of 16 , &quot; he said &quot; There are less than 10 # 000 available for the U.S.-Colombia game ; there are somewhere between 10 # 000 and 20 # 000 for the Colombia-Romania game , and probably between 15 # 000 and 20 # 000 for the Cameroon-Sweden and the U.S.-Romania games. &quot; More_than 90 % of the 720 # 000 seats available for the eight matches at the Rose Bowl have been sold . Rothenberg said he does not believe there will be empty seats at World Cup matches , as was the case in Mexico in 1986 and in Italy in 1990 , when all_the tickets were sold but many went unused because they were sold before the competing teams were known . &quot; We ' ve been working very hard to avoid that , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m really hopeful that we ' ll not only have sold all_the tickets but that we ' ll actually have people in the seats. &quot; The tickets that go_on sale Sunday include all price ranges ( $ 25 to $ 475 ) , Rothenberg said , adding that he was satisfied organizers had priced the World Cup appropriately . &quot; We definitely could have charged more all_the way along the line , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s an art_form , it ' s not a science . Obviously , we wanted to price the tickets high enough so we can pay_for the event -- that was our priority -- but at_the_same_time not be unfair to the public. &quot;</TEXT>
