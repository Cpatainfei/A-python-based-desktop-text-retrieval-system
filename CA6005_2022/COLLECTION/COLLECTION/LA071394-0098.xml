   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : RUMOR OF THE DAY : ROMARIO REALLY LIKES BEBETO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Brazilians have come_to Nutwood . Hundreds of them . It is the name of the street in Fullerton where the fun-loving soccer players of Brazil are being lodged , directly across the street from Texas Loosey ' s chili parlor , where the women employees wear cowboy_hats and bathing_suits . Just past lunchtime , as the salt-and-pepper sidekicks Bebeto and Romario stroll together through the lobby of the hotel , there is such a crush of Brazilian fanhood that the superstars must weave their way to a small salon as they would through Sweden ' s defense . Because of the mob , the hotel restaurant already has cut_off service to anyone not registered as a guest , sending the hungry scurrying across the highway for chilly women con carne . &quot; Bebeto ! &quot; &quot; Romario ! &quot; Sao duas horas ( it ' s 2 o ' clock ) on a windy Terca-feira ( Tuesday ) afternoon here in Fullerton , where the_hills are alive_with the sound of Portuguese . The whole town is turning_into Brazilville . The nearby university has become Cal State Rio . And nobody much minds anymore that Brazil is the team that eliminated Team USA . Forgive , forget . After all , Brazil could be the team that eliminates everybody . Bebeto . Romario . They are the go-to guys . They are the lucky strikers , the men who get_to score the goals , the most potent 1-2 punch_in World Cup soccer , men who hear their names called with passion wherever they go -- even Fullerton . And a common goal that consumes them is to end the &quot; 24 years of suffering , &quot; as Romario calls it , since parched Brazilians have drunk from the Cup . Romario : &quot; We have heard it said that the yellow jersey was a pretty jersey , but it did not have a heart beating inside of it . We hope following this World Cup , it will still be a pretty jersey , but it has 11 hearts beating beneath it. &quot; Bebeto : &quot; Yes . Eleven hearts. &quot; They think alike , these two . But are they alike ? Bebeto laughs . Romario : &quot; We are different people . Bebeto is the type that stays_at home . I am a street cat. &quot; Behind closed doors they relax , away from the hubbub outside . Romario , 28 , two years younger and four inches shorter , wears a heavy cinco horas shadow of whiskers and a &quot; Just Do It &quot; baseball_cap . Once a poor_boy from Jacarezinho whose family had little to eat , he is now Super Romario , indebted to his parents for &quot; everything I am today , &quot; a rich and famous football giant of 5 feet 6 . What else is Romario ? &quot; I ' m the face of Rio . I ' m a cheerful person , the sort of person who likes the samba and the Carnaval . I love life . I want to enjoy it . I love the sun and the beach . that ' s what the Carioca ( Rio de Janeiro resident ) is like , he knows how to enjoy life and be happy . I ' m happy . After all , I ' m a Carioca. &quot; Yet he and Bebeto , the samba kings , share more_than games and fame . They are men who know pain as well as pleasure , men whose common bond includes family crises . Both have seen their happy home lives invaded by kidnapers . One man a month ago put a submachine_gun to the head of Bebeto ' s 25-year-old pregnant wife . The crooks settled for a Rolex and her car . A month before that , it was Romario ' s father who was kidnaped while leaving a bar . Six days later he was found , unharmed . Family ties . Bebeto : &quot; On the seventh of July , my wife gave_birth to our baby , Mattheus , so named for ( Germany ' s ) Lothar Matthaeus , a great player . When I scored the goal ( against the United States ) , I pretended to rock the baby as an homage to our new son. &quot; Romario : &quot; I hope his wife comes_up with another baby next week. &quot; They are , indeed , friends . It still amuses or annoys Bebeto and Romario when others try to drive a wedge between them . Some remember when Romario reportedly used the word chorao ( crybaby ) with_regard_to his teammate , but what Romario meant was that Bebeto has been known to complain to officials about calls , that ' s all . Romario : &quot; A lot of the news that arrived to us about that ( not being friends ) was simply out-and-out lies . I respect Bebeto a lot . He knows how much I like him. &quot; Bebeto : &quot; Romario says it all. &quot; It takes two to tangle . The relationship on the field between Romario de Souza Faria and Jose Roberto ( Bebeto ) Gama de Oliveira is a dance in which each knows the other ' s steps . &quot; Of course we make a great pair , &quot; admits Bebeto , but he agrees that to truly be the best , first Brazil must win twice more . Romario : &quot; The only thing we have in common on the field is that we both score goals . Bebeto is more of a free-flowing , moving , all-around player than I am . He practically plays for all 90 minutes , concentrating_on what is happening all_the time . And I , my strength ? My strength is sometimes people think I ' m just sleeping. &quot; Bebeto : &quot; What can I say about Romario ? He finishes like nobody . He has great ability , great velocity in short spaces . He ' s a born finisher . A lot of people think he is just hanging_around doing nothing and suddenly , bang , it ' s a goal. &quot; And ? Bebeto : &quot; And , he ' s really my friend. &quot;</TEXT>
