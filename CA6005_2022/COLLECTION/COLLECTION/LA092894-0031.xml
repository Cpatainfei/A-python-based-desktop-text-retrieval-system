   <TEXT> Is everyone trying to capitalize on the case ? It isn ' t enough that there are billboards advertising such goods as Not Guilty jeans and DNA cologne around town . Now we ' ve come_across still another product that conjures_up visions of the O.J. Simpson trial . It ' s called SeQuester . There ' s no real connection , though . SeQuester is merely a diet pill . On the other hand , maybe -- after you ' ve taken it -- you ' re supposed to lock yourself up in a hotel_room with no newspapers or television . * It ' s a bad time for me to go_on the air , Larry : Remember when Robert Shapiro , one of the attorneys for O.J. Simpson , received a call_on his cellular_phone in the courtroom , angering Superior_Court Judge Lance Ito ? Well , the newspaper Variety reports that sources identified the caller as none other_than TV talk_show host Larry King . * Anniversary-itis : We can ' t remember a year when there have been so many landmark -- and non-landmark -- events celebrated . Locally , there have been anniversaries celebrated by UCLA ( 75th ) , the Queen Mary ( 60th ) , commercial star Chiquita Banana ( 50th -- and don ' t you dare call her an old banana ) , and the L.A. Olympics and the incorporation of West Hollywood ( the 10th for both ) . But a_few other epochal L.A. events have been overlooked . After all , 1994 also marks the : * 5th anniversary of the world ' s first rock seance in Hollywood . Participants beseeched the late Jimi Hendrix to play a_few bars of &quot; Purple Haze. &quot; But his spirit was a no-show . * 10th anniversary of singer Michael Jackson ' s hair catching_fire during the filming of a Pepsi commercial at the Shrine Auditorium . * 45th anniversary of the Battle of Sunset Boulevard , when mobster Mickey Cohen was wounded during a shootout as he left a nightclub . * 55th anniversary of the Battle of Santa Monica Bay , when Tony Cornero used a fire_hose in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent authorities from seizing his gambling boat , the Rex . * 90th anniversary of the founding of Abbott Kinney ' s beach resort , Venice of America . The name was later shortened to Venice at the insistence of the rest of America . * Thanks a lot , KFI : We notice that talk-radio station KFI has stopped running those ads that said , &quot; Oh God . Baseball again . Not here. &quot; miscelLAny Paul Kneipp of L.A. read in a local newspaper that the goods at a Larchmont Village Sidewalk and Antique Sale would be sold through a &quot; bargain process. &quot; He observed : &quot; I believe that ' s the new , politically correct term for ' haggling.
