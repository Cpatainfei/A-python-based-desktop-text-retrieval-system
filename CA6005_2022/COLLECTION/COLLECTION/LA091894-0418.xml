   <HEADLINE> CONDO Q &amp; A : TRY MEDIATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : I was recently elected to the board of directors of my condominium association . I am concerned that our manager does not have a fidelity bond . I asked to see the bank records for the operating account and the savings account but the other board_members will not release the records . My lawyer says that I will have to spend several thousand dollars of my own money to file an injunction to force them to disclose the records that I am legally entitled to see . What alternative course of action would you recommend ? Does the new law requiring arbitration apply to this type of dispute ? ANSWER : Didn ' t your attorney suggest writing a letter ? Have letters been ineffective in the past ? Sometimes even board_members have to document their request by corresponding with the rest of the board . Since you are a board_member , you are entitled to see the bank_account records . However , if you are the type of person who would use this information to find_fault_with the board ' s fiscal_policies or the manager ' s purchasing and payment methods , this may be the reason that the other board_members are holding you off . When you review the records , try to be objective . There is a difference between a watchful board_member who is fulfilling a fiduciary_duty to protect the association ' s finances and one who is nit-picking about every bill that is paid . There are several steps that you can take prior to filing legal_action . I am not an attorney , but in my opinion , your attorney should have discussed these less expensive alternatives with you . Filing an injunction should be your last_resort . First , you can write a letter to all_of the other board_members requesting access to the financial records that you want to review . As a board_member , you should have access to any and all records of the association . In your letter to the board , there are certain laws that you can cite that may educate the board . According to California Corporations Code , Section 8334 : &quot; Every director shall have the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect and copy all books , records and documents of every kind and to inspect the physical_properties of the corporation of which such person is a director. &quot; In addition , the California Civil Code , Section 1365.5 , states that the board of directors of a community association must do all_of the following : 1 -- Review a current reconciliation of the association ' s operating and reserve_accounts on at least a quarterly basis and review the most recent statements prepared by the financial_institutions where the association ' s operating and reserve_funds are kept . 2 -- On at least a quarterly basis , review the current year ' s actual reserve revenues and expenses compared to the current year ' s reserve budget and review an income and expense statement for the association ' s operating and reserve_accounts . If the association ' s governing documents impose more stringent accounting duties on the board of directors , then your board must perform their duties according to the governing documents . After you or your attorney write a letter to the board citing all_of these reasons why you should have access to the records , the board_members will surely grant your request . If they ignore your letter , then the next step is an attempt to mediate or arbitrate the dispute prior to seeking a court injunction . You do not have to be represented by an attorney . There is one other bit of advice I would offer . The association should purchase fidelity bond coverage and the board should ensure that the reserve_funds are under the control of the board_members . Two directors or officers should sign any withdrawal from the reserve_account and the amount of the withdrawal and the purpose should be noted in the board_meeting minutes . Can Board of Directors Fill Board Vacancy ? Q : I live_in a homeowner association in Santa Barbara . Can the board of directors appoint a board_member to fill a vacancy on the board ? Don ' t all directors have to be elected by the membership at a meeting called_for that purpose ? A : Usually , the answer to your question can be found in your association ' s bylaws . The bylaws contain information about how the board operates and when membership meetings are required . California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporations Code defers to the bylaws regarding replacement of directors . In most associations , the remaining board_members have the authority to appoint a board_member to fill a vacancy if the vacancy occurs because of a resignation . However , if the vacancy is the result of a recall vote of the members , then the entire membership votes on the replacement . Always review your association ' s governing documents when you have a question about how the association should operate .</TEXT>
