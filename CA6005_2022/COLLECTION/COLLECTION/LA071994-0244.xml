   <HEADLINE> SIMPSON LAWYERS ATTACK KEY DETECTIVE ' S CREDIBILITY ; COURTS : THEY SUGGEST HE MAY HAVE PLANTED BLOODY GLOVE AT MANSION . HIS WORK HISTORY MIGHT BECOME ISSUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an aggressive attack on a Los Angeles police_detective ' s credibility , O.J. Simpson ' s defense_team has injected new controversy into the case , suggesting that the officer may have planted a key piece of evidence against Simpson -- the bloody glove . Members of Simpson ' s defense_team are using a 1983 disability pension case filed by Detective Mark Fuhrman along with other research into his work history in an effort to show that his credibility has previously been challenged , that he has made derogatory racial statements and that he may have lied_about his conduct in the Simpson probe . Fuhrman , who found a bloody glove outside Simpson ' s Brentwood mansion , testified during this month ' s preliminary hearing , after which the football Hall of Famer was ordered to stand trial for the double murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman . Members of Simpson ' s defense camp say they do not expect to challenge the 42-year-old detective by suggesting that he is racist , but rather hope to use questions about his work history -- including the 1983 disability case and a more recent investigation of his treatment of female colleagues -- to raise doubts about his credibility or even to suggest that he might have planted the glove in_order to be hailed as a hero . Fuhrman ' s 1983 case came_to_light on a national scale Sunday with news that Newsweek and the New Yorker magazine were publishing stories analyzing the defense strategy and its efforts to discredit the officer . As with other developments in the ever-evolving Simpson case , it spawned a rash of other requests for interviews , and LAPD officials were deluged by reporters again Monday . They declined to comment , saying the work history of Fuhrman , who joined the LAPD in 1975 , was a personnel matter . The attack on Fuhrman ' s credibility is a risky one , in part because it would focus a jury ' s attention on the significance of a bloody glove turning_up at the home of the defendant . No witnesses have come_forward to say that they saw Fuhrman plant the glove , but experts say the defense attack on his credibility is probably motivated by a desire to make jurors suspicious of the glove when they weigh Simpson ' s guilt or innocence . The likely intent of the defense maneuver &quot; is to undercut the credibility of the police_investigation and the prosecution case -- just raise doubts , &quot; said Laurie Levenson , a Loyola law_school professor and former federal prosecutor . &quot; Even if this theory doesn ' t work , it would be kind of an instructive lesson to the jurors about how they can go_about looking_for problems with the prosecution case -- to start them thinking_of all_the ways the prosecution could have unfairly pinned this on O.J. Simpson. &quot; During the contentious preliminary hearing , Simpson ' s attorneys , led by Robert L . Shapiro , repeatedly suggested that their client is being railroaded by overzealous or careless investigators . Among other things , Shapiro accused police of lying to obtain a search_warrant , of failing to protect the scene of the crime and of mishandling important pieces of evidence . Defense_lawyers did not have Fuhrman ' s work history on_hand for that hearing , but have since uncovered several pieces of information that they will probably use as the case proceeds . In Fuhrman ' s 1983 lawsuit , he told therapists that he was suffering from intense stress , that he left the Marine Corps after developing antagonistic feelings toward Mexican and African Americans , that he had beaten suspects and that he was preoccupied with violence . &quot; During his last six months ( in the Marine Corps ) , he ' got tired_of having a bunch of Mexicans and niggers that should be in prison telling ( him ) they weren ' t going_to do something , ' &quot; Fuhrman was quoted as saying in one psychiatric evaluation performed in connection with the 1983 case . Those and other racially charged comments may come_back to haunt Fuhrman , lawyers said . &quot; These are his own words and he may live to regret them , &quot; said Los Angeles defense_lawyer Marcia A . Morrisey . Ironically , Fuhrman ' s credibility was challenged in 1983 by the very people who now employ him , the city of Los Angeles . In arguing that Fuhrman should not receive the stress pension he was seeking , lawyers and doctors for the city accused him of exaggerating his psychological problems for financial_gain . &quot; This man has become tired_of police work just as he became bored with life as a Marine , &quot; said Dr. Ronald R . Koegler , a doctor who examined Fuhrman on behalf of the city in that case . &quot; He does not want to quit and lose his benefits , so he is attempting to get pension and compensation rewards. &quot; Police pension cases such_as this one often produce wildly divergent accounts of an officer ' s health . Police_officers claiming stress frequently try to find psychiatrists who will say they are suffering , while city-hired doctors typically counter that the officers are in fine health and are lying to get a pension . Fuhrman lost the pension lawsuit , and his troubles with the LAPD did not end there . He has been sued unsuccessfully several times by people claiming he used excessive force . And according to department sources , he is currently a target of an LAPD probe into alleged sexual_harassment at the West Los Angeles station . Fuhrman , those sources said , belongs_to an informal club known as MAW -- short for Men Against Women . The group has attracted officers who deride the ability of female colleagues and who believe that women are unfit for police work . The LAPD is conducting a sweeping audit of the West Los Angeles station , where Fuhrman works . The department has transferred a number of officers to other divisions in_order to improve the working environment in West Los Angeles . Nevertheless , the same police sources who said Fuhrman is being investigated in the sexual_harassment probe also consider him an outstanding investigator . His recent cases have included a number of widely praised performances . Fuhrman ' s performance on the witness_stand during Simpson ' s preliminary hearing also impressed lawyers , police and lay people . Legal experts agreed that no challenge to Fuhrman ' s character or integrity would be enough to exclude the bloody glove from evidence unless some witness says Fuhrman planted it at the house . No such witness has come_forward , and sources suggest several potential problems with that theory . First , they say , Fuhrman was not the first police_officer to arrive_at the scene of the murders . By the time he got there , a number of patrol officers were_on hand , and none of them have reported seeing a second bloody glove near the bodies . To plant one of the gloves at Simpson ' s house , Fuhrman would have had to find it at the scene of the crime after other officers had overlooked it , then he would have had to surreptitiously pocket it and carry it to Simpson ' s home unnoticed . Second , police sources point_out , Simpson friend Brian ( Kato ) Kaelin testified during the preliminary hearing that he heard three loud thumps outside his wall on the night of the murders . It was when Kaelin told Fuhrman about that thumping that the detective went_to investigate and returned with news that he had discovered the glove . Still , by raising questions about Fuhrman ' s past , defense_attorneys may be able to conduct a more searching analysis of department personnel records to determine whether the detective has been the subject of other complaints . That , in turn , may give them additional grist to challenge the detective ' s credibility if and when he takes_the_stand in the Simpson trial . In the meantime , the latest disclosures have injected race into the already volatile case , a development that defense_attorneys say may be inevitable even though few welcome it in a city famous for its recent racial tensions . Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , a prominent Los Angeles attorney whose name has been floated as a possible addition to the Simpson legal team , said questions about Fuhrman ' s racial attitudes are relevant and should be pursued by the ex-athlete ' s lawyers . &quot; As much as I don ' t want to see race brought into this case , if this person has a feeling against minorities , his credibility becomes very much at_issue , &quot; Cochran said . &quot; It could be a very powerful issue . . . . I think you ' ll see the defense really seek to exploit it. &quot; That , too , is a risky proposition , however . Some analysts , such_as UCLA law professor Peter Arenella , warned that calling attention to the issue of race could antagonize some jurors even as it meets with the approval of others . Before the allegations about Fuhrman surfaced , some polls were suggesting that whites and blacks perceive the handling of the Simpson case differently . Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti is scheduled to meet this morning with John Mack , president of the Los Angeles Urban League , and with other prominent African Americans to discuss the Simpson case , according to an invitation to the meeting obtained by The Times . Mack would not comment on the meeting . But a source close to the league said Garcetti asked_for the meeting after some blacks expressed concerns over what they saw as potentially prejudicial public statements he and others in his office made early in the case . Others worried that the prosecution , intent upon winning the case above all else , would not deal Simpson a fair hand , the source said . The racially charged comments attributed to Fuhrman in his disability case are 11 years old , a fact that might weigh against a judge allowing them to be admitted in the Simpson trial or in hearings leading_up to it . &quot; Even though racial bias would be admitted in some cases to impeach , his racial views are old to begin with , &quot; said E . Thomas Dunn , an Orange County deputy district_attorney and evidence specialist . &quot; They don ' t necessarily reflect his current beliefs . They seem to me of marginal relevance . Whether a person is racially biased . . . does not necessarily impact upon his observations at the scene of a crime. &quot; Nevertheless , other legal_experts agreed that much of the material , as well as any comments connected to the sexual_harassment probe , might work their way into the Simpson case if they cast any doubt on Fuhrman ' s history of telling the truth . Peter Keane , chief deputy public_defender of San Francisco , said he thought Fuhrman ' s prior statements would be admissible during cross-examination because they suggested that the detective might have a hidden bias in the Simpson case . &quot; It goes_to bias , &quot; Keane said . &quot; Bias is one of the principal ways of attacking and impeaching a witness on cross-examination. &quot; Courts have allowed lawyers broad discretion in challenging the credibility of witnesses . In 1984 , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the right of prosecutors to introduce evidence that a defendant and a key alibi witness in a Bellflower bank robbery case both had been members of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang , described by the court as &quot; a secret prison sect sworn to perjury and self-protection. &quot; The defense contended that the gang information was highly inflammatory and increased the chance that the jury would convict the defendant merely because of his gang association . But the high_court ruled that it was permissible for prosecutors to cross-examine the witness about the prison gang to show possible bias in favor of the defendant and to show past conduct that would bear_on his truthfulness as a witness . Times staff writers Andrea Ford and Nicholas Riccardi contributed to this report .</TEXT>
