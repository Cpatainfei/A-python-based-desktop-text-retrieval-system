   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : VENTURA ; 3 SEA_LIONS SHIPPED IN FROM WASHINGTON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Over the objections of the California Coastal Commission and local fishing officials , the National Marine Fisheries Service has trucked three Washington state sea_lions to waters off the Ventura County coastline . Three of the mammals were deposited in the ocean near Ventura Harbor by fisheries officials late last week.The transfer was done_in hopes of reducing the sea_lions ' take of already decimated steelhead trout populations around Ballard Locks_in Washington ' s Puget Sound . Fisheries service officials cited their &quot; administrative authority &quot; to move_up to 10 of the fish-eating animals to Southern California , despite the Coastal Commission ' s rejection in February of a request to transfer up_to 60 sea_lions . &quot; Given the severe decline of the steelhead population and how efficient sea_lions are as predators , we had to do what we could , &quot; said Hal Alabaster , spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the parent agency of the fisheries service . But James R . Raives , a Coastal Commission analyst , said Washington officials are just transferring their problem to Southern California . &quot; There ' s a strong possibility that such a relocation won ' t work anyway , &quot; Raives said . &quot; At best , it ' s just a temporary fix for them . It really is not addressing the real issue of how they are dealing with their steelhead populations. &quot; Local fishing industry officials have argued against the transfer , saying the aggressive sea mammals can thwart fishing operations by helping themselves to catches of halibut and sea_bass , often directly from fishing_nets .
