   <HEADLINE> JACKSON , ALLEGED VICTIM REPORTEDLY NEAR SETTLEMENT ; LAWSUIT : SINGER MAY PAY BOY MILLIONS IN MOLESTATION CASE , SOURCES SAY . CRIMINAL CHARGES COULD STILL BE FILED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Attorneys for Michael Jackson and a 14-year-old boy who says the singer sexually molested him are near a settlement of the boy ' s lawsuit and hope to announce Tuesday that the case has been resolved , sources familiar_with the negotiations said Sunday . Rumors of an impending settlement have swirled around the case since Jan . 14 , when lawyers for both sides met in chambers with Superior_Court Judge David Rothman . Afterward , the judge said the attorneys had agreed to halt their public comments on the case . Since then , a number of reports and courthouse rumors have suggested that a deal was in the works . A London tabloid reported last week that Jackson had agreed to pay at least $ 40 million to the boy , while Time magazine will report this week that the figure is closer to $ 5 million . Sources told The Times that the deal is for &quot; eight figures &quot; -- somewhere between $ 10 million and $ 100 million -- but would not elaborate . Negotiations continue , they said , adding that talks have not revolved_around the amount of the settlement but around other issues concerning resolution of the civil case . Larry R . Feldman , the boy ' s lawyer , did not return phone_calls Sunday . Howard Weitzman , a lawyer for Jackson , was unavailable for comment . Motions in the case are scheduled to be heard Tuesday , and if a deal is not made by that time , the courtroom session will go_ahead , sources said . On the other hand , if both sides resolve the lingering issues , the lawyers are expected to announce at that session that the case has been settled . They are not expected to disclose details of any settlement . Of particular interest to police , sheriff ' s deputies and prosecutors from Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties is what effect a settlement might have_on their criminal investigation into allegations that Jackson sexually molested the boy over a period of about four months last year . Investigators have interviewed dozens of witnesses -- including the alleged victim -- as part of that probe . Legal experts said no written agreement could prevent the boy from testifying against Jackson in a criminal case . Drafting such an agreement could be construed as obstructing a criminal investigation and could be punishable under legal provisions that preclude anyone from &quot; compounding a crime. &quot; Moreover , under California law , minors can be and sometimes are required to testify against their will . The law includes an exception for adult or juvenile victims of sex crimes , however , so the boy in this case probably could not be forced to take_the_stand if he decided against it , legal_experts said . Just as important as the law , however , is a practical question : If the boy were to refuse to testify in the criminal case , would prosecutors be willing to force him to the stand to press their case against Jackson ? &quot; that ' s a difficult call , &quot; said Harland Braun , an experienced criminal lawyer and former deputy district_attorney . &quot; There are two considerations here : You prosecute crimes partly for the victims , but also to protect the public. &quot; For Jackson , ending the civil case would at the very least remove him from a proceeding that has damaged his career and , according to the entertainer and his advisers , taken a toll on his health . Jackson abruptly ended a world tour last year , claiming that the allegations and recent scalp surgery had caused him such stress that he became addicted to painkillers . At that time , one of Jackson ' s lawyers , Bertram Fields , said the singer was &quot; barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level &quot; and would require at least six to eight weeks of treatment at an undisclosed location overseas . Jackson returned to the country four weeks later and publicly proclaimed his innocence in a nationally televised statement from his Los Olivos ranch , known as Neverland . In recent weeks , the legal pressure against Jackson has mounted , as the boy ' s lawyer has pressed the civil case on several fronts . On Jan . 10 , Feldman filed a motion seeking access to Jackson ' s financial records , and he attached_to that motion a number of excerpts from depositions taken as part of the lawsuit . In those depositions , a former maid for Jackson spelled_out what she said were several instances in which she saw the entertainer naked with young boys . Other employees and former employees described a security_system that alerted Jackson whenever someone approached his bedroom , and one former secretary acknowledged that she told police Jackson was a pedophile , though she added that she regretted and disavowed those comments . Although Jackson ' s lawyers had sought to prevent release of the depositions to the public or prosecutors , Rothman overruled that motion . As a result , the information learned in the civil case is available to prosecutors considering whether to bring criminal charges .</TEXT>
