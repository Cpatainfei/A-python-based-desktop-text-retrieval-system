   <TEXT> * &quot; North_Korea Plays a Dangerous Game &quot; states your Feb . 7 editorial , which goes_on to remind us &quot; how great a worry North_Korea ' s nuclear program has become. &quot; You are right , there is no greater worry than a global body_politic diseased by the cancer-like spread of nuclear_weapons . The problem , largely ignored by our news media , is that since the dawn of the nuclear age we have been guilty of a demeaning double_standard : While preaching nuclear abstention to others , we ourselves have been practicing precisely the opposite . While serving on our country ' s delegation to the 1978 U.N. Special_Session on Disarmament , I was told by a delegate from Pakistan that the leader of her nation had recently expressed his determination to obtain nuclear_weapons &quot; even if our people have to eat grass. &quot; She followed this with a question : How can the United States and the Soviet_Union be too blind to see that their senseless competition for so-called nuclear superiority creates powerful pressure upon others to become &quot; nuclear-haves &quot; ? Let me stipulate to simplistic sloganeers that we can ' t put the genie back in the bottle . Should we therefore permit the genie to multiply to a point at which nuclear catastrophe becomes a question of when rather than if ? In Cold_War competition the focus was_on bombs . If we can now shift to brains , there surely exists sufficient human intelligence to construct a political pathway that leads , incrementally , to non-proliferation which is internationally accepted and enforced . The first_step must be ours -- a determined effort by President Clinton to speed_up and strengthen negotiations to ban all nuclear testing , everywhere , by 1995 . HAROLD WILLENS Los Angeles</TEXT>
