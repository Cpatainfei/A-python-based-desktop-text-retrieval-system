   <HEADLINE> LIVE AT FOREST LAWN ! ; MICHELANGELO PORTRAYALS PACK THE MAUSOLEUM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You don ' t have to be dead to see actor Pablo Marz ' s one-man show , but it does help you get a good seat . Twice a year , Marz , 41 , portrays the artist Michelangelo before crowds packed into the main room of the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in Glendale . He has already heard all_the jokes . &quot; I don ' t know how many times I ' ve heard , ' Must be a dead crowd_out there , ' &quot; Marz said Thursday morning as he pulled on a pair of gray , green and red tights that are part of his rented Renaissance costume . He was dressing in a small rotunda outside the Hall of Commemoration , one of the many crypt-filled hallways in the imposing mausoleum . Nearby and out_of_sight , about 250 schoolchildren were taking their seats in the Memorial Court of Honor where Marz would perform his &quot; A Visit with Michelangelo &quot; show . &quot; I also get ' Knock ' em dead ' a lot , &quot; Marz continued , shaking his head . He was fitting breeches over the tights . &quot; But when they hear what this is all about , they are impressed . &quot; For an actor , this is a good gig. &quot; And it draws a good crowd . The Michelangelo show , presented just four days a year , is free to school groups but has to be booked far in_advance . Reservations have already been made_for the next presentation of the show in October . The purpose of the program , which began in 1988 at the park ( Forest Lawn officials never say cemetery ) , is to teach the students a bit about Michelangelo ' s sculptures , several copies of which sit in the Memorial Court . The program is also supposed to instill in the students some appreciation for the artwork . Marz had his work cut_out for him . Out in the audience sat Michael Player , 10 , who was part of the group bused in_for the show from Ventura Missionary school in Ventura . Michael had heard of Michelangelo . &quot; Sure , &quot; he said , &quot; he ' s one of the Teenage Ninja Turtles. &quot; Backstage in the marble-lined rotunda , Marz put_on a leather doublet , then a gold cape . Park soundman Milan Ubovich , who had filled the court with Italian Renaissance choral music for the incoming crowd , came backstage to hook_up a wireless microphone on the actor . &quot; Darling , you look good in a cape , &quot; Ubovich told Marz with a laugh . Marz , a veteran of numerous local theater shows , checked his makeup -- which included a broken nose like the one Michelangelo got_in a childhood fight -- in a restroom off the rotunda . He ran water into his only prop , a metal wine goblet . &quot; I have to get dressed in the men ' s room , my wine goblet is filled with tap_water and no one brings me coffee , &quot; he said with a smile . &quot; It ' s the life of an actor. &quot; It was show time . From the front of the court , Education Affairs Director J . Carol Winn gave him an enthusiastic introduction . &quot; Let ' s give a big_hand and welcome to Michelangelo ! &quot; she told the kids . They clapped politely and Marz entered the court , his cape trailing . &quot; Bonjourno ! &quot; he called_out in an Italian accent , took a drink from the goblet and asked the students how many were artists . About 20 hands shot_up . &quot; An artist does not just paint , &quot; Marz proclaimed . &quot; If you dance , make music , act , then you are also an artist . Everyone has a gift , inside , to create. &quot; He told them of Michelangelo ' s early years in Florence and of the boy ' s father objecting to art as a profession . From the many biographies and reference_books Marz had studied , he told them of Michelangelo ' s financial struggles at a time when only the church and the rich could afford to commission art . Marz ' s performance never delved into the cutesy asides and condensation too often present in children ' s shows . He instead held the attention of the room with his acting ability and passion for his subject . As Marz came_to each statue in the room , he explained why it was a great work . &quot; In my time , this scene was portrayed always as very sad , very painful and mournful , &quot; he said , pointing_out &quot; La Pieta , &quot; the famous scene of Mary holding Christ ' s body after the Crucifixion . &quot; I wanted to change that ; I wanted to show how Christ is finally at_peace , &quot; he said , pointing_out Mary ' s serene expression . Marz never imagined when he took_up acting_as a student at Los Angeles City College , then with a variety of coaches , including Nina Foch , that he would end_up doing a show for students in a cemetery . He recently acted in a_couple_of action films for a small production company , but those movies are headed straight for video . And he has not appeared on any of the major stages of Los Angeles . His name will probably never be so well-known as that of Clark Gable , Carole Lombard , Jean Harlow and others at_rest in this very mausoleum . But the Michelangelo program and the other small productions he does for children keep him going while he strives for higher-level acting jobs . He told youngsters of the three months the artist spent in a 33-by-9-foot room where he hid during a time of political oppression and of the drawings he made on the walls during that time . &quot; All I could do to maintain my sanity is to draw , &quot; he said . &quot; I found_out that it is not enough to create art just to sell , it makes me a human being. &quot; The youngest students were starting to stir , but Marz was nearing the end of his presentation . Outside the hall , the next group of students was gathering . Marz will do three shows this day and three more the next . &quot; You all can make art and create . You cannot let anyone take that from you , &quot; he told them . &quot; You must nurture that , feed it , let it blossom like a flower. &quot; The applause was rousing .</TEXT>
