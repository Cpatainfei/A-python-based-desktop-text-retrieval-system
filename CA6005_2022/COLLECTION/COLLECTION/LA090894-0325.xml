   <HEADLINE> LIFE ' S BIG QUESTIONS ; JOSTEIN GAARDER ' S NOVEL EXPLORES THE UNIVERSAL WONDER OF YOUTH . AND A LOT MORE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a boy , author Jostein Gaarder would stare into the clear Norwegian night and ask his father the sort of existential questions that eventually pique the curiosity of most youngsters : What is behind the stars ? What came_before the universe ? How can something be created from nothing ? He plied his mother with more of life ' s riddles : Why do cows have calves and not , say , puppies or kittens ? Or -- and this one really puzzled him -- how is it that when you run to the bus while thinking_of something else , your feet know to keep moving ? Gaarder scarcely remembers his besieged parents ' answers , but that is of little consequence since the questions themselves became the driving force of his life . In university , Gaarder learned that he had been asking many of the same questions Socrates and Plato posed . Then , as a high_school philosophy teacher , he came_to realize just how universal his youthful wonder was . Gaarder sat_down in the spring of 1990 to write a philosophy book for teen-agers . He begged his wife ' s forgiveness in_advance for what he felt would be an important work but certainly not one that would bring fame and fortune to the family . He needn ' t have apologized . &quot; Sophie ' s World : A Novel about the History of Philosophy &quot; has been a phenomenal success , topping bestseller lists in Norway , Sweden , Denmark and , above all , Germany , where it appears in both the youth and adult sections of bookstores and has sold more_than 400 # 000 copies . Gaarder ' s book -- his fourth -- will appear in the United States this month with a first printing of 50 # 000 copies ( Farrar , Straus &amp; Giroux ) . It is being likened to Umberto Eco ' s &quot; The Name of the Rose &quot; for its surprising popularity . Similarly , it has been called philosophy ' s answer to British physicist Stephen Hawking ' s &quot; A Brief History of Time. &quot; &quot; Sophie ' s World &quot; is a history of Western , mainly European , thought , beginning with Nordic mythology and Greek philosophy and running_through Locke and Hume , Kant , Hegel , Marx , Darwin and Freud , all wrapped into a compelling mystery novel whose main character is a 14-year-old Norwegian girl named Sophie . And it all starts with two questions anonymously delivered to Sophie ' s rural mailbox : Who are you ? Where does the world come from ? &quot; The universe is a great mystery , &quot; Gaarder said during an interview . &quot; I am really more interested in_questions than in giving answers . Where did the world come from ? The question has an answer , even though I cannot get_to it . It is a good question . It is like a crime that has not been solved . There is an answer , even if police do not know it. &quot; * Gaarder , 42 , is a wiry man who shares an infectious enthusiasm for his subject with the principal male character of his book . The questions in Sophie ' s mailbox have come from a bearded philosophy teacher who , like Gaarder , battles tirelessly against that worst of all modern ills , indifference . &quot; My concern is that you do not grow_up to be one of those people who take the world for granted , Sophie dear , &quot; the philosophy teacher writes to the girl in one of his early lessons . Gaarder likens a child ' s natural curiosity to a baby ' s innate ability to swim . Parents must throw their offspring into the pool or face years of nose-plugs and swimming lessons , he said metaphorically ; they must push and prod their children ' s natural curiosity . &quot; To wonder about life is not something we learn , it is something we forget , &quot; Gaarder said . For all those teen-agers looking_for their place in the world -- and the world ' s place in the universe -- Sophie ' s Alice-in-Wonderland encounter with philosophy is a good place to begin . Sophie ' s philosophy teacher identifies himself as Alberto Knox . He soon appears in_person , and sometimes in costume , to give engaging lessons in which Knox draws_on Gaarder ' s 10 years of teaching experience to provide concrete examples of complicated philosophical ideas : Lego blocks to illustrate Democritus ' theory of atoms and rose-colored glasses to demonstrate Kant ' s views on perception . At every step , Knox identifies the questions the philosopher is asking -- their project , he calls it -- before delving into their answers . An unlikely ensemble of characters make their appearance in the book -- Plato and Little Red Riding Hood in the same manuscript ? -- and the deeper Sophie dives into philosophy , the more her mother suspects that she must be_on drugs or up_to no good with this older_man . Sophie and Alberto soon begin to suspect that they all are characters in someone else ' s book -- a book within Gaarder ' s book -- and they attempt to escape the author , raising some of the most fundamental questions about God and free_will . * Alternating between coffee and Coca-Cola in the Biblotek Bar of Oslo ' s old Bristol Hotel , Gaarder said that although he is surprised by his book ' s success , he thinks he understands its appeal now . After the fall of communism , whole countries are starting from scratch , looking_to build new societies and a new belief system . They are asking very basic , philosophical questions . &quot; When I was a student in the ' 70s , we didn ' t ask questions . We were hiding behind ideology . The only question was , are you a Marxist or not ? Today people ask existential questions . &quot; When ( former Soviet President Mikhail ) Gorbachev talked_about perestroika and starting everything anew , he said the Western world also needs perestroika and he was right . People have a vague feeling that something is wrong . . . . It is important for them to know our common roots and history . If we don ' t know exactly where we are going , it may be important to know where we are coming from , &quot; he said . Gaarder is not a devotee of a single philosophical school , although he admits that way back when he discovered the German Romantics and the pantheistic approach to philosophy , &quot; they made my heart beat a little quicker. &quot; He said he subscribes_to the Christian morals on which he was raised , but when pushed_on whether he believes Jesus was God , he will answer only that that is a very good question . * Good questions . Gaarder starts from the premise that even teen-age jocks subject_to raging hormones and intense peer pressure eventually sit_back alone at night in a silent room and ask the eternal questions : Who am I ? Why must we die ? The father of sons ages 18 and 10 , he wanted to write a textbook for just such youths . He started_out in a deep , didactic voice -- &quot; Human_beings have always asked existential questions . . . &quot; -- but threw it away when the idea of Sophie came_to him . He made Sophie a girl because as far back as the ancient_Greeks wisdom was a female concept , and because his own experience as a high_school and adult_education teacher was that , in_general , women are more curious , more inquisitive , than men . &quot; For many women , it is very important to try to understand something . For men , it is very important to be understood , &quot; Gaarder said . And girls especially are responding to his book , sending letters by the bagful to say that they had felt alone and alienated , even a little mad , wondering &quot; Who am I ? &quot; but that now they realize that they have been asking philosophical questions as old as humanity itself . Gaarder also hears from adults who say they find that a mystery novel wrapped around philosophical ideas makes an elite subject more accessible . * If Gaarder was compelled to write &quot; Sophie ' s World &quot; by what he perceived to be a teen-age need , he also was pushed into the endeavor by his own slightly obsessive distaste for New Age and Occult &quot; industries. &quot; He describes going_into bookstores with shelf after shelf of the so-called alternative philosophies , but not a single volume of the classics -- a phenomenon he describes as simply perverted . There are no shortcuts to real philosophical insights , he said , and no need for them if one is truly curious . &quot; Suppose I pick_up a newspaper and read that there is intelligent life on another planet and that they live_in cement boxes 18 stories in the sky . I would say OK , but first it must occur to us that New York is such a place . The real_world is the mystery , not whether there are aliens in outer space . I am such an alien , &quot; Gaarder said . Such thinking may go_over well in Germany , land of self-examination , but what about in America ? Will philosophy sell in the instant-gratification capital of the world ? Do Americans care that the roots of their Constitution are in John_Locke ? Gaarder wonders too . He has been to the United States only once and does not know Americans very well . But he is hopeful his book will have an impact on youth everywhere . Noting that the whole prospect of a successful novel on the history of philosophy originally seemed impossible , Gaarder recalls a story about Isaac_Newton , who kept a horseshoe over his door for good_luck . &quot; Do you really believe this brings you luck ? &quot; a friend of Newton ' s is said to have asked . &quot; No , &quot; Newton answered , &quot; but I ' m told it works anyway. &quot;</TEXT>
