   <HEADLINE> THE JUNE 7 PRIMARY_ELECTION ; CITRON ' S POLICY DEFENDED , QUESTIONED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Tustin City Councilman Jeffrey Thomas is playing politics with taxpayer money ( &quot; Tustin Pulls Its Money Out of County Portfolio , &quot; April 14 ) , and the citizens of Tustin deserve to understand why Thomas is acting so fast and loose with their city ' s financial security . Thomas , a member of the campaign fund-raising committee for John Moorlach -- a political candidate who has decided to run against our well-respected County Treasurer , Robert L . Citron , in the upcoming June election -- recently went behind the backs of other Tustin council_members to persuade the city finance director to interfere with the city ' s long-term financial planning and withdraw Tustin ' s $ 4 million in funds from Orange County ' s investment pool . Thomas and Moorlach hoped that this political stunt would get them some much needed press for their fledging political_campaign . But unfortunately , their stunt will cost the hard working taxpayers of Tustin . In fact , during the first eight months of their most recent investment , the city of Tustin had already earned about $ 100 # 000 in interest on the money Citron invested for them in the county pool -- an amount that Tustin Treasurer Ronald A . Nault acknowledged was a respectable return on its investment . It comes as no surprise that Thomas ' allies on the Tustin City_Council were soundly defeated for reelection by two candidates who campaigned on reforming Tustin ' s City_Hall politics . Bob Citron has successfully managed the county ' s taxpayer dollars for over 24 years . He has repeatedly been honored for returning more earnings on Orange County ' s investment dollars than any other local_government treasurer in California . For this reason he has been endorsed for reelection by numerous Republican and Democratic elected officials within the county . I am confident that the voters of Orange County will overwhelmingly reelect Bob Citron to his seventh successful term . The investment of our hard-earned taxpayer dollars is too important to trust to &quot; partisan political_hacks &quot; like Jeffrey Thomas and John Moorlach . ASSEMBLYMAN TOM UMBERG D-Garden Grove * Your article &quot; O.C. Treasury Turmoil Puts Officials on Alert &quot; ( May 5 ) should put the residents of Orange County on alert . Apparently people in the financial world agree with candidate John Moorlach regarding potential problems associated with the present county treasurer making high-risk investments at a questionable time . Isn ' t that the problem which caused the downfall of so many savings and loans ? This could be very dangerous and I appreciate Mr. Moorlach calling it to our attention . No matter who wins the election , let ' s hope this situation will be addressed in a responsible manner . BONNIE O ' NEIL Newport Beach * Your editorial supporting Robert L . Citron for reelection ( May 24 ) missed an important point : that Orange County Republican Chairman Thomas Fuentes has confirmed that Citron is being targeted for defeat , even though the job is supposed to be nonpartisan , because he is a &quot; liberal , partisan Democrat. &quot; Even Republicans should be offended by that kind of reasoning . SUSAN GUILFORD Orange * I am a Republican . I am a conservative Republican . As a Republican I have watched the campaign by John Moorlach for county treasurer against Bob Citron with shame . It appears that we have &quot; partisan politics &quot; at its worst and my party is the guilty one . It exemplifies why too many voters -- and non-voters -- have such disdain for both major parties . We have a county treasurer , Bob Citron , who has a proven skill level , a proven track record and is extraordinarily qualified for the post . In contrast , we have candidate whose qualifications for the post are very arguable , creating a torrent of misinformed press_releases that , while intended to discredit Citron with voters , also discredit our county treasurer ' s office with the money_markets . I won ' t engage here in a debate of the arbitrage techniques that Mr. Moorlach has attacked , except to say the rating services have not felt that the portfolio represents unusual risk . However , it is established fact that Mr. Citron has made well above average returns in good markets and bad markets , with high interest_rates , and low interest_rates . It is inexcusable to create the kind of misinformation Mr. Moorlach and Mr. Chriss Street are creating and then casually dismiss it as a normal campaign tactics . MIKE SHEPARD Santa Ana</TEXT>
