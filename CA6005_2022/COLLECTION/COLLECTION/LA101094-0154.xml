   <HEADLINE> TOBACCO GIANT QUIETLY PUSHES PROP . 188</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a state that has led all others in attempts to snuff_out smoking , the nation ' s largest cigarette maker is taking the bold step of pushing a voter initiative that would make_it easier for smokers to light_up . With its Proposition 188 on the Nov . 8 ballot , tobacco giant Philip Morris USA hopes to become the latest big business to use California ' s initiative process to turn its goals into law . &quot; It is a very difficult , uphill fight , &quot; said Lee Stitzenberger , the Westwood political consultant entrusted by Philip Morris with convincing Californians that smoking policy should be guided by a cigarette manufacturer . Difficult , but not impossible . Improbable as it may seem in California , where fewer than one in five people smoke , Proposition 188 exhibits signs of life . Public_opinion_polls show that the race is close . The tobacco_industry is outspending the vote-no-on-188 forces by a margin of 28 to 1 . The opponents consist primarily of health groups , doctors and anti-smoking activists , who are having a hard_time attracting attention -- essential for countering the strategy employed by Stitzenberger and Philip Morris . &quot; ( Philip Morris ' ) plan is to be low-profile , &quot; said Jack Nicholl , the Los Angeles consultant for the No on 188 campaign . &quot; Don ' t create any controversy . . . then slip_in in the dark of night , with an ignorant electorate . It ' s a smart tactic based on weakness . The weakness is that the sponsorship is not tolerated by the voting public. &quot; Proposition 188 would reverse a decade-long trend in California , returning to restaurants and other businesses the right to permit smoking in ventilated sections . The initiative would erase local smoking bans from Los Angeles to Redding , and prevent cities from regulating tobacco use in the future . The initiative also collides head-on with a bill passed_by the Legislature that would be the nation ' s strongest statewide smoking restrictions . Signed into law by Gov . Pete Wilson earlier this year , the statewide ban will go_into effect in January -- unless Proposition 188 passes , in which case the initiative takes precedence . The legislation signed by Wilson would ban smoking in most indoor workplaces -- restaurants , malls , offices , factories among them . It would prohibit smoking in bars by 1999 , unless the state can develop standards to guard against the ill effects of secondhand smoke . The law also would permit cities to pass even tougher smoking ordinances . Since none of that was considered good for its business , Philip Morris fought_back with the initiative , paying $ 1.8 million to place it on the ballot in a petition drive that brought charges of fraud by anti-smoking forces -- charges at which Stitzenberger scoffs . While other tobacco companies are belatedly joining the effort by donating money , Philip Morris remains Proposition 188 ' s prime backer . &quot; We ' ve got a business interest in ensuring that our customers are treated equitably , &quot; said David Laufer , a Philip Morris executive in Sacramento . Philip Morris is a New York-based conglomerate that makes Marlboro , the world ' s best-selling cigarette , and claims a 40 % -plus share of cigarette sales in the United States . The company emphasized its interest in Proposition 188 in a September letter to its stockholders , declaring that the initiative ' s passage is of &quot; paramount importance to our customers , our employees and you , our stockholders , &quot; and saying it is needed to block the statewide ban from going_into effect . With four weeks to go before the election , Stitzenberger has spent $ 5 million of Philip Morris ' billions . The next-largest donor , R . J . Reynolds , which makes Camel cigarettes , has given $ 1.6 million . Other tobacco companies have given a combined $ 1.25 million . Through the end of September , the Yes on 188 effort had raised $ 7.8 million . A relative handful of restaurant and bar owners and others have given a total of less than $ 2 # 500 . Stitzenberger predicts that the campaign will not cost more_than $ 10 million , but says he has no plans to air high-priced television spots , and may_not go_on radio -- although &quot; that could change. &quot; For now , Stitzenberger plans to run a &quot; cerebral &quot; campaign to &quot; educate &quot; voters . His message is that Proposition 188 is a reasonable compromise between smokers and nonsmokers . He intends to make heavy use of direct mail , the theme of which is that voters should read the initiative . &quot; If people understand what ' s in the initiative , and get_away from all_the hype , they ' ll see it is a fair , balanced , reasonable solution , &quot; he said . &quot; We believe a majority of voters believe_in some measure of business choice. &quot; It ' s not clear , however , that even careful readers of the voting pamphlet would pick_up on some of the nuances in Proposition 188 . The initiative says , for example , that smoking would be permitted in business_establishments that meet ventilation standards . It does not explain the standards , except to say they must be in_accord with &quot; ASHRAE Standard 62-1989 , &quot; a reference -- not explained in the initiative -- to a trade organization in Atlanta called the American Society of Heating , Refrigeration and Air-Condition Engineers Inc. As it happens , the tobacco_industry helped draft the ASHRAE standard and , since 1988 , ASHRAE has received $ 16 # 600 from Philip Morris , executives in the trade group told The Times . Engineer John Janssen , who chaired the committee that wrote the standard in 1989 , said it was designed to spare people from the odors of tobacco smoke and other indoor pollutants , not from ill effects . Additionally , Janssen said in a telephone_interview , the tobacco_industry paid_for at least one committee_member to attend the meetings leading to the standard . A second member had done tobacco-funded research , and pushed tobacco_industry views , Janssen said . &quot; We had gone_to the tobacco_industry and asked them to contribute somebody for the committee , &quot; he said . The No on 188 campaign consists_of health groups such_as the California arms of the American Cancer Society , American Heart Assn . and American Lung Assn . and business groups such_as the California Restaurant Assn . and the California Labor Federation . The Mormon_church also has come_out against the measure . The three health groups have given a combined $ 111 # 000 . The California Medical Assn. , among the largest campaign spenders , has given $ 21 # 000 , and the California Dental Assn . has given $ 31 # 000 toward the defeat of Proposition 188 . Most hospital corporations and health_insurance companies are pledging their political war_chests to defeat other initiatives on the ballot . &quot; I ' m grateful for what ( donors ) have given , but it ' s not enough , &quot; Nicholl said . &quot; They don ' t see it as their top priority . But they ' re going to hate it if they have to live with the results . It will put smoke in their face. &quot; Nicholl said he expects to have less than $ 600 # 000 for the No campaign -- he has raised $ 257 # 000 so far -- a paltry sum in California politics . He hopes to have enough money to air some radio spots in which former Surgeon_General C . Everett Koop blasts the initiative . But with little money , and given Stitzenberger ' s decision to remain low-key , the No on 188 effort is struggling . Trying to draw attention , opponents held a news_conference last week , bringing several public officials to the Alameda County_Courthouse in Oakland . So television crews would have something to videotape , the organizers brought a 10-foot-long &quot; cigarette &quot; stuffed with what looked_like shredded money . The plan was to stomp on it in front of television_cameras . But when only one radio reporter and a camera crew from a Spanish language station showed_up , the initiative ' s foes ended_up saving the &quot; visual &quot; for another day . Assemblyman Terry B . Friedman ( D-Brentwood ) , who authored the now-threatened statewide smoking ban due_to go_into effect in January , is alarmed by the campaign being waged by opponents of Proposition 188 . &quot; Frankly , I haven ' t seen much evidence of the ( No on 188 ) campaign , &quot; he said . &quot; I hope that there is a strategic plan . I ' m not aware if there is one or not . . . . It would be the ultimate irony that this struggle in Sacramento was wiped_out because a special_interest took_advantage of the initiative. &quot; Ironically , part of the Yes on 188 campaign , called Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions , is aimed at nonsmokers . Stitzenberger ' s mailers talk_about the need for statewide tobacco regulation , proclaim that Proposition 188 would create one of the toughest smoking laws in the nation , and tout elements of the initiative aimed at making_it harder for minors to buy cigarettes . If the initiative fails and Friedman ' s smoking ban goes_into effect , California will have overdone it with &quot; de_facto prohibition , &quot; Stitzenberger said . &quot; This is not a burning issue , &quot; he said . &quot; This is not the biggest concern people have in the world . They have a lot of concerns that rank a whole_lot higher than whether there is a separate smoking section. &quot; On the coffee_table in Stitzenberger ' s Westwood office is the book &quot; Thank You for Smoking , &quot; a witty and biting satire of the tobacco_industry . Through much of the book , the main character battles &quot; Health Nazis &quot; and attacks scientific data pointing to the risks of smoking . Stitzenberger hasn ' t read it yet . But he could be one of its characters . He derides Health Nazis , and scoffs at &quot; irrational ravings of the opposition. &quot; He smokes occasional cigars , although he says his wife makes him light_up on the deck , and terms as &quot; garbage &quot; studies showing that tobacco smoke can harm nonsmokers . Stitzenberger and his firm , the Dolphin Group , ran the 1986 campaign that resulted in the unprecedented defeat of California Chief_Justice Rose Bird and two other Supreme Court justices . In that campaign , he and his partners organized a group called Crime Victims for Court Reform , which drew_on mothers and fathers of murdered children who opposed the liberal Bird court . Later , Stitzenberger produced a video of Willie Horton ' s victims . Their descriptions of Horton ' s vicious attacks was a powerful attack on former Massachusetts Gov . Michael Dukakis in his 1988 run_for the presidency . Stitzenberger produced the video as part of an independent effort to aid George_Bush ' s election . Now , the No on 188 campaign hopes to make use of &quot; tobacco victims &quot; to defeat Stitzenberger . He takes umbrage at the description . &quot; I don ' t acknowledge that exists , &quot; he said . &quot; You make choices in your life -- whether you choose to drink or not drink , smoke or not smoke , have wild abandoned sex . . . . We all make judgments in our life. &quot;</TEXT>
