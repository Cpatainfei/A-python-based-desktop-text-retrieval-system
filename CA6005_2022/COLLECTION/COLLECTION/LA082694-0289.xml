   <TEXT> Is the Conjunto Cespedes the best Afro-Cuban orchestra in the United States ? It might be too early in the group ' s career to say for_sure . But if there are any others out there that can match the Conjunto ' s musical power and willingness to take risks , Latin music in the United States is doing just fine . &quot; Una sola casa &quot; ( Only One House ) , the Bay Area-based group ' s 1993 debut album , is an eclectic , vibrant homage to Cuba ' s musical legacy . It ' s all there -- fiery percussion , joyful charangas , son , rumba , religious chants , big-band horn arrangements and even acoustic ballads influenced by the Nueva Trova movement that flourished in the late ' 60s and had a profound impact on Latin_American political songwriters . &quot; The main principle of our music is to say more_than , ' Baby , I like the way you walk ' or ' Let ' s go_to_bed , ' &quot; says the group ' s director Guillermo Cespedes , who will lead the 12-piece ensemble Saturday at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre . &quot; We utilize music as a way to dress poetry. &quot; Their instrumental talent and musical vision aren ' t the only things that distinguish Cespedes and his aunt , Bobi Cespedes , the group ' s singer : They ' re Cubans living_in the United States , but their families came here before Fidel Castro ' s 1959 revolution , and the band members are equally fond of all branches of Cuban music -- traditional , post-revolutionary and made-in-exile . They like such elders as Cachao and Celia Cruz just as much as Nueva Trova artists Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes . that ' s a courageous choice , given the anti-Castro passion of the Cuban exile community . &quot; Even if they claim otherwise , most Cuban musicians in America need to have at least some kind of subtle anti-revolutionary political message in_order to survive , &quot; says Cespedes , 43 . &quot; It ' s an absurd position that doesn ' t do any justice to our rich musical tradition. &quot; Cespedes ' most controversial gesture was creating a musical setting for &quot; Tengo &quot; ( I Have ) , a poem by the late Afro-Cuban poet Nicolas Guillen . The work proclaims that Cuban blacks enjoyed their rights for the first time under Castro , and the song predictably earned the Conjunto a bad reputation in Miami , the center of the mostly white Cuban exile community . Some radio_stations refused to play the group as a result . &quot; Some people thought we were making propaganda , &quot; Cespedes says . &quot; That song closed some doors for us , but we knew that was a risk . Our point is that we don ' t think Cuban music started or ended in 1959 -- it is our duty to acknowledge the whole picture of our music . A Cuban in the States is supposed to divide history , but we refuse to do that. &quot; The first members of the Cespedes family began to emigrate to the States in the mid- ' 50s , and the Conjunto was founded in 1981 by Guillermo , Bobi , Guillermo ' s cousin Miguel and his uncle Luis . After playing in Bay Area clubs for most of the ' 80s and early ' 90s , they were signed by the small , Connecticut-based Green Linnet label . The group has sold more_than 11 # 000 copies of &quot; Una sola casa &quot; with virtually no promotion or national tours , reaching No . 5 on Billboard ' s world music charts . The main attraction of the orchestra -- which includes Cuban , American , Puerto Rican and Chilean musicians -- is Bobi Cespedes , a powerhouse singer who ' s often likened to the young Cruz . Also a Santeria priestess , she is one of the most important discoveries in Afro-Cuban music in the United States . The Conjunto ' s open and flexible musical approach results in plenty of room for the unpredictable . It ' s a new experiment with a music that has long left its own back yard . &quot; Cuban music is no longer Cuban , &quot; says Cespedes . &quot; Everybody has utilized it in different ways throughout the century . Even us , who are Cubans living outside of Cuba , have a distinctive flavor . But the essence is there , and can ' t be described . You can only feel it. &quot; * Conjunto Cespedes , Francisco Aguabella and the Marcos Loya Band will perform Saturday at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre , 2580 Cahuenga Blvd . E . , 4:30 p.m. $ 17 . ( 213 ) 466-1767 .</TEXT>
