   <HEADLINE> 47 SENATORS JOIN FOES OF PLAN TO RAISE ETHANOL USE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Siding with an uncommon alliance of environmentalists and oil_companies against Midwestern corn farmers , almost half the U.S. Senate sent a letter Wednesday to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency urging it to drop a plan to mandate the use of ethanol in cleaner-burning gasoline . Led by Sen . Bill Bradley ( D-N.J. ) , the group of 47 senators said the ethanol requirement would boost the cost of gasoline and unfairly favor one additive over another . Joining in the criticism were Sen . Bennett Johnston ( D-La. ) , chairman of the Senate Energy Committee , and the panel ' s ranking Republican , Sen . Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming . Over the opposition of its staff scientists , the EPA proposed in December that 30 % of the new gasoline , due in Los Angeles and the rest of the nation ' s smoggiest cities in 1995 , include an oxygenating additive made from a renewable source . During the 1992 presidential election , the Bush_Administration first overrode an agreement -- reached in 1991 negotiations that included environmentalists , regulators , the oil and natural_gas companies and the ethanol lobby -- not to mandate a specific fuel . The Clinton_Administration ' s December proposal went even further , virtually assuring ethanol -- primarily made from corn -- a major share of the new market . Support for ethanol is strong in Corn_Belt states . It has been led by the politically potent Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , which produces up_to 70 % of the nation ' s ethanol . But both the oil and natural_gas industry -- which produces methanol , a rival oxygenate -- and many environmentalists have questioned ethanol ' s high cost of production and its volatility , which actually could increase air_pollution . &quot; There are many people in the Congress who know that ethanol is not a panacea for our energy fuel needs in this country , &quot; Richard J . Stegemeier , chairman and chief_executive of Unocal Corp. , said Wednesday . Administration touchiness about the issue was obvious Monday , when Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena retracted much of a detailed letter to Budget Director Leon Panetta that outlined his objections to the ethanol provision . Pena staffers said the letter , in which Pena wrote that he strongly opposed the provision , did not represent his true views and was signed , mistakenly , by an automatic signing device , not Pena himself .
