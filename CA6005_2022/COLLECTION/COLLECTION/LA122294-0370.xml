   <HEADLINE> FROM PLASTIC TO DIAMONDS -- REALIZING AN ALCHEMIST ' S DREAM ; GEMS : A HONG KONG SCIENTIST IS MAKING TINY JEWELS FROM SHOPPING BAGS AND OTHER RECLAIMED JUNK . INVESTORS REMAIN SKEPTICAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The adage that one man ' s trash is another ' s treasure is living truth for a Hong Kong scientist making diamonds from cheap plastic junk , even shopping_bags . In a simple , inexpensive university experiment reviving every alchemist ' s dream of yielding riches from ordinary matter , Professor Hiroyuki Hiraoka is harvesting tiny precious diamonds from ubiquitous plastic , and beginning to capture world attention . Hiraoka admits his diamonds are not quite a girl ' s best_friend , yet . But if he achieves his ambition , he could produce a line of diamond-coated costume jewelry , he said in an interview . So far , the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology professor has not rattled the multimillion-dollar gem trade with his method . &quot; It ' s just not a threat to the diamond industry , &quot; said Thomas Wong , chairman of the Diamond Importers Assn . here . &quot; Those crystals cannot be seen with the naked eye. &quot; Hiraoka and his students are not the first to try to re-create in the lab the gems that nature has spent an eternity forming . For centuries , back yard tinkerers and mining giants with a lot to lose have tried artificially to re-create one of the world ' s strongest substances , so rarely found naturally . But no one has succeeded making the gems as cheaply and easily , says the reserved , Japanese-born professor , who has lectured in the United States on his findings . Hiraoka has patented the simple process in the belief it will one day become commercial . &quot; This technique , nobody is doing_it , &quot; Hiraoka said as he surveyed his amateurish-looking equipment . &quot; Of course we could make jewels. &quot; Plastic is the raw_material used because it is_full of carbon , the only ingredient of a pure diamond . And it is dirt_cheap . The secret is all_in the technique . Hiraoka uses his university ' s bulky , old-fashioned laser machine and other apparently clumsy apparatus to produce the crystals . The laser sends shock_waves through the plastic inside a vacuum_chamber , creating a fireball that sprays out the tiny precious crystals . They fling themselves uniformly onto a specially prepared silicone-coated surface and stick like glue . &quot; As you can see , it ' s a very simple set-up , &quot; says the proud professor , surveying a gleaming diamond deposit several microns thick . The rock-hard , shiny coating looks quite similar to stainless_steel . Though Hong Kong loves diamonds , buying $ 1 billion of polished stones in the first_half of the year , Hiraoka has had trouble getting funding from a corporate sponsor to take the experiment to its next phase . Other synthetic techniques are prohibitively expensive , requiring a cocktail of extremely high_temperatures and expensive graphite , and the result is often patchy and does not stick . Analysts say it is therefore far more cost effective to mine nature for industrial diamonds , which make_up well_over half the haul in any diamond deposit . But plastic is ever-present , and even with outdated equipment the scientist claims his results are better than those of his peers . Hiraoka uses humble plastic shopping_bags and even polystyrene , but plastic glass is his favorite . He buys_it at the department_store . The scientist and his students admit they have not exactly produced the Hope diamond , just a_few experimental , two-dimensional samples .</TEXT>
