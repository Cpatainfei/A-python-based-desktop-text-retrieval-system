   <TEXT> The Presley Cos. : The new-home builder sold $ 200 million of junk_bonds Thursday priced to yield 12.5 % , the company said . The bonds were sold mostly to pension and mutual_funds through Presley Cos. ' underwriter , Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette , a New York investment banking firm . &quot; I think that ' s a very attractive yield , considering today ' s choppy market , &quot; said Amin Arjoman , a real_estate analyst with Beverly Hills junk_bond firm Dabney Resnick Inc. Proceeds from the offering are earmarked for retiring high-interest-rate debt as part of the company ' s capital restructuring plan .
