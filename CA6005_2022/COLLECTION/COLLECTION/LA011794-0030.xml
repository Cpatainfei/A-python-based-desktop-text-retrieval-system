Davidoff , a longtime cigar connoisseur , was widely known as &quot; King of the Cigars. &quot; His philosophy was &quot; smoke less but better. &quot; He said in a newspaper interview in 1991 that for him a good cigar was a &quot; moment of pure dreaming. &quot; He regularly took_on the medical_profession , arguing that good cigars in moderation were not harmful .
