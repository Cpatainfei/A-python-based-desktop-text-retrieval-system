   <HEADLINE> SIMI CHIEF WINDS_UP 1ST 100 DAYS WITH NO RUSH ; POLICE : OFFICIAL TAKES SLOW , THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO JOB . BUT CRITICS SAY HE HAS BEEN ALL TALK , NO ACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By all accounts , new Simi Valley Police_Chief Willard R . Schlieter has spent much of his first 100 days in office doing just what he said he would do : Listening . Studying and planning . Thinking . As chief of police in the safest city of 100 # 000 or more in the United States , the 53-year-old transplant from Urbana , Ill. , has time for reflection -- a luxury that new chiefs at harried departments in crime-ridden cities seldom enjoy . While theirs is a task of moving from one crisis to another , Schlieter ' s is one of fine-tuning an already respected and reasonably smooth-running department , Simi Valley officials and Schlieter ' s own officers say . Yet , privately , some of his officers say Schlieter ( pronounced SHLY-ter ) is taking too_much time to act . They complain of stagnation in his first 100 days , which end Wednesday , and they say they want the chief to take_charge and give them some direction . &quot; From sergeants to lieutenants to secretaries , everybody ' s saying , ' He ' s been here three months , when ' s he going_to do something ? ' &quot; said Sgt . Gary Collins , president of the Simi Valley Police_Officers Assn . &quot; Now that he ' s had a chance to look_at us , what needs to change ? What ' s good ? What ' s bad ? &quot; Collins said . &quot; We ' re still waiting for a general consensus of where we are and where we should be. &quot; In his first three months , Schlieter has been meeting regularly with city officials and union officials , low-level officers and top-level commanders , Collins said . &quot; If talk leads to action , it ' s good , &quot; he said . &quot; But if it doesn ' t , it ' s really frustrating. &quot; Schlieter said he refuses to be rushed into announcing any long-term plans . &quot; I can see they ' re anxious to see something perhaps new and different , &quot; he said recently . &quot; But it ' s premature of me to make that kind of announcement public without making_sure we know where the department is going_in the next three to five years. &quot; The critics do not understand the job of organizing a department of this size , Schlieter said , reminding that he promised to move carefully when he first took_office March 7 . &quot; I never came_in and proposed an instant solution , &quot; he said . &quot; Any manager would be foolish to make rash decisions based on emotions rather than fact. &quot; On his first day at_work , Schlieter faced some hard facts . For one , the department ' s Cochran Street headquarters had been badly damaged by the Northridge earthquake . For another , two lieutenants ' vacancies had been left unfilled amid a festering internal dispute . The Jan . 17 quake sank the building ' s east wing six inches into the ground , broke sprinkler pipes and split interior walls at the seams . The ranks , from patrol officer to captain , were anxious to see the building fixed -- or , better yet , replaced . Schlieter squeezed meetings with architects and city planners in between briefings on his department ' s operations and its history of internal disputes , and pushed plans for a new headquarters onto the front burner . Less than two weeks from now , Schlieter said , the architect will deliver rough floor_plans , including design suggestions from officers of all ranks . Schlieter also has had to clean_up some bad_blood between union_members and management that developed last year during the tenure of his predecessor , Chief Lindsey Paul Miller . Two lieutenants ' positions had been unfilled for months , and a sergeant who was promoted to one of them actually gave_up his lieutenant ' s bars and dropped_back to his old rank . Sources inside the department have said the posts remained open because no one qualified wanted to work that close to Miller . Seeing this , the city advertised the lieutenants ' slots to officers outside Simi Valley , which greatly angered local union officials and led to bickering between them and management . &quot; There were some internal personality issues , &quot; conceded City_Manager Lin Koester . &quot; that ' s water under the bridge . We needed to identify what those issues are . We ' ve identified them and understand them , and Mr. Schlieter is going_to get an understanding of that. &quot; Indeed , Schlieter has already set the promotions back on track and begun shaking_up some command assignments : Later this summer , about a dozen Simi Valley sergeants will test for the two lieutenant slots , and a dozen more officers are already vying for three vacant sergeant jobs , said Capt . Jerry Boyce . And Schlieter said he plans to rotate the existing lieutenants through specialty assignments such_as the Special Enforcement Detail , traffic division and administrative_division . &quot; I ' ve announced to all_the lieutenants that now ' s the time to make known to me the assignments they ' d like , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s important to me to make these changes . We need to get focused_on some issues , and it will help instill a little enthusiasm in people. &quot; After the shake-up , he added : &quot; we ' ll see other movement in the department. &quot; Meanwhile , Schlieter said he also plans to start hammering_out the first comprehensive contract with the Simi Valley Police_Officers Assn. , as he did with union officials while he was chief of the Urbana Police_Department . The Simi Valley union has existed for years on a two-page labor_agreement and a series of rider letters addressing individual work issues . By September , Schlieter said , he hopes to have a memorandum of understanding worked_out with the union . The new chief said he also is studying ways to get his department even more plugged into the computer age . Schlieter said he has requested new laptop_computers that will help detectives in the field save time by banging_out reports that can be transferred instantly to the department ' s mainframe . He also has ordered software that will let police artists work with witnesses to generate quick computer sketches of crime suspects . And he is considering asking_for city funds to install computer terminals in police_cars , as he did_in Urbana . Ideas like these will help the Simi Valley Police_Department keep pace with the future , said Mayor Greg Stratton . &quot; The Police_Department as an entity has got_to recognize it ' s going_to be a new_world , &quot; Stratton said . &quot; From my work ( for a defense_contractor ) , I know what the soldier of the future looks_like and what the technology is capable of doing . . . . And as that technology becomes converted to civilian use , the logical first place for it is the Police Department. &quot; City_Manager Koester said she is happy with Schlieter ' s work . &quot; I plan on reviewing his performance about the first of July , and if things proceed as well as they have for the first three months , there ' ll be a 3 % salary increase ( for him ) . &quot; Schlieter ' s marching orders were to study and modify the department ' s organizational structure , to examine labor relations and to scrutinize everything from policy to police cruisers -- and he has followed orders , Koester said . &quot; I asked him to look_at short-term and long-term plans , and I left it to him to define short- and long-term , &quot; Koester said last week . But all this circumspection has left Schlieter ' s officers hungry for some kind of action , said Collins , the union chief . &quot; The overall feeling is we ' re adrift , but when you try to pin people down as_to what they ' re talking_about , they can ' t put it into words , &quot; he said . The department still suffers from some internal conflicts between some officers and groups of employees , and Schlieter is not making the best use possible of individual officers ' strengths , Collins said . &quot; In the short term , we ' re looking_for him to put a stop to the internal problems and get us focused , &quot; Collins said . &quot; And in the long term , we need him to tell us what the plan is. &quot; Capt . Jerry Boyce , who has served under both Schlieter and Miller , dismissed Collins ' remarks as motivated by union politics , and the complaints from other officers as vague . Far from being idle , Schlieter has been working hard on the earthquake repairs , the new building plans , the openings for lieutenant and the command reassignments , Boyce said . &quot; that ' s some heavy work for someone in their first 100 days that wasn ' t going_to do a whole_lot until he got a handle on things , &quot; Boyce said . &quot; He is_on top of it. &quot; Boyce added : &quot; Gary ( Collins ) really doesn ' t have a substantive complaint . . . . It ' s traditional that the union thinks the union can run the Police_Department better than management can. &quot; Stratton said steering Simi Valley ' s Police_Department toward the 21st Century is not a rush job . &quot; that ' s the great fuzzy question of what is the police_officer of the future going to be , &quot; Stratton said . &quot; Reorganization is what you do when you have a problem , and I don ' t think he ' s taken_over a department with a problem . It may_not be optimally structured for the next century , but I ' d rather he take his time and restructure it. &quot; Schlieter said that while he is making command decisions daily , he is still getting his bearings for the long_haul . &quot; I ' ve had some periods of downtime , and I ' ve had a lot of meetings , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s mostly self-imposed ( downtime ) , and then I ' ve had time to pull_back and look inside myself and figure_out where I ' m going. &quot;</TEXT>
