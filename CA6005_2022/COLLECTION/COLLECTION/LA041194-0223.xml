   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE ; PARANOIA YOUR PASSWORD ? OK , BUT DON ' T TELL ANYONE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Computer consultant Peter Wayner changes his Internet password every week in_order to foil hackers , and he hopes to send his electronic_mail encrypted so prying eyes see only jabberwocky . Is the fellow paranoid ? Not really . If you use a computer mainly to write relatives and catalogue your compact_disc collection , and you never run any software that didn ' t come shrink-wrapped off the shelf , security isn ' t your big worry . For most of the rest of the world , however , computer security is a pressingconcern . Mainframes and networks are fat targets for hackers , office PCs are subject_to unauthorized use , and viruses can infect home computers through innocent-seeming shareware . Wayner , for instance , knows that when he sends electronic_mail from Baltimore to a client in Montreal , it may pass_through 24 computer_systems before it arrives , as easy to read the entire way as the message on the back of a postcard . He ' d like to send his messages scrambled by an encryption program , but the odds are no one on the receiving end could decode them . The irony is that , for most computer users , data protection is relatively easy , yet few take the steps needed to establish even rudimentary computer security . For example , an increasing number of computer_programs come_with built-indata security measures , including the new Macintosh System 7 operating system , Windows NT and Novell ' s Netware . Popular corporate e-mail programs , such_as cc : Mail , and widely used system utilities , such_as PCTools , will let anyone encrypt a computer_file so thoroughly that only the National Security Agency could crack the code without the key . &quot; This isn ' t important for letters to Mom , &quot; Wayner said , &quot; but I think it isincreasingly essential in business . Corporate espionage is a very real problem , and many of the opponents are well-financed , technically adept and among the best at surveillance in the world. &quot; This comes as no surprise to the operators of networks that are major targets of industrial espionage . These administrators , some of whom fend_off dozens of anonymous probes a day , probably keep the telephone_number of the federal Computer Emergency Response Team programmed into their digital cellular_phones and have the loose-leaf edition of the Disaster Recovery Yellow Pages on the bedside table , open_to the section on &quot; Trauma Counseling. &quot; Alarmed by the number of reported computer break-ins , they may have already ordered &quot; smart &quot; password cards for their employees . These credit card-size devices are synchronized to the computer and automatically generate new system passwords every few minutes . Even if someone intercepted a password -- as happened to tens of thousands of Internet users recently when their secret sign-ons were intercepted by illicit &quot; sniffer &quot; programs -- the password is quickly out of date . Boston University is issuing such password cards to its 2 # 000 system users at a cost for each of about a nickel a day . Even when people do fret about system security , the necessary precautions seem like just so_much more of that extra work computers generate to make life more complicated , rather than simpler . John Toon , a public affairs manager at the Georgia Institute of Technology , for example , remembers to regularly scan his computer_files with anti-virus software , and he has configured his office system so that only an authorized few can upload files or access the most sensitive files . He knows he should be changing system passwords more often than he does . Frankly , he says , it takes too long because of all_the automated log-in scripts that have to be reconfigured . But these days , a little useful paranoia can go_a_long_way . While not everyone needs an automated security_guard , there are some relatively painless precautions that a sensible computer user should consider . * Passwords : Use a mixture of letters and numbers , and don ' t write it down . Don ' t use a word that can be found in the dictionary . Use a different password for every different telecommunications account or bulletin_board you access . Change it as often as you can stand . Don ' t ever share it . This is especially important for small systems equipped with remote-access programs , such_as PCAnywhere or Carbon_Copy . * Encryption : Consider using the built-in encryption features of programs like PCTools , Norton Utilities or , on a network , Lotus Notes . Some of these programs will also &quot; shred &quot; files you wish to delete , so they can ' t be recovered . Even compressing files with Pkzip or another archiving program offers some basic protection . For more sophisticated users , AT &amp; T ' s SecretAgent offers a range of file security and encryption features elaborate enough to satisfy anyone . * Screen_savers : If you use a personal_computer in an office , install a password-protected screen_saver so that your system will hide your work and lock itself if you step away from your desk for more_than a_few minutes . Install a floppy drive lock , so no one can bypass hard_drive security to boot your system . Better yet , use a program like Norton Disklock , which prevents unauthorized users from getting access to your computer ' s hard_drive . * Backups : Since hard_drives sooner or later crash , backing_up data is crucial , but it also helps with security . If your computer is stolen , if it goes_up in flames , or if important files are corrupted as the result of mischief or malfunction , you can restore them . * Digital signatures : Electronic mail is easily forged . Tampering with electronic documents takes no special skill and leaves no trace . RSA Data Security Inc. in Redwood City recently announced that it would start giving_away on the Internet a program called RIPEM / SIG as a free tool to authenticate information and to verify who sent an electronic expense_account , document or sales form by appending an unforgeable electronic signature . To get_it , send e-mail to rsaref.rsa.com. * Computers and faxing : Don ' t forget what happens to your computer data when you fax it . AT &amp; T makes a product called Data Fax , which reduces any computer_file , picture , spreadsheet or data base to an encrypted pattern of variegated black_and_white squares that resembles the static snow on a television screen . The recipient would scan the page into his computer , which would translate the markings back into the presumably intelligible original . Perhaps the most effective way to protect a computer_system from outside interference is to disconnect the phone_line and lock the door . that ' s easier said than done for systems connected to the Internet , a network of networks in which each system relies to some extent on the others . Since the National Science Foundation lifted restrictions on commercial use of the Internet two years ago , it has grown to encompass 25 # 000 interconnected networks in 61 countries , with more_than 2.5 million computer_systems and millions of users tied together in a fragile web of trust . &quot; It is a party_line all_over the world , &quot; said William R . Cheswick , a computer security expert at AT &amp; T ' s Bell Laboratories . &quot; Anyone can get_on , and you need some protection. &quot; It would be hard to find a company more worried about communications security than AT &amp; T . On the average , someone tries to break_into the research network at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill , N.J. , 70 times a day . Defending the entire system has given Cheswick such a security workout that he has written a comprehensive manual ( with colleague Steven M . Bellovin ) called &quot; Firewalls and Internet Security : Repelling the Wily Hacker. &quot; It will be published next month by Addison-Wesley Publishing Co . &quot; You certainly don ' t want people on the Internet watching what ' s going_on in your business , &quot; he said . &quot; I know of companies that have decided not to connect because of that possibility of electronic break-ins. &quot; The biggest business security problems , however , are not caused by outsiders trying to break_in but by insiders poking around where they don ' t belong . A 1993 Ernst &amp; Young survey of corporate information officers found that they were far more worried about security breaches caused by their own people than about any wily hacker . &quot; Companies cooperating on a joint project need to share data and share access to their systems , but they don ' t want to give a potential competitor any more access than necessary , &quot; Cheswick said . &quot; We want to have firm assurances that they are stuck_in one directory and can ' t get out. &quot;</TEXT>
