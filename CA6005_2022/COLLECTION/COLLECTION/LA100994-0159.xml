   <TEXT> When the Hollywood-Western building was completed in 1928 , movie_star Norma Shearer opened it with a golden key . Today , the young vagrants who live there don ' t need any keys -- the back_door is wide open and admits anyone brave enough to enter . In these offices , early movie moguls made big decisions on censorship , antitrust_laws and trade_unions . Now squatters use the rooms as crash pads , slumbering amid ripped sofas , crumbled plaster and dried puddles of blood . The 66-year-old building -- Los Angeles historic-cultural monument No . 336 -- is rotting inside and out , a victim of the January earthquake and years of apathy and neglect . Preservationists worry that the red-tagged architectural jewel , an Art Deco landmark on the southwest corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue , will soon fall_through the bureaucratic cracks and face the wrecking ball -- if one of its illegal inhabitants doesn ' t set fire to the place first . Numerous earthquake-damaged historic buildings in Hollywood face a similar plight . These include the Egyptian Theater , the Hillview Apartments and the Henry Fonda Theater . The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission reports that about a fourth of the city ' s 596 historic-cultural monuments were damaged in the quake . Such buildings represent prime examples of a certain architectural_style , were designed by a prominent architect or played an important role in Los Angeles history . The commission ' s figures are not broken_down by neighborhood , but it is believed the damage was extensive in Hollywood . The short_list of Hollywood ' s ' 20s and ' 30s buildings seems to get shorter every year because of demolitions , fires and natural disasters . The fate of what is left depends_on a handful of Los Angeles agencies and scattered preservation groups that often have proved powerless to save old or damaged sites . Just this year , preservationists lost bitter battles to save the Brown Derby on Vine Street -- a universal symbol of old Hollywood that was battered by fires , vandals and finally the powerful Northridge temblor -- and the Hastings Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard . Tourists seeking a bit of Tinseltown glamour have found many vacant_lots and orphaned buildings . The locals know better . They say parts of central and east Hollywood have been deteriorating into a slum for 30 years . Preservationists blame absent-minded city officials for allowing the decay . City officials blame neglectful property_owners . Property_owners blame government_agencies and the bad economy . &quot; The biggest threats to historic buildings are neglected or deferred maintenance , &quot; said Tim Brandt , project architect for Historic Resources Group , a private consulting_company . &quot; But there ' s also a certain lack of respect for the past . There just isn ' t the mind-set for the preservation of old buildings ( in Los Angeles ) that there is back East. &quot; In Hollywood , such buildings have gotten little respect . Take the Egyptian Theater , which at 72 is several years older than the celebrated Mann ' s Chinese Theater just to the west on Hollywood Boulevard . Film showings ceased at the Egyptian several years ago , shortly before the Community Redevelopment Agency bought the run-down property from United Artists . American Cinematheque , a film-preservation organization , has proposed taking_over the building to show classic films , but that plan was stalled after the earthquake left the Egyptian looking_like an ancient ruin . Fragile hollow-clay tiles -- the 1920s precursor to cinder_blocks -- collapsed in the south and east walls , exposing the interior to sun and rain . Then vandals stripped the theater of whatever they could sell on the street . The redevelopment agency has estimated the earthquake damage to the Egyptian at more_than $ 5 million . that ' s about three times as much as the agency paid_for the building in 1992 . ( It can be more expensive to repair such a building than to buy it. ) Officials now hope that insurers and the federal_government will pay_for repairs so the American Cinematheque plan can proceed , but the building ' s fate remains uncertain . The Hillview Apartments , a pink stucco structure that once provided temporary housing for silent_movie stars , is now the only residential building in the Hollywood historic district . It was heavily damaged in the January earthquake and by street sinkage in August related to Metro Rail subway construction . City officials say repair efforts have been stalled by disputes between the Hillview landlords and the remaining tenants , who are fighting eviction from the building . The Henry Fonda Theater -- a 68-year-old movie_house formerly called The Pix -- had often been dark even before it was damaged by the quake . The theater is operated by the Nederlander company , whose officials say they hope to renovate the structure by early 1995 . Still , the most attention-grabbing blighted property is the Hollywood-Western , at one time one of the most important buildings in the movie_industry . City officials declared the site a cultural-historic monument six years ago , but that won ' t necessarily save the building from demolition . Louis B . Mayer , the second M in MGM , and his &quot; boy_wonder &quot; production executive , Irving Thalberg , originally built it in 1928 to house two movie organizations , the Assn . of Motion_Picture Producers and the Central Casting Bureau . The first was a powerful trade association that governed the general policies of studios during Hollywood ' s golden era , including the infamous Production Code that limited directors ' discretion in depicting sex on the screen . Central Casting was formed in 1925 to place extras and other day workers in film jobs . During the ' 30s and ' 40s , studio brass frequented the Hollywood-Western , particularly the west wing of the fourth floor , which housed the offices of the trade association and its imperious czar , Will Hays . The Hays Office , as it came_to be known , did a lot more_than keep movies free_of nudity and naughty words . The group battled a federal antitrust suit against movie companies and played a game of chicken with various trade_unions during tense labor standoffs before finally moving to another Hollywood site in 1950 . The four-story building originally had 60 offices and 10 stores , including a billiard_hall in the basement . But its most distinctive_feature was , and still is , a series of seminude friezes on the fire_escapes , which showed Greek gods and goddesses cavorting with movie_cameras and megaphones . ( This was architect S . Charles Lee ' s inside joke aimed at the puritanical Production Code . A couple of years before his death in 1990 , Lee quipped that his &quot; was the first porno work in Hollywood. &quot; ) The decline of the Hollywood-Western mirrors the slide of the surrounding neighborhood , which has been hit hard by poverty and the 1992 riots . At one time the building ' s upper floors were rented_out for rock-band rehearsals . The ground_floor has for years housed a bargain shop selling cheap trinkets . In recent years , the building has been known as the home of Hollywood Billiards , a 22-table basement pool parlor &quot; open 10 a.m. to God Knows When. &quot; By the mid-1980s , the hangout was attracting celebrities while the rest of the building went_to seed . Many tenants moved_out and squatters began breaking_in as the neighborhood declined . The people who live there now don ' t spend much time admiring the architectural details . Graffiti adorns interior walls , boarded-up doors and windows , and the gray stone facade . &quot; I Been Dirt But I Don ' t Care , &quot; reads a typical message scrawled in a stairwell . &quot; This is Mr. and Mrs . Bill ' s love nest , &quot; smiled Corina Manderley , a 17-year-old self-described entertainer and poet who was roused from her loft bed in the Hollywood-Western one recent morning . Her squalid , closet-sized room on the second floor was carpeted with wadded-up clothes , garbage and junk . &quot; I ' ve been living here just about a month , &quot; said Manderley , a pale , skinny girl with a penchant for funky clothes like stocking caps . &quot; My ( boyfriend Bill ) has been living here for years . Ever since the building was opened ( by squatters ) after the earthquake , he made_it OK for the rest of us to be here. &quot; At least a dozen people stumbled out of various rooms in the darkened building as a group of journalists and activists toured the site . Among them was Manderley ' s boyfriend , Bill , a rail-thin 32-year-old who screamed curses at reporters and ordered them to leave . As one of East Hollywood ' s best-known &quot; squats , &quot; the historic building has become a haunted , frightful place , governed by the law of the streets . For a trip down the hall , squatters arm themselves with baseball_bats and crowbars . One night not too long ago , the squatters said , a girl coming_up the stairs failed to identify herself properly and was savagely beaten . A trail of dried blood led from the landing to the downstairs lobby , where it ended in a sickening red smear . Nearby , a brass-plated elevator sat moldering at the bottom of a pitch-black shaft , its cables long ago plundered . &quot; If your mother was dying , would you just leave her lying there ? &quot; asked Doug Carlton , a community activist who has been leading a fight to rid the Hollywood-Western of the squatters , whom he considers drug_addicts and dealers . &quot; Well , Hollywood ' s mother is dying , and no one seems to care. &quot; The January quake may have sealed the building ' s doom . Virtually all remaining paying tenants had to vacate the red-tagged site . Now the owner says she doesn ' t have enough money to repair the building . &quot; ( Squatters ) are ruining the building , &quot; said Charlotte Reed , who since 1979 has owned the Hollywood-Western with her sister , Natalie Robin . Reed complained that she had been turned_down for a Small Business Administration emergency loan and has fallen_behind on her mortgage payments because of the earthquake damage . &quot; We want them all out or we ' re not going_to have a building to save , &quot; Reed said . If the building isn ' t repaired soon , city officials say they could pursue several options . One would be to seize it through eminent_domain , a legal precept that gives government the right to take_over private_property for public use . Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg and developers have expressed interest in turning the building into a low-income community housing site . If that doesn ' t work , officials say , another scenario would be to have the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety declare the structure an imminent hazard and raze it . But preservationists say that would just be more business as usual in Hollywood . &quot; I ' ve lived_in Hollywood all my life , but I don ' t know if I even want to work here anymore , &quot; said Greg Williams , a board_member of the preservation group Hollywood Heritage and co-owner of a puppet studio at Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street . &quot; Hollywood still wants to be the glamour capital of the world , and it isn ' t . . . . The whole place is falling apart. &quot;</TEXT>
