   <HEADLINE> ' SHORT PAY ' REQUESTS RISE IN SLACK HOUSING MARKET ; REAL_ESTATE : MANY OWNERS ASK TO CLOSE_OUT MORTGAGES BY PAYING LESS THAN IS OWED . LENDERS USUALLY SAY NO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Earlier this year John Knott made what he considered &quot; an incredibly reasonable proposal &quot; to the mortgage lenders on his West Los Angeles home . Desperate to move his family to Nevada after the Jan . 17 earthquake , Knott was trapped in a house that was worth less than 75 % of what he had paid_for it in 1991 and well below what was still owed on two mortgages . His solution : ask his lenders to share the loss by accepting less than they were owed to close_out the mortgages . By his computations they would suffer a combined loss of about $ 75 # 000 -- but he would shoulder a personal loss of more_than $ 70 # 000 in equity and cash on the sale . Since California law would make_it nearly impossible for the lenders to attach any of Knott ' s personal_property to cover the mortgage shortfall , he thought they would leap at the chance to avoid the even greater losses they would incur by foreclosing . But both lenders rejected the deal . The finance_company holding his first_mortgage , Knott recalls , &quot; said the only solution acceptable to them was foreclosure. &quot; Knott ' s experience illustrates a bitter new reality of the Southern California real_estate market . With thousands of homes now worth far less than their mortgage balances because of a four-year fall_in housing values , homeowners are trying to persuade their lenders to share their losses in what has traditionally been the largest and most secure investment any American makes in a lifetime . Nothing today illustrates the fall of the Southern California housing market as vividly as this issue . It has focused attention on a term that was never before an important part of the vocabulary of residential real_estate here : the &quot; short pay , &quot; in which a lender agrees to accept less than the outstanding balance to settle a mortgage loan when a home is sold . Many real_estate_agents now specialize in negotiating short pays . Banks and other lenders have set_up special offices to field the requests and have re-examined their guidelines in an attempt to better balance the pros and cons of accepting such deals rather than foreclosing -- an option that usually leaves lenders with larger losses than would granting homeowners relief . Once the beneficiaries of California ' s inflating housing market , lenders now find themselves in the discomfiting position of asking home sellers to write a check to unload property that would have sold at a fat profit five years ago . The scale of the problem is hard to gauge because most of the negotiations are played_out behind closed doors , in intense but secret talks between seller and lender . Most homeowners who have successfully negotiated short pays find the experience so painful and demeaning that they are loath to talk_about it . For all that , it is clear that most applicants come_away disappointed . Bankers and realtors alike say short payoffs tend to be accepted only when irrefutable and unavoidable hardships make carrying the mortgage nearly impossible . These include unemployment , business reverses and unexpected medical_bills . In cases of self-imposed difficulties or mere convenience -- Knott , for instance , was not unemployed -- banks will still foreclose rather than let homeowners walk away free and clear . Many homeowners believe that California law allows them to virtually walk away without consequences from a home whose sale won ' t cover the outstanding mortgage . It is true that under state law the original loan used to buy a home is &quot; non-recourse &quot; -- that is , the lender cannot normally attach the borrower ' s personal assets to cover the deficiency . Homeowners generally lose that protection , however , for all subsequent loans on the property , such_as second and third mortgages and refinances of the original loan . Moreover , even protected borrowers can be penalized in other ways for failing to pay a mortgage in full . Foreclosure , a lender ' s ultimate remedy against the holder of an original mortgage , is a black mark on a homeowner ' s financial history that can hamper or prevent the homeowner from getting credit for as long as seven years . &quot; I have to educate my clients nonstop , &quot; says Michael Lebecki , a real_estate_agent in the Santa Clarita Valley who says as_many as half his clients are now seeking such arrangements . &quot; So many people think they have no responsibility , &quot; he says . &quot; But people who get short pay agreements from their banks are those with $ 1 # 500 left in an account to eat with , and that ' s it . If you ' re angry because your payments are too high , or you can ' t refinance ( because the home ' s value has fallen below the loan balance ) , or you can ' t go_to a new job , the banks say : ' We ' re not interested , ' and they ' ll foreclose. &quot; In the last three or four years untold thousands of homeowners in the region have been hit by the double whammy of falling home values and high unemployment . Los Angeles County lost an estimated 530 # 000 jobs between July , 1990 , and the end of 1993 , while Orange County lost 195 # 000 jobs , state employment officials estimate . Meanwhile , the collapse in home prices has made_it difficult or impossible for some people to leave the area in search of better jobs without losing most or all_of the equity in their homes or exposing themselves to foreclosure . &quot; During my lifetime we ' ve never had a period ( in California ) when prices went_down 30 to 40 % , when you have people begging for this kind of relief and you also have high unemployment , so they can ' t ride it out , &quot; says Steven Gourley , a real_estate lawyer in Culver City . The number of Southland homeowners whose home values are lower than their outstanding mortgage balances is hard to calculate . But with prices in Southern California having dropped from their 1990 peak by more_than 30 % in many areas ( and by 50 % or more in some high-priced communities ) , brokers and bankers estimate that the figure may be in the hundreds of thousands . Lenders agree that the demand to work_out problem loans with strapped and trapped homeowners has mushroomed . &quot; A few years ago this just wasn ' t an issue , &quot; says Sandra Stewart , president and chief operating officer of Home Savings of America ' s loan service center . &quot; Home values were appreciating and if a person got_into trouble he could just sell the house. &quot; Adds Dorothy Kviberg , a First Interstate Bank vice_president and manager of its mortgage arm : &quot; One year ago , we ' d have one or two requests a month &quot; for mortgage-term modifications , short payouts , or agreements to allow a homeowner to turn_over the property deed in settlement . &quot; A few weeks ago we had 96 calls_in one week. &quot; The bank officer who once handled such requests by herself on an occasional basis now does_it full time , with one assistant . Notices of default recorded against houses and condominiums in Los Angeles , Orange , San Diego , and Ventura counties rose to a monthly peak of 6 # 150 this past March from 5 # 548 a year earlier and 4 # 432 in March , 1992 , according to Dataquick Information_Systems , a La Jolla-based real_estate information service . In January , 1992 , the first month for which Dataquick has figures , the number was 3 # 237 . Those figures probably understate the trend of mortgage delinquencies in the region , according to John Karevoll , Dataquick ' s financial editor . Lenders are allowing borrowers to fall further behind in their payments -- in some cases by six or eight months -- before starting the foreclosure process . &quot; Three years ago if a homeowner fell behind , a notice of default would be filed one month later , &quot; Karevoll says . Lenders generally regard foreclosure as a last_resort because most would prefer to avoid adding new properties to portfolios already bursting with overvalued homes , condos and office_buildings . &quot; We don ' t want to go_into the business of owning these homes , &quot; says Home Savings ' Stewart . Moreover , foreclosure is a costly and time-consuming process , taking at least three to four months . What the lender gets_at the end of that period is less than a prize : a vacant property that must be maintained and secured until sold . In most cases the final return is thousands of dollars less than the bank might have received in a negotiated short_sale . Bankers acknowledge that foreclosing rather than negotiating a short payoff looks_like a money-losing policy in the short term . But they argue that maintaining the sanctity of the contract will protect them from bigger losses over time . For one thing , they fear that overly liberal short-sale policies would open the gates to thousands of customers hoping to walk away from housing investments gone sour . &quot; It ' s necessary to recognize there ' s a problem , &quot; says Bud Schmidtbauer , regional vice_president for quality_control and operations for the Federal National Mortgage Assn. , the government-sponsored mortgage company commonly known as Fannie Mae . &quot; But no lender wants to ignite a wholesale write-down . In cases where the borrower has a job but he ' s incurring a loss of_value in his housing investment , we ' re not out_to hold people harmless from loss in the market. &quot; This aversion to making things too easy is what keeps many lenders from accepting deals that look_like rational compromises to homeowners . &quot; I thought if we could get the house on the market sooner rather than later it would be better for everyone , &quot; John Knott says of his stillborn plan to pay_off his lenders . Among other things , he offered to continue paying down the mortgages and covering taxes on the earthquake-damaged house until it could be sold . He would consider turning_over an expected insurance payment of $ 50 # 000 to $ 60 # 000 to reduce the shortfalls . &quot; I ' d be losing every cent I ' d invested in the house , &quot; he says , &quot; and some more. &quot; As it happens , changes in the home-mortgage market over the last 20 years -- including the role played by agencies such_as Fannie Mae itself -- have made_it more difficult than ever before to work_out problem loans . Today , once a bank approves and funds a mortgage , it often sells the loan to investors , often through Fannie Mae or other intermediaries . ( Fannie Mae will buy and package loans up_to $ 203 # 500 and covering_up to 95 % of the appraised value of a home. ) The originating bank pockets a fee for servicing the loan -- collecting monthly payments , keeping records and pursuing delinquencies . But before it can reach agreement with a strapped borrower it must get approval from the loan ' s owner , which may be another bank , an investment house , Fannie Mae , or even an individual investor . Consequently , homeowners often find themselves negotiating with bankers who have no vested_interest in coming_to a mutually satisfactory deal . Banking professionals say investors who bought mortgages in the secondary market are much more rigid about rejecting short-pay agreements than are banks negotiating over a loan in their own portfolios . Despite all that , brokers say short_sales can be negotiated in many cases -- but they are far from routine transactions . &quot; The process is very grueling , &quot; says Zizi Pak , a realtor at Prudential Rodeo Realty in Beverly Hills who has made short_sales something of a specialty . &quot; It takes a lot of hard work and a lot of experience . It ' s not just a case of sending_in the paperwork and saying OK. &quot; Borrowers and brokers who have gone_through the system say there is little point in even beginning the process as long as one ' s mortgage payments are current . Warren Griffin , a Beverly Hills homeowner who completed a short_sale , says he first had to stop paying his mortgage and go_into default &quot; because otherwise ( the lender ) would n ' t even pay_attention to me. &quot; Griffin ' s case also shows that the size of the shortfall often has very little to do with a lender ' s pliability . The sale of his house was likely to leave his mortgage banker $ 200 # 000 short . It is the degree of hardship that is the key factor_in whether a bank will accept a short pay , brokers say . &quot; The amount has very little to do with it , &quot; Lebecki says . &quot; I ' ve had banks be as difficult over $ 5 # 000 as $ 50 # 000. &quot; Griffin , who is identified here by a pseudonym because he asked that his real name not be used , was facing a critical hardship . He showed his bank that the income from his construction company had dwindled to practically nothing by February , 1993 , when he realized he could no longer afford to make the payments on the house . By the time he found a buyer and closed the deal in October , the sale price was less than half what he paid_for the property in 1989 . Nevertheless , persuading the lender to accept the short pay still required nearly 10 months of negotiation , according to Pak , Griffin ' s realtor . Lenders confronted with short-pay requests sometimes ask_for more documentation than they did for the original loan : As much as three years ' tax_returns ( and permission to retrieve the originals from the Internal Revenue Service ) , pay stubs , business records in the case of self-employed applicants , and detailed information about personal assets . Increasingly , lenders also revisit the original loan_application , looking_for signs that a borrower misrepresented his or her finances at the time . Even though they may have no legal recourse against a borrower ' s personal assets , banks are likely to insist that the applicant commit his holdings to satisfying as much of the shortfall as possible . &quot; If you have stocks and bonds , &quot; Pak says , &quot; they figure , why should they take a short pay ? &quot; One San Fernando Valley homeowner represented by Gourley was refused a short pay even though he was paying mortgages on two homes . One was a Manhattan Beach_house he bought and moved his family to before selling his original home_in Canoga Park . He could not afford to make payments on both , but the lender on the Canoga Park house decided to foreclose rather than accept a $ 25 # 000 shortfall . &quot; The bank said it ' s a hardship , but a self-imposed hardship , &quot; said the homeowner , who asked to remain unidentified . One of Pak ' s clients lost his bid to avert foreclosure because his lender noticed that he had changed professions , opening a retail tile shop after losing the job as a research scientist that he had when he obtained the loan . The store was not producing enough income to cover the mortgage payments . &quot; They asked why he didn ' t stay in his specialty , &quot; she recalls . &quot; I said he couldn ' t find a job in it , but they said he shouldn ' t have opened a store . So they foreclosed and lost $ 100 # 000 . It was asinine. &quot;</TEXT>
