   <TEXT> Last year , when supervisors indicated that they would vote against the proposed Weldon dump , Waste Management Inc. , quickly withdrew its application for the project . Now Taconic Resources , a company whose murky relationship to Waste Management is suspicious to say the least , has suddenly emerged with an initiative designed to bypass county decision-makers and site a dump at Weldon Canyon after all . This new effort to get_around county government is being fronted by the green-sounding Ventura Citizens for Environmental Solutions . We imagine the Out-of-County Corp . for Dangerous but Lucrative Dumps somehow seemed a less appealing name to Taconic / Waste Management . But that name really describes what ' s going_on here . These folks aren ' t using their vast resources to help Ventura with a waste problem . Instead , they ' re looking_to cash_in big_time . The proposed &quot; solution &quot; to waste disposal just so happens to allow construction of a huge cash_cow that could operate around the clock for the next three generations . The fact that Ventura County ' s waste stream must be reduced as mandated by AB 939 won ' t make a dent in the dump operator ' s bottom-line profits . They can simply import trash and then become the Ventura Citizens for Solutions to L.A. ' s Garbage Problems . While all_of this has brought_back the debate over dumps , our position on these matters remains the same : Dumps represent a dangerous , backward answer and must be rejected . A year ago the coalition called_for the closing of the Bailard dump for all_the reasons that we believe Weldon should never open . Dumps degrade the environment . Dumps bring serious and unnecessary health dangers . Dumps are economically low yield . They do not treat refuse as an exploitable commodity and hence waste profit and job potentials for the host communities while simultaneously consuming valuable air credits needed for future development . We must realize that in waste disposal we stand at a moment of historic change . The growing array of new methods and technologies that are coming_on line give us the ability to avoid the environmental and health negatives of dumping and , at_the_same_time , allow a fuller economic exploitation of the waste stream through recycling . The proposed initiative fails to recognize this new direction and would commit our county to a tragic , stone-age solution for at least three generations to come .
