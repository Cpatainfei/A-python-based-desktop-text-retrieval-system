   <HEADLINE> BOND ISSUE PLAN DRAWS CRITICISM FROM ACTIVISTS ; POLITICS : IN EFFORT TO COMPLY WITH MANDATE TO MAKE CITY MORE ACCESSIBLE TO DISABLED , LONG_BEACH WILL PLACE THE MEASURE ON THE BALLOT . FOES CALL IT A DELAYING TACTIC .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Long_Beach City_Council , struggling to comply with a federal mandate to make the city more accessible for the disabled , has decided to place a $ 48-million bond issue on the November ballot to raise money for the improvements . The unanimous council vote last week drew criticism from disabled-rights activists who described the bond issue as a delaying tactic because it stands little chance of being approved . City officials &quot; are buying_time so they can elude the tough budget-cutting choices , &quot; said Marilyn Tradewell , whose son Robbie has used a wheelchair since an auto accident left him partially paralyzed five years ago . &quot; It allows them to hide behind the legal protection that they ' re acting in good faith. &quot; Some council_members acknowledged that the bond measure , which needs a two-thirds ' vote to pass , may face tough odds at the ballot_box . In an effort to improve the measure ' s chances , the council voted Tuesday to delay a separate $ 95-million bond issue to finance a new police_headquarters and other public safety projects . However , council_members said , the city must show some good-faith effort to begin the work by January , 1995 , under the federal Americans With Disabilities Act . &quot; While I ' m not totally happy about putting this on the ballot , I just don ' t see any alternative , &quot; said Councilman Thomas J . Clark at the council meeting . &quot; The money just isn ' t there. &quot; Councilwoman Doris Topsy-Elvord said she was skeptical that the measure would obtain the required approval of two-thirds of the voters . Councilman Jeffrey A . Kellogg said he thought it was the best the city could do &quot; in an extremely difficult situation. &quot; The ADA , as the sweeping law is known , requires that all city facilities , bus_stops , streets and sidewalks be made accessible to disabled people by 1995 . In Long_Beach , that will mean spending an estimated $ 12.6 million to upgrade 224 public facilities , including the Queen Mary and the Convention Center ; about $ 26.7 million for curb ramps at about 4 # 500 intersections , and about $ 4.4 million to upgrade more_than 2 # 100 bus_stops , said Dolores Barrows , the city ' s ADA compliance officer . The remaining funds from the bond measure would cover related expenses , she said . &quot; Even though we won ' t be in compliance ( by 1995 ) , we have to have something in place , &quot; Barrows said . &quot; The bottom_line is that this is a federal law , and cities have no choice. &quot; After Jan . 26 , 1995 , Long_Beach could face fines of up_to $ 50 # 000 for each instance where a structure or public walkway is not accessible , Barrows said , or be ordered by a judge to make the changes . The fines could be less , however , if a judge determined the city had made a &quot; good_faith effort &quot; to comply , she said . Ben Rockwell , a Long_Beach resident who uses a wheelchair , said he agreed with the council ' s decision to issue bonds . &quot; Voters should understand that this is the easiest way for the city to get full accessibility , the least risky of other methods , and will ultimately save the taxpayers money , &quot; Rockwell said . &quot; With some of these streets , you can count up five violations in a_few blocks , and that could be ( hundreds of thousands ) in fines right there. &quot; Rockwell said that Long_Beach has numerous obstacles for people who must use wheelchairs -- from sidewalks that cannot be navigated to public restrooms that have steps leading to the doors . Since the ADA took_effect in 1992 , the city has hired a full-time ADA coordinator and spent about $ 1.5 million in improvements , including making City_Hall restrooms accessible and adding a hydraulic lift at the Belmont Plaza Pool . Councilman Alan S . Lowenthal said that the bond issue -- a 20-year general obligation bond to be paid by property_tax assessments -- will not relieve the city of its obligation to make facilities accessible . If the bond issue fails , Lowenthal said , the city will have to pay_for the improvements over a longer term , probably through a combination of budget_cuts , tax_assessments and federal Housing and Community Development Block_Grants . Councilman Douglas S . Drummond said the bond measure should not be seen as a city attempt to pass the buck onto the taxpayer . &quot; We have a responsibility and one way or another we ' ll pay_for it , &quot; he said . The ADA was designed to give the estimated 43 million disabled Americans equal access to jobs , transportation and public facilities . The statute also bans discrimination against the disabled . Bob Torrez , the city ' s director of financial management , said Long_Beach voters have never approved the type of taxable , general obligation bond issue that is proposed . The bond issue , if approved , would increase property_taxes by about $ 30 to $ 35 a year on a $ 150 # 000 home for 20 years .</TEXT>
