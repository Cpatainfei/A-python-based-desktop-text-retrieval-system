   <HEADLINE> SIGHTS ; BORROWING OF IMAGES ADDS TO UNIQUENESS ; JANE SINCLAIR ' S VENTURA COLLEGE SHOW COMBINES PAINTING AND PHOTOCOPIES WITH ART HISTORY DETAILS AND SNAPSHOTS WHILE TOYING WITH DEPTH PERCEPTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This is the collage era , when borrowing and / or pillaging from every conceivable nook_and_cranny of the image bank -- from advertising to art history -- is not only acceptable practice , but fashion-mandated . Long before the term appropriation was anointed , it was in the very cultural air we breathed . Art has always nourished itself through larceny -- or by whatever other euphemistic name -- particularly in the 20th Century , when ideas and trends rage , then burn_out . But movements have beginnings and endings , and &quot; appropriationism &quot; has already lost much of its sting . But it hasn ' t disappeared . The unassuming work of Jane Sinclair , showing at the New Media Gallery at Ventura College , makes no attempt to disguise its allegiance to the A-word . Sinclair cleverly blends Xerography and painting , flinging together details from art history , snapshots and other visual non sequiturs , while also toying_with depth perception . What gives her pilfered images a personal touch is her graceful , wry stitching process , through which her art investigates ways of seeing . The currency of her show -- as suggested by its title , &quot; Image Scavenging &quot; -- doesn ' t detract from the emotional resonance or distinctiveness of her art . Hers is not a willy-nilly scavenging , but an expression of personalized visual data and obsession . Often , pieces of disconnected information collide , as in a dream . &quot; Window of Morning / Mourning &quot; combines a desert scene with a jail_cell window , afloat in the outer space cosmic debris that underscores many of the pieces here . Torn edges take_on metaphorical weight , as evidence of the artist ' s almost improvisational , unfussy assembly . But the fact remains that Sinclair ' s work is processed , its surfaces reduced to a smooth detached sheen that denies the tactility of paint on canvas or the rough cut-and-paste surface of the collagist . Most of the works have a trompe l ' oeil element -- usually art tools -- that appear to sit on top of the images . At play here is an ironic art riddle : She knows that we know that she knows that nobody ' s being fooled here . But the being fooled is a great tradition in art . &quot; Bitter Pill , &quot; on a backdrop resembling a Currier and Ives winter scene , has a compositional scheme with a series of echoing ovals -- faces of inert dolls and art historical icons , and a spoon with a pill . Sinclair ' s seemingly casual assortments yield hints of meaning without giving_away easy , one-shot readings . More_than making coherent statements , her art embodies a search as she sorts through personal mementos and collective memory , intercut , torn and pasted . She ' s a scavenger with a good eye and a controlled palette of images . Over in the college ' s Gallery 2 , Sally Warner shows her charcoal landscapes from the Hudson_River Valley and Ojai -- two legendary artist havens . Warner ' s pieces , almost photo-realistic seen from a distance , have a beguiling simplicity with a mystery that ' s all_in the cropping . Fragmentation and editing make their mark on her works , which , despite the fine detail , lean toward the atmospheric . Thickets , river side vistas or visions of clouded sky aspire to an appealingly deadpan poetry . MEANWHILE , IN OJAI PROPER At the Ojai Center for the Arts , Yoshihiro Youkee Nishida ' s show of work colors the main gallery with a tasteful flamboyance . Festive , large , ceremonial-like paintings on burlap accent the thick , rough surface of the material . Biomorphic blobs , bacterial imagery and sweeping abstract gestures prevail , but are contained within formal devices such_as multiple panels or underlying grids . Surprisingly , subtlety is the end result . Nishida creates a happy marriage of control and abandon . NUDE / NAKED Also at the Ojai Center are the nude studies of Elizabeth Ranelagh ' s show , &quot; The View Outside. &quot; Her small , likably whimsical works show puffy , bulbous nudes lounging in natural -- but dream-like -- settings . Gentle sexual allegories are the general rule , with one rare polemical note in &quot; Second_Fiddle , &quot; in which a man plays a nude woman like a violin . For further studies outside the realm of being clothed , head out_to Ojai ' s Artist ' s Gallery , where you can find &quot; Entirely Nude. &quot; Following hot on the heels of the gallery ' s successful erotic art show , they ' ve decided to continue the trend and make clothing optional . Notable works in this show include Bill Back ' s bizarre cartoony scenes of extra-human figures , and Jacquelyn Cavish ' s &quot; Multiple Figures , &quot; a twisted tangle of breasts and other body_parts . Nancy Whitman , normally fond of landscapes or interiors , shows an impressive , warm-hued portrait of a nude woman on a couch . From the 3-D camp , Bryan Yancey ' s relief sculpture &quot; Big Red &quot; cagily evokes a nude woman in chaps , and Frank Lauran ' s &quot; Standing Figure &quot; is a cowboy constructivist figure that achieves a stone-like appearance from wood . Mary Christie ' s porcelain piece , &quot; Divine Decadence , &quot; is an ode to an ample red-headed model , reclining on pillows and entirely naked to the world , and loving it .
