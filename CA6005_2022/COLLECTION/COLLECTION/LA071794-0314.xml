   <HEADLINE> ROMINGER , INDURAIN ' S NO . 1 THREAT , WITHDRAWS FROM TOUR DE FRANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Miguel Indurain received a special 30th birthday_present Saturday as the Tour de France rider billed as his toughest challenger , Tony Rominger , quit the race . Barely able to keep_up with the pack , the_Swiss cyclist finally succumbed to diarrhea that had left him weak and dehydrated , team doctor Benjamin Fernandez said . Rominger got_off his bicycle about 25 miles from the end of the 13th stage , from Bagneres de Bigorre to Albi . Bjarne Riis of Denmark , fifth in the Tour last year , won the stage on a late breakaway . The route covered a fairly flat 145 miles after two tough stages in the Pyrenees . Indurain celebrated his birthday in the leader ' s yellow jersey he has become accustomed to wearing in three consecutive Tour victories . He kept it again Saturday , maintaining his overall lead although he came_in nine seconds behind Riis in the pack . Virtually all_the standings remained unchanged , with everyone except Indurain moving_up one place after Rominger , who was second at the start of the day , dropped_out . Rominger had thought he was suffering from an intestinal virus since early last week and hoped the stage would n ' t be too fast and thus allow him some time for recovery . He never could get_into the race . His Mapei teammates tried to lead him back when he was flagging , but Rominger finally spoke with his team director and got_off his bike .</TEXT>
