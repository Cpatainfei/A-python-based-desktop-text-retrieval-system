   <HEADLINE> IRVINE WILL JOIN EL TORO AGENCY ; PLANNING : COUNCIL SETS_ASIDE RESERVATIONS AND VOTES TO GO ALONG WITH BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ON FORMING GOVERNMENTAL BODY THAT WOULD OVERSEE CONVERSION OF THE AIR_BASE TO CIVILIAN USE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Irvine City_Council , setting_aside last-minute reservations for the sake of resolving a six-month political fight , voted Tuesday to join the County Board of Supervisors in forming a new governmental agency to oversee planning for the conversion to civilian use of the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station . By a unanimous vote , the council approved a compromise proposal , tentatively hammered_out by Irvine and the county last month , that three representatives from Irvine and one from Lake Forest join with the five supervisors on a board of directors that will wield decision-making authority over the planning process . Irvine ' s decision marks the closest the county has come_to beginning the task of developing a base conversion strategy , with the first meeting of the newly created board tentatively scheduled for Jan . 26 . Lake Forest council_members , who are expected to take_up the issue at their meeting Tuesday , previously stated a reluctance to officially join the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority until they see documents outlining its structure . But following the Irvine council vote , Mayor Michael Ward said he expected Lake Forest to join the agency , &quot; because I think they realize that if they want to be part of the process , it behooves them to come along. &quot; County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said the agency board would hold its first meeting with or without Lake Forest . &quot; It ' s the feeling of the Board of Supervisors that this process needs to move as expeditiously as possible , &quot; Schneider said . In approving the new partnership with the county , the Irvine council backed_away from a staff recommendation issued Friday that Irvine insist on written guarantees from the supervisors about several issues covered during secret negotiations , notably Irvine ' s demand that it be allowed to annex the area occupied by the base when the Marines abandon the base . The city staff report listed a host of written commitments Irvine was seeking from the county , including an issue that was critical to Irvine ' s acceptance of the deal : a &quot; commitment to allow the annexation . . . prior to January , 1999. &quot; Instead , the council accepted a letter from Schneider stating his belief that the supervisors would be able to &quot; agree to seriously discuss the city ' s future annexation of all portions of the base not designated for public benefit conveyance or negotiated sale to the County of Orange. &quot; Schneider ' s letter imposed three conditions on the annexation negotiations : they will begin only after federal_officials approve a redevelopment plan for the 4 # 700-acre site ; Irvine must consider sharing all tax_revenue , including property , sales and hotel occupancy taxes and vehicle license fees ; and , if the agency converts a portion of the base into a commercial airport , the county will retain control of that area . Irvine City_Manager Paul O . Brady Jr . recommended Tuesday that the council accept the county ' s conditions with one key exception . Irvine will agree to discuss sharing only property_tax revenue when the annexation discussions get underway , since that is all that the city is required to negotiate under current state law , Brady said . Councilman Barry J . Hammond also clarified that while annexation of the base property must wait until a redevelopment plan is completed , Irvine will move ahead on annexation of other land surrounding the base that is within the city ' s legally defined sphere_of_influence . Irvine and the county are the only two jurisdictions that share land use authority over the 4 # 700-acre site , so the city ' s participation is crucial if the base conversion plan is to win the Defense_Department ' s approval . Irvine council_members hardly discussed the agreement , apparently anxious to get the planning underway with no further controversy . But for Irvine , the compromise was not a perfect solution . Irvine negotiators gave_up their demand for two additional seats on the El Toro governing board in exchange for some guarantee that the county and the city would begin working_on the annexation issue . A firmer commitment from the county on annexation was not legally possible at this time , county officials said before the vote . The county also held a trump_card : If the agreement with Irvine fell_apart , the county would consider a planning_board sought by North County cities that favor using El Toro as a commercial airport . That proposal would broaden the board ' s membership to include city representatives from each supervisorial district . Following his council ' s vote Tuesday , Ward said the long debate over membership on the planning_board should now be put to rest . &quot; The North County cities , instead of trying to tear the plan apart , ought to take_part in the planning . . . and give us their input and be part of it instead of trying to tear the process apart , &quot; Ward said . &quot; Let ' s get_to work. &quot; But in addition to North County cities , other critics of the plan are lining_up . Earlier Tuesday , the League of United Latin_American Citizens protested to the supervisors that Orange County ' s ethnic communities &quot; are being excluded and barred &quot; from the decision-making process . Arturo Montez , president of the Santa Ana LULAC council , asked the supervisors to consider placing on the June primary ballot a referendum establishing a nine-member El Toro commission with commissioners elected by districts to serve four-year terms . The supervisors did not respond to Montez ' s proposal . Community leaders who favor a new airport on the site also are considering a petition drive to place the El Toro issue on the November ballot , with a decision expected in a_couple_of weeks .</TEXT>
