   <HEADLINE> ITALY OFFICIAL ' S REMARK ANGERS JEWISH GROUPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jewish groups in Italy and abroad demanded Friday that Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi denounce a Cabinet_minister for suggesting &quot; the New York Jewish lobby &quot; was behind the plunging lira . Labor Minister Clemente Mastella later apologized , but the World Jewish Congress said it would complain to the U.N. Commission on Human_Rights . Berlusconi has been criticized , particularly in Western Europe , for including the National Alliance in his 3-month-old conservative coalition . The party was formed about a year ago by members of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement who renounced their roots . The flap began Thursday after the Bank of Italy unexpectedly raised the discount_rate to halt the lira ' s slide . Mastella suggested the currency ' s decline was part of a plot against the government .</TEXT>
