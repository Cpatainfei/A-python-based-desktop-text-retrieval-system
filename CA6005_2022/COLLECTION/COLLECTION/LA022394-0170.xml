   <HEADLINE> AST TO MAKE COMPUTER LINE TO BE SOLD UNDER DELL NAME ; HIGH_TECHNOLOGY : THE DEAL BETWEEN THE RIVALS , RUMORED FOR MONTHS , FOCUSES_ON PORTABLES , THE FASTEST-GROWING PART OF THE MARKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dell Computer Corp . confirmed Tuesday that rival computer maker AST Research Inc. will manufacture a line of portable_computers to be sold under Dell ' s name . The deal between the two companies was rumored for months . Lisa Rohlf , spokeswoman for Dell in Austin , Tex. , said the company began shipping the new AST-made portable_computers Tuesday . She said that Irvine-based AST is making the Dell Latitude computers in its Taiwan factory , and that Dell will complete final assembly of the computers and add software at its plants in Austin and Ireland . Financial and technical fiascoes forced Dell to cancel its portable_computer line last year and write_off $ 20 million in development costs . The company stopped selling such computers in August . But Dell officials have said they can ' t afford to stay out of the market for notebook_computers -- those that weigh less than eight pounds and fit_in a briefcase -- since it is the fastest growing part of the market . Antoine J . Tristani , analyst at South Coast Capital investment bank in Austin , estimated that Dell could sell 5 # 000 of the computers during the current fiscal quarter , with volumes increasing in the future . &quot; It will definitely enhance volume production and lower manufacturing costs for AST , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s a smart deal for both AST and Dell . They look_like they hit the sweet spot of the notebook market. &quot; AST took its Bravo notebook_computer line and enhanced it to come_up with the model that will be marketed by Dell . Rohlf said the companies will not compete directly since Dell primarily sells its computers direct to consumers while AST focuses_on various industry dealers . The Dell machines range_in price from $ 1 # 700 to $ 3 # 250 . Dell plans to re-enter the portable_computer market gradually in three phases . Future models , and possibly future manufacturing partnerships , already are in the works , Rohlf said . Dell is reportedly working with Sony Corp . for its second-phase notebook_computers , which will be out later this year . Dell ' s stock rose $ 1.75 a share to close at $ 22.75 in Nasdaq trading Tuesday , while AST ' s stock rose $ 1 a share to $ 32.25 .</TEXT>
