   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR ; BROWN RAPS WILSON FOR HIS SUPPORT OF PROP . 187 ; DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE SAYS THE INITIATIVE ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION WOULD TURN SCHOOL OFFICIALS AND OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ' INTO BIG BROTHER. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Before a classroom filled with a multiethnic array of high_school students , state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown on Wednesday lashed into Gov . Pete Wilson for his support of the anti-illegal immigration Proposition 187 , saying that it would cost the state money -- not save it -- and turn school administrators and other public employees &quot; into Big Brother. &quot; &quot; I think we need less government , not more Big Brother government , &quot; she said , adopting a favorite Republican line . As sharply as she has in her campaign to unseat Wilson , the Democratic gubernatorial nominee characterized Wilson as a man who has used the issue of illegal immigration to his own political advantage . She upbraided Wilson for actions he took as a U.S. senator that increased the number of immigrants allowed into the state . &quot; Illegal immigration didn ' t start overnight , &quot; she told students at Pasadena High_School . &quot; It ' s been here . And the incumbent governor has got fingerprints all_over the issue of illegal immigration. &quot; Her remarks came as two noted conservatives broke ranks with Wilson and came_out against Proposition 187 . Jack F . Kemp , the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Bush , and William J . Bennett , education_secretary under President Ronald Reagan , denounced the initiative as &quot; fundamentally flawed &quot; and said it could provoke a backlash against minorities . Wilson , in a campaign appearance in Long_Beach , dismissed the objections of his Republican peers . &quot; Those are two guys who are in Washington and it is very clear that they have been there too long , &quot; the governor said . &quot; When you spend too_much time in an ivory_tower think_tank , you begin to lose touch with reality. &quot; Brown said she believed that the Kemp-Bennett statement would help the campaign being waged against the initiative . &quot; It shows that this is an issue that cuts_across party_lines , &quot; she said . &quot; These are very conservative thinkers. &quot; As Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur noted , however , it currently is support for the proposition that cuts_across party_lines . A Los Angeles Times poll published Saturday noted that while support among Republicans is running high -- 75 % to 19 % -- the measure also leads among Democrats , 52 % -40 % . Independents favor it by a margin of 57 % to 34 % . Proposition 187 would deny government services to illegal immigrants , and would require medical professionals , school administrators and others to report those they suspect are in the country without proper papers . It has inspired strong emotions on both sides , from supporters who argue that the state is going broke trying to pay the bills of illegal immigrants to opponents who say it will increase crime , health concerns and incidents of bias against minorities . Brown ' s contention that the initiative would cost California money was based on the Clinton_Administration ' s threat to withhold $ 15 billion in funding for state schools if Proposition 187 is passed . The initiative apparently would violate a Supreme Court decision requiring states to educate illegal immigrant children . &quot; We can ' t afford to lose that $ 15 billion , &quot; she said . Wilson spokesman Schnur scoffed at the threat , however . &quot; We don ' t believe Bill_Clinton is going_to shut_down California ' s public_school system the year before he is up for reelection because the voters have passed an initiative he doesn ' t agree with , &quot; he said . Brown ' s reference_to Wilson ' s Senate actions was aimed at his support for an amendment to a comprehensive immigration reform act . The amendment , as drawn by Wilson , would have allowed employers to hire immigrant workers temporarily to pick perishable crops . Democrats in the House of Representatives changed it to make_it easier for the workers to remain in the United States . Wilson said he voted for the Democratic version because it was part of the overall immigration reform act . In her criticism of Wilson , Brown said he acted at the behest of his friends and campaign donors in the agriculture industry . &quot; He did that when it was politically convenient for him , &quot; she said . &quot; He received over $ 600 # 000 in campaign contributions from his special_interest friends who wanted cheap labor . So he fought for it then and now in a tough reelection campaign he wants to ride this issue. &quot; Unlike Wilson , who believes that illegal immigrants are lured to California by the promise of government-paid benefits , Brown argues that they are_after jobs . Thus , she said , she would press for tamper-proof identification cards for all Californians seeking employment , and would strengthen sanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants . In other remarks to the high_school students , Brown renewed her criticism of Wilson for what she characterized as his failure to apply for a federal grant to fund programs that help guide students from school to jobs . &quot; Our governor . . . was asleep at the switch , missed the application deadline and so California has lost out on getting $ 43 million this year , &quot; she said . Wilson spokesman Schnur said Brown was factually wrong . The Wilson Administration applied last spring for a Department_of_Education planning grant to help it put_together a proposal for the larger grant , he said . Twenty-eight other states proceeded the same way , according to Schnur . &quot; California hasn ' t missed anything , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
