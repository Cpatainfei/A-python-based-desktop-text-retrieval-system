   <HEADLINE> LOW-WEIGHT INFANTS ' PROBLEMS PERSIST , STUDY SAYS ; MEDICINE : SURVEY OF EXTREMELY SMALL BABIES FINDS THAT MANY HAVE LONG-TERM DISABILITIES . IT RENEWS DEBATE OVER THE USE OF COSTLY TECHNOLOGY TO SAVE THEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a study that is bound to fuel debate over the use of expensive technology to keep very tiny babies alive , a team of Ohio researchers has found that children who weighed less than 1 pound , 10 ounces at birth are far more likely than other youngsters to suffer long-term physical and mental disabilities . Their study , published in today ' s issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , is the first to track these &quot; extremely low birth-weight &quot; infants -- born three and sometimes nearly four months before they are_due -- into the early school_years . The research confirms the suspicions of experts that such babies , most of whom would die without neonatal intensive care that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars , are at serious risk for mental_retardation , cerebral_palsy , learning disorders and behavioral problems . Although not all_of the babies had severe problems , the tiniest infants were 10 times as likely as full-term youngsters to be mentally_retarded , the study found . They also fared considerably worse than &quot; very low birth-weight &quot; infants , who weighed less than 3 pounds , 5 ounces but more_than 1 pound , 10 ounces . &quot; The results . . . confirm our hypothesis that these children are at serious disadvantage in every skill required for adequate performance in school , &quot; wrote the authors of the study , conducted at Rainbow Babies and Childrens ' Hospital in Cleveland . &quot; Twenty-one percent of our sample had subnormal mental_abilities , and 45 % required special_education in school. &quot; For doctors who must make wrenching decisions about whether to keep these extremely premature_babies alive or allow them to die , the study renews a troubling question that has been percolating for years . In an era of concern over rising health_care costs , is it worth it to rescue these babies -- so tiny they can be held_in the palm of one hand -- if they are only going_to suffer severe disabilities and continue to rack_up huge medical_bills as they grow older ? &quot; The publication of this data really brings ( the issue ) into careful focus , and sets the stage for a debate on what we should do , &quot; said Dr. Arnold Platzker , a neonatologist at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles . &quot; It ' s a very interesting issue , not only because of the medical_science aspect but because of the health_care economics aspect. &quot; Just the other night , Platzker said , he was forced to decide whether Childrens Hospital would accept another hospital ' s referral of a baby who needed bowel surgery to survive . The baby weighed just under one pound ; California law requires doctors to provide treatment to infants weighing 1.1 pounds or more . The baby ' s doctor wanted the surgery performed , but Platzker decided against it . He explained his rationale : &quot; My feeling was that most likely we would spend several thousand dollars ( on the transfer ) to bring a baby that would die either before surgery or during surgery , or if he survived it would be a baby that would be one of these million-dollar babies. &quot; The baby died . Such decisions are particularly agonizing because doctors have no way of predicting which babies will do_well . &quot; It is very difficult to withhold support for a baby you can ' t predict the outcome for , &quot; said Dr. Linda Wright , a neonatologist at the National Institute on Child Health and Human Development . Along with other experts in neonatology and medical ethics , Wright said , research must be conducted to help doctors make better predictions . These experts said the Ohio study also highlights a pressing need for women to get adequate prenatal care , which fosters full-term pregnancies . And they said the research shows that parents , who in conjunction with doctors must decide whether to authorize heroic measures to save their children , must be_better informed of the long-term risks . &quot; This finding confirms the view that I have held , and that some others hold , that the treatment of extremely premature infants is not treatment , it is experimentation , &quot; said Dr. Arthur Caplan , a medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania . &quot; And therefore , it is very important to realize that parents should be given . . . very clear and understandable information in deciding whether to treat. &quot; H . Gerry Taylor , a psychologist at Case Western Reserve University who helped conduct the Ohio study , said one of the most troubling aspects of the research was seeing parents struggle as their children grew older . &quot; We ' re seeing kids who are falling_through the cracks . . . , &quot; Taylor said . &quot; It seems to me that if ( these infants ) are going_to survive we have an obligation to help them through , not just to say , ' Well , you made_it , you ' re home , you ' re medically stable , so take it from there , parents. ' &quot; The study followed three different groups of children born in the Cleveland area between 1982 and 1986 : 68 in the extremely low birth-weight category ; 65 in the very low birth-weight category and 61 who reached full-term . It compared children of the same race and socioeconomic status to one another . Among the findings : Half the tiniest babies had IQs below 85 , considered at the low end of average , and 21 % had IQs below 70 , which brands them mentally deficient . But just 8 % of the very low birth weight babies and 2 % of the full-term infants had IQs below 70 . When academic skills , visual function , motor function and social skills were measured , the study came_up with similar findings . For instance , 27 % of the extremely low birth weight babies functioned at below-normal levels in reading , spelling and math , as compared to 9 % of very low birth weight babies and 2 % of full-term infants . Nearly half the tiniest babies were in special_education by second grade . These infants are a small subgroup of all premature_babies , accounting_for 0.3 % of all births in the six-county region used in the study . Although no one has calculated the cost of caring for them , Wright estimates that the nation spends $ 2 billion a year on medical_care for all low birth weight babies , defined as those weighing less than 5 pounds , 8 ounces . The figures do not include long-term costs . Despite the sobering findings of the Ohio study , experts say the news may_not be all bad . There have been considerable improvements in care since the children in the study were born , they note , and if a similar study were to be conducted on babies born today the outcome might be different . According to Wright , more pregnant women are being given prenatal steroids -- which helps develop their babies ' lungs , kidneys and brains -- when they show signs that they are going_to give_birth prematurely . And premature_babies are now being treated with surfactant , a chemical that can help prevent impaired lung function , which can cause serious long-term health_problems . The Tiniest Babies While sophisticted technology can keep even the tiniest babies alive , a new study shows that &quot; extremely low birthweight &quot; infants , born at less than 1 pound 10 oz. , often suffer serious mental and physical disabilities as they grow older . The following chart tracks the performance of these children once they reach school age , comparing them to &quot; very low birthweight &quot; babies ( between 1 lb . 10 oz and 3 lbs . 5 oz. ) and to babies born full-term .
