   <HEADLINE> CARNIVAL-LIKE CELEBRATION FOR BRAZIL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an all-day , three-city tour , Brazil ' s World Cup soccer champions were swept_up on the shoulders of this beleaguered nation in a massive outpouring of affection and admiration that stretched from the slums of Rio de Janeiro to the presidential palace in Brasilia . The team , which won an unprecedented fourth World Cup , started in the northeastern beach city of Recife and reached Rio where it was greeted by 500 # 000 screaming , dancing , shouting , crying fans , more_than one-third of the city . The team plane was three hours late , because of excess baggage from last-minute shopping by players who decided to take_advantage of their Los Angeles visit to buy televisions , stereos , refrigerators and washers that are outrageously expensive here . As the plane touched_down , Romario , the team ' s star throughout the monthlong World Cup ' 94 , hoisted the nation ' s flag through the pilot window . Ricardo Rocha , the only player from the state , led the team off the plane , kissing the ground and hoisting the World Cup trophy into the air . In Recife , where the governor had declared Tuesday a state holiday , the team mounted red_fire engines for an 11-mile parade from the airport along the Praia da Viagem beach through a virtual sea of people . Bands played and fireworks exploded overhead . Scores of mounted police struggled to keep_back the enthusiastic fans who danced jubilantly , their small red , white , yellow and blue umbrellas held overhead , while shouting &quot; Teatra Campeao ! Teatra Campeao ! ( Four-time champion ) . &quot; People crammed into every available space along the parade route , clinging_to balconies , hanging from flagpoles and hoisting themselves up trees . Mothers held babies in the air to behold their triumphant warriors for the historic moment , the first World Cup title in 24 years for a nation in which soccer is more religion than sport . Others held_up pictures of Romario , who is being called &quot; the little saint. &quot; Recife was where Brazil routed Bolivia , 6-0 , last August in a morale-boosting qualifying victory that launched the team toward the World Cup_finals . Brazil soccer officials pledged then to repay the loyal support they had received from Recife fans . The stop , scheduled to last for an hour , went_on for three . Players finally re-boarded their plane for the nation ' s capital , Brasilia , where they were met by an even larger crowd , including President Itamar Franco and much of the nation ' s Congress . Mounting another set of fire_engines and the same car used for a similar celebration when the team last claimed the Cup , team members hoisted a yellow crash_helmet in honor of another Brazilian legend , race_car driver Ayrton Senna , who was killed in a racing accident last May in Italy . They had dedicated their title to Senna . They slowly made their way through another mass of fans adorned in green and yellow , Brazil ' s national colors , before arriving_at the Treis Podres where the president presented them with the Order of Sporting Merit , the nation ' s highest such honor . From the second-floor balcony of the presidential palace , the team members looked down into a near wall of green and yellow . Fans waved green and yellow_flags , there were green and yellow hats , green and yellow shirts , green and yellow dogs , green and yellow cars -- even green and yellow people . In Rio , hundreds of thousands of fans , many of whom had been waiting for nearly 10 hours , stretched across the 20-mile parade route from the city ' s airport to the beach community Leblon . The crowd was smaller than expected because of the team ' s late arrival , partially because of a holdup by federal customs officials querying team members regarding their troublesome luggage . The team , exhausted after 24 hours of travel , mounted another set of fire_engines for a caravan through downtown , Flamengo , Copacabana , Ipanema and finally to Leblon . Samba bands , their drum corps beating_out a pounding rhythm , lined the route , and fans began dancing and shouting in jubilation upon word that the team had finally touched_down , seven hours late . It was an especially sweet stop for the team ' s other star , Bebeto , who would meet for the first time his son , born in Rio de Janeiro during the World Cup .</TEXT>
