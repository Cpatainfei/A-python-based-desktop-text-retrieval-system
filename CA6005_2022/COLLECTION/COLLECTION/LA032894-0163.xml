   <HEADLINE> GETTING SERIOUS ? ; SUCCESS OF ' PHILADELPHIA , ' ' SCHINDLER ' S ' SENDS A SIGNAL TO HOLLYWOOD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So , what now Hollywood ? The Oscars are over for another year . And the industry had a record $ 5.2-billion year at the box_office . If 1993 -- when the major studios tried to &quot; do the right thing &quot; by releasing such consciousness-raising films as &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and &quot; Philadelphia &quot; -- proved anything , it was that quality can sell . But , this is not a new concept . Any industry veteran will tell you that the majors have always made their share of provocative , issue-oriented movies . Some actually made money . &quot; But , you always did them with a sinking feeling that you were betting_on a long_shot , &quot; says John Calley , the new president of United Artists , who as Warner Bros. ' head of production in the 1970s championed such risky pictures as Stanley Kubrick ' s &quot; A Clockwork Orange. &quot; Today , notes Calley , &quot; there seems to be a market for the long_shot and , if anything , film companies are more aggressively pursuing material of real significance. &quot; He says this is definitely the case with himself and his boss , MGM chairman Frank Mancuso , the former head of Paramount Pictures . Calley , who dropped_out of Hollywood for 13 years in 1980 , admits that if someone had come_to him 14 years ago about releasing &quot; The Piano , &quot; he would have been &quot; baffled -- and wondered , ' What do we do with it ? ' &quot; Back in 1974 , although Warners financed Federico Fellini ' s &quot; Amarcord , &quot; of which Calley was a big fan , he said the studio ' s distribution executives refused to release the foreign-language movie domestically &quot; because they didn ' t know what to do with it. &quot; ( The film was released in the U.S. by Roger Corman ' s New World Pictures , and overseas by Warners. ) The major studios , says Calley , &quot; are now honoring films of serious content and recognizing not only their value to society but their value as moneymakers. &quot; He claims that even a film like Columbia ' s &quot; The Remains of the Day , &quot; which he and Mike Nichols co-produced with Merchant / Ivory and which cost around $ 10 million , &quot; will ( eventually ) make a very significant amount of money. &quot; &quot; There ' s now a rational perception , &quot; Calley says , &quot; that films of high_quality have an audience waiting for them , and at_the_same_time that doesn ' t diminish the potency of other kinds of ( more commercial ) films. &quot; Producer Dawn Steel , production president at Paramount Pictures and a former studio head at Columbia Pictures , says : &quot; We ' ve always known that if you make a good movie , the audience will come most of the time . That we could make movies that have something to say and that they can make money -- I never felt those things were mutually_exclusive . . . . But , maybe , we ' ve just lost sight of that in the last couple of years. &quot; TriStar President Marc Platt , who had supported &quot; Philadelphia &quot; before any top-flight stars were attached , says he ' d like to think that the past year proves that films can be provocative and emotional and find a mainstream audience all at_the_same_time -- &quot; and that would help similar films to evolve. &quot; &quot; Philadelphia , &quot; he says , proves that audiences are &quot; intelligent and seem to be hungry for movies that deal with relevant , albeit difficult or sensitive , subject matter. &quot; While it is not the first movie to deal with AIDS , &quot; Philadelphia &quot; is the first major studio release about the disease . Platt said he hopes the fact that the film was headlined by Tom Hanks , one of Hollywood ' s biggest stars , proved that a heterosexual actor &quot; going outside himself to portray a gay_man &quot; will help break_down barriers that exist in conventional Hollywood . Both &quot; Philadelphia , &quot; which has grossed $ 66.8 million domestically , and Steven Spielberg ' s three-hour , black-and-white Holocaust epic , &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; which has already sold more_than $ 100 million worth of tickets worldwide ( and industry pundits predict that figure could double ) , attracted bigger audiences than even the studios that released them expected . Nonetheless , because of their questionable commercial viability , neither came_to the screen easily , even though each cost considerably less than the industry average of $ 30 million . * With such serious movies proving good for the pocketbook as well as for the consciousness , it raises the question if 1993 is the wake-up call Hollywood needed ? Twentieth Century Fox chairman Peter Chernin says , &quot; Clearly , this has been a very encouraging year in terms of the quality of movies. &quot; He said &quot; over and over again during the year , we learned there was a more sophisticated adult audience out there than many of us thought previously. &quot; As the number of films pouring into the marketplace today increases ( especially with Disney and Warners each releasing upward of 35 a year ) , Chernin says , audiences are saying , &quot; We ' re not interested in volume , but in good movies that are unique. &quot; He said that includes issue-oriented movies such_as &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and &quot; Philadelphia &quot; or pure entertainment offerings like &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective , &quot; &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; and &quot; In the Line of Fire. &quot; The message that audiences are giving to the studios , Chernin says , is &quot; Don ' t make cookie-cutter formula movies , &quot; a goal he admits , &quot; is easier said than done. &quot; Moviegoers are saying , &quot; We want good movies , not necessarily art movies , but movies with character and dimension and uniqueness to them. &quot; And quality , the Fox movie chief concedes , is &quot; a tough , scary word. &quot; Because 1993 was a year that financially rewarded quality , Chernin says &quot; it will push everybody to at least try_for quality. &quot; Paramount Pictures chairman Sherry Lansing said that although clearly the mandate of any studio head is to &quot; make movies that make money , &quot; the kind of business that some of the serious subject films are doing &quot; encourages us to know we can make all kinds of films now . . . . We can make movies for that intelligent , over-25 adult audience , who are going_to the movies in spades , and justify it now. &quot; Tom Pollock , chairman of Universal Pictures , agrees : &quot; You can do_well by doing good. &quot; That notion , he says , becomes even more relevant &quot; in a world where there are so many choices for moviegoers , and people are reluctant to spend money on films they may_not feel they ' re getting their money ' s worth on. &quot; One of the ways a picture can stand_out , he suggests , &quot; is if it ' s good -- not that it has a marketing hook or a major star or that 600 people get gunned_down in the first five minutes . Hey , how about that for a revelation ? &quot; What is the lesson in all this ? &quot; Make really good movies and most of the time they ' ll really work -- but not all_the time , &quot; Pollock muses . But UA ' s Calley warns of an inherent danger in Hollywood ' s tendency to jump_on the now-vogue &quot; quality sells &quot; bandwagon . He fears studios will start churning_out &quot; an avalanche of oddball films , and probably a lot of them shouldn ' t be made . . . then the pendulum will swing back. &quot; But , of course , Hollywood is notorious for trying to imitate someone else ' s success . Veteran comedy director Ivan Reitman ( &quot; Twins , &quot; &quot; Ghostbusters , &quot; &quot; Kindergarten Cop &quot; ) , who directed last year ' s &quot; Dave &quot; and is currently prepping the Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy &quot; Junior , &quot; avows : &quot; There ' s no such thing as a guy named Hollywood . There are thousands of people all hunting for their next movie and we all have individual desires and agendas for doing what we do. &quot; Reitman says that for years he has been wanting to tell the story of his parents ' survival from communism and the family ' s &quot; harrowing &quot; escape_from Czechoslovakia in 1950 , but &quot; I have never felt emotionally ready to tackle it . I have to do what I feel is right for me. &quot; The director pointed_out that in addition to the serious hits of ' 93 , &quot; there was a great range &quot; of comedies and action adventure movies -- from &quot; Sleepless in Seattle &quot; and &quot; Dave &quot; to &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; and &quot; In the Line_of_Fire &quot; -- all_of which &quot; had substance to them. &quot; And as Universal ' s Pollock reminds , Hollywood should &quot; never forget the message &quot; in Preston Sturges ' 1941 Hollywood satire , &quot; Sullivan ' s Travels. &quot; The film ' s central character , a commercial director , decides to go_out and make a serious art movie only to realize that what people really want is laughter and escapism in their lives . &quot; So , it ' s not so bad making pure entertainment. &quot;</TEXT>
