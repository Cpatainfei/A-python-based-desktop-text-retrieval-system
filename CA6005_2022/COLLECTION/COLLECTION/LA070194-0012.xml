   <HEADLINE> HOME ENTERTAINMENT ; COSTNER ' S ' EARP ' GIVES LIFE TO OLD EARP VIDEOS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With last week ' s theatrical release of &quot; Wyatt Earp , &quot; starring Kevin Costner , preceded by the video debut of another Earp movie , &quot; Tombstone , &quot; with Kurt Russell , there ' s renewed interest in the frontier marshal . Now video retailers are prominently displaying old movies about Earp that had been buried in the Western bins . The best of the lot are &quot; My Darling Clementine &quot; ( 1946 ) and &quot; Gunfight at the O.K. Corral &quot; ( 1957 ) . Directed by John Ford , &quot; Clementine &quot; features Henry Fonda as Earp and Victor Mature as Doc Holliday . This is one of the great Westerns of that era , with Mature , playing Holliday as a dashing scholar , giving one of the two best performances of his career ( &quot; Kiss of Death &quot; was the other ) . The chemistry between Fonda and Mature is terrific . Until &quot; Tombstone , &quot; the Earp movie with the best action sequences was &quot; Gunfight at the O.K. Corral , &quot; with Burt Lancaster as Earp and Kirk Douglas as Holliday . Directed by John Sturges , it features some taut , marvelously edited action sequences . Some Western-film fans list this as one of the top five Westerns of the ' 50s , just after &quot; High_Noon &quot; and &quot; Shane. &quot; &quot; Frontier Marshal , &quot; from 1939 , is little more_than a B Western , with Cesar Romero hamming it up as Holliday and Randolph Scott making Earp as interesting as a tumbleweed . &quot; Wichita &quot; ( 1955 ) , which focuses_on Earp , isn ' t much better , with Joel McCrea playing the hero with zero flair . What ' s worse , the action scenes aren ' t even well staged . Another one to skip is &quot; Hour of the Gun , &quot; a 1967 movie that follows Earp ( James Garner ) and Holliday ( Jason Robards ) in the post-O.K. Corral period . A fairly dull Western , with Robards ' Holliday the least interesting of all_the screen characterizations . &quot; Doc &quot; ( 1971 ) , with Stacy Keach as Holliday and Harris Yullin as Earp , isn ' t out on video yet but it ' s probably for the best . This colorless Western is the worst of all_the Earp movies . Videobits The pilot for the &quot; I Love Lucy &quot; series , shown on TV for the first time a_few years ago , is just out on video , on CBS at $ 13 . What makes &quot; I Love Lucy : The Very First Show &quot; really a must for hard-core fans is the commentary by Lucie Arnaz -- daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz -- and the scriptwriters . There have long been complaints that major video companies neglect the Spanish-language market -- particularly the kidvid segment . Buena Vista helped fill that void this week , releasing 10 Spanish-language tapes , including the animated &quot; Beauty and the Beast , &quot; &quot; The Sword and the Stone , &quot; &quot; Pinocchio &quot; and &quot; Alice in Wonderland &quot; at $ 25 each , and four &quot; Sing-Along &quot; tapes at $ 13 each . Southern California retailers with large Latino clienteles are expected to do_good business with these videos . Foreign Films &quot; Mon Oncle , &quot; starring Jacques Tati , is one of the best French comedies ever . The 1958 film is available , digitally remastered , on Home Vision Cinema . For $ 30 , with English subtitles , ( 800 ) 323-4222 . . . . For those who have never seen famed Japanese actor Kazuo Hasegawa , he ' s excellent in the 1979 movie &quot; An Actor ' s Revenge , &quot; director Kon Ichikawa ' s film about the revenge mission of an actor from a Kabuki troupe . A subtitled rental from New Yorker Video , ( 800 ) 447-0196 . . . . Coming from New Yorker on July 13 , &quot; The Sun ' s Burial , &quot; a grim , fascinating drama set_in an Osaka slum , about illegal blood-selling . It ' s directed by Nagisa Oshima , best known for the steamy &quot; In the Realm of the Senses. &quot; Special Interest Videos An outstanding documentary , &quot; Schindler , &quot; came_out Wednesday as a rental on HBO . It ' s about the hero of Steven Spielberg ' s &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; featuring interviews with some of the Jews he helped survive the Holocaust . . . . With &quot; The Lion King &quot; dominating the box_office , kiddies will want related videos . One possibility is &quot; The Jungle King , &quot; the animated feature about a lion maturing into king-of-the-jungle status . Youngsters should find this one entertaining . On Sony Wonder at $ 25 . . . . For UFO fanatics , the hourlong &quot; Visitors From Space &quot; makes a fairly convincing case -- with interviews and photos -- that aliens have come_to Earth . Too talky at times but often absorbing . For $ 40 from Films of the Nation Video , ( 908 ) 462-3522 . What ' s New On Video ; &quot; Philadelphia &quot; ( Columbia TriStar ) ; Hollywood ' s first major-star AIDS movie is significant because of its message about tolerance . Tom Hanks won the Oscar for his very sympathetic role as a lawyer who ' s fired when his firm discovers he ' s a homosexual with AIDS . He sues the firm , hiring a lawyer ( Denzel Washington ) who also has to deal with his own homophobia . The courtroom battle is the centerpiece of the movie , which is sometimes genuinely moving -- but at times it goes Hollywood and turns shameless tear-jerker . &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; ( MCA / Universal ) ; The true story of a brash young Irishman ( Daniel Day-Lewis ) who ' s wrongfully jailed , with his father ( Pete Postlethwaite ) , in 1974 for a English pub-bombing that killed five people . Riveting drama , set largely in prison , focusing_on the father-son relationship , the ugly Irish-English feud and the efforts of their attorney ( Emma Thompson ) to set them free . Great acting by the entire cast . The three stars were all nominated for Oscars , along with the movie and director Jim Sheridan . &quot; Naked &quot; ( New Line ) ; Writer-director Mike Leigh ' s movie , set_in London , is tough going because the lead character is so unsavory . But if you ' re in the mood for a gut-wrenching downer , try to sit through the adventures of this bright , rebellious , abusive , reckless loser -- brilliantly played by David Thewlis . The irony is that he does such a good job playing a distasteful character that the movie itself is distasteful . &quot; Blindfold : Acts of Obsession &quot; ( Libra ) ; Most fans will skip the R edition of this movie , which was shown on cable , in favor of the unrated version , which features added footage -- nude scenes of star Shannen Doherty . She plays a housewife in the throes of an affair with her kinky therapist ( Judd Nelson ) . Doherty gives a zesty performance , helping to make this a cut above the usual cheesy fare in the soft-core porn genre .
