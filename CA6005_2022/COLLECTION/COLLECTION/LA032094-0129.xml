   <TEXT> Capt . Valentine Strasser was a lad of 25 when a group of equally young fellow officers , fresh from toppling the government , asked him to rule the nation . Two years into his almost accidental regime , Africa ' s youngest dictator has managed to survive a civil_war , two coup attempts and global condemnation for executing enemies , muzzling the press and drafting boys as young as 12 into the army . He also has endorsed a two-year transition to democracy , cleaned the trash from the capital , resumed tax_collections , cut street crime , slashed civil_service rolls by one-fourth and lowered inflation from 115 % annually to less than 15 % . Thrust into a fishbowl , Strasser , now 27 , and his twentysomething ruling junta say they have developed a sense that history is judging them , the first African leaders to be born after colonialism . &quot; We all believe it is for posterity , &quot; said Maj . Julius Maada Bio , 29 , the No . 2 man in Strasser ' s ruling council . &quot; I ' ve assumed a position of a high responsibility . I like my responsibilities , &quot; he said , adding paradoxically : &quot; But as a young_man , I can ' t say I enjoy them. &quot; Strasser and his clique came_of_age during the corrupt dictatorships of the 1970s and 1980s , a period when the school_system fell_apart to such a degree that students took their chairs home so they could be certain to have a seat in class the next day . Strasser joined the army after high_school . He came_to power after the Cold_War , when the one-superpower world could demand democracy and free markets in return for financial_aid -- prompting most of the 48 sub-Saharan African_nations to try representative government . Most have failed . By any yardstick , the chances that Strasser ' s government will be peacefully replaced by a model democracy in two years seem remote . That hasn ' t stopped the world from giving him an intensive civics lesson . Strasser is being bombarded by advice from the continent ' s biggest military dictatorship , Nigeria ; the United States and its allies ; and that global arbiter of economic aid , the International Monetary Fund . Dutifully accepting painful IMF restructuring conditions has its rewards . Strasser has received $ 300 million in global aid . The Germans finance waste disposal , the_British help organize tax_collections , ethnic Lebanese run most businesses and an advisory council of internationally respected Leonians has drafted a proposed constitution they have gently nudged Strasser to support . His junta members , whose trademark attire is sunglasses , berets and jungle fatigues , also are regularly counseled by the fellow West_African nation of Ghana , where Flight Lt . Jerry Rawlings turned his own young soldiers ' coup 14 years ago into an election victory last year . Nigeria , meanwhile , is helping Strasser fight a rebel war that has paralyzed the diamond industry in the south and east . Nigerian troops also are defending Freetown , including Strasser ' s home . The Nigerian dictator , Gen . Sani Abacha , set what might be considered a bad example for Strasser last year by ousting a civilian government , dissolving elected legislatures and rolling back a decade of economic restructuring . &quot; They have their useful points , &quot; Bio said of the disparate influences , &quot; but they have their own faults. &quot; Still , &quot; the boys , &quot; as they are known , have little experience with democracy or the outside world . Bio glared sullenly from behind his office desk while a press aide berated a reporter for asking inappropriate questions . &quot; One has to be extremely tactful dealing with them , &quot; said Tejan Kabbah , former manager of the U.N. Development Program in New York and chairman of the advisory council . The Oxford-educated Kabbah , 62 , said the advisory council is applying pressure to the Strasser government &quot; subtly , so as not to embarrass them. &quot; It has been promoting the 170-page draft constitution by canvassing villages with posters and slogans in the indigenous languages . The schedule calls_for a public referendum on the document in May , 1995 , and election of a multi-party government in 1996 . The council acknowledges that democracy is not an easy sell in one of the world ' s poorest nations , where life_expectancy is 42 years , 86 % of the people are illiterate and infant_mortality is among the world ' s highest . Young Leonians , who have embraced Strasser as one of them , have been hardened by deprivation and repression . &quot; The crude culture of survival in the past 30 years has created a situation where people only care about survival , not democracy , &quot; said Paul Kamara , 36 , a human_rights activist and journalist jailed three times by Strasser ' s predecessor and once by Strasser . Strasser religiously shuns the press and declined to be interviewed . People who meet him regularly say he has grown isolated and makes few daily decisions . Bio chairs the Cabinet meetings . But Strasser remains popular in this West_African nation of 4.5 million , which was settled two centuries ago by freed slaves from Britain , the United States and Jamaica . Sierra_Leone , as beautiful as it is poor , has perfect ocean beaches ringed by mist-shrouded mountains . European tourists frequent beach-front hotels and stroll the sand accosted only by mellow merchants peddling beach sandals , prostitutes , T-shirts and drugs . The seacoast capital , Freetown , is a clean but pathetically ramshackle collection of colonial-era buildings in varying states of decay . The dirt streets are narrow , crowded and closed whenever Strasser goes_for a drive . Sierra_Leone won independence from Britain in 1961 and began a long decline marked by coups and contested elections that left hundreds dead . In 1985 , Maj . Gen . Joseph Momoh , the army commander , took_over and the country slid into a social hell of interminable fuel_lines , food shortages and corruption that diverted 90 % of diamond production . In 1991 , a rebellion began that ultimately forced 1.5 million people from their homes . Because Momoh could not pay or feed his soldiers , junior officers became malcontents and agitators . By May , 1992 , things were so bad that the United Nations listed Sierra_Leone as the world ' s worst place to live . Several days later , nine junior officers led a 60-soldier convoy into town to demand their pay at gunpoint . The unpopular Momoh , virtually without support , fled the country . The surprised mutineers , largely uneducated men from rural villages , asked the more charismatic Strasser to lead a provisional military government . He was hailed as a savior by a_people who overlooked , sometimes cheered , his regime ' s early rash of human_rights abuses , such_as the execution without trial of 29 alleged coup plotters on Freetown ' s lovely beach , which prompted Britain to suspend aid . Such abuses have been curbed and Britain resumed assistance in January . But 30 politicians remain under house_arrest and about 20 newspapers remain closed . Four journalists are being prosecuted on sedition charges for quoting a Swedish newspaper that accused Strasser and his men of selling black_market diamonds in Brussels . Even though life has improved , there is virtually no economic_growth . Investors steer clear of a nation at war run_by soldiers in their 20s . Former businessman John Benjamin , 41 , the only civilian in the ruling junta and the only member older than 29 , insists the young government is no less stable than any other in West Africa . &quot; I think they have really matured , &quot; he said . &quot; All our colleagues have taken things much more seriously . &quot; They are very aware of their place in history and they don ' t want to fail . When you are in your 20s and you fail , you have a longer_time to live with your mistakes. &quot;</TEXT>
