   <TEXT> AND ONE MORE THING : As leader of the Leaving Trains , &quot; Falling &quot; James Moreland is a legend in L.A. punk circles . Still , he was as surprised as anyone to hear that an Italian band has named itself after him.But he says he ' s flattered , and is helping to arrange some California shows pairing his own group with the Falling James Band this summer . Moreland was first alerted about the group by Howe Gelb of the group Giant Sand , who heard about it while on_tour in Italy . Moreland himself actually visited his namesake on a Leaving Trains tour and wrote a short item about it for the alternative rock magazine Fiz . &quot; It ' s really cool -- and they happen to be a rocking_band , &quot; says Moreland . Meanwhile , the Leaving Trains are set to release a new album , &quot; The Big Jinx , &quot; including sessions recorded with producer Chas Ramirez , who died last year in a warehouse accident. *</TEXT>
