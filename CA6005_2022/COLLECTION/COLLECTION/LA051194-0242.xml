   <HEADLINE> A MONSTROUS EFFORT ; KOREAN AUTO_MAKER KIA TACKLES SOUTHLAND MARKET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The television ads feature a giant Godzilla-like creature named Gorgo stomping through downtown Tokyo as screaming residents flee the imperiled city . The message : &quot; There ' s only one thing more frightening to Japan -- a well-built car for under $ 8 # 500. &quot; In truth , Japanese auto_makers abandoned the low-priced new car market in the United States several years ago . But there ' s no doubt that -- despite the hyperbole -- the television and billboard campaign is helping establish America ' s newest import . Since its Feb . 3 debut in Portland , Korean auto_maker Kia Motors Corp . has opened 50 dealerships in the West and sold 2 # 600 of its compact economy cars , which sell for as low as $ 8 # 495 . Now Kia is coming_to Southern California -- the nation ' s toughest car market -- with the scheduled opening Thursday of 16 new dealerships . They cover a territory stretching from Bakersfield to Cathedral City , but are concentrated in Los Angeles and Orange counties . The dealers -- all_of them already selling other brands -- are eager to see if Kia will live_up_to its advertising , or flop like the 1961 movie &quot; Gorgo , &quot; in which Kia ' s monster mascot originally starred . Although new_to the United States , Kia does have a track record . It sells cars under its own name in 90 countries and produces nearly 700 # 000 cars and trucks a year . With annual revenue of more_than $ 4 billion last year , it ranks 333rd on Fortune ' s Global 500 list and is Korea ' s second-largest car_maker after Hyundai Motor Corp . The company was founded in Korea in 1944 as a metal tubing and bicycle parts manufacturer -- Kia means &quot; gear , &quot; as in a bicycle ' s toothed sprocket . It later began making bicycles , then motorcycles and heavy trucks . It began passenger_car production in 1974 . In 1987 , Kia contracted with Ford Motor Co . to begin manufacturing the Ford-designed Festiva economy car . That successful venture has put more_than 800 # 000 Kia-built cars into American garages . Ford discontinued the Festiva this year , but Kia builds its replacement , the Aspire . * Kia officials decided in 1990 to begin selling cars in the United States under their own banner and set_up a small office in Irvine under the name Kia Motors America Inc. the following year . W . Greg Warner , a former Hyundai Motor America executive , was hired as chief operating officer . He had firsthand experience with that company ' s spectacular 1986 launch and the myriad problems its early sales successes caused . One of Warner ' s missions has been to ensure that Kia does not repeat the Hyundai mistakes . To do that , he designed a go-slow approach . Kia has been taking a regional approach to launching its sales network , opening dealerships in quick succession in Oregon , Las Vegas , Washington , Arizona , Utah , Colorado , Northern California and , last month , San Diego County . Each opening has been trumpeted in a flurry of local radio , television , newspaper and billboard ads featuring the grainy image of Gorgo . On average , each of the new dealers has been selling 1.1 Kias a day . Although Kia plans to introduce a curvy sports utility vehicle , the Sportage , in December , and a mid-sized sedan in 1995 , the company is entering the U.S. market with only one model , the four-door Sephia . It typically is the third or even fourth brand sold on dealers ' lots , which helps new Kia dealers ensure profits with the line because they didn ' t have to invest $ 1 million or more in separate showrooms . Most dealerships also haven ' t had to hire new sales or service personnel . Not everyone is enthralled with the Sephia . Most reviews give it high marks for quality at a low-to-moderate price and find the styling acceptable , though not trend-setting . But Kia is knocked for omitting air_bags from its inaugural offering and for having the smallest engine in its class , which includes four-door versions of the Saturn , Ford Escort , Mazda Protege and , if one can be found , a base-priced Dodge Neon . In its June issue , Car and Driver magazine compared nine four-door economy sedans and ranked Kia ninth , largely because of the performance-oriented publication ' s dislike of the Sephia ' s 88-horsepower engine and its pedestrian handling characteristics . Still , the review says that with air conditioning , power windows , mirrors and door locks and an AM-FM-cassette stereo_system , the fully-loaded Sephia GS at $ 12 # 065 &quot; offers excellent value . . . for bargain hunters who ask , ' How much car can I get for the least amount_of_money ? ' &quot; In Las Vegas , where Kias have been part of the Budget Rent-A-Car fleet since August , the Sephia -- which comes_in three trim levels -- has become one of the city ' s best-selling four-door automobiles . Courtesy Kia , the lone dealer in America ' s gaming capital , sold 75 of the $ 8 # 500 to $ 12 # 000 cars in February . And Courtesy didn ' t start selling until the 5th of that 28-day month , said owner Harold Drezner . There were more Sephias registered to private owners in Las Vegas in February than new four-door models of the Honda Civic , Ford Escort , Nissan Sentra or Toyota Corolla , according to data collected by independent analyst R.L. Polk &amp; Co . But no one really expects the car to become a phenomenal seller overnight . Industry_analysts , Kia dealers and even the dark-suited executives at Kia Motors America Inc. ' s new headquarters in Irvine say the goal is to start small and grow at a moderate pace while building a solid reputation for customer service and product reliability . &quot; that ' s the reason for our existence , &quot; said Warner , &quot; to deliver vehicles that are the equal_to the best available in the category at a significant price advantage. &quot; Warner is determined that his company not repeat the Hyundai experience : When that company ' s subcompact Excel hit the market at under $ 5 # 000 it became an instant hit and the factory opted to make as_many cars as it could sell instead of only as_many as its quality_control system could handle . As a result , Hyundai set U.S. records for a new automobile franchise , selling more_than 250 # 000 cars in its second year and almost 1 million by 1989 , when the bubble burst as its overzealousness left it with a reputation as a maker of inexpensive but unreliable cars . The image has hung_on although industry experts say the reliability problems have been cured . Warner maintains , and industry specialists like J.D. Power &amp; Associates ' competitive market_analyst Tom Dukes agree , that Kia seems to have produced a good , competitive economy car that meets or exceeds the basic quality standards that have been set by the Japanese auto industry . &quot; I was prepared not to like it , &quot; said Dukes , &quot; but I was pleasantly surprised . All the fundamentals are there. &quot; Jeannine Saniz certainly thinks so , and while positive reviews by consultants are nice , Saniz ' s opinion is more important -- because she actually bought a Sephia . The 21-year-old San Diego bank teller and her husband were about to purchase a $ 13 # 800 Geo Prizm -- the Toyota Corolla clone built_in Northern California and sold by Chevrolet-Geo dealers -- when Kia ' s advertising blitz in San Diego caught their attention . She drove 40 minutes to a new Kia dealership in Carlsbad last month to look_at Sephias and drove_away in a turquoise model with air conditioning , power_steering , automatic_transmission and a stereo AM-FM radio and tape cassette_player for just over $ 12 # 000 . For the $ 1 # 800 savings , Saniz said , she doesn ' t mind not having an air_bag -- a safety device Kia says will arrive with its 1995 models . &quot; We were really surprised at the quality for the price , &quot; she said . One item that helped clinch the sale : Kia provides a free 36-month bumper-to-bumper warranty that includes 24-hour roadside service . Kia officials say their focus_on quality_control and customer satisfaction is derived from the company ' s ownership structure : employees own the largest block of stock , 12 % , and have a vested_interest in making_sure the company does_well . In addition , Ford owns a 10 % stake and Japan ' s Mazda Motors Corp. , which supplies the designs for Kia engines and transmissions , owns 8 % . The rest of the company ' s shares are traded on the Korean Stock_Exchange . The employee interest in the company , as well as the Mazda and Ford links , prompted Carson auto retailing magnate Don Kott to ask_for a Kia franchise . Kott already sells Fords , Lincolns , Mercurys , Chryslers , Plymouths , Isuzus and heavy trucks and figures a company that is partly owned by its workers has got_to be finicky about quality . Besides , he said , &quot; I know they build a good product . Of all_the cars we ' ve sold over the past 10 years , the Festiva has had the lowest incidence of repair. &quot; Kott said he ' s so sure of the long-term value of a Kia franchise that he intends to build a separate Kia showroom to anchor a six-acre expansion of his Carson auto center . The 6-foot-4 , 300-pound car_dealer said there ' s another thing he finds impressive about the Kia Sephia : &quot; I fit_in it and am comfortable . And that ' s unlike a lot of small cars. &quot; Other dealers who have signed_on with Kia said the company ' s focus_on consumer satisfaction -- the name of the game in today ' s car business -- was a key reason for signing_on . &quot; I have never , ever , been through as much to get a franchise as with Kia , &quot; said Ron Dixon , owner of the dealership in Carlsbad . &quot; They talked to my bankers , I had to show them my quality and customer satisfaction ratings from Ford and Isuzu going_back three years . When they called and asked me if I would be interested in applying for a franchise , they warned me that they would n ' t talk to anyone whose ratings weren ' t better than the industry average. &quot; Dealer Danny McKenna said Kia -- unlike other manufacturers -- stressed customer satisfaction over sales volume . McKenna , who will sell Kias at his South County Motors Volkswagen and Isuzu lot in Huntington Beach , also owns McKenna Volkswagen , Porsche , Audi and BMW in Norwalk . &quot; With all_the others , the first concern is unit sales -- how many cars I can move . They all care about customer satisfaction , but sales is_on top of the list , &quot; he said . &quot; With Kia , the very first thing we discussed was customer service. &quot; Kia Motors America * Founded : 1991 * Headquarters : Irvine * Chief operating officer : W .
