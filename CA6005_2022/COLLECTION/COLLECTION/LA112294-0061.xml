   <HEADLINE> THE WEEK AHEAD : HELSINKI ; SHIPBOARD MEMORIAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A shipboard memorial service will be held Saturday off the Finnish island of Uto for the at least 885 people who died when the luxury ferry Estonia sank_in the Baltic_Sea in September . The Estonia capsized when its 56-ton bow door ripped_off in a storm , allowing water to enter the ferry ' s huge car deck and destabilize the ship . Relatives of the Estonia victims -- most of whom were Swedish -- have been calling_for the entire wreck to be raised from the seabed off southern Finland . Hundreds of victims ' bodies are entombed within the wreck , and the relatives want to give them burials on land . Meanwhile , the Finnish government has ordered the bow doors of similar ships cruising the Baltic welded shut , at least until the Estonia case is closed .</TEXT>
