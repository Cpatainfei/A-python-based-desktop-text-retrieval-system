   <TEXT> Eight-year-old David Manikian has a mutant gene -- a small bump on his X_chromosome that makes him different from other boys . When he was just a toddler , his parents noticed he was slow to learn . The wonders of modern genetic research revealed that David has Fragile X syndrome , a genetic_disorder that impairs mental development . But modern genetics was as much a curse as a blessing for this little boy , his parents and three sisters . Although it was a comfort to know what was wrong , the same sophisticated blood_test that identified David ' s condition cost this rural New Hampshire family their health_insurance after a clerk stumbled across the test results in the boy ' s files two years ago . David ' s mother , Jamie Stephenson , tried desperately to fight the cancellation . As a writer for a political_science quarterly and the wife of a dentist , Stephenson knows a little about health_care , and a lot about public policy . She bent the ears of anyone who would listen -- her state ' s assistant insurance commissioner , a disability rights lawyer and a U.S. senator . Fragile X is not a disease ; it is a developmental disorder , she told them . Besides , no one else in the family was affected . Surely , she insisted , the insurance_company could not do what it had done . &quot; Well , &quot; Stephenson recalled , &quot; everybody I contacted who was in any position of power said : ' They can do this . Our hands are tied. ' And then I was faced with the reality that we were not covered . And I had these four little children . We were without insurance for four months , four nail-biting months . It was summer . Every time I took my kids to the beach in the car , all I could think_of was , if we had a car accident , we would lose our home. &quot; The Manikian family finally got health_insurance , but only after four companies turned them down . Their experience highlights what may become the bitterest irony of the DNA revolution : genetic discrimination . If the Manikians were held hostage by heredity , they are not alone . Experts estimate that either as a result of sophisticated new genetic tests or a family history of inherited illness , thousands of Americans are being discriminated against because of something over which they have no control : their genes . Many insurers , observers say , do not want to take the risk of covering someone who may require expensive medical treatment and are laying bare their genetic biases . So too are employers and adoption agencies . All of this is occurring in a legislative vacuum ; because the issue is so fresh , only a_few states have laws barring genetic discrimination . And some predict that as genetic tests are developed for more diseases , the number of discrimination victims could explode in the not-too-distant future . As one bitterly complained : &quot; Your credit history has more protection than your medical history. &quot; Consider : * A Michigan market research analyst whose two brothers had colon_cancer decided to have a colonoscopy -- a test to see if she is at risk for the disease , which is known to run in families . Researchers recently pinpointed two genes that they believe cause the familial form of colon_cancer . The woman was tested several times . Each test came_back fine . But when she attempted to purchase health_insurance , she was turned_down -- the fact that she had been tested at all was a red flag . * A Louisiana couple had a child with cystic_fibrosis , a potentially fatal genetic_disorder that leads to chronic lung infections . When the wife became pregnant , prenatal testing revealed that the second baby carried a mutant gene associated with the disease . When the couple said they would have the baby anyway , their health_maintenance_organization told them it might not cover the pregnancy , and might also withdraw coverage for their first child . The couple threatened to sue ; their coverage remained intact . * An Arizona man was hired for a manufacturing job . During a physical examination , the company doctor asked about blood he spotted in the man ' s urine . The man said that years before , his family had been tested for Alport ' s syndrome , a genetic kidney disorder . Although he had been instructed to keep_an_eye_on his blood_pressure , he otherwise had no medical problems and was not sure if he had the disease . He lost his job . * An Indiana woman who is at risk for Huntington ' s disease , a degenerative brain disorder , did not want to take the chance of passing_on the Huntington ' s gene to another generation . She and her husband decided to adopt . They had completed counseling and were halfway through a pre-adoption home study when the agency they were working with asked them to withdraw because of her genetic history . &quot; Should I be judged by a disease that I am only at risk for and that may_not develop for some years to come ? &quot; she wrote in angry response to a survey conducted by researchers studying genetic discrimination . &quot; Does this make me any different than anyone with diabetes or cancer , for example , in their ancestry ? &quot; Dr. Paul R . Billings , clinical geneticist in Palo Alto who collected these and other case_histories , sees them as a troubling harbinger . Billings is one of a handful of geneticists who is studying genetic discrimination , particularly in health_insurance . He has been outspoken , calling not only for health_care reform but for laws to protect the privacy of genetic information . His work has not endeared him to his fellow scientists . &quot; A lot of them hate me for it , &quot; he said . &quot; It often gets portrayed that I am somehow trying to throw cold water on the explosion in genetic testing and genetic information , that I am trying to bring genetic research to a halt , which is complete bunk. &quot; Genetic research is proceeding at such a rapid clip that it would be nearly impossible to bring it to a halt . Over the last decade , using sophisticated techniques that allow them to examine DNA , scientists are isolating new genes faster than anyone can say &quot; deoxyribonucleic acid. &quot; Already , researchers have identified more_than 5 # 000 genes linked to specific disorders . Over the last five years , more_than 50 new tests for genetic conditions have been developed . At the National Institutes of Health , the genetic equivalent of Christopher Columbus ' voyage is under way as scientists race to map the entire genetic blueprint of the human_body . The Human Genome Project , a 15-year , $ 3-billion effort , is set for completion in 2005 . The research holds great promise for diagnosing , averting -- and , scientists hope , eventually curing -- myriad inherited afflictions . Already , the magic of genetics is changing lives . The incidence of Tay-Sachs disease , a fatal brain disorder common among Ashkenazi Jews , has declined more_than 90 % since 1971 , when genetic screening became available . So far , more_than 1 million people have taken tests for the disease , which occurs when both parents carry the Tay-Sachs gene and which usually kills children by age 3 . Many couples have terminated pregnancies to avoid bearing Tay-Sachs babies . And in a novel program run_by Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn and Israel , young people who are tested for the Tay-Sachs gene submit the results to a central registry . When they are dating or considering marriage , they can phone the registry to see if the match is compatible . Thus far , most conditions for which genes have been identified are , like Tay-Sachs , Huntington ' s disease and Fragile X syndrome , relatively rare . But researchers recently isolated two genes for colon_cancer , and they are closing_in on a gene for a highly hereditary form of breast_cancer . Experts warn that as genes are identified for such common illnesses , the general population could become a target of discrimination . &quot; We are at the watershed point , &quot; Billings said . &quot; We are at a point where the basic science is ( such ) that we are going_to see an explosion in genetic tests which are applicable to a large_number of people . Either this is going_to mean real improvements in people ' s health . . . or the incidence of discrimination , segregation and what I call mismanaged care will increase enormously. &quot; Martha Volner is health policy director for the Alliance of Genetic Support Groups , an umbrella organization that represents more_than 200 associations . She says there is a not-so-funny joke running_around the genetics community today : &quot; One day , we will come_to the point where only one person in the United States has insurance anymore , and the reason is he was the one person who had never been tested. &quot; It is black humor , she admits , but it may_not be too far from the truth . Scientists engaged in genetic research face a terrible irony : After painstaking years of laboratory work , their efforts might hurt the very people they are intended to help . For those at risk for a genetic_disease , the specter of discrimination creates an agonizing dilemma : to test or not to test ? Melissa Aylstock is a Roseville , Calif. , woman whose son has Klinefelter ' s syndrome , a chromosomal abnormality that gives boys the physical characteristics of girls and is often linked with mental_retardation . &quot; It ' s a Catch-22 , &quot; she said . &quot; If you don ' t find_out that your child has this , then you are not going_to get the services that you need . And if you do find_out , and your insurance cancels you , then you are not going_to get the services that you need. &quot; The Catch-22 is a frequent topic of discussion among genetics counselors , who make their living by advising people who are considering testing . Most tell clients to get their personal affairs in_order -- health and life_insurance , potential career moves -- before getting tested . They often suggest that patients keep insurers in the dark by paying_for tests themselves . One genetic counselor at Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center in Los Angeles describes an elaborate dance he performs with insurance_companies that ask_for too many details . He sends only a letter confirming that the patient had a genetic test . Never does he send medical_records containing results . &quot; When they say : ' I need more information in_order to pay this bill , ' I say : ' What information do you need ? ' &quot; said the counselor , who asked not to be identified . &quot; They say , ' Everybody else just sends us medical records. ' Well , if you send them medical_records , you are sending them a lot more information than they really need . They do not need to know what ' s going_on to pay the bill. &quot; Theresa Morelli , an Ohio civil_rights lawyer , has become a crusader for legislation to protect genetic privacy . She receives so many phone_calls from people who have lost health_insurance and other benefits as a result of genetic testing that she has taken_to calling herself &quot; the Ann Landers of genetic discrimination. &quot; &quot; I get_at least two calls or two letters a week from people all_over the world saying , ' This happened to me . What can I do about it ? ' &quot; she said . &quot; People come_up_to me in the grocery_store , the bank . One person told me she was going_to flee to Europe. &quot; But most do not want any publicity . They are afraid to talk openly about their genetic status . Morelli and others lament this reluctance , saying it contributes to a &quot; dirty little secret &quot; atmosphere reminiscent_of the days when people were afraid to talk_about cancer . &quot; When I need people to testify in front of the legislature , it ' s horrible , &quot; Morelli said . &quot; Most people refuse to go -- not that I blame them . They say , ' My employer will find_out . My family will find out. ' The trouble is that the legislators want to see faces . They think you ' re being anecdotal unless you present a_few horror stories. &quot; At the root of many of these &quot; horror stories , &quot; experts say , are deep misunderstandings about what genetic tests mean . Insurance carriers , and the public , equate having a gene for a certain disease with an automatic doomsday sentence . Often this is not the case . Like nearly everything else in life , illness can be a function of both nature and nurture . Genes can predispose people toward certain diseases , but lifestyle may play an equally important role . &quot; For most conditions where you find a genetic marker , you can ' t predict the severity of the disease or when the disease is going_to occur , &quot; said Jonathan Beckwith , a Harvard_University geneticist who advises the Human Genome Project on ethical issues . &quot; It is not precise information . And yet insurance_companies are already using that information to deny insurance or hike insurance rates. &quot; Universal access to health_insurance , the centerpiece of President Clinton ' s health_care reform plan , is one possible fix . In a report issued in May , Beckwith and other members of a group called the ELSI ( Ethical , Legal and Social Implications ) Committee of the Human Genome Project favored universal insurance , which would require insurers to provide coverage whatever a person ' s medical condition . But the ELSI group did not endorse the Clinton plan . State laws are another answer . In the absence of health_care reform , Ohio and Wisconsin have laws prohibiting health_insurance firms from using genetic information to deny medical coverage . California and New York have similar laws on the drawing boards . The Americans With Disabilities Act , adopted in 1990 , offers some protection against discrimination on_the_job , but Billings and others say it does not go_far enough . The insurance industry insists it has the right to use genetic information to deny applications for certain plans , particularly disability and life_insurance , where payouts are often large and where a purchaser may buy a policy knowing he or she has a serious genetic_disorder and will need to make a claim . The industry ' s response is less clear with_regard_to health_insurance . The Health_Insurance Assn . of America , an industry trade group , supports health reform and universal coverage -- a move that would effectively prevent companies from considering genetic information for health_insurance . But , spokesman Harvie Raymond said , the group opposes state laws that would do the same , on the grounds that they are premature and will only attack the problem in piecemeal fashion . Raymond said that until health reform is in place , his group believes it is &quot; inappropriate and unfair &quot; for insurers to be prevented from using genetic information in decision_making . Meanwhile , medical ethicists , geneticists and legislators are grappling with even stickier questions : Should genetic information be used to deny applications for disability plans or life_insurance , which are not considered as much of a &quot; right &quot; as medical coverage ? Should employers consider genetics when hiring ? Should adoption agencies use genetics in selecting prospective parents ? &quot; We are really looking_at the technology zooming ahead of public policy , &quot; said Nachama Wilker , executive_director of the Council for Responsible Genetics , a Boston-based group that is trying to draft laws to combat genetic discrimination . &quot; The big issues that are out_in front of us right now are : How is our society going_to deal with genetic information ? How important is it going_to become , and who is going_to have access to it ? &quot; In New Hampshire , Jamie Stephenson is asking herself the same questions . She worries , in particular , about her daughters , ages 6 , 10 and 12 . They , too , carry the mutant gene for Fragile X syndrome , although their sex spares them the condition . ( Unlike boys , who carry one X and one Y_chromosome , girls have two X_chromosomes , which enables the chromosome with &quot; good &quot; genes to cancel_out the bad. ) &quot; My daughters have this on their medical_records , &quot; Stephenson said . &quot; What ' s going_to happen to them when they become adults and they try to get jobs , or health_insurance ? &quot; She remembers a conversation she had with Nobel laureate James Watson , former head of the Human Genome Project who , as co-discoverer of the structure of DNA , helped spawn the genetic revolution . She met him at a conference on the science of genetics , and when she asked him about the future , the picture he painted was bleak . &quot; He said he fears a new underclass evolving of people with genetic conditions who are going_to be discriminated against , just like people with the wrong skin_color used to be discriminated against , &quot; Stephenson recalled . &quot; Is this what my daughters will be ? When they get_to be adults , are they going_to be the new underclass ? &quot; NEXT : How insurance_companies decide what to cover . Testing Genes Once scientists discover a defective gene that causes disease , they are able to test for it . Since the late 1980s , more_than 50 new genetic tests have been developed . Some can be done prenatally , or almost immediately after a baby is born . Here is a partial list of genetic_disorders for which tests are available : * Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( Lou Gehrig ' s disease ) . A degenerative disease of the nervous_system . * Beta-thalassemia . Prevalent in the Mediterranean , the Middle_East and Southeast_Asia . Causes a breakup of the red_blood_cells , leading to anemia , spleen enlargement and sometimes abnormal growth of bones . Fatal in early_childhood if untreated . * Charcot Marie-Tooth disease . Causes foot and hand deformities . * Cystic fibrosis . The most common lethal genetic defect , causing chronic lung infections and an inability to absorb fats and other nutrients . * Duchenne muscular_dystrophy . Major form of muscular_dystrophy in children , which causes progressive degeneration of the muscle_fibers . * Fragile X syndrome . Chromosomal disorder causing mental impairment , ranging from subtle learning disabilities to severe retardation and autism . Symptoms are generally more pronounced in boys . * Gaucher ' s disease . A disorder common to Ashkenazi Jews . The most severe form appears in infancy , causes central_nervous_system impairment and death within the first year . * Huntington ' s disease . A degenerative brain disorder . * Marfan syndrome . Disease of the connective_tissue that often strikes athletes . * Myotonic dystrophy : Most common form of muscular_dystrophy in adults . * Retinoblastoma . Inherited eye tumors in children . * Tay-Sachs disease . A brain disorder common among Ashkenazi Jews . Causes death in early_childhood . * Coming soon : A genetic test for familial colon_cancer . Researchers recently identified two genes that account_for more_than 90 % of this inherited form of cancer .</TEXT>
