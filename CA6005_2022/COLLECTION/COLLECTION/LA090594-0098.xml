   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : TEAM STUMBLES UPON WINNING PROMOTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sunday afternoon , somewhat earlier than expected , the Rams moved . They twitched . They stirred . They showed a heartbeat and a blip of brain activity and a will to do something -- do anything -- besides mope_around the homestead for another four wasted months , waiting for the vans to come and cart them away . You ' ve heard and read about the various potential destinations . Baltimore . St . Louis . Hartford . No one ever mentioned first place , which is where the Rams incredibly sit today -- in sole possession , at least for the last remaining hours before the 49ers kick_off -- for the first time since October , 1989 . The Rams won their season opener Sunday , another franchise first since 1989 . They did so by beating the Arizona Cardinals and Buddy Ryan , 14-12 , in the kind of performance that might not win them many new fans , but could go a ways toward luring back the old ones . &quot; Our fans are going_to come_back and support us , &quot; insisted Ram tailback Jerome Bettis , whose historic game-winning touchdown plunge wasn ' t witnessed by many , just 32 # 969 , barely more_than the recently skinned Pigskin Classic . &quot; We ' ve been losing , but our fans have got_to come_back to us . They ' ve got_to come_back to us , so we can pull this thing off. &quot; Keeping the Rams in Anaheim is the thing , last-ditch and desperate as it may be . Stranger things have happened , no doubt , although one fails to come_to_mind at the moment . If there ' s a chance , even one in 10 # 000 , it begins here , on the floor and in the stands of Anaheim Stadium , where the Rams and their fans have disappointed one another for so_long . The credibility chasm between this team and Orange County wasn ' t created overnight . There ' s only one way to bridge it , to abridge it , and if you don ' t know the word for it , Bettis will spot you the first letter . &quot; It ' s a W , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s the bottom_line . We needed a W , and we got it. &quot; Win . What a concept . For the first time on an opening Sunday this decade the Rams tried it , and their jaws dropped at the consequences . Fans standing on their feet , shouting and begging for hand slaps instead of dumping their beer on the Rams as they jog through the north tunnel . Fans standing on their feet after the sound of the final gun , instead of cruising the diamond lane on the southbound 55 . It was a rare glimpse of life on the other side , and for the Rams , free again to leave the field without their helmets buckled up , it felt good . Chuck Knox , unprompted , began shaking writers ' hands as he walked_out_of his postgame news_conference . His voice was shaking and his eyes were moist . For Knox , this was the equivalent of ripping_off his shirt , throwing his shoes into the whirlpool and turning cartwheels in the trainer ' s room . &quot; I ' m more excited about this one than I ' ve been in a long_time , &quot; Knox said , which was obvious . &quot; There ' s been a lot to overcome around here and those guys in there did_it . that ' s why I ' m so proud_of them. &quot; Knox , much like his team , has been rumored to be out the door any minute . Win or else is not the predicament facing him . Win and even that might not be enough is closer to_the_point . If the Rams relocate , the thinking goes , they are going_to want to start anew , beginning from the top on down . &quot; This was big for Chuck , &quot; said Chris Miller , the Rams ' new quarterback . &quot; Definitely big for Chuck . He came_in here after the game with a lot of excitement . He was very animated. &quot; Joe Vitt , Ram assistant head coach and staunch Knox disciple , bristled , however , at this line of conversation . &quot; Chuck ' s been there before , &quot; Vitt said . &quot; It ' s not like this is the first win Chuck has ever had . &quot; Chuck is going_to make the Hall_of_Fame a lot quicker than Buddy Ryan is . I ' ve been with Chuck 11 years and every program he ' s had , he ' s turned around. &quot; And the &quot; Chuck ' s Last Stand &quot; headlines ? &quot; that ' s headlines in this town , &quot; Vitt snapped . &quot; People around the league and our players know that Chuck has done_it everywhere he ' s ever been . This is the best talent level he ' s had here in three years . &quot; Out of the 28 coaches in this league , he ' s still the best , in my opinion , to work for. &quot; And so what if this victory parade teetered on an overthrown two-point conversion attempt by Cardinal quarterback Steve Beuerlein . . . and a certain touchdown bomb that trickled through the hands of Cardinal wide receiver Ricky Proehl . . . and a Cardinal punt with three minutes left that was fumbled by one Bailey , Johnny , and fortuitously recovered by another , Robert ? &quot; that ' s football , &quot; Knox said . &quot; You coach long enough , you ' re going to see plays like that . Some go_for you , some go_against you . The bottom_line is , we won the game. &quot; Miller , who completed just six of 16 passes in his Ram debut , yet left the field laughing and flipping the football end over end with his right_hand , put it more colorfully : &quot; That wasn ' t the prettiest thing in the world . That wasn ' t a Rembrandt . But burn that S.O.B. We won the ballgame. &quot; Dozens of Ram fans saw it , too . Maybe they ' ll tell a friend . Maybe this is the first_step on_the_road to recovering the Orange County Rams . Beat Buddy Day , followed in two weeks by Bring A Buddy Day .</TEXT>
