   <HEADLINE> SHADOW OF ANOTHER FAMINE BRINGS APPEALS BY ETHIOPIA ; AFRICA : RELIEF SPECIALISTS WELCOME GOVERNMENT ' S CANDOR BUT THINK CALLS MAY BE PREMATURE , MISLEADING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The shadow of famine again hangs over East Africa : In nine countries from Djibouti to Rwanda , 20 million people are at risk , relief agencies say , and international donors are scrambling to meet emergency needs for food . But there is disagreement in the international community over how advanced the threat is . Some relief specialists believe that Ethiopia ' s call_for help -- originally made last December and repeated often since -- may have been premature and could obscure the fact that any widespread danger is likely to occur in 1995 , not 1994 . &quot; The government has been very open , and that ' s greatly welcome , &quot; said Mark Bidder , deputy coordinator for the U.N. Development Program . &quot; There is a feeling , though , it may have gone a little overboard . It hasn ' t made a mountain out of a molehill , but it ' s made one out of a hill . We ' re not in a crisis yet. &quot; Bidder said if this summer ' s rains are inadequate , it is possible the current drought could turn_into a famine of epoch proportions , such_as the one in 1984 , centered in Ethiopia ' s Wollo province . That famine claimed hundreds of thousands of lives in the Horn of Africa . But after an ample harvest in 1992 , sufficient rains between now and September could alleviate the likelihood of massive starvation , he said . Drought is a recurring curse in the Horn of Africa , and in Ethiopia ' s rural provinces north and south of Addis Ababa , people live_on the edge of survival even in years of bountiful harvests . Though fertile , the land is so intensely cultivated and deforested that people there have little hope of ever escaping the peril of malnutrition and the need for emergency supplies of wheat , soybeans and maize , agricultural experts said . The Ethiopian government ' s candor in calling attention to the early warnings of famine -- the death of children in Bele , the airdrop of grain in Oromiya , bureaucratic bottlenecks that have delayed food shipments for months for lack of an official signature -- is a dramatic departure from how two previous governments in Addis Ababa treated full-blown disasters . When drought swept Wollo province in 1973 , Emperor Haile Selassie , 81 , tried to keep the disaster a secret , unwilling to admit that he was unable to care_for his people . While the death toll crept toward 200 # 000 , Selassie was photographed in the splendor of his palace tossing scraps of fresh meat to his two Great Danes . The picture caused a national scandal , and Selassie was overthrown within the year by a group of enlisted men , ending a 44-year reign . The leader of the group , Mengistu Haile Mariam , courted disaster in 1984 when he denied the existence of famine that had claimed many thousands of lives . At the height of the calamity , he spent millions of dollars on a huge celebration marking the anniversary of his Marxist revolution . Later , finally acknowledging the famine , he used food as a weapon , refusing to let relief agencies feed Ethiopians in regions controlled by anti-government forces . Mengistu was overthrown in 1991 . Since the 1984 famine , the international community has changed its emphasis in Africa from disaster response to crisis prevention . &quot; Any development program these days that doesn ' t have the word sustainable on every page has no chance of getting_off_the_ground , &quot; a U.N. official in Eritrea said . But escaping Africa ' s morass of man-made disasters that foster famine has not been easy . J . Brian Atwood , head of the U.S. Agency for International Development , said here last month that about one-third of those facing food shortages in East Africa were at risk because of wars , primarily in Sudan , Somalia and Rwanda . Internal insecurity also threatens the delivery of food in parts of Kenya and Djibouti . Atwood ' s mission to assess food needs in East Africa was made at the request of President Clinton , U.S. diplomats said , and was intended in part to help three governments -- in Ethiopia , Eritrea and Uganda -- avoid crises that could threaten national stability . All three have adopted pragmatic economic_policies and have been helpful in mediating regional conflicts . But with the Cold_War over , Atwood ' s mission came at a time when Western governments are shifting developmental funds from Africa to Eastern Europe . Questions are also being raised about the usefulness of pouring countless dollars into countries whose leaders are required to provide little accountability . U.S. aid to Kenya , for example , has been cut about in half , to $ 18 million . In southern Sudan , a region racked by war and starvation and ruled by an uncompromising Islamic fundamentalist government , the U.S. bill for emergency aid last year reached $ 350 million and &quot; probably didn ' t achieve anything , &quot; an American aid official in Kenya said . Washington also spent $ 1.5 billion trying to halt starvation and anarchy in Somalia . It was forced to retreat after Somali clans turned_on U.S. soldiers .</TEXT>
