   <HEADLINE> ECONOMICS ; UNEMPLOYMENT RAVAGES NATIONS ON GLOBAL SCALE ; U.N. REPORT SHOWS JOBLESS RATES AT THEIR HIGHEST IN DECADES . BUT ASIAN ECONOMIES DEFY THE BLEAK ASSESSMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Whether rich or poor , almost every government on Earth reigns over an economy that fails at supplying enough jobs to reduce the dispiriting and growing numbers of men and women without work . The only exceptions are the newly flush lands of Asia . &quot; More people are out_of_work than ever before , &quot; reports the International_Labor_Organization , a U.N. agency , &quot; and there is widespread anxiety that these numbers will grow. &quot; ILO , surveying the world , reported recently that the industrialized countries -- Western Europe , the United States , Canada , Australia and Japan -- have unemployment_rates &quot; at their highest levels since the Great Depression &quot; of the 1930s . At the end of 1994 , the agency predicted , 35 million people will be out_of_work in these industrialized countries , an unemployment_rate of 8.6 % . To make matters worse , an increasing number of the unemployed are finding no work for more_than a year . In Italy , Belgium and Ireland , more_than 60 % of the unemployed are such long-termers . &quot; When people are out_of_work for more_than a year , &quot; the ILO report says , &quot; they lose skills and work habits and cease to be attractive to employers. &quot; Russia and Eastern Europe , transforming themselves from communism to capitalism , are suffering massive job losses , the report said . ILO , in fact , says it does not believe official figures that show the unemployment_rate in Russia at less than 1 % . The countries of the former Soviet_Union probably have an unemployment_rate of more_than 10 % , it asserts . &quot; The worst aspect of the economic restructuring is the appalling growth in the number of people living_in poverty , &quot; ILO says , estimating the number of poor in the former Soviet_Union at 100 million at the end of 1991 . Latin_America , while improving , still has unemployment_rates worse than in the 1970s . ILO says there has been a disturbing increase in the number of what it called &quot; precarious &quot; workers -- part-time , poorly paid laborers -- in picking and processing coffee , sugar_cane , cotton , fruit and vegetables for export . Africa is in a woeful state : The number of those without work is ballooning and the wages of those with work plummeting . During the 1980s , wages dropped_by 70 % in Tanzania and 40 % in Kenya . Unprotected by government safety nets , millions of urban Africans survive by living_off relatives in the bush or working in what academics call &quot; the informal economy &quot; -- selling matches , chewing gum and other petty goods on street_corners , guarding cars for tips and begging . ILO suggested three causes for the worldwide malaise : * The decline in economic_growth rates since the first &quot; oil shock &quot; of 1973 , especially among the industrialized countries , which account_for 75 % of the world ' s gross_domestic_product . * &quot; A veritable technological_revolution &quot; in such fields as microelectronics , computer_science , telecommunications and transportation . ILO said this revolution makes_it easy for companies to operate swiftly in any part of the world , thus intensifying worldwide economic competition . To meet this competition , large corporations are slimming down , eliminating well-paying jobs . * Failure of government policies : overprotection of the economies in the 1970s , a swing too far in the opposite direction toward a liberal free market in the 1980s and the imposition of tight_money policies on debtor Third_World countries that proved of little benefit . The striking exceptions to this barren landscape are Singapore , Hong Kong , Taiwan , South_Korea , Malaysia and Thailand . ILO , though not wildly optimistic , believes that their success may point a way_out for the others . Most important of what ILO calls &quot; pointers to possible solutions &quot; is that these countries welcomed foreign investment and foreign know-how to a free market at a time when most other developing countries were trying to protect non-competitive domestic industries with a tariff wall . &quot; The basic strategy followed by the East and Southeast Asian economies , &quot; the report says , &quot; was the antithesis of the protectionist and interventionist policies followed by many developing countries in the 1970s. &quot; To make their economies more competitive , the Asian governments invested heavily in infrastructure and education . &quot; No less important were policies to reduce poverty , since the poor have never been an asset in international competition , &quot; ILO says . A World of Job Woes &quot; More people are out_of_work than ever before , &quot; reports the International_Labor_Organization , a U.N. agency . Among its findings : Latin_America , while improving , still has unemployment_rates worse than in the 1970s . In Ireland and Italy , 60 % of jobless are long-termers . The number of those without work in Africa is ballooning and the wages of those with work plummeting . Countries of the former Soviet_Union probably have an unemployment_rate of more_than 10 % . South_Korea and Singapore are among nations where outlook is improving . Source : International_Labor_Organization</TEXT>
