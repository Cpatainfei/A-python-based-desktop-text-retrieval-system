   <HEADLINE> IN HONOR OF SERVICE PAST ; THOUSANDS PAY HOMAGE TO U.S. VETERANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sarah Mounsey stared at the memorial plaque at her feet and began to cry . &quot; that ' s my son ' s name there , but I still don ' t understand why , &quot; she said . &quot; If he were here right now he ' d say , ' Why all this for me ? ' And then he ' d laugh . He always laughed. &quot; Culver City Park was touched with fond laughter and sad tears Friday as more_than 100 people -- including Rep . Julian C . Dixon ( D-Los Angeles ) , representatives of the United States military and French veterans -- honored Erik Scott Mounsey , pilot of a Black Hawk helicopter shot down April 14 over Iraq . The gathering in Culver City was one of scores in Southern California as thousands of Americans turned_out nationwide to honor those who served -- and gave their lives -- in military_service . Mounsey was one of those who did both . He was one of 26 people -- 11 of them foreign officers -- who died when an American F-15 fighter_pilot shot down two U.S. Army helicopters in the mistaken belief that the aircraft were Russian-built Hind helicopters flown_by the Iraqi military . Though a missing-man formation and 21-gun salute in Culver City seemed a fitting tribute to Mounsey and his comrades , that outpouring from the American military Establishment -- highly unusual for such a small , local event -- tinged the day with irony . Despite charging the fighter_pilot with negligent homicide , military officials in Washington have brushed_aside the pleas of Mounsey ' s widow to increase her spousal death_benefits and award Purple_Hearts to the soldiers who died in the Black Hawk crashes . For most of those honored Friday , the tributes were given without reservation . Among those remembered in other ceremonies were the Buffalo Soldiers of the Wild_West and the Tuskegee Airmen of World_War_II -- two of this nation ' s most distinguished black fighting units . The Pasadena Chamber_of_Commerce and Civil Assn . paid homage to both groups with a color-guard military_ceremony , complete with a horse_cavalry demonstration and a missing-man formation flyover . The 19th-Century cavalry soldiers are long gone_by now , but many of the fighter_pilots survive . Former fighter-escort pilot Carl Fountain , 72 , remembers the racial_segregation that kept him and his fellows from serving in regular units : &quot; At that time , people did not think a black_man had the ability to power an aircraft , &quot; he said . The &quot; noble experiment &quot; -- during which the squadrons they escorted never lost a single bomber -- &quot; proved that the black_man is just as capable as any other person , &quot; Fountain said . In Buena Park , somber veterans found the names of lost comrades on a replica of the Vietnam_War Memorial in Washington . &quot; I miss them a lot , &quot; said Daniel Valesquez , fighting_back tears as he read the names of five of his friends . &quot; It just hits me . I ' m here and they ' re not. &quot; &quot; It ' s hard for an old vet , &quot; said Charlotte Best , who served in the Korean_War , as she gazed at the movable replica parked outside Knott ' s Berry Farm . &quot; Everybody who comes here has somebody here. &quot; At Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in the Hollywood Hills , about 300 veterans gathered to the patriotic strains of a high_school marching band and the echoing volleys of a rifle salute . Compared to years past , when more_than 1 # 000 showed_up on Veterans Day , it was a relatively poor turnout . &quot; We ' ve got a younger generation now that doesn ' t remember all this stuff , &quot; said World_War_II veteran James Brickley . &quot; They just shove it off as another holiday , another day_off from work . Art Ocampo , another World_War_II veteran who spent Friday morning at Forest Lawn , remembers . He remembers Guam -- what it looked_like , what it smelled like , who was around . But mostly , he remembers Don Jones . And he remembers Jones ' family in Texas , when he went_to see them afterward . How they cried . &quot; He died right in front of us , &quot; caught in an ambush when a group of soldiers went_out looking_for souvenirs , Ocampo said . Another visitor at Forest Lawn , Clarence Betler , was born 100 years ago in May , into a nation beginning to heal from the nightmare of the Civil War . By the time he was called to serve in World_War I , the United States already had won Puerto Rico from Spain in the Spanish-American War , and his century of life has included four wars more . &quot; All these wars don ' t do any good , &quot; he said Friday . &quot; They still have wars , and I don ' t know why. &quot; Times staff writers Sharon Bernstein and Ching-Ching Ni contributed to this story .
