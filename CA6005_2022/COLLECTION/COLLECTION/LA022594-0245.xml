   <HEADLINE> AFTER YEAR , SOUTH_KOREA ' S LEADERSHIP IS DIFFERENT YET STRANGELY FAMILIAR ; ASIA : FIRST CIVILIAN PRESIDENT IN DECADES HAS PUSHED HUMAN_RIGHTS . YET LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR , HE STILL RULES BY DECREE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kim Young Sam , South_Korea ' s first civilian president in three decades , today marks a year in office that has brought a once authoritarian nation to its highest level of human_rights and its government to a peak of popularity . Yet even as they acknowledge the gains , observers point_out an irony : Kim has been ruling largely by presidential decree -- not all that differently from the late President Park Chung Hee , a general who took power in a 1961 coup and introduced authoritarianism to South_Korea in 1971 when he made himself president for life . &quot; The style is the same . The content is entirely different , &quot; says Rev . Kim Kwan Suk , a retired president of the Christian Broadcasting System . Han Sang Jin , a Seoul National University professor of sociology , agrees . &quot; The power has been concentrated too_much in President Kim , &quot; he says . &quot; If President Kim disappeared , I would guess that all_of the reforms would collapse . I don ' t see any forces that could continue them . &quot; The present situation is not as solid as foreign observers think , &quot; Han adds . &quot; We are far from achieving the consolidation of democratic institutions. &quot; Asked their opinion of a post-Kim era , three Western diplomats responded in unison : &quot; It would depend_on who takes over. &quot; Prof . Rhee Sang Woo of Sogang University , who is a frequent consultant to the government , argues that there is a significant difference between Kim and his military predecessors . &quot; The fundamental difference is that the Korean people , including the opposition , accept the Kim administration as a genuinely democratic government , &quot; Rhee says . A poll published by the newspaper Joong-Ang on Thursday found 62.3 % of the people support Kim , while only 9.4 % do not . The others had no opinion or said they neither supported nor opposed him . Nonetheless , Robert A . Scalapino , professor of government emeritus at UC Berkeley , says Asian political_systems , including South_Korea ' s , suffer a &quot; uniformly weak . . . institutional base . Hence the dependence upon personalities is great. &quot; That is certainly true for Kim Young Sam . Like Park , he has become a giant tree : Nothing is growing in his shade . &quot; The machinery of democracy has not been established , &quot; says Gene Matthews , a longtime Methodist missionary here . The nation ' s political_parties remain moribund , unable either to generate policies or nurture new leaders . There is even doubt whether the parties will remain intact until the next presidential election in 1997 . The National Assembly still acts largely as a rubber_stamp . Even Korean ideological and cultural ethics have worked against institutionalizing democracy . According to this year ' s U.S. State_Department human_rights report on South_Korea , &quot; the government ' s indirect influence on the media remains considerable , &quot; with many journalists practicing &quot; some degree of self-censorship to advance their careers. &quot; Government payments to reporters &quot; have been curtailed but not halted completely , &quot; it adds . A national security law designed to thwart subversion by pro-Communist North_Korea elements is still used &quot; to violate the freedom of expression , association and travel , &quot; the U.S. report declares . Prior censorship of the arts still remains in_force . A ban on broadcast of Japanese movies and music lingers on nearly half a century after the end of the 1910-45 Japanese colonial rule . Laws that violate the standards of the International_Labor_Organization , to which South_Korea belongs , have not been changed because of such Confucian beliefs that teachers belong_to a sacrosanct profession and should not organize unions , Labor Minister Nam Jae Hee says . &quot; My headache is how to compromise the ILO standards with Korean realities , &quot; Nam says . &quot; We are not accustomed to the union activities of advanced countries. &quot; And a &quot; curfew &quot; that has been in_effect since 1945 for all but the pre-1988 Olympic period is still enforced only by a government edict . In its form now , Koreans are allowed to stay out all night , but bars and restaurants must close at midnight . Kim amended it -- again by decree -- to allow 41 specific bars and restaurants that cater to foreigners to operate until 2 a.m. The National Assembly has never voted on the issue . &quot; Most people don ' t feel affected by these undemocratic practices , &quot; Rev . Kim says . &quot; A system of democratic cultural values is not deeply rooted . Our traditional political culture emphasizes the wholeness of national identity &quot; over individual rights . Kim ' s predecessor , Roh Tae Woo , another ex-general , deserves much of the credit for ending authoritarian rule and carrying_out a 1987 election pledge to &quot; democratize &quot; the country . Roh ' s greatest achievement may have been completing the transition from military to civilian rule by persuading Kim , who had spent three decades in the opposition , to join forces with him in 1990 . Roh then anointed Kim his successor . But Kim promised to go further . In his inauguration speech , he declared that his administration will &quot; open a new era of democracy under civilian government. &quot; &quot; The government that serves you from today will be a different kind of government &quot; -- one that will produce &quot; a freer and more mature democratic society , &quot; a higher_quality of life , a respect for the dignity of individuals and a presidential office that &quot; will be your good neighbor , &quot; he said in that speech . Except for the old Establishment , Kim ' s reforms have drawn praise bordering_on awe . Kim has ended three decades of political intervention and manipulation by the Korean CIA , now euphemistically called the National Security Planning Agency . He ousted a clique of more_than 60 politically minded generals from the army . For the first time , the National Assembly has been empowered to examine the KCIA ' s budget and oversee its activities . In South_Korea , these are rated as epochal accomplishments . &quot; I never expected President Kim to accomplish such a feat as eliminating that clique of generals . . . . I compliment him without reservation , &quot; says Park Kwon Sang , a commentator who was ousted as editor of the daily Dong-A Ilbo in the wake of a 1980 coup by Maj . Gen . Chun Doo Hwan . &quot; Before President Kim , I always got calls from the Korean CIA and the police -- if only to maintain contact , &quot; Rev . Kim says . The notorious Defense Security Command , through which both Chun and Roh advanced to the top , was also downgraded and prohibited from conducting surveillance on civilians . &quot; The coup watch is over , &quot; one of the Western diplomats says . But while surveillance has ended , reports persist that government_agencies are still eavesdropping and bugging telephones without warrants , Kim says . Human_rights advocate Kim Keun Tae , whose most recent imprisonment came under Roh , says about 300 political_prisoners remain in jail . ( The U.S. human_rights report put the number at &quot; well under 100 , &quot; excluding persons jailed for committing violent acts while expressing opinions. ) The U.S. report focused_on two steps taken by the president as &quot; democratic institutional reforms of historic nature. &quot; One was presidential jawboning -- followed by enactment of an &quot; ethics law &quot; -- requiring all high-level officials and politicians to reveal their family ' s personal assets . Hundreds of politicians , judges , prosecutors , policemen , generals and high officials with questionable fortunes were forced_out of office . The other was a decree requiring all financial transactions to be carried_out under real names , rather than aliases . It was designed to thwart funds for bribery and tax_evasion . Although few charges were filed and no one was asked to give_up any illicit earnings , the public was delighted by the sense of economic revenge and justice that both actions created . In addition , the courts , once under_the_thumb_of the president , also &quot; are moving strongly toward establishing an independent judiciary , &quot; says Matthews , the missionary . The scene is not all rosy , however . Union membership , which shot_up after Roh ' s promise of democratization in 1987 , is now falling . Labor strife continues on a much-reduced scale but is still regarded_as a potential threat to economic progress . Nor have student radicals faded_away . But democracy is no longer an issue that draws any support for anti-government demonstrations from average students , Prof . Han says . Many Koreans forgive Kim for his authoritarian approach to implementing reforms because , they say , it is the only possible course . His own followers remain a minority in the ruling Democratic Liberal_Party that is dominated by backers of Roh and Chun . &quot; If he tries to compromise , he can ' t have reform , &quot; Labor Minister Nam says . &quot; Only by using public_opinion has President Kim overpowered his ruling party opponents. &quot; The government itself has recognized its shortcomings . &quot; Despite its considerable results , the reform drive during the past year can hardly be said to have met the people ' s expectations , &quot; Prime_Minister Lee Hoi Chang said in a speech to the National Assembly on Feb . 16 . Henceforth , the government will concentrate_on institutional reform and enactment of Kim ' s reform policies into law , he added . Several planned major reforms also remain to be carried_out . In its first attempt to write legislation on its own , the National Assembly is now trying to work_out new election laws to slash campaign spending . Once that is accomplished , the last major piece in the planned framework of democracy -- Korea ' s first election of governors and mayors since 1960 -- is scheduled for next year . Those elections , Prof . Rhee says , may produce a desperately needed new platform for the emergence of new leaders not hand-picked by the president . They may also spur reform in both ruling and opposition parties . But they will also constitute a high risk to Kim ' s own standing , he says . For example , an elected mayor of Seoul , a city of 12 million , or more_than a quarter of all South_Koreans , is expected to exercise power rivaling that of the president . Despite Kim ' s own popularity , this is a race that the ruling party , which has usually fared poorly in the nation ' s capital , might lose . &quot; The single issue of democracy will not be the determining factor for Kim ' s support , &quot; Rev . Kim says . Although the economy appears to be turning upward again , rapid inflation poses an emerging danger . The president ' s opening of the Korean rice market to foreign imports and his handling of the North_Korean nuclear issue have already lowered his support ratings , Rev . Kim adds . &quot; It will be very difficult for him to maintain his popularity of the last year , &quot; Rev . Kim says . But in historic terms , if the president continues his reforms successfully , Matthews says , Kim could become the first president in South_Korea ' s history to go_into retirement &quot; looking good and retaining a lot of credibility. &quot;</TEXT>
