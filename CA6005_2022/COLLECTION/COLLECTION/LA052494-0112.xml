   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ; OUT OF EXILE , PALESTINIANS PACK IN TUNISIA ; THE SOUND OF CLOSURE HERE IS THE CLICK OF SUITCASES AS PLO OFFICIALS PREPARE TO RETURN TO GAZA AND JERICHO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A blustery wind pushed_through the broken arches that were the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization ' s elite Force 17 security unit before it blew apart one October morning in a booming ballet of flying stones and bodies afire , propelled into history and the blinding turquoise of the Mediterranean_Sea . Not far away an amiable sheep poked its nose among the graves of some of the 70 men who died that day in 1985 when a fleet of Israeli warplanes , dispatched by then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres and his defense minister , Yitzhak Rabin , hit the PLO ' s headquarters-in-exile in Tunisia . &quot; We knew what was happening , &quot; recalled Ahmed Abdul Karim Hih , a senior diplomat in the PLO foreign ministry who helped Chairman Yasser Arafat pull bodies from the rubble . &quot; We can recognize the sound of Israeli aircraft like music. &quot; The attack at Hammam-Shat came barely three years into the PLO ' s 12-year exile in this remote North African outpost , a period that has seen the assassination of Arafat ' s two top lieutenants and , on the stage of history , the journey of a straggling band of defeated commandos in Lebanon on_the_road to peace with Israel . Now , Israeli journalists broadcast interviews with PLO leaders from the Tunis Hilton and drive_out to see the place where Israeli commandos gunned_down Khalil Wazir ( Abu Jihad ) , Arafat ' s second-in-command , in his bedroom in a whitewash-and-cobblestone suburb of Tunis in the middle of the night in 1988 . And the PLO , the nomadic revolutionary movement that has carried its guns and angry posters in exile from Jordan to Lebanon to Tunisia , is preparing to make the most important journey of all : the voyage home . The first elements , PLO police , are already in place . As all but a_few of the PLO ' s departments anticipate moving to Jericho and the Gaza Strip in coming weeks with the beginning of Palestinian self-rule , Palestinian officials and employees all_over Tunis are packing , drawing_up lists of who stays and who goes , and preparing_for another uncertain future . &quot; The whole operation is like a huge jump in the air , &quot; one senior PLO official said . &quot; And for that , there are many things people are not sure of . Will they live well when they go_to Gaza ? Will they have jobs ? Some of them are hesitating. &quot; The Al-Quds school near the Tunis airport , which has educated a generation of young Palestinian exiles in mathematics , Arabic and the geography of a nonexistent country called Palestine , moved_up its year-end exam schedule and plans to close its doors forever . The Palestinian news_agency WAFA is negotiating with Italy to build a $ 3-million news-gathering facility in Jericho in coming weeks . The social_affairs , information , education , cultural affairs and economics_departments are all moving within a month . Staying behind in Tunis will be the political department , the equivalent of the PLO ' s foreign ministry , to oversee the Palestinians ' more_than 90 embassies and offices around the world ; the international relations department , whose operations inside the territories are barred by the autonomy accords , and the office overseeing Palestinian refugees around the world . The upcoming exodus has generated a whole new jockeying for position within the politically tumultuous organization and a re-evaluation of commitment to a revolution that is entering a new phase . &quot; It will be a different life , &quot; one longtime Arafat adviser said . &quot; For those who were fighters or militants , they move to a question , a very hard question , for the first time in 30 years . And don ' t forget some of them began at 20 years old , and now they are near 55 . They are ready to retire . You want to be sure that if they are going inside that they will be effective . If so , they go . If not , they will be in a very hard place. &quot; One young former fighter -- who wandered with the Palestine Liberation Army from Lebanon to Iraq , Libya , Yemen and finally Tunis , where he signed_on as a bodyguard and office manager for a top PLO official -- has married a Tunisian woman and decided he will stay behind . &quot; I was a child and I didn ' t see Palestine , but when my father and grandfather would speak about Palestine , I loved Palestine . When I came_to the revolution , I loved Palestine more and more , so we kept fighting , and it got_in my blood , and I became used to the PLO , &quot; he said , talking quietly in a deserted Tunis villa . &quot; Over the years I tried to leave the revolution , but I couldn ' t . But you know , when I woke_up , I found my age going_on 31 years . I ' m thinking , my father was 31 , he had 10 children. &quot; * that ' s when he decided not to join the Palestinian police_force moving_into Gaza and Jericho . &quot; Now the time is a time of peace . . . . There are no fights . You have to look_for yourself , &quot; he said . &quot; I gave enough . I will leave it to the other children. &quot; Most PLO families worry that with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians already tightly packed into the rundown housing of the Gaza Strip , there will be nowhere for them to live when they start arriving in the weeks ahead . &quot; I haven ' t any family to live with there , and of course I ' m worried , &quot; said Mohammed Abdullah , a teacher at the Al-Quds school who will move to Gaza with his wife and four children . &quot; But we have to wait to achieve some of our hopes . Everything is still unknown , but we hope there will be some financial_aid and we can build new homes and more facilities and improve our lives . Life is good here in Tunis , but suppose each one he lives_in paradise , he will not feel happy because he is attached_to his homeland. &quot; At a high-rise apartment complex near the outskirts of Tunis , Bizyada abu Youssef , exiled from the Gaza Strip , runs_out to her balcony and hauls in a folded tent , her most important preparation for the move to Gaza with her husband , an administrator in the PLO education_department . As she sits in her elegantly furnished apartment , she begins to cry as she recounts the family ' s journey in 1948 from their home_in Beersheba to a refugee camp in Gaza with the creation of the state of Israel . From there , they moved to the Arabian Gulf state of Qatar and lived comfortably until the outbreak of the Persian_Gulf_War , when all Palestinians were expelled . They washed_up in Tunis and began furnishing this apartment . Bizyada says she began growing the philodendron that has now stretched across the ceiling and walls of the living room . &quot; In Qatar we were expelled ; we left three cars without selling them . They ordered us to leave within 72 hours . We left half our clothes there and all our belongings , &quot; she says , her voice shaking as she points to the vine . &quot; I grew this tree as you would grow a child . And now I ' m forced to leave it . In every country , I am forced to grow , to buy and finally to leave . . . . We hope , God willing , this is the last time. &quot; Diplomatic sources say only about 500 to 600 names are_on the tentative list of PLO employees to go_to Gaza and Jericho , out of about 1 # 000 PLO employees in Tunis . PLO officials say up_to 85 % of those in Tunis will go and that jobs will be provided in the autonomy zones for anyone who doesn ' t want to stay behind or who isn ' t attached_to a department remaining in Tunis . * That remains to be seen . &quot; Everybody is worried about the future . The future of the people , and the future of the PLO . From Tunis to where ? From outside to inside , but where ? Nothing is clear , &quot; PLO envoy Hih said.. &quot; In a_few days , the Palestinian police will find themselves face to face with the people who led the uprising for seven years , &quot; he said . &quot; It will not be easy . I think the_matter of implementing this agreement , it is different than signing the agreement . To sign it was almost impossible . And to implement it , it will be unbelievable ! &quot; The Long Way Home About 500 to 600 people are scheduled to go_to Gaza and Jericho , out of about 1 # 000 PLO employees in Tunis . Some Palestinians , such_as Bizyada abu Youssef , have moved from country to country . Her family moved from Beersheba to Gaza to Qatar to Tunis and is packing for Gaza again .</TEXT>
