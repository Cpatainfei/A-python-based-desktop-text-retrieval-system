   <HEADLINE> TRIAL IN FATAL DOWNING HAS WIDE IMPACT FOR MILITARY ; DEFENSE : FRIENDLY FIRE DEATHS OF 26 IN IRAQ HAUNT THE ARMED FORCES . MANY SAY THE PENTAGON IS BEING OVERZEALOUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Lt . Col . Randy W . May , a career U.S. Air_Force pilot , who in the flicker of a moment made a tragic mistake and shot_down a U.S. helicopter over Iraq last spring , the legal case that opened in Germany on Monday could mean dismissal from the service and 26 years in prison . For American servicemen and women around the globe , the case carries equally profound consequences . May , a decorated Air_Force flier with almost 20 years of service to his country , is charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide for mistakenly blasting one of two helicopters in the no-fly zone over Iraq earlier this year . Twenty-six people were killed . Public outrage was intense . The Pentagon vowed to bring those responsible to justice , arguing that such strong measures were necessary to uphold the high standards of military professionalism . With the armed forces continuing to shrink , competition for military jobs is growing fierce . Like many private businesses , the Pentagon is seeking to show that it has no room for incompetence and will no longer tolerate those who blunder , no matter how innocently . But many in the military believe that May is being overzealously prosecuted by a Pentagon too eager to boost its public image . They worry that if the military continues to take such unprecedented hard lines against friendly fire mistakes , troops will be reluctant to take risks or act aggressively in combat situations for fear of being second-guessed . Their hesitation , in turn , could lead to loss of life from enemy fire . &quot; Combat fighter_pilots are a very close group , &quot; said John Norton of Las Vegas , a retired Army pilot from the Vietnam_War era who is trying to raise a legal defense fund for May . &quot; And if you see somebody get creamed for a mistake such_as his , you ' re going to be hesitant in everything you do_in the future. &quot; * Mark McMonagle , a former soldier imprisoned for more_than three years for mistakenly shooting a civilian during the 1989 invasion of Panama , said that military_leaders are eager to pass the buck . &quot; When someone makes a mistake anymore , they put it on the lowest ranking guy , &quot; McMonagle said . &quot; Someone has to be the scapegoat . They know the American public will be outraged over what happened , so they just throw it on somebody else . It shows they are cowards. &quot; Retired Gen . David Brahms , once the Marine Corps ' top attorney , said that the harsh penalty May is facing is indicative_of a new &quot; zero-defect mentality &quot; in the military . As the armed_services grow smaller , he said , Pentagon leaders expect the caliber of its members to rise . They also are pushing a public persona of being tougher on soldiers who trip_up . The term &quot; friendly fire &quot; is becoming an oxymoron , he said . &quot; I ' m absolutely certain that in the 1990s , if they find any reasonable basis for faulting anyone , they ' re going to do_it . &quot; It takes a lot of guts to stand_up and say to the next_of_kin that , ' look , there are mistakes and problems , but this is the price of freedom. ' &quot; Instead , he said , mid-level military commanders , concerned about their own career advancement , are less willing to defend subordinates , and that in turn creates a &quot; chilling effect &quot; on the rank_and_file . &quot; More and more you see that every minor mistake tends to be magnified and memorialized , &quot; he said . &quot; People who make mistakes in today ' s Army don ' t stay around. &quot; No one , least of all May , is dismissing his case as minor . On April 14 , he and another pilot , Capt . Eric A . Wickson , shot down two U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters that they thought were Iraqi Hinds violating a no-fly zone over Iraq . Killed were 15 U.S. citizens , five Kurds working for the United States and six military officials from Britain , France and Turkey . Air_Force Secretary Sheila Widnall , the service ' s highest civilian authority , said in an interview that May is not being singled_out . &quot; I have faith in the people making these calls , &quot; Widnall said . &quot; They hold to a high state of professionalism . And the decision to shoot_down any aircraft at any time is always a very serious matter. &quot; * She also said that she does not believe &quot; this has a chilling effect &quot; on others in the military . Rather , she said , the accident will get a full public airing , and others in the armed forces will be able to decide for themselves whether any of the accused were being prosecuted unfairly . Ivan Oelrich , a national defense consultant in Washington who last year wrote a report for Congress ' Office of Technology Assessment on friendly fire cases in the Persian_Gulf_War , said that military_leaders handling friendly fire cases are correct in weighing their potential for undermining public goodwill . &quot; The American public is extremely cautious about military intervention , &quot; he said . &quot; So you can imagine how tough they ' re going to be_on mistakes . One accident and public support can vanish . &quot; Walk the halls of the Pentagon . Talk to officers . They know how thin public support for military intervention is and how it can evaporate very quickly if there are unnecessary losses. &quot; In addition to May , five members of a U.S. Airborne Warning and Control_System crew were charged with various counts of dereliction of duty and could be dismissed if convicted . Last month , three of the AWACS crew_members were given hearings at Tinker Air_Force Base in Oklahoma , and a decision is pending on whether they should be tried . Two others waived their rights to preliminary hearings . Wickson , who has not been charged in the incident , testified against the AWACS officers and bolstered the Air_Force ' s allegations that they failed to properly notify the F-15 pilots that the helicopters were friendly aircraft . May ' s preliminary hearing began Monday at the U.S. Air_Force base in Sembach , Germany . Unlike the Tinker hearings , May ' s proceedings are closed to the public . Air_Force prosecutors declined to comment , but May ' s defense_attorney , Capt . Earl Martin , said in a telephone_interview that he does not expect the hearing to lead to a court-martial . Martin suggested that the AWACS crew sent erroneous information to May that the Black Hawks were hostile aircraft . &quot; We ' re going to try to put the case and the event itself in its proper perspective , &quot; Martin said . &quot; We ' re going to show that the mistake made by Col . May and the flight lead ( Wickson ) was indeed the final mistake in a long line of errors . And each of these errors played a very significant role in this event. &quot; For May ' s part , the mission was one of more_than a dozen he has flown over the no-fly zone . Indeed , during Operation_Desert_Storm against Iraq , he downed an Iraqi Hind in the same area and received a Distinguished Flying Cross for his &quot; professional competence , aerial skill and devotion to duty. &quot; May declined to be interviewed about the pending charges . But in a statement , he strongly denied any purposeful negligence . &quot; The mission we flew was not conducted haphazardly but was performed in a disciplined manner as planned and briefed , &quot; he said . &quot; Human error did occur and it resulted in a fatal mistake which will never leave my thoughts. &quot;</TEXT>
