   <HEADLINE> AT &amp; T AND INTEL TO COOPERATE ON PC SOFTWARE FOR VIDEO CALLING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> AT &amp; T Corp . and Intel Corp . said Monday that they will work together so video calls and conferences done via personal_computer become as simple as using a regular telephone . The companies , which have developed competing desktop PC video software , said they will have those products working with each other by the end of the year . In addition , AT &amp; T said it will develop directory assistance , operator assistance , security features and other services for video calling like those that have long existed for voice . A key goal of the two companies is to reduce the 10 to 15 minutes it can take_to set_up a video conference to a_few point-and-click mouse commands on the PC . &quot; Currently it ' s very difficult and can be time-consuming to make a video conferencing connection , &quot; said Bruce Ryon , analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San Jose . &quot; For this technology to be adopted on a widespread level , they ' re going to have to make_it as easy as a telephone call. &quot; AT &amp; T , which runs the world ' s largest telecommunications network , is looking_for video calls to increase usage and revenue of that system . Intel , the largest maker of computer chips , believes that complex uses for a computer , like video calls , will drive demand for more advanced chips . Both AT &amp; T and Intel began selling desktop data-sharing and video programs earlier this year . The systems have been used chiefly by financial , legal and medical firms , the companies said .</TEXT>
