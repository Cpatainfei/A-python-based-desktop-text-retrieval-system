   <HEADLINE> IF YOU WILL , MR . WILSON , SIGN RIGHT HERE ; FOUR BILLS AMONG THE MANY BEFORE THE GOVERNOR STAND_OUT AS WORTHY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the arrival of recess in this year ' s session of the state Legislature , a number of bills are_on Gov . Pete Wilson ' s desk to either be signed into law or vetoed . The following bills are but a_few that merit becoming law . AB 2444 . California ' s splendid 1 # 000-mile coastline requires protection from environmental hazards . AB 2444 seeks to help ensure that -- by banning indefinitely new offshore oil drilling in state waters , from Imperial Beach to the Oregon border . The measure , by Assemblyman Jack O ' Connell ( D-Carpenteria ) , would add_to existing drilling prohibitions and would remove provisions that would allow drilling to resume in some areas as soon as next year . Given his past stances opposing offshore drilling and limiting the development of oil_wells in federal waters , it should be easy for Wilson to approve this bill . But the governor , seeking reelection , is also trying to keep business in California , and oil_companies that have contributed to his campaigns oppose the measure . On aesthetic grounds as well as on the basis of estimates that the amounts of oil to be gained are not worth the potential risks , AB 2444 should become law . AB 3046 . A series of articles published by The Times in 1990 documented widespread abuses in the garment industry , mostly by subcontractors who employ immigrant Latino or Asian women as seamstresses at below the minimum_wage . In some especially egregious cases , so-called &quot; stitch and ditch &quot; operators absconded with newly sewn goods without even paying their employees . Due_to budget cutbacks there are simply not enough state labor inspectors to crack_down on all such violators . This legislation , by Assemblywoman Hilda L . Solis ( D-El Monte ) , would shift some responsibility for improving work conditions in the garment trade to the large manufacturers that keep the subcontractors in business . It is more narrowly written than earlier legislation that was opposed by the garment industry ; it makes a manufacturer liable only if a subcontractor fails to pay his workers or does not pay the minimum_wage or overtime . It is a reasonable compromise that could help eliminate any remaining sweatshops in California ' s garment trade , without putting an undue financial burden on an important manufacturing sector . AB 1333 . This bill would require police to destroy confiscated guns . The practice by some local_governments of allowing police_departments to raise money by reselling firearms is dangerously irresponsible . Legislation by Assemblyman Mike Gotch ( D-San Diego ) would bar the practice . Currently police agencies are allowed to sell all legal weapons that are confiscated and keep the money . This bill would require police to destroy all weapons , except antiques , or use them for law_enforcement . The legislation is eminently sensible . AB 3335 . Asians and Pacific Islanders account_for 10 % of California ' s population . But when the state_Department of Finance last year issued a report about population projections , there was no category for Asians and Pacific Islanders . They were lumped into the &quot; other , &quot; which was the fourth category , after whites , blacks and Hispanics . The Finance Department acknowledged that 85 % of the &quot; others &quot; were Californians of Asian or Pacific Islander ancestry . To correct this oversight , the Legislature passed AB 3335 , by Assemblymen Louis Caldera ( D-Los Angeles ) and Nao Takasugi ( R-Oxnard ) . The bill would require the Finance Department to present Asians and Pacific Islanders as a distinct category whenever the agency issues reports containing breakdowns or analyses based on race or ethnicity . This fastest-growing ethnic_group in the United States -- and California -- will have increasing impact and voice . It ' s just good public policy for the state to have basic information about Asians and Pacific Islanders .</TEXT>
