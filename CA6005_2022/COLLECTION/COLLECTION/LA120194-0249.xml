   <HEADLINE> FAA REORGANIZING , ADDING SAFETY OFFICE ; AVIATION : AGENCY RESPONDS TO CRITICISM FOR FAILURE TO ACT IN ADVANCE OF TWO CRASHES -- ONE IN O.C. -- REGARDING POTENTIAL DANGER FROM BOEING 757 WAKE TURBULENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four months after an internal report criticized the Federal Aviation Administration ' s ability to act_upon safety issues , the agency is being reorganized along business_lines , with the addition of a new safety systems office , FAA Administrator David R . Hinson said Wednesday . While insisting that all FAA personnel consider safety their main task , Hinson said he is establishing a new safety systems division reporting directly to him . The aviation safety goal is &quot; zero defects , &quot; he said , adding that he expects the new office to help attain this . The office will cooperate with other nations , airlines , manufacturers and others to collect all types of information about aviation and aircraft operations , he said . The reorganization comes four months after a joint investigation by the U.S. Department_of_Transportation and the FAA concluded that the FAA did not have the proper procedures in place to ensure that safety concerns are acted_upon in a timely fashion . U.S. Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena and Hinson ordered the internal review in mid-June after a series of reports in The Times indicated that the FAA knew about the potential danger of Boeing 757 wake turbulence long before two crashes that claimed 13 lives . In one of these , the top two executives of the In-N-Out Burgers chain and three others were killed in December , 1993 , in Santa Ana . In a 46-page report released after the internal probe , a review panel recommended that Hinson create a more effective mechanism to address safety issues . The report said the agency lacked &quot; a single organization , mechanism or entity &quot; that can identify potential safety problems , alert others within the agency and follow_up_on safety recommendations . Testifying before the House Subcommittee on Technology , Environment and Aviation on July 28 , Hinson pledged that within 60 days he would devise a better system to spot and act_upon emerging safety problems . The goal is to study every bit of available data , analyze it in new ways and set_up an early-warning system for any problems , Hinson explained . For example , he said , large amounts of data are generated during routine service and maintenance work , pilot reports , minor flight problems and other instances that may_not attract attention . By compiling these data in computers , analysts could locate patterns or note what seem to be minor problems for repair before an incident occurs , Hinson said . Although it was not a universally held view , the Department of Transportation-FAA report revealed that some officials within the FAA believed the agency could have acted sooner than it did_in taking steps designed to prevent accidents caused by Boeing 757 wake turbulence .</TEXT>
