   <HEADLINE> GREEN MAGAZINES GET BLUES ; ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLICATIONS HURTING FROM FALLOFF IN INTEREST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They harbored dreams of spreading the green gospel . Publishers rolled_out new magazines like Buzzworm and Garbage that preached waste reduction , energy conservation , forest preservation . But now the roughly half-dozen publications that sprang_up around Earth Day ' s 20th anniversary -- four years ago this month -- are falling about as fast as clear-cut trees . Buzzworm is in bankruptcy . Garbage cut its frequency after barely breaking_even . E magazine is living hand-to-mouth . Even entrenched magazines are hurting . The shakeout is most profound in periodicals , but the trend suggests a falloff in environmental interest with implications beyond the publishing industry . Despite the popularity of recycling and other initiatives , Americans in_general -- and magazine readers , in particular -- are not as interested as environmentalists in green product updates and the latest dirt on polluters . Moreover , they are reluctant to pay about $ 30 a year for magazines when much of the same fare is supplied by newspapers , news weeklies and television . &quot; I ' m not sure there was a euphoria except by the publishers themselves , &quot; publisher Joel Makower said . He should know . Four years ago , Makower started the Green Consumer Letter , a monthly eight-page newsletter with information on green investing to energy conservation printed on recycled paper . He was forced to close it in January after subscriptions fell to a_few thousand . &quot; I made the naive but rational-at-the-time assumption that there was going_to be a good steady market for this , &quot; Makower said . What ' s clear is that publishers overestimated the concern aroused by Earth Day fervor , the anti-regulatory policies of the Reagan decade and disasters such_as the Exxon-Valdez oil spill . A Roper Starch Worldwide poll finds that 20 % of Americans felt strongly about the environment last year , down from 25 % in 1991 . Consumers most likely to spend more for green products fell from 11 % in 1990 to 6 % to 1993 . One reason is the economy ' s sluggish emergence from the 1990-91 recession . Readers are less likely to renew subscriptions to magazines not considered essential . Faced with a choice , Americans with only modest interest have turned_to more conventional news sources that have expanded their green coverage . Trend watchers expected the shakeout . &quot; Any time a new issue comes_up on the radar screen , there tends to be an initial panic . Then we become more informed , people start to take action , address the problem , and people ' s concerns become a bit muted , &quot; said Bradford Fay , vice_president at Roper Starch , the marketing and public_opinion research firm . &quot; It ' s not because the issue has gone_away , it ' s because progress is seen . The fact that we had a recession forced this sort of pragmatic thinking to move_in quicker than it might have otherwise. &quot; The shift has converted enthusiasts to cynics . &quot; I ' m not 100 % convinced environmental journalism is a mainstream consumer interest , &quot; said a humbled Joseph Daniel , the publisher and founder of Buzzworm . Launched six years ago , Buzzworm broke stories like pesticide spraying on airplanes and amused readers with irreverent pokes -- including a parody of a poacher ' s catalogue of endangered wildlife . Circulation grew to 110 # 000 at its peak . Buzzworm was one of the few to claim success in luring big advertisers such_as Chrysler and Absolut vodka . Even with ads the bimonthly lost money , renewal drives were too expensive and readership fell . Last fall , Buzzworm changed its name to Buzzworm ' s Earth Journal to reflect a fresh emphasis on culture , eco-travel and literature , and halved frequency to four times a year . But the publisher of Earth , an earth_science magazine , sued Buzzworm over the new name as the company was trying to recapitalize its finances . When the deal fell_through , the legal expenses helped push the company over the edge . In December , Buzzworm sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in federal_court in Denver , nearly $ 2 million in debt . Garbage magazine also is struggling for a profitable identity . Started in 1989 by the publisher of the Old House Journal , the bimonthly initially offered standard fare such_as articles on composting and walking to work . Subscriptions grew to 125 # 000 by late 1990 . But amid disappointing renewals , Garbage grew more adversarial by challenging accepted environmentalist opinions on key subjects . One story questioned whether the ozone_layer ' s depletion was a serious problem . Garbage lost some angry readers in the process . This year , Garbage underwent an even more fundamental shift . The publication halved its frequency to quarterly , dropped advertising and refocused on what it calls &quot; environmental insiders &quot; -- readers like environmental activists , regulators and corporate_executives . &quot; Time to Dump Plastics Recycling ? &quot; asks a story in the debut Spring 1994 issue . Another details Earth First ! founder Dave Foreman ' s plan for returning millions of North_American acres to wilderness -- and stresses that &quot; eminent biologists back him. &quot; &quot; What I ' ve come_to think is there ' s really nothing such_as a stand-alone environmental lifestyle , &quot; said editor and publisher Patricia Poore , who also heads the Old House Journal . &quot; It ' s really an oxymoron -- you can ' t really live_in the 20th Century and really be back to the land. &quot; You would n ' t know it from E , a 5-year-old magazine steeped in environmental values . The February issue , for example , tells &quot; the Dirty History of Nuclear Power &quot; and how caffeinated environmentalists can choose &quot; Coffees With Conscience. &quot; Despite its nonprofit status -- foundation grants total up_to 18 % of its $ 1-million annual budget , with the rest from subscriptions -- the monthly was forced recently to cut costs by slicing circulation one-third to 50 # 000 . &quot; We ' ve been pretty hand-to-mouth , &quot; publisher Doug Moss said . Even environmental groups that publish large-circulation magazines for their members are struggling . In 1991 , Greenpeace closed its member magazine , no longer able to afford it . Sierra magazine , published by the Sierra Club , has had limited success in luring big advertisers because of a predicament faced by all environmental magazines . &quot; We disseminate an anti-consumption message -- travel less , consume less , pollute less , &quot; said Jonathan F . King , editor in chief . One hopeful area is in catering to businesses . Makower continues to publish his Green Business_Letter -- with advice on how to make companies greener -- because an annual subscription commands at least $ 100 more_than what he could charge readers for the consumer version . &quot; That isn ' t a market that has been glutted by other media outlets , &quot; he said . Not yet , anyway . ECO ( pronounced echo ) , which bills itself as a business magazine about the environment , debuted last fall with attacks on excessive and costly government regulation and an eclectic list of advertisers including Dupont , utilities and the World Wildlife Fund . ECO envisions profitability by 1996 . But other start-ups with similar themes may obstruct that plan . &quot; To repeat the same old thing , ' Everybody is terrible and industry is awful , ' some of it has become old hat by now , &quot; said ECO Editor and President Igor Gordevitch , former publisher of Geo and a variety of other magazines . &quot; It ' s a question of picking_out who your readers are. &quot;</TEXT>
