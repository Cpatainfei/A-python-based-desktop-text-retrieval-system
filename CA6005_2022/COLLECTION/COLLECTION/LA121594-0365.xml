   <HEADLINE> YOUR PERFUME IS MAKING THEM SICK ; OVERWHELMED BY THE SCENTS OF CHEMICALS IN PRODUCTS AND IN THE AIR , SOME ACTIVISTS ARE LEADING THE PUSH FOR A MORE FRAGRANCE-FREE ENVIRONMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Marie Schmidt of Arcadia cringes when she sees her monthly department_store bills in the mailbox . Schmidt isn ' t worried about making payments . She is worried about getting sick from fragrance strips that some stores include with their bills . &quot; I start sneezing and my nose starts running the minute I smell them , &quot; says Schmidt , whose respiratory_system goes_on red alert at the least whiff of scented products . &quot; It ' s sort of like cigarette smoking , &quot; she complains . &quot; They are invading my privacy. &quot; Whether she realizes it or not , Schmidt is part of what could be the next big nationwide battle that pits individual rights against public health concerns : the push for fragrance-free environments . &quot; Ten years from now it will be politically incorrect to wear perfumes in public , &quot; predicts Paul Imperiale , disability coordinator for the mayor ' s office in San Francisco . That city ' s fragrance-free plan , drafted in 1990 , was never enacted . With Americans now using perhaps a dozen scented personal-care products each day , fragrance foes ' basic argument is this : your right to wear these products ends where my chemical sensitivities begin . Doctors say those sensitivities are heightened by chronic sinus problems ( suffered by 33 million Americans , according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America ) or allergies ( endured by more_than 50 million of us ) . Beyond perfume , activists for fragrance-free environments are targeting restaurant bathrooms with those pungent deodorizers , office_buildings that use pesticides and astringent cleaning products , and the neighborhood mall , whose host of synthetic odors assault the nostrils , especially around the holidays . &quot; We are putting so_much into our environment that people are getting sick . I don ' t think it ' s a matter of personal rights now , I think it ' s a matter of everyone ' s health , &quot; says Joan Ripple , a consultant to state Sen . Milton Marks , who chaired a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on the rights of the disabled . Two years ago , Marks , a San Francisco Democrat whose district includes Marin County , sponsored a controversial bill to deal with environmental chemicals and fragrances . The bill , which was opposed by the fragrance and cleaning industries , would have required the management of all public buildings to post when the last pesticide application was and the chemicals used . It also asked people to refrain voluntarily from wearing fragrances to public meetings and designated fragrance-free zones near window or doors . But even though the bill failed last spring , the sentiment behind it appears to be growing . Consider these developments : * On Tuesday , the City of Oakland approved a wide-ranging policy that accommodates those with chemical sensitivities . The policy requires the city to provide fragrance-free meeting areas for chemically sensitive individuals who need to meet with city employees . They will be asked to refrain_from wearing scented products on that day . The policy still needs full council approval . * Several months ago , the University of Minnesota ' s School of Social_Work banned students and faculty from using perfumes , colognes , shampoos and other products that might trigger allergic_reactions . * In Santa Cruz , officials have passed a resolution supporting the concept of smoke-free and fragrance-free environments as part of the city ' s implementation of the Americans With Disabilities Act . The city wants to &quot; discourage the use of fragrances within city facilities and vehicles &quot; and &quot; provide information on alternative products which are fragrance-free. &quot; * Marin County has set_up fragrance-free zones where those with chemical sensitivities can sit during the monthly public hearings on county parks . * In Boise , Idaho , Pastor Jon K . Brown of the First United Methodist_Church has launched a fragrance-free service each Sunday at 2 p.m. He says his wife has multiple chemical sensitivity . &quot; In public policy terms , this could be defined as an issue of handicapped access , just like having a wheelchair ramp into a church or public building , &quot; Brown says . &quot; To have services that aren ' t fragrance-free is to deny services to a group of people whose population is growing every day. &quot; * Multiple chemical sensitivity , or MCS , has been hotly debated in recent years , mainly because no one can conclusively say whether it exists . Suffers describe MCS as a hypersensitivity to synthetic chemical_compounds ranging from Lysol to L ' Air du Temps . They complain of symptoms that include headaches , nausea , dizziness , respiratory difficulties , fatigue and fainting . But while some doctors regularly treat patients with MCS , others challenge its very existence and suggest that MCS could be psychosomatic . The California Medical Assn . doesn ' t recognize MCS ; the American Medical Assn . does not list it on its roster of recognized diseases . &quot; MCS is not an accepted medical disorder , &quot; says Irene Malbin , vice_president of public affairs for the Washington , D.C.-based Cosmetic , Toiletry and Fragrance Assn . &quot; There ' s no scientific or medical evidence that fragrances adversely affect public health . And it seems very unfair that people are now saying that you can ' t use products that are safe and regulated by the FDA ( and ) which the vast majority of people enjoy. &quot; Even so , support groups are springing_up across the nation to lobby for legislative changes , and Congress has appropriated $ 250 # 000 to study the issue . Orlando Caprari , 34 , of Pasadena , says he has no doubt about the reality of MCS . If he uses commercial shampoo , he has trouble breathing . If he slathers on scented deodorants , he breaks_out in a rash under his arms . Caprari can ' t even wear clothes that have been washed in regular detergent . &quot; It is a concern , &quot; Caprari says . &quot; I go_to great lengths to be unscented. &quot; Dr. Stuart Epstein , an allergist who practices in Beverly Hills , treats many patients with chemical sensitivities and says those who have never experienced them may find it hard to believe that the problem exists . Symptoms can be fleeting and depend_on the type of chemical exposure , proximity and length of exposure , and other environmental factors , such_as ventilation , Epstein says . Most people with chemical sensitivities also have a history of allergies , he adds . Some may have had their immune_system affected by previous exposure to environmental chemicals such_as pesticides . Experts say there is confusion about how fragrances and cleaning products affect these people . &quot; Technically it ' s not an allergy , it ' s an irritant , but people get mixed_up because the symptoms are the same , the lungs constrict and air_passages narrow , &quot; says Dawn Marvin , director of communications for the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America . * Most perfumes on the market today are mainly synthetic , containing on average only 5 % natural oils . Likewise , products labeled &quot; fragrance-free &quot; often contain fragrances that mask the stinky raw_materials to create a neutral scent . &quot; Especially in detergents , there are chemicals that don ' t smell particularly good , so you want to add a fragrance to neutralize them so people can use the product , &quot; says Malbin , of the fragrance industry association . Public agencies that attempt to regulate the use of scented products -- cleaning , personal care and environmental -- are learning that the industry has a lot of clout . Two years ago , the city of Oakland drafted a policy requiring public meeting notices to include the statement : &quot; In consideration of persons with disabilities , we ask people to voluntarily refrain_from wearing perfumed personal care products to this event. &quot; Peter Margen , equal_opportunity specialist with the Oakland city_manager ' s office , says the city was &quot; hammered &quot; by industry lobbyists and representatives , some of whom flew in from the East Coast to organize local opposition . &quot; They had a lawyer in a wheelchair and Avon Ladies saying this was going_to cut_into their market , &quot; Margen recalls . Despite the brouhaha , fragrance advertising in magazines is still big business , exceeding $ 93 million last year , according to Leading National Advertisers , a New York firm . Yet a survey by Bruskin Goldring Research Firm in Edison , N.Y. , found that 29 % of 1 # 000 people surveyed disliked fragrance strip advertising . Michael Pashby , senior_vice_president for Magazine_Publishers of America , an industry group , says most magazines have the capability to offer fragrance-free editions but that few subscribers request it . Jeannette Chang , publisher of Harper ' s Bazaar -- which gets three-quarters of its advertising revenue from beauty , cosmetics and fragrance companies -- says most of her customers relish the ads . &quot; It ' s like shopping as you go_through the magazine. &quot; The New Yorker provides several hundred of its 816 # 000-strong circulation with scent-free copies , says Maurie Perl , vice_president for public relations . Technology has also improved , making scents less invasive . &quot; They used to basically soak the paper in fragrance and send it out_to consumers , &quot; Pashby says . Now , the fragrance is encapsulated in bubbles or &quot; scratch and sniff &quot; type formats . Just in time too . A 1992 California law requires magazine distributors to keep scents from escaping the ads before the strips are opened . Violators can be fined only $ 100 for each mass mailing , however . * For those with fragrance sensitivities , this remains the grueling season . Half of all annual perfume sales occur between Thanksgiving and Christmas . But department_stores , at least , have become more cautious since a Bloomingdale ' s patron received a $ 75 # 000 out-of-court_settlement after being hospitalized for 11 days in critical condition in 1989 , after having been sprayed with unwanted perfume . These days most &quot; fragrance models &quot; in department_stores ask first , then spray or offer a fragrance strip you can hold to your nose as you mull_over that perfect present for Aunt Bee . Michelle Destito , a fragrance model at the Broadway in Arcadia , uses scented silk roses to introduce customers to Byblos and Cabotine perfumes . &quot; Some people say they can ' t smell the roses because they ' re allergic to perfume , but not very often , &quot; Destito says . &quot; If I notice them shying away , I ' ll be more careful about how I approach them. &quot; Which is just fine with Melinda Wright of Monrovia . While she doesn ' t break_out in a rash or get a headache from perfumes , Wright sees it as an issue of personal choice . &quot; If I wanted to try some perfume on , &quot; Wright says , &quot; I would do_it myself. &quot;</TEXT>
