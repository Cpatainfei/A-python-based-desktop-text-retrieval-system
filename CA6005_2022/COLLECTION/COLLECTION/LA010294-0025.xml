   <HEADLINE> FOCUS ; THE BUZZ ON COFFEE TALK ; TASTER ' S CHOICE GIMMICK OF A CONTINUING COMMERCIAL WORKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When we last left_off , the couple looked_out at the Eiffel Tower in their Paris hotel_room . As the sun sets , he marvels at the view , and the cup of coffee he ' s drinking . &quot; Is that all ? &quot; she asks . &quot; No , &quot; he says . They kiss , and the screen fades to black . that ' s where the folks at Taster ' s Choice left viewers hanging . That was six months ago , a lifetime in an era of short-attention spans . For more_than three years , the couple ' s coy romance has tantalized viewers , even if it means waiting longer than a week to find_out what happens next . In the cluttered world of TV spots , these serialized commercials are a rarity . But with a touch of innuendo and romance , Taster ' s Choice has made_it work . &quot; The amazing thing is , even though people don ' t know it is coming_on the air , they are just as caught_up in it as they would be a soap_opera or a regular program , &quot; says Heidi Noorany , product manager at Nestle , which owns Taster ' s Choice . &quot; People are bombarded with media messages , so this was definitely very different. &quot; Sales of Taster ' s Choice have climbed 10 % since the first spot . In the last 18 months , the company got 1 # 500 letters . And 15 # 000 people entered a contest last summer in which they suggested what should happen next . The latest spot will debut on &quot; Mad About You &quot; this week . The only clue that Nestle will offer : The romance takes an unexpected turn , one that will allow the story line to continue for quite a while . &quot; We have no plans to stop it , &quot; Noorany says . &quot; we ' ll go_on as long as the public likes it. &quot; The couple , played by British actors Anthony Head and Sharon Maughan , first debuted in Great Britain in 1987 to advertise Nescafe Gold Blend , a similar instant coffee . They became such a sensation there that a book was published , and plans were once in the works for a movie based on the couple . So McCann-Erickson , Nestle ' s advertising_agency , sought similar success in the United States . Still , &quot; We didn ' t know it would go beyond the first episode &quot; in the United States , Noorany says . &quot; But we were immediately inundated with calls from viewers , wondering what would happen next. &quot; The chemistry has worked so well that many viewers assumed the couple were married in real_life . Not so . &quot; We both have extremely happy home lives of_our_own , &quot; Head says . &quot; But there is a spark I see on camera that you don ' t notice on the set . It ' s quite extraordinary. &quot; Both actors have appeared on talk_shows , and with only five minutes , 25 seconds of air time so far , they ' re instantly recognized on the street . One amused man handed Maughan a jar of coffee . &quot; People will come_up_to me and say , ' You ' re the woman ! ' &quot; says Maughan , who lives_in Los Angeles with her husband , actor Trevor Eve . &quot; I ' ll go_into a supermarket and people will direct me right to the coffee aisle. &quot; The ads also helped them gain roles in movies and on stage . Maughan had a supporting role in &quot; Another Stakeout &quot; last summer , and has directed stage plays_on visits back to London . Head , who lives_in London , appears in the upcoming Showtime movie &quot; Royce , &quot; with Jim Belushi . &quot; The commercials have done so well because there is a heightened expectancy , &quot; Head says . &quot; But then you think ' looking_forward to an ad ? ' It ' s ridiculous . It ' s a commercial . But it is very successful marketing , and it ' s not overkill. &quot; Not that the product gets lost in the story . A narrator invites consumers to &quot; Savor the sophisticated taste of Taster ' s Choice. &quot; The couple often take a sip of coffee . In the most recent spot , the woman meets the man on the streets of Paris , and almost immediately hands him a jar . If it was laundry_detergent they were passing , it probably would n ' t work , Noorany says . &quot; We found_out that when people drink coffee , it is often on a date , when they are talking in a conversation , &quot; she says . &quot; It really plays a role in getting_to know each other. &quot; There have been few copycats . &quot; Those are things that are very hard to carry_off , &quot; says Steve Rabosky , creative director at Chiat / Day Inc. Advertising , responsible_for the Energizer bunny campaign . &quot; People don ' t normally watch a commercial for a plot. &quot; Instead , it ' s a matter of matching the right product with the right story line . The latest Energizer ads borrow from the great movie cliffhangers , featuring evil villains and Western heroes ( including the Lone Ranger ) , special_effects and monsters , providing plenty of comic foils for the bunny . &quot; I approached the production like a movie , &quot; says Frank Oz , the famed Muppeteer who directed the spots . &quot; There is that feel to it , but the challenge is that you have to do_it all within a matter of seconds. &quot; In one spot , which debuted in November , the executives of the fictitious Supervolt Batteries plot to destroy the bunny . The Supervolt chairman , with pointy eyebrows , shows King Kong a sign that reads &quot; bunny equals banana , &quot; and gets the famous movie beast ready to crush the bunny . Then , &quot; To be continued &quot; flashes on screen . &quot; Sometimes you watch a commercial and don ' t remember the product , &quot; Rabosky says . &quot; But here , the bunny is central to the premise . It ' s a no-brainer for the consumer. &quot; Unlike Taster ' s Choice ads , the audience need only wait within the same commercial break to find_out what happens next : King Kong climbs_up the Empire_State Building , trying to catch the bunny at top . But Kong is stopped when a femme_fatale shuts a window on his foot . And of course , the bunny keeps going and going and going .. .</TEXT>
