   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; DEATH LEAVES U.S. ACROSS TABLE FROM UNKNOWN FOE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The death of North_Korean leader Kim Il Sung could not have come at a worse time for the United States in its efforts to stop Pyongyang from acquiring nuclear_weapons . It means that the leadership in Pyongyang will be struggling to sort_out its internal politics over the next few crucial months -- just when North_Korea is facing major decisions about the future of its nuclear program , about the disposal of highly radioactive nuclear fuel and , more generally , about its relations with the rest of the world . If Kim ' s eldest son , Kim Jong Il , emerges in control in Pyongyang , he will usher_in the world ' s first Communist dynasty . No other Communist leader has ever passed_on power to a child . At the very least , that transition will mean months of uncertainty for the United States . &quot; Even if Kim Jong Il takes the reins of power , we won ' t know for a while how solid his leadership is or whether he will last , &quot; Leonard Spector , a nuclear specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , said Saturday . &quot; Clearly , there ' s a faction in Pyongyang that wants to push this ( nuclear_weapons program ) forward. &quot; And so it may be one of history ' s unending ironies that Kim ' s death is being greeted by the United States with more_than a little regret . When President Clinton , at an economic summit in Naples , Italy , expressed &quot; sincere condolences &quot; to the people of North_Korea about Kim ' s death , he was being more_than just polite . The North_Korean leader who has been viewed since the beginning of the Cold_War as one of America ' s leading adversaries became , in his final days , the man with whom U.S. policy-makers hoped to make a deal . True , Kim had fought one bloody war against the United States and its South_Korean allies and staunchly opposed U.S. policy in Asia for more_than four decades . But he was considered the only one in Pyongyang with the unchallengeable authority needed to cut_off North_Korea ' s developing nuclear_weapons program before it destabilizes the entire region of East Asia . Consider the plight the United States and its principal allies in the region , Japan and South_Korea , now find themselves in : * On Saturday , talks in Geneva between the United States and North_Korea about the nuclear program were temporarily halted , only a day after they had started . In a startling symbol of their disarray , North_Korean negotiators apparently found_out about Kim ' s death when a U.S. official woke_up one of his counterparts in the early morning hours and told him to turn_on CNN . * Even if the talks start_up again , they may_not go anywhere for a while . Kim ' s death means that North_Korea could well have either erratic leadership under Kim Jong Il or an unstable or paralyzed leadership over the next few months . &quot; I can ' t know what impact this will have_on our discussions , &quot; Assistant Secretary_of_State Robert L . Gallucci said Saturday . He said U.S. officials will stay in Geneva and &quot; try to resume the talks , if that ' s possible. &quot; * Meanwhile , thousands of highly radioactive nuclear fuel rods , enough to make about five bombs , are cooling_off in pools alongside North_Korea ' s 25-megawatt nuclear_reactor at Yongbyon . Something has to be done with them within the next few months before they begin to corrode . If arrangements the United States is seeking for the disposal of this spent fuel are not made at the Geneva talks , then the rods could well be turned_into weapons-grade plutonium at North_Korea ' s reprocessing plant . * And even if the immediate crisis involving the fuel rods is resolved , the new North_Korean leadership will have to be persuaded to give_up its other nuclear installations , including a reprocessing plant and a huge , 200-megawatt reactor now under construction at Yongbyon , which could produce enough plutonium for eight to 10 nuclear_weapons a year . According to David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security , the earliest possible start-up date for this larger reactor is late 1995 , although Defense_Secretary William J . Perry said recently that the new reactor will take a_few more years to complete . The immediate worry for U.S. policy-makers is that North_Korea will succeed in turning its plutonium into usable nuclear_weapons . As far as U.S. officials know , that hasn ' t happened yet ; there is no sign North_Korea has tested any nuclear device . But if it does , Asian neighbors such_as Japan , South_Korea and Taiwan could try to develop nuclear_weapons too . And other nations with active nuclear programs , such_as Iran , could follow North_Korea ' s example by successfully defying the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , the international regime that seeks to prohibit any new nations from joining the nuclear club . The long-range problem is even worse -- that North_Korea will not only make its own nuclear_weapons but use its facilities to produce nuclear fuel for export to such potential customers as Iran , Iraq and Libya . In the face of these gloomy prospects , what hope does the Clinton_Administration have for peacefully defusing the North_Korean crisis ? First , it is possible that Kim Jong Il may turn_out to be something less than the demon that Western intelligence agencies have depicted . Some Western analysts have suggested that Kim Jong Il favors a greater degree of economic reform than his father permitted . Maybe he had the world ' s worst case of the monarchical syndrome in which children of dynastic leaders are forced to wait until well into middle_age to take_over a parent ' s throne . But , of course , the available evidence suggests that Kim Jong Il is not just some North_Korean version of England ' s Prince Charles . Intelligence specialists believe that the younger Kim has been directly responsible_for acts of terrorism , including the 1983 bombing in Burma , now Myanmar , that killed 17 South_Korean officials and the bombing of a South_Korean airliner in 1987 . A second possibility for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear crisis is that someone else in Pyongyang may take_over the reins of power instead of Kim Jong Il . This scenario , however , carries its own dangers . Korean history is replete with examples of bloody power struggles and coups . No one wants civil_war or chaos in a country with North_Korea ' s nuclear potential . For the past several years , U.S. intelligence agencies have been bitterly divided over the question of whether there are competing factions within North_Korea ' s seemingly monolithic leadership . State_Department officials , and some outside experts on North_Korea , have long argued that there are reformers and hard-liners in Pyongyang . According to this line of argument , the reformers are eager to bargain away the nuclear program for diplomatic recognition and economic help . But other U.S. intelligence specialists at the CIA and the Pentagon contend that the differences within the North_Korean leadership are minimal and that it is misleading to talk_of any serious &quot; reform &quot; faction in Pyongyang . These analysts believe that Kim Jong Il and other North_Korean leaders have no intention of bargaining away their nuclear program , because they see nuclear_weapons as a guarantee of_their_own survival . The Clinton_Administration now faces a number of tricky foreign-policy questions concerning North_Korea that extend well beyond the nuclear dispute . For example , suppose Kim Jong Il makes a bid for international recognition of his leadership , perhaps by offering to meet with U.S. officials or by going_forward with the summit_meeting with South_Korea later this month that his father had planned . Should the United States try to deal with him and encourage its allies to do so , at the risk of giving him the sort of legitimacy that could help him consolidate his power ? Or should the Administration hold_back and avoid Kim Jong Il , at the risk of alienating him permanently ? For the time being , the Clinton_Administration seems to be trying to avoid confronting that decision . The written statement issued by the President on Saturday sent condolences &quot; to the people of North_Korea &quot; and did not mention Kim Jong Il . &quot; Right now , our ( the United States ' ) job is to keep things just as cool as possible , &quot; Spector of the Carnegie Endowment said . But before long , the United States is going_to have to make some choices . Just when the Clinton_Administration hoped it might have a chance through the Geneva talks_of easing the crisis over North_Korea , the problem seems to be growing bigger rather than smaller .</TEXT>
