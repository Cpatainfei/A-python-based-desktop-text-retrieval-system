   <HEADLINE> SPREADING THE NOOSE ; CONVICT LAKE , SITE OF A SHOOTOUT BETWEEN PRISON ESCAPEES AND A POSSE IN 1871 , A POPULAR PARADISE FOR SIERRA ANGLERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is probably safe to assume that Moses Black and Leander Morton did not appreciate the beauty of nearby Convict Lake . But then , they were busy dodging bullets and , later , having their necks stretched . The two outlaws were part of a gang of 29 who overpowered guards and escaped_from Nevada State Penitentiary on Sept . 17 , 1871 , and part of a group of six chased by a determined posse into the foothills of the Sierra south of here . After a dramatic shootout with the posse tracking them to what is now Convict Creek , Black , Morton and J . Bedford Roberts escaped south toward Bishop . Three others had split from the group shortly before the shootout . The law caught_up_with Black , Morton and Roberts on Sept . 27 . According to George Williams III ' s &quot; The Murders at Convict Lake , &quot; Black and Morton were &quot; lynched , tried and hung &quot; by vigilantes who wrestled them from the posse . The convicts had killed Billy Poor , a young mail_carrier , during their escape . Black also had killed posse member Robert Morrison during the shootout . Roberts , believed to have played only a minor_role in the killings , was turned_over to the posse and returned to prison . Such is the history behind the naming of the lake . But what ' s in a name ? Convict Lake could still bear its former moniker , Diablo Lake , and it would n ' t change the fact that it is one heavenly reservoir , surrounded by aspens and pines and steep granite peaks , and brimming with clear , cold water teeming with trout . It is the home of Horgon , a giant German brown that heretofore has eluded a persistent posse armed not with six-shooters and Henry repeating rifles , but with rods and reels and every lure and bait known to man . * A glacier slicing_through the region thousands of years ago carved what is now Convict Lake , tucked_in the mountains at 7 # 583 feet at the end of Convict Lake Road only two miles from U.S. 395 between Bishop and Mammoth Lakes . The lake , or tarn , is one of the deepest in the Eastern Sierra at 140 feet . The water is so clear you can follow the rays of the sun to depths of 30 feet or more . On cloudy days , the surface of the lake acts_as a mirror , reflecting not only the billowy clouds but the steep mountains that rise sharply to heights of 10 # 000 feet or more . The 12 # 268-foot Mt . Morrison , the highest visible peak , towers over the lake on the south shore and Mt . Laurel , at 11 # 813 feet , reaches up dramatically from the northeast . &quot; This is God ' s country , &quot; said Canoga Park ' s Rod Lenox , 38 , a Convict Lake regular who knows an appropriate cliche when he sees one . &quot; The first time we came_up , we went_to Crowley ( Lake , a_few miles down U.S. 395 ) and froze our butts off . We found this lake by mistake , looking_at the map . Ever since then we ' ve been coming_up here. &quot; Mt . Morrison was named after Robert Morrison , Black ' s victim during the shootout . Morrison , a 34-year-old Wells Fargo agent and posse member , reportedly had Black in his sights during the shootout . His gun failed , however , and Black , &quot; a large and heavy man with dark hair and beard , &quot; walked up and &quot; coolly pointed his gun at the back of Morrison ' s head and fired . . . killing him instantly , &quot; according to Williams . The posse , one of its members killed and two wounded , fled the scene . A new posse formed in Bishop , caught_up_with the three close to Round Valley near Bishop and for Black and Morton it was soon to be curtains . That was all more_than 100 years ago , but some wonder if the region isn ' t haunted by ghosts of those who met such violent ends here , especially when the wind whistles in fast and cold through the mountains and canyons . &quot; The wind that blows here almost has life of its own , &quot; said Adrienne DeSurra , who with her husband , David , operates Convict Lake Resort . &quot; It has a sound to it . . . like a spirit or something. &quot; * The haunting wind and lore of the Wild_West add_to the mystique of Convict Lake , but they are not what bring thousands here each year . When the snow begins to melt and the ice thaws on the lake , usually in mid-April , the campground , with 88 sites at the foot of Mt . Morrison along Convict Creek , begins to fill . And on the last Saturday of April , which marks the beginning of the fishing_season , the only things that can be found dangling at the end of a rope at Convict Lake are trout on a stringer . This year ' s season-opener on April 30 was so successful that David DeSurra barely had time to catch his breath , as anglers young and old hauled stringers of fish into the general_store to have them weighed and photographed . There were no monsters , but plenty of three- and four-pounders , and a_few pushing five . Even 8-year-old Zach Haines of Ventura , on his first Eastern Sierra opener , had no trouble filling a stringer . He did , however , have a little trouble dragging his trout and those of his father , Randy , into the store . Confronted by a reporter , Haines became red-faced and mum , until he was asked who had caught the two larger rainbows on the string , the tails of which were dragging_on the ground . &quot; I caught all_the big fish , &quot; the youngster said . Convict Lake is small -- about a mile long and half a mile wide -- but it is constantly fed by underground streams and the higher back-country lakes in the John Muir Wilderness . Its depth of 140 feet , according to DeSurra , &quot; gives those big trout plenty of room to hide_out in. &quot; The biggest fish taken from Convict Lake was a 19 1 / 2-pound German brown in 1956 . The biggest in the last 25 years was a 14 1 / 2-pound brown on Oct . 17 , 1993 , which was also the biggest trout caught in the Eastern Sierra last year . Kevin Green of Ontario used a cluster of salmon eggs to entice the fish near where the lake flows into Convict Creek . After a lengthy fight , Green netted the fish , but it took_off , ripping the net from his hands and pulling it downstream . Green ran in after the net , grabbed it and subdued the fish . But there is one big fish that has yet to be caught , according to longtime outdoor writer Tom Stienstra , who in his book , &quot; California Fishing , &quot; gave this description of his first visit to Convict Lake : &quot; My mouth dropped like an egg from a long-legged chicken. &quot; Stienstra , reached this week at his Northern California home , recalled the day he saw a brown_trout estimated at 15-20 pounds : &quot; Right at dusk , when all_the people were leaving and all_the birds and all_the deer and wildlife were coming_out at once , I saw this brown_trout jump not more_than 20 feet from my canoe . Twenty seconds later I got a strike , and I just about levitated out of the boat. &quot; Stienstra was unable to hook the fish , however . About two weeks later , he caught three brown_trout , &quot; all six- to seven-pounders , but none even half the size of the one that jumped. &quot; Stienstra named the elusive brown Horgon . &quot; It was the first_name to pop into my head , &quot; he said . * Less than two months after the wagon supporting Black and Morton was driven_out from under them , leaving them hanging , 18 of the 29 escapees had been captured and all but one of the other escapees was eventually caught . Black and Morton were the only ones hanged . Roberts , who had been serving time for stage robbery , was found not to have received a fair trial and was released in 1873 . Since then , three movies have been made about the prison break and ensuing chases , DeSurra said . Around here these days , however , the only hanging is being done_by fishermen slipping trout onto a stringer . It could be only a matter of time for Horgon .</TEXT>
