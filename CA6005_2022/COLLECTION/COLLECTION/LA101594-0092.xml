   <HEADLINE> CONSUMER PRICES STEADY ; RETAIL SALES , PRODUCTION STRONG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Providing further evidence that the national economy is purring along without serious inflation , the government reported Friday that consumer prices edged_up modestly in September while retail sales surged and manufacturing production remained relatively strong . The consumer_price_index rose just 0.2 % last month on a seasonally adjusted basis , after rising 0.3 % in each of the previous three months , the Labor_Department reported . The modest increase was_due to declines in the price of gasoline , heating_oil and apparel and stabilization in the price of coffee . It was the smallest rise since a 0.2 % gain in May , and it came a day after the report of an unexpected drop_in September wholesale prices . Even excluding the volatile food and energy prices , the so-called core CPI rose just 0.2 % in September after rising 0.3 % in August . In the first nine months of the year , consumer prices have risen at a modest 2.8 % annual rate , adjusted for seasonal variations . That barely outpaces the 2.7 % rate for all_of 1993 , the department ' s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported . &quot; The CPI showed inflation cooling_down a bit from the previous three months , &quot; said Gary L . Ciminero , chief economist at Fleet Financial Group in Providence , R.I. &quot; It is not as troublesome as the bond market seems to think. &quot; However , investors reacted lukewarmly to Friday ' s reports . The Dow Jones industrial average gained 20.52 points to 3 # 910.47 , but the broad market was weak : Losers edged winners on the New York Stock_Exchange in slow trading . Yields on the benchmark 30-year Treasury_bond dipped to 7.83 % from 7.85 % on Thursday . But with less than a month before critical midterm congressional elections , the Clinton_Administration was quick to take credit for the positive figures . &quot; Last year , the Administration laid the foundation for a healthy economic expansion by a credible deficit-reduction strategy that made room for broad-based , investment-led growth in the private sector , &quot; said Laura D ' Andrea Tyson , head of the President ' s Council of Economic Advisers . &quot; This week ' s reports , like other reports on the economy issued this year , indicate that this strategy is working for the American people. &quot; Despite the moderate price report , analysts nevertheless believe the Federal_Reserve_Board is likely to increase short-term interest_rates in November to head_off any sharp price rises in the future . A 0.7 % decline in energy prices , attributable in part to a glut of crude_oil worldwide , was the biggest contributor to the CPI ' s modest growth last month . Home fuel_oil prices fell 0.4 % and gasoline prices dropped 0.6 % . In addition , coffee prices stabilized after soaring more_than 20 % in August and July in the wake of a brutal frost in Brazil . Meanwhile , retail sales showed the economy growing strongly . They jumped in September for the fourth straight month , increasing 0.6 % to a record $ 188.4 billion , the Commerce_Department said . For the third quarter , retail sales are up 7.5 % over the comparable period a year ago . &quot; The bottom_line is . . . consumer demand is still cooking , it ' s still humming along , &quot; said Brian Jones , an economist at Salomon Bros . in New York . Excluding autos , a volatile sector that accounts_for about a fifth of all sales , total retail sales rose 0.6 % , following a 0.7 % increase in August . The growth was strongest among durable goods , including automobiles and other long-lasting items , which rose 1.1 % after a 2.4 % hike the month before . New car sales were up 0.6 % after a strong 2.6 % gain in August . Sales of non-durable goods , including food and apparel , rose 0.3 % on the heels of the same increase in August . A notable exception to the general trend was apparel , where sales fell 1.5 % in September . Analysts attributed the softness in non-durable goods to warm weather and the desire by consumers to save money to buy more big-ticket items such_as cars . In a third report , the Fed said a strike by workers at General Motors Corp . kept industrial production flat in September after 15 months of increases . The production figure was also attributable to a decline in electrical utility output , analysts said . Capacity utilization -- the rate at which manufacturers run their factories -- remained a healthy 84.6 % , but that was off from a revised 84.8 % in August , the highest level since the late 1980s . The September manufacturing figures allayed fears that bottlenecks , which could lead to future price rises , are likely . * INFLATION ADJUSTMENT : Social_Security recipients to get 2.8 % increase in benefits .
