   <TEXT> Xu Honggang is a Chinese hero for changing times . Remember Lei Feng , the army truck_driver whom Chairman Mao chose in 1963 as a role_model for the people ? Lei , who was accidentally killed by a falling telephone_pole in 1962 , was portrayed as the embodiment of the selfless individual serving his comrades and his leader . He even washed his comrades ' socks . &quot; Learn from Comrade Lei Feng , &quot; Mao Tse-tung , China ' s powerful Communist_Party boss , urged 31 years ago today . And around this time each year , all_over China , the nation ' s youth strive to perform good deeds , though few go as far as sock-washing . On Feb . 15 , for example , the Beijing Youth News_reported that 28 students of the Youth League Branch of the No . 112 Middle_School cleaned the house of an elderly woman and cooked her a batch of dumplings . But this year , another hero , also from the People ' s Liberation Army , or PLA , has been added_to the Chinese pantheon . The story of Xu Honggang and his heroic battle with a gang of robbers speaks_to a different , less-innocent China . Unlike the nation at the time of Mao and Lei , this is a get-rich-quick China , where corruption is rampant and violent crime causes a growing fear . This is a what ' s-in-it-for-me , &quot; market_economy &quot; China , where newspapers are_full of accounts of citizens who refuse to come_to the aid of their compatriots even when they are in dire straits . &quot; Mao ' s time was an age of idealism , when Lei Feng was the perfect hero , &quot; explained a young Chinese official over a recent dinner . &quot; Now , we have entered the era of materialism . These days we need a hero who will do something even when there is no chance of profit. &quot; Throughout Chinese history , leaders and sages have sought to shape society by holding_up individuals as exemplars of virtue . The tradition derives from the teachings of Confucius , whose system of ethics for a stable society became the basis for centuries of Chinese government . Confucianism emphasized virtue , selflessness , duty , patriotism , hard work and respect for hierarchy , both familial and societal . His disciples reinforced its lessons by popularizing stories about people who represented particular virtues . Chinese children learn at an early age of such heroes as Mu Lan , a woman of the 6th Century who disguised herself as a man and served 12 years as a soldier so that her father , too ill to report for military duty , would not be disgraced or punished . Mu Lan ' s story provides a lesson in both courage and filial devotion . And every summer , the Dragon Boat festival marks the drowning suicide of Qu Yuan , a poet and Cabinet_minister from the 4th Century BC who is the archetype of the loyal government servant . Qu killed himself when his sovereign ' s failure to heed his advice led to national disaster . The annual boat_races , and the accompanying sacrificial tossing of rice into the water , symbolize the effort to save the revered man ' s body from the fishes . Much as the story of the young George_Washington and the chopped-down cherry_tree promoted honesty to early Americans , such heroes have served to inspire the people and unify the country . For a Chinese leadership struggling to inspire today ' s youth , Xu the hero surfaces at a welcome time . His legend has been spread and burnished by dozens of glowing newspaper stories published in recent weeks that give essentially the same account of the incident : The leader of a PLA army communications squad from Yunnan province in the mountainous south , Xu is in his early 20s , square-jawed and handsome . He was riding a long-distance bus in Sichuan province last Aug . 17 when several hooligans began harassing a young_woman , demanding money . When the woman refused to give them money , the ruffians threatened to strip off her clothes and throw her out the window . None of the nearby passengers -- including the woman ' s husband , quaking with fear at her side -- rose to help as the toughs , according to the front-page version in the People ' s Daily , shouted : &quot; No money ! Push her out ! &quot; They were about to do just that when Xu , asleep in the back of the bus , was awakened by the commotion . Without the slightest hesitation or hint of fear , Xu shouted at the men to free the woman . The men , shocked by the challenge , released her but then turned_on Xu . Thus commenced , in the words of the People ' s Daily ' s glowing version , the &quot; battle between justice and evil &quot; on the bus from Niujie town , Yiliang County , Yunnan province to Yunlian County , Sichuan province . Knives flashing , the thugs descended on Xu , stabbing him 14 times and opening_up his stomach until -- the news accounts are quite specific on this detail -- &quot; his intestines came_out of his body. &quot; Inspired by Xu ' s example , other passengers jumped into the fray . The driver stopped the bus and managed to disarm one of the men . The criminals fled . Critically wounded , his insides trailing , Xu pursued the fleeing villains . &quot; One meter , two meters , 10 meters , &quot; continued the People ' s Daily account , &quot; . . . leaving a 50-meter trail of blood , Xu finally collapsed on the highway. &quot; According to the Beijing Youth Daily ' s report , when police arrived_at the scene , Xu at first refused treatment . &quot; I ' m from the PLA , &quot; he reportedly said . &quot; Never mind me . Chase the criminals ! &quot; When news of Xu ' s heroism spread across the rugged countryside , several thousand peasants came_to the Yunlian County Hospital , near the Yangtze_River city of Yibin , to pay tribute to the young soldier . The hospital staff created a special 24-hour watch team to help pull him through . By this time , reports of his exploit and of his admirable humility had reached Beijing , far to the north . In Xu , Chinese leaders saw an ideal model for the worrisome new generation that seemed to have lost the old-time spirit of self-sacrifice and altruism . As soon as he was_well enough to travel , they summoned him to be festooned with medals and heaped with honors and titles such_as &quot; Model of a Loving People , &quot; &quot; Guard of the People &quot; and &quot; Brave Young Hero. &quot; The railway ministry gave special permission for his train to stop longer than usual at stations along the route , so that he could be seen by adoring crowds . The People ' s Daily reported that on Sept . 16 , in Mianchi County , Henan province , &quot; thousands of soldiers and people gathered at the station to meet him. &quot; In interviews , Xu ' s personal modesty was found to be as astonishing as his heroism . He said he owed a debt to the inspiring example of the older generation in his home region in Yunnan , a famous cradle of PLA soldiers . He praised the bus_driver who helped him fight the criminals , and the doctors and nurses who treated him . He said he wanted no special treatment for his deed , only to be allowed to return to his unit as a common_soldier , doing his duty . * &quot; I don ' t consider myself as a hero , &quot; he said . &quot; I am still a son of the people in the Wumeng Mountain area and an ordinary soldier. &quot; When he first returned to his military_unit , he reportedly refused a car offered by local officials . On the train , he gave_up his seat to a woman carrying a child . On Feb . 5 , Xu met with President Jiang Zemin , who gripped his hand long and hard . The president encouraged Communist_Party officials , soldiers and ordinary Chinese to &quot; learn from Xu Honggang. &quot; Newspapers carried long interviews , including an extraordinary Feb . 18 article in the People ' s Daily that covered nearly half the front page . Xu was even invited as a guest on a popular television game_show . During the last week , a time normally devoted to honoring the memory of Lei Feng , new hero Xu was in Beijing delivering inspiring talks to students . Xu ' s heroic apotheosis does not mean that he has been tapped by the government to replace Lei Feng . Guan Changdi , vice director of the Lei Feng Memorial Hall in Fushun , Liaoning province , said in a telephone_interview that the memorial still averages 1 # 000 visitors a day . In March , he said , near the date of Mao ' s call to &quot; emulate Lei Feng , &quot; the crowds swell to 5 # 000 to 6 # 000 a day . As useful heroes , Lei and Xu are alike in several respects , explained a young intellectual in the Foreign Ministry . They both are considered model soldiers of the PLA . Both are peacetime soldiers , whose deeds are not related to battlefield exploits . The basis for Lei ' s fame was a diary he purportedly wrote detailing modestly his everyday good deeds . Most foreign Chinese scholars and even many Chinese now believe that the diary was a fake , created as a propaganda tool by Mao or his aides . For many middle-aged Chinese , however , this knowledge does not diminish their respect for Lei . &quot; When I was young I believed every word of Lei Feng , &quot; a Chinese newspaper_editor admitted . &quot; Even now , I still weep when I see the movie about his life. &quot; Lei ' s heroism was more a collection of relatively mundane acts . Mao chose him to emphasize simplicity and ordinary , selfless dedication . In the conformist Mao years , the kind of person who does his duty without complaint and also performs a raft of good deeds , on the order of helping old_ladies to cross streets , was a useful role_model . The problem for today ' s Chinese leadership is that because he is a dead do-gooder , Lei ' s example is losing its power . Somehow , after a brief flurry in March , the good deeds that it inspires do not last ; neither do the selflessness and lack of complaint . As a popular saying has it , &quot; Lei Feng comes_in March but leaves in April. &quot; Xu , on the other hand , is a living hero who can inspire not only by his acts but also by his presence . He also has other virtues attractive to today ' s youth . Handsome as a matinee_idol , he is China ' s own , living action hero , similar to the heroes in the kung_fu movies so popular here . By his brave acts_on the bus , he also stands_in contrast to the worrisome trend of indifference to people in distress . To emphasize this point , the Legal Daily newspaper on Feb . 23 listed a series of shocking incidents in which people refused to come_to the aid of fellow citizens . In one July , 1993 , case , for example , the newspaper reported that when a man was murdered on the dance_floor of a Hunan discotheque , the other customers simply wiped_up the blood and continued dancing . The young Foreign Ministry official said that in his own family , there had been a near-drowning at a Beijing reservoir because onlookers had refused to jump in the water to help without being paid . Loading his plate with lemon chicken from a sumptuous buffet table , the young_man shook his head . &quot; At a particular time in history , &quot; he said , &quot; you need a hero who fits that time , someone willing to sacrifice for the benefit of others. &quot; In his mind , selfless Xu Honggang , China ' s living action hero , might be just that person .</TEXT>
