   <HEADLINE> ' MT . DIOXIN ' S ' NEIGHBORS FEEL THREATENED ; FLORIDA : THE 40-FOOT-HIGH WALL OF CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS EXCAVATED MORE THAN A YEAR AGO AND LEFT TO SIT . NEARBY RESIDENTS COMPLAIN OF BREATHING PROBLEMS , RASHES AND CANCER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Behind a chain-link fence , where someone hung a hand-lettered banner reading , &quot; MT . DIOXIN , &quot; sits a 40-foot-high wall of contaminated soil covered with gray plastic . Surrounded by homes and businesses in the middle of Pensacola , the mound marks the site of a defunct plant where wooden utility and foundation poles were treated with creosote for 58 years , until the plant closed_in 1982 . Dioxin and other toxic chemicals , suspected of causing cancer , were dumped or leaked there . Residents , some living only a_couple_of hundred feet away , contend the excavation of contaminated soil in 1992 compounded health_problems they suspect were caused by the pollution . And they wonder why the Environmental Protection Agency hasn ' t finished the cleanup . &quot; It looks_like we are stuck_with it , &quot; said David Stallworth , who lives two blocks away . &quot; that ' s why we are trying to get relocated. &quot; But federal_officials insist there is no immediate public health threat , so evacuations aren ' t warranted . Stallworth blamed the excavation for aggravating his bronchial condition , but no health assessment has been conducted to verify whether the pollution is responsible_for breathing problems , rashes , cancer and other complaints of residents . EPA excavated to a depth of 45 feet and fenced the site . For more_than a year , enough dirt to fill 12 # 500 dump_trucks has waited for disposal . Formerly owned by bankrupt Escambia Wood Treating Co. , the site has not been added_to the priority list of EPA ' s Superfund program , the first_step toward a permanent solution . Until then , no decision can be made on how to dispose_of the soil . The excavation cost about $ 4 million . The estimated cost of completing the job is at least $ 25 million and possibly much more . It could take two years or more once work begins . Officials in EPA ' s Atlanta regional office said they are pushing hard to get the project on the list . They made_it one of the top three in priority among nearly 6 # 000 sites in the eight-state Southeast area , said Narindar Kumar , site assessment chief in EPA ' s regional Superfund office . &quot; I ' m aware of all_the concern on the part of the citizens and we ' ve got congressional people also interested , &quot; Kumar said . It ' s a temporary solution. &quot; If all goes well , the site should be added_to the list in mid-1994 , he said .</TEXT>
