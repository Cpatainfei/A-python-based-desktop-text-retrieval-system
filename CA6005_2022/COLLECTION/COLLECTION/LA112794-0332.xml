   <TEXT> Serbian nationalists besieging the Bihac &quot; safe area &quot; in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday ordered its Muslim defenders to surrender or face annihilation -- a catastrophe the U.N. peacekeeping mission said it was powerless to prevent . Bosnian and Croatian Serb rebels have positioned surface-to-air_missiles around their artillery emplacements to ward_off NATO air strikes aimed at halting their onslaught , said an official at U.N. Protection Force headquarters here . &quot; The most critical thing about Bihac is that there are SAM batteries to the south , which makes_it a bit of a deterrent for us , and it ' s critical for NATO as they risk having their planes shot down , &quot; said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity . &quot; From a tactical and technical point_of_view , there is little UNPROFOR can do. &quot; Two British Tornado fighter planes were fired at Saturday with one surface-to-air_missile as they flew a routine air patrol over the Serb-held town of Donji Vakuf in central Bosnia , reported Capt . Jim Mitchell , a spokesman at NATO ' s Southern Command in Naples , Italy . Neither plane was hit , and NATO made no immediate threat of retaliation . The U.N. mission ' s decision to hold fire as Serbian gunmen advanced deeper into Bihac outraged Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic , who accused the U.N. special envoy for the Balkans , Yasushi Akashi , of condemning those in the purported safe area to death . &quot; Mr. Akashi is responsible_for the deaths of 70 # 000 people in ( the city of ) Bihac , &quot; Silajdzic told reporters in Sarajevo , the Bosnian capital , after reportedly being told by NATO that no protective air strikes could be launched because the U.N. authorities &quot; do not want to turn the key. &quot; U.N. commanders in Bosnia and officials of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization operate a &quot; dual-key &quot; approach to using air_power , meaning that both forces must endorse any air strike . Silajdzic said he had appealed_to NATO Secretary_General Willy Claes to take action to protect civilians in Bihac but was told the Western alliance was powerless to move without U.N. support . Bihac ' s mayor , Hamdija Kabiljaqic , said the city ' s residents were in panic . If Bihac fell overnight , he told news_agencies , there would be a &quot; slaughter. &quot; A senior U.N. civilian affairs officer in Sarajevo acknowledged to journalists there that the mission had failed in its task of maintaining the six U.N.-designated safe areas for civilian victims of the 32-month-old war . &quot; It ' s quite clear that we have failed to deter an attack on the safe area , &quot; Colum Murphy said . &quot; We were supposed to deter attacks on civilians and to protect the civilian population. &quot; Continued heavy fighting was reported in and around Bihac a day after NATO warplanes were summoned to conduct air strikes against the besieging rebels , only to be called_back before dropping their payloads . Some U.N. commanders fear that flexing NATO ' s military muscle might bring reprisals against peacekeepers in Bosnia . &quot; There is a limit to how much force we can use in a peacekeeping mission , &quot; Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , the U.N. commander in Bosnia , told the_British Broadcasting Corp . Although the rebels continued to ignore repeated U.N. warnings to cease attacks on Bihac , there was no call_for NATO air_power Saturday , U.N. mission spokeswoman Claire Grimes said . Aid workers and Bosnian officials told news_agencies that the Serbian rebels resumed their heavy artillery pounding of the safe area at daybreak . But Grimes said U.N. military observers in the area judged the detonations to be Serbian antiaircraft rockets being fired over , rather than into , the safe area . &quot; They are exploding in midair . It ' s not shelling . Maybe they are being used for effect , to scare the 5th Corps , &quot; Grimes said , referring to the Bosnian government troops from the Bihac region . During the 3-week-old Serbian assault on Bihac , which followed a dramatic breakout of Bosnian government troops from the pocket and their capture of some strategic territory , the rebels have grabbed back all that they lost and about one-third of the U.N.-designated safe zone . Thousands of Muslims from the seized area fled in panic into Bihac ' s crowded city_center . Conditions were described as &quot; desperate. &quot; Refugees huddled in cellars and shelters in Bihac , which has been cut_off from most humanitarian aid since May by the Croatian Serbs who control the territory west and north of the pocket and have been backing the Bosnian Serbs , who hold all land to the east and south . U.N. actions in_regard_to Bihac were being limited to diplomacy , Grimes said , noting that a civilian official had traveled_to Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale , near Sarajevo , to press the rebels to agree to a cease-fire . In New York , the U.N. Security_Council met in emergency session Saturday and adopted a statement condemning the Serbs ' &quot; flagrant and blatant &quot; entry into Bihac and calling_on all parties to negotiate a cease-fire . The council said the cease-fire should be pursued as part of an overall settlement for Bosnia proposed by the five-nation &quot; Contact Group &quot; on the Balkans conflict -- the United States , Russia , Germany , France and Britain . And three U.S. warships carrying 2 # 000 Marines were headed closer to the region . The Pentagon had announced Friday that it had dispatched the troops to the Adriatic_Sea to help rescue peacekeepers if necessary . Rebel Serbs took more_than 250 Canadian , French , Russian and Ukrainian U.N. peacekeepers hostage Thursday to deter threatened air strikes . And 1 # 200 Bangladeshi soldiers have been trapped in the Bihac area in northwestern Bosnia for days . But the touchiness of any American involvement in the Bosnia morass was demonstrated once more when Sen . Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas , one of the most international-minded Republicans in the Senate , objected to the deployment of Marines even to evacuate U.N. peacekeepers . Kassebaum , interviewed on CNN ' s &quot; Evans and Novak &quot; program , said , &quot; We have said we weren ' t going_to send ground troops in. &quot; Asked by Rowland Evans , &quot; So you do not think any Marines should go ashore ? &quot; she replied , &quot; No , I don ' t , under the circumstances. &quot; At the United Nations , where U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright briefed the Security_Council about the deployment , a U.S. official said the Marines were dispatched only as &quot; a precautionary measure &quot; in case protection or evacuation of American , allied or U.N. personnel is necessary . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic derided the move , telling reporters : &quot; ( They ) send 2 # 000 Marines , then they have to send 10 # 000 more to save the 2 # 000 . . . that ' s the best way to have another Vietnam. &quot; The Bosnian Serb military hierarchy had demanded that Bosnian government forces defending what is left of the Bihac enclave surrender by 8 p.m. Saturday , local_time . &quot; You are completely surrounded , &quot; chief_of_staff Gen . Manojlo Milovanovic said in an ultimatum broadcast by rebel-controlled television . &quot; If you don ' t want to think_about your lives , you ought to think_about the lives of your civilian population. &quot; The U.N. mission had no immediate reports on what transpired after the deadline passed . Aid workers with the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees in the pocket reported heavy fighting around Bihac ' s hospital , which is thronged with wounded , said the refugee agency ' s Zagreb spokesman , Peter Kessler . Fighting and &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; have already displaced 2 million people in Bosnia and eft 200 # 000 dead or missing . Times staff writer Stanley Meisler in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
