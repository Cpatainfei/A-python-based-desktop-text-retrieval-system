   <HEADLINE> 3 CONVICTED IN KILLINGS OF POLICE_OFFICER , GROCER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three men were convicted of first-degree murder Thursday for killing a Maywood police_officer , and two of them were also found guilty of murdering a Van Nuys market owner , clearing the way for a jury to determine whether they should be sentenced to death . A Los Angeles Superior_Court jury found Jose Contreras , Benjamin Alberto Navarro and Edgardo Sanchez Fuentes guilty of the May 29 , 1992 , shooting of Officer John Hoglund , who was gunned_down as he responded to a silent burglar_alarm at a Maywood market . Hoglund , 46 , was the first officer in the history of the Maywood Police_Department to be killed in the line_of_duty . Contreras and Fuentes were also convicted of murdering Lee Chul Kim , 49 , who was shot on May 4 , 1992 , in the freezer of his grocery_store in Van Nuys after he returned from the bank with a large amount of cash . The announcement of the verdicts pleased friends of Hoglund who were in court Thursday . &quot; I ' m stunned , I ' m amazed , and I think it ' s great , &quot; said his fiancee , Terri Smith , who noted Hoglund had set their wedding date the night before he was killed . * Fuentes and Contreras were each convicted on 38 counts -- including murder , robbery , assault with a deadly weapon and stun guns -- stemming from a series of seven robberies . Navarro , who was not charged in connection with the Kim slaying , was convicted on 32 counts for his role in five of the robberies . The three men were also found guilty of a laundry list of special allegations that expose them to the death_penalty , including killing a police_officer and committing murder during the course of a robbery and to avoid arrest . Fuentes and Contreras , who were each acquitted of two counts of robbery , were also found guilty of the special allegation of committing multiple murders . &quot; I think it ' s a wonderful verdict , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Susan Speer , who co-prosecuted the case with Deputy Dist . Atty . Michael Grosbard . To convict the men , all_in their early 20s , prosecutors relied_on a security camera videotape that clearly captured the images of the three defendants inside the burglarized Maywood grocery_store , just minutes before the shooting of Hoglund . At one point in the video , some of them were shown walking_around the store after the robbery , drinking Gatorade . Prosecutors also alleged that during the robberies , which spanned an area from Paramount to Van Nuys , the defendants used electric-shock stun guns on employees to torture them into handing_over money , threatened to cut_off one woman ' s fingers and shoved a gun in another man ' s mouth and threatened to blow his brains out . The trial will continue Monday with the start of the penalty phase , during which jurors must decide whether the three should be sentenced to death . &quot; We ' ve known from the outset that the fiercest battle is going_to be waged at the penalty phase , &quot; said James Leonard , an attorney for Contreras . &quot; I ' m confident that after a jury hears all_the evidence about Mr. Contreras ' life they will reject the death penalty. &quot; Eric K . Davis , an attorney for Navarro , who described the verdicts as &quot; expected , &quot; said he will present a psychologist who is an expert on Central_American culture to testify on behalf of his client , who is from El_Salvador . &quot; My client has never denied his involvement , but our position has always been . . . that the death_penalty is not the appropriate punishment , &quot; said Davis , who described Navarro as the lookout during several of the robberies . James Coady , a deputy public_defender representing Fuentes , could not be reached Thursday for comment . Speer said she plans to present her own evidence showing two of the defendants committed violent crimes in the past . The prosecutor said Navarro has a prior armed robbery_conviction and Fuentes has a prior conviction for possession of cocaine base and had been arrested for attempted robbery . * The penalty phase is expected to last about a week , attorneys said . Hoglund ' s fiancee said she planned to celebrate Thursday ' s verdicts with friends and family at the slain officer ' s favorite Mexican restaurant in Duarte . &quot; I don ' t want John ' s memory to be forgotten , &quot; she said . &quot; He died in the line_of_duty . He ' s a true hero. &quot; She added that &quot; the sadness that came when we lost John resurfaced , &quot; last week with news of the slaying of LAPD Officer Charles Heim at a Hollywood motel . &quot; He too had all his future ahead of him , &quot; Smith said . &quot; His baby , his health. &quot;</TEXT>
