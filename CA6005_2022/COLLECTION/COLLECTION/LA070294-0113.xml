   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / ROUND OF 16 ; TODAY ' S GAMES AT A GLANCE ; AT RFK STADIUM WASHINGTON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Spain vs . Switzerland * TIME : 1:30 p.m. PDT * TV : ESPN , Univision * KEY MATCHUPS : This is a battle of teams that mirror each other . Both bland , both defensive minded , neither with much chance of showing_up at the Rose Bowl in the third week of July . The Swiss have advanced as far as the quarterfinals once in six World Cup appearances ; the Spaniards have survived this second round twice in eight appearances . In three first-round games , Switzerland outscored its opponents , 5-4 . Spain outscored it opponents , 6-4 . Each team took 50 shots . Switzerland gave_up 24 shots , Spain 25 . The game will be decided in the matchup of midfielders . Spaniards Juan Antonio Goikoetxea and Josep Guardiola have combined for three goals and one assist . They will be pitted against Georges Bregy and Alain Sutter , Swiss midfielders who have also combined for three goals . The most important midfielder , however , could be the one who doesn ' t play . Spaniard Jose Luis Caminero , who scored twice in a five-minute span against Bolivia , picked_up his second yellow card of the first round in the final minutes of a victory and will sit_out this game . The Swiss ' two top forwards , Adrian Knup and Stephane Chapuisat , could be in_for a beating . Spanish defenders Albert Ferrer and Abelardo Fernandez have teamed for 17 personal fouls , more_than Switzerland ' s entire defense combined . This game also marks the return of a third powerful Spanish defender , captain Miguel Angel Nadal , who sat_out the last two games because of a red-card violation in the opener . * OUTLOOK : It is uncertain which teams will show . Will it be the_Swiss team that muddled through a 1-1 tie with the United States and a 2-0 loss to Colombia or the_Swiss team that soundly whipped Group_A champion Romania , 4-1 ? Will this be the Spanish team that gave_up two goals in the final minutes to South_Korea in a 2-2 tie or the Spanish team that led defending champion Germany for 24 minutes before fighting to a 1-1 tie ? The only certainty is that the_Swiss team comprises individual stars who often act like individual stars . The Swiss had only one assist in the first round . The Spaniards , nine of whom played for the same Barcelona team in their country ' s tough pro league , act much more like one unit . They compiled six assists . It is that sort of behavior that usually wins World Cup games . The Spaniards also have the advantage of having played their first-round games under the broiling sun in Dallas and Chicago . The Swiss played twice indoors in Pontiac , Mich. , and then once in the low humidity of Palo Alto . * OUTCOME : The reign of Spain will not fall gently on the_Swiss . Neither is playing well enough to win this game and be considered among the world ' s best eight teams , but the Spanish have enough ability to fake it for 90 minutes . Spain by two .
