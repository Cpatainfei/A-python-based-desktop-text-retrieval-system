   <TEXT> Asia Thailand : Fifty-five Americans are being held_in Thailand on drug charges , the U.S._government reports . Of the 31 women and 24 men , one has been sentenced to death and 17 are serving life sentences . According to the State_Department , many of these were gullible individuals who carried the drugs for others , having been lured by offers of free vacations or lucrative payoffs . Some were reportedly unaware that drugs were hidden in their luggage . The State_Department notes that prison conditions in Thailand are extremely harsh , and that Thai officials frequently do not notify the U.S. Embassy of the arrest of Americans for minor drug offenses . Nor are Americans the only foreigners affected : The Reuters news_agency reports that a court in Bangkok sentenced a British woman to life imprisonment for heroin trafficking , and that more_than 30 Britons are serving drug-related sentences in the Southeast Asian_nation . South_America Brazil : Faced with growing lawlessness in Brazil ' s most visible city , the state governor of Rio de Janeiro bowed to the urgings of President Itamar Franco early this month and allowed the army to take_control of state and local law_enforcement . The army will coordinate the fight against bandits and drug_traffickers who have chased businesses and tourists out of Rio . More_than 23 people a day are murdered in the city of 10 million , which has one of the world ' s highest murder rates , twice that of Los Angeles . Rio ' s tourism revenue has dropped $ 800 million a year since 1988 . Ten days after the army mobilization , Times correspondent Ron Harris reported that Rio ' s drug_traffickers were lying_low and bandits were disappearing from the streets . Russia Although Washington has somewhat softened its harsh assessment of Russian air safety , two accidents have raised new concerns . The two Oct . 29 crashes in Siberia killed at least 26 people and raised the death toll so far this year to at least 287 . In July , the State_Department had warned of the hazards of Russian flights since the breakup of Aeroflot into about 320 newly privatized national and regional airlines , or &quot; Baby-flots. &quot; But on Oct . 14 , the U.S. Embassy in Moscow said a review by U.S. and Russian experts had given Russia &quot; minimally passing marks &quot; for air safety . U.S._government employees were given permission to travel on any Russian airline that is certified to operate internationally . Times correspondent Sonni Efron in Moscow quoted Russian officials as saying the two airlines involved in the latest crashes , Yakutavia and Aeronika , lacked such certification . Briefly . . . Cambodia : After the murders of three Western hostages by Khmer Rouge guerrillas , Cambodia ' s King Norodom Sihanouk warned tourists to avoid his country , Reuters reported . The three -- a Briton , a Frenchman and an Australian -- had been captured July 26 . The Khmer Rouge also warned Westerners to stay out .

India : Police freed a Bay Area resident and three Britons who were held hostage by Kashmiri separatists . Times correspondent John-Thor Dahlburg said the kidnaping of the four foreigners in New Delhi could further damage India ' s travel industry , already reeling from an outbreak of plague .
