   <HEADLINE> U.S. SEEKS RESPECT , NOT CASH , AT WEMBLEY ; SOCCER : AMERICANS , INSULTED BY BONUS OFFER , ARE HONORED TO BE THERE . ENGLISH WANT REVENGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Striding briskly up the dark ramp , which smelled faintly of the greyhounds that race here on other days , the coach of the U.S. national soccer team unclasped his hands from behind his back and raised them to the cloudy heavens as he entered the stadium . &quot; This is like a dream , &quot; he said , twirling , taking_in the 360-degree view of the stadium ' s soccer tradition . In his reverence , Bora Milutinovic failed only to genuflect . After all , this was Wembley Stadium , soccer ' s cathedral , and the occasion was his team ' s arrival Tuesday evening to practice in preparation for an international match against England tonight . The U.S. players have been steeped in the lore of Wembley since they arrived last week , getting a crash course on the stadium ' s hallowed status . They got their first look_at the north London stadium Tuesday . As they jogged on the putting-green field , many stole glances at the stadium ' s partially covered stands and a dark sky . The U.S. team ' s presence here signals its kinship with the international soccer family has grown less remote , a hoped-for windfall from its recent role as World Cup host and the team ' s advance beyond the tournament ' s first round . England is itself the host of the sport ' s next major event , the European Championships in 1996 , and like the United States with the World Cup , the hosts don ' t have to go_through qualifying . Casting_about for competition , the_English invited the American team , as much for its value as a curiosity as for its respect as a soccer entity . Some U.S. players are already familiar to the_English , six of them playing for professional teams in this country . Two -- midfielder John Harkes and goalkeeper Juergen Sommer -- have even played_at Wembley . Five other American players play elsewhere in Europe and are gaining reputations . Respect appears to be the operative word surrounding this game . The U.S. players have told reporters how honored they are to be playing England -- Thomas Dooley said a victory over England would mean more_than beating Italy or Brazil . And most of the players have all but drooled at the sight of Wembley , much less the thought of playing in it . Harkes , who is not expected to play because of a muscle strain in his left calf , said he would do almost anything to be able to play again in Wembley , this time in a U.S. uniform . Somehow , none of this has translated into reciprocal respect . It remains a mystery just what it might take_for the U.S. team , or even any American players , to gain the respect of English soccer pundits . The U.S. presence in the World Cup is explained as the gift given to the tournament host . England ' s absence from the World Cup is blamed on former national coach Graham Taylor , reviled as incompetent . Then there is the_matter of the $ 25 # 000 . It is the amount of the &quot; bonus &quot; offered by the_English Football Assn . should the U.S. win . The FA explained the unorthodox bonus was meant to ensure that the Americans field a competitive team . &quot; This was the FA ' s idea to put a bit of an edge to the game , &quot; FA spokesman David Bloomfield said . From the reaction of the U.S. players , the offer of $ 25 # 000 might as well have been delivered with a slap in the face . Their incentive to win the game is now to stuff the money down the throats of their critics , rather than financial_gain . Regardless of the motive , the bonus has had its intended effect . &quot; It ' s an insult , &quot; said Harkes , who plays for Derby County in the_English First Division . Harkes said the attitude is born of English arrogance about the game they brought_to the world . &quot; They don ' t think anyone else can play the game . They haven ' t forgotten we beat them . Never ( will ) . This is the killer revenge game. &quot; The United States has beaten England . It is the most under-reported statistic in English newspapers this week . It happened during the U.S. Cup in June 1993 , at Foxboro Stadium outside Boston . No one thought the United States had a chance . Before the game , the confident English media called the prospect that England might lose , &quot; the end of the world. &quot; The U.S. team won , 2-0 , which shocked the world but failed to end it . Both players who scored in that game -- Dooley and Alexi Lalas -- are here with this team , a team long on resolve but still short on international experience . Today ' s game , which the United States again is not expected to win , is not for the money , it ' s for respect .</TEXT>
