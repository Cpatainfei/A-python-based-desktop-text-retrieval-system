   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; THE PLOTTERS WHO SOUGHT TO KILL HITLER : A GIFT TO HUMANITY AT_LARGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the first news fragments about the failed attempt to kill Adolf Hitler came_over the ticker_tape in the afternoon of July 20 , 1944 , it was almost unbearably exciting . I was working in the Political Intelligence Department of the_British Foreign Office . We had a machine that gave us intercepts of the German news_agency . I listened to Hitler ' s midnight broadcast . There was , alas , no doubt about it -- it was his voice . He denounced the &quot; tiny clique &quot; of traitorous , ambitious and stupid officers who had tried to rob the German people of its leadership and way_of_life . The stab in the back of the embattled nation had failed . There would not be another 1918 . The traitors would be exterminated mercilessly . The next day , there seemed to be a silver_lining in the cloud of disappointment when official word spread in London that the failure of the plot might be a good thing . Success might have made a martyr of Hitler and might not have broken his spell . And it might have started a new legend that traitors had deprived Germany of victory . Ten years later , in July , 1954 , Theodor Heuss , the first president of the Federal Republic , called the desperate and costly attempt to overthrow the Nazi regime a &quot; gift to Germany ' s future. &quot; It was , I should say , a gift to humanity at_large . For , despite the sometimes obvious diplomatic use made of &quot; other Germans &quot; who laid_down their lives for a better Germany and a better Europe , despite the usefulness of &quot; the German resistance &quot; as fig_leaf and olive_branch after the war , there is more involved than Germany and its image in the world . It was not a foregone_conclusion that killing Hitler , even if possible , was the best thing to do -- though it would free the soldiers from the oath of loyalty they had all sworn to him personally . Thus , Helmuth James von Moltke thought it better to let Hitler live and bear the responsibility for the defeat . Moltke was an international lawyer working in the Abwehr , the military intelligence service , as legal adviser to the German High_Command . He helped save many lives . He was one of the victims of the purges carried_out after the July 20 assassination attempt . The judge saw Moltke as at least as dangerous to the regime as those who had taken violent steps to end it . Moltke had opposed the Nazis from the beginning , but had argued against the assassination and coup attempts . He did not think they would bring_about the necessary change in the German mentality . The young Protestant theologian , Dietrich Bonhoeffer , held the opposite view . He thought that killing Hitler would be an &quot; act of liberation , &quot; freeing the Germans from their stupefaction with the Nazi display of power . So he and his brother-in-law , Hans von Dohnanyi , were part of the circle of plotters . They were both members of the Abwehr , too , protected by its head , Adm . Wilhelm Canaris , and in_league with his most active right-hand_man and plotter , Hans Oster . One of their good works -- the successful transfer of a small group of Jews to Switzerland under the guise of German intelligence_agents -- led to Bonhoeffer ' s and von Dohnanyi ' s arrest in April , 1943 , and to a serious weakening of the Abwehr . Bonhoeffer , Dohnanyi , Oster and Canaris were executed two years later . They were among the hundreds killed in connection with the plot , who were by no means all members of the military . Others had gone_to the gallows and guillotine , to prisons and concentration_camps , for less ambitious and more purely altruistic aims . Students of the White Rose group disseminated their leaflets to rouse the conscience of their countrymen -- and were beheaded . Bernhard Lichtenberg , the dean of the Catholic cathedral of Berlin , regularly said public prayers for the Jews ; after serving his jail sentence , he died on his way to Dachau . Although the Cold_War and the division of Germany and Europe are over , their after-effects are still with us . Divisions between left and right , even of East and West , persist , straining German commemorations of the anti-Hitler resistance . Social Democrats don ' t want Chancellor Helmut Kohl to be the main speaker at the ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the assassination attempt . Some of the people connected with the permanent center of commemoration at the Stauffenbergstrasse in Berlin are worried that the military Establishment is muscling in . Conversely , others object to including exhibits representing Moscow-sponsored groups . Yet , the decision seems right not to censor them , but to let people make_up their own minds about the likely motives and relative merits of the diversity of Germans who opposed the Nazi regime . The Allies called the events of July 20 a &quot; Generals ' Plot. &quot; It was a misnomer . Obviously , generals were needed if there was to be any chance of overthrowing the Nazi regime . But the literature on the German resistance to the Nazis has made_it clear how hard it was to recruit more_than a_few generals to the cause . In the end , it was left to a colonel , Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg , to apply the final impetus . And it turned_out that he had to be in two places at once : planting the bomb in Hitler ' s headquarters in East Prussia , and directing the coup in Berlin . It was obvious the chances were slim . But the desperate attempt had to be made -- even if it was likely to fail . The cost in lives was terrible . Peter Yorck von Wartenburg , the co-founder , with Moltke , of the Kreisau Circle that worked_on plans for a better future , joined in the conspiracy after Moltke ' s arrest in January , 1944 , as did other Kreisauers . Yorck was one of the accused in the first of the ghastly People ' s Court trials that followed the assassination attempt . His last letter before his execution speaks_of atonement for &quot; the guilt we all bear. &quot; He gave his life in expiation of the crimes of the regime he had fought . And that , surely , is the significance of the attempt of July 20 , 1944 : There were people who tried to end the abomination , though there was hardly any chance of success ; and the sacrifice of their lives was a demonstration of the sprit of humanity in an inhuman age. *</TEXT>
