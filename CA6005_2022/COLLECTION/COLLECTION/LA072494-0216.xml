   <HEADLINE> CAMPAIGN ' 94 : ISSUES AND ANSWERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two candidates are running in the Nov . 8 election to represent the 41st Congressional District . They are Democrat Ed Tessier of Pomona and Republican Jay C . Kim , the incumbent , of Diamond Bar . Where they stand on four issues : Health_Care Tessier : &quot; First , I support maintaining a private sector health_care system so that market forces will maintain flexibility and competitiveness . Second , I believe universal coverage must be a goal by the end of this decade . I support efforts to expand access to current health_care plans by eliminating most eligibility restrictions . For the working poor , I would support eligibility in current poverty-focused health_care systems . Third , I oppose financing new public sector coverage by taxing health_care benefits or imposing mandatory employer ' contributions. ' Only sin taxes ( cigarettes , alcohol , ammunition ) seem acceptable. &quot; Kim : Did not respond to this question . Education and Health_Care Benefits for Illegal Immigrants Tessier : &quot; Increasing our control of our national borders is imperative . However , denying undocumented children access to education would cause crime to increase and threaten us with the return of mass exploitation of child labor . It would not reduce illegal immigration . Similarly , refusing treatment to the undocumented ill would not reduce illegal immigration , but only threaten the public health. &quot; Kim : I &quot; favor curtailing both health_care and educational benefits &quot; to illegal immigrants . Crime Tessier : &quot; I support ' three strikes and you ' re out ' legislation for violent criminals and boot camps for young offenders . I support more severe prosecution of parole violations and oppose any early release of violent felons . However , I believe that our best public investment is in crime prevention . We must increase the number of police_officers to match the crime_rate . . . . Community policing , cops on the beat , junior police corps and trained resident patrols are all necessary. &quot; Kim : Opposed anti-crime bill approved by the House earlier this year that is now pending before a House-Senate conference committee . &quot; We must pass more stringent measures to control rampant violent crime at the local level. &quot; El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station Tessier : &quot; Historically , expansion of aviation infrastructure has meant long-term job growth and economic expansion . I support the concept of converting the El Toro base into a commercial airport . However , in this recession , public investment must be cautious , clearly demonstrating an economic benefit . For example , private sector investment must be secure and the conversion process should not jeopardize the operations of other facilities such_as Ontario or John Wayne airports. &quot; Kim : &quot; This is a local decision that is_best handled at the local level. &quot; Source : Individual candidates</TEXT>
