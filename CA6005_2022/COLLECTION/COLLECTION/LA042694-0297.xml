   <HEADLINE> RICHARD NIXON : 1913-1994 ; SAN CLEMENTE AND WHITTIER WILL HOLD NIXON MEMORIALS ; TRIBUTES : MUSEUM WILL HAVE AN EXHIBIT OF MEMENTOS FROM HIS CAREER ; COLLEGE WILL HOST SERVICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Admirers of Richard Nixon who want to avoid the crowds in Yorba Linda can attend one of two smaller memorial gatherings being held today in San Clemente and Whittier , two other Southern California communities that claim a special affection for the former President . In San Clemente , the site of Nixon ' s former Western White_House , a local museum will hold an exhibit of mementos from his long political career . The public also is invited to attend the Whittier College Nixon Hometown Memorial at 12:30 p.m. on the campus that was Nixon ' s alma_mater . Nixon ' s younger brother Edward , 63 , a cousin and four of the former President ' s Whittier College classmates who had remained his close friends are among those scheduled to offer eulogies . &quot; We want this to be a very warm , heartfelt memorial and not a political event , &quot; said college spokeswoman Leslie Baer-Brown . She said the college rejected offers from several congressmen who wanted to speak at the memorial , but didn ' t know Nixon personally . The invocation at the memorial will be given by T . Eugene Coffin , former pastor of East Whittier Friends Church where Nixon was a member . Although Nixon was born in Yorba Linda , his family moved to Whittier when he was nine years old and he grew_up in the town , attending Whittier High_School and working after school in his parents ' grocery_store . After graduating from high_school , he enrolled at Whittier College , where his mother and several aunts and uncles had gone before him . At Whittier College , Nixon was a history major , served as student body president , played football , co-founded a fraternal society , wrote for the school newspaper and was an activist who worked to lift bans the Quaker institution had_on dancing and smoking . &quot; The Whittier College family has always claimed him , &quot; said Marygene Wright , Nixon ' s cousin , who will be among a number of Nixon relatives attending the Whittier College memorial . Clint Harris , a classmate of the former President , said that Nixon had attended his 25th , 45th and 50th class reunions . &quot; He never lost his love for his old friends and for the little college he went_to , &quot; said Harris , recalling that Nixon served many years on the Whittier College Board of Trustees and was a generous financial supporter of the college . Baer-Brown said college officials originally intended to hold a private ceremony , but changed their minds when they were &quot; flooded with calls starting the day after he died from people who wanted to participate in some sort of memorial . Some were upset that the ( funeral ) service at the ( Nixon Library ) was going_to be private. &quot; If skies are clear , Baer-Brown said , the memorial will be held at the college ' s 3 # 000-seat Amphitheater . But if it rains , she said , equal seating will be offered at the gymnasium , called the Graham Activities Center . Those who attend the college memorial event also will have a rare opportunity to view a collection of gifts the Nixons received from people around the world and then donated to the college . The collection is kept_in the Nixon Room of the Bell Wardman Library . The room usually is closed to the public for security reasons , Baer-Brown said . But today , she said , the display will be open between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. and between 1:30 and 3 p.m. In San Clemente , the seaside town where Nixon vacationed during his presidency and recuperated after the Watergate scandal , the local historic society is planning a special show of Nixon memorabilia today at Casa Romantica . The Spanish-style villa at 415 Avenida Granada was the home of the city ' s founder , Ole Hansen . San Clemente Historic Society President Dorothy Fuller said the Nixon artifacts are exhibited on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 1 and 4 p.m. But this week , the museum will be specially decorated with bouquets , including yellow roses that were Pat Nixon ' s favorites . She also said refreshments will be offered and docents will greet guests and ask them to sign the visitors ' book that will be marked to record those who came_to remember the former President . Fuller said that at first members of the historic society had planned to arrange car pools to take San Clemente residents to today ' s memorial ceremonies at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda . &quot; But when we found_out we could not park any closer than about four blocks from the library and that we would have to stand at a distance from the activities where we would n ' t be able to see anything , we decided to double our efforts to invite people to our museum , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
