   <HEADLINE> GUN BILLS FACING BIG BARRICADES ; LEGISLATURE : BACKERS OF NEW CONTROLS HAVE LITTLE OPTIMISM THIS YEAR . GUN OWNER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE REGROUPED AFTER DEFEATS AND ONE RELATIVELY BENIGN BILL HAS BEEN TROUNCED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In spite of the Legislature ' s election year war on crime , enactment of substantive new controls on guns faces huge political barricades . Historically , enacting restrictions on gun ownership in California has been a struggle , even under circumstances considered favorable . This year , there is little optimism among proponents . Already , the Legislature has trounced a relatively benign bill that would have toughened penalties for illegally carrying a concealed gun . Another proposal limiting the number of bullets that can be loaded into a gun is paralyzed on the Assembly floor . The chances appear worse for more far-reaching bills , which range from outlawing the civilian sale , exchange , manufacture or import of handguns to the licensing of handgun and ammunition buyers . Other proposals include limiting buyers to one pistol or revolver a year and authorizing local_governments to adopt tougher firearms ordinances than the state laws enacted in Sacramento . &quot; I don ' t expect to see a lot done with guns , &quot; said Sheriff Glen Craig of Sacramento , an influential veteran lobbyist for law_enforcement who supports tighter regulation of guns . Although recent polls indicate public support for some new gun_controls , there are countervailing political pressures . Among them : * The April 12 recall election of veteran Sen . David A . Roberti ( D-Van Nuys ) by gun activists and others has sent a political tremor through the Capitol . Whether he survives or not , Roberti ' s enemies have made a strong_point just by mounting the recall . Election-conscious incumbents , especially Democrats in marginal districts , have been reluctant to support any move that could be interpreted by opponents as tinkering with basic gun ownership -- even for law and order reasons . * After suffering defeats in landmark fights over banning assault weapons and subjecting all firearm buyers to a 15-day waiting period in 1989-90 , the National Rifle Assn . and other gun owner organizations have regrouped and helped elect several sympathetic candidates who are opposed to further restrictions on guns . Pro-gun supporters have been able to frame much of the debate around the argument that Californians no longer can depend_on law_enforcement for protection and instead must arm themselves for safety . At the outset , the new legislative session had appeared tailor-made for gun_control reformers . Congress had finally overcome years of resistance by the gun lobby and passed the Brady bill , which President Clinton swiftly signed . The national law requires a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases . California law is tougher , mandating a 15-day wait for the purchase not only of handguns , but rifles and shotguns as well . Gun_control activists also got a boost from opinion polls that reflected a revulsion with crime and support for a crackdown on firearms , including registration of handguns . &quot; This should be the year to take_back our streets from the arms merchants and their busy lobbyists , &quot; said state Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) , who recently declared his candidacy for governor . Assemblyman Terry B . Friedman ( D-Los Angeles ) said he intends to introduce legislation prohibiting the civilian sale , exchange , importation or manufacture of handguns in California starting next year . Friedman , who is running_for a Superior_Court judgeship , has proposed the bill in spite of its poor chances of success because he said only bold measures can be effective . &quot; In addition to sentence enhancements and putting more police on the street , we must take_away the handguns that make crime so deadly , &quot; Friedman said in a memo asking colleagues to sign_on as co-authors . So far , only five have done so . In the Senate , retiring Sen . Gary K . Hart ( D-Santa Barbara ) , a moderate , and Hayden , a liberal , introduced packages of gun_control bills . One Hart bill would require handgun purchasers to be licensed every four years , similar to the licensing of automobile drivers . Hart said the California debate rages between the argument that citizens must protect themselves with guns and the contention that accessibility to guns makes California a more dangerous place . &quot; It is a race between a civilized and rational response and a Beirut , &quot; Hart said . One Hayden bill would repeal the state ' s preemption of the field of gun regulation and authorize city_councils and boards of supervisors to adopt tougher laws than those imposed by the Legislature . Several cities favor such authority , including Berkeley . But foes of gun_control long have argued that restrictions on firearms enacted in the name of crime control unfairly target law-abiding citizens while lawbreakers act with impunity . Instead , they propose the abolition of plea-bargaining and tougher sentences for criminals . Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy ( R-Monrovia ) , a leading defender of gun ownership , argues that imposing additional restrictions , especially in an era of high crime , &quot; denies the right of citizens of this state to defend themselves. &quot; In the first showdown of the new session over guns , law_enforcement came_up battered last month in the Assembly at the hands of the gun lobby , Republicans and a handful of Assembly Democrats . The battle was joined over a bill by Assemblyman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) that would have allowed district_attorneys to charge people with either a misdemeanor or a felony for carrying a concealed gun without a permit . Now , the offense is a misdemeanor . Backed by Republican Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren and statewide police and sheriffs organizations , Katz characterized his bill as urgently needed in the fight against armed street gangs and others . But opponents assailed it as veiled gun_control that could subject otherwise law-abiding citizens to three years in prison . As an alternative , they argued for greater access to concealed weapons permits . Even though Democrats , who are more likely to vote for gun_control than Republicans , heavily outnumber the GOP in the Assembly , the bill failed on a 40-34 vote . Eight Democrats broke ranks to join Republicans in voting no . Two Democrats and two Republicans , both former law_officers , abstained . Katz blamed the defeat on NRA lobbying . Law_enforcement also drew private criticism for mounting a weak counteroffensive , a point conceded by Sheriff Craig . &quot; It wasn ' t a full-court press . It probably was not organized as effectively as it could have been , &quot; Craig said . It was the big push of the law_enforcement lobby , consisting mostly of police_chiefs , sheriffs and prosecutors , that made the difference in the narrow passage of the 1989 assault gun ban . Hart said the active involvement of law_enforcement also will be key in the 1994 debate . &quot; It ' s an important factor_in the politics of the Legislature and gun_control , &quot; he said . But Assembly Speaker Willie Brown ( D-San Francisco ) , who argues that guns &quot; ought to be out of every community , &quot; said that although gun_control bills are &quot; always in_trouble , &quot; prospects this session are especially poor . &quot; The gun lobby and the gun nuts in this state have an enormous amount of power because they have virtually 100 % of the ( Assembly ) Republican caucus and some of the Democratic caucus , &quot; he said . Katz said that if legislation empowering prosecutors to file felony charges against illegal carrying of a gun cannot win approval in a law and order year , &quot; I don ' t know how they ' re going to pass anything else. &quot; The odds for enacting other anti-gun legislation , he said , &quot; is going_to be virtually impossible. &quot; Critical to the outcome of gun_control legislation has been timing and public_opinion . The murders of five children in a Stockton schoolyard and the wounding of 30 by a madman firing an AK-47 provided the shock needed for the Legislature and Gov . George Deukmejian to ban assault guns in 1989 . More recently , however , the police retreat during the Los Angeles riots and the subsequent rush by frightened Angelenos to buy arms was seized upon by pro-gun forces , who said it showed that citizens realize they need guns for protection . Mountjoy maintains that the public mood has swung in favor of guns since passage of the assault gun ban . &quot; There is a great feeling out there that nobody can protect us , &quot; Mountjoy said . &quot; I think they ( gun_control advocates ) are going_to have to prove their case a lot more this year than they have before. &quot; In the shadow of the debate is the recall election April 12 of Roberti , Senate sponsor of the assault gun law . Roberti contends that gun owners launched the campaign against him in retribution for his authorship of the bill . &quot; The implication , whether it is expressed or implied , is very clear : If you vote for laws that the NRA or members of the NRA don ' t like , they will recall you or attempt to recall you , &quot; Katz said . The NRA ' s chief lobbyist in Sacramento , Steve Helsley , said the NRA is not financially involved in the recall . But Sen . Don Rogers ( R-Tehachapi ) , a pro-gun spokesman , said the recall election of Roberti is sending &quot; a clear message to the Legislature that you had better stop interfering with our 2nd Amendment rights or you are going_to be_on our list of projects for recall. &quot; Gun_Control Proposals Gun_control bills are facing an uphill battle in the state Legislature this year . Here are some proposals that have been introduced : * Licensing : Would require handgun buyers to be licensed by the state_Department of Justice after passing the existing background check . A onetime fee estimated at $ 45 to $ 60 would be charged . The tamper-proof license could be renewed every four years if the holder passed a safety test . ( SB1275 , Hart ) . * Ammunition : Purchasers would have to display a state handgun license and a California driver ' s license to buy handgun ammunition . Now , those prohibited from buying handguns can legally purchase ammunition for pistols and revolvers . Also , the attorney_general would be empowered to ban &quot; cop killer &quot; bullets . ( SB1276 , Hart ) . * Magazine limits : In an effort to reduce firepower , the number of center-fire rounds in a detachable magazine would be restricted to 15 for pistols and 10 for rifles . Detachable magazines for shotguns would be limited to six shells . ( SB1128 , Roberti. ) * Handgun numbers : Patterned after a newly enacted Virginia law , civilian purchases of a pistol or revolver would be restricted to one per year . The legislation is intended to gradually reduce the number of legal guns that are stolen and resold in the underground market . ( SB1277 , Hart ) . * Seizing guns : Defendants named in domestic violence protective orders would be prohibited from owning or possessing a gun during the life of the order . If a court found that the defendant posed a reasonable threat of violence to someone else , law_enforcement could seize the subject ' s guns . ( SB1278 , Hart ) . * Local control : Local_governments , reflecting local needs , could enact gun restrictions tougher than those imposed statewide by the Legislature and governor . The state has long preempted the entire field of gun regulation . ( SB822 , Hayden ) .</TEXT>
