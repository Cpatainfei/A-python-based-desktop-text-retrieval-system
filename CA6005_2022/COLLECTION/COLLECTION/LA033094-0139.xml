   <HEADLINE> VALLEY BRIEFING : AFTERSHOCKS THERAPY ; UNDERSTANDING EARTHQUAKES AND THEIR OFFSPRING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For millions of Southern Californians violently awakened in the darkness Jan . 17 , the events of 4:31 a.m. will live_on in memory as a single , terrible instant in time -- the 1994 Northridge earthquake . However , it is important to realize that earthquakes are almost always part of a sequence of related seismic activity . Seismologists refer to the temblor with the largest magnitude as the mainshock . Smaller quakes before and after the mainshock are called foreshocks and aftershocks , respectively . Although the greatest amount of energy is released in the mainshock , much of the redistributed stress is later released along the fault in the form of aftershocks . According to seismologists , the mainshock of the Jan . 17 earthquake struck at 4:30:55 a.m. one mile south-southwest of Northridge at a point approximately 11 to 12 miles beneath the earth ' s surface . It was initially described as a magnitude 6.6 quake , but Caltech later upgraded the figure to 6.7. Using a different measuring_system , the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden , Colo . placed the magnitude at 6.8. To date , seismologists have identified more_than 6 # 000 aftershocks to the initial earthquake , including 317 magnitude 3.0-3.9 , 43 magnitude 4.0- 4.9 and seven 5.0-5.9. How Earthquakes Happen An earthquake occurs when rocks along a fault in the earth ' s crust slip suddenly , releasing energy in the form of seismic waves . Beginning at a single point known as the hypocenter , the quake actually represents a rupture along a varying length of the fault . The epicenter is the point on the earth ' s surface directly above the hypocenter . Living With Aftershocks The rate of aftershocks declines quickly following the mainshock , the relative number of small to large aftershocks does not . Seismologists have estimated that for every magnitude 5 aftershock in a sequence , there will be roughly 10 magnitude 4s , 100 magnitude 3s and 1 # 000 magnitude 2s . Therefore , a magnitude 5 aftershock striking weeks after a larger mainshock is entirely consistent with previous recorded seismic activity . In fact , it should be expected . The magnitude difference between a mainshock and the largest aftershock averages 1.2 , so a 6.8 earthquake would have few aftershocks greater than 5.6. A quake is considered an aftershock as long as the rate of seismic activity is greater than the rate preceding the mainshock . A Quake ' s Energy Earthquakes release energy that scientists measure in metric_units called ergs . One erg is the amount of energy it takes_to move one gram of mass one centimeter in one second . Some examples of an earthquake ' s energy force : Energy released ( in millions of ergs ) : Energy released ( in millions of ergs ) : 20 # 000 , 000 # 000 , 000 # 000 Magnitude ( not to scale ) : 7 Example or equivalent : Energy generated by Niagara Falls_in four months Energy released ( in millions of ergs ) : 600 # 000 , 000 # 000 , 000 Magnitude ( not to scale ) : 6 Example or equivalent : Energy to launch 2 million NASA space shuttles Energy released ( in millions of ergs ) : 20 # 000 , 000 # 000 , 000 Magnitude ( not to scale ) : 5 Example or equivalent : Energy created by atomic_bomb test in 1945 . Energy released ( in millions of ergs ) : 600 # 000 , 000 # 000 Magnitude ( not to scale ) : 4 Example or equivalent : Kiloton of TNT exploding Energy released ( in millions of ergs ) : 20 # 000 , 000 # 000 Magnitude ( not to scale ) : 3 Example or equivalent : Smallest quakes commonly felt Magnitude 5 Aftershocks Since Jan . 17 , seven aftershocks of magnitude 5.0 or greater have occurred in Los Angeles and Ventura counties , causing additional damage . Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey have said that the region has a better than 1-in-3 chance of another magnitude 5 aftershock within the next year . 5.6 Jan . 17 , 3:33:30 p.m. 5.2 Jan . 17 , 4:43:08 p.m. 5.9 Jan 17 , 4:31:58 a.m. 5.1 Jan . 19 , 1:09 : 28 p.m. 5.1 Jan . 19 , 1:11:44 p.m. 5.1 Jan . 29 , 3:20:35 p.m. 5.3 March 20 , 1:20:12 p.m. Sources : Caltech ; U.S. Geological Survey ; &quot; Earthquakes &quot; by Bruce A .
