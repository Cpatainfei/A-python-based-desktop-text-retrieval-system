   <HEADLINE> FRENCH OPEN / OTHER MATCHES ; GRAF , PIERCE TO SLUG IT OUT ON CLAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Spain ' s clay-court specialists continued to exhibit their considerable skills at Roland Garros Stadium on Tuesday as second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and No . 3 Conchita Martinez advanced to one of the semifinals of the_French Open . But the match with the most interest in women ' s tennis is Thursday ' s other semifinal , in which top-ranked Steffi Graf of Germany will face Mary Pierce of France in a matchup of the game ' s fiercest hitters . Sanchez Vicario survived a tough second set and a partisan crowd to defeat Julie Halard of France , 6-1 , 7-6 ( 8-6 ) , and earn a berth against Martinez , who beat Sabine Hack of Germany , 2-6 , 6-0 , 6-2 . Graf defeated Ines Gorrochategui of Argentina , 6-4 , 6-1 , and has reached the semifinals of every French Open since 1987 , when she won the first of her three titles . No . 12 Pierce routed Petra Ritter of Austria , 6-0 , 6-2 , and has lost only six games in five matches . It is the best showing in the_French Open during the open era . Andrea Jeager lost eight games to reach the semifinals in 1982 , and Chris Evert had five losses at the U.S. Open in 1976 , but played only four matches because of a bye . Pierce , born in Montreal , raised in Florida but playing for France , already is ensured of moving_into the top 10 for the first time when the next rankings are released , thereby becoming the first Frenchwoman to do so since Francoise Durr in 1976 . Against Ritter , Pierce won the first seven games before the Austrian finally held serve . Ritter , who had never advanced past the second round of a Grand_Slam tournament , rallied in the fifth game to break Pierce ' s serve for only the second time in the tournament , but failed to sustain the momentum . &quot; I was a little bit nervous because I really wanted to win and do_well , &quot; Pierce said . After an uneven first set , Graf was satisfied with her game . She played patiently against the unheralded Argentine , and any thought_of a third set was out_of_the_question . Sanchez Vicario knew what was coming when she played Halard on Center Court in the early evening . The French have not enjoyed much success in their tournament , so they embrace any compatriot who reaches the late rounds . &quot; I wasn ' t about to let it bother me , &quot; Sanchez Vicario said . But it almost did when she allowed Halard to get_into the match in the second set . Realizing the predicament , Sanchez Vicario went_to work . She did not want a third set , as Halard ' s play improved with each cheer . &quot; I decided to take more risks in the tiebreaker , &quot; Sanchez Vicario said . &quot; Every time I was aggressive and took a risk , I won the point. &quot; Sanchez Vicario believes the experience will give her confidence . That is something Martinez could use when the two meet Thursday . Martinez had lost in five consecutive French Open quarterfinals . After dropping her first set to Hack , the thought occurred to her . &quot; Losing in the quarterfinals six years in a row , I ( thought ) , ' Oh , my God , I guess I am never going_to pass it. ' &quot; Tennis Notes In today ' s men ' s quarterfinals , Alberto Berasategui of Spain will face No . 5 Goran Ivanisevic , and Hendrik Dreekmann , 19 , of Germany , will meet No . 46 Magnus Larsson of Sweden . If Ivanisevic fails to reach the championship match , the tournament will have an unseeded finalist for the first time since Mikael Pernfors in 1986 . . . . Sergi Bruguera ' s only other victory over Andrei Medvedev was in last year ' s French Open semifinals , also in straight sets .</TEXT>
