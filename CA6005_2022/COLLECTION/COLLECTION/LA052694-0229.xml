   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; SHORTAGES AMONG COFFEE-GROWING NATIONS DRIVE PRICES HIGHER ; COMMODITIES : THE COLLAPSE OF A 1989 INTERNATIONAL TRADE ACCORD HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY WOEFUL HARVESTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like someone who ' s had too many cups , world coffee markets are wired these days with the price of beans rocketing higher , thanks to worsening shortages in Colombia , Brazil and the other big coffee-producing nations . The commodity price of whole , unroasted beans has roughly doubled since last summer , with the latest surge occurring in the past week . And coffee experts say prices could double again before it ' s over . The dramatic rise -- which was predicted long ago by coffee-growing nations as the inevitable result of the collapse of an international cartel in 1989 -- is described as a cyclical response to the low prices that prevailed just a year ago . When prices tumble as they did steadily from 1989 to 1993 , growers save money by skimping on fertilizers and other agricultural practices , opening the door to crop disease and infestations that can slash the size of crops for years . Shortages follow , bidding prices back_up . That and this season ' s late Indonesian harvest had more to do with the surge in prices than did a recent scheme by 28 coffee-growing nations to withhold beans from the market , said Judith Ganes , a coffee analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York . As production fell and consumption remained flat , estimated stockpiles have tumbled by half , Ganes said , triggering a classic supply-demand reaction in prices . As recently as last July , the average world price of a pound of green , or unroasted , coffee_beans stood at 52 cents . On Wednesday , the price stood at $ 1.28 a pound . Ganes predicted that the price will exceed $ 2 within four months . &quot; What matters right now is there aren ' t enough beans , and the growers won ' t be able to recoup before 1995 or 1996 , &quot; Ganes said . &quot; I think the bull_market is just starting. &quot; Though good news for those members of the lately toothless coffee growers ' cartel that have beans to sell , it spells trouble for coffee ' s &quot; Big Three &quot; -- Procter &amp; Gamble , Kraft / General Foods and Nestle -- as they struggle to hold_the_line on retail prices and limit the further loss of customers to pricey , higher- quality gourmet blends . There was little impact at the supermarket level until this week , when General Foods , which distributes the Maxwell House brand , raised its price to grocers by 25 % to about $ 2.50 for a regular can . That is sure to cause a spike in retail prices and risk a further loss of market share , said Tom Pirko , president of Santa Barbara-based Bevmark Inc. , an international beverage consulting_firm . Pirko said the high-volume roasters -- purveyors of such name brands as Folger ' s and Maxwell House -- are plagued by razor-thin profit_margins . Until now they have held_the_line on prices to hang_on to customers who might otherwise opt_for the gourmet coffees . Now that the makers of the cheaper canned coffees have started to boost retail prices to avoid losses , Pirko said , the trendy gourmet firms typified by Seattle-based Starbucks could grab still more market share by keeping current prices and forgoing some of the generous profit_margins they now enjoy . &quot; The question is , are they smart enough to know that ? &quot; Pirko said . &quot; Their margins are enormous . They could absorb much bigger ( green_bean price ) increases than we ' ve seen so far. &quot; Today ' s volatility has its roots in the 1989 breakup of the International Coffee Agreement , a pact among 50 producing countries and 21 consuming nations , including the United States . The agreement set export quotas aimed at keeping prices stable . U.S. support of the agreement stemmed from coffee ' s importance to the economies of dozens of nations , including about 25 million jobs in Brazil , Colombia , Kenya and Indonesia . Of particular concern was Colombia , where the United States favored the bolstering of a farm export that might otherwise be replaced by illegal plantings of marijuana and cocaine . But the nations couldn ' t agree on further quotas , and the breakup of the pact sent world prices into a tailspin and cut deeply into revenues of the coffee-growing nations . Repeated efforts to reach a new agreement have failed . Last July , the 28 biggest producing nations , excluding Mexico , declared an agreement to begin withholding 20 % of their exports as of Oct . 1 , and prices began to climb . But despite today ' s claims of success by Brazilian and Colombian coffee negotiators , most outside experts say prices were destined to surge even without the so-called retention scheme . The proof lies_in the continuing rise since the program , having already exceeded its price targets , was called_off in April . Meanwhile , the biggest coffee importer , the United States , last year dropped its support of any coffee quota system , making such export controls difficult to maintain . The coffee cartel needs the cooperation of consuming nations to keep the exporters honest by monitoring the flow of_imports . Whatever the cause , the surge in prices is especially welcome in Colombia , the No . 2 producer , where trees have been hard hit by disease . Coffee production fell from 17 million bags to 13.6 million in the past year . About 150 # 000 acres of coffee_trees were eradicated to make room for more profitable crops , such_as fruits . As with all commodities that consumers can get_along without , there will be a self-correction , even if some people are willing to pay $ 6 to $ 9 for a pound of coffee . Indeed , as steep as the recent price hike has been , today ' s levels , unadjusted for inflation , merely return prices to the $ 1-to- $ 1.50 range that prevailed during most of the 1980s . A price spike to $ 2 at the start of 1986 was short-lived . Economist Fred Gray of the U.S. Agriculture_Department ' s Foreign Agricultural Service said : &quot; Coffee ' s not an absolute necessity . If prices get too high , people will switch to tea or something else. &quot;</TEXT>
