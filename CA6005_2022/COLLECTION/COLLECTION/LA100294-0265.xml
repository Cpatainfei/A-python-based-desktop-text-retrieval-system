   <HEADLINE> FINDING PROPER HOMES FOR KIDS WITHOUT THEM ; SOCIAL_SERVICES : THOSE WHO WILL PLACE A 10-YEAR-OLD WHOSE AUNT IS ACCUSED OF TORTURING HIM FACE A SOLOMON-LIKE DECISION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A father who shot and wounded himself when he and his wife were having marital troubles five years ago . A grandmother . A foster_home of strangers . Over the next few weeks , social_workers , judges , attorneys and therapists must decide which of these options is the best temporary refuge for a 10-year-old boy who was removed from the Orange home of his aunt , 31-year-old Cynthia Medina , last month . Medina is accused of burning the child ' s tongue with hot knives and anally penetrating him with a miniature baseball_bat . Based upon their findings , the Orange County Social_Services Agency will either ask a Juvenile_Court judge to place the boy in a relative ' s home or send him to live_in foster care with people to whom he is not related . The case , which marks the first time that Orange County prosecutors have charged someone with torture , offers a glimpse at the wrenching decisions that social_workers and judges must make in trying to make choices that are in the best interests of children already traumatized by severe abuse . &quot; We ' ve got_to sort through all_of the emotional rhetoric coming at us from every side to figure_out what to do , &quot; said Bob Griffith , deputy director of the Orange County Social_Services Agency . &quot; A lot of times , it can be very complicated and difficult choosing between alternatives , none of which may be ideal , but all_of which have some factors_in their favor. &quot; Sometimes the question of who an abused child should live with is fairly simple . A family member who is willing_and_able steps_forward to take the child , agrees to abide_by the court ' s orders and no one contests the decision . The county pays foster_parents -- including relatives outside the nuclear_family -- to care_for the child ; the amount of the payment depends_upon the child ' s age and special needs . But the 10-year-old boy ' s case illustrates the more complicated cases of family breakdown that increasingly are making their way into the Juvenile_Court system . Many &quot; of these children are damaged by the time they get_to us . They ' re not cherubic little angels , &quot; said Harold LaFlamme , the Santa Ana attorney whose firm represents children in many Orange County dependency cases . &quot; They have bad habits , bad hygiene . Sometimes the placements fail because the foster_parents just simply can ' t handle the kids. &quot; In every case of child_abuse , social_workers confront a host of ethical questions as they try to find the best placement for a child . Is it really in a child ' s best interest to put him in a home with the parents who abused him if a foster_parent who is not related to the child is providing better care ? Is it fair to give adults guilty of abuse 18 months to turn their lives around and reclaim their children ? What of the bonds that the children forge with their foster_parents during this time ? Under the law , in_order to remove a child from his parents and place him in a foster_home , social_workers must prove one or more of the following : placing the child with his parents would pose a substantial danger to his health ; the parent must be unwilling to have physical custody ; the minor suffers from severe emotional damage ; the minor will be at substantial risk of being sexually abused ; the parents are incarcerated . &quot; The parents always have first choice -- even if the parent is the offender , &quot; said Superior_Court Judge David Velasquez , who presides over dependency cases in Orange County . &quot; It ' s only after reasonable efforts have failed to make the parents ' home suitable that you can place the child away from the parents. &quot; Even when parents are deemed not immediately able to care_for a child , the Orange County Social_Services Agency is required by law to give them 18 months to meet a variety of conditions that would make them suitable caretakers . These conditions typically include undergoing drug or alcohol rehabilitation and parenting courses , among other programs . Then it is up_to social_workers to decide whether the parents have truly changed their ways . Although some parents are never reported for abuse again , others continue to physically and emotionally harm their children time and time again . After 18 months -- an eternity in the lifetime of a young child -- social_workers can seek to sever parental rights and place the child in a foster_home with non-relatives if a parent fails to comply with the conditions set by the court . Gene Axelrod , who supervises the attorneys who represent the Social_Services Agency in dependency cases , says the burden_of_proof rests with the county agency . &quot; There has to be clear and convincing evidence before the agency has the authority to place a child in foster care with a non-relative , &quot; Axelrod said . In the Medina case , there is no shortage of relatives willing to take the boy . The boy ' s father and grandmother have filed papers requesting custody , according to social_services officials , who said that the father has &quot; very strong standing. &quot; &quot; He was not the abuser and is at least apparently interested and willing to take the child , &quot; Griffith said . &quot; We are in the process of assessing his capability of caring for and protecting the child. &quot; The boy had been living with his aunt since his parents ' divorce in 1989 , an arrangement that is relatively common , according to social_services officials . Neither parent felt able to care_for the child . On Sept . 8 , the boy was rushed to the hospital suffering from internal injuries allegedly inflicted by Medina . According to authorities , Medina flew into a rage when she caught the boy playing with her marijuana_cigarettes . Prosecutors have charged in court that the boy ' s injuries were so severe that doctors had to perform a colostomy . Medina , a playground supervisor at an elementary_school , has been charged with torture and felony child_abuse . Her 45-year-old husband , Edward , has also been charged with_child abuse for allegedly doing nothing to stop the attack . Although officials refused to discuss specifics of the Medina case , they said their placement investigation routinely includes reviewing police reports and talking to family members , alleged abusers , children , doctors , teachers and neighbors . &quot; The more severe the kid ' s physical problems , the more sophisticated the placement has to be , &quot; LaFlamme said . On Tuesday , the boy was released from the hospital . County social_workers have placed him in a foster_home with non-relatives until they complete their investigation to determine the best long-term home for him . They are scheduled to go before a judge with their recommendation within two weeks . Under the law , they have 21 days from the time the child was taken into county custody to investigate .</TEXT>
