   <HEADLINE> MORNING BRIEFING : SPORTS HEROES AND VICTORIES REIGN IN SPAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Has Spain become the world ' s latest sporting power ? A look_at Sunday ' s results might lead to that conclusion . Miguel Indurain won the Tour de France for the fourth year in a row . Conchita Martinez and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario led Spain to a clean sweep of the United States in the Federation Cup tennis final at Frankfurt . Alberto Berasategui won the Mercedes Cup tennis championship . And Miguel Angel Jimenez won the Dutch Open golf tournament by two strokes . &quot; Today is the Spanish day , with two Miguels winning at_the_same_time , &quot; Jiminez said . &quot; I don ' t know him , but we are brother sportsmen. &quot; * Add Spain : Education Minister Gustavo Suarez Pertierra , in_charge of national sports programs , said : &quot; This exemplary effort , which produces such results , is a prime example for Spanish youth , not just so they learn more about sports , but so they learn to exert themselves. &quot; * Trivia time : Who won the American Professional Soccer League championship last year ? * The real reason : Steve August , traveling secretary of the Boston Red Sox , claims the Seattle Mariners ' Ken Griffey Jr . caused tiles to fall from the Kingdome ' s ceiling . &quot; If they ' d stop blowing_off those fireworks up there in that Kingdome every time Ken Griffey hits a home_run , maybe the ceiling tiles would stay_up there , &quot; August said . * Had to happen : As far as the Philadelphia Phillies ' Danny Jackson is concerned , he was completely justified in hitting the San Diego Padres ' Craig Shipley in the leg with a pitch Sunday . &quot; He stole last night with a 7-1 lead , &quot; Jackson said . &quot; He knew it was wrong . He knew it was coming , and so did everyone else . The ball was down , it wasn ' t at his head or his neck . I just wanted to get a point across . When you do something to embarrass another team , you have to expect something to happen. &quot; * No DH for Spahn : On this day in 1962 , Warren Spahn of the Milwaukee Braves set a National League record for home_runs by a pitcher when he hit the 31st of his career against the New York Mets ' Craig Anderson . * Shame on you : Losses are not taken lightly in Great Britain . After 17-year-old Razvan Sabau of Romania upset Jeremy Bates , Britain ' s No . 1 player , and then Mark Petchey to give Romania a 3-2 victory that eliminated Britain in the Davis Cup , the London Daily Express editorialized : &quot; Britain has been shamefully shoved into the basement of world tennis by a boy barely 17 years old. &quot; * A violent game : The Calgary Stampeders have put Albi the horse on the injured reserve list after the two-year veteran tangled_with a barbed wire fence and hurt her left fetlock earlier this week . Albi races around McMahon Stadium every time the Canadian Football_League team scores a touchdown . Rookie Rocky , a gray gelding , has been activated from the practice roster . * No bargain bill : A rainout caused a rare day-night doubleheader between the Cleveland Indians and the Baltimore_Orioles today at Camden Yards . The park will be cleared between games , and separate admission will be charged . * A little late : An American in England , after purchasing prints of Arnold Palmer , Jack Nicklaus and Tom Morris , said he knew where to get Palmer ' s and Nicklaus ' autographs , but asked where he could contact Morris . Morris won the_British Open four times in the 1860s . * Trivia answer : The Colorado Foxes , 3-1 , over the Los Angeles Salsa . * Quotebook : Griffey on the Kingdome problem : &quot; Don ' t we have to play in a neutral stadium ? How about Tampa ? we ' ll be there in ' 97 anyway. &quot; SHAV GLICK</TEXT>
