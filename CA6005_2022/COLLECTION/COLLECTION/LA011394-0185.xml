   <HEADLINE> KINGS TURN UP THE POWER , THEN TURN OFF WHALERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Wayne Gretzky ' s so-called &quot; office &quot; is behind the net , then Luc Robitaille ' s favorite place to work is next to the crease . Robitaille and Gretzky combined for eight points , and the Kings were impressive on the power_play in their 6-4 victory over the Hartford Whalers on Wednesday night . Gretzky ' s first goal , at 10:34 of the first_period , was his 2 # 400th NHL point . The fickle nature of the power_play ended_up leading the Kings as they were four for eight . But it also caused them and the sellout crowd of 16 # 005 at the Forum a_few anxious moments before it was all_over . It had appeared as though Robitaille ' s second goal and fourth point of the night decided the issue with 2:48 remaining in the game when he scored on the power_play after Alexei Zhitnik ' s slap shot was tipped and trickled under Whaler goalie Sean Burke . Robitaille , from the edge of the right crease , had an easy tap-in . Then referee Denis Morel shocked almost everyone by calling a penalty on King defenseman Rob Blake with 1:32 left . The Kings not only had to kill_off the penalty , but it turned_into a six-on-four advantage when Burke was pulled for an extra attacker . &quot; I knew he was going_to call it , &quot; King Coach Barry Melrose said . &quot; Deja vu . I don ' t know , I ' m clairvoyant . I ' ve been watching the Dionne Warwick station. &quot; Gretzky ended the suspense by getting his second goal of the night and fourth point , finishing_off a give-and-go with Jari Kurri with an empty-netter with 36 seconds remaining . The Kings ( 17-21-4 ) are 6-2-1 in their last nine games and are one point_out of a playoff spot . &quot; It was like pulling teeth tonight , &quot; Melrose said . &quot; The game last night took a lot out of us . It was very hard . We weren ' t at our best tonight , but we still found a way to win. &quot; Said Whaler Coach Pierre McGuire : &quot; Their power_play is obviously very talented . You are talking_about a lot of rifles there , and they ' re all full of bullets. &quot; Yet it turned_into a close game when the Whalers scored twice to tie the score , 4-4 , starting with Geoff Sanderson ' s power-play goal at 18:41 of the second_period . Then in the third , the Kings could only dodge the danger of the breakaway so_long . Goaltender Kelly Hrudey stopped the Whalers ' first three breakaways , but forward Michael Nylander converted on the fourth at 5:10 of the third . Nylander , having been shut_out twice on breakaways , figured Hrudey out on his third of the night to tie the score at 4-4 . Until late in the second , it had seemed as though the Kings ' potent power_play would be enough to give them some room against Hartford since the Kings have the NHL ' s best power_play at_home with a success rate of 29.8 % . Two of the power-play goals came_in the second_period from Robitaille at 9:20 and Tomas Sandstrom at 13:28 . Those goals gave the Kings a 4-2 lead . It was Robitaille ' s 23rd of the season and 14th on the power_play . Sandstrom , who has 15 goals , has scored five goals in the last five games . The first two King goals came from Kurri at 2:32 of the second_period and Gretzky on the power_play at 10:34 of the first . Gretzky scored when his shot from the lower right circle went_off defenseman Bryan Marchment ' s skate and squirted between Burke ' s pads . Gretzky ' s two goals were his 18th and 19th of the season , and he now needs 18 goals to pass Gordie Howe ' s all-time record of 801 NHL goals . He had been thinking_about his 2 # 400th point , saying : &quot; It ' s kind of funny . For someone to break that , they ' d have to play 24 years and score 100 points a year . So I guess that ' s pretty good. &quot; King Notes Coach Barry Melrose was pleased with forward Dixon Ward ' s debut on Tuesday night against San Jose . Ward , acquired on Saturday from Vancouver for center Jimmy Carson , had three good scoring opportunities , fought Bob Errey and drew a penalty to give the Kings a power_play late in the game . &quot; I liked him , &quot; Melrose said . &quot; He checks . He can take draws . He did everything . He ' s like a bigger ( Tony ) Granato . He makes people mad at him. &quot; . . . Left_wing Warren Rychel ( left ankle bruise ) was scratched against the Whalers . Right_wing Dave Taylor ( concussion ) was scratched for the third consecutive game . Defenseman Rob Blake ( sprained knee ) was going_to sit_out , but he took the pregame warm-up and felt good_enough to play . Forward Phil Crowe was a healthy scratch .</TEXT>
