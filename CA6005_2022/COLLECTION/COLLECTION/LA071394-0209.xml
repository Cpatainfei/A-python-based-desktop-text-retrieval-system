   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : NORTH_KOREA TODAY : A NEED TO JOIN ASIAN DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To understand what ' s ahead for the Korean_peninsula now that North_Korea ' s leader , Kim Il Sung , has died and there are worries over the ability of his son , Kim Jong Il , to succeed him , stop thinking in terms of the Cold_War -- of North_Korea as resolute member of the Communist bloc or as a loony-bin house of horrors where a bloody factional struggle is about to erupt . Think rather of regional development and the interest of North_Korea ' s neighbors -- particularly China -- that there be no disruption in the area . And think_of the late Kim Il Sung ' s reaching_out to the United States just before he died in an attempt to integrate North_Korea into Asia ' s rapidly developing economy . Sure , there ' s always a chance of strife when a longtime dictator passes from the scene , concedes a manager of investments in South_Korea , but it ' s just as likely that what you ' ll see next in North_Korea is Kim Jong Il reaching_out for foreign investment . The country may have several cards to play to get such investment , says Andrew Kim of Sit / Kim International , a New York institutional investment_firm . &quot; Kim Jong Il should be asking_for Japanese war reparations , U.S. aid and investment from South_Korean and multinational companies , &quot; he says . Meanwhile , the wisest policy for the United States and South_Korea would be to flood North_Korea with food , clothing and consumer goods . Send_in surplus grain , fashionable clothes and a_few thousand Kia cars from South_Korea ( the model we know as the Ford Festiva ) . That would give North_Koreans an introduction to the joys of motoring and help Kim Jong Il succeed his father without factional fighting . Indeed , the consumer goods are already coming_in . A healthy border trade carried_on by Chinese merchants is relieving some of the tedium in an economy that has grown poorer in recent years while the rest of Asia advanced dramatically . The gap in Korean living standards is immense : The output of goods and services of North_Korea ' s 22 million people is only $ 869 a person , while that of South_Korea ' s 44 million people is fully eight times that , at $ 6 # 850 a person . The dangers are many and obvious . If factional fighting broke_out and North_Korea ' s moribund economy collapsed totally , South_Korea would have to take_on the support of a far less productive population half the size of its own . Once upon a time , South_Korea wanted rapid reunification with the north ; now it wants gradual development of economic ties . that ' s not to mention the even greater danger a disorderly North_Korea , possessing nuclear materials and an enormous army , would present to South_Korea and to 33 # 000 U.S. troops stationed there . But there are also great opportunities . If North_Korea remains a separate state gradually developing its economy , South_Korea ' s major companies could benefit from less costly production in the north . Japanese business would also be an early investor . And these days , the positive scenario is more likely than the negative simply because North_Korea has no allies and no support from any country , including China , if it doesn ' t develop economically . A point to remember is that North_Korea has always feared being isolated . Kim Il Sung , a clever despot who tried to rule by taking_advantage of help from both the Soviet_Union and China , considered opening Korea to the West in the early 1970s , according to Suh Dae Suk of the University of Hawaii , a highly respected Korean historian who wrote a biography of Kim in 1988 . Kim ' s efforts in the ' 70s , when both Communist powers were welcoming President Nixon , came_to nought . But lately , with the Soviet_Union dismantled and China encouraging capitalist development , Kim tried again by welcoming former President Jimmy_Carter and agreeing to participate in talks with the United States . It ' s likely his intentions will be carried_out by Kim Jong Il , 52 , who has run day-to-day government operations in North_Korea for the last two years . Kim Jong Il has a reputation as a womanizing flake and a sponsor of terrorism , but that doesn ' t mean he or his military_officers are unaware of North_Korea ' s desperate need to join in Asia ' s development . &quot; The Cold_War is over and attitudes are changing -- and not only in North_Korea , &quot; says Michael Robinson , a specialist in Korean history at USC . In South_Korea , the North is no longer seen simply as a place of Socialist demons , but as part of the common development of the modern Korean economy that began at the turn_of_the_century , when Korea came under Japanese rule . Increasingly , Robinson reports , Korean development is being seen in the context of a century of Asian development marked by revolutions from dynastic rule_in China and Korea , by the end of colonialism and by war and conquest . Such philosophical change provides a foundation on which South and North_Korea could cooperate in developments that have immense potential . If North_Korea ' s economy could be brought even to near parity with that of South_Korea , the combined Korean economy would be one of the most productive and one of the richest on Earth . &quot; I am basically optimistic but cautious , &quot; says John Lee , a manager for the Korea Fund , which has more_than $ 300 million invested in South_Korean companies . Ironically , Korea Fund , which trades -- lately at $ 22.375 a share -- on the New York Stock_Exchange , hit its all-time high of $ 43 a share_in 1989 , when the Berlin Wall fell and optimism ran high that a new era was beginning . The sentiment was premature then , but it may be getting a chance to come true now on the Korean_peninsula .</TEXT>
