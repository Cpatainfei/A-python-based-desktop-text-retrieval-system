   <HEADLINE> COURT_ORDERS LONGER SENTENCES FOR KOON , POWELL ; LAW : APPEALS PANEL UPHOLDS CONVICTIONS IN RODNEY KING CASE , BUT IT DENOUNCES TERMS IMPOSED BY JUDGE DAVIES . DECISION WILL PROBABLY MORE THAN DOUBLE JAIL TIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a stunning decision that reopens the Rodney G . King beating saga , a federal appellate_court ruled Friday that U.S. District Judge John G . Davies improperly sentenced the two convicted Los Angeles police_officers and ordered him to give them longer prison_terms . The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected assertions by the two officers that they were improperly convicted , crediting Davies with &quot; impeccable fairness &quot; in managing the explosive civil_rights case that unfolded in his courtroom last year . But Judge Betty B . Fletcher , writing for the unanimous three-judge panel that was hearing the case for the full court , excoriated Davies for making a series of serious errors in sentencing Laurence M . Powell and Stacey C . Koon . The judges ordered Davies to resentence the officers , who have served nearly a year of their 30-month sentences . Defense_attorneys said the hearing is likely to take_place in the next few months . &quot; The sentences imposed by the District Court are inconsistent with the structure and policies of the sentencing guidelines and the federal sentencing statutes , &quot; Fletcher wrote in an extraordinarily detailed opinion that filled two volumes . Fletcher , who was appointed by President Jimmy_Carter , was joined by James R . Browning , a 1961 appointee of President John F . Kennedy , and James M . Fitzgerald , who was appointed by President Gerald R . Ford in 1974 . In sometimes blistering language , the appellate_court ruled that Davies had improperly departed from federal sentencing guidelines when he lowered the sentences based on his findings that the officers would be vulnerable to abuse in prison , that they would pose no danger to the public , that the successive state and federal prosecutions had cast a &quot; specter of unfairness &quot; across the federal case , and that their illegal conduct was provoked by King ' s actions . Davies cited those factors_in departing dramatically from sentences that would otherwise have been prescribed by the federal guidelines . Combined , those issues led Davies to cut the officers ' sentences by more_than half , from at least 70 months to 30 months . Friday ' s ruling could force him to increase the sentences back to 70 months or longer . The federal civil_rights trial was argued in the shadow of the 1992 riots and ended in a city that was nervous about the prospect of another eruption of violence . * Announced on a misty Saturday morning , the guilty verdicts against Koon and Powell -- along with not_guilty verdicts for Timothy E . Wind and Theodore J . Briseno -- were derided by some police_officers and their supporters , but were greeted by celebrations in many areas of Los Angeles . For many , that joy was later undercut by Davies ' decision to impose sentences that were shorter than expected . The officers heard news of their latest setback Friday morning at the federal institution in Dublin , Calif. , where they have been held since late 1993 . Their first word came from a radio report , and they nervously called their lawyers to check the news . &quot; He ' s shaky , &quot; lawyer Michael P . Stone said of his client , Powell , who delivered the majority of the blows during the March 3 , 1991 , incident . &quot; His voice is shaking , and he ' s upset . Larry was putting a lot of faith in the appeal of the convictions , which I was worried about. &quot; Stone said the double disappointment of losing the appeal of the conviction and then facing the possibility of a far longer sentence was a cruel blow . &quot; He ' s getting a double-whammy today , &quot; Stone said . Ira Salzman , the lawyer who represented Koon , said his client also was stunned by the decision . But Koon , a veteran police_sergeant who was in_charge during the beating , weathered two criminal trials and a civil case with barely any hint of emotion . Friday was no different , Salzman said . &quot; He ' s taking it rather well , but he ' s certainly disappointed , &quot; Salzman said . &quot; This is difficult news. &quot; Friday ' s decision means each officer could face sentences closer to the nine years sought by federal prosecutors . &quot; I ' m pleased that the court obviously understood and agreed with our arguments , &quot; said Assistant U.S. Atty . Steven D . Clymer , one of two lead prosecutors in the federal trial . &quot; It ' s a major victory for us. &quot; For critics of Davies who saw the sentences as unfairly lenient , the 9th Circuit ' s action also was welcome news . Edi M.O. Faal , the lawyer who represented Damian M . Williams on charges that he attacked people during the first hours of the 1992 riots , said he was relieved the court recognized that the officers were being given preferential treatment . Others echoed that view and praised the appellate judges for ordering a resentencing . &quot; We ' ve said repeatedly that the judge erred , &quot; said Jose DeSosa , president of the California State Conference of the NAACP . &quot; I ' m thankful to see the appellate_court has upheld that they were found guilty and the sentence was too lenient. &quot; Ramona Ripston , director of the ACLU , said the ruling corrected mistakes that Davies made . &quot; I think it ' s hard for anyone to decide what the sentence should be , but I think the process was totally wrong. &quot; Daryl F . Gates , the retired police_chief who criticized the officers for their role in the King beating but opposed the federal_government ' s decision to prosecute them , was angered by the ruling Friday . &quot; It ' s disgusting , &quot; Gates said . &quot; These two guys have been put_through absolute hell . And to have this added_to it is indication something is seriously wrong with our system . No justice , no justice. &quot; Lawyers for the officers had asked the 9th Circuit Court to overturn the officers ' convictions , primarily on two grounds : that the use of videotaped testimony by Briseno was improper and that Briseno and a key prosecution expert both were tainted by exposure to compelled statements that the accused officers gave to police investigators after the incident . Legal experts called those significant appellate issues , and lawyers for Koon and Powell argued the points in legal filings and in their appearance before the 9th Circuit Court this year . Briseno did not take_the_stand during the federal trial , but prosecutors introduced an edited videotape of his state court testimony . During the state trial , Briseno criticized his colleagues , saying , among other things , that he had seen Powell strike King &quot; above the shoulders &quot; with his baton . Powell maintained that he never hit King in the head , an assertion that was challenged by prosecutors and some witnesses . When Briseno decided not to testify in the federal trial , prosecutors introduced an edited videotape of his testimony in the state case -- a move that lawyers for Koon and Powell said was improper for a number of reasons . Among other things , they argued that they did not have the chance to cross-examine the videotape , that introducing it so close to the end of the trial gave it undue weight , and that Briseno was allowed to testify about opinions on which he was not an expert . The appellate judges disagreed . On the issue of cross-examination , the panel found that lawyers for Koon and Powell &quot; had a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine Briseno in the state trial. &quot; Similarly , the judges ruled_in favor of the prosecution on the other issues regarding the Briseno tape , finding that Davies had appropriately allowed the tape to be played for jurors . The appellate panel also rejected a number of lesser issues , finding , for instance , that the federal trial did not violate the defendants ' rights not to be subjected_to double_jeopardy . Having reviewed those and other defense issues , the appellate panel found that the officers received a fair trial . &quot; After a careful review of the record and the relevant authorities , we are convinced that the district judge correctly resolved each of the legal issues raised by appellants as_to the guilt phase of the proceedings , &quot; the judges concluded . &quot; I ' m sort of knocked_over , &quot; said lawyer Harland W . Braun , who represented Briseno in the federal trial . He called the opinion &quot; neither intellectually courageous nor politically astute. &quot; Like many legal observers , Braun had expected the convictions to be upheld . But he and some others were surprised by the panel ' s decision to order new sentencing of the officers . &quot; I had thought they would affirm everything and be done with it , &quot; Braun said . Instead , the same appellate panel that praised Davies ' handling of the trial sharply criticized him for the way he imposed the sentences . In comments from the bench and in a 54-page sentencing memorandum , Davies found that federal sentencing guidelines called_for a sentence of 70 to 87 months for the two convicted officers . But Davies then ruled that the case was so unusual in several respects that a series of downward departures were warranted . His reasons for granting those departures were criticized at the time -- Loyola law professor Laurie Levenson , who attended the federal trial , said Davies had &quot; gone_out on a limb with those findings. &quot; The appellate_court overruled him on every one . &quot; This opinion constitutes a ringing endorsement of Judge Davies ' trial rulings and a scathing indictment of his unduly lenient sentencing decisions , &quot; said Peter Arenella , a UCLA law professor . &quot; The opinion makes_it absolutely clear there is no justification for any downward departure. &quot; One of the reasons Davies cited for lowering the sentences was that Koon and Powell would be subject_to &quot; additional punishment &quot; that flowed_from their convictions . He said this &quot; punishment &quot; included two types : the additional administrative proceedings to which they would be subjected by the LAPD and the anticipated abuse in prison because of their particular vulnerability as police_officers . &quot; Personal and professional consequences that stem from a criminal conviction are not appropriate grounds for departing , nor are they appropriately considered as part of a larger complex of factors , &quot; Fletcher wrote for the panel , adding that many people who are sent to prison suffer consequences beyond their incarceration . &quot; Individuals may lose their jobs or be foreclosed from serving in future professions ; their marriages are destroyed ; they may be plunged into poverty , &quot; Fletcher wrote . &quot; Some individuals may be deported , while those who have been convicted of drug or racketeering offenses may lose their homes and their investments to the federal_government in forfeiture proceedings . World-class figure skaters may lose the right to compete in international competition. &quot; On the issue of the officers ' vulnerability to prison abuse , the appellate judges also disagreed_with Davies . Some courts have reduced sentences in cases where defendants were particularly vulnerable because of their size , but the appellate_court found that the issues were different in this case , where the vulnerability stems from the positions that the officers held and the notoriety of their offense . &quot; Nothing would prevent this rationale from being applied to numerous groups -- such_as gang members who may face increased abuse from members of a rival gang , police informants or child abusers -- all_of whom face an increased risk of abuse in prison , &quot; the court found . In crafting his sentencing memorandum , Davies had relied_on a combination of several factors -- vulnerability to abuse in prison , the successive state and federal prosecutions and the prospect of further punishments -- to reduce the sentences by a total of three levels under the sentencing guidelines . But it was a fourth issue that Davies said justified the largest downward departure in the sentences : King ' s role in provoking the offense . King was drunk on the night of the incident , he was speeding on the highway , he evaded officers ' attempts to pull him over and he resisted arrest once he pulled his car to a stop on a darkened street_corner in Lake View Terrace . The difficulty with Davies ' reasoning , however , was that the judge also found that King had stopped provoking the officers before the illegal portion of the beating began , more_than a minute into the incident . Thus , Davies ' ruling seemed to suggest that King provoked only legal blows -- raising the question of how he could then reduce the sentences based on King ' s provocation . Prosecutors hammered on that inconsistency in their sentencing appeal , and also noted that police_officers receive special training to deal with provocative suspects . The appellate panel agreed , finding that King ' s actions provoked the initial confrontation with the officers but were not responsible_for the blows that Davies determined were illegal . &quot; By the time Powell struck , and Koon permitted to be struck , those blows for which ( the officers ) were criminally liable , King no longer presented a danger and was no longer persisting_in misconduct , &quot; the opinion states . By striking down virtually all_of Davies ' reasons for lowering the sentence , the appellate_court gave him little room for discretion when the issue returns to his courtroom . First , however , the officers can ask the three judges to reconsider their decision . Failing that , they could ask the full 9th Circuit to review the case , and could appeal_to the United States Supreme Court . With each stage , the likelihood of their prevailing becomes more remote , and both sides said Friday that they expect the_matter to return to Davies ' court by the end of the year . That will set_up an awkward hearing , as Davies may be forced to impose the appellate judges ' wishes even though they are clearly not his own . &quot; His job is to comply , &quot; Levenson said . &quot; I don ' t think he will take it personally . I think he will do what he has to do. &quot; Times staff writers Bob Pool and Carla Hall contributed to this report .</TEXT>
