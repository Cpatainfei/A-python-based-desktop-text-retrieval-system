   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CLINTON BELATEDLY BECOMING A FOREIGN_POLICY PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At a White_House meeting during the crisis over Iraq ' s troop movements near Kuwait , a high-ranking official suddenly noticed something new : President Clinton had taken_charge of the details of_his_own foreign_policy . &quot; He was ticking_off a list of things he wanted done , messages to foreign governments , one , two , three , &quot; the official said . &quot; It was a much more operational kind of involvement than we saw earlier. &quot; After 21 months of focusing largely on domestic affairs -- &quot; like a laser_beam , &quot; he once promised -- Clinton is belatedly turning_into a foreign_policy President . Like all his predecessors since World_War_II , the President is finding that , when things break right , international issues can be exhilarating -- and can help project an image of strong leadership . Lately , things have been breaking right . From Iraq and Israel to Haiti and North_Korea , Clinton has run_up a string of foreign_policy successes , a new experience for a President whose first year was marked by international setbacks . At the same time , the Republican blockade of Clinton ' s domestic proposals in Congress has made international tangles such_as the Arab-Israeli conflict look tractable . With his public approval rating bumping along at just above 40 % , Clinton may well find a warmer welcome in the Mideast than the Midwest . Political aides said they are not sure his visits to Jerusalem and Kuwait City next week will help Democrats in Jacksonville and Kansas City , but they can hardly hurt . ( A Times Poll released this week showed a marked upturn in approval of the President ' s foreign_policy , from 36 % a month ago to 48 % now , but little change in his overall popularity. ) At his news_conference Friday , Clinton acknowledged that until recently , &quot; I never would have anticipated going_to the Middle_East &quot; in the middle of a congressional election campaign . But he argued that any foreign_policy success he is enjoying now is &quot; just a simple coincidence &quot; after &quot; two years of work. &quot; More important -- and more_than coincidentally -- Clinton ' s new enthusiasm for foreign affairs has changed the way his Administration does business and should improve his chances for further success , aides say . The President ' s increased participation in foreign policy-making &quot; may be the most important thing that has changed in the past few months , &quot; one senior official said . During his first year in office , Clinton resisted spending time on foreign_policy and even turned_down a plea from Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher to devote one hour a week to an unhurried , non-crisis discussion of international affairs . But this autumn , the President finally gave_in and added a weekly foreign_policy lunch to his schedule , usually on Thursday or Friday , a senior official said . The session normally includes Christopher , Vice_President Al Gore , White_House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , with lesser aides occasionally invited . The result , officials said , is a policy-making process that is more systematic than in the Administration ' s often-chaotic early days , when Clinton sometimes dropped_in on discussions late in the day and reopened issues that aides believed they had resolved . Now , foreign concerns are even following Clinton on the campaign trail . Last weekend , when he went_to Connecticut and Florida to stump for Democrats running_for Congress in next month ' s elections , Lake went_along to keep tabs on deliberations on Iraq at the United Nations for the President . &quot; Lake was in constant touch with his negotiators . . . ( and ) would brief the President between speeches , &quot; White_House Chief_of_Staff Leon E . Panetta said . And this week , Clinton announced that he will take four days out of his campaign schedule to fly to the Middle_East for the signing of a peace_treaty between Israel and Jordan on Wednesday -- an international diversion that this President would have found almost unthinkable a year ago . Where Clinton once seemed uncertain of his command of diplomatic and military_issues , he has visibly gained confidence , and he now hurls himself into the details of foreign conflicts with all_the zest he once reserved for welfare reform and budget projections . &quot; He had not spent a lot of time on foreign_policy previously as a governor , &quot; a senior aide noted . &quot; The accumulation of 18 months ( of experience ) now means that he remembers the history of an issue all_the more and is getting more and more into the details of things. &quot; Clinton ' s new activism has had one more positive effect : It has stopped -- or at least slowed -- a growing rift between Christopher ' s State_Department and Lake ' s National Security_Council staff . Christopher and Lake themselves appear to work well together , but some of their aides have indulged in bitter whispering_campaigns over which of the two is doing the better job on Clinton ' s behalf -- and which is likely to lose his job first . So bitter had the backbiting become that Clinton had to issue a blunt order : &quot; Cut it out. &quot; Christopher and Lake warned their aides that further sniping would be punished , and they publicly declared their high regard for each other . &quot; We have never been_on better terms , &quot; Lake said . &quot; Better than . . . any time that I can remember , &quot; Christopher echoed . But the tension between the two offices is real , and officials said it reflects more_than just traditional friction between the State_Department and the National Security_Council staff . Underpinning the jockeying is a basic difference in approach toward the rest of the world . Lake is an idealistic , liberal internationalist who wants the United States to use its power to promote democracy in countries such_as Haiti and Rwanda . Christopher is a pragmatic , liberal internationalist who worries about the risks of overextending U.S. commitments . &quot; It isn ' t a fundamental conflict , &quot; a State_Department official said . &quot; But there is a difference over how readily you use U.S. military power in areas that are not of vital interest. &quot; In practice , that has meant that Christopher was more reluctant than Lake to use military power in Haiti , at least initially , and more insistent in warning against using U.S. ground troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina . Another , equally important factor is the widespread perception -- fed by leaks from the White_House -- that Clinton may soon replace Christopher or Lake , or both . &quot; There is a feeling among some staff people that this is a zero-sum game -- that if State gets credit for doing something right , it ' s to the disadvantage of NSC , and vice versa , &quot; an National Security_Council aide said . Staff_members see their own careers on the line in the contest , the aide added : &quot; If your boss goes_down , you go down. &quot; Senior officials said they do not know what Clinton plans beyond a high-level review of his appointments after the congressional elections . But the President told both Christopher and Lake last month that their jobs are safe for the immediate future -- and the recent run of good news on foreign_policy seems to have reduced pressure for change . Ironically , the Administration ' s improving fortunes overseas did not stop the sniping between State and NSC . Instead , the two bureaucracies have been competing to see who gets credit for the upturn . But that may be a backhanded good sign . &quot; In the early months , people were trying to absolve themselves from blame , &quot; a senior State_Department official noted . &quot; Now they ' re trying to grab credit . At least that suggests that things have improved in general. &quot; American Forces Abroad A Times Poll showed Americans ' attitudes about two U.S. foreign_policy ventures : HAITI So far , would you describe the actions taken by the U.S. in Haiti as : Very successful : 20 % Somewhat successful : 55 % Not too successful : 14 % Not successful at all : 8 % Don ' t know : 3 % * How confident are you that a stable democracy can be established in Haiti ?

Approve strongly : 40 % Approve somewhat : 32 % Disapprove somewhat : 12 % Disapprove strongly : 10 % Don ' t know : 6 % Do you think the economic sanctions against Iraq should be lifted because of its undue hardship to Iraq ' s people , or should they continue until Iraq agrees to the terms of the U.N. resolution , or should they continue until Saddam Hussein is removed from power ? Lift sanctions because of undue hardship : 5 % Continue sanctions until U.N. resolutions are met : 35 % Continue sanctions until Hussein is removed from power : 55 % Don ' t know : 5 % Source : Los Angeles Times nationwide survey of 1 # 272 adults ; Oct . 17-19 .</TEXT>
