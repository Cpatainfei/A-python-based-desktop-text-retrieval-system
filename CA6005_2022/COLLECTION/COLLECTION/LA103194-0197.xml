   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A : A VISION OF THE FUTURE ; NEWPORT BEACH EXECUTIVE HELPS INTERPRET TRENDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first of the season ' s economic forecasts for Orange County was delivered Friday at Cal State Fullerton . This , the third such report by the university ' s Institute for Economic and Environmental Studies , was pessimistic about Orange County ' s economic recovery . On a statewide level , signals are mixed . State employment officials said they underestimated job growth in California and that there may have been 200 # 000 more jobs than originally thought to have been created between March , 1993 , and March , 1994 . Here in Orange County , recent announcements of layoffs at Hughes Aircraft Co . in Fullerton and at AST Research Inc. ' s manufacturing_plant in Fountain Valley continue to have businesses worried that a local recovery may be lagging . Michael Meyer , managing partner of the Newport Beach office of accounting and consulting firm Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. , says the lingering recession in California has made businesses anxious to want to understand what is happening in the local economy . Given the increased interest and the numerous signals sent by the various economic reports , analyzing the forecasts made by Cal State Fullerton , UCLA , UC Irvine and Chapman University has become an even more important part of the work Kenneth Leventhal ' s consultants do . In an interview , Meyer discusses the growing importance of these economic forecasts and how his consulting group uses them to advise clients on doing business in Orange County . Question : Why have these regional economic forecasts become so important ? Answer : Every one of our clients , more_than in any time in history , is interested in what is going_on in the economy because we have seen three or four years of a severe recession . Businesses in California had always felt that when there were downturns it was temporary , and now they are very concerned about trying to understand what will be happening . And it is our job to have a good knowledge_base and have good advice to give . * Q : Which of the economic forecasts about the local economy do you use ? A : We look_at all_of them , including the Chapman , UCLA , UCI and Cal State Fullerton studies . Chapman has been doing its economic study and projection of the Orange County economy longer than Cal State Fullerton and has a reasonably good track record at predicting , so we tend to rely_on the Chapman study for Orange County . The UCLA forecast is important even though it has no specific Orange County data . But it has a 40-year track record , so it also is a reliable source and it is well-respected . And whenever we try to find historical trends to predict the future we start with the national and state economy , both of which have an impact on the Orange County economy . In UCLA ' s last report , what I found most interesting was the fact that it was studying the revised employment data from the Employment Development Department and therefore revising its own analysis , which basically concluded that California had come_out of the recession 18 months ago . And to me that type of data and that understanding of the cycles , where ( it appears ) we had been forming a foundation for the past 18 months of future growth , then that helps to evaluate something like a Fullerton analysis , which says jobs are growing at a much slower rate than the EDD says . I am skeptical of that type of an analysis ( by Fullerton ) because of what I read in the UCLA analysis . * Q : Which indicators do you think are the most important ? A : The most important is job creation or loss . We are more focused on jobs than anything else . Job loss and job creation . A good_deal of our client base is in real_estate and there has been a fairly direct_correlation between space occupied in offices , industrial buildings and in-house purchases and with job loss or creation . All indicators are relevant . We are always concerned with consumer confidence -- that impacts home sales . It also impacts the health of all_the businesses that are retail or that are creating consumer products . We are interested in personal and household income levels and household size . We are also very interested in population growth figures . There is not just one figure that is meaningful . * Q : You mentioned consumer confidence . Do you look_at the UCI consumer confidence survey ? And do you find it to be accurate ? A : Yes . That gives a close reading of attitudes in our back yard . And we think it is very meaningful and generally accurate . For example , in home purchases , consumer psychology is an extremely important element . For people to buy homes , they have to feel confident in their jobs and confident that the economy will be strong , so housing prices will be moving_up . They tend to buy more homes . * Q : Which indicators are the least helpful to you and least important to your clients ? A : National Industrial Production may_not be a real high one for us . I am sure there are a lot that are less relevant . We tend to look_at the overall package and use the information to get ideas about the big trends and signs . * Q : What do your clients care most about , state or local projections ? A : They are more interested in the local information . And then they are interested in more microeconomic analysis . For example , if they are thinking_of investing in a retail center they will be more interested in knowing the trends of the population and income and demographics within a five- or 10-mile radius . If they are interested in land_development , they ' ll want to know about the supply and demand of land in the area . * Q : Is there something that is missing in these forecasts that would be useful ? A : If any of them were broken_out for the regions of the county , that would be beneficial . South County ' s economy is very different from North County . The ( proposed ) commercial , industrial development , occupancy and rental rates ( for commercial properties ) in different parts of the county are not reported on by the universities . It is very important to anybody in property ownership ; every employer is occupying space and the more that is occupied is an indication of growth and employment -- and that means consumer purchases . * Q : How do use the information in your own business ? A : We use the forecasts to create our own forecast , and we spend a great_deal of time and money on that . Walter Hahn , who is a Ph.D. ( in economics ) , heads_up that effort and we have a staff of analysts to comb through all_the data . We forecast Orange County and the Inland areas . We also compile an overall economic report for the Urban Land Institute . We never accept the data at face_value . We analyze it and look_at the genesis of the data . Compare it with other sources . Do our own market surveys . Fullerton had been reporting job losses in Orange County . Our judgment is that the area from the 55 Freeway south has been experiencing job gains and we feel it is probably true for the entire county . * Q : Have you ever used the university forecasts to make decisions about your own business ? A : Well , for example , our firm has expanded significantly into health_care in Orange County and that is because we see that the health_care business is one of the biggest expanding businesses in the country and here in Orange County as well . That is just one example of how a business uses these surveys to make a decision to move_into a market or to expand . * Q : What kind of advice do you give your clients based on the forecasts ? A : We advise lenders and the people that are looking_to restructure existing debt . Take_for example , a retail center . We can predict how retail sales will be in the future , so it will know how strong its tenants will be , so it knows how much to invest . And also we use this economic data for portfolio sales when banks or insurance_companies are selling_off large portfolios of properties and mortgages , and we evaluate the derived investment value by projecting into the future and projecting future rents . * Q : What can the average business get_out of such economic forecasts ? A : The average business person gets confused because they get these things from so many different sources . My best advice is to look_at trends over a one-year period and to look_at information , such_as the gross_domestic_product on the national level . But the information they need is more localized than just the county data . They need information on the neighborhood where they have their business or at least the part of the county . Unfortunately , there are not good statistics on neighborhoods or parts of the county available to the local business person to study . So I think their best bet is to join the local Chamber_of_Commerce , go_to local meetings where people exchange information about how local businesses are doing .</TEXT>
