   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; IN JAPANESE POLITICS , OIL AND WATER ARE MIXING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Certainly , the inauguration of a Japanese Socialist prime_minister atop a conservative Cabinet -- including , of all people , Makiko Tanaka , daughter of the late conservative strongman and former premier Kakuei Tanaka -- has to notch at least an eight on the 1994 bizarre-happening scale . After all , Socialists and Liberal Democrats ( conservative in political_orientation despite the name ) have been the oil and water of Japanese politics for 40 years . They have differed sharply over fundamental issues -- defense , the constitution , fiscal_policy and participation of Japan ' s military_forces in U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping operations . Furthermore , Japan is a consensus-driven society , conservatives dominate its politics , the Cold_War is over and the Socialists hold just 15 % of the seats in Parliament . So what ' s with a Socialist running the government ? &quot; Abnormal , &quot; &quot; farcical , &quot; &quot; laughable &quot; were the most common reactions in Japan to the new lineup . Socialist Tomiichi Murayama , famous in Japan for his craggy eyebrows , certainly raised more_than a_few when he unexpectedly defeated conservative retread and former Prime_Minister Toshiki Kaifu for the nation ' s top job . Murayama ' s Cabinet , formed the next day , included five geriatric Socialists ( average age 70 ) in minor posts , 13 Liberal Democrats in the most powerful slots and two from the New Party Harbinger . What ' s going_on ? The same political deck has been shuffled and reshuffled so many times this past year -- the Murayama government is the fourth -- one wonders what game is being played , who ' s dealing , the stakes and whether Japan is ever playing with a full deck . Americans project onto Japanese politics U.S.-style debates over principles , causes , purposes and policies . While analysts may want Japanese politics to be about these things , a desire furthered by the Japanese media , wishing does not make_it so . For example , what passes for a grand debate on Japan ' s world role these days centers_on the ideas of one politician , Ichiro Ozawa , onetime protege of strongman Noboru Takeshita . Ozawa bolted the Liberal Democratic Party , assumed the role of political reformer , preaching widely and loudly against irresponsibility and corruption in Japanese politics and urging Japan to become an activist &quot; normal &quot; country , even a &quot; mini-superpower &quot; in global affairs . OK . Then recent political developments stem from this debate , with one camp supporting , the other opposing , Ozawa ' s bold visions ? Not at all . These events reflect a continuing Japanese political evolution . What ' s happening concerns politics , personalities , winning elections , gaining and maintaining political power . Japan ' s political-correctness code is another key to understanding the events . Deeply rooted in Japanese political culture are norms against self-serving , autocratic , overaggressive conduct . Ironically , Ozawa , renowned for his political instincts , skills at gauging votes and winning , was hoisted by his own petard . His &quot; in your face &quot; campaign to recruit Socialists and Liberal Democrats to Kaifu ' s side &quot; went too far , &quot; crossing the line of acceptability and alienating many key players . Anti-Ozawa sentiments were the glue binding the pro-Murayama coalition . In the coming months , one pressing concern will be political stability . Not that Japan is at all unstable . There are no riots in the streets . The nation is scarcely in &quot; crisis. &quot; But the past year ' s political turmoil has exacted a toll . Legislation has stalled , official trips have been canceled , key decisions are_on hold . No immediate end seems in_sight for the turbulence . Indeed , there are serious doubts about the new government . Past coalition governments have not lasted . Another red_light is public support for the new government -- the third lowest recording ever . And , despite a display of unity , can the opposition-prone Socialists seize this chance to show leadership and purpose ? Still , the fledgling Murayama government has an edge over its predecessor coalitions . Among the reasons : its three-party coalition won nearly 55 % of last July ' s popular vote ; savvy conservative politicians familiar_with their ministries hold key portfolios ; conservatives dominate the Cabinet , veteran politicians who have worked together via formal and informal networks ; the Socialists are the top party in the upper house and a Socialist is speaker of the lower chamber ; a workable right-center coalition has been in place for years , and while the Communists , with 15 lower-house seats , have become politically irrelevant , the Socialists have turned more pragmatic -- a development that sharing power in the new government should hasten . The immediate question seems less whether than when to hold a general_election . Reform legislation aimed at overhauling campaign financing and restructuring election_districts from multimember districts to a single-member constituency system passed the Diet in January and will go_into effect this fall . The best guess is that the Murayama government will not call a quick election under the old system but will delay an election until redistricting becomes a political reality . While a U.S.-style two-party system may emerge from the next election , a three-party structure is as likely , and a multiparty system , with shifting coalitions and alliances , seems most probable . For the moment , the anti-Liberal Democratic_parties are in disarray . &quot; Conservative &quot; is out . &quot; New &quot; is in , to_the_point of exhausting the Japanese vocabulary for expressing it . Perhaps the &quot; new life party &quot; ( Ozawa ' s Shinseito ) may metamorphose into the &quot; new-new life party &quot; to satisfy the public ' s appetite . Ideology matters less than ever , not because ideas are unimportant , but because the status-quo consensus is so solid on fundamentals -- prosperity at_home and stability abroad -- that parties differ less and less on policy , particularly foreign_policy , substance . It is hard to rally a country or a political_party around the status_quo . Despite the fervent wish for national purpose , identity , leadership and vision , these remain desirable , not feasible or realistic , goals in today ' s Japan . No crystal ball is needed to predict that what changes do occur will unfold through the gradualist , reactive , risk-minimizing processes of the past . Its unorthodox composition notwithstanding , Japan ' s new hybrid government is perhaps better equipped to address the economic and social issues facing Japan than were the ragtag coalitions running Japan since last July . One should bear_in_mind , too , that it took a decade for Japanese politics to stabilize after World_War_II . However transitional the arrangement may prove to be , by burying the hatchet and agreeing to share power , two former political rivals have demonstrated the depth of Japan ' s political consensus and the decline of the ideological left as a factor_in post-Cold War Japanese politics. *</TEXT>
