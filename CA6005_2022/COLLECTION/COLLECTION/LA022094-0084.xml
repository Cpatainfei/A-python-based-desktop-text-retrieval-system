   <TEXT> Southern California has always been a place where reality and fantasy intertwine in commercial architecture . Most home design , however , has remained remarkably predictable , even ordinary . But a_few Southland homes stand dramatically apart from their neighbors in appearance . It ' s as if their builders tossed_out the rule books to create houses unlike any others . Here are five homes that would cause most people to ask , &quot; that ' s a house ? &quot; * Santa Barbara ' s Whale House , easily one of the most unusual anywhere , is a work of housing art that took engineer / developer Michael Carmichael and a crew of 20 workers three years to build . When he looked_around his wooded one-acre lot in Mission Canyon , Carmichael wondered how he could design a house without destroying the natural beauty of the site . Finally , he thought , &quot; Why not go_with the free-form shape of the property ? &quot; Inspired by the fanciful creations of Antonio Gaudi , a turn-of-the-century Spanish architect , Carmichael let his imagination run wild . The resulting house has no straight_lines , no flat walls , no conventional floor_plan . In fact , nothing about the house is conventional , including the entrance , which is edged with rocks to look_like a whale ' s mouth full of teeth . A window high above the front_door resembles the whale ' s eye . Three levels of living_space wind around a rock-covered elevator shaft . Some stained-glass_windows look_to the outside , but most windows overlook the open interior courtyard full of oaks and sycamores . Curving rows of cedar shingles make_up the outside skin of the house . What is life like in such an unusual house ? Tobias Hildebrand , the house ' s current occupant , described it as &quot; very , very peaceful . . . almost magical. &quot; &quot; I feel_like I ' m in the world ' s most luxurious tree_house , &quot; he said . &quot; It provides a natural and nurturing environment that encourages flow and creativity and helps me focus. &quot; During construction , the city of Santa Barbara required Carmichael to erect a 10-foot fence around the property , to prevent gawking passersby from getting_into accidents . Now , with mature vegetation providing additional cover , the Whale House is seldom seen . * Privacy is harder to come_by in the seaside Orange County community of Sunset Beach . But it helps when your house sits 87 feet above ground . While utilitarian objects have been converted into homes before , few of these have resulted in structures as dramatic as the Water_Tower House , located at Pacific Coast Highway and Anderson Street . The house , which from below resembles a large wooden tub on stilts , takes full advantage of a 360-degree view with windows in each room and an observation deck at the kitchen / dining level . Former owner George Armstrong bought the 45-year-old abandoned tower and the ground it sits on from the city of Seal Beach in 1980 , and embarked_on a four-year project to make the interior space livable . Armstrong began by cutting the tower off its supports and lowering it to the ground to do the remodeling . Then he removed the outer wooden skin , saving most of the original material to reuse ( and protecting its status as an historical landmark ) . Adding four feet to the diameter and six feet to the height of the tower , Armstrong created a windowed , trilevel , 2 # 900-square-foot round house from the original shell . When the building was completed , the tower was hoisted back_up to its elevated position overlooking the ocean , Huntington Harbor and northern Orange County . An elevator moves passengers from ground_level to the three living levels above ground . The Water_Tower is the perfect home for a person who loves privacy and an unobstructed view of the ocean . &quot; I ' ve lived_in many beach locations and this has it all , &quot; said current owner Bob Odell . * Far inland , in Mockingbird Canyon near Riverside , another one-of-a-kind house is almost impossible to see from the street -- much of the house is underground . Earth-sheltered is a more accurate term than underground because Riverside ' s building_codes didn ' t permit a completely underground house when Solar Terra was built_in 1982 . Conceived at the height of interest in energy conservation , the house has a conventional feel inside and plenty of natural light , although the structure was built into a north-facing slope and uses the insulating power of its underground location for heating and cooling . Architect Charles Brown called Solar Terra a &quot; back to the future &quot; house because man has used the inherent heating and cooling features of the earth for eons . &quot; We added mechanical_systems because we didn ' t have enough faith or experience with the natural technology of earth heating and cooling , &quot; Brown said . Owners Scott and Pam Bergy haven ' t felt_like pioneers in the 11 years they ' ve lived_in the underground home , even though it came equipped with sophisticated UC Riverside monitoring equipment . &quot; Solar Terra proved that earth-sheltered houses like this work , &quot; said Scott Bergy , a commercial pilot . &quot; And we ' ve saved thousands of dollars on electric_bills . &quot; The biggest problem we ' ve had with our home is when a tree root pierced the bedroom wall . It had broken_through the outer rubber lining of the house , &quot; Bergy said . Architect Brown designs more-conventional houses these days , but still has a soft_spot for Solar Terra . &quot; We were trying_out the technology then , anticipating much-higher energy costs in the next few years , &quot; he said . &quot; Everything in the house was the best that could be done . The house still makes us proud. &quot; * When Catherine Gallagher , a clinical social_worker , spotted a picture of the Glass Pyramid House , about to be auctioned in foreclosure , she was intrigued . &quot; I had just decorated a condo that I adored , &quot; she said , &quot; but I was drawn to this most unusual of houses . When I saw it , I knew I wanted to live here. &quot; Set_on a Sierra Madre knoll , out of view of neighbors , the pyramid house is visited by wild animals more often than by curiosity seekers . Gallagher and a maintenance_man send the occasional trespasser packing . The original design of the 2 # 900-square-foot pyramid , built_in 1972 , brought visitors into the house across a koi pond and through a heavy , round door to the partially underground lower level . But the steps became mossy and the door was hard to roll . Now Gallagher uses a ground-level door as the main entrance into her glassy domain . The lower level of the three-tier house enjoys a constant temperature , because it ' s partly underground . In summer , a fan pulls_in cooler air through screened openings in the floor of the ground_level and expels warm air at the top of the pyramid . In the winter Gallagher wears sweaters and uses a portable heater . By utilizing both above- and below-ground living areas , she keeps her electric_bill at a reasonable $ 60 monthly average . In all seasons , house plants relish the abundance of light . &quot; Much of the fun of living here is sharing this wonderful space with friends , &quot; Gallagher said . &quot; They can ' t understand how I can live_in a glass house until they come_over and see what a practical and comfortable home it is. &quot; * Another of the Southland ' s unusual houses is located in a quiet corner of Riverside where it points its nose in the air at a 30-degree angle : It ' s a World_War_II airplane , converted into a home . Towed to the isolated site and lifted into place almost 50 years ago , the Airplane House rests serenely aloof from the outside world . * In Beverly Hills , the most visible of the Southland ' s unusual residences , the Spadena House , or the &quot; Witch ' s Cottage , &quot; as it is called , is a stop on the star-home tours even though the owner is not in the movies . The house is the star . Described by architect Charles Moore as the &quot; quintessential Hansel and Gretel house , &quot; it was originally built as the office for a movie studio in 1921 , and later moved from Culver City to its present location . With a steeply pitched roof gable over the entry , shutters that hang askew and small leaded-glass windows , the Spadena House appears modest in size from the street . Yet it has two master suites and a 3 # 500-square-foot interior that is charming and spacious . &quot; We can ' t live like the seven dwarfs , &quot; said Doris Green , who has owned the house for 27 years . The cottage ' s fame has grown during Green ' s ownership , forcing her to learn to garden in her front_yard without being distracted by onlookers . &quot; I used to run in the house when people came_by , &quot; she said . &quot; Now I ' m in a lot of pictures with my gardening clothes on. &quot; When the moat in front of the house began leaking , Green filled it with dirt , and planted a cottage garden with cuttings from the neighborhood . Otherwise , she has scrupulously maintained the Witch ' s Cottage in all its original fairy-tale exaggeration . * What kind of homeowner chooses an unusual house ? Often a surprisingly conventional person , according to Dr. Gladys Whipple , a Pasadena psychiatrist . &quot; People can express a streak of unconventionality in their personality by choosing a house outside the norm , &quot; Whipple said . No matter how you evaluate the advantages of owning a house that is different from the neighbors ' , there is one very big downside . When you want to sell , you have to find a buyer willing to take_on the care and tending of a whale , keep_up with the maintenance of a water_tower or live with the unrelenting interest in a fairy-tale cottage . The Bergys want more room , Green wants less , Odell ' s business has moved north and the owner of the Whale House has relocated . So how do you sell a one-of-a-kind house ? Slowly . The Water_Tower House has been for_sale intermittently for five years . Recently , however , said agent Elgin Johnson with Coldwell Banker in Costa Mesa , the house received commercial zoning , and interest has picked_up . The listing price is $ 1.9 million . Diane Brown of Westcoe Real_Estate in Riverside has been searching for the right buyer for Solar Terra for more_than three years . The house is priced at $ 399 # 000 . The Witch ' s Cottage has just been re-listed , with John Bruce Nelson &amp; Associates of Beverly Hills , at $ 2 million . Agent Tobias Hildebrand of Fred Sands ' Montecito office is marketing the Whale House for its investor-owner at $ 995 # 000 . While waiting for a buyer , he rents_out the house for small special events , such_as weddings . ( The Glass Pyramid and the Airplane House are not for sale. )</TEXT>
