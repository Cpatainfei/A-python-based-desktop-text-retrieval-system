   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : FOUNTAIN VALLEY ; OFFICER ' S GOOD DEED EARNS HIM NEW PET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an unusual rescue last week , Police_Officer Gary Kirby scooped an abandoned kitten off a roadway and saved the tiny feline from being killed by an oncoming car . As Kirby patrolled city streets April 27 , he saw a_couple_of dead kittens , killed by cars , in the traffic_lanes on Edinger Avenue between Harbor Boulevard and Euclid Street . &quot; It was kind of obvious that someone dumped them off in the roadway , &quot; Kirby said . As Kirby continued to drive , he saw another dead kitten . Then he stopped at the intersection of Euclid Street and Edinger Avenue and saw a kitten alive in the fast_lane . As Kirby flashed his lights and prepared to stop , the kitten darted into the next lane and was almost hit by another vehicle . Kirby then stopped traffic , got_out of his patrol_car and rescued the scared gray kitten from the street . Motorists clapped , honked and gave the police_officer a thumbs up for his good deed , he said . During the ride back to the station , the shaken kitten climbed_up inside the car ' s dashboard . It took several people to get him out , a feat accomplished only after the radio was removed . Inside the police_station , officers pampered the kitten , giving him a can of tuna to eat and a cardboard box , padded with a T-shirt , to sleep_in . Kirby took the kitten home . He and his wife , Lisa , have named him Caine . &quot; It makes me feel good , &quot; Kirby said of his rescue effort . &quot; I ' ve got a new cat now , and he acts like he owns the house already. &quot; DEBRA CANO</TEXT>
