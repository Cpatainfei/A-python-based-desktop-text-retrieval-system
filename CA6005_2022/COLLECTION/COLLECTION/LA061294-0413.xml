   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 ; WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / GROUP E PREVIEW ; A NORWEGIAN CRUISE ; SCANDINAVIANS QUALIFIED IMPRESSIVELY , HAVE SIGHTS SET_ON EVEN BIGGER PRIZE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Norway is not known as a soccer power , but in 1993 it took the sport to heart as never before when the national team qualified for the World Cup . It was a soccer Cinderella story that captivated the nation . Not only were the Norwegians able to qualify for the first time since 1938 and only the second time in their history , they did so despite being in the same group as such traditional powers as England , the_Netherlands and Poland . &quot; We honestly did not expect to go_through , &quot; 28-year-old defender Gunnar Halle said , &quot; and we certainly never imagined we would finish on top of the qualifying group . &quot; We surprised ourselves a little bit . I thought Holland and England would qualify , but we played well , got a bit of luck and stayed in front. &quot; And that is where the Norwegians finished . They won their qualifying group with seven victories , two ties and only one defeat -- away to Turkey in their final , ultimately meaningless game . Along the way they outscored their opponents , 25-5 , and set all sorts of records . The first came_in Norway ' s first game , a 10-0 victory over San Marino in Oslo . It was the biggest margin of victory in a World Cup qualifying match in Europe since West Germany beat Cyprus , 12-0 , en route to the 1986 World Cup in Mexico . &quot; It is easy to say that they were very bad , &quot; said Norway ' s colorful and outspoken coach , Egil Olsen , &quot; but some of our goals were pearls ! &quot; There were more surprises to follow . A couple of weeks after beating San Marino , Norway played the_Netherlands in Oslo and , to the delight of its fans , scored a 2-1 victory , its first over the Dutch in 30 years . Dutch superstar Marco Van Basten had warned his teammates not to take the Norwegians lightly . &quot; Scandinavian soccer has a strong wind in its sails , &quot; he said . &quot; Even though Norway has not been in any finals for a very long_time , it is an opponent one has to be sharp to beat. &quot; The triumph over the_Netherlands had Olsen praising his team . &quot; With this win we have broken a barrier in Norwegian soccer ' s long history , &quot; he said . &quot; For the first time , we beat one of the world ' s top soccer nations , one that came_to Oslo and took us seriously from the first minute . &quot; Previously , we have beaten Italy and England , but both those victories were because they underestimated the Norwegians. &quot; Indeed , Norway had signaled its growing power during qualifying play for the 1992 European Championship when it scored a 2-1 victory over Italy in Oslo . But the victory over the Dutch meant even more . &quot; Few people thought we could beat Holland , &quot; said the team ' s veteran defender and captain , Rune Bratseth , &quot; but we did . And we deserved to win. &quot; Olsen said it was his team ' s tactical discipline that had thwarted the Dutch . &quot; The Dutch were good , but they met a system they don ' t face elsewhere , &quot; he said , referring to his team ' s formation of four defenders , five midfielders and one forward . With convincing victories in its first two matches , Norway suddenly looked capable of anything , and the country ' s newspapers were not slow in climbing aboard the Viking bandwagon . The daily Dagbladet showed a picture of Norwegian striker Goran Sorloth scoring the winning goal against the_Netherlands and told its readers : &quot; If you are going_to remember anything in 50 years ' time , you ought to hang this on the wall. &quot; There were even better things to come . The team was confident and the players were eager , not nervous , about their match against England at London ' s Wembley Stadium . &quot; We believe we can win , &quot; Bratseth said . &quot; We have so_much to gain for the game in Norway if we do. &quot; Norway did not win , but its 1-1 tie was enough to earn a vital point and signal that Norway had arrived on the international scene . &quot; There is still a long way to go yet , &quot; goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt said , &quot; but it was every players ' dream to come and get a point at Wembley . &quot; It was not a case of England getting_worse , but of Norway getting better. &quot; Halle , one of many Norwegian players who play their club soccer in England , agreed that Norway ' s time had arrived . &quot; I think we have closed the gap on the rest of Europe in the past five years , &quot; he said at the time . &quot; After beating Italy last year , the_Netherlands last month and now drawing here ( at Wembley ) , we don ' t fear any teams. &quot; Bratseth put it more simply : &quot; We were lucky , but good teams should be lucky. &quot; Norway ' s World Cup opponents -- Mexico , Italy and Ireland -- would be well-advised to listen to former England Coach Graham Taylor . &quot; It was not easy to play against a team that puts a block of players in front of you and plays zonal defense , &quot; Taylor said , &quot; especially when they are capable players. &quot; Indeed , Norway ' s players were so capable they went_on to defeat England in Oslo , tie the_Netherlands in Rotterdam and beat Poland twice on the qualifying road to the United States . When Norway assured itself of reaching the World Cup , the entire country went soccer mad , jumping into fountains with ice-cold water in the middle of the night and celebrating as if the World Cup had been won . But Olsen and his players realize they are in_for a difficult battle . Italy , for one , will want revenge for that defeat in 1992 , a loss that helped cost it a place in the European Championship finals . Oddly enough , Italy was Norway ' s opponent in its only World Cup match so far -- a 2-1 loss after extra_time in France in 1938 . Mexico too will be a strong challenger , especially since the Norwegians are unaccustomed to the fluid style and refined skills of Coach Miguel Mejia Baron ' s team . And Ireland will be happy to provide a physical battle that Norway will not shun . &quot; There will be no weak teams in America , &quot; Halle said . &quot; You cannot assume that an African team will be a simple matter , for instance , just as it is not safe for others to assume that a small country like Norway will be easy to beat . &quot; We will not be favorites , but that ' s how we like it . We were not favorites in our qualifying group either. &quot; One thing is certain : The Norwegian fans will be here in large_numbers . &quot; Norway is soccer mad at the moment , &quot; Halle said during qualifying play . &quot; I cannot imagine what it will be like by next summer. &quot;</TEXT>
