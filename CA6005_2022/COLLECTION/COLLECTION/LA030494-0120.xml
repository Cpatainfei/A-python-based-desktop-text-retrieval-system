   <HEADLINE> MIXING MEDIA ; ' WORDS AND SYMBOLS ' SPOTLIGHTS AGE-OLD ART ELEMENTS -- AND THE VARIED LANGUAGE OF THEIR COMBINATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Within the visual language of art , words and symbols have established a secure place . Symbols have been an important element since cave-dwellers left their marks on cave walls . The inclusion of words in art was not so prevalent until the early 20th Century , when collage began to flourish . In the exhibit &quot; Words and Symbols , &quot; at Artspace Gallery in Woodland Hills , curator Scott Canty brings_together the work of nine contemporary artists who use these elements to convey a broad range of ideas and emotions . &quot; I ' ve always been fascinated with artists who use symbols in their work , &quot; Canty said . Some of the symbols &quot; are very personal , others universal. &quot; In his curator ' s statement , he reflects on the progress of words and symbols in art from prehistoric times to present day , and writes : &quot; In this exhibit we see how words become symbols and symbols become words . . . . Individuals have continued to develop a symbolic language in_order to communicate their innermost feelings , thoughts and desires. &quot; Michael McCall employs abstract and representational symbols to journey through the universe from the beginning of time to its end in &quot; Alpha / Omega. &quot; With sand and acrylic , enamel and gold lacquer paints , his luminous grid ( read left to right , top to bottom ) takes us from the cosmos and the world ' s genesis through the advent of plant_life , basic to complex animal life , human life , philosophy and religion . A money bag is followed directly by bombs , atomic_energy and the end of the world . In a decidedly more upbeat work , McCall presents the Japanese and Chinese symbols for &quot; Long Life . . . Good Luck. &quot; The colors are bold , the characters sharp and alive in the four oil-on-canvas paintings that make_up this piece . Paul Bouchard focuses_on dual cultures in cast-paper works such_as &quot; Line in the Sand 6. &quot; Combining cast paper with sand , gauze and acrylic on canvas , this work juxtaposes Hebrew and Arabic in a peaceful coexistence . &quot; His early work dealt with peace and conflict with flags , &quot; Canty said . &quot; Some had gone_through war , were torn_apart , but they were still flying . He ' s still taking the idea of flags as a way of identifying groups. &quot; The X and the Y , symbols for female and male chromosomes , can be found in Tony Ramos ' abstract mixed-media visions of dreams . The snake and the moon may also be there , or a dome with a half circle over it . The latter symbolizes &quot; a myth that relates to the aborigines , &quot; Canty said . &quot; Ramos talks a lot about his roots in his work , and who we are_on this planet. &quot; Doug Cluff ' s steel and carved wood pieces covered with black varnish are manifestations of personal emotions . Canty explained that &quot; Accumulation of Effect &quot; was inspired by Cluff ' s reading of a book about a plague-affected village . We , the living , look in on the dead . The long , punching-bag-like forms represent bodies , the holes in them the wounds of disease , starvation and war . Nicholette Kominos captures the simplicity , fragility and richness of life by setting objects from everyday life -- spoons , plates , cups , flowers -- against textured white backgrounds made from drywall and foam . &quot; The drawings and the way the pieces are made seem to be very innocent , but they have a sophistication that a child couldn ' t do , &quot; Canty said . In charcoal-on-paper drawings such_as &quot; Bust , Vessels &quot; and &quot; Infant Saviors , &quot; Brad Coleman renders familiar symbols of Christianity in dramatic , highly emotional ways . Dennis Hollingsworth uses words or parts of words to play with space . The letter forms of &quot; Untitled ( Flowers in Jail 2 ) &quot; stand_in front of the central image of the flower , giving the impression that there ' s a third_dimension to this painting . Though in one artwork the words may foster understanding of the piece , in another they could be the core of its mystery . The writing in Kathi Martin ' s constructions and collages &quot; carries you through the piece , &quot; Canty said . One &quot; Game Table &quot; contains Little Rascals images , another Tarot cards . &quot; She attracts you with the images and color , and then hits you with a good one ( with the narrative ) . They ' re more about the games in life. &quot; One can try to pick_out individual words in Barbara Romain ' s large mixed-media work , &quot; Herstory and History , &quot; and succeed , but that would only suggest part of the story . The cacophony of words in these life-size images -- &quot; History &quot; done_in blue , &quot; Herstory &quot; in pink , he somewhat bigger than she -- creates a frenzied aura that communicates the larger picture here . Viewing her work , Canty said : &quot; I feel_like I ' m in the midst of the busiest city with lights and neon , and everyone wants your attention . You are being so over-sensitized with all_of this coming at you. &quot; WHERE AND WHEN What : &quot; Words and Symbols. &quot; Location : Artspace Gallery , 21800 Oxnard St. , Woodland Hills . Hours : Noon to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays . Ends April 16 . Also , &quot; Conversations With the Artists &quot; begin at 1:30 p.m. March 12 . Call : ( 818 ) 716-2786 .</TEXT>
