   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; MANUEL CAMACHO ; THE NEGOTIATOR ON CHIAPAS NAVIGATES MEXICO ' S DANGEROUS SHOALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jan . 1 , shots were fired in Chiapas , in southern Mexico . The grandchildren of Emiliano Zapata -- Indians , peasants , the dispossessed -- had taken_up arms , demanding land , liberty and justice . Surprised by this military_action , President Carlos Salinas de Gortari responded in kind . Yet , the Zapatistas held the moral high ground , and public_opinion turned_in their favor . So two shrewd political minds -- Salinas and his old friend , Manuel Camacho Solis -- combined to shift the battle from its military context to the political realm . But political violence broke_out again Wednesday , when Luis Donaldo Colosio , the leading presidential candidate , was assassinated in Tijuana . This left Mexico ' s ruling party , the Institutional Revolutionary Party , with the task of selecting a new candidate . It is not expected to be Camacho , who had already been passed_over for the job . In any case , Salinas had asked Camacho to deal with the situation in Chiapas . He valued his friend ' s astute political instincts and his smooth negotiating skills and , in early January , appointed him peace commissioner . While working toward an agreement , Camacho ' s political star has been rising . For a while , it looked as if he would challenge his party ' s official candidate in the Aug . 21 national elections . But early last week , Camacho , 47 , ended the speculation -- declaring he would not run_for the presidency this year . He pointed_out , during an interview several days before Colosio was shot , that with the conflict in Chiapas unresolved , he still has a job to do . Asked to choose between a candidacy for the presidency and working toward a dignified peace , Camacho said he would always choose the latter . Camacho , a widower , graduated from Princeton ' s Woodrow Wilson School of International Affairs . An acknowledged political scholar , he has written extensively on the need to modernize the PRI . He has a cool , analytical mind and acts in a self-assured manner . Deciding to forgo the presidency now does not mean Camacho ' s political career is over . In fact , by waiting six years , he cannot be seen as capitalizing on the tragedy of Colosio ' s death . For Camacho is sowing the seeds for Mexico ' s political future -- one that includes democratic procedures and viable parties . Question : Has there been an agreement to end the conflict in Chiapas , as some people in the government have said , or is Zapatista leader Subcommander Marcos right when he says that is not the case ? Have you reached an agreement with the Zapatistas ? Answer : Subcommander Marcos is right . We must make a clear distinction between an agreement and a negotiation . In San Cristobal , we exchanged a list of demands and proposed an answer that could establish the foundations for a series of political commitments toward a dignified peace . Until this is approved by their constituency , we cannot move_on to the next issue -- the agreements . In Mexico_City , the solution is_on the right track because there is political agreement . Q : Do you believe this conflict can be solved politically ? A : I not only believe the issue can be solved politically , but I also believe that if it is not done politically , there will be no solution in Chiapas . Q : At the bottom of the Chiapas conflict lies a human-rights problem . Shouldn ' t Mexico address this by creating and enforcing a human-rights policy ? A : In the last few years , through the work of the church and local and international human-rights organizations , human_rights in Mexico has become a cause for the civil society . There is also the work of the National Commission on Human_Rights , which has helped to stop many abuses . It has been precisely the presence of all these forces that contributed to stopping the dynamics of conflict in Chiapas , and they play an important role in the political solution being negotiated . Q : The ancestral inequalities that characterize Mexico can be seen most clearly in places like Chiapas . How much longer will it take until a substantial change occurs and the people ' s demands are met ? A : The list of demands that the EZLN ( Zapatista Army of National Liberation ) made were so tough they did not allow_for compromise . It was an intellectual challenge to create a satisfactory public-policy response to the EZLN -- given their specific mind-set , social reality and tough political demands . We are facing the challenge of creating respect and equality for the indigenous communities . It touches_on agrarian reform , because it seeks to satisfy the most urgent land demands in a place where there is not enough land to give_away . But it is also a matter of justice , because we must establish a procedure that allows the communities to participate in the selection of judges and the district_attorney ' s office . This issue changes reality in the communities , because the main reason for the outburst of violence were the abuses of the authorities against them . Q : What is your impression of Subcommander Marcos ? A : Up until now , he ' s followed_through with everything he said he would do . And when you participate in a political-military organization like the EZLN , and you have that political sensibility and the responsibility to accomplish it , then , I think , you are facing a person with exceptional political attributes . Q : What about Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia ? A : Don Samuel is a man who has worked for the same cause for 32 years , and has never gotten tired . He is a man of proven convictions , exceptional intellect and sensitivity . His message is sometimes radical -- due_to the contrast between the needs of the people and the realities they face in Chiapas . He ' s a traditional , 16th-Century bishop continuing in the defense of the Indians , and an efficient 20th-Century mediator in this conflict . Q : In one speech , you said , &quot; The democratic transition ( in Mexico ) should be guaranteed. &quot; What do you mean ? A : In every process of democratic change , the guarantee factor is a must if it is to succeed . If there are no guarantees , all_the sectors that provided the past political equilibrium oppose change . Given these guarantees , change does not disrupt either the political stability or the economic one . Q : Your critics say there are two Camachos . One who accepted the rules of the game after the announcement of Colosio ' s candidacy , and another that wants to change the rules after Chiapas . Is this criticism valid ? A : I have always thought of politics as institutional . For 20 years , I have written_about ways to reform the institutional life in Mexico . We have seen the great risks run when change does not come accompanied by institutional reform . We should reinforce the institutions so that they can respond better to the new political and social realities of the country . Q : There is a quote from Colosio , saying : &quot; Camacho played according to the rules and all_of us who want to be candidates must play by those rules. &quot; The criticism is that you are not following the rules . A : Times are changing in Mexico ! We must adapt the rules to the times that have already changed ! Q : Give one example of the changes . A : The legal and constitutional reforms of the Federal Electoral Institute , and the new autonomy it has , make an impartial election possible . That is a change of the rules ! Q : Another change of the rules would be to admit international observers to monitor the elections . Do you like this ? A : I believe we Mexicans should take_care of the Mexican political processes . We have a civil society that is strong enough to guarantee it . We must reinforce the necessary institutions and be open_to the world . The legitimacy of the process must come from the acceptance of the Mexican people . Q : But there seems to be a problem of credibility in Mexican elections . A : This problem must be understood at two levels : the political forces and the conscience of the citizens . The political forces must learn to accept the results of the elections to improve our democratic life . The citizens ' conscience presents a profound cultural problem that has incubated for decades . The solution will come_with time -- if it is accompanied by a process of civics formation and political participation that can really transform the citizens ' conscience so they demand absolute cleanliness in the process and be able to recognize it when it happens . Q : You have spoken_of &quot; guaranteeing the possibilities of political competitiveness. &quot; What do you mean ? A : That means there should be no preference for any political force within the IFE , equal access to the media , limits to campaign financing . We should have a political regime that guarantees competitiveness and stability and allows society to have the representation it demands . Q : Do you believe you have to adapt the globalization of the economy to the realities of Mexican poverty ? A : Chiapas has shown us that the changes in the Mexican economy -- which were necessary , given the economic globalization -- have to take_into_account not only the effects they are having_on the people , but also to register those sectors that have not been incorporated into the new dynamic of change and bring them in . Market forces won ' t solve this problem . We need to compensate this truly poor region of the country . Q : But isn ' t that a return to the failed statist policies of the past ? A : Clearly , the subsidy policies of the old bureaucracies have failed . But simply fixing the macro will not bring_about change . If we don ' t help those underdeveloped regions within the framework of NAFTA ( the North_American Free_Trade Agreement ) and the global economy , they will pay the costs of globalism without any of the benefits . But if we deliberately institute a policy of work creation -- small factories for 100 workers spread across 100 communities in Chiapas for which there is already a market through NAFTA -- well , that changes the economic_condition of thousands and thousands of Indians . No investor will ever go_by himself to these communities , and that is precisely the fundamental role the government can play . Q : But what would that role be ? A : To ease the transition process , to fiscally support a part of the process , to build infrastructure , to retrain the workers , to assist with marketing and commercialization and provide counseling . The government has to offer incentives for the investor to venture there instead of into the already-developed cities . It also has to become a bridge , a promoter for investment where the private sector does not dare to go . The government must open possibilities for the Indians to have their own businesses . Without a deliberate policy of job creation and improvement of the levels of productivity in the poorest regions of Mexico , the disparity will keep growing and this will lead to conflict and violence . Without properly functioning national states , there is no way to translate the global benefits into local benefits . Only a democratic government that can respond to the priorities established by society can re-establish equilibrium and prosperity in these societies . Q : Do you believe the confrontation with Colosio will force you to break_away from your party ? A : The PRI is such a big political reality in Mexico that unless you take it into account , there can be no change . That enormous political organization has to have a way_out , and I do not believe that the solution is simply to confront it or alienate it . No , we must establish new rules where the PRI and the opposition parties all have their own space . What we need is to build_up a new order in the party system and stop the breakdown of the one in place now . In this sense I have no conflict with the PRI ; I am looking_for a scenario in which the PRI and all_the other parties can fit. *</TEXT>
