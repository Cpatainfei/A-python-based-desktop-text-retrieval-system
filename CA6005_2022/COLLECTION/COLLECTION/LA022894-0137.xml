The more_than 2 # 000 mourners were subdued , though there were occasional calls of &quot; Amandla awetu ! &quot; -- &quot; Power to the people ! &quot; The 15 victims were preparing to conduct a voter education program in Mahehle , in southern Natal province , for South_Africa ' s first all-race election when they were attacked by killers armed with automatic weapons and knives . In Bisho , near the site of a 1992 massacre of ANC supporters , ANC leader Nelson Mandela used a campaign rally to call_for peace and reconciliation . Police said Thursday that they had arrested an official of the Inkatha Freedom Party in connection with the Mahehle massacre . Two other officials of Zulu-led Inkatha , which opposes the election and is the ANC ' s main black political rival , were detained for questioning . &quot; The only crime committed by these children is that they said the people of Mahehle , the people of Natal and the people of South_Africa should go_to the polls , &quot; said Harry Gwala , a regional leader of the ANC .</TEXT>
