   <HEADLINE> STORM RAKES FLORIDA COAST ; REGION FACES NEW FLOODS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Beryl , the second tropical storm of the hurricane season , raked Florida ' s Gulf Coast with rain and wind_up to 50 m.p.h. Monday as it followed the same path taken by deadly Alberto last month . The storm raised fears of flooding_in Georgia , which is still wringing_out from Alberto . By early afternoon , heavy rain blew sideways along the beach , with steady downpours inland , and palm_trees bent in the wind . People in low-lying coastal areas of Taylor , Dixie and Wakulla counties were urged to evacuate . &quot; We can ' t take too_much more rain , &quot; said Alan Pierce , emergency management director for Franklin County , where last month ' s floodwaters ruined the oyster harvest in Apalachicola Bay . &quot; We ' ve been having bad_weather ever since Alberto . It ' s getting real old. &quot; A tropical storm warning was posted for about 300 miles of Florida ' s Gulf Coast from Ft . Walton Beach to Yankeetown , and Gov . Lawton Chiles declared a state of emergency . Beryl did not pack the same wind punch as Alberto , which came ashore blowing about 70 m.p.h. , nearly hurricane strength . Rain was expected to be the greater problem . Beryl was expected to dump 3 to 5 inches of rain on Louisiana , Alabama , Georgia and northern Florida . Some spots could get as much as 10 inches . Alberto hit the coast around Destin , near Ft . Walton , and unloaded as much as 21 inches of rain in 24 hours after stalling over Georgia , where it killed 31 people , damaged thousands of homes and forced 40 # 000 people to flee . Beryl developed_into a tropical storm around midday Monday after its winds had reached the threshold of 39 m.p.h. By late Monday , Beryl was just east of Panama_City , with maximum winds of 50 to 60 m.p.h. The storm had stalled but was expected to move northeast at 3 m.p.h. until midday today , a course that would take it into southern Georgia . &quot; Who knows what ' s next ? &quot; said Melodie Holton , wife of Mitchell County , Ga. , cattleman Lane Holton . They lost about $ 500 # 000 when their fields and pastures flooded_in July . &quot; A lot of the floodwater is still here , &quot; she said . &quot; It would n ' t take much to bring it up again. &quot;</TEXT>
