   <HEADLINE> OUT-OF-SHAPE AST POSTS A $ 39.9-MILLION LOSS ; COMPUTERS : THE FIRST-QUARTER FIGURES ARE CAUSING ANALYSTS TO WONDER IF THE COMPANY IS FALLING_BEHIND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The difficulties AST Research Inc. has had in matching its strategy with its continual growth were apparent Thursday as the personal-computer maker posted $ 39.9 million in first-quarter losses on revenues of $ 495.4 million . The loss , equal_to $ 1.23 a share , contrasts with a profit of $ 8.2 million , 26 cents per share , on revenues of $ 514.4 million during the similar period last fiscal_year . The results were in_line with predictions AST had made earlier . Company officers blamed the losses on production delays and competitive pricing by rivals Compaq Computer Co . and IBM . Along with an ongoing management restructuring , Chief_Executive Safi Qureshey said Wednesday that the company will decrease the number of PC models it sells by half to help it cut production_costs and streamline its marketing . For example , AST now sells computers with 10 types of hard_disk drives , but by February that will be reduced to three , he said . Qureshey also defended AST ' s decision to buy Tandy Corp. ' s manufacturing operations in Fort_Worth , Tex. , last year , despite criticism that the company hasn ' t integrated the plant into the rest of its operations . &quot; The Tandy decision was a very bold move , and there are always these sorts of ( integration ) issues that you have to go_through after you buy a new plant , &quot; Qureshey said . AST gained engineers , patents and a significant amount of sales from the purchase , he said . &quot; We believed it was the right move , and we still believe so. &quot; But two weeks ago , AST announced plans to terminate about 500 Orange County workers , shut its Fountain Valley manufacturing facility and transfer the work to Taiwan . Also , the Irvine-based company has had three key vice_presidents resign since June . The company ' s poor financial performance has left industry_analysts and former employees worried whether Qureshey has fumbled the company ' s expansion strategy . Instead , they allege , senior managers and the company ' s board are now just reacting to competitors ' price_cuts instead of fighting_back with innovative products of_their_own . &quot; They ' re looking_at a lot of bread_and_butter issues , just getting more products out and coordinating their marketing , &quot; said Mike McGuire , an analyst at Dataquest , a research firm in San Jose . &quot; I ' m still uncertain as_to ' what is AST ? ' &quot; Clearly they need to get their manufacturing and forecasting and production cycles in much better shape than they are now. &quot; Alex Chu , AST ' s managing director for Asia until joining rival Dell Computer Corp . three months ago , said that AST suffers from a lack of managerial coordination among its engineers , production managers and marketers . &quot; The different departments weren ' t moving at the same pace , &quot; he said . &quot; It wasn ' t just a single department , it was throughout the company. &quot; Chu and others said the loss of the three top_executives and other senior managers will only make President Jim Schraith ' s job more difficult . He and Qureshey now face pressure from investors to demonstrate that AST ' s acquisition of Tandy ' s plant in Texas will help company profits by mid-1995 . &quot; The key is that this business has been growing rapidly in the last two to three years , and AST is losing momentum while others have been gaining , &quot; said Stephen Dube , an analyst at Wasserstein Parella Securities Inc. in New York . &quot; If AST doesn ' t click into gear , &quot; he said , &quot; they ' ll lose out at an accelerating rate &quot; as distributors seek more reliable suppliers . AST ' s news wasn ' t all bad -- its international revenues increased 7 % during the quarter , with its strongest gains in Europe . Overall , AST said it shipped 309 # 000 computers during the three-month period , and company officials have been meeting with vendors and suppliers to ensure smoother deliveries during the current quarter , traditionally one of the busiest sales periods . AST ' s strategy since the late 1980s has resembled that of Japanese auto_makers the decade before -- concentrating_on product quality and customer service without sinking much money and effort into the development of expensive technological advances . The decision to buy the Tandy plant and others was meant to be an extension of that strategy . At the time , analysts hailed the Tandy acquisition as a step that would enhance AST ' s ability to grow . For its part , AST was making rosy predictions about its 316 # 000-square-foot plant as recently as August . A month later , the company began to suggest its financial weakness . The trio of vice_presidents who left AST had been hired over the previous 18 months . They were brought_in specifically to help AST integrate its far-flung operations , officials said at the time . The most recent departure was that of James Forquer , vice_president of worldwide operations , who left last week . Forquer had formerly been at Apple Computer . Another Apple vet , Gerald Devlin , former AST vice_president of sales in the Americas , left in June . And Howard Elias , who joined AST in June , 1993 , after 17 years at Tandy Corp. , left for Digital Equipment Corp . three months ago . A group of new managers -- including Kirby Coryell and Robert Parmalee , who are splitting Forquer ' s duties , and Chet Pribonic , heading AST ' s notebook_computer business unit -- must do a better job integrating AST ' s engineering with its other departments , said several former employees who asked their names not be used . &quot; In the earlier days the company was able to innovate using the standard parts that everybody else was getting too , &quot; said a former engineering employee . &quot; Now they ' re not doing that , and they ' re turning_into more of a clone company instead of becoming less of one. &quot; Innovation is becoming more difficult as competitors grow in size and gain more clout with suppliers like Intel Corp. , which dominates the market for microprocessor chips . Bruce Edwards , AST ' s chief financial_officer , told a meeting of stock analysts earlier this month that AST was having trouble with parts it bought from Intel ' s rival Cyrix Corp . Intel may have made_it difficult for AST buy Intel chips as punishment for seeking its rivals ' products , analysts suggest . Despite its high-tech aura , much of the PC industry involves cookie-cutter manufacturing and matching products to customer demand . AST needs to show it can quickly adapt , said Ian Gilson , an analyst with the investment banking firm Van Kasper &amp; Co . in Los Angeles . &quot; It ' s very difficult to change a marketing strategy over a short period_of_time , &quot; Gilson said . &quot; Everybody who tries to do_it gets a lot of complaints from people in their ( sales ) channel . Nobody knows where they stand , how easy it will be for them to get their machines in the future. &quot; The company ' s stock was up 69 cents to close at $ 12.125 on Nasdaq .</TEXT>
