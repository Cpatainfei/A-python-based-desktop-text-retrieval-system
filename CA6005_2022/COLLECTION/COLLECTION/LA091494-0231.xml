   <HEADLINE> U.S. ESCALATES PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR AGAINST HAITI ' S LEADERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last weekend , after weeks of careful planning , a U.S. Air_Force C-130 cargo plane flew low along the coast of Haiti , dropping thousands of white leaflets with a picture of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and a poetic pledge for his return . &quot; The sun of democracy . . . the light of justice , &quot; the leaflet promised in Creole , the language of Haiti ' s poor . &quot; The warmth of reconciliation . . . with the return of President Aristide. &quot; They were &quot; very nice leaflets , &quot; a senior U.S. official said wistfully . Only one problem : &quot; The wind changed , they got blown the wrong way and ended_up in the water. &quot; In a massively orchestrated campaign of psychological_warfare , the Clinton_Administration has drawn_on every weapon in its arsenal to push Haiti ' s military dictators toward quitting -- from leaflets and radio_broadcasts to dispatching dozens of warships and thousands of troops . U.S. patrol_boats have darted near Haiti ' s shores , and small aircraft have buzzed the capital of Port-au-Prince . Public and private messages have been sent to Haiti ' s ruling generals saying that if they stay , they risk being captured and turned_over to their enemy , Aristide . In another effort to turn_up the pressure -- and build public support for an invasion -- the White_House announced that President Clinton will address the nation Thursday evening on Haiti . And on Tuesday , rattling the biggest saber of all , the Navy sent the aircraft_carrier America steaming toward the Caribbean to ferry Special Forces paratroops who would drop into Haiti to seize key facilities as part of an invasion . The idea , officials have said , is to make the Haitian leaders &quot; hear footsteps &quot; -- to convince them that after months of indecision , Clinton is serious about invading . But as with the leaflets , psychological_warfare is turning_out to be a difficult and sometimes frustrating enterprise . U.S. officials have been watching and listening closely for some sign that Haiti ' s ruling generals are getting rattled -- but the signs , they acknowledge , are still maddeningly inconclusive . &quot; We have some indications that they are beginning to focus_on it , &quot; a senior official said . &quot; But they only really began to notice last week. &quot; The campaign is still escalating , officials said , hinting that the Haitians soon will be hit with more communications , including false radio messages and other signs of imminent invasions that will force them to stay_on psychologically debilitating 24-hour alerts . At the same time , the Administration plans to continue its very visible preparations for a real invasion , on the theory that only real deployments can convince the Haitian leaders that they face a real danger . Those measures are expensive . Operating the America alone costs more_than $ 1 million a day . But psychological_warfare is cheaper than the real_thing , officials noted . &quot; We think there ' s a 50-50 chance &quot; that the generals might give_up without a fight , one senior official said . Officials have said that all_the parts of a U.S. invasion force would be in place by next Tuesday or Thursday , a timetable that seems to be holding true as more ships and combat troops are readied for the military operation . Among the measures already taken : * U.S. warships deliberately sailed within a_few miles of Port-au-Prince and other Haitian towns over the weekend and sent helicopters and patrol_boats even closer to the shore -- drawing curious crowds and touching_off new rumors of invasion . * As the America left Norfolk , Va. , with military support personnel assigned to the Army ' s 18th Airborne Corps , Pentagon officials pointedly noted that its mission includes carrying the Special Forces_units that would be used to seize airports and communications centers in Haiti in the moments before an invasion . * The Army ' s 18th Airborne Corps at Ft . Bragg , N.C. , remains on alert and , according to Pentagon sources , would be the first ground troops of a force of about 20 # 000 to land in the island nation in an invasion . * Eighteen hundred Marines assigned to the amphibious_assault ship Wasp began ground exercises in Puerto Rico that included the firing of live rounds . * Thirteen cargo_ships are being readied at Eastern and Southern ports to carry heavy equipment and supplies to the region . * The Dwight D . Eisenhower , another aircraft_carrier , and the Mount_Whitney , an amphibious command ship , are being reconfigured this week in preparation for service in Haiti . * A light-infantry contingent of 2 # 000 from the Army ' s 10th Mountain Division is being sent later this week aboard the Eisenhower to the Haiti shoreline , where the troops will wait &quot; within eyesight &quot; of the beach and conduct mop-up and peacekeeping operations on the island nation should any invasion take_place . Some senior U.S. military_leaders consider the series of public announcements to be confusing , if not wrong , noting that conventional military wisdom holds secrecy as the greatest component of any invasion . &quot; We ' ve done other buildups like this before and you would n ' t even have known it , &quot; one Pentagon official said . &quot; But this one has been very public . It ' s been saber rattling to the max . It ' s brinkmanship. &quot; Others wonder if the stream of announcements is even getting_through . &quot; Haitians don ' t read our papers or see our TV , &quot; a senior Pentagon planner said . &quot; Are we doing this just to scare them ? &quot; another official asked . &quot; And what if , after putting all this hype out on the street , we don ' t invade ? ( Military_leader Lt . Gen . Raoul ) Cedras is going_to laugh_at us. &quot;</TEXT>
