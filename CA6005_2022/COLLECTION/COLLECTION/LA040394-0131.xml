   <HEADLINE> RECOVERY THAT MAY CREATE MORE ECONOMIC REFUGEES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With California in the early stages of economic recovery , the state ' s key concern for the balance of the ' 90s may well be what to do about those left on the sidelines . Two emerging job realities help focus the issue . In one , workers with certain technical skills or with marketing and entrepreneurial savvy in such sectors as medical equipment , entertainment , international trade and telecommunications are much in_demand . In the other reality , workers with less marketable skills , including many who perform clerical , assembly , distribution and service duties , face declining employment prospects and falling pay relative to the college-educated . Southern California , as usual , sharply reflects both these national trends . Greater Los Angeles , for example , is home to one of the highest concentrations of college graduates in the country . According to a recent Price Waterhouse study , Southern California -- notably western Los Angeles County , Orange and San Diego counties -- boasts percentages of college-educated people between 25 % to 50 % above the national average . Similar numbers apply to regions adjacent to San Francisco Bay . Orange County epitomizes the rewards of education in a knowledge-driven economy . With a share of college-educated workers at almost 50 % above the national average , and with the number of households earning $ 75 # 000 or more at greater than twice the national average , Orange County ' s unemployment_rate has dropped to that of the country . Boosted by new entrepreneurial activity , research-and-development space is becoming scarce ; even office vacancy_rates are falling . By contrast , southeast Los Angeles County reflects the other job-future reality . With a population one-third immigrant and with the number of college graduates living there about 33 % below the national average , the region ' s fate in California ' s emerging economy seems far less assured . This is already evident in the state ' s incipient recovery . Job losses in aerospace and construction have been large , but growth in the healthier sectors of the economy -- medical equipment , textiles and international trade -- has yet to expand rapidly enough to pick_up the slack . Office absorption is virtually negligible ; industrial vacancies remain in the high double_digits . Faced with declining economic prospects , older , less educated residents have been moving_out of state since the mid- ' 80s , according to a Michigan study . But many in poorer parts of California -- generally younger , often minority -- cannot so easily cash out and leave . What were essentially healthy working-class communities could turn_into versions of Brazil ' s infamous favelas . The long-term consequences of this kind of economic deterioration may prove catastrophic to the region ' s social stability . History bears this out . Starting in the early 1960s , large-scale manufacturing in automobile and other consumer_durables began to leave South Los Angeles . California ' s growing prosperity , pushed along by the Vietnam_War , bypassed the region . In 1965 , for example , amid a generally robust regional economy , unemployment in the Watts area reached nearly 35 % . At the time of the riots , 35 # 000 jobless adults , and one in five families , were_on welfare . Unfortunately , the official response to the Watts riots , and similar disorders elsewhere , failed to address these fundamental economic problems . Instead of focusing_on economic development , entrepreneurship and self-help , government efforts centered_on social-service programs , which only helped to deepen patterns of dependency . Despite the expenditure of billions of dollars over 10 years , by the late 1970s , median family incomes in South-Central Los Angeles were growing at barely one-third the rate for the region as_a_whole . Today , as the national economy and that of Southern California recovers , the critical challenge will be to ensure that the new growth does not circumvent these poor and working-class areas . This is not only important for South-Central Los Angeles . As the shift to a knowledge-intensive economy grows , the regions that may be economically marginalized include the fringes of suburbia , particularly industrially oriented areas like the East San Fernando Valley , central Orange County and the Inland Empire . The possibility that California ' s zones of economic despair may grow even as the pace of recovery quickens suggests the need for a new urban policy that transcends both the self-defeating welfare policies of the 1960s and the right ' s fixation on building an ever expanded prison system . This effort would require that attention be paid to basically non-economic issues -- education and crime -- that affect business . But central to it would be an economic strategy that encourages growth in those sectors of the economy -- small-scale manufacturing and trade-related activity -- that have_the_best chance of restarting the economic engine in more depressed areas . Among governmental initiatives that could boost regions left on the sidelines during previous cycles of economic_growth is the $ 1.8-billion Alameda Corridor Project . Expansion of the transportation network that links the Los Angeles-Long Beach Harbor with Downtown and , through rail and freeways , to the rest of North_America , would greatly accelerate the movement of goods through the artery , along the way creating opportunities for scores of smaller industrial and service companies . In many ways , southeastern Los Angeles is a natural economic play . The Alameda Corridor runs_through it , and it is home to a largely immigrant population eager to rise_up the economic ladder . Significantly , a developed corridor would serve companies with strong reasons to stay_put , since they rely_on local resources . Moreover , many are owned and operated by minority entrepreneurs who have with ties to the local communities . Government certainly has a role to play in getting this economic engine on_the_move . For one , it can lighten the regulatory burden fast-growing small companies carry . But innovative private investment will be indispensable . The decision by Calpers , the state ' s pension_fund , to lend to small business is a prime example of a new source of capital . Such a course offers the best hope to reconnect the economically disconnected regions of Southern California . In 1965 , and again in 1992 , we experienced the man-made shocks caused by past miscalculations . The emerging recovery offers the opportunity to make amends .</TEXT>
