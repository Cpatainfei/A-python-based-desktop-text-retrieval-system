   <HEADLINE> SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION ; JUDSON STUDIOS WILL BE BUSY HELPING CHURCHES RESTORE QUAKE-SHATTERED STAINED-GLASS_WINDOWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the last 100 years , the Judson family has designed stained-glass_windows for churches , synagogues , banks , shopping_centers and restaurants from coast to coast . The historic stained-glass center has also seen its share of damage caused by earthquakes , including the Long_Beach quake in 1933 and the Sierra Madre quake in 1991 . But the magnitude 6.6 Northridge earthquake Jan . 17 has caused more damage to stained-glass_windows than any disaster before it , said Bill Judson , 28 , who works with his father and a dozen artisans inside a mansion-like studio in Highland Park . Business , he said , could be backed_up for months . &quot; This was a thrust earthquake , which caused the windows to pop_out more_than a slip earthquake , &quot; said Bill ' s father , Walter W . Judson , 52 , whose great-grandfather William Lees Judson founded Judson Studios in 1897 . &quot; Stained-glass people will be busy for awhile. &quot; Judson Studios , whose family logo -- a griffin -- adorns scores of colored glass panes on buildings across the country , is one of the few studios in California capable of large-scale repairs . And for the dozens of damaged buildings across Southern California , the road back could be a long one -- insurance_companies will be processing claims for weeks or even months , and some churches and businesses might not have the money to replace damaged windows . Repairing stained-glass can be complicated and costly . The process -- which includes taking the window apart , researching the original art and finding matching glass -- can cost $ 150 to $ 15 # 000 . St . Peters Armenian Church in Van Nuys was heavily damaged in the recent temblor . In the church dome , six of 12 stained-glass_windows -- each of an apostle -- were shattered , and the other six were damaged . Just removing the damaged sections and covering the holes with plastic will cost the church $ 8 # 500 , said Father Shnork Demirjian . He said he is not sure what it will cost to replace the windows . The church has no insurance and cannot rely_on help from parishioners , many of whom were also hit hard during the quake . Still , repairing the windows is the church ' s first priority , Demirjian said . &quot; Although stained glass is originally a Western ( means of expression ) , the icons are important for us , and the windows create the atmosphere for worship in the church , &quot; he said . At the Church of the Lighted Window in La Canada Flintridge , the window for which the church was named lost a large chunk of glass . Although the church does not yet know how much fixing the broken window will cost , it wants to repair and reinforce it , senior minister Philip Anderson said . &quot; We appreciate the aesthetics of the stained-glass_windows , which are clearly a part of our worship life , &quot; he said . The Judson Studio workers begin the repair process by making_sure that the building is stabilized so the windows can be safely removed . Then they take a rough_drawing or rubbing of the existing lead ( the strips that surround the glass and hold the design together ) , take the windows apart and bring the pieces back to the studio . &quot; It ' s critical for people not to go_through and sweep_up and throw everything away , &quot; said Walter Judson , who is also co-owner of an interior_design business for religious institutions . Workers try to preserve as much of the original glass as possible in reconstruction . Judson said it ' s important for churches to collect good photographs of the windows before they are damaged so workers can accurately re-create the design . It is also important to know when the windows were made and by whom , and to save old sketches or drawings because each window is unique in_style , color and type of glass . &quot; If we want to have a shot at replacing it , we should know how it looked before , and how it was made , &quot; Judson said . &quot; It ' s like being a detective , going_back and finding old evidence. &quot; Faceted glass , which is thick glass held together with epoxy rather than lead , is generally easier to repair than leaded glass , Judson said , because it usually has simpler patterns . But leaded glass is stronger and better absorbs the shock of an earthquake . Repairing faceted glass involves replacing the glass and re-creating the pattern . Judson encourages regular inspection of windows to prevent damage . The sash , or frame of the glass , should be in good_shape . After this earthquake , Judson said , he will recommend steel sashes rather than aluminum sashes because steel , though more expensive , is sturdier . Making and repaired stained-glass art is &quot; spiritually satisfying , &quot; Judson said . &quot; You ' re not decorating a building , you ' re creating a space . The windows help create a sense of spirituality in the church , and more importantly , help create a sense of community. &quot;</TEXT>
