   <HEADLINE> 2 FIRMS ADOPT LABELS WARNING COMPUTER USERS ABOUT DANGER OF INJURY ; TECHNOLOGY : COMPAQ , MICROSOFT ARE THE FIRST TO STATE THAT HARM COULD COME FROM KEYBOARD MISUSE OR TOO MUCH TYPING . SAFETY GUIDES PROVIDE USERS WITH TIPS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Compaq Computer Corp . said Tuesday that it will put warning labels on computer_keyboards this fall , directing people to read a safety guide with tips to avoid hand and wrist injuries . Microsoft Corp . also will place warning labels on a specially designed keyboard it will begin selling in a_few weeks . The companies would become the first to clearly state there is a chance for injury from keyboard misuse or too_much typing . There was no immediate sign that others would join them . But the labeling raises the profile of a health issue confronting the computer_industry . Dozens of manufacturers , including Compaq , are defending lawsuits brought by people who have suffered wrist or arm injuries . In Orange County , computer_industry officials said the issue of keyboard design was not a main concern of customers . &quot; It ' s really not something that ' s at the top of the list as far as things customers ask about , &quot; said David Dukes , co-chairman of Ingram Micro Inc. in Santa Ana , one of the nation ' s largest personal_computer and components distributors . Dukes said he had &quot; never encountered a single incident &quot; of a customer expressing concern over stress related to keyboard use . &quot; We talk to customers and focus groups , and we hear about features . . . like design and layout , &quot; he said . Officials for Ingram Micro and at Toshiba America Information_Systems Inc. ' s computer manufacturing division in Irvine said they have not faced any lawsuits from users alleging stress injuries related to keyboards . The central issue in many suits is whether people were adequately warned about the potential for harm . Injuries can range from simple soreness to a tissue swelling that harms nerves in the wrist , a condition known as carpal_tunnel_syndrome . A partner at a New York law_firm that represents 2 # 000 plaintiffs in keyboard injury cases praised Compaq and Microsoft but said the size and placement of the labels would make a difference . &quot; The fact some of these companies may be waking_up to the interest in warning people is a very positive development , &quot; said Robert Komitor , partner at Levi , Phillips and Konigsberg . &quot; Time will tell whether these warnings are adequate or whether they ' re to avert litigation. &quot; Compaq ' s sticker will be_on top of a keyboard with the message : &quot; Warning ! To Reduce Risk of Serious Injury to Hands , Wrists or Other Joints , Read Safety &amp; Comfort Guide. &quot; The company , the leading seller of personal_computers in the first_half of this year , has included a booklet of safety tips with each computer since 1991 . It will have a new version of that booklet ready when the warning labels go_out in the fourth quarter . &quot; This makes_it visible to the user that there ' s a document there that they ought to see or that they ' re missing and can request , &quot; said John Rose , senior_vice_president of Compaq ' s desktop division . He said the company was not reacting to litigation and declined to discuss what the legal ramifications may be . Compaq earlier this year won a lawsuit brought by Patsy Woodcock , a Houston secretary who claimed that typing injuries left her unable to work . During the trial , Compaq argued that information available in 1988 , when Woodcock began working_on the keyboard , did not warrant such a warning . Compaq said Tuesday that there is still no scientifically established link between keyboard design and injuries . But it cited growing evidence , chiefly in news accounts , that typing with hands in awkward positions or for a long_time can be harmful . So , the company said , it wanted to draw more attention to the safety guide . Woodcock ' s attorney , Mark Collmer , said , &quot; If nothing else , it is an acknowledgment of the problem and it is a step_in the right direction. &quot; Microsoft has built a healthy side business in computer_accessories , such_as an ergonomic mouse control . It will soon sell an angled keyboard with a special wrist rest and slanted keys designed to be more comfortable . Its warning label will also direct customers to a safety guide , said Debra Johnson , a Microsoft spokeswoman . IBM , for years the leading maker of PCs , incorporates software with ergonomic information in its machines . It has no plans for warning labels , spokesman Peter Thonis said . Several other PC makers declined immediate comment on keyboard labeling .</TEXT>
