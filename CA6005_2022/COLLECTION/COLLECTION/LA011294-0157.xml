   <HEADLINE> NEW SOFT DRINK WON ' T BE QUITE THE REAL THING ; MARKETING : BOTH COCA-COLA AND PEPSI ARE DEVELOPING PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE A CROSS BETWEEN REGULAR AND DIET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Coca-Cola Co . may be getting ready to introduce a not-quite-diet cola in North_America as part of a move by soft_drink makers to lure customers who want less sugar but don ' t like diet drinks , industry_analysts say . They say the new drink , rumored to be called Coca-Cola Light , could counter the launch by archrival Pepsico Inc. of a mid-calorie cola , called Pepsi Max , in Canada this month . Coke , the world ' s largest soft_drink bottler , officially declined to comment on what it describes as market speculation , and spokesmen would not confirm whether such a product exists . Pepsi Max , which promises 50 calories a serving instead of 150 , and a taste closer to that of regular Pepsi , is designed to appeal_to the estimated one-third of cola drinkers who switch constantly between diet to regular drinks . Analysts say Coke could introduce its own mid-calorie cola early this year as part of a strategy of offering new products with short life spans but big profit potential while brand-name popularity lasts . &quot; Coca-Cola could consider the introduction of another cola product -- a mid-calorie Coca-Cola , &quot; said Natwest analyst Michael Branca . &quot; The feeling is that there is some potential for a mid-calorie cola product in North_America this year. &quot; Analysts say the Pepsi Max introduction makes_it likely both Pepsi and Coke will have mid-calorie colas in the North_American market by summer . &quot; Canada is not necessarily a testing ground for the U.S. market , &quot; said Pepsico spokeswoman Ann Ward , &quot; but something like a mid-calorie cola is a possibility for the United States. &quot; With North_American soft-drink sales growing only about 4 % a year , Coke is bent_on finding niche markets that may last only as long as the customer ' s mood . &quot; These are brands that work for two or three years and then disappear but could still make a lot of money during that time , &quot; said Brown Bros . Harriman &amp; Co . analyst John Nelson . Coke will vastly expand its product introduction schedule over the next 1 1 / 2 years , M . Douglas Ivester , Coca-Cola executive_vice_president for North_America , told a group of Atlanta business_executives . &quot; In the last 18 months , we have introduced two_dozen products around the world ; in another 18 months , that may seem like a slow pace , &quot; Ivester said . Industry experts say the &quot; quick-hit &quot; strategy makes_sense in a market of rapidly changing_tastes . &quot; If you ' re faced with fickle ( consumers ) , fickle is a great way to be , &quot; said Jesse Meyers , publisher of the Greenwich , Conn.-based Beverage Digest newsletter .</TEXT>
