   <HEADLINE> YOUR MORTGAGE ; REVAMPED LOAN IS BOON FOR FIXER-UPPERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Attention first-time home_buyers and small-scale real_estate investors : The most cost-effective -- but least-known -- federal mortgage program in the country has just been made even more attractive . With a series of user-friendly rule changes , the Clinton_Administration has pushed &quot; 203k &quot; mortgage insurance onto center stage for anyone interested in affordable housing . Picture a program that gives : -- First-time purchasers the ability to acquire a house with zero down_payment . You read that right : Zero . Zip . No equity money down . -- Non-first-time home_buyers the ability to finance a dwelling with a mortgage that ' s bigger than the current appraised value of the property . For example , you might have an &quot; as-is &quot; appraised value of $ 100 # 000 and walk away with a mortgage of $ 120 # 000 . -- Investors the right to stack the full costs of renovating a fixer-upper property on top of the regular acquisition costs of the house -- all for a 15 % down_payment that the investor can recoup with substantial profits in a matter of months . Sound too good to be true ? Not if you get_up to speed with the Federal_Housing_Administration ' s new and improved 203k program . Although on the books for years as the federal_government ' s primary financing vehicle for home renovations , 203k never produced many loans because lenders considered it an administrative nightmare . Barely a handful of mortgage companies nationwide ever bothered to offer it to consumers . That is , until the Clinton_Administration ' s team at the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) decided to rescue it , streamline it and turn it into a high-volume housing producer . With the administrative revisions inaugurated last week , HUD expects a network of hundreds of lenders nationwide to actively promote 203k -- almost certainly including mortgage firms in Southern California . How does 203k work ? The basic premise of the program is that one of the best sources of affordable housing for moderate-income purchasers is fixer-uppers : Homes that need work and are priced or valued below their potential as a result . Put_on a new roof , install a new heating_system , modernize the kitchen and apply a coat_of_paint and the &quot; handyman special &quot; that everybody has passed_by turns_into a hot property . The problem for fixer-upper purchasers -- whether owner-occupants or investors -- has always come_in financing the renovations . Lenders typically have required buyers to come_up with large down_payments and to finance the rehab expenses separately from the &quot; as-is &quot; acquisition cost of the house . Only after all_the repair work was completed might lenders be willing to provide a permanent mortgage on the renovated house . Enter 203k . It allows borrowers to roll the as-is price of the property and the cost of the future renovations into one loan upfront . Even better , it extends highly favorable FHA down_payment terms to the entire package . Although frequently that can mean a down_payment of just 5 % , the 203k program takes the low down_payment concept a step further . For what the government defines as &quot; first-time buyers , &quot; the required down_payment can go_to zero . First-timer for 203k , by the way , doesn ' t necessarily mean you ' ve never owned a house before . Rather you simply cannot have owned a home during the three years immediately preceding your 203k loan_application . And if you ' ve been divorced or separated for less than three years , don ' t worry : You qualify as a first-timer as long as you no longer have an ownership interest in a home . Consider this example of a zero-down deal provided by Ann L . Johnson of Tidewater First Financial Group of Springfield , Va. , an active 203k lender . Say a small-scale investor or renovator locates a rundown townhouse needing $ 20 # 000 worth of repairs . The as-is , unrestored price of the place is $ 70 # 000 . Total acquisition costs are projected at $ 90 # 000 . The investor puts_down 15 % ( $ 13 # 500 ) . If the investor were going_to retain the property for rental , a $ 76 # 500 loan ( $ 90 # 000 less $ 13 # 500 ) would be the maximum mortgage allowed under the program . However , if the investor planned to sell the renovated house to a first-time buyer , the loan ceiling could be considerably higher . Let ' s say an FHA-approved appraiser estimates that after the renovations , the home would have a resale value of $ 125 # 000 . Using what FHA calls the &quot; escrow commitment procedure , &quot; the investor could then qualify for a maximum loan of $ 119 # 250 . After completion of the renovations , the investor would allow a first-time buyer to take_over ( assume ) the $ 119 # 250 loan for no cash down_payment . The investor could either waive the $ 5 # 750 down_payment altogether or take_back a second_mortgage note . The buyer , of course , would have to qualify financially to handle payments on that size mortgage debt . At loan closing , from the $ 125 # 000 sale price , the investor would get the $ 13 # 500 he or she originally put_down , plus a &quot; profit &quot; of $ 29 # 250 ( the difference between the $ 119 # 250 ultimate loan amount and the $ 90 # 000 acquisition and renovation costs ) .
