   <HEADLINE> KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD : OREGON SUITS WILSON AFTER ALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sara Wilson had almost stopped dreaming . Three seasons of repeated disappointments in her college basketball career made Wilson , a senior center from Hart High , almost stop expecting the achievements she always had believed were attainable at Oregon . -- Her freshman season was cut_short by a stress_fracture in a shin . Oregon finished 9-9 in Pacific 10 Conference play and failed to qualify for the postseason . -- She was limited to 13 games in her sophomore season because of a stress_fracture in her right foot and a bout with mononucleosis . The Ducks fell to 6-12 in conference play . -- Her junior season ended with two games left because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee . Oregon slumped to 3-15 in the Pac-10 and Coach Elwin Heiny was fired after 17 seasons . &quot; It was ridiculous , &quot; Wilson said of her misfortune . She had expected success when she arrived in Eugene , a Pac-10 championship , perhaps . At least an NCAA Tournament berth . Finally , the expectations and those faraway dreams are materializing . The Ducks are in third place in the Pac-10 at 12-4 . And the 6-foot-3 Wilson is one big reason for the turnaround . She is averaging 15.2 points and 8.5 rebounds a game in conference play while leading Pac-10 players in shooting percentage at 58.2 % . &quot; I could not have written a better script , &quot; said Wilson , 20 , who is also injury free . &quot; I cannot put it into words . It ' s so satisfying . It ' s been more_than I hoped for. &quot; Oregon ( 18-7 ) has won 11 of its past 13 . A 72-60 loss to Stanford on Saturday ended a seven-game winning_streak that was the school ' s longest since it joined the Pac-10 in 1986-87 . With two conference games left , the Ducks are two games behind conference leader USC ( 14-2 ) and one back of second-place Stanford ( 13-3 ) . After starting the season 7-7 , the Ducks stand a good chance of at least getting an at-large berth in the expanded 48-team NCAA Tournament . &quot; I don ' t want to look_back on this season and say , ' If only . . . , ' &quot; Wilson said . &quot; This is a huge turnaround . I expected good things out of this team . But I know a lot of people had doubts with a new coach coming in. &quot; Wilson said she liked Heiny but she is impressed by how Jody Runge ' s disciplined approach and match-up zone defense has worked . &quot; It hasn ' t been a hard change , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; It ' s been a good one . We had two girls quit the team , but I was looking_on the positive side , and the team has adapted to a new system. &quot; Wilson has been a model of consistency at Oregon , particularly as a shooter . She began the week with 901 points and would be much closer to 1 # 000 if not for injuries . &quot; The majority of my shots are layups , &quot; she said . &quot; I just don ' t think_about ( statistics ) . I just go_out there and do my role. &quot; More important to Wilson , who was part of two Southern Section championships at Hart , is winning . &quot; We realize where we ' re at and where we can go , &quot; she said . &quot; We don ' t take any win for granted or any team lightly , because we know what it ' s like to be at the bottom. &quot; * Checking the fax : North Carolina ' s Marion Jones ( Thousand Oaks ) has been named to the Atlantic Coast Conference all-freshman team . The 5-10 guard is averaging 15.5 points , 3.8 rebounds , 2.6 assists and 3.3 steals . Her total of 87 steals ranks sixth in the school ' s record book for a single season . The Tar Heels , ranked fifth in the nation by Associated Press , headed into this weekend ' s ACC tournament with a 24-2 record . . . . In men ' s basketball , Oklahoma ' s Calvin Curry ( Ventura College ) scored 32 points , including 10 three-point goals , in a 92-84 victory at Colorado on Wednesday . Curry , who was 10 of 16 from three-point range , gave the Sooners the lead for good when he hit his final three-pointer , sparking a 12-2 run that gave Oklahoma an 80-78 edge with 4:11 left . In baseball , California freshman second_baseman Dan Cey ( El Camino Real ) leads the Bears in batting average ( .386 ) , runs ( 11 ) , hits ( 17 ) , triples ( 2 ) , total bases ( 24 ) and slugging percentage ( .667 ) . . . . Arizona State center_fielder Jacob Cruz ( Channel Islands ) is batting . 410 and has 17 runs batted in and four home_runs . He share the team lead in runs with 21 . His 30-game hitting streak , fourth longest in Arizona State history , came_to an end against Stanford last week . Cruz ' s streak started with 14 games left last year .</TEXT>
