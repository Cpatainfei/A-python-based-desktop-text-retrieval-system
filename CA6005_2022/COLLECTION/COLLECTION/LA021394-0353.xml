   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / JERRY CROWE ; AFTER A YEAR ' S ABSENCE , SELES ' SEEDING IS A THORNY ISSUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The unusual saga of Monica Seles took another curious turn last week when her name disappeared from the Women ' s Tennis Assn . computer rankings . A player must compete in at least three tournaments in a 12-month period to maintain a ranking . Seles , who has not played since she was stabbed by a spectator last April 30 during a tournament at Hamburg , Germany , has participated in only two in the past 12 months . The question now is , when Seles returns , should she be given a special dispensation -- namely a high seeding in the first tournament she enters ? She was ranked No . 1 at the time of the attack . &quot; that ' s a tough issue , &quot; fellow player Mary Joe Fernandez said . &quot; She ' s going_to be out of the game for almost a year . It ' s tough to put her ( No. ) 1 or 2 because everybody else has worked very hard and deserves to be where they ' re at . &quot; I ' m not sure what they should do . They should give her some sort of acknowledgment or seeding , but it ' s tough to take_away that spot from the No . 2 or 3 player. &quot; The subject of a special seeding consideration for Seles is_on the agenda for a meeting of the Women ' s Tennis Council Feb . 27-28 at Indian Wells . Meanwhile , Seles has given no indication as_to when she might return to the tour . &quot; We ' re on the Monica watch like everybody else , &quot; said Steve Simon , director of marketing for the Evert Cup Feb . 21-27 at Hyatt Grand Champions in Indian Wells . &quot; We all know that she ' s going_to play_at some time this year , and I think every tournament is hoping that theirs will be the ( first ) one . &quot; We obviously think that our chances are as_good_as anybody else ' s , only because she ' s done_well and I think she enjoyed her stay the one year she played here and won the tournament ( in 1992 ) . &quot; A spokeswoman for International Management Group , which represents Seles , said their client , who had hoped to have recovered in time for last month ' s Australian Open , has not made any decisions about her schedule , &quot; but has not ruled_out any tournaments. &quot; * It doesn ' t rank with the passing of the Helms Bakery , the Herald-Examiner or the Pacific Electric red cars , but the Los Angeles Strings are no longer . The Strings , who brought three championships to the Forum and whose all-time roster includes Jimmy Connors , Chris Evert , Ilie Nastase , Martina Navratilova , Bjorn Borg and Billie Jean King , announced this month that they will not be part of the 1994 World TeamTennis season . &quot; I feel sad only because it ' s something that I ' ve done for so_long , &quot; said Jeanie Buss , who since 1981 had run the team for her father , owner Jerry Buss . &quot; But I don ' t feel that we didn ' t make our best effort . We tried so many different things -- bringing_in Jimmy Connors , bringing_in Borg . &quot; I just think where team tennis has been most successful was in the intimate stadiums , where the people could be right in on the action , but we just didn ' t have a facility ( that would create that type of atmosphere ) . &quot; Of the 12 teams that will compete in the league this summer , only the Phoenix Smash , whose home is the 19 # 100-seat America West Arena , will not play in a facility designed for tennis . The Newport Beach Dukes will again play their home matches at the John Wayne Tennis_Club , which seats about 2 # 500 . Average attendance for 84 World TeamTennis matches last summer was 2 # 287 , with the Strings drawing an average of 2 # 087 for seven home matches . &quot; In some facilities around the league , that would be standing-room only , &quot; Buss said . &quot; As far as our attendance ( is ) compared to the rest of the league , we weren ' t bad . But we were one of only two teams playing in a facility like this . When you ' re talking_about filling 10 % of your capacity , that doesn ' t sound very successful. &quot; She said she inquired about the possibility of renting a smaller facility to house the Strings , &quot; but the goal of my department is to bring events to the Forum. &quot; She said the seven dates left open by the Strings ' demise would be filled by the Los Angeles Blades of Roller Hockey International , who have expanded their schedule , and by booking more concerts . * Unlike some of his more celebrated U.S. contemporaries , including Pete Sampras , Jim Courier , Michael Chang and Andre Agassi , Todd Martin went_to college , playing for two seasons at Northwestern while studying linguistics . If he had turned pro earlier , Martin said , he probably would n ' t be playing_on the ATP tour . &quot; It takes an awfully special person to be able to deal with the suffering and sacrifices you have to make to be_on the tour , &quot; Martin told the New York Times . &quot; One , as an 18-year-old , I wasn ' t a good_enough tennis_player . Two , I certainly wasn ' t emotionally prepared to live_on my own for 40 weeks out of the year in this setting . &quot; I was perfectly comfortable living 40 weeks out of the year on my own at college , with hundreds of friends and teammates. &quot; And now the 6-foot-6 Martin , 23 , seems pretty comfortable on the tour , too . Tennis Magazine named him the most improved male pro of 1993 , and last month he reached the final of the Australian Open before losing to Sampras . * Andre Agassi ' s appearance in Helen Hunt ' s fantasy during a recent episode of the NBC sitcom , &quot; Mad About You , &quot; lasted only slightly longer than his stay in last year ' s U.S. Open , where he lost in the first round . The character played by Hunt , Jamie , sat at a bus_stop as Agassi , playing himself , approached . &quot; Excuse me , would you get a token out of my pocket ? &quot; he asked . Said Hunt , standing_up to retrieve it : &quot; Here you go. &quot; &quot; Thank you , &quot; said Agassi , walking_out_of the picture . An Emmy nomination awaits . Tennis Notes Boris Becker , who returned to the ATP tour this month after taking time_out for his Dec . 17 wedding and the birth of a son , said last week in Milan , Italy , that he will apply for a wild-card entry into the Newsweek Champions Cup Feb . 28-March 6 at Hyatt Grand Champions in Indian Wells , but tournament officials have yet to hear from him . . . . Those attending the Newsweek Champions Cup will be the first to experience the ATP Tour Fan Fest , kind of a tennis theme park where fans can compare their grips to the top players ' and time their serves . Admission is free . Tracy Austin has been granted a wild-card entry into the Evert Cup Feb . 21-27 at Grand Champions . . . . Top-ranked Steffi Graf , who is scheduled to play in the Evert Cup for the first time after pulling_out at the last minute last year because of a pulled stomach muscle , is 60-2 since losing to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the final of the Citizen Cup at Hamburg , Germany , last May 2 -- the tournament in which Monica Seles was stabbed by a deranged fan of Graf ' s -- and has won 10 of the 11 tournaments she has entered , including the_French Open , Wimbledon , the U.S. Open and the Australian Open . Martina Navratilova , playing her last year of singles , is scheduled to make her only Southland appearance in the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles Aug . 8-14 at Manhattan Country_Club in Manhattan Beach . She is an eight-time winner of the event . . . . A record 69 players earned $ 100 # 000 or more on the women ' s tour last year . On the men ' s tour , 171 earned that much . India has yet to name its team for a first-round Davis Cup match against the United States March 25-27 on grass at New Delhi . Captain Tom Gullickson ' s U.S. team : Jim Courier and Todd Martin in singles , Patrick McEnroe and Richey Reneberg in doubles . . . . Players who use wheelchairs will be paired with those who don ' t in a unique doubles competition March 5-6 at Pierpont Racquet Club in Ventura .</TEXT>
