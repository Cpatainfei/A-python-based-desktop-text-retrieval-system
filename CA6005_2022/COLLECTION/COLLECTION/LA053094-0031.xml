   <HEADLINE> BEAR SHOT IN AZUSA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In response to &quot; Bear Killed by Police in Azusa Neighborhood , &quot; May 21 : With all_the poaching that is already decimating the bear population in this country , you would think a little more care would go_into protecting the bear that wandered into a neighborhood . More disturbing , though , is the fact that it seems this bear was killed for the convenience of time . I have read nothing yet that suggests this bear was about to maul someone , only that it had broken_through two barriers . Of course there is the obvious question , why hadn ' t the state_Department of Fish and Game_wardens shot more tranquilizer darts into this creature ? Did they only bring two with them ? Sadly , unlike a burglar or murderer , this bear did not realize it was committing a crime , so it should have been given more latitude . Finally , I don ' t think this sends a good message to the youth ; there is enough senseless violence in this world . When we have a chance to save an innocent living creature , man or beast , we should try . This type of ending shows kids it is easier to shoot than try and resolve the situation to the mutual satisfaction of both parties . JANET HATCHER Hermosa Beach * I find it hard to believe that in this high-tech society , scientists have figured_out how to go_to the moon , how to shoot_down Scud missiles , how to build a bigger and better electronic superhighway -- yet can ' t sedate a bear . What a crime against nature ! When will we learn the high cost of exploiting our environment instead of preserving it ? LENORE NAVARRO DOWLING Los Angeles * It appears that if humans get their way we will soon be living_in a concrete jungle where &quot; wildlife &quot; is something viewed through steel bars . The bear that lost its way in the streets of Azusa didn ' t realize it had entered the domain of humans and would soon become target_practice . The caption &quot; Losing Its Bearings &quot; ( Orange County ) above the photo of the bear taken before it was murdered is a sad parody of a play_on words indicating the lack of respect and compassion humans have for animals . Humans aren ' t the only species in the world , they just think they are . JOELLE T . BAILEY San Clemente * Regarding &quot; Animal Lovers Distraught at Bear ' s Death , &quot; May 22 : Those animal lovers who were upset probably wish that the bear had killed a child or two before the police stopped him . That would have justified the shooting . The fact that no one was injured is a tribute to the officer in_charge of the scene , Sgt . James Collins , and the officers under him . Yes , we have encroached on the bear ' s habitat by building homes_in his back yard . Yes , all our technology was unable to safely anesthetize the bear . Yes , it ' s a shame that a beautiful wild animal with every right to live was destroyed . But the fact remains that everyone on the scene did all they could to avoid killing that bear . When we weigh the right of a bear to live against the duty of the police to protect the people , the people must prevail . Thank_you , Sgt . Collins , for doing your job and safeguarding the citizens who rely_on you to be there . LOUIS C . CASTLE Culver City * Another wild vicious beast was mercifully put_to_death after intruding_into the domain of civilized man . This frightful scenario will continue to take_place as long as adequate measures to ensure human safety are postponed . Last month a jogger was put upon by a mountain_lion who took her life when the woman inadvertently ran too close to the lion ' s lair . And as inhabitable land is developed and possessed by our ever-expanding population , the risk grows . My proposal is this : Move now to contain and control all areas that could be looked_upon as potentially developed by man . Confine small numbers of indigenous species to zoos and eliminate the rest . Semi-automatic weapons would be particularly invaluable to the cause and would prove their worth to the age-old sport of the hunt . Not to mention newly created jobs for inner-city youth in the taxidermy industry that is sure to experience a boom following the inordinate amount of trophies that will need to be mounted . And while we ' re at it , I would like to propose the elimination of all remaining forest in the state as well as in the nation . Forests tend to provide habitat for many dangerous species of violently inclined wildlife . And then , there are the oceans . Let ' s not forget the oceans . SCOTT BARTLETT DANCE Hermosa Beach * The Azusa Police_Department has now provided me with a whole new definition for the term &quot; out of control. &quot; A bear strolling down a cul-de-sac or sleeping_in someone ' s off-limits driveway is now &quot; out of control. &quot; Gee whiz and golly , I ' m glad we citizens have got these tough_guys to protect us . Who needs patience , ingenuity or compassion when we have tough hombres with guns ? MARIAN CARTER West Covina</TEXT>
