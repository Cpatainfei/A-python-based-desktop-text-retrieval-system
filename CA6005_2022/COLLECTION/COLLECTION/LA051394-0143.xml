   <HEADLINE> TIBETANS FEAR SUPPRESSION FROM CHINA IS DEEPENING ; ASIA : BEIJING ALLEGEDLY CRACKS_DOWN IN REGION , DESPITE U.S. CONDITIONS THAT IT SOFTEN STANCE OR LOSE TRADE BENEFITS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Asked whether China has made progress in respecting human_rights , Tibetan refugee Niyma Tsering points at his groin . For two days last summer , he says , he was detained by Chinese state security agents in Lhasa , Tibet ' s capital , after taking_part in a demonstration against rising prices . The agents fastened his hands behind his back by clamping his thumbs together with a &quot; thumb cuff , &quot; then beat and kicked him in the stomach three times a day . The lanky former shop employee touches the nape of his neck , then the trousers around his groin . &quot; They shocked me here and there with electric cattle prods , &quot; Tsering , 25 , says matter-of-factly , drawing_on his cigarette . He fled Lhasa by truck for southern Tibet in November , then walked for 14 days and nights through the snow-clad Himalayas to reach Nepal . &quot; The Tibetan people live_in extreme fear , &quot; Tsering said . &quot; Their lives depend_on the whims of top Chinese officials . If tomorrow they are told to shoot 1 # 000 Tibetans , they will carry_out the order blindly. &quot; By June 3 , President Clinton must decide whether to extend most-favored-nation status for China . In granting China those trade benefits last year , Clinton conditioned renewal on progress by the Beijing government in several areas of human_rights , including preservation of Tibet ' s unique religious and cultural heritage . In this north Indian city that has served since 1960 as the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile , Tibetan officials , including the Dalai Lama himself , say that despite Clinton ' s requirements , the situation for Tibetans on the whole has worsened , not improved . A people ' s very survival is at stake , they say . &quot; Time is running_out , &quot; said the Dalai Lama , the spiritual and political_leader of the Tibetans who fled to India 35 years ago after China crushed an abortive national uprising . The Beijing government ' s intent , he asserted in an interview , &quot; is to suppress ( Tibetans ) completely and in the meantime to increase the Chinese population so that in a_few years ' time , the Tibetans become insignificant in their own land. &quot; &quot; Some of my friends call this the ' Final Solution ' of the Tibet issue , &quot; the Dalai Lama said . In recent days , high-ranking Indian government officials say , China has been moving more troops into Tibet , including detachments that took_part in the bloody suppression of the Tian An Men Square pro-democracy movement five years ago . The cause , the Indians suggest , may be fears of widespread trouble on the May 23 anniversary of the 1951 accord signed by the Tibetans under duress that legalized the &quot; liberation &quot; of their land by the invading Chinese Communist military . &quot; There has been a massive influx of Chinese population , &quot; reports Pema Thinley , head of the human_rights desk in the exile government ' s Department of Information and International Relations . &quot; The immigrants are taking_away economic opportunities , and the local population is getting marginalized . I think the population influx is the most serious human_rights issue. &quot; In a troubling new trend , Tibetan exile officials say , Chinese have been moving for the first time_out of the cities to the countryside , where they are allegedly confiscating land from Tibetan peasants to start vegetable farms . Tibetans say occupation of their harsh , mountainous land has led over the years to the deaths of 1.2 million Tibetans -- a sixth of the population -- as well as the destruction of more_than 6 # 200 monasteries and wide-scale plundering of Tibet ' s cultural and natural treasures . Recent visitors and refugees who have reached Dharamsala tell of continuing brutal repression and torture . In 1993 , 253 Tibetans were reportedly arrested for political offenses , in addition to about 400 already known to monitor groups , Thinley said . Countless other Tibetans are said to be imprisoned or in detention awaiting trial , including at Situ northeast of Lhasa . Most political offenders are reportedly held_in Block No . 5 of Tibet Autonomous Region Prison No . 1 in Lhasa . Jigme Sangpo , an outspoken nationalist , has been in prison since 1964 , Tibetan exiles say . In the past year , there has reportedly been a crackdown on nuns and monks , key figures in Tibet ' s traditionally Buddhist society . In October , 14 nuns already confined in Prison No . 1 received additional prison_terms for composing a patriotic song and smuggling a cassette recording of it out of jail , exile officials say . One nun had nine more years tacked_on to her existing eight-year prison_term . Torture is said to be routine , an accusation repeated Thursday in a report by Amnesty International . One escaped Chinese Communist_Party official from eastern Tibet told Dharamsala exiles that 33 types of torture are still in_use , including no fewer than four types of electric cattle prods . Prisoners have been held_in cells whose metal floors have been flooded and jolts of electricity then passed_through them . Education is one way of simultaneously eradicating Tibetan culture and ensuring Chinese dominance . &quot; In order to get a job , you must know Chinese , &quot; Thinley said . &quot; In schools , after primary level , everything is taught in Chinese . To get a higher education , you have to know Chinese . All modern subjects are taught in Chinese , so the Chinese have taken_away all_the jobs. &quot; Heavy government restrictions on religion , the second field in Tibet singled_out for monitoring by Clinton , remain , despite some improvements since the Chinese instituted a policy of &quot; liberalization &quot; in 1979 . Boards set_up by the Chinese function in the monasteries themselves , running their finances , watching the monks ' doings and ensuring that Communist_Party doctrines on religion are implemented . Dasang , a 19-year-old Buddhist monk who fled Tibet in January , scoffed when asked if the Chinese respect official guarantees of freedom of worship . &quot; The Chinese say there ' s religious freedom inside Tibet . But it ' s not true , &quot; he said . &quot; In the monasteries , there is no one to struggle for freedom . There are no teachers to instruct . There are no elder monks left . . . . They have fixed the number of monks for each monastery . So_much for their religious freedom ! &quot; Tibetan refugees in India describe the situation in their homeland in universally bleak terms . But a recent four-week journey in Tibet by two American journalists , one of whom has made several trips to the area in recent years , presented a more complex picture , in some cases supporting the Chinese government position . Not all Tibetans , for example , appeared to be suffering under Chinese rule . A minority of younger Tibetans , born after the Chinese occupation , appeared to be prospering . Western-dressed Tibetans drive_up to discotheques in imported Land Cruisers . When asked , many contend that they and their families are much better_off financially than they were only a_few years ago . The reporters also saw examples of unemployment and alcoholism among Tibetan youth . Signs of the increasing Han Chinese dominance over the indigenous Tibetan culture were pervasive , especially in Lhasa . But compared with recent years , the reporters saw more open religious activity . True_to Beijing ' s claims , many temples and monasteries are being rebuilt and restored . Pilgrims worship openly . Photographs of the Dalai Lama , once rare contraband , are now sold openly . Tibetan exiles , like U.S. policy-makers , seem torn over what action is most likely to compel China to modify its human_rights policies . But the Dalai Lama , who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his commitment to nonviolence , appears to want to test whether stepping_up global pressure will work . &quot; He is now saying that increased international pressure may help , &quot; said Bhuchung K . Tsering , editor of the Tibetan Bulletin , published by the exile government , and no relation_to the Lhasa refugee . &quot; And he has said that he is willing to wait for one or two years to see if pressure will bring results. &quot; In the Dalai Lama ' s opinion , what is crucial is that whatever Clinton ' s decision , it satisfy forces inside China that are still struggling for democracy . A published suggestion by physicist Fang Lizhi that U.S. trade privileges be maintained for private Chinese businesses but be revoked for state- and military-run enterprises is an approach that has caught his eye . &quot; It is very important to take a decision according to the wishes of the Chinese -- those Chinese who are carrying_out the struggle for . . . freedom , &quot; the Dalai Lama said .</TEXT>
