   <HEADLINE> A PARTNERSHIP OF UNEQUALS CAN BE SATISFACTORY TO ALL ; EUROPE : PROMISES OF NATO MEMBERSHIP WON ' T ADDRESS SECURITY WORRIES IN THE EAST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At next week ' s NATO summit in Brussels , President Clinton will propose -- and the allies will unanimously agree -- that the alliance offer to establish &quot; partnerships for peace &quot; with all_the countries of Europe that are not now NATO members as well as with all_the states of the former Soviet_Union . This &quot; partnership &quot; approach , however , does not meet the security and political challenges we face in Europe ; at best , it can only provide some time and rhetorical cover while we turn_to the difficult work of fashioning an effective post-Cold War security strategy for Europe . The partnership proposal is intended to deal with the following dilemma : How to use NATO to respond to the security concerns of countries such_as Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic without strengthening the hand of the ultra-nationalists in Moscow who search eagerly for &quot; evidence &quot; to support their claims that the West is engaged in a new plot to isolate and encircle Russia . If Russia is excluded from NATO membership while Poland and Hungary are_on the path to becoming NATO allies , how can Moscow avoid the conclusion that a renewed and enlarged NATO retains its traditional objective of confronting Russia ? Conversely , why should Poland and Hungary find comfort in NATO membership if Russia -- their primary security concern -- is_on the same path to becoming one of their &quot; allies &quot; in NATO ? The partnership concept skirts this dilemma by nominally treating all_the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet_Union the same , and by offering to form a NATO &quot; partnership &quot; with any that are interested in doing so . As described by the Administration , this &quot; partnership &quot; can also serve as an &quot; apprenticeship &quot; to becoming a full-fledged NATO ally : As a partner demonstrates that it can perform the same military roles as current NATO members and can meet the same political and economic norms , the door will be increasingly opened_to NATO membership . The problem is , the &quot; dilemma &quot; rests_on a faulty premise : that NATO membership is the prize , the best -- perhaps only -- way to address the security concerns of European states . The &quot; partnership for peace &quot; simply reinforces that premise , complicating the task of redefining and reshaping NATO . The partnership offer is intended as a response to the urgent pleas of Poland and others for strengthened security ties . Yet the prospect of eventual NATO membership loses its value when the possibility is open_to countries such_as Switzerland and Uzbekistan as well . Indeed , &quot; partnership for peace &quot; confirms that U.S. deference to Russian sensibilities has now deferred NATO ' s expansion to the East . While Poland , Hungary and the Czechs may eventually achieve NATO membership , by then the alliance may have become an empty anachronism . The faulty premise gives_rise to some potentially perverse incentives . By treating &quot; partnership &quot; as an apprenticeship to becoming formal NATO allies , the proposal encourages NATO aspirants to devote scarce resources to improving their military_forces at a time when their fragile political_systems need to strengthen their economies . Perversely , the security assurances they need now at a time of great political and economic vulnerability will instead be their future reward -- if and when they achieve political and economic success . There is a better way . Like &quot; partnership for peace , &quot; it begins by recognizing that while NATO expansion may be an answer to some_other question , offers of NATO membership to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe exacerbate rather than resolve the current political and security problems facing the alliance . But in contrast to the partnership concept , which makes eventual NATO membership both the prize and the standard by which countries compare themselves with others , it would establish relationships with Russia , Ukraine and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that are tailored to their respective needs . A new strategy for security in Europe should include the following five elements : * Preservation of an effective NATO . Both its security role and the strong ties between the United States and our European allies need to be maintained in the face of neo-isolationist impulses on both sides of the Atlantic . A NATO that is little more_than a political membership club could strengthen the hand of reactionary forces by suggesting that an irresolute West could not respond to Russian expansionist moves . * Establishment of a formal relationship between NATO and Russia . NATO membership for Russia is a red_herring ; it arises only because we have made_it into a stamp of political approval . The commitment to collective defense , the central feature of NATO , makes no sense for Russia , which has the wherewithal to safeguard its own security and does not need Belgium to come_to its defense . A formal security relationship between NATO and Russia , grounded in a mutual recognition of Russia ' s distinctive geostrategic role and importance , by contrast , does make_sense . Such a relationship could affirm that neither Russia nor NATO poses a threat to the other and formalize military cooperation in areas such_as peacekeeping , nonproliferation , nuclear safety and security , as well as ensure transparency in military matters . * Extension of formal security assurances by NATO to Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic , the three countries where instability would be the greatest threat to allied interests . Building on the promise of security consultations with &quot; active partners &quot; contained in the &quot; partnership for peace , &quot; NATO could formally state what already is the strategic reality : that an armed attack against any of them would be viewed_as an attack on the peace of Europe . Such an assurance would respond to their security concerns without moving NATO ' s military presence closer to Russia , and would avoid the difficult dilemmas associated with NATO membership . * A new approach to Ukraine . There may be no greater proximate threat to the security of Europe than instability in Ukraine . NATO needs to offer Ukraine a security relationship that recognizes its unique character ; for example , a formal agreement codifying a program of military cooperation . This should not be contingent_on Ukraine ' s relinquishing the nuclear_weapons in its territory . If we tend to our broader security_interests , we make favorable resolution of the nuclear issue more , not less , likely . * Support for the independence of all_the states of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet_Union . This can be furthered by cooperation between NATO and these states within the framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council , in which they already participate . An approach based on these five elements would directly and immediately address the security problems and concerns of post-Cold War Europe while avoiding irrelevant issues . This is the &quot; partnership for peace &quot; that President Clinton should bring next week to Brussels -- and Prague , Moscow and Minsk .</TEXT>
