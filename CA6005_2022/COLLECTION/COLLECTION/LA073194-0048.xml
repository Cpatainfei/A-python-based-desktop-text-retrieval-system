   <TEXT> I read with interest William Gass ' review of &quot; The Wages of Guilt &quot; by Ian Buruma ( June 26 ) . However , I am surprised by the implicit disregard for Slavs . At least three times as_many Slavs as Jews died as the result of Hitler ' s aggression . Yet there is no mention of Nazi atrocities in Russia and other Slavic countries east of Poland . One should at least expect a discussion , for the historically sensitive , of why Germans do not feel as much guilt about what they did to the Slavs : because Stalin was as evil as Hitler , or because the Red Army has been an obnoxious occupier ? This disregard is typical of the American press , which ignored the two most important anniversaries of World_War_II -- if you count as &quot; important &quot; defeating the Nazis . These were June 22 , 1941 , when Hitler invaded the USSR ; and Nov . 23 , 1942 , when the ring around Stalingrad was closed at Kalach , never to be broken . But the press also ignored the turning point of the war in the Pacific : June 3 , 1942 : Midway . I am an American who turned 18 in 1944 . So far as I ' m concerned , the guys to whom I most owe the fact that 50 years later I ' m still walking , I ' m still talking , are the Red Army soldiers who resisted the Nazi invasion in 1941-42 . The British historian Alan Clark put it best , in the preface to his &quot; Barbarossa &quot; ( 1965 ) : &quot; This book has its heroes . . . . Foremost must come the ordinary Russian soldier ; abominably led , inadequately trained , poorly equipped , he changed the course of history by his courage and tenacity in the first year of fighting. &quot; Without this resistance , it is quite unsure whether the Normandy Invasion could have taken_place , let alone succeeded ; it is important mainly , in retrospect , for stopping the USSR from dominating all_of Europe . Perhaps the press is right to assume that significant history is only those parts remembered by its constituency ( the survivors of Midway must number less than 1 % of those of Normandy ) . But such obliteration seems not excusable in a book purportedly about people ' s attitudes toward the past . Here ' s to you , forgotten Ivan . WILLIAM M . KAULA , LOS ANGELES</TEXT>
