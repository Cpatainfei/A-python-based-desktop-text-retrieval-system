   <HEADLINE> POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES : THE THREE NATIONAL PASTIMES ; MANY AMERICANS WITH SPORTS INTERESTS ARE LIKE THIS : THEY WATCH FOOTBALL , READ BASEBALL , RELAX AT THE BEACH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the long , lazy days of summer , Californians head for the beach . that ' s a big_league activity for most people , comparable_with , though in a different world from , major_league baseball and football . And on the warmest days , lifeguards estimate , those swimming or lounging_about number a_million or more on the 31-mile circuit of beaches around Los Angeles . The water is also a magnet in other states that border the Atlantic and Pacific_oceans and the Gulf_of_Mexico . Many U.S. residents live near an ocean . Most of the rest live near lakes , large or small , or rivers . And travel sources calculate that a lot of these individuals -- a good one out of three Americans , more_than 80 million -- already have spent at least one day at the beach this summer . It ' s fun there , and it ' s fashionable . It ' s a national pastime . In U.S. legends , to be sure , baseball was for years the nation ' s pastime -- but the legends are_well out of date . Most late-century sports fans , tending toward multiple interests , are partial to one or more of three particular kinds of recreation . That is , modern America has not one but three national pastimes . There is one for viewers , one for readers and one for doers : * Pro football is the game that Americans prefer to watch . * Baseball is what they like to read about , talk_about , argue about -- even when the players are_on strike . * Going_to the beach is what they want to do . ON THE SHORE To begin with , in a summer like this , the place to visit is the beach . It was there , scientists say , that life originated . The first beings rose from the shore , they say , and , as the centuries rolled by , the quick and the lively got_about the business of making a living . But in their deepest inner consciousness , those surviving never forgot the oceans , the lakes , the rivers . On their days_off , and especially on vacation days , in large_numbers , they have customarily gone_back to the water . And they ' re still going_back . In California and Hawaii alone last year , &quot; The Western ( lifesaving ) Assn . reported 163 # 294 , 662 beach visitors , &quot; Los Angeles ' chief lifeguard Bob Buchanan said the other day . The 1993 national association count of U.S. beach-goers , Buchanan said , reached 267 # 624 , 205 -- in a country with a population of 250 million . Doing the waterfront has become , clearly , a national pastime -- even though few sports fans would pay to watch it , or read about it , and even though , as an everyday hobby , it doesn ' t beat television . Nothing does . Jim Spring , the president of Leisure Trends , Inc. , whose company researches American preferences , has found that TV viewing is still well ahead of any other form of entertainment . Reading is second . Then , examining his most recent polls , Spring said , &quot; After at-home activities that are easy to do , the No . 1 attraction for most Americans is going_to the water -- or being_on it. &quot; The Gallup organization directs Leisure Trends polls . &quot; We don ' t ask , ' Do you like golf or swimming ? ' &quot; Spring said from his office in Boulder , Colo . &quot; We ask open-ended questions such_as , ' What do you really like to do ? ' &quot; And he considers it significant that from coast to coast , most respondents continue to volunteer a preference for the beach . There ' s a good reason for that , according to Stephen P . Leatherman , who heads the Coastal Research Laboratory at the University of Maryland . &quot; The beach offers a choice of two kinds of recreation , passive or active , &quot; he said . &quot; You can lie_in the sun or play in the water . &quot; There aren ' t so many options in the mountains. &quot; Leatherman , professor of geography and marine sciences at Maryland , enjoys what has been called one of America ' s best jobs . He is required to spend much of the year visiting the world ' s beaches , where he studies the interaction between people and the shore . He has concluded the best beach for vacationers is Grayton Beach on the Florida Panhandle , the best for Westerners is Santa Barbara ' s , the best for campers are those in Oregon , and the best for nudists is Black ' s Beach in LaJolla . &quot; The biggest change ( in beach-going ) in recent years is that there are so many_more things to do_in the water today , &quot; he said . &quot; It used to be just swimming and surfing . Today there ' s everything from jet skiing , wind surfing and skim boarding to boogie boarding and ocean kayaking. &quot; Leatherman , known as Dr. Beach to his Maryland students , or sometimes as the beach bum professor , prefers oceans to lakes or rivers . &quot; It ' s the air , &quot; he said . &quot; The salt spray in the ocean air is like an elixir . It isn ' t good for auto bodies , but it ' s good for human_bodies . For one thing , it ' s an allergy-fighter , knocking_down things like pollen. &quot; The sound of the waves is another beach plus . &quot; It ' s dynamic , ever-changing , mysterious , with an up-and-down crescendo that fascinates the average person , &quot; he said . At the beach , though , sunlight is no longer the principal plus , Leatherman cautions . Modern research has identified the sun , in an uncontrolled environment , as an enemy -- as a wrinkle-builder that can kill . &quot; When I go_to the beach , I wear a hat , sunglasses , and a high-level ( usually No . 15 ) sunscreen , &quot; Leatherman said . &quot; I go_in the early morning , and I ' m back by 10:30 or so for a cold shower and lunch , then I read a book till about 4 . &quot; When I go_back out ( to the beach ) I ' m meeting everyone else coming_back in. &quot; All summer , in truth , millions still spend all day in the sun . &quot; But they ' re taking more care now , &quot; lifeguard Buchanan said . &quot; They ' re bringing more umbrellas and more hats. &quot; In any case , he said , the hot sun hasn ' t affected beach attendance . There seems to be no place else that Americans would rather be . ON THE FIELD When choosing a spectator sport , Americans have shown a clear preference for one or more of four distinctive athletic values : action , artistry , strategy and harnessed violence . Not more_than one or two of these qualities are typically present in most sports . And hardly anything can offer all four . Beach-going can ' t . Wall_Street can ' t . Basketball can ' t . Jurisprudence can ' t . Baseball can ' t . Journalism can ' t . Soccer can ' t . Football can . Which accounts , in large part , for football ' s hold_on the country . Which didn ' t just happen . Football was invented by Americans , for Americans . It was created in the second_half of the 19th Century by groups of U.S. soccer players who wanted something more stimulating . They got_it by deliberately , and radically , changing soccer ' s rules . It is of equal importance that major rule changes are still being made -- almost every year -- by NFL club owners , whose goal is to maintain the balance of artistry , action , strategy and violence . And their ongoing attention works . The latest evidence that football has taken_root as the national pastime for spectators is in the most recent Harris poll . Those responding , asked to name their favorite sport , replied : football 31 % , basketball 19 % , baseball 17 % -- with nothing else over 5 % . Some critics have suggested in late years that the nation ' s young people , who have a choice these days of so_much to do , are beginning to draw_away from NFL games in favor of others . Not so . U.S. youngsters in grades 6 through 12 , polled in the most recent ESPN-Chilton survey on their favorite professional sport , replied : football 40 % , basketball 28 % , baseball 18 % -- with nothing else over 4 % . Other critics frequently suggest that football is a man ' s game and that women hate it . But that doesn ' t seem to be so either . The most recent Simmons survey showed that women account_for 41 % of those watching NFL games on TV . In a separate poll , ESPN-Chilton found that 39.4 % of the NFL ' s female fans were more interested in pro football games last year than the year before . No other sport showed such an upswing in fan support by either men or women . Over the years , as an American spectacle , boxing alone has challenged pro football . &quot; The biggest sports events of this century have been certain heavyweight championship fights ( Dempsey-Tunney , Louis-Schmeling , Ali-Frazier ) and Super Bowl games , &quot; veteran journalist George Kiseda said . Yet there have been only eight or nine such fights , he noted , along with 28 Super Bowls . A Louis-Ali fight , if you could somehow arrange it , would doubtless beat anything . In the meantime , there ' s football . OFF THE FIELD The great irony of major_league baseball is that although there is so little to see , there is so_much to say . Even many baseball fans concede there is almost no action in a baseball_game compared with that in basketball , or even football . But on the morning after , how it all changes . Baseball then becomes , once more , the national pastime -- for readers . Nothing in any other sport compares with baseball ' s box scores , or with , say , the written record of the lifetime batting_averages of the thousands of big leaguers active and gone . Take Babe_Ruth . People who would n ' t be caught dead at Yankee Stadium remember that Ruth batted in the . 340s lifetime . They remember it because they know it ' s phenomenal for anyone to hit_home runs as regularly as Ruth did and at_the_same_time bat . 340 -- actually . 342 . They ' ve been reading about baseball , and dabbling_in baseball ' s statistics , most of their lives . The most familiar number in the American_language , in or out of sports , is doubtless . 300 . &quot; Much of baseball ' s appeal is in the romance of the numbers , &quot; Kiseda said , mentioning 20 victories , 100 RBIs , . 300 batting_averages , 3 # 000 hits . Basketball and football numbers , he said , just don ' t measure_up . Even in boxing , there ' s no real way to compare Louis and Ali . In baseball , by contrast , you can indefinitely argue player merits statistically . It is simple to verify that Henry Aaron ' s home-run hitting shattered one of the most famous numbers in sports , Ruth ' s 714 . But Aaron never hit 50 home_runs in any year . Ruth hit more_than 50 four times -- and once hit 60 . Roger Maris once hit 61 . But in no other year did Maris even hit 40 . Gene Policinski , who doubles as editor in_charge of USA Today sports and Baseball Weekly , said , &quot; Every active baseball_player takes_the_field against two opponents -- the guy he ' s playing against and everyone else whoever played. &quot; In a sense , that happens in track_and_field too . But there ' s a difference in baseball , which is a team sport that uniquely grades individual performance in as_many ways as it measures team achievement . &quot; More_than any other sport , baseball is about history , about comparisons , &quot; said baseball fan Bob Costas . Hence any change in baseball harms it . And more_than that , changes in baseball tend to be useless . Given the nature of the game , no new baseball rule can make more_than a minimal difference . The American League ' s experiment with designated hitters is a transcendent mistake precisely because , in a nine-man sport , the DH position can make very little difference . At too great a cost -- the collapse of so_much history . Baseball ' s records date far back into the darkness of the 19th Century , when the game stood alone as the national pastime -- the descriptive phrase first used in 1857 , when , according to Cooperstown , N.Y. , historians , it was suggested by one Fred Ivor-Campbell , a writer in Warren , R.I. Ivor-Campbell ' s little game isn ' t exactly the national pastime these days -- until the morning paper hits the sidewalk out front . Then it is . Even in the year of a baseball strike , it is . The strike has been Page 1 news frequently this summer -- on the news page as well as in sports . Indeed , considering that baseball is now wholly without action , media coverage has at times been overwhelming . It ' s almost as if America ' s three national pastimes had all shut_down . History and tradition did that -- not designated hitters .</TEXT>
