   <HEADLINE> DRILLING ADVANCE REKINDLES SANTA BARBARA OIL WARS ; ENERGY : MOBIL WANTS TO REMOVE OFFSHORE RIG , USE NEW METHOD TO BORE BENEATH OCEAN FROM COAST . FOES CRY FOUL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ever since the world ' s first offshore oil_well was dug at the end of a Summerland pier a century ago , residents here have been battling big oil . All around are reminders of their defeats : Unsightly oil platforms dot the ocean . In some places , the faint odor of petroleum wafts through the air . Tar seeps from the sea floor and lingers on beaches . And many people still recall the 1969 Union Oil spill that spewed 4.2 million gallons of crude into the ocean , killing birds and contaminating beaches . Now , casting itself as a protector of the marine environment , Mobil Oil Corp . is proposing to use new land-based technology to recover oil from a coveted offshore deposit that is closed to ocean drilling . Using new &quot; extended reach &quot; techniques , Mobil wants to bore wells on the UC Santa Barbara campus and burrow under the ocean to reach the oil field two miles from shore . If successful , Mobil ' s plan could set a precedent and open the California coastline to new onshore oil operations , with companies drilling horizontally under the sea floor as far as three miles to extract offshore petroleum . &quot; This would basically open_up a new generation of oil and gas development off our coast , &quot; protested Linda Krop , a lawyer with the Environmental Defense Center in Santa Barbara . &quot; We don ' t want to see drilling from onshore. &quot; Opponents argue that land-based drilling for oil off Santa Barbara County would mean development of a major industrial facility , with a 17-story drilling tower and accompanying potential toxic hazards near a residential neighborhood . Mobil officials , however , say the new directional drilling method would allow the recovery of valuable oil without the possibility of offshore spills . Calling its proposal &quot; Clearview , &quot; Mobil has offered to remove an aging oil platform -- long an eyesore off UCSB and its student enclave , Isla Vista -- in exchange for permission to drill . The company also promises to build a new pipeline to transport its oil to a Torrance refinery and halt the riskier practice of barging the product . &quot; If you look_at the amount of reserves we can produce , it ' s good for Mobil , it ' s good for the county , and it ' s good for the whole state , &quot; said Shauna Clarke , the Mobil official heading the effort . &quot; The state and the county will have the revenue , and it will eliminate the possibility of an offshore spill. &quot; But Mobil ' s proposal , to be unveiled formally early next year , sets the stage for renewed battle over offshore oil just as opponents in Santa Barbara believed they had something to celebrate . Earlier this year , Gov . Pete Wilson and the Legislature designated all state waters -- which extend three miles from shore -- as a sanctuary where no new offshore drilling will be allowed . In addition , some offshore platforms are nearing the end of their useful lives and will soon be removed , beginning next year with four rigs off southern Santa Barbara County that will not be replaced . But the sanctuary law does not ban drilling under the ocean from land . And Mobil may benefit from a conservative shift in key government_agencies produced by the 1994 elections . In Santa Barbara County , for example , pro-business candidates won a majority on the Board of Supervisors this year . And with Republicans taking_charge of the state Assembly , the GOP is expected to control a majority of the Coastal Commission for the first time . &quot; We think there is going_to be more of a shift toward pro-business after the beginning of the year , &quot; Clarke said . Human use of the region ' s oil deposits dates_back thousands of years to Native_Americans sealing their boats with tar . The first commercial development began in 1890 with an asphalt mine where the university now stands . The first protests over &quot; desecration &quot; of the coastline came_in 1896 , with construction of the first offshore wells at Summerland . Two decades later , drilling from piers at Ellwood 20 miles west sparked renewed outrage . &quot; There was protest right from the beginning ( of offshore drilling ) , &quot; said Bob Sollen , a retired Santa Barbara reporter who is writing a book on the history of offshore oil . &quot; It was a mess because there were no regulations. &quot; The outcry over the offshore operations at Summerland and Ellwood ultimately led to the state ' s first offshore sanctuary in 1955 , protecting a limited area off the coast of Santa Barbara between the two oil fields . Although only vestiges of the piers still stand , contamination at Summerland and Ellwood remains , Sollen said . As technology improved in the 1960s , oil_companies began building offshore platforms out beyond the protected area . When Union Oil ' s offshore well blew_out in 1969 , it created one of the nation ' s worst environmental disasters and helped ignite the modern-day environmental movement . Mobil , which proposes basing its operation on sites left from the heyday of the Ellwood Field , acknowledges that the region is one of the most hostile to oil development in the world . &quot; At first we thought it was crazy to go_into Santa Barbara , &quot; said Ken Miner , a Mobil operations manager . But the possibility of extracting the oil without drilling offshore was intriguing enough to persuade Mobil to try . The plan was the brainchild of Charles Warren , a longtime Democratic assemblyman from Los Angeles who helped draft the state ' s Coastal Protection Act in the 1970s . As executive_director of the State Lands Commission , which oversees offshore oil drilling , Warren envisioned a trade-off that would recover oil , produce government_revenue and remove Platform Holly , the rig perched since 1966 off UCSB and Isla Vista . After reading how the new high-tech wells could recover oil at great distances , Warren said he realized the technique could be used to reach offshore oil anywhere within the state ' s three-mile_limit , and he brought the idea to Mobil . &quot; This means we don ' t have to build platforms offshore , &quot; Warren said . &quot; And any risk of oil spills offshore could be eliminated if we could find acceptable sites onshore. &quot; While familiar_with Santa Barbara ' s resistance to oil drilling , Warren said it was the logical place to try the technique because of the known reserves sitting just off UCSB in the South Ellwood Field . In the North_Sea , such wells have been used to extract oil from more_than four miles away . &quot; I thought at the time that this would be acclaimed , not only as an economic masterstroke but also as an environmental masterstroke , &quot; lamented Warren , who retired earlier this year . &quot; I ' m still bewildered by the vehemence and the nature of the opposition. &quot; The about 105 million barrels of oil sought by Mobil lie_in two deposits , one 3 # 000 feet and the other 10 # 000 feet below the ocean_floor -- next to the Holly field but out_of_reach of conventional drilling technology . It is just east of Holly that oil and gas seep from vents in the sea floor , casting a smelly , oily sheen on the ocean and coagulating into tar that sticks_to swimmers and washes_up on county beaches . Mobil , which estimates that up_to 4 # 000 gallons of gas and oil seep into the ocean there daily , captures some of the escaping petroleum with giant underwater tents . Company geologists say the seepage is natural , but critics contend that it is exacerbated by oil_production . Arco , which once owned_rights to the field , sought to build three platforms and tap the oil but was turned_down in 1987 by the county and the State Lands Commission . When Warren took his idea of onshore drilling to Mobil , the company liked it so_much it bought_out Arco ' s interests and began developing the scheme . Although Mobil has not finalized its plan , it proposes to drill from shore at the old Ellwood Marine Terminal , where it now stores and ships the oil produced by Holly . The company would build a 175-foot-tall drilling tower -- making_it one of the tallest structures between Los Angeles and San Jose . The landmark would probably remain standing throughout the 25-year life of the project , Clarke said . Oil produced by the wells would be sent by pipeline to Torrance , although Mobil must build a 26-mile pipeline to Carpinteria to connect with an existing line . Natural_gas -- containing a high level of deadly hydrogen_sulfide -- would be piped two miles west to the Ellwood Onshore Facility , an existing Mobil plant that would be upgraded to process the increased volume . Mobil officials tout a variety of environmental benefits . In addition to removing Platform Holly and transporting oil by pipeline , they say pumping out the oil would reduce the natural seepage . But environmentalists and homeowners -- including many UCSB faculty_members -- say Mobil has picked a poor site to drill because it is near schools , a residential neighborhood , a popular beach and Devereux Slough , part of a noted nature preserve . Labeling the project &quot; Drillview &quot; because of the tower , these opponents say that it will produce visual blight and that its 24-hour-a-day operation will mean increased traffic , noise and light . Even more serious , they say , is the presence of hydrogen_sulfide in the natural_gas pumped up by the wells . Although Mobil insists it can handle the gas safely , critics fear a leak could pose a serious threat to nearby homes and the preserve . &quot; What Clearview would do is shift the hazards onto land and extend them for a longer period , &quot; said Bruce Bimber , a political_science professor at UCSB who is leading homeowner opposition to the project . Environmentalists , who argue for an end to use of fossil_fuels , say there is only enough oil in the field to supply the nation for seven days -- not enough to warrant building facilities that would last more_than a generation . Foes also contend that Mobil ' s offer to remove Platform Holly is hollow because it is running_out of oil and will soon come_down anyway -- a contention disputed by the oil_company . As long as prices remain high , Mobil says , there is enough oil to keep Holly in production until its lease expires in 2016 . Mobil officials also say they can run a safe operation and mitigate most environmental effects , such_as noise , lighting and traffic . In many places , including the Los Angeles area , oil operations coexist peacefully with residential and commercial neighbors , they note . The opponents ' best chance to block the project appears to lie_with the university , which recently became Mobil ' s landlord . Seeking to build new faculty and student housing , UCSB recently acquired a 174-acre parcel that includes the proposed drilling site . Under its lease , Mobil can continue using the property to store and ship oil until 2016 , but cannot drill without UCSB ' s approval . University officials say they have not reached a decision , but acknowledge that Mobil ' s proposal may_not mesh with their plan to build homes that would draw star professors from throughout the country . Indeed , some current faculty_members threaten to bolt UCSB if the drilling project is approved . &quot; On the face of it , it would appear incompatible , &quot; said Bob Kuntz , assistant UCSB chancellor for budget and planning . &quot; However , Mobil believes they can make_it compatible. &quot; At the popular Devereux beach just below the proposed drilling site , UCSB students and surfers were hostile to Mobil ' s plan -- even if it would mean removing Platform Holly from view . &quot; It ' s all about money , &quot; said psychology student Jack Seidler . &quot; They ( Mobil ) don ' t care about the environment . They ' re looking_out for themselves and sugarcoating it with an environmental plea. &quot; Drilling Plan Mobil Oil Corp . proposes to use new directional drilling technology to bore under the ocean from shore and recover offshore oil reserves now off limits to drilling . Calling its proposal &quot; Clearview , &quot; the company would remove the aging offshore Platform Holly and end the barging of oil . But environmentalists oppose the plan because it would mean construction of an industrial facility including a 17-story drill tower onshore near UC Santa Barbara , the Isla Vista community , faculty homes and a nature preserve including Devereux Slough . Ellwood Onshore Facility : Now used to process oil and gas produced by Platform Holly . It would be upgraded to handle increased production . Ellwood Marine Terminal : Now used to store oil and load it on barges to Los Angeles . It is the proposed drilling site , where gas and oil would be seperated . HOW IT WOULD WORK 1 ) Mobil would use new &quot; extended reach &quot; drilling techniques , angling a well almost 90 degrees and boring horizontally under the ocean . From the Ellwood Marine Terminal onshore , Mobil would drill 500 to 1 # 000 feet straight down , then gradually turn every 100 feet until the turn is complete . 2 ) The petroleum would be pumped to the marine terminal , where the oil and gas would be separated . Oil would be pumped through a proposed pipeline to Carpinteria . 3 ) The gas , which contains deadly hydrogen_sulfide , would travel_by underwater pipeline to Mobil ' s existing onshore processing plant , next to the Sandpiper Golf_Course .</TEXT>
