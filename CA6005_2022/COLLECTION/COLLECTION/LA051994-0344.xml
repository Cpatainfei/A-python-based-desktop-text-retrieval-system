   <HEADLINE> WESTSIDE WATCH : NORMANDY IT ISN ' T , BUT ANY PORT IS OK ON D-DAY B-DAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Surfers , take_heed . The Lane Victory is ready to make the Santa Monica Bay safe for democracy . You may have heard about the Lane Victory , the San Pedro-based cargo_ship staffed by retired merchant_marines . The ship set sail April 29 for D-day celebrations in France -- a 9 # 000-mile odyssey -- but was forced to return to Los Angeles Harbor just days later after developing a leak in its boilers . But the tale does not end on that sad note . The French consulate in Los Angeles has invited the ship and crew to take_part in a commemorative D-day re-enactment June 1 in Santa Monica . &quot; Naturally , we ' re elated , &quot; said Joe Vernick , 81 , president of the U.S. Merchant_Marine Veterans of World_War_II , which organized the ill-fated voyage to France . The Lane Victory ' s participation in the Santa Monica ceremonies would be more symbolic than nostalgic : Vernick said only a_couple_of the ship ' s 55 crew_members participated in the June 6 , 1944 , invasion , when Allied troops stormed Nazi strongholds on the beaches of Normandy , turning the tide of the war in Europe . So can the ship make the 30-mile trek from the harbor to the shores of Santa Monica ? Vernick believes repairs should be done_in time for the &quot; invasion. &quot; So instead of being greeted with shouts of &quot; Bienvenue ! &quot; the crew just might hear , &quot; Gnarly , dude. &quot; * MIRACLE ON MARKET STREET : Yuletide cheer settled_on the Venice boardwalk in recent weeks at least for those who happened to notice the Christmas decorations between Rose Avenue and Market Street . In Venice , where oddity is always in season , most folks didn ' t seem to notice anything out of the ordinary . The decorations , it turns_out , were props for an as-yet untitled Nora Ephron movie that began shooting along the oceanfront in mid-April . The comedy , which stars Steve Martin , Rob Reiner and Juliette Lewis , takes_place on Christmas_Eve at a suicide prevention hot_line in Venice , publicist Betsy Sokolow said . But extras , leave your Santa suits at_home . The shooting wrapped last week and the garlands and wreaths have been removed . Watch for the movie to open around Thanksgiving . * CAMPAIGN FOLLIES : Ever notice that there ' s an inverse relationship between the number of new initiatives a politician sponsors and the number of days till the next election ? We were reminded of this again this week , when West Hollywood Councilman Paul Koretz faxed a &quot; media alert &quot; concerning his latest proposal , a neighborhood patrol program for West Hollywood with citizen volunteers . Koretz ' s fax machine seems to have been overheating ever since the Democrat found himself in a crowded race for a seat in the state Assembly representing the 42nd District . Among his proposals this year : new gun-control ordinances and a measure that would make West Hollywood the first city in the country to require all new buildings to be equipped with outlets for recharging electric_cars . Alas , the latest proposal is not quite original . Nancy Greenstein , West Hollywood public safety administrator , said a proposed community watch project fell_into limbo earlier this year because of residents ' apathy . Koretz said the program , if implemented , could help combat hate crimes against the gay and lesbian community and could be modeled on a successful program in San Diego . The primary is June 7 .
