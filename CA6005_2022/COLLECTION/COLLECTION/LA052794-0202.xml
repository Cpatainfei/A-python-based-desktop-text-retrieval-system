   <HEADLINE> TICKET TRICKS ; ILLEGAL SCALPERS SAY THEY ' RE JUST MAKING A LIVING WHILE MAKING CUSTOMERS HAPPY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No way he ' s selling crack cocaine -- not any more , says Cory Robinson . Yet here he is , in a ragtag cluster of men on a noisy Los Angeles street_corner , watching the cars for action and worrying about another police bust . &quot; We ' re not selling no drugs , we ' re not committing no robberies , &quot; Robinson says defiantly , a diamond stud in each ear , his eyes sharp under a low-slung cap . &quot; We ain ' t doing no wrong . We ' re just giving the people what they want. &quot; What they want , this night , is a ticket or two to the Dodgers game . Robinson is a scalper , a nomadic wheeler-dealer in the illegal ticket trade . At 21 , he says , he has spent four years taking tax-free profits at sporting events all_over the map . He ' s done hockey in Toronto , football in Oklahoma , and college basketball ' s Final Four in North Carolina . That blue cap he ' s wearing is a memento of the Super Bowl in Atlanta , where he picked_up $ 1 # 000 for a day ' s work in January . Dodger Stadium is his favorite Los Angeles venue , as it is for more_than 50 independent , unlicensed entrepreneurs who unlawfully work the winding roads outside the ballpark , all but in the shadow of the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s training academy . The scalpers run a season-long cat-and-mouse game with LAPD vice officers , winning just often enough to survive -- though not in great numbers , or in lavish style . Most are poor street hustlers , moonlighting from blue-collar jobs or using scalping as a sole source of income . &quot; A lot of guys say if they wasn ' t dealing tickets , they ' d be dealing hub caps , &quot; says Danny , 35 , a veteran of 15 seasons who , like most scalpers , refuses to divulge his full name . Danny is the prototypical scalper : Wearing his Dodgers cap , he shows_up three hours before game time , working the cars on strategic points along Stadium Way , Elysian Park_Avenue and Academy Road . Virtually every scalper carries the same hand-printed cardboard sign : &quot; I need tickets. &quot; The sign is a bit of a ruse . It advertises that the scalper is ready to deal without touting the unlawful side of his trade -- the fact that , when not buying tickets , he is busily hawking them for sometimes double or triple the face_value . The tickets come from anywhere -- box_offices , licensed brokers or , often , season-ticket holders who choose not to attend a given game . The brokers and season-seat holders know the scalpers are out there , ready to pay_cash for good locations . They drive_up and unload their unwanted tickets in hasty , through-the-car-window deals . Scalpers then await their buyers , who are expected to see_through the counter-logic of the &quot; I need tickets &quot; signs . &quot; They will see you ' re dealing in tickets and they ' ll ask ( if we also sell ) , &quot; says Rick , 55 , who dangles a cigarette from his fingers while advertising on steeply sloping Elysian Park_Avenue , north of Sunset Boulevard . On a good_night , the scalpers at Dodger Stadium say , each can haul down $ 150 , even $ 200 . But there are risks . They can be stuck_with unwanted tickets , a chronic occupational hazard . LaMont , 24 , who scored a $ 1 # 700 windfall at last year ' s USC-UCLA college football game , remembers getting burned not long ago at a hockey_game in Anaheim : He invested heavily in tickets to the Mighty Ducks ' final home_game of the season , only to have the team fall_out of the playoff race . It cost him $ 200 . &quot; The bottom fell_out , &quot; he says . And then there are the police , often in plain clothes , posing as buyers just as they would during a drug bust . The police confiscate their tickets and issue citations , scalpers say . Fines run about $ 200 . Even if police don ' t catch them in the act , passing patrol officers shoo them along . Scalping is neither a high-priority crime nor a significant problem , except at sold-out games or rock_concerts , police say . But the practice of snapping_up tickets and boosting prices cheats customers of a chance to buy those tickets at a fair value , said Detective Kurt Joachimstaler of the LAPD ' s administrative-vice gambling section . Under state scalping laws , tickets cannot be resold , even at face_value , on the premises of an arena . City ordinances also make_it a misdemeanor to resell tickets off-site without a license , such_as those held by ticket agencies . Scalpers resent the regulations and the busts . They say their main problem -- maybe their only real problem -- is the police . &quot; It ' s rough , man . . . the cops harass us , &quot; complains Michael Williams , 22 , who says he has been cited perhaps 10 times in five years . The cops got him just the other day , he adds . &quot; They could be out there doing their jobs , chasing the big-time thieves and dope dealers . We ' re not bothering nobody . We ' re just doing our jobs , like they are. &quot; Strolling the shoulder of Stadium Way , Williams holds his sign_in one hand and a brown bag in the other . A Budweiser cap pokes up like a budding flower . He talks_of his trade as nothing short of a public_service , saying fans rely_on him . &quot; They don ' t have to wait in_line , &quot; he says . &quot; Sold-out games , we give them the tickets they want. &quot; Williams says he works nearly every Dodgers home_game , spending $ 1.10 to take the bus downtown from South-Central Los Angeles . In between games , Williams runs a forklift at a warehouse , he says . He supports five children and step-children , plus a cat and a dog , he says . &quot; This is just enough to make ends meet , &quot; he says . &quot; This is work . It ' s a grind. &quot; LaMont is one of the lucky ones . He owns a car , an old beige Oldsmobile . Robinson used to have a car -- an ' 80 Buick Regal -- but it broke_down at a Pink Floyd concert in Oakland . He sold it there for $ 900 , enough for plane fare to Las Vegas to roll the dice , as it were , on the recent Julio Cesar Chavez fight . Now he gets_to Dodger Stadium by bus from Hawthorne , dreaming of the day when he will buy his own minivan . On this night , the Cubs are in town . Up_on Academy Road , where LaMont is one of several scalpers working a busy stretch of asphalt , a deal is going_down . Brian Schroeder of Farley , Iowa , has rolled into town in his &quot; Cubs Mobile , &quot; a blue ' 71 Volkswagen convertible with &quot; Cubs &quot; and &quot; Holy Cow ! &quot; splashed in red across its flank . Schroeder has come a_few thousand miles and wants a seat right behind the Cubs ' dugout . One scalper has it -- a seat four rows back . The face_value is $ 11 , but the scalper wants $ 40 . They haggle good-naturedly until Schroeder agrees to pay $ 30 and pulls_out his wallet . &quot; We said $ 35 ? &quot; the scalper asks . &quot; No , $ 30. &quot; The deal is made and the scalper walks away , chuckling . Schroeder is grinning , too -- another satisfied customer . &quot; He ' s laughing_at me because no one ' s going_to pay that for the Cubs ' side ( of the field ) , &quot; he says of the scalper . &quot; But I ' m going_to enjoy the game , right ? that ' s baseball. &quot;</TEXT>
