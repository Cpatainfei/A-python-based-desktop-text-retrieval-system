   <HEADLINE> SOCIAL CLIMES / THE BUZZ : BECAUSE A T-SHIRT IS SO OLD HAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a real treat when , upon leaving the Los Feliz Theater after a screening of &quot; Ed Wood , &quot; we happened_upon a stack of papers in the lobby with photocopies of the actual death certificates of Wood and the pathos-inducing Bela Lugosi . Upon closer examination , we found this to be the work of Hollywood ' s ghoulish guides , Grave Line Tours . &quot; We thought it would be kind of cool , &quot; says Greg Smith , Grave Line ' s owner . Smith , who ' s also been distributing Houdini death certificates , points_out that these documents are available to anyone who wants to take the trip to the County Registrar and , er , dig them up . &quot; I loved the movie so_much , I thought it would be nice for the theater and nice for us . . . and a sleazy way to advertise , I guess. &quot; Simple Tastes : On our busy round of recent costume parties , while we found most of the ubiquitous Simpson trial-inspired outfits to be tedious , uninspired and scarcely worth a mention , we do award a Social Climes accolade to one clever minimalist we ran_into at a Hollywood party . At first , this reveler appeared to be costumeless , until we spied a small , rectangular badge on his jacket : &quot; Juror. &quot; Enough ' s Enough : &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; is taking_up a lot of bandwidth in cyberspace . On the Internet ' s Quentin Tarantino fan newsgroup ( he ' s one of a handful of directors to be awarded such an on-line honor ) , the flurry of messages -- numbering in the hundreds -- following the film ' s opening have yet to die_down . Not since Zapruder has a film been so thoroughly deconstructed and significance attached_to the most seemingly banal details . At least one ' netter thought that it had all gone too far . &quot; Do you really believe that QT filled every scene or line of dialogue of his movie with some hidden meaning or homage to some_other film ? &quot; he posted . &quot; Give it up . Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. &quot;</TEXT>
