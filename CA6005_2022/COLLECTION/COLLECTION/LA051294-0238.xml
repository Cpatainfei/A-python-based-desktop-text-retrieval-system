   <TEXT> Out Dexter Charles ' 35th-floor window is a stunning view of lower Manhattan . In front of him , a flickering , color-coded array of computer_screens gives a second-by-second read of the prices of securities in a half-dozen markets around the world . But as he starts his workday , Charles ' attention is focused_on a_few pages in his hand -- data showing what will happen to his $ 350-billion portfolio of complex financial deals at Chase Manhattan Bank if interest_rates change by a hundredth of a percent . It ' s a calculation so involved that it must be done overnight on a state-of-the-art computer workstation . &quot; We used to be able to use PCs to do this , &quot; Charles says of the portfolio &quot; stress_test &quot; -- so called because every fraction of a percentage_point change in rates places exacting strains on his holdings ' value . &quot; But they ' re not powerful enough anymore. &quot; This is the world of derivatives : deals whose value is based on the performance of an underlying stock , bond , commodity or index . Thanks to the influence of advanced technology , these transactions have become so esoteric -- yet pervasive -- that regulators fret that they are endangering the financial system ' s stability and Congress muses over whether they should be banned outright . During the last few weeks , such august corporations as Procter &amp; Gamble , Mead Corp . and Gibson Greeting Cards have reported major losses -- $ 102 million , $ 7.4 million and $ 19.7 million , respectively -- from derivative transactions gone sour . Securities and Exchange Commissioner Richard Y . Roberts says the SEC expects many_more American firms to report heavy losses this year from similar deals . Earlier , big investors like George Soros used derivatives to place huge speculative bets_on the direction of interest_rates . When the wagers proved wrong , their forced sales of assets to cover the losses aggravated this winter ' s sharp drop_in stock and bond prices . Some regulators and members of Congress are seeking to tighten government oversight . Derivatives have been cursed as the ultimate in useless financial speculation and praised as indispensable management tools . Sometimes the praise and condemnation come from the same source : All three of the companies posting the most recent losses previously were content users , but all say the troubled deals were uniquely complex and did not belong in their portfolios in the first place . That is important because almost everyone in the derivatives business agrees on one point : The transactions stand to become only more complex as users discover new needs and computers become powerful enough to design new solutions . &quot; We ' re in the early days in all_of this , &quot; says John G . Heimann , director of global derivatives trading at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . The growing derivatives industry can be viewed_as a case study of the life_cycle of innovation on Wall_Street . Like technological advances in many walks_of_life , derivatives have elicited fear , suspicion and blame for market crashes and heavy losses -- a reputation many observers say is undeserved . &quot; It ' s still possible to lose money in all_the old familiar ways , &quot; says Merton Miller , a Nobel economics laureate and professor of finance at the University of Chicago . The $ 751-million loss faced by Germany ' s Deutsche Bank from a recent garden-variety real_estate collapse , he notes , makes Procter &amp; Gamble ' s woes look minor . &quot; But derivatives are a novelty item , &quot; Miller says . &quot; And the very notion that some of it is done_by computer has an ominous ring to it. &quot; Still , derivatives over the last few years have quietly worked their way into the hearts of thousands of companies and investment_firms . Precise figures are not available , but it seems likely that almost every major corporation in America uses them in some form . Indeed , some large institutional investors are required by their bylaws to hedge certain risks using derivatives . The managers of New Jersey ' s $ 350 million in state pension_funds were not permitted to sink $ 35 million into foreign stocks until they came_up with a way to hedge the investment against losses from currency fluctuations . Until recently , such a hedge might have been difficult to find . But starting in the 1980s , Wall_Street ' s innovators learned how to assemble options , futures and other commitments in ways that allowed them to fine-tune hedges to the financial world ' s ever more exacting specifications . Instead of hedging against the simple risk that the_British pound might rise over the next six months -- that can be accomplished using a derivative known as a currency forward -- a company might want to hedge against the possibility of the pound rising against the Japanese yen under certain interest-rate conditions . Hedging such interrelated risks as interest_rates and currencies requires exceedingly complex matches of options , futures and other securities . Just knowing what to charge customers for such transactions required banks and investment_firms to employ the most sophisticated computers available . The same computers were needed to track the values of the hybrid derivatives , which theoretically could change second-by-second . As befits products on the leading edge of financial innovation , derivatives have accumulated a correspondingly abstruse jargon . Among the more_than 1 # 200 known varieties are swaps , caps , collars , swaptions , range forwards , quantos , IO ' s , PO ' s , death-backed bonds , limbos and heaven-and-hell bonds . If those terms resemble the whimsical names , like &quot; quarks , &quot; which physicists give to the ever smaller particles into which they are slicing the atom , that is because derivative designers are engaged in the similar task of splitting financial risk into ever finer pieces . It is no surprise that some of the leading figures in the business got their education not in business_school but in the engineering departments of places like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- from which Dexter Charles earned degrees in both aerospace engineering and business . It is also no coincidence that many of the more complex deals behave unpredictably when their underlying markets suffer shocks , as the interest-rate markets did this year . Just as Newtonian physics mysteriously break_down at extreme high speeds and infinitesimal distances , conventional economic relationships break_down at the border of financial turmoil . &quot; In the bond market , you can easily get outside of the region where mathematical formulas work , &quot; says John O ' Brien of Leland O ' Brien Rubinstein , the Los Angeles consulting_firm whose esoteric formulas for deploying derivatives as &quot; portfolio insurance &quot; were blamed for exacerbating the 1987 stock_market crash . &quot; Things get beyond the point of predictability. &quot; The result of guessing wrong at the technological frontier can be a warp-speed wipeout . New York money manager David Askin lost $ 600 million of his clients ' money and his entire investment_firm in virtually 24 hours this year when the &quot; stripped &quot; mortgage-back securities he was trading -- thinly-traded securities derived from pools of mortgage loans -- collapsed in value as interest_rates soared . Askin had used an elaborate mathematical formula to hedge his market risk using futures and options . But his portfolio was so exotic and the market for it so tight that he could not find a buyer for his holdings at a rational price . In other words , his hedge failed . Such cases contribute to a public impression that some of Wall_Street ' s so-called &quot; rocket scientists &quot; are shooting new products into the air without enough concern about where they come_down . And they add_to the sense that regulators should be doing something about it . &quot; We ' re not keeping pace with the rate of innovation , &quot; says Halsey Bullen , project director on derivatives for the Financial Accounting Standards Board , a private body that oversees corporate accounting regulations . &quot; The rate of change is so great that you ' re regularly presented with an instrument that makes you scratch your head to figure_out what it is , what its purpose is and how do you break it down into something understandable ? &quot; One place where the limits of financial innovation are tested daily is at Dexter Charles ' desk at One Chase Plaza . Charles , a 33-year-old vice_president in Chase Manhattan ' s global risk management group , uses the overnight portfolio run to tell him what new_deals he can accommodate in his portfolio that day . This is the essence of the derivatives business today . In its infancy 10 or 15 years ago , banks largely brokered deals between customers . If one had a floating-rate loan but wanted to lock_in interest payments as if it were a fixed-rate loan , the bank would find a customer that wanted to exchange its fixed-rate loan for a floating-rate debt . The clients would swap their obligations ; the bank took a finder ' s fee . Few deals today are done so directly . Now , bankers behave more like insurance_companies . When you buy fire_insurance for your house , your insurer assumes the risk and disperses it throughout its portfolio of policies -- most of which will not result in claims . Similarly , a bank in the derivatives business assumes its clients ' financial risks , dispersing them through its pool of similar or opposing deals . It tries to hedge any excess risk through the futures and options markets . Charles ' key tool in managing his pool of deals is the overnight stress_test . The numbers he reviews in the morning allow him to appraise every new_deal -- he might see 20 to 60 a day -- by asking , as he puts it , &quot; Will it mitigate the risk already in my portfolio or increase it ? If it ' s the first , I can offer the customer a lower price to do the deal than if it ' s the second. &quot; To manage the calculations involved in this process requires something more_than conventional bank training . On graduating from MIT , for instance , Charles designed helicopters at Sikorsky . &quot; A lot of the developments you ' re seeing in derivatives are tied to developments in technology , &quot; he says as he scans his screens . Take &quot; basket options , &quot; the latest innovation in Charles ' arsenal of risk-management tools . A basket option is a derivative that allows users to hedge against multiple related risks at a lower cost than hedging each risk separately . An airline might be concerned that a rise in interest_rates would cause a damaging run-up in payments on its floating-rate bank debt . But rather than pay the high cost of using options to hedge against a rate rise , it might buy a cheaper hedge that kicked_in only when both interest_rates and another expense -- say , oil prices -- were climbing . Linking those risks together increases the complexity of the deal geometrically . But Charles foresees a time soon when he can offer clients derivatives that manage three or more risks simultaneously . It is this ability to construct such fine-grained hedges that is the key to derivatives ' usefulness , as well as their dangers . As so often happens with financial innovations , many users , even conservative ones , now say they could not manage without derivatives . But as banks and investment houses search for clients and situations in which their expanding derivative-designing capabilities can be put to profitable use , regulators and other observers fear that they are trying to sell relatively unsophisticated users on extremely volatile , risky transactions . Many financial executives say they have been approached by banks over the last year or two with overly complex deals , or with transactions aimed at addressing less-than-pressing problems . &quot; These bank officers are dreaming_up ways to accomplish things that couldn ' t be done normally , &quot; says Terry Griffis , treasurer of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid_Transit Authority ( MARTA ) . For years , Griffis ' agency has employed a derivative known as a swap to lock_in its diesel-fuel expenses a year at a time . And MARTA ' s board , he says , still believes_in the transactions , which have saved the agency about $ 1 million over the last three years . But the recent spectacle at Procter &amp; Gamble , like others elsewhere , &quot; has had a negative impact on our willingness to look_at &quot; any more elaborate deals , Griffis says . &quot; They ' re more difficult to sell to the board. &quot; There is no question that derivatives place an unprecedented premium on management skills . The issue raised by recent highly publicized losses is whether the transactions were so complex that corporate managers did not comprehend the risks . In other words : Did their bankers take them for a ride ? &quot; I don ' t agree with the premise that anything is being done that ' s so complicated it can ' t be understood , &quot; says Joseph P . Bauman , recently appointed director of Bank of America ' s derivatives business and the chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Assn . &quot; If a company ' s management can ' t understand a transaction , they probably shouldn ' t be entering into it. &quot; But even the skills of sophisticated investors can be challenged by some of the more esoteric devices . &quot; It ' s very difficult for an outside investor , even one as big as us , to determine the true costs of some of these transactions , &quot; says DeWitt Bowman , recently retired as chief investment officer for the $ 81-billion California Public Employee Retirement System , the nation ' s largest public pension_fund . In fact , derivatives are so complex that they could undermine systems of control and regulation that otherwise have survived decades of financial experimentation . Accountants and regulators are looking_for ways to ensure that risks from derivatives are somehow disclosed on a company ' s annual report , for example . But no such efforts will overcome the fact that an annual report can be more_than three months out of date by the time it lands in investors ' hands . In the world of derivatives , that delay might as well be a century . &quot; Regulation has always been based on slowly moving institutional structures , &quot; observes Myron Scholes , a Stanford_University finance professor whose 1970 formula for setting a price on options , developed jointly with his colleague Fischer Black , often is given credit for ushering_in the age of financial complexity . &quot; But if things are very fluid and dynamic , then perhaps the old institutions can ' t be preserved. &quot; Others argue that the very history of finance is the story of regulators and government trying to keep_up with such developments . As Merrill Lynch ' s Heimann puts it , &quot; Traders are always ahead of management , management is always ahead of the regulators , the regulators are ahead of the auditors and the auditors are ahead of the lawyers. &quot; HOW DERIVATIVES WORK A HYPOTHETICAL CASE 1 ) Albatross Airways wants to insure itself against two risks : a rise in interest_rates that would boost the cost of its adjustable-rate bank loan and a rise in oil prices that would jeopardize its ability to buy jet fuel . Albatross can live with one or the other . But if both happen at once , the airline ' s future will be threatened . 2 ) The airline ' s bank agrees to protect Albatross against the double-barreled risk . It offers Albatross the equivalent of a put_option on U.S. Treasury_bonds , giving Albatross the right to sell T-bonds at a given price at some time in the future . The value of the option rises as interest_rates go_up and bond prices fall . That means any money Albatross makes on the option would offset its higher loan costs as interest_rates rise . To keep the costs of this insurance_policy down , the bank offers the option only if oil prices also rise above a certain threshold price . That way , Albatross is protected only if both interest_rates and oil prices rise . 3 ) Now the bank , not Albatross , faces the risk that oil and interest_rates will rise . If Albatross exercises its option , the bank will have to buy Treasury_bonds from the airline at the option price . But it could only sell them at a lower market_price , leaving the bank with a loss . 4 ) So the bank takes steps to hedge that risk -- that is , to insure itself against the cost of paying_off Albatross ' insurance : * 1 . To hedge against the risk of a drop_in bond prices ( the same as a rise in interest_rates ) the bank sells Treasury_bond futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange . As Treasury prices fall , the value of the T-bond position rises , creating a gain that counters the bank ' s loss on the option held by Albatross . To hedge against rising oil prices , the bank buys oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange . As oil prices rise , so will the value of the bank ' s oil futures ; that covers its potential loss in the oil market . * 2 . But the futures play is only a temporary step . As soon as it can , the bank finds a client needing to insure against risks that are just the opposite of those faced by Albatross -- in other words , a company that would be damaged by falling interest_rates and falling oil prices . WHAT CAN GO_WRONG Derivatives plays don ' t always work_out , as recent market turmoil has underscored . Here ' s what can happen to the participants : THE AIRLINE Albatross could buy an option for more oil than it actually needs , perhaps because its business ebbs and it needs less jet fuel . In that case , it has overhedged its oil needs , which is tantamount_to making a speculative bet_on the future direction of oil prices . To avoid this danger , the airline needs to restructure its option to reduce the amount of oil covered . THE BANK The bank ' s formula showing how oil prices and interest_rates are linked -- its basis for balancing its trades_in the T-bond and oil futures markets -- could prove wrong . In that case , the combined trades would not produce enough income to offset its obligations to Albatross . The bank then would record a loss . GLOSSARY DERIVATIVES--Options , futures , or combinations thereof . &quot; Exchange-traded &quot; derivatives are offered for_sale on regulated exchanges around the country , which theoretically guarantees that buyers and sellers can always be found at some price . &quot; Over the Counter &quot; derivatives are designed by banks and investment_firms and tailored to the hedging needs of sophisticated customers . But because they may be unusual or even unique , there is no easy way to set a value on them . CALL OPTION--A contract allowing , but not requiring , the holder to buy a given commodity at a set price ( the &quot; strike price &quot; ) by a certain date . If the strike price is higher than the cash price of the commodity at the expiration date , no sale takes_place and the option simply expires . If the strike price is lower than the cash price , the owner of the option exercises his right to buy the commodity ; he then could immediately sell it at the higher price , pocketing the gain . PUT OPTION--A contract allowing , but not requiring , the holder to sell a given commodity at a set price ( the &quot; strike price &quot; ) by a certain date . If the strike price is lower than the cash price of the commodity at the expiration date , no sale takes_place and the option simply expires . If the strike price is higher than the cash price , the owner first buys the commodity at the lower market_price and then immediately exercises his right to sell it at the strike price . The difference is his profit . FUTURES--Contracts obligating the buyer to purchase a given commodity from another party on a certain date . Among other things , the underlying commodity can be grains , other foodstuffs , oil , bonds , stocks , or baskets of stocks that make_up a stock index . Most futures are traded on regulated exchanges in Chicago and New York . In most cases , delivery of the underlying commodity never takes_place ; the deal is closed_out by the sale of an equivalent future . CAP--A derivative that allows a user to set a ceiling on his or her risk . For example , a company may want a cap that protects it from paying interest on its debt over a certain level . FLOOR--The opposite of a cap . A user might be seeking protection from the effects of interest_rates falling below a certain level . T-BONDS--U.S. Treasury_bonds with terms of 30 years . Considered the safest long-term investments in the U.S. financial markets .</TEXT>
