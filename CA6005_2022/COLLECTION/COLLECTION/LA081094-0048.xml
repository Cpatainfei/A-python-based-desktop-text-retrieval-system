   <HEADLINE> RUBE GOLDBERG WON ' T YOU PLEASE GO_HOME ; HEALTH REFORM : THE PATCHED TOGETHER BILLS WILL HAVE TERRIBLE SIDE_EFFECTS , WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE PAYING THE HIGHEST PRICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Among other things , the Democratic health-care plans contain a large -- and unjustified -- multibillion-dollar tax on younger workers . You wonder whether most members of Congress know this or even care . The whole health-care debate is now completely out of control . The desperate effort to craft something that can be advertised as &quot; universal coverage &quot; means that Congress literally no longer knows what it ' s doing . Anything resembling the Democrats ' bills , if enacted , would produce tremendous unintended side_effects . Apparently , most Americans grasp this . In a Newsweek poll last week , respondents were asked whether Congress ought to &quot; pass reform this year &quot; or &quot; start over next year. &quot; By a 2-1 margin , they said start over . They sense that the versions of health reform crafted by House and Senate leaders are hodgepodges of conflicting provisions whose only purpose is to win passage . But what is clear to ordinary Americans is denied in Washington . In the capital , the fiction is that legislators know what they ' re doing and are debating rational alternatives . House Majority_Leader Richard Gephardt ' s plan , for instance , would create a Medicare Part C_program for the unemployed , workers in small companies and many existing Medicaid recipients . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the program might enroll 90 million people . But the projection could easily err by millions in either direction . More important , Medicare Part C emphasizes &quot; fee for service &quot; medicine ( patients selecting individual doctors ) , while the rest of the bill emphasizes &quot; managed competition &quot; ( reliance on health_maintenance_organizations and similar plans ) . The bill would separate the under-65 population into two groups , mainly based on income and size of employer . Each group would be crudely steered toward a different type of medicine . In practice , this division may_not be politically acceptable or economically workable . Gephardt doesn ' t know ; no one does . Now , consider the tax on young workers . It arises from &quot; community rating. &quot; As people age , their health costs and insurance_premiums rise . But community rating requires that everyone pay the same rate . This provision is included in the House bill and , in a modified version , in the Senate bill . The effect would be to raise insurance for younger workers ( say , those below 45 ) . If employers have to pay higher insurance , they will pay lower salaries . The invisible tax on young workers might total $ 25 billion annually . Questions swirl around both Gephardt ' s plan and Senate majority_leader George Mitchell ' s . It is hard even to describe Mitchell ' s plan . He says it ' s voluntary and lacks a &quot; mandate. &quot; Wrong . True , it doesn ' t mandate companies to buy insurance for workers . But it does mandate a standard benefits package for firms -- the vast majority -- that offer insurance . Because the mandated benefits are above average , this would probably raise health spending . Companies below the new standard would increase benefits ; those above would have trouble lowering them . Next , Mitchell hopes to achieve 95 % insurance coverage by offering subsidies for low-income workers to buy_it . But there ' s a &quot; fail-safe &quot; mechanism to limit subsidies if the budget costs exceed projected costs . However , if 95 % coverage doesn ' t occur by 2000 , Congress could require employers to pay 50 % of their workers ' insurance . But this would apply only to firms with more_than 25 workers . Got it ? No one knows whether this would reach 95 % coverage . These plans are confusing because the health debate evaded the basic tension between expanding health services ( universal coverage , etc. ) and controlling health spending . It ' s hard to do both at_the_same_time . The plans ' complexities -- as with the original Clinton plan -- aim to disguise this conflict . Republicans haven ' t been especially constructive in this debate , because they haven ' t faced_up to it either . But they are now correct that a bad bill would be worse than none . Chaos is now the most important reality about the health-care debate . Dozens of provisions in these bills would have huge unappreciated consequences . John Sheils of Lewin-VHI , a health consulting_firm , says premiums for small businesses in the Mitchell bill could be 25 % higher than for big companies . The budget office puts the gap lower . Who ' s right ? Do most members of Congress understand the gap ? Probably not . Still , the pretense is that Congress is making conscious choices . The pretense is sustained because in Washington politics is sport . All attention fixes on who wins and loses -- and the deals that enliven the game . Rhetorical blasts are taken_for reality ; political reporters know little of how legislation would work and care less . This often leads to bad laws , and in health_care , the potential for blunders is huge because Congress is tinkering with one-seventh of the economy and most aspects of medicine . In May , Robert Reischauer , head of the budget office , warned that trying to find a compromise by combining provisions from different bills might make the health system worse . He compared it to building an auto engine with incompatible parts : &quot; You can ' t say I want a piston from Ford , a fuel pump from Toyota . . . and expect the engine to run. &quot; Well , that ' s what ' s happened . The contraption is part car , part tractor and part rollerblades . Most Americans seem to understand this . Will Congress ?</TEXT>
