   <HEADLINE> HOSPITALS PRIME HATCHERIES FOR DRUG-RESISTANT BACTERIA ; INFECTIONS : EFFORT TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION HEIGHTENED , BUT 5 % TO 10 % OF ALL PATIENTS GET INFECTIONS WHEN HOSPITALIZED . THAT CONTRIBUTES TO 60 # 000 DEATHS A YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The quiet of the intensive care unit is disturbed only by the soft chatter of the staff and the hum of machines keeping people alive . Some patients are_on respirators , many barely able to move under the tangle of tubes and intravenous lines . In this unit , at Columbia Presbyterian Medical_Center , the patients are getting_the_best treatment medicine has to offer . But they also could be facing risks as never before . Hospitals are the cradle of the growing threat of bacteria resistant to antibiotics , and the sickest_of patients are the most vulnerable . Five percent to 10 % of all patients get infections when they are hospitalized . Each surgical cut is a breach in the body ' s most important defense , the skin , and the sicker the patient , the more vulnerable the person is to infection . Hospital-borne disease is a major contributing factor_in 60 # 000 deaths each year , according to the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention . In many cases , bacteria and infection are the last push to death . Bacteria lurk everywhere -- on clothing , walls , blankets , medical equipment . Hospital workers can pass them on by hand . Some bacteria cling_to plastic and travel up tubes inserted into the body . So , doctors say , in the quest to treat cancer and AIDS and debilitating diseases , the weakest patients also are facing greater risks with the emergence of resistant bacteria in hospitals . &quot; The level of infection now is unacceptable , &quot; said Dr. Alexander Tomasz of New York ' s Rockefeller University . &quot; We must have enforcement of infection control : nurses washing hands between patients , wearing and changing gloves . &quot; There are strict rules now , but the suspicion is they are not being followed. &quot; Tomasz and Dr. Richard Roberts , chief of infectious_diseases at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical_Center , helped found the Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance Group . The group wants the city ' s hospitals to help it track strains of bacteria that have developed resistance to at least some antibiotics -- enterococcus , staphylcoccus and pneumococcus . The group has the support of the city ' s health department , but its surveillance program is voluntary and it ' s too soon to say if it will be successful . Tomasz acknowledges that some hospitals may be reluctant to participate because disclosing problems with resistant bacteria could jeopardize their reputations . Tomasz and Roberts say what is needed in large part is a rededication to practices pioneered by Florence_Nightingale : good hygiene and monitoring infectious_diseases in hospitals . &quot; We must encourage people to wash their hands between patients . It ' s not done as well as it should be , &quot; Roberts said . Hospitals also are trying to isolate patients with resistant bacteria by putting them in rooms by themselves , placing a tremendous strain on some facilities . &quot; My understanding is that resistance is so prevalent in some places that they don ' t have enough rooms for these patients , &quot; Roberts said . Kathleen Jakob , an infection-control specialist , instructs Columbia Presbyterian ' s staff about problems with resistant bacteria . &quot; This is an emerging problem that doctors and nurses didn ' t learn about in school , &quot; she said . Her department examines bacteria from the lab to identify any patients with resistant bacteria . Nurses and doctors wear gowns , gloves and masks when treating a patient , then take_off the gear before moving_on . Medical equipment is specially cleaned and , in some cases , the hospital will limit the staff_members allowed to treat a patient . Until the 1920s , hospitals were known as crowded poorhouses of rampant disease and infection . Indeed , the middle_class and wealthy were treated at_home . Resistant bacteria could give hospitals a bad name again , and eventually make choosing a hospital a consumer issue -- especially if super-strains of enterococcus , which are resistant to the &quot; last_resort &quot; antibiotic vancomycin , share their DNA with other microbes . Bacteria are capable of this , and many doctors think it only a matter of time before staphylcoccus or pneumococcus pick_up this shield . Then the problem of resistance would be exponentially worse because staph and pneumococcus are extremely common , in hospitals as well as in the community at_large . &quot; In the future , somebody is going_to find_out that a hospital has a problem and sue , &quot; said Dr. Stuart B . Levy of Tufts University and the author of &quot; The Antibiotic Paradox : How Miracle Drugs Are Destroying the Miracle. &quot; &quot; I know hospitals that have problems , but I ' m not going_to identify them , &quot; he said . &quot; The sooner somebody can get_out of the hospital , the better . There are times when home is safer for a patient. &quot;</TEXT>
