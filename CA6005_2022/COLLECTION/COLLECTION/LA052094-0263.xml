   <HEADLINE> VETERAN ACTOR TRINTIGNANT ' S TALK OF THE TOWN ; CANNES REPORT : THE FRENCH STAR IS SHOWCASED IN TWO FILMS , ' THREE COLORS : RED ' AND ' REGARDE LES HOMMES TOMBER. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although its imperturbable director insists that it realizes only 35 % of his intentions ( as opposed to 30 % for the rest of his films ) , Krzysztof Kieslowski ' s &quot; Three Colors : Red &quot; looks_to be the surest bet to win at least one Palme d ' Or at the Cannes Film Festival , if not for film or director then at least for best actor for French veteran Jean-Louis Trintignant . But for Trintignant , the role of a misanthropic judge whose life changes when a young model ( Irene Jacob ) runs_over his dog , was challenging &quot; only in the technical sense ; I never had a problem understanding my role or understanding the story. &quot; With his other film at Cannes , &quot; Regarde Les Hommes Tomber &quot; ( &quot; See How They Fall &quot; ) , a mesmerizing film noir that opened the Critic ' s Week section , the story was entirely different . For though he has starred in more_than 100 films , including Claude Lelouch ' s &quot; A Man and a Woman , &quot; Bernardo Bertolucci ' s &quot; The Conformist &quot; and Eric Rohmer ' s &quot; My Night at Maude ' s , &quot; Trintignant admits that he ' s never had a part anything like the surly , violent conman named Marx in director Jacques Audiard ' s debut film . Speaking through a translator , Trintignant acknowledged that Kieslowski was &quot; a director with very precise ideas , much more demanding . With certain moments , even with the rhythms of speech , which Kieslowski wanted faster than my Southern manner , he knows exactly what he wants. &quot; With &quot; Regarde , &quot; however , &quot; the challenges were of a psychological order . I found the character much harder to understand , and I was very frightened during the filming . I was worried I would not be able to act the person , that I would n ' t be realistic . &quot; It was all_the more difficult because I ' m quite well known in a certain way , and I was afraid I would n ' t be believable , that the audience would n ' t be able to forget that they ' re watching an actor. &quot; However with &quot; Regarde &quot; a hot ticket for French audiences here ( it has yet to find an American distributor ) , Trintignant has relaxed . &quot; I ' ve seen the film . I think it is a good film and that I ' ve given a good performance , &quot; he says quietly . &quot; Now I ' m not worried. &quot; * &quot; Unfortunately , my name is Paul , &quot; says P.J. Hogan , the writer and director of &quot; Muriel ' s Wedding. &quot; Unfortunately because in Australia , &quot; Crocodile Dundee &quot; made another Paul Hogan into a kind of national symbol . &quot; I ' m too stubborn to change it , &quot; says this Hogan , smiling . &quot; But I tell everyone I ' m his love_child . Maybe he ' ll believe it and leave me some money . Anyway , I believe we can coexist in the film world . we ' ll have to. &quot; After the tumultuous reception &quot; Muriel ' s Wedding &quot; has received at Cannes , Hogan will no longer have to worry about the confusion . An uproarious tale of an ugly_duckling who is fixated past the point of sanity on getting_married , &quot; Wedding &quot; is the comic crowd-pleaser of the festival so far . &quot; I ' m interested in life ' s outsiders , and it was liberating to put someone as gauche as Muriel , who wears a fake leopard-skin dress to a wedding , on screen , &quot; Hogan says . But because &quot; actresses are so devoted to perfection in look , &quot; until he met the fearless Toni Collette , &quot; I couldn ' t give this part away. &quot; If being confused with the other Paul weren ' t enough , Hogan is married to director Jocelyn Moorhouse , whose &quot; Proof &quot; was one of the most impressive of recent Australian films and who served as co-producer on &quot; Muriel. &quot; &quot; Jocelyn says that I bring_out her humor and she brings_out my eccentricity , &quot; Hogan says . &quot; Before she met me , she used to make very Bergmanesque short films , uncontaminated by humor of any sort . And though I ' m drawn to comedy , she ' s gotten me to go deeper. &quot; Deeper for &quot; Muriel &quot; means a dark edge to the proceedings that Hogan says he had to fight to keep . &quot; I abhor sentimentality , &quot; he says decisively . &quot; There ' s nothing worse than a film that comes_up and licks you. &quot; * Some films , perfect gems though they are , have a hard_time making_it out of film festivals , and the Polish &quot; Wrony &quot; ( &quot; Crows &quot; ) may be one of them . Only 66 minutes and made_for a big sounding but really tiny budget of 6 million zloty ( approximately $ 300 # 000 ) , it is a beautifully assured , poetic look_at a day in the life of two small girls in the Polish city of Torun . &quot; that ' s Copernicus ' birthplace , &quot; volunteers writer-director Dorota Kedzierzawska through a translator . Age 36 and herself the daughter of a female director , Kedzierzawska first began writing &quot; Wrony &quot; because &quot; I wanted to do something with my daughter so I would n ' t miss her while I was away shooting . But before the money could be found , she was old enough that she didn ' t want to do it. &quot; To find &quot; Wrony ' s &quot; leads , Kedzierzawska looked_at more_than 2 # 000 children , and then found that the two selected wanted to leave the picture within a week . The two charming girls selected ended_up being found on very short notice and the director , whose second film about children this is , says dealing with them &quot; is easier for me than working with some adults . They are more open , more direct , though you have to be very patient. &quot; And what does Kedzierzawska ' s mother the director think_about &quot; Wrony &quot; ? &quot; She loves it , &quot; comes the bashful answer . * One of the most fascinating characters in Kayo Hatta ' s &quot; Picture Bride , &quot; the evocative story of the trials of a Japanese mail-order wife in 1918 Hawaii , is that of the benshi , a traveling narrator who would supply the verbal accompaniment to silent films . &quot; They were often a bigger attraction than the on-screen people , &quot; says Hatta , a graduate of UCLA ' s film school . &quot; Kurosawa ' s brother was a benshi , and when the silent era ended , he committed suicide. &quot; Though it seemed like &quot; a total fantasy , &quot; Hatta ' s first choice to play the benshi was legendary Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune . And though he didn ' t reply to her letter for five months , Mifune , who has ties to Hawaii , agreed to take the part . &quot; I was initially intimidated , thinking , ' What am I doing directing Mifune in my first film ? ' &quot; Hatta remembers . &quot; But he wasn ' t gruff and unapproachable at all . He would really listen carefully , even furrowing his eyebrows . And if he couldn ' t remember his lines , he would knock himself on the head and say , ' Oh , I ' m getting old. ' &quot; One of Hatta ' s most memorable Mifune moments came even before the shooting began . &quot; He had had Tojo , the big Japanese studio , make him a costume appropriate for a benshi , and he called us to his hotel_room to see it . Mifune is a very precise man , he held_up each garment and explained how it was cut , how it was worn , how it was supposed to hang . The whole presentation must have taken about an hour . He turned it into a ceremony. &quot;</TEXT>
