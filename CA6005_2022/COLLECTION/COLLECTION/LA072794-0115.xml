   <HEADLINE> HAITIAN MILITARY FORESEES DEAL WITH U.S. , SOURCES SAY ; CARIBBEAN : ARMY BELIEVES IT CAN AVERT BOTH AN INVASION AND THE RETURN OF EXILED PRESIDENT ARISTIDE . CRITICS SEE HOLES IN THE PLAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Haitian military , satisfied it has faced down the threat of U.S. military intervention , now expects to maneuver the United States into easing its punishing economic sanctions while keeping President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in exile , Haitian army and political sources say . Interviews with ranking Haitian officers , associates of key military figures , political experts and diplomats provide the outlines of a strategy that aims to make a deal that the regime believes the United States won ' t have the stomach to refuse . &quot; If all goes_to plan , &quot; said one Haitian civilian supporter of the military , &quot; by the first of the year , ( Lt . Gen . Raoul ) Cedras will be gone , a new election will be planned and at least some of the sanctions will be lifted . And Aristide will still be in Washington. &quot; The idea in broad form is that Cedras will step_down -- anytime from today to the end of January , with many sources looking_to October or later . Then , puppet President Emile Jonassaint will propose a national election for early 1995 in which all parties and organizations , including those supporting Aristide , will participate . But Aristide -- ousted in September , 1991 , only seven months after winning Haiti ' s first truly democratic presidential election -- will be ineligible for election under current laws , which prohibit him from succeeding himself . This plan , obviously , falls far short of U.S. demands -- formally , if not enthusiastically , supported by the United Nations -- for what must happen in Haiti . The United States has insisted that Cedras must go and that Gen . Philippe Biamby , the army chief_of_staff , and Police_Chief Michel-Joseph Francois must resign or leave Haiti before the economic sanctions are &quot; completely lifted. &quot; But the U.N. Security_Council resolution also speaks_of &quot; progressive suspension &quot; of sanctions &quot; based on progress in the implementation ( of previous agreements to return Aristide ) and the restoration of democracy in Haiti. &quot; The Haitian military and its puppet civilian government expect their plan will meet just enough U.S. demands that the Clinton_Administration will not be able to revive even the meager support it had for an armed intervention , a plan that sources said was recently set_aside . At the same time , the economic sanctions the United States is counting_on to drive the military from power will prove too embarrassing to continue , the Haitian regime believes . &quot; They expect the impact will be so dreadful in terms of the country ' s poor that the American people will be revolted , particularly because the military and their allies will appear to be unaffected , &quot; said a diplomat who supports Aristide ' s return but is critical of the sanctions . This disgust -- combined with what the military thinks is fading U.S. support for Aristide and the army plan to portray itself as having a democratic turn of mind -- will leave the United States no option but to negotiate a settlement in which the army remains relatively unharmed ; the main goal of keeping Aristide away also would be achieved . By objective standards , however , the strategy is_full of holes -- a combination of misperceptions of U.S. politics and wishful_thinking by the Haitian military and its allies , diplomats and other Haitian experts say . First among the many problems is the assumption that President Clinton ' s willingness and ability to intervene militarily have dissipated permanently . &quot; Yes , right now Clinton has set_aside plans for an invasion , &quot; said a diplomat , &quot; and there is no political or popular support . But that could easily change if these people ( the army ) start_up on human_rights or the refugee situation gets bad again or Clinton just decides he ' s had enough with sanctions and delays and it ' s time for the army here to go. &quot; Second , a U.S. official said , Cedras and Jonassaint are counting heavily on support from conservative elements in the United States who may have oversold their influence . &quot; The conservatives have been effective in stopping any pro-invasion momentum , &quot; he said , &quot; but recent news_stories ( about connections between the military and conservative U.S. supporters , particularly in Congress ) and bragging by &quot; pro-military leaders here &quot; really hurt them because it made their people in Washington back off. &quot; A third problem with the military ' s plan is the assumption that the army and the Jonassaint government can get_by no matter how severe the punitive economic measures . After surviving , even flourishing , under almost three years of various levels of sanctions , some supporters of the military appear to be wavering . One prominent individual , at a recent , sumptuous buffet at the home of a leading army supporter , told of suddenly realizing that the halting of all commercial air traffic effective this Saturday means that his daughter probably will not be able to attend college in France . &quot; Something will have to give , &quot; he muttered about the sanctions and his masters ' refusal to bend . It was an extraordinary statement from one of the most influential men in the military circle . The buffet guests said the toughened sanctions won ' t force fundamental changes but may drive the military to a more accommodating position faster than planned . Ranking Haitian military sources said one principle still drives the army -- the survival of the military as an institution . And that is now defined by one simple goal -- keeping Aristide out of power . &quot; The military , from the generals down to the little soldiers , know one thing , &quot; said a military source . &quot; If Aristide returns , the army will be destroyed. &quot; That means , he added , the army will remain unified no matter personal ambitions , loss of income , feelings about the international sanctions or even the likelihood of an invasion .</TEXT>
