   <TEXT> French troops pushing deeper into western Rwanda reported finding mass graves Friday , the second day of their mercy mission . The French are offering protection to refugees from the ethnic slaughter that has convulsed this central African_nation for more_than two months.More French troops joined the mission Friday , crossing over from bases in Zaire . Hoping to ease the suspicions of Rwanda ' s predominantly Tutsi rebel movement , French commanders made their first objective the refugee camp at Nyarushishi , where 8 # 000 Tutsis have been menaced by fanatical Hutu militias . About 50 commandos were_on guard Friday , a day after moving_in from Zaire . Leaders of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front do not trust France because it intervened to prevent a rebel assault on the Hutu-dominated government four years ago . Still , rebel officers repeated Friday that their fighters will not try to confront French troops if they stay in the government-controlled west . Gen . Raymond Germanos , assistant chief_of_staff , told reporters in Paris that patrols checking towns along Lake Kivu on the western fringe of Rwanda found several mass graves . He said there was no immediate word on the number of victims or their ethnicity . He said French soldiers saw &quot; youths carrying knives and sticks , &quot; but the groups showed no hostility . France insists that it is not taking sides in the civil_war this time and wants only to prevent more massacres , which U.N. officials estimate have killed hundreds of thousands of civilians , most of them minority Tutsis . With the approval of the U.N. Security_Council , the_French government plans to put about 2 # 500 soldiers and marines in Rwanda for two months until an all-African U.N. peacekeeping force twice that size arrives .</TEXT>
