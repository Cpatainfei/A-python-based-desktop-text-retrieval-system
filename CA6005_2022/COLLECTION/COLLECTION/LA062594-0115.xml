   <HEADLINE> EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : WESTLAKE VILLAGE ; MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO STATE TAX_EVASION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 33-year-old inventor pleaded guilty in Ventura County Municipal Court Friday to charges of state income_tax evasion after trying to trick authorities into thinking he was living_in Texas . Blake R . Schwartzman , the co-inventor of the raised plastic ring that protects Swatch watches from scratching against rough surfaces , failed to file state tax_returns on more_than $ 1 million from 1987 to 1989.He now faces back taxes , penalties and interest of more_than $ 200 # 000 and could serve_up to three years in prison , said Jim Reber of the California Franchise_Tax Board . In 1987 , Schwartzman , a Westlake Village resident , created a company in Williamson County , Tex. , called Best Timing . He also registered to vote , opened several bank_accounts and obtained a driver ' s license in Texas , which has no state income_tax , Reber said . &quot; I can only suspect that he wanted to save $ 200 # 000 in taxes , &quot; Reber said . California authorities learned from a confidential informant earlier this year that Schwartzman never actually moved to Texas and had been living_in California all along . After checking Schwartzman ' s financial and utility records and other documents , authorities charged him with tax_evasion in March . &quot; This is an unusual case because of the lengths he went_through to deceive us , &quot; Reber said . &quot; We believed there was criminal intent. &quot; Schwartzman ' s sentencing is scheduled for Aug . 5 .
