   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE ' S ORBIT LOWERED TO GET 3-D RADAR MAPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The space shuttle Endeavour dipped closer to Earth on Friday to create astonishingly detailed 3-D radar maps of the planet that might one day enable scientists to predict earthquakes and volcanic_eruptions . By retracing its orbital steps and passing_over the exact spot two days in a row , the shuttle can use its radar to map the same ground features from slightly different angles and detect changes in terrain as small as half an inch . &quot; Imagine if we could globally monitor earthquake faults prior to the eruption of earthquakes and see very minute changes in those earthquake faults , or if we could look_at volcanoes as the domes start to expand , &quot; said astronaut-physicist Peter ( Jeff ) Wisoff . &quot; This might lead to some type of early-warning system for population centers that are nearby those earthquake faults or volcanoes. &quot; Flying over the same spot on Earth is easier said than done -- there are no road markers or maps in space . NASA has never attempted to match shuttle orbits before . Earlier this week , flight directors succeeded in bringing Endeavour ' s orbit to within 30 feet of where it was during a similar radar-mapping mission in April . * The real test came Friday . Commander Michael Baker lowered Endeavour ' s altitude from 135 miles to 127 miles -- one of the lowest ever for a space shuttle -- to begin duplicated passes just 24 hours apart . Early Friday afternoon , the radar surveyed a swath of North_America , from western Canada to the Great Lakes to the Chesapeake Bay . Endeavour is supposed to fly the same course today so the radar can scan the same area . Repeat observations are planned over Africa , the Middle_East and Siberia . By combining these repeated images , scientists hope to produce topographic maps of incredibly high resolution -- accurate in elevation to within six yards or less , compared to the current 10 yards and more . These &quot; stereo &quot; views will allow researchers to detect changes in the Earth ' s surface as small as half an inch , said Mike Sander , project manager at NASA ' s Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena .</TEXT>
