   <HEADLINE> MAN ARRESTED IN ARIZONA FACES BIGAMY CHARGES ; MATRIMONY : POLICE SAY THE EX-MODEL WAS MARRIED TO FOUR WOMEN , INCLUDING ONE IN PALMDALE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Charmaine Whalen is nobody ' s fool . When her husband , Vernon Pierce , failed to fly out and meet her family after the couple ' s April 29 wedding , Whalen decided it was time to do a little poking around . Now Pierce , 33 , is facing bigamy charges and Whalen , 24 , is considering a job change : from bank teller to police_officer . &quot; My dream was to go_into the LAPD , and I put my dreams on hold for him , &quot; Whalen said . &quot; Now I really want to do it. &quot; Pierce , an ex-model , turned himself in Tuesday to authorities in Glendale , Ariz . He was charged there with two counts of bigamy . Authorities said he was married to four women -- two in California and two in Arizona . He had eluded investigators since June 6 , when Whalen asked police to go_to his Arizona home . Instead of finding Pierce , detectives found another wife . After the two women compared notes , police found records of at least four marriages , one in 1989 and three this year . &quot; Obviously , there was a lot of lying going_on . I did the best I could , but I still made mistakes , &quot; Pierce told the Arizona Republic . Pierce , who was free on $ 1 # 500 bail Wednesday on bigamy charges , said he was dating other women , keeping track of some of them on a 3-by-5-inch card labeled &quot; Who to Marry. &quot; He also carried a little black_book in his wallet to keep his stories straight . Said Lois James , 64 , Whalen ' s grandmother : &quot; He was one smooth talker. &quot; Pierce said he told his wives that his job required him to travel . The truth , he said , was altogether different . &quot; I didn ' t have a job . I didn ' t have time , &quot; he said . Pierce said it was difficult to juggle the four relationships . &quot; People say guys fantasize about something like this , and I guess I did , &quot; he said . &quot; But you don ' t have your own life. &quot; Now police say Pierce is awaiting trial at the home of his latest wife , Lemitri ( Mimi ) Reed of Culver City , whom he married June 5 . &quot; She ' s standing by her man , &quot; Whalen said of Reed . &quot; Well , she can have her man. &quot; Meanwhile , Whalen feels fortunate not to have had any children with Pierce . After getting an annulment , she hopes to marry again . With one difference , she said : &quot; There will be a strict background investigation. &quot; Associated Press contributed to this story .</TEXT>
