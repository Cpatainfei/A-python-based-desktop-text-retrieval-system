   <HEADLINE> U.S. MAY SPEND MILLIONS FOR BLACK-MARKET FUEL IN HAITI ; CARIBBEAN : GASOLINE MEANT FOR AID AGENCIES WAS SEIZED BY ARMY . PAYMENTS FOR NEW SUPPLIES WOULD ENRICH MILITARY , ITS ALLIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States plans to pay millions of dollars to Haitian black marketeers violating U.S.-designed sanctions so it can replace more_than half a_million gallons of petroleum stocks confiscated by the military regime from humanitarian groups , U.S. and private aid officials said Tuesday . Speaking of the humanitarian aid effort , which feeds almost 1 million Haitians and will run_out of fuel within weeks , U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager said , &quot; We will do whatever we have to do to keep the program going. &quot; He told reporters this includes U.S._government financing of fuel purchases by humanitarian groups from what he referred to as &quot; the spot market , &quot; a diplomatic reference_to the extensive black_market controlled by Haitian army_officers . &quot; We are not going_to let the program die , &quot; Shrager said when it was pointed_out that such purchases would not only violate a U.S.-supported international embargo against gasoline imports but would encourage increased smuggling . The cost of this choice could be $ 4.4 million at current prices , about $ 8 a gallon . The confiscated fuel totals 550 # 000 gallons . The bitterness of this option is even sharper because almost all_the gasoline brought into Haiti is in the hands of businessmen and army_officers blamed by the United States for creating the current crisis ; they ousted Jean-Bertrand Aristide , the country ' s duly-elected president , 35 months ago . &quot; It ' s sweet , isn ' t it ? &quot; said a young businessman who smuggles gasoline from the neighboring Dominican_Republic . &quot; The Americans have made me rich with their embargo , and now they are going_to make me even richer. &quot; The U.S. decision not only promises even greater riches to the military and its supporters , it also leaves the regime with a gasoline stockpile , allowing it to protect its strategic reserves if the fuel flow is reduced . &quot; It ' s just sitting there under their control , &quot; said an official for one humanitarian group . &quot; They don ' t have to use it ; just having it gives them more room . It ' s like found money. &quot; The present problem surfaced a month ago when the regime refused to release 550 # 000 gallons of fuel permitted by the sanctions and designated for use by CARE , Catholic Relief Services and several smaller private agencies that provide food and medicine to about 960 # 000 of Haiti ' s poorest citizens . The supply was to last two months , but the military sealed the storage_tanks and has refused to permit any distribution , demanding that high-ranking aid officials and senior U.S. diplomats negotiate with them for the fuel ' s release . But this is impossible , Shrager said , because the United States -- which finances most humanitarian programs here -- will not deal directly with the military or its puppet civilian government , arguing &quot; they are both illegal and illegitimate. &quot; U.S. officials had expected Haitian authorities to relent this week . But Shrager said Tuesday that the optimism had faded and that there was &quot; no indication &quot; the fuel would be distributed . Some small groups are already out of fuel ; the largest groups say their supplies will last for two or three weeks more . The humanitarian food program , designed to offset the worst effects of the international embargo , &quot; is crucial to us , &quot; Shrager said , explaining the plans under way to purchase smuggled gasoline . This is not the first time U.S. officials have dipped_into the gasoline black_market . The U.S. Embassy is the single largest purchaser of illicit fuel , buying thousands of gallons of gasoline , sources involved in smuggling said . U.S. sources said that at one point earlier this year , embassy fuel purchases , made at higher-than-street prices to ensure delivery , put the mission ' s budget $ 300 # 000 in the red and led to State_Department threats to reduce staff and operations . U.S. officials defend their black-market fuel purchases and the plan for helping aid agencies , noting there are no alternatives . &quot; We have to be realistic , &quot; Shrager said . &quot; There is no other source. &quot; The inability in the last three years to stop fuel smuggling has been a major reason why the Americans have failed to drive the military from power and restore Aristide , by the accounts of most diplomats and Haitian experts . &quot; If the Americans do this , &quot; said one diplomat , commenting on reports of impending black-market fuel purchases , &quot; it will guarantee the life of this regime. &quot; Adding_to U.S. distress has been the failure to gain meaningful cooperation from the Dominican_Republic in closing its border . Despite constant pledges by the Dominicans to stop smuggling -- and the deployment of a U.S.-Canadian military_force to monitor the border -- President Joaquin Balaguer ' s government has refused to cooperate , diplomats said . &quot; Balaguer finds first one excuse , then another , &quot; said a diplomat whose government is involved in the negotiations . &quot; The fact is that his military is getting rich from the smuggling , and they aren ' t ready to give it up -- not now , not ever. &quot;</TEXT>
