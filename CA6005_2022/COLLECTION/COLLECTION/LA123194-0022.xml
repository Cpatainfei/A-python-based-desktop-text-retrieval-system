   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : COUNTYWIDE ; SURF FORECAST SPURS FLOOD WARNING FOR SOME BEACH CITIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Anticipating surf that could reach 10 feet at local beaches this afternoon , forecasters warned that accompanying high_tides may cause flooding_in Seal Beach , Surfside and the Huntington Cliffs areas . &quot; On a scale from one to 10 , this is an eight , &quot; said Sean Collins , a meteorologist with the Surfline / Wavetrak forecasting service in Huntington Beach. &quot; This is something to watch_out for. &quot; Forecasters say the surf is not expected to be as big as last week ' s breakers that snapped surfboards in half at the Huntington Beach Pier . But some Seal Beach homeowners have placed sandbags outside their beachfront homes_in case high_tides bring the surf over the top of a sand wall built_on the beach . This round of big surf , coming from a series of storms about 2 # 500 miles off the coast , could generate waves of up_to 20 feet in Central California and could threaten the Ventura Pier , forecasters predict . Coastal flood warnings have also been issued for some Los Angeles and San Diego County beach cities . The oncoming swell is more westerly than normal , allowing it to pass_through the offshore islands without losing as much energy as normal , according to forecasters . They predict that another strong west-northwest swell on Tuesday might cause waves of up_to eight feet at some Orange County beaches . &quot; This is still early for our big wave season , &quot; Surfline forecaster Kevin Noonan said . &quot; This is only the beginning. &quot; He said coastal flooding will not be as severe as flooding caused by the El Nino-driven storms of 1982 and 1983 . But he said the National Weather Service has alerted forecasters to the possibility of a reawakened El Nino in the new year.RUSS LOAR</TEXT>
