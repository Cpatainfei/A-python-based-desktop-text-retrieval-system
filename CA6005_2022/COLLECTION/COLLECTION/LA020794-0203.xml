   <TEXT> It ' s going_to take a lot more_than a pick and shovel to build the information superhighway . Workers who want to join what is touted as the next great economic boom will need high-tech skills in everything from computers to electronics -- not to mention such old-fashioned creative talent as knowing how to recognize a good_story or having an artistic eye . that ' s the early consensus among employers involved in the initial stages of the interactive television business . But these executives caution that because the technology of the information highway is still evolving , it is difficult to know exactly the kinds of jobs that will be available . Employers don ' t even have real names or titles yet for the kinds of workers they want . Dick Green , president of Denver-based Cable Labs , the technology research consortium of the cable TV industry , says cable TV operators and telephone_companies building the information superhighway are looking_for people who are &quot; flexible enough to have a foot in the computer_business , know about networking , telecommunications , cable and consumer electronics. &quot; Many of the jobs will be in the so-called computer-collar class developing the software and programming that will flow over the fiber-optic pipeline into homes . But there will also be jobs at the hardware end of the information superhighway -- literally laying the fiber-optic foundation , installing and maintaining the sophisticated equipment , and running the complicated transmission systems . As cable TV systems around the country begin offering services that have historically been provided by telephone_companies , cable operators will be looking_for technicians who understand operating systems and can write the software to run them . Cable companies &quot; are looking_for highly technically trained employees , possibly coming from ( the ) aerospace industry , but also Bell Labs , the regional Bell companies , AT &amp; T Long Lines , McGaw Cellular , MCI , &quot; said Bruce Gillman , vice_president of human resources at Viacom Cable . Technicians , who know how to deploy fiber-optics and understand digital as well as analog transmission systems , will be needed . There will also be a demand for engineers and managers who can make the technology &quot; customer friendly &quot; and enticing to consumers . Because the cost of bringing the fiber-optic lines into homes is three to four times more expensive than traditional telephone or cable service , people with the marketing savvy to wring more dollars out of customers will be particularly prized . One area where the skill base is already high -- and getting higher -- is_on the software side . At the outset , interactive media was dominated by people with computer backgrounds , but this is no longer the case . Increasingly , it attracts people with more traditional skills -- writers , producers , graphic designers . Evidence of the shift in skills is turning_up at the training grounds for the entertainment_industry . UCLA Extension is offering a new curriculum , &quot; Multimedia and Digital Technologies , &quot; where students can take classes in the game paradigm and interactive communications , and virtual_reality . The American Film Institute inaugurated classes on interactive design . New York University offers a graduate program in interactive telecommunications . Indeed , the aspiring multimedia producer in the not-too-distant future is going_to have to be as knowledgeable_about arcane topics such_as cross platform interactive_multimedia and optical storage as they are about what agent to call_for the next hot writer or up-and-coming director . Viacom New Media , for example , has hired 100 people in the past year and is looking_to add 50 more . The Viacom Inc. unit develops interactive games for the CD-ROM market , but one day such programming is expected to be delivered over cable or telephone_lines . It can take more_than a year to develop a single CD-ROM title with a team of eight to 12 people . They include writers , computer_programmers , graphic_artists , game designers , interface developers and beta testers -- not typical of the people found on a Hollywood set . &quot; This is not just imitative , &quot; said Michele DiLorenzo , vice_president of Viacom New Media . &quot; We are combining animation , video , writing , graphics , and combining it in some way to come_up with a new experience. &quot; Much of the programming for the information superhighway is being developed by small computer-game companies that have been pioneering interactive media for several years . And that is where many of the new jobs are expected to materialize . ActiVision , a Los Angeles-based video_game producer , placed an ad in a Hollywood trade magazine a_few months ago announcing that it was looking_for &quot; producers , programmers , artists and technologists. &quot; The company got more_than 400 responses . Similarly , Industrial Light &amp; Magic in San Rafael , the company famous for creating the dinosaurs in &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; recently hired 100 new employees and trained them in the use of high-tech computers to create special_effects and animation . So where do people learn the skills they need to produce , say , interactive programming ? Tom Williams , who oversees digital production at Industrial Light &amp; Magic , said he goes_to multimedia industry conventions , such_as SIGGRAPH held every summer in Anaheim , to recruit potential employees . But he also notes that technical knowledge -- the ability to work with a computer , for example -- is not as valuable sometimes as innate talent . ILM hires many artists to help design special_effects , and Williams notes that the necessary training can be done in-house . Entertainment is not the only area in which interactive producers will be needed . Education and home shopping programming , which some experts believe will be major components of the information superhighway , will employ growing numbers of producers and designers . One of the biggest demands will be for artists who can work_at computer work stations creating the software for the programming that , for example , would show a sweater from a clothes catalogue in every style and color and from every angle . Although such projects can be as technically impressive as a NASA shuttle launch , they are years away from resulting in meaningful employment opportunities , cautioned Steven Koltai , senior_vice_president at Warner Bros . &quot; The jury is still very much still out as_to what is going_to be entertaining to the consumer , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' ve had an interactive video business for six years and in the pay-per-view business , the lion ' s share of the ( business ) history has been ( for pro ) wrestling. &quot;</TEXT>
