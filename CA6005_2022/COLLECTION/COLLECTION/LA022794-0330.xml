   <HEADLINE> ARAB RAGE SPARKS RIOTS ACROSS MIDEAST ; 3 KILLED ; ISRAEL : SOLDIERS RING HEBRON AS RESIDENTS MOURN MOSQUE VICTIMS . OCCUPIED TERRITORIES ARE SEALED OFF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Violent demonstrations over the massacre of 48 Palestinians at a mosque in the occupied West_Bank spread deep into Israel on Saturday as Israeli Arabs protested the atrocity . Three more Palestinians were killed in continuing clashes with Israeli forces in Jerusalem , the West_Bank and the Gaza Strip , and military commanders early today ordered the indefinite closure of the occupied territories , preventing Palestinians from entering Israel . Lt . Gen . Ehud Barak , the Israeli chief_of_staff , said he was deploying more forces throughout the territories in an effort to restore calm , but he emphasized that the soldiers had orders to act with maximum restraint . &quot; We are confident we can contain further violence , whether the source be attacks by ( Israeli ) settlers on Palestinians or by Palestinians seeking revenge for the massacre in Hebron , &quot; Barak told diplomats in Tel Aviv . &quot; But our goal is not only to contain , but to quiet the situation , which is now very , very tense , so that the peace process will not be disrupted by this crime. &quot; President Ezer Weizman , describing the attack by a Jewish settler on the Ibrahim Mosque in Hebron as &quot; perhaps the gravest thing that happened to us in the history of Zionism , &quot; said he will travel_to the West_Bank city today to offer his condolences and to apologize on behalf of the Israeli people . &quot; We have to work to heal the wounds. &quot; Hebron was saturated Saturday with Israeli troops and paramilitary police , and more soldiers ringed the city , about 20 miles south of Jerusalem , as residents continued to mourn the dead . Widespread clashes continued , however , between Israeli troops and Palestinians elsewhere in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . The protest also spread to other Arab nations . In Lebanon , Palestinians in refugee camps burned tires and draped their homes with black cloth in mourning . In Syria , hundreds of refugees marched through a refugee camp on the outskirts of Damascus waving black banners . More_than 2 # 500 youths marched through the Baqaa refugee camp in Jordan , chanting slogans against Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and the peace process . In Gaza , more_than 35 firebombs were thrown at army patrols in the course of the day , a military spokesman said . A Palestinian youth was killed in one Gaza clash , and another was killed near Tulkarem in the West_Bank . Police battled stone-throwing youths for most of the day around Jerusalem ' s Old City and in other Arab neighborhoods . Paramilitary border police shot and killed one youth when , they said , he appeared to be preparing to hurl a grenade rather than a rock at them . The decision to impose a strict closure in the West_Bank as well as the Gaza Strip reflected the government ' s anxiety over possible revenge attacks in Israel ' s cities by Palestinians in the wake of the Hebron massacre . Violence had erupted Saturday in Jaffa , Nazareth , Ramle and other Israeli towns with large Arab populations . Hundreds of Arab youths rampaged through Jaffa , adjacent to Tel Aviv ' s commercial center , looting and burning Jewish shops , torching cars and stoning police and passersby . Police reported arresting 40 of the demonstrators . Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Milo called the Jaffa riot &quot; an extraordinary occurrence , an eruption sparked by what happened in Hebron , &quot; and he called_for a return to the &quot; good relations between Arab and Jew &quot; in the city . More_than 3 # 000 Israeli Arabs demonstrated in Nazareth , using burning tires to block the main_road and stoning Jewish cars after a rally where they demanded that the government disarm Jewish settlers in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . Police used tear_gas and clubs and fired over the heads of the crowd to break_up the protest in Nazareth . More_than 45 people were arrested . Roads were blocked through much of the Galilee region , according to police . Most Arab villages in the area held rallies to protest the massacre and flew both Palestinian flags and black banners of mourning . Police reported clashing with demonstrators in several other areas . The protests , bringing some of the everyday violence of the occupied territories into central Israel , were a dramatic reminder to the Jews that nearly a_million of the country ' s population , more_than 18 % , are Arab and Muslim and share the anger over the attack by a Jewish settler on worshipers at the mosque in Hebron . &quot; We try_for good relations with the Jews , but we are also part of the Arab and Palestinian people , &quot; said Abdel-Wahab Darawshe , an Arab member of Israel ' s Parliament . While describing the protests as &quot; a storm that will calm , &quot; he said they also reflected &quot; a history of being neglected &quot; by Israel ' s Jewish majority . Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin met Saturday evening with Israeli Arab leaders to plead for their support in maintaining calm and in preserving the momentum in the peace negotiations with the PLO . &quot; There is no doubt that at this stage we must save the negotiations , &quot; Foreign Minister Shimon Peres commented as the violence spread . &quot; Certainly , the ( Hebron ) incident places an enormous burden on us. &quot; Fears of a serious setback to the talks increased after state-run Israel Television , quoting a preliminary army investigation into the attack at the Cave of the Patriarchs on Friday , reported that two soldiers on_duty there had rushed in as worshipers were overpowering the gunman , Baruch Goldstein , and opened_fire on the Palestinians , adding_to the carnage . After visiting the Ibrahim Mosque at the shrine , which is sacred to both Jews and Muslims , Barak , the Israeli chief_of_staff , told reporters : &quot; According to what is known to me right now , Dr. Goldstein was the only one who was shooting. &quot; The soldiers had fired warning shots in the air outside the mosque amid the confusion , Barak insisted , but had not fired at the Palestinians . Results of the army investigation are expected early this week , according to military sources , and the government will decide today whether to order an independent judicial inquiry . Immigration Minister Yair Tsaban , a member of the leftist Meretz Party , called_upon the Cabinet to give &quot; very serious treatment of all_the events surrounding the massacre &quot; in an effort to rekindle trust between Israel and the PLO . Pressure is building within the ruling Labor_Party and among its political allies on the left for tough action against extremist groups among the 130 # 000 Israeli settlers in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . Speaking at a rally in Jerusalem on Saturday , Peace Now leader Tsali Reshef called_for removal of Jewish settlers from Arab population centers , for the immediate implementation of the autonomy agreement with the PLO and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state . &quot; For our brothers the Palestinians , there are no words in our mouths to express the shock , pain and sorrow for the events in Hebron , &quot; Reshef said , urging the government to follow up its words with concrete steps . Times researcher Emily L . Hauser in Jerusalem contributed to this report .</TEXT>
