   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : U.S. NEEDS TO STOP LECTURING JAPAN AND MAKE ITS OWN LUCK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As news came from Tokyo that Japan ' s ruling coalition was breaking_apart , imperiling new Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata ' s tenure , leading experts on Japan and Asia were meeting in Los Angeles to hear author James Fallows talk_about his new book , &quot; Looking_at the Sun : The Rise of the New East Asian Economic and Political System. &quot; Insofar as Japanese politics is concerned , the experts agreed that Hata would be out of office in a matter of weeks , possibly to be replaced by Ochiro Ozawa , the deputy leader but real power in Hata ' s Renewal party . Far more significantly , Japan is changing its electoral_system to one of constituencies voting for a single member of Japan ' s legislature , similar to congressional elections in the United States . Indeed , Fred Notehelfer , director of UCLA ' s Center for Japanese Studies , predicted that after their next election , Japan ' s parties would realign philosophically along the lines of U.S. Democrats and Republicans . But such political change in Japan won ' t make_it an Asian model of the United States . On the contrary , party realignment will be only one change among many in the next few years , including a move toward Japanese rearmament and defense and foreign_policies more independent of the United States . The implications for global business and for future trade and other relations among the United States , Japan and the rest of Asia are profound . Independent policies &quot; would make Japan a real country , one that bears responsibility for its own sovereignty and makes its own policies , &quot; Fallows writes . As it is , Japan ' s dependence on the United States for military and foreign_policy only exacerbates disputes over Japan ' s trade surpluses -- $ 141 billion with all_the world ' s major nations and trading blocs , including roughly a $ 50-billion surplus with the United States . But look beyond numbers , says Fallows . A lot more is happening in Asia . His book covers the economies of half_a_dozen countries from Japan to Thailand , but its real subject , says the author , is the political and historic watershed marking the end not only of the post-World War II period but of centuries of colonial history . &quot; Throughout the region there is the sense that must have prevailed in much of Europe in the 1800s and the United States through the past century , that economic activity is changing life even as you watch , &quot; he writes . But Fallows , 44 , a Harvard graduate and Rhodes scholar who took a diploma in developmental economics from Oxford , is more sharp-eyed than wide-eyed . He recognizes how closely linked the Asian_nations are to Japan , which has become the main source of investment and technology for Southeast_Asia . Japanese industry has invested roughly $ 30 billion in Thailand , Malaysia and Singapore , a total now greater than that of U.S. firms . Fallows points_out how reliant the larger economies of South_Korea and Taiwan are_on Japanese technology . And he reports that despite the current recession , Japan ' s industry has been investing for the future -- a total of $ 3 trillion in new plants and equipment between 1987 and ' 92 . Private investment has been augmented by $ 400 billion a year in public works spending by government . As a result , writes Fallows , East Asia , centered_on the industrial might of Japan , has become the fastest-growing part of the world economy and should remain so &quot; through the 1990s and beyond. &quot; The region owes a lot to the United States , which last year bought $ 100 billion more in goods from Asia than it sold in return , and also protected the region with military_forces on land and sea . But Asia is not in a mood for gratitude these days . As Asia ' s economies have prospered , and social change has brought pressure on its traditional societies , Asia ' s leaders have become resentful of lectures from Washington -- about free-market economics or democracy or the punishment of vandals . Yes , says Fallows , Asian governments may be authoritarian and their trade more statist than free-market . But the way they see it , those policies have brought them prosperity , and U.S. officials are not helping the American cause by finger-wagging lectures . Fallows ' book has been attacked for saying such things , but it is only reporting what Asian scholars are saying : that the West could learn some values from their societies . More bluntly , Asians find U.S. protests of Singapore ' s caning sentence for an American vandal pathetic when Asian students are shot to death in U.S. streets . What , then , should be the U.S. approach to this fast-changing world ? In effect , &quot; to thine own self be true , &quot; says Fallows , who lived with his family in Asia for more_than three years while researching this book . Develop and strengthen the unprecedented values of the American system , which has always welcomed outsiders and encouraged individuals . Specifically , he writes , fix U.S. education so that &quot; the worst educated &quot; reach a_level of competence . The best of U.S. education is better than anything in Asia , including Japan , he says . In trade , he counsels , don ' t lecture Japan -- or other countries -- about open markets or &quot; fair &quot; trade . Simply demand that they buy U.S. goods , as was done_in the U.S.-Japan semiconductor agreement of 1986 . If they stall or refuse , cut_off their sales to the U.S. market . And increase incentives for Americans to save , and put the money behind U.S. industry , Fallows recommends . &quot; The United States should make itself less dependent_on Japan &quot; for capital and technology , he writes . &quot; Japan does not look_upon its relationship with the United States as something that inherently is desirable or that should be maintained out of a philosophical commitment to shared ideals , &quot; Fallows says . So as Japan and Asia change , America needs to change also , to strengthen itself . &quot; Now , as in the past , &quot; Fallows concludes , &quot; economics favors those who are determined to make their own luck. &quot;</TEXT>
