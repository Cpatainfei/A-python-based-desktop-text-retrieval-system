   <HEADLINE> JUPITER TAKES HUGE BLOW FROM COMET ; SPACE : EXPLOSION IS DESCRIBED AS HAVING HUNDREDS OF TIMES THE COMBINED ENERGY OF ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON EARTH . FIREBALL BRIEFLY OUTSHINES THE PLANET ITSELF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An immense fragment of a dying comet hit Jupiter so hard early Monday that the blast momentarily blinded the world ' s largest optical_telescope and sent awed astronomers around the world scrambling for superlatives to describe the impact . At NASA ' s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland , which is coordinating reports on the ongoing collision of Jupiter with the pieces of a shattered comet , astronomers estimated the force of the impact at 6 million megatons of TNT -- hundreds of times the combined energy in all_the world ' s nuclear_weapons . The impact of Fragment G , as the two-mile-wide piece of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 is designated , created a fireball that briefly outshone Jupiter itself , scientists said . An equally large fragment hit late Monday and another of similar size was expected to hit Wednesday . The impact , the most powerful planetary explosion ever observed , sent superheated gases spewing thousands of miles into space from a planet already marred by black scars left by nine chunks of comet debris that have fallen since Saturday . The fragment plunged about 60 miles into Jupiter ' s atmosphere before exploding , scientists estimated . &quot; The energy released is beyond any of our experiences on Earth , &quot; said Lucy McFadden , a University of Maryland astronomer . &quot; Ten thousand megatons is the total energy that we can create on Earth with bombs. &quot; Jupiter ' s black_eye , as planetary scientist Heidi B . Hammel dubbed the enormous , circular plume erupting from the giant planet Monday , is approximately 9 # 600 miles across and , during its peak at 12:51 a.m. PDT , rose more_than 1 # 300 miles into space , scientists said . Hammel is leading the team of scientists gathered_in Maryland to analyze the images produced by NASA ' s Hubble Space Telescope . &quot; The fact that G got as bright as Jupiter itself in the infrared ( a heat measurement ) means that we ' re dealing with a very big object , &quot; said Eugene Shoemaker , an astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Ariz. , and one of the discoverers of the comet . &quot; It ' s a big wallop. &quot; Astronomers watching the fireworks through the largest optical_telescope in the world -- the W.M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii -- said the unusual flare was so bright that it overwhelmed the instrument ' s infrared sensors , briefly preventing them from recording the impact . &quot; We saw a truly remarkable large plume , &quot; said astronomer Imke de Pater , a principal_investigator on the Keck Telescope from UC Berkeley . &quot; It completely saturated the telescope. &quot; Viewed by the space telescope through an ultraviolet filter , which can reveal detail not normally visible , the impact site is as large as Jupiter ' s giant Red Spot -- twice as large as Earth . In the boil of debris and gases rising from the impacts , unusual chemicals never before observed on Jupiter are being detected by Earth-based astronomers . &quot; They are seeing emissions they have never seen before because they are seeing conditions we have never seen before , &quot; said University of Michigan scientist John Clarke , who is monitoring Jupiter ' s aurora for blast effects . Jupiter , which has more_than 300 times the mass of Earth , is not expected to suffer any long-term damage from the comet . Jupiter is 480 million miles from Earth , too far for the comet to have any influence here , scientists said . All of the comet fragments are landing on Jupiter ' s night side , which faces away from Earth . But the planet rotates so quickly , and the fireballs are rising so high above Jupiter ' s clouds , that the impact sites quickly swing into view of observers on Earth . The bombardment , which is expected to continue through early Friday , has created enormous public interest , stirring superstitious dread and scientific curiosity in equal measure . It is the first time anyone has been able to watch -- even indirectly -- as a comet hits a planet . So_much electronic_mail concerning observations of Jupiter has been generated by amateur and professional astronomers this week that computer traffic has achieved gridlock at key astronomy interchanges . At the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory , which is maintaining an on-line archive of the comet images and related astronomical data , 45 # 000 computer users had signed_on to the system by lunchtime Monday . Even senior astronomers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ' s Goddard center were having trouble getting access to the latest electronic bulletins from around the world . The spectacle on Jupiter is stirring new misgivings about Earth ' s vulnerability to celestial impacts . An object the size of Fragment G can be expected to hit Earth every few hundred_thousand years , scientists say , and there are 150 known impact craters on the planet . About 1 # 000 known objects of this size or larger are in orbits that periodically cross Earth ' s path ; none is_on a collision course with Earth , scientists said . As powerful as Monday ' s impact appeared to observers here , its force was only a fraction of that generated by celestial objects believed to have struck Earth millions of years ago . The 10-mile-wide Chicxulub crater , recently discovered in Mexico ' s Yucatan , is believed by some scientists to be the imprint of a comet or asteroid responsible_for the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago . The object that caused the crater , Shoemaker said Monday , probably was three times larger and 27 times as powerful as the piece of comet debris that kicked_up so_much fire Monday on Jupiter . &quot; This was not a dinosaur killer , &quot; Shoemaker said of the impact . * Times Link : 808-8463 To hear the July 20 , 1969 lunar landing and related features , call TimesLink and press * 6666 Crash Course A two-mile-wide comet fragment hit Jupiter on Monday in the largest planetary blast ever observed . But the bombardment , occurring 480 million miles from Earth , will not affect conditions here . Here ' s a look_at the impact of Fragment G . Facts and Figures : * Fragment G : One of 21 fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 hitting Jupiter this week . * Impact : If it fell here , the crater would cover much of Southern California . * Area : Its impact zone is 9 # 600 miles wide * Height : The plume is 1 # 300 miles high * Heat : 53 # 000 degrees Fahrenheit * Force : An estimated 6 million megatons of TNT .</TEXT>
