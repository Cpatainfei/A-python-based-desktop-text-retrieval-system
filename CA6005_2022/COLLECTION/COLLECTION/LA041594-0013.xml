   <HEADLINE> HOME TECH / CD CORNER : ' EDITH PIAF ' : LOVELY IN ANY LANGUAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Edith Piaf had just one Top 40 U.S. pop hit -- an English version of the classic &quot; La Vie En Rose &quot; in 1950 -- but she is one of the most celebrated vocalists of the modern pop era . Cited as an influence by artists as varied as David Bowie and Linda Ronstadt , Piaf combined a cabaret brightness , a blues soulfulness and a pop accessibility . Her distinctive and affecting style is showcased in &quot; Edith Piaf : 30th Anniversaire , &quot; a two-disc set from Capitol Records marking the 30th anniversary of her death . Though most of the album is sung in Piaf ' s native French , the celebration and the occasional melancholic touches in her music easily transcend language_barriers . Besides , a_few of the songs on the album should be well-known to older pop fans in the United States through hit English versions by other artists . Among them : &quot; Les Trois Cloches &quot; ( a U.S. hit in 1952 when retitled &quot; Three Bells &quot; and sung by Les Compagnons De La Chanson , who accompanied Piaf on the_French version of the song ) and &quot; La Goualante Du Pauvre Jean &quot; ( a 1956 hit when retitled &quot; The Poor People of Paris &quot; and performed by the Les Baxter Orchestra ) . Piaf ' s own story is almost as remarkable as her musical legacy -- though it is hard to find two accounts that agree in every detail . As generally agreed , Piaf -- whose real name was Edith Giovanna Gassion -- was born in a working-class district of Paris in 1915 . Her mother was believed to have been an Italian cafe singer and her father has been described variously as a circus acrobat and a traveling showman . Abandoned by her mother , the infant was placed by her father in the care of a madam of a cheap Normandy brothel , according to the liner notes in the Capitol set . She rejoined her father around the age of 7 and accompanied him on his circus travels , during which period he reportedly encouraged her to begin singing . Louis Lepee , the owner of a cabaret , later hired her as a performer . He was apparently the one who suggested the singer change her surname to the_French word for sparrow . She landed a recording contract and soon became one of the most popular entertainers in all_of Europe . She died in 1963 .</TEXT>
