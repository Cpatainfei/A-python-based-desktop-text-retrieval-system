   <TEXT> I am a survivor of Hitler ' s hell . I sat and watched the Oscars and tears ran_down my face thinking_of the millions who did not survive to see the winner for best picture.In my mind ' s eye I see another picture . I see my parents , my relatives , my 12-year-old brother -- all_of them gasping for air in Hitler ' s gas_chambers . Nobody helped the Jews then . The skinheads are not a fad . Do not ignore it , world . I was in Europe when it started the same way . Hitler Jugend , they called themselves . The world ignored that insane German leader . World , don ' t let history repeat . Thank_you , Steven Spielberg , for &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; and for showing it to the world that does not believe . ROSE FUTTER Los Angeles Occasionally , just every now and then , Hollywood genuinely stimulates its theatergoing public into contemplating real-life issues . Poignant testimonials such_as &quot; Philadelphia &quot; and &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; compel us to re-examine those belief systems that perpetuate what poet Robert Burns called &quot; man ' s inhumanity to man. &quot; In the process we confront our personal demons and learn something about ourselves . Is such painful self-scrutiny really necessary ? You bet . In the same Times issue that quotes Tom Hanks ' eloquent eulogy of AIDS victims runs a story of an uninformed emergency medical technician , who allegedly refused to place an ailing man on a stretcher because the patient confessed to taking AZT . &quot; Oh my God , he has AIDS , &quot; the EMT is quoted as saying . Surely the ignorant health-care professional works in Smallsville , USA , you say , where such behavior is not unusual . Guess again . Smallsville ' s name -- the City_of_Brotherly_Love , Philadelphia . I wonder if he has seen the movie ? RONALD D . LITTLE II Laguna BeachSteven Spielberg ; ROMAN GENN / For The Times</TEXT>
