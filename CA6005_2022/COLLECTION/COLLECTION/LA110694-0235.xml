   <HEADLINE> BOTH SIDES AIR ADS ON PROP . 187</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Both sides of the Proposition 187 debate have been running ad_campaigns about the initiative , which would bar illegal immigrants from receiving public_school education , non-emergency health_care and social_services . Taxpayers Against 187 is running a 30-second TV spot . Two independent groups that support Proposition 187 -- the Washington , D.C.-based Federation for American Immigration Reform , and the Orange County-based California Coalition for Immigration Reform -- are running 60-second radio ads . * THE AD &quot; AGAINST &quot; : As a lengthy list of public officials and organizations opposing Proposition 187 streams by on the TV screen , a narrator states that the measure would result in a crime increase because it would lead to 300 # 000 youngsters being kicked &quot; out of school and onto the street. &quot; It goes_on to say that the measure also does &quot; nothing to beef_up enforcement at our borders &quot; and would cost California $ 15 billion . The ad concludes with a visual of newspaper_headlines that refer to &quot; ties &quot; between Proposition 187 and a white_supremacist group . * THE ANALYSIS : Law_enforcement officials including Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and Los Angeles Police_Chief Willie L . Williams say that Proposition 187 could lead to increased crime problems . A nonpartisan state legislative analyst ' s report has stated that about $ 15 billion annually in federal funds for health , social_service and educational_programs would be placed at risk by Proposition 187 because it would breach federal confidentiality requirements . The ad does not make clear that the loss of funds is only a possibility . The supremacist headlines refer to allegations made by Taxpayers Against 187 concerning a link between measure co-author Alan Nelson , the Federation for American Immigration Reform ( known as FAIR ) and the New York-based Pioneer Fund , which has sponsored research by scientists who have held that blacks are inherently intellectually inferior to whites . That link , however , is decidedly tenuous . When Nelson helped write Proposition 187 , he was working as a lobbyist for FAIR , which receives an annual contribution from the Pioneer Fund . * THE ADS &quot; FOR &quot; : The FAIR ad blasts the campaign tactics of Taxpayers Against 187 , which is run_by Woodward &amp; McDowell , a Burlingame-based professional political consulting_firm . &quot; Taxpayers Against 187 is really a slick Bay Area p.r. firm hired by government employees and other special_interests and what they want from you , the real taxpayer , is an open-ended commitment to pay_for services that like a magnet attract a never-ending flow of illegal immigrants to our state , &quot; the ad states . The ad by the California Coalition for Immigration Reform rebuts charges that the measure would turn teachers and doctors into immigration agents and that white_supremacists are affiliated with the measure . &quot; The loss of $ 15 billion in federal funds is a scare tactic , nothing more , &quot; the ad says , according to a script read to The Times . * THE ANALYSIS : Taxpayers Against 187 , a coalition of education , health and law_enforcement organizations opposed to the measure , is operated_on a day-to-day basis by Woodward &amp; McDowell . But evidence is mixed concerning whether educational , health and social_services -- which are already limited for undocumented immigrants -- drive people to immigrate illegally . According to many experts , jobs are the leading factor . Proposition 187 does not specifically call_for teachers or doctors to check on the immigration status of students and patients . But the measure does require a check of residency status before people can go_to school or be treated in virtually all hospitals and health clinics . Those reasonably suspected of being illegal immigrants would be reported to state and federal authorities .</TEXT>
