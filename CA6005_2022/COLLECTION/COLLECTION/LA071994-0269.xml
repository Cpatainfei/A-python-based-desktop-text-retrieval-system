   <HEADLINE> THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY ; DEFENSE MUDDYING IS MEDIA-SAVVY PLOY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The mud hit the fan in time for Monday ' s news and talk_shows . With one lightning strike , O.J. Simpson ' s team tried to spin their defense onto a new course with stories in the New Yorker and Newsweek that the accused killer was framed by a rogue police_detective with a history of racism and a desire to be the hero of the case . When I talk_about mud , I don ' t mean to imply that the defense ' s tactics were dirty , although I was always taught that making an unsubstantiated allegation , such_as Simpson being framed , isn ' t exactly clean . Rather , I chose the word for the impact that the charge will have . The maneuver was like tossing a boulder into the unfathomable pool of public_opinion . When the rock hits bottom , mud and sand rise , clouding the water . * I called a political consultant for advice because the latest maneuver in the Simpson media wars has little to do with the law . Rather , it ' s like the closing days of a dirty political_campaign , complete with smears and leaks . My source was Arnie Steinberg , a respected pollster who has been a strategist for Mayor Richard Riordan and many other candidates . Steinberg is_better qualified than most to talk_about spinning a criminal case . In 1986 , he found himself being investigated by Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Ira Reiner , who had filed charges against his client , Bobbi Fiedler , a San Fernando Valley congresswoman running_for U.S. Senate , and her political aide , Paul Clarke . The investigation ended when a judge threw_out the charges . Fiedler and Clarke had been indicted on charges of offering a $ 100 # 000 campaign contribution to lure an opponent out of the race . As a Fiedler strategist , Steinberg was worried about the investigation , a concern heightened when he realized he was being tailed by the D.A. ' s detectives . After charges against Fiedler and Clarke were dismissed , the tail was dropped , but memories of that experience remain with him . As it is with the Simpson case , shaping public_opinion was important in fighting the D.A. ' s attack . So in talking to Steinberg , I was more or less getting the view from the inside . Their strategy was to get the case , which was weak , dropped before the trial . Steinberg said his brother , defense_attorney Herb Steinberg , advised him that &quot; we have to create a media environment in which a judge , if he were to grant this motion ( to dismiss ) , would not be attacked by the newspapers for letting a bunch of crooked politicians off. &quot; &quot; It was my brother ' s feeling that the judge does watch television , does read the newspapers , &quot; Steinberg said . Defense_attorney Harland W . Braun , a pioneer in criminal defense news management , was brought into the defense_team to provide a steady flow of tips , hints , analysis and leaks to reporters , whom he persistently cultivated . Media-sharp defense_attorneys Roger Diamond and Howard Weitzman , who was Simpson ' s initial attorney , volunteered advice . The goal , Steinberg said , was to &quot; provide a media environment &quot; friendly to the defendants . A crucial event was a news_conference at the Sportsman ' s Lodge_in Studio City . The defense had gained access to 20 hours of conversations taped by D.A. investigators . These were supposed to really nail Fiedler and Clarke . &quot; We scheduled a daylong press_conference , &quot; Steinberg said . &quot; We played all_the tapes , no holds barred . It was like a marathon thing. &quot; In the end , he said , the press went_away bored and unimpressed with the D.A. ' s evidence . * Steinberg figures that with the money at the defense ' s disposal , the Simpson lawyers have done public_opinion surveys to determine how the community is reacting . As is the case with a political_campaign , the polling is probably helping shape strategy . If that ' s true , then making_sure the story appears in Newsweek and the New Yorker makes perfect sense , an elegantly timed ploy , coming_out six days before Simpson appears in court , hot enough to make two national publications . By Monday morning , the talk_shows had chimed_in and this morning you ' re reading more details in this paper . What ' s the impact ? First of all , it influences the potential jurors , a subject I ' ve written_about before . It muddies the waters and may fuel the suspicions of minority jurors who already are skeptical of police . The defense could be doing what the Fiedler-Clarke team did back in 1986 , creating a friendly media environment . In this case , the goal would be to cast more doubt on the prosecution ' s evidence . Enough doubt , enough muddying of the water , and the press and public might not protest much if Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti makes a plea bargain deal in the event the Simpson team decides to abandon its innocence defense . A final word . Los Angeles Police Detective Mark Fuhrman ' s past was exposed to the public along with a theory -- no better than saloon speculation -- that he framed Simpson . He told Newsweek that his career is pretty well shot , and knowing the bureaucratic LAPD , he may be right .</TEXT>
