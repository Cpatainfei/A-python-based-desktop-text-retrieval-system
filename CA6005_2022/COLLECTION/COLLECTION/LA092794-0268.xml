   <TEXT> Latin_American countries that once nationalized U.S.-owned businesses are now pushing for more U.S. investment and commerce . They can ' t wait to follow Mexico ' s footsteps into a free-trade agreement with yesterday ' s &quot; Yankee imperialists. &quot; And U.S. companies are rushing south . The Americas are coming_together , melding -- and not just economically . Although Washington has often been the hemisphere ' s hated bully in the past , its affinity with Latin_America today is flowering . &quot; As the number of Latin_American migrants and refugees in the United States increases , and as the reach of telecommunications becomes broader , we ' re really becoming knit together , &quot; said Mark Rosenberg , a Latin_America specialist at Florida International University in Miami . &quot; So you have at one level a governmental interest , and at another level you have a social fabric that is getting knit even more closely together . &quot; There ' s just a whole set of influences that are growing , &quot; Rosenberg added . &quot; There ' s a whole set of things that are taking_place now that I think are positive in terms of greater harmony in the hemisphere. &quot; Mexico , historically wary of American arrogance and dominance , has embraced the United States as a brother ; the struggling nations of Central_America , more peaceful and more democratic since the turbulent 1980s , no longer are a major source of U.S. heartburn and headaches , and on the vast continent of South_America , elected governments from Colombia to Argentina actively seek a future of profitable inter-American unity . For decades , both Central and South_America seemed to rumble and shake with political conflict : revolutions , guerrilla wars , coups and countercoups . Widespread poverty deepened with the foreign debt crisis of the 1980s . Today , poverty remains worrisome , while residues of extremism and militarism also persist_in some countries . But political and ideological differences between America and Latin_America have dramatically narrowed with the endorsement by nearly all Latin_American governments of democratic forms and free-market reforms . Meanwhile , millions of Americans are learning Spanish , and English-language schools are booming from Mexico to Argentina . Increasingly easier international communications and travel further strengthen hemispherical ties . More and more Latin_Americans watch CNN , ESPN and MTV as cable_television and dish_antennas multiply throughout the region . In the United States , growing communities of Latinos tune_in on Spanish-language radio_stations and television networks that carry programming from their homelands . Even food tastes are mixing and merging . An appetite for tacos and burritos has spread through the United States ; in Latin_America , cheeseburgers and Southern fried chicken have become popular fare . Many Latin_Americans still fear Yankee imperialism , whether economic , political , cultural or culinary . And some worry about the sovereignty of their countries when the Colossus of the North wields its &quot; coercive diplomacy , &quot; as it did this month in Haiti . But all_in all , as the century nears its close , the United States and Latin_America are drawing closer than they have been since the century began . There has &quot; never been a better time &quot; for inter-American cooperation , said Paul Boeker , head of the La Jolla-based Institute of the Americas . &quot; It really is a golden era historically in terms of convergence of not only political and economic_values , but practical approaches to how you generate growth and social progress. &quot; Democracy has become a common_denominator between the United States and Latin_America since the pendulum of power began swinging away from the widespread military rule of the 1970s . In contrast to earlier periods , elected governments reign in all but one of the region ' s 18 Spanish-speaking countries as well as Portuguese-speaking Brazil . Communist Cuba is the exception . Only in Cuba does an entrenched Latin_American government now stridently reject the basic political and economic principles of the United States . In recent regional summit_meetings , other Latin_American leaders have repeatedly urged Cuban President Fidel Castro to make democratic and market reforms . Outside Cuba , the region ' s civilian governments are harmonizing their economic programs to favor free_enterprise and open trade . This is music to the ears of Washington , which has long encouraged Latin_America ' s departure from policies of state enterprise and protectionism . Free-trade alliances are developing vigorously in several areas of the region , and economic ties with the United States are growing stronger by the year . U.S. exports to Latin_America , for example , grew by 64 % between 1989 and 1993 . &quot; These are historic developments , &quot; Boeker said . &quot; Not everyone in the U.S. Congress has absorbed this yet , but U.S. trade and investment with Latin_America is growing faster than with anywhere else in the world. &quot; The end of the Cold_War , the decline of militarism and growing political stability have helped take the edge off of traditional Latin_American nationalism and anti-Americanism . Many leftist parties in the region have become more centrist . At the same time , anti-communism and great-power rivalry no longer color Washington ' s view of Latin_America , observed Manuel Antonio Garreton , a professor of social_sciences at the University of Chile . Until the Soviet Bloc dissolved , he noted , &quot; Latin_America was just a place of competition with the Soviet Union. &quot; Now Washington has other priorities in the region . &quot; That means approaches can be made in terms of conveniences , interests , aspirations -- without prior ideological definition , &quot; the Chilean scholar said . During most of the 1980s , U.S. interest in the hemisphere focused_on what Washington depicted as a grave Marxist threat in Central_America . Washington lavished military and development aid on the area , often intervening in political affairs of El_Salvador , Nicaragua and Honduras . As peace came_to Central_America , Washington quietly backed_away . Official relations now are more distant -- but also less intrusive and more likely to focus_on trade and investment that can lead to more solid and fruitful economic ties . In the late 1980s , U.S. concerns segued from the waning menace of communism to the waxing threat of cocaine . As a result , Washington has dedicated billions of dollars and the time of hundreds of officials to anti-drug cooperation with Latin_American authorities . Those efforts so far have failed to curtail the flow of cocaine from the region into the United States , but they have taught the lesson that more effective inter-American cooperation is needed . Drug trafficking by Panama ' s Gen . Manuel A . Noriega was given as a major reason for U.S. military intervention in that country in December , 1989 , an invasion that recalled numerous previous episodes of U.S. intervention , political meddling and heavy-handed pressure in Latin_America throughout this century . Traditionally , they have fed anti-Yankee sentiments . The current intervention in Haiti may be different . With its French-Creole culture and its almost uninterrupted history of despotism , Haiti is a singular case in the hemisphere . Also , the nature of U.S. intervention has changed . Earlier in the century , U.S. action often favored American investors , right-wing elites and dictators . In both Panama and Haiti , the action was aimed at ending military dominance and supporting democratic government . The Clinton_Administration ' s policy toward Latin_America has no catchy title similar to the forgotten Good Neighbors Policy of President Franklin D . Roosevelt , the forsaken Alliance for Progress envisioned by John F . Kennedy or the short-lived Enterprise for the Americas pushed by George_Bush . Still , President Clinton has followed_through on Bush policy , which emphasized free_trade and private investment , and also on Jimmy_Carter ' s policy of actively promoting democracy and human_rights . With his military move_into Haiti , however , Clinton has put a tougher edge on the policy than Carter did . Despite events in Haiti , Latin_American authorities today seem less interested in old issues of imperialism and sovereignty than in trade and investment . The United States accounts_for about 60 % of all goods imported by Latin_America and the Caribbean , a region with a growing population of 460 million . Total trade between the United States and Latin_America was worth $ 141 billion in 1993 . &quot; What Latin_Americans feel will put things on the kitchen_table is economic_growth , &quot; said Peter Cleaves , director of the Institute for Latin_American Studies at the University of Texas . With some exceptions , Cleaves said , &quot; there is a consensus throughout the region that the bread , if it ' s going_to be buttered , will be buttered through the relationship with the United States. &quot; Clinton has invited Latin_American and Caribbean leaders to a hemispherical summit Dec . 9 and 10 in Miami . The agenda will include efforts of many kinds to strengthen inter-American relations , and trade is expected to be one of the key items . Both the Clinton_Administration and the Bush_Administration before it have endorsed the ideal of a hemispherical free-trade zone . The concept is attractive to Latin_American countries that fear being left_out as Asia , Europe and North_America form powerful trade blocs that could dominate world commerce . Former President Cesar Gaviria of Colombia , now secretary_general of the Organization of American_States , has said a hemispherical free-trade zone is one of his major goals . &quot; The hemisphere must become sooner rather than later an economic force , &quot; Gaviria said . Other advocates agree that it would make_sense to add all_of Latin_America to the North_American Free_Trade Agreement linking the United States , Mexico and Canada . That will not be easy . Latin_America has a long history of unsuccessful attempts at economic integration . Common_markets can ' t work if their would-be members have incompatible governments , unstable economies and contradictory economic_policies , as_many Latin_American countries did_in past decades . Protectionism and nationalism also have helped foil earlier attempts at free_trade in the region . Although those obstacles have been reduced substantially , there is no guarantee that they will not rise again . On the U.S. side , labor_leaders and environmentalists are dragging their feet . Unions worry that with free_trade , low-wage workers in Latin_America could siphon_off American jobs and undermine U.S. pay standards . Environmentalists voice concerns about trade pacts with Latin_American countries where protections are lax . Some free-trade advocates say the influence of labor and environmentalists in the Democratic Party has cooled the Clinton_Administration ' s enthusiasm for expanding NAFTA . Earlier this month , the Administration withdrew a bill from Congress that would have authorized &quot; fast-track &quot; procedures for negotiating free-trade agreements with other countries . Finance_Minister Eduardo Aninat of Chile , the leading Latin_American advocate for a NAFTA-like trade pact , called withdrawal of the fast-track bill &quot; an unnecessary delay that does not satisfy our expectations. &quot; J . Michael Combes , manager of an American-owned company in Chile and former president of the Chilean-American Chamber_of_Commerce , warned that such hitches in_progress toward hemispherical free_trade could cool North-South relations . &quot; This fast track looked positive , and now it ' s being put_back , and eventually the countries will get frustrated , &quot; Combes complained in an interview . &quot; If something doesn ' t happen fairly soon , you ' re going to get , I think , a very severe cooling down , and then possibly some resentment . &quot; I think that would be a great shame , I mean a great shame for the U.S. , &quot; he said . &quot; This is becoming a dynamic continent . Things are really happening. &quot; In the 1980s , most of Latin_America suffered through an economic slump , with high inflation and unmanageable foreign debt . The crisis has passed , inflation is under_control , and the regional economy is growing at a moderate rate . Trade is expanding , and foreign investment is pouring into many countries , more_than half of it from the United States . To a great degree , Latin_American countries have abandoned old policies of protectionism and &quot; import substitution , &quot; which shielded national industries from the foreign-import competition . One problem with import substitution was that protected industries often became comfortable and fat , producing inferior goods at inflated costs . Now , market policies are opening Latin_American economies to foreign goods . That helps keep prices down and forces national industries to compete or wither . &quot; It ' s not only the Latin_Americans trying to accede_to the U.S. market , but Latin_America has become a very important market for the U.S. , and I think the economic interdependence that can be developed over the next few years is to everybody ' s benefit , &quot; said Guatemalan economist Gert Rosenthal . Rosenthal said the trend in Latin_America should encourage efforts to create a hemispherical trade bloc . &quot; What ' s going_to happen probably is that we ' re going to have four or five sub-regional trading blocs within Latin_America , which will tend to converge. &quot; Eventually , they could converge with NAFTA . Judging by figures since liberalization of U.S.-Mexican trade began under NAFTA Jan . 1 , both sides can profit . U.S. exports to Mexico in the second quarter of this year expanded by a robust 17 % over the same period last year , while Mexico ' s exports to the United States grew by 19 % . Meanwhile , communications , which goes hand in_hand with trade , has become a unifying force in the Americas . Plans are being discussed to link the hemisphere with an information superhighway of fiber-optics . Satellite communications have already brought what Rosenberg , the Florida educator , calls the &quot; CNN-ization of hemispheric information. &quot; With more communications , distorted stereotypes tend to break_down . On one hand , Latin_Americans find it more difficult to view Americans as arrogant , dollar-crazed imperialists . And Americans learn that there is much more to Latin_America than poverty , guerrillas , cocaine smuggling and heavy-handed generals . Great political , economic and cultural differences between the United States and Latin_America remain undeniably real . But just as real are today ' s opportunities for bridging the gaps between these lands and peoples who already are connected by history and geography . Nowhere is the opportunity more obvious than in Miami , the Southwest and Southern California -- the frontiers between Anglo and Latino America . Greater Miami ' s population is almost equally divided between Latinos and non-Latinos , and both have prospered as their ways_of_life have blended . The U.S.-Mexican border is becoming more a transit area and &quot; zone of economic development and opportunity &quot; than a boundary , Rosenberg observed . &quot; And that ' s what is going_to happen with a lot of boundaries in Latin_America , &quot; he said . &quot; What ' s going_on on the Texas-Mexican border is a harbinger of things to come_in Latin America. &quot; Hemispherical Immigration to the U.S. 1993 Immigrants ( Legal ) From Mexico : 126 # 561 From Central_America : 55 # 797 From the Caribbean : 97 # 843 From South_America : 53 # 036 The 10 Latin_American countries with most emigres to the U.S. : Mexico : 126 # 517 Dominican_Republic : 44 # 886 El_Salvador : 25 # 517 Jamaica : 16 # 969 Cuba : 13 # 650 Colombia : 12 # 512 Guatemala : 11 # 269 Peru : 10 # 276 Haiti : 9 # 596 Guyana : 8 # 337 Top 10 receiving states : 1 .
