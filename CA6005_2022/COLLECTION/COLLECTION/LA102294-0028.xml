   <HEADLINE> PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M . KRISTOF : CHIT CHAT ; PREPAID PHONE CARDS EXPECTED TO TAKE OFF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Only a tiny fraction of the American public knows what they are , but telephone industry insiders are hitching their wagons to prepaid phone cards -- a business that could easily exceed $ 1 billion annually by 1996 . Since the beginning of the year , the debit cards for long-distance_calls have been launched by the millions . Issuers range from the big names in long-distance to banks and entertainment companies . And although using prepaid cards for calls has long been common in other countries , the business is in its infancy here . &quot; I am convinced that every grocery_store , convenience_store and gas_station will be selling prepaid calling_cards within the next 12 months , &quot; says Terry Macko , director of Phone Cash marketing at MCI . &quot; They are taking_off as an entirely new retail category. &quot; What are prepaid phone cards ? They ' re pieces of plastic that bear an 800 number and a personal identification_number . By dialing the toll-free number and punching in your PIN , you can gain access to an &quot; account &quot; that entitles you to a set number of minutes of phone time . The amount_of_time you get -- and the price of the calls -- is set when you buy the card . The expiration of the time allotment varies by company : Some expire after several months , a year or not at all . Some phone card companies also offer additional services -- payable from your account -- that range from faxes to phone sex . With technological advances and growing competition , the cards ' promoters see advantages for everyone . The phone_companies like prepaid accounts because they don ' t have to send you a bill or worry that you won ' t pay . Non-phone companies can use them as advertising vehicles . For a_few dollars a card , you can provide someone with a collectible bit of plastic that will deliver an advertising message every time it ' s used or looked_at . Some users of long-distance services will like them because they ' re sometimes cheaper than calling collect or using a phone credit_card . Collectors like them because some are attractive , and the rarer cards can appreciate in value . One of the first cards ever issued in the United States -- a promotional giveaway with $ 1 in phone time -- recently sold for $ 1 # 700 . * Generally , using the card accounts can be a bargain for people making short phone_calls away from home -- assuming they ' d otherwise call collect or use a calling card . that ' s because fees are minimal . But on longer calls , the prepaid calls often cost more . And calling direct from home will usually be cheaper . But experts are beginning to voice concerns about the industry , which is largely unregulated . Some worry about con_artists selling worthless card accounts , and they note that children can use them to get_around &quot; phone blocking &quot; and other restrictions . Moreover , because the cards can be purchased at supermarkets like lottery tickets or bread , buyers are largely anonymous . That could make the cards a convenient vehicle for criminals and other people -- such_as unfaithful spouses -- who want to keep conversation records off their phone_bills . &quot; It ' s the vast new frontier , &quot; says Barbara Esbin , assistant chief of the tariff division at the Federal Communications Commission , who spoke at a summer conference on prepaid cards . &quot; As I looked_out_over the audience in June , it ranged from the Bell-heads to people you would expect to see selling watches on 42nd Street -- and everybody in between. &quot; Of particular concern to regulators is fraud . Because consumers are buying calling time in_advance , they are out of luck if the company disbands while they still have time in their accounts . &quot; There is a legitimate need and market for these cards , but at_the_same_time there is a whole_lot of opportunity for consumers to get hurt , &quot; says Ron Choura , deputy director of policy at the Michigan Public_Service Commission . Even among legitimate issuers there are wide variations in the price and services provided , which could confuse consumers trying to figure_out if the card accounts are a bargain or a bust . The National Assn . of Regulatory Utility Commissioners has suggested uniform disclosure of rates and conditions , but these rules are not enforceable , notes Choura , an author of the report . Meanwhile , the prepaid phone card industry is booming . Virtually all major phone_companies have issued cards in the past nine months . Pacific Bell , for example , has just launched three -- one pictures Olvera Street and another is a Los Angeles collage . Meanwhile , a dizzying array of telephone time resellers , who buy long-distance time in bulk and then resell it to consumers , are selling prepaid phone cards through banks , communications companies and even travel_agencies . The distributor gets a commission , publicity or some free_time to distribute to loyal customers . When &quot; The Princess and the Goblin , &quot; an animated children ' s movie , went_to video , for example , it included a trailer selling Los Angeles-based Hemdale Telecommunications ' &quot; Magic Phone Card &quot; -- a prepaid card for the preschool set . An Escondido , Calif. , company called Global Communications recently started marketing a &quot; TravelCall Card &quot; for travel_agents to sell to their clients . Some cards offer discounted time in exchange for listening to an advertising pitch ; others are bonuses for attending a meeting or buying a product . Cards that become collectors items can be especially profitable to the issuers because the phone time on them may have expired unused . That time remains on the issuer ' s books . As a way to buy phone time , prepaid card accounts may be particularly useful for parents to give college_students or for anyone without their own phone_service . With a prepaid card , you limit your spending and can buy calling time for as little as 25 cents a minute . While that ' s no bargain for local_calls -- or for after-hours long-distance -- it often beats collect-calling rates by a mile . Prepaid calling cards are not new . They ' ve been used in Europe and Asia for decades . But in other countries , the account is often in the card itself , either in a chip or on a magnetic strip . In roughly 170 countries , the cards have evolved to serve the function phone credit_cards serve in the United States . International collectors have long traded and sold them like baseball_cards , coins and stamps . * In the United States , however , users of prepaid phone accounts generally must use the 800 and PIN number_system . When you run_low on_time , you can &quot; recharge &quot; the card by punching in a credit_card number or buying a new card . Because the products are unfamiliar to U.S. consumers , many fear they will become disenchanted when they find that the cards cost more_than they thought . And , as with any industry that sprouts overnight , there ' s the risk that card companies will fail , leaving customers with worthless pieces of plastic . &quot; In a sense , it is how a competitive industry develops , &quot; says Audrie Krause , executive_director of Toward Utility Rate Normalization , a consumer watchdog group . &quot; People begin business and they go_out of business when they ' re not successful . But from a consumer standpoint , it ' s a problem . There is certainly a lot of potential for customers to get ripped off. &quot;</TEXT>
