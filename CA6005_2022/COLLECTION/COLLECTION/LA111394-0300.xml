   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; WILSON LIKELY TO FOLLOW 1ST TERM -- ONLY MORE SO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pete Wilson ' s second term as governor figures to be just like his first , only more so . More welfare cuts . More criminal justice reform . More business tax_breaks . More struggling to balance the budget . And perhaps more_than just tinkering with the state ' s massive system of public education . Wilson often has said he left the U.S. Senate to run_for governor in 1990 because he thought he could make changes . Now , with a sweeping reelection victory behind him and his party poised to seize control of the state Assembly for the first time in a generation , the governor may have the chance to make_good on some of the plans that eluded him during his first four years . Wilson made few explicit promises in the 1994 campaign , and he declined a request for an interview with The Times after the election to preview his agenda . But a look_back at the campaign and a review of the proposals Wilson has advanced since he took_office in 1991 provide some solid hints of how a second Wilson term might look . &quot; What we intend is that there be a California of unparalleled opportunity and much greater personal responsibility , &quot; Wilson said the morning after the election , in which he defeated Democrat Kathleen Brown by a 55 % to 40 % margin . To increase opportunity , Wilson wants to cut taxes on business and perhaps on individuals . He wants to make schools more accountable and give parents more power to choose among public_schools for their children . And he wants to streamline the state ' s many job training_programs to make them better serve those who need help entering , or re-entering , the labor_force . On the responsibility side of the ledger , Wilson will seek to expand the death_penalty , further lengthen some criminal sentences and try to require all violent felons to serve 100 % of their terms . He is all but certain to revive his proposal to remove poor families from the welfare rolls after two years , or perhaps less , if the head_of_household is able-bodied but not working . And he will work to implement Proposition 187 , the ballot initiative that denies most public_services to illegal immigrants . Less clear is to what extent Wilson will respond to the groundswell across the country and in California for paring back the role of the state in people ' s lives . Wilson , after all , has made his career in government , and during his first term he showed little inclination to slash it . He signed bills injecting more government , not less , into the affairs of individuals , including legislation requiring motorcyclists and young bicyclists to wear helmets , children to wear life_vests while boating , and employers to ban smoking in their workplaces . Although Wilson often boasted of eliminating more_than 100 boards and commissions , most of the panelists were unpaid , met rarely and had the power only to advise . He resisted bipartisan efforts to eliminate entire departments or functions of state_government -- such_as the fire_marshal -- that some lawmakers said were duplicative of local or federal programs . And Wilson ' s interest in privatizing government has been limited to the highway department -- Caltrans -- where his Administration has favored the use of private engineers to design freeways . He has not joined those who offered more radical ideas such_as farming_out the job of the Department of Motor_Vehicles to private entrepreneurs . Republican strategist Steven Merksamer said Wilson would do_well to undertake a comprehensive examination of everything the state_government does . Ironically , Democrat Brown made the same idea -- she called it a &quot; performance review &quot; -- a key part of her campaign . In a second Wilson term , Merksamer said , &quot; the question has to be asked , for every state agency and department in existence today , is there a rational basis for its continued existence or support ? That kind of review would be well-received by the public. &quot; Others wonder whether Wilson has any interest in dismantling much of the government he will be running . &quot; I think Wilson is a managerialist politician for the most part , &quot; said William Bradley , a Democratic political adviser and columnist who worked for Brown before parting company earlier this year . &quot; He doesn ' t strike me as a radical . He as governor has done little to downsize government or re-create it . that ' s not to say that he might not have a mid-life conversion here. &quot; After raising taxes by $ 7 billion in his first year in office , Wilson turned_around and opposed major tax_hikes in subsequent budgets . In 1993 , he managed to roll back the tax burden a bit by enacting credits for businesses that buy manufacturing equipment . Now he says he wants to do more . He may begin by trying again to win passage of tax cuts rejected by the Legislature this year , including a modest income_tax reduction for low-income families and a $ 1 # 000 tax_credit for each full-time job created by start-up businesses in California . These proposals , which would return roughly $ 150 million to the taxpayers , are dwarfed by the governor ' s insistence that the state allow the expiration of a temporary income_tax surcharge on individuals earning more_than $ 100 # 000 a year and couples with incomes higher than $ 200 # 000 a year . The higher tax_rates , adopted in 1991 , are scheduled to lapse at the end of 1995 -- at a cost to the state budget of nearly $ 1 billion . If Wilson is serious about tax cuts such_as these , he may have to entertain some of the ideas he was cool to in his first term . Even if reducing taxes stimulates the economy and provides more revenue to government -- as Wilson argues -- there is still likely to be a lag that worsens the short-term budget_deficit unless he also cuts spending . Recent statistics have shown that the economy is improving , and state tax receipts are climbing , too . But Wilson nevertheless will face a hole of roughly $ 2 billion when he delivers his next proposed budget on Jan . 10 . His hope of closing that gap by extracting money from Washington for the cost of serving illegal immigrants is not necessarily any closer to fruition with the election of a Republican Congress bent_on cutting federal spending . One way Wilson could cut the state budget would be to revive his proposal to transform the welfare program . Although the governor ' s plan was rejected by voters in 1992 , the Legislature later enacted parts of it and added ideas aimed at making_it easier for recipients to move from the welfare rolls to a private payroll . The state has cut basic welfare benefits 15 % since 1991 , but Wilson has said he would like to lower them further . Even more , he wants to sharply reduce benefits to anyone who has been_on the program for six months or more , and perhaps eliminate the monthly stipends altogether after two years . Other_than his welfare proposals , though , Wilson has advocated few major cuts_in government services . He has asked the Legislature to eliminate several services that are part of the Medi-Cal program for the poor , including dental_care for adults , podiatry , chiropractic care and acupuncture . But these services represent just a small part of the state ' s subsidized health_care program , and Wilson has said nothing to indicate that he would want to eliminate such big-ticket items as prescription_drugs or nursing_home care or restrict eligibility for the program . In the other major areas of government spending -- prisons and schools -- Wilson wants to spend more , not less . His prison budget is expected to soar with the implementation of the &quot; three strikes &quot; sentencing law . But another perhaps more expensive proposition has gotten much less attention : the idea of reducing or eliminating the credits for good behavior that have allowed prison inmates to cut their terms in half . Wilson won a partial victory on this front in 1994 , reducing to just 15 % the amount_of_time violent or serious felons can shave from their sentences . Next year , he said , he will try to wipe_out the credits altogether for violent felons . The governor also has taken something of a pledge not to cut the other big-ticket state_government item : education . After being portrayed early on as anti-education , Wilson has said he would not reduce funding below the current level of about $ 4 # 200 per pupil . As enrollments grow , fulfilling that promise will cost the state several hundred million dollars per year . Wilson might want to use those budget increases to extract policy_changes from the education Establishment , a task that may be easier now that the California Teachers Assn . has seen its Democratic partners lose power in the Assembly , where Speaker Willie Brown was a staunch ally . Wilson opposed the 1993 ballot measure that would have given parents taxpayer-paid vouchers to use in any public or private_schools . But Maureen DiMarco , Wilson ' s secretary for education and child development , said the governor probably will push for expanding the number of chartered public_schools , where teachers and parents create new programs free from almost all state regulation . The governor may also revive his interest in merit_pay for teachers and his desire to give local districts more leeway to spend money now restricted to various special programs , known as categoricals . Wilson said last week that he intends to pay &quot; a great_deal of attention &quot; to education . &quot; It is essential that our kids be in a position where in fact they are prepared_for the job market and prepared to be the kind of citizens that they really ought to be , &quot; Wilson said . The schools also will be the major battleground over the implementation of Proposition 187 , which the governor has pledged to defend with vigor . Wilson ' s aggressive attack on the federal_government over the issue was a turning point in his comeback from near political oblivion , and white voters supported him in droves Nov . 8 . Some say Wilson must now reach_out to Latinos , who vote_in small numbers today but are an increasingly large share of the state ' s population and may one day represent a larger portion of voters . Wilson won 35 % of the Latino vote_in 1990 but 22 % this year . &quot; He really has to make some peace with the Hispanic population , &quot; said Joel Kotkin , a fellow at the Center for the New West . &quot; If the Republicans don ' t staunch the hemorrhage of the Latino electorate , they are going_to pay_for it in the long run. &quot;</TEXT>
