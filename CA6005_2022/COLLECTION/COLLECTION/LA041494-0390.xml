   <HEADLINE> CAPITAL_GAINS ; IT ' S BUSINESS AS USUAL AT THE WHITE_HOUSE . IN THE BUSH_ADMINISTRATION , SEVERAL GENEROUS FRIENDS OF GEORGE AND THE GOP BECAME ENVOYS . NOW , SEVERAL FRIENDS OF BILL AND THE DEMOCRATS -- SOME WHO HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN THE FOREIGN-SERVICE ARENA -- ARE GETTING APPOINTED TO VERY PLUM POSTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Looking_for a spring break far away from Washington ' s cold March rains and the incessant drip of Whitewater , President Clinton picked the seaside California home of M . Larry Lawrence . A convenient vacancy had just freed up the 35-room mansion in the affluent community of Coronado , as Clinton well knew . Only a week earlier , Lawrence , owner of the Hotel del Coronado and a major contributor to and fund-raiser for the Democratic Party , had moved to Switzerland to take_up his new job as head of the U.S. Embassy there . After 12 years of complaining about Republican appointments , it ' s the Democrats ' turn_to pass_out high posts in pleasant places to contributors , friends of the First Family and others who provided timely support during the Clinton campaign . &quot; The spoils system is alive and well , &quot; a senior foreign service officer complained . &quot; The only difference between this Administration and the last is that the appointments are a bit less unqualified. &quot; Of 86 Clinton nominees confirmed in senior diplomatic posts as of March , more_than 40 % have come from outside the career foreign service , State_Department figures show . Many choices have been praised , including that of former presidential candidate and vice_president Walter F . Mondale . During his brief tenure as ambassador to Japan , he has helped resolve a nagging trade dispute over cellular_phones and soothed worries over gun violence that has claimed the lives of several Japanese students in the United States . The Washington Establishment also reacted favorably to the announcement March 22 that the diplomatic plum of plums -- ambassadorship to Britain -- would go_to retired Adm . William J . Crowe . Backing by the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff helped candidate Clinton fend_off attacks on his lack of military_service . &quot; It ' s a splendid choice . Crowe will make a real contribution , &quot; said F . Allen ( Tex ) Harris , president of the American Foreign Service Assn . Although every job given to a non-career ambassador takes one away from his membership , he said , &quot; Our primary concern is not so_much the ratio of career to political appointees as the ratio of qualified to unqualified appointees. &quot; In the latter category , Harris put Lawrence , whose nomination -- alone among Clinton choices -- was opposed by every major foreign-service organization . Critics say the San Diego hotel magnate , who with his family and business gave nearly $ 200 # 000 to the Democratic Party from 1987 to 1992 , has no foreign-policy experience . During his confirmation_hearings , he committed several gaffes , such_as calling Switzerland a U.S. ally even though the small European_country is practically a synonym for neutrality . &quot; I ' m afraid it ' s just not a good appointment , &quot; said Sen . Richard Lugar ( R-Ind. ) , a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , which , despite its Democratic majority , failed to approve the nomination . Lawrence passed the full Senate , however , after what foreign-service sources said was extraordinary arm-twisting by Republican as well as Democratic power_brokers . &quot; Four years ago when we objected strongly to a number of Bush nominees and it looked_like some might lose , pressure was applied by the Democrats , &quot; a retired foreign-service officer recalled . &quot; The Democrats said , ' We have our own fat cats so we can ' t afford to vote against these guys because the wheel is going_to turn some day. ' Four years later , history pretty much repeated itself. &quot; Reached in Switzerland by telephone , Lawrence said he had been unfairly targeted and was qualified for his job by virtue of his background in international banking , finance and development . &quot; Most people identify me with the Hotel del Coronado , but that only represents 20 % of my business , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ve had 56 companies doing business around the world , I ' ve negotiated in Mexico and represented Congress in loan negotiations with Israel . I ' ve been chairman of an economic advisory_board in California and done many things in government. &quot; Lawrence also said he had raised &quot; millions upon millions of dollars &quot; for the Democrats . He said he had been working for the party &quot; since I was walking precincts with my mother in Chicago &quot; and noted that he had been offered ambassadorships by Presidents Jimmy_Carter and Lyndon B . Johnson but turned them down . * Where Clinton ' s immediate predecessor , President Bush , nominated 11 campaign contributors of $ 100 # 000 or more to senior diplomatic posts , Clinton has so far named five . Besides Lawrence , they are : Ambassador to Austria Swanee Hunt , an oil heiress who with her family gave more_than $ 300 # 000 to the Democrats , according to the Federal Election_Commission ; Ambassador to the_Netherlands K . Terry Dornbush , an Atlanta investor and contributor of $ 250 # 000 ; Ambassador to Denmark Edward Elson , who gave $ 180 # 000 ; and Ambassador to France Pamela Harriman , the doyenne of Democratic fund-raisers , who gave $ 130 # 000 and raised millions more . Other bankrollers awarded ambassadorships are Alan Blinken , who gave nearly $ 50 # 000 , Belgium ; and Thomas Siebert , nearly $ 30 # 000 , Sweden . Lugar , one of the Senate ' s most respected foreign-affairs experts , also voted against Dornbush ; Siebert , a well-connected Washington lawyer ; and Sidney Williams , a Hollywood Mercedes-Benz dealer who is married to Rep . Maxine Waters ( D-Los Angeles ) and got the Bahamas . &quot; It appeared to me there were no conspicuous qualifications of any of the four for the countries for which they were nominated , &quot; Lugar said in an interview . He also expressed reservations about the still-unconfirmed choice of Derek Shearer , a professor at Occidental College and brother-in-law of Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott , as ambassador to Finland . * Doling out ambassadorships this way is a tradition nearly as old as the Republic . At first , politicians of the highest order -- Benjamin Franklin and Thomas_Jefferson among them -- were sent abroad to represent U.S. interests . But &quot; beginning with Andrew_Jackson , continuing through Ulysses S . Grant and even Woodrow Wilson , chiefs of U.S. missions were chosen largely from the ranks of the president ' s friends and supporters , &quot; wrote former Sen . Charles McC . Mathias Jr . in an article reprinted in the book &quot; The Modern Ambassador. &quot; Ambassadorial caliber improved after the creation of a career foreign service in 1924 . The ratio of career to non-career appointees has steadily increased , from about 50-50 between the two World_Wars to 70-30 in most recent Administrations . But for every distinguished non-career ambassador , such_as W . Averell Harriman , late husband of the new ambassador to France , there have also been &quot; ticking time_bombs , &quot; in the words of Sen . Paul S . Sarbanes ( D-Md ) . One that exploded was Vincent de Roulet . An article by George Crile reprinted in &quot; The Modern Ambassador ' says that de Roulet , named ambassador to Jamaica after contributing $ 75 # 000 to Richard Nixon ' s 1968 campaign , got_off to a less than rousing start when he referred to Jamaicans as &quot; children , &quot; denigrated the island as a tourist destination and jeopardized its other key industry , bauxite , by delaying approval of U.S. loan guarantees . When de Roulet claimed before Congress to have gotten a promise from then-Prime Minister Michael Manley not to nationalize U.S. bauxite interests , Manley declared the ambassador &quot; persona non grata. &quot; This after the American , hoping for a posher post in Europe , had already promised Nixon ' s lawyer , Herbert Kalmbach , $ 400 # 000 for the 1972 campaign . Kalmbach pleaded guilty in 1974 to trying to &quot; sell &quot; a European embassy to another U.S. ambassador in the Caribbean for $ 100 # 000 . The Ronald Reagan_Administration brought other embarrassments . Oilman William A . Wilson was forced to resign as envoy to the Vatican after it was revealed that he met secretly in 1985 with Moammar Kadafi , the Libyan leader whose country and compound U.S. forces later bombed . Another friend of Ron , Sam H . Zakhem , a Colorado politician named ambassador to Bahrain , made headlines during the 1987-88 Persian_Gulf crisis , when the U.S. Navy provided escorts for Kuwaiti oil_tankers . After U.S. forces sank an Iranian gunboat , Zakhem suggested to reporters that the Navy hold captured Iranian sailors hostage . Back home , he was indicted for promoting the Kuwaiti cause in the 1990-91 Persian_Gulf_War without registering as a foreign_agent . * According to a senior Senate staffer , the &quot; high_water mark &quot; for money-based ambassadorial appointments came under President Bush , himself a non-career ambassador to China and the United Nations . The Senate , which must confirm nominees , refused to vote on several Bush choices , including Joy A . Silverman , a New York socialite whose family complained about the size of the ambassadorial residence in Barbados . But some Bush choices denigrated at their nominations turned_out well . An Australian diplomat recalled that when Melvin Sembler arrived in 1989 , Australians expected the worst . Long the recipients of non-career ambassadors , they dubbed Edward Clark , a pick of Johnson ' s , &quot; Mr. Ed &quot; after American television ' s talking horse . But Sembler -- one of two Florida developers named ambassadors and known together as the &quot; St . Petersburg Twins &quot; -- worked hard at the job and wound_up being widely liked . &quot; He was not a fool and he had great charm and style , &quot; the diplomat said . Some countries , such_as Saudi_Arabia , actually prefer political appointees on the theory that they can more swiftly cut_through red_tape . &quot; If you want a ship visit , a call from the White_House can work wonders , &quot; said retired Col . Jim Waggener , who served as defense and air attache in Australia under Californians Robert Nesen , a Cadillac dealer , and publisher Bill Lane . &quot; If you want to organize a performance or a trade fair , a call to Hollywood or Wall_Street can work wonders , too . &quot; It ' s basically a personality-driven thing . If a sense of trust can be developed between the political appointee and the career people in an embassy , it can work beautifully , &quot; Waggener said . So how will Lawrence fare so far from Coronado ? &quot; Time and again these wealthy people turn_out to be perfectly able , &quot; the senior Senate staffer said hopefully . &quot; Besides , rich people give nice parties. &quot; From Donors to Diplomats Pamela Harriman Ambassador to France Contributions : $ 130 # 000 Edward Elson Ambassador to Denmark Contributions : $ 180 # 000 K .
