   <HEADLINE> TRUSTEE ' S OFFICE BECOMING A DEBTORS ' HAVEN ; BANKRUPTCY : TIGHT BUDGETS , CRUSHING WORKLOAD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO UNCOVER HIDDEN ASSETS . ONE OFFICIAL TELLS CREDITORS THEY ARE BASICALLY ON THEIR OWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Most hearings in the U.S. bankruptcy trustee ' s office here--a Spartan assembly room where debtors without assets go_to plead their cases--are dispatched in minutes . But a recent session took a remarkable turn . Instead of upholding the debtor ' s statement that he had no money , bankruptcy trustee Charles Daff bore_down , demanding amplification where simple &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; answers usually suffice . After an hourlong examination , he refused to approve the business owner ' s request to be relieved of his obligation to repay debts of more_than $ 600 # 000 . Daff said he suspected that some assets might have gone unreported--perhaps had even been hidden away intentionally in anticipation of the bankruptcy filing . Then , in a 15-minute discourse , he told the 40 or so assembled creditors that they should not expect much help from the bankruptcy system . If they wanted to recover the money they said they were owed , he told them , they should pool their remaining resources , hire a lawyer or an accountant who specializes in finding hidden funds , and conduct their own search . Daff acknowledged that trustees are supposed to be the people ' s watchdog to ensure that debtors ' claims of insolvency are truthful . But there often is little they can do , he said , to prevent abuse . The main reasons , Daff and others in the bankruptcy system say , are the courts ' crushing workload and tight budgets that leave judges and trustees little choice but to close cases as quickly and economically as possible . As a result , creditors seeking payment find that they are pretty much on_their_own . &quot; The message we got was that the system isn ' t going_to help us and certainly isn ' t going_to punish &quot; the debtor , said Debby L . Zajac of Long_Beach , one of the creditors at the hearing over which Daff was presiding . &quot; We are all mad as hell , &quot; she said , &quot; but most of us just don ' t have any money left to hire an attorney. &quot; The three federal bankruptcy judges assigned to Orange County received 14 # 030 new cases last year . For the three previous years , the system had handled more_than 40 # 000 cases . Their main assistants are the trustees--eight of them for the entire county . Hearing schedules require each trustee to handle as_many as 2 # 100 cases a year--an average of 175 a month . Furthermore , the trustees--private lawyers who specialize in administering debtors ' estates--have little financial incentive to pursue complicated cases in which they suspect fraud . They are paid a flat $ 45 fee for each so-called no-asset filing . If they choose to search for hidden assets , they are entitled to keep 3 % of whatever they recover . Meanwhile , they must foot all_the bills themselves . If they recover nothing , they are paid nothing . As Daff explained during his speech to creditors , his office is certainly willing to help , but he has no resources to tackle a case on_his_own . &quot; There ' s a lot of pressure from the U.S. trustee ' s office to go_after frauds when we see them , but the paradox is that private trustees don ' t get paid_for doing that , &quot; said Robert Mosier , a Costa Mesa lawyer . Mosier recently withdrew from the trustee panel in Orange County . &quot; The reality is that , unless the creditors come_in and point_out the fraud and then track_down the money , you just can ' t do_it , &quot; he said . Other trustees , bankruptcy lawyers and judges uphold Daff ' s position that creditors in Orange County who want to recover funds from a debtor intent_on not paying will likely have to organize and do their own hunting . That Daff even questioned a debtor ' s claim to have no assets may have been largely because that particular hearing drew a large and vocal contingent of angry creditors , bankruptcy professionals said . &quot; We work fundamentally on an honor_system , &quot; said Marcy J.K. Tiffany , chief U.S. trustee for the Central District , which includes Orange , Los Angeles , Riverside and San Bernardino counties and is the busiest in the nation , with 98 # 000 cases filed last year . As a result , using the bankruptcy system as a haven is &quot; incredibly easy , &quot; Tiffany said , for scam artists and unscrupulous business operators who take clients ' money , use it for lavish corporate trappings or personal belongings , then file for bankruptcy protection when the customers begin complaining . &quot; How many no-asset cases really involve a debtor with no assets ? &quot; Tiffany asked_in a moment of introspection during a recent interview . &quot; We have absolutely no way of knowing. &quot; And at the rate the government pays trustees &quot; we just can ' t afford to find out. &quot; Tiffany estimates that 20 % of the bankruptcy filings in the Central District last year were legitimate efforts by individuals or businesses to regain their financial footing . The rest , she said , were efforts to use bankruptcy to halt legitimate foreclosures and evictions , block civil litigation and sometimes to seek shelter from civil or criminal investigations . In a recent case , for example , the Federal Trade Commission sued and reached a settlement with a Sacramento-area man , William Moreland , who was marketing gold-mine interests by phone.Moreland agreed to shut_down and to reimburse investors fully after FTC agents accused him of selling securities illegally . But the ink had barely dried on the settlement papers when Moreland filed for bankruptcy protection , effectively canceling_out the reimbursement agreement . The FTC went_to bankruptcy court and again argued its case--but to no avail . The court ruled that the bankruptcy filing was not fraudulent and relieved Moreland of the obligation to honor the settlement and repay investors . The bankruptcy court system is clogged , Tiffany said , mainly because of efforts to avoid liability . Lawyers who handle bankruptcy cases don ' t deny that there is a problem , but some of them maintain that getting a debtor into bankruptcy court provides creditors with more--not less--control of the situation . &quot; Sure , the number of scams is up . It ' s the recession--the time is ripe for people to be taken_advantage of , &quot; said Ronald Rus , whose Irvine firm , Rus , Miliband , Williams &amp; Smith , specializes in representing trustees and creditors . &quot; The thing people have to understand is that you are better_off if a bad_guy does file bankruptcy . That puts him under the jurisdiction of the court and gives you an opportunity to see if there is anything to collect to pay the creditors . that ' s the real issue in bankruptcy , &quot; Rus said . &quot; Are there assets to collect ? &quot; But that ' s just where the system is most likely to break_down today , said Newport Beach lawyer Theodor Albert , a member of the trustee panel in Orange County . &quot; We ' re attempting to achieve two perhaps opposite goals , &quot; he said . &quot; We have to deal with a massive volume of filings , and we are trying to be more efficient with quicker and less expensive resolution of cases . &quot; If it is our priority in society to catch every single culprit , &quot; he said , &quot; then we have to alter the compensation so someone has the incentive to do that . With what we have now , some crooks will make_it through the net. &quot; that ' s what Daff said in his impromptu civics lecture . &quot; We have people here who have lost substantial sums_of_money , &quot; he said . &quot; But does the debtor have assets that we can trace and recover , through litigation and hours and hours of expensive work by accountants ? &quot; Pointing_out that he is not an government employee , Daff explained that he takes such cases only on contingency . &quot; I could go broke &quot; spending much time on a case , he said , so &quot; any creditors that want to participate with me , that want to discuss sharing the costs . . . are welcome. &quot; The creditors have the right to hire private counsel and file claims with the bankruptcy court in an effort to recover hidden assets , Daff said , but that rarely occurs . &quot; Typically what happens in these cases , &quot; Daff said , &quot; is that if I get 50 people together , everybody with substantial losses , everybody says , ' I can ' t afford another dollar , ' and we all leave the room and nothing happens . Truthfully . It goes_on and on. &quot; And it is the creditors , not the debtor or the trustee , who suffer , he said . At one point in his plea , Daff stopped and looked down at a recorder taping his speech : &quot; I ' ve said too_much already. &quot; But Tiffany and others who work with the bankruptcy court say that Daff ' s comments could be a wake-up call . &quot; Sometimes the system is blind to everything but the protection of the debtor , &quot; Tiffany said . &quot; That causes the courts to hesitate too long to take control. &quot; Trustee Albert said : &quot; I think Chuck Daff ' s point is_well taken . . . . All he was saying is that the trustee is not a policeman . Nobody is paying his salary . He is a civil litigant , just like the creditors , and he has to make a case pencil out financially . &quot; The creditors who already are in the soup have a lot more incentive than the trustee to invest money in chasing down assets. &quot; Bankruptcies Still High Orange County bankruptcy filings declined slightly in 1993 , but the total remains nearly twice as high as five years ago . 1989 : 8 # 306 1993 : 14 # 030 How Bankruptcies Break Down 06 # 12 , 07 # 07 , 07 # 08 , 08 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 Chapter 7 5 # 957 7 # 314 9 # 918 12 # 066 11 # 874 Chapter 11 362 309 457 416 393 Chapter 12 1 Chapter 13 1 # 987 1 # 719 1 # 993 1 # 838 1 # 762 Bankruptcy Glossary Chapter 7 : Allows businesses and individuals to keep some personal_property and , in some instances , a home and automobile .
