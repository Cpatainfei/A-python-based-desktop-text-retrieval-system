   <HEADLINE> SECOND-LONGEST SHUTTLE FLIGHT ENDS SAFELY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The space shuttle Columbia and its crew returned safely Friday from the second-longest trip in shuttle history , a two-week journey that provided tips for building a better space_station . The research mission ended just an hour short of the longest shuttle flight , made by Columbia last year . &quot; It would have been nice to get the record , but it was a great flight , &quot; shuttle commander John Casper said before heading_home to Houston . &quot; We ' re really pleased with it . I think we did a lot of good things. &quot; Scientists called the mission a success . &quot; We bring_home a treasure which I believe is of considerable value , &quot; said Peter Curreri , National Aeronautics and Space Administration mission scientist . The 100-ton shuttle sailed_through a clear morning sky and landed on_time at the space center . Aerial TV views showed Columbia fishtailing on the runway before coming_to a stop , unusual but of no concern to shuttle managers . Casper said he was just trying to stay_on the center_line . A few objects were seen falling_off NASA ' s oldest shuttle as it rolled_down the runway ; they turned_out to be devices for deploying the drag chute . An inspection later revealed some missing pieces : six thermal covers from the nose-wheel compartment and one thermal tile from the same area . &quot; It ' s not a normal situation that they fly off like that , but it did not endanger the vehicle or the crew , &quot; NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham said . The 5.8-million-mile mission , which began March 4 , featured 11 major science experiments worth nearly $ 100 million . Most were commanded by remote_control from the ground -- a method called &quot; telescience &quot; -- leaving the astronauts tending to such chores as medical and engineering tests , and rat and plant checks .</TEXT>
