THEN SHE TOOK A CHANCE ON DIRECTOR BILLE AUGUST ' S VISION FOR ' THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS ' -- AND MADE PEACE WITH IT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Isabel Allende is in an enviable position . At 51 , the Chilean-born novelist is internationally admired , with five bestsellers already published in 27 languages and a sixth book on the way . And soon her audience will be even wider , thanks to the imminent release of two films based on her novels : &quot; The House of the Spirits &quot; ( starring Meryl Streep , Jeremy Irons and Winona Ryder , opening Friday ) and &quot; Of Love and Shadows &quot; ( which will open later this year ) . But although Allende is poised for newfound cinematic fame , don ' t imagine that it is because she has courted Hollywood ' s attention . On the contrary , when the U.S. publication , in 1985 , of &quot; The House of the Spirits &quot; created interest among agents and producers , Allende put the kibosh on the bidding . &quot; I was not very impressed , to tell you the truth , &quot; she explains in an interview in her work studio here . &quot; I had the feeling that most of the offers were from producers or directors who just wanted to get the option so that nobody else could make the movie , not because they had a vision of it or any interest in the story . It ' s a very complicated story , and I didn ' t think it was possible to make_it into a comprehensible film. &quot; And several years later , when Bille August , the Danish director of the Academy Award-winning &quot; Pelle the Conqueror , &quot; approached Allende about making the film , she flatly turned him down . &quot; He didn ' t pay any attention , &quot; Allende says with a laugh . &quot; He just came_to San Francisco , rented a theater and showed me ' Pelle. ' I was very impressed . Afterward we had a cup of coffee , and within 20 minutes I realized that he was totally in_love with the story of ' The House of the Spirits. ' He knew the book by heart , all_the characters , everything . And he had a very clear vision of how that could be turned_into a two-hour movie. &quot; August ' s vision did not include much of the surrealist imagery that Allende ' s work is known for . &quot; He was very clear about what could be done and what could not be done , &quot; she says . &quot; He said that all_the magic elements of the book would have to be eliminated. &quot; The director defends his decision as a way of making the film believable . &quot; It was a question of balance all_the time because supernatural effects in a movie can look ridiculous , and it becomes a sort of special-effects story , &quot; August explains . &quot; Since the story deals with such powerful realism as well , we decided to do_it this way. &quot; But this is nearly heretical , considering just how important magical realism -- the dreamlike Latin_American literary style pioneered by Gabriel Garcia Marquez -- is to Allende ' s book and , in fact , to her own life . Her work space , in a former coach_house just across a cobblestone alley from the law offices of her second husband , William Gordon , reflects the fantasy of her imagination . Antique embroidery , folk carvings and clay artifacts that look as if they were unearthed by Indiana Jones are mounted above doorways and the fireplace mantle . Rows of first editions of her books straddle long shelves on a wall behind her desk . Allende herself is petite and lovely , dressed like one of her heroines in a long green velvet gown with a wispy black vest thrown over it . Verdigris pendants in the shape of tiny tree_frogs , moons and stars dangle from her earrings . Her warmth and good_humor are infectious , but she is also intensely focused , a New Age earth_mother with the mental acuity of a Harvard MBA . &quot; The House of the Spirits &quot; spans three generations of a mythic South_American family , the Truebas , that closely resembles Allende ' s own . It begins shortly after the turn_of_the_century with a romance between the autocratic patriarch , Esteban Trueba , and Clara , his clairvoyant wife , then moves_on through decades and innumerable plot twists into a disturbing present in which Esteban ' s leftist-leaning granddaughter is arrested and tortured by a right-wing dictatorship that threatens to destroy both the family and their country . The similarity between the story and its characters and Allende -- the niece of the former Marxist president of Chile , Salvador Allende Gossens , who was assassinated 21 years ago during a coup -- and her family is undeniable even if some of the details are quite different . &quot; It is loosely based on my family , &quot; she acknowledges . &quot; It started as a sort of a chronicle of the family , but in the very first paragraph I realized that fiction had taken over. &quot; So Allende ' s great-aunt did not have green hair , as does Clara ' s sister , Rosa the Beautiful , in the book , and her grandfather was not a rapist and murderer like Esteban . Nor could her grandmother play the piano with the lid over the keys , as Clara does_in the novel . &quot; But she could move the ashtray without touching it , &quot; Allende allows , warming to talk_of her remarkable clan . &quot; She practiced telepathy all her life and had premonitions in dreams . The Catholic_Church was then very powerful and they did not approve of this . My grandfather , who was a very conservative Catholic , did not think it was dangerous or sinful ; he just didn ' t like it very much , because it was not scientific . Then one day , my grandmother came_up with the idea that maybe it was not the souls of the dead that moved the three-legged table -- it was the extraterrestrials . And then my grandfather approved , because that was scientific , and from then on he participated in the seances . &quot; That is the kind of family I come from , &quot; she says , laughing . &quot; I didn ' t have to invent anything. &quot; As her book became more popular , Allende says , she noticed that members of her family became more and more like the characters in it : &quot; Now the fiction has replaced the real story of the family , and we live this sort of fantasy that these things happened . When I saw the movie , I realized immediately that the fiction of the film is 10 times bigger than the fiction of the book . Very soon we will have the photographs of Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep on the piano . They will be my grandparents . I will have all these famous people as my relatives. &quot; Allende does have some_other strong feelings seeing Streep , Irons , Ryder , Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave cast in such a quintessentially Latin story . &quot; I was surprised that ( August ) chose such an Anglo-looking cast . Everybody is so blond , &quot; she says with a shrug . &quot; But it is true that in Latin_America , the upper_classes look very European. &quot; Redgrave , who plays the matriarch , Nivea , describes Allende ' s work as a story that is not related only and specifically to one country but to many . &quot; I mean , after all , why have millions of people in every country read this book ? &quot; she asks . &quot; The essence of what I have to do_in this role is not connected with trying to convince anybody that I ' m Latin_American . It ' s to do with what kind of a person is this lady. &quot; Bernd Eichinger , head of Constantin Films and producer of &quot; The House of the Spirits , &quot; says : &quot; You need stars in this movie because the characters are bigger than life . The film is set_in a realistic environment , but it is more in the tradition of the movies that we did with big stars in the ' 50s. &quot; Eichinger feels strongly that August ' s sensibilities were right for &quot; The House of the Spirits &quot; and has just begun another film project with the director , based on &quot; Smilla ' s Sense of Snow , &quot; the best-selling novel by Peter Hoeg . Despite the differences in their backgrounds , Allende was comfortable passing the reins of the film to a Scandinavian director &quot; because I like the restrained passion of the Scandinavians -- you know there is a lot going_on , but you don ' t see it on the surface. &quot; Nor do criticisms from some in the Latin_American community about the European bent of the film and director disturb her . &quot; I say this is not my movie ; this is Bille August ' s movie , &quot; she says . &quot; I write a book , and I feel that the book is mine as long as it is sitting on that desk . But then one day it is published , and the very moment you publish it , you give it away . It is gone ! It is a creature that has its own life. &quot; Besides , she adds , &quot; I don ' t intend to write Latin_American stories . I try to write universal stories . The way we are and the way we live and the great passions and dramas and tragedies are always the same . The fact that they are set_in Chile or Venezuela or California doesn ' t mean much. &quot; Allende is herself a film buff , with &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and &quot; The Crying Game &quot; among her recent favorite movies . She also admires the way books by Brazilian novelist Jorge Amado were made into the films &quot; Gabriela &quot; and &quot; Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands &quot; and the smooth translation that Laura Esquivel ' s &quot; Like Water for Chocolate &quot; made to the screen . While she likens &quot; The House of the Spirits &quot; to epic films like &quot; Dr. Zhivago &quot; and &quot; Fanny and Alexander , &quot; she says &quot; Of Love and Shadows &quot; is more like a Costa-Gavras thriller . &quot; It ' s like ' Missing ' or ' The Official Story ' -- it has that tone , &quot; she says . &quot; One thing I have learned as a writer is that every story has a rhythm , a way of being told . My first novel ( &quot; House of Spirits &quot; ) has the tone of old things , told and retold . The second story ( &quot; Of Love and Shadows &quot; ) is based on a political crime that really happened in Chile in 1973 , and the tone of the book is very journalistic. &quot; She is also wise enough to realize that in film , the director has the last word : &quot; Films are dialogue and action ; you don ' t use language as you do_in a book . The wonderful part about literature is that you use the reader ' s imagination , experience and sensibility to create an atmosphere . In a movie , you are trapped in a chair and you watch. &quot; * &quot; Of Love and Shadows , &quot; directed by Betty Kaplan and starring a mostly Latin cast , will be released by Miramax later this year . The story came from Allende ' s own experiences as a young journalist in Chile and in Venezuela , where she fled after her uncle was deposed . &quot; It represents a time after the military coup in 1973 , &quot; she says . &quot; I left Chile in 1975 , so for a year and a half I lived_in this state of terror , and I was a journalist and knew what was going_on and I could not write_about it because of the tremendous censorship . Later , when I was living_in Venezuela , I heard about the bodies that had been found in an abandoned mine in Chile . Among the bodies were five members of the same family -- a father and four sons . And for five years the women of the family looked_for them , asking_in concentration_camps and prisons and hospitals . &quot; One day they were called to the morgue and they could identify some keys , a comb , hair , a piece of a blue sweater , some bones . They were lucky because most relatives of los desaparecidos ( the disappeared ) never find anything. &quot; The story of the political murders haunted Allende for several years . &quot; When the time came_to write my second novel I did not have to think_about it ; the thing was there , &quot; she says . &quot; that ' s why when I saw the movie , I felt so rewarded . The movie conveys the emotions , the fear , the love , the lust . I was really touched. &quot; Allende ' s own life has been marked by tragedy , most recently and terribly by the death , last year , of her 28-year-old daughter , Paula , of complications brought_on by a rare hereditary disease , porphyria . &quot; She was in a coma for a year and I brought her home and took_care of her , &quot; Allende says , stifling tears . &quot; That changed my life and my writing completely . It is as if one life stopped and another starts . A life quite different from the other one , and Paula is the guide . She ' s the guide because when she was like a doll in the bed , I could only communicate with her in dreams , spiritually. &quot; She is almost finished with a memoir in which her daughter figures strongly . &quot; Going_back to every moment of that awful year and writing_about it forces me to revise who I am , &quot; she says . &quot; Why do I write ? For whom do I write ? &quot; Before , Allende says , her books seemed to have messages yet she never thought very intensely about them . &quot; Now , for the first time , I know that it is the message that I have to tell , and I have to find a way of telling it. &quot; When the memoir is finished , Allende wants to attempt a screenplay . &quot; It is not the right time now , but I would like to learn the craft , because you can do with movies what you can never do with literature , &quot; she says . &quot; You reach an audience that is a_million times greater , and the impact that a movie has in one afternoon is so_much greater than a book can have in a_hundred years . And then in a movie you have elements that you never have in literature . You have music , you have the wonderful acting . If you have good actors , you have what they create for each character. &quot; But would n ' t she miss the opportunity to layer her writing with the extraordinary descriptions and detail she is known for ? &quot; No , I would n ' t , because I am good at telling the story and all_the rest is work , &quot; she states . &quot; What I love is to spell_out the story in the first draft and then afterward I spend years , sometimes , creating the atmosphere , working with every word , every adjective , to make_it &quot; -- she pauses , searching for the right adjective -- &quot; efficient . That takes a lot of time and work , and sometimes it ' s not as interesting as just telling the story. &quot;</TEXT>
