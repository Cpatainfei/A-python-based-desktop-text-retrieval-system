   <TEXT> Norway ' s most famous painting , &quot; The Scream &quot; by Edvard Munch , was recovered Saturday , almost three months after it was stolen from an Oslo museum . Police said the painting , which is_on fragile paper , was recovered undamaged Saturday morning at a hotel in Asgardstrand , about 40 miles south of Oslo.Three Norwegians were arrested . The recovery and arrests apparently were made in connection with an attempt to sell or ransom the painting , the Norwegian news_agency NTB said . Munch ' s 1893 painting was stolen from the National Gallery in a break-in on Feb . 12 , the opening day of the 1994 Winter_Olympics in Lillehammer . The work depicts a waif-like figure , wide-mouthed in terror beneath a blood-red sky with two shadowy figures in the background . During the 50-second break-in , which was recorded by a security camera , two thieves used a ladder to climb_up to a museum window , broke_in and emerged with the painting . They left_behind a postcard that said : &quot; Thanks for the poor security. &quot; &quot; The Scream &quot; has been used as the anguished symbol of a century scarred by two world_wars , the Holocaust , the atom_bomb and modern horrors such_as the conflict in Bosnia . The police refused to give details about their investigation or release the suspects ' names , in keeping with Norwegian practice . A police spokeswoman said she could not exclude the possibility of more arrests . Lief Lier , who led the investigation , said Norwegian police had asked the special art and antiquities unit of Scotland_Yard in London for help . The artist lived from 1863 to 1944 .</TEXT>
