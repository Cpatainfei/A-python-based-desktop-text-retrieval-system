   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; MARKETS : CORPORATE PROFITS BOOST STOCKS ; PROFIT REPORTS BOOST STOCKS ; YIELDS CLIMB</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Strong corporate profit reports bolstered stock prices Wednesday , despite the drag of higher interest_rates . Closing to within 42 points of a record high , the Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.50 points to 3 # 936.04 , reversing Tuesday ' s 6-point loss and resuming a climb that added 3 % last week . The stock_market initially weakened along with the bond market , where fear of inflation sent prices lower and interest_rates higher . But bond yields retreated somewhat later , and Wall_Street turned its attention to stronger-than-expected quarterly results from U.S. corporations . Institutional Brokers Estimate System said that as of Wednesday , 57 % of the companies it tracks reported third-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall_Street average estimates . &quot; It ' s just an accumulation of good corporate third-quarter earnings_reports , &quot; said Jack Shaughnessy , director_of_research at Advest . &quot; that ' s proving to be right now the overriding consideration. &quot; Analysts also tied Wednesday ' s gains to computerized buying programs ahead of Friday ' s options expirations . Larry Rice , chief market_strategist at Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross , cautioned that the surge in major indexes masked some underlying weaknesses . &quot; Volume is up , but the fact of the_matter is that the breadth is still poor , and it has been for a number of sessions , &quot; he said . In the broader market , rising issues edged out decliners by 1 # 131 to 1 # 029 on the New York Stock_Exchange , where volume totaled 319.34 million shares , up from 259.74 million Tuesday . Stocks headed lower at the open , along with bonds , after the government reported that while the nation ' s trade_deficit narrowed by $ 1.45 billion in August , Japanese imports to the United States surged to a record high . &quot; Both imports and exports were stronger , &quot; said James Schroeder , MMS International market_analyst . &quot; that ' s more an indication of continued economic strength and obviously would include both here and abroad. &quot; Bond prices often fall on data that show a robust economy , because they can foreshadow inflation . Treasury_bond yields continued to rise as the dollar fell while investors worried that a weaker U.S. currency would deter foreign investors from buying dollar-denominated securities . Also hurting bond prices were inflation fears , fanned by a rise in daily commodity prices and remarks from a Federal_Reserve official . The Treasury ' s main 30-year bond yield increased to 7.89 % from Tuesday ' s 7.86 % , pushing its price down 1 / 4 point , or $ 2.50 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . Yields and prices move_in opposite directions . In the currency market , the dollar fell to within a yen of its all-time low against the Japanese yen after the U.S._government reported an unexpected widening of America ' s trade_deficit with Japan in August . The British_pound also rose sharply , advancing for a seventh-consecutive trading session . No specific set of data or news spurred the jump , but analysts said solid economic_growth , low inflation and political stability in Britain has made sterling an attractive alternative for dollar sellers . After falling_in Asian dealings , the dollar slid further to close at 97.28 yen -- a record-low close_in U.S. trading -- down from 97.75 yen Tuesday . The dollar also was changing hands in New York at 1.502 German marks , down from 1.5025. Sterling , meanwhile , continued to advance against the dollar after breaking_through a two-year high Monday . The pound has risen about 2.55 % against the dollar this month and is up more_than 9 % from early this year . It closed at $ 1.623 , up from $ 1.613 , a third day of gains exceeding 1 cent . Among the stock_market highlights : Computer-related stocks surged after Compaq and Digital Equipment reported improved quarterly results . * Compaq rose 1 1 / 8 to 36 5 / 8 after the company said its third-quarter net_income rose to 75 cents per share from 42 cents a year ago . * Digital rose 1 7 / 8 to 31 1 / 4 . The company narrowed its first-quarter net loss to 98 cents per share from $ 1.14 a year earlier . * IBM added 1 to 75 3 / 8 as analysts anticipated a good third-quarter earnings_report due Thursday . * The strength in computer stocks spread to the over-the-counter market , where Intel rose 1 5 / 8 to 60 , Lotus Development added 1 3 / 4 to 36 7 / 16 , and Microsoft climbed 1 to 57 5 / 8 .
