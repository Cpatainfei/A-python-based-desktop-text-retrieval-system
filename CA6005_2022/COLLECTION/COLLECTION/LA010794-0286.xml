   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; STATE CALLS ITS AUDIT OF ANTELOPE VALLEY FAIR FINANCES ' MISLEADING ' ; FUNDS : AGENCY ADMITS ERROR IN SAYING BOARD DIRECTOR SPURRED INVESTMENT AT BANK WHERE HE IS CHAIRMAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Antelope Valley Fair officials may have been displeased with the findings of a recent state audit that found dozens of violations of state regulations , but fair Director Clyde Golding was personally offended . Fair directors , according to the audit , agreed to deposit investment funds in the bank for which Golding serves as chairman after Golding made &quot; promises of improved interest rates. &quot; Golding , however , successfully challenged the audit ' s findings . &quot; I have never made that promise . I don ' t have that authority. &quot; At a news_conference Thursday , Golding , who has served on the fair board more_than two decades , along with fair board President Charla Abbott and fair Manager Bruce Latta , released a letter from the state_Department of Food and Agriculture that states &quot; . . . we find our report was misleading . . . . &quot; &quot; The information presented in the audit was very inaccurate , &quot; said Golding , who said he never did anything to entice fair board_members to invest fair funds at Antelope Valley Bank , where he has been chairman since its 1981 inception . State auditors took Golding ' s remarks out of context from the minutes of a meeting , according to the Dec . 9 Agriculture_Department letter . The audit , released in November , made 196 specific recommendations in need of immediate attention at the state-run fair based on a review of a two-year period beginning Jan . 1 , 1991 . The number of recommendations is nearly four times that made in most reviews of state fairs , according to the agriculture_department . Fair officials must submit a response to the audit by next Friday detailing how recommended changes will be made . Although auditors admitted they had made a mistake about Golding ' s comments as far as interest_rates , they said , if nothing else , the appearance of a conflict_of_interest remains when Antelope Valley Bank does business with the Antelope Valley Fair so_long as Golding is a fair director and bank chairman . &quot; The fair manager must make certain that all banking institutions in the Antelope Valley have an equal_opportunity to bid and to provide banking services to the fair , &quot; according to the Agriculture_Department letter . Antelope Valley Fair , according to Latta , still has its main operating account at Antelope Valley Bank but last year closed its investment accounts .</TEXT>
