   <HEADLINE> ALLAN MALAMUD : NOTES ON A SCORECARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Michael Moorer should be considered dangerous . . . . All punchers are . . . . However , any checklist for the heavyweight title fight Friday night at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas would give the edge to champion Evander Holyfield in determination , big-time experience , heart , conditioning and chin . . . . This is the first time in a while that Holyfield will be fighting someone his own size . He usually looks_up_to people in the ring but will be eye to eye with Moorer at 6 feet 2 . They each weighed 214 pounds Wednesday . . . . Moorer is the first left-hander to oppose Holyfield since he dispatched one Jesse Shelby in the third round eight years ago in Corpus Christi , Tex . . . . Only two other southpaws have challenged for the heavyweight title , both times in Germany against Muhammad Ali . Karl Mildenberger went_in the 12th round in Frankurt in 1966 , and Richard Dunn in the fifth in Munich in 1976 . . . . Holyfield probably will get the job done before the limit Friday and then face Lennox Lewis for the undisputed championship in November , providing that Lewis defeats Phil Jackson as expected May 6 in Atlantic_City . . . . A year after his first retirement , Holyfield is talking_about working until 1996 and anticipating a mega-bucks bout against Mike Tyson just before the Olympic Games in his hometown of Atlanta . . . . One punch from Moorer could spoil the plans , but if he doesn ' t pull a surprise , Michael should try baseball . . . . That sport , you know , is in dire need of hard-throwing southpaws . . . . * Something must be wrong with the marketing of baseball when its best player , Barry Bonds , can ' t crack the list of the nation ' s 10 most popular athletes . . . . It shouldn ' t be long before Don Mattingly , who set a major_league record with six grand_slams in 1987 , increases his career total to seven . . . . Among the best-dressed teams are the Oakland Athletics when they wear their green shirts with gold trim . . . . Dodger Stadium fans are really getting with it this year , throwing_back baseballs hit into the pavilion by visiting teams . . . . It doesn ' t look as though the Colorado Rockies will suffer the sophomore jinx at the gate . Despite rain that caused a 42-minute delay , official attendance at a Tuesday night_game against Florida at Mile-High Stadium was 50 # 217 . . . . That wasn ' t a misprint . The high-powered Pittsburgh Penguins actually got_off only three shots on goal in the second_period and one in the third_period during their 2-1 victory over the Washington Capitals on Tuesday . . . . When the season began , the last place I expected to see King Coach Barry Melrose during the first round of the playoffs was in the ESPN studio . . . . Chris McCarron , who has won 15 stakes_races at Santa Anita this meeting , will have a great chance to win another Sunday aboard Bien Bien in the $ 400 # 000 San Juan Capistrano Handicap . . . . Bobby Bonilla , in town on business with the New York Mets , dropped_by Hollywood Park on Wednesday to apply for an owner ' s license . Trainer Melody Conlon recently purchased three horses for Bonilla at the Barrett ' s Sale in Pomona . . . . Gary Jones says Holy Bull impresses him as much before the Kentucky_Derby as Seattle Slew did_in April of 1977 . . . . If Barry Switzer wins two games next season , he will set a Dallas Cowboy record for a first-year coach . Tom Landry was 0-11-1 in 1960 and Jimmy Johnson 1-15 in 1989 . . . . There is a decent chance Gary Colson will leave Fresno State and return to Pepperdine . . . . UCLA center George Zidek , an economics major , had a 4.0 grade-point average during the winter quarter . . . . Easton Stadium , new home of the Bruin softball team , is a little gem . . . . The Boston Celtics have lost as_many home_games , 22 , this season as they did during the five seasons from 1983-84 through 1987-88 . . . . The Detroit Pistons ' plight was summed_up when Isiah Thomas suffered a torn Achilles ' tendon during what probably was the last game of his career . . . . Charles Smith has become the boo birds ' favorite target at Madison Square Garden . . . . Any week now , the NBA playoffs will start . But in 1962 , the Celtics defeated the Lakers in the seventh game of the championship series on April 18 .</TEXT>
