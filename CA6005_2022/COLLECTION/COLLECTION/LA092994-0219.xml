   <HEADLINE> CIA ISSUING 11 REPRIMANDS IN AMES SPY CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> CIA Director R . James Woolsey announced Wednesday that he is reprimanding 11 current and former senior intelligence officials for their roles in failing to help detect that one of the agency ' s employees , Aldrich H . Ames , was spying for the Soviet_Union . But Woolsey is not firing or demoting any of these officials -- all but one of whom worked for the CIA ' s Directorate of Operations , its clandestine service . Only four of the 11 officials will receive &quot; serious &quot; reprimands . Three of those four have already retired , so the only penalty they will suffer will be a ban on post-retirement work for the CIA . The current head of the Operations Directorate , Ted Price -- who served as head of the CIA ' s Counterintelligence Center while Ames worked for it in 1990 -- was among the seven people given a mild reprimand . But he will keep his job as the CIA official in direct charge of spying and covert_operations . Woolsey ' s actions follow the completion of a classified CIA inspector_general ' s report that found there had been , by Woolsey ' s own admission , &quot; a systemic failure of the CIA. &quot; &quot; The consequences have been horrid for us at the CIA , for the American people and for those who helped us overseas and who , in a number of cases , in_effect , were murdered by Ames , &quot; the director admitted . Rep . Dan Glickman ( D-Kan. ) , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , said in an interview Wednesday night that he would have liked to see &quot; some heads roll &quot; at the CIA for its mishandling of the Ames case . However , he went_on , &quot; the problem is that you ' d like to see the right heads roll . . . . Most of the people I see really culpable and responsible are no longer at the agency. &quot; Ames began spying for the Soviet_Union in 1985 and continued until he was arrested early this year . By official estimates , his actions in turning_over CIA secrets led to the deaths of 10 people working for U.S. intelligence and compromised about three dozen cases . Yet Ames was left on_the_job and repeatedly given new assignments in extremely sensitive positions , including the CIA ' s Soviet / Eastern Europe division and the Counterintelligence Center . In a press_conference Wednesday , Woolsey acknowledged that Ames ' drinking problem had been so egregious that , at one point while he was stationed in Rome in the 1980s , he fell drunk in a gutter and was retrieved by the Italian police . Yet when he returned from Rome , he was given a job in the Soviet_Union / Eastern Europe division at the CIA ' s headquarters in Langley , Va . In 1988 , CIA Director William H . Webster established a new Counterintelligence Center in an effort to respond to the spy case of Edgar Lee Howard , a young agent who defected to the Soviet_Union . Officials in the Directorate of Operations assigned Ames to the new center in what Woolsey called &quot; an easy solution to what they erroneously thought was no more_than a personnel problem. &quot; With that transfer , Ames won access to the internal CIA computer_system that gave details of double-agent cases -- people pretending to be spying for the Soviet_Union , while actually reporting back to the United States . He passed_on the details to the KGB , the Soviet secret_police . Woolsey went_to Capitol_Hill on Wednesday to try to explain to Congress , in closed-door meetings , what disciplinary actions he is taking as a result of the Ames case . He told reporters he wants to &quot; leave Ames behind . . . and turn our attention resolutely to the future. &quot; But it is unclear whether Congress will support him . One intelligence specialist , Jeff Richelson of the National Security Archives , said Woolsey ' s response will be seen as &quot; clearly insufficient . . . . I ' m surprised there were no demotions or firings. &quot; Yet former CIA Director Richard Helms , himself a former head of the Directorate of Operations , said that Woolsey ' s personnel decisions were &quot; reasonable . We don ' t really arrest policemen because they don ' t catch the burglars. &quot; Although Ames ' work for the KGB resulted in the deaths of 10 people , Helms said , &quot; the fact remains that people get killed around here all_the time . Let ' s not exaggerate this. &quot; Woolsey told reporters Wednesday that the 11 current and former intelligence_officers were being reprimanded for &quot; errors in management , as well as for failing to devote sufficient resources to the counterintelligence effort as questions arose. &quot; Price was the only one of the 11 people identified by name . Of the four people to whom the director gave serious reprimands , the only one still at the CIA will retire within the next few days , for reasons Woolsey said were unrelated to the Ames case . All four will be &quot; barred from further relationships with the CIA &quot; during retirement . They will receive their regular pensions . Of the seven who received milder reprimands , four still work for the CIA and three are retired . Woolsey said those who were reprimanded cannot be given promotions or performance awards for at least two years . The CIA director said that Price worked as director of the Counterintelligence Center only for a &quot; relatively brief &quot; period of 10 months . &quot; Those who conducted the mole hunt are explicit that they reported to him only during this period , &quot; Woolsey said . &quot; Neither his superior nor his subordinates were calling_for increased resources . . . . I have confidence in Ted Price ' s ability and professionalism , and I have asked him to stay_on as director of operations. &quot; After discussing Price ' s case at Wednesday ' s closed hearing , Glickman said that &quot; as I examine it today , he is not a particularly culpable &quot; individual . The CIA ' s internal investigation turned_up a long series of errors and management mistakes in the handling of the Ames case . For example , Ames stopped reporting his meetings with Soviet officials in clear violation of CIA policy , but his superiors took no action against him . When junior officers tried to ask Ames about this , &quot; management dropped the_matter , a most serious lack of attention to duty , &quot; Woolsey acknowledged . At another point , the CIA director said , &quot; Ames , who had been ranked as third from the bottom_out of 200 officers , was selected to serve on a promotion panel . . . . In that assignment Ames was in a position to do substantial damage , for he was given easy access to the files of a group of our mid-level officers. &quot;</TEXT>
