   <HEADLINE> WHY REWARD THESE THUGS ? ; PAYOFF TO CEDRAS IS A BLOT ON AMERICAN HONOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States is currently detaining scores of Haitians suspected of committing unspecified crimes under the three-year-long military dictatorship . Meanwhile , the biggest crooks of all , led by Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , have been allowed to leave Haiti with a planeload of possessions to help assure their comfort in exile . That U.S.-guaranteed safe departure was no surprise . Washington has for some time embraced the idea . As President Clinton repeated at Friday ' s White_House ceremony for returning Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , there should be no &quot; revenge or retribution &quot; after the end of Haiti ' s latest despotism . What does come as a shock -- what comes as something of a national humiliation -- was the extraordinarily generous and wholly unnecessary severance package that Cedras was able to squeeze_out of the United States just before he slunk off to Panama . Over the next year the United States will provide_for the transportation , care and feeding of Cedras , his family , his chief_of_staff , Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby , and 23 members of Cedras ' clan who were allowed to enter the United States this week . At the same time , the United States has unfrozen at least $ 79 million that hundreds of Haitian army_officers and backers of Cedras have_on deposit in U.S. banks . Further , the U.S._government will lease , at a cost of some tens of thousands of dollars a year , three homes belonging_to Cedras and his mother . Why these apparently late concessions demanded by Cedras were even seriously considered , let alone granted , is baffling . With Haiti firmly under U.S. military_control , with many of the goons who supported Cedras either disarmed or in hiding , the deposed dictator had no cards left to play . Washington had already promised Cedras that he would n ' t have to face the wrath of his fellow citizens . The right response to his outrageous demands should simply have been to hustle him aboard the plane waiting to fly him into exile . For years , Cedras , his cronies and supporters sucked millions out of Haiti ' s desperately poor economy . At least some of the ruling clique are suspected of being deeply involved in the international drug trade . This was a regime lacking wholly in political legitimacy and utterly without mercy in enforcing its will . It was a regime that raped and pillaged Haiti , and yet in the end it demanded -- and won -- the right to depart with &quot; dignity. &quot; Anthony Lake , Clinton ' s national-security adviser , calls the deal that led to Cedras ' departure a success , and says there ' s nothing to be apologetic about . Yes , there is . It ' s called the moral honor of the United States , and today it ' s looking pretty bedraggled .</TEXT>
