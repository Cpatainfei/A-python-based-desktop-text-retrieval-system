Yu ' s appointment comes as the university ' s departments and programs in the humanities face budget_cuts of $ 1.4 million , or 5.2 % . With the cutbacks , Yu said , &quot; it becomes particularly important to defend the value of studying literature , language , philosophy , the arts of other cultures , for their own sake and for the crucial exposure to modes of analysis , judgment and expression they provide. &quot; Yu studied French and German history and literature at Harvard_University before attending Stanford_University , where in 1976 she earned a doctorate degree in comparative_literature . She went_on to teach at the University of Minnesota and Columbia University before joining UC Irvine three years ago and founding the East Asian languages and literature department .</TEXT>
