   <HEADLINE> ALTERNATIVE CARE EDGES INTO MEDICAL MAINSTREAM ; HEALTH : HOSPITAL CONGLOMERATE OFFERS INDIAN FOLK TREATMENTS . THE RESULTS INTEREST U.S._GOVERNMENT , INSURANCE INDUSTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The regimen is very Californian : Hot oil massages . Aroma therapy . A special diet tailored to the season and your particular dosha ( body_type ) . Doses of yoga , meditation and other mental exercises to cleanse the mind . Sounds right at_home in Southern California , fertile territory for every alternative medical treatment from acupuncture to Zen . But the spin here is that the 6 # 000-year-old form of Indian folk medicine called ayurveda is now available at the Sharp Institute for Human Potential and Mind-Body Medicine , an offshoot of the Sharp HealthCare medical conglomerate , a charter_member of the medical Establishment . Sharp operates a string of good , gray hospitals where Marcus Welby would feel right at_home . Dr. Welby ' s world is changing . Alternative_medicine , once relegated to free clinics and storefront practitioners , is slowly gaining acceptance within the mainstream . A widely quoted study in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that a third of Americans spend $ 14 billion a year on alternative medical methods . Eighty percent of those continue to see their regular doctors , a strategy that fits with how the Sharp institute sees ayurveda blending with conventional treatment . Through aggressive marketing and adroit deal-making , the not-for-profit Sharp chain -- which includes six hospitals , 18 clinics and five affiliated medical groups -- has come_to dominate the hospital market in affluent and conservative San Diego County . Sharp executives are determined that Sharp will be a major player in the alternative_medicine market . And to lead the charge , Sharp has teamed_up with New Age superstar Dr. Deepak Chopra , the nation ' s best known pitchman for the notion that thinking healthy is the first_step toward being healthy and that toxic emotions are as deadly as carcinogens . The federal_government , which holds the purse_strings for medical research , is watching for signs of success at the Sharp Institute . So too is the insurance industry , which has shown flickers of interest in paying_for alternative care . Dr. James S . Gordon , a clinical professor of psychiatry and family medicine at Georgetown University and an adviser to the federal_government on alternative_medicine , said the creation of the Sharp Institute is an important development in the movement to incorporate alternative methods into current medical_practices . Sharp Chief_Executive_Officer Peter Ellsworth thinks the mind-body devotees just might be_on to something important that could reduce the American dependence on surgery and drugs . In other words , more massages and meditation just might mean fewer bypass operations and prescriptions for blood_pressure pills . Ellsworth is bullish on mind-body but careful not to make claims about its effectiveness that cannot be substantiated . He feels that Sharp , with its large patient base , is the perfect place to assess the mind-body theories . &quot; There is something there , &quot; Ellsworth said , &quot; but we don ' t know what. &quot; He makes two points quickly : One , that mind-body therapies supplement conventional treatment , they do not replace it . And two , that mind-body may offer a solution to the nation ' s runaway medical costs . &quot; If this country does not address lifestyle abuse , we are going_to keep running_out of money regardless of how we change the system , &quot; Ellsworth said . Dr. David Simon , the board-certified neurologist and meditation master who serves as the institute ' s medical director , is convinced that ayurveda , or something like it , is the future . &quot; People want their physicians to be more_than just technicians of illness , &quot; he said . &quot; They want them to be educators about health. &quot; Simon , who was chief_of_staff for two years at Sharp-Cabrillo Hospital , became interested in meditation in medical_school : &quot; I realized that conventional Western medicine often lacks human values. &quot; To spread the gospel of ayurveda , Chopra and Simon keep an ambitious lecture schedule that includes seminars for health_professionals and lectures for prospective patients . Chopra ' s books and tapes extolling ayurveda ( from the Sanskrit words for health and life ) are perennial bestsellers . His credentials and celebrity have brought him invitations to chat with Oprah , Donahue and Geraldo , and to lecture at Harvard Medical_School and hospitals throughout the world . &quot; We ' re very close to a critical mass in mainstream medicine and mainstream America of people who are interested in consciousness , &quot; Chopra said . &quot; The medical_profession and the intellectuals are always behind the times. &quot; * For the first time , the federal_government is funding research into the effectiveness of alternative_medicine , particularly in the areas of stress , chronic pain and life-threatening illnesses . Nudged by a senator intrigued by bee pollen treatments for allergy sufferers , the National Institutes of Health in 1992 opened an Office of Alternative_Medicine . The research budget_for 1994 is a modest $ 3.5 million . Thirty researchers and institutions -- including Sharp ' s mind-body institute -- were selected from among 452 applicants for grants of up_to $ 30 # 000 each . Included for funding were projects testing acupuncture , hypnosis to relieve pain and heal bones , massage therapy for surgical patients , dance movement for cystic_fibrosis , macrobiotic treatments for cancer , biofeedback for diabetes , yoga for heroin_addiction , tai chi for balance disorders and massage therapy for AIDS babies . The NIH definition of alternative_medicine is any method that is not taught in medical_schools , not covered by insurance , and not considered to have sufficient documentation in the United States to prove its safety and effectiveness . The NIH grant will allow the Sharp Institute to study two groups of patients : one that follows Western practices of diet and exercise , one that is dedicated to ayurveda . After a year the two groups will be compared on the basis of blood_pressure , cholesterol , weight and stress . Along with Sharp , other researchers and hospitals are exploring the heretofore off-limits world of alternative_medicine : * Columbia University ' s College of Physicians and Surgeons has begun evaluating scientific and anecdotal evidence about the effectiveness of alternative_medicine . * The Chicago Holistic Center announced a cooperative agreement with a community hospital in Chicago whereby doctors can consult with alternative practitioners . * Stanford_University medical_school professor Dr. David Spiegel , in his book , &quot; Living Beyond Limits : New Hope and Help for Facing Life-Threatening Illness , &quot; described his studies of women with breast_cancer that found that women with strong support groups live longer than those without . In one of Spiegel ' s studies , group therapy and hypnosis helped reduce the pain of women with advanced breast_cancer . Other studies cited by Spiegel , a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences , have shown that depression can suppress the immune_system and that prolactin , a stress hormone , might be a cause of prostate and breast_cancer . Spiegel notes a &quot; small but growing body of evidence &quot; that psychological and social factors can help fight illness . Spiegel wrote , &quot; It is not simply that mind can triumph over matter , but that mind matters. &quot; * In San Diego , an introductory session for mind-body treatment can begin with a two-hour evaluation by an ayurvedic practitioner for about $ 250 . Half a dozen practitioners are aligned with the Sharp institute and take referrals . Aroma therapy consists_of sniffing your favorite fruits , flowers , resins and barks . Music and sound therapy provides melodious chords to reach your inner being . Incidentals such_as massage oils and Chopra ' s books and tapes are extra . A panchaka , or purification treatment , goes_for $ 825 for three days , $ 1 # 125 for five . For those who want to know more before committing their bodies and checkbooks , the institute is developing a series of eight two-hour lectures , &quot; From Prevention to Renewal . The 8-Step Guide to Physical , Mental and Spiritual Well-Being , &quot; to be held at Sharp . For patients seeking the deluxe treatment , a one-week stay_at the swank Inn L ' Auberge in Del Mar ( the institute offices are just down the block ) goes_for $ 3 # 250 . In the next year , Simon foresees holding seminars for doctors in specialties such_as oncology , cardiology , gastroenterology and obstetrics . Half of the patients who have contacted the institute in the past year in search of mind-body treatments , Simon said , are probably looking_for a spa-like rejuvenation . The other half have chronic medical problems , including AIDS . Kathryn Duckworth , 52 , of Lakeside decided to try the Sharp Institute when conventional methods had failed her . She had seen Chopra on &quot; The Phil Donahue Show. &quot; She had been diagnosed several years before as having fibromyalgia , an exceedingly painful muscular disease of mysterious origins that predominantly strikes women between 30 and 50 . At the institute , Duckworth was diagnosed as a vata , one of the three basic constitutional types , or doshas . The typical vata is lean , restless and prone to insomnia . A vata should eat rice and wheat but stay_away_from corn , rye and oats . A vata is advised to eat cooked vegetables , not raw , and to favor avocados , bananas and berries over apples and pears , according to a handbook given to patients . Duckworth was sent home with a daily regimen tailored to vatas and three months later she returned for three two-hour tuneups called panchakarma . &quot; These things have made_it possible for me to have a life again , &quot; said Duckworth . For the first time in years she is virtually pain-free . An articulate and cautious woman , Duckworth probably would have been leery of a mind-body clinic if it smacked of flakiness or experimentation . But she lost all reluctance when she found that the institute is affiliated with Sharp . She is undisturbed that there is almost no Western scientific evidence to support the techniques of Chopra . &quot; I don ' t care , &quot; Duckworth said . &quot; I ' m living proof . It works for me . Western medicine wasn ' t working. &quot; * Chopra and Sharp have come under strong , if narrowly based , criticism from within the medical_profession . Two devoted quackery hunters have put Chopra near the top of their lists . &quot; I think he ' s nothing but a promoter of Chopra , &quot; said William Jarvis , a professor of public health at Loma Linda University and president of the National Council Against Health Fraud . &quot; As far as ayurvedic medicine is concerned , all Chopra is doing is promoting prescientific nonsense in the name of medicine. &quot; Jarvis is no less displeased with Sharp and Ellsworth , the chief_executive_officer . &quot; I don ' t understand the thinking of a hospital administrator who uses pseudo-science as a marketing tactic for good medicine , &quot; he said . &quot; I think that ' s irresponsible. &quot; Stephen Barrett , a retired physician from Allentown , Pa. , and author of &quot; The Health Robbers : A Close Look_at Quackery in America , &quot; devotes a chapter to Chopra and ayurvedic medicine in an upcoming book . He takes particular aim at the notion that all people can be classified as vata , pitta or kapha and treated accordingly . &quot; It ' s absurd , &quot; Jarvis said . Chopra and editors at the Journal of the American Medical Assn . engaged in a public and nasty dispute that began in 1991 when Chopra and two other Indian-born doctors published an article in JAMA that discussed ayurvedic medicine in glowing terms . JAMA later printed a lengthy clarification saying that if the editors had known of the trio ' s supposed financial stake in selling ayurvedic products , they would not have published the article . Months later a JAMA editor published a lengthy , exhaustively documented article that , in_effect , accused the trio of doing nothing more_than peddling warmed-over transcendental meditation with no scientific basis . Chopra was a devotee of TM guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi until the two split in the early 1990s . Chopra struck back at JAMA with a lawsuit and accused it of reacting like an intolerant religion trying to stamp_out heresy . The suit has since been dismissed , but Chopra remains furious at JAMA , and there is no indication that JAMA has softened its view of Chopra . Like everybody else in organized medicine , Simon and Ellsworth were aware of Chopra ' s dispute with JAMA before they recruited him for Sharp . &quot; He definitely pushes the envelope , &quot; Simon said .</TEXT>
