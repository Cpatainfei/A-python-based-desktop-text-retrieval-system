   <HEADLINE> EX-CLINTON AIDE FACES S &amp; L CASE SUBPOENA ; WHITEWATER : FBI FOCUSES ON WHAT CHIEF OF STAFF TO THEN-ARKANSAS GOVERNOR KNOWS OF THRIFT OWNER ' S ROLE IN THE PAYING OFF OF A $ 50 # 000 LOAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The FBI has notified Betsey Wright , a senior aide to President Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas , that she will receive a grand_jury subpoena in the expanding investigation of Clinton ' s business dealings with the owner of a failed savings and loan , Wright acknowledged Friday . The FBI also subpoenaed documents this week from a small Arkansas bank that loaned Clinton and his wife , Hillary Rodham Clinton , $ 50 # 000 to help finance his 1984 campaign_for_governor . The subpoenas are part of a wide-ranging federal investigation into ties between the Clintons and their former business partner , James B . McDougal , the owner of the now-defunct Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan here . Numerous questions have been raised about whether the Clintons and McDougal improperly benefited financially from the relationship and Atty . Gen . Janet Reno is preparing to appoint a special counsel to investigate the_matter . The primary focus of the investigation is the Whitewater Development Corp. , a partnership formed by the Clintons and McDougal in 1978 to develop 200 acres of resort land in the Ozark Mountains . The Clintons have said that they lost $ 68 # 900 in the venture but key records apparently are missing and FBI_agents have been trying to reconstruct the finances of the project . Among some of the questions investigators hope to answer is whether McDougal received political favors in exchange for helping the Clintons pay_off the $ 50 # 000 loan . McDougal has told reporters that he staged a fund-raiser in 1985 to help retire the debt . Investigators apparently believe that Wright may be able to shed_light_on the loan issue . She attended the 1985 fund-raiser as then-Gov . Clinton ' s chief_of_staff and helped collect $ 35 # 000 toward the loan repayment . Although campaign laws require such contributions to be reported to the state , the list of contributors to the Madison Guaranty fund-raiser has disappeared and Wright has said that she does not know what happened to it . Wright acknowledged Friday that the FBI had informed her this week that she would be subpoenaed . She also said , however , that she was told the subpoena had been withdrawn temporarily pending the naming of the special counsel . In anticipation of the subpoena , Wright said that she moved several boxes of documents from her office at the Wexler Group , a Washington lobbying firm and part of the_Hill &amp; Knowlton communications firm , to her Washington home . She said that she plans to sort through the material over the weekend . &quot; I will be happy to help anyone to get the history sorted_out , &quot; Wright said . She declined to disclose the nature of the material sought by the FBI or the types of documents she said she is examining . However , during the 1992 presidential campaign , Wright collected numerous documents to rebut questions raised then about the Clintons ' involvement with McDougal . The Whitewater case is not the first White_House controversy in which Wright has become involved . Last month , she took_time_off from her lobbying job to help senior presidential aide Bruce Lindsey coordinate the White_House response to allegations made against the President by two Arkansas state_troopers . They claimed that the President offered them federal jobs to discourage them from speaking publicly about his alleged extramarital affairs while he was governor . FBI_agents also served a new subpoena this week on the small Arkansas bank that actually made the $ 50 # 000 loan to the Clintons in 1984 , in an apparent attempt to uncover the loan ' s paper trail . The institution -- the Bank of Cherry Valley -- was owned in part by W . Maurice Smith , a former member of Clinton ' s staff . There was no collateral for the loan , which was used by Clinton to bolster his gubernatorial campaign in its final days . Smith , later named by Clinton to head the Arkansas highway department , is a longtime friend and political confidant of the President . According to Wright , he was Clinton ' s mentor and &quot; like a father &quot; to the young Arkansas politician . Federal investigators examining the failure of Madison Guaranty suspect that some of the money raised by McDougal may actually have come from the savings and loan ' s funds , sources said . The White_House has said that Clinton and his campaign would have had no way of knowing the origin of the contributions . Leon Foust , the president of the First Bank of Arkansas , which bought the Bank of Cherry Valley , confirmed Friday that the institution has received three subpoenas in recent weeks from FBI_agents , the most recent coming Wednesday . Foust declined to discuss the nature of the material sought by the subpoenas . But a knowledgeable source said that the FBI is seeking bank records related to the Clintons ' loan and checks used to pay it off in 1985 . Sources said that investigators also are interested in checks sent to the Bank of Cherry Valley from the Whitewater Development Corp . account at Madison Guaranty . Some records have been located and turned_over to the FBI , Foust said , and bank staff_members are trying to find additional material . &quot; We ' ve complied with the subpoenas to the best of our ability and we are still searching for records , &quot; Foust said . The possibility that Madison Guaranty funds were contributed to Clinton ' s campaign is one of several questions expected to be examined by the special counsel . Special correspondent Michael J . Goodman contributed to this story . * FEW FOLLOW PROBE : Survey finds that few people are paying much attention to Whitewater investigation . A17</TEXT>
