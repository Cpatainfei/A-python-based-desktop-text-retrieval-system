   <HEADLINE> NUTRITIONAL ROLE SEEN IN SPREAD OF AIDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Selenium , a nutrient found in whole grains and seafood , could help prolong the lives of people who test positive for the AIDS virus , a researcher said Friday . University of Georgia researcher Will Taylor said an analysis of the genetic code of HIV , published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry , suggests a key role for selenium in the biochemical makeup of the human_immunodeficiency_virus . A potential role for the chemical_element could help explain the spread of AIDS among Haitians , intravenous drug_users and Africans , many of whom suffer from chronic malnutrition . &quot; Selenium levels in the diet could be a factor_in the time it takes_to develop full-blown AIDs . If you have a better selenium status , that could be a factor , &quot; said Taylor , who bases his hypothesis on research conducted through computer simulations . &quot; All the evidence we have for this , at this point , is totally theoretical . But it is pretty compelling theoretical evidence and it is consistent with pre-existing evidence. &quot; Selenium , which researchers believe has both anti-cancer and antiviral effects , is an antioxidant which helps maintain the function of immune cells . The link between the nutrient and acquired immune deficiency syndrome has been known for some time . But researchers up_to now have viewed selenium depletion among AIDS sufferers as a symptom of problems in absorbing nutrients . Because selenium also can be toxic , however , researchers advise people to use supplements only after consulting their physicians . &quot; Our work says that there may be a more direct link between the HIV virus and selenium than was previously suspected , &quot; said Taylor .</TEXT>
