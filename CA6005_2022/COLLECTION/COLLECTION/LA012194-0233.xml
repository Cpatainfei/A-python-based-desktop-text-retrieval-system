   <HEADLINE> MAKEUP TESTS ; FOR TEEN-AGE GIRLS , PLAYING WITH COSMETICS IS A RITE OF PASSAGE . MOMS ENDURE IT . DADS HATE IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When I was a teen-ager , I had to buy orange-flavored Tangee lipstick and liquid black eyeliner on the sly and sneak it out of the house . I ' d spend a good 20 minutes in the girls ' bath room at school painting on the forbidden makeup . Twiggy lashes take time . Then , on the bus ride home , I ' d scrape it all off with a dry tissue . My friends were doing the same thing , and it wasn ' t pretty . Fortunately , makeup styles have lightened_up since the high-contrast embalmed look of my day . So have many mothers ' rules prohibiting makeup . But the practice of friends copying friends ' makeup hasn ' t changed a bit . As it has gotten easier for girls making the transition to young womanhood to call attention to their metamorphosis , it has become makeup makers ' mission to hook them early . After all , women tend to remain loyal to the brands of their youth . And Americans ages 12 to 19 spent $ 89 billion last year on products and services of all kinds , according to Teenage Research Unlimited of Northbrook , Ill . Give a teen-age girl $ 50 and she ' ll buy jeans or sneakers ; give her $ 15 and she ' ll spend it on CDs , tapes and cosmetics , reports Los Angeles-based Teen magazine , whose average reader is , demographically speaking , 15.4 years old . That first tube of Erase or Wet N ' Wild lipstick is the seed that grows like Jack ' s beanstalk into a makeup collection overflowing drawers , cabinets and handbags . Teen-agers may be ready and willing to begin the cosmetic-enriched life -- dated by lipstick tubes -- but they can be a tough bunch to reach . Word_of_mouth carries much more weight than any advertising_campaign , cosmetics makers say . Mary Kay aggressively courts the teen market through mother-daughter skin-care and make-over classes . &quot; We also work with cheerleading camps , targeting opinion leaders , &quot; says Curran Dandurand , vice_president of the Dallas-based cosmetics firm . To encourage girl talk_about its products , Lancome plans to put trial-size packets of its Maquimat foundation in a spring issue of Seventeen magazine , whose pass-along rate ( number of readers per copy ) is higher than that of most other teen magazines , says Karen Young , vice_president of the New York-based company . &quot; ( The foundation ) is lightweight , fairly sheer , and the price is $ 20 for an ounce . Plus it comes_in a tube , which is perfect for a young market . A teen-age girl can try it and get a feel_for the product. &quot; Teen-agers certainly like to feel the product . A 1991 Maybelline study found that girls apply lipstick 2.6 times a day , lip gloss 2.7 times , mascara 1.2 times and blush 1.5 times . &quot; If they don ' t experiment with makeup when they are teens , they do really heinous things ( later on ) that look disturbing to people in their workplace , &quot; says B.J. Gillian , a makeup artist and spokesperson for Cover_Girl . Most of the lab work for perfecting a look happens in middle_school , he notes . &quot; In the past , people got_it together and toned_down their look by the first year of college . Now , most high_school students have a lighter hand . The festive interpretations , the ones where they apply ( makeup ) with a trowel , are seen in junior high. &quot; Of the many teen magazines currently endorsing the oxymoronic &quot; natural makeup &quot; look , at least one has the decency to point_out that it takes as much work to create subtle style as it does a flagrant one . An article titled &quot; The Naked Truth About the Natural Look &quot; appears in the January issue of Seventeen , whose readers are mostly in their early teens . But over at YM ( Young &amp; Modern ) , which also caters to girls barely into their double-digits , the text touts big , bright-red lips in &quot; Lip Reading : What Your Lipstick Says About Your Personality. &quot; ( A sample : &quot; If you love tomato-red lipstick . . . you ' re adventurous , and you love experimenting with new trends and ideas. &quot; Like their peers elsewhere , Los Angeles-area teen-agers often wear as much lipstick on their orthodontia as they do on their lips . A look_around any middle_school will turn_up fresh-faced girls who don ' t own makeup yet , those who own it but don ' t regularly wear it , and , of course , serious abusers . &quot; They ' re just trying to show_off to their friends , &quot; says 11-year-old ( &quot; almost 12 &quot; ) Dalia Regos , a sixth-grader at Paul Revere Middle_School in Pacific Palisades , of peers who are a tad too liberal with the eye shadow . &quot; They keep mirrors in their lockers and they put it on all day. &quot; * If mothers don ' t approve , they may have only themselves to blame . Girls ' first makeup often comes_in a mother-daughter rite of passage . Dalia ' s mother , Nancy Regos , allowed her daughter to start wearing makeup to school this year . &quot; She doesn ' t use unusual amounts , &quot; Regos says , &quot; and there are occasions when I ask her not to wear any , like when she sees her grandmother. &quot; Dalia ' s personal stock of cosmetics -- lipsticks , eye shadows , clear and navy_blue mascaras , and blush -- is a mix of hand-me-downs from mom and her own purchases . Even with that arsenal , she looks as if she spends more time playing with dolls than with cosmetics . Adina Brown , 11 , inherited her first eye shadows and blush from her older sister . And her mom gave her a lipstick that was left in a car and melted . &quot; I can ' t roll it up , but I can use my fingers to put it on , &quot; the Calabasas sixth-grader says with a shrug . Some mothers not only pass along their old makeup but also buy new items for their daughters . Kim Clerx , 14 , of Woodland Hills , occasionally wears Borghese cosmetics . &quot; Lipstick and foundation . I asked my mom for some makeup and that ' s what she got me , &quot; she says . It ' s Kim ' s dad who sometimes disapproves of her lipstick , no matter the shade , she says : &quot; ( Fathers ) don ' t want to see their babies growing up. &quot; Terry Huettinger , 15 , of Woodland Hills , drags her mom off to Thrifty , K mart or Target every three months to ante_up $ 20 for Maybelline eye products , lipsticks and Cover_Girl foundation . She exhibits a trait common among women : They stay true_to their foundation and mascara . &quot; No matter what their age , women will absolutely not swap their foundation or mascara , &quot; says Young of Lancome . Color products such_as eye shadows , nail_polishes and blushers tend to be impulse buys . &quot; I often see mothers and daughters together at the mid-priced Estee Lauder , Origins and M.A.C counters , &quot; says Jackie Kolla , cosmetic buyer for Nordstrom . &quot; The moms are comfortable with their daughters wearing makeup , and they help them pick_out colors and experiment . The girls ' biggest concern seems to be skin_care and covering blemishes ; they are always interested in concealers or foundations. &quot; M.A.C ( Makeup Art Cosmetics ) has a rabid teen-age following . What ? Never heard of it ? The line is sold in two eponymous Los Angeles stores and in Nordstrom . It ' s the cosmetic of choice on the set of &quot; Beverly Hills , 90210. &quot; Gordon Espinet , senior technical trainer for M.A.C , says girls constantly stream into the stores asking , &quot; What color did Tori ( Spelling ) wear_on last night ' s show ? &quot; Although M.A.C doesn ' t advertise , it ' s a hot item with the Alpha teens , a group of too-cool kids who signal trends for the Zandl Group , a New York City tracker of buying trends . &quot; It ' s part of the teen collective , it ' s all word_of_mouth , &quot; Espinet says . And the opinions of one ' s peers still mean the most . &quot; I used to wear a really dark_red lipstick , everyone was complaining -- my family , neighbors , my aunt and uncle . A baby cousin even asked what happened to my lips . that ' s when I changed to a lighter color , &quot; says Leyna Gravitt , 13 , a Woodland Hills eighth-grader . But , Leyna admits , had her best_friend told her she was making a cosmetic misstep , she would have switched_on the spot . &quot; Rachel , I ' d listen to Rachel , &quot; she says , throwing her arm around her dear friend .</TEXT>
