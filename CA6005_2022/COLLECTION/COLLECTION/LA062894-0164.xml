   <HEADLINE> JIM MURRAY : IT ' S NOT A GAME , IT ' S A RELIGION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Listen , did you ever hear of a World_Series War ? How about a Super Bowl War ? The Final Four War ? Can you imagine the United States marching into Canada because the Toronto Blue_Jays beat the Phillies or Braves in the World_Series ? Picture us bombing Ottawa because they just won a mere playoff_game over , say , Detroit ? You ' ve heard of the Gulf War , but what if we had a Golf War ? What if England blockaded our East Coast ports because we ' d won the_British Open ? Opened unrestricted submarine warfare on us for a Tennis War if Pete Sampras won Wimbledon again ? Of course , it ' s far-fetched . Of course , it won ' t happen . But let me tell you of a sport in which it actually did happen -- World Cup soccer . It actually started a war . That might be all you have to know about World Cup soccer and the passions it arouses . It ' s not a game , it ' s a religion . A holy calling . For God , country and glory . It was 1970 when the so-called &quot; Soccer War &quot; complicated life on the planet . Wars used to be started when archdukes got bombs thrown at them , or subs sank ocean_liners , or territorial disputes erupted or ideologies clashed . This one started over a game . Honduras and El_Salvador were trying to qualify for the World Cup , when such brawling broke_out that it spilled_over into all-out armed conflict , the Soccer War . Salvadoran troops invaded and after two weeks of bloody fighting , 2 # 000 lay dead and thousands more wounded . It was hardly soccer ' s finest hour , but it was indicative_of the feelings that run so high in this quadrennial international blood-letting . Let no man think World Cup soccer is merely another game , a sporting event , an afternoon in the park . It ' s World_War III . Can you picture President Clinton pulling the Philadelphia Phillies to one side before the World_Series and promising them new Mercedes-Benz cars if they triumphed and , alternately , threatening to fire the coach if they didn ' t ? Well , King Fahd of Saudi_Arabia has no compunctions about doing something similar . The George Steinbrenner of the Middle_East , he fires coaches ( and players ) at will . If his interventions are subject_to criticism , well , Saudi_Arabia is in the World Cup , isn ' t it ? And England isn ' t . You can see the World Cup is not exactly sport . Soccerites don ' t get paid like their American athletic counterparts . Like Americans , they are venturing into the areas of bonuses and other rewards . But , in_general , Brits earn around $ 75 # 000 a year , with bonuses ranging around $ 1 # 000 per individual achievement and , sometimes , almost double their salaries for the equivalent of a league pennant . German players of star quality earn around $ 200 # 000 a year with incentive bonuses . Italy pays the highest salaries . There , star players can average $ 1.5 million . Spain has entered the bidding field for central European stars lured out of Bulgaria and what ' s left of Yugoslavia with $ 2-million contracts . In South_America , the ante is lower , with players getting no more_than $ 60 # 000 a season plus bonuses . In Africa , the players seem to be raised for export only . Hardly_a European club is without an African or two . Recruitment is easy . The condition of the pay scale on the Dark Continent can be seen in the activities of the Cameroon squad , which threatened to boycott its game with Brazil last week . ( Brazil didn ' t seem to notice whether the Indomitable Lions showed_up or not , beating them , 3-0 , which , in soccer , passes for a landslide. ) The Cameroon players were mutinous because a government representative who was supposed to show_up with a satchelful of bonus money for them seemed to have been delayed in transit . That , too , is World Cup soccer . The Cameroon soccer foundation countered with a demand that the suspected clubhouse lawyer in the case , the goalkeeper , Joseph-Antoine Bell , be removed from the team . The lack of faith of the Cameroon players in their federation is understandable . Its electricity in the recent past has been shut_off for non-payment of bills . They don ' t want to be the first_team in the history of the World Cup ( which hit the soccer fields 60 years after Edison ' s invention ) to have to practice by candlelight . Of course , a certain amount of eccentricity is to be expected of a sport whose participants regularly hit the ball with their heads . I mean , how ' d you like to get banged over the head 10 or 15 times a game with a 14- to 16-ounce leather-covered ( or high-tech plastic-covered ) sphere inflated to 13 pounds of pressure ? Some brain damage is to be expected . The biggest mystery to Americans is the lack of scoring , which has degenerated from a 5.4 average in the 1954 games to about 2.2 today . My granddaughter , Danica Erin , took_notice of this for me when she observed the dimensions of the goal . &quot; It seems big enough to put a lot of balls in , &quot; she said . Exactly . It ' s eight yards wide by eight feet high . You think Wayne Gretzky would n ' t like to have that target to shoot at ? Instead of his net , four feet high by six feet wide ? You would think 20 goals a game would be poured through an opening you could drive a car through . But the weekend games produced four shutouts and one 2-1 game . Clearly , World Cup needs a World scorer . A Babe_Ruth . Although the whole world participates , only six countries have won World Cups in the 64 years of its existence . One of them -- Argentina , Brazil , Germany or Italy -- figures to win again this year . The two others -- England and Uruguay -- aren ' t even here . World Cup has many pluses , not the least of which is no TV commercials . Play is continuous . No timeouts . Nothing stops the clock . Like that battery rabbit , it just keeps going and going . No out-of-bounds stoppages , no endless meetings of officials to discuss the rules . None of the ludicrousness of pro basketball , in which the last 40 seconds of a game can last up_to a half an hour or more . The clock keeps moving right through every incident , including that of a player lying on the ground , either injured or faking it , and whatever playing time is lost is tacked_on at the end of the half or the game . In our pro football , a phalanx of doctors and trainers scrambles onto the field if a player has a cut lip , and the clock stops while a grateful television seizes the time to slip_in a half_dozen or so commercials , network promos or similar nuisances . It has not yet become the Dodge Truck or the Pizza Hut World Cup . The host country has won five of the 14 Cups . Might not be the way to bet this year . These Yankees are not Murderers ' Row . But these coaches will do anything to win this real_World Series , this true Super Bowl . In a book on the history of the sport , they tell the story of the striker who took too many balls to the head and fell . &quot; He ' s got a concussion . He doesn ' t know who he is any more , &quot; the coach was told . &quot; Good ! &quot; he answered . &quot; Tell him he ' s Pele. &quot;</TEXT>
