   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : MID-CITY : WINDSOR SQUARE ; CHURCH STRUGGLES TO RECOVER FROM FIRE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The congregation of the Wilshire United Methodist_Church today will celebrate the eighth Sunday service since a fire gutted much of its historic building , and church leaders say they are still unsure what type of recovery effort they will mount . The June 6 fire that caused an estimated $ 120 # 000 in damage is still being investigated by fire officials , and the church ' s senior pastor , the Rev . Chang Soon Lee , said discussions are continuing with insurance_company officials . In the meantime , Lee said , most services have been moved from the fire-scarred church , at 4350 Wilshire Blvd. , to the vacant Scottish Rite Masonic Temple across the street . The questions that remain for the 1 # 200-member congregation are how to rebuild and whether any recovery effort could coincide with a much-needed church expansion . Also , in the short term , there is the issue of continuing the church ' s myriad activities with limited room . &quot; We are still in the primitive stages of recovery , &quot; Lee said . &quot; The physical recovery may be going slow , but we are not discouraged spiritually. &quot; The electrical fire swept_through the church ' s Fellowship Hall and the 68-year-old sanctuary , destroying a large pipe_organ , the machinery that operates the church ' s chimes , banners , decorative rails and items used during services . Attorney Willie Barnes , who leads the church ' s fledgling recovery committee , said leaders would be meeting with insurance_company representatives and some general contractors this week to survey the damage and repairs . Church leaders have noted the need for an expansion for several years , and Barnes said if financing is available the church might consider combining that project with the recovery effort . &quot; that ' s a long way off , though , and it would require approval from several levels , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s very early in the process. &quot; The chief concern for church leaders in the meantime is to keep the church ' s activities running smoothly . It has not been easy . A shortage of elbow_room has programs vying for space . Besides Sunday_school_classes , the church has a variety of clubs and plays host to a long list of community groups , from the Cub_Scouts to Alcoholics Anonymous . Compounding the juggling problem , the congregation has to contend with some communication challenges because of its diversity . Services are held_in four languages -- English , Korean , Tagalog and Spanish -- and worshipers hail from 40 different nations , church leaders said . &quot; That variety makes some things difficult , but it is also what makes us great , &quot; said Lydia Martinez , pastor for the church ' s Spanish-speaking branch . &quot; It calls_for a lot of energy on our part to keep things organized , but it also provides us with a lot of creativity. &quot; Last Christmas , for example , the church put_on a stage re-enactment of the manger scene , with Latino angels , Korean wise_men and a Filipino infant portraying the infant Jesus . &quot; That makes a theological statement , the church as a world community , and it shows the future of the church today . that ' s our strength. &quot; GEOFF BOUCHER</TEXT>
