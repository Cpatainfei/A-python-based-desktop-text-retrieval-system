   <HEADLINE> ' 3 STRIKES ' LAW GOOD ONLY FOR VIOLENT FELONS ; LIFE FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS COULD FREE WORSE CRIMINALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nickname given to each of the efforts designed to put career criminals behind bars for life comes from the old baseball term &quot; three strikes and you ' re out. &quot; California already has an overly broad &quot; three strikes &quot; law on the books that could create as_many problems as it would solve . There is another ill-conceived &quot; three strikes &quot; measure on the November ballot . The Reynolds initiative , as it is termed , would mandate life imprisonment without parole for a third conviction on any one of several felonies . Reynolds is a bad idea because it would be embedded in the state Constitution and could be amended only by a two-thirds popular vote . But it is also a bad idea because it , too , is so broad that it could wind_up pushing extremely violent felons out of prison . . . to make room for less violent and even nonviolent ones . In fact , it is that very important &quot; you ' re out &quot; part of all this that we are concerned with here . It ' s easy for politicians and for the rest of us to jump_on the &quot; lock ' em up and throw_away the key &quot; bandwagon , but something has to give if that happens . Somewhat neglected in the debate , for example , are two possible results and two alternatives . One is an immensely larger prison system , more costly as well by several billions of dollars . The other is a greatly expanded parole office system , where all_the ex-cons must gather from time to time to prove that they are having a positive impact on society , or at least a non-impact . Just where are all those parole offices going_to be , and who is going_to even begrudgingly accept such facilities as neighbors ? Consider , for example , the recent brouhaha over the placement of an office in Sherman Oaks for some 4 # 100 parolees from state_prisons who now live_in the San Fernando Valley . News of the office ' s impending arrival mobilized the citizenry in Sherman Oaks , and their outrage prompted officials to cancel the decision . It turned_out that the placement violated the state ' s own guidelines for keeping such facilities at least one-quarter of a mile away from schools and parks . Still , many_more parole offices may be_on the way , perhaps to a street near you . Why ? Well , let ' s consider the unenviable choices created by overly broad life imprisonment legislation . As of March , there were at least 30 # 000 felons in California , all standing in their respective batters ' boxes with two strikes against them and counting , all facing the potential of life imprisonment if they make one more bad swing . The prisons also are jammed . Just 12 years ago , there were only 18 # 000 inmates in the entire California penal system . Today , that population stands at more_than 120 # 000 . It could cost as much as $ 21 billion if we decide to build new prisons for the estimated 109 # 000 additional inmates anticipated by the turn_of_the_century . This is in a state where the economy continues to sputter like a car badly in need of higher octane fuel , a state where too few are willing to ante_up even for schools or earthquake repairs . And if we don ' t spend the money on new prisons , it will mean that more of those in prison now will have to be released to make room for those who will be incarcerated for life under &quot; three strikes. &quot; That means busier parole offices , and more of them . The uproar over that Sherman Oaks site won ' t hold a candle to that , not in a region where people are so litigious that they will go_to_war over the placement of a drive-thru doughnut shop around the block . Think_of all these unintended consequences . It ' s enough to make us take a very restrained approach to &quot; three strikes. &quot; It is why we have supported versions that would reserve life imprisonment without parole only for repeat violent offenders . that ' s what we all want to accomplish . That is what is manageable , and affordable .</TEXT>
