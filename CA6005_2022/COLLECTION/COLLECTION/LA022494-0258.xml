She missed twice on the rifle_range and finished in 26 minutes 8.8 seconds , nosing_out Svetlana Paramygina of Belarus . Paramygina also missed twice . Valentyna Tserbe of Ukraine won the bronze when Inna Sheshikl of Kazakhstan fell two yards from the finish . The race included two stops at the range for a round each of prone and standing shooting . A penalty lap was skied for each miss . In the men ' s race , a 10-kilometer sprint , Tchepikov ' s perfect shooting put him in prime position , then he skiied a fast final segment and knocked Ricco Gross of Germany out of the victory . Both Tchepikov and Gross shot clean in their two visits to the range , five shots each prone and standing . But Tchepikov , who was third in this race at Calgary in 1988 , finished in 28 minutes 7 seconds , six seconds faster than Gross . Sergei Tarasov , also of Russia , winner of the 20k last Sunday , won the bronze . * Japan practically assured itself of the gold medal in team Nordic combined , taking a big lead over Norway in the ski_jumping portion off the normal hill . Takanori Kono ' s 330-foot jump , the longest in either the individual or team combined event , helped Japan to a 61.5-point lead , which means the Japanese will start today ' s 30-kilometer cross-country relay with better than a five-minute advantage . In the team event , each team ' s jumpers get two jumps . Kono jumped 310-2 on his second try , then Kenji Ogiwara gave Japan another boost with a second jump of 316-8 . Japan finished the day with 733.5 points to 672 for Norway and 643.5 for Switzerland . Thursday ' s relay_race will determine the medals .
