   <HEADLINE> KING HUSSEIN STAKES FUTURE ON PEACE TALKS WITH ISRAEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Forty-three years ago , a Palestinian enraged by reports that Jordan ' s King Abdullah was meeting secretly with Israeli leaders shot the elderly Hashemite king dead as he entered Jerusalem ' s Al Aqsa mosque to pray . Standing at Abdullah ' s side when the gunfire erupted was his 15-year-old grandson , Hussein . On Monday , Hussein -- now the Middle_East ' s longest-ruling leader -- intends to openly endorse his grandfather ' s conviction that the Arabs must come_to terms with the Jewish state . For the first time , he will meet publicly with Yitzhak Rabin , joining the Israeli prime_minister for talks with President Clinton at the White_House . Hussein and Rabin , who are thought to have met secretly several times over the tumultuous years during which they have served their nations , are expected to sign agreements laying the groundwork for a formal peace_treaty between Israel and Jordan . They may even sign a declaration of non-belligerency , which would end the official state_of_war between the two nations but fall_short_of a treaty . They also intend to jointly address Congress , and to attend a White_House state dinner . For Israelis and Arabs , their appearances together will hold little of the drama that marked Egyptian President Anwar Sadat ' s historic trip to Jerusalem in 1977 , or Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat ' s handshake with Rabin on the White_House lawn last September . For most Israelis , their government ' s state_of_war with Jordan has been theoretical since the king lost the West_Bank and Arab East Jerusalem to Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War . Israeli newspapers have reported for years on the &quot; secret &quot; meetings between the king and a parade of prime_ministers , and on quiet agreements to secure the border between the two nations and share scarce water resources . And for most Jordanians , the shock of seeing their king meeting with Rabin pales in comparison to seeing Arafat shake Rabin ' s hand . The shock also has been eased in_advance by the lengthy negotiations Jordan and Israel have publicly engaged in since an October , 1991 , peace conference in Madrid . &quot; Yasser Arafat acted_as a shock_absorber for the king , &quot; said Speaker of Parliament Taher Masri in an interview before leaving with Hussein for Washington on Friday . &quot; People feel we have no alternative but to make_peace with the Israelis now that the Palestinians are making_peace with them . They are not happy ; they are not sad . They are almost passive. &quot; But Monday ' s meeting with Rabin is the culmination of a personal journey for Hussein that has led him through civil_war , coup attempts , assassination plots , Arab-Israeli wars and the vagaries of Arab politics for more_than four decades . It is another gamble by a king who has developed acute instincts for sensing the mood of his volatile and often divided nation . &quot; We are moving close to completing a very dear objective , &quot; Hussein said Wednesday after meeting with Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher . Hussein spoke shortly before Christopher flew_by helicopter to the Dead_Sea to preside over another first -- Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres crossing the border to discuss trilateral economic cooperation with Christopher and Jordanian Prime_Minister Abdul Salam Majali . &quot; I am proud_of the reaction of the overwhelming majority of people in this country &quot; to his decision to step_up contacts with the Israelis , Hussein told reporters . There are still worries among the king ' s advisers about the risk Hussein is taking_in accelerating talks with Israel . Syria has criticized the move , as has a coalition of Islamic fundamentalists and Arab nationalist groups within Jordan . Security_forces have stepped_up surveillance of groups considered potential troublemakers . The king decided to make his move now , according to senior Jordanian officials and Western diplomats , because he feared that Israel and the PLO were prepared to cut Jordan out of any arrangements for the future of the West_Bank and Gaza , and he believes that Syria stands on the verge of making_peace with Israel . &quot; What did the king stand to gain by waiting for Syria to go first ? &quot; one Western diplomat asked . &quot; Rightly or wrongly , he was convinced that ( Syrian President Hafez ) Assad was going_to deal , and if Israel achieved peace with Syria , Jordan would have no leverage at all_in its negotiations. &quot; Hussein also is anxious for U.S. aid to ease Jordan ' s economic_crisis and its crushing debt burden . Jordanians are also hoping Washington will pressure Arab Gulf states , still angry with the king for his support of Saddam Hussein during the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War , to resume aid to the kingdom , which has been swamped by Palestinian refugees from Kuwait and suffers high unemployment . &quot; We need to see the Americans deliver on their promises , and soon -- not in 1995 or 1996 , but now , &quot; a senior palace official said . &quot; People need to see that there are results coming from the concessions that Jordan is making. &quot; The people the king is most concerned about are the Islamic fundamentalists who vehemently oppose any dealings with Israel . The Islamists control 17 seats in Jordan ' s lower house of Parliament and are considered a force to be reckoned with in a nation that is overwhelmingly Muslim and deeply conservative . &quot; We at the Islamic Front don ' t agree with anything that ' s going_on , &quot; said Mohammad Owaidah , a member_of_Parliament and assistant director of the Islamic Front , a fundamentalist coalition . &quot; We oppose meeting with Jews , because they are occupying our land , they are torturing our people. &quot; Owaidah , born in what was then Palestine , became a refugee at age 2 when Israel was founded . He has lived_in Jordan ever since . Owaidah said Islamic activists are determined to work against the signing of a peace_treaty &quot; by all means , &quot; but he acknowledged that the government has banned public rallies opposing the king ' s moves and blocks publication of openly anti-peace views in mass-circulation dailies . Still , he said , the Islamic forces intend to use leaflets and Friday prayers at the mosques to get their views across . &quot; We will wait , &quot; Owaidah said . &quot; The greediness of the Jews means that nothing will come of this peace process . People will see that it is false. &quot; Hussein is banking on support from the entrepreneurial class in Jordan , from the rural tribes that have always supported the Hashemites , from Palestinians who want to see self-rule in the occupied territories work . &quot; King Hussein is talking_about doing this because it is in Jordan ' s interests , &quot; the Western diplomat said . &quot; That is a very powerful message here , particularly for East Bank Jordanians , who want the king to look_out for the interests of the kingdom . People tend to believe that if anyone has sold_out the Palestinians , it is Yasser Arafat , not King Hussein . There is a deep loyalty to the king here. &quot; Manal Hamzeh Smadi , a Jordanian from a wealthy Muslim family , is planning to study Hebrew . &quot; I ' m an optimist , &quot; said Smadi , an American-educated audiologist . &quot; I turn_to Israeli TV all_the time . I figure that if I learn the language , I ' ll be able to make friends. &quot;</TEXT>
