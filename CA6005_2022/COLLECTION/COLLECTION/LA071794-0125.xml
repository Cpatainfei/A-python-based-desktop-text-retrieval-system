   <TEXT> * In response to your article &quot; New Shipping Rules Bring Turkey Into Conflict with Russia , Neighbors &quot; ( July 2 ) : Annually over 50 # 000 ships carry their passengers and cargo through the Turkish straits ( Bosporus and Dardanelles ) which connect the Black_Sea to the Mediterranean via the Aegean . For the 10 million residents of Istanbul , the only city in the world which sits astride two continents , the Bosporus Strait is a connecting waterway between the city ' s European and Asian sides.The oil_tanker accident in March in the Bosporus , which caused at least 19 deaths and 10 missing and horrified the city ' s inhabitants , is not the first but the latest example of the kind of the grave danger Istanbul is facing unless navigation is regulated according to the current conditions of the Bosporus Strait . There have been 40 big shipping accidents in and around the Bosporus since 1960 , including the 1979 tanker collision which claimed the lives of 43 seamen . It is for this reason that the Turkish government decided to put into effect new regulations designed to manage safer passage . The narrow Turkish straits are first and foremost a sea corridor , but not a passageway for oil and natural_gas transportation . As long as thousands of tons of such inflammable and explosive materials are shipped in this heavy traffic , other vessels and human lives will remain in constant danger and disastrous accidents will be unavoidable . Therefore , the oil and natural_gas from Central Asia and Azerbaijan should reach the sea via projected pipelines . OGUZ CELIKKOL Consul General of Turkey Los Angeles</TEXT>
