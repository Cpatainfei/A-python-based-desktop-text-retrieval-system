   <HEADLINE> CHURCH LEADERS IN O.C. GRAPPLE WITH PROP . 187 ; RELIGION : THEY OPPOSE THE MEASURE , BUT PASTORS DELIVERING MESSAGE MAY ALIENATE SOME IN CONGREGATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just a_few days shy of a Sunday Mass at St . Mary ' s , the pastor is seething with a quiet indignation more often reserved for mortal_sin than a ballot measure . &quot; I won ' t be mincin ' words on this one , &quot; vowed Father Richard C . Kennedy in the lilting accent of his native Ireland . &quot; I haven ' t worked_out what I ' ll say , but I ' m going_to make_it clear . Proposition 187 is immoral . . . . This thing is completely Godless. &quot; But by the weekend , Kennedy was not ready to deliver his message . He needed more time to reflect and consult with other priests on the perils of staking out a position on the initiative , which would ban most public benefits for illegal immigrants , including education and basic health_care . From pulpits across California , clergy members are suddenly wrestling with political strategy instead of conventional demons . The top leadership of all_the state ' s major religious denominations has attacked Proposition 187 , calling_for compassion while invoking the Bible : &quot; Welcome strangers , for by doing this , some people have entertained angels without knowing it. &quot; Yet it is the foot_soldiers -- the priests , ministers , rabbis , and nuns -- who are delicately trying to deliver the anti-187 message in a fashion that will persuade rather than alienate . The political reality is that members of their congregations feel_like most of the state ' s voters : rightly or wrongly they blame immigrants for many of the state ' s problems and support the initiative . Using the Bible to prick the consciences of church_members , a broad coalition of 60 religious organizations has launched a frantic campaign to woo them with homilies and house_parties , candlelight vigils and forums , Sunday sermons and appeals for compassion from top religious_leaders . The appeals have grown even more passionate as the leaders have warily noted the popularity of the measure in recent polls . &quot; The church needs to be heard on this in public more often . We ' ve got_to define the issue , &quot; said the Rev . Chester Talton , the suffragan_bishop of the six-county Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles . Talton is especially concerned about provisions that cut health and education services to children . &quot; Jesus calls_on us to care_for the child and as we care_for the child we care_for Jesus himself , &quot; Talton said . Shunning this broad coalition are fundamentalist ministers like the Rev . Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition based in Orange County . He said ministers supporting the initiative do not need to organize because &quot; it ' s not considered part of the core doctrine. &quot; Sheldon publicly supports the crackdown on illegal immigrants , remaining resolutely unmoved by religious appeals_to &quot; welcome the stranger. &quot; &quot; Illegal strangers are different than a passing-through stranger who needs a night ' s lodging , food and clothing , &quot; explained Sheldon . Noted the preacher : Biblical teachings do not address &quot; illegal strangers. &quot; * With the sweet strains of the children ' s Angelic Choir in the background , Gardena pastor Jose Luis Torres nervously prepared to face the church leadership at a business meeting of the Pacific Presbytery last month . While the children swayed in white robes to a chorus of &quot; Somebody Bigger Than You and I , &quot; Torres was gathering strength from the Bible . He had been privately warned by some church leaders about the potential for backlash within his own religious community if he forced his fellow pastors to take a position against the controversial immigration measure before they were ready . Just a week earlier , smaller sub-groups of the San Gabriel Valley Presbyterian ministers took a bold stand against the measure , but Orange County ' s pastors considered the issue too politically hot to handle and refused to allow discussion . Torres , a native of Puerto Rico , insisted on forging ahead . He reminded the church leaders that the Bible bars Christians from oppressing &quot; strangers in our midst. &quot; He warned that the ballot measure will invite discrimination against Latinos . Wearily , he confessed , &quot; I am tired . I ' m tired_of fighting and fighting and fighting. &quot; Then Torres waited , watching in amazement as most of the church leaders -- representing 52 congregations from Malibu to San Pedro -- bolted to their feet from the pews to signal their opposition to the ballot measure . The voting at the Westminster Presbyterian_Church in central Los Angeles that September afternoon also reflected the schism facing many churches . Rev . Mark Nazarian , the pastor at St . Andrew ' s Presbyterian_Church in Redondo Beach , stood to oppose the measure , while his two church elders didn ' t budge . &quot; The church should not be debating political issues , &quot; St . Andrew ' s elder Dick Olson , 61 , said matter-of-factly . Nazarian was mindful of the complaint ; his vote that day was his first public expression against the measure and probably his last . He will deliver no sermon railing against Proposition 187 . By longstanding custom , Nazarian said , he tries to &quot; stay away &quot; from politics . * As the Nov . 8 election approaches , major religious denominations have been scrambling to develop a grass-roots strategy opposing the initiative . Almost weekly , various church organizations representing thousands of members are releasing detailed opposition statements . The groups include the Episcopalian General Conference , California ' s Catholic bishops , the Presbyterian Synod of Southern California and the bishops of the Evangelical Lutheran_Church of America . In the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles , the Office of Justice and Peace is directing an anti-Proposition 187 speakers bureau , distributing voter registration information and offering to train clergy members as they prepare to campaign against Proposition 187 . Cardinal Roger Mahony , who last fall spoke out against immigrant bashing with the call &quot; in the stranger we encounter Christ , &quot; also denounced the initiative in a July conference of Latino Catholics . In Orange County -- the birthplace of the Proposition 187 movement -- the diocese is leaving it up_to individual churches to develop their own tactics in the battle for parishioners ' hearts and souls . &quot; Everybody has their own niche and is trying to share information , &quot; said Msgr . Jaime Soto , the Hispanic Vicar for the Diocese of Orange . &quot; So for example , the diocese of Oakland ( developed excerpts to be used in sermons ) and we ' re distributing that to our churches for suggested readings and bulletin hints. &quot; Much of the statewide religious organizing is being coordinated by the Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights , a newly formed collection of some 60 religious organizations that met in Oceanside in July to plot strategy to defeat Proposition 187 . Setting_aside traditional fund-raising_efforts for the campaign , the group has focused instead on their religious networks to distribute information and provide speakers , according to Ed Dunn , a Franciscan brother . He and Terry Salkowitz , the executive_director of the Northern Pacific region of the American Jewish Congress , are helping lead the coalition . From their San Francisco offices , the coalition ' s leaders have also been organizing small living_room parties to encourage people to ponder the issue with their friends . At least one house_party has grown so large that its host , T.J. Anthony , has moved it to a San Francisco restaurant . Anthony , a new board_member for the American Jewish Congress , said he has invited a guest speaker who is a Holocaust survivor . As a young boy , the man and hundreds of other Jewish immigrants were aboard the ship St . Louis when it was turned_away from the Florida shores of the United States and forced_back to Germany . &quot; In the Jewish community , there is a very , very strong memory , a long , long memory . A lot of people remember the St . Louis and the people who were sent_back to their deaths in Nazi Germany . You can ' t forget that , &quot; Anthony said . The Interfaith coalition is planning its most public display of opposition for Oct . 25 , with candlelight vigils in all major California cities , according to coalition leader Dunn . The little money that the coalition has raised has been targeted for advertisements that will run in religious and ethnic newspapers . * The delicacy of the immigration issue has forced many clergy members to choose words with the caution of diplomats . They know it is easier to take_on the_devil than a volatile issue that could divide congregations . &quot; A lot of churches are still wrestling with this , especially ones feeling the economic_crisis in terms of lost jobs and lower incomes , &quot; Dunn said . &quot; The temptation for some is to say there ' s not enough to go_around . What we try to do is engage people in larger reasons for problems in the state . The largest corporations and wealthiest families have not paid their fair taxes , and therefore , the immigrant didn ' t create this crisis. &quot; Churches have faced contentious debates within their denominations on sensitive issues such_as abortion rights , birth_control and gays in the clergy , but their role in the argument over illegal immigrants seems even less clear-cut . Last weekend , the Presbyterian Synod of Southern California and Hawaii -- which represents 300 Southern California churches -- voted to oppose Proposition 187 in a resolution offered by the church ' s Hispanic Commission . But the vote came_after a decision by a sub-group -- the presbytery representing Orange County and East Los Angeles churches -- to quash their own discussion on procedural grounds . The synod ' s vote does not require the churches to sermonize on the issue because , generally , most ministers do not discuss public policy issues from the pulpit . But it encourages them to inform their congregations of their opposition and to help raise funds for the campaign . &quot; I believe we should provide education and care_for some of those in our midst , but at_the_same_time , we have to stem the flow ( of illegal immigrants ) so that we don ' t end_up with no money to provide care to those who are here . There is a limit , &quot; said the Rev . John Huffman , whose Newport Beach church , St . Andrew ' s Presbyterian , is considered the largest and wealthiest Presbyterian_church in Southern California . Similar tensions were also evident at an anti-Proposition 187 training session organized by the Diocese of San Bernardino for a small group of Catholic priests . One of the older priests vowed that he would not speak_up because of concerns about the separation of church and state . The group ' s awkward silence was broken by a younger priest . &quot; I just got irritated , &quot; said Father Miguel Urrea , the pastor of Christ the King Church in San Bernardino . &quot; I just said that it ' s very clearly stated as a church that we should not be concerned if people are documented or undocumented . If we do , we ' re losing our whole perspective of why we are priests . This is a humanitarian issue . Are we supposed to say , ' Sorry , we can ' t take_care of you because you don ' t have papers . Stand there and bleed to death. ' ? &quot; Last month , a small support group of Catholic priests in Orange County indulged in a painful discussion about political tactics . Many preside over rapidly evolving congregations that are shifting away from mostly white populations . The question , according to participant Msgr . Bill McLaughlin , was how best to preach without alienating members . McLaughlin formed a committee among his affluent Newport Beach congregation at Our Lady Queen of Angels to fight the initiative , but even the committee_members were apprehensive . At their information table outside the church last Sunday , parishioners Juan and Patty Carreras distributed a copy of the initiative and nine flyers listing arguments against it , but carefully insisted that they were only encouraging people to become informed . But that did not prevent a debate at the table after one of the Masses . &quot; I ' m not going_to hesitate to say something about this in a homily , &quot; said McLaughlin . &quot; I know it will alienate some people , though . This is a Republican stronghold . . . . When we do preach what we consider Gospel values , some of the community would like to see shortcuts taken . We all know what turns people off. &quot; Even the president of the Hispanic Commission for the Presbyterian Synod senses divisions within his own predominantly Latino congregation in South Gate . &quot; In every single congregation , no matter what the pastor preaches , two ( opposing ) groups will arise , &quot; said Rev . Nick Aguilar , the pastor of Bethel Presbyterian . &quot; It depends_on how life has treated you in the U.S. If you have a good job and a good car and savings in the bank , it ' s hard for you to remember when you came_to this country . Time and situations change our way of thinking. &quot; The level of church unity and the passion of sermons are often a reflection of the class and ethnic makeup of the congregation itself . When Episcopal Bishop Talton took his soft-spoken message of opposition to All Saints Church in Los Angeles last month , he received only support . The struggling congregation in the city ' s Highland Park area -- 90 % Latino and so poor that the minister moonlights as a Los Angeles public_school teacher -- listened silently to a Spanish translation of his words . A thundering endorsement for the church ' s position came from one of the older_men in the parish , Luis Guillermo , an immigrant from Guatemala , who stood_up after the bishop finished his message . &quot; We have listened , &quot; Guillermo shouted in Spanish . &quot; All of us know how we have suffered here in California . I hope that all_of us will vote to survive . . . . We are human . We are Christians . We have a heart ! &quot; At St . Irenaeus Catholic_Church in Cypress -- where white parishioners make_up 45 % of the congregation -- no opposition has surfaced yet toward the church opposition to Proposition 187 , and the church has sent parishioners to training sessions on how to register voters . So aggressive is the pastor , Father Michael Heher , that he decided to make his pulpit a bully one -- taking his sermon to the Cypress City_Council , which is considering a resolution supporting the proposition . Wearing his clerical_collar , the priest stood at the council podium and , in the manner of television &quot; Late Show &quot; host David Letterman , delivered a &quot; Top Ten &quot; list of reasons why the council should not back the measure . But there was little humor in this list , a somber message appealing_to the moral values of the council , which includes one of Heher ' s parishioners . Reason No . 10 : &quot; You don ' t have to take a position. &quot; His No . 1 reason : &quot; It ' s wrong. &quot; &quot; Having known you as I have , &quot; Heher told the council_members , &quot; I simply can ' t imagine you being a party to this. &quot; To those passionately opposed to the measure , it sometimes seems as though they are walking into the lion ' s den . The ecclesiastical and political forces collided one recent Sunday evening in a debate sponsored by St . Mark ' s Presbyterian_Church in Newport Beach , considered one of Orange County ' s more progressive congregations . Tension filled the room as the 150-member audience listened to both sides of the issue . It appeared that the crowd was evenly split . When one side stated a position , the other side groaned . Just that morning , the church ' s pastor , the Rev . Gary Collins , had delivered a sermon based upon the Gospel of the day : a parable in which Jesus heard his disciples arguing over who among them should be greatest . Jesus placed a child in their midst and told them that whoever welcomes the children welcomes him . Mindful of his sermon , Collins asked one panelist , former Border_Patrol agent Bill King , a question that went_to the core of his concern : How does one reconcile the Bible with the initiative ? &quot; I don ' t want to talk_about the Bible . This is politics , &quot; Collins recalled King answering -- a response that bothered Collins for days . &quot; While Proposition 187 is surely a political issue , &quot; the minister said , &quot; it is surely a moral issue. &quot;</TEXT>
