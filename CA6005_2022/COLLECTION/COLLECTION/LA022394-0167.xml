   <HEADLINE> HUGHES AIRCRAFT WINS CONTRACT TO UPGRADE NORWEGIAN AIR_DEFENSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hughes Aircraft Co . said Tuesday that it had won a $ 106-million contract to upgrade air_defense systems for the Royal Norwegian Air_Force . Dan Reeder , spokesman for Hughes , said the aerospace company ' s Surface Systems unit in Fullerton will be the prime contractor on the project , which is a joint_venture of Hughes and a Norwegian company , Norsk Forsvarsteknologi . He said the contract will not result in new hiring at Hughes . The company has 9 # 000 employees in Orange County , including 7 # 000 at the Hughes Fullerton operation . Under the contract , the partners will convert Norway ' s existing surface-to-air_missiles -- which knock hostile aircraft out of the sky -- to a new missile system created by Hughes and the Norwegian firm . The new system uses ground-launched advanced medium-range air-to-air_missiles instead of the older-generation adapted Hawk missiles . Norway is expected to buy several hundred of the ground-launched missiles for the system under a separate procurement deal . Such a system will save on costs because Norway will be able to use the new missiles for both its ground-based air_defense system and for its fleet of F-16 fighter jets . Options for future contract extensions could be worth $ 25 million , Reeder said .</TEXT>
