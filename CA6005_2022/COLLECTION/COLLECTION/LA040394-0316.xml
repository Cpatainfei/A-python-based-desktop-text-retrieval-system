   <HEADLINE> SERB ASSAULT ON ENCLAVE SAID TO ADVANCE ; BOSNIA : THE TARGET IS THE MUSLIM POCKET OF GORAZDE . THE RED_CROSS DECIDES TO EVACUATE POTENTIAL VICTIMS OF ' ETHNIC CLEANSING ' IN THE NORTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnian Serb forces appeared to be making progress Saturday in a concerted five-day assault to seize the U.N.-protected Muslim enclave of Gorazde , U.N. sources said . In northern Bosnia , Red_Cross officials decided to evacuate Muslim and Croatian civilians from the town of Prijedor to save them from an alleged Serbian campaign of terror . The &quot; last-resort &quot; decision followed reports that Serbian militants in the town had targeted Muslims and Croats in a campaign of killings , beatings and arson . Sarajevo radio , reporting on the Gorazde fighting , said , &quot; All suburbs are coming under fierce artillery_fire and dozens of houses have been razed to the ground. &quot; &quot; The Serbs are certainly trying to finish_off Gorazde with what seems to be a big-scale offensive , &quot; one U.N. source said . &quot; There are people in our staff who made an assessment that Gorazde could well fall because it ' s a very shallow area . There is one main_road and if it is taken it is the end of the pocket. &quot; A spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) , Maj . Rob Annink , said fighting in Gorazde on Friday had killed four people and wounded 25 . Annink said a column of Serbian tanks , armored cars and trucks was seen moving eastward from Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale late on Friday , apparently headed for the Gorazde front . Asked how the United Nations could tolerate the Serbs seizing an area that it had declared a protected zone , he said : &quot; The members of the Security_Council should object to these happenings in Gorazde . UNPROFOR cannot do anything at this stage. &quot; The U.N. sources said the U.N. force was powerless to deter a Serbian advance until after the planned deployment of 800 Ukrainian peacekeeping troops in Gorazde later this month . As an illustration of continuing tensions even in areas where cease-fires have been negotiated , Annink said the Muslim-led government army had suspended all steps to normalize the situation in the divided southern city of Mostar after a Croatian sniper seriously wounded a Muslim official . He said international monitors in the city , whose Muslim quarter was pounded by besieging Croats for months , met commanders of both sides to impress on them the gravity of such an attack . Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic endorsed the International Committee of the Red_Cross ' plan to evacuate non-Serbs from Prijedor , saying lives came first even if this helped &quot; ethnic cleansing. &quot; &quot; As far as I am concerned , if these people are in danger we have to take them out . We should not try to protect ourselves . We must know that lives come first , &quot; he said . U.N. and Red_Cross officials said they accepted claims by the Muslim organization Merhamet that Bosnian Serbs had killed 17 Muslims and two Croats in or near Prijedor in the past few days .</TEXT>
