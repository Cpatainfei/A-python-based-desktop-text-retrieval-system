   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; DIANNE FEINSTEIN ; THE RACE FOR THE SENATE : EXPERIENCED POLITICAN -- BUT DOES IT HELP ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; All my life I ' ve tried to make government work , &quot; says Senator Dianne Feinstein . In her first two years in the U.S. Senate she ' s done what many consider a remarkable job . She landed positions on two powerful committees -- judiciary and appropriations . That helped her get measures passed that brought the state money for earthquake assistance , education , prisons and agriculture . But in a state -- and a nation -- angry at politicians and at government , such achievements may work against her in her battle for reelection . Feinstein , 61 , first came_to national prominence in 1977 , when San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were assassinated . Feinstein , then a city supervisor , announced the deaths in a dramatic press_conference , and was soon appointed mayor . She lost a governor ' s race to Pete Wilson in 1990 , but then won the right to serve out the final two years of his vacated U.S. Senate seat in 1992 , defeating Wilson-appointee John Seymour . Now she faces one-term Republican Rep . Mike Huffington in her reelection bid . The campaign has been expensive and nasty . In March , Feinstein seemed a sure bet to return to the Senate -- polls showed her leading the little-known Huffington by as much as 30 points . Today that lead has been whittled_down to single digits by an extensive , expensive and negative Huffington advertising_campaign . The challenger has painted Feinstein as a &quot; tax-and-spend Democrat , &quot; a professional politician , a Clinton-clone and pawn to special_interests . Recently his ads have charged she voted for federal programs that enriched a company controlled by her wealthy investor husband , Richard Blum . Feinstein has fired back with vigor . Her ads portray Huffington as a spoiled rich kid with no political record who is trying to buy a Senate seat . They ' ve lambasted him for refusing to make public his personal_income tax records . And they ' ve portrayed him as a modern-day carpetbagger , who maintained a legal address in Texas until just before running_for Congress in_order to avoid California state income_taxes . Due_to the angry nature of modern political campaigning and the foul mood of voters , Feinstein ' s ads have only rarely pointed_out her legislative successes . Still , while Huffington is attracting a good number of so-called Reagan Democrats , Feinstein counts among her supporters a number of prominent Republicans . In spite of her slim lead , Feinstein recently came_out in opposition to the popular Proposition 187 , which would deny social_services to undocumented immigrants . She now faces an almost certain last minute blitzkrieg of Huffington advertising , and dwindling campaign coffers from which to respond . * Question : What are your legislative priorities if you ' re reelected to the Senate ? Answer : My legislative agenda continues to be violence , illegal immigration and welfare reform . In the area of violence , my job will be to see that California gets its fair share out of the crime bill . I ' ve submitted a bill to the Senate called the Illegal Immigration Control Act . It would stop illegal immigration at the border by giving Border_Patrol the tools they need to do the job . It would also remove any cash welfare benefits , like Medi-Cal , from people here illegally . It would double the penalties for document fraud , and for illegal alien smuggling . I would fund these increased efforts with a border crossing fee of $ 1.00 , which would provide more_than $ 400 million per year . * Q : If these measures were successful , and we did severely limit the amount of undocumented immigrants , the largest impact would be_on agriculture . What do you say to the growers who depend primarily on undocumented workers to harvest their crops ? A : We ' ve got_over a_million people unemployed in the state , and my own recommendation to the growers is that they really make an effort to recruit people in cities who are legal and willing to do this kind of work . I think they may find surprising numbers of people who want to work . * Q : Why did you decide to come_out against Proposition 187 , and was it a tough decision to make ? A : Yes , it was , because a lot of people were encouraging me to support it . We spent a lot of time_studying it . My conclusion is that it probably violates both the state and federal constitutions . It violates federal law , and as such would put the state at risk of losing about $ 15 billion in federal money . Now I don ' t believe we want to do that . But more fundamentally , I don ' t believe we want our teachers , or doctors to be INS agents . As I read the initiative , every teacher , if they suspected a student was here illegally , would have to report that student . Now think_about how you do this . You do_it by accent , by skin_color . And I do not believe that this is what our teachers should be doing with their time . I think whatever time they have should be focused_on teaching . I also believe that school is a very good thing for kids and if you take kids out of school , they then become fodder for gangs , for drug activity , for other problems , because most of these kids are very poor . I also believe strongly that everyone should be immunized and inoculated . I stood_in a clinic in Fresno where 26 children died from the measles , a disease that we thought had been eradicated . Polio is making its way back , and other communicable_diseases are returning . It serves us all to make_sure that all children are immunized . So I think the way to stop illegal immigration is at the borders , not through our children . * Q : How significant is it that your opponent , Mike Huffington , employed an undocumented worker as a nanny ? A : I think it ' s significant on two levels . One , I think it shows what a very complicated problem this is . Secondly , it rather speaks_for itself . He ' s endorsed Proposition 187 , and clearly wants to take the most stringent of measures ( against illegal immigration ) -- but has himself employed someone who is here illegally for a substantial period_of_time . * Q : Let ' s talk_about some charges he ' s made . The first is that your support of the Clinton economic package will mean $ 37 billion in new taxes for California . A : That package has succeeded in slowing the growth of the deficit , and it ' s reduced the size of government . But let me address the tax issue . There are 13 million personal_income taxpayers in California . Only about 170 # 000 had their taxes go_up -- 2.1 million had their taxes go_down , and the rest had no change in their taxes at all . So , the bottom_line is that the very highest income earners -- less than 1 % of Californians , and mostly those who earn more_than $ 250 # 000 a year -- were the only ones that had their income_tax go_up . * Q : The other charge , which is being trumpeted in full-page ads , is that your husband benefited from legislation which you voted_in favor of . . . . A : Well , that ' s nonsense , because he ' s actually lost money in that company . What I voted for was the Health and Human Services appropriations_bill , which includes funds for student loan programs . Almost half of all ( college ) students need loans . Now , my opponent may_not know that , but that ' s the case in life . * Q : Do you find it ironic that all_of your political accomplishments are being used against you -- that suddenly all your experience is not a plus , but a minus ? A : As a mayor and supervisor in a difficult city ( San Francisco ) I learned the skills that have enabled me to perform for the people . And I have probably done as much as anyone in the history of this country who ' s ever gone_to the United States Senate and served just two years . And it is ironic , because I believe I have earned a vote for a six-year term . My opponent went_to the House at_the_same_time I went_to the Senate , and he hasn ' t earned it , because he hasn ' t done anything . And not only that , what he has done , in lie after lie , is to distort who I am -- my record , my family . And he ' s done_it with the view that he can buy a United States Senate seat , and I don ' t think a Senate seat should be bought . It ought to be earned . * Q : What would you say then to a voter who might accuse you of being part of the problem , who might say , &quot; It ' s professional politicians like you who ' ve gotten us into this mess ? &quot; A : First of all , nothing is going_to stop in Washington , whomever is elected . There will be authorization bills , and appropriation_bills , because that ' s the way the Senate works . What is important is that the Senate works for California . And it hasn ' t been working for California . No Californian had been_on the Senate Appropriations Committee for 25 years until I got there . And I have been able to see that California gets its fair share . We have all these other smaller states , whose senators have seniority , and they protect their states . I went_up there , I worked for California , and I succeeded -- in appropriations , with the crime bill , the Desert Protection Act , with economic programs . I ' ve done this in two years . Now what I ' m saying to people is give me six years , and watch me work for you . * Q : Huffington talks a lot about the fact that we don ' t need more legislation -- that government is too big . What do you see as the limits of the federal_government ? A : I agree that the government is too big . I voted to cut the federal work_force by 272 # 000 people . He did not . I cut my own budget by about 38 % over two years and saved $ 2.8 million . Now who ' s been for smaller government ? It ' s rhetoric . * Q : Let me ask you about the foul mood that voters seem to be stuck_in . How do you account_for this anger toward government and politicians ? A : Well , if everything Huffington said about me were correct -- even I would n ' t vote for me . But it isn ' t . No one in the history of this country has ever spent what Michael Huffington is spending to buy a United States Senate seat . We will be outspent by $ 20 million . And all_of that money is being used to call me names -- terrible names . When I came_out against Proposition 187 he said , &quot; She ' s finally shown her real colors -- they ' re yellow. &quot; He ' s called me a tax dodger , because , when my ( former ) husband was dying , for two years I didn ' t have taxes due , so I didn ' t pay taxes . And yet he has stiffed the state , maintained a sham residence in Texas to avoid 1990 California taxes on the sale of his business , and he won ' t reveal his personal_income taxes as I have . This constant barrage fuels people ' s cynicism . I think there were people who thought good of me until they heard these things . And I can ' t go_up against him , ad for ad , and match it . It ' s very hard to correct the record , once these things are said . And people don ' t know who he is . * Q : But do you feel there ' s something inherently wrong with a person using their wealth to finance a campaign ? A : Yes I do . I believe there ought to be limits , and I voted for campaign spending reform . Interestingly enough , he did not . But the bottom_line is , if Michael Huffington weren ' t willing to spend $ 30 million , this race would n ' t be a contest . He doesn ' t have the political base to raise money . And he ' s fueling this race with his own money , and yet he won ' t tell anybody where it came from , by making his taxes public . * Q : Do you have days when you feel_like this business of politics -- particularly the campaigning -- has become so mean and so base that it may_not all be worth it ? A : Many days . When I see my family brought into this , and when I see myself called &quot; the special_interest candidate. &quot; I mean , that ' s just baloney . It ' s very hard . * Q : Do you think the kind of negativity that ' s characterized so many races , including your own , is going_to increase -- what ' s going_to happen ? A : I ' m hopeful that once this election is over -- it ' s certainly the worst one of my life -- that I can go_back to work , keep my commitments to people , and work to make this a better state . You know , I ' ve spent my life in California . I ' ve been in every county in this state . And I really deeply feel that I ' ve got_to continue to do this . I ' m good at it , I ' m effective , I can work_on both sides of the aisle and get legislation passed . * Q : If Huffington wins , along with a_few other Republican Senate candidates , the GOP could end_up controlling the Senate . What would that mean for the Clinton_Administration -- and for California ? A : It means all_the committee chairs change . You would have Jesse Helms as head of foreign relations and Bob Packwood as head of finance . The power in the Senate would be in very different hands , and that would mean no campaign spending reform , no lobby disclosure reform and probably no extension of the Safe Drinking Water Act . But I don ' t believe Michael Huffington will win . I think the people of California have sense , and I think they know who cares about them , and their families , and their state . And I think they ' ll conclude it ' s not Michael Huffington , it ' s Dianne Feinstein. *</TEXT>
