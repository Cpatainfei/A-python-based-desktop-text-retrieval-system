   <HEADLINE> U.S. AID IMPROVES FEW RUSSIAN LIVES ; ASSISTANCE : HIGH EXPECTATIONS AMONG ORDINARY CITIZENS GO UNFULFILLED . TECHNICAL HELP IS SLOW TO BEAR FRUIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Army Lt . Alexander Maly , a 22-year-old platoon commander , is about to benefit from the Clinton_Administration ' s multibillion-dollar effort to reform Russia . As far as Maly ' s concerned , it ' s about time . After two years in a cramped dormitory , the lieutenant is No . 36 on a waiting list for the 128 free apartments in a twin-tower high-rise , one of six housing projects being built with U.S. aid for officers slated to be discharged from Russia ' s shrinking army . If all goes as planned , in July he and his wife will move_into a new three-room apartment overlooking a lake in an upscale neighborhood of the city of Nizhny Novgorod . Then he will leave the army and try to launch his own business . There is little doubt that the young couple will get their promised new life . The $ 6-million pilot housing program , announced when President Clinton first met with President Boris N . Yeltsin in Vancouver , Canada , last April , is moving along more or less on schedule . But as Clinton and Yeltsin begin another summit_meeting today , it is one of the few examples of American aid with a promise of immediate payoff for ordinary Russians . And even this program is minuscule compared to the expectations it has raised . Since the Soviet_Union fell_apart in 1991 , the United States has given Russia more_than $ 4 billion in direct assistance , much of it technical aid that will be slow to bear fruit . It has also orchestrated a $ 43-billion Western aid package to be channeled mostly through international financial agencies . Nevertheless , Yeltsin spokesman Vyacheslav V . Kostikov complained on the eve of Clinton ' s arrival that the aid effort pales next to the Marshall Plan launched by the United States to rebuild Europe after World_War_II . &quot; Every family felt that aid , &quot; Kostikov said in an interview . &quot; In Russia , on the other hand , there is not yet a single family that can say , ' Yes , the Americans helped me and made my life better. ' &quot; The housing program launched last spring was designed to meet such criticism . It was based on a simple formula : Russians have timber , cement and newly private construction companies ; Americans have money and know-how ; together they can help close Russia ' s deficit of about 10 million homes . In its initial phase , the program is designed to satisfy another mutual goal -- the reduction of Russia ' s army and the withdrawal of the 20 # 000 troops still based in the now-independent Baltic_states of Latvia and Estonia . Riddled by poor morale , the army has balked at bringing_home former Soviet officers from foreign bases or discharging them from the service until it can provide them with homes of_their_own in Russia . Maly and other officers have been brought_back anyway , only to wind_up in the dormitories or barracks . Their frustration boiled_over last month when army_officers gave a disproportionately high vote to Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , whose neo-fascist party finished second in Russia ' s parliamentary elections last month . The result shocked Yeltsin ' s reformist government and the West not only because of Zhirinovsky ' s views and militarism but because of his opposition to dependence on Western aid . &quot; Zhirinovsky promised to give higher salaries and quality housing to servicemen who live_in ghastly conditions , &quot; Maly said , explaining why he and his army buddies voted for the extremist . &quot; He may_not be able to fulfill those promises , but a sweet tale is still better than the bitter truth. &quot; The lieutenant was quick to add that he welcomes the American promises as well . &quot; We cannot be ashamed , &quot; he said . &quot; Our country needs to be saved . Clinton has extended a hand of friendship , and we should take it. &quot; Russian officials now worry that the hand of friendship is too_little , too late . They are pressing Washington to launch a promised expansion of the pilot_project , which is building 460 homes and apartments in five cities , into a $ 160-million effort to finance homes for another 5 # 000 army_officers by October , 1995 . &quot; If the project had been launched a year earlier , fewer servicemen would have supported Zhirinovsky , &quot; said Anvar Shamuzafarov , secretary of a government committee coordinating the building project with the U.S. Agency for International Development . &quot; The longer we delay , the more we help the extremists who want to wreck the whole thing. &quot; U.S. AID officials defend their decision to start small . They note that the pilot_program , due for completion this summer but delayed until fall , exposed flaws in planning that would have been costlier had they launched from scratch into mass production . One lesson they learned was to write contracts to accommodate Russia ' s high monthly inflation . Contractors demanded payment in_advance , then charged AID extra when the materials they bought turned_out to cost more rubles . Another lesson was to pay more attention to politics in choosing where to build . The Siberian city of Novosibirsk pulled_out of the project after forces hostile to reform took power in City_Hall in October . &quot; The project was considered too Yeltsin , too American , &quot; said an AID official , who was forced to find new sites for 180 single-family homes . The pilot_project ' s latest experiment is to give 100 army_officers vouchers worth about $ 15 # 000 , the approximate cost of a 700-square-foot home , to pay directly to contractors to build whatever they want . If the system works , 1 # 000 of the officers benefiting from the expanded program will receive vouchers , while the other 4 # 000 will be assigned homes built by AID . Russian officials , while accepting the voucher system , worry that it will drive_up housing prices ; the Americans hope it will cut_out the bureaucracy and stimulate competition in the housing market .</TEXT>
