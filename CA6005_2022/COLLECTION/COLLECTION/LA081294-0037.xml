   <HEADLINE> BREAKING RULES OF A ' LIFE AND DEATH GAME ' ; LAW : MUST AN ATTORNEY FACE DISBARMENT FOR HELPING A CLIENT WHO DESIRES THE DEATH_PENALTY ATTAIN THAT OBJECTIVE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In light of the games being played_out by both the prosecution and defense in the O.J. Simpson trial , how extraordinary to read of public_defender Elliott Levine . It seems that both the Utah Supreme Court and the State Bar are ready to punish him for not playing &quot; the game. &quot; That is the &quot; life and death game &quot; that attorneys are expected to play in murder cases . In Utah -- as well as in other states -- the &quot; rules &quot; of the game appear to require that an attorney bend every effort , spare no expense and utilize every trick or loophole in the law to get his client acquitted or , at least , a life rather than a death sentence . But what of the client who doesn ' t want that type of representation ? What if the client , having played the game before , wants no more of it ? What if , after being told of all possible defenses and procedures to escape conviction and / or punishment , the client nevertheless wants to plead guilty in a capital case and submit himself to the death_penalty ? Does the life-and-death game require that his attorney act absolutely contrary to his client ' s wishes and diligently fight to prohibit the state from imposing the &quot; ultimate penalty &quot; of death ? Is the attorney required to violate his client ' s trust and battle steadfastly to save him from the penalty he earnestly seeks ? Levine ' s client , James Holland , asked Levine to do nothing unethical . He sought no perjured testimony . He did not solicit research into the backgrounds of potential witnesses to embarrass and / or impeach them at trial . He asked_for no experts whose testimony might raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of potential or actual jurors . Holland simply advised Levine that he had committed the two murders and multiple robberies and , having spent 35 of his 47 years in various reformatories , jails and prisons , he wanted to be executed . Levine has been excoriated by the Utah Supreme Court in his representation of Holland and Von Lester Taylor , another multiple murderer ( and arsonist and kidnaper ) , who , unlike Holland , did not want to be executed . By attempting to make a &quot; proportionality argument &quot; for Taylor , Levine called a willing Holland from prison to show the jury that Holland was a career criminal and three-time murderer who expressed little remorse and deserved the death_penalty , whereas the much younger Taylor had a single prior felony burglary conviction and lots of remorse and did not deserve death . The trial_judge did not allow him to make_full presentation of Holland ' s crimes . When Taylor ' s jury returned the not-unexpected death sentence , Levine filed an appellate brief with the Utah Supreme Court in which he claimed a denial of Taylor ' s rights because the trial_judge had not allowed him to argue &quot; that an individual such_as James Holland is a prime candidate for the death_penalty while Taylor is not. &quot; Levine ' s candor and honesty were considered wholly inappropriate by the Supreme Court which , in_order to &quot; preserve the integrity of the judicial_system , &quot; required that Levine withdraw from both the Taylor and Holland cases and referred the_matter to the Utah State Bar for &quot; appropriate action. &quot; Before 1975 , the states could force an attorney on a defendant in a capital case whether or not the defendant wanted to be so represented . Such a defendant could not represent himself because the Sixth Amendment did not in so many words give him that right . In Faretta vs . California , the U.S. Supreme Court specifically granted the right of self-representation in any case , including a death_penalty case . If a defendant in a capital case can choose to represent himself , it seems illogical that he cannot choose an attorney who will help him attain his objective , whether that be acquittal , a plea bargain to a lesser offense or a conviction and execution . &quot; Telling it like it is &quot; appears to disconcert public prosecutors and black-robed justices who ( these days ) are happy enough to uphold death sentences if they can say the convicted murderer got &quot; effective representation &quot; because his attorney &quot; played the game &quot; properly . In that way , prosecutors do not look quite so bloodthirsty , and appellate_courts can pontificate about the murderer ' s &quot; fair trial. &quot; According to the Utah Supreme Court , Elliot Levine &quot; breached his duty of loyalty to Holland &quot; and &quot; not only acted directly contrary to Holland ' s interest , but aligned himself with the state ' s position. &quot; ( The court , it seems , knows what is in Holland ' s &quot; interest &quot; better than Holland himself. ) The court did concede that &quot; we are aware that Holland might prefer the death_penalty . . . . Nevertheless , an attorney is not justified in asserting that his client deserves the death_penalty , even if his client desires to have that penalty imposed. &quot; Is the public perception of the criminal-justice system strengthened or weakened when , consistent with his client ' s knowing and intelligent choice , an attorney lets his guilty client speak the truth ? &quot; I am guilty of taking life , and I want to die for my crimes. &quot;</TEXT>
