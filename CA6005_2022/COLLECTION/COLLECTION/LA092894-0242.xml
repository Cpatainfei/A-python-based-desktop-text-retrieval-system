   <HEADLINE> R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY ; AFFAIR OF STATE AIDS ALZHEIMER ' S PROJECTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Supporters of the John Douglas French Center for Alzheimer ' s Disease / Friends of Caregivers started their own political_party Sunday -- a black-tie gala held at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda . Called &quot; A Stately Affair &quot; in honor of its location , the dinner-dance attracted 150 supporters who put aside their political differences and remembered past presidents from both parties . The $ 85-per-person gala raised about $ 25 # 000 for the organization . The support group offers financial assistance to family members caring_for a patient with Alzheimer ' s disease , a progressive brain disorder that causes memory_loss . State Dinner Guests assembled in the library ' s rose garden for a champagne reception , then fanned_out to tour the grounds and exhibits . Later they gathered inside the library hall and sat at tables decorated in blue and white -- presidential colors . For dinner , the Anaheim Marriott prepared favorites from previous White_House administrations , including : a Nixon family favorite -- salad with pineapple citrus dressing ; a Reagan-inspired entree of filet of sole stuffed with seafood mousse and filet_mignon with peppercorn sauce , and former First_Lady Rosalynn Carter ' s apple tart . &quot; We didn ' t want this to be political , so our menu includes choices from both Republican and Democratic presidents , &quot; said Keath Lauderdale , event chairman . &quot; After all , we ' re coming_into an election year. &quot; After dinner , guests danced the night away to Barry Cole and his orchestra . &quot; Choosing a unique location that has a theme makes_it easy &quot; to plan a benefit , said Lauderdale , who attended with his wife , Kathie . &quot; Last year we had a fund-raiser at the Cerritos ( Center for the ) Performing Arts . We ' re hoping to find our niche . We ' re a young organization searching for our identity. &quot; Alzheimer ' s Heavy Toll Friends of Caregivers , established three years ago by the John Douglas French Center in Los Alamitos , provides families of Alzheimer ' s patients with money for short-term respite care , in-home care and adult day_care . &quot; Sometimes the families are burned-out and can ' t cope anymore , &quot; said Ferri Kidane , founder and executive_director of Friends . &quot; Alzheimer ' s is a horrendous emotional and financial struggle for families . Patients require constant , around-the-clock attention . Often they are aggressive and sometimes abusive . They no longer resemble the person they once were. &quot; Funds are available to families in Los Angeles and Orange counties who apply for grants . Many Friends supporters have family members who are patients . &quot; My mother has had Alzheimer ' s for more_than 12 years . She ' s been a patient at the center since it opened , &quot; said Melinda Ruddy , president of Friends . &quot; This cause is very near and dear to me . Care is so expensive , and there ' s no insurance coverage for Alzheimer ' s . For a couple in their 80s , there ' s nowhere they can turn. &quot; Other faces in the crowd were Callen Locket , Patricia Kates , Roberta Fratello , Carole and Robert Blum , Johnnie Strohmyer , Alice Jempsa , Walter Bowman and Joel Lowenstein .
