   <HEADLINE> TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART : GREENSPAN CREATES OLYMPIC BRILLIANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Overstuffed on football ? Well , how about a taste of Olympic winter sports ? Bud Greenspan has put_together another Olympic masterpiece , &quot; Lillehammer ' 94 : 16 Days of Glory , &quot; in which stories from last February ' s Winter_Olympics are told as only Greenspan can . The first of the show ' s two parts , highlighted by Dan Jansen ' s quest_for an Olympic medal in speedskating , will have its premiere on the Disney Channel Sunday night at 9 . And you don ' t have to be a Disney Channel subscriber to get_it . This weekend is part of the Disney Channel ' s free holiday preview in which the channel is made available to all cable viewers on systems that offer it . The second part of Greenspan ' s three-hour epic will be shown on the Disney Channel on Feb . 12 , the first anniversary of the opening of the Lillehammer Games . * The Jansen story has been_well chronicled but never quite like this . The footage gathered by Greenspan ' s crew , the writing , and the people in the segment , such_as Jansen ' s animated wife , his baby daughter and Jansen himself make this segment special . This story was a tear-jerker for those who saw it as it happened , and it is even more emotional the way Greenspan tells it . So have the tissue handy . The facts of the story are that Jansen finished fourth and 16th in the 500-meter and 1 # 000-meter races at the 1984 Winter_Olympics , he fell_in both races in 1988 following the death of his sister Jane from leukemia , and he finished fourth and 26th at Albertville , France , in 1992 . At Lillehammer , in the 500 , his best event , he slipped and finished eighth . After that , he was ready to go_home , thinking he didn ' t have a chance at a medal in the 1 # 000 , his weakest event . But to the shock of the family , he won the gold . On the victory stand , he offered a salute to his late sister and later skated a victory lap carrying his daughter Jane , named after his sister . * Another outstanding segment in part one of Greenspan ' s documentary is about Oksana Baiul and her narrow victory over Nancy Kerrigan in the women ' s figure_skating . The Tonya Harding-Kerrigan saga barely gets a mention . Greenspan leaves those kind of stories for tabloid shows such_as &quot; Hard Copy. &quot; He accentuates the positive . Greenspan also tells the stories of cross-country skiers Manuela Di Centa of Italy and Lyubov Egorova of Russia and of ski_jumpers Espen Bredesen of Norway and Jens Weissflog of Germany . If there is a downside to Greenspan ' s film , it is these segments . Tighter editing would have helped . There is simply too_much footage of cross-country_skiing and ski_jumping . Ski_jumping is a very picturesque event , but after a while it gets a little old . Overall , however , this is another excellent Greenspan production . The storytelling formula that has worked so well for Greenspan over the years once again works . * Another alternative to football this weekend is the Skins Game , one of the most popular golf events on television . ABC will carry this year ' s Skins Game at Bighorn Golf_Club in Palm Desert Saturday at 12:30 p.m. and Sunday at 3:30 p.m. Both telecasts will be tape-delayed . Last year ' s Skins Game produced the largest Saturday rating ever for a golf event ( 6.4 ) , beating the 6.3 Saturday rating for the 1991 Skins Game . The 1986 Skins Game was the highest-rated golf telecast of the year ( 7.0 ) , and in six other years , including last year , the Skins Game has outdrawn every major tournament except The Masters . Payne Stewart , who last year won $ 100 # 000 with a 15-foot putt on hole No . 13 and $ 120 # 000 with a 20-footer on No . 16 , won the title with a total $ 280 # 000 . He edged Fred Couples , who won $ 260 # 000 . Paul Azinger and Arnold Palmer were shut_out . A few days after last year ' s Skins Game at Bighorn , Azinger was diagnosed with lymphoma in his right shoulder . He underwent chemotherapy and radiation , returned to competitive golf in August and is back for this year ' s Skins Game , joining Stewart , Couples and Tom Watson . Vin Scully , who has worked all but one Skins Game since the event began in 1983 , is back to anchor the telecasts . He missed in 1989 , when the Skins Game first went from NBC to ABC . Scully was still under contract to NBC then . Scully will be joined this weekend by ABC commentators Peter Jacobsen and Mark Rolfing . The event is produced by Ohlmeyer Communications in association with Trans World International . The event was created by Don Ohlmeyer , now the West Coast president at NBC , and Barry Frank , TWI senior_vice_president . * To promote the Skins Game , Scully , Couples and Watson did a conference_call this week . Said Couples : &quot; I don ' t watch much golf , but the Skins Game is a lot of fun to watch . I ' ve always had the feeling if I didn ' t watch I ' d miss something. &quot; Said Scully : &quot; Skins is something every golfer has played . Even a double-digit handicap left-handed hacker like me plays it all_the time. &quot; Asked about Greg Norman ' s proposed World Tour , which is being backed by Fox , both Couples and Watson indicated it could be a good thing if a compromise is reached with the PGA Tour . * Not dead yet : Watson was asked about a letter he wrote to CBS golf producer Frank Chirkinian criticizing commentator Gary McCord for his &quot; bikini wax &quot; comment and others during last April ' s Masters . The letter , also sent to Masters officials , may have played a role in the removal of McCord from future Masters telecasts . &quot; I thought that was a dead issue , &quot; Watson said . Pressed further , Watson said , &quot; My only regret is that Frank decided to make a personal_letter public. &quot; TV-Radio Notes If you happen to miss ABC ' s live coverage of Saturday ' s Notre Dame-USC game at 5 p.m. , Prime Ticket will replay it at 8:30 p.m. . . .
