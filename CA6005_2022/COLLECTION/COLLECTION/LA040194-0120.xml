   <HEADLINE> BEHIND THE WHEEL / PAUL DEAN : IT ' S ALL IN THE TIMING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kia is the name of a Korean car_maker . Pronounced Kee-ah , it is not one of those terra-cotta piglets sprouting green stuff and living_in Christmas infamy as the gift that keeps_on dying . Kia ' s maiden model in America is the Sephia . Pronounced So-fee-ya as in Loren , there is no further resemblance between this vehicle and anything Italian , daunting or desirable . What the Kia Sephia does resemble is a fairly priced , adequately equipped , quite roomy , nicely styled subcompact sedan . If this were 1988 . But this is 1994 , the Year of the Tyke , when little cars deliver big things , basic automotive_technology is high , and the values of entry-level sedans are enormous . These days , many bargain-basement subcompacts come_with standard passenger- and driver-side air_bags . The Sephia -- which goes_on sale next month at 17 Southern California dealerships -- regresses to door-mounted shoulder_straps that restrain occupants by strangulation . Toyota ' s Tercel , Ford ' s Escort and other pocket autos offer optional anti-lock brakes . Kia ' s Sephia does not . Honda ' s Civic is available with four engines and up_to 125 horsepower . The Sephia offers one pallid four-banger developing 88-horsepower , which makes freeway access the ultimate adventure . Its base price of $ 8 # 495 does not include automatic_transmission , power_steering , air conditioning or even a two-speaker radio . For $ 480 more , you can buy a equally naked Dodge / Plymouth Neon . But standard on Neon are two air_bags , a 132-horsepower engine , and more head and rear leg room than a stagecoach . Neon is more power , 30 % better fuel economy and perkier looks . Examining the undersides and insides of Sephia sets a new high in deja_vu . Beneath hood and body panels are the obsolete front-drive engine and transmission of the 1992 Mazda MX-3 . Capping all negatives , however , is the mind-set of American consumers . They believe that Korea manufactures quality textiles and electronics , but not fine , reliable automobiles . The rise and crash of hapless Hyundai -- from sales of 260 # 000 in 1988 to currently less than half that -- only confirmed that view . Even Kia -- despite its 50-year background in building bicycles , motorcycles , cars and trucks in Korea -- acknowledges that it is sledding uphill . The executive litany , to the media and at auto shows , is that no one knows Kia or the car , no one needs them and no one wants to hear from them . But . . . they also say that by moving heaven and Detroit to re-establish the reliability of a Korean car , by coddling customers with a 24-hour roadside assistance program , by emphasizing value and taking the war out of warranties , Kia may come_to mean more_than Killed in Action . Sephia will be marketed in three versions , all with the odd yet desirable perk of a theft alarm as standard equipment . The base RS is about as bare as small cars get , without even wheel covers or visor mirrors . LS models include power and tilt steering , deluxe carpeting , tachometer and clock . Top_of_the_line GS has power windows and locks , remote trunk and fuel-flap release , four-speaker sound_system and power_steering . But add air conditioning , alloy wheels and cruise_control , and the price of a GS nudges $ 13 # 000 . that ' s just a whisker from the price of a Ford Mustang coupe with V-6 power , two air_bags and power_steering . Our test vehicle was a Sephia GS with four-speed automatic and overdrive . Nothing was memorable about any portion of the vehicle , its looks or performance . It wore 13-inch wheels -- Toyota Corolla and Saturn opt_for easier-riding 14-inchers -- which provide a road feel somewhere between firm and numb . Freeway passage was particularly unappealing . With only 88 horses on_tap , there is little acceleration to spare and each journey became a matter of catching_up and struggling to stay there . With such limited reserves , one certainly watched one ' s manners . Engine noise was high . So were sounds intruding from God ' s great outdoors . The flexing heft of doors and hood clearly show where subcompact manufacturers save money and weight on insulation and sheet_metal gauge . Sephia ' s trunk deserves a dishonorable mention . Even gentle slopes of typical driveways unbalance the lid when raised for unloading . The first indication is an edge tapping the nape of your neck in passable imitation of Madame La Guillotine . Geno Effler , spokesman for Kia Motors America Inc. of Irvine , acknowledges that Sephia is not the best of subcompact cars . Nor the worst . But the little sedan does give Kia a seat at the pie-eating contest . &quot; Subcompacts are 23 % of new car sales , and as long as people see we ' re interested in quality , not quantity , we ' ll be OK , &quot; he says . &quot; But you don ' t get two chances ( at success ) anymore . Just one. &quot; So Kia is praying for public patience with its slow , hesitant , underpowered , even false , start . For each week moves the company closer to fall ; a dealer base spreading beyond California , Nevada , Arizona , Washington , Texas and New Mexico , and the promise of 1995 Sephias with more muscular engines , optional anti-lock brakes and air_bags . In November , there will be the Sportage , a 140-horsepower sport utility with the looks of an undersized Ford Explorer . Next year , Kia plans a sedan for a doughty attempt on the mid-size crowns of Honda Accord , Toyota Camry and Ford Taurus . For buyers , wisdom could be a single word : Wait .
