   <HEADLINE> VOTERS RELUCTANT TO CREDIT CLINTON FOR RECOVERY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Working Americans to Bill_Clinton : Yes , Mr. President , it ' s still the economy . But it ' s hard to believe_in a recovery that you can ' t see or feel . It has become perhaps the biggest puzzle in this extraordinary election season . The recovery appears to be in_full_swing but Americans aren ' t giving Clinton and his fellow Democrats much credit for it . If the economy is going so well , why are so many voters in such a foul mood ? The politicians and pundits might be stumped by the mysterious absence of a Clinton economic bounce this year , but some economists believe that they have found the answer . And it is a surprisingly simple one : For the typical American family , they say , things aren ' t so great after all . The relatively robust growth of the economy and the drumbeat of positive economic reports emanating from Washington mask an underlying and far more troubling trend : American wages , benefits and living standards have continued to slide during the first two years of Clinton ' s presidency , even as_many workers are putting_in longer hours at less secure jobs . Granted , American businesses are enjoying booming profits and surging productivity . But most of the rewards are going_to a relatively narrow slice of the electorate -- highly educated , affluent households -- while the typical American family continues to tread water . What ' s more , the corporate cost-cutting and layoffs that have been the hallmark of the early 1990s have left deep scars on worker psyches , making them more fearful of the future and less willing to pressure employers for bigger salaries and better benefits . Little wonder that most Americans aren ' t impressed when they hear Clinton and his advisers tout the recovery , which has increased the economy ' s annual growth to 3.7 % since Clinton took_office , or the beneficial effects of the Administration ' s economic_policies . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s mysterious at all , &quot; said Allen Sinai , chief economist at Lehman Brothers Global Economics in New York . &quot; There is a squeeze on American workers today . . . . Productivity gains and low inflation are coming_on the backs of American workers . We ' ve got what looks_like the healthiest economy in decades , but that doesn ' t sound good if you are working two or three jobs without any benefits , and your wife is working , and you ' re just keeping even with where you used to be , and you don ' t have much leisure_time or time for your family. &quot; One troubling piece of evidence was provided this month by the Census_Bureau , which reported that the median family income declined 1 % in 1993 , after adjusting for inflation . Today , median household income is stuck at its lowest level in a decade , down more_than 7 % from its 1989 peak . The steady erosion of household income has continued unabated since the recovery officially began three years ago . &quot; Changes in income is a better barometer of political trends than national unemployment_rates or changes in the national economic_growth rate , &quot; said Jack Pitney , a political_scientist at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont . &quot; Income is what Ronald Reagan was talking_about when he asked : ' Are you better_off than you were four years ago ? ' &quot; A recent Los Angeles Times Poll suggests that Americans are riven with economic anxiety . Of those surveyed , 50 % said they disapprove of Clinton ' s handling of the economy and 63 % said they think the economy is_on shaky ground . Only 41 % said they believe that a recovery is under way , while 53 % said they believe that the economy is still mired in recession , and 75 % said they are convinced that the unemployment_rate in their communities will remain about the same or get_worse in the next three months . Some findings seem to defy reality . Although the economy has created approximately 4.8 million new jobs since December , 1992 , and the jobless rate has dropped from 7.6 % to 5.9 % , only 20 % of those polled said they believe that the unemployment situation is improving . ( The survey , supervised by Times Poll Director John Brennan , queried 1 # 272 adults , including 1 # 016 self-identified registered voters , from Oct . 17 to Oct . 19 . The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. ) Without widespread appreciation of his economic accomplishments , some analysts believe , Clinton becomes vulnerable to a host of other voter concerns , from controversies concerning his personal affairs to doubts about his leadership abilities . At the same time , some analysts say , the lingering perception of economic stagnation seems to be generating a poorly focused sense of anger that is directed not just at Clinton but also at Washington as an institution . In their view , Clinton is a victim only because he is the latest leader to get_in the way . &quot; Clinton has done some good things , but things are just not as_good_as they should be , &quot; said Charles Daniel , a 50-year-old mechanical supervisor for a construction company in Liberty , Tex . &quot; We ' re still at the same pace of life that we ' ve been at for the last three years . . . . People are still out_of_work and companies are still moving overseas . I ' ve been working steady , I haven ' t been laid_off in four years , but I don ' t have any benefits and I ' ve got_to have health coverage through my wife ' s job , &quot; said Daniel , who participated in the Times Poll . Leslie Marvin , a young mother in Ottawa , Kan. , expressed similar frustration . &quot; I ' m really disappointed with what Clinton is doing . . . around here , it just doesn ' t seem to be doing too good . There ' s still a lot of people laid_off around here . . . . I ' ve been trying to find a job , but it ' s really hard for someone who hasn ' t completed college , &quot; she said . This voter antipathy toward Clinton and his economic_policies has the White_House frazzled . Many in the Administration believe that Clinton has been denied the rightful political benefits that generally accrue to an incumbent President during a period of solid economic_growth . Clinton aides tick_off the numbers : three years of declining budget_deficits for the first time since the Harry S . Truman Administration , an economy contributing more_than twice as much to world growth as the other six major industrialized nations combined and rapid job creation combined with consumer inflation that remains below 3 % per year . &quot; There are more_than 4 million people out there working who weren ' t working before Bill_Clinton became President , &quot; said Alicia Munnell , assistant Treasury_secretary for economic affairs . &quot; They have families , and you ' d think they would be happy . . . . But you don ' t even see that. &quot; Oddly , recent surveys show that consumer confidence has been rising at_the_same_time that many Americans voice deep dissatisfaction with the economy . &quot; People know there is a recovery , sort of ; they recognize the numbers , &quot; said political analyst Kevin Phillips . &quot; But they don ' t see it as a strong recovery , or as a recovery that is strong enough to restore their economic standing. &quot; Some analysts are convinced that the recovery ' s failure to generate any real wage growth or narrow the income gap between highly and poorly educated Americans explains much of the public ' s ambivalence toward Clinton ' s economic_policies . The striking disconnect between the macro-perspective provided by government statistics and the micro-view observed by the public seems to be at the heart of Clinton ' s political troubles . At the same time , the numbers contain a note of caution for Republicans . These are not the kind of economic trends that typically benefit conservatives . And they are not directly addressed by the Republican_Party ' s new &quot; contract with America , &quot; which calls_for a balanced_budget amendment and tax cuts for businesses . Republican leaders are clearly trying to steal the &quot; middle-class squeeze &quot; issue away from Clinton by noting that middle-class families have fared worse under Clinton than they did under Reagan . Even so , current economic_conditions could foster anger with incumbents of either party . Other statistics bear_out the complaint of many Americans that they seem to be working harder but taking_home less . The average number of overtime hours U.S. workers put_in recently hit its highest level since 1970 , according to the Labor_Department . Productivity , as measured by hourly output per worker , has zoomed to an all-time high , rising 19 % since 1980 . that ' s great news for U.S. corporations , but it means long , hard days for the average worker . While the recovery has created millions of new jobs , at least half of them are what economist Sinai terms &quot; soft jobs &quot; -- many are part-time or temporary , pay low wages or offer limited benefits . Employment at temporary-service agencies as a percentage of the work_force is at its highest levels in at least a generation , while the number of Americans with employer-provided health_insurance fell from 62 % in 1988 to 57 % last year . Employment in manufacturing -- a traditional source of high-wage , full-time work -- has posted a net decline of 280 # 000 jobs since the recovery began . &quot; It ' s clear that the majority of people don ' t have reason to feel good about the economy , &quot; said Harvard_University economist Lawrence Katz . &quot; And most of the growth that we are seeing is benefiting people with relatively high levels of education and who are already relatively affluent , and that is worsening our income gap. &quot; This growing inequality is based in large part on educational achievement . A study issued this month by the Federal_Reserve_Board shows that the only broad population group to experience income growth between 1989 and 1992 were higher-income families headed by college graduates . A Census_Bureau study shows that college-educated workers have suffered only a slight decline in health coverage ; most of the benefit reductions have befallen poorly educated workers in low-skilled jobs . Not surprisingly , Administration officials have begun to echo their predecessors in the George_Bush Administration . Perhaps the White_House hasn ' t communicated its accomplishments clearly enough , they say , or perhaps Americans should show more patience and give the recovery -- and Clinton ' s policies -- more time to work . &quot; Maybe the message hasn ' t been heard , or maybe this wasn ' t a typical recession and we haven ' t had a typical recovery , &quot; said Laura D ' Andrea Tyson , chief of the Council of Economic Advisers . &quot; But the President talked in 1992 about how Americans were working more for less , and you can ' t change a trend like that -- which has been going_on for 15 years -- in a period of 20 months , &quot; she said . &quot; We have put the recovery on a strong foundation , and now we have begun a strategy to deal with the economy ' s long-term problems. &quot; The White_House recognizes that such assurances won ' t help much in this fall ' s elections . So Administration officials are eager to prove to impatient voters that their policies are beginning to improve the lot of all Americans ; the Administration recently released a preliminary study showing that more jobs in high-wage industries were created in the first few months of 1994 than in the past five years combined . In addition , White_House officials point_out that last year ' s expansion of the earned-income tax_credit for the working poor , which took_effect in April , will provide significant relief for 15 million working families when they receive big tax refunds next spring . Other Clinton programs are just now kicking_in as well . His re-employment and retraining initiatives for the long-term unemployed , for example , began to pump money into state programs in July . Some Democratic leaders , express hope that voters will soon judge Clinton ' s economic_policies more objectively . &quot; I think people are grudgingly beginning to see that progress is being made , &quot; said Rep . Vic Fazio , ( D-West Sacramento ) , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee . &quot; As the public takes a second look_at Republicans , I think they will be interested in seeing that our progress continue. &quot;</TEXT>
