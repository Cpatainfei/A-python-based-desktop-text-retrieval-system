   <HEADLINE> TEAMSTERS STRIKE SHUTS DOWN TRUCKING FIRMS ; LABOR : 22 LARGE COMPANIES CLOSE . OTHER BUSINESSES COULD BE VULNERABLE TO SHORTAGES IF THE WALKOUT LASTS A WEEK OR MORE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the first nationwide trucking strike in 15 years , the Teamsters shut_down 22 large trucking_companies Wednesday , forcing customers to scramble for available carriers and raising fears of serious disruptions to commerce if the walkout continues . With no new labor negotiations scheduled , about 75 # 000 Teamsters across the country walked picket_lines outside truck terminals in one of the largest strikes since the mid-1980s . There were only a_few reports of scattered , minor violence . The initial impact was minimal for businesses , but many factories and retail_stores -- many of which have adopted a policy of keeping lean inventories in recent years -- could be vulnerable to shortages if the strike lasts a week or more , transportation observers said . &quot; If we get_into Week 2 , inventories start to get drawn down and things start to get serious , &quot; said Douglas Rockel , a trucking_industry analyst at Merrill Lynch Research . &quot; After two weeks ' time , we could start to see shortages and prices might be increased. &quot; The 22 firms paralyzed by the strike move about 18 % of the nation ' s total freight . However , they transport about half of all mid-size shipments over long distances . Nearly every Fortune 500 company and countless smaller firms rely_on the companies to deliver everything from auto parts to computers , clothing and home_appliances . But the firms move little in the way of food shipments , which are transported primarily by non-union companies or store-owned fleets . &quot; We are not making any pickups in the country today , &quot; said Kathy Finlen , a spokeswoman for Overland Park , Kan.-based Yellow Freight System , the largest of nation ' s so-called less-than-truckload carriers , which move shipments primarily of 10 # 000 pounds or less . In Orange County , the story was much the same . &quot; They ' re on strike here , &quot; said Mike Marcourt , office manager of Yellow Freight ' s Orange terminal . &quot; We ' re shut down. &quot; Down the street , striking Teamsters gathered at another local truck terminal , toting picket signs that urged support for the job action . &quot; Our solidarity with the national Teamsters is strong . No matter what , we back each other up , &quot; said Raymond R . Robberson , a driver for Consolidated Freightways , a trucking_company based in Menlo Park , Calif . Robberson was among 25 drivers who picketed in front of the company ' s terminal on Batavia Road in Orange . The drivers vowed to stick_with the strike until union officials call it off . &quot; we ' ll be here as long as it takes , 24 hours , day and night , &quot; Robberson said . As several motorists passing the strikers honked their horns_in solidarity , Robberson predicted the walkout would have a crippling effect throughout the United States . &quot; Everything you see , everything in your house comes_by truck , &quot; said Robberson , who is with Teamsters Local 952 in Orange County . &quot; Everyone will feel this sooner or later. &quot; CF Motor Freight of Menlo Park , Calif. , said its 500 truck terminals nationwide were closed after its nearly 19 # 000 Teamster workers walked_off their jobs . But a non-union sister company , Con-Way Transportation Services , remained open , a spokeswoman said . In fact , the majority of the nation ' s trucking_companies , which are not covered by the Teamster contract , and independent truckers remained open Wednesday and reported a stream of new customers seeking available space . Roy Ecclefield , operations manager for California Transportation Service in Laguna Niguel , hoped the potentially devastating strike would mean a financial windfall for his firm . California Transportation Service uses non-union drivers to ship everything from canned_food to machine parts . Ecclefield said on Wednesday morning that he received an unexpected shipping order from a company frantic to get its products on_the_road . He expected similar orders in the next few days . &quot; They ' re going to call us , &quot; he said . &quot; If everyone else is down , they got nowhere else to go . I ' m sure business will pick up. &quot; Like other companies eager to forestall any shipping slowdown , Ingram Micro Inc. , one of the world ' s largest distributors of microcomputer products , anticipated the strike . A company spokeswoman said that warehouse managers began calling non-union trucking_companies to take_up the slack created by the strike . The company normally uses both union and non-union drivers . The Santa Ana-based company , consequently , had experienced no problems on Wednesday and did not anticipate any if the strike continues . &quot; We wanted to ensure no disruption in our service and there has not been , &quot; the spokeswoman said . Other non-union trucking_companies were also feeling the effects . &quot; We are getting a tremendous influx of additional freight volume , &quot; said Jeff Jordan , a spokesman for Overnite Transportation , a large non-union trucking_company with headquarters in Richmond , Va . * Jordan said the company will put workers on overtime and run its trucks to handle the additional orders , but some shipments may have to wait . &quot; We are at or near capacity in most places. &quot; In some cases , competing firms can handle only a small portion of the freight handled by the 22 firms . United Parcel Service , for example , is prepared to handle more business but can move shipments of only 150 pounds or less , a spokesman said . Talks broke_off last week between the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Trucking Management Inc. , which represents the trucking firms in_labor negotiations , after the union rejected what the companies described as their last offer . The Teamsters said company proposals to allow greater use of part-time workers and railroads would eventually lead to lower starting pay and job losses . The unionized companies , which face stiff competition from fast-growing non-union firms with lower costs , say the proposals are necessary to ensure their long-term survival . On Wednesday , Trucking Management agreed to let many of its smaller members sign interim agreements with the Teamsters to allow them to continue operating during the strike . Those firms , which operate primarily on the East Coast and employ about 10 # 000 Teamsters , would adopt the terms_of_a_contract when one is reached . In Southern California , which is home to an estimated 7 # 000 to 10 # 000 union_members affected by the strike , Teamster picket_lines formed outside about 100 terminals . Sympathetic drivers honked their truck and car_horns as they passed about 25 strikers peacefully walking a picket_line in front of the Yellow Freight System and CF terminals on East Washington Boulevard in Los Angeles early Wednesday afternoon . Management proposals to hire more part-time workers seemed to be the strongest factor prompting the Teamsters to picket . &quot; They just want to increase their profits and turn this into a part-time industry , &quot; said Zack Lopez , a local driver for Yellow who has been hauling freight for the company for 27 years . In Pacoima , Teamster Kelly Price worried about the strike ' s impact on his family . Price and his wife , Annette , are expecting their third child . He said a long strike would hurt his family . &quot; We will have to dip_into our savings , but that would last for about two months , &quot; said Price , who was picketing in front of Roadway Express Inc. &quot; But I will not cross the picket line. &quot; The first day of the strike found many companies shifting to other carriers to avoid disruptions . &quot; The potential for a negative impact on inventory increases the longer the strike lasts , &quot; said Laura Melillo , spokeswoman for R . H . Macy &amp; Co. , operator of the Bullock ' s and I . Magnin chains . Macy , like many other retailers , has a lean inventory system , which gives store operators the flexibility to quickly change product mix . However , anticipating a possible strike , Macy ordered and received much of its spring line of clothing earlier than usual , Melillo said . Wal-Mart , the nation ' s largest retailer , was also prepared_for the strike . &quot; The company had selected alternative carriers as backups for the small percentage of our carriers who are Teamsters , &quot; said Jane Arend , a Wal-Mart spokeswoman . Operations at the nation ' s Big Three auto_manufacturers , while not immediately affected by the walkout , could be disrupted if the strike lasts beyond this week . * The reasons : Auto_makers increasingly depend_on outside suppliers for parts and components ; they are using just-in-time inventory_controls that reduce manufacturing costs but leave plants with few spare_parts , and high demand for cars and trucks has plants operating at capacity , using parts on_hand quickly . Chrysler Corp . could be the most vulnerable to a prolonged Teamster walkout because it relies_on outside suppliers for 70 % of its parts . Its factories are running full tilt to meet the record demand for its vehicles . &quot; We are looking_at some alternatives to deal with a strike of short duration , &quot; Chrysler spokesman Lee Sechler said . A trucking strike in 1979 , when the Teamsters were far more powerful , ended_up crippling the auto industry with a walkout-turned-lockout that lasted 10 days . The cutoff in freight service prompted General Motors to lay off 12 # 400 workers . The Chrysler Corp . shut_down almost completely , closing nine of its 10 North_American auto assembly_plants . The 300 # 000 truck_drivers and warehouse workers affected by that dispute went_back to work after a settlement was reached providing 30 % increases in wages and benefits over three years . * Times staff writers James M .
