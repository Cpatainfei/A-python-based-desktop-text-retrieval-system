   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON RUSSIAN POLITICS ; CAN SOLZHENITSYN BREAK A DEADLOCK ? ; HE WILL NO DOUBT BE A POWERBROKER , AND HIS MODERATE NATIONALISM CAN TAKE_CARE OF THE NEO-FASCISTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alexander Solzhenitsyn is about to end his 20-year exile and return to his native Russia . &quot; I hope I can be at least of some help to my tormented nation , &quot; he recently told a town_meeting in Cavendish , Vt . Many in his homeland harbor similar hopes . The desperate conditions Russia faces today make his entry into politics not only feasible but also desirable . The political process in today ' s Russia is hopelessly deadlocked . It is immaterial who is heading the government , for the state currently has no power to carry_out a coherent policy or enforce its decrees . A recent proof is Boris Yeltsin ' s embarrassing failure to block the release from prison of his political foes . But the ultra-patriots have failed to capitalize on Yeltsin ' s weakness . As Yeltsin ' s ratings slip , so do Vladimir Zhirinovsky ' s . The economic situation in the country remains gloomy . Political pressure compels government to step_up subsidies to money-losing enterprises . Cross-breeding between state bureaucracies and organized crime is proceeding apace . Private companies add little to the nation ' s manufacturing capabilities and are tied primarily to service , inflation-driven financial speculation and dumping raw_materials on world markets . Those entrepreneurs who are willing to invest in production are saddled with taxes on profit exceeding 80 % . The public ' s patience is strained to the limit . Workers in state enterprises go_for months without pay and see their salaries devoured by inflation . Although retirees have their pensions indexed to inflation , they are doomed to subsist close to the poverty_line . All vital indicators -- crime , ecological calamities , increasing suicide rates , negative population growth -- point to a country in distress . The yearning for a bold leader and a powerful state has never been stronger in Russia . Calls_for law and order are heard not only from the red-brown ( communists / ultranationalists ) alliance but also from labor , business and the clergy . Even some liberal politicians wonder if market mechanisms alone would suffice to bring a viable market_economy and functioning democracy to Russia . Once firmly opposed to authoritarian rule , Russian liberals now mull_over the &quot; Chilean model &quot; and remind themselves that Augusto Pinochet brought_in American economists to restore his country ' s market_economy . that ' s the backdrop against which we must view Solzhenitsyn ' s possible entry into Russia ' s politics . Can he assume the strongman ' s mantle ? Should the West fear him as a new Ayatollah Khomeini or welcome his as a bulwark against Russian fundamentalism ? While he is unlikely to run_for a public office , Solzhenitsyn is certain to use his authority to break the country ' s stalemate . Hence , the need to take a closer look_at his statements . Solzhenitsyn ' s critics charge that he disdains the West , overstates Russia ' s uniqueness and espouses veiled anti-Semitism . He has strenuously denied such charges . Moreover , he pointedly refused to endorse pseudo-patriotic factions that fan hatred in Russia . Solzhenitsyn criticized the West for its litigious ways and pursuit of unlimited economic_growth , but he has never favored autocracy over democracy or renounced Western civilization . In domestic politics , Solzhenitsyn comes_across as a regionalist . An admirer of Switzerland ' s canton system , he wants to see Moscow delegate as much power as possible to local administrations . Solzhenitsyn ' s foreign_policy would block efforts to restore the Russian empire and encourage a loose federation of Slavic states emerging from the gradually renewed ties between Russia and its neighbors . In the economic sphere , Solzhenitsyn urges a shift from unsustainable economic expansion to the post-industrial agenda combining a controlled growth , environmentally sound development and concern for the economically disadvantaged . Since his days in the gulag , Solzhenitsyn has harbored contempt for professional criminals and is certain to clamp_down on organized_crime , which intimidates local producers . Solzhenitsyn ' s social_policies are more problematic . His moral rigorism , contempt for mass_culture and orthodox religious convictions make Western-style liberals wonder if he will tolerate alternative lifestyles and show sensitivity toward religious minorities . He may be uneasy about feminism and have little taste for rock_music , but that does not mean he will use state power to impose his personal preferences on others . It is wishful_thinking to paint Solzhenitsyn as Russia ' s would-be savior . Still , we need to lay out scenarios for the future that could alleviate human suffering . Given the current deadlock in Russia , Solzhenitsyn is bound to emerge as a power-broker , and his impact on his nation ' s politics could be positive . His moderate nationalism is sure to cut the neo-fascists down to size . His foreign_policy would be welcomed by the West . Even his puritanism might be what Russia ' s nascent capitalism needs to legitimize itself in the public mind . At 75 , Solzhenitsyn has no time to waste .</TEXT>
