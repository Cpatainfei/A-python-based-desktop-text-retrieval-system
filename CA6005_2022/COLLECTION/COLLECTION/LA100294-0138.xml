   <HEADLINE> BACK TO BASICS ON HEALTH_CARE ; WHEN WE RESUME THE BATTLE NEXT YEAR , THE NATION MUST REMEMBER WHY REFORM WAS NEEDED IN THE FIRST PLACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By now you ' ve read all_the convoluted reasons health-care reform officially died for 1994 . It ' s because Harry and Louise were more believable than that other fun couple , Hillary ( Rodham Clinton ) and Ira ( C . Magaziner ) . It ' s because Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) makes Haitian Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras seem like a reasonable guy . It ' s because Rep . Dan Rostenkowski ( D-Ill. ) was caught giving_away official chairs . It ' s because voters want change but only if nothing is different . It ' s because President Bill_Clinton got distracted by events in Lower Koda-Chromistan and the crisis over amphibian rights . And so on and on . Yet , the most important factor has been missed in last week ' s zillions of words of commentary . This reason is the simplest : All parties lost sight of why health-care reform was needed in the first place . There are two underlying reasons for significant reform of the health-care system . One is the moral imperative of universal coverage : both to protect the 37 million Americans who lack health_insurance , and to guarantee that those who have insurance don ' t lose_it if they change jobs . The second reason is the U.S. approach to health_care costs too_much . Throughout this year ' s debate , the U.S. health-care system has been variously portrayed by the Hillary Clinton faction as falling_apart at the seams , by the Dole faction as totally peachy-keen . Both views diverge from the clinical reality . In terms of quality , American health_care is ab-fab ( absolutely fabulous , if you missed this summer ' s slang ) . But not everybody qualifies , and for those who do , the price is too high -- 14 % of U.S. gross_domestic_product vs . 9 % to 10 % in countries like France and Switzerland , which offer just as much high-tech care , yet insure everyone at lower cost . The worst flaw of the President ' s plan was that rather than offer a simple system of cost controls specified by the federal_government but carried_out by the private sector , Clinton would have created multiple new bureaucracies to attack the wrong question in health_care . The bureaucracies would have gone_after care_delivery -- generally , the ab-fab part of the system -- while skirting the core problem , the price of care . As the debate progressed , the White_House abandoned cost controls , putting its energies behind what were , in_effect , new taxes ( the &quot; employer mandate &quot; ) on the assumption that since health costs can never come_down , universal coverage means spending must go_up , and for that , somebody must pay . This represents at once a spectacular misreading of public sentiment on taxes and of proven ideas that have worked in countries with high-tech universal care at reasonable prices . Focusing_on universal coverage and lower costs could have allowed a far more intelligent , politically appealing reform proposal to emerge and be enacted last year . But first , let ' s look_at the lessons learned from the health-care collapse : * Don ' t propose 1 # 400-page ideas . The initial Hillary Clinton-Magaziner package was so overwrought with mandates and formulas that , from the moment the forklift lowered it to the President ' s desk , there existed zero chance it could be enacted . Whatever health plan rises from this year ' s ashes must be simple , focusing_on the two things that matter -- universal coverage and cutting costs . * Washington should mandate goals , but leave the details to the people in the field . In the Clinton plan , hundreds of pages of details were supposed to micromanage every aspect of hospital and physician life . Give it up ! Next year ' s health-reform plan must take the federalist approach of setting a_few vital goals but leaving doctors , hospital administrators and other professionals to achieve those goals using superior knowledge of what happens in the real_world . * Forget the Medicare magic asterisk . Both Democratic and GOP alternatives to the Clinton plan seemed nice in that they imposed no new taxes , but lacking cost controls sought to finance themselves in a preposterous way -- by assuming unspecified future cuts_in Medicare spending . But in the past decade , typical Medicare fees paid to doctors and hospitals have already declined to about 60 % of typical private-pay fees . Rather than cutting Medicare , health-care reform ought to drive private-pay fees toward the Medicare level . It is important to note that about 60 % of the U.S. private-pay level is about where medical fees in France and Germany now sit . At this level , doctors still are affluent , but social costs for health_care are within reason and universal care is affordable . * Get business on board . This seems impossible to believe a mere year later , but at the outset of the Clinton proposals , most big business supported health reform -- its eyes focused_on the fact that the price of U.S. health_care is too high . But when Hillary ' s faction became wedded to new taxes on employers and new layers of bureaucracy , the Fortune 500 jumped ship . This group must be back on board well before the next sailing time . * Cut the fat , not the lean . Though well-intentioned , the Clinton plan contained one deeply cynical aspect . Because the White_House was terrified of proposing the fee-setting system that has restrained medical prices in Western Europe , the Administration offered_up limits on total regional spending ( &quot; global budgets &quot; ) and on how much insurers could charge policyholders . But if fees by doctors and hospitals stay high while the total pool of money to be spent is capped , what is the only way health costs can be restrained ? Rationing . Had Clinton ' s plan passed , most Americans would have been compelled to join HMOs , which , in turn , would have been compelled to ration care -- with the blame then seeming to fall on the HMOs . It would be far better for Washington to take the blame for a simple system of setting medical fees that would control costs through lower prices , not rationing . * Go_after the insurers , not the docs and the druggists . For reasons that escape everyone , Hillary Clinton and Magaziner decided early on to attack physicians ( who may charge too_much but who night and day do genuine work of lasting value ) and pharmaceutical companies ( whose products may be overpriced but save thousands of lives annually ) while making nicey-nicey with health insurers ( who are , at best , paper shufflers ) . This weird strategy imploded when the insurance lobby , knowing itself to be the most featherbedded medical sector , merrily stabbed the White_House in the back . The Health_Insurance Assn . of America , sponsor of those simpleton Harry and Louise ads , became the new National Rifle Assn. , brazenly distorting the Clinton plan . * The docs were moving forward while everybody else peddled back . Through the closing months of the health-care debate , only one major interest_group said anything that did not serve its own financial interest -- the doctors . The AMA warmly endorsed universal care and signaled to the White_House it would accept some restrictions on fees in return for malpractice revisions and dropping the plan ' s micromanagement aspect . Somehow , it went unnoticed when , in February , the American College of Surgeons -- representing the best-paid doctors -- endorsed a Canadian-style &quot; single-payer &quot; system . Why would the leading surgeons ' group endorse the Canadian approach ? Because Canadian medicine ( and the similar French , German and Swiss systems ) offers realistic prices , free choice of private practitioners , traditional fee-for-service arrangements , high-tech care and physician autonomy -- which to the surgeons sounds like a pretty good combination . It is -- and it ought to be the focus of next year ' s plan . Here ' s how : Suppose next year ' s health-care package did these things : achieved universal coverage by abolishing Medicaid , a monstrously complicated , state-run , federally financed program that doesn ' t work , then making everyone not covered by a private health plan eligible for Medicare , a sensible , privately run , federally financed program that does_work ; made private insurance accessible at lower-cost by imposing standard benefit packages sold to all at uniform premiums , regardless of &quot; pre-existing conditions ; &quot; required employers either to provide standard plans or pay the equivalent cost per worker into Medicare support ; created a National Health Board , run_by doctors , hospital executives and neutral parties , that cuts the fees physicians , hospitals and drug_companies may charge , and otherwise left medicine alone . No big bureaucracy ; doctors remain private practitioners , patients retain choice over who treats them . Sound like wishful_thinking ? This is basically a description of medicine as organized in Germany , the former Western part . German medicine , covering 100 % of citizens plus all illegal immigrants , costs $ 1 # 750 per capita ; U.S. medicine , covering only 85 % of the legal population , costs $ 3 # 000 per capita . German medicine employs the same technology as U.S. medicine and is delivered on-demand , without the queues that plague the_English system . German medicine offers more hospital_beds per capita than the United States , an important measure of on-demand capacity ; average hospital stays are longer in Germany than in the United States , because lower costs mean there is no need for the American philosophy of rocket-propelled discharge . Life expectancies , infant_mortality and other measures of health-care success in Germany are the same as , or slightly better than , in the United States . Meanwhile , German doctors work for themselves , not government ; insurers are private . They do about the same number and type of procedures as U.S. doctors , but following federal fee schedules , simply charge less . Because fees and insurance provisions are standard , doctors can practice without endless hassles regarding paperwork . Because paperwork burdens are few , doctors can earn handsome livings from lower fees , as they need not subsidize huge accounting departments . How does Germany do_it ? The key is federally set fee schedules for health-care providers . Government sets the fees , using a surprisingly small bureaucracy : The private sector does everything else -- from selling reasonably standardized insurance_policies to running the hospitals and doctor ' s offices . German medicine , covering everyone , costs slightly less than 10 % of GDP , versus about 14.2 % in the United States . Physicians in ( West ) Germany still are well-paid , averaging $ 110 # 000 annually , around three-quarters of what U.S. physicians make . Suppose U.S. health spending were reduced , mainly through federally set fee schedules , halfway to the level of German spending : declining to about 12 % of GDP , which would still leave U.S. medicine the world ' s most expensive . This would save a phenomenal $ 130 billion per year -- more_than enough to pay_for universal coverage ; to expand coverage for mental_illness and long-term care , and still leave the U.S. system less expensive than today . The solution to the U.S. health-care dilemma is not more bureaucracy and taxes , as Clinton proposed , nor pretending that no problem exists , as the Republican obstructionists say . The solution is what works in Germany , France and Switzerland : federally set reductions in medical fees combined with universal coverage . A bill to accomplish this in the United States would run far less than 1 # 400 pages .</TEXT>
