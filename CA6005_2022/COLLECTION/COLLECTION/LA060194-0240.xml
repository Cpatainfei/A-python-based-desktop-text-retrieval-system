   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION : CHANNEL SURFER WIPES_OUT ON A WAVE OF TV</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Tabloid Gossip Column . . . . Boob Job ! ! ! Who were the boobs who made the opportunistic decision to rerun &quot; Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy &quot; last week , as if Jaclyn Smith ' s portrayal of the real Jackie Kennedy in this inept 1981 television production captured the essence of the charismatic woman whose death launched a_thousand eulogies and retrospectives ? Who ? The boobs at KTLA-TV Channel 5 . And speaking_of blatant opportunism -- to say nothing of unlabeled commercialism -- coming next Wednesday night on CBS is &quot; A Busch Gardens / Sea World Celebration , &quot; an hourlong summer vacation tip being produced for the Anheuser Busch Theme Parks . It has the same taint as &quot; Treasure Island , &quot; an alleged children ' s special set_in the new Treasure Island park at the Treasure Island Hotel in Las Vegas . The hotel ' s parent firm , Mirage Resorts , was the sponsor of this NBC hour last January . Continuing on this grimy path , ABC ' s June 15 special , &quot; The Lion King : The Musical Special With Elton John , &quot; is produced by the Wrightwood Group in association with Disney Television . John wrote the music and Tim Rice the lyrics for &quot; The Lion King , &quot; an animated movie from Disney that opens in New York and Los Angeles June 15 , the same day as the TV special and three days after the June 12 premiere of &quot; The Making of ' The Lion King ' &quot; on the Disney Channel . This &quot; documentary &quot; has three additional airdates this month . And oh yes , tonight finds CBS airing &quot; Movie News Hot Summer Sneak_Preview , &quot; a program that profiles / promotes four coming Disney films . And what a coincidence ! It was produced by Disney ' s Buena Vista Pictures in association with the Wrightwood Group . Exclusive to Me ! ! ! Where are some of L.A. ' s most prominent journalists now ? &quot; Another job well done_by professional firefighters . . . . &quot; A familiar face and voice ? Yes , standing in front of some sort of emergency vehicle , it ' s none other_than Alex Paen , former foreign affairs specialist for KABC-TV Channel 7 ' s &quot; Eyewitness News , &quot; now displaying just as much authority and credibility as host of the syndicated &quot; reality &quot; series &quot; Emergency Call. &quot; And he ' s still a traveling man . Paen : &quot; This next emergency takes us to Baltimore . . . . &quot; Meanwhile , who was that familiar figure checking in from Burbank for the notorious tabloid series &quot; Hard Copy &quot; ? &quot; Thank you , Jodi , &quot; said anchor Terry Murphy to the reporter who had just finished a stand-up , former KCBS-TV Channel 2 &quot; Action News &quot; reporter Jodi Baskerville . Shocking Truth ! ! ! Which local news reporter was horrified recently to learn the truth about her own business ? Are you ready ? None other_than Pat Lalama , subbing this week for Linda Alvarez on the KCBS morning news . When entertainment reporter David Sheehan made his video pick of the week &quot; Broadcast News &quot; -- the James L . Brooks movie that satirizes the sham aspects of TV news -- Lalama replied that she ' d just seen the 1987 movie herself . Poor woman . You could read the disillusionment on her face when she said to co-anchor Brad Goode : &quot; It ' s a sad state of affairs if that ' s really what our business is like. &quot; Now that Lalama may know the awful truth , will she have the heart to continue in the business or will she resign out of principle ? Read the Tabloid Gossip Column to find_out . Body_Parts ! ! ! What sexy Hollywood Goddess of the ' 50s and ' 60s was ogled and graphically displayed from head to toe on TV recently ? Read on . &quot; Those stunning eyes . . . that beauty mark . . . that platinum hair . . . . &quot; Yes , added the pitchwoman on cable ' s QVC channel , &quot; no one would dazzle quite like Marilyn Monroe. &quot; She added : &quot; Whenever you see a book on Marilyn or a photograph , you stop and gaze . There is just something about her . . . . &quot; To prove it , the QVC camera moved slowly down Marilyn ' s curvaceous body . No , not the real Marilyn , stupid , Marilyn the 11.5-inch-tall vinyl doll , the one that your friends &quot; will admire , &quot; the pitchwoman promised , &quot; when they come_over to your house. &quot; Yes , what an exciting prospect : Featured in your living_room or greeting guests in your entry , your very own &quot; fully poseable &quot; Marilyn Monroe doll . &quot; She &quot; is a limited edition with a certificate of authenticity . &quot; This is a certificate you definitely want to hang_on to , &quot; said the pitchwoman . Just in case your admiring friends doubt you . And who are the buy-by-television zealots who would call QVC to order Marilyn ? Probably the same ones who swooned over the next doll featured on QVC , Sleeping_Beauty . &quot; She has this incredible wig that ' s so_long and so shiny , &quot; the pitchwoman said . &quot; You could feel comfortable taking a doll brush and brushing it out. &quot; Ooooooh . But not in front of Marilyn . She might get jealous . Pretty Faces ! ! ! Who is looking just marvelous in Tunis tonight ? Deborah Norville , that ' s who -- in the debut of the CBS News magazine show &quot; America Tonight , &quot; which she co-hosts with Dana King . On Tuesday , Norville showed_up on the syndicated &quot; Regis &amp; Kathie Lee &quot; series to promote her opening story about the adventures of a mother who recovered her kidnaped daughter in Tunisia . After watching a clip of Norville doing a stand-up , Regis Philbin was mightily impressed . Proving he ' s more_than just a pretty face himself , Regis weighed in on the proliferation of newsmagazine shows , telling Norville : &quot; that ' s the beauty of what you ' re doing . You can go_over there and do these stories at a fraction of the cost and more realistic than Hollywood. &quot; At last , a textbook justification for news : Not only cheaper than Hollywood , but also more realistic .</TEXT>
