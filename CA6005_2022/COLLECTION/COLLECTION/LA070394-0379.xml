   <HEADLINE> MIDYEAR INVESTMENT REVIEW AND OUTLOOK ; ' HARD ' ASSET BUYERS MAY BE RIGHT , BUT EARLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Investing in &quot; hard &quot; assets became a hot concept in the first_half , but the end results were fairly soft . The new raves for tangible investments , such_as gold , basic commodities and real_estate , were fueled largely by expectations of faster economic_growth -- and thus higher inflation . By definition , rising inflation means prices of tangible things go_up . And the flip side is that intangible investments , such_as stocks and bonds , usually suffer in times of higher inflation . So some investors either switched significant sums from stocks and bonds into hard assets in the first_half , or added small amounts of gold or other tangible investments to their stock and bond portfolios as a &quot; hedge. &quot; The payoff for being inflation-wary ? * Nothing in gold . Bullion ' s price , $ 390.80 at Jan . 1 , finished the half at $ 385.80. Most gold mining stocks fared much worse , diving after rocketing in ' 93 . * Basic commodities were mixed . Coffee futures leaped 165 % for the half , to $ 1.90 a pound , as shortages developed , and crude_oil futures surged 37 % , buoyed by the improving world economy . But lumber futures plunged 28 % as home building slowed ; grain prices melted with spring rains . Overall , the Knight-Ridder / Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 key commodities finished_up just 1.8 % for the half . * In real_estate , prices have clearly firmed on many types of properties and in many regions . But real_estate mutual_funds gave_up a meager 2.3 % gain as of June 16 to end the half down 1.1 % , on average . The problem for all_of these inflation hedges is that there is no serious U.S. inflation to speak_of , at least not yet . &quot; The evidence suggests that the commodity bulls may be right , but they are too early , &quot; argues David Shulman , investment strategist at Salomon Bros . in New York . He sees prices rising later in the decade , driven by increasing consumption in the developing world . But the process will be gradual , and in the meantime many basic commodities remain in excess supply , Shulman says . Even so , as the accompanying chart shows , commodity prices overall appear to be in a cyclical upswing . The CRB index is up 15 % from mid-1992 ; the last major commodity bull_run , from 1986 to 1988 , saw the CRB index rise about 30 % before topping out . Realistically , however , most investors aren ' t going_to play commodities directly . There is no CRB mutual_fund , and individual futures contracts are among the riskiest investments around , suitable only for speculators . But there are some relatively easy ways to add hard assets to a small portfolio , if you want to bet_on inflation , or partially hedge a stock-bond portfolio against damage from a surprise inflation surge : * Natural_resources mutual_funds . These generally own stocks of commodity producers -- companies operating in such businesses as energy , lumber and mining . This fund category had an average first-half loss of 0.1 % , which while disappointing still was far better than the 5.9 % loss on the typical stock fund . The biggest natural_resources fund is the Baltimore-based T . Rowe Price New Era fund , which inched up 0.5 % in the first_half after rising 15.3 % last year . Among funds focused_on energy , the Vanguard Group ' s Specialized Energy fund is up 4.8 % this year after a 26.5 % rise last year . * Gold funds . The average gold stock fund sank 11.4 % in the half , after soaring 81 % last year . Paul Stephens , whose San Francisco-based Robertson Stephens Contrarian fund is 25 % -invested in gold stocks , says the mining stocks need bullion to move decisively through $ 400 to restart their rally . That may take time , but it will happen , Stephens contends . As the world economy grows , inflation will naturally shift from financial assets to real assets , he argues . * Real_estate funds . Craig Litman , whose San Francisco-based firm Litman / Gregory designs mutual_fund portfolios for individuals , isn ' t enamored of most hedging ideas . But he likes real_estate mutual_funds , such_as Fidelity Real_Estate , as diversification tools for traditional stock and bond portfolios . The Fidelity fund rose 2.5 % in the first_half . Another , New York-based Cohen &amp; Steers Realty , was up 7.3 % . Real-estate mutual_funds generally own real_estate investment_trust stocks , or REITs , which own property directly . Litman expects demand for REITs from small- and mid-sized pension_funds to surge , because the funds increasingly are seeking to diversify into property , but only via liquid securities . Riding the Commodities Market_Prices of many commodities have risen this year as the world economy has picked_up steam . But the Knight-Ridder / Commodity Research Bureau futures index of 21 key commodities remains far below its peak level of the 1980s .
