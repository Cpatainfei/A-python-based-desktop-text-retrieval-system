   <HEADLINE> ON THE ISSUE : INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY ' S TOPICS ; SHOULD ' INMATE BILL OF RIGHTS ' BE MODIFIED ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 52-word &quot; inmate bill of rights &quot; in the California Penal Code has come under_attack by politicians and others who claim it allows state_prison inmates undeserved privileges such_as access to hard-core pornography , conjugal visits , marriage and the right to wear their hair any length . The measure , passed in 1968 and expanded in 1975 , states that inmates have the same rights as other residents and any narrowing of those rights must be directly related to the security of a prison . Two bills to repeal the measure , by state Sen . Robert Presley ( D-Riverside ) and Assemblyman Dean Andal ( R-Stockton ) , have passed their respective legislative houses and are awaiting further action . What changes , if any , should be made to the state ' s &quot; inmate bill of rights &quot; and why ? Richard Katz , Democratic state assemblyman , 39th District . &quot; I think a combination of symbolism and substantive ( aspects need to be eliminated ) . The substantive includes things like weekend visitation that the inmates enjoy while in prison , combined with the symbolism of the fact that prison is not supposed to be easy or fun . It ' s punishment for crimes against society . There is a sense that the rights of the inmate or the rights of the accused take greater precedence than the rights of the victim or of society. &quot; Bruce Hill , a private attorney in Woodland Hills who has represented 17 defendants facing the death_penalty . &quot; I think I ' d answer the question ( as_to changes ) in the negative , except for provisions I ' m not completely familiar_with , such_as making periodicals available to inmates . &quot; I think the political response has been somewhat naive , but it has been_well accepted given the public ' s attitude . Giving these rights to inmates is , number_one , humanitarian . I don ' t think the public wants a system where people are chained to walls . Second , people in control of the facilities will tell you these rights are vital in creating a ( tolerant ) attitude in institutions , not only among inmates , but for those responsible_for guarding them . To limit these rights can do nothing but increase violence among these inmates. &quot; John Ratelle , warden of the California State_Prison in Lancaster , which houses 3 # 977 inmates . &quot; The biggest issue . . . is inmates can get magazines and articles that are just atrocious and nasty . A rapist can get_it , a child_molester can get_it . . . . Sen . Presley ' s bill has the same rights that are under the civil constitution , but can limit ( publications received ) , and that ' s what we currently support . &quot; Restricting the right to marry ( is appropriate ) . The way it is now , male inmates can meet women through correspondence , or a female inmate can meet a male , and marry them while in prison . All they do is use the person . I think there should be some restrictions . . . . If they met before the person went_in prison , that ' s OK. &quot; John Spillane , head of the Antelope Valley branch of the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office . &quot; The public perception is that we ' coddle ' prisoners and , although that is not the case , they are given certain privileges such_as television , magazines and conjugal visits that many people feel , depending_on the circumstances of the crime committed , the inmates do not deserve . I can see where some of the Department of Corrections officials feel we need these privileges as inducements to good behavior . . . ( but ) rather than giving them to everyone , I would like to see them given to prisoners right before they go_out . The last year of their incarceration , perhaps , or as a reward for good behavior. &quot;</TEXT>
