   <HEADLINE> HOLLYWOOD TRAINS AN EYE ON ZBIGNIEW ZAMACHOWSKI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He may be one of Poland ' s most famous faces , but so far , most of America hasn ' t had the pleasure . In the next couple of weeks , though , 33-year-old actor Zbigniew Zamachowski will have two opportunities to catch Hollywood ' s eye . Zamachowski stars in both Krzysztof Kieslowski ' s &quot; The Decalogue , Part 10 , &quot; showing with Part Nine next Sunday at the AFI Festival , and Kieslowski ' s &quot; White , &quot; which opened this month . In a recent visit to Hollywood , the actor , who boasts immense soulful green eyes , sat next to his female interpreter in his hotel suite displaying supremely perfect posture and a bemused perspective on his new foreign environment . &quot; The room is extremely sophisticated in its technology , &quot; he says , pushing the computerized buttons on the clock that offer him a decadent array of options . &quot; Perhaps too sophisticated. &quot; * Although both &quot; The Decalogue &quot; and &quot; White &quot; are visions of the same director , Zamachowski was given the challenge of playing two diverse roles . In &quot; The Decalogue , &quot; he portrays a young rock_star who , along with his older brother , becomes obsessed with a valuable stamp_collection . In &quot; White &quot; -- the second of Kieslowski ' s trilogy &quot; Three Colors , &quot; based on the_French motto &quot; Liberty , Equality and Fraternity &quot; and the colors of the_French flag -- he faces the Angst and vicissitudes of love as the husband of a wayward wife , portrayed by French actress Julie Delpy . In &quot; The Decalogue , &quot; the actor sings and plays guitar , two talents that helped him originally get discovered in 1980 . After seeing Zamachowski perform at a national music festival , Polish director Krzysztof Rogulski cast him as the lead in the film &quot; The Great Picnic Party. &quot; Presumably , the title loses something in translation , because it was a huge hit in Poland ( it was never released in the United States ) . &quot; It was horrendously popular , &quot; Zamachowski says with a deep chuckle . That success prompted him to abandon his studies in economics and music and enroll in the famous Lodz Film School , from which he graduated in 1985 . Since that time , the actor has worked in more_than 30 films . His latest performance , in &quot; White , &quot; is perhaps his best , partly because , he says , the character is so meaty . &quot; Karol is more multidimensional , fuller , more human than Arthur ( his character in &quot; The Decalogue &quot; ) . &quot; On working with the notoriously taciturn Kieslowski , Zamachowski says : &quot; The work with Krzysztof was very specific . He was very cautious in his remarks . He leaves the acting not just to the actor but also to the camera operator . He allowed me a certain space of freedom . &quot; Allow me to tell you what it is like working with Krzysztof . A year before starting the filming ( of &quot; White &quot; ) , he told me that he was going_to make this movie with me and that he wrote the scenario with me in mind . I subsequently read with him one day before shooting was to start in Paris . &quot; We spoke_for about half an hour . He told me that I should keep_in mind the films of Charlie Chaplin . That doesn ' t mean that I should imitate him , which clearly would have been impossible . But I kept_in mind the aura that surrounds his films . He told me to keep_in mind a certain state of balance between what is tragic in this movie and what is comical . I didn ' t need any more words than that. &quot; * Zamachowski was raised in a small_town in central Poland by a truck_driver father and clerk mother . &quot; My family on both sides is quite numerous so we had lots of children , &quot; he says . &quot; Lots of gardens and trees . The further I advance in my life , the more I feel_like this was a period of paradise. &quot; For the past nine years , Zamachowski has resided in Warsaw , where he is currently starting his own nuclear_family , with his second wife , actress Aleksandra Justa , who is four months pregnant with their first child . Next fall , the actor begins shooting &quot; Torsje , &quot; with director Juliusz Machulski . But for now , Zamachowski ' s thoughts are_on Hollywood ; this is , in fact , his second visit here . &quot; The first one was a year ago -- I was just a tourist , &quot; he says . &quot; The first thing I did was to tour Universal Studios . I think this was an incredible adventure , &quot; he says , his eyes aglow . &quot; When I went_on the Earthquake ride , for those few minutes , I was a child again. &quot;</TEXT>
