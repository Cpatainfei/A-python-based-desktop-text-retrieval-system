   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 ROUND OF 16 ; GERMANY CLEAN AS A NON-WHISTLE ; SOCCER : VOELLER SCORES TWICE IN 3-2 VICTORY , BUT LACK OF A CALL HAS BELGIANS CRYING FOUL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The foul was obvious , the choice was clear , the world was waiting . Cameras had caught the German red-footed . Yet , referee Kurt Rothlisberger , a schoolteacher from Switzerland , did a curious thing with a whistle in the 70th minute of Saturday ' s World Cup game . He swallowed it . Germany did not require favors to defeat Belgium , 3-2 , before 60 # 246 at Soldier Field . Looking almost ordinary in group play , the Germans came_out swinging in the round of 16 , scoring three goals in the first 40 minutes . Victory advances Germany , reigning World Cup champion , to a July 10 quarterfinal match against the winner of Mexico versus Bulgaria . Saturday ' s exciting match , unfortunately , will not be_best remembered for the continued brilliance of forward Juergen Klinsmann , or for the soccer resurrection of Rudi Voeller , a 34-year-old striker who scored twice after being reunited with Klinsmann on_the_offensive front . Instead , Germany-Belgium will take its tainted place in the FIFA hall of shame because of a critical non-call in the game ' s defining moment . With his team trailing , 3-1 , in the 70th minute , Belgium ' s Georges Grun centered a pass in the German penalty area to forward Josip Weber , who split two defenders -- Thomas Helmer and Andreas Brehme -- and had a clear shot on goal . But before Weber could get_off a shot , Helmer took him down from behind , an offense that should have warranted a penalty kick under guidelines FIFA outlined before the tournament to protect offensive players . Helmer , who earlier in the game had received a yellow card , might have easily been red-carded for the &quot; professional foul , &quot; which would have left Germany a man short for the rest of the game . But Rothlisberger stood silent as ballistic Belgians stormed the referee in protest . How important was the non-call ? In the 90th minute , Belgium defender Philippe Albert cut the German lead to 3-2 when he drove a shot past goalkeeper Bodo Illgner . In the frantic final seconds , the Belgians came_close to tying the score . The Germans missed some chances too , but that was not a topic of discussion later . Paul Van Himst , the Belgium coach , could not hide his disgust . &quot; Millions of spectators saw what happened , &quot; he said of the non-call . &quot; I do believe such a decision is a scandal . I don ' t know what was going_on in the mind of referee , but if I was in_charge the referee would be sent home. &quot; The Belgium delegation , headed by Roger Vanden Stock , announced it would file a letter of protest to FIFA , although most suspect the letter soon will find the bottom of a wastebasket . &quot; FIFA has told us the rules were going_to change , &quot; Vanden Stock lamented . &quot; Tackles from behind should be punished . We are a victim of these new rules. &quot; FIFA took a hard line on hard tackles in the first round . For taking_down a South_Korean player in the goal area , Spain ' s Miguel Nadal received a red-card ejection and later was suspended for two games . The Germans , of course , saw the play differently . &quot; No , it should not have been a penalty kick , &quot; said Helmer , the perpetrator . &quot; It was not a foul . I touched him , to bother him a bit . But it was not an intentional foul . And that ' s how the referee saw it. &quot; Added Berti Vogts , the German coach : &quot; The referee did not whistle , therefore , it was not a penalty kick. &quot; The controversy did nothing to undermine the Germans ' dominance of the game . If not for some spectacular goalkeeping by Michel Preud ' homme , Germany might have scored six or seven goals . The same Germans who wilted in the Texas heat took_to a cool summer rain like the waters of Lourdes . After years of tinkering , the Germans apparently found the bookend to complement Klinsmann , who scored his fifth goal of the World Cup in the 11th minute . The answer was an old face , Voeller , who was recalled to duty after retiring from the national team two years ago . Voeller , who teamed with Klinsmann on the 1990 championship team , was nothing less than spectacular . He gave Germany a 1-0 lead in the sixth minute when he took a pass from Lothar Matthaeus and fired a shot past a diving Preud ' homme . Belgium tied the score two minutes later when Georges Grun recovered a headed ball in front of the German goal and lofted it over Illgner ' s head . Then , Klinsmann and Voeller took_over . Germany took the lead for good in the 11th minute , the result of some fancy footwork . Klinsmann got the ball rolling when he back-heeled a pass to Voeller , who dribbled toward goal and then punched the ball left to a streaking Klinsmann , who beat Preud ' homme to the right . Voeller , who returned to the national team just before the tournament , scored again , in the 40th minute , when he headed in Thomas Haessler ' s corner_kick .</TEXT>
