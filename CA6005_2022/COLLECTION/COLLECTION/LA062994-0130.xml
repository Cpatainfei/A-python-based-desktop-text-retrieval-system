   <HEADLINE> IN DEVELOPMENT : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; NEW CHIPS COULD USHER IN THE VIDEO CD ERA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Vinyl records long ago took a back seat to the compact_disc . Now it looks as if videotapes may go the same route . Texas Instruments has introduced a set of chips that could make video compact_discs as common as audio_CDs . The company ' s three-chip set produces VHS-quality video and CD-quality sound for the emerging Video CD standard developed by JVC , Matsushita , Philips and Sony . Video CD builds_on the popularity of audio_CDs and adds full-motion video and VCR-like features , such_as fast forward , freeze frame and reverse . The Texas Instruments chip set uses compression technology that delivers video images comparable_to videotape but with better sound quality . Full-length movies or music videos can be played from one or two five-inch CDs , giving video enthusiasts the same digital quality , ease of use and greater durability provided by audio_CDs . Because of the random-access nature of the digital technology , music video albums would seem a natural for the first Video CDs . While Video CD does not provide as sharp an image as laser disc , the CDs will cost considerably less . that ' s because Video CD can take_advantage of the major manufacturing cost reductions achieved for audio_CDs . Movie companies , including MGM , Paramount and Columbia , as well as major record labels have announced plans to offer Video CD products . Texas Instruments says production quantities of its chip set will be available sometime late this year . The first hardware , which could be in the stores by year ' s end , will be audio_CD players with Video CD as a premium feature . Early reports suggest that the players could sell for less than $ 500 . Conventional audio_CDs will be playable on Video CD . * Softening the Blow : Children think that games involving falling_down are fun . But for anyone over age 65 , falls are no laughing matter . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that a third of all people over 65 fall at least once a year , with the annual cost of medical_care for hip fractures ( the most common fall-related injury ) estimated at $ 7 billion . As a result , researchers at Pennsylvania State University are working_on flooring that would be softer_on older bones . The design involves two layers of urethane elastomer , a highly elastic material , separated by small columns of the same material . The floor can withstand someone walking or rolling a wheelchair on it . But when someone falls on it , the columns between layers buckle momentarily , cutting the impact by as much as 40 % . * Building Blood : One of the worst side_effects of intensive chemotherapy is the sometimes fatal drop_in blood platelets the treatment can cause . Since platelets are the blood_cells responsible_for clotting , low platelet counts can lead to excessive internal bleeding . This condition , known as thrombocytopenia , is currently treated through platelet transfusion or by lowering chemotherapy doses . But transfusion carries the risk of the immune_system building_up defenses against what it perceives to be foreign objects and rejecting the platelets . Lower chemotherapy doses might not be as effective . But researchers at ZymoGenetics , a Seattle-based subsidiary of the Danish firm Novo Nordisk , in collaboration with the University of Washington , have cloned a hormone called thrombopoietin , or TPO . TPO belongs_to a group of proteins known as cytokines , which stimulate the production of certain blood_cells . While the TPO clone is a long way from commercialization , researchers report that it has stimulated the production of platelet levels in laboratory mice by more_than 400 % . * Eye Control : For most of us , the mouse was a big step_forward when it came_to controlling our computers . But if you think voice recognition will mean a great leap forward , guess again . Three Boston College faculty_members think that maybe the eyes have it when it comes_to making computers simpler to use . Researchers attach a series of electrodes around the user ' s eyes , where muscle movements generate electrical signals . The electrodes measure eye movements ; the potential_difference measured between the electrodes indicates the vertical and horizontal position of the retina . Focusing_on the cursor causes it to move to wherever the eye moves . In one application , a person could sort through a large data bank by simply &quot; looking &quot; the cursor to the right entry . An auto in a simulated road race video_game would move when you moved your eyes . People with limited use of arms , hands or fingers could benefit . But forget word_processing for the moment : A single sentence requires moving the cursor around on an alphabet pad . It takes three minutes to write &quot; It is working. &quot; * Pressure-Cooking Toxic Chemicals : One of the techniques the U.S. military uses to render toxic materials and stockpiled chemical weapons harmless is to heat them in what amounts to a high-tech pressure_cooker . This method , called the super-critical water technique , heats the chemicals and water in a reactor at temperatures of 400 degrees to 500 degrees Celsius and at a pressure of more_than 5 # 000 pounds per square_inch . Trouble is , chlorine and sulfur , common ingredients in several chemical_warfare substances such_as mustard_gas , react strongly with the metal reactor walls and cause serious damage . Thomas Houser , a Western Michigan University chemist , thinks a glass lining is the answer . Only the purest forms of glass can be used , because materials such_as Pyrex react with super-critical water . The trick will be to balance the pressure inside and outside the glass container . While incineration is still the most common method to destroy toxic substances , including hazardous waste in landfills , super-critical water could clean_up what ' s left even after incineration . * Machines on a Chip : Silicon-based semiconductors have found their way into almost every kind of machine . But now machines are finding their way onto silicon_chips . The same etching process that is used to put transistors on a silicon wafer can be used to etch tiny diaphragms , beams and other structures measuring only a_few thousandths of an inch or smaller . While much of the work_on micro-machines is still being done_in the laboratory , one area has shown commercial potential : sensors . Boston-based Analog Devices , which recently received a $ 3.4-million grant under the federal Technology Reinvestment Project , has been providing micro-machined accelerometers for air_bag deployment . But the company sees future automotive uses in sensors for anti-skid braking , yaw control and active suspension , among other things . KATHLEEN WIEGNER</TEXT>
