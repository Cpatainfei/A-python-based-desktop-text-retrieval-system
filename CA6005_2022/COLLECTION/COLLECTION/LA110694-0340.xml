   <HEADLINE> LAX CONTROL OVER STATE HUMANE OFFICERS ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : ANIMAL CONTROL ' DEPUTIES ' MAY WEAR UNIFORMS , CARRY GUNS AND MAKE ARRESTS , BUT THEIR RANKS ARE VIRTUALLY UNREGULATED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Capt . Barbara Fabricant ordered that Steven Hazzard give_up his beloved guide_dog , Starsky , while she investigated allegations that he kicked the animal , the blind computer_programmer balked , but obliged out of deference to the law . Although Fabricant had neither interviewed Hazzard nor examined Starsky to determine if the charges were founded , she was , after all , not only a state humane officer , but &quot; director of criminal investigations. &quot; And Guide_Dogs for the Blind , the Bay Area group that trained Starsky , told Hazzard that Fabricant had threatened to haul in their executives on felony charges , too , if he did not cooperate . So Hazzard , of Westchester , spent the next five months unemployed and mostly homebound , without his &quot; eyes &quot; and his best_friend . What Hazzard and the guide_dog association did not know was that the . 357-magnum-toting , uniform-wearing &quot; Capt. &quot; Fabricant is a strange sort of cop , one of a little-known group of non-governmental peace_officers . They are authorized by the state of California to carry guns , conduct criminal investigations and make arrests throughout the state . They can wear uniforms and badges nearly identical to those of Highway Patrol officers . Yet despite the powers conferred on them under an obscure civil code , a Times investigation has found that humane officers such_as the 68-year-old Fabricant operate virtually unregulated and unsupervised . They are nominated for their positions by private animal welfare organizations -- which can be founded by a single person -- and in many cases are given badges and are authorized to carry guns with little or no training . They are_on no government payroll . They belong_to no police_department . They have no chief . * No government_agency supervises them , or even keeps track of who they are or how many are out there -- not even the California Department_of_Justice , which oversees the professional qualifications of other peace_officers throughout the state . &quot; It ' s scary , &quot; said Norman Boehm , executive_director of the state Justice_Department ' s Commission on Peace_Officer Standards and Training , in a recent interview . Like other state officials , he said he was unaware of the police powers and lack of oversight on such officers until asked about them . &quot; I don ' t know what they ' re doing . Who in the world is out there carrying guns ? . . . I have no idea where they get their authority . You need a job with a government organization in_order to act_as a peace officer. &quot; Actually , according to Civil Code 607f , you don ' t . Under the code , private animal-welfare groups submit names of humane officer candidates to the presiding judge of the county ' s Superior_Court for approval . The candidates pay a $ 5 fee and need only 12 hours of training in animal care and a course in state humane laws within a year of receiving the badge . ( Fabricant holds classes at her Canoga Park home. ) Los Angeles Superior_Court official Georgene Nagamine said : &quot; Our job is to just send the forms up north for processing. &quot; If training is not available within 100 miles , the law says humane officer candidates are exempt from even that requirement , as are people who became officers before 1977 . All it takes_to slap_on a gun belt and carry a weapon is an introductory firearms course available from community_colleges , a course that Boehm said &quot; amounts to nothing. &quot; The candidates ' fingerprints are sent to Sacramento for a cursory Justice_Department check for a criminal_record . After that , they are_on their own until they have to reapply three years later . The records of state humane officers ' identities are kept_in each county ' s principal courthouse or recorder ' s office . State officials say they have no idea how many there are , or who they are . &quot; I don ' t see any oversight , &quot; said Michael Van Winkle , spokesman for the Justice_Department ' s law_enforcement division . &quot; No one here is aware of any. &quot; Humane officers have been around for more_than 80 years , throwbacks to a time when cities and counties had nobody trained or available to investigate complaints of animal abuse , poisoning and theft . Local humane societies were authorized to provide deputies to fill the gap . Although many California counties and most large cities now have paid , professional animal control officers , the humane officers linger as &quot; one of those loose things from way back in history , &quot; said Darrell Stewart , a former state_highway patrolman and current spokesman for the Commission on Peace_Officer Standards and Training , which sets standards for all law_enforcement officers in the state . After a lobbying effort aided by protests from organizations for the blind over Hazzard ' s loss of Starsky , a private association of state humane officers persuaded the state Legislature this summer to enact stricter training requirements , effective next year . But some critics , and some animal rights groups , say much more needs to be done . &quot; You have a lot of these loose cannon people . . . all_of these Lone Rangers running all around the state , &quot; said the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ' new executive_director , Madeline Bernstein . &quot; We need to wipe_out these gun-toting people who are out there claiming to be officers . . . . Who the hell knows whether they ' ve gotten all_the credentials or not ? &quot; Everyone and their mother wants to be a humane officer , &quot; she added , &quot; so they can go_out and carry a gun and shoot people who are mean to animals. &quot; Fabricant says she agrees . &quot; I want all this exposed , &quot; she said Friday . &quot; Take_away the right to carry a gun , and you will eliminate 90 % of the phonies . And then only people who want to help animals will be humane officers. &quot; Humane officers are not required to go_through the rigorous background checks and psychiatric evaluations that conventional police_forces employ to weed out potential problem officers , Stewart said . &quot; You need those people to be absolutely stable , of_sound_mind , &quot; Stewart said . &quot; It ' s frightening if through loose regulations , inappropriate people are carrying firearms . It ' s bad enough in rural_areas , let alone urban ones. &quot; Indeed , court documents and interviews show that humane officers have been accused of overstepping their authority , ruining crime scenes and evidence and generally confusing and confounding other law_enforcement efforts . County records obtained by The Times show that Fabricant has used her status as head of an animal rights organization named the Humane Task_Force to create her own group of gun-toting deputies that include lawyers , doctors , contractors , actors and a retired watch repairman . The group , which Fabricant directs out of her home , has in the past year asked that 21 more people be made officers . Wayne and Barbara Chronister are suing one of Fabricant ' s former deputies for the return of cats seized in a raid on their Riverside County home last year . In another raid months earlier on the family ' s previous home_in Glassell Park , one of Fabricant ' s lieutenants , news media in tow , arrested Barbara Chronister ' s daughter and seized dozens of animals that the officer and Fabricant suspected were being abused . He &quot; put ( the daughter ) in the clink &quot; on suspicion of animal cruelty , Fabricant said . Police freed the woman that night , but misdemeanor charges are pending against her . Linda Adams , an attorney for the Chronisters , said the family has been terrorized by Fabricant ' s group and other animal rights activists . &quot; They want to have their own arm of the law . Some animal rights groups are utilizing these officers as their own personal posses , &quot; Adams said . She said Fabricant approached her several years ago , saying Adams ' legal expertise would make her a good addition to Fabricant ' s humane officer team . &quot; She tried to hire me , and she never met me before . She said if I wanted to carry a gun and badge and wear a uniform , I could , &quot; Adams said . Fabricant confirms she tried to recruit Adams . When humane officers who had worked with Fabricant appeared at a city Board of Animal Regulation Commission meeting several months ago , one was ejected for carrying an illegally concealed firearm , according to a city official who was present . * During last year ' s Malibu / Calabasas fire , as firefighters were frantically trying to evacuate residents from the area ahead of the onrushing flames , Fabricant asked a radio_station to broadcast appeals summoning equestrians with horse trailers to the fire line to help rescue panicked horses . &quot; Fire_departments kept saying , ' Who is doing this ? ' ( Other law_enforcement ) organizations kept saying they didn ' t know , &quot; said one official familiar_with the case . Fabricant responded that she never knew emergency officials were upset by her actions . &quot; We personally transported over 1 # 000 horses , not to mention cats , dogs , birds , you name it . If we had not been there , what would have happened to all those animals ? &quot; she asked . After the Jan . 17 earthquake , Fabricant , in full uniform , held a news_conference outside the city ' s West Valley Animal Shelter , urging viewers not to turn_over to city officers any of the hundreds of panicked pets running loose from their homes because &quot; most people do not trust Los Angeles animal shelters. &quot; City animal control officers , who have butted heads with Fabricant for years , were irate . They said they received complaints that Fabricant and her aides were collecting lost dogs and cats and keeping them . &quot; Here we are working our butts to the bone , understaffed , trying to unite people with their pets , &quot; said Lt . Richard Felosky , then a supervisor of the city Animal Regulation Department for the West Valley . &quot; It was an unbelievable situation. &quot; Fabricant said they only confiscated dogs and cats that looked as though they did not have owners . &quot; We picked_up 53 dogs from the various parks , &quot; she said . She said she took some of them home with her while she looked_for their owners . &quot; My house was a mess , &quot; Fabricant said . To be sure , there are many humane officers who go_through far more training than the law requires , such_as the officers of the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . Other humane groups , such_as those in Glendale and Marin County , voluntarily forbid their officers to carry guns unless they are headed for a dangerous neighborhood or may need the gun to put an injured animal out of its misery . &quot; If we need to , we can contact the police , &quot; said Glendale Humane Society director Michael Peatrowsky . But there are many others who secure nominations from small , little-known organizations , according to leaders of other animal welfare groups and officers of official agencies , like the city Animal Regulation Department . Some are well-meaning but radical animal rights activists , said Bernstein of the L.A. SPCA , which has its own crew of humane officers . The origins of Fabricant ' s group are unclear except that Fabricant started it and then had herself nominated to be a humane officer , according to court records . She concedes that she made_up her impressive title -- captain in_charge of criminal investigations -- as she began to accumulate deputies . A friend told Fabricant : &quot; ' You can ' t get much higher than captain , ' &quot; she recalls , &quot; so I ' m a captain. &quot; Some of her deputies , Fabricant concedes , joined up just so they could &quot; carry a gun , kick ass , make arrests and throw their weight around . People are wearing badges that have no damned business having badges and guns . &quot; It ' s a scary situation , &quot; she agreed . &quot; Let ' s say one of my officers shoots someone . I can be sued. &quot; During a recent day out_in the field , Fabricant acknowledged that she has had to &quot; decertify &quot; -- yank the badges of -- many of her officers because they became problems . County records show that one of them was an ex-husband , John Toth . Another one &quot; had ( police ) lights all_over his vehicle . He was pulling people over on the freeway , making arrests . . . . He was throwing his weight around . . . . I found_out how devious people are , and what lengths they ' ll go_to carry concealed weapons. &quot; Fabricant said she does not know how many humane officers she has working for her , or how many she has &quot; decertified. &quot; &quot; I hate to even think_about all_the dumb things I ' ve done here , &quot; she said . * In at least one case , county records indicate that a Los Angeles-area humane officer suspended by Fabricant helped create another animal rights group , nominated himself to be an officer and swiftly regained his badge . Fabricant , known as a leader of psychics and fortunetellers in the San Fernando Valley , is the widow of Sid ( The Squid ) Fabricant , identified by police as an organized crime figure when he died in the early 1980s . One of her sons is in the Hells Angels , she said , and the front_door of her home bears a decal : &quot; Support your local Hells Angels. &quot; She has equipped her 1977 Plymouth station_wagon with red and blue lights and official &quot; diamond E &quot; license_plates so that it resembles a police_car and is exempt from state fees . The courts sometimes send Fabricant convicted people to carry_out &quot; community service &quot; sentences , including one person Fabricant put_to_work trapping stray cats , according to city animal control officers . One day recently , Fabricant responded to a complaint phoned in by an animal rights activist . Because she was wearing black stretch leotards , a tie-dyed blouse and sandals , she had to show her badge to persuade an Asian family that spoke little English to let her into their house . Holding the badge to a peephole in the door , she said : &quot; I ' m a police_officer . Policia . &quot; She said she often does wear her uniform at lunchtime because &quot; if I go ( to restaurants ) in uniform , we get half price. &quot; And what of Hazzard and Starsky ? His troubles started when he was attacked on the street , Hazzard says , and several witnesses mistook the commotion for him kicking the dog . After Fabricant ordered the guide_dog association to confiscate Starsky , pending her investigation , its members examined him , declared that he had not been harmed and returned him to Hazzard . Fabricant called executives of the association , threatening them with arrest unless Starsky was re-confiscated , according to Hazzard ' s complaint in a lawsuit that he brought against the guide_dog group to get Starsky back . After five months and $ 25 # 000 in legal_fees , a retired judge appointed as mediator ruled there was no evidence that Hazzard had abused Starsky and ordered him returned . Many witnesses testified in his suit to regain Starsky that Hazzard never so_much as raised his voice to the dog , and would apologize if he accidentally walked into him . Hazzard ' s lawyer , Mark Brylski , complained in his brief that Fabricant ' s handling of the case &quot; reflects a lack of impartiality and professionalism and a willingness to use threats in_order to obtain her objective. &quot; California is not the only state with law_enforcement personnel like the state humane officers . Bernstein of the L.A. SPCA said she recently left the New York-based SPCA after the board of directors became embroiled in scandal over their carrying guns , which she opposed . New York , however , has a state agency that monitors credentialing of all sworn peace_officers , from humane officers to transit police to fish and game_wardens . &quot; There is a central registry and they are_on top of it all , &quot; Bernstein said . &quot; There is no such thing here . It certainly would get_rid_of a lot of the crap if there were. &quot;</TEXT>
