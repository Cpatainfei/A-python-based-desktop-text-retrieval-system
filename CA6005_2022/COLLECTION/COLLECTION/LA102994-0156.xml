   <HEADLINE> MEXICO FIGHTS PROP . 187 -- DELICATELY ; POLITICS : THE GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING TO AVOID THE APPEARANCE OF INTERFERING IN THE AFFAIRS OF A NEIGHBORING STATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Responding to nationalist outrage here over California ' s Proposition 187 , the Mexican government is sponsoring a delicate but concerted campaign to defeat the state ballot measure without violating one of this nation ' s most cherished policies -- non-interference in other nations ' internal affairs . In recent interviews , Mexico ' s point_man on the issue , Deputy Foreign Secretary Andres Rozental , has condemned the proposal to deny public_services to undocumented aliens in California and confirmed the Mexican government ' s formal efforts to fight it . But in defining Mexico ' s strategy to block an initiative that might affect hundreds of thousands of undocumented Mexicans in California , Rozental also described the tricky balancing act facing this nation , most affected by the proposal . &quot; Without interfering with the United States , the government of Mexico will work actively to prevent the passage of the anti-immigration initiative 187 , &quot; he declared recently , responding to a torrent of emotional challenges to the California ballot measure . It has been assailed in Mexico_City ' s media , has prompted thousands to take_to the streets in capital protests and is to be the subject of large demonstrations planned this weekend in Tijuana . Rozental stopped short of detailing what , if any , money his government has devoted to the cause but made clear that Mexico is supporting groups in the United States working to defeat Prop . 187 . &quot; Mexico will participate with organizations , associations and human_rights groups to bring_down this proposition , &quot; he said , adding : &quot; We have media campaign strategies to inform the entire California electorate of the contributions that Mexicans have made and continue to make to this state , so that no one will go_away with the idea that we are responsible_for the costs and problems of the state. &quot; At the core of Mexico ' s argument , Rozental and Mexico Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello agreed in separate interviews , is the belief here that Mexicans in California are being used as scapegoats for an economic_crisis in California , unrelated to undocumented migrants . And for a nation ill-prepared to offer those migrants a better life at_home , the greatest concern here is that Prop . 187 will touch_off what Tello this week called a &quot; xenophobic wave that will spread into other American_states along the frontier with Mexico. &quot; * Such a backlash , say some Mexican and Latin_American human_rights groups fueling the government ' s anti-Prop . 187 crusade , would be disastrous for nations such_as Mexico , where , they concede , the failure to deliver basic goods and human services ultimately is responsible_for illegal immigration . &quot; We realize that in the last decades , for various and bitter circumstances that we won ' t analyze here , millions of women and men from our countries have abandoned their homes and land to immigrate to other latitudes where , with no more_than strength to work , they could attain a life of dignity and a fair wage with which to give their children food , health , education and security , &quot; a Mexican-led human_rights consortium declared in a statement . But the group , whose members come from more_than a dozen Latin_American countries , stressed in a blitz of recent , paid advertisements throughout Mexico that any proposal to push migrants out of California is no solution . The group called Prop . 187 &quot; an aggression against the human and worker rights of a labor_force that historically has contributed to forging California. &quot; Group members demanded its withdrawal , asserting it &quot; undermines the image of a country that claims to be the world ' s leading superpower , a vanguard of liberty and a paradigm of justice. &quot; The group ' s alternative : &quot; The status of the so-called ' undocumenteds ' &quot; must be resolved not unilaterally by America or any of its states but by an international forum . The Mexican government -- which often has condemned the United States for interfering in other nations ' internal affairs -- has offered no alternatives to the problems identified by Prop . 187 , instead taking pains to err on the side of caution . But , amid a torrent of daily public condemnations of the California initiative in Mexico ' s nationalistic media , officials such_as Rozental and others have spoken out against Prop . 187 , saying it scapegoats a racial group . Mexico is not alone in its protest . Elsewhere in Central_America , the home region to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants in California , governments and members of the public have been expressing outrage . &quot; Gov . Pete Wilson is violating the human_rights of California ' s immigrants , &quot; said the president of El_Salvador , Armando Calderon Sol . &quot; This is an affront to the dignity of man , woman and child . The very country founded on principles of liberty and human_rights must repudiate this attitude. &quot; Like much of Central_America , El_Salvador ' s economy is kept afloat by money sent home by Salvadorans living_in the United States . Other public reaction to Prop . 187 in Mexico has been more conservative and measured . A recent editorial in the daily La Reforma stressed that the blame and the consequences behind the issue must be shared . &quot; We have lost generations and generations of Mexicans that valiantly have decided to abandon their homes and family to search and find a better solution for their lives , &quot; analyst Enrique Canales wrote . &quot; The proof is that the great majority do not want to come_back and prefer to establish themselves there. &quot; Fineman , The Times ' Mexico_City bureau chief , is now on assignment in Haiti . Times staff writer Tracy Wilkinson in San Salvador contributed to this report . * RELATED STORIES : A1</TEXT>
