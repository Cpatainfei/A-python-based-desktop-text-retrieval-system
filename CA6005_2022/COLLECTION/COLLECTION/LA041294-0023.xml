   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEWS ; A LOOK_AT PAST , FUTURE OF ' AIDS RESEARCH '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Human nature is perhaps HIV ' s best_friend , and something no scientist on Earth can combat . But human nature contains hope along with risk-taking , and the scientists hunting for a vaccine or cure for the virus may be feeling a new surge of optimism . At least , that ' s the strong impression left by the WGBH-produced &quot; AIDS Research : The Story So Far. &quot; Writer-producer Jon Palfreman squeezes much of the 13 years of frustrating research and scientific dead-ends into a_few minutes , but the summary -- along with an animated graphics sequence illustrating the molecular activity -- helps explain why a cure for AIDS remains so elusive . * Such past &quot; breakthroughs &quot; as the AZT vaccine proved easily surmountable by the AIDS virus ' startling ability to mutate . Rarely has television science so lucidly visualized how a virus is like any living thing , forever searching for means to survive . The virus ' skill at mutating makes_it able to penetrate cells and take_over the body ' s genetic structure . Current drugs can only slow this mutation process , but sooner or later , one or more of the thousands of various strains of the disease will defeat the drug ' s effect . And scientists such_as Ronald Desrosiers of the New England Primate Research_Center found little hope in conventional therapies . Palfreman ' s report dwells largely on the impact of Desrosiers ' very unconventional therapy , which emerged from studies with his primates deliberately infected with an injected HIV strain . The injected strain , consisting_of a weakened virus in which key genes were removed , is called an attenuated vaccine . Because the monkeys with this vaccine showed no signs of the primate form of AIDS in four years , Desrosiers argues that it may be time for human experiments . His case is further boosted by the small population of HIV-resistant patients , who appear as healthy today as the day they contracted the virus . The National Institutes of Health ' s Anthony Fauci , long accused by AIDS research activists of an overly slow and deliberate approach to finding a cure , does nothing here to change that image . Fauci wonders if biochemists and society at_large would be willing to try Desrosiers ' radical test and later voices the possibility that a cure for AIDS may never be found . * But activist Martin Delaney argues convincingly that such a test has a willing test group , including himself , and that no durable vaccine will be discovered without some risk . Besides , biomedical ethicist Arthur Caplan reminds , the pandemic levels of AIDS-related death in Africa and now in Asia call_for aggressive therapies . When the words , &quot; the most formidable microbe in history &quot; come_out of the mouth of narrator Will Lyman , they carry an extra ominous tone . If science history suggests anything , no &quot; Manhattan_Project &quot; for AIDS -- as ACT-UP and its allies demand -- will break what amounts to a plague in the Third_World . Instead , like the discovery of rubber , a breakthrough will probably happen when scientists least expect it . * &quot; AIDS Research : The Story So Far &quot; airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15 ; 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24 .
