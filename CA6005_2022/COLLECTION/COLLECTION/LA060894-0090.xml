   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; ARAFAT ' S HEALTH WOES RAISE FEARS ABOUT PEACE PROCESS ; MIDEAST : POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS LACK CHARISMA OF CHAIRMAN . BUT PLO SAYS CAUSE GOES BEYOND ONE LEADER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Yasser Arafat , the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman , professed himself to be in fine health last week when , recovering from a bout of flu , he discussed his fears for the future under Palestinian self-rule . But on closer scrutiny , in his interview with CBS television anchorman Dan Rather , Arafat ' s hand appeared to shake . It was merely a quiver , but it was enough to send chills through those most committed to making_peace work between Palestinians and Israel . &quot; It looked_like he was cracking , that the pressure has gotten_to him . He should have been in command in such an interview , but instead he was shaking , &quot; said Samir Masri , a businessman in Nablus who , like thousands of other Palestinians in the West_Bank , watched the interview rebroadcast on Israeli television -- and worried . &quot; The only reason for him to go_on American television like that was to show he wasn ' t hospitalized or dying , &quot; Masri said . &quot; But doesn ' t that mean he is close to it ? &quot; Last week ' s hospitalization of Arafat , attributed to a vertebrae problem followed by a cold and sore_throat , was dismissed by senior PLO officials as a minor flare-up that followed weeks of exhausting travel and long hours . But it was enough to raise new concerns about how long the 64-year-old chairman can travel the strenuous road toward peace . Assassination threats against Arafat -- made by Palestinian radicals since he signed the controversial peace agreement with Israel last fall -- have fueled a nagging question : What if he died ? Could the peace process , carried virtually alone on Arafat ' s back amid a storm of opposition in the Palestinian ranks , survive ? Is there a successor in the wings ? Farouk Kaddoumi -- Arafat ' s most prominent heir_apparent in the PLO hierarchy , and currently PLO political department chief -- has been a strong critic of the &quot; Gaza-Jericho first &quot; interim peace plan ; only a bare majority of the PLO Executive Committee has backed Arafat in implementing the plan . A PLO with Kaddoumi at the head might well lack the determination it will take_to make a success of interim peace in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip , skeptics say . And neither Kaddoumi nor the other PLO leader most often mentioned as a potential successor -- peace plan architect Mahmoud Abbas ( Abu Maazen ) -- has much in the way of a following in the occupied territories . Both men certainly lack the charisma and history that Arafat calls_on to muster unity among mutinous ranks when his peacemaking efforts run_into trouble . Thus , Israel -- and even the wealthy Gulf Arab states that have fruitlessly sought an alternative PLO leader to back since Arafat enraged them with his support for Iraq in the Gulf War -- have been forced in recent years to pray quietly for the health of the kaffiyeh-clad guerrilla they loathe . &quot; If Arafat dies today or tomorrow , it would be incredibly destructive to the peace process , absolutely paralyzing at a time when it should gather speed , &quot; said Barry Rubin , a political_scientist at Tel Aviv University and author of a history of the PLO . But PLO leaders close to Arafat insist that the peace process has gone beyond the health of a single leader . &quot; If Arafat died , the Fatah Central Committee would meet and it would select a new leader within 24 hours , &quot; said Mohammed Sobhieh , secretary_general of the Palestine National Council and PLO ambassador to the Arab League . &quot; We have made a collective decision for peace , a decision that goes beyond one man , starting with 1974 , when we voted to establish a Palestinian state on any territory vacated by Israel , ( and ) going_on in 1988 in Algiers , when the PNC adopted ( U.N. Resolutions ) 242 and 338 &quot; establishing the principle of land for peace , Sobhieh said . &quot; Now it is too late to turn back. &quot; Speculation and outright alarm about the possibility of his demise are nothing new for Arafat . Dodging bombs and bullets through years of turmoil in Jordan and civil_war in Lebanon , Arafat was left standing alone at the PLO helm after the assassination near his headquarters in Tunis , Tunisia , of the only two men besides Arafat ever considered serious candidates for political supremacy in the PLO : Khalil Wazir ( Abu Jihad ) and Salah Khalaf ( Abu Iyad ) . When three of his men were killed when his plane went_down in a sandstorm in Libya in 1992 , Arafat , huddled in blankets and pillows in the back of the plane , survived . He emerged in apparently excellent health after surgery to remove a blood_clot on his brain not long after the crash . The conventional wisdom is that the mercurial PLO chairman has survived wars , international isolation and countless threats to wash Arab streets in his blood but that finally , if he died , peace would not survive him . A new dynamic has entered the turbulent world of Palestinian politics since the day Arafat signed his historic peace deal with Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin in September . The new politics carry the seeds not only of more political pluralism within the PLO hierarchy -- an organization where the first and last decisions may one day not be made by Arafat alone -- but of a new era when peace might outlast the men who made_it . For the first time , Palestinians are looking_at the possibility later this year of electing a ruling council for the West_Bank and Gaza ; Arafat ' s Fatah organization will run like any other political_party for votes . Even PLO leaders like Kaddoumi who have opposed the peace plan have agreed to work to begin implementing it -- lending a momentum that may be difficult to stop as self-rule bears fruit . Most Palestinians say Arafat ' s successor would almost certainly be a PLO member from outside the occupied territories , most likely Kaddoumi , Abu Maazen or someone else from within the central committee of Arafat ' s Fatah organization , the largest component of the PLO . At the same time , there is a substantial minority that sees West_Bank Fatah leader Faisal Husseini emerging as leader if the succession occurs after the Palestinian Authority is up and running , particularly if it holds elections Oct . 15 as announced . Many of the PLO officials who say Kaddoumi would most likely succeed Arafat also say his ascension would not be fatal to the peace process . On the contrary , it might help hold the PLO ranks in and outside the territories together while a final peace solution is negotiated . Kaddoumi ' s preference , say PLO officials close to him , probably would be to leave the Palestinian Authority to handle issues in the territories while he focused_on international contacts and on negotiations for Palestinian statehood and freeing Arab East Jerusalem from Israeli control . Officially , the Israelis agree with senior PLO leaders who say the peace process has moved beyond a single man . &quot; We are dealing with not an individual but with the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people . The peace process , including the agreements signed_in Oslo , Washington and Cairo , has its own strength and own roots now , &quot; said an Israeli Foreign Ministry official . Another Israeli involved in the peace negotiations said the realization that Arafat will not live forever &quot; is a question that has occurred to us and has grown larger in recent days , but it is an issue that , from the outset , we worked into our negotiating assumptions. &quot; &quot; So , our best judgment was that a political struggle would follow , both in PLO Tunis and inside the territories , but it would probably -- I stress the probably -- not be bloody and would not bring total chaos , &quot; he said . So goes the optimism . Meantime , most talk_about Arafat ' s health , after the usual booming assertions that all is_well , turns_to worry . Riad Malki , a West_Bank leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , observed of Arafat : &quot; He looked unwell , worse than we have ever seen him . He certainly could use a rest . . . . I would n ' t like to say more_than that. &quot; Murphy reported from Cairo and Parks from Jerusalem .</TEXT>
