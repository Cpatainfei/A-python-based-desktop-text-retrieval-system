   <TEXT> With just a snapshot taken_in 1947 and a misspelled last_name , Meyer Denn did what seemed impossible -- he united an American woman with her two cousins in Czechoslovakia , both of whom had survived the Holocaust by hiding in cellars for five years . &quot; It was a stunning experience , &quot; said Marsha Friedman of Madison , Wis. , who in 1992 took her 25-year-old nephew to Bratislava to visit her cousins . &quot; Being there gave me a sense of what life was like then -- you see who you come from , what your own relatives had to endure , the conditions they lived under . And I felt it was important for my nephew to see who he is and where his roots are. &quot; Denn , a 32-year-old genealogical consultant who grew_up as one of 16 Jews in a Texas town of 20 # 000 , knows the importance of rediscovering the past . He has spent much of his life uncovering his own history , and helping others -- especially Jews -- find theirs . &quot; You ask someone my age where their grandparents come from , and many of them don ' t know , &quot; said Denn , who lives_in Santa Monica . &quot; It ' s very sad . When you don ' t know where you come from , you ' re losing a part of yourself. &quot; Denn , who earned a degree in history from the University of Texas and studied Jewish immigration , the destruction of Slovak Jewry and the Holocaust at Hebrew University in Jerusalem , said many Jewish people falsely believe that all records of their families were destroyed in World_War_II . But many family documents remain intact throughout Europe , he said -- good news for people like Robinn Magid , 34 , who had always assumed that the Holocaust had obliterated all evidence of her family . After hooking_up_with Denn three years ago , Magid learned to recognize and read birth and death certificates and other records using a Polish dictionary . She has since traced 11 generations of her family back to Lublin , Poland in the 1730s . &quot; Hitler may have deprived us of our family , but I will not allow Hitler to keep them off our family_tree , &quot; said Magid , who lives with her 3-year-old daughter , infant son and husband in Northern California . &quot; We can ' t bring them back , but I can make_sure they won ' t disappear from our family tree. &quot; Magid said her search has helped her answer questions she has always had about her family -- who they are , where they came from , how they got here . It has also helped her answer questions about herself . &quot; I ' ll always remember when I was in third grade , and my teacher asked_for a show of hands of who could trace their ancestors to the crossing of the Mayflower , &quot; she said . &quot; Now I see we each have our own Mayflower , we just have to find it. &quot; Denn said he is seeing a growing interest in finding the family &quot; Mayflower &quot; -- of uncovering and discovering family history . &quot; There is a grass-roots movement to connect with the past , to come_back home , &quot; said Denn , who also works with non-Jewish immigrants . &quot; There was the turbulence of the ' 60s and ' 70s , and now people want to connect with their essence . People are realizing that your past is part of what makes you what you are. &quot; Denn ' s preoccupation with genealogy began at age 9 , when he became fascinated with a photo of his great-great-grandparents -- dressed in the shtetle garb of Eastern Europe . &quot; They looked so different from me , I wanted to know how we were connected , &quot; he said . &quot; My dad used to tell me bedtime stories about our relatives . I always wanted to know more. &quot; After spending years pursuing genealogy as a hobby , Denn opened a consulting_firm , Meyer Denn &amp; Associates , last year . He charges $ 50 an hour but encourages the do-it-yourself approach to get the full impact of locating relatives . In his searches , Denn uses citizenship and naturalization papers , passports , ships ' passenger lists , census records and Yizkor Books ( published by Holocaust survivors in memory of those killed ) . The Mormon Temple ' s Family History Center-Los Angeles is also an invaluable source of genealogical information . And thanks to aerial photos taken by the Nazis of nearly every town and village in Eastern Europe , Denn has been able to locate family villages and sometimes even specific houses of ancestors . &quot; I provide documentation , rather than just a family_tree , &quot; said Denn , who speaks Yiddish , Hebrew and German . &quot; It ' s important for people to know more_than just names , and to be able to visit , if they choose , the places they come from. &quot; Denn ' s apartment is a testimony to his travels through history . Faded photos of family members from another age stare from the walls and shelves , and mementos of his trips throughout Eastern Europe -- including antique candlesticks , Jewish art objects and even stones from his great-grandparents ' back yard -- litter his tables and countertops . On one trip to Czechoslovakia , Denn met a man who was a guest at Denn ' s grandparents ' wedding in 1918 , and a villager who witnessed Denn ' s great-grandfather being taken_away by Slovak soldiers to Auschwitz . &quot; My grandfather always said there was nothing there -- he said his town was destroyed , &quot; said Denn , who has traced his family roots to the mid-1600s . &quot; What was destroyed was the Jewish community of the town , but the town is still there. &quot; Denn ' s bookcases are crammed with history books , stacks of documents and tattered volumes of archives . He excitedly breaks_out a slide_projector to showcase not the usual pictures of monuments and landscapes , but pages of records with the signatures and vital statistics of distant relatives . &quot; There is such a charge you get from seeing the actual signature of a great- , or even great-great-grandparent , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s nothing like it. &quot; Some of Denn ' s work involves finding not-so-distant relatives for recent immigrants like Boris Nesterovsky . Nesterovsky immigrated to this country from Russia four years ago with his wife and daughter . He knew he knew he had relatives in the United States but had no idea where they lived , or even the correct spelling of their last_names . &quot; It was my mom ' s dream to find them , &quot; said Nesterovsky , 66 , whose great aunt and uncle immigrated to America prior to the Russian_Revolution in 1917 . &quot; She always said , ' Maybe some day you will be able to emigrate , and you will find our relatives. ' Now that I have found them , it is not only for my benefit , but for my mother ' s . And now my daughter has relatives in America. &quot; Diane Medved , a convert to Judaism who found that her relatives actually did come_over on the Mayflower , said her exploration of her family ' s history gives her more_than just a connection to the past and a link to the present . For her , getting_in_touch with where she came from builds_upon her religious_beliefs . &quot; The Jewish perspective is that people are elevating technologically , but not spiritually , &quot; she said . &quot; We have a lot to learn from those who have come before. &quot; Inevitably , we will all be the ones who have &quot; gone before. &quot; Which is why it is important , Denn said , to begin documenting your life , and the life of your family , now -- through audio- or videotape -- before your history dies with those who know it . &quot; There is nothing more valuable than , 50 or 60 years from now , your kids watching you tell your story , &quot; Denn said . &quot; By giving them that , you ' re keeping people alive , and bringing your story to life. &quot;</TEXT>
