   <HEADLINE> IN BRIEF , DO-IT-YOURSELF LAWYERS CITE COST ; JUSTICE : GROWING NUMBERS OF AMERICANS REPRESENT THEMSELVES IN VARIETY OF CASES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At 8 a.m. , the do-it-yourself lawyers begin their unending procession through the cavernous offices of Hampden County ' s family and probate clerk . They crack oversized binders of handwritten court records , scratch their scalps , rub their eyes , and pose question after question to overworked clerks behind a 4-foot-high counter . &quot; ' Abuse and threats is not grounds for divorce , &quot; a clerk tells a woman staring at a legal form . Another clerk arrives to speak_to the woman in Spanish . &quot; A lot of people have absolutely no idea what to do , &quot; says Deborah Hawley , a clerk . &quot; A lot of people come_in here angry because they ' re already frustrated by what ' s going_on in court . They come_up here , and they ' ll yell and scream at us. &quot; The clerks , even if they know the law , are barred from giving legal advice . But , for better or worse , the hordes of uninitiated standing before them are among the growing legions of Americans forced to depend_on their own wits in legal matters . They represent themselves -- acting &quot; pro se &quot; in the rarefied Latin terminology of the courts -- in divorce cases , custody disputes , small claims court and even full-blown lawsuits . Some don ' t think they need a lawyer , some can ' t find one , and others even believe they are_better off without one . But they point overwhelmingly to one deciding factor : Cost . &quot; I ' m broke , &quot; said Dawn Monty , a 27-year-old mother of one , as she labored over six divorce and custody forms at the clerk ' s office . &quot; It ' s very expensive to get a lawyer for a divorce . My mother went_through two of them. &quot; The American Bar Assn . does not keep records on how many Americans act_on their own legal behalf . But all agree the numbers have risen dramatically in recent decades . An ABA study in the Phoenix area found that at least one of the parties was acting pro se in 24 % of 1980 divorce cases . Ten years later , that figure had soared to 88 % . Judges and lawyers attribute such increases to the streamlining of divorce law in some states and a proliferation of do-it-yourself legal kits , an explosion of custody_battles and requests for restraining orders , broader jurisdiction for some small claims courts , Reagan-era cuts_in government-funded legal counsel for poor people , and escalating lawyers ' fees . Some self-taught lawyers , although acknowledging legal costs as a motivation , contend they can do better work than real lawyers anyway . &quot; These guys forget . I ' m on top of everything , &quot; said Melvin Brown , a 63-year-old retired firefighter . Brown , who quit high_school after the ninth grade but later gained an equivalency diploma , is representing himself in a 15-year-old legal dispute over his union fees with the city of Chicopee , Mass . During that time , he has filed lawsuits all_the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and even argued verbally in state Supreme Court , doing research at a local law library and occasionally turning_to a lawyer friend for informal advice . Not content with previous mixed decisions , he is now suing the city for $ 1.5 million . Brown estimates that he would have paid about $ 100 # 000 if he had allowed lawyers to do his work . &quot; I could never have afforded what I ' ve been through . The average person can ' t afford it either , &quot; he said . Donna Burns , who has fought the government in court over her son ' s brain damage that she blames on mandatory childhood vaccinations , said a lawyer could not match her personal commitment . &quot; I ' m not looking_at this case as one case in 100 . This is my son -- my son , &quot; she said . But many reluctant pro se lawyers are clearly lost in the maze of petitions , pleadings , judgments , statutes , dockets , jurisdictions and courtrooms . &quot; When I have any project at_home that requires more_than a hammer , a nail and a screwdriver , I call a carpenter . Sometimes it ' s important to call a lawyer , &quot; said William Kelly , a small claims judge in Kentwood , Mich . David G . Sacks , a family judge in Springfield , is troubled by the train of poverty-stricken pro se lawyers who trudge through his courtroom . For them , it ' s no hobby , but the only alternative to lawyers with fees starting about $ 100 an hour . &quot; It ' s not a surprise that people who have trouble paying_for a mortgage , groceries , rent and heat are having trouble paying_for a lawyer , &quot; he said . &quot; My greatest concern is . . . people coming_in here who are unable to enforce their rights. &quot; The number of cases with pro se parties in Hampden probate and family court has swelled to 50 % , according to Thomas Moriarty Jr. , the register of probate . His office and some others around the state have set_up volunteer lawyer-for-a-day programs to offer free , informal legal advice . James Martin , a high-powered corporate attorney , spent one recent day at the Hampden Family Court offices advising pro se parents and spouses , including a woman seeking a restraining order against her ex-husband for an alleged attack on her fiance in the courthouse that very day . &quot; We ' ve been through a box of Kleenex in here -- half_a_dozen people bawling their eyes out , &quot; Martin said with a weary smile . But volunteer lawyers can help only a small percentage of those in need . In a recent report , an ABA panel proposed easier-to-understand legal forms , administrative divorces without judges in uncontested cases , special after-hour court sessions and courthouse day_care , and encouraging lawyers to provide limited advice for a fee without insisting on taking_over an entire case . The Arizona Supreme Court undertook a pilot_project last year in three cities where it placed courthouse computer booths that teach a person to fill_out divorce forms or eviction notices in either English or Spanish -- and then print out the completed forms . &quot; We know how well it ' s running because not one person has had to ask any of the court staff at the pilot sites for help , &quot; said Lynn Wiletsky , manager of the project .</TEXT>
