   <HEADLINE> CENTERPIECE : WE KNOW WHAT WE LIKE ; IN VENTURA , THOUSAND OAKS AND OXNARD , A GROWING USE OF PUBLIC ART BRINGS INTO FOCUS THE WAY EACH COMMUNITY SEES ITSELF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Anyone who has walked the full length of the Ventura Pier has bumped_into it : the giant copper tube running_up from the decking and twisting_around like a pretzel , shooting sprays of water sometimes 10 feet straight up into the air . It ' s not an industrial turbine , which it seems to evoke . Neither is it a length of exhaust_pipe from a grand old ship , even though it could have been pulled straight from the deck of a 50-year-old steamer . No , it ' s art . Conceptual art . Site-specific art . And whether you like it or not , it ' s public art . Taxpayers spent $ 80 # 000 on this piece , titled &quot; Wavespout , &quot; to cap_off a massive restoration of the pier . It was designed by San Francisco artist Ned Kahn to &quot; blue-sky &quot; specifications set by the city of Ventura : Simply create something that would engage passersby in the maritime environment . The water bursts are in sync with ocean waves below . The copper medium is of a maritime age that put Ventura on the map . The thing itself is an enticement to people to make use of the pier . &quot; Wavespout &quot; is the premier artwork in a young program to create public art in Ventura . Its daring defines the city ' s view of what constitutes public art . Ventura is but one of three cities in Ventura County to recently join a national trend toward fostering public art , which began in America ' s urban_centers in the 1970s with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts . Yet the city is singular in its approach . Thousand Oaks and Oxnard have programs in place , but their approaches to creating public art are different , from each other ' s as well as Ventura ' s . Art seems to do that . It divides opinion , brings into focus the way a community sees itself and calls into question why art is needed in the first place . In Ventura , Thousand Oaks and Oxnard , the artwork and the method of creating it reveal the distinctly different communities . Take Thousand Oaks . Anyone who has visited the Goebel Senior Center there has bumped_into the &quot; people , &quot; seated on the bench to the left of the front_door . An elderly man reads to a young_girl while a teen-age boy , baseball_cap in place , beams happily at them . The people don ' t move , however . They ' re cast in bronze , right down to wrinkles on_the_nose . The replication of life and relationship is so convincing as_to make this a 3-D Norman Rockwell , an intergenerational feel-good installation if there ever was one . But that ' s how Thousand Oaks wanted it . No provocations . No scratching of heads . Nobody thinking , we spent how much on this ? ( Taxpayers shelled_out $ 40 # 000 ) . Without the abstracted challenges of &quot; Wavespout , &quot; this piece , by Colorado artist Ann LaRose , seems to please everyone instantly . Then again , it might be forgotten much faster than &quot; Wavespout. &quot; It depends_on how you like your art . It wasn ' t easy for Thousand Oaks to get_it so &quot; right. &quot; The artist submissions for the piece in the first round were entirely abstract -- a phenomenon that sent an apoplectic City_Council back to chambers to start over by sending_out more conservative specifications . Even in the second round , which brought_in realistic and figurative sculptures , small-scale models by finalists were placed on display at the Thousand Oaks Public_Library for a popular vote . You offend the fewest people that way . Consider , finally , Oxnard . Anyone who has entered the Oxnard Town Center off Ventura Boulevard near the Ventura Freeway has bumped_into &quot; Flight of Fish. &quot; It ' s a field of flying fish made from metal cutouts and mounted on poles rising above a shallow water pool . The fish are coated with reflective &quot; scales &quot; and as they spin in the wind they change color wildly and take_on depth , as if moving_in a school . Also consider that Oxnard , which leads Ventura County hands-down in the quantity of public art , didn ' t charge taxpayers one cent for this highly successful installation by artist Sally Weber . Instead it got the developer of Oxnard Town Center to pay the estimated $ 30 # 000 cost . Oxnard ' s view is that government is stretched too thin already to be paying_for art , nice as it is . So it has a resolution in place urging private developers of projects exceeding 100 # 000 square_feet to contribute 1 % of costs to the placement of suitable public art . &quot; Suitable &quot; means that a committee appointed by the council must review and approve any art offered for placement -- a developer can ' t just go do anything because he or she is spending money on it . This came_into play recently along 3rd Street in La Colonia . There , a major industrial taxpayer , Terminal Freezers , sought to meet its art obligation by painting a wall outside its new warehouse with abstract depictions of freezer compressors . Sanely , the city said no . In response to the proddings of cultural arts_director Andrew Voth , Terminal commissioned Philadelphia artist Frank Hyder to conceive and install a symbolic and storytelling mural . The mural , mounted in six 4-by-8-foot painted tile panels , is a lush narrative view of the ethnicities and natural_resources of this historically agrarian community . It is easily among the finest and most compelling pieces of public art in Ventura County , but has hardly been seen . Whether it is entirely successful in its placement is another story ( see below ) . INDIVIDUAL TASTES The subject of public art has always confounded cultures . Some medieval Romans thought fountains got_in the way of city commerce ; others thought Christian frescoes were intrusive , even fascistic . New Yorkers still reel when the subject turns_to Richard Serra ' s &quot; Tilted Arc , &quot; a wall of rusted steel that , upon installation in the 1980s , bifurcated the courtyard behind a downtown Manhattan federal building and had to be removed in the face of protest . It seems the arc looked great from the 15th floor but otherwise blocked office workers from getting_to their favored lunch and coffee-break perches . Aesthetics has always taken a back seat to hunger . And only this fall , Culver City was in heated debate about whether its ordinance requiring developers to pay a percentage for public art could be altered to allow the architectural design of the building to satisfy public art requirements . In fancier projects , this would make the building itself into the artwork -- raising the question of whether architecture can actually be art . Things in Ventura County , by contrast , have been far less fractious , though some did challenge the propriety of paying art subsidy funds to architect Antoine Predock . ( Thousand Oaks allowed its 1 % -for-art on the new Civic Arts Plaza to go_to Predock for a building that features a pictograph wall. ) For the most part , city programs creating art have been cautious , slow to evolve and true_to local turf . If the city of Ventura is at times a maverick and bold in its approach , Thousand Oaks is unwaveringly pragmatic and Oxnard unapologetically opportunistic . The good news is that no matter the method , art -- along with spiritual matters , the thing that dignifies life -- is being created for a public burdened by the grind of modern life . Individual tastes are just that , but what follows is a city-by-city review of major pieces of public art under way and in place . Simi Valley declines to require developers or the city to produce public art . Camarillo , too , is without a program , but a planner there makes clear that the city is so highly regulated in its land-use and architectural stylings that officials prefer that any money earmarked for art go_into quality buildings and extensive landscaping . OXNARD Oxnard is jammed with art that developers have installed . that ' s good because it dresses_up and brings human scale to some large properties , both commercial and industrial . But that winsome quality is sometimes lost in the industrial-park setting , since people have no reason to visit unless they work there . That is a limiting factor inherent in privately funded public art . Not all_of the work is successful . Most baffling of all is a series of light-refracting columns titled &quot; Connections , &quot; by Robert Behrens , in Told Corp. ' s Channel Islands Business Center . These tall black poles along Channel Islands Boulevard lose what coherence and relevance they might have had from the competing nearby telephone_poles and recent construction of buildings around them . They simply stick_up from the ground , begging the question : What on earth are these things ? And some works by famous artists are , if you will , from their Grade B collections . Hal Pastorius ' geometric sculpture &quot; Cube_Root , &quot; situated within the Sares / Regis Business Center off Rice Avenue at Gonzales Road , plainly lacks the play of dimension and engagement of his other work , and fails to speak_to the building it fronts . Simply plopped in place , it can only be called &quot; plop art. &quot; Much of Oxnard ' s public art , however , is rich , vivid and engaging . Frank Hyder ' s mural outside Terminal Freezers Inc. on 3rd Street in La Colonia is truly first-rate : Painted and fired ceramic tile panels form a &quot; canvas &quot; that features startling fish , boats and human hands of varying hues . The colors are luminous , the strokes bold and raw and in places impressionistic . The indigenous narrative content is reverential without becoming Hallmark-card sentimental . Sadly , it ' s tough to take_stock of this beauty while doing 40 m.p.h. on busy 3rd Street , and the only people on foot in these parts are schoolchildren heading_home ( not one looked_up on a recent weekday. ) Sally Weber ' s holographic &quot; Flight of Fish &quot; at the Oxnard Town Center , 1000 Town Center Drive , is at first glance a shameless , decorative crowd pleaser . But its ability to manipulate space -- get the viewer to feel as if he is snorkeling -- is testimony to its transformative power . ( If a_few fish are missing , it ' s because they ' re becoming popular among nighttime vandals. ) Rafe Affleck ' s fountain sculpture at the entrance of Oxnard Financial Plaza at Vineyard Avenue and Oxnard Boulevard is a winner : Simple bold curls of stainless_steel continue their shape in flowing water , all on a large scale . Arthur Silverman ' s &quot; Sails , &quot; a brushed aluminum sculpture at Vineyard Plaza Shopping_Center at Vineyard Avenue and Oxnard Boulevard , might be considered nautical kitsch by some but is instead a smartly done thematic sailboat sculpture -- if you can see it through all_the cars in the parking_lot . A kinetic aluminum sculpture &quot; Flight , &quot; by Lin Emery at the Chevron building in Sares / Regis Business Center , is as bracing as it is engaging , offering one instance in which an industrial_park setting seems just right . Art City sculptor Paul Lindhard is busy with Oxnard commissions , striking among them &quot; Venus of Oxnard , &quot; a travertine marble sculpture at the McGrath Industrial Park near Gonzales Road and Rose Avenue . Recent commercial developments in Oxnard show a new realism and accessibility in the public art that gets placed . This owes in part to the developers but even more to the panel that chooses the work . The Rose shopping_center on Rose Avenue near the Ventura Freeway is a case_in_point . Originally , the developer wanted to install a series of 30-foot-tall steel cutouts along the main entrance corridor . It was plain to Oxnard officials that such an approach was conceived as a way to get the most bang for the art buck ; cutouts are easy to do , especially if you have the steel in a storage yard . Efficiencies are fine , but there seemed no particular point_of_reference in the work , no level of engagement that was of the place . So Andrew Voth and others were dispatched to prod . The result is probably the most popular and most-seen artwork in Oxnard : Mario Nardini ' s &quot; Ocean Serendipity , &quot; a group of bronze leaping dolphins at the center ' s entrance , coupled with three life-size human sculptures by Gary Alsum near store entrances . These human sculptures -- a boy on stilts , children leapfrogging one another and children in a running race -- are modern culture ' s most common images , yet never fail to attract a disbelieving and affectionate crowd . The one shopping_center that is an unqualified artistic flop is the new Oxnard Factory Outlet Center , at the Ventura Freeway between Rose and Rice avenues . Oxnard had competed with Camarillo for the stores , and whichever city could accommodate the developers fastest landed the big fish , as it were . Oxnard won , and in its zeal for victory made its art requirements so relaxed as_to be virtually waived -- that is , unless you consider a faux water_tower and faux windmill to be somehow related to art . Aesthetics not only bow to hunger but to the economy . Still , art seeks a broadened base here . An ordinance is being drafted for the just-elected City_Council to consider in the new year . It would require that public building projects -- not just private developers -- budget 1 % of their expenditures for public art . THOUSAND OAKS that ' s exactly what Thousand Oaks does -- require 1 % of public project expenditures be set_aside for art . Private sector executives in this master-planned city made_it clear at a mayor ' s business round-table earlier this year they wanted no resolutions or ordinances that required private developers to commission and site public art . This stems in part from a previous legal challenge here to any such requirement and also a difficult economy in a highly regulated city . Some of the city ' s noted businesses and institutions -- GTE , Exxon and Cal Lutheran University -- feature prominent displays of art and do so without prompting by the city . But public art in this town is really that which is created by the city for city buildings . It is slow going . The first piece commissioned under the 1 % rule -- Ann LaRose ' s lifelike bronze figures in front of the Goebel Senior Center_on Janss Road near the Moorpark Freeway -- took two years in the selection , commissioning and placement . Carol Williams , who coordinates the art-in-public places projects for Thousand Oaks , says : &quot; It was universally felt that we needed a first piece that everybody could learn to love . We never hear anything negative about it . Because this one is so successful , we may branch_out more . And we won ' t have that many_more chances , because we ' re not going_to build so many_more buildings. &quot; And the projects that will come_up -- and with them the artwork that dignifies them -- will be ever smaller . Next on the docket is a $ 10 # 000 commission for the city ' s new maintenance facility off Rancho Conejo . LaRose ' s bronze people on the bench are worth seeing as part of an American art_movement in the last 15 years that seeks to engage at a neo-realistic , theatrical level . The pieces play_on perception ( the figures are hauntingly real ) and a sense of dramatic encounter ( although still , the figures relate to one another ) . Their trick is that they are utterly familiar yet alien . It is a pleasing art , certainly , but slim on challenge ; its Norman Rockwellism confirms the way we hope for things to be , rather than jiggle our belief and sensibility . More diverting is a nearby mural , in the public_library ' s children ' s section . While not part of the city ' s program , this 1987 creation by Bradley W . Schenk certainly is a dominant piece of public art for Thousand Oaks . Large ( nearly 14 feet high at one point and over 20 feet long ) and powerful ( its images are beautifully wrought and powerfully arranged in juxtaposition ) , it is narrative and delightfully propagandist in that it promotes reading . Miriam from I . B . Singer ' s &quot; The Golem &quot; sits near Water_Rat , Toad , Mole and Badger from Kenneth Grahame ' s &quot; The Wind in the Willows &quot; -- and they join a surreal cast of perhaps a dozen more . It ' s an adult fantasia as well as a kid ' s -- a terrifically engaging piece . What the Thousand Oaks sculpture and mural do best of all , however , is bear_up , with fearful symmetry , to coordinator Williams ' explanation of why art is necessary in the first place : &quot; It states who we are and where we ' re coming from. &quot; VENTURA No sooner did Ventura get Ned Kahn ' s &quot; Wavespout &quot; installed at the end of its refurbished pier than it went_off commissioning yet another noted artist to again engage people about sense of place . This time the city , which charges itself a hefty 2 % on public projects and requires nothing of private developers , is focusing_on oceanfront / downtown redevelopment . An open plaza at the base of California street between the Holiday Inn and a city parking garage is being torn_up and redesigned . Los Angeles sculptor Mark Lere won the $ 15 # 000-plus job of consulting with the project architect and designing a suitable artwork for placement at the base of the plaza overlooking the sea . But Lere found that mandate inappropriate , deciding that sight lines to the sea needed to be unimpeded and fearing a &quot; plop art &quot; result . Ventura ' s reflex to keep all possibilities open gave Lere room to move . The result : He is designing back-lit steel panels that will be built into the walkways of the plaza and feature word blocks within giant symbols of the senses -- an ear , eye , nose . The idea , he says , is to involve people with written and visual messages to have them think_of the sea and the city through the senses that are enlivened by that specific beachside site . &quot; Public art is not designing a necklace for a done project , &quot; he says . &quot; It has to be connected . In this case , you ' ll smell the ocean and see City_Hall , but in doing so it must be fun . You ' ve gotta have a catch. &quot; Sonia Tower , Ventura ' s cultural arts_director , is even more plain on the point . She cites the sameness of America ' s cities that , in a great wave of compulsion in the 1970s and early 1980s , purchased Alexander Calder mobiles and Henry Moore sculptures for their public art . &quot; that ' s not us , &quot; she says with a broad smile . &quot; We seek something unique , something that provides an interpretation of the actual space and place you ' re in . ' Wavespout ' does that , though some have complained . Mark ( Lere ) will do that on California Street . Real art is thought-provoking. &quot; While the California Street plaza takes_shape , consider the one piece of public art in Ventura that predates all city efforts at nurturing culture -- and the one that , ironically , may meet the goals of public art as well or better than anything yet displayed in these parts : the wraparound mural at the U.S. Post_Office on Santa Clara Street . A classic of the Works Progress Administration style , this soft-hued depiction of rural agrarian , coastal living is at once naif in its two-dimensional , primitive execution and profoundly complete in its emotional range . Few works of public art can be so accessible and resonant at_the_same_time , so warmly evocative yet thought-provoking . It seems certain from the range of it that the artist , Gordon Grant , had sufficiently free reign in 1936 to tell his story without having to bow to panel or commission . Of course , those public art days are pretty much over , and we are in a new age of confirming belief or challenging perception . It all depends_upon where you are .</TEXT>
