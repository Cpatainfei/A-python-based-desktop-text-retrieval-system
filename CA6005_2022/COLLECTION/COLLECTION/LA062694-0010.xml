   <HEADLINE> COMING OF AGE ; TENNESSEE WILLIAMS : EVERYONE ELSE IS AN AUDIENCE , BY RONALD HAYMAN ( YALE_UNIVERSITY PRESS : $ 27.50 ; 268 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like Charles Chaplin and Orson Welles , Tennessee Williams is one of those supremely troublesome artists the cultural watchdogs of this country have never quite forgiven themselves for letting_in the front gates . Wildly hailed for their early works , the silent clown and the sound-era writer-director went_on to be damned by both the popular press and the academy for subsequent efforts deemed either &quot; too serious &quot; ( Chaplin ) or &quot; not serious enough &quot; ( Welles ) . With Williams , however , the thumbs-down signal came_in a much more cryptic fashion . In the wake of his twin Broadway triumphs , &quot; The Glass Menagerie &quot; and &quot; A Streetcar Named Desire , &quot; Time magazine declared Williams guilty of creating works that were &quot; basically negative &quot; and &quot; sterile. &quot; Why were these seminal contributions to the American theater , whose vivid language , complex characters and rich emotional texture had captured the world ' s attention suddenly being dismissed so offhandedly ? Because Time knew that Tennessee Williams was gay . In the late 1940s , homosexuality was deemed unfit for open discussion in a &quot; family &quot; publication like Henry Luce ' s , so the ( aforementioned ) code language was used to get the point across instead . But by the 1960s ( then ) New York Times drama_critic Stanley Kaufman had mustered_up the effort to be somewhat less cryptic when he revealed in a Sunday column that &quot; three of the most successful playwrights of the last 20 years are ( reputed ) homosexuals &quot; whose works offered &quot; a badly distorted picture of American women , marriage , and society in general. &quot; There was no doubt that Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee were two of the names on Kaufman ' s hit list , but the identity of the third man was somewhat obscure : You could count_on being the toast of every cocktail_party in town back then if you knew it was William Inge . Ordinarily it would be the height of absurdity to launch a polemical attack against a foe who can ' t be identified by name . Kaufman , however , wriggled off this hook by declaring that &quot; in society the homosexual ' s life must be discreetly concealed &quot; : &quot; Society &quot; supplied the excuse for not naming names . It was this social pressure , the critic insisted , that forced gay playwrights to create &quot; two-sex versions of the one sex experiences &quot; they &quot; really &quot; knew -- thus leading to &quot; distortions &quot; of heterosexuality . Claiming he wasn ' t making a case of sexual apartheid , Kaufman declared this sad situation was &quot; our &quot; fault ( all New York Times readers apparently being heterosexual ) and that homosexual playwrights should be &quot; allowed &quot; to write freely . But the truth of the_matter was Tennessee Williams had never made any effort to &quot; discreetly conceal &quot; his sexuality : he had been writing freely about such matters long before Kaufman gave him permission to do so . The primary subject of Williams ' writings ( both dramatic and fictional ) was the social outcast -- people whose lives were so marginal their presence barely registered . Going beyond the limits of realism , Williams discovered in the voices of these outcasts a means of creating a new sort of theatrical poetry . Far more inspired by women than men in his writings , Williams dealt with homosexuality for the most part in passing . Still , short_stories like &quot; One Arm &quot; and &quot; Desire and the Black Masseur &quot; and such one-act plays as &quot; Auto-Da-Fe , &quot; &quot; Something Unspoken &quot; and &quot; Suddenly Last Summer &quot; find him illuminating different aspects of gay life . Significantly one of Williams most important full-length works , &quot; Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , &quot; deals explicitly with an All-American football hero who would rather share his bed with another All-American football hero than his far from unattractive wife . You will look long and hard to find any mention of this simple fact in any of the initial reviews of &quot; Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , &quot; which invariably insisted that its hero ' s motives for spurning his wife were &quot; vague &quot; and &quot; mysterious. &quot; But then what could you expect from a critical context that refused to recognize that Albee ' s &quot; The Zoo Story &quot; was about a homosexual pick-up , insisted on seeing the thoroughly heterosexual &quot; Who ' s Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? &quot; as a transvestite tragicomedy , and praised Inge as the poet_laureate of middle-class heterosexuality with his &quot; Come Back Little Sheba &quot; and &quot; Bus_Stop , &quot; only to scream &quot; degenerate &quot; when he turned_to homosexual themes in &quot; Natural Affection &quot; and &quot; Where ' s Daddy ? &quot; Of course that was back in the ( allegedly ) freewheeling 1960s . Today with Tony Kushner ' s self-proclaimed &quot; gay fantasia &quot; &quot; Angels in America &quot; winning the Pulitzer prize , the atmosphere would seem to be ripe for a proper reassessment of Williams ' work . His plays , in near-constant revival , are more popular than ever . Moreover , a whole generation of new writers -- Kushner in particular -- bears_witness to his incalculable influence on the theater . So it is something of a shock to come_across a book like Ronald Hayman ' s &quot; Tennessee Williams : Everyone Else is an Audience. &quot; Claiming to be a study of the relationship between Williams ' life and art , this 268-page volume is little more_than a rehash of every canard that has been volleyed at the playwright since Time fired the first shot across its bow . &quot; More_than 20 years of drug and alcohol_addiction , coupled with devastating openness about his promiscuous homosexuality , had all but destroyed one of America ' s greatest playwrights , &quot; screams the dust_jacket . Paying only the mildest lip_service to Williams ' talent , Hayman strikes sob-sister-like poses of disingenuous concern for the substance_abuse , hypochondria , and emotional problems that plagued the playwright ' s later years . Raising a sternly disapproving eyebrow at Williams sexual life , Hayman makes not the slightest effort to comprehend it , going so far as_to state &quot; in his dealings with men ( Williams ) often enjoyed talking as if he -- and they -- were women , &quot; utilizing such terms as &quot; My Dear Daughter &quot; and &quot; My Sainted Mother. &quot; In a year that has seen such insightful studies of gay artists as Edmund White ' s &quot; Genet &quot; and Brad Gooch ' s Frank O ' Hara biography , &quot; City Poet , &quot; there ' s no excuse for Hayman ' s inability to navigate the simplest forms of camp slang . But you can ' t expect much from a writer who toes the ' 60s-era line on the alleged transvestite substitutions of gay playwrights . That Williams was able to identify with both sexes is not merely a measure of his talent , but a key to why the plays continue to fascinate audiences regardless of sexual orientation . You don ' t have to have a doctorate in English to recognize the fact that Williams used persons and incidents in his own life as models . But it takes more_than a little insight to explain how Williams transformed raw reality into the stuff of fiction . Hayman doesn ' t even try . One can only wonder at this biographer ' s motives when in another passage he quotes Gore Vidal ' s approving words about Williams ' dedicated writing habits only to turn_around and remark that : ( Williams ) spent so many strenuous hours at his typewriter that he gave the impression of being self-disciplined , but the need to write was so urgent that it was more like self-indulgence. &quot; These are dangerous words coming from Hayman who , in an exceedingly short space of time , has put biographies of Sade , Nietzsche , Kafka , Brecht , Sartre and Proust under his belt . Williams ' life may have been a mess -- particularly toward its end -- but the same can ' t be said of his art . &quot; A Streetcar Named Desire , &quot; &quot; Summer and Smoke , &quot; &quot; Cat on a Hot Tin Roof &quot; and &quot; Sweet Bird of Youth &quot; are in near-constant revival all_over the world . A few years ago Vanessa Redgrave brought &quot; Orpheus Descending , &quot; one of Williams ' most eccentric plays , to unexpectedly vivid life . And , if reviews are to be believed , a Chicago theatrical company has revealed &quot; The Night of the Iguana , &quot; a work frequently cited as proof of Williams ' late period decline , to be thoroughly first-rate . Maybe there ' s hope for such problematic works as &quot; Camino Real , &quot; &quot; Out Cry &quot; and &quot; The Red_Devil Battery Sign &quot; provided the right actors and directors can be found . There ' s also an opening for a new Williams biographer .</TEXT>
