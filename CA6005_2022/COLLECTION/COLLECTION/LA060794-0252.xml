   <HEADLINE> MEDICAL INSURANCE FOR PETS CAN BE A LIFESAVER ; COVERAGE : AN ANAHEIM PROVIDER IS NATION ' S LARGEST INSURER OF ANIMALS AND HAS ISSUED MORE THAN A HALF-MILLION POLICIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Travis Coates had been able to obtain health_insurance for his pet , the boy may never have had to pull the trigger on Old Yeller . For $ 10 a month , the lovable hound of Fred Gipson ' s bittersweet tale would have been vaccinated and spared both rabies and his master ' s rifle . He may , however , have howled over a provision for 50 % off the cost of neutering . Of course , pet health_insurance did not exist in the book ' s fictional past . And in the real-life present , it is uncommon ; only one major multi-state carrier provides nationwide coverage , though smaller plans are springing_up . The nation ' s largest pet health insurer , Veterinary Pet Insurance in Anaheim , has issued more_than 500 # 000 policies in 39 states since it was founded 14 years ago . Premiums average $ 75 a year . &quot; We cover accidents or illnesses . In that sense , it ' s pretty much the same as regular ( human ) health_insurance , &quot; Vice_President Richard Stephens said . &quot; Elective surgeries , spays , neuters and routine care aren ' t covered. &quot; Dr. Scott Matheson , medical director for the Family Veterinary Hospital ' s All Pet Complex in Taylorsville , Utah , said , &quot; We find that the vast majority of pet owners don ' t really take proper care of their pets . A lot of times , the option that people choose is euthanasia . &quot; that ' s frustrating when perhaps 80 % of all euthanasias are unnecessary . We would rather be able to treat these animals and get them back to their families. &quot; In a country that spent nearly $ 7 billion on veterinary care_for dogs and cats in 1991 , pet health_insurance might seem to be a logical growth_industry . &quot; Basically , we think it ' s a great idea , &quot; said Katherine Brant , spokeswoman for the Humane Society of Utah . &quot; Many people deeply devoted to their companion animals will quite often put their companion ' s health_care needs ahead of their own. &quot; Last year , Family Veterinary Hospital launched a three-tiered dog and cat health plan . So far , more_than 200 pet owners have signed_up , and Matheson expects enrollment to reach 400 to 500 by year ' s end . Here ' s how it works : A $ 10-a-month plan offers vaccinations , other routine treatments and savings on spays and neuters . For $ 7.50 more , the plan extends discounts to medical , surgical , prescription and laboratory services . A $ 25-month payment covers the full cost of medical , surgical and lab work_up to $ 500 , and half the cost above that . Matheson said the prepaid options are more akin to human health_maintenance_organizations ( HMOs ) than to regular third-party insurance plans , dozens of which have failed in the pet-care market in recent decades . The latest to go_under was the Fireman ' s Fund Insurance Co. ' s Medipet program , which quit writing new policies April 4 . John Kozero , spokesman for the Novato , Calif.-based firm , said fewer than 7 # 000 pet owners signed_up during a three-year trial run . &quot; An awful lot of people showed interest , but after they received the brochures , very few sent_in checks , &quot; he said . There would appear to be plenty of room for small-scale , prevention-oriented pet health plans . Indeed , pet insurance has become a hot topic for the American Veterinary Medical Assn. , which recently appointed an executive panel to explore the issue . &quot; Everybody seems to be very interested in this , &quot; said spokesman Mike Walters , reached at the association ' s offices in Schaumburg , Ill . While not endorsing any insurance scheme , Walters argued that dogs and cats are better risks than people . &quot; If you consider that a lot of health_problems may be the result of voluntary or discretionary but unsafe activities -- drinking , smoking , or riding motorcycles without helmets -- animals don ' t engage in those activities , &quot; he said . In 1991 , the latest year for which the American Veterinary Medical Assn . has statistics , Americans owned 52.5 million dogs and 57 million cats . Nearly $ 4.6 billion was spent on canine veterinary care , while cat owners paid more_than $ 2.3 billion . Bills for veterinary care , while nowhere near as high as medical_bills for humans , can still be budget-breakers . &quot; A real common example is a dog or cat that gets hit by a car . If it has a single broken bone , it would not be uncommon to have surgery , and that ' s $ 800 to $ 1 # 000 , &quot; Matheson said . The Rev . Bradley Wirth considers the coverage he bought for Oliver Wendell Wirth -- a 15-year-old &quot; terrier-poodle-cocker and , we ' ve always said , Presbyterian &quot; -- to have been almost providential . The All Saints Episcopal Church priest , concerned by Oliver ' s difficulty navigating steps , took the dog in_for X-rays at All Pet . Two large bladder_stones were discovered , requiring surgery last January . Instead of the $ 930 the operation cost , Wirth paid $ 176 to return Oliver to health . &quot; In my role as a priest , I have seen people agonize over medical procedures for their pets . It was an absolute godsend for us , and I think it would be for other folks. &quot;</TEXT>
