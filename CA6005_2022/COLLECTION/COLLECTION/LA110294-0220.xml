   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; DEMOCRATS EYE RIPS IN GOP FABRIC AS OWN CLOTH SPLITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the tumultuous midterm election campaigns careen toward a close , Democrats are hoping that newly emerging fault_lines in the Republican coalition will break the GOP momentum and save them from catastrophic losses in Congress . But the Democrats ' own divisions may still prove to be the more powerful force in determining their fate . On the Republican side , divisions over abortion , immigration and the needs of cities have spurred a recent series of high-profile defections , including endorsements of Democrats by the Republican mayors of New York and Los Angeles , and opposition to the GOP-backed Proposition 187 in California by national conservative leaders Jack Kemp and William J . Bennett . Yet while Democrats have chortled over these public expressions of GOP disagreement , less dramatic -- but more endemic -- splits within Democratic ranks are casting a longer shadow . Once again , many Democrats are finding it almost impossible to craft a message that both appeals_to moderate swing voters and maintains enthusiasm among their traditional base , especially minorities . From Georgia Gov . Zell Miller to Michigan Senate hopeful Bob Carr , many Democrats have spent most of this year attempting to blunt Republican advantages among white swing voters by emphasizing tough stands on crime and welfare reform and calling_for a restoration of family values . But they are finding that agenda doing little to spur enthusiasm among minority voters they need to turn_out in large_numbers . To compound the problem , most Democrats in contested races still find themselves running poorly among white voters as well . &quot; It is fair to say that on the one hand we have not expanded our base and on the other that our base is fraying , &quot; acknowledged Democratic pollster Mark Mellman . With the tide already running toward the GOP , many of these Democrats find themselves caught between the need to stimulate that traditional base with liberal appeals and the fear that those same arguments will alienate moderate voters . &quot; It is a universal problem for Democrats , &quot; said Merle Black , a political_scientist at Emory University in Atlanta . The Democratic splits are longstanding , unlike the Republican divisions that emerged suddenly from a party that displayed extraordinary unity in opposing Clinton over the last two years . Within days , New York Mayor Rudolph W . Giuliani endorsed Democratic Gov . Mario M . Cuomo ; Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan endorsed Democratic Sen . Dianne Feinstein ; former First_Lady Nancy Reagan joined a parade of Republicans who have criticized Virginia GOP Senate candidate Oliver L . North ; Helen Milliken , the wife of a former Republican governor , appeared in an ad for Michigan Democratic gubernatorial nominee Howard Wolpe ; and Teresa Heinz , the widow of former Republican Sen . John Heinz , denounced Rep . Rick Santorum , the party ' s nominee for the seat her husband once held . Other prominent Republicans recently have crossed party_lines to endorse Democrats in Iowa and Minnesota . On Tuesday , Ross Perot , an independent with many Republican followers , publicly endorsed Democratic Texas Gov . Ann Richards . Personality conflicts explain some of these heresies . Giuliani , for instance , loathes Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato ( R-N.Y. ) , the patron of Cuomo opponent George Pataki . But the splits also highlight ideological divisions that are likely to become increasingly visible as the GOP presidential race commences next year . The endorsements of Democrats by Riordan and Giuliani suggest that the GOP ' s modest urban revival may produce conflicts with its suburban-oriented contemporary agenda . Kemp ' s and Bennett ' s opposition to Proposition 187 , the California ballot measure that would deny some public_services to illegal immigrants , anticipates battles over immigration and welfare reform at the national level . And Milliken ' s endorsement of Wolpe -- tied to his support of abortion rights -- foreshadows a potentially bitter Republican battle over the issue in 1996 . The effect of these endorsements on this year ' s campaign , though , is uneven . While Giuliani ' s support has clearly helped Cuomo , North ' s core supporters appear impervious to criticism from other Republicans , and Milliken ' s backing has not revived Wolpe ' s lagging fortunes . While Republicans are facing these episodic eruptions of dissent , Democrats are confronting more systemic divisions in their coalition . Over the last few years , several Democrats who have moved sharply toward the center -- such_as former governors James J . Florio in New Jersey and James Blanchard in Michigan -- have been defeated , partly because their messages failed to generate sufficient turnout and support among blacks . In Georgia , many Democrats worry that Gov . Miller -- who has emphasized such issues as welfare reform and juvenile crime -- could fall victim to the same dynamic this year . Last week a group of Georgia blacks_led by a Democratic state representative criticized Miller for pushing &quot; punitive &quot; welfare measures and &quot; a very mean-spirited crime package , &quot; and endorsed his conservative Republican opponent , Guy Millner . With such examples in mind , some Democrats who spent much of the year reaching_out to moderates , especially whites , now are abruptly shifting their emphasis toward motivating dispirited liberal , minority and labor voters in the campaign ' s final days . Toward that end , many Democrats are returning to populist economic themes . At the national level , Democrats are running ads resurrecting the traditional charge that Republicans will cut Social_Security . After talking_about values and crime for much of the campaign , Democrats like Michigan Senate hopeful Carr and Tennessee Sen . Jim Sasser are now accusing their opponents of favoring the rich and contemplating cuts_in Medicare . &quot; It is old-fashioned Democratic class_warfare , &quot; said GOP pollster Whit Ayres , who is working for Bill Frist , the millionaire Republican surgeon opposing Sasser . In other states , Democrats belatedly have turned_to themes intended to activate minority voters . Texas Gov . Richards late last week unveiled radio advertisements accusing George W . Bush , son of the former President and her Republican opponent , of insensitivity to minorities . Last weekend , on a campaign swing that took her from an NAACP civil_rights march in Houston to black churches in Dallas to a Latino rally deep in the Rio Grande Valley , she aggressively sold her record of hiring minorities for state office and funneling state contracts to minority businesses . This return to traditional themes carries measurable risks for Democrats . Attacks on the rich can motivate base Democrats but repel independents , Ayres noted . And , especially in Southern states , overt appeals_to minorities like Richards ' carry the risk of alienating some white voters .</TEXT>
