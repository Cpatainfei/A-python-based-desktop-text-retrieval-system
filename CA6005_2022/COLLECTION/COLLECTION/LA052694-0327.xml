   <HEADLINE> FROZEN CHICKEN WARS HEAT_UP ; POULTRY : HOW COLD IS FROZEN ? CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL CHICKEN PRODUCERS can ' t AGREE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A war of words will have to suffice while California chicken producers await their day in federal_court in a long-running campaign to remove the word &quot; fresh &quot; from labels on out-of-state chickens that have been allegedly frozen , thawed and then placed in local meat_counters as if shipped right from the nearest San Joaquin Valley coop . Cries of &quot; fraud &quot; and &quot; unscrupulous &quot; have been used by California producers to describe what they call the frozen-thaw-fresh practice employed by some producers in the Southeastern United States who they say ship rock-hard broilers to the California market , the nation ' s largest . &quot; Ninety percent of our product is sold fresh or refrigerated to 28 degrees , &quot; said Bill Mattos , president of the California Poultry Industry Federation . &quot; The other producing states want to ship their broilers at any temperature above zero degrees . So product coming_into this state can be chilled to zero , thawed and sold as fresh . In our opinion , that isn ' t fresh. &quot; Gary Kushner , attorney with Hogan &amp; Hartson in Washington , who represents national poultry trade groups insists that broilers raised in the Southeastern United States and shipped to California &quot; are not frozen. &quot; &quot; The average temperature ( Southeastern producers ) try to maintain during transport is closer to the mid-20s then below that , &quot; he said . &quot; There is no need to bring ( poultry ) product to very low_temperatures because it only increases the producers ' energy and storage costs. &quot; Kushner said he doesn ' t know the average temperature of Southeastern-raised broilers by the time they reach California outlets . But regardless of possible temperature fluctuations in transit , he said that according to the federal Poultry Products Inspection Act , a chicken is legally considered fresh as long as it isn ' t chilled below zero degrees . Scientists consider the freezing point for chicken is between 28 degrees and 29 degrees . &quot; Wherever the temperature ( on a bird ' s carcass ) reaches 28 degrees , &quot; said Glenn W . Froning Ph.D. , a food science professor at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln , &quot; that area would be considered frozen. &quot; * The feud is unusual in the food industry , particularly within the confines of a single commodity group such_as chicken , because regional interests are normally loath to criticize other producers for fear that the sniping may taint the image of everyone ' s product . Poultry producers are particularly unlikely candidates for a quarrel because the industry normally presents a united front to weather increasing attacks from consumer advocates and Congress about high levels of contamination in uncooked chickens . But the &quot; do not fault one ' s chicken colleague &quot; credo has cracked . Now it ' s pretty much California against the rest of the chicken world . The chief adversaries are Arkansas and Georgia , the nation ' s top two producers . Most California broiler production is sold within the state , which has the nation ' s highest per-capita rate of chicken consumption -- 80 pounds per person vs . the U.S. average of 73 pounds . At stake is about $ 4 billion in fresh broiler sales in the state ; about half those sales go_to California producers . The conflict dates_back to 1988 but heated_up last June when state Sen . Dan McCorquodale ( D-Modesto ) introduced a bill that would prohibit previously frozen chicken -- defined in the bill as any bird held at 25 degrees or less for a period of 24 hours or more -- from being labeled &quot; fresh. &quot; The state Senate and Assembly unanimously passed the bill and it was signed into law by Gov . Pete Wilson last September . Shortly thereafter , the Arkansas Poultry Federation , the National Broiler Council and the American Meat Institute filed suit in U.S. District Court to overturn the law ; they claimed it was preempted by the federal Poultry Products Inspection Act . Federal Judge David Levi agreed with the three trade groups and ruled against California in December . California producers appealed and were granted an expedited hearing in front of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco . It ' s expected the case will be scheduled some time next month . &quot; The intent behind the California law was simply to protect local markets , &quot; said Kushner , who represented the three trade groups . &quot; I seriously doubt it was intended to protect California consumers from ' unscrupulous ' out-of-state producers. &quot; * In its appeal , California has garnered the support of Consumers Union , the Consumer Federation of America and the California Home_Economics Assn . Consumers Union , in a brief filed with the Court of Appeals , claims that some out-of-state chickens are not only frozen for shipping but &quot; stored for months , or even a year , in a frozen state &quot; before being sold . Meanwhile , U.S. Department_of_Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy commissioned a review of the Federal regulation in February . Among the areas being studied : changes in poultry ' s physical characteristics at different temperatures , how spoilage becomes a factor_in various refrigerated conditions , and how potentially harmful bacteria react to temperature_changes . &quot; We think consumers would be appalled , &quot; Mattos said , &quot; if they knew out-of-state chickens were frozen , thawed and sold as fresh. &quot;</TEXT>
