   <TEXT> EAGLE HUNTING : A recent Boston concert stint by the Eagles led Beantown rock radio_station WBCN-FM to bare its talons -- and Don Henley to respond in kind . Attacking the band ' s concert ticket prices of about $ 100 , the station held a contest and awarded $ 50 &quot; Eagles Greedy Rebates &quot; to eight Boston concert-goers . &quot; The radio_station has nothing against the Eagles at all , &quot; says WBCN promotions director Chachi Loprete . &quot; We ' ve played them for years . But when the tickets went_on sale we thought they were way too high and set a bad precedent and we thought we should do something. &quot; In addition to the rebate contest , the station preceded the Eagles ' shows with an &quot; Anti-Greed Weekend , &quot; emphasizing music by acts who have come_out against high ticket prices , such_as Pearl Jam and Neil Young . Henley ' s reaction ? During the Eagles ' opening-night show at Boston ' s 20 # 000-seat Great Woods arena , home phone_numbers and addresses of five WBCN deejays were flashed on video screens and Henley asked fans to send them their dirty laundry before singing his song &quot; Dirty Laundry. &quot; Eagles spokesman Larry Solters dismissed the incidents as merely the latest flaps in a war of words that goes_back nearly five years to Henley ' s not giving WBCN exclusive promotion rights to his Boston concerts benefiting his Walden Woods Foundation .
