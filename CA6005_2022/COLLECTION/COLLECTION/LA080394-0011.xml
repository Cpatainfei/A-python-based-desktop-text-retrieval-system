   <HEADLINE> A WAR ANNIVERSARY HARD TO CELEBRATE ; THE A-BOMB : THE VALOR OF U.S. TROOPS IN EUROPE AND THE PACIFIC IS AN AWKWARD BACKDROP FOR THE NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST WE INFLICTED ON CIVILIAN HIROSHIMA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> America is in a commemorative mood . The D-Day ceremonies captured the attention of the entire nation . Soon we will mark the 50th anniversary of many other World_War_II milestones , from the fall of Berlin to the liberation of the concentration_camps . The U.S. military ' s sweep across the Pacific will be memorialized at Leyte Gulf and the Philippines , on Iwo Jima and Okinawa . But these occasions , unlike those related to the war against Hitler , will be haunted by awareness of what comes next : Hiroshima and Nagasaki . The stories of the American soldiers who invaded Normandy were supremely moving . There were tens of thousands of these GIs ; they fought with unreliable , low-tech weapons , aimed only at soldiers on the other side . Now consider Hiroshima : one bomb , one plane , 100 # 000 civilians dead . It will be interesting to see what America -- the media , the President , the average citizen -- makes of this contrast next August . The truth is , America has never come_to terms with the atomic bombings , so a_few painful days of soul-searching is not only desirable , it ' s unavoidable . It will be a time for taking_stock , for reflecting on the fact that half a century ago something revolutionary happened and it changed everything . No matter what we think_of Hiroshima , it has affected us deeply . This wrenching re-examination , in fact , has already begun . For years , technicians at the National Air and Space Museum have been reassembling the Enola Gay , the plane that dropped the bomb over Hiroshima . Next year , they will finally put the front section of the B-29 on display . To its credit , the Smithsonian Institution ( which runs the museum ) plans a comprehensive exhibit that includes the bomb victims . The Enola Gay exhibit will feature a Ground Zero room , reproducing a wasteland of rubble , ruins and heat-fused material . This is the Hiroshima landscape familiar to most Americans , and generally it upsets no one ; among other things , it testifies to the success of the mission . Butthis Ground Zero goes a step further , including in the panorama charred bodies and items belonging_to dead schoolchildren . The show hasn ' t even opened and already it ' s drawing flak , proof of how raw the wound remains . A group of Air_Force veterans has seen a copy of the proposal for the show and is &quot; feeling nuked , &quot; as Hugh Sidey tastelessly put it in Time magazine not long ago . The veterans complain that the exhibit pays more attention to Japanese casualties at Hiroshima than to Japanese atrocities earlier in the war . The Air_Force Assn . charges that it is &quot; a slap in the face to all Americans who fought in World_War_II &quot; and &quot; treats Japan and the U.S. as if their participation in the war were morally equivalent. &quot; Sen . Nancy Kassebaum ( R-Kans. ) sent a letter to the Smithsonian calling the exhibit ( which no one has seen yet ) &quot; a travesty. &quot; Smithsonian officials respond diplomatically , explaining that the treatment of the atomic bombing would be &quot; objective &quot; and make no judgment on the morality of the decision to drop the bomb . The two curators are annoyed , however . One , Tom Crouch , asserts that critics of the exhibit have a &quot; reluctance to really tell the whole story . They want to stop the story when the bomb leaves the bomb bay. &quot; This repeats a pattern established early on . American officials wanted to keep the human side of Hiroshima hidden . They minimized radiation effects and obscured the extent and identity of the casualties -- the vast majority of them women and children . ( President Truman ' s initial announcement referred to Hiroshima , a city of more_than 300 # 000 , merely as a &quot; military base. &quot; ) They curtailed access to the bombed cities and censored articles and seized photographs and film footage that showed the human effects of the bomb . In any case , it was a &quot; painless &quot; way to die , said Gen . Leslie Groves , director of the Manhattan_Project , which built the bomb . Suppression was so complete that just months afterward , novelist Mary McCarthy was dismissing Hiroshima as &quot; a hole in human history. &quot; Thirty years later , physicist Ralph Lapp , who worked_on the bomb , asked : &quot; If the memory of things is to deter , where is that memory ? Hiroshima has been taken_out of the American conscience -- eviscerated , extirpated. &quot; But there is another reason , besides an approaching anniversary , that Hiroshima has special resonance right now . Since last December , the Energy_Department , prompted by an award-winning newspaper series , has released thousands of documents revealing shocking details about the U.S._government ' s radiation experiments . Among other things , hospital patients were injected with plutonium without their permission , and radiation was deliberately released from nuclear plants . Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary has promised a full investigation . But why should we be surprised by a horror story related to our nearly 50-year experience with nuclear_energy ? Secrecy , reckless endangerment and death were there from the beginning -- even before Hiroshima . While developing the bomb , the Manhattan_Project simultaneously began hideous medical experiments on unsuspecting civilians . Thousands more also were exposed to hazardous levels of radiation while working_on the project . When the bomb was tested in the New Mexico desert in July , 1945 , project leaders feared that a radioactive cloud might sail over populated areas , but they rejected evacuation plans . ( Fallout would indeed drift a_hundred miles downwind. ) Experimentation and subterfuge have played a major role in America ' s nuclear program ever since . For decades , this would have severe implications for workers in the nuclear_power and nuclear_weapons industries , for residents of communities adjoining those installations , for soldiers and civilians subjected_to dangerous fallout from nuclear tests . Rather than going too far , the Smithsonian ' s Enola Gay exhibit doesn ' t go quite far enough . To really convey the impact of the first atomic_bomb , it should include another display , this one called America Ground Zero . There we ' d find atomic soldiers and nuclear workers , medical guinea_pigs and down-winders -- the legacy of Hiroshima .</TEXT>
