   <HEADLINE> VOLKSWAGEN STRUGGLES THROUGH SLUMP ; ECONOMY : POSTWAR GERMANY ' S WORST RECESSION HAS FORCED THE GIANT AUTO BUILDER TO MAKE MANY WRENCHING DECISIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every 16 seconds , a new car zips off the assembly_lines at Volkswagen ' s huge headquarters factory in this northern German city . But that blinding speed hasn ' t been enough to spare Volkswagen the need to make wrenching changes affecting its corporate culture and the lives of the 51 # 000 people behind the auto_maker ' s shiny products here . They numbered 65 # 000 only a_few years ago . VW has trimmed staff but says the number is still too high . To avoid more job cuts , Europe ' s biggest auto_maker and its union have agreed to shorten the workweek and reduce annual pay by about 10 % . &quot; It was a big surprise to take such a big cut . I never thought it was possible , &quot; said Heinz Mutzick , a 33-year factory veteran who brings_home about $ 1 # 750 a month . The pay_cut really hasn ' t hit yet . The lower pay will come_in the form of reduced bonuses , so the ax will fall_in June when workers won ' t get the extra month ' s pay they ' re used to . VW workers are dialing back vacation plans and reducing their savings and other expenses to compensate for the lower income . Joerg Wolter figured he might have been laid_off , even after 16 years on the assembly_line . So he was happy to take a pay_cut instead . Part of his personal defense , however , will hurt VW ' s sales . Wolter had bought a new VW every year at a discount . Now he ' ll wait . Similar things are happening around Germany as the nation creeps out of its worst recession since World_War_II and many companies deal with tough competition from countries where workers are paid less . Expectations of climbing wages are kaput . Last year , average wages in western Germany grew 3.8 % , while inflation was 4.2 % . Volkswagen AG , which lost a whopping 1.94 billion marks , or $ 1.13 billion , last year , has made one of the most radical changes of any German company . The government reacted angrily when VW said it would go_to a four-day workweek to avoid laying_off 30 # 000 of its 100 # 000 workers in Germany . Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Germans need to work more hours , not fewer , to regain competitiveness . The promised four-day week has turned_out to be a five-day week with shifts of five hours and 46 minutes for many assembly-line workers . But VW management is certain it made the right move . &quot; We wanted to find a typical VW solution , &quot; said Guenther Koch , a personnel executive . &quot; If we thought we would n ' t remain No . 1 in Europe , we would have let a lot of people go. &quot; The advantage of the short workweek , Koch said , is to keep skilled people , &quot; get_over the hump &quot; and move_back to longer shifts in 1996 . Koch ' s negotiating adversary , Bernd Osterloh , head of shop_stewards for the IG Metall metalworkers union , said it was an &quot; intelligent solution &quot; in comparison with Daimler-Benz AG ' s laying_off of 50 # 000 . He said the shortened VW workweek also was better than the solution at General Motors Corp . subsidiary Opel , which agreed last year with its union to cut bonuses and trim pay increases . &quot; They ' re working 36 hours but getting less pay , &quot; Osterloh said , while VW ' s move showed &quot; good solidarity. &quot; Solidarity and loyalty run_through the VW factory and the city of Wolfsburg , which was created from scratch in 1938 . After World_War_II , the best-selling VW Beetle was built_in Wolfsburg and the state-owned company was largely privatized , though the state of Lower_Saxony still holds 20 % of the shares . The concept of worker loyalty extends beyond the factory to German society as well . Mutzick , the veteran factory hand , said the world suffered terribly from the 1930s mass unemployment that helped bring_on the Nazi government . Today ' s VW solution can provide an example for the nation , he said . Friedhelm Schofeld , one of thousands who took early retirement in recent years as VW was trimming its work_force , said Volkswagen acted humanely following his 32 years ' employment -- and was still doing so with the reduced workweek . But he is unsure of the future . &quot; There won ' t ever be another boom and I won ' t be surprised if there have to be more cutbacks. &quot; The new shifts for a 28.8-hour workweek went_into effect after the Easter factory shutdown . Life is not the same in Wolfsburg . &quot; The pulse of the factory sets the pulse of public life , &quot; said Koch , the personnel executive .</TEXT>
