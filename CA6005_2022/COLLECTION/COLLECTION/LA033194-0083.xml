The seven-year study of 18 # 000 volunteers nationwide will involve Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena , Methodist Hospital of Southern California in Arcadia and St . Luke Medical_Center in Pasadena . The study will test the effectiveness of the drug finasteride in the prevention of prostate cancer . It is a double-blind trial , which means that neither the men participating nor the study physicians will be told who is taking the drug and who is taking a placebo . During the study , test hospitals will provide pills , and an annual exam and blood_test . Between visits , hospital staff will check on participants by telephone . In seven years , participants will undergo a prostate_gland biopsy . Eligible volunteers should be at least 55 years old , in good_health , cancer-free in the past five years and free_of chemotherapy or radiation treatment . Also , participants must have a normal rectal exam and test negative for prostate cancer . Special efforts are being made to recruit African American men because they have a higher rate of prostate cancer . One out of seven men older than 55 will be found to have prostate cancer . It is the second most common form of cancer -- after lung_cancer -- among men in the United States . Information : ( 818 ) 397-5287 .</TEXT>
