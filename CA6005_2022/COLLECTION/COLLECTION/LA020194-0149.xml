   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : BUENA PARK ; BOYS CLUB HONORS 1ST WOMAN ON ITS BOARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Donna Bagley will never forget that day in November , 1957 , when she was asked to join the all-male board of directors for the Boys Club of Buena Park . &quot; I laughed -- because they were all men , &quot; said Bagley , who will turn 82 in March . &quot; They told me they needed a mother ' s viewpoint . This one man thought I had the courage to be a pioneer. &quot; That board_member was right . The civic- and community-minded Bagley did take that courageous step and accepted the invitation . She became the first woman to serve on the board . &quot; I was the one that broke the ice , &quot; she said , adding she found it a &quot; challenge and a responsibility. &quot; Bagley , mother of two sons , one of whom died in a car accident as a teen-ager , retired from the board this month after 36 years . But she was given the honorary title of &quot; historical consultant &quot; because of the wealth of knowledge she has about the club ' s early years . Bagley has also received another title . Because of her dedication and service to the club , she was honored as the organization ' s &quot; Volunteer of the Year &quot; on Saturday at an annual volunteer and donor recognition dinner . &quot; She gives a lot of time and effort unselfishly -- and with no pay . And I think her heart is in it , &quot; said fellow board_member Larry Stern , who has served with Bagley for 16 years . Stern said Bagley has always been in the forefront in coming_up with ways the club could secure money from donors to keep it going . &quot; She ' s the first one to be there because she ' s concerned about the kids , &quot; he said . During her more_than three decades as a board_member -- never serving as president because she &quot; didn ' t want to be president &quot; -- Bagley was instrumental in raising money to keep the club open and expanding programs for the youth . Currently , the club , which is now open_to both boys and girls ages 6 to 17 , has a membership of 1 # 600 . Bagley , who for 35 years operated an income_tax service , also managed to find time to frequent the club &quot; to let kids know we were interested. &quot; Bagley has been involved in the community since she and her husband of 50 years , Wallace , moved to Buena Park in 1948 and bought a home_in the city ' s second housing tract . A year after they moved to the city , Bagley joined the Buena Park Woman ' s Club and has been_active in that organization ever since . Over the years , Bagley has been publicly recognized for her community endeavors and volunteerism . &quot; I ' ve had more satisfaction , more recognition and more awards than any one person deserves , &quot; she said . But being honored as the club ' s top volunteer may be the highlight of her life , she said . &quot; I ' m overwhelmed , &quot; said Bagley , who still cooks , sews her own clothes , knits and attends the same church she has belonged_to for the past 42 years . &quot; I ' ve had so many awards , but I think this may be more meaningful than anything that ' s happened. &quot; Bagley , a grandmother of four , said she was touched when she saw an ad last week in the program for Saturday ' s event that thanked her for her service . &quot; Just thinking_about it brings tears to my eyes , &quot; she said . &quot; It means a great_deal to me to be part of this wonderful organization. &quot; While getting another award is an honor , the real reward is knowing that she has made a difference in the lives of youngsters . &quot; I ' ve tried to be a good role_model for young people as a caring person , &quot; she said . And being involved in her community is something she will never give_up . &quot; This is where I belong . I ' ve been a part of Buena Park , and Buena Park is a part of me , &quot; she said.DEBRA CANO</TEXT>
