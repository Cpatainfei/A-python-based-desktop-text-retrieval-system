   <HEADLINE> THE L.A. RIVER ' S ' NATURAL ' HISTORY ; UNTIL 1825 , THE LOS ANGELES BASIN WAS VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE CURRENT DESERT . WHAT WAS THE AREA ' S ENVIRONMENT IN THE DISTANT PAST ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In light of proposals to restore the concrete-lined Los Angeles River to its &quot; natural &quot; state , plus the recent discovery of fossil bones of an imperial_mammoth and a saber-toothed cat beneath Hollywood Boulevard , it ' s instructive to reflect on the Los Angeles Basin ' s distant past . How many other such fossils lie below us ? What was Los Angeles ' environment really like &quot; way back when &quot; ? How many topomorphic revolutions have been wrought here by flood and earthquake since behemoths chewed cud at the Bowl ? Our ideas of the past are likely to be influenced by the city ' s chaparral-covered backdrop . It ' s easy to assume that the basin of yesteryear was all dust and desolation . But the lowlands of the coastal_plain were vastly different from what we might think . Evidently they were a veritable Garden_of_Eden during the millennia following the last Ice_Age , right down till 1825 . The earliest human inhabitants of the lowlands of the South Coast Basin lived_in a verdant complex of marsh and forest , not a desert . The L.A. River did not run_into the ocean ; it dispersed into an extensive wetland matrix . All that changed overnight in the biggest flood_in recorded L.A. history . For eons , a constant supply of surface and ground-water sustained a superlative matrix of forest and tule in the bottom land of Los Angeles and Orange counties . Large areas of giant sycamore , ash , cottonwood and alder were interspersed with marshes filled with sedges and bull rushes . The coastal edge of the plain was mottled by a string of ancient peat_bogs . Waters of the Los Angeles , San Gabriel and Santa Ana rivers dispersed laterally over the plain . The wintertime runoff leaked through to the Pacific at numerous points . Memoirs and histories by John Warner , Benhamin Hayes , Joseph Widney and Thomas Talbert make_it clear that none of the rivers flowed into the ocean until the spring of 1825 . A decade earlier a 10-day deluge had sent the Los Angeles River bursting_out of the San Fernando watershed carrying an immense number of fallen trees from higher points . As the waters spread_out below Elysian Narrows , the interlock of drifting branches and forest trunks stopped the boulders rocks and gravel flowing with the current . A broad , oval-shaped berm 10 to 15 feet high built_up , extending about two-thirds of a mile east from the present-day rail yard below Chinatown to where the Golden State Freeway crosses Main_Street . The river immediately shifted toward the southwest . The large Gabrielino village called Yang-na lying_in its new path was turned_to a morass of floating wickiups . Bypassing the coastal_plain , the river flowed toward the southwest into the present Exposition Park area , then west into the forests and marshes of the Ballona Creek drainage . Then , in 1825 , a hard rainstorm occurred one spring day at the Los Angeles pueblo and broke_up in the afternoon . The weather the following day was clear , and a full_moon illuminated the landscape that night . The river had risen but had not given cause for alarm . At midnight an immense wall of water poured through the narrows under the moonlight and broke_through the 10-year-old debris dam . The resultant ground shaking and noise awoke the area . Jose Lugo , 12 , emerged from his father ' s adobe on San Pedro Road , ran to the west_bank of the now-empty river channel and watched the flood cutting a new channel along the far eastern side of the valley at the edge of the present Boyle Heights . The water cut_away the base of the slope that defines the heights , and the morning revealed a sparkling white bluff of quartz sand and rounded white beach pebbles . It was known afterward as Paredon Blanco . The 30-plus hours between the rain at the pueblo and the arrival of the flood indicates that a storm of biblical proportions had occurred at a high elevation and far away . One can postulate that an unfathomable deluge had taken_place over the upper Big Tujunga Canyon . The force of the water that poured through the Elysian Narrows that April night was sufficient to cut a river channel through forest and swamp all_the way south from the Los Angeles Valley to the eastern portion of Rancho Dominguez near the present city of Carson . A huge inland lake formed within the bottom land_area there . When it began to drain into the Pacific , it revealed the remains of thousands of animals . Thus was born the &quot; natural &quot; L.A. river as we know it . The new outlet to the sea drained the wetlands , and with the loss of the accompanying ground-water , the huge lowland forest disappeared in the following years . The wetlands of Bolsa Chica and Newport are the sole surviving fragments of the original matrix , which may have been as large as 300 square_miles . Four years after the great flood , Kit Carson and Ewing Young made their first expedition into the Los Angeles Basin . The natural beauty was still such_that Carson henceforth described Los Angeles as &quot; truly a paradise on earth. &quot;</TEXT>
