   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / SEMIFINALS ; THE FINAL FOUR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 52-game , 24-team World Cup has come_down to its final stages . Four teams have earned the right to play today for a berth in the final on Sunday at the Rose Bowl . TEAM ANALYSIS BULGARIA As it has proved time and again in this tournament , Bulgaria is a lot more_than simply Hristo Stoitchkov , the star and supporting cast or 21 . Sunday ' s victory over defending champion Germany underlined that fact . The Germans managed to frustrate Stoitchkov for virtually the entire game but still lost . Why ? Because the Bulgarians never were in_awe_of their opponents . They played a calm disciplined game , never hurrying or appearing hurried . The defense is particularly cool under pressure , with Zlatko Iankov , Trifon Ivanov and Tsanko Tzvetanov especially impressive . In the midfield , Krasimir Balakov orchestrates the action , either distributing the ball in an intelligent fashion or making forays_into the opposing penalty area . If Stoitchkov is marked_out of the game , as he was against Germany , the job of scoring falls to Emil Kostadinov or Nasko Sirakov . But as the Bulgarians proved Sunday , any of them can find the back of the net . Yordan Letchkov is a thoughtful midfielder who typifies the Bulgarians ' habit of involving all players in both the offense and defense . He gave_away a penalty at one end of the field and later scored the winning goal at the other . As for style , Bulgaria is a counterattacking team that relies_on the fast break and on set plays , such_as free_kicks and corners , to break_down the opposition . Goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov , who plays for a second-division team in France , has done_well enough in this tournament to earn himself a heftier contract with a more fashionable club . Of course , with the exception of Stoitchkov , already at Barcelona , the same it true for all_of the Bulgarina &quot; supporting cast. &quot; World Cup ' 90 Bulgaria did not qualify for the finals because it was 1-4-1 in Group 1 eliminations . Bulgaria had not won a World Cup match in 16 tries before this year . A . Bulgaria vs .

Italy has shown only flashes of promise , only a hint of its true talent . It has been_on the ropes and mere seconds away from elimination . But it has survived . Now , it is in the semifinals , and it is all due_to that elusive quality that some call luck , others call fate and few can really pinpoint . Italy has been bedeviled by injuries , losing its most experienced defender , Franco Baresi , for the entire tournament . Italy has been the victim of red cards , losing its starting goalkeeper , Gianluca Pagliuca , and one of its strikers , Gianfranco Zola , in separate games . In addition , defender Mauro Tassotti received an eight-game suspension for an elbow that broke Spanish forward Luis Enrique ' s nose late in Saturday ' s quarterfinal . Roberto Baggio has received most of the praise because he has scored the goals that have kept his country alive . But Baggio has played far better in the past . Coach Arrigo Sacchi , who has tinkered incessantly with his starting lineup , has imposed a rigid tactical discipline that has brought success and caused problems . The player ' s need for self-expression and inventiveness and spur-of-the moment creativity has been stifled . Italy in 1994 has not been an attractive team to watch , and Italian fans have suffered all sorts of agonies as their team has struggled to overcome the restraints placed on it by the coach . World Cup ' 90 Italy automatically qualified as the host country . The home-country advantage helped it get_to the semifinals , where it tied Argentina , 1-1 , but lost on penalty kicks , 4-3 .
