   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : HOW TO PROFIT AS YIELDS JUMP_ON CASH_ACCOUNTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 40 members of Congress wrote to Federal_Reserve_Board Chairman Alan Greenspan on Tuesday , advising him to stop raising short-term interest_rates . They ' re forgetting that some people have waited a long_time for this . After five years of loose money ( though it may_not have felt all that loose ) , the economy is growing at a healthy pace and the Fed is tightening credit accordingly -- quite a natural_event , most economists agree . And while most of the news_stories since the first Fed interest_rate boost Feb . 4 have focused_on the negative aspects of higher rates , there are some clear winners here : Anyone who keeps money in short-term &quot; cash &quot; accounts , for example . That would include conservative savers , as well as the many smart investors who use a cash cushion as a buffer against turmoil in_stocks and bonds . So let ' s say you ' re trying to squeeze the maximum return out of your short-term cash today . What are the best options ? Here are details on some common cash instruments . * Money_market mutual_funds . These funds typically own very short-term corporate debt , government_securities and bank CDs , and for that reason they are the easiest way to ride rising short-term interest_rates . As they continually turn_over their investments , they ' re buying new paper at higher yields , so you earn more . Money funds also are extremely safe ; barring some catastrophe , your principal value stays constant at $ 1 a share , so many investors use the funds as substitutes for federally insured bank_accounts . ( The funds aren ' t insured. ) Since Feb . 4 , the Federal_Reserve has raised its benchmark short-term interest_rate from 3 % to 3.75 % . As other short yields have followed that rate higher , the average annualized yield on taxable money funds has risen from 2.71 % to 3.08 % , according to fund tracker IBC / Donoghue Inc. in Ashland , Mass . At the same time , the funds have been shortening their investment maturities so they ' re turning money over faster -- the logical thing to do when the Fed is boosting rates . The average money fund maturity was 61 days on Feb . 4 ; now it ' s 46 days . The upshot is that fund yields have further to climb , as they replace investments more rapidly at today ' s higher rates . Walter Frank , chief investment officer at IBC / Donoghue , figures that if the Fed raises its benchmark market rate to 4 % soon as expected , money fund yields will level_off at about 3.3 % to 3.5 % by summer . Fund management fees account_for the difference between market rates and what the funds actually pay you . One other option , if you ' re in a high tax_bracket : tax-free money funds , which invest in short-term municipal paper issued by states and cities . But tax-free yields can be more volatile : The average fund yields 1.81 % currently , which is actually lower than the 1.86 % average yield of Feb . 4 . * Bank CDs . Yields on certificates_of_deposit typically rise more slowly than money fund yields when the Fed is tightening credit , as banks try to keep their costs down for as long as possible . Still , CD rates are definitely in an up trend now , according to Robert Heady , publisher of Bank_Rate Monitor newsletter in North Palm Beach , Fla . One-year CDs now yield an average 3.34 % nationwide , up from 3.03 % on Feb . 4 , Heady says . If you shop around , you can earn more . Bank of America had a one-day promotion last week , offering 5 % yields on nine-month CDs . But Heady suggests that most savers stay short . &quot; A three-month CD is as long as I ' d go now , &quot; he says . The reason : He expects short-term interest_rates to continue rising slowly through 1994 and perhaps into 1995 as the economy grows . If you keep your cash rolling_over in three-month CDs ( which average about 2.7 % now nationwide ) , you ' ll ride the tide higher , he says . It ' s just too early to lock_up cash_in longer CDs , he argues . * U.S. Treasury_bills . If you feel a strong need to go &quot; long &quot; and you have at least $ 10 # 000 in cash , buy T-bills . Their yields are far above those of bank CDs : 4.40 % now on a six-month T-bill versus 2.97 % on the average six-month bank CD , for example . And , unlike CDs , T-bill interest is exempt from state tax -- a big lure in high-tax California . You can buy three- or six-month T-bills direct from the Fed weekly . ( Call ( 213 ) 624-7398 for order forms. ) One-year T-bills are sold monthly . Many banks will also buy bills for you , for a fee . More for Your Cash Here ' s how average yields on some common short-term savings vehicles have changed since Feb . 4 , when the Federal_Reserve_Board began to tighten credit for the first time in five years . 03 # 23 , 10 # 10 * 2 * Annualized yield Instrument Feb . 4 Now Taxable money funds 2.71 % 3.08 % Tax-free money funds 1.86 1.81 Bank money_market accounts 2.30 2.33 6-month bank CD 2.75 2.97 1-year bank CD 3.04 3.34 3-month Treasury_bill 3.28 3.98 6-month Treasury_bill 3.47 4.40 1-year Treasury_bill 3.83 4.88 Money fund yields are seven-day compound yields .
