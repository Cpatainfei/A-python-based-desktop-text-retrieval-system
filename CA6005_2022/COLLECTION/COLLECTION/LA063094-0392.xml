   <HEADLINE> NOTEBOOK / KIRBY LEE ; RAMIREZ IS HOPING TO GET EAST L.A. COLLEGE PROGRAM BACK ON TRACK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The track and cross-country programs have returned to East Los Angeles College . And so has Louis Ramirez . The former Montebello High coach who led East L.A. teams from 1988-90 and competed for the Huskies in 1977-78 has been named to head the recently reinstated programs . Ramirez , 38 , who has coached at Trade Tech for the past four years , said that his ties to East L.A. and the school ' s facilities influenced his decision to return to his alma_mater . Teams coached by Ramirez have won Southern California Athletic Conference women ' s cross-country titles . Ramirez led the East L.A. women to three consecutive SCAC titles before moving to Trade Tech , where the men ' s team won its third conference track title in four years this season . While coaching at Montebello High , Ramirez led the Oiler girls to a second-place finish in the 1987 Southern Section 3-A finals and three consecutive Whitmont League titles . East L.A. has not fielded a cross-country or track team since 1991 . Ramirez took_over in 1988 after the programs were suspended for two years because of budget_cuts . &quot; It ' s going_to be easier this time because I ' ve established a wider region to draw from , &quot; Ramirez said . &quot; I ' m very well-known around East L.A. , but I can also draw from City schools . There has been a void at East L.A. , but there are a lot of kids already there that want to come and run. &quot; * Michael Granville of Bell Gardens High has been named the State Sophomore of the Year by Cal-Hi Sports magazine . Granville , who last year was named the Freshman of the Year , won the 800 meters in the state meet to become the school ' s first_state champion and set a sophomore national record of 1 minute , 48.98 seconds this season . * Long_Beach State placed third in the Jakarta Sister Cities_Men ' s Volleyball tournament in Indonesia , defeating Amsterdam in the consolation final . The 49ers finished second in their bracket to Jakarta before suffering a loss to eventual champion Seoul in the semifinals .
