   <HEADLINE> RENO ASKS COURT TO APPOINT FISKE AS INDEPENDENT COUNSEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Atty . Gen . Janet Reno asked a federal appeals court Friday to appoint Robert B . Fiske Jr . as an independent counsel to continue his investigation of President Clinton ' s investments with the owner of a failed Arkansas thrift . Reno took the action a day after Clinton signed legislation reviving the independent counsel statute , which had lapsed for 18 months . Last January , Reno appointed Fiske as special counsel to probe the Whitewater and related investments of Clinton and his wife Hillary during Clinton ' s terms as Arkansas governor . But she had said repeatedly that it would be better for an independent panel of judges to appoint the person pursuing the investigation . Under the statute passed_by Congress this week , a special division of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District_of_Columbia Circuit appoints independent counsels . &quot; I hereby request that the court appoint a statutory independent counsel as soon as possible , and that the court appoint Robert B . Fiske Jr. , so that he may continue his ongoing investigation without disruption and with the full independence provided by the act , &quot; Reno wrote the appeals court . Fiske &quot; has not reported to the Department_of_Justice concerning his investigative results or the direction of his investigation , &quot; Reno added . She said the new independent counsel statute allows the court to choose Fiske . Sen . Lauch Faircloth ( R-N.C. ) criticized Reno ' s action , saying Fiske was too closely tied to present and former Administration officials to be sufficiently independent . Faircloth also called it &quot; highly improper &quot; for Reno to recommend Fiske ' s appointment . He said she should encourage the judges &quot; to appoint a new , truly independent counsel. &quot; The independent counsel statute provides only for criminal jurisdiction . Under his appointment by Reno , Fiske also had civil jurisdiction , the ability to file a civil suit against people or entities investigated . If the court names someone else as independent counsel on the_matter , Reno said she also would name that person &quot; as an independent special attorney to handle all civil aspects of the investigation. &quot;</TEXT>
