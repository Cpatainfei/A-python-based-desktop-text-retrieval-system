   <HEADLINE> DEAD-END CASES PILE_UP ; DETECTIVES ARMED WITH FEWER RESOURCES TACKLE THE GROWING PROBLEM OF UNSOLVED HOMICIDES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The news shocked the Chinese American community in Los Angeles and Orange counties . Ho Fu ( Eric ) Chiu , 20 , a state amateur badminton champion and president of Cypress College ' s Chinese student association , was dead . Likable , hard-working , handsome and athletic , Chiu led a life full of promise in his adopted country . Nonetheless , the Taiwan native was found dead May 20 , 1992 , shot inside his car , which was left in a recreation center parking_lot in El Monte . Nearly two years later , Chiu ' s killing remains unsolved , despite hours of investigation and dozens of people questioned . &quot; There ' s absolutely no reason that we ' ve found for this murder , &quot; said El Monte Police Det . Linda Parrott , frustration in her voice . Chiu ' s death typifies a growing phenomenon nationwide that has hit San Gabriel Valley cities especially hard . People are literally getting_away with murder . Nationwide over the past 30 years , homicide detectives have found themselves stymied by more and more unsolved cases . In 1961 , 92 % of homicides were declared solved , with suspects arrested . Three decades later , the rate has plummeted to 67 % , two out of three solved . In the 30 San Gabriel Valley cities , the rate is even worse . Less than half -- 47 % -- of all homicides resulted in arrests , according to 1992 state_Department of Justice Statistics . That same year , the Los Angeles Police_Department solved 59 % of its homicides , 640 of 1 # 094 , while the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department solved 62 % , 333 of 565 homicides , according to state statistics . &quot; The solves are going_down , that ' s true , &quot; said El Monte Police Lt . Ken Jeske , who oversees homicide investigations in his city of 106 # 000 . &quot; We should be at 80 % or 90 % , &quot; Jeske said . &quot; But it ' s about 50 % for everybody in Southern California because we all suffer the same problems. &quot; Gone are the days when detectives spent their days mainly on domestic dispute slayings -- husband / wife or boyfriend / girlfriend killings , such obvious crimes that police call them &quot; walk-throughs &quot; or &quot; self-solvers. &quot; More victims now are felled by strangers or by gang members , end_up as unidentified bodies dumped in parks and streets or come from vulnerable populations , such_as the elderly and immigrants . And these kinds of cases are coming when police_departments find themselves in some ways less equipped to investigate them . The informant network , used by detectives for decades , is withering . Plus , detectives are a younger , less experienced group with less commitment to staying in homicide bureaus , say criminologists and veteran detectives . All of it combines to make murder , the most heinous of crimes , one of the least solvable . A look_at a handful of the San Gabriel Valley ' s unsolved killings illustrates why homicide detectives are having a tough time solving cases . * At 8:15 on a Friday evening in September , 1992 , Tung Kuang Ku , 39 , the sole employee in the Teriyaki Bowl on West Duarte Road in Arcadia , was shot when an armed gunman demanded the couple of hundred dollars that was in the cash_register . The Rosemead father of two died from a gunshot to his torso . Witnesses saw only the race of the gunman but could not describe him or his getaway car in detail . With no one to question and little else to go_on , police hit a dead-end , said Arcadia Police Lt . Dave Hinig . * Ku ' s death is a typical &quot; stranger homicide , &quot; a killing in which the victim didn ' t know his slayer . Absent a relationship between victim and slayer and with no description of the killer or a weapon , police can ' t even begin to look_for a suspect , Hinig said . Instead , they must rely_on luck : that fingerprints taken at the scene might lead them to someone later . Stranger homicides represent a changing pattern of murder in American society , said Albert Cardarelli , professor of criminology at the University of Massachusetts , Boston , and a specialist on unsolved killings . These murders often are gratuitously violent , he said , with gunmen pulling_off a successful robbery and killing cooperative victims for no reason . * About 9 p.m. on Feb . 12 , 1992 , Hipolito ( Junior ) Villalobos , 16 , was walking home_in Baldwin Park with three new high_school friends , all alleged gang members , when gunmen jumped from a passing car and chased down the group . The youth was felled by six gunshots to the head and upper torso . Villalobos ' three companions , who faced the same gunmen just steps away , told police they couldn ' t describe the car or the shooters -- even after witnesses and anonymous tips pointed to possible suspects . &quot; There ' s nothing we can do ( to the companions ) , &quot; Baldwin Park Police Det . David Reynoso said . &quot; We can interview them until we ' re blue in the face , but if they don ' t want to tell us , they don ' t want to tell us. &quot; Silence is a common obstacle in gang-related slayings , swelling the number of unsolved homicides in cities such_as Baldwin Park , Pomona and Pasadena , where gang killings account_for one-third to half of all murders . Fear of retribution keeps most witnesses quiet in gang-related slayings , Reynoso said . Threats of physical harm and death -- mere words a_few years ago -- are now backed_up by violence from gang members . Many gang members observe the unwritten credo that they will pay_back the death of a fallen comrade . Thus , they remain silent before police or prosecutors , Reynoso said . Gang slayings usually provide little in the way of hard evidence . The weapon , if recovered , often can ' t be traced to the shooter because it has changed hands multiple times , Reynoso said . Family members of Junior Villalobos understand the fear that keeps witnesses quiet . &quot; They ' re scared , &quot; said Maria Rodriguez , his aunt . &quot; Would you talk ? &quot; * At noon on June 17 , longtime United Farm_Workers union activist Artemisa Guerrero , 68 , was found stabbed to death in her Monterey Park apartment . Her attacker broke_in through a back window , sexually assaulted her , stabbed her to death and ransacked her apartment before fleeing . Neighbors , many of them elderly , said they heard nothing , saw no one . Guerrero , a generous , giving and politically active woman , knew scores of people . Sheriff ' s homicide Detective Bob Tauson has searched futilely for a possible motive and suspect . The case also poses problems because Guerrero was among the vulnerable -- the elderly and the ethnic , populations with higher rates of unsolved murders , according to Cardarelli ' s research . Asian , Spanish-speaking or Eastern European immigrants may_not be able to even speak_to police to provide basic information . And negative experiences with corrupt or antagonistic police in their own countries may make them fear officers here . Among the elderly , the obstacles to solving homicides are physical . Witnesses often are other elderly people , the victim ' s roommates or neighbors . Oftentimes , such witnesses have poor hearing , eyesight and memories that make them unreliable , police said . Medication taken by the elderly can increase their unreliability . For Guerrero ' s family , the lack of an arrest keeps them in permanent mourning . &quot; It ' s an issue that ' s never closed . . . like a wound that keeps_on breaking_open , &quot; said Andy Apodaca , Guerrero ' s son-in-law . * On the afternoon of Nov . 12 , 1992 , Pomona police made a grisly find : the charred remains of an unidentified man with a bashed skull , his body dumped in the flood_control channel near Kellogg Park in Pomona . Fingerprinting proved useless . Only one clue remained -- the letters &quot; stelum &quot; on his blackened leather belt . Twelve days later , a breakthrough . Jose Arturo Gastelum , 35 , a Mexican living in San Diego County , had been staying_at the Shilo Inn in Pomona until his disappearance Nov . 9 . The case ultimately led to Mexico , where Gastelum may have been a currency courier in the drug trade , said Pomona Police Lt . Ron Frazier . Typically , he said , couriers pick_up cash from drug sales here and take it back for laundering in Mexico . Gastelum may have been skimming . His execution may have been meant to send a message , Frazier said . But police still lack hard evidence and a suspect , he said . * Gastelum ' s murder typifies the difficulties in &quot; body dump &quot; homicides . Bodies without identification are found miles and days away from the actual crime scene and time . Such a find stalls the investigation until the authorities identify the dead_person . &quot; Without knowing who the victim is , it just about shuts you out , &quot; said Sheriff ' s Lt . Frank Merriman . &quot; There ' s absolutely nowhere to go. &quot; The number of such cases appears to be growing in part because of increased drug trafficking , investigators say . In Los Angeles County , detectives have found so many bodies of drug_traffickers from an eastern coastal state in Mexico that they call such victims &quot; Sinaloa Cowboys. &quot; In the San Gabriel Valley , the Angeles National Forest , the Whittier Narrows Recreation Area and the Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area provide plenty of isolated acreage for such dumps . Beatrice Gastelum , 41 , said she thinks her husband of 17 years was killed for &quot; business reasons. &quot; But she insists his business was selling U.S.-purchased auto parts in Tijuana , not carrying money . The death has shaken her 17-year-old son , Arturo Jr . &quot; He doesn ' t want to study and he can ' t regain his peace_of_mind , &quot; she said . * The job of solving these homicides has become even more difficult because of two significant changes , criminologists and investigators said : the withering informant network and the mass departure of veteran homicide detectives . One veteran detective said he used to call_on 25 to 30 informants -- prostitutes , loan_sharks , veteran gang members and bikers . Now &quot; if you have half_a_dozen informants , that ' s a lot , &quot; he said . Decreasing incentives are largely responsible . Illicit drug wealth has far overshadowed the petty_cash or minor legal help offered by detectives in exchange for information . Some gang members have enough money to hire top-notch attorneys ; others do a turnaround and offer detectives money . One investigator recalled a drug dealer who had information about a slaying but refused to divulge what he knew . He tried to end detectives ' questions by offering $ 1.2 million in cash and a boxful of automobile pink_slips from which to choose a Mercedes Benz or BMW ; instead he was convicted of attempted bribery . * Gang members who could turn_into informants also remain silent , knowing that if called to testify in court , they could be killed in retribution , police said . Finally , many younger investigators avoid gathering informants for fear the association could harm their careers . &quot; Informants are not very nice people -- they ' re crooks , &quot; one detective said . The informant-police relationship often includes dining and drinking with informants , giving them home phone_numbers , helping their families , looking the other way at their petty crimes and doing them small favors , all_in exchange for information . With the internal scrutiny police undergo nowadays , younger detectives prefer to avoid such contact , said criminologist Cardarelli . Another reason homicide solve rates are decreasing is that older , experienced detectives , hired in the big-budget days of the 1960s and 1970s , are rtiring , police and criminologists say . &quot; We ' re going through a period of losing a lot of very experienced detectives , &quot; said Sheriff ' s Lt . Merriman , whose detectives often aid the smaller San Gabriel Valley cities in homicide investigations . &quot; All those people starting to leave are taking with them 30 years of experience. &quot; Their ranks are increasingly being filled by ambitious officers who see homicide bureaus not as a life goal , but as good resume material , said veteran detectives and criminologists . * &quot; My career goal is to be a cop . Their career goal is to be an administrator , &quot; said an older detective of his younger colleagues . &quot; Homicide ( bureau ) was a goal in and of itself . . . Now it ' s a steppingstone. &quot; In addition , the federal_government ' s war on drugs has siphoned_off younger people who typically work patrol and advance to homicide bureaus . With investigative jobs available in the Drug Enforcement Administration , U.S. Customs , the federal bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , and the Inspector_General ' s office , the grind of beat policing can be avoided with a shortcut to a detective ' s job , said Robert Lorinskas , an associate_professor at the Center for the Study of Crime , Delinquency and Corrections at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale , Mo . * Given the tougher crimes , the shrinking number of informants and the departure of veteran detectives , the unsolved homicide rate is likely to remain the same for the next few years , say police and criminologists . Meanwhile , homicide detectives say their unsolved cases eat_at them daily . They continue to plug_away at them in between their new investigations . &quot; I still ask about this case , &quot; Parrott said of the Chiu murder . &quot; It ' s an active and open case . . . I ' ve had cases solved five and seven years after the fact with someone coming_forward with one little bit of information that finished it . &quot; I don ' t ever give up. &quot; Case Closed Homicides cleared by arrests for San Gabriel Valley cities , 1983 and 1992 . 1983 04 # 22 , 11 # 11 , 09 Number of Homicides Percent City homicides cleared cleared Alhambra 5 2 40 % Arcadia 1 1 100 % Azusa 4 2 50 % Baldwin Park 12 6 50 % Bradbury N / A N / A City of Industry 1 1 100 % Claremont N / A N / A Covina 1 1 100 % Diamond Bar N / A N / A N / A Duarte N / A N / A El Monte 11 5 45 % Glendora N / A N / A Irwindale 2 % La Canada Flintridge N / A N / A La Puente 5 3 60 % La Verne N / A N / A Monrovia 1 50 % Monterey Park 1 2 * 100 % Pasadena 15 15 100 % Pomona 15 14 93 % Rosemead 5 3 60 % San Dimas 1 % San Gabriel 4 2 50 % San Marino N / A N / A Sierra Madre N / A N / A South El Monte 2 2 100 % South Pasadena 1 1 100 % Temple City 1 % Walnut 1 1 100 % West Covina 6 4 66 % Totals 95 65 68 % * 1992 04 # 22 , 11 # 11 , 09 Number of Homicides Percent City homicides cleared cleared Alhambra 7 5 71 % Arcadia 2 % Azusa 1 % Baldwin Park 12 4 33 % Bradbury 1 % City of Industry 3 % Claremont N / A N / A Covina 2 1 50 % Diamond Bar N / A N / A Duarte 4 % El Monte 17 11 65 % Glendora 1 1 100 % Irwindale 2 1 50 % La Canada Flintridge N / A N / A La Puente 13 3 23 % La Verne N / A N / A Monrovia 1 1 100 % Monterey Park 2 2 100 % Pasadena 21 12 57 % Pomona 36 15 42 % Rosemead 9 3 33 % San Dimas N / A N / A San Gabriel1 % San Marino N / A N / A Sierra Madre N / A N / A South El Monte 4 1 25 % South Pasadena N / A N / A Temple City 1 1 100 % Walnut 1 1 100 % West Covina 4 6 * 100 % Totals 145 68 47 % * Note : The number of cleared homicides can include arrests for homicides from previous years .
