   <HEADLINE> NOTHING NEW UNDER SUN -- OR WATER ; HAWAII HAS HAD SHARK ATTACKS AS LONG AS SURFERS HAVE BRAVED THE WAVES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shark attacks are nothing new in Hawaii . Tiger_sharks have been tangling_with wave riders for as long as anyone can recall . George Balazs , a National Marine Fisheries Service biologist and sea_turtle expert , using several sources , has compiled a list of more_than 100 attacks -- most of them on surfers -- dating to 1779 , when a young male was gashed on the buttocks after being pursued while surfing . He later suffered &quot; great pain &quot; and died . In 1828 , &quot; A man out riding surf ( off Maui ) was killed by a shark which bit off his limbs and left his body floating. &quot; The attack was reportedly witnessed by several Hawaiian chiefs . In 1904 , partial remains of a swimmer who had disappeared off Diamond Head were found inside a &quot; monstrous shark. &quot; The body &quot; was complete from the waist down with the exception of one leg. &quot; Also found in the stomach were ducks , tin_cans and wood . In 1931 , a Lt . Williamson had harpooned a 10-foot tiger_shark off Pearl_Harbor , and while he was using a gaff to bring it aboard , the shark bit off the tips of his fingers and chewed the two-inch oak pole of the gaff in half . In the shark ' s stomach were &quot; the hind_leg of a mule , two bathing_suits nearly digested , a soldier ' s belt_buckle , a pint of buttons , two horse shoes , the corner of a wooden soap box , an anchor_chain , two small anchors and assorted bolts , nails and copper fittings. &quot; In 1960 , Harold Riley was swept to sea while net fishing off Maile Point , Oahu . A 20-foot shark was observed attacking the victim . In 1976 , Danson Nakima apparently passed_out while diving for coral at 180 feet . About 30 large sharks were observed attacking the victim . In 1980 , Mark Skidgel was lying on his bodyboard off Lahaina , Maui , when a 14-foot tiger_shark bit him on the left side of his body . The wound required 52 stitches . The list goes_on . And chances are , it will continue to grow . The average is is up_to about four attacks a year , due more to an increase in the human population than to an increase in sharks , some experts say . But it is an alarming statistic nonetheless for those who paddle out_to the offshore reefs on almost a daily basis . Also alarming , some might think , is a recent increase in green sea_turtles around the Hawaiian islands . The turtles , which feed_on algae in and slightly beyond the surf zone , were protected as a federally &quot; threatened &quot; species in 1976 . &quot; It may be that ( the sharks ) are learning now , with more turtles here , to concentrate their feeding on turtles , which would put them into close proximity to surfers , &quot; said John Naughton , a NMFS biologist based in Honolulu . &quot; I can ' t say that is the case , but in the 1960s there was roughly a 20 % occurrence of turtles in the stomach contents ( of tiger_sharks ) , and now we ' re seeing a 42 % occurrence , which would make_sense because turtles are more abundant than they were in the ' 60s. &quot; Surfers have voiced a concern that tiger_sharks might be mistaking them for turtles , which would help explain the rash of attacks -- three confirmed -- and sightings last winter at the North Shore . Balazs discounted that theory , claiming there is &quot; no credible evidence &quot; to support it . But there is no disputing that turtles often swim near the surface , and tiger_sharks often attack floating objects . Said Naughton : &quot; I don ' t think they mistake people for turtles . I think they just happen to be in there looking_for turtles and they see something moving_up there and they just whack it . They don ' t care what it is . They ' ll eat anything . &quot; PETE THOMAS</TEXT>
