   <HEADLINE> MYSTERY OF KOREAN_WAR ' S SECRET AIR_FORCE MISSION IS UNRAVELED ; MILITARY : RELATIVES SAY THEY FINALLY HAVE PIECED TOGETHER HOW A U.S. SPY PLANE AND ITS CREW_MEMBERS WERE SHOT DOWN IN 1950 BY THE SOVIETS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Dec . 5 , 1950 , the day after Capt . Charles E . McDonough was shot down in his Korean_War spy plane , an Air_Force telegram arrived in Glen Rose , Tex . With official regret and a note of haunting finality , it informed his wife , Mary Jo , that the plane had disappeared . &quot; All possible search completed , &quot; it said . He was gone , silently swallowed_up in a war that would keep many grim secrets . The search , though , was anything but completed . In a sense , it had not yet begun . Nearly 44 years after the Air_Force gave_up on McDonough and the three other Americans aboard his silvery RB-45 reconnaissance bomber , new information has come_to_light -- evidence that points to Soviet involvement not only in the shoot_down but also in exploiting McDonough after his capture . The evidence , not yet publicly disclosed by the U.S._government , contradicts recent denials by Moscow that the former Soviet_Union had played any role . The loss of the RB-45 and its crew on Dec . 4 , 1950 , isn ' t even mentioned in the Air_Force ' s official history of the Korean_War , although it notes that two planes of that type flew in the war . ( The unmentioned McDonough plane , tail number 8-015 , made three. ) McDonough , of New London , Conn. , was commander of the three-plane detachment which flew missions mainly over North_Korea from Yokota Air_Base , Japan . At 31 , this was his second war ; he flew bombers in Europe in World_War_II . The RB-45 , well before the U-2 and now an artifact of the Cold_War , was no ordinary plane . It was converted from a jet bomber as the most advanced photo reconnaissance plane in the world , and this was its first wartime use . The Air_Force knew the RB-45 was a target of Soviet intelligence . Moscow was aware that U.S. Air_Force planes were overflying its territory throughout the 1950s , but it didn ' t become an international issue until the Soviets shot down Francis Gary Powers in a CIA-operated U-2 spy plane on May 1 , 1960 . This story of the RB-45 is based on interviews with relatives of two of the four crewmen , officers who knew them , and retired Korean_War RB-45 pilots , as well as declassified war records and other government documents . It is the first published account of what the Air_Force called simply a &quot; mission over enemy territory. &quot; Leading the effort to unravel the case are Jeanne Dear , the only child of Charles and Mary Jo McDonough , and Nancy Dean , the daughter of Col . John R . Lovell , a top Air_Force intelligence_officer who was based at the Pentagon but happened to be aboard the plane for reasons that may never be fully known . Dear , 44 , of Ft . Worth , was 6 months old at the time . Because she never knew her father , she says , the pain of sifting through his past doesn ' t sting as badly . But her voice makes clear that the emotional armor she wears is not impenetrable . &quot; It ' s hard , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s a commitment I feel to my mother. &quot; For her and Dean the search has been complicated by the secret nature of the RB-45 . Although never officially acknowledged by Washington , men who flew this plane in Korea say their top-secret missions sometimes took them deep into Chinese and Soviet airspace . More routinely , it flew photo reconnaissance over North_Korea . Records that could shed_light_on McDonough ' s mission that fateful day have not been found . Louis Carrington of Tyler , Tex. , one of the two other pilots in McDonough ' s unit , recalls that &quot; Mac &quot; and his crew , attired in blue flight suits , took_off into clear skies from Yokota Air_Base at about lunchtime on Dec . 4 . He remembers McDonough , 6-foot-3 and blue-eyed , as a likable , accomplished , robust man . &quot; He could do anything , &quot; Carrington says . The last word from the RB-45 crew was a routine radio contact 100 minutes after takeoff , signaling their entry into North_Korean airspace . Then , everlasting silence . The crash site was never pinpointed . No bodies were recovered . The McDonough and Lovell daughters haven ' t lived_on hope that their fathers are alive . &quot; I can ' t get sucked into the emotional quagmire , &quot; said Dean , 62 , who was a freshman at the College of William and Mary when her father was listed as missing . &quot; My father would not have wanted that. &quot; Yet she ' s convinced there is more to the story than the Air_Force admits . John ( Jack ) Lovell , then 46 , worked directly for the head of Air_Force intelligence , Maj . Gen . Charles P . Cabell . Lovell ' s daughter recently found in the National Archives a declassified report , stamped top secret , that was signed by Cabell and included a proposal for using the RB-45 for reconnaissance over the Soviet_Union . It was dated Oct . 5 , 1950 . Lovell ' s presence on the plane is a mystery . He was not a regular crew_member , but Dean believes Lovell had a hand in overseeing the RB-45 ' s spy role . Howard Barkey , who worked with Lovell in Army intelligence during World_War_II , says an officer with as much knowledge of secret U.S. war plans as Lovell normally would not be allowed to fly over enemy-held territory . &quot; He was a leader , and the qualities of leadership require sometimes taking risks , &quot; Barkey said . He figures Lovell had responsibility for the RB-45 program and therefore wanted to see firsthand what risks its crews were facing . Dean recalls helping her father pack his bags on Nov . 23 , Thanksgiving_Day . He left that night , saying only that he was headed to the Far East . Since then there have been only two hints of his fate : * His name was mentioned in an &quot; enemy broadcast &quot; picked_up by U.S. intelligence in China on May 21 , 1951 , which suggested he had been captured in Korea . * His was among 71 names of Americans listed by the U.S. Far East Command as &quot; men positively identified as remaining in the hands of the Communists &quot; after the final exchange of Allied and Communist POWs in September , 1953 . Yet he never was officially listed as a POW . Dean recently obtained the list from a declassified Dec . 14 , 1954 , report in the files of the U.S. Far East Command . Nearly a year earlier , on Feb . 28 , 1954 , the government had declared Lovell dead . He was from Ottumwa , Iowa , a graduate of West_Point ( class of ' 27 ) , a former U.S. Olympic boxing team coach and a veteran of Cold_War espionage . The two other men on board were co-pilot Capt . Jules E . Young , 29 , of East Rochester , N.Y. , and 1st Lt . James J . Picucci , 32 , of New York City , the navigator . When the daughters of Lovell and McDonough started researching the incident in detail in 1992 , both were surprised to learn that many records from that period are lost ; many are still classified secret , off-limits to most citizens . Dear began her quest in_earnest in 1992 when , at the prodding of an aunt , she called the Air_Force casualty office at Randolph Air_Force Base , Tex. , to ask_for the file on her father . Her family had been told before that his service records had burned in a records center fire in St . Louis in the 1970s , but this time the casualty official said she would check and call_back . The return call was a bombshell : Her father ' s name was_on a list of U.S. airmen provided by the Russian government . &quot; I was absolutely stunned , &quot; Dear recalls . But no one could tell her what the list was , whether she should think her father had been taken by the Russians . &quot; They didn ' t have a clue , &quot; she said . The Russian list indicates that McDonough and other U.S. POWs were interrogated by Soviet officers . Indeed , the Russians later released a copy of a McDonough interrogation which says a Soviet &quot; prepared the questions &quot; and &quot; a Chinese comrade translated &quot; the answers . Still , Moscow denies it ever had contact with the RB-45 crew . Dear began digging . She attended congressional hearings in Washington and searched Air_Force archives at Maxwell Air_Force Base , Ala. , and at the National Archives in Washington and Suitland , Md . She pored over historical_records at the Air_Force_Academy in Colorado Springs , Colo. , collected books on the Korean_War and the Air_Force , and tracked_down anyone who might be of help . She found Nancy Dean , who coincidentally had begun her own research . Dean , helped by her husband , Dick , fired off letters , organized documents and plotted her search strategy from a basement &quot; war room &quot; in her Wheaton , Md. , home . Many questions about the RB-45 case went unanswered in the years after the last American POWs returned from Korea , but the one that mattered most to each crew_member ' s family was : Did he , in fact , die ? Mary Jo McDonough stayed in Glen Rose after her husband was listed as missing . She never changed houses , never married again . But she didn ' t wait idly . She sought_out her husband ' s colleagues when they returned after the war . She wrote to families of other missing airmen and urged them to press for a full accounting . In a letter to President Dwight D . Eisenhower on Jan . 5 , 1954 , Mrs . McDonough wrote , &quot; This matter is more important to me and to the thousands in my position than anything else . And we ' re not going_to forget it. &quot; She got no answers . Hope wore_away with the passage of time . Then , thanks to her daughter ' s persistence , and quite apart from the government ' s own efforts , an answer came_in October , 1993 : McDonough died about two weeks after his plane was shot down . Not all details are known , and the body has not been recovered . &quot; My mother had been waiting for 40 years , &quot; Jeanne Dear said . &quot; For us it ' s like a miracle &quot; to know for_sure he died , and to complete their grieving . She plans a memorial service for her father today in Ft . Worth . Of the hundreds of relatives of Korean_War MIAs , she apparently is the first to have confirmed a death through her own research and a network of contacts in the United States and abroad . Ironically , the clinching evidence came not from U.S._government files but from Russia , whose MIG fighters shot down McDonough ' s plane near the Yalu_River that separates North_Korea from China . McDonough parachuted from the plane . The one-page document which said McDonough had died was found in Russian archives by Paul Cole of the research firm Defense Forecasts Inc. , who has extensively studied Soviet links to Korean_War MIA cases . Dear got a copy . It was dated Dec . 18 , 1950 -- exactly two weeks after the shoot_down -- but did not indicate the exact date or cause of death . Routing notations on the document indicate it circulated at the highest levels of the Soviet military staff . &quot; I am informing you that the pilot from the shot-down B-45 aircraft died en route and the interrogation was not finished , &quot; said the note in Russian . It was signed by Marshal Stepan Krasovskii , the senior Soviet military adviser to China , and addressed to Marshal Pavel Batitskii , chief of the General_Staff in Moscow . This fits with recollections of the only American known to have talked to McDonough after he was shot down . Retired Air_Force pilot Hamilton B . Shawe Jr. , of Reno , Nev. , said he spent about three days with McDonough as a POW in a bombed-out prison in Sinuiju , in northern Korea , starting about Dec . 14 . He says he last saw McDonough being taken_away from the prison on an ox cart , and that he was in such bad_condition that it seemed unlikely he could live much longer . Shawe said McDonough told him he had parachuted from the burning wreckage of the RB-45 . He later suffered severe frostbite while trying to evade capture in the frozen wilds . When he sought food at an isolated Korean house , the occupants turned him in to the military . Shawe reported his contact with McDonough to the Air_Force in 1953 when he was released from captivity . On the basis of his information , and the lack of other news , the Air_Force issued a presumptive finding of death on March 1 , 1954 . Although the McDonough family members accept the Russian document as evidence that he died , they realize it raises other questions . Where were they taking him when he died ? What did the Soviets want from him ? What was done with the body ? A second Russian document obtained by Cole this year makes the Soviet link even clearer . It says the RB-45 was shot down about 45 miles east of Andung , China , just across the border from Sinuiju , North_Korea . The report summarizes what McDonough said under a Soviet-controlled interrogation and asks that Russian &quot; advisers &quot; in Korea help retrieve downed American aircraft and &quot; details. &quot; This document was dated Dec . 17 , 1950 , and was signed by the Soviet commander of the 64th Fighter Aviation Corps , which headed Soviet air operations in Korea . The note was addressed to top military_officers in the Kremlin . In November , 1994 , Dear learned more painful details through a confidential source who interviewed the MIG pilot , A . F . Andrianov , who is credited with shooting_down the RB-45 . Andrianov recalled being told by the Soviet officer who interrogated McDonough that while McDonough was being moved from Sinuiju , apparently on Dec . 18 , a sign was hung_on him , &quot; U.S. War Criminal. &quot; A crowd of North_Koreans gathered around the defiant American and beat him to death , Dear said . For that final injustice , she and her mother hold both the North_Koreans and the former Soviet_Union responsible . Because Andrianov said he saw only one parachute emerge from the RB-45 , Nancy Dean now accepts that her father , Lovell the intelligence_officer , died in the crash . Her search , too , is ended , though she still wonders why her father was there . Whether or not the mystery of the RB-45 is ever fully unraveled , Mary Jo McDonough will always remember the good_days before her husband left for Korea , and wonder about a cryptic departing remark on the sensitivity of his mission . &quot; I remember he said , ' There is something I wish I could tell you , but I can ' t.
