   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 / 45 DAYS AND COUNTING ; A PAINFUL LESSON ; SERIOUS KNEE INJURY IN ' 93 HAS GIVEN U.S. SOCCER STAR BALBOA A NEW PERSPECTIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a misstep , nothing more . An awkwardly placed foot that came_down in an unexpected indentation . At any other time , with any other foot , perhaps the leg and attached body would have traveled on without mishap . Perhaps . But this foot wedged into that hole and didn ' t budge . This body twisted this knee so that the joint ' s stabilizing structure snapped with a loud pop ! that sent an emphatic message to the brain . Marcelo Balboa had processed the message before he hit the grassy ground , before his teammates had rushed to him , before his mother in the the stands had begun to sob . It was not one of those cinematic moments , he said , in which your life passes before your eyes . It was much worse . Balboa saw his long-nurtured soccer career pass before him and keep_on moving , as if it cared not a whit that he wasn ' t able to stand and follow it . Balboa learned much as he lay crumpled on that soccer field , while trainers and doctors tested and waggled his limp knee into crazy angles . He discovered that it is possible to love something and for that thing to be indifferent to your love . He learned that his ardent love was not enough , and not enough even when tempered with respect . Marcelo Balboa ' s lesson was this : Learn to be grateful . * Who would care to be a cliche ? It is not flattering to have your life viewed_as something predictable or common . But the outlook for Marcelo Balboa , pre-April 17 , 1993 , was typical of that of most athletes , even professional ones . He could perform any daring stunt without fear . He was certain that his body would do whatever he asked of it . It always had , always would . He had meant to study harder in high_school , but there were so many sports to play . He had intended to graduate from college , but he was offered a great opportunity to play soccer . He wanted to develop outside interests , but when he wasn ' t at practice he was so tired . For Balboa , life was something to do when you can ' t play soccer . His life was one-dimensional , but he knew it and didn ' t care . Balboa had played in the 1990 World Cup_finals . He had played more minutes with the national team than any other American for the last two years . He was a key figure on the team and was_on course to play in this summer ' s World Cup . How many Americans can say that ? They were paying him to play soccer . Life was good . That was pretty much Balboa ' s psychological landscape before his right foot found that recess made by a long-erased football yard line . In that otherwise forgettable game -- the U.S. national team against Iceland -- Balboa ' s world changed because his ability to play soccer was taken from him . The snapping sound his teammates heard was the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee tearing under stress . Also found was a partial tear of the medial lateral meniscus cartilage . After Balboa was taken_off the field and given the initial injury assessment , after the team ' s doctor and trainers had returned to the game , Balboa went_to the showers and cried . &quot; It hit me big_time , &quot; he said the other day . &quot; Everything I had worked so hard to get_up to that point was gone . I was the player of the year in 1992 and everything had been going so well for me . I was just starting to play well in the beginning of ' 93 . All I saw when I was in the shower and I was crying was the World Cup go_by and I would n ' t be there . &quot; Everything I had worked for went_by me . As a soccer player , everything you work for is the World Cup . Great , I played in 1990 . But I saw 1994 going_by without me and that really hurt . I didn ' t want that to happen. &quot; That was_on a Saturday . Sunday morning , Balboa had an MRI test of his knee . The next day Dr. Bert Mandelbaum confirmed what Balboa had feared : he would have surgery immediately and the usual recovery period was 9-12 months . Balboa , though , did not accept the time frame the doctors gave him . Everything would have to be accelerated , he said . He wanted the surgery immediately , then an aggressive rehab program . He got what he asked_for . After the operation , Balboa went_to his apartment in Laguna Nigel . For six hours a day a passive-motion device attached_to his right leg mechanically bent and straightened it to improve his range of motion . A plastic sleeve around his knee circulated cold water to keep swelling down . Two surgically implanted tubes drained pooling blood from the knee . On the fourth day after surgery , the physical_therapy began . After seven days , the stitches came_out . For the next four weeks , Balboa was fitted with a hip-to-ankle brace that was so constricting it allowed him to sleep only on his back , fitfully . The pain was one thing , but the work involved in rehab was quite another . For an athlete who thought he was tough , this was a revelation . &quot; I ' ve always heard people say , ' You have to ride the bike , you have to do this for rehab , ' &quot; Balboa said . &quot; The first thing Dr. Mandelbaum said after surgery is , ' We ' re going to put you on a real aggressive program. ' I ' m like , ' Oh , all_right . No big deal. ' I go_to the therapist . He gets me on the table and we start doing ( range of motion ) patterns with his hands . I did about five of them and I couldn ' t do any more . It was absolute pain . &quot; I was thinking to myself , ' This is going_to be tougher than I thought. ' Then ( the therapist ) said , ' Today is nothing . Wait until we get the stitches out. ' As we went_on day by day , it would get harder and harder and longer and longer . I never realized what kind of effort I ' d have to give. &quot; The surprise was even greater because Balboa ' s best_friend on the team , Fernando Clavijo , had already gone_through a similar rehab on a knee and told him it wasn ' t so bad . The second week into rehab Balboa confronted Clavijo with his friend ' s light assessment of the work required and Clavijo simply laughed . &quot; I lied to you , &quot; he said . * Balboa is 26 , but he was quite young when he realized his father ' s soccer skills had passed directly to his older brother , Claudio . Balboa ' s strategy was to run and run . He figured that fitness would compensate for a lack of natural ease with the ball . Luis Balboa coached his sons until they were_well into their teens . He had played professional soccer in Argentina , then as a defensive midfielder for the Chicago Mustangs of the now-defunct North_American Professional Soccer League . Claudio and Marcelo would join their father every Sunday to watch Spanish-language soccer telecasts . They played in a youth soccer league in Cerritos . They grew_up with soccer , but they also played water_polo , football , baseball , whatever sport was in season . Luis made Marcelo choose . Too_much time spent on sports and not enough time on schoolwork , he told his son . The boy ' s grades were not good , even though he was smart . You may play a sport , but not four or five , the father said . Marcelo chose soccer and football . He became a star . &quot; By the end of high_school , I had offers to go_to the best schools , but I didn ' t have the grades , &quot; Balboa said . &quot; I was lazy . I didn ' t want to do the work . I realized that when I wanted to go_to college and I couldn ' t go where I wanted to go. &quot; Instead he went_to junior_college and played with the national under-20 team . He transferred to San Diego State , where his fame as a talented defender was equaled by his reputation as a private person whose interests extended_to soccer , period . That focus was about to be tested . &quot; In high_school , I didn ' t go_to one party , &quot; Balboa said . &quot; I wasn ' t interested in the drinking . I didn ' t get_into that until college . San Diego State was a party team . I got involved in that and I didn ' t like it . I didn ' t want to be part of a team that was known for drinking. &quot; Then Bob Gansler called and asked if he would like to play full time for the U.S. national team that was trying to qualify for the 1990 World Cup . * When soccer was taken_away from him , Balboa was left with no outlet for his competitive drive . Physical_therapy became a substitute for soccer . &quot; Anyone who puts_in six hours a day , seven days a week for five months with no complaints and no setbacks . . . that says a little about that person , &quot; said Rudy Rudawsky , the U.S. team trainer . &quot; He came_to every practice . Every practice . He didn ' t have to . He could have dropped_off . He never did. &quot; Balboa listened to the therapist ' s predictions about when he would return , but in his mind he subtracted two months from each estimate . When they said he would be running in six months and practicing again in eight , he figured he would be running in four months and practicing in six . To accomplish this , Balboa extended himself . He was told to do X , and he did X + . When Balboa was cleared to ride a mountain_bike , Rudawsky shepherded Balboa and Clavijo through the_hills of Laguna Nigel . As the players raced downhill ahead of him , Rudawsky didn ' t see Balboa fly off his bike and cut his right knee . Balboa had made_sure the trainer stayed to his left . He also insisted in maintaining his routine , as if it might make the injury go_away . That meant sleeping , as usual , in his bedroom on the second floor . No one saw the many times he missed a step and slipped , or was there the night he fell_down the entire flight of stairs and lay for many minutes , still and in the dark , afraid to move . His family watched as Balboa struggled to recover . On Friday nights , his mother came_over and stayed until Sunday , cooking and helping as much as his pride would allow . His father -- who had never been injured in his career -- was awed by his son ' s dedication . &quot; To our family , soccer is our love , &quot; Luis Balboa said . &quot; But if Marcelo hadn ' t played , it would n ' t have changed anything . We are so proud . Even as a father , I was impressed with how hard he worked to rehabilitate his knee. &quot; He returned to action with the team on Dec . 5 , 1993 , playing for a_few minutes in a game against El_Salvador . Balboa came_on as a substitute and immediately began running_around with no apparent plan . He took a shot the instant it presented itself . &quot; I was like a puppy , &quot; he said . &quot; I was so happy to be out there . I was going_to go_out there and run and have fun again. &quot; Now that he ' s back as the team ' s full-time sweeper , Balboa is doing what he used to do , but with a new outlook . &quot; I learned a lot about myself , &quot; he said . &quot; The whole_thing made me realize that I had to look_after soccer and what was going_to happen to me . Since 1988 , when I started with the team , I never thought_about anything but soccer . I was going_to school , I knew I was getting an education , but I didn ' t really think_about it . Once I got hurt , I kept_on thinking , ' What happens if I can ' t come_back and play soccer ? What am I going_to do ? ' &quot; that ' s when I realized there ' s more to life than playing soccer . There ' s other things I want to do . I want to go_back and finish my degree . It ' s very important to me now . &quot; You take things for granted when you ' re healthy . Between practices , I used to sit in the house and watch TV . I would n ' t do much . You realize you have to go_out and enjoy life . I was kind of letting life roll by me . I was playing soccer , coming home and relaxing . Now I go_to movies , play golf , jet ski . It wakes you up . It ' s like a reality check . You see what your life was and now you see what it ' s like without soccer . Let me tell you , at that point my life looked pretty bleak without soccer. &quot; Player Profile * Name : Marcelo Luis Balboa * Birth date : Aug . 8 , 1967 * Place : Chicago * Height : 6 feet 1 * Weight : 170 pounds * Position : Defender ( sweeper ) * Club : U.S. national team * Debut with national team : Jan . 10 , 1988 * Debut opponent : Guatemala * Caps ( international matches ) : 86 * Goals : 9 * Little known fact : Highest scoring defender in U.S. history * Honors : 1992 U.S. male soccer athlete of the year ; played in all three U.S. games in 1990 World Cup</TEXT>
