   <HEADLINE> IT ' S NOT A TABOO TOPIC IN SOME SCHOOLS ; SEX EDUCATION : DESPITE THE CONTROVERSY OVER JOYCELYN ELDERS , SOME TEACHERS ALREADY TALK ABOUT MASTURBATION . AND ABSTINENCE . AND ABORTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Maybe Joycelyn Elders should have come_to California before she opened her mouth . The surgeon_general was fired earlier this month , ostensibly because she said masturbation is &quot; something that perhaps should be taught &quot; in schools . In California , it often is . State guidelines for sex education suggest that teachers talk_about masturbation &quot; in such a way as_to dispel common myths associated with it . . . sterility , blindness , or feeble-mindedness. &quot; It is one of the more controversial subjects students are exposed to when they go_to sex education class in some Southern California schools these days . The courses cover everything from abstinence to zygotes . At some schools there are lectures about abortion , condoms and relationships . Under state law , however , public_schools must stress abstinence as the best defense against HIV , pregnancy and tangled relations . &quot; Abstinence , &quot; says a Laguna Beach middle-school teacher , &quot; is the first and foremost thing we teach. &quot; The state guidelines are optional , but many schools in Southern California deal with masturbation because students ask about it . And the answer is often that masturbation is normal -- and it won ' t kill you . But educators stop short of including masturbation as part of the formal curriculum -- or encouraging it as a form of abstinence . &quot; There is no physical harm , but there should be no judgment about it really , &quot; says Ruth Rich , health adviser at the Los Angeles Unified School District . Instead of lurid talk or scare-charged black-and-white reels , sex ed today is a journey into biology , chemistry and illustrations of human innards . At Walter Reed Middle_School in North Hollywood , seventh-graders recently reiterated the rules of sex ed class : &quot; There ' s no dumb question , &quot; says one . &quot; Use scientific terms instead of slang , &quot; says another . Teacher Cathy Golliher , who helped write the districtwide guidelines for sex ed , adds another rule : &quot; We ' re going to stay_away_from the personal level. &quot; According to SIECUS , the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States , 47 states require or recommend sex education . And at least 10 states , SIECUS says , have guidelines asking schools to address masturbation during sex education . In Santa Monica , the private Crossroads School for Arts and Sciences teaches older students about masturbation ( &quot; that it ' s not going_to kill them and that most people do_it , &quot; an administrator says ) , homosexuality and intimate relationships . &quot; We do_it all , &quot; says Tom Nolan , dean of students . &quot; We encourage kids to wait , but we also teach contraception. &quot; * Several middle_schools across Southern California are home to ENABL ( Education Now and Babies Later ) , a state-funded class for seventh-graders that includes role-playing aimed to deflate sexual peer pressure . &quot; Postponing sexual involvement is really the intent , &quot; says Gail Sass Buckley , head of a pregnancy counseling center charged with teaching ENABL classes in Los Angeles . Many sex education programs in Southern California are part of science , health and modern living courses , and start at the middle-school level , about the time preteens reach puberty . Many -- including those at L.A. city schools -- also require parental consent ; without it , students sit_out the sessions . State guidelines recommend that serious sex talk start somewhere between grades six and nine . In L.A. city schools , birds-and-bees instruction -- including abstinence and contraception -- starts in grade seven with about three weeks ' worth . More instruction comes_in the 10th grade . In the San Diego Unified School District , the eighth-largest in the nation , teachers start talking_about sex to sixth-graders . Girls get the menstruation speech in the fifth . And from then until high_school graduation , students get taught about AIDS for one hour a year . And when sex is the topic from eighth grade on up , San Diego schools don ' t ask parents for permission . &quot; We do not need permission , &quot; says district sex ed expert Marge Kleinsmith . She adds : &quot; All sex ed materials are approved by an advisory committee of parents , educators and physicians. &quot; Proponents of sex education -- many of whom agree with Elders -- say more classroom time is better . Private researcher Marvin Eisen tracked 1 # 500 teen-agers in California and Texas during the late ' 80s and found that the more sex education students had , the more likely they were to abstain or use contraception . &quot; Good sex education programs , &quot; he says , &quot; can have a good effect. &quot; Educators argue that sex education is important in an era when more students are having_sex . According to the Guttmacher Institute , a sexuality research group in New York City , teen birth_rates have stopped growing but are still high . But more_than 1 million teen-agers become pregnant each year -- and those who do have babies are very likely to be poor and unmarried . * Still , educators complain that they don ' t have enough time to teach reproductive basics . The community piles on extra helpings of curricula every year -- from the back-to-basics movement to computer_science -- and sex ed suffers , says Rich of L.A. Unified . &quot; We ' re seeing less and less time for it , &quot; she says . Rich says the district ' s sex education now has to be bolstered by special grants from the state -- grants for special programs such_as ENABL that don ' t reach all_the city ' s schoolchildren . In San Diego , sex ed -- with the exception of elementary_school courses and AIDS education -- was cut two years ago . Now some eighth-graders have a private grant to thank for their sex education . &quot; Much of the cuts are_due to politics , as you ' re well aware , &quot; says San Diego ' s Kleinsmith . At the same time , she argues , &quot; kids are not taking_care of themselves. &quot; Some say schools should stay out of sex ed . &quot; Religion , sex education -- all these controversial things should be taught by the mom and dad , &quot; says Susan Carpenter McMillan , president of a conservative group called the Woman ' s Coalition . &quot; Masturbation is for mommy and daddy to teach about. &quot; But experts say parents don ' t like sex talk . &quot; If parents talked to kids , then these issues would n ' t be so powerful and their kids would be getting the message they want and they would n ' t have to go_to school to get_it , &quot; says psychologist Gail L . Zellman , a youth specialist at Rand , the Santa Monica research institute . She says the reason sex in schools is such a controversial topic -- why surgeon_generals get fired and school_boards get booted -- is that &quot; we ' re a culture that ' s based in puritanical precepts with the belief that we should keep our feelings in check. &quot;</TEXT>
