   <HEADLINE> SIMPSON TEAM GIVEN RIGHT TO POLICE PAPERS ; TRIAL : ITO ORDERS VOLUMES OF RECORDS AND PHOTOS ON ACTIVITY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CASE TURNED_OVER TO THE DEFENSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seeking to end a running battle in the O.J. Simpson murder trial , Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito has ordered police and prosecutors to turn_over to the defense volumes of paperwork detailing police activity at the outset of the double murder case , according to court papers released Tuesday . Among the items to be given to defense_lawyers are photographs of the shoes that law_enforcement workers wore at the murder scene , where bloody shoe prints were found . The defense also wants results of any preliminary blood_tests done on the shoes of investigators and others who were there . In addition , the judge ordered prosecutors to provide reports from Detective Mark Fuhrman about a 1985 incident in which Fuhrman went_to the Simpson home to investigate a domestic disturbance call . Simpson has pleaded not_guilty to the June 12 slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman , and is being held without bail . He is expected to be in court today for a proceeding at which Ito will hear arguments about which pieces of evidence will be allowed_in court . At that hearing , Ito , who has exhibited increasing impatience with the news media , also will hear defense arguments contending that the judge should question police and members of the prosecution team to determine if they are the source of news leaks . Leaked stories -- some of them false -- prompted Ito on Monday to schedule a Nov . 7 hearing that could result in a ban on the Court TV camera that during pretrial hearings made live film available to the scores of television_news operations that are covering the case . As media organizations gear_up to fight a possible television ban , the Los Angeles Daily News filed court papers Tuesday protesting a decision by Ito to bar the paper from his courtroom during the Simpson trial . The order apparently is in response to the paper ' s publication of a story based on a blank jury questionnaire obtained before the judge officially released the document . Court spokeswoman Jerrianne Hayslett confirmed that Ito has said the San Fernando Valley-based newspaper will get no permanent seat in the courtroom once seating arrangements for the trial are made and that it will not be_on a list of news organizations that will share seats on a rotating basis . Ron Kaye , managing editor of the Daily News , would not comment , saying the court papers speak_for themselves . In its filing , the Daily News asserts that it lawfully obtained the questionnaire , did nothing illegal in the process and is unaware that anyone stole the document . Because it did not harm Simpson ' s rights , the paper contends , &quot; there is no basis in law or fact for a punitive order barring one reporter from access to parts of the case. &quot; Kelli Sager , a media lawyer who has represented The Times on 1st Amendment issues , said that if the Daily News is right about how it obtained the document , the law is_on its side . &quot; It certainly is true that under the law a news organization cannot be punished for receiving information as long as they didn ' t do anything illegal in getting_it , &quot; she said . Ito , in an interview Monday , said that because he had not publicly released the blank questionnaire , he considered the Daily News ' possession of it a felony theft of a court document . The Daily News complaint is scheduled to be heard Nov . 7 , when Ito also will hear arguments about his proposed ban on the Court TV camera . The judge ' s clerk on Tuesday said letters favoring such a ban are pouring into Ito ' s chamber . The clerk , Deirdre Robertson , said the letters were prompted by a piece by Mike Royko , the Chicago-based syndicated newspaper_columnist , who urged his readers to send the judge their thoughts on a camera ban . &quot; I ' ve gone_through about 1 # 000 ( letters ) and about 90 % are about ( the proposed ban ) , &quot; Robertson said . Of those , most favor throwing_out the television_camera . In another development Tuesday , it was disclosed that Ito has scheduled an Oct . 14 hearing to determine whether items from Simpson ' s Ford Bronco should be disallowed as evidence on the grounds that once police seized the vehicle , they left it unattended at a tow yard , where it was burglarized by an employee of the yard and suffered unaccounted-for damage . The vehicle was towed from outside Simpson ' s home the day after the murders after police found what they thought was a blood droplet on a door handle and a smear of blood on the door . The burglary of the Bronco occurred two days later and was not reported for 26 days , according to court papers . As a result of the incident , the employee was fired and the tow yard lost its police contract . Because of the police handling of the Bronco , Simpson ' s lawyers contend , Ito should not allow into evidence 46 items removed from it in five searches after the burglary . The lawyers argue that no one can be sure those items were in the vehicle when it was towed from the street outside Simpson ' s estate . Dear Judge Ito : Judge Lance A . Ito has received more_than 1 # 000 letters since newspaper_columnist Mike Royko called_for a citizen rebellion against TV coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial . Some excerpts : &quot; Please , please exercise the power you have to cut_off all TV coverage of the O.J. Simpson case . It really serves no good purpose. &quot; Jane F . Finley , Oak Brook , Ill . &quot; We are saturated with it -- TV , radio , newspaper . How much can we take ? P.S. : Our sympathy is with O.J. , guilty or not. &quot; Mr. and Mrs . Zino Bove , Long_Beach &quot; Enough is enough . We are_sick of it . Please use your authority to do this . Many people would be very grateful. &quot; Mary Pike , Downey &quot; Please exclude TV coverage in the O.J. Simpson trial . I feel it is a disgrace to televise such a case or any case for that matter. &quot; Virginia Kenealy , Chicago &quot; Judge Ito ' s To Do List : 1 . Pull the plug on the media . 2 . Impose the gag order . 3 . Sequester jurors for the duration of the trial . 4 . Admit any and all evidence . 5 . Let cameras in only for the verdict. &quot; Unsigned , Los Angeles SOURCE : Associated Press</TEXT>
