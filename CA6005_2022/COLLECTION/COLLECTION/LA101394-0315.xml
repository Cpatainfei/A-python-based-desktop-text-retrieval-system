   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : ' SCUDBUSTER ' SIMULATIONS ARE POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR REALITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No Scud missiles yet in this latest confrontation with Iraq . But they ' re there . . . somewhere . Then again , so is the next generation of Raytheon ' s Patriot antiballistic_missiles . It ' s been three years since these missiles first dueled in the nighttime skies , and Raytheon promises that its new breed of &quot; Scudbusters &quot; is even deadlier . Should Iraqi Scuds be launched against vulnerable U.S. positions , just how much better would these new and improved Patriots do this time around ? What kind of technical breakthroughs do three years of analysis , testing and modification buy_in antiballistic_missile defense ? The ( unclassified ) answers to those questions reveal disturbing realities about innovation in defense technology and the pathology of procurement . &quot; In the Gulf War , we learned things we never expected to learn , &quot; says Stephen R . Stanvick , a vice_president of Raytheon ' s missile systems division and its air_defense program manager . So ever since the end of the war , Raytheon has pursued an Army QRP -- a quick response program -- designed to implement that knowledge . The range of Patriot ' s radar has increased by about 50 % ; the timing sequences of its explosive fuses have been enhanced ; critical targeting software has been improved . A weapons_system that the Army and Raytheon claim enjoyed an anti-Scud success rate of better than 70 % in Saudi_Arabia and more_than 40 % in Israel ( that performance gap is_due to &quot; operational differences &quot; ) has now been &quot; meaningfully improved , &quot; says Stanvick . More precise promises of effectiveness have understandably been classified . Unfortunately , though , assessment of the true performance of the Patriots against the Scuds has been the subject of bitter controversy since the war ' s end . Top Israeli military officials such_as former Defense Minister Moshe Arens have flatly dismissed the Patriot as ineffectual . Careful examination of Army data by the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Research Service cast strong doubts on the success rates claimed for Patriots . The weapon_system ' s sharpest critic , Massachusetts Institute of Technology Prof . Theodore A . Postol , acknowledges that the Patriot QRP &quot; has a number of fixes that go_in the right direction , but we don ' t think these fixes are going_to fix the problems against the al Hussein ( the Iraqi Scuds ) . &quot; In fact , after extensively reviewing available non-classified data , Postol and his fellow critics have concluded that &quot; there are no benefits that are real for deploying Patriots in Israel or Kuwait. &quot; Raytheon , of course , dismisses the criticisms as unfounded -- pointing with confidence to classified information it says validates its Patriots . Putting aside , for the moment , the personal passions and institutional infighting that surround the Patriot , there are some agreed-upon facts that reveal just what the Pentagon and its contractors are -- and are not -- prepared to do to measurably improve its weapons_systems . For example , since the end of the war , neither Raytheon nor the Army has tested its improved Patriots against a real Scud . &quot; We have not flown it against a Scud , &quot; acknowledges Raytheon ' s Stanvick . Raytheon tested the Patriot exactly once last year against a &quot; Storm &quot; missile -- which is an Army-built missile designed to impersonate a Scud . When ' s the next test ? Raytheon ' s not sure . &quot; We are target-poor and waiting for target deliveries , &quot; says Stanvick . But who makes Scuds , and who has turned them into the ballistic_missile of choice for aspiring underdeveloped countries , from Syria to North_Korea to Iraq ? Russia . Who desperately needs hard currency and U.S. technical support ? Russia . If the Pentagon so desired , it could easily spend a_few million dollars to get some Scuds and a technical crew from Russia , ship them to White Sands , and test our ballistic_missile defense technologies against a genuine , real-world missile threat . &quot; I don ' t understand why we didn ' t go_to the Russians and ask them to sell us Scuds after the war , &quot; says Postol . &quot; It ' s reasonable to expect to see all these technology improvements tested against the actual weapons they were designed for. &quot; &quot; They should be doing that ; it ' s a good idea , &quot; agrees John Lehman , who was secretary_of_the_Navy for six years during the Reagan_Administration defense buildup . In fact , in the wake of the success of the_French Exocet missile during the war in the Falklands , Lehman demanded that the Navy test its ship defenses against real Exocets : That data proved exceedingly valuable . Patriot supporters should be similarly inclined , he says . &quot; It seems to me that kind of recommendation from us would be kind of specious , &quot; says Bob Stein , another vice_president of Raytheon ' s missile systems division . &quot; I would n ' t see the value of that . . . . I believe that we ' ve run all_the adequate tests necessary . I don ' t believe that we should be waiting and hoping for another test. &quot; Indeed , Stein , who has been involved with the Patriot program for nearly 20 years , points_out that live weapons testing is a small part of predicting performance . &quot; Most of our knowledge of the system comes from a variety of fairly complex computer simulations that we do , &quot; he says . &quot; that ' s where you really exercise the system . The value of the live testing is to look_at the way the radar and the data confirm what you have done_in the simulations . It ' s very , very elaborate . . . &quot; But a vociferous portion of the defense technology community -- including Lehman and Postol -- fear that computer simulation , no matter how sophisticated or elaborate , is becoming more of a substitute for than a complement for live testing . In other words , too many weapons designers are choosing to simulate reality than live_in it . &quot; Simulation has an important role to play , &quot; says Lehman . &quot; But too_much of it is part of this insidious hollowing out of the military that takes_place when you have this big of a budget crunch . Testing against the real threat can be expensive , but if we can do_it , that ' s what we should do. &quot; One can only hope that the question of how well Patriots can perform in wartime will never again need to be answered . But it is a sobering reality of defense technology acquisition today that we seem unwilling and unable to test the lessons we say we ' ve learned in a real environment . Hardly a comforting thought for the people who are risking their lives in the Gulf .</TEXT>
