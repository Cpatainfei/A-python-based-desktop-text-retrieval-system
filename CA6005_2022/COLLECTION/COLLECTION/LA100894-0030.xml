   <HEADLINE> GREATER AIR THREAT IN BOSNIA URGED ; BALKANS : NATO ASKS U.N. TO STREAMLINE PROCEDURES AND MAKE IT EASIER TO LAUNCH PUNITIVE STRIKES . BUT NEW MEASURES WON ' T ADD MUCH DETERRENT FORCE , OFFICIALS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After intense prodding from the United States , the 16-nation Atlantic Alliance on Friday formally pressed the United Nations for measures to intensify the use of Western air_power in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina . The measures , detailed in a letter to U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , would : * Streamline mandatory consultations between North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization and U.N. officials before any punitive air strikes against forces violating U.N.-declared weapons exclusion zones . * Expand the target lists for such reprisal raids . * Eliminate the need to give violators a warning before attacking . NATO officials said the measures would change procedures that have proven dangerous to the alliance ' s pilots and so cumbersome that they have frequently made raids impossible to carry_out . &quot; By the time the green_light comes , our aircraft are out of fuel , &quot; a senior NATO official said . The overwhelming majority of violations have been by Bosnian Serb forces , who have largely -- and so far successfully -- ignored U.N. warnings to respect the resolutions establishing the exclusion zones around the cities of Sarajevo and Gorazde , as well as other &quot; safe &quot; areas . ( This week , however , the violations have been committed by Bosnian government troops . In an operation begun a day earlier , U.N. troops intervened in escalating clashes around Sarajevo , expelling more_than 500 government troops Friday from a demilitarized zone on Mt . Igman , near a site where 20 Serbs were killed in a commando raid , wire_services reported . ( U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi had accused the Bosnians of mutilating and burning some of the victims of that raid , but Friday the United Nations withdrew those charges . Spokesman Tim Spicer said : &quot; With the benefit of hindsight , I would say it was an aggressive military attack on a command_post . . . there was no suggestion of people being executed. &quot; ) NATO officials said the new measures were desperately needed to restore credibility to the air_power deterrent and thus prevent further erosion of these areas . &quot; We ' ve all worked hard to get these zones established , and no one wants to have them eaten_away , &quot; the senior NATO official said . The NATO proposal comes amid U.S. efforts to increase pressure against the Bosnian Serbs to force them to accept a peace agreement worked_out by a five-nation group made_up of the United States , Britain , France , Germany and Russia . However , even if accepted by Boutros-Ghali , the measures seem unlikely to have much of an impact because they fail to address the more fundamental differences between NATO and the United Nations that have made allied air_power more of a joke than a deterrent in Bosnia . Despite increasingly brazen violations by Bosnian Serb forces of the exclusion zone around Sarajevo through the summer and early autumn , NATO aircraft have only been ordered into action twice . The total damage inflicted by the world ' s mightiest military alliance during these sorties near the Bosnian capital amounts to the destruction of one outdated anti-tank gun Aug . 5 and a single derelict tank Sept . 22 . This impotence can be traced only in part to the procedures NATO now wants to streamline , according to many of those familiar_with the Balkan crisis . The problem lies far more in a failure of political will on the part of the United Nations , which has consistently shied_away_from using air strikes to protect the exclusion zones , they say . NATO sources stressed Friday that even under the proposed changes , U.N. representatives would retain their right to veto any air strike that NATO wanted to launch . The United Nations ' failure to be more aggressive in defending its exclusion zones has steadily increased tensions with NATO . One measure of those tensions is that NATO ambassadors spent three days drafting their letter ; apparently they feared that Boutros-Ghali would reject a too-sharply worded demand as an affront , but not take seriously a too-politely worded request .</TEXT>
