   <HEADLINE> RAVELLI TO SET RECORD , BUT CAREER HAS YET TO BE CAPPED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Wednesday , goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli will play his 116th and most important game for Sweden , a World Cup semifinal against Brazil at the Rose Bowl . That will give him the record for most national team appearances by a Swedish player and leave him only nine games shy of the world_record . The record is held by England ' s Peter Shilton , with 125 caps , followed by Pat Jennings of Northern_Ireland with 119 . Both players have retired from international competition . Ravelli , who ranks third with 115 , is intent_on making the mark his own . &quot; It ' s one of my goals , to break ( Shilton ' s ) record , &quot; he said earlier this year . &quot; It depends_on how I ' m playing , but I plan to go_on for at least two more years . &quot; We have the European Championship finals in 1996 and I ' d like to play in England if we qualify. &quot; Sweden , with Ravelli in the nets , finished third , behind Denmark and Germany , in the 1992 European Championship . But Ravelli does not consider that the highlight of his career . &quot; I hope the biggest moment of my career is yet to come_before I retire , &quot; he said . A victory on Wednesday would certainly make that dream come true . GRAHAME L . JONES</TEXT>
