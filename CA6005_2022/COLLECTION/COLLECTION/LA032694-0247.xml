   <HEADLINE> GUNFIRE ERUPTS OUTSIDE O.C. SHERIFF ' S DEPT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A brazen daylight attack outside Orange County Sheriff ' s Department headquarters Friday sent bystanders scrambling for cover as six assailants descended on a man , clubbed him and opened_fire at this unlikely site for settling a grudge . No one was struck by gunfire . The injured man , who was hit with a tire_iron , wandered into the nearby lobby of the Men ' s Central Jail with blood dripping from his head . The assailants , identified by authorities as suspected gang members , sped away in a BMW sedan and a Honda Civic . &quot; I have never , never , ever , in 26 years , seen an attack like this in a place like that , &quot; said Santa Ana Police Sgt . Dick Faust . The explosion of gunfire at 3 p.m. sent jail visitors running and ducking behind concrete benches and a hot dog cart near the complex . About 15 Santa Ana police_officers and sheriff ' s deputies converged on the area , but the assailants had already escaped in different directions . No arrests had been made Friday night . The injured man , Van Pham , 20 , of Garden Grove , was treated for a cut on the back of his head and later released . Pham had been working_at the jail earlier in the day , sweeping floors as part of a court-ordered work program , when he exchanged heated words with six men who may have come_to the jail to visit a prisoner , police said . The Sheriff ' s Department complex is across the street from the Civic Center that includes the seat of county government , as well as the Santa Ana Police_Department . Sitting in two cars_parked along the curb outside the jail , the men waited for Pham to leave at 3 p.m , Faust said . Witnesses said the men yelled at Pham in Vietnamese as he walked along the sidewalk . The men then tackled him in the street and someone struck him with a tire_iron , witnesses said . As Pham and the driver of a black Honda fought , a passenger in a charcoal-colored BMW grabbed a gun from the car ' s trunk -- by some witness accounts a small rifle , by others a handgun -- and began shooting at the victim as he bolted toward the jail . The gunman , following Pham , fired four shots before the attackers retreated and fled . Police found no spent ammunition shells at the scene , and said the gun was likely a revolver . &quot; It was pretty scary . I ' m standing on the sidewalk , then all_of a sudden there ' s a fight , then people start running , &quot; said Rob Horton , who was at the jail to visit a friend . &quot; It all happened so fast , people were running and ducking. &quot; The attack left bystanders shaken and police officials incredulous . &quot; Well , the jail is in an area where there ' s a lot of ( criminal ) activity , but to have an incident right there , well , that is pretty unusual , &quot; said sheriff ' s spokesman Lt . Dan Martini . &quot; I ' m sure it wasn ' t planned . &quot; These guys probably weren ' t thinking , but that ' s always the problem . And I guess it ' s also the reason we have so many people in custody right there , &quot; Martini said . Faust described the gunman as an Asian male , 5-foot-3 and weighing 110 pounds . He was wearing a light-blue shirt and dark khaki pants . The man who fought with Pham was described as Asian , 6 feet in_height and weighing 130 pounds . He was wearing a white shirt and light-brown pants . Both vehicles were &quot; low-rider &quot; cars that sit close to the ground , witnesses said . Santa Ana police asked that anyone with information about the attack or assailants call ( 714 ) 834-4801 .</TEXT>
