   <HEADLINE> NEPAL ' S KING HANDS REINS OF GOVERNMENT TO COMMUNISTS ; ASIA : NEW PRIME_MINISTER AND HIS PARTY DO NOT HAVE PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY . THAT COULD LIMIT THEIR TENURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the oddest couples ever seen in politics took command of this lofty and poor Himalayan kingdom Wednesday when Nepal ' s monarch , revered by millions as a living god , swore_in a government of Communists . This overwhelmingly Hindu land has quite improbably become the world ' s first convert to the tenets of Karl Marx since the Berlin Wall crumbled five years ago and the Soviet Bloc began its meltdown . However , because the Communists are still short of a parliamentary majority , Nepal ' s unprecedented attempt at reconciling the demands of hereditary rule with the proletarian revolution may be short-lived . The new prime_minister , Man Mohan Adhikary , 74 , has been a committed if moderate Communist for half a century . On Tuesday , when King Birendra tapped him for the premier ' s post to end two weeks of political uncertainty , he rode to the royal palace in an old Toyota -- and left in a black Mercedes-Benz limousine . &quot; We shall keep the country ' s reality in mind -- adopt practical and pragmatic economic_policies -- and hope for cooperation from all others in our consensual approach , &quot; a conciliatory Adhikary told reporters . On Wednesday , the king administered Adhikary the oath of office under glittering chandeliers at the royal palace . The new prime_minister , who used to wear his salt-and-pepper beard long and shaggy , had trimmed it to a neat goatee . To govern this rugged land the size of North Carolina , Adhikary appointed a 15-member Cabinet of party confidants . His brother , lawyer Bharat Mohan Adhikary , was named finance_minister . The powerful party general secretary , 42-year-old Madhav Kumar Nepal , will serve as deputy prime_minister , foreign_minister and defense minister . Adhikary assured Nepalis that he will continue to accept foreign_aid and capital but will try to use the money more effectively . He vowed to continue Nepal ' s multi-party democracy and neutral tack in foreign_policy , but he said he will attempt to revise a longstanding , controversial treaty with India that many here believe gives the giant to the south too_much influence over Nepal . Although the party has pledged to promote private enterprise , it has also gone_on record in favor of dismantling large agricultural landholdings and slamming the brakes on privatization of state economic assets . In truth , Adhikary ' s position in Parliament leaves him few options besides moderation . In the Nov . 15 election , his Communist_Party of Nepal-United Marxist-Leninist won 88 seats , topping the 83 grabbed by the centrist Nepali Congress party , which had been in power since multi-party democracy was restored three years ago . The right-wing , pro-monarchy National Democratic Party picked_up 20 seats . When Congress and the monarchists failed to agree on cobbling_together a governing coalition of 103 seats , the magic_number needed to control the 205-seat chamber , Birendra had no choice under the 1990 constitution but to appoint the chairman of the party with the most seats as prime_minister . Adhikary ' s government now has 30 days to prove it is supported by a majority of the members of the bicameral Parliament ' s lower house . If it fails , Birendra will have to call new elections within six months . The unforgiving numbers are one reason countries that inject large amounts of aid into Nepal don ' t appear terribly concerned by the Communists ' victory . &quot; They can ' t take any drastic or dramatic measures with the kind of strength they possess , &quot; one Katmandu-based Western diplomat said . One Nepali commentator said the United States and other countries had indicated to government officials that they will not stop giving assistance to Nepal , one of the world ' s 10 poorest nations , but are following a &quot; wait and watch &quot; policy . Adhikary was thrown into prison in December , 1960 , when the monarch who then reigned -- Birendra ' s father , Mahendra -- staged a coup d ' etat with the help of the army and dismantled the kingdom ' s first democratically elected government after only 18 months . He was released in 1969 . Times special correspondent Adhikary reported from Katmandu , Times staff writer Dahlburg from New Delhi .</TEXT>
