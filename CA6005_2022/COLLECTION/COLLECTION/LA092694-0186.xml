   <HEADLINE> CLINTON URGES U.N. TO HALT SERB MOVES_ON MUSLIMS ; BALKANS : HE MEETS WITH SECRETARY_GENERAL TO PRESS FOR BETTER ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROTECTED AREAS IN BOSNIA . EUROPEAN ALLIES NOT LIKELY TO GO ALONG .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton urged U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Sunday to step_up protection of the exclusion zones in Bosnia that the United Nations has sought to shield with NATO warplanes from Bosnian Serb attack . Clinton , in one of a series of meetings before his address this morning to the U.N. General_Assembly , made &quot; a very strong statement &quot; to Boutros-Ghali about the need to halt increasing encroachment , a senior Administration official said . &quot; We want the exclusion zones enforced properly. &quot; The zones were set_up around Gorazde and Sarajevo to protect large Bosnian Muslim populations from advancing Serbian troops . But they have come under intermittent shelling from Serb positions , as well as sniper fire . Recently , Serb forces have cut_off gas , electricity and water coming_into Sarajevo , and are disrupting the flow of supplies . The meeting with Boutros-Ghali came as Clinton wrapped_up a four-day fund-raising tour through Chicago , Minneapolis , Kansas City and New York . The President shifted to diplomacy Sunday afternoon , meeting separately with Boutros-Ghali and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic . Clinton ' s U.N. appeal is likely to put him at_odds with French and British allies , who have been far less eager to use allied warplanes to protect the Bosnian exclusion zones . That reluctance is_due in large part to the presence of French and British peacekeeping troops , who might be casualties if the Serbs return fire . Officials also hinted that the U.S. and Bosnian officials might be rethinking proposals to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian government if the Bosnian Serbs do not agree to a plan for partition of Bosnia by an Oct . 15 deadline . But officials said that in the Sunday afternoon meeting with Izetbegovic , the two men discussed the problems that could arise from an abrupt lifting of the embargo . The Bosnians worry that such quick action could trigger Serb assaults on more weakly protected Bosnian communities on the east_side of the country . Clinton also discussed a Bosnian proposal to set_up a five-kilometer &quot; demilitarized zone &quot; around Sarajevo . Such a zone could allow a reopening of roads , and , by barring even small arms , could ease Sarajevo ' s threat of sniper fire . Earlier Sunday , Clinton warned from a Harlem pulpit that his party ' s adversaries are poised to confuse the Democratic faithful into voting against their interests . Speaking at Bethel A.M.E. Church , Clinton said the opposition ' s efforts to deny his achievements mean that &quot; the people may actually go_out and vote for the very things they are against because they don ' t know what ' s happened in the last 20 months &quot; of his term . In his appearance at the African American church , Clinton offered the most complete version yet of his election-year speech , which he hopes will persuade voters not to chip_away Democratic membership in Congress . He said he was being blamed for problems that took decades to accumulate . &quot; We have an election in which there are 30 years of social problems , 20 years of economic problems and 12 years of politicians bad-mouthing the government , &quot; Clinton said . In an aside that seemed aimed at Republicans and the news media , he said voters &quot; cannot know &quot; of his accomplishments because there ' s no way for them to get the information . Sounding somewhat plaintive , he added : &quot; I have been President for 20 months , not 30 years , not 20 years , not 10 years. &quot; The service brought_out some of New York ' s most prominent Democrats , including Gov . Mario M . Cuomo . Clinton said in his sermon that Cuomo , who faces an uphill fight for his fourth gubernatorial term , is &quot; the heart you must_not lose. &quot; And Cuomo returned the compliment , calling the President &quot; a great leader who is bringing us toward very great good , and who has realized some of it already . . . . &quot; Clinton spoke warmly of the U.S. occupation of Haiti , not mentioning a firefight Saturday evening that left 10 Haitians dead and the city of Cap Haitien with no apparent local police authorities . Clinton said he believes &quot; more and more Americans are seeing what we are doing there is good. &quot; He also took_part in a fund-raising reception and luncheon for Democratic congressional candidates that raised $ 350 # 000 from 5 # 000 donors . Meanwhile on Sunday , Frank Luntz , a Republican pollster , said on ABC-TV ' s &quot; This Week With David Brinkley &quot; that his own polling indicated that GOP candidates also have reason to avoid stressing party identification in their races . Luntz said his polling suggests that &quot; there ' s an awful lot of disappointment , that both political_parties have got few strengths and an awful lot of weaknesses. &quot;</TEXT>
