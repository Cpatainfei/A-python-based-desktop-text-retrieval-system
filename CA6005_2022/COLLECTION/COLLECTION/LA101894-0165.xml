   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL AGENDA ; CHINA FRETS OVER INFLATION ; LEADERS TRUMPET THEIR CONCERN BUT SEEM POWERLESS TO HALT THE RISING PRICES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They were unlikely protesters -- not idealistic students nor brooding intellectuals nor angry young workers , simply unhappy pensioners whose incomes were not keeping_up with inflation . The retired steel_mill employees who staged a sit-in outside a factory gate in the central Chinese city of Wuhan this spring were hardly the sort of people who could bring_down a government . Perhaps for that reason , rather than face arrest , they won : The factory agreed to boost their pensions from 250 yuan ( about $ 30 ) a month to a bit more_than 300 yuan ( about $ 36 ) . But these days in China -- amid an economic boom that is benefiting most people but leaving hundreds of millions of others behind -- that isn ' t enough to live_on . &quot; We basically use our entire pensions on food because we can ' t afford to buy anything else , &quot; said one beneficiary of the protest , a retired steelworker named Zhang . &quot; We can ' t really live with our available money . We have a nephew who earns more , and he gives us spending money every month to help us get by. &quot; Five years after the People ' s Liberation Army crushed pro-democracy protests fueled partly by outrage over rising prices , the specter of inflation is again at the top of China ' s public concerns . Not since summer , 1988 -- when panic-buying of consumer items such_as refrigerators and televisions swept shelves bare in cities across this nation -- has the problem been so severe . Inflation alone seems unlikely to lead to an explosion of social unrest , given the Communist_Party ' s continuing ability to impose police-state controls or call_upon the army to crush any disturbances . But with 90-year-old senior leader Deng Xiaoping in gradually failing health , China could , at any time , face a destabilizing succession crisis . Serious inflation would add_to the uncertainties in any post-Deng power struggle . Top leaders of China ' s successor generation are trumpeting their concern about inflation but seem incapable of taking any measures to control it . &quot; Prices are rising fast and inflationary pressure is still too big , &quot; Premier Li Peng admitted in a recent speech , published on the front page of the official People ' s Daily . &quot; A considerable number of state-owned enterprises are in difficulty , and at some inefficient firms the real income of workers is falling . Parts of the country are plagued by crime and social disorder . . . . The living standards of hundreds of millions of peasants has a direct impact on the entire nation ' s economic development and social stability. &quot; Thus , controlling inflation must be the government ' s &quot; most important task . . . during the second_half of this year , &quot; Li said . The fears of Chinese rulers have been stoked by statistics showing that annual inflation in major cities is running at 27 % . Urban food prices this summer were up 32 % from a year earlier , while grain prices soared 58 % . Last year , for example , half a kilogram of eggs -- 10 large eggs or a dozen smaller ones -- sold for 2.40 yuan ( 28 cents ) in Beijing ; now they cost 3.30 yuan ( 39 cents ) . Broccoli has jumped to 3.18 yuan ( 37 cents ) a pound from 2.27 yuan ( 27 cents ) a pound . Since the beginning of this year , pork , the most important meat in the Chinese diet , has jumped to 7.28 yuan ( 86 cents ) a pound , up from 4.55 yuan ( 54 cents ) . Concern about the social impact of price increases is chilling plans to force state-owned industries to face fiercer market competition , though squeezing greater efficiency out of poorly run factories would be a key step toward solving underlying problems . Authorities seem to be afraid that inflation and industrial restructuring make too volatile a mix . &quot; For a lot of workers . . . life is very very hard , especially now , when a lot of enterprises are closing_down or reforming and they are laying_off a lot of people , &quot; said Zhang , the onetime steelworker who moved to Beijing from Wuhan after retiring . &quot; I think the government should be very careful about what they do to the workers of China. &quot; After the bloody 1989 crackdown on the student-led Tian An Men Square protests , the government &quot; covered it up pretty well , and they scared them &quot; into silence , Zhang said . &quot; But if they infuriate the workers , there will be no stopping them. &quot; But many others in Beijing believe that however angry people may get_over price increases , there is nothing they can do . Most people ' s incomes are also growing a bit faster than inflation , and consumers further benefit from availability of an ever-growing variety of goods . In 1988 , when similar rates_of_inflation caused a panic , China was emerging from almost four decades of stable prices . But now people are accustomed to seeing both wages and prices go_up . And for ordinary people in Beijing , the key lesson of Tian An Men Square seems to be that challenging the government on anything is a dangerous exercise in futility . * &quot; If you try to defend your rights -- in this case , consumer rights -- you may be branded an ultra-leftist , an ultra-rightist , or something else extreme , &quot; a 30-year-old tour guide said . &quot; Every single person in this country is under the Communist_Party ' s control . The Chinese people are like bricks_in a wall . When you ' re building it , you stack them up , one by one . If there are some that are too long or too short or misshapen , they ' ll be banged into the right shape. &quot; Despite his bitterness and cynicism -- or perhaps because of it -- this man takes a long-term view about rising prices , saying : &quot; I ' m sure inflation is a problem in every developing country in the world . Whatever problems this society has right now are natural for China. &quot; Zhai Huiru , 38 , a teacher at a polytechnic school with a salary slightly more_than 500 yuan ( $ 59 ) per month , is typical of those managing to keep_up . &quot; I ' m sure most people are numb to all these price hikes , just as I am , &quot; Zhai said . &quot; It ' s quite hard for me to make ends meet with my salary . I use it all to buy_food -- no clothes , no hairdos , just food . &quot; But I have to say that living standards now are higher than in the 1970s . All you need is money , and you can buy anything you want. &quot; Zhai ' s way_out is to take_on extra jobs , which she said is how most people cope_with inflation . &quot; I also teach at night_school , and sometimes edit other people ' s papers , &quot; she explained . Some observers , noting that people in urban_areas have accepted the inflation of the last year with very little open protest , wonder why the top leadership is jaw-boning about it now . &quot; You see ( Premier ) Li Peng and ( Vice Premier ) Zhu Rongji on television , and they ' re so obsessed with this , &quot; a Western diplomat said . * &quot; Why do they talk so_much ? If you have a problem with inflation , the central government shouldn ' t talk so_much about it , they should do something about it . It ' s not the kind of thing you can appeal_to the masses to solve . . . . I suppose they want to signal that they ' re trying to do something about it. &quot; Some key steps that have been announced to fight inflation include imposition of temporary price_controls on selected products , a ban on new government-implemented price increases for the rest of this year , and exhortations to state-run wholesalers to do a better job of purchasing pork and vegetables , with the goal of guaranteeing reasonably priced supplies to the urban_areas . But with more_than half of the average person ' s consumption now supplied through essentially free markets , the impact of these measures may prove negligible . Top leaders thus seem to be &quot; very afraid &quot; that inability to stop inflation &quot; may lead to social unrest , &quot; the diplomat said . &quot; It led the KMT ( Chiang Kai-shek ' s Nationalist Party ) to fall , and helped cause ( the protests of ) 1989 . But the public -- at least in the cities -- has grown more accommodating . The danger is in the countryside. &quot; * Government talk_about battling inflation may also be related to maneuvering over the post-Deng succession , the diplomat said , noting : &quot; I think all_of them are playing politics -- short-term , positional politics. &quot; Top leaders may also be nervous because they know that , despite their continued ability to crack_down on open opposition , the government faces a profound loss of public respect . In prosperous Guangdong province , adjacent to Hong Kong , many people no longer bother to hide their contempt for the Communist_Party and most of the nation ' s top leaders . When a visitor mentioned to his taxi driver that early this year Li had said he aimed to hold inflation below 10 % , the driver ' s response was open and direct : &quot; He ' s a dirty liar. &quot; It is hard for outsiders to get a full picture of what is happening in the countryside . But scattered reports of peasant riots occasionally filter in from the provinces . And many Chinese have learned to read between the lines of the official media . State-run television &quot; shows programs about the burdens on peasants , &quot; noted Shang , a middle-aged employee of a Chinese-foreign joint_venture . &quot; Every time when a party leader somewhere in Shaanxi ( a poor northwestern province ) eats dumplings with peasants in their houses , it means something serious has happened. &quot; Despite the overall increased prosperity of today , some people say their living standards were , in some ways , higher during the days of Chairman Mao Tse-tung , when prices were controlled and egalitarianism was the official ideology . * &quot; This country has become more and more unfair , &quot; complained Wu Li , 55 , a mathematician who said he earns 400 yuan ( about $ 47 ) a month . &quot; Those nouveau riche eat lobster and crab , while we cannot even afford high-class vegetables . I remember in the 1960s and 1970s I could eat a chicken or fish every week , but now for every meal we ' re on a tight budget. &quot; But most people consider any talk_of &quot; the good old days &quot; to be nonsense . &quot; During Mao ' s days , the prices were stable , &quot; acknowledged Liu Yumei , 60 , a grandmother who lives with her son ' s family . &quot; They never changed for 30 years . But so what ? Everything was rationed . There was nothing in the stores . &quot; Could you imagine having meat every meal ? Could you have so many kinds of vegetables to choose in the winter ? People are always complaining about price rises . But no one ' s living standard is truly falling. &quot; Victor Zatsepine of The Times ' Beijing Bureau contributed to this report .
