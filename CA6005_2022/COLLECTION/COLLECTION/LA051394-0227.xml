   <HEADLINE> FORMULA ONE ' S WENDLINGER CRITICAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Less than two weeks after three-time world champion Ayrton Senna of Brazil and rookie Roland Ratzenberger of Austria were killed during a Formula One weekend in Imola , Italy , a third Formula One driver lay_in critical condition Thursday after crashing during practice for the Monaco Grand Prix . Karl Wendlinger , 25 , of Austria , suffered head injuries when his Sauber-Mercedes hit a concrete barrier head-on at high speed shortly after exiting the famous Monte Carlo tunnel . Doctors said he was in a &quot; very serious coma. &quot; The three tragic incidents , coming only three months after the deaths of stock_car drivers Neil Bonnett and Rodney Orr at Daytona International Speedway while practicing for the Daytona 500 , have left the sport searching for answers . Mario Andretti , Emerson Fittipaldi and Nigel Mansell , all former Formula One world champions in Indianapolis preparing_for the Indy 500 , had varying opinions on the situation . &quot; We should learn something from every accident , &quot; Andretti said . &quot; Unfortunately , two tragic accidents ( Senna and Ratzenberger ) occurred where it ' s not a likely place to lose a car . Still , even though race officials felt it was a safe place , it would not have cost much for two rows of tires in front of the wall . &quot; They said Senna was killed when a wheel rebounded and hit him on the forehead . The same impact , at the same speed , against rows of tires would probably not have sent the wheel back against him . &quot; Another thing is the Formula One cockpit . The driver ' s head and shoulders are naked . From the neck up is exposed . Some sort of heavily padded protection for the side of the head , such_as we have in Indy cars , would help . It might have saved a life. &quot; Fittipaldi , who won the Formula One championship in 1972 and 1974 before coming_to race in the United States , said the current Formula One cars are much too fragile . &quot; They weigh 250 pounds less than an Indy car and because they are so light , there is not much material around the driver to absorb an impact , &quot; Fittipaldi said . &quot; The driver is much more vulnerable than he is in an Indy car . I would recommend a canopy cockpit , similar to those used in off-shore racing_boats , to make them more safe. &quot; Mansell was more philosophical . &quot; Any form of motor racing over 30 m.p.h. is dangerous , &quot; the 1992 Formula One champion and current Indy car champion said . &quot; In the past 10 years in Formula One and Indy cars , there have been a lot of horrific accidents in which drivers walked away . I call it luck . &quot; Take the accident in Phoenix . It was just plain luck we didn ' t have at least one , maybe two , fatalities. &quot; At Phoenix last month , Hiro Matsushita was sitting in the middle of the track after a relatively minor accident when he was hit broadside by Jacques Villeneuve ' s car , splitting Matsushita ' s car in half . &quot; If Villeneuve had hit one foot to the left , he would have hit Hiro and surely killed him . One foot to the right and he would hit the engine , and possibly killed himself . Where he hit was straight between the engine and the monocoque , which was split . I ' m telling you that was luck . The Gods were shining on all_of us up there. &quot; It had been 12 years since a fatality occurred in Formula One before the double deaths at Imola . Veteran Formula One driver Gerhard Berger , a close friend of Senna ' s , seemed to echo Mansell ' s feelings when he told the Associated Press : &quot; It seems there is a period of luck together and a period of unluck together , and it seems the luck period is finished. &quot; Max Mosley , president of the International Automobile Federation , said the Monte Carlo race on Sunday could be canceled depending_on Wendlinger ' s condition .</TEXT>
