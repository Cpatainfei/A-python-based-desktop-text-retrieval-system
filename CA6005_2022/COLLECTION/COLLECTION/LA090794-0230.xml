   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; THE READER ' S DIGEST VERSION OF CD-ROM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reader ' s Digest , one of the biggest names in publishing and a standard bearer for the world of print , with more_than 28 million copies of the monthly magazine sold worldwide , is going interactive . The Pleasantville , N.Y.-based publishing empire said Tuesday that it is joining with Microsoft Corp . to develop home computer_programs in the CD-ROM format , based on its Reader ' s Digest books . The first multimedia title is scheduled for release in the second_half of 1995 and will be based on information and illustrations from selected Reader ' s Digest reference_books , the publisher said in a statement . While neither Reader ' s Digest nor Microsoft would divulge the title or subject of the software , a Reader ' s Digest spokeswoman said the first CD-ROM would be based on the company ' s publications , which also include Travel Holiday and the Family Handyman . Travel Holiday is already available to computer users through America Online and the Family Handyman can be accessed on CompuServe . The new product &quot; is a natural progression &quot; for Reader ' s Digest , said spokeswoman Lesta Cordil , which publishes its flagship magazine in 17 languages . It will publish a magazine in its 18th language , Polish , shortly . While the CD-ROM version of Reader ' s Digest publications will not replace the printed page , it is a way of making the most of the company ' s products while taking_advantage of the latest technology , she said . Reader ' s Digest has the editorial content , but it &quot; didn ' t have the technical know-how &quot; to produce a product for the home computer , Cordil said . Therefore , &quot; we went_with the best , &quot; meaning Microsoft , to help develop and sell the product . The CD-ROM will be marketed by both companies , through mail_order by Reader ' s Digest , and at retail_stores by Microsoft . It will carry both the Microsoft Home and the Reader ' s Digest brand names .</TEXT>
