   <HEADLINE> LANDMARK ACCORD REACHED ON USE OF BAY-DELTA WATER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an historic accord that marks at least a temporary end to the bitter struggle over California ' s most precious water resource , Gov . Pete Wilson and senior members of the Clinton_Administration signed an agreement Thursday to protect the Sacramento Delta estuary and provide reliable water_supplies to farms and cities across the state . Flanked by Secretary_of_the_Interior Bruce Babbitt and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Carol Browner , Wilson declared that the three-year accord &quot; signals a cease-fire in the water wars that have too long plagued California. &quot; &quot; It puts an end to a bitter conflict that has persisted for decades , &quot; President Clinton said in a statement released by the White_House . &quot; This is a solution that serves all_the people of California. &quot; The agreement covering the delta inland from San Francisco Bay at the confluence of the Sacramento , San Joaquin and a host of lesser Northern California rivers calls_for : * New rules on how much fresh river water must be left in the delta for environmental needs , including the habitat of the endangered chinook_salmon and delta smelt . In a normal year the amount will be 400 # 000 acre-feet . In severe drought years the total will be 1.1 million acre-feet . * Three years of certainty about water_supplies from the delta for farms and urban customers . * Lesser curbs on water for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California during drought years . Under the accord , the MWD will lose no more_than 5 % of its total water_supply in severely dry years . * New salinity standards for the delta and Suisun Bay , the nation ' s largest brackish marsh and a nursery for many of the estuary ' s 120 species of fish . * Payment by the federal_government if any more water is needed to help any species that become newly endangered . Many environmental groups endorsed the final accord , although it closely parallels proposals by a coalition of urban and agricultural interests . It will provide &quot; an affordable and reliable future water_supply , &quot; said John R . Wodraska , general_manager of the Metropolitan Water District , which delivers water to 16 million Southern California customers . &quot; This is really a big deal for California agriculture , &quot; said Dan Nelson of the San Luis and Delta-Mendota Water Authority , one of the largest water users in the Central Valley . The agreement has been coming_together for several months , but pulling it off required a final week of marathon negotiations and significant federal concessions over how much water is required to support the delta ' s ailing aquatic life . Often described as a crossroads of environmental and economic interests , the delta is the largest wetland habitat in the western United States . It also collects half of the state ' s annual runoff , provides 60 % of the fresh_water used in California and is the source of irrigation water for 45 % of the nation ' s fruits and vegetables . The accord &quot; finally secures significant environmental improvements for the bay-delta estuary , &quot; said John Krautkraemer of the Environmental Defense Fund . However , the enthusiasm was not universally shared among environmental activists . &quot; On the basis of respected independent scientists , there is no assurance that California salmon will survive this political compromise , &quot; said state Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) . For the Clinton_Administration , which is girding for a Republican assault on a variety of environmental regulations , the pact offers an opportunity to argue that it can be flexible on crucial issues . That is particularly so in_regard_to one of the most embattled conservation_laws , the Endangered Species Act . &quot; It ( the agreement ) allows us a very powerful case study that the Endangered Species Act is workable and can play an important role in finding the balance between the economy and the environment , &quot; Babbitt said . For Wilson , who has been accused in the past of walking away from potential solutions to the delta impasse , the signing ceremony at the state Capitol was a moment to savor . He had insisted that he would not go_along with any plan that did not change the way that federal agencies , in_charge of administering the Endangered Species Act , dictated the flow of water available to consumers . Wilson has contended that implementation of the act led to arbitrary interruptions of water_supplies that made_it impossible for water agencies to calculate future supplies or costs . Yet it was a series of events independent of the governor that created much of the impetus for the accord . Momentum for an agreement began after the EPA , reacting to a refusal by Wilson to set delta protection standards , announced that it would step_in to impose federal rules . Then last March , Standard &amp; Poor ' s warned that if something wasn ' t done to end the delta water dispute , the state ' s credit rating , already hurt by the recession , could be further weakened . The warning prompted a dozen top_executives of leading California businesses to write to Wilson and Clinton that if state and federal_officials did not come_up with an acceptable delta policy , the economic recovery in California could be jeopardized . By midsummer , negotiations between state and federal_officials began to show progress on one of the most important elements in the accord -- a standard to govern how much water must be allowed to flow past diversion pumps in_order to establish a healthy balance between fresh and salt water in the estuary . Meanwhile , progress on another front was being made by a coalition of urban and agricultural water users under the leadership of Wodraska and Nelson . They began lobbying in Washington and Sacramento for a plan that became the basis for the accord . The Wilson Administration endorsed the plan , which called_for reserving several hundred_thousand acre-feet less water for environmental needs in critically dry years than was being recommended by federal_officials . Some of the same environmentalists who ultimately signed the accord argued that the coalition ' s plan would lead to the extinction of endangered fish . But the Republican_Party ' s triumph in the November election changed the political environment in such a dramatic way that the coalition ' s proposal , with some modification , began to look_like the best deal that might be struck on the delta . ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Delta Agreement State and federal_officials announced a plan to restore the environmental health of the estuary that stretches from San Francisco Bay to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta . Here are the key points of the agreement : * New standards for salinity of delta water and Suisun Bay , the nation ' s largest brackish marsh . * Water guaranteed for environmental needs in the delta : 400 # 000 acre-feet in normal years , 1.1 million acre-feet in extreme drought years . * No new species to be listed as threatened for at least three years . * Increased role of the state in delta water policy . * Water users will bankroll fund to reduce fish loss by installing screens and other steps .</TEXT>
