   <HEADLINE> ' 90S FAMILY ; GOOD RELATIONSHIP BOLSTERS PARENTS ' INFLUENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Parents of adolescents despair over how little say they have with their kids . As the threats to their kids multiply -- drugs , alcohol , sex -- parents ' influence may seem to shrink . A recent study in the journal Pediatrics , however , finds that parents have a lot of influence over their children -- even though it ' s primarily indirect . The study , of 1 # 034 fifth-graders and 1 # 266 seventh-graders in Southern California , was designed to find what , specifically , parents do that could be linked to children ' s use of alcohol or tobacco . Critical for families is a warm relationship between parent and child . Parents &quot; can influence their adolescents by establishing strong relationships with them in middle childhood . So if they have that good relationship , and children feel they can go_to their parents , that they can communicate with them , that their parents are there for them , then those children will be protected during adolescence , &quot; says Dr. Deborah A . Cohen of Louisiana State University Medical_Center , lead author of the study . &quot; They ' ll be protected in that they ' ll be less likely to choose friends who use substances , and they ' ll be less likely to get_into trouble -- get_into fights , or be disciplined in school , or take risks . So parents are powerful , but it ' s very clear in the study that it ' s an indirect effect. &quot; The researchers expected to find that parents ' knowledge of their kids ' friends would help prevent dangerous practices . &quot; In fact , that doesn ' t make any difference at all . Because parents , even if they know who ( their children ' s ) friends are , don ' t know whether those friends use substances or are a bad or good influence , &quot; Cohen says . &quot; Monitoring is important -- knowing where your children are , what they ' re doing . But it doesn ' t really matter if they know who they ' re with , &quot; she says . Children whose parents monitored them strongly were about half as likely as other students to use alcohol . Similar protective effects were found for parents who have effective communication and spend time with their children . Researchers found that &quot; the students who do end_up using substances , their parents absolutely don ' t have a clue , &quot; Cohen says . &quot; Parents who overestimate what kind of relationship they have with their kids , or who think their kids are OK , are much more likely to have problems than the parents who are concerned and have a better idea of what ' s going_on with their children . &quot; There ' s a gap between what parents think and what kids think , &quot; Cohen says . &quot; I think it ' s helpful if parents check with their kids -- what are they doing , how do they feel. &quot; A warm parent-child relationship &quot; is characterized by parents ' providing positive_feedback through praise , encourage-ment and physical affection , &quot; the study says . &quot; Positive relations appear to be a direct consequence of parents ' spending time with their children as well as having frequent communication , asking_for a child ' s opinions , spending time talking , and sharing secrets and other concerns. &quot; Parents who routinely use praise and affection with their children , rather than criticism and anger , are using a &quot; positive_feedback system , which de-emphasizes aggression and punitive actions , &quot; the article says . The study did not find a link between single-parent homes and substance use . &quot; This is consistent with other studies in which the quality of the overall environment and parental attitudes were more important than the number of parents , &quot; the study says . Cohen advises that parents &quot; be positive . It ' s important to have discipline and so on , but what really makes a difference with kids is for them to feel positive and accepted -- to have that warm relationship . I know some parents can get overstrict and overcritical and so on , but what protects them is the positive relationship they have with their children. &quot; ' Positive relations appear to be a direct consequence of parents ' spending time with their children as well as having frequent communication , asking_for a child ' s opinions . . . sharing secrets.
