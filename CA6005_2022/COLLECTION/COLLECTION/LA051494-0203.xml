   <HEADLINE> NEO-NAZI ATTACK ON AFRICANS LEADS TO CRITICISM OF POLICE ; GERMANY : THE DRUNKEN RIGHTISTS WERE ' HUNTING FOREIGNERS. ' ONLY ONE OF 48 REMAINED IN CUSTODY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> German police drew harsh criticism Friday after failing to respond quickly to a bloody neo-Nazi attack on black_Africans that led to one of the worst racial riots in Germany since a wave of rightist violence against foreigners began two years ago . The fracas in the eastern city of Magdeburg started Thursday afternoon when dozens of drunken neo-Nazis drove through the streets &quot; hunting foreigners &quot; and assaulted a group of five Africans , according to police and witnesses . About 30 Turkish-led foreigners and German leftists came_to the Africans ' defense , fighting pitched street battles with the rightists until police contained the clashes late in the night . At least two foreigners were stabbed , one was beaten with iron bars , and several others were injured , according to police and press reports . Three rightists also suffered knife wounds . Police detained 48 alleged neo-Nazis but released all but one of them , incurring a rash of criticism from national media and political and business_leaders . One Turkish rioter also was under arrest . Early Friday , Magdeburg police spokesman Burkhard Jach said the neo-Nazis &quot; were drunk and obviously wanted to chase foreigners. &quot; He said that most of the people detained &quot; are known to us. &quot; But later , as public anger with police rose , Antonius Stockman , the Magdeburg police president , played_down the incident , saying the attackers were not a homogeneous group of rightists but hooligans and rightist hangers-on . &quot; Magdeburg is not a place of right-wing extremists , &quot; he said . German television reported , however , that the government_Office for the Protection of the Constitution had warned police about the potential for right-wing violence in Magdeburg . And residents reported that a leftist youth club in town has been attacked by &quot; skinheads &quot; about 10 times in the last couple of years . Police said they reacted quickly to Thursday ' s clashes but conceded that they initially did not have enough officers on_duty . Thursday was a national_holiday in Germany , and police and witnesses said the teen-age neo-Nazis had been drinking . Torsten Boek , a Greens Party leader in Magdeburg , said he saw them driving about town Thursday afternoon , waving a military flag of the Kaiser Reich . Details of the attack on the Africans were sketchy until the time the five sought refuge in a cafe . The neo-Nazis attacked the restaurant , throwing tables and chairs through the windows and shouting &quot; Germany for Germans. &quot; &quot; The police definitely showed_up too late , &quot; said Arab Oetzbay , the Turkish owner of the restaurant who declined to talk further about the incident , fearing a second attack . The identity of the Africans was not known . Magdeburg has a home for about 900 foreigners seeking asylum in Germany , but Horst Katzer , the deputy director of that institution , said he had been ordered by higher state officials not to give interviews . Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen , the government ' s representative for foreigners ' affairs , called the riot a new peak in a wave of radical rightist violence after German reunification . &quot; The fact that people are being hunted mirrors the worst events of the Nazi period , &quot; she told German radio . A spokesman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl called the bloodshed &quot; a shame &quot; and said the government would do all it could to prevent further violence . Ignatz Bubis , leader of Germany ' s Jewish community , expressed outrage , saying : &quot; I can ' t understand how something like this can happen . That the police can ' t manage to protect people is a scandal. &quot; He called_for disciplinary action against the police and said it was &quot; inconceivable &quot; that all but one of those arrested were released without being charged . In Magdeburg , townsfolk scarcely reacted to the riots . The number of right-wing attacks on foreigners has been declining in the last year after a series of fatal attacks in Moelln , Rostock and Solingen in 1992 and 1993 . But in November of last year , black members of the U.S. luge team were attacked in a discotheque in the east_German town of Oberhof where they had been training for the Olympics . Meantime , in Bonn , the nation ' s governing coalition on Friday agreed to back legislation making_it a crime to claim that the Nazis ' mass_murder of Jews is a lie . Coalition leaders said passage was expected next Friday in Parliament . Conviction of disseminating the &quot; Auschwitz Lie , &quot; named after the Nazi death camp in Poland , would be punishable by three years in prison . Andreas Scharpf and Christian Retzlaff , of The Times ' Berlin Bureau , in Magdeburg , contributed to this report.HATE CRIMES</TEXT>
