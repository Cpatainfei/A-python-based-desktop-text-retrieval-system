   <HEADLINE> AU_PAIR AGENCIES , HOSTS BLAST REGULATION PLAN ; FAMILIES : NEW GUIDELINES SOUGHT BY U.S. INFORMATION AGENCY WOULD REQUIRE INCREASED BENEFITS AND SET NEW AGE AND OTHER QUALIFICATIONS . CRITICS CALL THEM WELL-MEANING BUT TOO RESTRICTIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County agencies that provide &quot; au_pairs &quot; -- young_women and men from abroad who care_for American children -- say proposed government regulations could devastate their programs by imposing tough age and training requirements . Although many of the agencies support regulation , the requirements proposed this week by the United States Information Agency , which oversees the program , are restrictive , costly and intrude_on the choices families can make regarding their au_pairs , said representatives of several au_pair agencies . On Wednesday , the USIA published regulations that , if put into effect , would require that au_pairs be paid an allowance of $ 155 a week -- a 55 % increase -- receive two weeks of paid vacation and work no more_than 45 hours a week . Moreover , au_pairs would not be allowed to work in families with_children under the age of 2 unless they are 21 years old or older and can show documented child-care experience . The regulations are scheduled to go_into effect on Feb . 15 and would apply to au_pairs hired after that . A 30-day public comment period began last Wednesday . &quot; What they are trying to do is make_it into a stringent child-care program , &quot; said Bill Gustafson , director of eurAuPair , part of the nonprofit American Scandinavian Student Exchange in Laguna Beach . &quot; It is well-meaning , but there aren ' t that many 21-year-old au_pairs that are professionals in child_care , and at best they ' ve worked after school at child-care centers. &quot; The regulations proposed by USIA were formulated to redefine the program ' s emphasis and to respond to recent problems arising from inadequate screening , training and supervision of the au_pairs , said Jim Morgan , spokesman for the USIA . &quot; For USIA , this was always meant to be a cultural exchange program with a child-care component , &quot; Morgan said . &quot; But over the years , because of the popularity of the child_care , it flip-flopped and became more of a work program. &quot; Interest in regulating the program began more_than a year ago , however , predating the recent problems with the program , Morgan said . In August , a Dutch au_pair was charged with involuntary manslaughter in the shaking death of an 8-week-old boy she was caring for in Fairfax , Va . Anna Peeze , 19 , was sponsored by eurAuPair in Laguna Beach . Another au_pair left letters threatening to kill her young charges , and one accidentally burned a 1-year-old . But some Orange County families hosting au_pairs argue that these problems are the exception , not the rule . &quot; The government should re-evaluate the program and interview us , &quot; said Lauren Jackson , 38 , a full-time sales representative in San Clemente with two children , who are supervised by an au_pair . &quot; Let ' s find facts first before you think the system is broken because of a_few horror stories. &quot; Jackson believes the vast majority of au_pairs who come_to the United States do so with excellent intentions . &quot; My au_pairs have loved and taken_care of my children , &quot; said Jackson , who is currently with her sixth au_pair . &quot; They travel with us , vacation with us , go_to weddings and even funerals with us . They are integral parts of our family . Au_pairs are recruited from Western European_countries , and must be between 18 and 26 years old , according to current federal guidelines . They must be secondary_school graduates and proficient in English . The program , which began in 1986 as a two-year experiment , has recruited about 40 # 000 women and men since then . The eight recruitment agencies are all nonprofit organizations . Gustafson said the new regulations would spell the demise of the Laguna Beach agency because so few 21-year-old au_pairs are available . Currently , 63 % of his agency ' s au_pairs are between 18 and 20 years of_age , while only 37 % are 21 or older . Families often request an au_pair younger than 21 to avoid problems with alcohol consumption , said Margaret Dent , director of Au_Pair Program USA , in Salt_Lake_City . &quot; This magic_number of 21 is completely arbitrary , and it doesn ' t do a thing to protect the children , &quot; Dent said . &quot; It should be left to the family to choose which au_pair best fits their needs. &quot; More_than 60 % of eurAuPair ' s families have children under 2 years old . The agency is currently sponsoring 12 au_pairs with Orange County families and 100 statewide . Concerned parents have been calling their agencies nonstop since the regulations were announced . &quot; We have been flooded with phone_calls from families upset with the regulations the past couple of days , &quot; said Laura Blaskett , program director and vice_president of EF Au_Pair in Cambridge , Mass . &quot; I think families want the choice to choose the age of the au_pair and not be regulated by the government. &quot; But advocates for children say the new rules would help protect youngsters placed in the care of au_pairs . &quot; Regulations will weed out folks who may use the the au_pair program as just a cultural exchange or a ticket to the United State with housing , &quot; said Sharon Reuss , communications director at New York City ' s Child_Care Action Campaign , a national nonprofit organization working to improve child_care . &quot; It is important they understand they are undertaking a job to take_care of children placed in their care , that they are not just here to get the car keys and hit the bars. &quot; One of the main concern agencies is the possibility the new regulations will exclude middle-class parents and limit the au_pair program to the wealthy who can afford the added costs . Those who cannot afford an au_pair may turn_to illegal markets in Europe and Latin_America . Often those &quot; nannies &quot; do not have legal visas , and there is no recourse in the event of exploitation , critics say . Blaskett said her agency supports regulation , especially the required child_care training , but opposes increasing families ' costs . In addition to paying au_pairs a larger weekly allowance , families would be required to contribute $ 500 toward each worker ' s post-secondary studies . They currently contribute $ 300 . Under the new rules , the au_pairs would receive 16 hours of child-safety training before arriving in the United States and 24 hours of instruction in child_care and development upon arriving . The agencies would provide the training , but they say the cost will be added_to the fee families now pay upfront , which averages $ 3 # 500 for air fare , insurance , orientation and screening fees .</TEXT>
