   <HEADLINE> U.S. LEADERSHIP 50 YEARS LATER ; A CERTAINTY IS NOW OPEN TO DOUBT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings is an occasion to celebrate one of history ' s greatest military feats and to commemorate the memory of the thousands of soldiers -- American and allied -- who died achieving it . But the D-day anniversary is also an appropriate time to reflect on American leadership -- a leadership that today has been called into doubt as it has not since before World_War_II . When , just after midnight on June 6 , 1944 , U.S. paratroopers of the 101st and 82nd airborne divisions began landing near the village of Ste Mere-Eglise , their action marked a historic landmark : the emergence of the United States as the senior partner in the Western Alliance . In 1944 , American preeminence reflected a startling sea-change . During World_War I , despite our pivotal role in defeating Germany , the United States played junior partner to France and Great Britain . Even after our entry into World_War_II -- in December , 1941 -- we continued to defer to Britain , already at war with Adolf Hitler ' s Germany for more_than two years . By June , 1944 , however , the overwhelming preponderance of U.S. military might and industrial production had altered the Anglo-American relationship . Britain and our other allies , sometimes at extraordinary sacrifice , would play critical roles in final victory over the Axis . But American primacy within the Western Alliance was unchallenged . It would remain unchallenged -- despite occasional disputes among the allies -- through the remainder of World_War_II and the four decades of the Cold_War . Now , 50 years after D-day , that American leadership is in doubt . Ironically , it is not a foreign power that challenges American leadership . Indeed , the United States today enjoys both a security and stature unparalleled in modern history . Our global adversary of more_than 40 years , the Soviet_Union , is extinct . Its chief successor state , Russia , no longer represents a conventional threat to the United States or Western Europe . China , though an economic force and regional military power , is as yet incapable of exerting influence on a global basis . The United States also has no rivals for leadership among its partners in the Western Alliance . Despite economic strength , neither Germany nor Japan is prepared , for powerful historical reasons associated with their roles during World_War_II , to assume the mantle of Western leadership . And the European Union -- as revealed in the tragicomedy of its policy toward the Balkans -- does not possess the unity to assume a leadership role . Rather , it is U.S. foreign_policy itself that has called American global leadership into doubt . Granted , there have been some solid foreign-policy achievements in the last 18 months . The North_American Free_Trade Agreement was approved -- thanks , in large part , to the personal engagement , however belated , of President Bill_Clinton . Middle_East peace talks achieved a breakthrough with the historic Israeli-Palestine Liberation Organization accord -- a development inconceivable without U.S. efforts to pave the way . And the Administration has steered a staunchly pro-reform and pro-reformer course toward Russia . Elsewhere , however , U.S. foreign_policy is showing signs of disarray and drift -- in formulation and implementation . The Administration and its supporters argue that the nation confronts a far more complex world than it faced during the Cold_War . They are right . But that complexity , far from diminishing the need for U.S. leadership , increases it . In March , U.S. troops finally departed Somalia -- but not before enduring last October ' s tragedy in Mogadishu , a result of an ill-considered shift in U.S. objectives . The Administration ' s Bosnian policy , with its mismatch between rhetoric and reality , can be charitably described as confused . With Haiti , the Administration has reversed course again and embarked_on the latest policy of the month . On China , the Administration wants to have it both ways . For a year , it threatened to end most-favored-nation status if Beijing did not significantly improve its human-rights policies . China , of course , did nothing of the sort . But the Administration has extended MFN , anyway . And the Administration ' s stance toward North_Korea appears to reflect a weakening of the no-compromise approach on nuclear non-proliferation . During the Cold_War , U.S. relations with the Soviet_Union overshadowed all other foreign-policy concerns . Today , in contrast , no single issue possesses such salience . Instead , U.S. policy must address a range of issues -- none individually decisive but cumulatively representing a test of U.S. interests and influence . Similarly , it is the cumulative effect of U.S. foreign_policy that counts . And that effect , since the Clinton_Administration assumed office , has been mixed , at best . Constant shifts of policies , combined with rhetorical overreach , have rightly raised real concerns about U.S. resolve . Policies toward Haiti , Somalia , Bosnia , China and North_Korea have sent ambiguous signals about America ' s seriousness . As a result , there has been a perceptible erosion of U.S. credibility in Europe and elsewhere . That credibility is the coin of U.S. influence . Today it is being devalued . The decline in U.S. credibility , unless reversed , has three potentially major negative effects . First is among our allies . Since World_War_II , U.S. leadership has depended_on the trust allies could put_in America ' s word and the confidence they felt in our commitments . The more our rhetoric diverges from reality , the more that trust is undermined . And the more we resort_to empty threats , the more that confidence is diminished . There is already a murmur of criticism among our European allies . Unless action is taken_to signal clear U.S. resolve , it could become a chorus . Second , a perception of U.S. weakness will raise hopes among potential adversaries . Last year ' s fiasco in Port-au-Prince , when a_few dozen thugs caused the U.S. Navy to turn_tail , has plainly emboldened the military regime there and made more difficult the task of returning Haiti to representative government . An accommodationist line toward North_Korea will , similarly , not be lost on other would-be proliferators in such capitals as Tripoli , Tehran and Baghdad . Third , and perhaps most important , a foreign_policy in disarray undermines the domestic consensus in support of U.S. engagement abroad . That popular support , forged during World_War_II and sustained -- despite the interruption of Vietnam -- in the decades that followed , remains a precondition of effective U.S. foreign_policy . The Administration is not isolationist . Its stated foreign-policy objectives fall , by and large , within the internationalist tradition that reaches back to Franklin D . Roosevelt . Nonetheless , foreign-policy missteps are playing into the hands of isolationists of the political left and right . A recent poll revealed less than 15 % of Americans have a clear idea of the country ' s foreign_policy . This is bad news -- not just for the Administration , but for U.S. foreign_policy . Americans , it seems , are confused just when they need to understand most clearly America ' s stakes in the post-Cold War era . The case for U.S. engagement abroad is compelling for any number of political , economic and historic reasons . But , as the polls make distressingly clear , the Administration has yet to make_it . As we watch the grainy newsreel footage of Utah and Omaha beaches , we cannot avoid being struck by how the world has changed since the summer of 1944 . Americans of 1944 -- at the front and at_home -- possessed a certainty and optimism that seem so distant today . The Germany we spent so_much blood and treasure to defeat 50 years ago is today one of our most trusted allies . But one thing remains a constant , then as now : the need for U.S. leadership . A half century after D-day , the United States has achieved a unique position of power and prestige in world affairs . Attaining that position , as this week ' s anniversary reminds us , took leadership . So , too , will maintaining it. * A ROGUE ' S GALLERY ? It didn ' t begin with Dan Rostenkowski .
