   <HEADLINE> ARAFAT PLEDGES TO FIGHT TERRORISM AGAINST ISRAELIS ; MIDEAST : HIS RESPONSE TO U.S. PUSH MEETS THE JEWISH STATE ' S MINIMUM DEMAND FOR PULLING TROOPS FROM WEST_BANK CITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , responding to a firm push from U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , promised Wednesday that his self-rule government will do all it can to stop terrorism against Israelis , meeting Israel ' s minimum demand for pulling its troops out of West_Bank cities . &quot; We are looking_to have very quickly elections , but at_the_same_time we are putting into consideration the needs of security for the Israelis , and we are ready to discuss it in detail with them , &quot; Arafat said , as Christopher stood next to him in the seaside headquarters of the Palestinian Authority . The Palestine Liberation Organization chairman ' s carefully worded pledge was prompted by Christopher , who said Tuesday that Israel cannot be expected to withdraw its West_Bank occupation force until the security of Israelis is assured . Israeli officials have hinted that they will delay or cancel the pullout if a recent spate of terrorist incidents continues . Under the terms of the peace agreement approved by Arafat and Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , Israel is required to withdraw its troops from Palestinian cities and towns in_advance of Palestinian elections . Israel and the PLO are negotiating in Cairo over the date and the conditions for the elections . The Israeli Cabinet , meanwhile , debated for a second day the future of Jewish settlements in the West_Bank after Israeli forces are pulled_back , but the ministers were apparently divided over whether to uproot the communities , many of them small and isolated . Christopher traveled in a bulletproof car on the two-hour trip from Jerusalem to Gaza to hold a meeting of just under an hour with Arafat . U.S. officials said Christopher ' s visit was intended to help Arafat reverse his plummeting popularity with the Palestinian public , although the officials conceded that Washington has no friends and little influence among anti-Arafat extremists . Nevertheless , both the United States and Israel believe that the success of the peace process is linked to Arafat ' s political strength . The PLO chairman is beset by festering problems , including friction with Israel , a shortage of funds for self-government and bloody conflict between his police and anti-Arafat Islamic fundamentalists . &quot; I came_to Gaza again today to demonstrate the importance the United States attaches_to the success of the Palestinian self-government , &quot; said Christopher , who returned to Jerusalem afterward . Underlining Arafat ' s security pledge , Christopher said the PLO chairman &quot; made_it clear that he understands the responsibilities and commitments that he has undertaken in the ( peace pact ) and that he intends to carry_out those responsibilities against terror and violence. &quot; A senior U.S. official said later that the Israelis realize that the Palestinian police cannot wipe_out the terrorism that the Israeli police and army have been unable to stop for decades . However , the official said , Israel wants to be assured that the authority will do all it can to deal with the problem . Christopher ' s visit to Gaza came less than a week after the World_Bank and other international aid donors agreed at a U.S.-sponsored conference to give the Palestinian Authority more_than $ 100 million to balance its budget through March 31 . In exchange , Arafat agreed to reforms designed to ensure that the money would be properly spent . Christopher later said the session was &quot; the best meeting I ' ve ever had &quot; with Arafat , a U.S. official said . The official added that Arafat was upbeat about his negotiations with Israel pending a meeting today with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres . Arafat meets Saturday in Oslo with Rabin as he and the prime_minister receive the Nobel Peace Prize for their peace accord . Meanwhile , U.S. officials said Rabin and Syrian President Hafez Assad assured Christopher that they will end a spate of pessimistic assessments of their U.S.-mediated peace talks . In recent weeks , both officials have complained that the negotiations are nearing a dead_end . &quot; I am convinced that creating a more pleasant and calm atmosphere , with fewer bombastic pronouncements , will allow_for the return of an atmosphere that will provide a chance for furthering the process , &quot; Rabin said after a morning meeting in Jerusalem with Christopher . Rabin said Christopher ' s meetings Tuesday in Damascus , Syria , had nudged the two sides a bit closer to a peace agreement . Christopher returns to the United States today without going_back to Damascus to report on his meetings with Rabin . Rabin has emphasized repeatedly that no Israeli settlement would be removed under the agreements signed so far with the PLO , but other ministers told the Cabinet session that communities that pose security risks , either for the residents or the troops guarding them , should be moved .
