   <HEADLINE> RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT : THERE ' S NO PLACE FOR EDDIE AT THE LAPD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Scene : Sunday night at Mann ' s Chinese Theatre , for the premiere of &quot; Beverly Hills Cop III , &quot; starring Eddie Murphy as the lovable ninja cop from Detroit . Who needs Westec with this guy around ? The Paramount Pictures release opens Wednesday . The party on the Paramount lot featured a street fair complete with Ferris wheel , ring toss , stuffed animals and a bandstand . So what if the streets were lined with New York brownstones and Madison Avenue storefronts ? The event raised $ 100 # 000 for the United Negro College Fund . * You Never Know These Days : The squad_car at the entrance was somebody ' s idea of a party_favor . The Ferris wheel drew a big crowd , even though the film features an amusement-ride disaster in which Murphy ' s character leaps from car to car to save small children . &quot; I admire Eddie , &quot; said actor-director Robert Townsend , &quot; but at least I can claim that I do all my own stunts. &quot; * Who Was There : Stars Murphy , Theresa Randle , Bronson Pinchot and director John Landis were feted by Wesley Snipes , Vanessa Bell-Calloway , Andrew Dice Clay , Natalie Cole , Debbie Allen , Terence Trent D ' Arby and Sugar Ray Leonard . Police_Chief Willie L . Williams appeared broad-shouldered and capable . He would n ' t hire Murphy for the LAPD , he joked , &quot; but give me some of those high-tech weapons ! &quot; ( We ' re assuming he meant some of those Uzis that aren ' t able to hit good_guys , rather than the Boombox-Toaster-Flamethrower. ) * Get a Clue : Along Came Mary catered a cuisine of peach barbecued ribs , fried chicken , potato_salad and slaw , with Rice Krispie squares and candy_apples for dessert . More frightening than the squad_car . The pasta bar was working overtime . * Scarier Still : Wayne Newton was the best-dressed person in_attendance , downright imposing in a charcoal suit , lemon shirt , cuffs and collar . Co-star Randle also cut a figure in diaphanous white , while everyone else seemed to have dashed out of the brownstones for a carton of milk . * Entertaining : Deejay Michael Nesmith careened smartly from Salt N ' Pepa on back to ' 70s George Clinton . * Wave of the Future : Child group Immature , three swaggering 10-year-olds in baggy denim and John Lennon sunglasses , who conclude interviews with a hug and a kiss .</TEXT>
