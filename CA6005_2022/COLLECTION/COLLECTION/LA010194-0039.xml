   <HEADLINE> ISRAELI OFFICIAL MAPS NEXT STEPS ON LONG ROAD TO PEACE ; STRATEGY : BEILIN , ' BIG PICTURE ' MAN FOR RABIN , IS OUTSPOKEN AND CONTROVERSIAL IN LOOKING TO FUTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even as negotiators for Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization struggle with tough , detailed planning for the first stage of Palestinian self-government , Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin is moving fast down the road toward resolution of the whole Middle_East conflict . Beilin sees a peace for Israel with all its neighbors , an emerging confederation of Palestine and Jordan , a new regional economy and much more . He draws verbal lines on the map to highlight Israel ' s true security concerns , not to say its future borders . He tells Jewish settlers in the West_Bank that they may be able to remain only under Arab sovereignty . He envisions a functional division within Jerusalem . And he warns there will not be peace with Syria , or the Arab world , while Israel remains in the Golan Heights . &quot; Want to know where ( Prime_Minister ) Yitzhak Rabin is taking Israel ? &quot; goes one political commentary common here . &quot; Just listen to Yossi Beilin. &quot; Beilin , in fact , is one of the long-term strategists of Rabin ' s government , the man who even before the Labor_Party won the June , 1992 , parliamentary elections set_up the &quot; Oslo connection &quot; for talking with the PLO and who oversaw the negotiations on Palestinian autonomy . &quot; The ' morning after , ' the next step , is what I try to focus_on , &quot; Beilin said in an interview in his Foreign Ministry office . &quot; The next step_in the negotiations for a comprehensive peace , the next step_in a new Middle_East and the next step , too , in a new agenda for Israel. &quot; This long-range focus has him looking_at the impasse in peace negotiations with Syria , at negotiations with the Palestinians over the long-term future of the occupied West_Bank and Gaza Strip and on realistic prospects for regional cooperation . These involve fundamental questions such_as Israel ' s retreat to borders approaching those it had before the 1967 Middle_East War and establishment of a Palestinian state . But he is also looking_at such practical matters as linking electrical grids , instituting cross-border environmental protection , sharing water resources and building networks of railroads , highways and pipelines . For most Israelis , Beilin has been maddeningly frank on what it will take_to achieve peace and almost utopian on where it will lead . &quot; The first reaction to what Beilin says is usually anger , but in the end the government is pulled_along after him , &quot; said Yoel Marcus , a leading political commentator . &quot; This is not because he is a prophet but because the line he has advocated reveals itself as the only operational path that a government that wants to be different from the ( opposition ) Likud can take . . . . Believe him -- in the end , all will form along his line. &quot; Beilin himself is characteristically frank about what he calls his role . &quot; My job is to speak out and to tell you the truth without any coating , &quot; he told members of Israel ' s kibbutz movement recently . &quot; I participate in making decisions , but I also define ( the issues ) . There is nothing more gravely wrong , as I see it , than keeping quiet at this time . A public figure who remains silent now betrays his post. &quot; But in his outspokenness and role as a political strategist , Beilin is one of the most controversial figures in the Rabin government . Cabinet colleagues have called_on the prime_minister to fire him . &quot; One statement by Beilin , not even 10 ministers can fix , &quot; Economics Minister Shimon Shetreet declared after Beilin commented on the future of West_Bank settlements and Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights . A vice_president of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , the hard-edged , pro-Israel lobbying group in Washington , called him &quot; a little slime ball &quot; last summer after Beilin told visiting congressmen that Israel would withdraw extensively from the West_Bank in a peace settlement . And Rabin once called him &quot; Peres ' poodle , &quot; alluding to Beilin ' s long association -- now almost 17 years -- with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , a Rabin rival within the Labor_Party . Yet Beilin stays , and political insiders believe it is precisely because Rabin knows that Beilin can plot the path the government must follow if it is to achieve peace . Beilin ' s critics &quot; can scream to the stars , &quot; said Marcus , long a Rabin confidant , but &quot; the logic of Yossi Beilin will be victorious . Not because he created this logic , but rather because he breaks_into the intellectual vacuum of the government . . . . Beilin knows exactly what the next steps of the government must be but is not sure whether Rabin is clear about where he is going. &quot; The problem , Marcus added , is that &quot; one cannot buy half of Beilin ' s strategy &quot; for the Palestinian issue . &quot; Either you adopt it fully , that is go all_the way , or you do not go anywhere and start to lose_control over the situation. &quot; Now 45 , Beilin was a journalist with the Labor_Party newspaper Davar when Peres , then the party leader , asked him to become party spokesman a_few months after Labor ' s loss to Likud in 1977 ; with a doctorate in political_science from Tel Aviv University , Beilin moved_into policy planning . Over the past decade , he has served as Cabinet secretary , director general of the Foreign Ministry , deputy finance_minister and deputy foreign_minister -- always as Peres ' idea and point_man , one of &quot; The Blazers , &quot; the bright young_men Peres gathered around him who wore uniform dark_blue jackets . When Labor was campaigning against Likud in the 1992 elections , Beilin was already planning for &quot; the morning after , &quot; in this case the first 100 days of the new government . &quot; Not everyone needs to be involved in the campaign , &quot; he said . &quot; That would not be a proper division of labor . Some should be thinking_about what to do if we win . . . because it ' s important to retain the momentum of the victory . We lose time dealing with issues bit by bit. &quot; The sharp attacks on him do hurt , Beilin acknowledged . But after urging direct negotiations with the PLO and establishment of a Palestinian state in &quot; Gaza first &quot; and taking other avant-garde stands_in the late 1980s , he is accustomed to criticism . If there were no controversy about the positions he took , Beilin said , he would worry more . &quot; If I am saying something and there is a consensus , I worry that it ' s wrong , &quot; he said . &quot; There is nothing worse than ' group think , ' and if I am not challenging the conventional , then I am not doing my job . . . . In the work I do , if I am not forced to defend my positions , I worry that I may , in fact , be wrong . I am used to a staff that objects , not a group of yes men . If I can convince my colleagues , the ideas are really tested. &quot; The difficulties in concluding an agreement with the PLO on implementing the accord on self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho has allowed many &quot; we-told-you-so &quot; Israelis to blame Beilin -- but he is already moving_on . &quot; We know that there will be a compromise over the size of Jericho , say , and on the other issues , &quot; he said . &quot; If I am negotiating , I strive to do my best . If I am not , then I focus elsewhere . . . . Once the Declaration of Principles was signed and the agreement reached on mutual recognition , there was a need to look ahead two or three more steps. &quot; This is what has plunged Beilin into so_much controversy recently , because it means thinking_about what comes_after the five years of Palestinian autonomy and how not only to safeguard Israel ' s interests but to ensure a stable settlement . &quot; Even with present difficulties , I believe we can have a comprehensive peace in a matter of months , not years , in the Middle_East , &quot; Beilin said . &quot; There has never been a better opportunity to make_peace in this part of the world , but it might be a relatively short opportunity. &quot; He envisions a Palestinian-Jordanian confederation following the transitional , five-year period in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . Borders would have to be negotiated , arrangements worked_out for the security of Jewish communities that remain after Israel ' s withdrawal from the territories and the status of Jerusalem resolved . All are difficult issues , and Beilin resorts_to rare blandness in an interview to avoid generating further criticism . &quot; Not useful right now , not useful , &quot; he replied when pressed_on the future of Jerusalem , declared by Israel to be the &quot; united and eternal capital of the Jewish people &quot; but claimed in part by Palestinians as their capital too . But there is a timetable , Beilin noted , for settling these issues because Israel is committed to discussing them all_in two years and reaching an agreement within five . Negotiations with Syria will be &quot; very tough indeed , &quot; he said , adding that there had been little progress in the past year and a half and much would depend_on the ability of the Clinton_Administration to coax Syrian President Hafez Assad into real discussions . Depending_on Assad ' s commitment to peace , Israel is prepared to negotiate its withdrawal from the Golan Heights in terms of geographical extent , time , security measures , international observers and demilitarization . &quot; The solution is not very obscure if there is a will on both sides , &quot; Beilin said . &quot; I know we have the will on our side , and I hope there is a similar will on theirs. &quot; Negotiations with Jordan and Lebanon can proceed whenever those countries wish , Beilin said , but they appear to be waiting to see how Israel and the Palestinians proceed on the autonomy plan and whether Syria pursues real peace talks . After peace_treaties will come another &quot; morning after , &quot; Beilin said . &quot; If there is peace and nothing changes in people ' s lives , then there will be even greater frustrations , &quot; he said . &quot; Expectations are very high . People refer to peace as a kind of redemption from all_the problems in the world . We have to think , separately and together , about how to meet these expectations. &quot; Under Beilin ' s leadership , Israel has begun pushing other countries in the multilateral Mideast negotiations to look_at practical cooperation , such_as building a common infrastructure , to lay the foundation in time for regional economic development . &quot; Despite all_the talk , I don ' t think we will see an common_market in the Middle_East very soon , if ever , &quot; he said . &quot; Our economies , not just Arab and Israeli but among the Arabs , are far too diverse for that . There are other ways to cooperate , and we will need to look_at them realistically. &quot; The &quot; morning after &quot; peace will also mean a new agenda for Israel , he said . &quot; Security is now No . 1 for us , and so_much so there is no real No . 2 , &quot; he said . &quot; If we are so blessed that we have no enemies -- that ' s the goal of peace -- what is No . 1 ? &quot; In a target-oriented society like Israel , it is important that we have an agenda , something to do. &quot; Beilin has items of_his_own for that agenda : relations between Israel and the rapidly assimilating Jews of the Diaspora , particularly in North_America ; a restructuring of outmoded Israeli institutions such_as the Jewish Agency , the trade_union federation and the Labor_Party itself ; a role for Israel in international human_rights and peacekeeping organizations . &quot; Israel , freed_of its necessary obsession with security , will evolve rapidly into a liberal social_democracy , much like the Nordic countries , &quot; Beilin predicted . &quot; We need to start planning for that ' morning after ' even while we deal with today ' s , tomorrow ' s and even yesterday ' s problems. &quot;</TEXT>
