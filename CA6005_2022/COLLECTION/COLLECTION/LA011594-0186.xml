   <TEXT> As the Channel_Tunnel between England and France prepares to open , one wary ferry operator has come_up with a way to defend its turf , or surf rather . With Big Macs . Stena Sealink , which stands to lose millions of passengers on its Dover-to-Calais route , says a McDonald ' s restaurant will be available on its Stena Fantasia ferry by the end of the month . The tunnel , which opens May 8 to passenger traffic , is pitching a quicker crossing of the_English Channel -- about 35 minutes . The boat takes an hour longer . But , pointed_out Gareth Cooper , Stena Sealink ' s managing director , families will be attracted by the ferry ' s new offering . &quot; They ' ll never be able to buy a Big Mac on a Channel_Tunnel train. &quot;</TEXT>
