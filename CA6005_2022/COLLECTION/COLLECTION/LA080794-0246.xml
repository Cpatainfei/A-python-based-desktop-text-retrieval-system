   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; IS END TO O.C. BASE ISSUE NEAR OR IS THIS JUST ANOTHER TWIST ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For more_than a year now , the debate over the future of El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station has taken more dips and turns than the wildest , creakiest political roller-coaster ride anywhere in Orange County . Competing egos and agendas have constantly threatened to throw the base conversion planning off track . And whenever there was the slightest chance that a communitywide consensus might be possible , the battle for power over the base would take another turn -- a threatened lawsuit by those opposed to a commercial airport at El Toro , followed by a wild spin leading to a November ballot initiative asking county voters to approve an airport . Suddenly , there ' s a new twist : The powerful Irvine Co . may be making a move toward ownership of the 4 # 700-acre base -- the largest piece of Orange County property that holds the promise of a development bonanza . Under a plan disclosed late last week , the Irvine Co . and the federal_government are discussing a land swap in which the development firm would take possession of the base in exchange for large parcels of wilderness that it owns near the Cleveland National Forest . Environmentalists have identified 10 # 000 acres of northern Orange County land that could become part of the trade . The news of the potential land swap immediately set_off speculation among various political factions that have wrestled for control of the military base because they disagree over whether a commercial airport should be developed there . Is this just another leg in this tumultuous political journey , or is it the solution that can help end the unusual political battle that has split Orange County in half ? The answer to that question depends_on who is asked . Key county officials -- who were criticized early on for not taking the lead in developing a post-military plan and were forced to give_up sole control of the issue -- see the Irvine Co. ' s involvement as a way to shortcut the debate and settle the issue once and for all . Some county supervisors say that if the base reverts to private ownership and remains in an unincorporated area of the county , then the Board of Supervisors could regain its place as the only land-use authority over the property . Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder said the land-exchange proposal should be taken as vote of &quot; no confidence &quot; in the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority , a multi-agency group formed out of political friction that is now attempting to devise a redevelopment plan for El Toro . &quot; I think people don ' t see any hope in the process established here , and they began to look_for other options , &quot; Wieder said . &quot; It ' s a reflection of the political integrity of the planning authority as an objective policy-making body. &quot; A Washington base closure expert said privately that the Irvine Co. ' s possible ownership of the base &quot; appears to cut_out the community &quot; input , which would be &quot; most unfortunate. &quot; Should the county try to exert control over the land , it can expect strong opposition from South County city officials who begrudgingly signed_on to the El Toro planning_board , which includes the county supervisors , three Irvine council_members and one representative from Lake Forest . &quot; I think there ' s a severe question about ( the county having sole authority over the property ) , &quot; said Irvine Councilman Barry J . Hammond . &quot; If , in fact , it goes_to private ownership , we will move ahead on annexation ( of the base ) . &quot; Hammond said his city joined the planning authority board after receiving a commitment from the county to help Irvine annex the base , which lies within the city ' s sphere_of_influence . Hammond said the city plans to hold the county to that pledge . Hammond , Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph and Laguna Beach Councilman Wayne L . Peterson also maintained that the Defense_Department already has recognized the planning authority board as the official planning group . &quot; Just because the property_owner ' s name changes doesn ' t mean there will be a change in the development process , &quot; Peterson said . The early euphoria over the Irvine Co. ' s possible involvement in the issue has led one anti-airport activist to caution against moving too hastily . Doyle Selden , a resident of Leisure World of Laguna Hills and a member of the anti-airport group called Taxpayers for Responsible Planning , said planning studies now underway should be completed before any deal is struck with the Irvine Co . or any airport initiative is approved by voters . &quot; We are really upset with the simplistic statements which are made , &quot; Selden said . &quot; It ' s completely clear to us that the more complex this is , the more we need a planning process. &quot; Pete Ciesla , the Navy ' s El Toro base closure coordinator , agreed that the planning authority board would probably continue to help guide the base ' s future use , even if the property ends_up in private hands . &quot; You still need to evaluate the impacts and look_at things like ( traffic ) circulation , &quot; he said . But those who favor the development of a commercial airport at El Toro see it another way . &quot; The ( local planning ) process has all but fallen_apart , &quot; said Newport Beach Mayor Clarence J . Turner , a strong El Toro airport advocate . &quot; If the base is given to the Irvine Co. , you can pretty much forget about the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority. &quot; Instead of worrying over whether the land should become an airport , Turner said the county should begin negotiating a plan with the Irvine Co. , on behalf of its cities , to share revenue from a commercial airport should the giant developer decide on that option . There also is a new debate over the effect the Irvine Co. ' s involvement might have_on the November ballot initiative that asks voters to approve a commercial aviation and cargo facility on 2 # 000 acres of the base . Newport Beach developer Buck Johns , one of the initiative backers , said the latest development should not impact the November election . &quot; The Irvine Co . has been unusually quiet on this issue , &quot; Johns said , &quot; but you have to stand_back and ask what would enhance the value of the property already owned by the Irvine Co . around the airport . The answer to that is an airport. &quot; Wieder said this new twist may prompt more interest in the Nov . 8 ballot initiative . &quot; I think people see that everybody is getting their two cents in , so why shouldn ' t they , too ? &quot; Wieder said . &quot; This is a time for people to determine what the public policy should be , because there is no faith or confidence in the process already established. &quot; Local land-use attorney James E . Erickson , who previously worked_on the El Toro issue , said that the initiative , if approved by voters , would be legally binding -- no matter who owns the land -- because it proposes a zoning regulation that the Board of Supervisors would have to follow . What makes the situation unusual , he added , is that even before the county gets land-use authority of the property , the federal_government can impose conditions on how it will be used before the transfer is made . &quot; I know that the real power lies_in the County of Orange and the Department_of_Defense , and if they don ' t agree , nothing happens , &quot; Erickson said . &quot; The initiative totally governs what the county does. &quot; But Hammond disagreed . &quot; The ballot initiative is nothing but an expensive opinion poll , &quot; the Irvine councilman said . &quot; There ' s no way it can be enforced . This ballot initiative , at best , would force the County of Orange to change their general plan to say there ' s an airport at El Toro . However , that has no binding effect on the Department of Defense. &quot; Given the acrimony over one of the biggest land-use decisions facing Orange County , some have speculated that it might be in the federal_government ' s best interest to turn the land over to the Irvine Co. , even if it does not get any money in return . The federal_government hopes to sell bases to offset the environmental cleanup costs that come_with closing them , but the relocation of the military to other installations and protracted legal or political fights between local factions threaten to delay the transfer of the property indefinitely . The proposed land swap , officials said , would eliminate the political hassles . Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez said it was too early to speculate about the political fallout such a plan could trigger . &quot; There is no verdict in on what the reuse of the base should be , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s not about winners or losers . As fast as this ( proposal ) came_up , it could change next week . That has been one of the traits of the whole process . The one thing that I have always underscored in this process is not to underestimate the role of the federal government. &quot; Few are publicly questioning the Irvine Co. ' s motives at this point , although for months many involved in the issue wondered why the development giant had remained silent for so_long , particularly since it already owns nearly all_the land that rings the base . Assemblyman Gil Ferguson ( R-Newport Beach ) , a former vice_president of the Irvine Co. , said he remembers hearing how the company ' s founder became enraged with the federal_government at the start of World_War_II when the company was forced under the War Powers Act to sell the land for $ 950 # 000 . &quot; I think it ' s quite normal for the Irvine Co . to begin negotiations with the federal_government , &quot; Ferguson said . &quot; After all , the property belonged_to the Irvine Co. &quot; However , Ferguson and Assemblyman Mickey Conroy ( R-Orange ) said these negotiations may be meaningless , predicting that the Marines would never leave El Toro because the federal_government cannot afford the move . Former Irvine Mayor Larry Agran , who earlier this year suggested a slightly different land swap between the Irvine Co . and the federal_government , predicted that ultimately even the latest proposal would be doomed by the sour politics that has dogged the base reuse issue . &quot; There are naysayers who would rather fight over this thing for the next 20 years than make arrangements with a master developer to oversee development on a planned basis , &quot; Agran said . Times staff writers Kevin Johnson and Eric Bailey and correspondent Shelby Grad contributed to this report .</TEXT>
