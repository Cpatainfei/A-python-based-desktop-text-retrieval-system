   <TEXT> If Gene Kelly had any weakness for sentiment , you might expect to find it here , in the massive Craftsman-style home on Rodeo Drive he has owned , well , as long as he can remember . Ten years ago it burned to the ground while Kelly and his three college-age children stood on the lawn and watched the flames reduce a career ' s worth of artifacts and memorabilia , including his one_and_only Oscar , to ash . &quot; Oh , I lost_it all , &quot; says Kelly , cheerfully gesturing around the spacious , oak-paneled living_room that is , with the exception of a new marble fireplace , an exact replica . &quot; I wanted to move to a smaller house , &quot; he adds , nodding at his wife , Pat Ward , a slender woman in her 30s whom Kelly married in 1990 . &quot; ( Pat ) would have helped me fix_up a new house . But the kids cried and moaned , so I built it again. &quot; Say this for Kelly , as a dancer , choreographer and director whose career spans more_than half-a-century reaching back to Broadway ' s and Hollywood ' s Golden Age : He has managed to blend a respect for tradition and an audience ' s wishes with an iconoclast ' s eye for opportunity . He wasn ' t a rich dancer of the top_hat and tails variety -- that was the province of the classicists , like his friend Fred Astaire -- but what he did was rich . In his working-man clothes and trademark white socks , Kelly remade dance on film from a European art_form into an American one with his snappy paper-tearing , roller-skating , puddle-stomping footwork . A masculine , athletic dance style he called it , offering it to his employer . And Hollywood returned the favor . Between 1942 and 1960 , he made 34 films , almost all_of them for MGM during the studio ' s heyday , and many of them -- &quot; Singin ' in the Rain , &quot; &quot; On the Town , &quot; &quot; An American in Paris &quot; -- are among the best musicals ever . At 81 , Kelly is the oldest surviving alumnus of the studio ' s fabled roster of &quot; more stars than there are in heaven. &quot; He doesn ' t dance anymore , a concession to a bad leg and his years , but then again , Kelly will confess that his body , &quot; the dancer ' s instrument , &quot; wasn ' t what it was even in 1954 when he made &quot; Brigadoon , &quot; his last great musical for MGM , when he was 43 . &quot; Oh , it all starts to go soon enough , &quot; he says , his voice raspy , but his bright eyes a ticket back to the ' 40s . Now , in his own elegant twilight , Kelly is dapperly dressed in a white turtleneck , a heavy , expensive-looking navy cardigan and , reassuringly , pale socks . He looks as if he had just come_in from rehearsal . Despite his long reign as one of Hollywood ' s true royalty , Kelly seems genuinely pleased to be the subject of an interview . He is polite , even gallant , inquiring about his visitor ' s hometown and accompanying his guest to and from the front_door . Although the phone seems to ring almost constantly , Kelly says most days are spent quietly at_home alone with his wife , with whom he is working_on his autobiography . &quot; We don ' t go_out much , &quot; he says , &quot; although there is a dinner tonight and in a_couple_of weeks the premiere for the film &quot; -- &quot; that ' s Entertainment ! III. &quot; The second sequel to &quot; that ' s Entertainment ! , &quot; the popular 1974 anthology of MGM musicals , &quot; that ' s Entertainment ! III &quot; will open in New York and Los Angeles Friday . Directed and produced by Bud Friedgen and Michael J . Sheridan , who edited the first two versions , the film features onscreen appearances by Kelly and several other MGM legends including Esther Williams , Lena Horne , Cyd Charisse , Debbie Reynolds , Ann Miller and Mickey Rooney recalling their years at the storied studio . In addition to the oral history , the film is distinguished by a surprisingly puckish tone with the inclusion of several , frequently hilarious outtakes from such films as &quot; Annie Get Your Gun , &quot; &quot; Easter Parade &quot; and &quot; The Band Wagon. &quot; The film makes instructive use of split-screen images and jump-cut editing as the never-before-seen numbers careen from the_sublime ( Judy Garland in her signature tuxedo jacket and impossibly long legs singing &quot; Mr. Monotony &quot; in a scene cut from &quot; Easter Parade &quot; ) to the ridiculous ( a family of singing contortionists , the Ross sisters , and an absurdly overproduced underwater sequence in which Esther Williams brings some Greek statues to life ) . Occasionally , the scenes border_on the surreal : a split-screen comparison between Cyd Charisse ' s sinuous rendition of &quot; Two Faced Woman &quot; and Joan Crawford ' s disquietingly campy version -- in tropical makeup -- that was used in &quot; Torch Song. &quot; As &quot; that ' s Entertainment ! III &quot; ably demonstrates , MGM frequently misused its massive talent pool -- a fact that seems to delight Kelly , whose offscreen response to this latest anthology is rather more roguish than his stately onscreen narration bookending the film . He quarrels with the film ' s premise -- &quot; I think the best scenes have already been taken_in the first one and Part 2 , &quot; says Kelly , who directed &quot; that ' s Entertainment ! Part 2 &quot; in 1976 . He also insists that only &quot; movie buffs &quot; will be fascinated by this fourth trip to the MGM well ( &quot; that ' s Dancing ! &quot; in 1985 also culled clips from MGM musicals ) , but he clearly relishes the film ' s funniest-home-video approach , which he considers much-needed comeuppance for the once-mighty studio . &quot; MGM never wanted to admit that any force in the world could hold them back , &quot; says Kelly , who spends much of the conversation debunking some of the myths , &quot; canards , &quot; he calls them , about the studio ' s so-called Golden Age . Indeed , beyond his memories , a rich repository in an industry fascinated by its own gilt-edged beginnings , Kelly retains a certain cantankerous pride -- not for MGM , its fabled contract system or Louis B . Mayer , the studio ' s legendary , voluble founder -- but for the sheer doing of it . &quot; There was no model for what I tried to do with dance , &quot; he says , slipping into an armchair and launching into one of several , sharply observed stories he will tell during the course of an hour . &quot; And the thing Fred and I used to bitch about was that critics didn ' t know how to categorize us . They called us tap_dancers because that was considered the American style . But neither of us were basically tap_dancers . And people would compare us , but we didn ' t dance alike at all ! Fred danced in tails -- everybody wore them before I came_out here -- but I took_off my coat , rolled_up my sleeves and danced in sweatshirts and jeans and khakis. &quot; He was one of the studio ' s A-list players during the second_half of MGM ' s glory days , the years from 1928 to 1959 when Mayer ' s studio was the largest and most powerful in town . He arrived already a star -- from the 1941 Broadway show &quot; Pal Joey &quot; -- initially under contract with David O . Selznick and then , quickly , with MGM , the largest employer of musical talent in Hollywood , where he made his first film in 1942 , &quot; For Me and My Gal , &quot; with Judy Garland . &quot; When I came_out here , I thought stars were Gary Cooper or John Wayne , &quot; Kelly recalls . &quot; I didn ' t see myself as one of them . And I had it in my contract to do one picture and then go_back to Broadway , go_back to the theater. &quot; As a stage-trained song_and_dance man , Kelly preferred New York ; Hollywood at the time &quot; was just a bunch of orange groves , &quot; as he remembers it . &quot; I didn ' t like the whole ambience of the town. &quot; It wasn ' t until Kelly was loaned to Columbia Pictures , where he starred opposite Rita Hayworth in 1944 ' s hit &quot; Cover_Girl , &quot; that Kelly ' s film career hit what he calls &quot; the turning point , when MGM said , ' Wait a minute , this guy dances with girls. ' They called me back and put me to work with leading ladies -- Esther Williams , Kathryn Grayson -- and other non-dancers. &quot; Although he would become one of the greatest dance partners Hollywood ever produced , it was the kind of studio decision-making that rankled Kelly . &quot; One of the things I loved ( about &quot; that ' s Entertainment ! III &quot; ) was seeing the ladies , if I may use that term -- Judy , Esther , Cyd -- looking so young and talented , &quot; he says , &quot; because MGM always had a thing that the studio made the pictures and not the creative people , that the films just sort of appeared from the Thalberg Building. &quot; It was the era of the studio mogul , an autocracy he remembers with mixed feelings . &quot; We felt Hollywood was a smaller community , although I don ' t know that it actually was the case since we made more pictures than are made today , &quot; he says . &quot; But the studios were more self-contained with their own A-list and B-list actors , and then underneath them , the people they would keep around on scale . Some of those people were old silent_movie stars like May McAvoy , whom I worshiped as a boy . MGM kept her on as an extra and I choked_back a little sob to see what Hollywood could do to its people . No studio would even give D.W. Griffith a consulting job toward the end of his career and he died in poverty while they paid guys to just walk the halls and say , ' I ' ve got an idea. ' &quot; All the executives -- Mayer , Sam Goldwyn , Darryl Zanuck -- thought they could create stars , so they all pretended that everybody sang and did their own taps when most of the actors just faked it , &quot; says Kelly , who was routinely asked to dub tap-dancing sound_effects . &quot; MGM would never publicly admit that in my generation , but for the first time , that ' s acknowledged in this film. &quot; It was all part of MGM ' s relentless search to find the next Greta Garbo or Rita Hayworth , &quot; but of course only the public can do that , &quot; says Kelly , recalling that he was forced to write a pool scene for Esther Williams in &quot; Take Me Out to the Ball_Game &quot; when studio executives insisted she be in the film , &quot; because they told us all baseball pictures flop and all Esther Williams ' films are hits. &quot; In another instance of MGM ' s heavy hand , Kelly recalls when &quot; Mayer teamed me with the actress he considered the next Jean Harlow &quot; -- Marie McDonald -- &quot; and she turned_out to be a triple threat who couldn ' t sing , dance or act . Of course , the picture ( 1947 ' s ' Living in a Big Way ' ) was a terrible bomb . You couldn ' t give it away with china. &quot; Anecdotes notwithstanding , Kelly retains no lost love for MGM executives , especially Mayer . &quot; I hated the man , &quot; he says simply . &quot; I thought he was bizarre and he never liked me . Fortunately , I never dealt directly with him , and , of course , I made the studio money. &quot; What Kelly found more to his liking were the kindred creative spirits he found among MGM ' s fleet of contract performers -- not just his famous co-stars , but the dozens of behind-the-scenes artists , professional arrangers , orchestrators and composers , many of them European artists who took refuge from World_War_II in Hollywood . &quot; MGM had a great studio orchestra and we worked with a lot of the same arrangers although they weren ' t exclusive to MGM , because there were other studios , like Warners , that were also doing musicals , &quot; Kelly recalls . &quot; But fellows like ( Arnold ) Schoenberg and ( Artur ) Rubinstein came_to the studio often , and a lot of the arrangers had studied in France with Michel Legrand ' s teachers . They were geniuses with strings , guys like Conrad Salinger . We were very lucky to have that kind of talent around. &quot; Indeed , like his role at MGM , Kelly was something of a catalyst offscreen . He was married first to actress Betsy Blair ( whom he divorced ) and then to Jeanne Coyne , a dance instructor at MGM ( who died more_than 20 years ago ) ; his Rodeo Drive_home was the scene for many_a gathering of what he calls &quot; MGM ' s elite. &quot; &quot; Old_age and death have weaned away a lot of my generation , &quot; he says a bit wistfully but also matter-of-factly . &quot; We had a whole gang , Oscar Levant and Lennie Bernstein when he was in town , Comden and Green , Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy would come and Judy ( Garland ) , who was a great girl and a dear friend , and Lena ( Horne ) and Judy would always sing. &quot; It was that concentration of talent , plus the studios ' demand for product in a pre-television era , that Kelly says fostered MGM ' s reputation for film musicals . &quot; When I first came_out here just before World_War_II , musicals were considered a sub-genre , unlike the early days of talkies with ( Rouben ) Mamoulian and ( Ernst ) Lubitsch , when musicals were very artistic things aesthetically . But they had become something where directors and writers would say , ' Let ' s do a little musical , ' which meant the actors turned and yelled at each other in song . &quot; I think we corrected a lot of that , because we had a great group of people who were all very serious about making musicals an indigenous American art_form . And we succeeded , of course , not without some yelling at studio heads. &quot; Indeed , Kelly remains ambivalent not only about Mayer but also the studio ' s infamous contract system . &quot; It was a very efficient system in that because we were at the studio all_the time we could rehearse a lot . But it also really repressed people . There were no union regulations yet and we were all indentured servants -- you can call us slaves if you want -- like ball players before free_agency . We had seven-year contracts but every six months the studio could decide to fire you if your picture wasn ' t a hit . And if you turned_down a role , they cut_off your salary and simply added the time to your contract. &quot; The A-list actors , Kelly says , fared a little better -- &quot; If you made them money you could say , ' I don ' t like this picture , ' and they were slower about cutting you off &quot; -- and , ironically , those artists who worked_on musicals . &quot; We got_the_best of it , because the executives didn ' t know how to read a musical script -- they still don ' t ! There would be a line like , ' I love you , ' which was followed by ' Three minutes of song_and_dance ' and they never quite understood that . &quot; One time , somebody upstairs insisted that we write_out the dances , so I got_together with the other choreographers and wrote_out , ' Four bars then into a glissade , arabesque , boy takes girl in arms , lifts her down into a fish . . . ' It ' s classic dance language , but of course it was Latin to them , and we soon went_back to the old way. &quot; It was left to individual producers and directors like Arthur Freed , Vincente Minnelli and most notably Stanley Donen , with whom Kelly collaborated on four films including &quot; Singin ' in the Rain &quot; and &quot; On the Town , &quot; to exert greater control over musicals than did Mayer and other MGM executives . &quot; When I came_out here Mayer was more interested in running his racehorses and so different producers and directors were given great latitude , &quot; Kelly recalls . &quot; Freed never curtailed any of us . He believed_in talent to_the_point if we said , ' Bring a dancer or a designer from New York , ' Arthur would see they were hired because he knew we were trying to move musicals to a different plane while keeping them still palatable to the public -- which is not what studios like Warners or Fox or Paramount were doing with musicals . Paramount at the time was largely doing Hope and Crosby ' Road ' pictures. &quot; And Kelly was an innovator -- not just as a dancer , but as a director and choreographer -- who took Broadway dance techniques and reworked them for film . Believing that simply filming a stage production flattened the dance numbers , Kelly experimented with camera_angles and props , trying to create a sense_of_movement on film . It was out of that larger perspective that Kelly pioneered his more memorable dance sequences -- on roller_skates , in a rain-soaked gutter , on a flatbed truck , swinging from a drape , leaping over a cartoon mouse , and in one particularly daring sequence in &quot; Living_in a Big Way , &quot; literally hopping across rafters . &quot; They would have died if ( the executives ) had known I was walking along the rafters , &quot; he says . &quot; They usually had stuntmen standing by , because if I fell the picture was over and that ' s what really concerned them. &quot; Not surprisingly , Kelly says that his favorite film remains &quot; On the Town &quot; &quot; because it was my first directing job and I loved it for the ground it broke -- shooting on location in New York without a chorus. &quot; He had seen the Broadway show and instantly &quot; phoned MGM to buy_it , little realizing that they already owned it , but Mayer didn ' t want to do_it because of its inter-racial aspect -- a Japanese American had played the leading lady on Broadway and we were at war with Japan. &quot; When Mayer eventually permitted Kelly to film in New York , &quot; I was exhilarated , &quot; he recalls . &quot; It ' s still my favorite , even though it ' s probably not the best musical or even the most popular. &quot; His one real regret , Kelly says , was not being able to make more films apart from MGM . Billy Wilder had contacted Kelly for several films , Columbia wanted him to reprise his Broadway role in the film version of &quot; Pal Joey , &quot; and Joseph Mankiewicz wanted him to play Nathan Detroit in &quot; Guys and Dolls. &quot; &quot; But MGM had seen me make ' Cover_Girl ' a hit for Columbia and they didn ' t want to loan me -- I even flew to New York with Lew Wasserman ( who was then an agent ) to go_over Mayer ' s head -- but in the end Sinatra got both roles . The paradox was when ' Guys and Dolls ' was done , MGM distributed it. &quot; Throughout the conversation , Kelly maintains a garrulous , chatty mien . He seems delighted at the opportunity to set the record straight . When he is told that an hour has passed he seems genuinely surprised . There are a_few remaining points to be made . &quot; It ' s hard to do anything but please the youth audience today , &quot; he says . &quot; And the men who run it now are pretty much lawyers and agents , fellows interested in it for the dough . I do think under the old studio system we made more mid-level pictures . But then I ' m an optimist and I believe those kind of pictures are coming_back . A steady trickle of them have made money and since money is the rule_in Hollywood , I have a feeling we ' ll be seeing more little pictures. &quot; He is less optimistic about the future of the musical , despite the recent success of such animated fare as &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; and &quot; Aladdin. &quot; &quot; To transfer that to real people you need ( more_than ) talented people who can sing and dance . Kids today are sorry they can ' t do musicals like we did , and the reason is there is no romantic music . It ' s hard to do a musical without singing ' I love you , ' and it ' s hard to do a romantic pas de deux to hip-hop music using quick-cut shots from the feet to the eyes to the legs or whatever. &quot; But even here , Kelly is hopeful , that like Tony Bennett ' s renewed popularity , musicals too &quot; will return to a softer romanticism. &quot; Videotape , he adds , is one reason for his optimism . &quot; Kids talk to me and say they want to do musicals again because they ' ve studied the tapes of the old films . We didn ' t have that . We thought once we had made_it , even on film , it was gone except for the archives. &quot; He pauses and for the first time , sounds sentimental . &quot; Now , when I look_at TV , I see a lot of my old steps being used and I ' m delighted. &quot; Starrin ' in Hollywood The films of Gene Kelly , including those he directed or produced : For Me and My Gal ( 1942 ) Pilot Number Five ( 1942 ) Dubarry was a Lady ( 1943 ) Thousands Cheer ( 1943 ) The Cross_of_Lorraine ( 1943 ) Cover_Girl ( 1944 ) Christmas Holiday ( 1944 ) Anchors Aweigh ( 1945 ) Ziegfeld Follies ( 1946 ) Living_in a Big Way ( 1947 ) The Pirate ( 1948 ) The Three Musketeers ( 1948 ) Words and Music ( 1948 ) Take Me Out to the Ball_Game ( 1949 ) On the Town ( 1949 ) Black_Hand ( 1950 ) Summer Stock ( 1950 ) It ' s A Big Country ( 1951 ) An American in Paris ( 1951 ) Singin ' in the Rain ( 1952 ) The Devil Makes Three ( 1952 ) Love Is Better Than Ever ( 1952 ) Brigadoon ( 1954 ) Seagulls Over Sorrento ( 1954 ) Crest of the Wave ( 1954 ) Deep in My heart ( 1954 ) It ' s Always Fair_Weather ( 1955 ) Invitation to the Dance ( 1956 ) The Happy Road ( 1957 ) Les Girls ( 1957 ) Marjorie Morningstar ( 1958 ) Tunnel of Love ( 1958 ) Inherit the Wind ( 1960 ) Let ' s Make_Love ( 1960 ) Gigot ( 1962 ) What a Way to Go ( 1964 ) The Young_Girls of Rochefort ( 1967 ) A Guide for the Married_Man ( 1967 ) Hello Dolly ( 1969 ) The Cheyenne Social Club ( 1970 ) Forty Carats ( 1973 ) that ' s Entertainment !
