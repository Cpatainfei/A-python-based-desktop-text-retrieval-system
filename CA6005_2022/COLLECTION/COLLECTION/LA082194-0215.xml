   <HEADLINE> HEALTH REFORM TANGLED UP IN A KNOT OF DEAL-KILLERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As President Clinton and members of Congress search for some kind of consensus on health_care reform , they find themselves stumped by a seemingly insoluble political equation : The potential areas of agreement range from slim to none , but the list of probable deal-killers grows ever longer . Consider these scenarios : Senior_citizens will walk away if Congress doesn ' t give them prescription_drugs and long-term care . America ' s biggest corporations will fight to the end any effort to let states write their own rules for regulating employee health benefits . Doctors demand the right to join any managed-care network they choose , but health_maintenance_organizations will bolt if they can no longer select the doctors they want . Meanwhile , the President and Democratic congressional leaders are holding_out for a future employer mandate that would force most firms to pay_for a portion of their workers ' health_insurance if the percentage of Americans with coverage doesn ' t increase in the interim . But every Republican in Congress -- and a significant number of Democrats -- will vote against any bill that contains such a mandate . Add it all up and the probability of a major health_care reform bill becoming law this year appears increasingly minuscule . And while many participants in the debate are willing to let the reform effort expire , for this year at least , it would be a bitter pill for Clinton , who has made health_care reform the cornerstone of his domestic policy agenda . &quot; No bill at all is better than a bad bill , &quot; said James Klein , who heads the Assn . of Private Pension and Welfare Plans , a coalition of big firms that provide workers with comprehensive benefits . At one time , the group ' s members were enthusiastic backers of health_care reform . They were particularly anxious to have an employer mandate , which would help curtail the problem of cost-shifting by health_care_providers . Experts estimate that businesses offering generous health benefits are being billed an extra $ 26 billion a year by hospitals and doctors to help cover the costs incurred by workers at firms that provide no insurance . But the current proposals from the Democratic leadership in both the House and Senate would inflict &quot; tremendous damage &quot; on employers by allowing states to create their own rules for corporate benefits , Klein said . A mosaic of up_to 50 sets of regulations could become an administrative nightmare for companies operating in multiple states , he said . The management of IBM Corp . is so disturbed by the prospect of a patchwork regulatory system that it has taken the extraordinary step of sending computer messages to its 110 # 000 workers , urging them to contact members of Congress to oppose the House and Senate bills . The changing calculus of health_care reform has suddenly placed Klein and the leaders of Fortune 500 corporations in a surprising alliance with the small-business lobby that is leading the charge against the employer mandate . Not long ago , the captains of industry heaped scorn on small-business proprietors , calling them &quot; free riders &quot; who let other people pick_up the cost of their workers ' health_care . On the growing list of potential health_care deal-killers , the employer mandate still occupies the top slot . The Democratic leadership bill under_consideration in the House would make all companies pay 80 % of the cost of employee health coverage . The Senate leadership plan contains a softer mandate . It would rely initially on voluntary measures , including billions of dollars in government subsidies , to help provide coverage to those who lack it . The mandate would be imposed only in states where coverage does not rise to 95 % of the population by the year 2000 . In those states , starting in the year 2002 , businesses with more_than 25 workers would be required to pay 50 % of the cost of employee coverage . To small-business owners , the House plan is viewed_as the policy equivalent of arsenic -- instantly lethal -- while the Senate bill is seen as a slower-acting , but still deadly , political potion . &quot; It ' s another example of government interference -- we don ' t trust them to put_together a system that will work , &quot; said John Motley , chief lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business , whose 600 # 000 members have been applying intense grass-roots pressure on members of Congress to kill the mandate once and for all . &quot; The only way the mandates will be won is_on sheer political force , overriding the interests of the business groups , &quot; said David B . Kendall , an analyst with the Progressive Policy Institute , a centrist Democratic think_tank . Disturbed by the mandate , as well as the prospect of a costly new prescription_drug benefit , a bipartisan group of approximately 20 senators who call themselves the &quot; mainstream coalition &quot; proposed a drastically stripped-down bill Friday . It eliminates the employer mandate altogether and would trim $ 400 billion from future growth of Medicare and Medicaid over 10 years in_order to generate funds to help poor people buy health_insurance . The plan also calls_for a number of insurance reforms . Companies could no longer deny or cancel coverage on the basis of a customer ' s health . All health plans would be available to all applicants . Policy renewals would be guaranteed . Insurance reforms such_as these are supported by just about everyone involved in the health_care debate , including Clinton and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole . But the President and most Democrats also insist on pursuing their more ambitious goal of expanding coverage to the 37 million Americans who now lack insurance . Therein lies Dilemma No . 1 for Clinton . He can ' t win in the Senate without the support of the &quot; mainstream &quot; moderates . But the plan they offered is unacceptable to Clinton ' s staunchest labor and liberal allies because it falls far short of his pledge to provide a generous panoply of benefits to every citizen . AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland sent a letter Friday to every Democratic senator , urging them to &quot; defend and strengthen &quot; the Democratic leadership bill . Sen . Paul Wellstone ( D-Minn. ) , one of the chamber ' s most outspoken liberals , denounced the &quot; mainstream &quot; plan as a mistaken effort that &quot; would fail to make health_insurance affordable for working people. &quot; And even if Clinton could swallow something less than an employer mandate , many members of Congress clearly could not . Among congressional liberals , at least 100 House Democrats and 20 senators are urging the President to stand_fast . Many of these members originally supported a single-payer system of universal coverage in which private health_insurance would disappear and the government would reimburse hospitals and doctors with tax dollars . The President long ago dismissed the single-payer formula as politically impossible . But he still needs the votes of the single-payer caucus , and its members say they won ' t accept any plan that does not include an employer mandate and a comprehensive benefit package with mental_health coverage , preventive care and other coverage provided by big companies . &quot; At some point , it doesn ' t make any sense to support the bill , &quot; warned Rep . Jim McDermott ( D-Wash. ) , leader of the single-payer group . &quot; Then you ' re not doing health_care reform , but just moving the deck_chairs on the Titanic . Embroidering around the edges is nonsense. &quot; McDermott said he believes that the House leadership bill , crafted by Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) , can hold the single-payer advocates because it includes a hard mandate . But he doubts whether the group would vote for the Senate package , designed by Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) , because it would impose no mandate for at least eight years , and only then in some states but not others . &quot; It still leaves 25 million people without health_insurance , &quot; he said . Dilemma No . 2 revolves_around the powerful senior_citizens lobby . After a special meeting last week , a council of 35 groups that represent the elderly declared its opposition to any health_care bill that does not contain prescription_drug coverage and financial help for Americans who require long-term care . Both drugs and long-term care would represent significant expansions of federal benefits -- and the cost of providing them . Members of Congress who vote against the proposed new benefits for the elderly &quot; will see their votes dog them the rest of their political lives , &quot; threatened Dan Schulder , director of legislation for the National Council of Senior_Citizens . On Saturday , senior groups expressed disdain for the &quot; mainstream &quot; plan . &quot; It uses very deep Medicare cuts_to fund other things , &quot; said John Rother , director of legislation for the 33-million-member American Assn . of Retired Persons . &quot; From the senior point_of_view , it is all pain and no gain. &quot; Bill Ritz , a spokesman for the 5-million-member National Committee to Preserve Social_Security and Medicare , denounced the &quot; mainstream &quot; plan as a &quot; shocking &quot; proposal . &quot; They are trying to squeeze Medicare and senior_citizens to cover the uninsured , &quot; he said . His group isn ' t happy , either , with the official Democratic leadership plans . Although those plans offer prescription_drug and long-term care benefits , they require some Medicare cuts too . &quot; They ask too_much of seniors , &quot; Ritz said . Dilemma No . 3 arises from the many physicians and medical societies who see an opportunity in health_care reform to limit the increasing power of health_maintenance_organizations and other managed-care networks operated by commercial insurance_companies . The insurers , backed by many employers , say their ability to rein_in rising medical costs will be undermined if they lose the freedom to screen the doctors they sign_up , monitor their work , and throw_out those who perform too many medical procedures or authorize too many tests . &quot; Too often , we think they put the emphasis not on quality , but on costs , &quot; said James Stacey , a spokesman for the American Medical Assn . One sign of growing antagonism : The Texas Medical Society has sued Aetna and Prudential , two of the biggest managed-care firms , for dismissing doctors from their networks . Many doctors want the health_care reform bill to include an &quot; any willing provider &quot; rule , which would require that networks accept any doctor who is willing to work for their fee schedules . But the Group Health Assn. , which represents health_maintenance_organizations , insists that an &quot; any willing provider &quot; rule would add as much as $ 1 # 284 a year to the average_cost of a family insurance_policy . California has the highest HMO penetration of any state , and leading networks recently warned in a letter to the state ' s congressional delegation that premiums could rise by as much as 28 % if they lose their exclusive power to pick doctors . Other unresolved conflicts facing health_care reform advocates include : * Higher-cost health plans . The mainstream group and other moderates want to restrict the ability of businesses to claim tax_deductions for high-priced health plans . Their proposal is opposed vigorously by corporations that offer top-of-the-line benefits and unions whose members receive them . * Cost controls . The Administration wants standby price_controls , which would limit insurers ' ability to raise premiums . The insurance_companies say this would interfere with free-market forces and cripple their ability to raise funds needed to operate high-quality medical service networks . Can the Administration unravel these dilemmas and assemble a winning coalition ? To an increasing number of insiders , it looks highly doubtful . &quot; We ' re trying to form a marriage , but it may be a shotgun wedding , &quot; said Sen . John B . Breaux ( D-La. ) , a key moderate and skilled deal-maker who so far has been unable to find the middle ground on health_care . Not everyone is lamenting the paradox facing Clinton and his allies . Republican lawmakers are gleeful , convinced they are dealing with a weakened President who has lost the confidence of the country on the complex health_care issue . As Senate debate moved along at a glacial pace last week , Sen . Bob Packwood ( R-Ore. ) chortled over the Democrats ' hapless efforts to make their bill palatable enough to pass . The entire exercise , he said , reminded him of the movie &quot; Weekend at Bernie ' s , &quot; in which two young friends try to camouflage the condition of a deceased employer . &quot; The kids keep changing the clothes , but the body is still dead , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
