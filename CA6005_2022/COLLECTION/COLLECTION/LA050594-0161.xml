   <HEADLINE> OFFICIALS HOPE DROP IN SMOG CONTINUES ; ENVIRONMENT : COUNTY AIR DISTRICT , TRYING TO MEET A FEDERAL DEADLINE , CITES TREND OF FEWER UNHEALTHFUL DAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the air_pollution season begins in Ventura County this week , authorities are hoping the dramatic drop_in smoggy days during recent years will continue , making_clean air attainable by the target year of 2005 . While unfavorable weather this year could still send ozone levels climbing , especially in pollution-prone Simi Valley , Thousand Oaks and Ojai , officials point to a long-term trend of fewer unhealthful days . The county ' s air_pollution levels violated the federal health standard for ozone on 122 days in 1974 , 45 days in 1984 and only 13 days in 1993 , said William Mount , deputy air_pollution control officer in Ventura County . In addition , he said , peak ozone levels dropped_by 42 % during that time . &quot; The trend over the long term is unmistakably down , and clearly that is because emissions have been reduced , &quot; Mount said . &quot; that ' s progress. &quot; Under the federal Clean Air Act , the county has until 2005 to reduce the number of days considered unhealthful to no more_than three in a three-year period . In Ventura County , May through October is considered the period most prone to smog , which develops when emissions from cars and industry mix_in sunlight to produce ozone . Hot , sunny days when winds are light are typically the worst , as pollutants are trapped near the ground . Inland valleys -- such_as Thousand Oaks , Simi Valley and the Ojai Valley -- are most susceptible to high levels of ozone . Coastal areas usually have low levels because ocean breezes blow smog inland . A nearly invisible gas , ozone damages lungs and aggravates respiratory illnesses . The chronically ill and elderly are advised to stay indoors when the Ventura County Air_Pollution Control District predicts high ozone levels . With last month ' s unusual weather pattern , district meteorologist Kent Field said it is impossible to tell what the smog season will bring this year . &quot; We ' ve seen a lot of low clouds and fog in April , and we usually don ' t get that until mid-May , &quot; he said . &quot; So whether it will be a hot summer with a lot of ozone or a cool and cloudy one , it ' s hard to tell. &quot; Even with reductions in pollution , the county is still designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a region with a &quot; severe &quot; air-quality problem , a category surpassed only by the &quot; extreme &quot; rating assigned to the Los Angeles Basin . The severe rating in Ventura County has prompted intervention by the EPA , which is drawing_up a Federal Implementation Plan with stiff control measures to further rid the air of ozone . Unlike the local air district , the EPA can regulate emissions from pesticides , cars , commercial trucks , trains , planes and boats . The agency ' s draft plan contains several proposed pollution control measures that industry has attacked as economically devastating . Among them is a proposal to require industry to reduce emissions by 25 % by 2005 , regardless of whether the business has already cut emissions by installing modern pollution controls . The Ventura County Air_Pollution Control District , which will issue its own 10-year blueprint for smog reduction in November , is working with local business and industry groups to determine which local and federal measures they could most easily accept . &quot; We are trying to build consensus , &quot; Mount said . &quot; We ' re working to come_up with a combination of federal and local controls to minimize the economic impacts and still meet the goals. &quot; Marc Charney , a lawyer who is president of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. , praised district officials for working with industry . &quot; The Air_Pollution Control District recognizes that many of the measures proposed in the Federal Implementation Plan just won ' t work here , and that the results could be disastrous to the community , &quot; he said . &quot; They could also be impossible or very difficult for the APCD to enforce. &quot; The EPA will hold public hearings on its plan in July . The Ventura County district is scheduled to issue its draft plan in November . Cleaner Air Air_pollution in Ventura County has decreased dramatically in recent years , as evidenced by the number of days the county ' s air violated federal health standards for ozone . 02 # 06 , 19 Number of days Year standard exceeded 1984 45 1985 44 1986 59 1987 31 1988 55 1989 46 1990 18 1991 33 1992 10 1993 13 Source : Ventura County Air_Pollution Control District</TEXT>
