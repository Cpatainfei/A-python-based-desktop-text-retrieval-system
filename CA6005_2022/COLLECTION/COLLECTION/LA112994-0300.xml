   <HEADLINE> THE ASIA BOOM ; TRAINING ; GO-GO GROWTH POINTS_UP SHORTAGE OF SKILLED LABOR ; MANY EXPERTS SAY ASIA NEEDS EDUCATION MORE THAN IT DOES INFRASTRUCTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In Japan , they ' re crying_for telecommunications experts . China is scrambling for talented managers , while Malaysia needs technicians and engineers . The problem is even more basic in Thailand : Only 17 % of the work_force is educated beyond primary_school , a liability likely to doom the nation to low-cost , labor-intensive industries unless corrected . Asia ' s go-go economic_growth has dazzled the world , but as the region looks toward the future , a formidable obstacle looms large : a growing shortage of skilled_workers and managers . In nearly every country , rapid industrial growth is outstripping the level of education and job skills in the local work_force , sounding alarms from Jakarta to Beijing . More_than dealing with poor infrastructure and a deteriorating environment , many experts say that Asia ' s most urgent need is massive investment in its own people . &quot; In our view , the biggest challenge of all facing Asia is education , &quot; warned a recent report by the Hong Kong-based Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd . &quot; The problem is not simply too_much illiteracy . . . . Rapid economic_growth has led to a chronic mismatch of skills in some countries. &quot; That lament is echoed throughout the region . &quot; I can get capital , but how do I get the talented people to make use of the capital ? &quot; moaned Guo Quan , manager of the Dalian Port Railway Co . in China , in a recent article . The shortage of skilled labor does not merely threaten future growth . According to a recent World_Bank report , roughly one-quarter of all investment in rail systems , power_plants and other infrastructure is wasted through technical inefficiencies largely due_to poorly trained operators . &quot; China can pump all_the billions of dollars it wants into its phone and rail systems . It will be money wasted , however , unless those responsible_for operating these systems are educated in efficient management techniques , &quot; the Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy report said . Nearly every Asian_country faces a shortage of engineers , scientists and technical staff . Malaysia produces 5 # 700 engineers annually ; the yearly demand , however , is 10 # 000 . South_Korea plans to boost the number of engineering students from the current 280 # 000 to 340 # 000 in five years . To improve their practical skills , third-year students have begun receiving six months of on-the-job training at various industrial_plants under a new government program ; the term will double next year . Even Japan , whose abundant base of engineering talent helped build its worldwide reputation for manufacturing prowess , has begun to sound alarms that its young people are losing interest in the field . The government recently formed a special committee , drawing members from every ministry , to find ways to increase the allure of science and technology . Many countries also find shortfalls in management skills and English , the language of international commerce . For Kazuhiko Nishi , president of the Japanese software publishing_firm ASCII Corp. , the biggest difference in necessary job skills today compared to those when he started his firm 18 years ago is in English . &quot; It ' s an absolute must , &quot; said Nishi , a fluent English speaker who helped develop the nation ' s first personal_computer and the world ' s first portable_computer . &quot; Eighteen years ago , the culture was very domestic . But today , everyone needs English , because interacting with the rest of the world has become a daily thing. &quot; Yet English skills are eroding in countries ranging from Malaysia to the Philippines . One reason is that nationalist movements have promoted use of the local language in schools over what is regarded_as the language of colonialists . Management training is also in critical demand . Despite China ' s attraction , its inefficient state enterprises , employing 110 million workers who account_for half the nation ' s industrial output , are in serious trouble . Half of them are unprofitable -- and bad management is the major reason , according to a China Daily survey in June of 2 # 586 money-losing enterprises . &quot; If China is to become competitive in world markets in anything other_than labor-intensive products , the nation must produce more , and better , managers , &quot; Asia Inc. magazine recently declared . &quot; If it can ' t or won ' t , China -- along with the rest of East Asia -- will fail to fulfill its current economic promise. &quot; Japan , whose management systems have been widely studied and often imitated , also faces a pressing need to change , argues Wolfgang Lux , president of AMA International Management Center in Tokyo . Although the old hierarchical system stressing lifetime employment and seniority-based pay and promotions worked for a rapidly growing economy , the slowdown has sharpened the need to increase productivity through more creativity -- allowing employees more freedom and individual responsibility , for instance -- and technology , he said . Only 10 % of Japanese offices use personal_computers , contrasted with 50 % in the United States . The growing gap between labor supply and demand in Asia is causing high turnover_rates , rapid salary hikes and increased job poaching -- all_of which slow_down economic_growth . In the past 10 years , for instance , the Shanghai Jiaotong University Management School has lost an entire faculty of nearly 100 academics -- poached by overseas universities and foreign firms . To meet the growing crisis , countries such_as Thailand are promising major investments in public education . But for the moment , the burden of education and training is falling on private firms . In South_Korea , some of the largest firms -- Hyundai , Samsung and Pohang Iron &amp; Steel , for instance -- have started their own institutions to train better workers ; the Daewoo Group has acquired a university . In a recent survey by a major South_Korean newspaper , Pohang ' s Institute of Science and Technology beat_out prestigious Seoul University as the nation ' s best center of higher learning . Motorola Inc. , the U.S. electronics giant , has set_up a training center in Beijing to teach its Chinese employees everything from brainstorming and goal-setting to its corporate culture . In Japan , Hitachi Zosen has engaged in massive retraining as the high yen has forced it over the past six years to shift from shipbuilding as its main business to a hodgepodge of everything from parking systems to tea production . Half the firm ' s technical specialists and all_of its general_staff are rotated every four years to train them in the newly diversified areas . &quot; We have transformed into an all-weather outfit , &quot; said Susumu Hirota , personnel manager . Quicker fixes for the region ' s labor woes include recruiting talent overseas . Take Sony Corp. , for instance . Ten years ago , Sony realized it could not live_on TVs , video recorders and tape_decks alone . So it decided to enter the tantalizing field of telecommunications -- which , along with many other companies , Sony has identified as the key industry of the future . There was only one problem : The firm knew virtually nothing about it . Sony raided universities for experienced people in the field , but found &quot; we could not rely only on Japanese human resources , &quot; according to Yasunori Kirihara , general_manager of corporate human resources . So it recruited specialists from the United States and Europe and launched a joint_venture with General Magic , a U.S.-based software firm . The efforts came_to fruition in September , when the joint_venture introduced its first telecommunications product : &quot; Magic Link , &quot; a hand-held device integrating e-mail , fax , telephone , nationwide paging and other on-line services . The venture represented a classic teaming of American software and Japanese manufacturing technology . &quot; To expand this business field took_five to 10 years , and now we are just getting some results , &quot; Kirihara said . &quot; We didn ' t know anything about telecommunications , and you can ' t make decisions without the proper staff. &quot; The pool of telecommunications experts was limited in Japan , he said , in part because the government restricted the telephone business only to the giant Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone . As it began to deregulate the industry in the late 1980s , the pool of experts grew , but shortages still pose a problem for Sony and others . Taiwan and South_Korea also rely heavily on overseas recruits -- most notably their own citizens schooled and trained in U.S. universities or high-tech firms . In a reverse brain_drain , thousands of scientists , engineers and other specialists have been wooed back home with lucrative job offers and patriotic appeals_to help build_up the motherland . In Taiwan ' s Hsinchu Science Park south of Taipei , for instance , 73 of the 150 companies were set_up by returnees -- many of them from such blue-chip firms as IBM , AT &amp; T and General Electric . But to keep the engine of growth running in the long term , Asia has no choice but to radically upgrade its schools , analysts say . The problems are diverse . Take Hong Kong , for example . Britain ' s impending hand-over of the territory to China raises myriad questions about how to meld Hong Kong ' s British colonial system with the Chinese educational structure after 1997 . Classes are supposed to be in English , supplemented by Cantonese , but a recent survey showed only 30 % of students knew both well enough to learn effectively . And the confusion is expected to worsen after 1997 , when official languages are set to change to English and Mandarin . In addition , the colony ' s rapid shift from a manufacturing hub to a services center as factories moved across the border to lower-cost China has created a demand for retraining . At Hong Kong ' s Vocational Training Center , the government offers subsidized classes in everything from precision grinding to graphic_arts for those who want to change trades or supplement their skills . Adrian Tang , 32 , is one who did . His firm once manufactured clothes and accessories in Hong Kong factories , such_as the book_bag he carries emblazoned with the slogan &quot; Be Part of Tomorrow ' s History. &quot; Now its products are produced in China , and he is studying the new skills of retail management and trade with the mainland to learn how to develop chain_stores and merchandise garments . &quot; There is no such thing as a lifetime career here , &quot; he said . &quot; Everything goes_on a three- or four-year cycle . But most Hong Kong people are very adaptable. &quot; Special correspondents Megumi Shimizu in Tokyo , Chi Jung Nam in Seoul , Maggie Farley in Hong Kong and staff writer Rone Tempest in Beijing contributed to this report . Higher Education Enrollment in colleges and universities more_than doubled between 1980 and 1990 in China , Singapore and South_Korea . China : + 132 % Japan : + 10. % Singapore : + 130 % South_Korea : + 144 % Taiwan : + 54 % Source : Human Resources for Science and Technology : The Asian Region</TEXT>
