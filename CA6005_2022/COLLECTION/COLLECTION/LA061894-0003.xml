   <TEXT> O.J. Simpson , the football great who rose from the mean streets of San Francisco to international celebrity , was arrested Friday for the murders of his ex-wife and a male friend after leading police on a gripping , two-hour chase through the rush-hour freeways of Southern California . The dramatic capture of one of the best-known and best-loved public figures in America came shortly before 9 p.m. , about 10 hours after he was to have turned himself in to Los Angeles police . Simpson ' s lawyer , Robert L . Shapiro , said Simpson , 46 , had agreed to surrender earlier , but bolted at the last minute with Al Cowlings , a longtime friend and former teammate at USC and with the Buffalo Bills . A massive manhunt involving scores of law_enforcement officers ended in the cobblestone driveway of Simpson ' s Tudor-style mansion , as Los Angeles Police_Department officers in bulletproof_vests converged on the white Ford Bronco in which Simpson and Cowlings had fled . As the truck sat parked , its hazard lights blinking silently in the balmy June night , Cowlings got_out of the driver ' s seat and walked into the house . Then , for nearly an hour , a distraught Simpson sat inside the truck , reportedly cradling a blue-steel revolver and demanding to speak_to his mother . Hundreds of supporters gathered_in the upscale neighborhood , chanting &quot; Free O.J. , &quot; and rocking police_cars . Meanwhile , the LAPD Special Weapons and Tactics team and negotiators surrounded the house , eventually coaxing Simpson out of the vehicle by cellular_telephone . He put the gun_down and emerged about 8:50 p.m. carrying a framed family photo . Simpson went_into the house , used the bathroom , called his mother and drank a glass of juice , authorities said . He was then transported by police motorcade to Parker Center for booking and transported to Men ' s Central Jail . Cowlings was booked on suspicion of harboring a fugitive . He was being held_on $ 250 # 000 bail . The dramatic arrest , broadcast live_on national television , capped a tragic weeklong drama that began with the slayings of Simpson ' s ex-wife , 35-year-old Nicole Brown Simpson , and Ronald Lyle Goldman , a 25-year-old Brentwood waiter whom she knew . Nicole Simpson and Goldman were found stabbed to death early Monday morning outside her Brentwood condo . Police sources said the two were slain sometime after 10 p.m. Sunday as her two small children slept inside . Although the Police_Department had refused all week to label Simpson a suspect , and Simpson ' s lawyers said he was innocent , sources inside the LAPD made_it clear from the outset that he was the focus of their investigation . The former college and professional_football star was briefly handcuffed at his mansion Monday afternoon and taken_to police_headquarters for questioning . He was later released , and remained free as evidence mounted against him day by day . By Friday , detectives had concluded their case , recommending that Simpson be charged with two counts of first-degree murder . The charges , which include a &quot; special circumstance &quot; of multiple killings , could bring him the death_penalty if he is convicted . Los Angeles Police Cmdr . David J . Gascon said Simpson had been scheduled to turn himself in to police at 11 a.m. Friday , with arraignment scheduled for that afternoon in Los Angeles Municipal Court . But 45 minutes , and then an hour , ticked by and Simpson was nowhere to be seen . Finally , just before 2 p.m. , police held a news_conference to announce that Simpson had officially become a fugitive . &quot; He is a wanted murder_suspect , &quot; Gascon said tersely , &quot; and we will go find him. &quot; It was unclear how the 6-foot-2 , 210-pound Simpson -- who had been dogged by crowds of reporters and cameramen for most of the week -- had managed to escape authorities , who had felt confident that someone so famous would never attempt to flee . Throughout the week , Simpson had appeared to be sequestered in his Brentwood home , emerging only to visit his children and to attend Nicole Simpson ' s funeral in Orange County . After the services Thursday , a man resembling Simpson was photographed ducking past hordes of news reporters into the home -- escorted by an off-duty LAPD sergeant . Police sources said Friday , however , that the man who resembled Simpson was a decoy , who was under the escort of LAPD Sgt . Dennis L . Sebenik , a 25-year veteran who works in the LAPD Harbor Division . Police said they want to interview Sebenik . Unbeknown to department leaders , Sebenik was serving as a member of Simpson ' s security detail even as police were investigating the former football star . Sebenik said he manages a &quot; legitimate security company &quot; and had been hired to provide security for Simpson . He would not comment on why an off-duty Los Angeles police_officer was protecting a man widely reported to be a suspect in a double homicide . Gascon said department officials were investigating Sebenik ' s conduct . &quot; I ' m not going_to rush in here and defend anything that might have occurred , but I ' m not going_to rush to judgment either , &quot; Gascon said . &quot; We have no interest in excusing what is obviously going_to be a difficult situation to explain. &quot; Shapiro said Simpson had been told Friday morning that he would have to surrender that day . Because of Simpson ' s &quot; fragile &quot; emotional_state , Shapiro said he had asked several doctors to join him at the San Fernando Valley home of Simpson friend Robert Kardashian , where a heavily sedated Simpson had spent Thursday night . Shapiro said Simpson had spent the morning in the throes of what appeared to be a suicidal depression . He updated his will , the lawyer said , called his mother and his children and gave three sealed letters to a friend at the house . One , addressed &quot; To whom it may concern , &quot; reiterated Simpson ' s denial that he had any part in the murders , and reflected his anguish at the events of the past week . &quot; I think_of my life , and feel I have done most of the right things , &quot; the letter said . &quot; So why do I end_up like this ? I can ' t go_on . No matter what the outcome , people will look and point . I can ' t take that . I can ' t subject my children to that. &quot; Shapiro said the plan for Simpson ' s surrender had not been an unusual one , adding that he had made similar arrangements for other clients in previous cases . But the surrender , he said , had been delayed for nearly an hour by a medical_examination of Simpson . Police , impatient about the delays , called the house to say that they were coming_to make the arrest . But Shapiro said he did not pass_on that news to Simpson , who was with Cowlings in another part of the house . It was apparently at that point that Simpson and Cowlings slipped_away , Shapiro said . From that point on , the afternoon was a frenzy of police activity and public astonishment . In downtown bars people watched television_sets , once primed for the championship basketball series , now tuned only to the breaking news_story . At the Spectrum Club in Santa Monica , exercisers pedaled stationary bikes to TV_sets tuned to coverage of O.J. Simpson ' s temporary disappearance . Downtown streets were deserted . Even West Hollywood ' s Sunset Strip , generally bumper-to-bumper with night-clubbers and party-goers , was empty . At Tower Records on Sunset Boulevard , 15 television monitors were tuned to the Simpson story , and customers were transfixed . &quot; It ' s paralyzed our business , &quot; said manager Gary Wilde . &quot; They ' re just standing there in awe. &quot; What they saw was nothing less than the running to ground of one of the most famous murder_suspects in U.S. history . Every move was chronicled on live television , a jump-cut documentary of an icon ' s demise : now he was reported missing , now feared dead , now alive and headed south on Interstate 5 . Before the police could finish announcing that he had disappeared , the drama had shifted back to the scene of the crime . Shortly after 2 p.m. -- at almost the same moment that authorities were announcing to an audibly shocked press corps that Simpson was a fugitive -- Nicole Simpson ' s grieving father rushed from his daughter ' s tile-roofed condominium , begging a teen-ager to dial 911 . LAPD Sgt . Bob Brounstein said a man claiming to be Simpson had called the house at least twice , saying he was coming_over to the scene of the murders to kill himself . &quot; I ' m going_to go join Nicole , &quot; the caller allegedly said . But Simpson never turned_up at the residence . &quot; We have a big mess , &quot; Sgt . Doug Abney told an anxious crowd . &quot; This is a false alarm. &quot; Then , just before 6 p.m. , Highway Patrol officers spotted Cowlings ' white Ford Bronco heading south through Orange County on Interstate 5 . A phalanx of police vehicles took_off in pursuit , blocking traffic on the freeway and entrance ramps as Simpson and Cowlings wound their way through Orange County and back to Simpson ' s Brentwood home . During the pursuit , LAPD Detective Fred Lange , the lead investigator on the case , contacted Cowlings on the phone , and was told that Simpson was in the back seat with a gun to his head , that he would never surrender and that he wanted to see his mother . As TV news choppers broadcast the astonishing spectacle -- the white Bronco slowly wending its way across Southern California , a cadre of 20 black-and-white squad_cars in its wake -- traffic came_to a halt along the freeways from Disneyland to Los Angeles and commuters jammed the overpasses to cheer and wave at Simpson as he passed . Some held_up huge signs exhorting , &quot; Go O.J. &quot; Meanwhile , scores of callers from across the country pleaded with him over the airwaves on KNX-AM news radio to pull over and turn himself in . The disappearance of Simpson threatened to create a public relations nightmare for the LAPD and the district_attorney ' s office , whose decision not to arrest the ex-football star earlier had been second-guessed in some quarters . Police sources had been saying all week that the evidence against Simpson was strong enough to warrant his arrest , and yet the department held_off , hoping to build an airtight case before taking him into custody . Gascon said the department was &quot; very unhappy &quot; with Simpson ' s disappearance and stressed that police had not given Simpson special treatment in their handling of the investigation . Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti , who described himself as &quot; upset and angry &quot; about Simpson ' s disappearance , also defended the Police_Department ' s performance , saying investigators had done a commendable job at building the case against the former athlete . In the four days after the killings , police sources say , evidence steadily mounted linking Simpson to the crimes . Bloodstains on the walkway where the bodies were found matched Simpson ' s blood_type , they said , and two bloodstained gloves were recovered , one at the scene , its match outside his Brentwood home . Polices sources also said that a trail of blood drops stretched across Simpson ' s cobblestone driveway . And Friday , they said that bloodstains inside his home matched Nicole Simpson ' s blood_type . The blood evidence appeared to figure against Simpson but is not necessarily conclusive , sources said . Even the rarest blood_types are shared by many people . Garcetti said that a murder weapon , which he described as a &quot; substantial knife , &quot; had yet to be found . It was shortly after midnight Sunday that the blood-soaked bodies of Nicole Simpson and Goldman were found sprawled on a Spanish-tile walkway outside her Brentwood condominium . Coroner ' s investigators said both their throats had been slit , and their corpses bore multiple stab wounds . Within hours , police began looking_for Simpson , who , they later learned , had taken an 11:45 p.m. flight to Chicago . Notified of his ex-wife ' s death , Simpson returned to Los Angeles , arriving shortly before noon . As police bore in on Simpson during their investigation , he changed lawyers , hiring Shapiro on Tuesday . But Shapiro said his client grew increasingly distraught and began undergoing treatment for depression . At his news_conference Friday , Shapiro said he and Simpson ' s doctors feared that the football great might attempt suicide . One of Simpson ' s last acts before disappearing had been to write the three letters to his children , his mother , who was hospitalized in San Francisco Friday night , and to the public . Although the letters to his children and mother were not released , close friend Kardashian , who joined Shapiro at the news_conference , read the public letter to a hushed group of reporters on live television . In it , Simpson expressed regret for the life that he would never have with his current girlfriend and thanked a list of former teammates , golfing buddies and good friends . He acknowledged the much-publicized fights with his ex-wife and their recent decision not to reconcile after years of turmoil , but characterized them as the natural ups and downs of long relationship . He urged the news media to leave his children in peace . And he denied that he was the man who committed the brutal killings . &quot; I have nothing to do with Nicole ' s murder , &quot; Simpson wrote . &quot; I love her , always have and always will . &quot; Don ' t feel sorry_for me , &quot; the letter concluded . &quot; I have had a great life , great friends .
