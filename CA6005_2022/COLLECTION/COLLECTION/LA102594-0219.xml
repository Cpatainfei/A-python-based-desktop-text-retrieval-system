   <HEADLINE> RAUL JULIA ; ACTOR PORTRAYED A WIDE ARRAY OF CHARACTERS ON STAGE , SCREEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Raul Julia , whose brooding , passionate features and multifarious talents enabled him to portray characters ranging from the ghoulish patriarch of &quot; The Addams Family &quot; to the persecuted political_prisoner in &quot; Kiss of the Spider Woman , &quot; died Monday . The Puerto Rican-born actor -- famous in his early years for his Shakespearean characterizations -- was 54 and died at North Shore University Hospital in the Long_Island community of Manhasset , N.Y. , where he was taken_after a stroke a week ago . He slipped into a coma Thursday and never regained consciousness . He had been in good_health , said his agent , Jeff Hunter , adding that the stroke &quot; was totally unexpected. &quot; Throughout his U.S. stage and film career ( he came_to the mainland from Puerto Rico in 1964 ) the urbane actor with the shrouded gray eyes and resonant voice remained a striking presence . He starred in the New York Shakespeare Festival ' s &quot; Macbeth &quot; ( 1966 ) and &quot; Othello &quot; ( 1979 ) and opposite Meryl Streep in &quot; The Taming of the Shrew &quot; ( 1978 ) . He also starred with Harrison Ford in the film thriller &quot; Presumed Innocent &quot; as attorney Sandy Stern and opposite Faye Dunaway in &quot; The Eyes of Laura Mars. &quot; In one of his last appearances -- a Home Box_Office TV movie that was shown in September -- Julia was the martyred Brazilian rain_forest activist Chico Mendes . He also was Don Quixote singing &quot; The Impossible Dream &quot; in a 1991 stage revival of &quot; Man of La Mancha. &quot; He was nominated for four Tony Awards ( &quot; The Two Gentlemen of Verona , &quot; &quot; The Threepenny Opera &quot; -- as Mack the Knife -- &quot; Where ' s Charley &quot; and &quot; Nine &quot; ) and was the widely heralded Marxist revolutionary Valentin in Hector Babenco ' s film version of &quot; Spider Woman. &quot; The last was the major breakthrough in a film career that began with minor parts in &quot; The Organization_Man &quot; and &quot; Panic in Needle Park , &quot; both in 1971 . And then there was Gomez Addams , a role that Julia brought_to film after John Astin played the part in a highly successful two-year TV series of the mid-1960s . &quot; The Addams Family &quot; was about a macabre but tightly_knit clan headed by Gomez , the evil-eyed husband and father with the murderous mentality . His wife was the beautifully ominous Morticia ( Anjelica Huston in the film ) and with butler Lurch and befuddled brother Fester they existed in a cartoon-celluloid world first created by Charles Addams in the New Yorker magazine . Their motto was &quot; We gladly feast on those who would subdue us. &quot; The 1991 film produced a sequel -- &quot; Addams Family Values &quot; -- in 1993 . In that picture Morticia bears a son , Pubert , who emerges complete with Gomez ' s mustache . Many found it funnier than its predecessor . Julia ' s friends were as diverse as his characters . They ranged from comedian Orson Bean to Joseph Papp , the innovative producer-director of the New York Shakespeare pageants with which Julia had a 16-year association , to Werner Erhard , founder of the mind-bending , self-improvement group est . Papp , who died in 1991 , once said of Julia : &quot; He was always outrageous in his acting choices . He ' s larger than life all_the time when he ' s on the stage . He doesn ' t mind falling_flat on his face doing something dangerous. &quot; Julia credited Bean , a stage actor later more closely associated with TV game_shows , with sparking his interest in the American theater . ( Julia ' s first stage exposure -- as the_devil in a first-grade play -- had been the start of his intrigue with acting. ) &quot; I was in college appearing in a variety_show and Orson was in Puerto Rico on vacation , &quot; Julia said . &quot; He saw me and liked my performance . I told him that once I graduated I wanted to make acting my career and I was going_to Europe. &quot; Instead Bean invited Julia , at 6 feet , 2 inches an imposing presence , to New York , where he saw his first Broadway plays . &quot; I thought , &quot; Julia said in a 1991 interview , &quot; ' My God , you can actually make a living . . . . ' &quot; Julia ' s interests were also widespread . Foremost among them for the past 15 years had been the Hunger Project , a charity that grew out of his experiences with est . The project ' s goal is to eradicate hunger by the year 2000 , and Julia insisted that statements in its behalf be inserted into the programs that accompanied his stage performances . Julia said his interest in the underfed needy began in Puerto Rico when his successful father -- a restaurateur who reportedly introduced pizza to the island -- and mother would take stray children into their home . &quot; When I found_out in 1977 that we have the technology to end hunger on the planet , I had to get involved , &quot; he told the Washington Post in 1992 . &quot; As Don Quixote says in the play , ' Maddest of all is to see things as they are , not as they ought to be. ' &quot; Julia ' s other offstage efforts included the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors , which works to develop theater in Spanish . After &quot; Spider Woman , &quot; the actor was able to partially cast_off the hesitancy some producers and directors displayed in casting a Latino in a non-Latino role . Although the Latin influence was evident in &quot; Moon Over Parador , &quot; &quot; Tequila Sunrise &quot; and &quot; Havana , &quot; Julia was given the starring role of Cottard in a film version of Albert Camus ' &quot; The Plague &quot; that went straight to video . Julia also was Jane Fonda ' s sinister ex-husband in &quot; The Morning After , &quot; the smooth-talking waiter in &quot; One From the Heart &quot; and the lovelorn goatherd in &quot; Tempest. &quot; On television he was featured in several miniseries , among them &quot; Richest Man in the World : The Story of Aristotle Onassis , &quot; &quot; Mussolini : The Untold Story &quot; and a 1974 special of &quot; King Lear , &quot; in which he played Edmund . In a lighter mode , the actor was a one-season regular on &quot; Sesame Street &quot; as Rafael the Fixit Man . Julia considered his portrayal of the martyred Salvadoran archbishop Oscar Romero in the 1989 film &quot; Romero &quot; one of his most important accomplishments . But he said that generally he preferred the stage to motion_pictures and TV . &quot; To me the theater is like standing on top of the mountain and shouting your confession , &quot; he said in a 1990 interview . &quot; And film is like being in the confessional whispering , ' I have done this , I have done this . . . . ' &quot; Julia will be given a state funeral in San Juan , and memorial services will be held_in New York and Los Angeles , said Susan Wright , his personal assistant . Julia ' s survivors include his wife , dancer Merel Poloway ; two sons , Raul Sigmund and Benjamin Rafael ; his mother , Olga Arcelay of Puerto Rico , and two sisters . * AN APPRECIATION : Raul Julia was one of the first Puerto Ricans to star on the Broadway stage , but his talent was such_that he was hardly ever typecast .
