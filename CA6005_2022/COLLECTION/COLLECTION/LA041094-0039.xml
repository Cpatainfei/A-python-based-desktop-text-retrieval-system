   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; THE 10 MOST LIKELY TO RULE GUYVILLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here , listed alphabetically , are the female bands or musicians who are making -- or are_on the verge of making -- the most impact in today ' s rock_music : Bikini Kill : As leaders of the &quot; riot grrrl &quot; movement , this Olympia , Wash. , quartet ' s angry lyrics not only lash_out against misogyny , chauvinism and violence , but attack the anti-feminine aspects of ' 70s feminism . Bikini Kill overaccentuates and even parodies girlishness -- from lunch pails and plastic kiddie barrettes to clipped hairdos and frumpy dresses to such gestures as scrawling slut across their bare midriffs . &quot; These are my ruby red lips , the better to suck you dry / These are my long , red nails , the better to scratch_out your eyes , &quot; singer Kathleen Hanna rails in their second full independent album , &quot; Pussy Whipped. &quot; * Breeders : The Breeders , headed by singer-guitarist Kim Deal ( formerly of the Pixies ) , write and perform liquid , smooth pop songs that defy normality with a spacey , experimental edge . On the group ' s second album , &quot; Last Splash , &quot; Deal and her twin sister , Kelley , top the songs with husky yet smooth harmonies that are both seductive and surreal . The lyrics are often nonsensical , used more for their sonic wordplay than to convey any particular thought . Kim ' s deep , breathy voice , like a post-punk Peggy Lee , gives the word sexy a new twist without even trying . * PJ Harvey : When Polly Jean Harvey hisses the words &quot; Lick my legs , I ' m on_fire &quot; in the title song of her critically acclaimed 1993 album &quot; Rid of Me , &quot; she lays her emotions on a platter for all_the world to see . Her words are raw , her Patti Smith-inspired vocal delivery dramatic and her backing music abrasive , minimal and arty . Harvey , who also plays guitar , creates an overall sound that is difficult , and the listener comes_away disturbed by her intense outpourings . One of the few English women with such an individual and powerful style . * Juliana Hatfield : This MTV darling plays the familiar weak and waif-like role that women traditionally have been trapped in . On &quot; Become What You Are , &quot; the 26-year-old Boston native ' s major-label debut , she slides further into pop mediocrity , coming_off as a wispy , doll-like creature with little to say . Though she ' s been marketed as an &quot; alternative &quot; act , she ' s more like a submissive pin-up in the tradition of the post-Go-Go ' s Belinda Carlisle . * Kristin Hersh : As the leader of Throwing Muses , Hersh started one of the most respected bands in the arty underground scene . On her solo debut , &quot; Hips and Makers , &quot; Hersh proves her creativity can thrive outside the parameters of her old band . The Providence , R.I. , native ' s intricate and often subdued tunes are unexpectedly powerful , and her crystalline vocals often pack more Angst than half of Seattle ' s grunge scene . Her unique style shows there is power in grace and subtlety . * Hole : Hole has brains , guts , emotion and sensitivity . The quartet ' s new major-label debut , &quot; Live Through This , &quot; features Courtney Love ' s sharp insight and wrenched feelings against music that ' s alternately driving and sullen , displaying the confusion Love has faced as a flamboyant and intelligent woman . After two years of scrutiny by the press for her turbulent lifestyle ( she is married to Nirvana ' s Kurt Cobain ) and brash philosophies , Love bursts wide open the boundaries of &quot; acceptable , ladylike behavior. &quot; * L7 : This L.A. quartet made_it big with its 1992 major-label debut , &quot; Bricks Are Heavy , &quot; and brought the issue of reproductive rights to a rock audience with its benefit_concert series , &quot; Rock for Choice. &quot; But beyond its politics , you never get a sense of who this band is . Its macho posturing suggests that the band views its gender as a weakness to be concealed . And the group ' s formerly rough and gritty sound has been toned_down into traditional bad-girl pop ; as a result , its original potential is smothered . * Luscious Jackson The group rose out of New York City ' s hard-core scene as a sort of post-punk hip-hop outfit in the vein of the Beastie Boys . Signed to the Beasties ' Grand Royal label , the female quartet mixes distorted hip-hop beats and sings more_than it raps . The group has gained attention with its debut album , &quot; In Search of Manny , &quot; which establishes them as one of the only female bands to fuse bohemian rock and rap . This debut is often too laid-back and cool to ignite or throw sparks , but it shows potential . * Liz Phair : On last year ' s debut album , &quot; Exile in Guyville , &quot; Phair took the Rolling Stones ' &quot; Exile on Main_Street , &quot; and twisted the album ' s macho posturing around on itself by inserting her own philosophies inside the classic album ' s song structures . The 27-year-old singer-songwriter ' s candid lyrics about sex and passsive-aggressive attitude are often taken as ironic by women and threatening but enticing by men . What ' s often overlooked is her witty portrayal of the everyday . Phair ' s subtle manipulation of her milk-and-honey looks also adds_to the many contradictions that fuel her unassuming music and appeal . * 7 Year Bitch : One of the first all-female bands to break_out of the largely male Seattle scene and stand on its own . Recently signed to Atlantic records , 7 Year Bitch follows in the footsteps of the ultra-heavy and abrasive Babes in Toyland , but mixes the maniacal noise with the solid beat of bands such_as AC / DC . Singer Selene Vigil ' s lyrics range from her personal experience with abortion to_the_pointed sentiment &quot; dead men don ' t rape. &quot; Though hardly thinking-woman ' s rock , it carries a lot of impact .
