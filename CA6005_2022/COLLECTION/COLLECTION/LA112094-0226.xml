   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / SPY VS . SPY : CAINE REOPENS ' THE IPCRESS FILE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So what do you do if you want Michael Caine to star in an original movie for your premium cable channel but he ' s more interested in making feature_films ? If you ' re the executives at Showtime , you give him a feature_film -- provided that he shoot the follow-up cable TV sequel for Showtime . Caine just completed work_on two projects in Russia , reprising the Harry Palmer spy character who made him famous in director Sidney J . Furie ' s &quot; The Ipcress File &quot; in 1965 . &quot; I did the TV movie because it was the only way they would make the feature , &quot; said Caine by phone from Russia . The actor has only played a handful of roles for television in three decades , his last one earlier this year as Stalin in the NBC miniseries , &quot; World_War_II : When Lions Roared. &quot; &quot; Bullets to Beijing &quot; and &quot; Midnight in Saint_Petersburg &quot; were both filmed for 12 weeks in areas around St . Petersburg for a cost of $ 9 million , with 60 % or so of the budget allocated to the first film . &quot; Beijing &quot; is expected to receive a limited theatrical release next fall ; Showtime will try to find a distributor in February at the American Film Market . &quot; Beijing &quot; will then follow the normal path down the entertainment food_chain , coming_out on video six months later , and then hitting Showtime six months after that . The sequel , &quot; Saint_Petersburg , &quot; will probably be seen on Showtime a_few months after the theatrical release of &quot; Beijing. &quot; &quot; It would be difficult to get Michael Caine to do an original movie . He ' s a well-established star , who comes_with a certain price . By having a theatrical locomotive we could make_it work , &quot; explained Matthew Duda , senior_vice_president of program acquisitions and planning for Showtime Networks , which put_up half of the budget_for domestic rights . The rest of the film was paid_for by Canadian , Russian and British interests . Both movies revisit the character created by author Len Deighton in a series of espionage thrillers about a Cockney crook turned secret_agent . For those who don ' t remember , Harry Palmer was a sort of reaction to the cult of James Bond . While Bond sipped his vodka_martinis -- shaken , not stirred -- and then jumped into his Aston Martin , Palmer slammed a beer in the pub and then hopped the bus home . He first volunteered for espionage to escape a jail term . &quot; Ipcress File &quot; was the first film featuring Caine ' s name above the title , and it led to &quot; Alfie , &quot; which cemented Caine ' s career in 1966 . Two more Harry Palmer sequels , &quot; Funeral in Berlin &quot; ( 1966 ) and &quot; Billion Dollar Brain &quot; ( 1967 ) , were made . A couple years ago , veteran producer Harry Alan Towers was wondering what would have happened to the Palmer character once the Cold_War ended . &quot; I thought there was a story here about what happened to the out-of-work spies left over from the Cold_War , &quot; said Towers , 74 , who executive produced the Showtime productions and wrote the screenplays for them under the name Peter Welbeck . His credits range from producing the Orson Welles radio series &quot; The Lives of Harry Lime &quot; to producing two back-to-back &quot; Lost World &quot; movies , for B-movie distributors Harmony Gold , that went straight to video . Towers secured the Palmer series rights about six months ago , after some difficult negotiations with Deighton and original producer Harry Saltzman , who also produced the early Bond films . Because Deighton didn ' t give his character a name , Saltzman , who died recently , and Caine came_up with the Palmer name together before they made &quot; Ipcress File. &quot; &quot; We set these sequels in Russia , because I was in Russia about two years ago , and I learned about a security agency flourishing under the name of Alex , &quot; Towers said . &quot; It ' s the first private security organization ever licensed in Russia , and largely staffed by ex-Red Army intelligence. &quot; In the second movie , Caine establishes a private investigation agency in Russia , based on Alex . But not without help from Jason Connery , the son of the original Bond , Sean Connery . They team_up in both Showtime productions . If these movies turn_out to be a hit on Showtime , Dudas said , viewers can look_forward to seeing a series of TV movies_starring Connery . Caine describes their work together as &quot; comedy thrillers. &quot; &quot; Michael Caine is a super comedian , &quot; Towers said . &quot; I don ' t think he ' s a lively leading man any more . that ' s why Jason Connery fits so perfectly into the package . Michael is perfectly content to get the laughs and let Jason get the girls. &quot; Most feature_film actors do cable_television for the prestige . Caine makes no bones about the fact that he ' s doing these for the money . He won ' t reveal how much he is getting paid , but he says he has never received more for a role . &quot; The whole_thing financially is very advantageous , &quot; said Caine , who also has 10 % interest in anything the Showtime movies make in theaters or on video . &quot; This is not an entirely artistic endeavor . I ' m not out busting my neck like a youngster trying to get somewhere . I ' ve got a very beautiful home_in London , a home_in the country in Oxford and one in Los Angeles . To get me out of there , you have to pay me. &quot;</TEXT>
