   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; COMMENTARY ; WITH THE UNITED STATES ' STAGE_SET , BORA MISSES HIS CUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As we get close to the end of World Cup ' 94 , a month of flag-waving and star-gazing over lots of people with only one name , let ' s flap the Stars and Stripes and discuss Bora . Bora is not Pele . Nor is he Romario , Bebeto , Maradona , Alexi , Roberto or Leonardo . He is Bora Milutinovic , coach of the U.S. soccer team that went_to the round of 16 before being beaten by Bebeto and leveled by Leonardo . Bora is known only as Bora , mostly because having one name in soccer is a mark of singular stature . Also , sportswriters got tired_of having to look_up the spelling of Milutinovic . Bora is much celebrated in our country . At the end of his team ' s 1-0 loss to Brazil at Stanford Stadium , television_announcers gushed and gloated : What a wonderful thing it was for the good ol ' USA to have even gotten this far . What a moral victory for us to hold Brazil to one goal . What a great step_forward for soccer in this country . What a lot of baloney . Let it be said here that Bora blew it . The dynamics of the game were as follows : Soccer was finally getting its due in the press and in the public . The United States ' victory over Colombia was a national wake-up call . People were talking soccer in the men ' s room and the board room . The bizarre death of Andres Escobar , while a shocking turn-off , nevertheless further focused public attention on the emotional and psychotic grip this sport has_on billions of people . And , perhaps most important for those who badly want soccer to be a permanent , best-selling entree on America ' s sports menu , the Brazil game would clearly attract the largest U.S. television audience ever for the sport . It was a moment to be seized , an opportunity to be taken , a chance that demanded risk rather than routine . So Bora played defense . Bora went the safe route , with a game_plan that played not to win , but rather not to lose . Bora played for the fluke , the Brazilian mistake early that would give the United States a penalty and a lead it could cling_to ; or enough defense to somehow get_into the crapshoot they call penalty kicks , where frequently the luckiest team -- rather than the best -- will win . Bora ' s chances of beating Brazil were more none than slim . Nobody expected him to . Everybody was generally pleased that he had done what he always does with whatever World Cup team he happens to be coaching -- take it one notch above the expectation and then pack his bags and ride_away as a hero , heading for another country , another World Cup and another soccer quick_fix . Bora is a master of the patch , caulk and quick touch-up around the window_frames . The U.S. game against Brazil , played_on the Fourth_of_July , needed some fireworks . It needed to be 3-2 or 4-2 . It needed lots of runs_by the U.S. team -- lots of chances , crosses , near misses , flying headers , posts hit . Winning wasn ' t really an issue here . It wasn ' t going_to happen . There just wasn ' t another Andres Escobar mistake in the cards for Uncle_Sam soccer . So why not go_down with guns blazing , instead of going_through the entire game with only four shots on goal ? Why not give those millions watching on TV in the United States -- a vast majority actually caring about this for the first time in their lives -- a hell of a show ? Why not turn Eric Wynalda and Ernie Stewart loose ? Why not let Thomas Dooley play like Italy ' s Dino Baggio , who is allowed to roam and penetrate from the midfield ? While the Fourth_of_July truly could have been the trigger for a soccer explosion in this country , that may happen , anyway . It appears that Alan Rothenberg and his people have built a solid foundation for soccer interest here , with their beautifully organized and run World Cup ' 94 . But 90 minutes of excitement against Brazil , rather than 90 of falling_back on defense and watching Brazil hit the post , would have enhanced greatly what Rothenberg has begun . Bora was in control of a moment when big picture counted more_than little , when marketing his sport was the most important thing , because winning wasn ' t a viable option . But Bora blew it . It will be interesting to see what happens now , when the flags_stop waving and Bebeto and Romario and their friends go_off somewhere in search of a second name . It will be interesting to see if Bora stays_on , or is asked to stay_on , to head the U.S. program . His charm , charisma , knowledge of the international game and delightful fake broken English could make him an ongoing celebrity on the U.S. sports scene . My guess is that he ' ll go_back to Mexico , which is furious with his friend Miguel Mejia Baron ; which has an established talent pool ; which cares about little else in sports ; which is very free with the peso for things like this and which probably can make the quarterfinals of World Cup ' 98 with just one quick coat .</TEXT>
