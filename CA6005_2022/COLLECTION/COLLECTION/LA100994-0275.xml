   <HEADLINE> DESPITE RUMORS , MILITARY RULER ' S FATE LOOKS SETTLED ; HAITI : LT . GEN . RAOUL CEDRAS ' RESIGNATION APPEARS UNAVOIDABLE . CHIEF OF STAFF ' S BEHAVIOR IS LESS PREDICTABLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Where is Raoul Cedras ? One report had the Haitian army commander at the airport , leaving for exile in Spain . No , said another source , he left his house at 2 a.m. for the Dominican_Republic . All wrong , went another account , the general and his wife were at their beach_house . But despite the dashes from airport to border crossing by reporters , there was no credible evidence that Cedras had gone anywhere , nor that he intended to , at least for the time_being . In fact , Cedras , who had not been seen in public for more_than 24 hours , turned_up Saturday afternoon for his regular meeting with U.S. Ambassador William L . Swing and Lt . Gen . Hugh Shelton , commander of the 20 # 000 American troops here . The whereabouts of Cedras , who has led a brutal military regime here since the army overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on Sept . 30 , 1991 , had been the subject of intense speculation for the past week . But in the long_run , the fate of Haiti ' s ruling general appears settled . Under an agreement he signed with former U.S. President Jimmy_Carter , Cedras and his chief_of_staff , Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby , have to leave the military upon parliamentary approval of a general amnesty or by Oct . 15 , next Saturday , whichever comes first . Legislators on Friday passed a measure giving Aristide the power to grant limited amnesties , but some U.S. diplomats said it is unlikely the new bill will be used to force Cedras to resign immediately . Instead , the betting is that he will be left alone at least until Wednesday , when his formal three-year appointment as commander_in_chief expires . The Carter agreement required that Cedras , Biamby and Police_Chief Michel-Joseph Francois resign from the army but said nothing about their leaving Haiti . However , Francois resigned Monday and fled to the Dominican_Republic . U.S. officials , diplomats and Haitian sources , including some close to Cedras , think he will choose exile . Cedras , who received advanced military_training in Spain , owns a house in Barcelona and recently purchased an apartment in Madrid -- and he has enough money after three corrupt years in Haiti to live there in luxury as long as he wants , said a friend who has known him since childhood . Biamby , a close Cedras associate , is said to be far less willing to resign or to leave . &quot; Biamby is an odd one , &quot; said a U.S. official here . &quot; He sees himself as a soldier ' s soldier and thinks he would betray his troops if he leaves and they are left behind. &quot; American officials said they believe Biamby is mentally unstable , and they have been conducting a series of covert activities aimed at driving him from the country one way or another . &quot; The likely scenario is that Biamby will quietly resign when Cedras does and then go_home and wait to see what happens . . . , &quot; a boyhood friend of Biamby said . &quot; But he hates the United States and will not be driven from the country by Americans. &quot;</TEXT>
