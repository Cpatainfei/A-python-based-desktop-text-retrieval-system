   <TEXT> Regarding Frans B.M. de Waal ' s review of &quot; The Monkey Wars &quot; by Deborah Blum ( &quot; Please Don ' t Feed the Extremists , &quot; Nov . 20 ) : I would like to advise Times ' readers and people everywhere to use their critical judgment when reading about animal experimentation because $ 10 billion of taxpayers ' money is what funds a great_deal of this animal research . It is fascinating to see the consistency with which letters of support for such research are written by researchers -- people making their living by doing animal research . De Waal is in no position to be objective while he defends his federal funding and his salary . If animal research has benefited anyone at all it certainly has benefited career researchers . You do the math , we ' re talking $ 10 billion and our health system hasn ' t made a dent in the top 10 causes of death . Why ? Because they are largely preventable and very few federal dollars are earmarked for prevention . The two most widely used measures of health are longevity and infant_mortality and by either criterion our nation ranks nearly last among developed countries . This is not surprising given our devotion to expensive high-tech intervention instead of basic prevention . We can understand why a person whose life was prolonged by high-tech treatment feels that biomedical research is vital but the fact is that headline-making breakthroughs have little impact on the health of the nation as_a_whole . Most premature deaths are not_due to a lack of high-tech methods but to a lack of basic prevention programs . Making medical progress is not the same as improving human health . According to government statistics from the U.S. Public Health Service lifestyle is the most important factor that determines health ; second is the environment ; third is genetics ; and only fourth important is medical intervention ( which is the practical_application of research ) . We cannot improve health and reduce costs by investing in the least important determinant of health . We must invest in prevention for which we already have enough knowledge to prevent most disease and injury . If we are not willing to make a serious commitment to prevention using the information we now have amassing more scientific data will not help . And if we are not willing , why not ? The goal of our health_care system must be to improve human health , to produce the greatest health benefit for the greatest number of people ; any contrary goal would imply that one person or group is more important than another person or group which is not tolerable in our society . We can undeniably save more lives through prevention than through medical intervention -- they may be different lives but they are just as important . It is not that we don ' t care about those whose only hope is clinical research ; it is that we do care about the much larger_number of people who are being lost to utterly preventable illnesses and injuries . Why are we funding maternal deprivation studies in monkeys when we are not funding day_care_centers for children ? Why are we making cocaine_addicts out of dogs and cats while people are being turned_away from mental_health and drug rehabilitation centers ? Why are we crash testing dogs and pigs in car accident studies while we delay air_bag laws and close trauma care centers ? The list goes_on and on . As is well-known , federal funds are not unlimited . Every dollar spent on animal research takes money away from programs that help people . LORIN LINDNER , Ph.D. , M.P.H. , LOS ANGELES Calling opponents extremists is effective rhetoric , since the term connotes violent and unreasonable fanatics . But the fact remains that &quot; extreme &quot; positions are sometimes correct . In the era of slavery , abolitionists were the extremists , while &quot; voices of reason &quot; would urge only moderate reforms such_as keeping slave families intact . The &quot; extremist &quot; had the better grasp of the fundamental wrongness of slavery -- and , one can plausibly argue , so it is with the antivivisectionist . Moreover , most abolitionists do not rely_on &quot; yelling &quot; or violence , as De Waal intimates ; they seek change through consciousness-raising and legislation . KATHIE JENNI , PH.D. , ASSOC . PROF . OF PHILOSOPHY , UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS Researcher De Waal , in his self-serving review of &quot; The Monkey Wars &quot; ( Book_Review , Nov . 20 ) , tells us that primates are similar to humans thereby making them valuable research models . On the other hand , it ' s OK to experiment on them because they are not like us . Animal experimenters have had it both ways for too long . The fact remains that despite billions of dollars and the death of millions of animals , the major diseases are still with us . BILL DYER , VENICE</TEXT>
