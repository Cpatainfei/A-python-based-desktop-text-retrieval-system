   <HEADLINE> TOP-LEVEL FOE OF ARISTIDE FLEES ; HAITI : CAPITAL ' S POLICE_CHIEF , TARGETED FOR REMOVAL BY U.S. , IS ADMITTED INTO DOMINICAN_REPUBLIC . LEADER OF A VIOLENT MILITIA PLEDGES ALLEGIANCE TO EXILED PRESIDENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois , one of three Haitian military_officers targeted for removal by the United States for their role in overthrowing President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , fled the country Tuesday for the Dominican_Republic . The resignation from the army and departure of a man described variously as a &quot; killer , &quot; &quot; thug &quot; and &quot; stooge &quot; by U.S. officials , signaled an important move forward in the effort to restore Aristide and force Haiti ' s military dictatorship out of power . Under U.N. resolutions and American policy , Francois , Army Commander_in_Chief Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras and Chief_of_Staff Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby must resign by Oct . 15 to avoid arrest and punishment . &quot; that ' s one out of three ; only two left , &quot; Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , said at a news_conference in Washington . The United States also engineered a second apparent victory Tuesday when Emmanuel ( Toto ) Constant , head of a violent paramilitary group and another proclaimed enemy , suddenly dropped his anti-Aristide , anti-U.S. stance and pledged nonviolence , friendship to Washington and allegiance to Aristide . U.S. officials conceded -- sometimes almost bragged -- that they had arranged Constant ' s new attitude by threatening the leader of the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti ( FRAPH ) , a military-sponsored death squad and political_party , with severe retribution if he failed to cooperate . The exiled Aristide on Tuesday urged Cedras and Biamby to follow Francois ' lead and leave Haiti -- the sooner the better . &quot; In 11 days , I will be back in Haiti , &quot; Aristide said in an address to the U.N. General_Assembly in New York . &quot; Eleven days hence I will invite you to celebrate this festival of reconciliation and democracy and of peace back home_in Haiti. &quot; If the two remaining military_men leave earlier than Oct . 15 , Aristide said , he will return earlier . Francois ' flight Tuesday removed from the scene one of the most violent and corrupt officials in what has been one of the most violent and corrupt regimes ever to rule Haiti . Once considered the most powerful man in the country , the Port-au-Prince police_chief headed for the border in the dead of night to escape embittered and frustrated followers who charged that he had betrayed them . Francois submitted his resignation from the army during the day Monday and left his home about 9 p.m. for the Dominican border crossing an hour ' s drive_away at Mal Pas , where the Dominicans blocked his entry . Close friends said the escape was moved_up from Tuesday because soldiers under his command &quot; were going_to press him to react to what happened at FRAPH Monday. &quot; In a confrontation Monday between American troops and seven Haitian police_officers who appeared to try to interfere with a U.S. raid on FRAPH offices , the Americans disarmed and arrested the police -- and publicly humiliated them by handcuffing them and wrapping the mouths of at least three with heavy tape . &quot; The ( officers ) expected Michel to react , to do something , &quot; said one associate . &quot; If they knew that he was leaving it would have been bad , very bad. &quot; Francois was accompanied by , among others , his brother Evans Francois , who is his closest adviser and a former Haitian diplomat living_in Santo Domingo , the Dominican capital . But the 37-year-old police_chief was forced to wait more_than 12 hours at Mal Pas when Dominican border guards refused him entry . Some Haitian diplomats acknowledged that Francois was held at the border because Dominican authorities had received no go-ahead from U.S. officials to let him pass . American officials later said the detention was a mistake . It wasn ' t until about 11 a.m. Tuesday that Francois and his three-car convoy bearing Dominican diplomatic license_plates were permitted through the 12-foot-high iron gate and allowed to make the five-hour drive to Santo Domingo . Back in Port-au-Prince , Constant ' s reversal of position had been preceded by peculiar developments . Constant had been constant in his pledge to resist Aristide ' s safe return despite the 20 # 000 U.S. troops here to guarantee the president ' s security . That wasn ' t his position Tuesday afternoon , when he told a news_conference arranged by the U.S. Embassy that he now accepts the U.S. soldiers and virtually pledged his allegiance to the exiled Aristide . Standing on a podium hastily constructed by the Americans at the base of a statue honoring Toussaint L ' Ouverture , the hero of Haitian independence , the spindly former Cedras aide told hundreds of massed reporters : &quot; The only solution for Haiti today is the reality of the return of Aristide . . . . Violence no longer has a place in the country . Put_down your stones , put_down your tires , no more violence , no more burning , no more beating . Peace. &quot; With American diplomats circling the scene , Constant said that FRAPH is fully cooperating with the U.S. forces all_over the country . &quot; I ' m asking everybody to lay_down their weapons , &quot; he said . As he read his statement with U.S. soldiers guarding the area , the hundreds of Haitians gathered nearby hooted and shouted : &quot; You assassin , murderer . . . . You should be handcuffed and tried_for the murders of thousands . Go_away , go away. &quot; When asked if Constant , who has been accused privately by U.S. officials of using cocaine and other drugs , had been threatened with arrest on narcotics charges , an official smiled broadly and then said with a nod and a wink , &quot; I didn ' t say that ; you did. &quot; Whatever the lever , the connection between Constant ' s shift and the U.S. Embassy was made evident by embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager ' s announcement that Constant would be holding the news_conference . In fact , Shrager wrote Constant ' s opening remarks in his embassy office between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. On Tuesday no rationale was given , even privately , for arranging a deal with Constant . &quot; The decision was made by Gen . Shelton , &quot; Shrager said , speaking_of Lt . Gen . Hugh Shelton , commander of U.S. forces here . Shrager did indicate that Constant is not home free . FRAPH was founded in August , 1993 , and is_best known here for killing and beating rampages against civilians on behalf of the military . With Constant subdued and Francois in Santo Domingo , the American focus now shifts to Cedras and Biamby , who have agreed to resign and permit Aristide ' s return . Cedras has said he will leave the army he has used to tyrannize Haiti since the Sept . 30 , 1991 , coup , but not the country . Biamby has said nothing publicly , but associates say the moody general will stay until the Oct . 15 deadline and also refuse to accept exile . Nevertheless , U.S. diplomats here and officials in Washington say they believe Cedras will give_up his commission and fly to Spain , probably Oct . 12 , the day his appointment as commander_in_chief expires . Francois left Haiti angry and embittered , according to a close business associate , charging that Cedras had sold_out the country , the army and Francois personally by accepting the presence of U.S. troops . Paradoxically , Francois , whom most experts consider the real 1991 coup leader and the strongest opponent of Aristide , broke_with Cedras and Biamby in February when he decided that Haitian resistance to Aristide ' s return would lead to disaster , his friends say . In fact , he was urged by his brother Evans to revolt against the two generals last May , when an American invasion became a distinct possibility , one associate said . &quot; But he couldn ' t do_it . He just couldn ' t move against his superior officers. &quot; Times staff writer Mark Fineman contributed to this report .</TEXT>
