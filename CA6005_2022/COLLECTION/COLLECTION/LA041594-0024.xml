   <TEXT> The finger-pointing has already begun in the wake of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ' s admission Wednesday that parts of the new Red_Line subway tunnels are misaligned and will need to be re-excavated . But regardless of who ultimately pays the price for this latest blunder , the seemingly endless series of problems that has plagued this project isn ' t going_to do much to inspire public enthusiasm for the new mass transit system . Last year a Times investigation found other safety-related problems on the Red_Line , which currently runs from Union Station to MacArthur Park . It turns_out that tunnel walls_in parts of the recently opened stretch of Red_Line were thinly constructed and as a result , some seismic experts say , might be vulnerable to earthquakes . Contractor Tutor-Saliba Corp. , which blamed the problem partly on misalignment , agreed to make and pay_for necessary repairs -- an appropriate move . With the second phase of construction at_hand , more bad news comes : Not only is the $ 165-million tunnel project nine months behind schedule , about a third of the 4.5-mile extension from MacArthur Park to Hollywood is out of alignment . A spokesman for Shea-Kiewit-Kenny , the contractor , says that &quot; anyone questioning the alignment problems . . . does not understand tunnel construction or has other motivations. &quot; that ' s possible , and surely the contractor will have its full day in the court of public_opinion . But with millions of taxpayer dollars at stake , Los Angeles transportation officials have every right to question construction methods and project management . As one incredulous MTA board_member wondered : &quot; Is this yet another question of failure of construction management ? . . . I thought we had been led to believe that problems had been resolved. &quot; So had everyone else . But it would appear that nettlesome problems in quality_control and construction methods continue to plague what is already the most expensive subway project in the nation . Franklin White , the chief_executive_officer of the MTA , who took the job only a year ago , now has another tough one in his in-box .</TEXT>
