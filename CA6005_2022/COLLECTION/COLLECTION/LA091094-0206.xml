   <TEXT> Here is the text of the abortion paragraph in the Plan_of_Action to be adopted at the U.N. International Conference on Population and Development . The language was approved Friday : In no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning.All governments and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations are urged to strengthen their commitment to women ' s health , to deal with the health impact of unsafe abortion * as a major public health concern and to reduce the recourse to abortion through expanded and improved family-planning services . Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given the highest priority , and all attempts should be made to eliminate the need for abortion . Women who have unwanted pregnancies should have ready access to reliable information and compassionate counseling . Any measures or changes related to abortion within the health system can only be determined at the national or local level according to the national legislative process . In circumstances in which abortion is not against the law , such abortion should be safe . In all cases women should have access to quality services for the management of complications arising from abortion . Post-abortion counseling , education and family-planning services should be offered promptly , which will also help to avoid repeat abortions . * &quot; Unsafe abortion is defined as a procedure for terminating an unwanted pregnancy either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment lacking the minimal medical standards or both. &quot; ( World_Health_Organization )</TEXT>
