   <HEADLINE> GUILDS SEEK BACK RESIDUALS FROM GLADDEN ; HOLLYWOOD : FILING FOR INVOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY IS MADE AGAINST BEGELMAN ' S FILM PRODUCTION COMPANY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hollywood ' s three major talent guilds on Wednesday petitioned the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles to liquidate Gladden Entertainment -- the film production company of onetime studio chief David Begelman and sports mogul Bruce McNall -- for allegedly failing to pay $ 4.1 million in residuals to actors , directors and writers . The Chapter 7 involuntary bankruptcy filing means a return to the spotlight for Gladden President Begelman , who was ousted as Columbia Pictures president in the late 1970s . In what arguably remains Hollywood ' s biggest business scandal , Begelman pleaded no contest to grand theft charges stemming from the forgery of $ 40 # 000 in checks . He later headed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and United Artists . It is also another setback for McNall , who has been sued by two banks over alleged loan defaults . As previously reported , McNall is trying to sell 65 % of his Los Angeles Kings hockey_team in a move largely designed to reduce his bank debt . McNall reduced his stake in Gladden from 50 % to 10 % in 1988 . Begelman now owns 50 % , with the rest held by foreign investors . A spokesman on Wednesday said McNall has not been actively involved with Gladden for several years , saying , &quot; Neither Mr. McNall nor any of his entities have any liability with_regard_to this matter. &quot; Calls to Gladden were not returned . Guild sources said Gladden has failed to file quarterly residuals reports for more_than a year , and scrapped arbitration proceedings scheduled for March 28 . In correspondence , Gladden executives have disputed the amount owed , and said that the guilds should be dealing with the French-owned bank Credit Lyonnais because the bank &quot; has a lien on all_of the assets of Gladden. &quot; Sources familiar_with the company say Gladden owes the bank $ 90 million . The joint move by the Screen Actors Guild , the Writers Guild of America and the Directors Guild of America is an unusually harsh action to enforce rules requiring producers to pay residuals . The guilds said that its audits showed Gladden owes $ 2.5 million to actors and owes more_than $ 1.6 million to writers and directors . Founded in 1984 , Gladden produced such films as &quot; The Fabulous Baker Boys , &quot; &quot; Weekend at Bernie ' s &quot; and &quot; Mannequin. &quot; But the company hit a cold_spell in the 1990s with such films a &quot; Short Time &quot; and 1991 ' s &quot; Mannequin II : On the Move , &quot; the last Gladden film released . At the Cannes Film Festival last year , Begelman announced that Gladden would return with a 10-film , $ 150-million distribution deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , Live Entertainment and Rank Film Distributors . 20th Century Fox , the Hollywood studio , has attached McNall ' s assets because he personally guaranteed nearly $ 5 million in_advances Fox claims Gladden owes because of the dismal performance &quot; Mannequin II. &quot; Recent court documents in that case show that the lawyers defending Gladden have withdrawn from that case because they were not paid . Meanwhile , McNall ' s deal to sell 65 % of the Kings to Jeffrey P . Sudikoff of Culver City-based IDB Communications Inc. and associate Joseph Cohen is expected to close within a week , according to Sudikoff . Details involving the $ 60-million transaction are being finalized . One of the remaining steps is an interview with NHL Commissioner Gary B . Bettman , who is in Los Angeles this week .</TEXT>
