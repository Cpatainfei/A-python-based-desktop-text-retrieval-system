   <HEADLINE> IT ' S WHAT ' S BEST FOR HER , ISN ' T IT ? ; EUTHANASIA : NO ONE IS FIT TO JUDGE THE QUALITY OF ANOTHER PERSON ' S LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I was told that her name was Mary ; our only common thread . Other_than casting quick glances toward her room , this Mary avoided that Mary . I convinced myself that I had come only to visit my great aunt who , at the time , was living_in a nursing_home . But as a regular visitor , I started taking interest in other patients , stopping often at different bedsides and wheelchairs to chat or share a pleasantry . I avoided the room where Mary lay curled in the fetal position , her face resting_on her hands , which were clasped together as if in prayer . I noticed the nurses go_into her room to turn , bathe , feed or change her ; all_the necessary things to maintain a human_being in reasonable comfort , except one . That is not why I finally went_in to see Mary . Curiosity compelled me to go_in ; not kindness , duty or love . The basest of reasons pushed me to do something that would forever change my feelings about dying , aging and our treatment of the elderly . Just inside Mary ' s door , I stood staring . She wasn ' t pretty ; I wondered if she ever had been . I noticed that there were no pictures of her as a young_woman , none of the favorite quilts , wedding or baby pictures that families put_in rooms . It was the starkness of the room that would n ' t let my eyes wander from Mary . Her face was almost continuous with her scalp , a_few wisps of hair over translucent and wrinkled skin . I knew she was blind and possibly deaf . The nurses said that she never spoke . Mary appeared to be sleeping , so I pulled_up a chair and moved closer until I was positioned next to her bed . My eyes never tired_of her . Sitting there , I began to ask myself , &quot; What is her quality_of_life ? &quot; Then , answers came_in . My thoughts were so ugly that I was embarrassed . She stirred and touched me , grasped me , pulling me forward as if to hug me . She raised herself , forcing me to reciprocate the intimacy . Then Mary relaxed and found my hands . She brought them to her face , alternately turning her cheeks so as_to kiss and touch my fingers . Her mouth felt dry but her face was wet . My hands were damp with tears , hers and mine . Then she dropped my hands , turned_on her side and resumed her fetal position . For some among us , the Marys of the world are vegetables , leaving cost effectiveness as the criterion for their treatment , life ' s intrinsic value translated into dollars and cents . The all-too-common phrases of expediency -- &quot; It ' s what ' s best for him ; It ' s what she would have wanted &quot; -- are death_knells that eventually haunt all those involved . Mary was not a vegetable . Vegetables don ' t cry . I would like to think_of her as an angel . Angels are messengers and Mary carried a message . Sometimes it takes more courage to live than it does to die . Recently passed legislation in Oregon improved the prospects for euthanasia . Coupled with abortion ' s daily assault on unborn life , this makes_it an ugly time in America to be_sick , poor , elderly , handicapped or a child in his mother ' s womb . If you believe_in angels ( and according to cash-register receipts , you must ; they are the hot-ticket item this year , the dominant theme on calendars , books and cards ) here is a gentle reminder : Spiritual fulfillment or trendy religion , across this land there is a serious soul-searching and a craving for winged guardians . But Lucifer also was an angel .</TEXT>
