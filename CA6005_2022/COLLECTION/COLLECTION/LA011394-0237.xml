   <HEADLINE> FBI COLLECTS WHITEWATER DOCUMENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> FBI_agents are sweeping up land records that could provide authorities with the first complete financial portrait of a controversial real_estate partnership between President Clinton , First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and the owner of a failed savings and loan . County officials here said Wednesday that FBI_agents had taken copies of deeds and other records of a project of the Whitewater Development Corp. , the partnership at the center of the controversy . By reconstructing the sale of 44 parcels_of_land in Whitewater ' s 200-acre development here , the FBI could get the first complete picture of how much money flowed into and out of a deal that the Clintons say cost them nearly $ 69 # 000 in losses . The records also will augment a report on Whitewater prepared_for the Clinton campaign to rebut questions about the project that were first raised during the 1992 presidential race . Some experts contend that the campaign report does not represent a clear financial picture of the venture ' s profitability . Clinton , calling the Whitewater issue &quot; ancient history , &quot; said earlier this week that it had been thoroughly investigated . However , only in recent weeks has the FBI collected hundreds of documents on the project from county offices in Arkansas and begun to compile the project ' s financial history . Officials in the Marion County clerk ' s and assessor ' s offices said that FBI_agents had visited them several times recently , examining and copying Whitewater documents . &quot; They come_in , flash their badges and start going_through records , &quot; said Mary Jo Layton , the clerk of this rural county in the Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas . &quot; They are pulling all_the deeds for Whitewater. &quot; The project was intended to create a resort community on the banks of the White_River when it was started in 1978 by the Clintons and James B . McDougal , a Clinton political confidant who later acquired Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan . Today , only a handful of houses have been built_on the site and the deal has become the focus of questions about the relationship between the Clintons and McDougal , whose savings and loan failed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of $ 47 million . The White_House asked Atty . Gen . Janet Reno Wednesday to appoint a special counsel to investigate Whitewater . Republican critics of Clinton have claimed that the White_House has not released documents that provide an accurate picture of Whitewater ' s finances . Some of the Clintons ' personal Whitewater documents were in the office of Vincent Foster , the deputy White_House counsel , when he committed suicide in July . Only recently have they been turned_over to the Justice_Department , which had requested that a grand_jury subpoena them . So far , the only financial picture of the Clintons ' involvement in the ill-fated project has come from the 1992 report prepared_for the presidential campaign . But independent experts have raised questions about the accuracy and thoroughness of that document . &quot; The report is rife_with gaps and inconsistencies , &quot; said Bert Ely , a financial consultant in Alexandria , Va. , who has been involved in many financial reconstructions . &quot; The fact is that the numbers don ' t add up. &quot; The report shows that the Clintons lost $ 68 # 900 on their investment in Whitewater . They sold their interest to McDougal for the nominal amount of $ 1 # 000 in December , 1992 . James Lyons , the Denver attorney and Clinton friend who commissioned the report in 1992 , defended the document ' s findings in an interview Wednesday . &quot; I feel absolutely confident that it is a credible and reliable document , &quot; said Lyons . &quot; It was the best we were able to do with the information we had at hand. &quot; Some records of the partnership were missing and Lyons had the report prepared by a forensic accounting_firm in Denver that specializes in financial reconstructions in difficult cases . Among the missing documents , he said , were records of a $ 550 # 000 land purchase involving Whitewater in the fall of 1986 . The White_House has said that the purchase was undertaken by McDougal and his wife , Susan , without the Clintons ' knowledge . Lyons said the working papers that he and the accounting_firm used to prepare the report had been subpoenaed by the FBI and would be turned_over next week .
