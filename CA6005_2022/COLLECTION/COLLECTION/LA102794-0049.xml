   <HEADLINE> BLACK PANTHER MURAL BACKERS REJECT FUNDING ; POLITICS : ARTS GROUP ACCUSES THE CITY OF TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE PROJECT , WHICH IS TO INCLUDE A DEPICTION OF HUEY NEWTON HOLDING A GUN . COUNCILMAN HOLDEN HAS BEEN AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Saying a battle with city officials was threatening to cripple their organization , members of a nonprofit public arts group Wednesday turned_down city funding for a controversial mural of the Black Panthers . &quot; With great pain , I say , ' We give_up , ' &quot; said Judy Baca , founder of the Social and Public Arts Resource Center , which annually produces a slate of city-sponsored public art projects . Baca said city officials had threatened to pull the plug on SPARC ' s $ 250 # 000 contract for the current budget year unless SPARC dropped the mural from its list of city-funded projects . An official at the city ' s Cultural Affairs Commission , which approved the mural earlier this month , said the contract has been held_up by paperwork . The mayor ' s office , which must sign the contract , did not respond to a request for comment . Baca said the mural probably will still be painted , without public funding , on the wall of a barbershop at 11th Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard near the Crenshaw district . Artist Noni Olabisi ' s tribute to the Black Panthers attracted considerable opposition and won approval from the city Cultural Affairs Commission only after nearly a year of debate . It was criticized for its title ( &quot; To Protect and Serve &quot; ) and the fact that it featured Panthers co-founder Huey Newton with a rifle . Baca criticized Councilman Nate Holden , in whose district the barbershop is located , for trying to stall the project even after it gained Cultural Affairs Commission approval . Holden said he wants the City_Council to formally ask that the mural site be changed . He likened placing the mural in a drug- and gang-infested area to &quot; shouting fire in a crowded theater , &quot; and asked rhetorically why the only murals of blacks &quot; that show hanging , lynching and pain are the ones in South-Central ? &quot; Holden denied trying to hold_up SPARC ' s funding , but said he would have done so if the group had not backed_down . &quot; Then I would question their motives , their . . . concern for my constituency. &quot; The 40-foot-long mural , which would be accompanied by text explaining the Black Panthers ' history , has Newton as its centerpiece , but also includes scenes of the Panthers ' breakfast program and a Panther rescue of a black_man from a Ku Klux Klan noose . Baca is one of Los Angeles ' most renowned visual artists , being the principal leader on such works as the half-mile-long &quot; Great Wall of L.A. &quot; along the Tujunga Wash . SPARC has done 73 murals in its Neighborhood Pride program since 1988 . Holden said the Panthers mural was planned for a location he called a &quot; crime scene , &quot; referring to an Oct . 13 police raid on the barber shop , Hair Expressions . The raid resulted in two arrests and the confiscation of several bags of marijuana on customers and two handguns , one in a store cabinet . Baca charged that police staged the raid in response to the Cultural Affairs Commission ' s approval of the mural a week earlier , and accused police of a smear campaign . Detective Trinka Porrata denied the accusation , saying residents had complained about the shop for months , but that the LAPD South Bureau narcotics squad was too strapped for personnel to go_to the shop before Oct . 13 . The barbershop ' s owner , meanwhile , said police had only come_by before for haircuts . Baca defended the mural , saying that although it has been pulled from her group ' s Neighborhood Pride program , she would be happy to help work_on it . She called the mural &quot; a way to dispel violence . The role_models the kids have right now are gangsters . There have never been perfect leaders -- look_at Nate Holden. &quot; She said the fact that Newton holds a gun across his chest in the mural does not make_it threatening , noting that Army recruiting posters show figures holding guns . &quot; It ' s all a question of who ' s holding them , &quot; she said . Both Baca and Holden claim that community opinion is_on their side . Baca ' s group says it held more_than a dozen meetings to get community input . Holden insists that residents have been clamoring against the mural , and that several church officials have also opposed it . &quot; I ' m not right-wing and I ' m not coming_after her ( artist Olabisi ) , and the church_members are not right-wing , &quot; Holden said . But &quot; when we ' re in a war we have to use whatever weapons we can , &quot; he told the City_Council on Wednesday , saying that banned assault weapons should not be favorably displayed on murals .</TEXT>
