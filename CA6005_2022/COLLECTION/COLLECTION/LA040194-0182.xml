   <HEADLINE> SINGAPORE AFFIRMS FLOGGING OF AMERICAN ; SOUTHEAST_ASIA : MICHAEL FAY , 18 , SHOWS NO EMOTION AT SENTENCING FOR SPRAY-PAINTING 18 CARS . ORDER THAT HE GET SIX STROKES OF A CANE DRAWS WORLDWIDE ATTENTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A court here Thursday rejected an American teen-ager ' s appeal against a sentence of flogging for spray-painting cars , saying he had pursued a &quot; calculated course of criminal conduct. &quot; Without a trace of emotion , Michael Fay , 18 , of Dayton , Ohio , was led from the high_court by police to begin serving a four-month jail term in the case , which has attracted worldwide attention because of the flogging . Marco Chan , Fay ' s stepfather , left the court without comment . Fay ' s teen-age friends packed the gallery during the appeal , and several began to cry silently as he was led away . U.S. charge d ' affaires Ralph Boyce , who attended the appeal , expressed U.S. regret at the sentence and called_on the government to reconsider . &quot; We continue to believe that caning is an excessive penalty for a youthful , nonviolent offender who pleaded guilty to reparable crimes against private_property , &quot; he said . Singapore ' s Ministry of Foreign Affairs later attacked Boyce for making his criticism in public . Fay was sentenced on March 3 to receive six strokes of a moistened rattan_cane , in addition to four months in jail and a $ 2 # 230 fine after pleading guilty to two counts of vandalism , two counts of criminal mischief and one count of possessing stolen property . He admitted to having spray-painted 18 cars . Fay appealed his caning sentence , asserting that the law did not require such a punishment in cases where the vandalism could be erased or removed . His lawyers argued that , since the spray paint was removed from the damaged cars with turpentine , it was not indelible . But Chief_Justice Yong Pung How dismissed that argument , noting : &quot; These acts of vandalism were committed relentlessly and willfully over a period of 10 days . This amounted to a calculated course of criminal conduct. &quot; According to a Singapore prison official quoted in the 1970s , caning is usually administered by a prison official trained in martial_arts . Those being punished often go_into shock after the third stroke of the cane , and scars left by the stick are usually permanent . British lawyer Michael Sherrard , who flew in from London to present Fay ' s case in Singapore ' s appeals court , said the Fay family was planning to appeal for executive_clemency from Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong . Boyce said after Thursday ' s court session that the embassy understood that the caning will not take_place while a clemency appeal is pending . But a prominent American lawmaker seemed to dash hopes for such an appeal , which would require a political decision . U.S. Sen . William S . Cohen ( R-Me. ) met separately Thursday with Lee Kwan Yew , the founding father of modern Singapore who is now a senior minister in the government , and his son , Lee Hsien Loong , the deputy prime_minister . &quot; They ' re not about to back_down , &quot; Cohen said after the meetings . &quot; They said this is a judicial matter. &quot; Cohen said he expressed concern that Fay was being singled_out for special treatment and that they both &quot; clearly indicated that this is not the case. &quot; Cohen said he did not believe that the sentence would affect U.S.-Singapore relations . The case took_on political significance here when President Clinton commented on it , calling the caning sentence extreme and asking the government to reconsider . The Singapore government reacted immediately , asserting the sentence had been handed_down to 14 others in similar circumstances , including two foreigners , and adding tartly that Singapore did not want to end_up like New York , &quot; where even the police_cars are not spared the acts of vandals. &quot; In another legal case that attracted international attention , a court here on Thursday convicted five men , including two prominent journalists , of violating Singapore ' s Official Secrets Act for allowing confidential estimates of trade figures to be published . But the five were fined and not sent to prison . Journalists had privately expressed concern that the case was designed to muzzle Singapore ' s press , which is already fairly tame . The government insisted that the case was not about press freedom but about blocking leaks of government information . Patrick Daniel , editor of Singapore Business Times , was fined $ 2 # 500 for receiving data and passing it on to the newspaper ' s readers .</TEXT>
