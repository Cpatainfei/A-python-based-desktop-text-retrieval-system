   <TEXT> Hong Doo Seung and Kim Keun Tae were both intimate participants in South_Korea ' s long legacy of institutional violence . Hong freely admits he beat enlisted men with rifle_butts and canes when he was an officer in the all-powerful South_Korean military , which ruled the nation until the democratic election of 1987 . Kim , a labor activist , suffered such excruciating electric_shocks that his throat swelled from his screams as he reached the brink of death under police torture in 1985 . Today , however , both victim and perpetrator agree that South_Korea ' s new civilian government , inaugurated last year by former dissident Kim Young Sam , is producing a striking reform : a significant reduction in violence as a means of social_control . Once omnipresent among the military and police , in the legal_system , the schools and at_home , beatings and other physical forms of coercion are being firmly rejected by a growing number of South_Koreans . In a measure of the strides made by this newly democratic nation , everyone from soldiers to parents is speaking out against the use of force -- and the protests are being heeded by the institutions that once ruled unchecked . &quot; The public ' s general consciousness is being raised very fast . People think_of themselves as independent human_beings with a right to be treated with respect rather than in a brutal , authoritarian way , &quot; said Han Sang Jin , a Seoul National University sociologist . &quot; In families , schools , the government bureaucracy and even the military barracks , the use of violence is encountering many forms of resistance. &quot; Violence as a means of social_control is hardly unique to South_Korea ; it is a hallmark of most authoritarian or military regimes . South_Koreans commonly blame their former Japanese colonial masters for teaching them the tools of terror , particularly in the military and among police . Whatever the origin , the nation ' s pointed attempt to distance itself from its legacy of brutal suppression is producing startling changes . Military_officers who used to routinely resort_to violence for discipline are being ordered to use detention or grueling training drills instead -- and are being swiftly punished when they violate that policy . At the same time , more enlisted_men are speaking out against the assaults , encouraged by top brass to register complaints in regular reporting sessions . Police , prosecutors and prison_guards are similarly refraining_from violence as a means of extracting confessions or controlling inmates , said labor activist Kim , who won the Robert F . Kennedy Human_Rights award for publicizing his ordeal . Schools , which have long used corporal_punishment , are curtailing the practice in the face of growing parental protests , according to authorities . And even in the home , the pervasive practice of wife-beating -- long regarded_as strictly a private matter -- is being openly aired as a pressing social problem . Last month , South_Korean TV viewers were given an unprecedented look_at the once-taboo issue when a popular talk_show featured one victim and her case , along with lawyers and scholars who discussed it . No presidential decree or government campaign inaugurated the trend against institutional violence . Rather , the shift appears to be a natural result of &quot; an individual awakening and a social mood that will no longer allow this kind of thing to happen , &quot; Hong said . That shift began after the 1987 presidential election of Roh Tae Woo ended three decades of authoritarian rule , but has accelerated under the Kim government , analysts say . The nation ' s newfound democracy and a greater appreciation for human_rights are not the only reasons violence is_on the wane . The shrinking size of Korean families -- from an average of six children in 1960 to 1.7 in 1993 -- has made parents more protective of their offspring , officials say . In this Confucian society , where the eldest son represents the continuation of a family ' s lineage , many will no longer tolerate their children ' s welfare being jeopardized by military_officers , police or teachers , they say . South_Korea ' s rising affluence and education levels -- as well as Western encroachment on traditional Confucian teachings to honor superiors -- are also instilling a greater resistance to violence , officials say . Choi Joon In , a Board_of_Education official in Seoul ' s southern district , said the growing ranks of professional parents , who are more educated than many teachers , are the most vocal in their protests . &quot; They don ' t ask their children why they were beaten . They simply get angry and abuse teachers with harsh language , &quot; Choi said . &quot; They believe anything their child did was right and the teacher was wrong. &quot; Such modern attitudes sharply contrast with the long tradition of corporal_punishment in South_Korea . The word for teaching itself , gyopyon , means &quot; teaching with a cane &quot; in the characters used in Korean writing . Many teachers , and some parents , still support the judicious use of the cane to whip disobedient students on the palm or calf . But critics say too many teachers lose_control and resort_to brutality . Yoo Ihlhan , a South_Korean diplomat , is one such critic . He was viciously beaten by his teacher , when he was a high_school senior in 1966 , for writing a smart-aleck answer to a quiz question . He was taken_to the school roof , where the teacher pummeled him with a stick until he was bruised and bloody . His nose was so damaged that he had to undergo surgery to restore his ability to breathe . Yet his mother blamed him for being naughty . Yoo says he has never beaten his two children , ages 11 and 15 , and would &quot; harshly protest &quot; if any teacher hit them . &quot; My generation is enough . I want my children educated through words and not violence , &quot; he said . Educators , however , say the growing public sentiment to &quot; spare the rod &quot; is producing spoiled brats and juvenile_delinquents . Both substance_abuse and violent crime among teen-agers are_on a sharp upswing . Last year , for instance , youths accounted_for 54 % of the nation ' s sexual offenses , up from 35 % in 1992 , and for 48 % of violent crime , such_as murders and robberies . The number of teens involved in crime increased by 16.2 % in 1993 over the previous year , according to Justice Ministry figures . Lee Chul Man , a teacher at Choong Dong High_School in Seoul , argues that the growing social disorder is a direct result of too_much parental laxity . He recalled a recent scene at a bookstore , where a child was making a fuss . When a middle-aged man scolded him for misbehavior , the child ' s mother snapped_at the man , &quot; Why are you breaking my child ' s spirit ? &quot; &quot; If this is what democratization produces , I think our young generation and our society will undergo a chaotic period , &quot; Lee said . At Dae Kwang High_School in Seoul , a recent student body presidential candidate campaigned on the slogan &quot; Abolish beating by teachers &quot; and won . As students have become more vocal , teachers have curtailed their corporal_punishment , said sophomore Park Pyong Min , 17 . But Park , who has been whipped by his teachers on the backside for scoring poorly on exams , said some corporal_punishment is necessary &quot; because there are guys who won ' t behave otherwise. &quot; The trade-off is apparent in the military as well . Violence has long been officially prohibited in the military , but it was widely used until social pressure began curtailing it in recent years . Today , morale among officers is low and complaints are frequent that controlling men is difficult without the intimidating tool of a rifle_butt or a cane , said Hong , the military sociologist . &quot; Before , the military was an untouchable sanctuary , but these days it is a glass room everyone can look_into , &quot; Hong said . But the military ' s legacy of abuse in South_Korea , a nation ruled by generals for three decades , has left it with little public sympathy . The turning point , analysts say , came when the democratically elected Roh government allowed unprecedented National Assembly hearings in 1988 that exposed the military ' s role in the massacre of hundreds of demonstrators in Kwangju in 1980 . In addition , the military ' s role during the 1980s in the mysterious deaths or disappearances of at least 35 soldiers , many of them labor activists , has come under_fire from such groups as the Democratic Bereaved Family Assn . Not one missing-person case has been recorded since Kim was elected and launched a shake-up of the military . Enlisted men say that beatings still occur occasionally , but at nowhere near past levels . Choi Hyong Sang , 24 , was discharged in April after completing the mandatory two years of military_service . He said he never experienced beatings , although his friend Pae Tae Ho , 24 , was kicked_in the stomach once . Rather than violence , the punishment of choice today is a grueling training drill_in which the soldier is ordered to carry pounds of military gear on his back and run_for hours , he said . &quot; The main difference is in the attitudes of soldiers , &quot; Pae said . &quot; More_than half of them are college graduates , and they won ' t take any abuses . Before , when a superior hit a subordinate , he didn ' t think he would face any consequences . Now everyone thinks , ' What if he reports ? ' &quot; Reporting improprieties is actively encouraged . Enlisted men are asked to record them in regular meetings and , unlike in the past , their complaints are acted_upon . Last year , Choi said , seven officers reprimanded for a beating in their regiment took turns beating the private who reported it . When the second incident came_to_light , all seven were arrested and placed in detention . Choi and Pae said there still is peer pressure against reporting incidents , for fear of isolation ; indeed , Pae did not report his superior who kicked him in the stomach . But they said top brass is threatening to punish officers who keep_mum . The pressure to report cases increased a_few years ago , after a soldier left a military compound without permission , went berserk and took civilians hostage at rifle point . The soldier had had disciplinary problems , but his superiors had failed to report them . Hong said violence is a legitimate tool of control in emergency combat situations , when there is no time to verbally persuade a soldier to act . Otherwise , it is an anachronistic practice unbefitting South_Korea ' s fledgling democracy , he said . Han Sang Jin ' s encounter with violence came at the hands of the justice system . The Seoul National University professor was arrested in 1970 on suspicion of being involved with the pro-Communist student movement . When he refused to sign a statement that he supported Communist ideas , he was punched_in the face , kicked and terrorized with threats that he would be taken_to a special torture room . His tormentors were prosecutors and interrogators from the then-Korean Central_Intelligence_Agency , he said . The one-week ordeal was so frightening that Han was plagued by nightmares for years . Yet Han says he was treated better than most because he was then a graduate_student at the prestigious Seoul National University . Less fortunate dissidents suffered more excruciating forms of torture , such_as needles pushed under their fingernails or electric_shock like that inflicted on labor activist Kim . Kim , whose case became an international cause_celebre after Amnesty International took it up , agreed that police have generally dropped violence and torture as tools of coercion . Instead , they keep prisoners awake all night during interrogation , make them stand and face a white wall for hours or verbally abuse them , he said . As in the military , those in the justice system who violate the new rules of nonviolence are swiftly punished . A prosecutor who hit a suspect was recently forced to resign , Kim said . South_Korea has come so far , so fast in improving its once-atrocious human_rights record that about the only outstanding issue is the National Security Law . The law has been used to arrest political_dissidents and was recently aimed at those who sent condolences to North_Korea after the death of leader Kim Il Sung . Although Kim Young Sam called_for its abolition when he was a presidential candidate , he now defends it as a necessary tool of state . But the old forms of terror are gone_for good , marking an important transition for South_Korea , say Kim Keun Tae and others . &quot; Violence by the powerful against the powerless is now punished , &quot; Kim says , &quot; and this will be the last generation of Koreans who take violence for granted. &quot; Chi Jung Nam of The Times ' Seoul Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
