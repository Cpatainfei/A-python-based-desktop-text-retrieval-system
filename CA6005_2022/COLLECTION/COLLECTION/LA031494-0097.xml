   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : THIS JORDAN FUSS IS EMBARRASSING FOR SILLY CRITICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Michael Jordan has embarrassed nobody . Michael Jordan has disgraced nothing . All the man did was play some baseball . He didn ' t ask to captain a nuclear submarine . He didn ' t ask to be President of the United States for a two-week tryout . He didn ' t ask to drive_in the Indy 500 , where he might kill somebody . He didn ' t ask to do open-heart_surgery in place of somebody ' s regular doctor . He asked if he could play some baseball . We have to get_over this overromanticized notion of a baseball field being an &quot; emerald chessboard &quot; where all_the young rooks grow_up to be bishops and kings . Baseball drips with two things -- sentimentality and tobacco_juice . You would have thought Jordan had soiled hallowed ground by trespassing onto the Grapefruit League grass , or contaminated a sterile lab . Jordan drew stares like somebody leaving muddy footprints in a Japanese restaurant . I never heard anybody howl that Shaquille O ' Neal and Penny Hardaway should steer clear of the acting profession during &quot; Blue_Chips &quot; and leave the Thespian trade to trained experts like Nick Nolte and Mary McDonnell . I never heard of Ronald Reagan or Gopher from &quot; Love Boat &quot; being disqualified from politics because they had once been actors . I never felt America ' s outrage that a football_player , Herschel Walker , had the audacity to think he could push a bobsled , or that Paul Newman planned to race an auto . But , ohhhh , heaven forbid Michael Jordan should see if his athletic prowess was such_that he could excel_at another sport before he was too old to find_out . JORDAN AND WHITE SOX ARE EMBARRASSING BASEBALL , cried the cover of Sports Illustrated ' s issue of March 14 . Funny , but I never heard of an editor from Sports Illustrated telling one of their writers : &quot; Only write_about stuff you know. &quot; How else could Jordan learn but to try ? Must he be mocked for not double-dipping during his prime , the way Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders did , hopping_on copters between stadia ? ( Anybody notice that neither Bo nor Neon Deion has ever won a professional championship in anything ? ) Must the iron-willed Mike endure ridicule because he goes hitless in his first pro at- bats ? If the majors had pulled that on Willie Mays , he never would have lasted beyond his first April . First time up in a spring intrasquad game , Michael Jordan stroked a liner to left field . He was robbed by a diving , backhanded catch . Now , I don ' t know about you , but this doesn ' t sound to me like someone who would n ' t know a Louisville Slugger bat from a Louis XVI antique chair . Far be it for me to dabble_in revisionist history , but let me tell you something , baseball lovers . Air Jordan doubles in his first at-bat , Mel Allen would n ' t have been the only one out there shouting : &quot; How a-BOUT that ? ! &quot; Here is baseball , a game that has given us such illustrious individuals as Herb Washington , a professional pinch-runner , and we can ' t even give Michael Jordan a chance ? Come_on . Where is the harm ? Baseball couldn ' t afford a_few weeks to find_out if a 6 foot 6 , supremely conditioned specimen could catch a ball or swing a stick ? Doubters told one-handed Jim Abbott he couldn ' t play , either . He could play . Some of my more righteous brothers in the ink industry have sure had a field_day with Michael . So have certain baseball professionals , like the anonymous American League manager who told that magazine : &quot; This guy thinks he can become a hitter in a_couple_of months . It ' s a disgrace to the game. &quot; It is ? No , a disgrace to a game is letting one of your outfielders pitch when there are paying customers in the stands . A disgrace is a 65-year-old man kicking dirt on an authority figure ' s shoes . A disgrace is tossing a firecracker near some fans . A disgrace is spitting indoors . A disgrace is saying of a fire-scorched town , &quot; Let it burn. &quot; A disgrace is an umpire telling a California Angel batter he ' s a . 220-hitting chump and doesn ' t deserve a call . A disgrace is a manager ' s gambling , a general_manager ' s bigotry and an owner ' s treating men like dogs and dogs like men . A disgrace is dumping ice_water on another human_being . A disgrace is televising a World_Series after midnight on a school night . A disgrace is charging a family of four $ 100 for tickets and hot dogs . A disgrace is Don Baylor telling angry Dodgers that if they don ' t like playing rough , they should &quot; wear a dress. &quot; Michael Jordan , a disgrace ? All that Michael did was what everyone in the world should do . He tried . He didn ' t sit around counting his money . He didn ' t procrastinate . He didn ' t slouch around the house , daydreaming like Walter Mitty , picturing himself at the plate against Roger Clemens , wondering : &quot; Could I have ever been a baseball_player ? &quot; He tried . The man actually , honestly , physically tried . I have always been curious whether I could have been a doctor . Nobody is stopping me from going_to med school . I could go_to law_school . Or truck-driving school ( as so many readers believe I should ) . Or even drama school . If what Shaq did was acting , man , I could do Chekhov . Could I become a Chicago Bull ? Could I become a Dodger ? Well , the problem there is , they take one look_at this Mike and say , &quot; No way. &quot; Whereas , they take one look_at that other Mike and say , &quot; Hmmm . Maybe. &quot; I seriously doubt Michael Jordan could play baseball in the majors . Except , of course , for the San Diego Padres . But he gave it a shot . So what ? He wasn ' t embarrassed . I wasn ' t embarrassed . Were you embarrassed ? Baseball supposedly was embarrassed . People sure do embarrass easy these days .</TEXT>
