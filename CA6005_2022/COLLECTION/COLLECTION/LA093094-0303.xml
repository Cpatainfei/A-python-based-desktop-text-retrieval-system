   <TEXT> The day the Mighty Ducks used their first-ever draft pick on a smallish playmaker from the University of Maine , Walt Disney Co . Chairman Michael Eisner watched as a smiling , boyish Paul Kariya pulled the Duck sweater over his shirt and tie and jet-black hair . And as he watched , standing almost alone , Eisner actually said out loud to no one in particular , &quot; Perfect . Perfect . Perfect. &quot; Eisner had seen no more_than a glimpse of the skill , speed , creativity and intuition that have made Kariya the Ducks ' best player from the moment the 19-year-old rookie stepped_on the ice with them in early September . What Eisner saw , with a corporate eye practiced in assessing the powerful appeal of idealized youth , was a boy who exuded genuineness , intelligence and modesty , mingled with the air of a talent yet to be fully seen . Kariya is the All-American kid who isn ' t American at all . He is Canadian , and his hair , along with the shape of his eyes and structure of his face , hints at his Japanese and Scottish heritage -- his father , Tetsuhiko , was born in an internment_camp in Canada during World_War_II , a difficult chapter of family history that Kariya says is rarely spoken about . All together , it is a combination that makes Kariya a powerfully appealing image of the increasingly multiethnic face of society . He is also one hell of a hockey_player -- an edge-of-your seat hockey_player who is already the second-most watchable one in Southern California . &quot; He just has that knack . . . You start to expect something when he ' s on the ice , &quot; Duck Coach Ron Wilson said . &quot; It ' s like a baseball_game , in a way . When Frank Thomas comes_to bat , you expect something , whether it ' s a great strikeout by the pitcher or a home_run . It ' s like that when you play against Wayne Gretzky . You wait for his shift because when he ' s on the ice , something could happen at any time. &quot; Anyone who saw Kariya play with the Ducks during the exhibition_season knows what Wilson means . There are the metal-to-a-magnet passes , the uncanny eye for the open man , and the rousing breakaway chances that the crowd is already learning to sense even as they unfold . So often , Kariya tries something so clever it challenges one ' s ability to describe it . A backhand pass between his legs , a spin to find room to thread a pass . In an exhibition_game against Boston in San Diego , he created a breakaway by dashing to the blue line and lifting Ray Bourque ' s stick just enough to let a pass slide under , then chased down the puck for what proved to be no more_than a missed breakaway opportunity , but a spectacular one . &quot; He doesn ' t surprise me in anything he does , because he ' s done_it at every level , &quot; Duck General_Manager Jack Ferreira said . &quot; I sure enjoy seeing it , though. &quot; The three teams that passed_on Kariya before the Ducks took him fourth in 1993 should be second-guessing themselves already . Back then , he was a skillful young forward whose size left some scouts wondering if he could make_it in the body-crunching world of the NHL . He had just won an NCAA Division I championship at Maine and become the first freshman to win the Hobey Baker award , given to the best U.S. college hockey_player -- though that has never been a guarantee of professional success . But in the year that followed , Kariya has grown a bit more solid at 5 feet 10 and truthfully , about 165 pounds -- a size not really that rare in the NHL . More important , he proved on a silver-medal winning Canadian Olympic team and gold-medal World Championships team that his skill , cleverness and elusiveness more_than make_up for his stature . &quot; I saw Paul play in the Olympics and World Championships , and even then you knew this was not a fluke or a_couple_of good games , &quot; said Duck center Stephan Lebeau , who is 10 pounds heavier but an inch or so shorter than Kariya . &quot; I knew he was good , but he ' s even better than I thought he was . And I knew he was good . &quot; There ' s no doubt this guy is going_to do things in this league . He ' s going_to be fun to watch . He surprises opponents all_the time -- even sometimes his own teammates . His passing ability is something to see. &quot; NHL players aren ' t given to hyping rookie prospects , but they have seen enough of Kariya to know he is special . &quot; I just feel him , where he is , &quot; said Anatoli Semenov , who centers the line with Kariya on the left_wing and another rookie , Valeri Karpov , on the right . &quot; Paul , you know , he ' s unbelievable player , I think . He ' s very talented. &quot; Center Bob Corkum says &quot; there are not very many guys who have been in the league a long_time who are as_good_as Paul is right now , &quot; and Lebeau , asked who Kariya resembles in the NHL , can think_of no more_than two players . &quot; You have to say Gretzky right away , that ' s for_sure . They ' re the same type of hockey_player , &quot; Lebeau said . &quot; If he ' s going_to put_up the same numbers as Gretzky , that ' s another question , but who knows ? &quot; And besides Gretzky ? Lebeau pauses , thinks . &quot; Maybe Doug Gilmour , a little bit. &quot; * The comparisons to Gretzky are not really comparisons , not in the sense that anyone is predicting Kariya will become hockey ' s all-time leading scorer or acknowledged as the greatest to play the game . They are more an attempt to describe how Kariya plays , a style that is in obvious homage to Gretzky -- right down to the fact , Wilson needles , that Kariya can be a bit lazy getting_back on defense . Kariya gave every indication during the exhibition_season that he will be a point-a-game type player , even as a rookie . Some experts even see him finishing in the top 15 in the league in scoring . But Kariya ' s career and Gretzky ' s clearly are not on parallels . Kariya will turn 20 on Oct . 16 . The year Gretzky turned 20 , he won the second of his eight consecutive NHL scoring titles , notching 109 assists in a 164-point season . &quot; The area that will have to be monitored and kept under_control is expectations relative to points , &quot; said Shawn Walsh , who was Kariya ' s coach at Maine . &quot; It ' s still an expansion team . I think once they move to the upper echelon of teams , he ' ll be a terrific point-producer . He may_not produce like that right away. &quot; But Gretzky-like ? &quot; Gretzky is in a league by himself , &quot; said Glen Sather , Gretzky ' s longtime coach in Edmonton and general_manager of the Canadian team Kariya played for at the World Championships this summer . &quot; I don ' t think anybody compares to Wayne . Wayne ' s the most superior hockey_player we ' ll see in our lifetimes . &quot; Paul Kariya is a very gifted player . He sees the ice , the way all great players do . He has great instincts , good work habits , he ' s dedicated and sincere . &quot; I don ' t know if he ' ll be a great player in this league . That takes time to prove . He ' s a rookie . He ' ll have good_nights and bad nights . He ' s not going_to step into this league and dominate right away . . . I ' m sure Paul Kariya is embarrassed if anybody tries to compare him to Wayne. &quot; As Kariya has said , &quot; To be mentioned in the same breath as Wayne Gretzky is a tremendous honor , but to me Wayne Gretzky is untouchable . Incomparable . He should be left alone on a pedestal. &quot; Still , when Kariya sets_up behind the net , he is using the advantages of that protected position in a way virtually created by Gretzky . When he makes a no-look pass or kicks the puck off his skates up_to his stick , much the same . Even when he swirls behind the play , cheating into position for a breakout pass , it is like Gretzky . So_much of what Kariya does , in fact , was directly inspired by the young Gretzky , who Kariya watched hour upon hour on videotapes as a boy . &quot; It began extremely early , and I think he identified with him because he was smaller in stature than most players , &quot; said Sharon Kariya , Paul ' s mother . &quot; To this day , when he comes_home from school or wherever he ' s been , he puts_on tapes of Wayne Gretzky . We ' ve got all_the Canada Cup games and Gretzky ' s own personal tapes . He ' s always watched them over and over . Possibly by the time he started playing junior hockey , he started watching other people too , to learn from them , but Gretzky continued to be his model. &quot; Kariya , a lonely voice growing_up in North Vancouver , British_Columbia , cheered for the Edmonton Oiler dynasty . The day Gretzky was traded to Los Angeles , his mother picked_up 13-year-old Paul at school and tried to break it to him gently . &quot; He didn ' t believe it , he absolutely could not believe it , &quot; Sharon Kariya said . &quot; I said , ' Paul , I think Wayne Gretzky is going_to be traded from Edmonton. ' He said , ' No , he ' s not. ' And I said , ' Well , I think we ' ll hear something about it on the news tonight. ' He was absolutely flabbergasted. &quot; The next day , the Kings replaced the Oilers as Kariya ' s favorite team and he never reconsidered until the day he became a Duck . He waited a year before he put_on the Duck uniform for real -- mostly because he wanted to play for Canada in the Olympics . &quot; I think he remembered one time Wayne Gretzky saying he regretted not being able to participate in the Olympics , &quot; Sharon Kariya said . * On the ice , Kariya is_full of flash and boldness and risk . Off it , he says , with his typical half-suppressed smile , &quot; I ' m a very conservative person. &quot; He arrived_at training camp addressing the 39-year-old Wilson as &quot; Mr. Wilson , &quot; until he was invited -- begged , teased and implored -- to stop . When he decided to use a sliver of his three-year , $ 6.5-million contract to buy his first car , &quot; something safe &quot; was all he had_in_mind . Sharon and T.K. , as Paul ' s father is called , have a family philosophy that one should do one ' s best to contribute , and do_it quietly . They try to be diligent that no matter what accolades their five children receive , they are treated as equals at_home . When Wilson and Ferreira had dinner at the Kariya home a_few months after the draft , it was Paul who got_up to clear the table at his mother ' s prompting . &quot; Every single time I come_home , the big thing is I have to make_up my bed , &quot; Kariya said , laughing . &quot; I wake_up every morning and my mom says , ' Did you make_up your bed ? ' I come_home , and I don ' t get treated special , probably the opposite . It brings you down to earth. &quot; Wilson nods his approval . &quot; that ' s what makes Paul so different , &quot; he said , pausing for effect . &quot; He ' s normal. &quot; That unassuming nature has been an asset every time Kariya has walked into a dressing room for the first time -- with his junior hockey_team in Penticton , B.C. , at Maine , the Olympics , the World Championships and now with the Ducks . Every time , there have been skeptics , and every time , he has won them over . &quot; I think Paul has an ability to be soft-spoken and so respectful that he commands respect because people recognize he ' s not brash and cocky , &quot; said Tom Renney , the Canadian Olympic coach . &quot; He ' s a young_man here to do business. &quot; The true moment of acceptance usually comes very early , and usually on the ice . ( Few things are more endearing than putting the puck on a player ' s stick when he ' s wide open in front of the net. ) Jim Montgomery , a college teammate now with the Montreal Canadiens , still remembers the first time he discovered Kariya ' s sixth_sense . &quot; The first time we played together , I was open for a pass , and I ' ve always been in the habit of shouting to let people know I ' m there , &quot; said Montgomery , one of Kariya ' s closest friends . &quot; Just as I started to yell , the pass came . We got_back to the bench and he said , ' I know you ' re there . You don ' t have to yell . It just lets the opposition know you ' re there. ' &quot; When Kariya arrived_at Maine , Montgomery says , &quot; the amazing thing was how smart he was and how mature he was. &quot; &quot; He was being offered all kinds of money by junior teams , but he came_to the University of Maine . He knew what he wanted out of life . If you don ' t know him , people are going_to think he ' s a little reserved or standoffish . He ' s not , he ' s just always analyzing the situation. &quot; Randy Ladouceur , the 12-year veteran who is the Ducks ' captain , has noticed how Kariya blends_in . &quot; I think he ' s bending over backward to stay out of the limelight , &quot; Ladouceur said . &quot; The last thing he ' s tried to do is flaunt things , like his money . It would be one thing if he showed_up here on the first day in a big Mercedes-Benz , but he ' s taken the shuttle from the Disneyland Hotel just like everybody else . He ' s come_in and tried to gradually acclimate , to see what ' s going_on . He really doesn ' t say a lot . He ' s taking everything day by day , kind of reading the situation. &quot; What Kariya does on the ice is sometimes so imaginative -- and sometimes so unimaginable until he does_it -- that people wonder about the connection between this thoughtful , respectful young_man and the impulsive , instinctual game he plays . &quot; He pushes the envelope in terms of his creativity . that ' s fun to watch , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; that ' s probably where he feels the most comfortable , on the ice . that ' s where he shows you his real personality. &quot; He plays with an exuberance that draws almost every eye in the building , and even as she tries to set_aside a mother ' s pride , Sharon Kariya knows it has always been that way . &quot; As a little child doing his skating lessons , you just zoomed_in to him &quot; she said . &quot; It was electrifying because you could just tell he so enjoyed doing it. &quot; The people who know Kariya best say his game is the product of an extremely analytical mind , one that anticipates actions and reactions , points and counterpoints . &quot; As much as he is very spontaneous , very creative and imaginative , that in itself is part of his game_plan , &quot; said Renney , the Canadian Olympic coach . A split-second improvisation can have a polished look , almost as if he ' s done_it before . &quot; I think it ' s something he ' s already seen , already done many times in his mind , maybe 10 , maybe 50 times , &quot; Montgomery said . &quot; When he does_it , it looks new , but it isn ' t new_to him . &quot; I know what he does the night before a game is he lies_down and listens to soft music . It ' s a mental thing , and he would n ' t really have to even listen to the tape , he knows it by heart . He gets_into a deep concentration and sees himself making plays and trying new moves. &quot; Kariya still thinks through situations at night before he goes_to_sleep , and as he sits through long_plane flights . The tape , though , is history , worn_out by constant playing . &quot; Off the ice , when you ' re sleeping in bed , it helps to visualize things , &quot; he said . &quot; Then when I ' m on the ice , it allows me to do things without thinking . Otherwise you ' re constantly doing your thinking on the ice instead of reacting and letting it flow. &quot; The same disciplined , logical mind has made every important decision in Kariya ' s life seem drawn-out and deliberate . The business major in him considered the Ducks ' contract offers with such a poker_face it unsettled as veteran a negotiator as Ferreira , who suddenly wasn ' t sure what Kariya would do at all . Kariya took weeks to decide if he would return to Maine for the fall semester before the Olympics , weeks to decide if he would go_back to Maine or start negotiating with the Ducks after the Olympics , and day upon nerve-racking day -- for the Ducks -- to decide if he would accept their last offer . &quot; He ' s never in a rush to make a decision , &quot; Montgomery said . &quot; He analyzes the pros and cons . Maybe people should learn from that , because every decision he ' s made has been the right decision. &quot; Once a decision is made , though , his creativity transforms even coaches and teammates into spectators , and anyone who has been around him long has a favorite Kariya move . &quot; The most amazing thing I ' ve seen him do , he was coming_across the blue line and he faked a drop pass to me , &quot; Montgomery said . &quot; I thought it was coming , then he takes a stride and taps it back with his skate and up_to his stick and takes a shot right off . It ' s just the things he can do with the puck and his skates that amaze me. &quot; The one that draws raves is the 360-degree spin-a-rama , a move Kariya keeps under wraps until the right moment appears . Renney remembers , &quot; there was one I saw where he came from the right boards , through the neutral zone , across the red_line all_the way to the left_wing boards , threw the puck in front of him and did a 360 as the defenseman went_to play his body . Paul put the puck through the defenseman ' s legs and then Paul is alone behind the defensemen who by that time is_on his knees . Paul picked it up behind him , all alone in front of the net. &quot; On the ice after practice or in his room watching tape , Kariya is constantly toying_with and trying to perfect his game . &quot; He ' s got that ability to be creative in looking_at himself and specifically identify areas where he can improve himself , &quot; said Walsh , the Maine coach . &quot; It ' s rare in the ' 90s to have terrific players who keep_from getting satisfied. &quot; Having an ability to improve your game off the ice is important when you grow_up in temperate North Vancouver , not exactly the land of frozen ponds and unlimited ice access . So_much of what Kariya has learned has been off a TV screen , or imagined in his mind . &quot; He ' ll go_into the back yard and practice shooting the puck , then he ' ll come_in and stick-handle on the rec_room floor , &quot; Sharon Kariya said . &quot; He spends a lot of time doing that . ( Younger brothers ) Steven and Martin play a lot with Paul and they ' re always trying new things . &quot; It hasn ' t really mattered whether he ' s playing golf , playing tennis or swimming . He studies the sport and works very diligently at improving in the sport . My husband would work with the children when they learned to do the butterfly or the breaststroke , and they ' d do_it ( in the rec_room ) before they went_into the pool. &quot; After the Olympics , where Canada lost the gold medal to Sweden in a shootout when Kariya missed the final penalty shot , breakaways became one of his little obsessions . &quot; Obviously , my breakaways need a lot of work , &quot; he said , overstating the case against himself . &quot; You always try to constantly improve . You have to analyze your game and see where you get your scoring chances . I seem to get one breakaway a game . It ' s just recognizing what you need to do . It ' s seeing where the goalie is in the net , seeing what ' s open . I always have a move_in the back of my mind , but you take what the goalie gives you. &quot; His other projects have been more unusual . A left-handed shooter , he has worked_on a right-handed wraparound shot so he can score from either side of the net without having to use his backhand . He ' s also honing a right-handed one-time shot to use when the pass is coming_to that side of his body . And one-timing the puck -- shooting off the pass in one swift motion without stopping the puck -- is so difficult there are plenty of NHL players who can ' t do_it on their natural shooting side . In another drill , he works to knock_down waist-high passes with his stick , a skill that is useful to control the puck on breakaway chances . What is his success rate ? 70 % ? 80 % ? What you want , Kariya says quietly , is 100 % . &quot; The nice thing is , he ' s a perfectionist in striving to improve , &quot; said Walsh , the Maine coach . &quot; He ' s not a perfectionist who gets caught_up or overly negative if perfection doesn ' t happen. &quot; The perfect perfectionist . Perfect .</TEXT>
