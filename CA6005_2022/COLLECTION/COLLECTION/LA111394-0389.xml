   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : SICILY ; BLOOD AND WATERMELON ; HER BLOODLINES WERE NORTHERN , BUT SHE ' D ALWAYS WANTED TO VISIT THIS ISLAND WHERE PASSIONS REPUTEDLY ROIL JUST BELOW THE SURFACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The watermelon man was armed , and he looked as though he could be dangerous . &quot; EH ! &quot; he shouted , stopping us dead in our tracks . There wasn ' t the hint of a smile on his face , there was a very large knife in his hand , and that knife was pointed menacingly our way . Our crime had been a small one , with no offense intended . My husband and I had spent the day wandering around Enna , a mountain town located high in the heart of Sicily . As in so many places on that island , human passions and long-held beliefs seemed to surge not far below even deceptive surfaces . We ate_in a little restaurant said to have been one of Mussolini ' s favorites . Although it was the sleepy part of midday , the antipasto table was stacked as if they thought the Pope just might stroll in . We walked by modern apartment_buildings festooned with garlic bulbs to guard against ancient terrors like the mal occhio ( evil_eye ) . Then we saw a truck brimming with watermelons . No big deal , except its wares were advertised by a poster of a naked woman lying_in a sea of watermelons . It made us laugh . Snap a picture , we thought . But then the watermelon man saw us . &quot; Eh ! &quot; he said gruffly , still holding_out the knife and making_it clear he didn ' t plan to let us just shuffle away . Why did we have to try to take the picture ? What geeks . Why didn ' t my father , the son of Italian immigrants , let me learn Italian as a kid ? Not that this Sicilian man was likely to understand my grandparents ' far-northern dialect , nor they his . I mumbled what I thought might be the expression for &quot; I ' m sorry. &quot; My Irish husband looked_at me as though I was nuts . But then the watermelon man made a move . Satisfied that we weren ' t going anywhere , he turned the knife away from us and plunged it into one of his watermelons . With great flourish and care , he cut_away and cut_away . We shot each other &quot; What is he doing ? &quot; looks . Finally , he plunged the knife into the wedge and then , holding the juicy fruit aloft like a prize and grinning broadly , gestured toward our camera . We were never in danger . The guy was just trying to help us make a better picture . Why photograph just a truck ? We offered to pay_for the watermelon , but he would n ' t hear of it , shaking his head at our lire and shoving watermelon wedges into our hands . I don ' t think my grandmother would have appreciated my going_to Sicily . Our family , after all , was from the north , the land that gave_birth to the Italian kings , or so as a child I was told . Even if my grandparents came here as poor as any immigrants , we had nobility coursing through our past . The southern Italians were something else again . And Sicily ? Forget about it . It was a wild land of wild people , the poorest of the poor , the brunt of jokes and the captives of_their_own passions . To my nonna , now deceased , that meant chaos . But years later , after visiting other parts of our family homeland , I remained curious about those Italians-in-the-extreme . Last summer , I finally caught an Alitalia flight bound for Sicily . * My first impression of Sicily was , well , chaos . ( OK , Grandma , OK. ) At the Catania airport , there were no signs at the baggage claim but the uniformed airport guard assured us we were at the right carousel . We weren ' t . Then getting an espresso at the airport bar was like engaging in a contact_sport ; there was no line , just a mob moving amoeba-like toward the register . Picking_up the rental car was easy enough . But then there was the drive into Catania . Italians drive fast , and Sicilians drive faster , but it wasn ' t just a matter of speed . We weren ' t in the city proper long before we realized we were hitting no traffic_lights , no stop signs , and if there were any rules of the road , no one seemed to be following them . Later , at night , walking_around the city , there seemed to be hardly any people on the streets . Particles of something soot -- ash from Mt . Etna ? -- stung our eyes , and beyond the open shutters of apartments , people lay on beds , surrendering to the heavy heat . We ate Italian food in a Chinese restaurant , about the only place we could find open at the hour . Was this what all_of Sicily would be like ? Looking_back on it , Sicily is one of the most varied places I ' ve been to . Small wonder : Since ancient times , Sicily has been held by the Greeks , the Phoenicians , the Romans , the Saracens , the Normans , the Swabians , the_French Angevins , the Spanish and , finally , the Italians , all leaving their mark . In three weeks we saw the peasant poor , the haughty rich , the graceful , the beautiful , the corrupt ; sex and piety and lives seemingly lived_out of another time . We got a broad sample the very next day . On the drive north from Catania , we passed brilliantly flowering vines , old villas left to ruin , and Etna smoking in the distance . The road cut_through mountains with towns perched precariously on top . We sped by Taormina , the seaside resort of the jet_set , until we hit Milazzo , where we would catch a ferry for the nearby Aeolian Islands . The Aeolians , sometimes known as the Liparis after the largest island in the archipelago , were to be the R &amp; R part of this trip , but they were a lot more interesting than that . On Lipari , the island we stayed_on , we climbed_up narrow , winding streets where families live one on top of the next and men hang signs for homemade Malvasia wine . Out of town , farmers eked out a living from the soil , growing tomatoes and grapes , with makeshift scarecrows to keep the birds away . On the far side of the island , pumice mines make the sea look_like pastis . We could have stayed_on Lipari for days , but other islands beckoned . Vulcano was another lesson . Vanity at times seems like an Italian national pastime , so I guess I shouldn ' t have been surprised to see people lining_up on Vulcano to breathe_in allegedly beneficial sulfur fumes seeping from a hole_in_the_ground , or lolling about in a sea made bubbly by volcanic activity . And believe me , you haven ' t seen it all until you ' ve seen a family of 12 -- grandmother , daughters , sons , grandchildren , cousins -- caked in mud said to have therapeutic qualities , yakking on the beach and passing_around sandwiches of mozzarella and prosciutto . * Back on Sicily , we headed west on the northern coast , past the Monti Nebrodi mountains , along cliff-like roads . About midway between Milazzo and Palermo , we stayed in a small beachfront town called Castel di Tusa at the Hotel L ' Atelier sul Mare . By day on the beach , pouty teenaged girls of leisure flirted_with posturing boys who played U2 loudly on car stereos . By night , families walked to the piazza on the beach to the open-air cafe to listen to the sea , laugh , debate and eat gelato . Most mornings , we took the train into Palermo , thanks to the strike that didn ' t happen . A strike is always looming in Sicily . Palermo would have given my grandmother pause . Chaos under the guise of control . It is grand , sinister , dark and gay . And perplexing . Well-heeled Palermitans read their newspapers in the lovely public gardens , but just a block or so away , you have to leap_out of the path of a pack of speeding motor_scooters . Palaces , churches and statues have survived for centuries , but damage done during World_War_II still remains . The Mafia wasn ' t exactly boasting its presence , but why do so many of the men have scars ? And the banks were equipped with state-of-the-art security_systems . But try getting an explanation as_to why changing money on that given day or that given hour was absolutely non e ' possibile . The contrasts of life in Palermo come_back in mental snapshots . An ancient-looking street with laundry billowing from the balconies and a man sitting on a step below , doing animated business on a cellular_phone . A tractor-trailer truck with a porn poster on one window and a picture of the_Virgin Mary on the other . The old priest stationed outside the chapel at Monreale and the young_women in shorts he forbade to enter . I remember a street that sold almost nothing but wedding_gowns the most opulent imaginable . Somewhere I once read that Agrigento was an unremarkable city , except for its famous Greek temples . I don ' t know what they were talking_about . True , the temples are hauntingly beautiful , whether lit_up at night or gridlocked by tourists by day . But one of the things I remember most is the passeggiata in the evenings along the sloping Via Atenea . People-watching elevated to a communal rite , the passeggiata starts every day around 6 p.m. in just about every Sicilian city and town . Families , couples , young_women and young_men , they all take_to the streets to see and be seen in this nightly stroll . The Hotel Kaos , a restored villa where we stayed , somewhat lived_up_to its name with wedding after wedding checking_in to be photographed in its elaborate gardens . Sicilians take their weddings seriously . One day we saw a car approaching with so_much white fabric in the back seat I thought it was the hotel laundry . It turned_out to be a bride . Gentle Agrigento gave_way to Sicily ' s mountainous core . What strikes you when you get_into the countryside is how incredibly empty it seems . Some 90 percent of Sicily ' s population is jam-packed into its cities and towns . But traveling through the island ' s heartland , you can be left speechless by the solitude of the panorama . The road turns_down in a small_town . Outside a bar , a girl sings into a play microphone to an old_man . He applauds with gusto . You can ' t help but smile . But in moments , you ' re back in the yellow hills again with nothing but olive_trees and pines , white rock and the play of shadow and light . Still , we were getting_the_hang of Sicily by then . We had gotten used to extremes that could change without warning . And that was a good thing , because we were to be staying in the town of Caltanissetta . It is a mostly grittily modern town , its industry mining , and judging from the graffiti , its politics socialist . We got the feeling our hotel was not exactly loved by the townspeople . Big and modern , with a convention center feel to it , it was guarded by men with automatic weapons . But unexpected things happen in places not jaded by tourists . At the train_station , a man who had gone there to see his family off insisted on giving us a ride to our hotel . Then one night , after a very good dinner in a restaurant called Cortese , we asked the owner if it would be possible to call a taxi . He said he ' d do_it for us . When we were told our ride was ready , it turned_out to be two of the owner ' s friends who had agreed to give us a lift . No money , please , the very nice gentlemen insisted . They chatted to us all_the way . Again , I wished I spoke Italian . And Caltanissetta was a good base from which to visit nearby towns . One day , we went_to Enna , home of the watermelon man . Another day , we went_to Piazza Armerina . Most people go there for the Roman villa outside town , and we did , too . But the real treat for me was Piazza Armerina itself . It turned_out that our visit coincided with the Feast of the Assumption , which , in Piazza Armerina , we learned , is a big deal . A brass_band was tuning_up on the steps of the Duomo , and a throng of people and cars was gathering in the square below as a Mass went_on inside the church . Just when the square looked as if it could hold no more , the big doors of the church swung open , and the band broke_out in a very loud , somewhat off-key rendition of what sounded like the theme from &quot; The Brady Bunch. &quot; Then the bishop appeared from within the church . Stepping_up to a microphone , the bishop began to speak . I couldn ' t tell what he was saying , but I knew his last words were a blessing . The crowd erupted : &quot; BRAVO ! &quot; Honk ! Honk ! Ah-OO-gaa , ah-OOO-gaaa ! &quot; Yea ! &quot; For fully five deafening minutes it went_on until the crowd , happily shouted-out , began to leave the square for home . Suddenly alone , we wandered through the streets . Inside houses , we could hear the intimate sounds of families and plates , and the rich smells of sauce , pasta and meat . It reminded me of Sunday afternoon suppers in my grandmother ' s kitchen . The day of our flight home , we got_to the airport early , so I had time to shop for postcards . I went_to change some lire back to dollars , and the clerk playfully tsked-tsked when , after reading my surname on my passport , learned I spoke no Italian . &quot; Sicilians speak Italian , &quot; he told me in English . &quot; But only more beautifully. &quot; Over at the airport cafe , the amoeba line was moving at its expected pace . As I neared the register , an uppity American woman tried to cut_in . &quot; It ' s what all these people do , &quot; she told the man she was with . I looked the part , and I couldn ' t resist . &quot; Scusi ! &quot; I objected , trying my best for Italian indignation . She kind of shrank away , muttering excuses . I just gave her an annoyed , noncomprehending look , and ordered un espresso , per favore . My grandma would have liked that .
