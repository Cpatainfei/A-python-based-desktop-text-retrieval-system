   <HEADLINE> THE NEW GETTY CENTER RISES ABOVE THE MASSES ; ARCHITECTURE : IN THE SEPULVEDA PASS , A STRUCTURE OF TOWERING , POWERFUL PROFILE IS TO BE THE HOME OF THE WORLD ' S MOST FORMIDABLE PRIVATE ARTS INSTITUTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To the wonderment and , no doubt , perplexity of hundreds of thousands of commuters daily , it rises in Sepulveda Pass like a 14th Century mountaintop stronghold . Sprawling along a ridge line high above the San Diego Freeway , the emerging structure of boxlike buildings and interlocking walls presents a portentous visage of money and power . Up to 800 workers at a time , like the craftsmen of a medieval city , stride its scaffolds laying Italian marble , scurry over its Olympian terraces planting trees by the thousand and scale its three-quarter-mile elevated causeway installing track for the tram that will some day connect this enclave on the_hill to the world below . Without so_much as a five-foot sign to identify their purpose , they could as easily be erecting a hotel for the unconscionably rich or a retreat for an order of ascetic monks . Neither commercial nor reclusive motives , however , are behind one of the largest construction projects under way in the western United States . The emerging wall of marble is to be a stronghold of the arts : the future home of the world ' s most formidable private arts institution , the J . Paul Getty Trust . Already 10 years in the making -- and still three years from its scheduled 1997 opening -- the $ 733-million Getty Center is now about half completed , a milestone that has prompted Getty officials to conduct an open_house this week . The informal tour will give the local news media a look inside the 110-acre college-like campus that will consolidate the Getty ' s Malibu museum with the trust ' s art history , education and conservation programs , now in rented quarters in Santa Monica and Marina del Rey . The scale and reaching ambition of New York architect Richard Meier ' s project has touched_off a flurry of debate . Though a minority decry the center ' s provocative location and massive profile , no one denies that the Getty Center has already established itself as the Los Angeles cultural landmark to eclipse all others . &quot; If God had the money , this is perhaps what he would do , &quot; said the prickly Los Angeles design critic Sam Hall Kaplan , who was prepared to hate Meier ' s architectural statement , but found he couldn ' t . &quot; The statement . . . is that this is a cultural institution here for the ages , not a passing indulgence , not a deconstructionist exercise by yet another narcissistic architect , of which there are many. &quot; Less sanguine observers have faulted the center as elitist , remote and confusing , comparing it to the Getty itself . &quot; Looking_up from the freeway below , motorists will see a series of mostly windowless marble cliffs , some as high as 120 feet above the slopes from which they spring , &quot; critic Leon Whiteson wrote in The Times . Noting that most of the criticism comes from the East , Kaplan said he detects a hidden envy that Los Angeles , and not New York , has the Getty , whose ambition , as New York Times architecture critic Paul Goldberger concedes , is &quot; to spring full-blown from the brow of this hill in Brentwood as the world ' s largest , richest , most comprehensive and most ambitious institution in the visual arts. &quot; Local commentators , indeed , could hardly restrain their expectation that the consolidated prestige of the Getty will elevate Los Angeles to the cultural status of New York and Paris . &quot; It will become one of the must-visits for anyone who has traveled , &quot; Los Angeles City_Planning Director Con Howe said . &quot; Anyone will consider it as important as the Louvre or the National Gallery. &quot; Howe , formerly a planner in New York City , said the Getty Center will be different from other great museums like the Metropolitan or the Pompidou because Los Angeles is a different kind of city from New York or Paris . Elaborating on that theme , architect David Martin said freeways have replaced rivers and grand boulevards as travel arteries . &quot; I think it ' s important for Los Angeles to have it along the freeway , &quot; Martin said . &quot; It reminds all_of the million or so people who drive it every day that there is a part of our culture that has to do with art and fineness and education . &quot; I don ' t think that ' s a bad idea to have in everybody ' s face every day , &quot; he said . The quintessential Los Angeles creation , the Getty Center may become the world ' s only important urban museum that will never be &quot; discovered &quot; by a tourist rambling the byways of a strange city . Visitors -- who may need reservations to get_in -- and employees will arrive by a Euro-style tramway from the six-level underground garage beside Sepulveda Boulevard to a formal transit stop atop the_hill . From there , the 700 Getty employees will angle north toward the working end of the institution containing administrative offices and the bulk of the Getty ' s other arts programs . The hilltop complex will feature a cafe , a restaurant , a 450-seat auditorium , gardens , fountains and panoramic views of the mountains , the Pacific and the city skyline . The centerpiece , a museum complex of pavilions ringing a garden courtyard , will house all_the existing Getty Museum ' s collections except its Greek and Roman antiquities , which will remain on the Malibu site . In the new museum , visitors will be able to see such high-priced Getty treasures as Van Gogh ' s &quot; Irises &quot; bathed in natural light , as well as holdings the public has not seen before because of limited gallery space in Malibu . Nothing like the new center exists in Los Angeles , or anywhere else . And it is unlikely that any contemporary institution but the Getty Trust , whose endowment is worth $ 4.1 billion , could afford such a project . In a sense , the center and the trust evolved together . Little known before J . Paul Getty ' s death in 1976 , the trust gained visibility as it doubled , then tripled the oil magnate ' s $ 1-billion bequest . Required by federal law to spend no less than 4.25 % of its assets each year , the trust began to sprout programs . There are now eight . They include a grants program , a high-tech art history information program , a worldwide program to promote the conservation of endangered art works and a center for the history of art and the humanities that offers yearlong fellowships to a dozen scholars . In the past , Getty Trust president Harold Williams said he wanted to give each new program its own identity , with its own directors and space . The decision to pull them all together on a campus presented the challenge &quot; not only to help create the architecture , but also to create the institution itself , &quot; Williams said . The give-and-take slowed the planning to a seven-year crawl . Along the way , costs climbed from the opening estimate of $ 360 million to the current figure of $ 733 million , bemusing some in an expectant art world . &quot; If most projects today suffer from too_little time and too_little money , &quot; observed critic Goldberger , the Getty ' s problem has been &quot; too_much time and too_much money. &quot; From the beginning , however , the project also has been molded by political compromise . The conditional-use permit obtained by the trust in 1985 imposes 107 conditions meant to mollify the wealthy and politically connected neighbors of Brentwood and Bel Air . The museum and related structures will occupy only a quarter of the 24 acres reserved for development at the top of the_hill . A height limit of 65 feet above the plaza level for the museum complex and 45 feet for the other buildings forced Meier to abandon his vision of modeling the center ' s profile after an Italian mountaintop village with turrets and towers . Even the neighborhood ' s objection that Meier ' s signature white enamel surfaces would create too_much glare prevailed . In place of the smooth , bright building skins , 180 # 000 slabs of rough-hewn beige travertine marble were imported from the same quarries that supplied the Vatican . As another accession , the center ' s seven-level , 1 # 550-space parking structure , now complete , is buried underground at the west_end of the one access_road , Getty Center Drive_off Sepulveda Boulevard . Neighbors ' concerns about traffic led to the electric tram system . Some of these accommodations may contribute to the complaint that the experience of the Getty will be too orchestrated , like a visit to Walt Disney World , where by design , random experiences are kept to a minimum . But it is , above all , the imposing location that arouses the emotion of critics . Calling it an &quot; elitist statement 25 million times worse &quot; than an ethnic slur , one architect who asked not to be named said the hilltop location represents an obvious disdain for the city below , a sentiment more suited to the 19th Century than the 20th . Countering that view , Adolfo Nodal , general_manager of the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs , praised the Getty for its street-level programs to restore a mural by Mexican artist David Siqueiros on Olvera Street and assist the Watts Towers Arts Center . &quot; It is up_on a hill , and it will be a Taj Mahal , but I think they ' re aware of that and make_sure the community gets there , and that they get_to the community. &quot; Nodal said . &quot; I think they ' re really focused now on trying to take this incredible bounty that they ' ve got_to make_sure that the people in the city are getting access to it. &quot; Getty officials themselves are confident the interplay of natural and man-made beauty will connect their center with the city below . Nothing at freeway level fully prepares the first-timer for the panoramic views at the top . &quot; We see it as a place where people will come_to see Los Angeles , &quot; said Getty Museum Director John Walsh of the new complex and its sweeping vistas . The views are memorable even when morning fog -- or worse -- limits how far the visitor can see . &quot; It ' s a place that will have lots of moods , &quot; said Walsh , who , as an art_historian , understands the power of atmospheric effects . &quot; It ' s right where the sea air plays a teasing game with dryer air inland , so fogs sometimes come_in that far and then back_off again and swirl around above you. &quot; Now little more_than concrete bones , the museum will be the center ' s big draw . Visitors will enter a two-story circular lobby , which will include a book and gift_shop and two orientation theaters . The glass-filled lobby will open_to a 61 # 000-square-foot garden courtyard . They can choose among the five gallery pavilions that make_up the museum proper . Walsh said the new museum will allow people to see many of the Getty ' s holdings , long in storage , for the first time . There will be twice as much room for displaying photographs . The Getty ' s growing collection of drawings will have more gallery space , as will its little-known collection of European sculpture . Fourteen galleries will house the Getty ' s important collection of French furniture and decorative arts . Most of the paintings will be displayed in second-story galleries normally flooded with daylight . &quot; These are rooms that have exactly the kind of lively , beautiful natural light that most pictures were painted in and intended to be seen in. &quot; The new museum will also include an area devoted to loan shows . These , he said , could include shows devoted to contemporary art and African , Asian and pre-Columbian works . Walsh and other Getty officials say they want the new center to be a place of renewal . The gardens will be a major part of the experience , they predict . Walsh said that , for many visitors , the Getty Center experience &quot; will start like MOCA and end like the Huntington , &quot; with the grounds -- and the views -- playing an important role . &quot; We want it to be a place that families feel free to come_to , &quot; Walsh said . Walsh said 1.5 million visitors a year are expected , triple what the Malibu museum can accommodate . As a result , the center will probably require visitors to make advance parking reservations , at least at first , just as the Malibu museum does . The plan is to drop the reservation requirement as soon as possible . As the opening begins to draw closer , one travertine slab and newly planted tree at a time , the one fear seems to be that the center will prove too popular . &quot; I think the problem , &quot; Walsh said , &quot; is going_to be dealing with the number of people who want to come. &quot; Times staff writer Aaron Curtiss contributed to this story .
