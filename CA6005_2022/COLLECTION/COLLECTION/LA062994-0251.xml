   <HEADLINE> CONSUMERS FACE HIKE IN COFFEE PRICES ; COMMODITIES : FOLGERS IS FIRST TO IMPLEMENT THE MARKUPS . OTHERS SAY THEY ' LL FOLLOW SUIT IN WAKE OF BRAZILIAN CROP DAMAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The damaging frost in Brazil ' s coffee-growing regions is sending shivers thousands of miles away , as consumers face immediate increases in the price of packaged coffee and beans . Coffee prices on commodity_exchanges rose to 7 1 / 2-year highs Monday and Tuesday following reports of crop-damaging frost in Brazil , the world ' s largest coffee producer . While the beans affected won ' t reach breakfast_tables for a year or more , food_companies were quick to raise prices on coffee that has already been ordered and packaged and , in many cases , is sitting on grocers ' shelves . Procter &amp; Gamble Co . was the first to raise prices , saying late Monday that it was increasing the price of its popular Folgers brand by 17 % . It could pass along further hikes if the price of green , unroasted coffee continues to soar . &quot; We are responding to the sharp increase by raising the price of Folgers by 40 cents per 13 ounces , &quot; Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman Wendy Jacques said . Folgers is sold in 13- , 26- and 39-ounce cans . The increase takes_effect immediately , Jacques said . &quot; Obviously , along with everyone , we ' ll be watching the market closely to see if any further adjustments are needed , &quot; she said . Nestle Beverage Co. , which markets Hills Bros. , Taster ' s Choice and Nescafe brands , and the A &amp; P Coffee division of Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. , which markets the 8 O ' Clock Coffee brand , said Tuesday that they will both raise their prices within days . Nan Redmond , spokesperson for Kraft General Foods ' Maxwell House Coffee , said the company is &quot; studying the situation . We are discussing it right now , but we have no announcement. &quot; Nestle , Maxwell House and Procter &amp; Gamble hold about 70 % of the retail coffee market , according to trade and industry sources . The coffee companies ' moves follow an astronomical rise in coffee futures to more_than $ 1.73 a pound , compared to 86 cents a pound in late April . A deep frost Sunday and Monday settled over vast sections of coffee-growing regions in Brazil , jeopardizing between 15 % and 30 % of next year ' s crop . Brazil produces 25 % to 30 % of the world ' s coffee , so even a 15 % loss in Brazilian output would translate into a 5 % loss in global output , said Accu-Weather , the international weather_forecasters . On Tuesday , spot July coffee contracts closed_up 10.55 cents to $ 1.70 a pound on the New York Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange . On Monday , July coffee futures jumped 33.8 cents to $ 1.59 a pound after peaking earlier at $ 1.80 , the highest since November , 1986 . Monday ' s spike was just the latest in a series of market factors that have combined to produce the highest prices for unroasted coffee since the fall of 1986 . Depressed prices in the mid-1980s turned coffee growers away from their crops in search of higher profits , and the scarcity of beans is now surfacing . In an effort to prop_up prices , member nations of the Assn . of Coffee Producing Countries in October introduced a plan to retain a percentage of exports and thereby drain reserves in consumer countries . The plan worked , and prices have climbed steadily since the end of 1993.COMMODITIES</TEXT>
