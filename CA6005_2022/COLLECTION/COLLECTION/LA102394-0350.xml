   <HEADLINE> KYRGYZSTAN VOTES ON LEGISLATIVE CHANGES ; ASIA : REFERENDUM IN FORMER SOVIET REPUBLIC IS EXPECTED TO BACK PRESIDENT . IT MAY WEAKEN DEMOCRACY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This mountainous republic has 4.2 million people , twice as_many sheep and a reputation among approving Westerners as the most liberal of the five new Central Asian_nations . On Saturday , however , Kyrgyzstan held a referendum on constitutional changes that some observers think may lead it away from democracy and toward stronger presidential rule . Official results were not available , but a turnout of better than 74 % was thought to ensure that popular President Askar Akayev will win the &quot; yes &quot; vote he seeks . &quot; It ' s a feature of our people , &quot; said Jenish Sasekbayev , a Bishkek computer specialist , after he cast his vote . &quot; Even if he has no bread in his house , a Kyrgyz will say his government is good. &quot; If the &quot; yes &quot; vote prevails , it will be partly a legacy from Soviet days , when voters knew what was expected of them . It will also mean a seal_of_approval for Akayev , a 49-year-old former math professor who has endeared himself to the West by moving his country quickly toward free-market reform but who has also dissolved his Parliament and shut_down two newspapers that criticized him . Diplomats point_out that the referendum question contradicts Kyrgyzstan ' s new constitution -- signed by Akayev -- which says that only Parliament and the constitutional court can make constitutional changes . &quot; Why play with the system so that the president can control it ? &quot; said Nikolai Kokhanov , a Communist who edits the Pravda Kyrgyzstan newspaper . &quot; The president used to say the constitution is democratic , and experts agreed . But after a year , the president decided to make changes in the constitution. &quot; The results of the referendum will determine whether Kyrgyzstan should have a slimmed-down , professional Parliament to replace the old Soviet-era legislature , which Akayev disbanded in September . Voters were also asked whether important political decisions may in the future be decided by referendum . The president ' s critics say he is trying to set_up a system that will be easier for him to control . The two-house system he prefers would put a body of 35 members in_charge of day-to-day legislative work . A larger house of 70 lawmakers would meet only occasionally . The government argues that a small , professional Parliament would be more efficient than the old legislature , whose unruly deputies were paralyzed by internal intrigue . Akayev has called_for new elections in December , but a majority of deputies said they will boycott . Perched on the Tian Shan Mountains bordering western China , Kyrgyzstan boasts spectacular scenery . Its people were sheepherding nomads until Soviet authorities forced them into collective_farms and towns . Seventy years of Soviet rule failed to erase their passion for wide open spaces . As soon as Moscow ' s rigid controls let_up , the Kyrgyz returned to an open , informal style of life . Akayev is the only Central Asian president who was never a Communist chief , and he has good relations with the International Monetary Fund and the World_Bank , which hope to spread his brand of &quot; new thinking &quot; in Central Asia . The IMF has approved a three-year loan of $ 140 million to Kyrgyzstan to support its economic and reform program until 1997 . The republic was badly hurt by the demise of the centralized Soviet economy , since most of its industries shipped in raw_materials and sent finished products elsewhere in the Soviet_Union . Now these factories cannot get supplies , and many have closed_down . Former Communist lawmakers often blame the resulting hardship on Akayev ' s policies , saying a free market helps only the rich .</TEXT>
