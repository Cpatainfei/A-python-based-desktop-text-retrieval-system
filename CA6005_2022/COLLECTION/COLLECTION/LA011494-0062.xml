   <HEADLINE> IS THERE A SECOND ACT IN NATO ' S LIFE ? ; COLD_WAR ALLIANCE STRUGGLES TO CLARIFY ITS MISSION IN NEW ERA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Testifying in 1949 before a skeptical Senate committee on the proposed NATO Treaty , Secretary_of_State Dean Acheson bluntly warned that &quot; unity in Europe requires the continuing association and support of the United States . Without it free Europe would split apart. &quot; Remarkably , nearly half a century and hundreds of billions of dollars in defense outlays later , the political rationale underlying the American commitment to the 16-member organization continues to be based foremost on the perceived need to bolster Europe ' s cohesion and stability . As a recent NATO statement put it , &quot; the transatlantic partnership remains vital for European security and stability. &quot; Recast bluntly but not unfairly from diplomatese , what that suggests is that if NATO ' s chief &quot; transatlantic &quot; partner left the alliance , Europe might very quickly revert to its old habits of internecine conflict . It ' s because maintaining continental peace and stability is seen as directly affecting U.S. national security that President Clinton has promised to keep 100 # 000 American troops in Europe . The Europeans , needless to say , are delighted . But what neither they nor the Clinton_Administration have yet provided is a coherent explanation of just what those troops are now supposed to do . WOBBLY WAYS : Originally , of course , U.S. forces -- and especially the nuclear umbrella they provided -- had a mission that was clear and understandable to ally and foe alike : to defend Western Europe by deterring aggression from the Soviet_Union . In that light the alliance succeeded . Aggression did not occur , the Soviet_Union is no more , the Warsaw Pact has been dissolved , the threat of direct aggression from the East has all but disappeared . Mission accomplished . Now , having achieved its goal , NATO is casting_about for a new role . It took a stab at defining that role at its Rome summit_meeting in 1991 when it identified instability in Eastern Europe as the major new challenge facing it . But given a chance to arrest instability in Bosnia -- and halt unconscionable abuses of human_rights at_the_same_time -- the alliance , to borrow a phrase from Margaret Thatcher , went wobbly . An organization that was ready to risk nuclear war in defense of its own principles and territory could not muster the political will to punish banditry in the Balkans . So_much for boldly meeting new challenges . NATO ' s credibility has not , of course , been wholly compromised . Witness the eagerness of four Eastern European states -- Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Slovakia -- to join the club and be sheltered under its protective military umbrella . Wisely , NATO has decided that expansion eastward , which would put NATO forces smack on the borders of the former Soviet_Union , is inadvisable at this time . Instead NATO has approved a stopgap U.S. plan , &quot; Partnership for Peace , &quot; that offers limited forms of military cooperation to the four states . They have accepted it , if not enthusiastically . But it ' s clear that some -- Poland especially -- still are pressing for full membership . AN EASTERN CHILL : The main reason for doing so is understandable . The rebirth of militant nationalism in Russia has cast a chill of fear over all nearby countries . The trouble is that to bring the four nervous eastern states into NATO now would be to say in_effect that an anti-Soviet alliance had evolved into an anti-Russian one . Such a needless misstep could only boost the fortunes of those reactionaries in Russia who despise and seek to reverse the political and economic changes under way there . What , then , is NATO to be all about , and what should it be doing to promote European stability and security ? In 1990 NATO reaffirmed that it would remain a &quot; defensive alliance. &quot; But , all_important , it has yet to say against whom the alliance is directed or what means it is prepared to use . Such vagueness is plainly not a mark of confidence and strength but of worrisome confusion .</TEXT>
