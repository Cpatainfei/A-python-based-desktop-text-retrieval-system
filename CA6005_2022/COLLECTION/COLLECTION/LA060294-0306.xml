   <HEADLINE> LESBIAN ARMY_OFFICER WINS BATTLE IN COURT ; MILITARY : FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS REINSTATEMENT OF COL . MARGARETHE CAMMERMEYER . RULING RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT ' DON ' T ASK , DON ' T TELL ' POLICY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The highest-ranking military_officer ever to challenge the armed forces over sexual orientation was ordered reinstated Wednesday in a ruling so broad as_to cast doubt on the Clinton_Administration ' s &quot; don ' t ask , don ' t tell &quot; policy for homosexuals . Army Col . Margarethe Cammermeyer , a Vietnam_War veteran and Bronze_Star recipient , won at least the first_step in her case to resume her 26-year military career . U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly ' s order held that the military could not discriminate against homosexuals just because of society ' s prejudices . &quot; Mere negative attitudes , or fear , are constitutionally impermissible bases for discriminatory governmental policies , &quot; Zilly wrote in his 51-page ruling . &quot; Prejudice , whether founded on unsubstantiated fears , cultural myths , stereotypes or erroneous assumptions , cannot be the basis for a discriminatory classification. &quot; Under longstanding but now revised rules of military_service , Cammermeyer had been forced_out of the military in 1992 after she was asked about her sexual orientation and replied that she was a lesbian . The question arose while she was being interviewed for a security clearance . At the time , her distinguished service in the Army and the National_Guard won her a great many sympathizers , including the governor of Washington and the chief nurse of the Army , who described Cammermeyer as a &quot; great American. &quot; Even in discharging her , the military rated her as qualified to lead the Army nurse corps and to represent her profession &quot; anywhere in the world. &quot; Zilly ' s decision followed at least two other federal_court rulings on behalf of members of the armed forces who were discharged for being homosexuals . All resulted from a 1991 decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , which held that the Pentagon would have to show a &quot; rational basis &quot; to sustain its policy against homosexuals . Zilly said arguments presented by two military officials -- one a general and one a former defense_secretary -- failed to meet that test . &quot; The rationales offered by the government to justify its exclusion of homosexual service members are grounded solely in prejudice , &quot; he said . &quot; Both witnesses testified to the effect that the government ' s objections to homosexual service is based solely on the fears and prejudices of heterosexual service members. &quot; Cammermeyer appeared before Zilly in April . &quot; I served for 26 years . To get all that thrown_in my face at this point about being unfit or undermining morale -- haven ' t I in some way shown that ' s not the case ? &quot; Since Cammermeyer ' s discharge , the military has changed its rules regarding sexual orientation . The current policy of the Administration is not to ask uniformed personnel about their sexual orientation but to continue to forbid homosexual behavior by men and women in the military . Attorneys who represent homosexuals said Zilly ' s ruling was significant not only because of Cammermeyer ' s high rank and long service , but because it was so sweeping as_to invite a challenge to any type of military discrimination against homosexuals . &quot; This is a terrific ruling ; it ' s very strong , &quot; said Mary Newbombe , who worked_on Cammermeyer ' s case as cooperative council for the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund , a homosexual-rights group . &quot; The rationale that Zilly used , the evidence that he considered , would apply equally to the ' don ' t ask , don ' t tell ' policy , &quot; she said . So far , there have been no court rulings on the Administration ' s military policy toward homosexuals , although a federal judge in April issued a temporary injunction forbidding the discharge of six members of the armed forces who filed suit to fight the policy . Cammermeyer , 52 , the mother of four , now works_at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital at American Lake , near Tacoma , Wash . She described herself Wednesday as &quot; absolutely ecstatic . I feel_like a kid . . . . The first thing I did was holler so everybody at the hospital knew what was going on. &quot; &quot; It seems like a vindication of all_the struggles so many of us have had . I can ' t say that I ' m speechless -- I can ' t afford to be . It ' s just very exciting. &quot; Her attorneys said they hoped Cammermeyer might instantly be reinstated with the state National_Guard . But in the two previous 9th Circuit cases -- including that of sailor Keith Meinhold , who won a lower-court ruling saying the military ' s exclusion of homosexuals was unconstitutional -- the Pentagon has appealed and very well may do so in this case too .</TEXT>
