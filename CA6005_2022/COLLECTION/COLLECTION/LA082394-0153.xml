   <HEADLINE> GLUED TO THE KEYBOARD ? TIME TO PUNCH UP A PIZZA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So you wanna order a pizza ? Well , keep_in mind that this is the digital age . First , you ' ll need a personal_computer with a modem.And a direct connection to the Internet computer_network . Oh , and some software called Mosaic , which incidentally can be kind of a pain to install but once up and running allows you to browse the &quot; World Wide Web , &quot; complete with pictures , sound and video clips . You ' re no doubt hungry now , so at the prompt , type http : / / www.pizzahut.com. Up comes an illustrated menu . All you need to do is type in your name , address , phone_number and selection . Feel_like a Super Supreme tonight ? Just click . Fiber-optic cables take_care of the rest . You pay when it arrives_at your door . Welcome to cyberspace , where Pizza Hut on Monday began testing the first pizza delivery service over the information superhighway . For the pilot_program , a Pizza Hut outlet in Santa Cruz has been hooked_up to a server at the firm ' s Wichita , Kan. , headquarters . Depending_on customer response , the service -- dubbed PizzaNet -- may be expanded to other areas after 90 days . It may_not be a huge revenue generator right now , concedes Pizza Hut technology expert Jon Payne , but the minimal cost of running it makes_it worth a try . &quot; I don ' t think this is going_to replace the phone , &quot; he said , &quot; but there are a lot of people out there signing_up for the Internet , and this is just one more way to provide_for our customers. &quot; AMY HARMON</TEXT>
