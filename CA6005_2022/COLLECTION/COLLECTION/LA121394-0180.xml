   <HEADLINE> HEALTH ; FDA TO FACILITATE PRESCRIPTION OF ADULT DRUGS FOR CHILDREN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A pediatrician who wants to prescribe a drug for a child frequently faces a confusing and potentially dangerous dilemma . More often than not , there is little or no information available about the correct dosage or possible adverse side_effects of that drug for children . As a result , children often either do not get access to the drugs that they need -- because the medicines are not officially approved for use in that age_group -- or they face the risk that they could be hurt by a drug that is administered improperly . &quot; In many instances , you ' re flying_by the seat of your pants , &quot; said David A . Kessler , commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration , who was a practicing pediatrician before assuming the federal post . &quot; It ' s not the way to practice medicine. &quot; So the FDA plans to propose new rules today designed to alleviate the problem by allowing drug_companies , in certain situations , to extrapolate guidelines from adult studies and apply them for use in children . In doing so , they would be required to revise labels and other information available to pediatricians on how the drugs should be used in children . The proposal amends a 1979 regulation that requires full clinical trials in children before a new drug can be approved for pediatric use . Many drug_companies typically don ' t conduct tests of new drugs in children because their main market for a drug is usually adults , and they may be worried about testing on youngsters . Thus , most therapies end_up being approved for adults only . Yet many doctors still routinely prescribe them for children because the drugs have come_into standard practice through physician experience -- trial_and_error . &quot; Right now when your pediatrician prescribes a drug , chances are that the drug_companies haven ' t done the studies in children , &quot; Kessler said in an interview . &quot; The data are not there . An enormously high number of drugs are being prescribed for kids where pediatricians do not have this information. &quot; The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that about 80 % of currently approved drugs have been studied and licensed for use in adults , with virtually no information available on pediatric use . Yet such drugs routinely are being used in children to treat asthma , cancer , blood_diseases , lupus , psychiatric and behavioral disorders , as well as routine ailments . Equally troubling , some drugs that are known through practice to work in children for one condition actually are licensed only for use in adults for an entirely different ailment . This could mean that a doctor unfamiliar_with standard practice either might not know of its value in treating a particular pediatric disorder or simply might be reluctant to prescribe it at all . For example , &quot; there is one drug that has only one indication -- treatment of hypertension in adults -- that is used extensively for behavioral problems in children , &quot; said Dr. Cheston Berlin Jr. , who heads a special committee on drugs for the American Academy of Pediatrics . &quot; The profession tries very hard to be as devoted to children as it can , &quot; Berlin said . &quot; We try very hard to provide patients with the right therapy , but we need more help in this area. &quot; Kessler said some of the impetus for the new rules came from a meeting he had three years ago with Elizabeth Glaser , founder of the Los Angeles-based Pediatric AIDS Foundation . Glaser , who recently died of AIDS , made a convincing case that children with AIDS deserved as much access to experimental AIDS drugs as adults , Kessler said . &quot; We realized something needed to be done , because drugs needed to be developed and studied in kids , &quot; Kessler said . The changes are expected to be quickly endorsed by the pediatric medical_community .</TEXT>
