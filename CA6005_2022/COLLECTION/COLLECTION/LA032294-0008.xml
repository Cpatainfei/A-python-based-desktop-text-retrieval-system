   <HEADLINE> A MILESTONE FOR EL_SALVADOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Given that El_Salvador ' s bitter civil_war ended only two years ago , it was inevitable that Sunday ' s national elections would be tense and marred by mistakes and possibly even fraud . But the voting was peaceful , and that is a hopeful sign . The final results are still several days_off , but preliminary tallies show the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance , or ARENA , falling_short_of a clear majority in the presidential election . That is unlikely to change as the count continues , independent election observers say . If ARENA candidate Armando Calderon Sol indeed does not win a majority , a runoff must be held within a month . That would pit Calderon Sol against the No . 2 vote-getter , Ruben Zamora , the candidate of a coalition of nine leftist parties that includes former guerrillas . Such a ballot-box confrontation would involve the same two factions that waged the 12-year-long civil_war , a stalemate that cost 75 # 000 lives . ARENA ' s leaders include former members of El_Salvador ' s military , while Zamora ' s coalition includes the five guerrilla factions that made_up the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front . There may be an almost poetic symmetry here , but a runoff would put a great_deal of added stress on El_Salvador ' s electoral machinery , still new and faced with many difficulties as it tries to bring democracy to a nation that has never known it . Voting next month also would add_to the burden of the United Nations , which brokered the negotiated settlement that led to an uneasy cease-fire in El_Salvador . The United Nations sent 900 election observers to El_Salvador to monitor Sunday ' s voting , and they noted many problems that may have affected the results . The United Nations now must prepare to mount an effort to make the final round of voting as honest and open as possible -- and to make_sure that both sides accept it as such . In that effort the world body would need support from the United States . The Clinton_Administration has tried to keep its distance from these elections , but in_view of the key role U.S. aid played in the civil_war , Washington ' s influence cannot be underestimated . Both Washington and the United Nations must work to prevent the left and the right from again trying to win power with guns . Because if that happens there will no winners in El_Salvador , only losers .</TEXT>
