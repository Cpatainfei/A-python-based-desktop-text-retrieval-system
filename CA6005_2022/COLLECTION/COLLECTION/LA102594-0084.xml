   <HEADLINE> COUNTY PREPARES FOR FLU SEASON WITH FREE SHOTS ; HEALTH : SHANGDONG , A NEW STRAIN , IS EXPECTED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS WINTER . THE VACCINATIONS ARE BEING GIVEN AT MORE THAN 300 CENTERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the onset of flu season only weeks away , Los Angeles County health officials began jabbing residents with free vaccinations Monday to minimize the annual outbreak of fevers , headaches and runny noses -- and sometimes fatal complications that can follow . Influenza shots will be administered at more_than 300 county health centers , hospitals and senior_citizens ' centers to help battle a new flu strain -- Shangdong -- expected to hit Southern California this winter . The strain was first detected in China last spring . Although most people recover from flu within a week or two , those over age 65 and people with chronic heart and lung disease , diabetes or other long-term health_problems can develop serious complications , such_as pneumonia . More_than 130 # 000 people are expected to receive publicly funded flu shots this winter in the county . And with memories of last winter ' s aches , sniffles and chills still strong , flu-wary residents poured into public health clinics Monday to take_advantage of early inoculation . Bernadene Gray , a nurse at the San Fernando Health Center , said more_than 40 people , most of them elderly , had been immunized at the clinic by lunchtime . &quot; They ' ve been calling since the beginning of October , &quot; Gray said . &quot; Some people experienced ( another kind of respiratory virus ) recently , and the older people get a little anxious . They want it immediately , so they can build_up an immunity. &quot; But Dr. Shirley Fannin , chief of communicable-disease control for the county Department of Health Services , said she expects only a mild flu season this year . She described the Shangdong strain as a &quot; garden variety &quot; virus that did not result in widespread deaths in China . Two previously known flu strains that also are circulating have mutated little , and caused only a mild outbreak in the county last year , she said . &quot; I don ' t see any of the danger signs for a heavier season , &quot; Fannin said . &quot; We have the same old virus , or varieties of virus , that have been cycling since 1967. &quot; Flu symptoms typically include fever of 100 to 103 degrees Fahrenheit in adults and higher in children , respiratory problems such_as cough , sore_throat and stuffy nose , as well as headache , muscle ache and often extreme fatigue . Complications from flu can occur at any age , but the elderly and those with chronic health_problems are much more likely to develop serious complications than younger , healthier people . Flu is associated with about 20 # 000 deaths each year in the United States , and thousands more are hospitalized , according to the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention . But flu generally affects fewer people in California , because of mild winter weather that allows_for better ventilation of homes and workplaces , Fannin said . On the East Coast , people spend much more time in the winter in rooms with closed windows and with heating and air conditioning systems that dry the air , she said . Drier air causes cracks in human mucous_membranes , which provide the virus with an entry route , Fannin said . Vaccination drives_in Southern California have been aimed at those with the highest risk -- the elderly and chronically ill people -- who are advised to be vaccinated each year . But public health officials warn that vaccine effectiveness varies from year to year , for two reasons : One , flu viruses mutate over time , with new strains attacking humans whose bodies have developed antibodies to old strains . Two , vaccines are formulated nine or 10 months before flu season actually starts . That means the virus may have altered itself before vaccines are distributed , making them less effective . Studies have shown that vaccines are 70 % to 90 % effective in preventing illness in healthy young adults . In the elderly and those with chronic health_problems , shots are often less effective , although the vaccine can reduce the severity of illness and the risk of serious complications and death . For the Flu For information on when and where free influenza shots are being given : * Contact the county Department of Health Services at ( 800 ) 427-8700 . * Free shots will be administered until Dec . 9 at more_than 300 health clinics , hospitals and senior_citizens centers throughout Los Angeles County . * The shots can also be obtained through many private doctors .</TEXT>
