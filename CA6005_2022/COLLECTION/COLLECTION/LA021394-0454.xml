   <TEXT> In preparing_for an earthquake , as in the art of war , knowledge of the enemy is the key to victory . Yet in Southern California , perhaps the most intensively studied earthquake region in the world , scientists readily acknowledge they have only the barest inkling of what ' s going_on beneath the grass , rock and asphalt on which the region rests . What they do know is unsettling : The San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles Basin balance on a cobweb of hidden thrust_faults , and the surface of Southern California is crisscrossed by 42 major faults that mark the fractured boundaries between tectonic plates . Until recently , scientists paid most attention to the faults they could see easily at the surface -- such_as the infamous San Andreas fault -- but earthquake experts are now aware that subterranean faults can be equally dangerous , adding an ominous new dimension to the earthquake threat in the Los Angeles Basin . In 10 seconds last month , that threat became manifest . A single deeply buried fault ruptured between 11 and 12 miles under Northridge , slamming the Earth above in a violent uppercut . The energy it generated was enough to kill at least 57 people , injure thousands , cripple parts of the freeway system and cause an estimated $ 30 billion damage . The forceful shaking from the quake was two to five times what San Francisco experienced in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake . Any one of the dozens of other hidden faults could rupture at any time , with just as much damage or more . Decades of scare stories about the Big One had done much to prepare Southern California for a major earthquake , but -- as the Northridge quake made instantly clear -- not nearly enough . The ability to predict an earthquake -- or even provide some early warning of a major shock as it begins -- could revolutionize the region ' s ability to withstand a major temblor . Scientists today can no more predict the next earthquake than they can predict the winning number on a roulette_wheel . But if they could afford enough of the new technology now becoming available , they might one day dare to try . Seismologists and geophysicists dream of weaving all_of Southern California together in an elaborate skein of thousands of motion sensors , seismographs , accelerometers and satellite links . Tied together by a high-speed satellite cellular network , the instruments could provide crucial early warning of a major earthquake and serve as the heart of an automated regional earthquake safety system . A network of seismographs could be installed along major known faults in Southern California , such_as the San Andreas fault , and tied into a wireless emergency network that would automatically be triggered by the first rumbles of a major earthquake seconds before the ground shocks could reach Los Angeles . Seismologists and geologists say such a system could give 20 seconds ' or 30 seconds ' warning in the event of a San Andreas earthquake -- long enough to automatically shut_down critical utility lines , sound school alarms , send high-rise elevators to open at the nearest floor , trigger stop lights , warn trains and wave_off approaching aircraft . That elaborate sensor system would also start giving scientists the kind of continuous detailed information they need about the region ' s hidden landscape of fault scarps and buried fissures . One earthquake expert recently spoke wistfully of planting seismographs every 100 yards throughout Southern California . &quot; Then we ' d learn something , &quot; he said . More detailed seismic profiles would mean better pictures of the buried faults under Southern California . That will help scientists pinpoint the source of earthquakes and better understand the stresses that trigger them . Scientists hope that once they can fathom the causes of the region ' s earthquakes , they will one day be able to issue earthquake forecasts , like tornado warnings . They are close . Barely two months before the Northridge quake , for example , a geophysicist at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory warned in the prestigious science journal Nature that the strain building_up in the Ventura Basin -- 60 % greater than that at the San Andreas fault -- could result in an earthquake of magnitude of 6.0 or greater . Of course , no one was able to predict just when that strain would trigger a lethal temblor . Just to develop a detailed seismic image of the entire Los Angeles Basin could cost millions of dollars . No state or federal agency has the money for seismic mapping on that scale . Major oil_companies that hoard a trove of detailed seismic data on the area are reluctant to open their files to outsiders . In the open desert , fractured faults exposed by erosion are easy to spot , but penetrating the mask of urban concrete that hides evidence in the Southland ' s heavily populated centers is almost impossible . Occasionally , geologists can gather the necessary city permits to set_off a blast that will generate the seismic echoes used to map new faults , but the experiments generate an avalanche of hate mail and thousands of abusive telephone_calls from people afraid that the research itself will trigger the next earthquake . In part , the effort to better understand earthquakes is hindered by regional factionalism and the federal budget crush . Thirty-seven states have a significant earthquake problem , but the hazard still is perceived mostly as a California problem . No one has been willing to sponsor additional earthquake research utilizing Southern California ' s local seismic hazards as a model for a hazard that could , in principle , just as likely strike the Midwest , New England or the Pacific Northwest . Even in Japan , where the resources devoted to earthquake preparedness dwarf those invested in California , the survival of freeways and buildings in a major earthquake is considered as much a matter of luck as rigorous preparation . Nonetheless , Tokyo alone spends an estimated $ 1 billion a year on earthquake preparations ranging from mandatory emergency drills to meticulous fire-prevention precautions . Japan is the only country with a major earthquake-prediction program integrated into its emergency disaster-planning program . Among other things , Japan has set_up an early-warning system in areas where most great quakes strike to transmit a warning as soon as the Earth begins to shake . The warning is used to safely shut_down the country ' s high-speed rail system before the damaging shock_waves reach the rails . The only emergency seismic warning system in Southern California -- a paging system -- is funded privately through Caltech because the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) doesn ' t have the money to pay_for it . Indeed , many federal geologists are frustrated by their inability to command the kinds of resources necessary to carry_out important earthquake research . For $ 100 million - less than the cost of the spy_satellites accidentally destroyed in a launch mishap at Vandenberg Air_Force Base last summer - seismologists in Southern California could wire the region from top to bottom with the sensors and seismometers necessary to understand the area ' s earthquake threat . &quot; The USGS hasn ' t hired anyone in so_long that the average age of survey scientists is 51 years old , &quot; says one senior survey geologist who specializes in earthquake predictions . &quot; We ' re such a peanut outfit we couldn ' t afford our own paging system. &quot; By ROBERT LEE HOTZ and JACK CHEEVERS</TEXT>
