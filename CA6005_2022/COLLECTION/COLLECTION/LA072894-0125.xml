   <HEADLINE> MARY LAINE YARBER : FOR PARENTS ; HELPING KIDS GET THE MOST MILEAGE FROM A VACATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' re going_away on vacation with your child this summer , there are some easy things you can do to make the experience an educational one . First , tell the child what you know about the destination and your reasons for going . Describe the sights and activities you ' re looking_forward to , and then ask what the child would like to see or do . Books can help children learn even more about the geography , history , arts and culture of your destination . I recommend the &quot; Kidding Around &quot; series for grade-school kids . It includes books and other materials covering many popular cities such_as Chicago , Atlanta , Paris and London . Each &quot; Kidding Around &quot; paperback is illustrated and costs about $ 10 . Another good series , the &quot; Insight Guides , &quot; is aimed at a teen-age audience . Each of its approximately 100 books , all with abundant color photos , offers an overview of the history and culture of a city or country . The series emphasizes European cities , but also features other places such_as Crete , Bangkok , Pakistan , Leningrad and Yemen . Each paperback volume costs $ 19.95. For a bigger perspective on travel and the world , try a children ' s atlas . The &quot; Rand McNally Children ' s World Atlas &quot; has excellent maps , drawings , photos and a thorough index . It costs $ 14.95 in hardcover . If possible , share with your son or daughter some of the area ' s culture -- such_as music , art , dress and food -- before you go . Children are usually fascinated with flags , so show the city ' s or country ' s flag , then explain the history behind its colors or symbols . Spend some time going_over maps with your child . Start with the big picture , pointing_out where you live , then your destination . Ask some questions . For example , is the place east or west of home ? How far is it ? What other cities or nations will you fly over or pass_through on the way ? Will you cross a time_zone ? Then trace the travel route on the map or globe , explaining how long you will stay and what you will do at each stop . During the actual trip , a travel journal is a fine learning tool . You can buy a blank journal in a bookstore , but I suggest making one so you can tailor it to your trip and your child . Just buy an inexpensive spiral notebook and tie a pen to it . Then and write a different topic at the top of each page each day . * Some possible topics : What ' s the hardest part of traveling ? List some similarities and differences between this culture and your own . What ' s your favorite thing about this place or culture ? Describe some interesting people you have seen or met . Besides writing , ask the child to draw pictures of places or people , and to record his or her expenditures , if any . Once you ' ve returned home , post a map on the wall and let your child retrace your route . And remember that children seem to quickly forget where they have been or what they have done . So in the next year , go_over the travel journal now and then with your child . This will help make the learning and memories more permanent . My favorite place for maps , travel books and other related learning materials is the California Map and Travel Center in Santa Monica or the Automobile Club of Southern California .</TEXT>
