   <HEADLINE> TOBACCO_INDUSTRY AD FOR PROP . 188</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hurray for school Vice Principal Nancy Frick for spotlighting the fraud of Prop . 188 , which is probably the most deceptive measure ever on the California ballot ( &quot; Educator Recants Her Ads Backing Measure , &quot; Oct . 28 ) . Frick ' s turnabout shows the trickery of Prop . 188 , which pretends to be a tough tobacco control measure . She was misled to do a pro-Prop . 188 TV ad but quickly recanted after realizing it was a sham . We hope California voters will also see_through Prop . 188 , which tobacco giant Philip Morris has bankrolled with $ 5 million . Would we expect these nicotine dealers to want reasonable curbs on smoking and cigarette vending_machines ? Not any more_than we would trust a fox to design our henhouse . Please vote no on Prop . 188 . RALPH R . OCAMPO MD President , CMA San Francisco * The tobacco_industry never ceases to amaze us ( &quot; Tobacco_Industry Drops Low Profile and Airs TV Ad , &quot; Oct . 26 ) . The industry ' s pro-Prop . 188 television ad describes the initiative as the &quot; best way to keep cigarettes away from kids. &quot; This comes just two weeks after the same tobacco_industry threatened to sue television_stations in the state for running a state_Department of Health Services ad aimed at keeping cigarettes out of the hands of children and adults . The tobacco_industry supports Prop . 188 for one simple reason -- it eviscerates AB 13 ( Terry B . Friedman , D-Brentwood ) , which will ban smoking in most indoor workplaces as of Jan . 1 . Worse yet , Prop . 188 will wipe_out some 300 local smoking ordinances and forever prevent cities from passing tough new smoking restrictions . The tobacco_industry spent over $ 2.5 million lobbying to defeat AB 13 and other smoking-related measures and lost . Now , it ' s spending over $ 18 million to erase AB 13 and every local smoking ban from the books . The real question Prop . 188 puts before the voters is this : &quot; Who do you want to write your laws -- you and your local city_council or the tobacco_industry ? &quot; DEBRA BOWEN , State Assembly D-Marina del Rey MARIAN BERGESON , State Senate R-Newport Beach * I heartily concur with A . David Rossin ( letter , Oct . 26 ) . I would gladly vote &quot; to get_rid_of the law that allows ( and invites ) making law by referendum. &quot; As a voter I ' m tired_of doing the job that elected officials of California are supposed to do . I haven ' t got the time to research these initiatives to make an informed decision . I ' m beginning to think that these prospective laws are not populist , grass-roots ideas , but rather the ideas of well-organized and well-endowed special-interest groups . I would much rather vote for the people who will make the laws , not for the laws themselves . NANCY E . JOHNSEN Redondo Beach</TEXT>
