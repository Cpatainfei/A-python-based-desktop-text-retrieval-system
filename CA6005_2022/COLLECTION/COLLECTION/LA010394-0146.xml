   <HEADLINE> BOWDEN GETS LAST LAUGH IN POLLS ; COLLEGE FOOTBALL : FLORIDA STATE IS VOTED NO . 1 BY MEDIA AND COACHES , BUT NOTRE DAME IS A CLOSE SECOND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> His Sunday morning photo session with the national championship trophy complete , Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden stepped to the podium , looked_out into the crowd of reporters , many of whom had voted the Seminoles No . 1 , and said , &quot; I ' ve been waiting a long_time to say this : ' Men , I can ' t stand y ' all. ' &quot; And with that , Bowden let_out a belly_laugh , the kind that comes_with having a USA Today / CNN coaches title in one pocket and an Associated Press title in the other . Bowden could afford to joke , especially since he no longer needed the weekly votes of the 62 media members or the 62 coaches who cast ballots in their respective polls . The Seminoles claimed both shares of the national title , but it wasn ' t exactly a mandate . Of the 62 available first-place votes_in the AP poll , once-beaten Florida State got 46 , followed by No . 2-ranked Notre Dame with 12 and No . 4 Auburn with four . If you are Bowden , so far so good . But a look_at the overall point totals revealed an electorate not entirely sure who truly was the best team in the nation : 12-1 Florida State , which squeaked past Nebraska , 18-16 , in Saturday evening ' s Orange Bowl ? Or 11-1 Notre Dame , which defeated the Seminoles during the regular season and defeated Texas A &amp; M by three in the Cotton Bowl ? Florida State earned 1 # 532 AP points , only 54 more_than Notre Dame . It was even closer in the coaches poll . There the Seminoles were rewarded with 36 first-place votes and 1 # 523 points . No . 2 Notre Dame had 25 first-place votes and 1 # 494 points . &quot; I guess that ( regular season victory against Florida State ) didn ' t count for anything , &quot; Irish Coach Lou Holtz said from Dallas on Sunday morning . &quot; Everybody said it was the Game of the Century . I guess it was the Game of the Century if the right team won. &quot; Holtz went_to_bed late Saturday night thinking the_Irish had earned at least half , if not all , of the national championship . In fact , after Notre Dame beat Texas A &amp; M , the_Irish players returned to their hotel and their fans cheered wildly when Scott Bentley ' s last-minute 22-yard field_goal proved to be the game winner for Florida State . &quot; I didn ' t think there was any possibility that we would n ' t win ( the title ) after what happened in ' 89 , &quot; Holtz said . In 1989 , Notre Dame ended the season 12-1 , with its only loss coming at the hands of Miami , which finished 11-1 that year . Using head-to-head competition as the determining factor , the poll voters presented the national championship to the Hurricanes . Holtz threw_a_fit back then , claiming that Notre Dame ' s season shouldn ' t be judged by the results of a single game . Of course , that was in 1989 . Now , with his team in the exact opposite situation , Holtz has reversed his thinking . &quot; For whatever reason , Lou Holtz is not always a popular coach with the media , &quot; he said . Added Texas A &amp; M Coach R.C. Slocum : &quot; Bobby is a grandfatherly kind of figure . I don ' t think you can find anyone in coaching to say a bad word about Bobby Bowden . There are some emotional feelings there . His teams are so close to winning it all every year , and they come_up short . Your heart just goes_out to him . &quot; So if it comes_down to Bobby Bowden and Florida State or Lou Holtz and Notre Dame , there are coaches who will say , ' Let ' s give it to Bobby. ' &quot; Holtz might want to remember that Notre Dame entered Saturday ' s bowl game ranked fourth in both polls . And while the vote was closer among the coaches , the fact remains that his peers didn ' t think enough of the_Irish to bump them above Florida State , despite the victory against the Seminoles . In the end , voters essentially were asked to make a choice between what was worse : Then-No . 1-ranked Florida State ' s seven-point loss to No . 2 Notre Dame at South Bend , or then-No . 1-ranked Notre Dame ' s 41-39 loss to visiting No . 16 Boston College . Also included in the mix were bowl day performances . For instance , would it have made a difference had the_Irish scored a more convincing victory against the seventh-ranked Aggies ? And did_it matter that Florida State ' s two-point victory came against a team rated higher than Texas A &amp; M ? Bowden said he could empathize with Holtz , but after a 28-year wait , he wasn ' t about to decline the championship . &quot; that ' s the way the poll works , &quot; Bowden said . Bowden wasn ' t afraid to do his part for the Seminoles . Taking_advantage of the arbitrary and sometimes capricious poll system , the Florida State coach voted the Seminoles No . 1 and Nebraska No . 2 on his final ballot . &quot; Maybe that was unfair , &quot; he said . The disclosure was in marked contrast to his Orange Bowl postgame comments , when he said that Notre Dame , not Nebraska , was the second-best team in the nation . Now that the title is his , Bowden , 64 , put an end to the rumors that he might resign . ESPN college analyst Lee Corso had suggested this very thing to the Seminole coach and later repeated the claim on the air . &quot; Nah , that don ' t interest me whatsoever , &quot; Bowden said . &quot; I ' d just like to coach as long as I can . I ' m half serious about it , but after you retire , there ain ' t but one big event left. &quot; Until then , Bowden will try to savor the weekend ' s big events -- a victory against a surprisingly tough Nebraska team on Saturday and a national title on Sunday . It won ' t be easy . Recruiting beckons . Holtz grouses . Critics continue to question the benefits of a system that features polls but no playoffs . Whatever happens , Bowden will no longer have to carry the weight of never having won a championship . &quot; One thing I always felt is that one of these days my team would win a national championship , &quot; he said . &quot; Yet I did realize I was running_out of years. &quot; Now he is simply running_out of trophy space . It is a problem he can live with . The Final Polls ASSOCIATED PRESS 03 # 21 , 08 # 07 Team ( 1st ) Rec . Pts 1 . Florida St . ( 46 ) 12-1-0 1 # 532 2 . Notre Dame ( 12 ) 11-1-0 1 # 478 3 .
