   <HEADLINE> UNDAUNTED BY FLOODS OF ' 93 , IOWA FARMERS PLANT SEEDS OF THEIR FUTURE ; AGRICULTURE : THE RIVERS INUNDATED VAST STRETCHES OF FARMLAND . BUT THE LAND SURVIVED , AND SO DID ITS INHABITANTS . SPRING CAME EARLY ; CROPS ARE GOING IN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The farmers of Green_Bay Bottom are racing against the rain . In fields once swallowed by a river , tractors kick_up dust , corn planters drop seeds no bigger than a thumbnail and the earth closes around them . The spring planting has begun in_earnest . From the cab of his tractor , Harold Bonar looks over his shoulder as the corn planter cuts 12 neat rows into ground littered with the ashen stubble of last summer ' s flood-ravaged soybeans . Nearly all_of the 81-acre field has been planted , but thunderstorms are brewing . And in the hours of blue_sky left to him , he must finish planting so the field can be sprayed with fertilizer and weed_killer . Ever the optimist , the ruddy-faced farmer smiles and says over the creak-creak-creak of the planter : &quot; Isn ' t this peaceful ? &quot; The river that turned Harold Bonar ' s thousand acres into a murky sea last year churns muddily along , 2 1 / 2 miles away , hidden by a rebuilt levee and a ridge of leafy green cottonwoods , willows and maples . The mighty Mississippi is a comfortable four feet below flood level . But who knows what summer will bring ? * &quot; You never know it ' s a good year until after the crops are in the bin , &quot; said Eric Burch , the 33-year-old father of two who sells seed beans , oats , beet pulp , soy hulls and other farm products from the feed-manufacturing company he operates with his wife , Kay . From Minnesota to Missouri , the Great Flood of 1993 overwhelmed farmers and fields alike . The swollen rivers of the Midwest overran cities , submerged towns and decimated crops . The flood hit Green_Bay Bottom , as this 14 # 000 acres of prime southeast Iowa farmland is known , mid-season , in the early morning hours of July 11 with a levee break . Their crop ruined , farmers pumped out the Bottoms and cleared debris from their land -- a commercial fisherman took 40 # 000 pounds of fish from the drainage_ditches in which they were trapped . They repaired their sodden homes and waterlogged machinery , all_the while knowing the vagaries of weather -- namely a wet winter -- could set them back farther come spring . But neither the runoff from winter snow nor the expected ice jams on the river proved onerous . Spring arrived early and warm . &quot; Just storybook perfect for planting so far . . . , &quot; said Nick Huston , manager of the riverfront Colusa Elevator Co. , from which Wever ' s flood-fighting efforts were launched . &quot; It had to be double perfect because we have to make_up a crop too , &quot; added Charlie Miller , a lanky , 52-year-old Iowan who finished planting his 240 acres with corn and soybeans at the end of April . Last year ' s flooding cut the corn harvest in Lee County by half ; the soybean harvest fared even worse , according to state figures . A less harsh winter and a record-breaking dry March warmed the soil enough to begin planting a week or two ahead of schedule . Across Iowa , anxious farmers took_advantage of the good_fortune . Thirty-five percent of the corn in Lee County was planted by early May , a vigorous start in a state that usually has about 6 % of its crop in the ground by then . &quot; Just beautiful weather -- the kind of weather that just makes you feel good to get_out and smell the fresh earth , &quot; said Bonar , who has planted 350 of his 1 # 100 acres . Bonar , a former Marine , sports the tattoos popular in the Corps : An eagle on his right forearm , &quot; Mom and Dad &quot; on his left . His hands , scarred and knobby , reveal his life ' s work . He has lived_on a farm for nearly all_of his 59 years . A month earlier , Harold ' s eldest son , Rick , died_unexpectedly from complications associated with an intestinal ailment . He was 39 . Like his two brothers , Rick lived within an easy walk of his parents ' farm on Green_Bay Road . Last year , father and oldest son put_in the crop , one driving a tractor that pulls the corn planter , the other planting soybeans . This spring , the father has been a lone figure in the dark fields . &quot; We just got him a new trailer house , &quot; Bonar said as he droves past his son ' s home , &quot; getting him set_up , ( then ) this come_along . It ' s been a hell of a year. &quot; But despite his personal pain , Bonar has the clear-eyed outlook of an optimist . &quot; In another 30 days , this will all be green down here , &quot; said Bonar , who has restocked his hog operation since the floodwaters forced him to sell_off his pigs last summer . &quot; I look_for a good year myself . You got_to look ahead. &quot; After three days of planting , an overnight rain kept Green_Bay Bottom farmers from their land -- if the ground is too wet , the earth is sticky and won ' t properly cover the seed . But once the crop is in the soil , an inch or two of rain is welcome to ensure that the seed germinates . &quot; Everybody says a farmer ' s hard_to_please , &quot; said Karl Pieper , who is helping his cousin Mike put_in his crop . But their livelihoods depend_on an often fickle partner . In the years before the great flood , too_little rain had been the problem . This year , too_much rain too soon could harden the soil and keep the young corn from poking through . Even with the good start this spring , and the weather notwithstanding , Wever ' s farmers will have other worries , such_as cutworms and corn_borers , as they have in the past . &quot; Farming is not just a job . It ' s a commitment , &quot; said Nadine Bonar , Harold ' s wife of 40 years . &quot; You can ' t farm one week and decide you want to do something else . Once you farm , you ' re committed. &quot; Here , farmers can gauge the moisture in the earth by the darkness of its color when it is tilled . They ride tractors equipped with CB radios and light sensors that flicker when the planter doesn ' t drop a seed . In farmhouses , a wife may monitor the weather from a scanner . She is the same woman who can sense rain when the air is too muggy . While farmers may plant more acres this season -- the government land set-asides have been lifted -- a bigger harvest could mean a lower price per bushel . &quot; Some of our neighbors are just now getting their houses fixed ( after the flood ) , so it ' s been a long process , &quot; Nadine Bonar said . &quot; But you do what you have to do. &quot; A sign tacked 15 feet high on a utility pole marks the reach of the swollen Mississippi . It reads , &quot; The Flood of ' 93. &quot; The Millers left the wheels on their trailer so they can haul it out &quot; if it floods. &quot; The front lawn Bud Pieper reseeded is finally in need of a mow .</TEXT>
