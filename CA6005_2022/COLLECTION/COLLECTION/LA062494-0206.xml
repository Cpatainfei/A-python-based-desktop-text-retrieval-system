   <HEADLINE> POLITICS ; HORIZON CLOUDY AS EU MEETS ON SUNNY GREEK ISLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The European Union ' s semiannual summit , on the Greek island of Corfu today and Saturday , was envisioned as a look_at Europe ' s future . The agenda carries an interim report on a planned multibillion-dollar trans-European network of new and upgraded rail_lines and highways that will not just bind the continent more closely in the next century , but also create thousands of jobs and a vision in the process . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , who arrived in Corfu on Thursday , will sign the first cooperation agreement between Russia and the EU . And a short time later , leaders of the union ' s 12 member states are supposed to pick a successor to Jacques Delors as president of the EU ' s Executive Commission -- the organization ' s single most powerful job . However , there is a problem : discord . Disagreements on funding surround the ambitious transportation plan , and the task of agreeing on Delors ' successor , which should have been managed in a series of discreet , gentlemanly consultations ( there are no female EU leaders ) , has turned_into a bruising and embarrassing fight . Details have even leaked_out of the smoke-filled rooms and onto the front pages of Europe ' s leading newspapers . As the summit convened , it was uncertain whether the job would go_to Belgian Prime_Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene ( the choice of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand ) , to his Dutch counterpart Ruud Lubbers ( said to be favored by the Danes and others but actively opposed by Kohl ) or possibly to a long_shot such_as Britain ' s Leon Brittan , currently the EU trade commissioner , or Ireland ' s Peter Sutherland , a former EU commissioner who presided over last autumn ' s successful round of world trade talks . Deadlock is also possible , a scenario that would most likely force the 12 into a special summit later this year . Delors ' term ends in January . With uncertainty clouding internal issues , the EU-Russia accord could wind_up as the summit ' s only event of lasting significance . Yeltsin today will sign a &quot; Partnership and Cooperation Agreement &quot; with the EU that will establish a regular , formal political dialogue between Moscow and Brussels , open the prospect of an eventual EU-Russia free-trade agreement and improve the investment climate in Russia for EU-based private companies . The accord is &quot; a milestone on_the_road toward greater economic and political stability across the entire continent , &quot; Brittan said . * Added Yuri A . Borko , of the Institute of Europe , Russian Academy of Sciences : &quot; This is a qualitatively new level of partnership and cooperation between the ( EU ) and Russia . I think we got more or less optimal conditions. &quot; In an important concession by Moscow , the agreement will progressively open the Russian market to EU-based banks , breaking a ban on contact between Russian nationals and foreign lending_institutions . Five European banks already registered in Russia can start operations immediately : ABN-AMRO Bank and INGBank of the_Netherlands , Societe General and Credit Lyonnais of France and Dresdner Bank of Germany . The EU is also expected to start opening its doors to Russian_banks . Economically , however , the pact seems to offer Moscow little in the short term , even though the EU is by far the largest importer of Russian goods . Few trade experts believe that Russian manufactured products will be competitive in the West , and in many areas where Moscow could sell more to the EU -- such_as steel , textiles and some metals -- the agreement carries restrictions . France , for example , refused to go_along with the accord until it received guarantees protecting its domestic nuclear fuel industry from cheap Russian enriched uranium . * Beth Knobel of The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report . EU ' s Give_and_Take A new European Union trade accord with Russia will draw Moscow closer to Western Europe . WHAT IT BUYS AND SELLS EU imports from Russia , 1993 : Minerals : 44 % Metals : 14 Chemicals and related products : 4 Wood : 3 EU exports to Russia , 1993 : Machinery / parts : 30 % Processed food : 16 Vehicles / aircraft : 11 Chemicals and related products : 7 Source : European Union</TEXT>
