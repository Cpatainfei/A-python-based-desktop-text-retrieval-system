   <HEADLINE> 25TH ANNIVERSARY / APOLLO 11 MISSION ; FLIGHT TO THE MOON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On July 20 , 1969 , Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon -- the first time any human had walked on the surface of another celestial_body . The journey took 420 # 000 technicians eight years and $ 25 billion to achieve . More_than 500 million people worldwide watched Armstrong on television . Saturn V Launch Vehicle First Stage * Height : 138 feet * Diameter : 33 feet * Weight : Fueled 4 # 952 , 775 lbs . * Engines : Five F-1 * Thrust : 7 # 500 , 000 lbs . Second Stage * Height : 81.5 feet * Diameter : 33 feet * Weight : Fueled 1 # 087 , 580 lbs . * Engines : Five J-2 * Thrust : 1 # 153 , 712 lbs . Third Stage * Height : 59.3 feet * Diameter : 33 feet * Weight : Fueled 1 # 087 , 580 lbs . * Engines : One J-2 * Thrust : 208 # 242 lbs . Instrument Unit : 3 feet * Panels blow apart Lunar Module Adapter Service Module Command_Module Launch Escape System Height : 82 . feet Crew : A ) Commander : Neil Armstrong B ) Lunar module pilot : Buzz Aldrin C ) Command_module pilot : Michael Collins How Big Saturn V Height : 363 ft . Space Shuttle Height : 184 ft . Going Where No Man Has Been Before The Apollo 11 manned mission to the moon set the standard for space exploration . Here is a step-by-step look_at the mission . Key : Ascent / Descent Orbit / Flight_path Flying to the Moon 1 ) Saturn launch_pad After a 28-hour countdown , the 363-foot Saturn V rocket lifted three astronauts and their equipment flawlessly off the pad in one thunderous burst and they were headed for the moon . Command and service module code name : Columbia Lunar module code name : Eagle 2 ) Columbia / Eagle Columbia mates with Eagle lunar_module and continues to moon . 3 ) Columbia module is separated from lunar_module . 4 ) Columbia continues orbiting the moon . 5 ) Eagle begins descent . 6 ) Landing site Freeze Frame : Descent On final approach looking_out his windows , Armstrong sees that the computer-chosen landing site is a large crater covered with large rocks . He takes_control and picks a new landing site . Planned flight_path Armstrong takes manual control of Eagle Armstrong ' s new flight_path Freeze Frame : ' The Giant Leap ' The craft settles_down with a jolt almost like that of a jet landing on a runway . Armstrong immediately radios Mission Control : &quot; The Eagle has landed. &quot; Later Armstrong moves down the ladder and halts on the last step , then puts his left foot on the moon and radios , &quot; that ' s one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind. &quot; Ladder Egress platform Forward hatch Windows Rendezvous radar antenna Docking hatch VHF antenna Aft equipment bay RCS thrust chamber assembly Landing_gear Landing pad Armstrong and Aldrin explored the moon ' s surface for two hours and 56 minutes , never straying more_than 200 feet from the lunar lander . With no atmosphere to carry a wind to disturb them , the footprints the astronauts left in the lunar dust should be visible for half a_million years or more . Freeze Frame : Ascent Using the descent stage as a launch_pad , ascent engines thrust the Eagle upward at 80 feet per second into lunar orbit . Descent stage left_behind Flying Back to Earth 1 ) Landing site 2 ) Eagle blast back into orbit . 3 ) Eagle : The Eagle crew transfers to command_module and leaves the rest of lunar_module behind . 4 ) Columbia : After orbiting , command_module is separated from lunar_module . 5 ) Columbia with all crew onboard fires its engines and heads fpr Earth . 6 ) Crew in command_module separates from service module and begins re-entry . They reenter and splash down in Pacific_Ocean . Freeze Frame : Splashdown After Eagle is jettisoned the Columbia begins the long journey home . Columbia splashes down 825 nautical_miles from Honolulu and is recovered by the Navy ship Hornet . Items Left Behind * The 12 astronauts who explored the moon left_behind more_than their footprints . * They also left their boots . * On the Sea of Tranquility and the Ocean of Storms , they left $ 517 million worth of equipment , momentos and junk . Among other things , the astronauts left_behind : * Six lunar vehicles worth a total of $ 270 million . * Three battery-powered moon rovers worth $ 6 million . * Five science laboratories worth $ 125 million . * Television and camera gear worth $ 4 million . * Six American flags , a plaque honoring 14 dead U.S. and Soviet spacemen , a piece of the Wright Brothers ' biplane , and two golf_balls hit by astronaut Alan B . Shepard Jr . on the longest -- and only -- drives_in the history of the moon . Source : National Aeronautics and Space Administration</TEXT>
