   <HEADLINE> A CLEAN_SLATE ; CHAKA SAYS THE NOTORIOUS TAGGER DAYS ARE BEHIND HIM , BUT SOME DOUBT HIS SINCERITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chaka crouched with a dozen spray_cans in front of a wall_in the blistering heat of the Lancaster desert . With the sweep of his right_hand , he shot bold black lines on the white surface . It was not graffiti that he sprayed , but a biblical scene : Men walking from blackness into a stunning rainbow and a golden yellow sun . Chaka , a.k.a. Daniel Bernardo Ramos , was once California ' s most notorious tagger , a Boyle Heights teen-ager who sprayed his moniker in the dark of night on 10 # 000 walls , bridges , freeway signs and lampposts between Oakland and Orange County , according to prosecutors . During his two-year spree , cut_short by arrests and drugs , he was hailed by some as an anti-Establishment hero and reviled by others as a monstrous symbol of urban blight . Today , at 22 , he has been tamed . He lives_in an all-male drug rehab center_on a dusty two-acre flood plain , awakening every day at 4:30 a.m. for prayers . Secular books , tape_recorders , radios and televisions are forbidden , as are cursing , alcohol and visitors . No cars , no phones . His Eastside homeboys and tagging partners do not know where he has gone . There are also 54 rules of conduct at the center , regulating everything from hairstyles to restroom visits during church_service . Loudspeakers almost constantly blare tapes of zealous religious sermons . Lights go_out at 9 p.m. This is the story of how a young_man from a violent housing project got caught_up in the obsessive narcissism of graffiti vandalism , helped make tagging a national phenomenon , and then let his life crash in the streets . It is also the story about how -- for now -- he is going straight , calling himself &quot; The New Chaka , &quot; yet still plagued by the wreckage of his teens . Chaka was already an infamous , shadowy figure for his prolific attacks on walls and signs when he was first arrested for vandalism four years ago . As so often happens in the culture of instant celebrity , his capture catapulted him into the klieg_lights : There was talk_of art shows , posters and T-shirts bearing his tag and even movie deals . From there , though , it was all downhill . Twenty-four hours after his release , Chaka was busted again for tagging a courtroom door . Later , he was arrested for possession of marijuana and violating his probation by carrying a marking pen . The offers evaporated . He got a 14-year-old girl pregnant . His life dissolved into a grab bag of crack cocaine , LSD and angel_dust . Now Chaka says he has reformed and found God . &quot; I came_down to the lowest of the darkest pits , &quot; he said at an outdoor table in the rehab center , speaking softly and haltingly . &quot; I sure don ' t want to go_back to that lifestyle again . I refuse . I refuse to be like the dog that runs back to eat its own vomit. &quot; Many will never forgive Chaka for the thousands of dollars of property damage that he has wrought . Although he was sentenced to 1 # 560 hours of graffiti cleanup , his subsequent arrests and jail time meant that he never carried it out . &quot; My frustration is that the community never really got paid_back and I think he still owes the community , &quot; said Peter Shutan , the former Los Angeles County prosecutor who handled Chaka ' s case . Daniel Ramos ' parents arrived in the United States from Costa Rica , settling first in Boston and then moving to Los Angeles when Chaka was 4 . Bernard Ramos , Chaka ' s father , acknowledges having a drinking problem that sometimes caused him to erupt at_home . His wife , he and others say , would often get angry and hit Chaka and his older brother , David . &quot; She blames me ; I blame her . We blame each other , &quot; said Ramos , 57 , a janitor . The Ramoses settled into the Aliso Village project in Boyle Heights , a neighborhood claimed by 14 gangs . The violence , and the threat of it , were constant . Early on , Chaka ' s teachers asked his parents to consider after-school art_classes for their boy , a request they could not afford . At 10 , Chaka -- nicknamed by his friends after a cave boy character on a Saturday morning television_show called &quot; Land of the Lost &quot; -- began smoking marijuana and angel_dust . The vandalism started one evening when his older brother , a known gang member , walked Chaka to a trash_bin a block from the neighborhood police_station , Chaka said . Vigorously shaking a can of red paint , David sprayed his street name , &quot; Shaft , &quot; and passed the can to his brother . With bold , deliberate strokes , the 16-year-old boy spelled_out in quivering block-like letters : &quot; CHAKA. &quot; &quot; My adrenaline was pumping ; it was a thrill , &quot; Chaka said . &quot; And getting_away with it -- that was too much. &quot; Suddenly , Chaka had a purpose . David had already told him that he was not welcome in his gang , and Chaka did not have the stomach for the violence . Here was something that set him apart . It was , he says now , a way_out of the apartment where his parents fought and his brother stowed guns , a way_out of a neighborhood where he had been mistaken more_than once for his brother and shot at . It was peaceful when he stole_away in the dark of night , usually staying out between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. with a knapsack loaded with 15 cans of spray paint . &quot; It ' s no different than an alcoholic , &quot; he said . The more he tagged , the more he wanted to tag . He planned his missions methodically , keeping tabs on a variety of maps . He would mark the areas he had struck with one color , and mark future targets in another . Lacking a car , he made his forays on bus , collecting a large box of bus schedules that told how far he could travel and how late the last bus ran . He stole cans of spray paint and locked them in closets at_home . &quot; My parents didn ' t say anything , &quot; he said . &quot; Before they ' d be saying anything , I ' d be out the door. &quot; He finished the 11th grade at 17 and dropped_out of high_school . He had a profession . Nearly every night , he says , he would take a bus to the end of the line and walk through a neighborhood until dawn , strategically painting his name in prominent spots along a main artery , busy intersections , or near amusement_parks or malls that kids cruised . To paint freeway signs he would dangle by a leather belt . On any one block , he usually signed his name four times : twice on each side of the street . He developed two outfits . In the rough , crime-ridden neighborhoods , he wore torn Levi ' s with an army jacket and brown leather work boots . In the middle-class neighborhoods -- Pasadena and Altadena , for example -- he donned &quot; nice , appropriate jeans , &quot; a brand-new casual jacket and dressy shoes . If the police spotted him in a well-to-do area , he had a standard response -- he was taking the bus home . &quot; I ' d bring a small book and go_to the bus_stop and read , &quot; he said . &quot; I got so good I could have gone anywhere. &quot; He became , in his own mind , a mysterious super hero speeding through the dark . The boy who felt so vulnerable in the projects began to feel invincible on this new turf . The prospects of encounters with police only made his missions more enticing . Older taggers such_as Sleez , Whisk and Prime warned Chaka that he would one day get caught . They had a saying : &quot; Just as you catch the walls -- they will catch you. &quot; To his astonishment , after two years of full-time tagging , Chaka finally got caught plastering his name on a Lincoln Heights traffic_light , three months after his 18th birthday in late 1990 . &quot; I didn ' t run_away , &quot; Chaka recalled . &quot; I assumed the cops would let me go because I was just a kid. &quot; Instead , police said , he yelled : &quot; I am the famous Chaka ! &quot; After pleading no contest to 10 counts of vandalism , Chaka spent five months in jail and a county mental_hospital . His sentence included 1 # 560 hours of graffiti clean-up . In the world of taggers , this was the ultimate insult . &quot; You don ' t take your name off the wall , &quot; said Johnny Odom , director of the Aliso Pico Community_Center , &quot; because the homeboys are going_to think that you are crossing yourself out . . . . It ' d be suicide in the ' hood . It ' d be hara-kari. &quot; * Chaka never did . Only 24 hours after being released from jail on probation , he was arrested in May , 1991 , for allegedly scrawling his name on a courthouse elevator door on his way to see his probation_officer -- a crime he still says he did not commit . Four days later , he was arrested again -- this time for trespassing on a city golf_course and possession of marijuana . In the eyes of many , he had become an arrogant young_man . When Odom asked him to remove his moniker from the community_center ' s wall , Chaka demanded to be paid_for it . More drug arrests and more jail time followed . The folk hero hype faded . In 1992 he returned again to the increasingly violent world of Boyle Heights . His brother ' s gang involvement had escalated . The family ' s apartment more_than once was strafed by rival gangs . Chaka , whose face was plastered in police_stations , could tag no more . Hounded by his lost opportunities , he got high almost constantly . He found himself ducking bullets fired by his brother ' s enemies . Outside his home , Chaka got shot above his left ankle . From then on , he said , he carried a gun . One chilly evening , as Chaka headed_home , his brother -- stoned and drunk -- mistook him for someone else and opened_fire , Chaka and others said . Hearing the commotion , Maribel Mora -- then 14 -- peeked out the window . She saw a young_man , kneeling between cars . &quot; He wasn ' t dressed like a gangster ; he had_on brown Dockers , &quot; Mora recalled . She yelled for him to duck into her family ' s apartment . Her mother , she said , gave Chaka a glass of water and turned_to her daughter , saying : &quot; This is the famous Chaka ; he is going_to do something with his life. &quot; Mora was impressed by Chaka . &quot; To us girls , it was kinda cool -- Chaka , the tagger . I know it sounds kinda dumb , but it was like an honor , &quot; she said . &quot; I didn ' t know how to watch_out for myself. &quot; Two months later , Mora learned she was pregnant with Chaka ' s child . But Chaka had little interest in a monogamous relationship with a girl six years his junior . &quot; Every night , I ' d be out , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' d be high , completely loaded . She ' d be out there with her big stomach looking_for me. &quot; When the baby was born in November , Bernard Ramos kicked open his son ' s bedroom door . &quot; You ' re nothing but a junkie ! &quot; Chaka remembers him shouting . &quot; How are you going_to support this baby ? &quot; The worst part about his father ' s rage , Chaka thought , was that he was right . &quot; I wanted to go_to college and I blew it . All these failures weighed my heart down , &quot; he said . &quot; I was hooked . I was a user. &quot; * Only five days after the birth of his son , Chaka took the tiny infant to hear a street preacher , Joseph ( Jojo ) Sanchez . Sanchez , informed by a bystander that he was talking to a street celebrity , recognized that the youth was strung out . &quot; You ' re not going_to be able to change on_your_own , &quot; Sanchez told him . Gradually , the two forged a friendship , with Sanchez urging Chaka to visit his charismatic , nondenominational rehabilitation_program in the Lancaster desert -- an invitation that Chaka kept declining . Tired of seeing Chaka stoned , Mora told him he could forget about seeing their son if he did not stop using drugs . High on PCP , Chaka burst into tears . He wept for hours . At 4 a.m. , he called Sanchez ' s program and hysterically demanded that he be picked_up . Mike Rogers , then the office manager , answered the phone . &quot; I thought someone was trying to kill him , &quot; recalled Rogers . He drove to Aliso Village and got Chaka , who was suffering flashbacks and shaking so badly he could scarcely speak . In the months since , Chaka has gone straight . Yet there is the painful reminder of responsibilities he has ignored . His son , Daniel , named after his father , is 9 months old . Maribel Mora , now an 11th-grader , is struggling to stay in school and work a part-time job . Chaka ' s piety leaves her cold . She wishes he would get a job . &quot; I know somewhere in the Bible , it ' s got_to say something about family , &quot; she said . &quot; Chaka has left us behind . My baby doesn ' t have any food ; Chaka is just doing_good for himself . Meanwhile , me and my baby are having a hard time. &quot; Chaka does not give Mora money for their child because he pays $ 200 of his monthly $ 211 welfare check to Sanchez for room and board in the program . He is not eager to re-enter the outside world . Although he will officially graduate from Sanchez ' s all-male academy in two months , he says now that he intends to stay two more years . &quot; I need to help myself before I help others , &quot; he said . &quot; This takes time ; it doesn ' t take overnight. &quot; When prosecutor Shutan last saw Chaka a_few months ago , the young_man was_full of Bible talk , but Shutan thought his words seemed forced , like mismatched jigsaw_puzzle pieces . Shutan told Chaka he doubted his sincerity . To Shutan , the story of Daniel Bernardo Ramos could still go either way . &quot; So far , the indications are that he hasn ' t grown_up yet , &quot; the prosecutor said . &quot; It doesn ' t appear that he benefited from his 15 minutes of fame . He was someone who was desperate for attention -- and got it. &quot;</TEXT>
