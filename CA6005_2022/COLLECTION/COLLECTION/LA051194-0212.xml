   <HEADLINE> NATURE OFFERS LITTLE HELP IN SEEING ECLIPSE ; ASTRONOMY : HAZE FAILS TO FRUSTRATE VIEW FROM CSUN SOLAR OBSERVATORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A blanket of haze Tuesday mocked eclipse watchers , who found that their telescopes and pinhole contraptions were of little help in_viewing what astronomers said would be the area ' s last visible solar_eclipse this century . So while most of the San Fernando Valley had trouble even telling in which direction the sun was shining , a small group of would-be astronomers gathered at Cal State Northridge ' s solar observatory in Sylmar that sank three inches during the Jan . 17 quake , rendering its two largest telescopes inoperable . Using two refracting telescopes mounted with cameras and a 3-inch Cartesian full-disc telescope , astronomy professor Stephen Walton and a handful of students and technicians who had seen many eclipses quietly watched as maximum eclipse was reached at 9 a.m. , when 72 % of the surface was obscured by the moon . &quot; This is nice , &quot; astrophysics student Chris Mach , 25 , of Los Angeles remarked dispassionately as he photographed one of the sun ' s prominences : eruptions of gaseous material that can stretch hundreds of thousands of miles above the sun ' s surface . The group ' s research helped them test the accuracy of the telescopes in measuring sunspots , areas of intense magnetic activity on the sun ' s surface that Walton said may be associated with changing weather patterns on Earth . The non-experts among the observers just wanted to know what they were seeing . &quot; So that big , round black thing . . . that ' s the moon right there ? &quot; asked a Department of Water and Power_worker who spent his coffee_break observing the eclipse through one of the small telescopes . Meanwhile , on the CSUN campus , some were hardly interested at all . &quot; It comes_on TV and that ' s safer anyway , &quot; said Dalila Valenzuela , 20 , sitting on a fog-shrouded patio outside the campus bookstore . &quot; You can ' t see it anyway , so why bother ? &quot; said student Jim Marshall , who dozed in his car during the apex of the eclipse , while waiting for his class to start . Scientists say it wasn ' t Los Angeles but El Paso , Tex. , that should have been one of the nation ' s stellar viewing locations Tuesday . It is within a 150-mile band stretching from Baja California to New England where the moon blotted_out all but the sun ' s fiery rim . But visible locally or not , the eclipse was loaded with significance for Valley astrologers , who said 20 % of it was located in the constellation Taurus . &quot; This is really a fiery new beginning , &quot; said Helene Cushman , a Tarzana astrologer whose telephone_directory ad lists her as a consultant , teacher and lecturer on the subject for 25 years . &quot; There should be more energy associated with this one . . . more people starting new businesses . It should be positive for people who know how to harness that energy , but for those who can ' t control their tempers or who drive too fast , it could be negative. &quot; Charlene Whitaker , who has been practicing astrology for 20 years in Canoga Park , said that while lunar_eclipses are symbolic of dying and diminishing , solar_eclipses bring with them periods of increasing or adding . But that is not always positive . &quot; Eclipses do set things in motion , &quot; she said . &quot; People get a little antsy . The last ( solar_eclipse , in 1993 ) was partly responsible_for the ( Northridge ) earthquake , but this one is going_to be a lot better. &quot; At Chaminade High_School in West Hills , science_teacher Dave Reeves and about 100 students battled the gloom with reflecting telescopes and telescopes mounted with cameras for about an hour before finally giving_up . &quot; It was pretty good until the cloud came_by , &quot; said Reeves . In the end , a_few of his students even moved_on to Simi Valley in search of sunnier skies . Cloudless blue_skies in the Antelope Valley created some of the best viewing conditions in Southern California , but that didn ' t mean everyone in the high desert was consumed by the eclipse . &quot; I missed it , &quot; said Palmdale resident Paul Heindel . &quot; I was in a meeting , I think . I can ' t remember. &quot; Heindel said he did not make_a_point of seeing the eclipse because &quot; I ' ve seen them. &quot; At the Antelope Valley Fair in Lancaster , several employees did venture outside to watch the sun all but disappear in the shadow of the moon . But not all_of them actually got a chance to witness the celestial event . Fair Manager Bruce Latta said , &quot; I went outside and stood under a tree and talked to someone and never looked_up . I didn ' t have anything to look through. &quot; Employees at NASA ' s Dryden Flight Research_Center didn ' t have to worry about protecting their eyes with welder ' s goggles or other filters because the eclipse was carried_on the space agency ' s in-house television_system , NASA TV . Cameras in five locations across the country -- including the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , the Johnson Space Center in Houston and the Kennedy Space Center in Florida -- provided views of the eclipse to NASA employees and anyone with a satellite able to pick_up NASA TV . At the Griffith Observatory , a traditional Los Angeles gathering spot for observing astronomical phenomena , eye protection was also the furthest thing from the minds of the 800 or so who showed_up to view the eclipse . Solar sunglass salesman Roger Harrison of Glendora said he had sold fewer than 30 of his $ 4 smoky lenses . When told that the next solar_eclipse would not be visible in the United States until 2012 , he promised , &quot; I ' ll be back. &quot; Times staff writer Bob Pool and special correspondent Sharon Moeser contributed to this story .</TEXT>
