   <HEADLINE> FRUSTRATED CLINTON ASSAILS FALWELL AND LIMBAUGH ; INTERVIEW : MIX OF POLITICS AND RELIGION FEEDS INTOLERANCE AND CYNICISM , PRESIDENT SAYS . HE ACCUSES TELEVANGELIST OF MAKING BASELESS ATTACKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton on Friday joined the growing cultural and political war between Democrats and their critics on the right , bitterly assailing Christian broadcasters and conservative radio talk-show hosts . In unusually angry and aggressive remarks during a radio interview , Clinton attacked the Rev . Jerry Falwell and popular radio personality Rush Limbaugh by name , saying that their brand of politics and religion feed a spreading intolerance and cynicism across America . The tenor and heat of his remarks showed what is increasingly becoming apparent -- that for those in the roiling political battle , this is less a contest between strong adversaries with some mutual respect than a holy war fueled by bitterness and personal loathing . Clinton spoke by telephone from Air_Force One as he was flying to St . Louis to inaugurate a youth service_program and headline a $ 1 # 500-a-plate fund-raiser for House Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) . The President said that televangelist Falwell and other spokesmen for the religious right hide behind their fervent protestations of faith while engaging in baseless personal attacks and political demagoguery . &quot; I do not believe that people should be criticized for their religious convictions , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; But neither do I believe that people can put_on the mantle of religion and then justify anything they say or do. &quot; The President called Falwell ' s Christian values questionable when he uses his church and his access to television to promote a videotape attacking Clinton ' s honesty and morality . Clinton said that the Falwell tape , which includes lurid allegations about Clinton ' s sex life , his personal finances and assorted skullduggery in Arkansas , is_full of &quot; scurrilous and false charges. &quot; &quot; Remember , &quot; Clinton said , &quot; Jesus threw the money-changers out of the temple . He didn ' t try to take_over the job of the money-changers. &quot; In an interview with Cable News Network later Friday , Falwell dismissed Clinton ' s criticism and invited the President to tape a personal rebuttal to the videotape for use on the &quot; Old Time Gospel Hour , &quot; which airs on 200 stations nationwide . &quot; While the President should really direct his denials and apparent anger at those making the charges , we will be happy to provide him a forum for rebutting those charges , assuming he has watched the video , knows what the charges are and addresses them specifically , &quot; Falwell said . Clinton ' s growing frustration not only with his legislative difficulties but with the unanswered attacks on his character was evident in the 23-minute interview with radio_station KMOX . He was testy from the outset , then unloaded on radio interviewers Charles Brennan and Kevin Horrigan after they asked about the alleged pilfering of towels and bathrobes from the aircraft_carrier George_Washington by White_House staff_members on the President ' s recent trip to Europe to commemorate the D-day anniversary . &quot; Look_at all_the things you could have asked me about and you just asked me about that , &quot; Clinton said , his voice rising in wrath . &quot; Did you know that there were other people on that aircraft_carrier ? Did you know that there were press people on the aircraft_carrier ? Did you know that the carrier had been fully reimbursed out of the private pocket of a White_House staff_member who was so upset about it . . . ? No . No. &quot; White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers went_out of her way to insist that Clinton was not angry . He was shouting only to be heard over the engine noise of Air_Force One , she said . &quot; He wasn ' t angry and didn ' t want to leave the impression that he was , &quot; Myers said after reading wire_service accounts that described the President as inflamed . &quot; It sounded a lot harder than it was. &quot; She said that Clinton did not intend to point fingers at any individuals . &quot; I think the President just spoke his mind , &quot; she added . Clinton ' s assault on Falwell , Limbaugh and other critics elevated to a new plane a battle that Rep . Vic Fazio ( D-West Sacramento ) launched earlier this week with an attack on the Republican_Party and its supporters from the &quot; intolerant . . . religious right. &quot; Fazio warned that radical fringe groups are seizing control of the GOP in more_than a dozen states and are threatening to become a major force in Congress . Fazio ' s comments were denounced by Republican leaders as &quot; religious bigotry &quot; and a &quot; calculated smear campaign. &quot; It was clear Friday that Clinton would join Fazio ' s line of attack as part of the Democratic Party strategy to demonize the right and stanch Democratic losses in the November mid-term elections . The President said he respects the religious convictions of evangelicals but that he would not be silent &quot; when people come_into the political_system and they say that anybody that doesn ' t agree with them is Godless , anyone who doesn ' t agree with them is not a good Christian , anyone who doesn ' t agree with them is fair_game for any wild charge , no matter how false , for any kind of personal , demeaning attack. &quot; The Falwell tape sells for $ 43 , and tens of thousands reportedly have been sold . The people quoted on the tape are several longtime enemies of Clinton who , among other things , suggest that Clinton was involved in several murders in Arkansas . Falwell aide Mark DeMoss has said that he does not know if the charges are true but believes they should be aired so they can be investigated . House Republicans also responded to Clinton ' s comments . &quot; People who go_to work_on Monday and church on Sunday are not public enemies , &quot; said Rep . Dick Armey ( R-Tex. ) , who chairs the House GOP Conference . &quot; Clinton should be putting an end to this McCarthyistic tactic now , rather than fanning the flames and setting_up some religious right bogeyman. &quot; The mainstream media also did not escape Friday ' s presidential ire . Clinton complained that the reporting on his Administration has emphasized its failures unfairly and ignored its accomplishments . He said that news_reporting today is &quot; much more negative . . , much more editorial . . . and much less direct &quot; than ever before . And he said that the American people were subjected_to a &quot; constant unremitting drumbeat of negativism and cynicism &quot; from talk radio -- particularly Limbaugh and his many imitators . Clinton noted that the three-hour Limbaugh show would follow him on the same radio_station and that he would have no opportunity for response or challenge . &quot; And there ' s no truth detector , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; You won ' t get_on afterwards and say what was true and what wasn ' t. &quot; Limbaugh , in his show Friday , answered the President mockingly , &quot; There is no need for a truth detector . I am the truth detector. &quot; Clinton said that he had given_up hope of receiving better treatment from the press , the religious broadcasters and talk radio . &quot; So I decided instead of being frustrated , I needed to be aggressive and I ' m going_to be aggressive from here on in . I ' m going_to tell what I know the truth to be , &quot; Clinton said . So no more Mr. Nice Guy ? &quot; I ' m going_to be very nice about it , &quot; the President said , &quot; but I ' m going_to be aggressive about it. &quot; Times staff writer Jeff Leeds in Washington contributed to this story .</TEXT>
