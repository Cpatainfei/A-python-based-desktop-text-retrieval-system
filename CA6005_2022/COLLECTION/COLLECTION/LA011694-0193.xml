   <HEADLINE> INTIMATE ELITE COLLEGE COMBINES THE ETHEREAL WITH THE DOWN-TO-EARTH ; EDUCATION : DEEP SPRINGS GIVES STUDENTS THE CHANCE TO STUDY NIETZSCHE IN THE MORNING AND PUNCH COWS IN THE AFTERNOON . THE 26-STUDENT , ALL-MALE INSTITUTION IN CALIFORNIA DESERT IS DEBATING WHETHER TO ADMIT WOMEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Smack in the middle of nowhere , just off a shimmering ribbon of desert highway north of Death_Valley , sits one of academia ' s best-kept secrets . Isolation defines Deep Springs College . Isolation , and the unique opportunity to study Nietzsche in the morning and punch cows in the afternoon . Few people have heard of this college and cattle_ranch founded in 1917 by L . L . Nunn , an obscure electric_power magnate . Dedicated to training a select few for lives of leadership and service , the institution has been quietly producing future ambassadors , politicians and college deans for the better part of eight decades . Tuition , room and board are free . But to be admitted to this elite enclave between the Eastern Sierra and the Nevada border , students must be very smart . And they must be male . Every Monday night , the 26 students at Deep Springs gather_in the college ' s ramshackle main building for public speaking , one of two required subjects ( the other is composition ) at the liberal arts institution . On one recent night , the speech topics were race , class or gender . The all-white , all-male , mostly middle- and upper-middle-class student body was representative of none of the subjects . &quot; Put the bleach down , &quot; began Damon Rich , a student from St . Louis . &quot; Who is a person without their skin ? &quot; he asked his audience , which included a lightly snoring dog . &quot; Who is a person without their gender ? &quot; Rich is criticizing political correctness . His college , founded three years before women in this country were allowed to vote , faces growing criticism for barring females . The real topic of discussion at Deep Springs , one that affects its future and its funding , is whether this select clubhouse should accept women . &quot; I think we should go coed , &quot; said Deep Springs President Sherwin Howard , who came here 16 months ago . &quot; I arrived here thinking that , and I still do . But my thinking is more ambiguous now . It ' s not so clear-cut. &quot; Howard is also concerned about this term ' s all-white enrollment . &quot; Last year about a third of our students were minorities , &quot; he said . &quot; We need to work harder on that. &quot; Deep Springs was set_up to be a utopian experiment in self-sufficiency , run_by students who earn the nation ' s top SAT scores . In exchange for their year-round education , students must work_at least 20 hours a week on the 3 # 000-acre ranch , helping to care_for cattle , chickens , pigs , horses and an organic vegetable_garden . The campus consists_of 12 ranch-style buildings . The nearest outpost of civilization is Big Pine , a spit of a town 30 miles to the west . There are two fundamental rules here : No drugs or alcohol and no leaving this desolate , breathtaking valley except during term breaks or with special permission . Enrollment is limited to 26 , and students stay for no longer than three years . They are expected to transfer to prestigious institutions such_as Cornell , Harvard , Yale or the University of California at Berkeley . To keep a permanent state of flux , faculty_members may stay a maximum of six years , and the college president stays no more_than three . Like the professors , presidents usually arrive on sabbatical from other universities . Student committees do all work , including admissions , curriculum and reinvitation ( students must be invited back for a second year ) . Howard , on loan from Utah ' s Weber State University , has begun a nationwide tour of Deep Springs alumni groups . Armed with a recently completed 64-page survey on the advantages and disadvantages of going coed , his mission is to find_out how both scenarios would affect donations . Started by an endowment from its founder that now totals about $ 4.5 million , Deep Springs operated last year on a budget of about $ 500 # 000 . More_than half that amount came from private contributions . Some graduates and previous contributors now refuse to donate to an all-male college , Howard said . Others won ' t give if women are admitted . Howard said he hopes to resolve the issue , once and for all , during his three years here . The college ' s Board of Trustees , which has voted_down coeducation in the past , may vote again this year , Howard said . The school ' s survey of 350 former students , parents and others found that respondents were evenly divided on the issue of coeducation . So are the current student body and staff . Office manager Iris Pope , who has worked_at Deep Springs for 11 years , is vehemently opposed to coeducation . &quot; I ' m a woman , and if it was discriminatory , don ' t you think I ' d say so ? &quot; said Pope , affectionately described by fellow staffers as never having felt an opinion she didn ' t express . &quot; They can ' t do the posturing they ' d do if women were here , &quot; she said . &quot; They end_up being better male communicators . This forces them to talk to each other . They learn to really deal with each other , without sexual pressure . &quot; People don ' t have to come here . If you want the coeducational experience , go_to the other 99 % of colleges that are coed. &quot; Deep Springs is more a state_of_mind than an institution of higher learning . Nunn , who made his fortune by building the country ' s first alternating-current power_plant , intended it that way . &quot; The desert has a deep personality ; it has a voice . Listen to the voice of the desert and you will receive from it enthusiasm and inspiration , &quot; Nunn wrote in 1923 . He also envisioned his college as an oasis from an &quot; evil system &quot; corrupted by all manner of &quot; material device and sensual pleasure. &quot; About 50 people live here , including students , male and female professors and ranch_hands . All proclaim the college ' s introspective isolation . &quot; I feel_like I ' ve become a substantially different person , &quot; said 19-year-old Travis Beck , a second-year student from Denver . &quot; Before I came here I was_on this naive and epic quest to understand all_of life . I was a renaissance dork , &quot; said the serious-minded young_man who began his previous night ' s speech by quoting Nietzsche ' s preface to &quot; The Birth of Tragedy. &quot; &quot; I think I ' ve become much more relaxed. &quot; For fun , students like to shimmy naked down a nearby sand_dune , or sleep outside under a blanket of stars , staring at the highly visible Milky Way . Despite its isolation , life is_full here . Work and schooling are undertaken with equal seriousness . If the dairy boy doesn ' t milk the cows , there is no milk for breakfast . Public_speaking and committee work produce endless hours of discussion and soul-searching . There are rarely more_than six students in a class ; sometimes there are only two . The curriculum changes with each term . The current course list includes anthropology , American pragmatism , ecological physiology and an independent study class in German translations of Nietzsche . Bret Logue , 18 , arrived here in June from Waterford , N.J. , knowing little about horses and less about cows . Logue read about Deep Springs in &quot; one of those college books &quot; and applied . It was the opportunity to be a cowboy of sorts , and to work a ranch , that lured him . &quot; The uniqueness of an experience like this , 26 people , all men , in the middle of nowhere , &quot; he said . &quot; I probably will never experience life on a ranch anywhere else. &quot; Among the college ' s most distinguished graduates are former Democratic U.S. Rep . Jim Olin of Virginia , former University of Rochester President Robert L . Sproull , writer William Vollman and former U.S. Ambassador to Singapore Edwin Cronk . Olin , who retired in January after 10 years in public office , calls his three years at Deep Springs &quot; tremendous &quot; and a major factor_in his choice to become a politician . Now 73 , he entered Deep Springs in 1938 and became student body president . &quot; I got the biggest kick_out of the fact that the students had a lot of authority , &quot; he said . &quot; That leadership experience was a very strong factor_in later life . &quot; I also was very much influenced by the debates that we used to have with each other , the intimate , very deep conversations that we would have with other fellas. &quot; Olin is_active in fund raising for the college , and has slowly begun to think that barring women is no longer a good thing . &quot; It really raises the question of whether we ' re training these students in the right way to become leaders , &quot; he said . &quot; My youngest daughter went_to Dartmouth , and she got elected to an honor society where she lived_in the same house with men . Used the same bathroom . She got_along fine. &quot; Even Logue , who was drawn to Deep Springs because of its all-male student body , now second-guesses himself . &quot; When I came here , I was very strongly in favor of it remaining all male , &quot; he said . &quot; But I don ' t really think it ' s fair for all_the females who could come here and have a great experience. &quot;</TEXT>
