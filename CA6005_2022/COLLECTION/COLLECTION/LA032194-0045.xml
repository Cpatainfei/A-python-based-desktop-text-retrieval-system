   <TEXT> A powerful aftershock to the Northridge earthquake rolled across Southern California on Sunday , igniting two fires , disrupting power to thousands of San Fernando Valley residents and sending people fleeing from malls and movie_theaters , but inflicting little physical damage . The 5.3-magnitude quake , centered near Panorama City , was felt over a wide area of Los Angeles , Ventura and Orange counties when it hit at 1:20 p.m. It was the third strongest of more_than 6 # 000 aftershocks that have struck the region since the Jan . 17 quake that killed at least 61 people and caused at least $ 13 billion in structural damage . It was the seventh aftershock greater than magnitude 5.0 , and it served to keep quake-jittery Angelenos on edge for yet another day . Freeways sustained some &quot; cosmetic cracking , &quot; but no major damage , a state transit official said . For fans camped outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for tonight ' s Oscar ceremonies , the shaker gave them a second authentic L . A . experience -- but did not move them from their cherished places . Rhea Sprecher , an art_teacher from Wisconsin , still managed to spot Debbie Allen , Goldie Hawn and others . &quot; I felt some rumbling under my feet and I said : ' Would that be an earthquake ? ' &quot; Inside , chandeliers swayed , seats rocked and huge pieces of scenery rattled . &quot; Everybody , stay in your seats ! &quot; Oscar director Jeff Margolis ordered over the public_address_system . Los Angeles city Fire_Department officials said two fires were started by the earthquake . A mini-mall blaze in Van Nuys began because of electrical damage caused by the quake , and a transformer at a Department of Water and Power_plant near Burbank Airport caught_fire after earthquake damage caused oil in the unit to overheat . Fire destroyed the Woodley Plaza shopping_center in Van Nuys , burning a mini-market , video store and a restaurant , said Fire_Department spokesman Jim Wells said . But elsewhere , there was little damage . In Malibu , a minor rockslide failed to disrupt traffic . And in Santa Monica , life in the bustling Third Street Promenade shopping and dining_area was back to normal shortly after the temblor stopped . &quot; Seismically , this is a very expected behavior . Probably the big news_story in this earthquake is people ' s nerves , &quot; said Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton . In the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere , hundreds of people were evacuated from malls and theaters as a precaution . About 1 # 000 people were removed from IKEA , a home furnishings store in Burbank . Despite shoppers ' anxiety , the evacuation was quick and orderly , said Dennis Rodriguez , the store ' s operations manager . &quot; People were a little frightened . We got workers together with customers and guided them downstairs , &quot; Rodriguez said . Some children were separated from parents but were reunited outside the building , he said . Another 500 shoppers were evacuated from the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square mall , where the aftershock shattered plate_glass alongside an escalator and sent some overhead spotlights crashing to the floor . No one was injured at the mall , where the first 34 of the complex ' s 140 stores closed since the Jan . 17 quake reopened only Saturday , employees said . &quot; We had the rain yesterday , and another aftershock today , &quot; said Bob Smith , a mall employee . &quot; It ' s been a tough weekend. &quot; The quake also rocked the Glendale Galleria shopping_center . &quot; It shook us pretty hard , &quot; said Drew Boghorsyan of the mall ' s customer services_department . &quot; We heard the building just rumble . It was really scary. &quot; Boghorsyan said 26 of the 248 stores in the mall closed after the quake because merchants wanted to go_home . He said he knew of no damage to the stores that closed . A Sherman Oaks house , moved off its foundation by the Jan . 17 quake and scheduled for demolition today , was sent sliding another 20 feet down the hillside , imperiling other houses below . At Valley movie_theaters , moviegoers fled their seats as they were showered with broken plaster and other debris . &quot; There were some big tiles that fell_down , &quot; said John Corcoran , who was at the Fallbrook Mall theater in Canoga Park . The jolt also shook_up construction workers still repairing damage from the January temblor . James Booth of Burbank was_on a bucket lift filling cracks on the second floor of the Cal State Northridge science building when the shaking hit . &quot; I thought it was this jackass shaking the bottom of the lift , &quot; Booth said , pointing to a co-worker . Then , he added , &quot; I thought the entire building was going_to come down. &quot; At the Northridge Fashion Center , badly damaged in the January quake , 23 employees from a wrecking firm also were startled by the aftershock . &quot; We were in the center of the mall when it hit , &quot; said Al Flores , a supervisor for Cleveland Wrecking Co . &quot; It was a lot of bumping_up and down . We just got all our people together , made_sure everyone was all_right , and got_out of there. &quot; Engineer Chris Brock , of Law / Crandall Inc. , a firm hired to evaluate the damage caused at CSUN by the Northridge quake , said inspectors have found &quot; many new cracks , but nothing major yet. &quot; A Santa Monica conference of the Anxiety_Disorders Assn . of America ended with a bang as the quake struck . &quot; I tell you , the timing couldn ' t have been better . It was the last_day , the last minute , the last second and it hit . It was pretty ironic , &quot; said association President Jerilyn Ross . At Disneyland in Anaheim , some of the more elaborate attractions were temporarily closed_down . At Universal Studios in Universal City , all attractions closed immediately after the quake . Chris Cangco of Glendale was_on a tram going_over a bridge that falls_apart as part of the special_effects tour at Universal when the quake hit . &quot; I didn ' t realize it was an earthquake at the time . I thought it was an effect of the . . . tram. &quot; But the shocks seemed too intense to be part of the attraction , he said , and the driver didn ' t say anything . The ride continued , but the King Kong and earthquake attractions , scheduled to be included in the tour , were closed . Only when the 45-minute ride ended did someone inform the riders that a real earthquake had hit . The aftershock also knocked_out power to about 77 # 000 San Fernando Valley residents , most for five minutes or less , Department of Water and Power spokeswoman Mindy Berman said . However , about 7 # 000 customers in Van Nuys were without electricity for half an hour . In Simi Valley , phone_service in the western portion of the city was off for about 10 minutes . Caltrans reported minor damage to freeways near the epicenter of the aftershock , but none serious enough to close any roads . On the Golden State Freeway north of Granada Hills , the aftershock dislodged temporary asphalt filler that had been used to close a 6-to-8-inch gap caused by the Northridge quake . Temporary asphalt fixes also came loose in a concrete overpass at the interchange of the Simi Valley and San Diego freeways . Caltrans crews quickly refilled the gaps without shutting_down any of the freeways . &quot; It ' s not something that would alarm anyone , &quot; said Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli . &quot; It ' s super-minor. &quot; Caltech seismologists said the aftershock was expected and fell within the normal range . &quot; This is perfectly normal . This is what we expect , &quot; said Egill Hauksson , a seismologist at Caltech . He said Sunday ' s shaking occurred on the east_side of the fault plane where the main shock occurred on Jan . 17 , but was not on the same fault . Seismic authorities said the aftershock was centered about two miles west-northwest of Panorama City , and about three miles northeast of the epicenter of the Northridge quake . It fell within a &quot; pie-shaped aftershock zone &quot; where shocks have been clustered , Hutton said . The aftershock was closer to the surface than the Northridge quake , with preliminary estimates putting it about nine miles underground , compared to 12 miles for the Jan . 17 temblor . With a preliminary magnitude of 5.3 , the quake is 1 / 20 the magnitude of the Jan . 17 quake . Hutton said the average number of aftershocks continues to decline each month . Sunday ' s temblor &quot; is an aftershock , but it is also an earthquake on its own &quot; and will produce its own aftershocks , she said . However , there is only a 1 in 20 chance that it was a precursor of a larger quake , she said . Only two other aftershocks , at magnitudes 5.6 and 5.9 , have been stronger than Sunday ' s , and both occurred the day of the Northridge quake . Sunday ' s aftershock was followed by two lesser ones , a 3.4-magnitude aftershock recorded at 3:34 p.m. , and another reading 2.7 at 8:05 p.m. , seismologists said . Meanwhile , a spokesman for Farmers Insurance Co . said Sunday ' s aftershock could trigger a temporary suspension of underwriting earthquake insurance in the region . &quot; Geologists may call this an aftershock , but this is a separate quake for insurance purposes , &quot; said Jeffrey Beyer , spokesman for Farmers . State law allows insurers to impose a moratorium of up_to 60 days on sales of earthquake insurance when an quake occurs . A moratorium imposed after the Jan . 17 Northridge quake covered about 100 square_miles and lasted no more_than 30 days at many companies . &quot; I don ' t know of any moratoriums still in_effect , &quot; Bill Schulz , spokesman for the California Department of Insurance , said . The aftershock prompted Valley business owners and authorities to close some public structures so they could check for structural damage . In Burbank , owners shut_down the 75-store Media City_Center mall for the day after sprinklers jolted by the aftershock drenched some shoppers . City building inspectors also ordered the mall parking structure closed until it could be inspected , said Lt . Don Brown , of the Burbank Police_Department . A spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District said schools will be open &quot; as usual &quot; today , although workers will inspect repairs from the January quake to make_sure they held . In all , 76 public_schools were damaged in January . Doug Brown , the district ' s facilities director , said , &quot; We will be out at the schools where there was previous damage to make_sure the repairs are still holding. &quot; &quot; We ' re going to hit the ones that had the most damage and the least permanent repair work done and work our way back from there. &quot; The Washington , D.C.-based Anxiety_Disorders Assn . had been discussing such problems as traumatic stress disorders , like those brought_on by the Jan . 17 quake , in its four-day conference at the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel . As the final seminar drew to a close , the fifth-floor banquet room began to shake and the chandeliers rattled noisily . The seminar ended with applause and laughter -- for the quake . On Friday , the 550-person conference had featured a seminar called &quot; The Los Angeles Earthquake and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. &quot; And as their time in the city came_to a close , some of the psychiatrists and social_workers joked about earthquakes . &quot; Jokingly , we who ' d never experienced an earthquake said , ' Gee , I wish I could feel just a little one so I could know what it feels_like , ' &quot; Ross said . * FEW REPEATS : Sunday ' s temblor caused few problems at Valley sites hit hard by the Jan . 17 quake .
