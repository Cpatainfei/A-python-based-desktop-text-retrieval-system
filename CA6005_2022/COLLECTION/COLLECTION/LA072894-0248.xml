   <HEADLINE> SERBS BLAMED IN DEADLY ATTACK ON U.N. CONVOY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In provocative acts that may signal a closing in_for the kill in Bosnia-Herzegovina , Serbian rebels Wednesday cinched off Sarajevo ' s last tenuous lifeline to the outside world and were implicated in a deadly attack on U.N. peacekeepers traveling in clearly marked vehicles . A British soldier was killed and another wounded in the assault on the unarmed U.N. convoy -- an attack that seemed intended to dare the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization to deliver on longstanding threats to launch air strikes . NATO planes conducted routine low-level flights over the area after the incident , but U.N. commanders appeared reluctant to call a Western air_attack at what has become a volatile juncture in the 27-month-old Bosnian conflict , saying the assault was only &quot; presumed &quot; to have been perpetrated by Serbian forces . &quot; The fog of battle is still around us , &quot; U.N. Protection Force spokesman Paul Risley said of the apparent confusion following the ambush outside Sarajevo . &quot; But the convoy did report a Bosnian Serb position very close by , and we are making the presumption that was who fired on them , since it was small-arms fire. &quot; The spray of machine-gun fire also exploded at least one fuel tanker that the troops were escorting , Risley said from U.N. mission headquarters in Zagreb , Croatia . Another U.N. spokesman said French peacekeepers who arrived to recover the stranded British vehicles came under_fire and had to abandon their efforts for the night . By compelling U.N. officials to close the only open road into the capital , Serbian rebel leaders flaunted their knack for getting outsiders to do their dirty work . Forces_backing Bosnian Serb warlord Radovan Karadzic do not control any of the rutted dirt_track across Mt . Igman into Sarajevo that has been used to truck food , gasoline and other necessities to the city since March . But by raising the threat of renewed attacks on civilians and aid workers plying the front-line route , Karadzic effectively blackmailed U.N. commanders into sealing_off the road for him . &quot; As of this morning , because we no longer have the guarantee of safety and security , ( U.N. Protection Force ) troops are forced to prevent use of the Butmir road across the airport to commercial and civilian traffic until further notice , &quot; Risley said . &quot; This is a tremendous step backward in the process toward peace. &quot; The Serbs ' move to resume a stranglehold on the Bosnian capital was the latest in a series of belligerent actions punctuating their rejection last week of a peace plan drafted by mediators from the United States , Russia , Britain , France and Germany . The peace plan , reluctantly endorsed by the Sarajevo government , would divide Bosnia in roughly equal shares between rebel forces and the larger Muslim-Croat population that remains committed to a multiethnic republic . The Serbs currently hold more_than 70 % of the country and are loath to retreat from any of the territory they have seized . Foreign ministers of the five nations that drafted the proposal plan to meet in Geneva on Saturday to ponder a response to the rebels ' rejection . Little in the way of decisive action is expected , as Russia opposes military measures to punish the Serbs for their intransigence and the four NATO-member countries disagree over the risks and merits of lifting an arms embargo that has tied the hands of Bosnian government defenders . But the stakes at the Geneva meeting have been substantially raised by recent Serbian actions . A U.N. airlift of humanitarian aid for Sarajevo was suspended indefinitely last week after gunmen fired on five relief aircraft in or near Serb-held territory , and Serbs have repeatedly attacked civilians in the U.N. &quot; safe area &quot; of Gorazde this week . By forcing U.N. commanders to reimpose the total blockade Serbian forces themselves maintained until March , Karadzic has presented the five mediating powers with the unsavory choice of military intervention or capitulation to the rebel premise that even NATO is powerless to stop them . NATO was instrumental in breaking the artillery siege of Sarajevo in February , when it threatened to bomb any tanks , guns or other heavy weaponry left within a 12-mile radius of the capital . Backed by Russia ' s warnings that it would not act to prevent air strikes if the Serbs remained defiant , Karadzic ordered most of his artillery out of firing_range of the city . But dozens of artillery pieces have gradually been repositioned around Sarajevo , with U.N. monitors putting_up no resistance and senior officials of the peacekeeping force dissuading NATO from making_good on its threat of air strikes . U.N. and NATO reluctance to punish the Serbs for blatant acts of aggression appears to have emboldened the rebels to press their campaign of terror aimed at driving other ethnic_groups and U.N. forces from territory they want annexed to a Greater Serbia . &quot; As usual before a big meeting , the Bosnian Serbs want to show the international community how difficult and complex and unpredictable Bosnia is in_order to deter any resolute action , &quot; said Peter Kessler , spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees in Zagreb . The agency ' s food warehouses in Sarajevo are down to less than a 10-day supply of flour rations for the 380 # 000 trapped and war-weary residents , he said . Karadzic characterized the road closure as temporary , indicating it could be reopened if U.N. intermediaries force the Bosnian government to release nearly 200 Serbian prisoners_of_war and agree to cease armed resistance . He also said the supply_route was being closed because it had been used to smuggle weapons to government troops in the capital . Risley said U.N. peacekeepers encountered no evidence to back the smuggling claim during routine inspection of cargo transported over the route since March . The road closure &quot; has to be seen in the context of a number of very serious actions the Serbs have taken_in the last few days across Bosnia that have us very concerned , &quot; Risley said , referring to the attacks in Gorazde and the targeting of aid flights . U.N. officials also report increased Serbian shelling around the key northern town of Brcko and cross-border rebel attacks near the Croatian resort of Dubrovnik , which had largely been at_peace since the 1991 rebellion by Serbs in Croatia . Western diplomats and humanitarian relief officials say U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali may have encouraged the recent wave of Serbian belligerence on Monday , when he recommended a pullout of the nearly 40 # 000-strong U.N. Protection Force no matter what the outcome of the foundering peace process . Boutros-Ghali suggested that NATO troops would be_better suited to handling the increasingly dangerous work of escorting relief convoys and patrolling so-called safe havens .</TEXT>
