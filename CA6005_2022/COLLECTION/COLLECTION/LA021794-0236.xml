   <TEXT> The Winter_Olympics are supposed to be fun but , of course , things don ' t always work_out exactly as planned . Lots can happen to take some of the fun out of Olympic sports . In mogul skiing , though , they work hard to keep the fun alive . And that doesn ' t mean just the spectators , although they certainly do their part . It starts with the athletes and organizers . And that ' s not surprising , considering the roots of the sport . Anyone who has ever skied down a mountainside has encountered moguls . They are snow bumps carved into the steeper slopes by skiers turning frequently to keep their speed in check . A mogul slope looks_like a hillside with goosebumps . Moguls are not easy to ski , but skiers who have mastered the technique usually seek them out . Good mogul skiers ski them fast , bouncing from bump to bump , and also seek_out the natural jumps that occur on most mogul hills . And good jumpers like to add another element , aerial tricks . Those who can do_it say it ' s fun . And usually on a ski slope , if someone is hotdogging down a mogul hill , there are other skiers watching . The mogul skier is having fun doing_it , and the watching skiers are having fun watching . So , of this , they made a competitive sport . And the only real difference is that the moguls are not naturally carved . The fun remains . The other day at the mogul hill , a recording of a space-shot countdown led into the start of the competition , during which each run was signaled by a rooster crow . Rock , country or country-rock music blared while the skiers , lower legs looking_like zigzag sewing machine needles , were bouncing down the slope and off the jumps . The fans bopped to the music , and during lulls , sometimes made their own . A kazoo contingent made itself known . Describing the sport , American skier Ann Battelle said : &quot; Take the_hill out behind your house , that steep one , then add some Volkswagen Bugs . Cover the Bugs with snow , strap some skis on your feet and try to get_down as fast as you can . Then , to complicate things , put a couple more Bugs on top of the other Bugs and point your skis off them. &quot; Sound like fun ? Well , it is . Just to make_sure that nobody had too good a time , though , there were people at the gate collecting bottles of liquor from the spectators and issuing claim checks , to be redeemed on the way_out . Everyone had a good time , anyway . MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
