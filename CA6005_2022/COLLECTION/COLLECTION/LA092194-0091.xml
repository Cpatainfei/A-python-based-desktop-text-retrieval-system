   <HEADLINE> KINGS SIMPLY WANT TO FORGET ; HOCKEY : THE CLUB HOPES THINGS WORK_OUT FOR MCNALL , BUT FOCUS IS_ON GETTING READY FOR SEASON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The post-McNall era is under way for the Kings , and not a moment too soon for a hockey franchise trying to conduct business as usual while its most visible figure not named Wayne is_on such thin ice that a fleet of Zambonis couldn ' t help . What was Bruce McNall doing at that Kings ' exhibition in San Diego ? &quot; Signing autographs constantly , &quot; said Joe Cohen , the new chairman of the Kings . McNall continues to cast a large shadow over the team he owned until financial difficulties forced him to sell 72 % of the operation last May . When the Kings play the New York Rangers tonight at the Forum in the first of their three home exhibitions , McNall will be there , probably signing autographs as usual . Meanwhile , the Kings move_on , especially in the front office . Since May 16 , when Cohen and business partner Jeffrey Sudikoff bought the majority interest in the Kings , 15 front-office employees have left . Ten were fired right away , among them General_Manager Nick Beverley , and five more have left since . In the marketing department , the nine-person staff lost four . Nick Salata , the publications director , said he has been too busy to be worried . &quot; Our staff is so small , we all thought , ' Well , OK , let ' s get going , ' &quot; he said . &quot; I haven ' t really had time_to_come in here and be down about anything. &quot; Cohen said the Kings have made no plans involving staff reductions in the event of an owners ' lockout , a possibility as the NHL and the players ' union continue negotiating . Said Salata : &quot; As a working stiff , I ' m at the mercy of many elements . I go full bore until somebody tells me to stop. &quot; No one is telling anyone to stop anything right now . In fact , the new King bosses are aggressively operating the franchise , pushing season_tickets . The Kings sold 11 # 959 season_tickets last season , coming_off their unexpected drive into the Stanley Cup_finals . And despite last season ' s disappointment -- they failed to make the playoffs -- the Kings still had sold 10 # 954 season_tickets by Tuesday morning . Except for a_few high-priced seats , about 5 % of the Forum , the Kings did not increase season-ticket prices . The average price is $ 37 . The Kings also offered a payment plan for season_tickets for the first time and initiated a 12-game mini-season ticket plan beginning at the start of the season . Previously , the mini-plan wasn ' t offered until January . There is hope that the attention the Kings get will soon shift to the ice and away from McNall ' s legal and financial problems . Don Burkholder of Hawthorne , a season-ticket holder for 20 years , said when he thinks_about the Kings , he doesn ' t think_about McNall . &quot; I personally don ' t even care , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m more concerned about them starting Kelly Hrudey in the net more_than anything now. &quot; Season-ticket holder Jack Kates of Cypress is a member of the Forum ' s Section 12 club , which has its own newsletter . Kates is known in those parts by his nickname , &quot; Pull the Goalie. &quot; Kates , who runs an automotive advertising_agency , said McNall should be held_up to scrutiny . &quot; If someone ( cheats ) me for something-million dollars , I don ' t like it too_much , &quot; Kates said . &quot; I do not like dishonesty . &quot; But Bruce McNall does not affect the way I feel about the Kings . The only thing that irritates me is the trade with Pittsburgh that gave_away ( Luc ) Robitaille , the greatest left_wing in the history of the game. &quot; The Kings are banking on that kind of reaction in the face of McNall ' s continuing problems , believing that hockey will be the topic of concern and that the Kings will be allowed to move forward . Cohen said the Kings continue to stand behind McNall . &quot; The Kings are stable , &quot; he said . &quot; We are happy to have Bruce ' s help . We care about him and we hope that everything will work_out well for him. &quot; McNall , who bought the Kings from Laker owner Jerry Buss in 1988 , faces criminal charges stemming from a federal grand_jury investigation into his financial dealings . McNall sold 72 % of the Kings largely to pay_off $ 90 million in loans and credit from Bank of America . Besides the 28 % share of the team he retained , McNall also kept 100 % ownership of four Slap Shops , which sell King merchandise . Cohen said it is up_to the Kings to make_sure the focus is_on them , not their former owner . &quot; When the Kings win , that ' s the story , &quot; he said . &quot; When the Kings don ' t win , there are all sorts of stories. &quot; One story Cohen would like to see written is about an agreement to build a new hockey arena . It hasn ' t happened yet , although he said the Kings have investigated potential sites downtown , near the Forum , in El Segundo , Hawthorne and Torrance . Cohen , Sudikoff and Lester Wintz , the new executive_vice_president , make_up the Kings ' stadium task_force . Cohen emphasized that he has a genial working relationship with Buss , who owns the Forum and holds the Kings ' lease until July of 2018 . To illustrate the goodwill , Cohen said Buss had made &quot; lease adjustments. &quot; The Kings pay Buss about $ 10 million a year under terms of the lease , which calls_for 12 % of the gross_revenue . Reports in March said that Buss had offered to reduce the rent by $ 2 million per year . In the meantime , the Kings are tying the laces of their skates for the first time this season . There will be hockey on the ice . Unless there ' s a lockout , of course .</TEXT>
