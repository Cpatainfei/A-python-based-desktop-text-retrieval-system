   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEW ; WE COULD USE MORE ' HYSTERIA ' LIKE THIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The fair sex . The weaker sex . The pregnant sex . Tracy Young believes women continue to be slaves to their bodies -- or to society ' s notions about their bodies . It ' s time for an Emancipation Proclamation . But her &quot; Hysteria , &quot; at the Actors ' Gang Theatre , is no solemn decree . It ' s a zingy musical_comedy -- and some of the best evidence yet to refute the old canard that feminists are humorless . Staged satire is seldom this provocative , this meaty , this engaging . In 1992 , an earlier version of &quot; Hysteria &quot; was mounted in the Gang ' s former home at 2nd Stage , a_few blocks away . As with many of the Gang ' s sprawling productions , that stage was too small . &quot; Hysteria &quot; looks and sounds better now . Young manages to sustain and unite two different narratives , set more_than a_hundred years apart in two different countries . Her contemporary American story is built around Garnet Poindexter ( Kate Mulligan ) , newly pregnant and not yet glowing . Her husband neglects her , and the family to which she has returned is , well , eccentric . Mom ( Patti Tippo ) is an ex-supermodel who isn ' t adjusting well to middle_age , Dad ( Daniel Parker ) is touting his latest line of unisex clothing by wearing women ' s garb . Then there are Garnet ' s sisters . Corky ( Tricia Parks ) has imagined she ' s pregnant ever since a traumatic incident at college and has been a recluse for months now , awaiting her first contractions . Taylor ( Evie Peck ) wants to follow her mother into the modeling trade , even if it takes a_few visits to Dr. Sandra Needles ( Laurel Ollstein ) , mom ' s plastic_surgeon . She ' s encouraged in her delusion by her father ' s lecherous friend Chadley ( Kyle Gass ) , the cosmetics king . One day , while examining old photos , Garnet suddenly finds herself in the presence of her great-great-grandmother Lilymoist Teagarden ( Cari Dean Whittemore ) , a fluttery Victorian miss who , in 1888 , has been diagnosed with female &quot; hysteria &quot; and confined indoors by her bullying doctor ( Parker ) . Lily gets a second opinion from Lydia Tripplehorn ( Molly Bryant ) , a speechifying crusader for women ' s rights and a champion of the condom and the clitoris . With most of the cast playing roles in both centuries , Young cleverly brings her stories together , eventually focusing_on Lily ' s unwanted pregnancy as much as Garnet ' s . For this latest version , Young brings Lily ' s lover Heathcliff ( V . J . Foster ) out on stage for a funny , swoony seduction . Young also changed the beginning -- sacrificing some childhood memories for a more coherent introduction to the family -- and the ending , which now includes a note of reconciliation between two arch-enemies . She ' s out_to make_a_point , but she doesn ' t pretend that abortion is a painless choice or that the other side has no principles . Adult audiences ( there are bare breasts and frank talk ) should welcome this savvy cartoon with open arms -- and minds . * &quot; Hysteria , &quot; Actors ' Gang , 6209 Santa Monica Blvd. , Thursdays-Sundays , 8 p.m. Ends June 18 . $ 12- $ 15 . ( 213 ) 466-1767 . Running time : 2 hours , 45 minutes .</TEXT>
