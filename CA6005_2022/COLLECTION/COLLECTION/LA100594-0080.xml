   <TEXT> The trade mission from Orange County met with the Vietnamese vice_president here Tuesday , and the delegation ' s leader urged the communist government to consider policy reform allowing overseas Vietnamese to claim or buy back properties lost when they fled the war-torn country years ago . Co Pham , president of the Westminster-based Vietnamese Chamber_of_Commerce , made the proposal during a 90-minute meeting between the delegates and Vietnamese Vice_President Nguyen Thi Binh in the plush , high-ceiling presidential palace here . &quot; The Vietnamese overseas would like favorable laws so we can . . . claim our properties and belongings &quot; abandoned when 2 million Vietnamese fled their native_land after the United States pulled_out of the Vietnam_War in 1975 , Pham said . Binh , who was the highest ranking official the 24 delegates will meet , said only that she would &quot; convey the message &quot; to Vietnamese lawmakers . The issue of lost properties is important to Vietnamese residents in Orange County , many of whom denounced this first trade mission , which is largely sponsored by Vietnamese overseas . Local opponents say renewed trade between the United States and Vietnam could stimulate this nation ' s poor economy and thus keep alive a communist government that has a questionable human_rights record . Some in the Vietnamese American community have lobbied the U.S._government to solve the issue of lost properties before restoring diplomatic ties with Hanoi . Pham said Tuesday that he brought_up the sensitive political topic even though he did not expect government officials here to accept the request . * &quot; This issue is too important to the Vietnamese expatriates not to bring_up , &quot; Pham said . While most of the Vietnamese Americans on the trip agree that the issue of lost properties is important , they do not believe that Vietnamese Americans ever will be allowed to reclaim the properties they left . &quot; If you abandon a house . . . forget it , &quot; said Hieu Phan , an architect from Westminster . Pham also asked Binh to pay_attention to freedom and democracy for the citizens of Vietnam . &quot; We have learned . . . that if people can develop economically in a free way , the country will be better , &quot; he said . The vice_president requested that her American guests support Vietnam ' s quest_for diplomatic recognition and most-favored nation trading status from Washington . Several of the delegates told her they will contact their U.S. elected officials on Vietnam ' s behalf . &quot; I assure you I will urge my congressmen to speed_up the normalization process and to give Vietnam MFN status , &quot; said Dunson Cheng , chairman of Cathay Bank , a Los Angeles firm with a branch in the center of Little Saigon in Westminster . Though President Clinton lifted the trade_embargo in February , it is difficult to protect U.S. interests in Vietnam without formal normalization between Hanoi and Washington , a problem businesses face when entering the Vietnamese market . The trade delegation on Tuesday also met with a U.S. State_Department official for a briefing on the current political and economic situation in Vietnam , as well as the unresolved issue of unaccounted-for U.S. servicemen . That meeting was closed to reporters . On Thursday , the trade mission moves to Ho Chi Minh City , formerly Saigon , for another round of meetings with Vietnamese politicians and business professionals . Delegates return to the United States on Monday . The delegation had hoped to meet with Vietnam ' s President Le Duc Anh during their weeklong stay , but it is not possible , said Hoang Cong Thuy of the Viet Nam-USA Society , which is coordinating the Americans ' visit . &quot; The president has too tight of a schedule , &quot; Thuy said . &quot; He is meeting with the Chinese delegation. &quot;</TEXT>
