   <HEADLINE> CANADA ENDS MORATORIUM WITH $ 1 MILLION IN AID TO CUBA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ending a 16-year moratorium on aid to Cuba , Canadian officials said Monday the Caribbean nation would receive about $ 1 million in government-supported development funds and direct humanitarian assistance this year . &quot; The Cold_War is long over . The people of Cuba are suffering from food shortages brought_on by economic_crisis and Canadians want to help them , &quot; Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet told reporters in Ottawa , while Christine Stewart , Canada ' s secretary_of_state for Latin_America and Africa , announced details of the program at an economic conference in Havana . Stewart said private groups receiving Canadian government grants would be permitted to fund development programs in Cuba through agencies outside the Cuban government . She said this would bring_about $ 730 # 000 in Canadian development assistance to Cuba . Stewart also said Canada would donate about $ 365 # 000 to the World Food Program for humanitarian aid to Cuba . Canada suspended direct aid to Fidel Castro ' s government in 1978 because of Cuban military involvement in the Angolan civil_war . Canada has made only occasional exceptions for disaster relief . But Canada , like Mexico , has maintained diplomatic relations and trade with Cuba throughout the U.S.-led embargo of Cuba . Canadian trade with Cuba totaled nearly $ 225 million last year , mainly importing sugar and nickel and exporting agricultural products . Canada also is the single largest source of visitors every year to Cuba , heavily promoted as a winter destination for Canadian tourists . The U.S. State_Department reacted mildly to the announcement . &quot; We have a slight difference_of_opinion ( with Canada ) on tactics , but we don ' t have any difference on the ultimate goal , &quot; a U.S. official said . Both Canada and the United States , the official said , favor peaceful democratic reform in Cuba . In her speech Monday , Stewart described Canadian-Cuban relations as &quot; active and positive &quot; but called_on the Castro government to improve civil and political rights . She said Canada is prepared to expand government exchanges with Cuba and will continue to promote business investment in the island nation . Stewart added that Canada &quot; intends to examine , with other countries , what would be required for Cuba to re-establish its full membership &quot; in the Organization of American_States . Sam Lanfranco , an associate_professor of economics at the Center for Latin_American and Caribbean Studies at York University in Toronto , said several factors played a role in Canada ' s change in policy toward Cuba : the deteriorating economic situation in Cuba ; the change in Canadian governments from the Progressive Conservative_Party to the Liberals , and a growing recognition by Canada of the need to strengthen its trade and influence in the Western_Hemisphere . The Canadian shift comes as Mexico is encouraging more investment in Cuba . In a visit to Cuba earlier this month , Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced a $ 1.5-billion investment by the Monterrey-based Domos Group in the aging Cuban telephone_system . The Mexican company agreed to pay $ 740 million for an unspecified interest in the government-owned phone_company and to invest an equal amount over the next seven years to improve Cuban phone_service . Times staff writer Juanita Darling in Mexico_City contributed to this report .</TEXT>
