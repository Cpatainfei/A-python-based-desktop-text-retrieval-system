   <HEADLINE> CHARGING THE NYET ; PLAYERS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT CARS THAN PATRIOTISM AS RUSSIA GOES AFTER ITS FIRST DAVIS CUP CHAMPIONSHIP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia is preparing_for its first_appearance in the final round of the Davis Cup in difficult times . The nation is stumbling in its efforts to make_sense of new-found freedom . The economy is in a hyper-inflation spiral . Zhirinovsky nationalism is_on the rise . Amid the snowdrifts and freezing temperatures , people are looking_for something to lift their spirits . Ordinarily , a first showing in the battle for the Davis Cup would provide let ' s-come-together impetus . But the Russian team , which will play Sweden Friday through Sunday on the fast , pale blue carpet at Moscow ' s Olympisky Stadium , is a team in name only . Confusion , dissension , suspicion and mistrust abound . &quot; All ' s not happy in the dovecote , &quot; Gene Scott , a U.S. Davis Cup player in the 1960s , said during the Kremlin Cup in early November . &quot; There seems to be a number of things distracting the team as it gets ready for the final. &quot; Scott , tournament director of the Kremlin Cup , watched the Russian national team -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov , Alexander Volkov , Andrei Olhovskiy and Andrei Cherkasov are also the Davis Cup team -- compete in the season-ending ATP Tour event at Olympisky . Scott is also a member of the USTA Davis Cup Committee and was in Goteborg when the United States was upset by Sweden in this year ' s semifinals . Russia defeated Germany in the other semifinal . &quot; The Davis Cup means everything , &quot; said Vadim Borisov , Russian Davis Cup captain , as he watched his players at the Kremlin Cup . &quot; Maybe it ' s wrong to make_it so important . Maybe there should not be such emphasis . But for us it ' s historic . We have reached the first final for either the USSR or Russia . It ' s a step , a chance to show what Russia can do . When the younger generation looks_at our players and sees what has happened , they have hope. &quot; Russia ' s astounding 4-1 victory in Germany , largely the result of Kafelnikov ' s play , should have left Kafelnikov , the talented 20-year-old , on a career high . It didn ' t . Before naming his team Nov . 22 , Borisov had done little to dispel rumors that the 11th-ranked player in the world would not be involved in the match against Sweden . &quot; Speaking about the Davis Cup , I ' ve heard rumors I ' m not going_to play , &quot; Kafelnikov said during the Kremlin Cup . &quot; I ' m revealing a secret here , I do not have a real good relationship with the team captain. &quot; Friction between Davis Cup players and captains is nothing new , but this situation has two additional twists . Borisov has also gone a_few rounds with the team ' s No . 2 player , Volkov , ranked 25th in the world . He is also the personal coach of Cherkasov ( who is_on the team but doesn ' t play ) . Many say that Davis Cup veteran Andrei Chesnokov , ranked No . 32 , was more deserving of that fourth spot on the team than Cherkasov , No . 184 . &quot; People are always saying something , &quot; Borisov said . &quot; Last year it was about Volkov , then ( Volkov ) and I got_to be friends . I do not know what I would have done_in Germany without his help . Yevgeny is very good and has been a big part of our success , but it is my team , my responsibility. &quot; As a player , Borisov was fiery , passionate . He used emotion to lift his performance level . He said , &quot; It was a dream to become captain after I finished my career , &quot; and is passionately crafting a team . &quot; As captain you must be ready for everything , &quot; he said . &quot; You decide everything . You have it in your hands . It ' s your team , your life . For all_the captains it is like this . &quot; No one expected the U.S. to lose to Sweden . ( Tom ) Gullikson made the decision to play Sampras . It was his team . He did not know Sampras would injure his leg . Being Davis Cup captain is a very difficult position . If the team wins it ' s because the players did a good job . If the team loses_it ' s because of the captain . For the captain it ' s a very dangerous job. &quot; Relations between Kafelnikov and Volkov are as edgy as their status is with the captain . Matters were further confounded when Volkov , who at the start of the tournament said , &quot; I always play with difficulty in Moscow , &quot; defeated Chuck Adams of Pacific Palisades , 6-2 , 6-4 , to win the $ 156 # 000 first prize at the Kremlin Cup . Kafelnikov lost to Marc Rosset , the defending champion , in three sets_in the quarterfinals . &quot; When I made_it to the national team , some people didn ' t feel I fit_in , &quot; Kafelnikov said . &quot; When I became No . 1 , it was the same . For the last six months , I think my rating has gone_up in Volkov ' s eyes . It seems like he is beginning to respect me. &quot; Whether it ' s his erratic point-by-point or match-by-match approach to playing or the honesty with which he expresses his thoughts , Volkov is rarely far from controversy . During the Kremlin Cup , after being asked by Russian journalists if he would be playing for home and country , Volkov said , &quot; I ' m playing for money. &quot; The comment primed the pump for questions about the BMWs that had been promised the Davis Cup team after the victory in Germany . At the closing dinner , an official with the Russian delegation made_it known that BMWs would be awaiting the victors in Moscow when they played the Kremlin Cup . &quot; It ' s a little premature to make conclusions , &quot; said Volkov , who like his teammates was without a new automobile at the conclusion of the tournament . &quot; I just want to wait and see what happens. &quot; This is what Moscow , in_general , and the nation , as_a_whole , are doing with_regard_to the Davis Cup . Having had the media cover the personality conflicts , the team makeup and the bonus structure ( either money or cars ) with great interest , the public is waiting . Throughout this year ' s Davis Cup campaign , Borisov has made_a_point about tennis lacking financial_support from the state . There is no money for travel . The only reason Borisov sees national team members play ATP Tour events is because Cherkasov and Olhovskiy cover his expenses . The National Fund of Sports now finances all sports teams in the country , soliciting businesses from outside Russia by offering special incentives . The fund ' s involvement helped increase the prize_money in the Kremlin Cup from $ 350 # 000 in 1993 to $ 1 # 125 , 000 this year . Putting the issues of players and financing aside , Borisov ' s goal is to leave a mark . The only way to do_it is by winning . &quot; The most important thing is to create something , &quot; Borisov said . &quot; Results tell you what you have created . Results mean history. &quot; Can the Russians win the Davis Cup for the first time in the event ' s 94-year history ? &quot; I see our chances at 50-50 , &quot; Borisov said . &quot; ( Magnus ) Larsson played a fantastic match against ( Todd ) Martin . He is always dangerous . While some say he is in decline , ( Stefan ) Edberg can still make surprises . Edberg is still Edberg. &quot; Edberg is ranked No . 17 in the world , Larsson No . 19 . To win , Kafelnikov will have to put aside the slights and overlook the pressure of playing in Moscow . &quot; It gives me added responsibility playing in front of so many people , &quot; he said . He will play two singles matches and , more likely than not , doubles with Olhovskiy against Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman . Volkov will play the other two singles matches . The Russians will play before expected capacity crowds of about 13 # 000 . &quot; The crowd will not be a factor , &quot; said Olhovskiy , who said he thinks the match will hinge_on the doubles . &quot; We are professionals . If you put all your emotion in one contest and lose , you are zero . A professional cannot do that. &quot; For Russia , it ' s not a matter of people , feelings or bonuses . It ' s a first-time appearance in the final . &quot; It will be the first , last and only time Russia can win the Davis Cup , &quot; Gene Scott said . &quot; The circumstance that led to this year ' s final will not be repeated . &quot; On paper , Russia is not favored . Edberg should win two singles and Apell-Bjorkman should take the doubles . Having said that , Russia will win 3-2. &quot;</TEXT>
