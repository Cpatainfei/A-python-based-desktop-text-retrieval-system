   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL STEPS UP PROBE OF JEWISH EXTREMISTS IN W . BANK ; MIDEAST : POLICE SUSPECT SEVERAL OF PLANNING TERRORIST KILLINGS OF PALESTINIANS . CRACKDOWN ORDERED BY RABIN BRINGS CHARGES OF HARASSMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli police Monday widened their investigation of extremist Jewish settlers suspected of planning terrorist killings of Palestinians in the occupied West_Bank to foment widespread violence in the region and thus undercut peace efforts . Three more men were detained -- two in pre-dawn raids on their homes and the third , an army_officer , at a military base . This brought_to at least 11 , including two army_officers , to be arrested on security charges in the past two weeks , and senior Israeli officials said more arrests are likely . Although police have refused to outline the alleged conspiracy or to specify charges against the suspects , Police Minister Moshe Shahal said over the weekend that the group was planning a major attack soon on Palestinians in the Jerusalem area as part of a terrorist campaign . &quot; We stopped them just on the brink of action , &quot; Shahal said . While most of the men are suspected of getting weapons and planning a series of terrorist attacks , some are also being questioned about the murders of three Palestinians in December and of a Jerusalem taxi driver three months ago , security officials said . &quot; We are not talking_about a group of stone-throwers , Palestinians or Jews , &quot; a senior security official told Haaretz , the country ' s leading newspaper . &quot; We are talking_about a group of people who are suspected of planning to kill innocent Arab residents . . . . The detainees are suspected of activity stemming from ideological motives. &quot; The group has been dubbed the Jewish Underground of Revenge , an informal title that recalls an earlier movement broken_up in 1984 with the arrest of 27 people , most of them settlers , on charges of attacking Arabs . Most of those detained in the past two weeks are Jewish settlers from Kiryat Arba , an ultranationalist settlement near the West_Bank city of Hebron , where Baruch Goldstein , an American-born settler , massacred about 30 Palestinians in a mosque in February . Beaten to death by surviving Palestinians , Goldstein is now regarded by many in Kiryat Arba as a martyr . Monday ' s crackdown , ordered by Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin with Cabinet approval , has brought charges of police harassment from right-wing groups and allegations of torture from the suspects ' lawyers , and it is turning_into a civil_rights rather than a security matter . Army Lt . Oren Edri , 23 , arrested Sept . 2 on suspicion of obtaining arms for the radicals , told his attorney that he was beaten during his interrogation and was kept for three days in &quot; a coffin-like cell &quot; where rats bit him constantly . &quot; He is still being tortured , &quot; said Edri ' s father , Yitzhak , after meeting his son for 10 minutes in his prison_cell . &quot; They ' re keeping toothpaste from him , they won ' t let him pray , they ' re keeping toilet_paper from him , they won ' t let him call home. &quot; Families of several other men complained that they were not notified of the arrests for two days , and attorneys for virtually all_the suspects objected to military orders barring them under Israel ' s tough security laws from meeting with their clients while they were being questioned . Preliminary hearings in the cases have been heard behind closed doors , often without the presence of attorneys for the men . &quot; The recent arrests are a shame to the state of Israel , &quot; said Uri Ariel , the head of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judea , Samaria and Gaza . Israel ' s emergency laws and the military orders in_force in the West_Bank permit the security police and army intelligence to make arrests without warrants , to hold detainees incommunicado for up_to three weeks and to use &quot; moderate physical pressure &quot; in_questioning them . In the past , these powers have been used largely against Palestinians , and few Israelis have questioned the harsh practices , even torture , instead accepting government arguments that such measures were necessary to counter terrorist attacks . But the Israeli public is growing angry at reports that the same tactics are being used against Israelis . Follow Me , a right-wing group of reserve army_officers , protested Edri ' s detention in a cell measuring 3 feet by 4 and his interrogation , allegedly with a burlap sack over his head . &quot; It is inconceivable that an Israeli army_officer should receive the same treatment as Palestinian murderers , &quot; the group said . Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Meshulam Amit , a former commander of Israel ' s border police , which is used primarily to quell Palestinian violence and enforce the occupation , said at a weekend demonstration that the General Security Service , known as Shin Bet , has to treat Jewish prisoners more gently than it does Arabs . Despite denials from Shin Bet and police that Edri or the other detainees were tortured , state prosecutor Dorit Beinish ordered an investigation . Saadia Kahalani , whose two sons are suspected of planning to attack Arabs , said : &quot; Even if they had murdered an Arab , that would n ' t justify all_of this treatment . . . . They ' re simply using terrorism against us. &quot;</TEXT>
