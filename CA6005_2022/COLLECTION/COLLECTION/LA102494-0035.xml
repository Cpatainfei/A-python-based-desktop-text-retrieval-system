   <HEADLINE> DON ' T BE DISTRACTED BY ALIEN COWS ; BIODIVERSITY : THE U.S. HAS EVERYTHING TO GAIN IN RATIFYING THE GLOBAL TREATY FOR PRESERVING SPECIES AND ECOSYSTEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. Senate will soon have a vital test before it -- if , that is , it can muster the time and determination to deal with the most critical matters that face it in the upcoming lame-duck session . This test lacks the media drama of health reform or crime , but passing it or failing it will nevertheless have sweeping global significance . The upcoming vote on whether to ratify the International Convention on Biological Diversity , a treaty that emerged from the Rio environment summit two years ago , will establish for the rest of the world whether the United States really cares about the conservation of species and ecosystems . We originally declined to sign ; now we have done so , and the Senate must supply the required ratification vote . There is no time to lose . The first conference of parties to the treaty is scheduled for November , and if we fail to ratify , we will not be at the table . What does the convention actually accomplish ? Its most significant sections commit signatory nations to monitor organisms and their habitats and to develop protection plans for those in danger . A prospect that appeared potentially troublesome in the early going was the likely development , under the treaty , of a rigid and confining biological safety protocol -- a regulatory regime for controlling the transfer of plants and animals and field-testing new varieties . There is indeed a worry here . Biosafety regulations that differentiate by the use of a particular technique rather than by outcome ( that is , treat similar genetic modifications differently depending_on whether they are wrought by recombinant_DNA methods or by &quot; classical &quot; methods ) have been widely criticized on scientific and competitiveness grounds following their adoption in the European Union and in Japan . The treaty panel discussing the form and implementation of the safety protocol has already headed down the wrong track : A preliminary report suggests a protocol drawn along the European lines . That would be a mistake . But no signatory is obliged to accept a defective biosafety protocol , and the United States will have a better chance of moving the parties toward the kind of science-based regulation it favors if it is present as a party and not just an observer . In reaching its decision , the Senate will have to navigate in a blizzard of misinformation . For example , one article of the convention is an admirable provision requiring each party , as far as possible , to prevent the introduction and control the spread of alien species that threaten ecosystems . It is plainly aimed at the kind of introductions -- goats and pigs on Pacific islands , rabbits in Australia and the_like -- that have been a very important cause of the extinction of native species . Yet in a Washington Times editorial it was asserted that the provision referred to domesticated animals -- alien cows ! -- and would mean &quot; eliminating the U.S. livestock industry. &quot; Nothing , of course , could be further from the truth : &quot; Alien species &quot; does not apply to domesticated animals . The Senate Foreign Relations Committed , in formulating its unanimous recommendation for ratification last June , heard a lot of testimony . Much of it dwelt , understandably , on the potential economic gains to be realized from biological diversity . For many of us , though , the central concern is about a collection of_values , both humanistic and scientific , now being lost in this greatest extinction episode in the planet ' s history . The tens of millions of undiscovered , undescribed species -- in addition to the much smaller number we already know about -- represent an irreplaceable resource ; each is the unique end-point of a long evolutionary process that will never be duplicated . One may be the keystone of a complex ecosystem that plays some role in climate stabilization . Another may contain gene sequences that may yield new understanding about the control of behavior . Still another may , because of its beauty or its grandeur , have a special hold_on the human imagination -- as eagles have for some of us , or otters for others . Failure to ratify this treaty would send a signal to the world that we do not care about these values , and that we are not prepared to join with the vast majority of nations in preserving them . That would be even more damaging than the lost opportunity itself .</TEXT>
