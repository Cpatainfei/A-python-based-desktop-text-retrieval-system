   <HEADLINE> POLLUTION IS CHANGING CLOUDS , RESEARCHERS FIND ; ENVIRONMENT : STUDY ALSO SAYS SUNLIGHT AND HEAT COULD BE REFLECTED BACK INTO SPACE , POTENTIALLY COOLING THE PLANET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The lumbering C-130 skims perilously close to the ocean waves , collecting data suggesting that pollution may be altering the clouds above -- and ultimately Earth ' s climate . Researchers think smog is creating clouds where none existed and increasing the brightness of normal clouds . That , in turn , reflects sunlight and heat back into space , potentially cooling the planet . &quot; It ' s unlikely that would be enough to force us into an ice_age , but it ' s certainly likely to cool the climate significantly , &quot; said project scientist Phil Durkee . &quot; The best models we have seen indicate this could be_on the same scale as what has been predicted for global warming -- only in the opposite direction , &quot; he said . The Monterey Area ShipTrack Experiment grew out of mysterious bright white_lines spotted crisscrossing the ocean cloud_cover in the first satellite photos shot three decades ago . The lines were eventually traced to ships . But smokestacks failed to produce enough visible smoke to explain the tracks , some of which stretched hundreds of miles . Attention soon centered_on invisible microscopic particles spewing from the smokestacks , which allow moisture in the atmosphere to precipitate more quickly . In effect , smog apparently seeds the air , creating clouds . * And if narrow ship tracks had such a striking effect , the far more extensive pollution over land could potentially change vast stretches of the Earth ' s cloud_cover . The MAST experiment , a joint U.S.-British effort operated out of the Naval Postgraduate School near Monterey , is testing those theories . Participants included five U.S. Navy ships , a high-flying ER-2 from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , a Royal_Air_Force C-130 and a smaller C-131 from the University of Washington . Packed with instruments ranging from exotic lasers to common wind_vanes , the_British C-130 zigzagged behind the unsuspecting freighter Hanjin Barcelona as it steamed toward Long_Beach . &quot; Fly down the plume , &quot; ordered Douglas Taylor of the Meteorological Research Flight facility in Farnsborough , England . The plane banked into the invisible trail of smokestack exhaust behind the vessel . Inside the plane ' s computer center , meteorologist Jonathan Taylor peered into instruments showing particle sizes and amounts , as well as cloud reflectivity . One plume , he said , is 15 miles wide . The ship tracks are minor contributors to global cloud pollution , but their sharp definition and location in relatively unpolluted skies at_sea makes them ideal for study . &quot; They act_as a really nice , controlled_experiment -- we have a nice clean cloud , then the ship makes_it dirty , &quot; said Taylor . &quot; But the findings relate to pollution anywhere. &quot; The graphs jumped as the C-130 crossed the freighter ' s invisible pollution plume . Cloud reflectivity soared . The findings have a military purpose as well , participants reluctantly acknowledged . Knowing which ship engines produce which ship tracks could be useful in a naval confrontation . But most participants are interested in the broader climate implications . Back at the operations center , they leafed through satellite photos showing the Hanjin Barcelona ' s ship track off the California coast . Durkee pointed to a brighter swatch of clouds just off Monterey Bay . &quot; There are ships under there , but the coastal clouds are already so polluted from land sources that they don ' t leave ship tracks , &quot; he said . The British meteorologist flipped to a photo of his homeland that showed clouds turning far brighter as they reached England ' s polluted coastal cities . Los Angeles-area shots show the same , said Durkee , with power_plants leaving especially long trails . In fact , they say , the cloud_cover over the entire Northern_Hemisphere is brighter , or more reflective , than in the less developed Southern Hemisphere . Exactly how the change will affect Earth , they add , is uncertain .</TEXT>
