   <HEADLINE> PEOPLE : NOVELL HIRES HEWLETT-PACKARD EXEC FOR TOP JOB ; COMPUTERS : THE SOFTWARE GIANT NAMES ROBERT J . FRANKENBERG PRESIDENT . HE IS NOTED FOR STRATEGIC THINKING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Novell , the software giant that plans to merge with WordPerfect so that it can better challenge industry leader Microsoft , on Tuesday named a veteran Hewlett-Packard executive to succeed Chief_Executive Raymond J . Noorda . Robert J . Frankenberg , who becomes Novell ' s president and chief_executive , leaves Hewlett-Packard after 25 years , most recently as vice_president and general_manager of the personal information products group . He is credited with engineering a dramatic two-year turnaround of Hewlett-Packard ' s laggard personal_computer division . Noorda , who will continue as Novell ' s chairman , last year vowed to relinquish the day-to-day running of Novell by his 70th birthday this June . At that time , he disclosed that memory lapses were starting to interfere with his decisions . Since Novell ' s decision last month to buy WordPerfect and Borland International ' s spreadsheet business in deals valued at more_than $ 1.5 billion , concerns about who would assume the reins at this critical juncture have dogged the Provo , Utah-based company . In addition to having to integrate the two big acquisitions , Frankenberg also faces stepped-up competition from Redmond , Wash.-based Microsoft , which is trying to horn_in on the fast-growing market for networking software . Novell has dominated that market for products to connect office computers since its introduction a decade ago . * Asked how he intended to compete with Microsoft , viewed by many as an industry juggernaut intent_on squelching all rivals , Frankenberg said in a telephone news_conference : &quot; A key element will be delivering solutions that Microsoft is not delivering . . . . It ' s always good to go where your competitors aren ' t or where they have difficulty following. &quot; Frankenberg , 46 , has won plaudits from high-tech counterparts and investment analysts as a strategic thinker adept at stabilizing operations at Hewlett-Packard . His appointment appeared to put to rest anxiety in the investment community . In anticipation of the announcement -- which had been widely rumored but was not official until after the close of the stock_market -- Novell rose $ 1.50 per share to close at $ 18.375 in Nasdaq trading . &quot; This is a real coup for Novell , &quot; said Robert Corpuz , an analyst with Dataquest , a San Jose market research firm . A fan of science_fiction , Italian cooking and deep-sea and fly fishing , Frankenberg has had a long relationship with Novell , serving for several years as a liaison on matters relating to networking products when he headed Hewlett-Packard ' s network group . Born in Chippewa Falls , Wis. , Frankenberg received a bachelor ' s degree in computer engineering from San Jose State University . He joined HP in 1969 as a manufacturing technician in the former data systems division . He was promoted to various research and development , management and marketing positions in the 1970s and 1980s . * Since 1991 , Frankenberg has led the multibillion-dollar personal information products group . He moved quickly to slash costs and improve marketing , using steep price_cuts to more_than double sales of PC products in 1993 from levels the year before . Among other steps , he reduced support staff to nine people from 300 . In 1993 , the division ' s expenses were less than in 1991 , but business had more_than doubled . &quot; Bob has a steady hand for managing growth businesses , &quot; Noorda said . Frankenberg will join Novell ' s board of directors . With his arrival , Novell will dissolve its office of the president , members of which will continue their responsibilities and report to Frankenberg .</TEXT>
