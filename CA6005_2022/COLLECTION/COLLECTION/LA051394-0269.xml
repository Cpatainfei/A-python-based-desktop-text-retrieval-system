   <HEADLINE> CANNES REPORT ; GLITTER , GLAMOUR AND SILICONE GREET FESTIVAL-GOERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Maybe it ' s a coincidence , but just as the 47th Cannes Film Festival was taking_over the Carlton Hotel , the city ' s flagship location , the International Symposium on Plastic_Surgery was headed out of town . As elegant-looking surgeons ( or maybe they were patients ) said their goodbys in the lobby , up went the usual massive signs for &quot; Beverly Hills Cop III &quot; and &quot; The Flintstones. &quot; Even in a year when the signs would have to substitute for the films , when studio blockbusters were noticeable by their absence , the glamorous images of Hollywood made their presence felt . One image was especially evident , that of Clint Eastwood , the president of the Cannes jury this year , and an icon treated with ever-increasing reverence by the_French . Eastwood ' s chiseled face was_on several magazine covers and the local newspaper , Nice-Matin , even put a photograph of him stepping off his plane and onto French soil on its front page , poetically informing its readers that the actor had arrived &quot; on board a Grumman / Gulf_Stream , the Rolls of business planes for the prince of the West. &quot; Whatever press coverage was not given over to Eastwood or Brazilian Grand Prix driver Ayrton Senna ( whose recent death remains a big story over here ) was devoted to applauding the home country ' s strong showing in the festival , which by one count included three films all its own in the official competition as well as a co-producing hand in nine others . &quot; France in_Force , &quot; proclaimed one cover line ; &quot; France Wakes Up , &quot; insisted another . Both featured photos of always-popular Isabelle Adjani in the most elaborate of the_French films , &quot; Queen Margot. &quot; A historical drama set_in the 16th Century and based on a typically massive Alexandre Dumas novel , &quot; Margot &quot; has the poor woman contending with court intrigues , three potential lovers as well as the Saint Bartholomew ' s Day massacre . No wonder it ' s two hours and 44 minutes . * Even if the industry didn ' t supply any blockbusters , American film is weighing in with well-placed films . Thursday night ' s opening film , &quot; The Hudsucker Proxy &quot; ( known as &quot; Le Grand Saut &quot; or &quot; The Big Leap &quot; in French ) , and the festival ' s closer , John Waters ' &quot; Serial Mom , &quot; are of indisputably U.S. origin . So too are Alan Rudolph ' s &quot; Mrs . Parker and the Vicious_Circle , &quot; starring Jennifer Jason Leigh as the tart-tongued writer ; &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; the latest from pulp-meister Quentin Tarantino , and Mike Figgis ' remake of &quot; The Browning Version &quot; ( technically a British co-production ) , starring Albert Finney , Greta Scacchi and Matthew Modine . And when it comes_to the sidebar events , there are five American films in Un Certain Regard , two in the Directors ' Fortnight and even one ( Sundance favorite &quot; Clerks &quot; ) in the Critic ' s Week . Aside from France , the other European_country well-placed here is Italy . Especially anticipated are &quot; A Simple Formality , &quot; a two-character psychological drama directed by &quot; Cinema Paradiso ' s &quot; Giuseppe Tornatore and starring Roman Polanski and Gerard Depardieu ( which agreed to postpone its release date for two months to be eligible for the festival ) and &quot; Caro Diario , &quot; a potential breakthrough film for writer-director-star Nanni Moretti , who is generally referred to as the Italian Woody Allen for reasons that are never made completely clear . Also Italian is the inspiration for this year ' s official festival poster . A tribute to the late Federico Fellini , it features one of his production drawings for &quot; La Strada , &quot; showing Giulietta Masina as the waif Gelsomina facing the ocean with her top_hat and her drum . Aside from respect for a great director , that poster indicates the auteur orientation of Cannes , this being France after all . Among the critically celebrated directors with pictures on display in the festival are China ' s Zhang Yimou ( &quot; To Live &quot; ) ; Taiwan ' s Ang Lee , whose &quot; Eat Drink Man Woman &quot; is his first since &quot; The Wedding Banquet , &quot; and Kryzsztof Kieslowski , whose &quot; Three Colors : Red &quot; is the last of his trilogy and , if press reports are to be believed , possibly his last film ever as well . And even though the festival has barely begun , several films are already being touted as potential sleepers . Included in this group is &quot; Muriel ' s Wedding &quot; from Australian director Paul J . Hogan , &quot; Burnt by the Sun &quot; by Russia ' s Nikita Mikhalkov ( whose brother , Andrei Konchalovsky , also has a film in competition ) , and two American films by female directors that deal with difficult romantic relationships : Darnell Martin ' s &quot; I Like It Like That &quot; and Kayo Hatta ' s &quot; Picture Bride. &quot; Also high on everyone ' s list is a rather unexpected film , a family saga from unknown Cambodian director Rithy Panh with the no doubt self-explanatory title &quot; People of the Rice_Paddies &quot; that apparently knocked everybody out when it was screened recently in Paris . Too_bad the plastic_surgeons couldn ' t have stuck_around for that .</TEXT>
