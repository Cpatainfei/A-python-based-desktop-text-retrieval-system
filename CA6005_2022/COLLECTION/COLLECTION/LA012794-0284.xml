   <HEADLINE> PENTAGON MAY BE BUDGET BATTLE CASUALTY ; DEFENSE : CLINTON OPPOSES MORE CUTS , BUT ANALYSTS EXPECT TO SEE EFFORTS IN CONGRESS TO SHIFT FUNDS FROM THE MILITARY TO HELP DOMESTIC PROGRAMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite President Clinton ' s vow to hold_firm against further defense cuts , the Pentagon is facing the possibility of protracted battles in Congress this year with lawmakers seeking to rechannel some of its money to domestic programs . Officials say the fiscal 1995 budget Clinton will send to Congress early next month will provide $ 264 billion in new spending authority for military programs , up about $ 3 billion from fiscal 1994 , which ends Sept . 30 . The figure represents something of a victory for departing Defense_Secretary Les Aspin , who had fought to prevent the White_House from slashing more . The small increase over the fiscal 1994 level is meant to finance a military pay raise mandated by Congress last summer . But analysts say that , in the face of growing voter demand to pare the federal budget_deficit further , they expect to see increased efforts on Capitol_Hill to transfer money from Pentagon accounts to help ward_off cuts_in key domestic programs . One reason for the increased pressure is that under new budgetary procedures Congress has imposed a series of spending caps on discretionary spending programs -- those not formally mandated by law -- thus forcing lawmakers to fight even harder over the remains . Last year , the House and Senate removed longstanding budgetary restrictions -- called_fire walls -- that had protected defense spending from such forays , opening the way for lawmakers to divert money from the military whenever they can get the votes . Also facing defense planners is the question of how quickly the White_House will move to obtain extra financing for peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Iraq so that the Pentagon does not have to use its operating funds , which could further erode military readiness . Congressional strategists say that it is too early to tell precisely which groups of lawmakers will challenge Clinton ' s defense spending plan , but they are almost certain that such efforts will be made . The President decided to hold_the_line on military spending_cuts after critics -- including many conservatives in Congress -- warned that further reductions could erode military readiness . Sen . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , has served notice that his panel will oppose any effort to cut defense spending more rapidly than Clinton now plans , and other conservatives in Congress have rallied to support him . The Administration also is facing a growing prospect that over the medium-term it simply will not have enough money , even under current plans , to support a military big enough to win two major regional conflicts at once , as Clinton ' s new policy requires . Although the Administration formally denies any such gap , some private analysts have projected that the shortfall could total as much as $ 120 billion over five years . If those estimates prove to be accurate , Clinton could find himself having to scramble to find the money to maintain the force size that the Pentagon has prescribed . The President told Congress in his State of the Union Address on Tuesday that he &quot; said no &quot; to those who wanted him to cut defense spending further this year , for fear that too deep a reduction might hurt the nation ' s military preparedness . &quot; The budget I ( will ) send to this Congress draws_the_line against further defense cuts and fully protects the readiness and quality of our forces , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
