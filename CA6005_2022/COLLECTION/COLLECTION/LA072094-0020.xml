   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON THE APOLLO ANNIVERSARY ; WAGONS HO ! THE PEOPLE ' S SPACE FRONTIER BECKONS ; GIVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR A SHOT AT COST-EFFECTIVE , ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND OFF-PLANET TRAVEL AND EXPLORATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Twenty-five years after Lewis and Clark returned from exploring western America , the Conestoga_wagons were rolling . Twenty-five years after the Wright brothers flew their tiny flying machine , Americans were buying airline tickets . Twenty-five years after Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the moon , we sit at_home watching old astronauts reminisce on talk_shows . To a 25-year-old American , the &quot; greatest moment in human history &quot; is ancient history . So is it any wonder polls find pessimism about the future among the younger generation ? Listening to Neil Armstrong as he put his foot upon the lunar surface , that 25-year-old American , having been told to expect a future less prosperous than his parents ' , has the right to ask a_few tough questions : A giant leap to where ? For what ? What happened to the grand frontier of NASA rhetoric ? If NASA is our Lewis and Clark , when do the wagons roll ? If space is supposed to be a frontier , when do the people get_to go ? Twenty-five years after Apollo ( and more_than 35 years after the space_program started ) , it costs more , not less , to put a human in space . Meanwhile , we are fed lie after lie_about a fantastic space_station that has nothing at all to do with you and me , and the participation of the taxpayers who fund it all is reduced to listening to the astronauts ' wake-up music on CNN . To top it all off , the head of NASA then dares to decry the lack of vision among the American people when they hesitate to pay_for this mediocrity . What nerve . We have vision , lots of vision ; NASA has simply failed to deliver a product that Americans want . In polls , when Americans are asked if they ' d like to go_into space themselves , almost 50 % say yes , if only for a brief visit . Unfortunately , at several million dollars a ticket , they can ' t . Conventional wisdom is that space is so expensive , only governments can afford it . Wrong ! Space is expensive precisely because it has been almost totally government domain . ( Remember who bought us the million-dollar toilet ? ) If the current space agency had been in_charge of the American frontier , all that would lie west of the Mississippi today would be a luxury condo for four government employees somewhere in Kansas . If space is a real frontier , we must treat it as such . We must decide that opening the frontier is the goal by which we measure all_of our human space activities , not just science-settlement . This is a major distinction demanding a whole different national discussion . The debate is no longer humans versus robots . Human_activities are the goal . Thus the new debate must be over the best and lowest-cost way to open space to permanent human habitation . ( This will often mean we send robots first because they ' re cheaper. ) We need our government to enable us to get_to space and start the work of pioneering , not to do space for us while we watch on TV . Our first frontier priority must be to develop cheap , reliable and clean transportation to space . We must begin to phase_out the old space shuttle , with its $ 1-billion-a-flight cost and its ozone-layer-destroying motors . Instead , the single-stage-to-orbit rocket project , with its rapid turnaround , clean motors and low cost should be made a national priority before the bureaucrats kill it . We must cancel the ridiculously overpriced space_station and let credible private firms bid for the job . This includes Russian firms and U.S. companies that want to recycle the space shuttle ' s external tanks , turning these $ 500-million structures into useful facilities , instead of having them dumped over the Pacific . And we must return to the moon , this time to stay . This doesn ' t mean an Antarctica-style camp but new enterprises in joint government and private ventures . For example , the Japanese are already developing systems to build solar_power plants in space from lunar soil , using American designs . Lunar habitats have been designed and redesigned . We can do this . Why aren ' t we ? To survive as a nation , we need the space frontier , a new national challenge that is exciting and involves the maximum number of us possible . It is not America ' s destiny to survive as the bureaucratic overlord of a gradually dying planet , crammed_full with a divided humanity fighting over scraps and choking on its own wastes . Let us turn outward before we turn_on ourselves . The frontier is calling , and this time we need not take it from anyone else . Imagine a kid desperate for a dream 25 years from now , sitting in a home powered by sunlight captured in space , who can look_to the moon or planets and know that there are people just like her out there . Imagine the power to motivate our children to succeed on this limitless frontier as humanity climbs out of its Earth-bound cradle . On this Apollo anniversary , it ' s right to honor the real heroes who took the first &quot; small steps , &quot; but we must keep our eyes on the future and what we -- you and me and that person over there -- can achieve . We all have the right stuff . We are Americans . We are a frontier people . Give us our frontier and let us prove it .</TEXT>
