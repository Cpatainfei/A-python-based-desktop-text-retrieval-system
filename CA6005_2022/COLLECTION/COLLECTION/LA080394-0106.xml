   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR ; WILSON , BROWN ESCALATE BATTLE OVER RAPE AD ; INCUMBENT AGAIN CRITICIZES CHALLENGER FOR HER STANCE ON A REVISED ' ONE-STRIKE ' SENTENCING BILL . IN NEW TV ADS , SHE ACCUSES HIM OF EXPLOITING THE PAIN OF VICTIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Republican Gov . Pete Wilson and Democrat Kathleen Brown escalated an increasingly bitter dispute over tougher sentences for rapists even though both candidates now support the only version of the so-called &quot; one-strike &quot; bill that is considered to have any chance of winning approval in the Legislature . Wilson held a news_conference at Los Angeles County Jail to criticize Brown , the state_treasurer , for being too slow and too meek in proclaiming her support for the revised rape sentencing bill sponsored by state Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) . &quot; Our ad is fair , &quot; Wilson said in defense of his anti-Brown television commercial that Brown has denounced as a lie and insisted be removed from the air . &quot; It is accurate . And it reflects the differences in our records supporting tougher laws for rapists and other violent thugs. &quot; At the same time , Brown was going_on television with two new ads that accuse Wilson of lying_about her position and of &quot; exploiting the pain of rape victims to cover_up his failed record. &quot; &quot; As a woman in California , &quot; Brown asks the television audience , &quot; do you feel safer today than you did four years ago ? &quot; Brown won support from half_a_dozen representatives of women ' s groups who called a news_conference Tuesday to &quot; speak out against Pete Wilson ' s use of an irresponsible version of the ' one strike and you ' re out ' bill for rape in his campaign. &quot; Brown campaign strategists concede that Wilson , as a Republican male with a long record of being tough on crime , has an inherent advantage on the general issue of crime . But they hope to blunt that advantage by attacking specific aspects of his record . Campaign experts say it is difficult or impossible for a male candidate to better a woman candidate on the issue of rape , for example . The exchange grew out of an ongoing Brown attack on Wilson over another element of the crime issue -- her allegation that relaxed parole policies under Wilson have improperly allowed dangerous criminals back onto the streets to rob , rape and kill . Wilson responded July 26 with an ad accusing Brown of false attacks . On Friday , Wilson released his latest ad , which said Brown opposed his original &quot; one-strike &quot; bill to put all convicted rapists in prison for life without possibility of parole . The ad implied that Brown opposed any &quot; one-strike &quot; bill , even after it was amended to provide a maximum term of 25 years to life with the possibility of parole . Brown called that a lie and said she had endorsed the amended bill . She demanded that he pull the ad from the air . Wilson refused . On Tuesday , he called the news_conference at the jail with Bergeson to say that &quot; there was absolutely no public record that she ever supported even the compromise version. &quot; In fact , Brown aides told reporters July 18 that she supported the amended version of the bill . No major newspapers apparently felt the comment was worthy of a story , thus allowing Wilson to contend that &quot; no public record &quot; of her support existed . Wilson has said he would sign the revised Bergeson bill into law if it passes this year as an interim step . But he added that he would continue to fight for a true &quot; one-strike &quot; law that would send any convicted rapist to prison for life without parole . Brown and others opposed the sentence of life without parole as impractical , saying that it would make_it impossible to win convictions in many rape cases . Democrats accused Wilson of pushing the bill as a campaign ploy , knowing that it has virtually no chance of winning approval in the Legislature . Crime -- including tougher sentences for rapists -- was a cornerstone of Wilson ' s first campaign_for_governor against Democrat Dianne Feinstein in 1990 . When he opened his 1990 campaign on Labor_Day , then-U.S. Sen . Wilson vowed : &quot; This state will not be under siege to rapists or thugs or sellers of crack cocaine. &quot; However , Wilson had little success with that issue against Feinstein , who had developed a record as a tough crime fighter as mayor of San Francisco . This year , Wilson has focused_on the crime issue against Brown , who did not face many crime matters in her two elective jobs to date , as a member of the Los Angeles Unified School District Board_of_Education and state_treasurer . Wilson in particular has attacked Brown for her personal opposition to the death_penalty although she has pledged to enforce the death_penalty law . His July 26 ad striking back at her on the parole issue noted that &quot; Brown is strongly against the death penalty. &quot; Brown ' s latest ads all contain some version of this litany : &quot; I support the ' one-strike ' law against rapists , ' three-strikes ' law against felons , and as governor , I will enforce the death penalty. &quot; Wilson did not have the death_penalty as an issue in 1990 since Feinstein was a strong advocate of executions . But Brown has an advantage over Feinstein because Wilson has been in office for nearly four years and failed to win many of the tougher sentences that he talked_about in the 1990 campaign . In 1990 , Wilson put most of the blame on Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown of San Francisco for appointing committees that had thwarted tougher anti-crime bills . This time , Wilson is not heaping scorn on Speaker Brown , who has been a valuable Wilson ally on a number of critical issues .</TEXT>
