   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / MEMORIES ; GRAHAME L . JONES ; U.S. HAS MISSED ITS BEST SHOT TO ENSURE MLS SUCCESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I remember the date clearly . It was Aug . 5 , 1973 . that ' s when I covered my first soccer match for The Times , or indeed for anyone . Poland was playing Mexico at the Coliseum . I wanted to see the game , so I volunteered to cover it . In those days , no one at the newspaper was interested in soccer , so I got_to go . It was a friendly . The Poles and Mexicans both had qualified for the 1974 World Cup in West Germany and needed some international competition before the tournament . Tony Morejon was promoting the match . Morejon , from Spain , spent more_than half a century keeping the Greater Los Angeles Soccer League in business . He worked long hours and put_up with all sorts of absurd problems . Why ? Because he loved soccer . It was that simple . They won ' t have heard of him at FIFA , any more_than they would have heard of other soccer friends from those early days , Chuck Bowerman from Malta , for example , or John Best , a former referee , from Ireland . But they , and many_more like them , are the backbone of the sport in the United States . Which is why , when thinking_of memories from World Cup ' 94 , their names came_to_mind . They were not involved in the tournament . All they did was lay the groundwork for its success by spending countless hours at the grass-roots level , planting the seeds for soccer to thrive in this country . What a pity if it were all to go_to waste . World Cup ' 94 is history . In the next day or two , the FIFA hierarchy will be gone . The foreign press and fans will be gone . And the greatest opportunity soccer has had to succeed permanently in this country will be gone . And we will be left with what ? Promises of a professional league ? Does FIFA seriously believe Major_League Soccer will be up and running_by April ? Does_it think this World Cup , successful and profitable as it was , will be the catalyst that launches the sport into the big_leagues ? Give me a break . The final whistle had no sooner sounded at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena on Sunday than things began to fall_apart . From now on , look_for infighting and excuses , amateurism and ineptitude , to take center stage as the U.S. Soccer Federation tries yet again to self-destruct . Ego and greed are the name of the game from now on . Is that an unnecessarily negative attitude ? Not when it ' s based on more_than 20 years of covering the USSF and seeing it drop the ball time and time again . Those running the sport in this country , and that means from Alan Rothenberg on down , had a tremendous opportunity here , perhaps the last opportunity to establish soccer as a viable professional sport in the United States . But I think the chance has passed them by . Today , the day after World Cup ' 94 ended , the professional league should have kicked into gear . The franchises should have been in place . The team names should have been known . The clubs should have been signing World Cup players and coaches , capitalizing on the interest generated in the sport by the World Cup . Instead , U.S. soccer today walks_off the edge of the cliff . Coverage in non-Spanish language newspapers and on non-Spanish language television will plummet in volume , if not disappear . It need not be that way . Soccer is not ending merely because World Cup ' 94 has ended . The players and teams are simply moving to different fields in different lands . This fall , qualifying for the 1996 European Championship in England gets fully under way . Forty-nine national teams are involved , including 13 of this World Cup ' s participants . Next year , the Copa America , or South_American Championship , is played in Uruguay , featuring another 12 nations . Next year also brings the second FIFA Women ' s World Championship in Sweden , with the United States as defending champion , as well as the Under-20 World Championship in Nigeria . In 1996 , the Atlanta Olympic Games will feature men ' s and women ' s soccer tournaments in five cities . The same year also sees the start of qualifying for the 1998 World Cup in France . Add in all_the annual national and continental club competitions , the African and Asian championships and innumerable friendlies and its easy to see that there is life after 1994 . But will the United States be part of it ? This World Cup did incalculable good in introducing fans to soccer and giving them a genuine interest in the game . That includes many of my colleagues at The Times who earlier shuddered at the idea of covering soccer . That , perhaps , is my fondest memory of World Cup ' 94 . But would n ' t it have been far better to have had a proper professional league right now , rather than some nebulous promise ? No one will go_to half-empty stadiums to see second- and third-rate American players and a_few over-the-hill foreigners in the MLS . That has failed before . But there is one formula that might work . Let AC Milan have a farm_team in New York , using promising American players and up-and-coming stars AC Milan is interested in keeping . Have the team wear the same uniforms as the parent club . Do the same thing in Chicago with Bayern Munich . The same thing in Los Angeles with Chivas of Guadalajara , and in Seattle with Liverpool in Miami with Sao Paulo . And so on . Make_it a truly international league , reflecting the country as_a_whole . World Cup ' 94 has proved that the United States is not a melting_pot but rather a multicolored quilt . Soccer can and should be a thread that ties the pieces together . It ' s not an impossible dream . It simply needs the right people to pursue it . A few more Tony Morejons , Chuck Bowermans and John Bests , for example .</TEXT>
