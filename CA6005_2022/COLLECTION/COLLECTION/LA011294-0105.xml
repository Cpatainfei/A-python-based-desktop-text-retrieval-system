   <HEADLINE> CLINTON SALES PITCH AIMED AT UKRAINE LAWMAKERS ; DIPLOMACY : THE PRESIDENT IS STOPPING IN KIEV TODAY TO DRUM_UP SUPPORT FOR PACT ON DISMANTLING OF COUNTRY ' S NUCLEAR ARMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Going at the former Soviet_Union with the same sales strategy that won approval for the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , President Clinton is launching a whirlwind campaign to seek support from Ukraine ' s truculent Parliament for his deal to get_rid_of the country ' s nuclear_weapons . Beginning with a two-hour stop today at Kiev ' s airport to express his newfound admiration for Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk , Clinton and other Administration officials plan to lavish promises of aid and affection on Ukraine as the reward for keeping Kravchuk ' s promise of nuclear disarmament . And where some U.S. officials foresaw trouble in Ukrainian nationalists ' immediate opposition to the agreement , a buoyant Clinton professed to see nothing more_than the normal workings of democratic government . Whenever any country ' s leader concludes an agreement , there are always critics in the legislative_branch , Clinton said in Brussels at the conclusion of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization summit_meeting . &quot; This always happens , &quot; he said at a news_conference . &quot; Every decision every executive makes is going_to be second-guessed by people of the legislature . It ' s almost the way the system ' s set_up . It shouldn ' t surprise anybody . &quot; When we approved the side agreements to NAFTA , we didn ' t know at the time whether everybody in Congress would think it was a wonderful idea , &quot; Clinton noted before flying to Prague , capital of the Czech Republic , for meetings with East European leaders . The political and economic chaos in Ukraine makes its Parliament , the Rada , a far_cry from the U.S. Congress , but Administration officials suggested Clinton will try to win Ukrainians over with the same appeals_to self-interest and gain that work in Washington . Most important for Ukraine , which has been shivering through a winter of heating fuel cutbacks and runaway inflation , the President will hold_out the prospect of doubling U.S. economic aid almost immediately , from $ 155 million to $ 310 million , officials said . The concentrated sales pitch is intended to help Kravchuk overcome nationalists ' fierce opposition to the arms deal , under which Ukraine will agree to dismantle more_than 1 # 800 nuclear_warheads inherited from the Soviet_Union . Ukrainian politicians of several stripes have already denounced the agreement , but some members_of_Parliament said the promise of $ 1 billion worth of nuclear fuel as compensation , along with increased U.S. aid , would swing some votes . Nevertheless , some U.S. officials said they were dismayed by early objections from powerful members of the Rada . &quot; that ' s one reason we were trying to keep the details of the agreement under wraps -- to give Kravchuk a chance to sell it to the Rada first , &quot; a senior official said . But when it came_to timing , the State_Department ' s desire to help Kravchuk sell the pact appeared to collide_with the White_House ' s desire to trumpet the President ' s diplomatic success . On Sunday , White_House officials were encouraging reporters to write_about the prospect of an agreement at_the_same_time that State_Department officials were pleading with them not to . Clinton believes this agreement is more likely to hold than several similar promises Ukraine made but never kept -- largely because of the money involved and Kiev ' s desperate need for aid , another White_House official said . Clinton and Kravchuk also plan to discuss several issues that remain unresolved in the agreement , officials said . Ukraine ' s Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that the agreement was still only a draft and needed some work . &quot; We hope that the trilateral talks in Moscow will end successfully . But if the document is not ready , then the meeting will have a consultative nature , &quot; spokesman Yuri Sergeyev told a news_conference in Kiev , according to Reuters . &quot; If we succeed in achieving agreement and a document is worked_out fully , it will be signed . But the form has not been worked_out fully , &quot; he said . Anything less than a firm , concluded agreement would be a severe embarrassment to Clinton , who announced the pact with great fanfare Monday . A U.S. official insisted that despite the Foreign Ministry statement , Kravchuk has made a commitment to sign Friday . &quot; They presumably don ' t want the Rada to feel that they are being informed only after the agreement has been concluded , &quot; he said -- though that is , in fact , the case . At any rate , officials said , there is still plenty of time for politicking over the pact , signed or not . Ukraine is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections in March , and Kravchuk has told U.S. officials that he plans to submit the entire nuclear question to the new Rada once it is in place , three months or more from now .</TEXT>
