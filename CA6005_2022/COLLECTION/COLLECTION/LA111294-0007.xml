   <HEADLINE> GOVERNOR IS ONE OF FEW TO DISMISS WILSON PRESIDENCY ; POLITICS : HE REPEATEDLY SAYS HE IS NOT INTERESTED . BUT EXPERTS SAY HIS COMEBACK MAKES HIM A TOP CONTENDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pete Wilson for President ? After winning reelection as California ' s governor in a remarkable comeback victory this week , Wilson is appearing with increasing frequency on lists of potential 1996 Republican presidential candidates who have a solid chance of winning the nomination and the presidency . The 61-year-old governor has repeatedly said he is not interested in national politics and that a second term as governor is all he wants to climax a 32-year career in public office . Still , the talk_of a possible Wilson candidacy should be taken seriously , political experts said Friday . It is , they say , more_than the mostly idle chatter that travels the political circuit every time a Californian is thrust into national celebrity by the mere fact of winning the governorship . &quot; Oh , take it seriously . Absolutely , &quot; said Darry Sragow , a respected Democratic political consultant . William Schneider , a political analyst for the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and Cable News Network , said , &quot; A lot of Republicans think he ' s the answer . He ' s tough . He ' s wily . He ' s created his own miracle . He came_up from the worst possible situation and turned the election around. &quot; On Friday , Al Neuharth , the founder and publisher of USA Today , said in his weekly column that Wilson &quot; is far out front for the rejuvenated Republican_Party ' s presidential nomination. &quot; Neuharth , a prominent corporate media figure for decades , went so far as_to list potential vice presidential running_mates for Wilson . With its early March primary , California is in the bag for Wilson , Neuharth said . That will allow Wilson to focus_on such other big March primary states as New York , Ohio , Michigan , Illinois and Florida . &quot; Win most of those and it ' s over before April_Fools ' Day , &quot; Neuharth said . A Wilson candidacy was predicted this year by the late former President Richard Nixon . The item was greeted as something of an interesting footnote after Nixon ' s death April 22 , when New York Times columnist William Safire reported that one of Nixon ' s last political predictions was that Wilson would be nominated for President if he survived his reelection effort this year . Safire , who had been a Nixon aide , quoted Nixon as saying : &quot; If Pete Wilson survives in California in ' 94 , he will be nominated in ' 96 and will be a strong candidate . He ' s very good on foreign and defense_policy . Been everything -- mayor , senator , governor . A moderate on domestic stuff , but not a mushy moderate. &quot; Nixon was something of a mentor to Wilson . The governor ' s first job in politics was as a 28-year-old advance man in Nixon ' s unsuccessful campaign_for_governor of California in 1962 . Nixon , then a former vice_president , ran against Democratic Gov . Edmund G . ( Pat ) Brown Sr. , the father of Wilson ' s 1994 Democratic foe , state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown . George Gorton , Wilson ' s reelection campaign manager , said Friday that Wilson has not changed his position that he is not running_for President . &quot; The governor said as recently as Wednesday that nothing has changed , &quot; Gorton said . &quot; I take him at his word that nothing has changed. &quot; When Wilson opened his reelection campaign in March , he was asked by reporters if he would serve a full_term in Sacramento and not seek the presidency . &quot; I ' ll rule it out , &quot; Wilson said . On another occasion recently , a reporter asked if he planned to serve a full_term and not run_for national office if reelected this November . &quot; Yes , &quot; Wilson said . He smiled and walked away . On election night , there were chants of &quot; Pete in ' 96 &quot; and &quot; First_Lady Gayle &quot; when the newly reelected governor and his wife emerged at the Republican victory party . As he stood at the podium , one enthusiastic supporter screamed : &quot; Let ' s go Pete ! President Wilson ! &quot; Wilson beamed . The crowd roared . As long as talk_of Wilson for President persists , everything he does will be examined for signs of whether he is running . For instance , he will address the National Press Club in Washington this Friday and what he says will be minutely analyzed by Washington reporters . What does he have to do now if he wants to run ? Schneider said about all he would have to do is travel around the country . Other_than that , Wilson would have to do little overtly in the near future to make himself a candidate . He is a prodigious fund-raiser and sources said he would not have trouble raising the necessary money in time . In many states , he will be_on the ballot automatically in Republican primaries unless he signs a statement absolutely declaring he is not a candidate . Two of the last three California governors ran_for President with mixed results . Ronald Reagan sought the GOP nomination and lost twice , including an abortive late-blooming attempt when he was governor . Long after he was governor , Reagan came_back to win the nomination and the presidency in 1980 and reelection in 1984 . Former Gov . Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr . unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination several times , while he was governor and after he left_office . There was some talk_of Wilson for President when he first won the governorship in 1990 after serving in the state Assembly , as mayor of San Diego and a U.S. senator . That talk died as California was racked with recession , riots and natural disasters . Wilson was forced to agree to a $ 7-billion tax increase in 1991 , but later said that was a mistake and vowed that it would never happen again . His job rating as governor plummeted to record lows . Presidential talk -- most of it emanating from the East and within the Washington Beltway -- revived this summer as it became apparent that Wilson was headed toward victory over Brown , less than two years after he was given little or no chance of winning a second term . In 1990 , Wilson ran as a moderate Republican , strongly supporting abortion and gay rights and boasting of his environmental protection achievements in the Senate . In 1994 , he ran as a conservative , linking his campaign to a pledge of no tax increases and being tough on crime and illegal immigration . Former Vice_President Dan Quayle and Sen . Bob Dole of Kansas have been mentioned most frequently as possible presidential contenders . There is a growing consensus that Dole , who will become Senate majority_leader again in January , will not run . Neuharth doubted that Quayle could win . Other potential Republican candidates include Sen . Phil Gramm of Texas , who oversaw the successful national campaign to win_back control of the Senate ; former Reagan Cabinet secretary Jack Kemp , and others . Sen . Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania is expected to announce his candidacy next week . Schneider said the GOP nomination takes_on new luster with the big Republican victory of 1994 . &quot; The field is completely wide open , &quot; Schneider said . &quot; Pete Wilson has a big plus , which is California . Bill_Clinton can ' t win without California. &quot; Wilson ' s handicaps among GOP voters include his support of a woman ' s choice on abortion and the $ 7-billion tax increase . &quot; The Republican_Party smells red meat . They smell blood . They ' re looking_for another Reagan , not another Bush , &quot; Schneider said . John Brennan , director of the Los Angeles Times Poll , noted that although many Eastern observers may consider Wilson ' s revival in the last two years a virtual miracle , Wilson got_about half his votes from Californians because he was &quot; the lesser of two evils. &quot; And although he has rebuilt his job rating from 30 % to 50 % , &quot; that still is not stellar , &quot; Brennan said . Sragow , the Democratic consultant , also noted that Wilson is not a charismatic campaigner : &quot; He ' s not warm . He ' s not fuzzy . He is not emotional. &quot; &quot; But he keeps doing_it , &quot; Sragow added . &quot; He is probably the shrewdest political strategist and technician in the country. &quot; A practical problem facing Wilson is that if he were elected President , his resignation would turn_over the governor ' s office to a Democrat , Controller Gray Davis , who was elected lieutenant_governor Tuesday . But Sragow said that would not top &quot; a list of reasons why Pete Wilson can ' t be President . If I want to be President of the United States , I ' ll find a way around that. &quot; In fact , if Republicans are in control of one or both houses of the Legislature by January , 1997 , they could effectively checkmate a Democratic governor on most major issues -- particularly state spending .</TEXT>
