   <HEADLINE> PROSECUTION WON ' T SEEK DEATH_PENALTY AGAINST SIMPSON ; COURTS : DISTRICT_ATTORNEY WILL ASK FOR LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT PAROLE . DEFENSE SAYS IT CAN NOW CONCENTRATE ITS EFFORTS ON WINNING ACQUITTAL FOR THE EX-FOOTBALL STAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ending weeks of anticipation , prosecutors announced Friday that they will not seek the death_penalty against O.J. Simpson and instead will ask that he be sentenced to life in prison without parole if convicted of murdering his ex-wife and her friend . In a letter sent to Simpson ' s lawyers , Assistant Dist . Atty . Frank Sundstedt said the decision was made after &quot; consideration of all available aggravating and mitigating penalty phase evidence. &quot; The district_attorney ' s office also released a statement saying that Sundstedt ' s decision was reviewed by Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti , who concurred . Robert L . Shapiro , one of Simpson ' s lead attorneys , said the decision meant the defense could concentrate its efforts on winning an acquittal for the former football great at his trial , scheduled to begin Sept . 26 . Until the death_penalty issue was decided , Simpson ' s lawyers had not known whether they needed to prepare_for that aspect of the case as well as the primary trial issues . &quot; We are continuing to prepare_for trial , and this decision does not affect that , &quot; Shapiro said . &quot; The work goes on. &quot; Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , Simpson ' s other lead counsel , declined to comment in detail , saying only : &quot; I think they made the right decision. &quot; The death_penalty decision came nine days after the initial deadline prosecutors had set for deciding the issue . Simpson ' s attorneys protested last week that they were being forced to prepare_for trial without knowing whether their client was fighting for his freedom or his life . Legal experts , who had criticized the delays , generally agreed that the district_attorney ' s decision was not only legally correct but strategically sound . Among other things , they theorized that it would have been difficult for prosecutors to win a conviction if jurors had been confronted with the possibility of putting the football legend to death . Before making the decision , Sundstedt consulted with a seven-member committee of top officials from the district_attorney ' s office . Simpson ' s attorneys declined an invitation to appear before the committee . &quot; We did not participate in the death_penalty determination because O.J. Simpson is innocent_of these charges , &quot; Shapiro said . Neither the district_attorney ' s letter nor the statement detailed the office ' s reasons for not seeking the death_penalty . A member of the committee said the decision was not difficult and was reached without significant disagreement among the panel members . &quot; It was easy , &quot; the committee_member said . Another committee_member , who also requested anonymity , said one major factor_in the decision to seek life in prison was Simpson ' s lack of a felony history . The committee last formally met Thursday , but reporters were told then that the Simpson case was not on the agenda . Garcetti approved the decision Friday morning , but delayed announcing it until after he notified members of the two victims ' families . The decision by the district_attorney ' s office comes more_than a month after Simpson was arraigned in Superior_Court on charges that he killed his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman . Simpson has pleaded not_guilty to those murders . Goldman ' s father , Fred , said outside his Ventura County home that he had heard about the prosecution ' s decision but did not want to discuss it . &quot; that ' s not an issue I want to comment on publicly , &quot; he said . Nicole Simpson ' s parents in Dana Point could not be reached for comment . A message on their answering machine said they would make no statements to reporters . At a hearing Aug . 31 , Simpson ' s lawyers complained about the delay in announcing a death_penalty decision , saying that it made_it difficult for them to prepare_for a trial scheduled to begin in less than three weeks . &quot; We think it is fundamentally unfair for us to be left in a situation where we don ' t know what to prepare_for , &quot; Shapiro said during that hearing . Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito shared that concern , and urged prosecutors to move as quickly as possible to make a decision . The delay , he said &quot; complicates all_of our lives immensely. &quot; In particular , the looming question of the death sentence had a direct impact on how the two sides would proceed with jury selection , which is scheduled to begin Sept . 26 . In death_penalty cases , jurors who feel they could not order any person to be executed are automatically excused . As the district_attorney ' s office weighed the decision , it was confronted by an unusual level of public interest and disagreement . Some activists , including a group of leading African Americans , have criticized certain aspects of Garcetti ' s handling of the Simpson prosecution and raised concerns that the death_penalty decision would be in the hands of the all-white , all-male Special Circumstances Committee . Gloria Allred , a prominent attorney known for backing women ' s issues , urged Garcetti to seek the death sentence , arguing that to do otherwise was unfair to battered women . The district_attorney ' s statement alluded to those pressures but said they did not influence the decision . &quot; While the office is aware that there is deep public concern about whether the death_penalty will be sought in a case , the decision must be independent of this concern , &quot; the statement said . John Mack , head of the Los Angeles Urban League office , said he expected anger from women ' s rights activists who had urged Garcetti to seek the death_penalty because it had been sought against women accused of killing their husbands and because Simpson had a history of physically abusing his ex-wife . But that reasoning , Mack said , is misguided . &quot; Spousal abuse is a horrible , obscene thing , and it is clear O.J. Simpson was given a smack on the wrist for it because of his celebrity status , &quot; Mack said . &quot; I don ' t want to get_into any arguments from activists in the women ' s rights movement about who has been jacked around more by the system , but they are really missing the point that this case ought to be judged independently and separately. &quot; Despite the competing views , most legal_experts had predicted that the death_penalty was unlikely to be sought in the Simpson case . As a result , few were surprised Friday . Laurie Levenson , a Loyola law_school professor and former federal prosecutor , said a variety of factors had made_it unlikely that the district_attorney ' s office would seek to execute Simpson . Sympathy for the famous football star , his lack of a lengthy criminal_record and the rarity of imposing the death_penalty in domestic homicides all weighed against seeking it in this case , Levenson said . Also , legal_experts noted that almost all prisoners on Death Row have few financial resources . Simpson is a multimillionaire . Under Garcetti ' s administration , the Special Circumstances Committee has reviewed about 300 cases as of July . Capital_punishment was deemed warranted in about 16 % of those cases , according to statistics provided by the district_attorney ' s office . Death was most often sought when someone was killed in the course of a robbery . It was next most often sought in cases involving multiple murders , the special circumstance with which Simpson is charged . Only one domestic violence case resulted in a decision to seek the death_penalty . The committee , according to its own guidelines , does not seek the death_penalty unless it believes that the evidence bearing on the issue is of &quot; such convincing force &quot; that a judge or jury would have no choice but to conclude that the aggravating circumstances , those that work against the accused , outweigh the mitigating_circumstances , those that work in his or her favor . Charlie Gessler , the capital cases coordinator in the public_defender ' s office , said Friday that Garcetti ' s decision was a &quot; perfectly proper one. &quot; &quot; The problem in that case has been O.J. ' s celebrity status and the fact that everybody has been waiting for the D.A. ' s decision , &quot; he said . &quot; If this were a case of a non-celebrity , I think the decision to go_for life would have been made long ago. &quot; Gessler said Garcetti ' s decision &quot; takes_into_account the realities of any domestic situation , a long-term marriage situation or romantic situation where emotions come_into play. &quot; Peter Arenella , a UCLA law professor , cited some of the same issues and said the district_attorney acted correctly . &quot; No jury would have given Mr. Simpson the death_penalty for two important reasons , &quot; he said . &quot; First , they couldn ' t have dehumanized him , which is what jurors need to do when they impose the death_penalty . Second , Mr. Simpson doesn ' t have the past criminal history that would suggest his execution is necessary to eliminate any ongoing lethal threat to society. &quot; Although most observers praised the decision , they also were critical of the district_attorney for taking so_long to reach it . Barry Levin , a defense_attorney and former Los Angeles police_officer , said the decision should not have been a difficult one and added that the delays undoubtedly complicated the task for Simpson ' s lawyers as they rush to prepare_for the upcoming trial . Harland W . Braun , a well-known Los Angeles defense_lawyer , agreed . &quot; I think it ' s astounding that it took them this long to make such an obvious decision , &quot; said Braun , who once worked in the district_attorney ' s office . &quot; Even if it was premeditated , it was still based on simmering passion . It was never a death_penalty case . It seemed as though the D.A. ' s office enjoyed being the center_of_attention for so_long and dickering over somebody ' s life . &quot; Now , like cowards , they sort of make the announcement on a Friday afternoon and run_for home , &quot; Braun added . &quot; They should explain what factors went_into this decision so we can judge the application of the death_penalty from the public ' s point of view. &quot; The most vehement protest came from attorney Leslie Abramson . Abramson is defending Erik Menendez , who faces a possible death sentence . She praised Garcetti for deciding not to seek the death_penalty against Simpson , but called him a hypocritical politician for continuing to seek it against her client , who along with his brother , Lyle , shotgunned their parents to death . &quot; In the absolute sense , it is right : O.J. does not deserve the death_penalty -- even if he did what they say he did , which there is no proof of yet , &quot; Abramson said . But she said Garcetti &quot; can draw no viable distinction ( between ) seeking death for the Menendez brothers and not for O.J. There is only a political difference. &quot; Abramson said both the Simpson case and the Menendez case involve domestic violence . She also stressed that her client and his brother had no prior criminal_record and that two juries had failed to convict them of first-degree murder , a prerequisite for seeking the death_penalty . Therefore , she said the district_attorney ' s decision to continue to seek the death_penalty against the brothers is &quot; neither pragmatic , legal or moral , &quot; but rather political . &quot; Obviously , Mr. Garcetti is not worried about the Cuban American vote , &quot; Abramson said . &quot; Obviously , he is worried about the African American vote at the jury and in the next election. &quot; Times staff writers Andrea Ford , Henry Weinstein , Alan Abrahamson , Matthew Mosk and Rebecca Trounson contributed to this story . Weighing the Death Penalty The district_attorney ' s Special Circumstances Committee does not seek the death_penalty unless it believes that evidence bearing on the issue is of &quot; such convincing force &quot; that a judge or jury would have to conclude that aggravating circumstances -- those that work against the accused -- outweigh mitigating_circumstances , those that work in his or her favor . The following factors could be aggravating or mitigating : * Defendant ' s age : Simpson is 47 . In general , the younger the age , the more mitigating the circumstance . * Criminal_record : A prior felony conviction is an aggravating circumstance . Simpson has no felony record . He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of spousal abuse in 1989 . * Special circumstance : The absence or presence of a special circumstance such_as multiple murder , which is what Simpson is charged with . * Force : The presence or absence of attempted use of force or violence or the threat of force of violence . The deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were very violent . * Emotional state : Whether the accused was at the time of the crime extremely mentally or emotionally disturbed . No evidence of this has been publicly offered one way or another in the Simpson case . * Victim ' s role : Whether the victim participated in the homicide or consented to it . No public indication of this in the Simpson case . * Extreme duress : Whether the accused acted under extreme duress or substantial domination by another person . No evidence publicly offered . * Defendant ' s role : Whether the accused was an accomplice rather than a main actor and the degree to which he or she was involved in the crime . No hard evidence publicly offered , but Simpson ' s lawyers have contended in court that one person could not have committed the murders .</TEXT>
