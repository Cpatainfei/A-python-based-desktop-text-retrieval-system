   <HEADLINE> CALENDAR ' S BIG OSCARS ISSUE ; HOW GENERATION X ' ERS WOULD DO THEIR OWN OSCAR SHOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> F or Kalle Matso and Scott White , film critics for the Beach Reporter in Manhattan Beach and cool observers of twentysomething culture , the Oscars represent at once great theater and an agonizing waste of precious TV air time . The Times asked them to deconstruct the telecast -- awards , dance numbers , presenters , acceptance speeches -- with a decided eye toward how to capture the attention of the younger generation of movie fans . Kalle Matso : You know , people often criticize the Oscars , calling it a long and tawdry event that does little justice to the art of cinema , and the fact is they bring_up some good points . But even if this is true , there is no better alternative to the Academy Awards . Over the years it has remained the best thing going_for people who love movies and the people who make them . Scott White : I disagree . The idea -- celebrating the best films of the year -- is great . But , during that vacuous period between envelope openings , I have to employ all my self-discipline not to channel surf over to &quot; Cops. &quot; Matso : Are you saying that the only reason you watch is to find_out who the winners are ? White : That and to find_out who ' s going_to wear which color ribbon for which cause . I ' m dying to see what hue will be worn by those who want to do_away_with the Electoral College . Matso : You might as well just watch the recap on Headline News . You ' re missing the whole point of the Oscars -- the pageantry , the celebration . White : The cheesy dance numbers , the bad cue-card jokes . Matso : I don ' t think the musical interludes are cheesy . I just think the managers make some ill-advised choices sometimes , and I ' m sure they learn from their mistakes . I ' m almost positive that Rob Lowe will no longer be considered for any songs that require great vocal range . White : I have to admit that I ' m looking_forward to seeing Bruce Springsteen perform his song &quot; Streets of Philadelphia. &quot; Still , based on the decisions that have been made in the past , I would n ' t be surprised if he was backed_up by the Brotherly_Love Dancers . Matso : What would you change besides the music ? You can ' t cut the retrospective film montages . that ' s consistently one of the best parts of the show -- providing , of course , that they continue to postpone &quot; The Year of the Brat Pack. &quot; White : But seeing that this year ' s motif is &quot; The Men and Women Behind the Camera , &quot; I ' m afraid what we ' re going to get is a montage of different production assistants being yelled at . Matso : Some of it might be uninteresting , but I think it ' s about time that gaffers and best boys got their due . I also like the idea that we mindless filmgoers are going_to learn something about movies that ' s more significant than how hot Geena Davis looks in evening wear . White : I ' m not saying those behind the lens shouldn ' t be lauded . I just don ' t think most movie fans camp_out in front of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to catch a quick glimpse of &quot; The Piano ' s &quot; cinematographer . If I had just two wishes , I ' d have all_of these technical awards given_out at a totally separate ceremony . And then , of course , I ' d wish for a lot more wishes . Matso : But then the whole show would be over in about an hour . Most of the cars would n ' t even be parked by then . White : Worse things could happen . And if they really do want to stretch it out for a_couple_of hours , they can just add a_few more eye-catching categories . Matso : Like what ? Best performance in a nude scene ? White : Sure . They could even introduce some new specialized endowments , like the Michael Caine Award for the actor who appears in the most movies in a single year , or the Bobby De Niro Award for the person who , in preparing_for a role , achieves the greatest weight fluctuation . Matso : But flashier categories would turn a time-honored tradition into the MTV Awards . The Oscars are supposed to have a little bit of class . It ' s not like these are the People ' s Choice Awards , where you have to be familiar to all readers of US magazine . We ' re talking_about the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences here . White : that ' s another thing . Who is in the academy anyway ? Once in , are they in_for life ? I get the feeling they ' re like the Politburo -- no ousted members until the next cultural revolution . Matso : I think they must be the same people who leak to the press whose &quot; year &quot; it is . Have you noticed this ? Every year , a_couple_of weeks before the Academy Awards , the media decide that certain people have had_the_best years . Tom Hanks is supposedly the favorite to win the Oscar for best actor because it ' s &quot; his year. &quot; Why is it his year , besides the fact that he had a nice speech at the Golden Globes ? Why isn ' t it Pete Postlethwaite ' s year ? White : I have no idea . I also have no idea why this is billed as a classy , artistic event when you have all_of the major studios spending tons of money lobbying for their films . With all_the politics that go_into the distribution of these trophies , I ' m surprised that James Carville hasn ' t been hired as a consultant by Miramax . Matso : Now you ' re really nit-picking , and you still haven ' t mentioned the emcee , the aspect of the show that I think is the best candidate for some editing . White : You ' re not looking_forward to Whoopi Goldberg ? At least we ' re not going_to have to put_up with Jack ( Crude Is Often Funny ) Palance . Matso : I just don ' t think that the Academy Awards should be a second-rate version of the &quot; Tonight Show. &quot; The most prestigious gathering of cinematic talent is definitely not the right place for John Bobbitt jokes . I say cut the monologue shtick down a bit and get right into the best part of the show . White : Which is ? Matso : The human element . I really look_forward to hearing what the winners will say . that ' s half the reason I tune_in . I say half , because I usually lose interest when the six makeup artists line_up to thank their kin . White : I ' m not so hot on the speeches . With few exceptions , I find them unoriginal and often laced with political platitudes . You never know when some actor will hold_up his Oscar and tell the audience that , simply by thinking happy thoughts , we can reunify the Korean_Peninsula . Matso : Well , if someone wins an Oscar , they ' ve earned the right to a captive audience . But the presenters , who haven ' t been honored for anything , display an amazing lack of tact when they revise the script to suit their socioeconomic platforms . Pretty soon , the celebrity introductions will include political leanings as well as movie credits . &quot; She ' s the liberal from ' Thelma &amp; Louise. ' He made millions of dollars in ' The Player ' and has a soft_spot for Haitians. &quot; White : I agree . Preachy presenters should face some kind of punitive measures . They ought to pay a fine or have to stay after and help clean_up . Matso : On the other hand , it ' s the idiosyncrasies of the celebrities that keep many people glued to the tube . You never know when Kim Basinger is going_to embarrass herself by telling the entire world what film she thinks should win for best picture . People debated for weeks whether Sally Field ' s exclamation &quot; You like me . You really like me ! &quot; was touching or tacky . I myself was really moved by the simple and sincere way that Gene Hackman accepted his award for best supporting actor -- saying it was a great experience to make &quot; Unforgiven &quot; and dedicating his award to the memory of his uncle -- last year . These are the kind of moments that make_it surprisingly pleasurable to spend three hours watching extremely affluent people collect more stuff . White : With the exception of the Gene Hackman anecdote , those are the moments that rekindle my love of the written word . The best thing about the Oscars isn ' t the people ; it ' s being able to re-experience some of the best moments of film from that particular year . I wish they ' d show longer scenes from each movie , especially when reviewing the best picture nominees . It kills me that they edit the clips so that the Price Waterhouse guys have more time to explain the intricacies of vote tabulation . Matso : I think my original point is still valid . Yes , the Academy Awards show is flawed , but it ' s the most respected celebration of something we both love : movies . Criticize it all you want , I know what you ' ll be doing on Monday evening . White : So do I . I ' ll be watching &quot; Evening Shade &quot; and the TV movie of the week , while my VCR records the Academy Awards . Nothing will give me more pleasure than fast-forwarding past the drawn-out dance numbers and forced puns to the 40 minutes that matter . As long as you don ' t crank-call me and tell me the winners ahead of time , it should be a great night at the Oscars .</TEXT>
