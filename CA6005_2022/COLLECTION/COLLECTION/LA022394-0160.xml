   <HEADLINE> IMMIGRANT STUDY CITES FISCAL GAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rather than being a drain on the economy , immigrants in California contribute $ 12 billion more each year in taxes and other payments than than they cost in schooling , health_care and other services , a new analysis has found . &quot; Immigration is_on balance a plus , &quot; said Jeffrey S . Passel , director of immigration research at the Urban Institute , a Washington think_tank , who unveiled his findings Tuesday in Los Angeles . His analysis is the latest broadside in the war of dueling studies -- often with diametrically opposite conclusions -- that has punctuated the emotionally charged immigration debate . Principally , Passel attacked the methodology of Donald L . Huddle , a Rice University economist whose work has often been cited in California and nationwide as evidence that immigrants deflate federal , state and local economies . Last year , widely disseminated Huddle studies reported that immigrants take_tens of thousands of jobs from U.S. workers and cost California taxpayers more_than $ 18 billion annually . However , Passel disputed evidence of job displacement and concluded that immigrants provide a net benefit of $ 12 billon to the state , once government costs were subtracted from taxes and other payments . On a national level , Passel contended that immigrants contributed $ 28.7 billion more in taxes than they used in_services -- compared to Huddle ' s findings that immigrants cost the nation a net $ 42.5 billion annually . * Among other things , Passel charged that Huddle underestimated immigrant tax payments , exaggerated the size of foreign-born populations , both documented and undocumented , and overstated school enrollments ( education is a major cost for immigrants ) . &quot; His ( Huddle ' s ) numbers don ' t make sense. &quot; said Passel , whose counter-study ( costing $ 10 # 000 ) was financed by the Tomas Rivera Center , a Claremont-based Latino policy study institute . Like Huddle ' s analysis , Passel ' s report did not specifically focus_on illegal immigrants -- the lightning_rod in the debate -- but looked_at all foreign settlers who entered the country since 1970 . Passel calls about one-fifth of that population undocumented ; Huddle says more_than a third are illegal immigrants . Reached at his Houston home Tuesday , Huddle defended his conclusions . &quot; They ' re grasping at straws , &quot; Huddle said of his critics . Supporters of Huddle say immigrant advocates have targeted the Houston professor ' s research to blunt discussion of the issue . &quot; They ' re trying to justify a large-scale immigration program , &quot; said Dan Stein , executive_director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform , which seeks restrictions on entries . Like other experts , Passel finds that a disproportionate amount of immigrant tax funds accrue to Washington rather than to state and local_governments . Huddle maintains that all levels of government lose out . Among other alleged flaws , Passel stated that Huddle ' s reports : * Factor_in a population of 4.8 million undocumented immigrants -- 50 % more_than the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service ' s estimate of 3.2 million . * Ignore Social_Security payments and other tax_revenues generated by immigrants , while excluding benefits arising from newcomers ' spending . * Inflate immigrant participation in a range of benefit programs , including welfare , food_stamps , job training and health services .</TEXT>
