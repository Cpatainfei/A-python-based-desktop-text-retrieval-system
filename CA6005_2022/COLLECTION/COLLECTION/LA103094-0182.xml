   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES : LETTERS ON THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS ; THE DEBATE OVER RIGHTS AND WRONGS THAT IS PROPOSITION 187</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is unbelievable that so many respected and supposedly intelligent people have completely missed the full import of Proposition 187 and its real purpose . For those Americans , the proposition offers the only opportunity to protest strongly the occupation of our nation by other nations . The problem now is one of uncontrolled numbers of aliens , both legal and illegal , overwhelming every phase of California ' s infrastructure . Because there is no employment nor housing for vast numbers of these immigrants , they have become directly related to crime of every description . Many of those in opposition to the initiative are the same people who sold their family homes_in the Los Angeles area in_order to escape this invasion of poverty , crime , inferior schools and foreign languages . They have not looked_back to see the destruction of most areas that have been lost to the invasion . Vote yes on Proposition 187 , paying no attention to the cries of racism and the other constitutional problems concerning the initiative . It will immediately be taken_to the Supreme Court where most of it will be declared null and void by that learned group of officialdom . However , you will have given a political message to the Congress , which has chosen_up to this point to completely ignore the problem . DON R . BEAVER Monarch Beach * As an ESL instructor at Rancho Santiago College , I work with immigrant students . I , too , wonder about the problems that massive immigration is bringing_to our country , but I see the cause as an uncontrolled population explosion that virtually no one is trying to do anything about . Study of the demographic statistics alone makes_it obvious that people are going_to be spilling_over our borders . Yes , the problem does need attention . I doubt , however , that the solution will be found in higher walls or stiffer laws , and the idea of forbidding education to children who are here illegally appalls me . Proposition 187 , I am convinced , as The Times maintains in its editorial of Oct . 2 , will lead to costly court cases and increased gangs . In addition , I believe that Proposition 187 will cause the widespread use of false documents forcing even children to engage in illegal behaviors . In our search for answers , let us remember that immigrants , too , are people -- individuals with passions , dreams , minds -- just like the rest of us . CARLEEN ONO Huntington Beach * In recent editorials and columns , The Times has emphasized supposed dire consequences when Proposition 187 passes . I recall another time when opponents of Proposition 13 had similar warning cries . Proposition 187 is not perfect , nor was Proposition 13 . Both propositions arise from the failure of government to address crisis conditions . Taxpaying citizens are saying with Proposition 187 that the time has come_to fix the crisis . Solutions for big problems begin with the first_step , precisely what Proposition 187 is . Fine-tuning and modification will follow from the courts and Legislature , and Proposition 187 is a loud , clear message for them to get started now , and to use strong , effective means . I will vote for Proposition 187 and for candidates who recognize they are elected to serve taxpaying citizens first and foremost . STEVEN D . ANDERSON Huntington Beach * I am getting tired_of American citizens who want laws upheld and criminal behavior stopped being labeled as racist . Those who want illegal immigration stopped are called racists . Why ? Why is it that when an American citizen , who has worked so hard , in many cases for a lifetime , and wants to keep what little they ' ve managed to accumulate are labeled racist for speaking_up in their effort to do so ? Why is that ? F.J. GUARNERA Laguna Beach * The Times ran an article ( Oct . 3 ) describing the opposition of many churches to Proposition 187 , even to the extent of preaching against the proposal from the pulpit . This leaves no voice from the pews for those who disagree_with their clergyman . The church is free to educate and cure as_many illegal aliens as it wishes to pay_for . The tax-exempt church is free to pay taxes and then enter political debate . It is unfair , however , for the church to lecture a captive congregation on how to vote . BRICE FIALCOWITZ Santa Ana * I am an Amerasian social_worker who strongly opposes ( Proposition 187 ) on an ethical agenda , not a financial one . This initiative does not address illegal immigration , but rather creates a police_state . I , for one , will not report anyone on the &quot; suspicion of being undocumented. &quot; To do so would negate everything that social_work stands_for , as well as fly in the face of both ethical and legal_codes and would further lead to the destruction of our society . VERONICA KELLEY Huntington Beach * As the director of a shelter for battered women , Proposition 187 holds grave concerns . First , the loss of $ 10 million to $ 15 million in federal funds if Proposition 187 passes . Historically , social_services agencies are the first to receive funding cuts when there is a shortfall in state funding . Second , and perhaps most important , battered women who are also immigrants will not only be battered by their partners , but battered by the system as well . Men who batter women who are also illegal immigrants frequently use the women ' s residency status as a tool for control . Even women who are eligible for a green_card are denied access by the battering partner who may lock_away important papers . The question also arises as_to sheltering battered women . Will we be forced to deny access to women who cannot produce the appropriate papers , thereby forcing them to return to the battering partner or living_on the streets ? For God ' s sake , think_about the consequences to the women and children who are the helpless victims of domestic violence . Please vote no on this unconscionably and unconstitutional Proposition 187 . FRAN SHIFFMAN Laguna Beach * While my friend Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) correctly blames the Democrat-controlled Congress for permitting illegal aliens to receive far too many taxpayer-funded services , Proposition 187 remains a fatally flawed and immoral response . Gov . Pete Wilson ' s lawsuit and the success of Operation Gatekeeper along the California border demonstrate that there are better ways to go_around a recalcitrant Congress . It is also sheer hyperbole to suggest that we are &quot; spending California into bankruptcy to provide benefits to illegal aliens. &quot; The demise of this state ' s once great economy is the result of high taxes and over-regulation on lawful businesses and citizens . Extremely low-wage jobs accepted by illegal aliens actually have helped many businesses and families survive in a very unfriendly economic environment -- not to mention the sales and other taxes derived from their economic activity . Come_on , illegal immigrants come here for a job , not a health plan ! But once here , denying them a vaccination threatens all our health and our souls . By using innocent schoolchildren as bait and then denying an education to them , any conservative who votes for Proposition 187 brings shame to their advocacy of traditional family values . Do the right thing , we ' re better than this . BRIAN O ' LEARY BENNETT Seal Beach</TEXT>
