   <HEADLINE> MUSIC ; RECAPTURING ROMANCE ; CROONER JEAN-PAUL VIGNON RETURNS TO THE CABARET SCENE , TAKING HIS CUE FROM THE RENEWED POPULARITY OF SUCH LEGENDS AS TONY BENNETT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Think_of French singer and cabaret artist Jean-Paul Vignon as a butterfly . The Palos Verdes blue butterfly . &quot; The PV blue , &quot; as it ' s called , was believed to be extinct three years after it was declared an endangered species in 1980 . Development in the Palos Verdes area had apparently gotten the better of the blue-winged creature . But in March , scientists found 100 to 200 of the butterflies in their habitat -- alive , if not completely thriving . Vignon ' s school_of_music , the romantically sung ballads and standards of the era of Edith Piaf and Lerner and Loewe and Jacques Brel , was believed to be nearly as extinct . Certainly , Vignon ' s singing career , once a heady circuit of the &quot; The Ed Sullivan Show &quot; and New York nightclub and Vegas appearances , had been in eclipse since , yes , 1980 . &quot; Everything was rock_music , and I just quit , pffft ! &quot; says Vignon , in a sunny Studio City restaurant . But something has happened to bring Vignon back from artistic extinction . Exactly a year after &quot; A Stranger in Paradise , &quot; his first show in 12 years , Vignon is taking his act to Studio City ' s Tonto &amp; Dietz . For the new engagement at the cabaret coffee club , he ' s titling it &quot; A Frenchman in America. &quot; Call it the cycle of show_biz . Vignon sensed a change in the air when Michael Feinstein and Harry Connick Jr . actually charted with standards and Broadway tunes . Since the mid- ' 80s , jazz stars like Keith Jarrett and Wynton Marsalis have energetically re-examined the standards canon . The Sinatra presence continues , of course , and seemed to grow each year into the ' 90s . And now there ' s the Tony Bennett phenomenon . &quot; When I read that he ' s being embraced by the MTV generation , &quot; Vignon says , &quot; it made my heart so happy. &quot; The capper that told Vignon to get his act together was Natalie Cole ' s huge hit , &quot; Unforgettable , &quot; her faithful remake of father Nat King Cole ' s song , incorporating his original vocal . &quot; A Stranger in Paradise &quot; soon followed , to some ringing praise . &quot; Vignon , &quot; noted Drama-Logue critic Polly Warfield , &quot; offers a welcome relief from urban angst , a brief surcease from present cares and refreshments of warmth and bonhomie . &quot; &quot; What struck me with Cole ' s recording , &quot; Vignon says , &quot; was that the old arrangement wasn ' t changed . It was like a sign that it ' s OK to do the old songs , in the old way. &quot; Old is about the last term one would associate with Vignon , strikingly youthful for a man born in the 1930s . But because of his years , he has a considerable life to tell -- a life he gladly interweaves into his show . Vignon was the child of a French father and Italian mother , and a product of French colonial Africa . Though born in the Ethiopian city of Dire-Daoua , he spent most of his boyhood in French Somaliland , renamed Djibouti after independence . &quot; Everyone was poor , &quot; Vignon says , &quot; but because French products couldn ' t get_through to such a remote country in east Africa , we seemed to have nothing but American goods -- from American refrigerators to American_cheese . My parents ' friends were traders , and they once brought this catalogue of items with pictures of the perfect American family and the kids with -- what you say , freckles ? -- and so I was very influenced by this image of wealth and perfection. &quot; The image , amid the dusty but prospering seaport town , seemed further solidified by the most impressive American import of all : the movies . &quot; Seeing these unbelievable sights of Americans on the big screen was just amazing . You can ' t imagine what an impact they had in such a place. &quot; Vignon was yanked out of this world at 11 , when his parents sent him to a French Jesuit boarding school in Avignon , leaving him with mixed feelings he still holds about Africa . &quot; On one hand , &quot; he says , &quot; colonialism was very hard for many people , but it varied tremendously from country to country . I never saw abject poverty in Djibouti , but that was because it was a vital trading center . And there was a real attempt to teach the people . I ' ve found that in those countries that cut themselves off from their former colonial masters , they are in desperate shape . Those that didn ' t , seem to be doing OK . But what has happened in Ethiopia and Somalia , with war and famine , breaks my heart . Ethiopia was once so rich ! It had endless , endless fields of wheat ! Imagine ! &quot; The Jesuits at Avignon drummed into Vignon the notion of life ' s enormous difficulties -- a precursor of_his_own later struggles , but &quot; a real gift , because when I got_out of school , I found that I was ready for anything. &quot; He already knew that he could dazzle people with his singing voice , but followed his father ' s wishes and studied medicine in Marseilles . &quot; Bored to death &quot; is how he describes his state_of_mind then , with the idea of singing never too far away . In his Studio City living room , Vignon points_out a photo of celebrities sitting around the captain ' s table on board the_French liner , Liberte : &quot; There ' s Ernie Kovacs , and Edie Adams and , in the far corner , a young Carol Burnett . I sang on that ship , and they all told to come_to America. &quot; Still , Vignon might have had a major French movie career ( he had already starred in late ' 50s films such_as &quot; Asphalte &quot; and &quot; Promesses Dangereuses &quot; ) but for a two-year compulsory army hitch and the breakout of the_French &quot; New Wave &quot; cinema , which swept aside the kind of traditional , romantic movies he was associated with . Once in America , Vignon ' s career took_off , with several stints on &quot; The Ed Sullivan Show , &quot; &quot; The Tonight Show , &quot; &quot; The Red Skelton Hour &quot; and a perpetual whirl of nightclub dates . &quot; From the start , it was like magic , &quot; he says . &quot; My first night at the Blue_Angel club in New York , Gloria Swanson came_to see me . She thought my hair was too long -- this was 1964 , with the Beatles everywhere -- and later that night , she cut my hair in the middle of her 5th Avenue apartment. &quot; Vignon fulfilled the American image of the romantic , singing Frenchman . Ironically , rather than compare his voice to such renowned Gallic crooners as Maurice Chevalier and Gilbert Becaud , Vignon says that he has &quot; a Bobby Darin kind of voice , able to sing fast and passionate , or gentle and slow . Darin ! Ah ! He could do anything ! &quot; But as pop_music shifted from Darin to the Doors , Vignon struggled . Married with_child Marguerite , then divorced in 1969 , he went_on to host a Canadian-made , Dick Clark-produced series , &quot; The Sensuous Man , &quot; which led to a posing for one of the first Playgirl magazine centerfolds . &quot; That show was fun , nothing really , ummm , suggestive , &quot; he says , a smile on his lips . &quot; We ' d always end the show with me taking a sensuous bath -- in olive_oil , or mud , or flowers , even cereal. &quot; Bad_luck , though , started happening : The Paramount studio executive behind &quot; The Sensuous Man &quot; was dumped , along with the show ; clubs closed , along with his contracts . &quot; I had had it , &quot; says Vignon , his smile disappearing . A series of unlikely jobs followed , including serving as an accountant and public relations man for Ma Maison ' s Patrick Terrail . But the pop cycle came_around again , &quot; and I realized that I not only still had my voice , but I had my own life to tell . We have some new songs this time , but the big difference from ' Stranger in Paradise ' is that I begin with Johnny Mercer ' s ' Dream , ' the dream of a young boy in Africa , imagining America. &quot; Vignon credits three women for his return : British playwright Jane Harris , who helped write and polish the show ' s spoken narrative ; pianist-accompanist Samantha Ryan ; and Tonto &amp; Dietz co-producer Susan Dietz . &quot; She has the perfect room for a singer like me , &quot; he says , &quot; where people can hold hands , and listen , and feel they ' re at home. &quot; WHERE AND WHEN * What : Jean-Paul Vignon ' s &quot; A Frenchman in America. &quot; * Location : Tonto &amp; Dietz , 12747 Ventura Blvd. , Studio City . * Hours : 8:30 p.m. Thursday and May 12 and 19 . * Price : $ 15 .
