   <HEADLINE> VENEZUELAN BANK COLLAPSE THREATENS NATION ' S FUTURE ; FINANCE : BANCO LATINO ' S FAILURE IS WORST EVER IN SOUTH_AMERICA . ANALYSTS FEAR A SOCIAL EXPLOSION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Banco Latino seemed a depositor ' s heaven . It had more branches here than anyone , more services , far higher interest_rates and , best of all , the confidence that comes from being an institution closely connected to this country ' s most powerful industrialists and politicians . Using all_of these advantages and some of the most modern , incessant advertising seen in Venezuela , Banco Latino attracted almost a_million depositors , including the pension_funds of the armed forces and the national electric and oil_companies , as well as the funds of the government ' s bank insurer . Banco Latino bought several other banks and invested millions of dollars in office_buildings ( at last count , it owned 493 ) , farms and hundreds of other businesses . It became the second-largest bank in Venezuela and held 20 % of the market . Its officers owned executive jets -- three for bank Chairman Gustavo Gomez Lopez alone . When a Paris office was opened last fall , important clients and depositors were treated to an all-expenses-paid , three-day trip to France to celebrate . But one month ago , the exultation about the bank turned_to grief : In the worst failure of its kind in South_America , Banco Latino collapsed , endangering not only its depositors ' fortunes but the entire Venezuelan financial system and this nation ' s economic and political future . Immediately at risk is more_than $ 1.5 billion in Venezuela and subsidiary banks throughout the world , including $ 243 million in Miami ' s Banco Latino International that is not protected by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . According to experts here , that ' s far from the worst of it . &quot; The total cost of bailing_out Banco Latino could reach $ 5 billion , &quot; said one of Venezuela ' s most respected bankers . That multibillion-dollar bailout , experts say , is far more_than the government and the banking system can absorb without setting_off a social explosion that could seriously endanger Venezuela ' s already tattered democracy . Venezuelan officials have said little about Banco Latino ' s calamities . Bank officials have either declined to comment or were unavailable in Venezuela . The story of Banco Latino ' s rise and fall begins in the late 1970s , when what had been a small bank was taken_over by some of the country ' s most powerful industrialists . They were so close to Carlos Andres Perez , then serving his first term as Venezuelan president , that Banco Latino was dubbed by many the &quot; Bank of the 12 Apostles &quot; because of its support and connections . Banco Latino ' s president was Pedro Tinoco . He was so close to Perez that he was named the Venezuelan central_bank ' s chief when Perez won a second term as president in 1989 . Other bank &quot; apostles &quot; included members of the Gustavo Cisneros clan , considered one of the two richest families in the country , and Francisco Perez , the president ' s brother . Even with all_of this power , Banco Latino remained relatively insignificant until four or five years ago , when it began a big push to capture at least a 20 % market share . It launched a creative , wide-ranging advertising_campaign . It accepted smaller minimum deposits to attract clients . It put_up automated teller machines and dozens of branches . Above all , it offered high interest_rates . In an economic_system already rife_with inflation , many Venezuelan banks were offering interest_rates reaching 70 % ; Banco Latino gave 8 % beyond that and sometimes even 12 % more . When certificates_of_deposit paid 50 % , Banco Latino paid nearly twice that . As a growth strategy , this plan worked . Banco Latino moved from eighth place in savings deposits in 1989 to No . 1 last year and was clearly Venezuela ' s No . 2 bank overall . Its marketing efforts were so seductive that the U.S. Embassy here even deposited funds with Banco Latino at a time when American economic_experts were beginning to worry about the bank ' s stability . According to banking experts -- who asked not to be identified -- Banco Latino ' s problems began in the early 1990s , when Venezuela ' s economy went_into deep recession . &quot; Prices dropped , &quot; said an analyst who sits on the board of another bank , &quot; and the investments Banco Latino ( made ) stopped producing cash income . It became impossible for Banco Latino to generate enough liquidity to keep_up its interest to depositors. &quot; Another banking source called the bank ' s investments &quot; improvident to begin with. &quot; The bank had sunk its money into long-range investments and , &quot; even in good times , ( these ) couldn ' t have provided the cash needed &quot; more immediately . But instead of retrenching and ridding itself of its bad investments , Banco Latino began what one expert labeled &quot; a Ponzi game , &quot; named for the American confidence_man who bilked investors of millions in the 1920s . &quot; As it became harder to pay its interest , the bank raised its rates even higher to attract ( more ) funds , &quot; the source said . &quot; At one point , it even paid 100 % when the normal rate was 70 % . &quot; By last October , insiders had caught_on to what was happening , sources said , particularly when Banco Latino once paid 1 # 000 % interest on an overnight , inter-bank loan used to maintain liquidity in its system . But even at this point in Banco Latino ' s problem-filled life , experts said , the government declined to act , partially because of a fear that intervention would bring_down the entire banking system by creating a panic . Also playing a part was the political situation . Although Perez was in_trouble and ultimately would be forced from the Venezuelan presidency , his power was real , as was that of his appointees . &quot; You also have to realize , &quot; one banking source said &quot; that many people just couldn ' t believe that a bank as powerful as Banco Latino could collapse . People would say that the No . 2 bank , the ' Bank of the 12 Apostles , ' would not be allowed to fail. &quot; By January , however , there wasn ' t much that could be done . Even employees began pulling_out deposits , setting_off a run against the bank . Most of its directors fled , many to Miami . About $ 900 million was pulled from Banco Latino and sent to its bank in Curacao , the largest island in the_Netherlands Antilles , just north of Venezuela . Finally , on Jan . 13 , the Venezuelan government intervened , freezing all_of Banco Latino ' s funds . The Curacao bank was shut by Dutch officials ; the Miami operation was closed when depositors clogged the bank , demanding money from uninsured accounts . In Venezuela , government regulators found a financial nightmare as they investigated the Banco Latino collapse . They found that the bank could not cover its accounts ; its assets had been misstated ; its capital was backed by undervalued or fraudulent bonds ; its reserves for bad loans were woefully short . Government_agents who took_over the bank began on Jan . 28 paying_back some customers -- those with certain savings accounts -- up_to $ 9 # 300 , a figure that doubled as of Feb . 7 . But that covers only a tiny percentage of deposits . It does not apply to checking_accounts or the other , enormous investments held by the bank . All the armed forces pension_funds in Venezuela , for example , are frozen , as are parts of pensions for the government-owned electrical and petroleum monopolies . The total value of the Venezuelan government accounts held by Banco Latino is estimated at almost $ 1.2 billion . Worse , and as an example of the cozy relationship between the bank and the government , are funds deposited in Banco Latino by the Deposit Guarantee Fund . The fund , known as Fogades , is the Venezuelan equivalent of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . Government records show that Fogades had put 33.6 % of its resources in Banco Latino and 13 % more in another bank largely owned by Banco Latino . &quot; It would be as if the FDIC had given half of its money to the worst of the ( American ) savings and loans , &quot; one diplomat said . There is still more bad news . The Fogades money , as well as other government funds , was not kept_in highly liquid accounts , as the law requires . Instead , it was put into investments that , even if they are sound , will not pay returns for years . Some sources blamed these gaffes on the inexperience of Esperanza Martino , the Fogades chief , who is the wife of the onetime head of Perez ' s personal security_force . More important , the question now is what to do to salvage the Banco Latino wreckage . To the consternation of some experts , not much appears to be happening . The government and several large Venezuelan banks are pooling their reserves to pay_off savings account holders . They are also offering other temporary support to troubled institutions that , in exchange , must increase their capital , take write-offs on bad loans and investments , limit their new credits and pledge to live_up_to the new regulations . The central_bank , for example , has reduced its reserve requirement to help other troubled banks avert a general run . Some analysts see hope in the implementation of a new banking law that took_effect Jan . 1 . It calls_for tighter regulations and stronger enforcement in the industry . Meantime , the government has made broadcasts three or four times a day in an attempt to assure the public of the banking system ' s stability . Officials hope to prevent a panic and to keep Venezuelans from turning_to foreign currency , particularly U.S. dollars , as an investment haven . &quot; If nothing goes_wrong and there isn ' t a run . . . it might work , at least for the short run , &quot; one economist said . Venezuela ' s stability has already taken a series of hits , what with two serious coup attempts in 1992 , criminal charges that forced Perez to resign last year and a criminal indictment of another former president , Jaime Lusinchi . Ultimately , of course , resolving the current crisis will rest with the new government of Rafael Caldera , said one economist , who noted that the president is &quot; perceived as honest and incorruptible . If he acts quickly and decisively , there may be time to reform the system and save it. &quot;</TEXT>
