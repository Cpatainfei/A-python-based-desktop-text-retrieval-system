   <HEADLINE> O.C. MUSIC / CHRIS PASLES ; BORODIN ENSEMBLE A LESSON IN LONGEVITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Borodin String_Quartet is just one year away from celebrating its 50th anniversary , a record for longevity matched by few other chamber-music ensembles . But like most veteran groups , it has gone_through changes in personnel to survive this long . &quot; We were students and very young , &quot; when it was started , recalled cellist Valentin Berlinsky recently , speaking through a translator from Montreal , where the quartet is playing before coming_to Orange County for a concert Saturday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre . &quot; We had dreams to be soloists , to start solo careers , but we really loved quartets , too. &quot; Berlinsky , 68 , and violist Dmitri Shebalin , 63 , are the remaining members of the original quartet , formed in 1945 at the Moscow Conservatory of Music . Violinists Andrei Abramenkov , 58 , and Mikhail Kopelman ( &quot; the baby , at 45 &quot; ) joined in the ' 70s . The changes meant changes in musical interpretation , too . But Berlinsky was reluctant to get_into details . &quot; This is a long conversation , &quot; he said . &quot; You could write a book on this , the changes and their impact . &quot; Every quartet is a very little group , and it is very complicated to work together . If someone is conducting a big orchestra and has his own interpretation , all_the soloists have to follow his interpretation . &quot; In a quartet , the parts are much more sophisticated and complicated than in an orchestra . Sometimes we don ' t come_to a certain decision right away . We discuss it , play it . But our final goal is to find a constant for everybody . that ' s what we try to achieve. &quot; The quartet will play works by Brahms and Tchaikovsky locally , as part of the chamber-music series sponsored by the Laguna Chamber_Music Society and the Orange County Philharmonic Society . The two works -- Tchaikovsky ' s String Quartet No . 3 and Brahms ' String Quartet No . 3 -- were composed in the same year : 1876 . Brahms ' quartet -- his last , written at_the_same_time as his First Symphony -- has gone_into the standard repertory . But Tchaikovsky ' s , which is regarded by some critics a patchwork affair , has not . Still , the musicians &quot; feel very close to Tchaikovsky , &quot; although they remain adamantly &quot; against the idea of talking_about music . We really prefer to perform and the audience to hear the music. &quot; Local audiences may be more familiar_with the quartet ' s eminent interpretations of the music of Shostakovich . The musicians played all 15 of his quartets at Ambassador Auditorium in 1988 and 1990 . This year , Berlinsky said , they will play the cycle six times &quot; around the world , &quot; including the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor at the end of the month , and then in Lisbon , Frankfurt and London , among other places . &quot; Emotionally , it ' s very difficult , &quot; he said , &quot; not only for the quartet , but for the public . His music is heavy and difficult , but at same time , there is a lot of emotional and psychological variety in it . But I want to make a parallel . It ' s the same with all_the great composers -- Beethoven , Schubert , Bartok . It ' s emotionally very difficult to play cycles of all their quartets. &quot; The four musicians live_in Moscow and see each other &quot; every day . But actually , even though we basically live_in Moscow , we spend most of our lives in hotels around the world , &quot; Berlinsky said . They play 100 concerts a year , spending &quot; something like eight months outside ( Russia ) . Sometimes our wives come_with us. &quot; * For them , the political transformation in the former Soviet_Union -- from communism to efforts at a free-market economy -- has not been particularly difficult because &quot; we can have a contract with the West and earn ( hard ) currency . . . . &quot; There are not many people like that . We are a minority . The process of change has been so painful for Russians because the economy was destroyed . There was no economy . It ' s a very painful process and needs a lot of time. &quot; The painful process , they said , explains the political emergence of Vladimir Zhirinovsky , leader of the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party . Zhirinovsky has become notorious for making anti-Western statements and for advocating expanding Russia ' s borders . &quot; The majority of people who voted for Zhirinovsky , &quot; said Berlinsky , &quot; did not vote for him because they love him but because they disagree_with the economic reforms by the government . This is their reaction . They are looking_for a way to make their lives easier . &quot; In a deep crisis , in a political situation such_as exists right now , which is going_on not only in Russia , but elsewhere , people like Zhirinovsky appear , historically . In similar situations , such a figure would appear in a crisis . &quot; But the majority of intellectual people -- most of our friends , musicians , artists , intellectual people , they are not supporters of Zhirinovsky . This is some kind of natural_process . Now , it is terribly difficult for people . That was the mistake made by the reformers . Now they ' re going to pay_for it. &quot; * The Borodin String_Quartet will play music by Tchaikovsky and Brahms on Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Irvine Barclay Theatre , 4242 Campus Drive , Irvine . Presented by the Laguna Chamber_Music Society and the Orange County Philharmonic Society . $ 12.50 to $ 25 . ( 714 ) 854-4646 .</TEXT>
