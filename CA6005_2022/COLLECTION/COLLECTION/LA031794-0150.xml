   <HEADLINE> SURFING : SLATER SHAPING RUN AT WORLD TITLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kelly Slater , surfing ' s Wunderkind who saw his 1993 chances for consecutive world tour championships slip from his fingers , is back in the hunt for a ' 94 world crown with a March 6 victory at San Diego County ' s Seaside Reef in Cardiff , says Rockin ' Fig . Slater looked loose , strong , fast and unstoppable , said Fig , who , as an announcer for the U.S. Bud Tour , scopes out pro talent on a regular basis . Last year , a knee injury and Slater ' s busy schedule , which included his acting job on &quot; Baywatch , &quot; were a lot to contend with , Fig said . There were people who criticized the popular champion that he was cruising last year . At Seaside Reef , Figgy said , Slater pulled a backside 360 . He got a long ride when an outside wave continued to the inside section , and he scored some big maneuvers before blasting the shore break_with an incredible backside 360 . This is good news for Slater watchers . Slater has now warmed_up at two U.S. Bud Tour contests , in Santa Cruz ( ninth place ) and Seaside , and , with the tour scheduled for Huntington Beach from May 11 through 15 , there ' s a chance we may see Slater in local waters to protect his current No . 1 Bud Tour rating . The Bud Tour is part of the World Qualifying Series . I was talking to Slater on the stage after he won at Seaside , and he said that this year he ' s really amped and wants to sharpen his tour performances . He quit &quot; Baywatch &quot; this year , and he ' s really making a strong move with two early season performances right off the bat , before the world tour starts . Second place at Seaside went_to Rob Machado , the Bud Tour ' s defending champion , who lives_in Cardiff . Third was Richie Collins of Newport Beach , Figgy noted . That makes Richie No . 2 in the ratings , behind Slater . This could be Richie ' s year for the Bud Tour . He is still coming_off a back injury , and hopefully it won ' t give him problems . Ted Robinson of Manhattan Beach won Seaside ' s long-boarding contest . Figgy said that ' s two victories in a row for Robinson . But two Orange County long boarders , Josh Baxter and Jeff Krammer , both of San Clemente , were right behind , placing second and third , respectively . Seen socializing at Seaside were top shapers Al Merrick , Rusty Preisendorfer and Gary Linden . They were checking out their boys , guys like Machado who surf for Merrick , and Pat O ' Connell and Jeff Deffenbaugh , who surf for Rusty . Fig also said that the Assn . of Surfing Professionals ' head judge , Renato Hinkel , had a stint on the judge ' s panel for the Seaside event . * Visitors : The Australian national team was in town during February and was hosted by Orange County surfing families , said Janice Aragon , executive_director for the Huntington Beach-based National Scholastic Surfing Assn . Benefit : Les Perry ' s surf-music radio program on KWIZ-FM ( 96.7 ) is sponsoring a Surf Jam ' 94 at 4 p.m. March 27 at the Lakewood Hop to benefit the show . Featured artists include the Chantays , who had the hit &quot; Pipeline. &quot; Hal Jepsen surf films will also be shown . Admission $ 10 . Signings : Surfing pioneer Mike Doyle , who is out with a new book , &quot; Morning Glass , &quot; will visit Hobie Sports in Dana Point on Saturday for a book signing from 9 to 11 a.m .</TEXT>
