   <HEADLINE> GARAGE SALE LIMIT GIVEN INITIAL OK ; GOVERNMENT : SANTA ANA LAW WOULD PERMIT SALES ON ONLY FOUR WEEKENDS PER YEAR . COUNCIL HOPES TO CURB ILLEGAL BUSINESSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an effort to clean_up the city ' s neighborhoods and crack_down on illegal businesses , the City_Council on Monday gave preliminary approval to an ordinance allowing garage sales only on the first weekend in March , June , September and December . The campaign to restrict the sales to four weekends a year grew out of residents ' complaints that such sales were unsightly junk-fests , often covering_for small businesses operating regularly out of driveways and parking_lots . &quot; Other things have been tried and they have not worked , &quot; said resident Joe Vielma . &quot; I hope this gives you the kind of control you need to clean_up the city. &quot; Critics of the proposed ordinance , however , have countered that the sales are simply a way to earn a little cash_in a tough economy . The sales also provide the only affordable merchandise to Santa Ana ' s poorest residents , many of whom don ' t have cars to get_to the closest swap meet , they said . &quot; To dictate to people how they can do_it , when they can do_it , that to me is wrong , &quot; resident Arturo Jacques said Monday . The City_Council last month endorsed the idea of allowing sales only on four specified weekends . But Councilman Ted R . Moreno asked that an ordinance that would have allowed sales on two weekends in May and two in October be modified to allow them once every three months instead , to accommodate residents moving from their homes . The council approved the revised ordinance Monday on first_reading , and must vote on it again next month before it becomes law . The council agreed Monday to review the ordinance in six months and decide whether it is working . If the ordinance receives final approval next month , city staff_members said , all residents will receive notices with their water bills . The sales are a constant occurrence in some Santa Ana neighborhoods , where residents scatter used clothing , appliances , furniture and even tires and television_sets across front lawns , driveways and commercial parking_lots . Some hold one or more sales a week . At a council meeting last month , more_than half_a_dozen people spoke in favor of a crackdown , complaining that their neighborhoods increasingly looked_like &quot; a Third_World country. &quot; Frequent sales violate existing city law , which allows only two garage sales a year per address . But code enforcement officials , who estimate there are 300 to 500 garage sales on any weekend day , say the law has been difficult to enforce .</TEXT>
