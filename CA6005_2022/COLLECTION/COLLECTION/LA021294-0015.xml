   <HEADLINE> U.N. CHIEF DELEGATES AIR STRIKE AUTHORITY ; BOSNIA : SECRETARY_GENERAL ' S REPRESENTATIVE ON THE SCENE HAS AUTHORITY TO CALL UP WARPLANES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a move that appeared to intensify the threat against the Serbs in the_hills around Sarajevo , U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Friday delegated his authority to order NATO air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina to the ranking U.N. official on the scene . The delegation of authority to Yasushi Akashi of Japan , the secretary_general ' s special representative in the former Yugoslav federation , was clearly designed to speed_up the process for reaching any decision to send U.S. and European planes against Bosnian Serb artillery batteries . In his announcement , made in a letter to the Security_Council , Boutros-Ghali also said he had instructed Akashi to meet with U.N. and NATO military commanders &quot; to finalize . . . detailed procedures for the initiation and conduct of air strikes. &quot; This made clear that a decision by Akashi to order the strikes would be heavily influenced by Adm . Jeremy M . Boorda of the United States , the commander of North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization forces in southern Europe , and by Gen . Jean Cot of France , the commander of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslav federation . Cot has complained often that it would take too long for the use of NATO air_power to be approved if the decision had to come from New York . This complaint prompted Britain and France to persuade Boutros-Ghali a_few weeks ago to delegate authority to Akashi for the calling of close air support to protect U.N. peacekeepers if attacked at the Bosnian towns of Srebrenica and Tuzla . U.S. officials said they did not anticipate that Akashi would act any differently than Boutros-Ghali if the need came_to call_for air strikes . &quot; We are fully confident that if the Serbs start shelling Sarajevo from the_hills around the city , the secretary_general or his representative will order air strikes , &quot; a U.S. official said . In a special meeting Wednesday , the NATO council gave the Serbs 10 days to either withdraw their heavy_weapons from the_hills around Sarajevo or put them under U.N. control . NATO warned that it would , at the request of the secretary_general , send planes against any artillery or mortar positions firing on Sarajevo even before the deadline expired and against any such position still in place after the deadline . In his letter to the Security_Council , Boutros-Ghali , still hopeful for a peaceful settlement , also said he had instructed Akashi and the U.N. military commanders to try to negotiate an agreement for a cease-fire in Sarajevo , a withdrawal of Bosnian Serb weapons from the area or their transfer to U.N. control , and a transfer of Bosnian Muslim weapons to U.N. control . Such an agreement had already been worked_out by Lt . Gen . Michael Rose of Britain , the commander of U.N. forces in Sarajevo , but it is still uncertain whether it will hold . The 63-year-old Akashi , a veteran Japanese diplomat and U.N. bureaucrat , headed the U.N. peacekeeping operation in Cambodia that led to successful elections last year . He took_over the operation in the former Yugoslav federation Jan . 1 . He is one of the few longtime U.N. officials who have won the trust of Boutros-Ghali .</TEXT>
