   <HEADLINE> REAGAN SAYS HE IS IN EARLY STAGES OF ALZHEIMER ' S</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a poignant , hand-penned letter to the American public , former President Ronald Reagan disclosed Saturday that he is suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer ' s disease . &quot; I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life , &quot; Reagan , 83 , wrote to &quot; my fellow Americans. &quot; Saying that at the moment he feels &quot; just fine , &quot; Reagan explained that he was going public with his diagnosis to promote broader awareness of the disease -- a progressive , irreversible neurological_disorder that kills more adults in the United States than any ailment except heart_disease , cancer or strokes . In an accompanying statement released by his Los Angeles office , Reagan ' s five personal physicians said the condition was discovered during routine medical testing . &quot; Over the past 12 months we began to notice from President Reagan ' s test results symptoms indicating the possibility of early stage Alzheimer ' s disease , &quot; the doctors wrote . &quot; Additional testing and an extensive observation over the past few weeks have led us to conclude that President Reagan is entering the early stages of this disease. &quot; In the two-page letter , Reagan , who lives_in Bel-Air , maintained his characteristic cheerfulness . &quot; I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this earth doing the things I have always done , &quot; he said . &quot; I will continue to share life ' s journey with my beloved Nancy and my family . I plan to enjoy the great outdoors and stay in touch with my friends and supporters. &quot; Friends reacted with sober acceptance , some acknowledging that Reagan had seemed to be losing mental acuity . Catherine Busch , spokeswoman for Reagan , said Saturday afternoon that the former President was with his wife at an undisclosed California location outside Los Angeles . Busch declined further comment , saying , &quot; The letter speaks_for itself. &quot; The nation ' s oldest President , Reagan was treated for several medical problems during his two terms in the White_House . He underwent surgery for a prostate_gland condition and a colon_cancer lesion during his second term and was wounded in an assassination attempt shortly after he took_office in 1981 . A perpetual optimist , Reagan told a reporter after his successful colon surgery : &quot; I didn ' t have cancer . I had something inside of me that had cancer in it and it was removed. &quot; In his letter -- so informal that it included a scratched-out phrase -- Reagan wrote : &quot; In the past Nancy suffered from breast_cancer and I had my cancer surgeries . &quot; We found through our open disclosures we were able to raise public awareness . &quot; So now , we feel it is important to share it with you , &quot; Reagan continued . &quot; In opening our hearts , we hope this might promote greater awareness of this condition . Perhaps it will encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are affected by it. &quot; He added : &quot; Unfortunately , as Alzheimer ' s disease progresses , the family often bears a heavy burden . I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience . When the time comes I am confident that with your help she will face it with faith and courage. &quot; Around the country , Reagan ' s friends , political allies and foes expressed sadness at the news , as well as admiration for the manner in which the former California governor and Hollywood actor was handling it . &quot; Typical Gipper , &quot; former Reagan speech writer Ken Khachigian said affectionately when Reagan ' s letter was read to him . Khachigian said he had not seen Reagan for a_couple_of years but had heard reports &quot; that he was somewhat less engaged . A lot of us who had been close to him thought that was just the normal aging process . &quot; But obviously this gives a more understandable medical explanation of why he was slowing_down a bit , &quot; added Khachigian , an attorney and political consultant . &quot; ( It was ) courageous of him as usual to come_out with something like this . And I ' m sure that over the next few years we ' ll see that he ' ll continue to have a sunny disposition , that he ' ll have his sunny , optimistic view of life. &quot; In Oakland , President Clinton spoke_of Reagan in his remarks to several thousand Democratic activists Saturday afternoon . &quot; I ' m going_to ask you to do something we normally would n ' t do at a Democratic rally , &quot; Clinton said , asking the boisterous group to remain silent while he made an announcement . A low murmur of dismay could be heard rippling through the crowd as he told them of Reagan ' s condition . &quot; It touched my heart , &quot; Clinton said of the news . He went_on to recount a story of having met with Reagan not long after Clinton ' s election as President . The two conversed about the job , and at one point , Clinton said , Reagan looked_at him and said , &quot; You know , I forgot what I was talking_about , and it really makes me mad. &quot; He and Reagan &quot; disagreed on a lot of things , &quot; Clinton said , but he praised the former President for his decency . &quot; He always fought with a sense of optimism and spirit , &quot; Clinton said . He added that Reagan had been &quot; willing to put partisanship aside &quot; and help him on issues such_as the North_American Free_Trade Agreement and the Brady Bill limiting handgun sales , which was named after Reagan ' s former press secretary , James Brady . &quot; I want everyone of you in this room now to give Ronald Reagan a hand and wish him Godspeed , &quot; Clinton said . The audience applauded . In Houston , former President George_Bush released a statement saluting Reagan &quot; for his courage and ( for ) sharing this private matter with the American people . Barbara and I are thinking_of our good friends , Ron and Nancy , and we wish them well. &quot; After the announcement was made , former Reagan staff_members began phoning one another . &quot; We were all caught off_guard here , &quot; said Sheila Tate , who was Nancy Reagan ' s press secretary . &quot; We ' re calling each other and feeling sad for him , and for her. &quot; Tate said a friend saw the news on CNN and contacted her at her McLean , Va. , home . Tate immediately turned_on her television . &quot; I saw the handwritten letter , which I thought was incredibly moving and quintessentially Ronald Reagan , &quot; said Tate . In dealing with the disease , she said , Reagan thought_about how he could help other people . &quot; It ' s typical of how he ' s approached his whole life. &quot; During his presidency , Reagan ' s age and health periodically became issues , particularly when he seemed unsure or forgetful . He would shrug_off the concerns with jokes and made_a_point of being photographed while riding_horseback on vacation . He continued to make public statements and appearances after leaving_office six years ago . Last spring he declared himself &quot; pretty steamed &quot; over Iran-Contra figure Oliver L . North ' s comments that Reagan had approved North ' s role in the illegal arms deal . But in recent years he had assumed a lower profile , attending fewer events and declining interviews . He appeared in failing health at last spring ' s funeral of former President Richard Nixon . Reagan ' s physicians -- including Dr. Leslie Weiner of USC and Dr. James R . Blake of St . John ' s Hospital in Santa Monica -- said that although Reagan ' s health is otherwise good , &quot; it is expected that as the years go_on it will begin to deteriorate. &quot; &quot; Unfortunately , at this time , there is no cure for Alzheimer ' s disease and no effective treatment exists that arrests its progression , &quot; the doctors noted , adding that they would have no further comment about Reagan ' s condition . Reagan ' s mother , Nelle , who died at age 77 , also apparently suffered from Alzheimer ' s . Dr. Jeffrey L . Cummings , director of the UCLA Alzheimer ' s Disease Center , said that judging from the coherence of Reagan ' s letter , he appears to be in the early stages of the disease . Cummings said he expected that the announcement would focus attention on Alzheimer ' s disease as news of Earvin ( Magic ) Johnson ' s illness in 1991 did on AIDS . About 4 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer ' s disease , which is characterized by a progressive loss of mental function , including memory and language . About 100 # 000 people die of the disease each year . As_many as 50 % of those over 85 are thought to have Alzheimer ' s , although it can also strike people in their 40s or 50s . The average time from diagnosis to death is generally seven to 10 years , although some may die sooner and some may live as long as 20 years . The disease has three phases . During the first stage , a patient notices some forgetfulness , which can create anxiety or depression . Then , in the second stage , the forgetfulness intensifies into severe memory_loss , particularly short-term_memory . The third stage entails severe confusion and disorientation , with some patients experiencing hallucinations and paranoid delusions . They may become childlike , violent or demanding . At this point , they are often unable to take_care of themselves , needing full-time caretakers or placement in a nursing_home . Alzheimer ' s can be hard to diagnose . Similar symptoms can be caused by a variety of physical diseases , including a tumor , strokes , hypothyroidism , pernicious_anemia or Vitamin B-12 deficiencies . The disorder ' s most distinguishing characteristic is the presence of rock-hard plaques and tangles in the brain , through which a definitive diagnosis can be made after death . Times staff writer David Lauter and wire_services contributed to this story . Reagan ' s Letter Text of letter written by former President Ronald Reagan announcing he has Alzheimer ' s disease : &quot; My Fellow Americans , &quot; I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer ' s Disease . &quot; Upon learning this news , Nancy and I had to decide whether as private citizens we would keep this a private matter or whether we would make this news known in a public way . &quot; In the past Nancy suffered from breast_cancer and I had my cancer surgeries . We found through our open disclosures we were able to raise public awareness . We were happy that as a result many_more people underwent testing . &quot; They were treated in early stages and able to return to normal , healthy lives . &quot; So now , we feel it is important to share it with you . In opening our hearts , we hope this might promote greater awareness of this condition . Perhaps it will encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are affected by it . &quot; At the moment I feel just fine . I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this earth doing the things I have always done . I will continue to share life ' s journey with my beloved Nancy and my family . I plan to enjoy the great outdoors and stay in touch with my friends and supporters . &quot; Unfortunately , as Alzheimer ' s Disease progresses , the family often bears a heavy burden . I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience . When the time comes I am confident that with your help she will face it with faith and courage . &quot; In closing let me thank_you , the American people for giving me the great honor of allowing me to serve as your President . When the Lord calls me home , whenever that may be , I will leave with the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal optimism for its future . &quot; I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life . I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead . &quot; Thank you , my friends . May God always bless you . &quot; Sincerely , Ronald Reagan. &quot;</TEXT>
