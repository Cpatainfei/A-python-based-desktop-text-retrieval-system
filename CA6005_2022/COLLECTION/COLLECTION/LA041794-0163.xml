   <HEADLINE> COLORADO SITE IS NERVE_CENTER FOR MONITORING EARTHQUAKES OF ANY SIZE ; SEISMOLOGY : NATIONAL EARTHQUAKE INFORMATION CENTER DISTRIBUTES QUAKE DATA AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ' TO PREVENT A DISASTER AND SAVE LIVES. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the ground began shaking in California , the phones at the U.S. Geological Survey ' s National Earthquake Information Center started ringing . And they didn ' t stop for eight straight hours . The NEIC is the nerve_center of a computerized nationwide network of seismological sensors that record even the faintest seismic activity -- including trucks rumbling over rough roads and small mine blasts . &quot; We locate all_the significant earthquakes around the world and distribute information about them as quickly as we can to people who have the ability to prevent a disaster and save lives , &quot; said Waverly Person , the center ' s operations manager and the jovial , graying man who routinely appears on network television when big quakes hit . When the 6.8-magnitude Northridge earthquake struck on Jan . 17 , Person was awakened by his pager shortly after 5:30 a.m. Information relayed to his pager indicated a major tremor that had caused extensive damage . Before he could leave his house , &quot; Good_Morning America &quot; called and asked what he knew . &quot; that ' s not unusual , &quot; Persons said . &quot; People often call us and ask_for information before the shock_waves ( which travel at the speed of sound ) reach us. &quot; Person arrived_at the center about 6 a.m. and spent the next seven hours in the control_room , giving interview after interview and update after update . &quot; I started the day at 6:10 a.m. and went_home at 2 o ' clock the next morning , &quot; he said . &quot; And I was back by 5 a.m. because they wanted me to go live_on the ' Today ' show. &quot; Asked about the big 5.3 aftershock in California in late March , Person said , &quot; People were very , very excited and it frightened a lot of people . It did cause some significant damage , but I think the main effect was it scared people . &quot; Many scientists expected that an aftershock of that magnitude could occur . But many of the people in California felt that since they had gone so_long without getting an aftershock , it wasn ' t going_to happen again. &quot; Person , 60 , says he is no celebrity , but he does consider himself a pioneer and role_model . &quot; I ' m more or less a pioneer as an African-American in this field , &quot; he said . &quot; There may have been one or two before me , but I ' m the first I know to come this far . I get more requests for interviews than I can handle , most from predominantly black magazines who are looking_for role models. &quot; The National Earthquake Information Center was founded by the U.S. Department_of_Commerce in 1966 and was based in Rockville , Md . The center moved to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration facility in Boulder , Colo. , in 1972 . After the center was moved to the U.S. Department_of_the_Interior , it relocated to the Colorado School of Mines campus in 1973 . Gathering earthquake information in those early years was difficult because there were few seismic sensors to provide data . Technological advances have made the task simpler . A bank of computers in the center ' s basement constantly monitors a network of 130 seismic sensors across the country , automatically issuing a detailed report on every seismological incident that might be interpreted as an earthquake . The report includes information on the earthquake ' s date , time and location ; its magnitude , epicenter and proximity to key population centers , and a list of local emergency preparedness officials to contact and their phone_numbers . The system also automatically rings_up pagers worn by every center employee and by certain local officials -- such_as railroad routing centers and dam maintenance and monitoring officials . &quot; In 1992 we located 19 # 540 earthquakes worldwide , between 1 and 8 on the Richter scale , &quot; Person said . &quot; In 1993 , we ' re going to have more -- about 20 # 000 . that ' s not because our technology is getting better at detecting them. &quot; Last year , there were just more earthquakes . The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs . Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude . Thus , a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. When an earthquake hits , the center ' s 22-person staff swings into action , alerting the proper authorities , verifying and updating computer reports and using every means possible -- including television and radio interviews , telephone_calls , fax machines and telegrams -- to get the word out . Usually within minutes after a major earthquake is reported , Denver-area television_news crews are in the center ' s control_room , lined with rotating drums that display seismic activity from sensors across the nation . That is when Waverly Person takes center stage . &quot; Waverly may be the most important_person we have here in terms of getting_out information that people can understand , &quot; said John Filson , the center ' s branch manager . &quot; I ' ve got a Ph.D. and I just can ' t seem to get the point across with the cameras rolling . I ' m really happy we ' ve got Waverly here. &quot; Besides disseminating information about earthquakes that have just occurred , the center also compiles and publishes information about earthquakes and seismic activity . &quot; Our historical database is second to none from 1900 to the present . And it ' s updated every week , &quot; Person said . He said the center ' s database is tapped often by builders who want to know an area ' s seismological history . Despite all_the data available , Person said it still is not possible to predict earthquakes or to identify trends . &quot; You can ' t predict earthquakes . Period , &quot; he said . &quot; We have psychics call_in all_the time who tell us , ' There ' s going_to be an earthquake in California. ' But that ' s not really a prediction . You have to know magnitude and location , and so far that hasn ' t been done. &quot;</TEXT>
