   <HEADLINE> AS SCIENTIFIC PUZZLE UNRAVELS , A LEGAL ISSUE TANGLES MORE ; NEW GENETIC FINDINGS POSE RISING PROBLEMS IN AREA OF PATENTS AND BUSINESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The early discoverers of and experimenters with electricity could hardly have imagined how their work would ultimately transform the world . A similar technological upheaval awaits us now as private business starts to exploit the revolution in molecular_biology to bring new cures , therapies and we-know-not-what . Just four decades after James D . Watson and Francis H . C . Crick solved the central mystery of inheritance with their discovery of the double helix structure of DNA , the genetic material , investors are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that see potential profits where Watson and Crick saw only basic science . Few disagree that this science is now ripe for use , to the potential benefit of all humankind . But the rules of the game have yet to be drawn . For patenting and controlling the human genome and its parts present special problems without good precedent in law , a situation that has left both government and industry confused and divided . Four years ago the federal_government launched the Human Genome Project , a costly long-term plan to chart and catalogue the entire human genetic_endowment . Only about 5 % of each person ' s DNA is used in the actual genes that result in expressed traits , such eye color ; the purpose of the rest of the DNA is still unknown . One of the researchers in the project , J . Craig Venter , then with the National Institutes of Health , devised a short cut . He went_to the heart of the_matter and began to focus_on just the crucial 5 % . Now new robotic machines in government and industry are busily deciphering the exact sequence of chemicals of thousands of these gene segments . Their specific genetic tasks are mostly still uncertain . In 1991 , the NIH stirred a scientific tempest by filing applications for patents on 6 # 869 of Venter ' s sequences . This was done as part of the Bush_Administration ' s and Congress ' commitment to &quot; technology transfer &quot; of government-supported basic research into commercial applications . The theory was that patents would allow the government to bring a more orderly licensing of discoveries than if the work were just thrown into the public_domain . Enraged at the notion that the genome project ' s results might not be available to all scientists , Watson quit as its director . The Patent and Trademark Office rejected the applications on the ground that the required utility of the sequences had not been demonstrated . Before the issue could be appealed_to federal_court , however , the Clinton_Administration on Feb . 11 withdrew the applications as &quot; not in the best interest of the public or science. &quot; But now several private companies have revved_up their own gene-sequencing machines and are applying for patents . These include Human Genome Sciences Inc. ( HGS ) of Rockville , Md. , with which Venter is now connected , and Incyte of Palo Alto , Calif . Full genes whose function is known have been granted patents , and all agree that concrete end_products of genetic_engineering , such_as drugs , are also patentable . But the partial sequences whose utility is uncertain present difficult problems . Leaders of companies like HGS say they need patent protection or they will have to keep their work secret , even from basic researchers . They say the sequences do have utility , to wit HGS ' crucial role in helping medical researchers at Johns Hopkins University discover a gene for colon_cancer . Others fear that patents will impede basic research and say the gene sequences should be public_property , a kind of basic common alphabet available to all . The biotechnology industry is divided ; everyone seems to want strong patents , except when the patents belong_to someone else . The issue piles layer upon layer of scientific , legal and ethical uncertainty and complexity . Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) has requested an analysis from the congressional Office of Technology Assessment . It may be that Congress -- in collaboration with Britain , France , Japan and other major research countries -- must write new patent or copyright law to guide us through the biological revolution .</TEXT>
