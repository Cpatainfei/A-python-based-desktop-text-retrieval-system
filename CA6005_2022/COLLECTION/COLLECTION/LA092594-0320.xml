   <HEADLINE> DETECTIVES INVESTIGATING 16 COMPLAINTS AT WILMINGTON CEMETERY ; SCANDAL : A FORMER CARETAKER IS THE CENTER OF A PROBE OF THE GRAVEYARD , WHICH IS PLAGUED BY ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPER BURIALS AND LACK OF DEEDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Betty Shanklin kneels beside the grave of her father in Wilmington Cemetery , the anguish over his death last December is heightened by months of frustrating dealings with the cemetery ' s operators . The grave of Cleophos Gordon , who died at the age of 89 after living_in the harbor area for 50 years , remains unmarked despite the $ 250 Shanklin paid_for a headstone that was supposed to be erected by May 5 . Shanklin is not even sure that her father ' s body is buried legally because she still has not received a deed for the plots sold to her nine months ago . &quot; This is about respect , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s taken everything out of me . My father worked too long and hard to say he can ' t have a headstone. &quot; Shanklin is not the only person despairing over burials at the publicly owned , 137-year-old Wilmington Cemetery . The Los Angeles Police_Department ' s Harbor Division is investigating 16 complaints that a caretaker at the cemetery accepted money from grieving families in exchange for plots and headstones that do not exist or have not been delivered . No charges have yet been filed against the caretaker , Je-Rome Poland , who was fired this summer after nearly three years at the facility , officials of the Wilmington Cemetery District said . But Detective Robert Contreras said the case will be turned_over to county prosecutors next month for consideration of grand theft charges . Dade Albright , the cemetery district ' s president , said Poland was contracted_in October , 1991 , to do landscaping and handle burials at the cemetery . But he soon expanded his role -- without the board ' s knowledge -- to sell plots and headstones from an office at the cemetery and later from an office on Avalon Boulevard , Albright said . &quot; People were asking questions and we started checking it out , &quot; he said . &quot; We dismissed his services in July. &quot; Poland , who is working in the Pomona area , said he has been in recent contact with the LAPD and the cemetery board . &quot; My intention is to work with the board and resolve who owns what , and to work with the families to resolve the_matters , whatever they are , as soon as possible , &quot; he said . He declined to comment further . * Contreras said new complaints are being received by police almost every day . &quot; Some of ( the victims ) are out $ 300 , some are out thousands of dollars , &quot; the detective said . He declined to specify how much Poland had received , but estimated the sum at tens of thousands of dollars . The State Cemetery Board , which oversees maintenance funds and audits the trusts of California ' s crematories and nearly 200 privately owned cemeteries , has no jurisdiction over the public Wilmington Cemetery . But the board is about to hand_over to prosecutors the results of its own investigation into similar complaints about Poland at the Sunnyside Cemetery in Long_Beach , according to Executive_Director Raymond Giunta . Poland owned that cemetery for a_few days in June before selling it to the state when he could not meet license requirements for a financial plan , Giunta said . Wilmington Cemetery has been at the center of controversy at least since 1991 , when 12 families filed suits against the cemetery district , the board of trustees and a former caretaker , alleging improper burials . The case is scheduled to go_to trial Oct . 24 . Poland was also a defendant in the civil action for allegedly reinterring bodies without relatives ' written consent , but that part of the case was recently settled , according to Scott E . Schutzman , the attorney representing 11 of the families . Schutzman said Poland discovered that 190 caskets were buried only inches deep by the previous caretaker , so he had them reburied deeper . &quot; We settled with Je-Rome because whatever acts he did go_back to the cemetery district , &quot; he said . &quot; They told him what to do. &quot; But Albright said the cemetery district will not accept responsibility for Poland ' s actions because he was an independent contractor . The board has filed its own complaint with police over the former caretaker ' s practices , he said . Shanklin , who bought four plots for $ 1 # 450 , said she now believes only one grave exists -- and laments her decision to bury her father at the cemetery . &quot; Poland came_to my home and he picked_up the cashier ' s check . I had it made_out to Wilmington Cemetery , but he said the check had to be to Down to Earth Maintenance ( Poland ' s company ) , &quot; she said . &quot; I would never suspect that someone would be doing that to you when you ' re going through ( a death ) . &quot;</TEXT>
