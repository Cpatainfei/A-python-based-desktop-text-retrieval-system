   <HEADLINE> COURT HEARS CASE PIVOTAL TO DNA TESTS ; CRIME : JUDGES WEIGH ARGUMENTS IN HUNTINGTON BEACH DRUNK-DRIVING ARREST . THEY CONSIDER USE OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT COULD AFFECT SIMPSON TRIAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a case that could affect the admissibility of DNA evidence in the O.J. Simpson trial , the California Supreme Court began deliberating Tuesday whether to give trial_judges greater flexibility to allow scientific evidence at trial . The high_court , hearing arguments in a Huntington Beach drunk-driving case , has been asked by California Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren to broaden the state ' s evidence rules to allow controversial DNA testing . Now , scientific evidence can be admitted if it is generally accepted by the scientific community . Members of the court provided little insight into their thinking on the DNA issue , dwelling largely on questions about a common field sobriety test in which police_officers check the eye movements of suspected drunk drivers . The drunk driving case comes_before the court on the heels of a U.S. Supreme Court decision adopting the broad standard advocated by Lungren that would give trial_judges more discretion in_using scientific evidence . But some prosecutors -- as well as public_defenders and corporate defense_attorneys -- worry that such a standard would open the door for all kinds of &quot; junk science &quot; that could be difficult for trial_judges to sort_out . &quot; There ' s absolutely no need to put trial_judges in the position of being scientists , &quot; said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist . Atty . Brentford Ferreira , who joined Orange County prosecutors in arguing the Huntington Beach case before the Supreme Court . The case before the court stems from the December , 1990 , arrest of William Michael Leahy for allegedly speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol on Pacific Coast Highway . According to evidence presented at his trial in Orange County Municipal Court , Leahy smelled of alcohol and spoke with difficulty when pulled over . Leahy passed some sobriety tests administered by the arresting officer , including walking in a straight_line and standing on one leg . But he failed a test called the horizontal gaze nystagmus test , in which an officer observes whether the eye moves smoothly as it tracks an object , such_as a pencil . A blood_test 90 minutes later showed Leahy ' s blood alcohol to be 0.1 % , which exceeds the legal limit , but his attorney argued that the level rose after the arrest because of a drink the motorist had five minutes before the arrested . Leahy was found guilty at trial but his conviction was overturned by the state Court of Appeal in Santa Ana . That court held that the vision test is scientific evidence and , under California rules , cannot be admitted until a hearing is held to determine whether the procedure is generally accepted in the scientific community . In agreeing to hear the case , the state Supreme Court asked attorneys to offer arguments on whether the new federal standard for scientific evidence -- known as Daubert , after the U.S. Supreme Court case -- should be adopted in place of the state standard . In the Daubert case , the U.S. Supreme Court threw_out the old standard of general acceptance by the scientific community and ruled that federal judges must only conclude whether scientific evidence is &quot; relevant &quot; and &quot; reliable. &quot; Orange County Dist . Atty . Michael R . Capizzi and Orange County Public_Defender Ronald Butler argued that the state ' s rules , known by the shorthand Kelly-Frye , should remain in place and attempted to focus the case on the field sobriety test . &quot; This is not a DNA case , &quot; Deputy Public_Defender Alan J . Crivaro told the court . However , Lungren and the California District_Attorneys Assn . filed amicus briefs with the court seeking adoption of the Daubert standard , which would be more likely to allow DNA evidence in criminal cases . California appellate_courts have issued mixed opinions on whether DNA tests are acceptable . One recent appellate ruling rejected the use of DNA evidence because techniques used by laboratories to come_up with statistical estimates are not generally accepted by the scientific community . The state Supreme Court let that decision stand . With the murder trial of O.J. Simpson scheduled to start in less than three weeks , Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito will be called_on to decide whether DNA tests on blood found at the murder scene will be accepted into evidence . * The Supreme Court has 90 days to rule_in Leahy ' s case , and any decision to broaden the rules for scientific evidence could come_after Ito has ruled on the admissibility of the DNA tests , complicating appeals on the issue . The state high_court ' s decision would be binding on state judges such_as the one presiding over the Simpson case . Admissibility of DNA evidence is crucial to the prosecution , which , lacking eyewitnesses , needs the testing to show that Simpson was at the scene of the crime . Orange County Deputy Dist . Atty . Dennis Bauer said he hopes that once the Supreme Court establishes a standard state courts will use to determine the admissibility of scientific evidence , that it will apply that standard to a case involving DNA . &quot; We want them to get past this issue and get_to DNA , &quot; he said . Because of conflicting state appellate decisions on DNA , he said , Orange County prosecutors and defense_attorneys have put_on extensive arguments , including testimony from scientific experts , in each instance DNA has been crucial to a suspect ' s identification . Bauer said local prosecutors have had success at convincing judges of the value of DNA identifications -- but at great effort and expense . &quot; We have had 15 or 16 different cases in which we have had DNA admitted as evidence over the objection of the defense , &quot; he said . Although not giving any indication whether they would tackle the DNA issue in their ruling in the Leahy case , some justices questioned the use of the 30-year-old field sobriety vision test . &quot; There seems to be a lot of science here , &quot; said Justice Armand Arabian . &quot; It might even be junk science. &quot; Times staff writer Leslie Berkman contributed to this report .</TEXT>
