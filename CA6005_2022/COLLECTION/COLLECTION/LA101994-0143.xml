   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : CLIPPERS ARE BETTER THAN EMPTY POND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You force Orange County ' s sporting customers to go without their hockey for three weeks -- no Mighty Ducks , cold turkey -- and you have to presume they are going_to be bored . But this bored ? A Clipper franchise record 18 # 052 turned_out at The Pond Tuesday night to watch a loosely defined &quot; exhibition of professional_basketball &quot; against the Lakers . Repeat : A franchise record . that ' s 25 years of basketball , usually extremely wretched basketball . The Clippers never drew 18 # 052 in Buffalo . Never in San Diego . Never in Los Angeles . In Los Angeles , a turnstile count of 18 # 052 represents a pretty fair three-game home stand . But in Orange County , they flood the freeways , jam the parking_lot and pay through the nose for this stuff , proving a theory I have long held about the magical , mystical , magnetic Pond of Anaheim . Open the doors , turn_on the lights , flash a_few words on the marquee -- &quot; TONIGHT : HUMANS BREATHING HARD , 7:30 , &quot; for instance -- and the place will be filled to the brim . Or schedule nothing at all . Or schedule the Clippers . Virtually one_and_the_same . Never before have so many spent so_much to witness so little . The Clippers , playing host here as part of Orange County ' s rent-an-NBA-orphan program , lost to the Lakers , 120-104 , but the score might as well have been 220-104 . The Clippers were never in the game , never had a chance , never pushed the opposition into breaking_into a sweat , so in this regard , new head coach / poor , poor soul Bill Fitch has his charges in midseason form . &quot; You have one of these nights from time to time , &quot; Fitch said after following the bouncing ball clank off The Pond backboards , sail into The Pond seats and careen off Clipper fingers . &quot; And , boy , we had one tonight. &quot; For the Clippers , one of those nights included doling out 19 minutes to Tony Massenburg , 20 to Charles Outlaw , 23 to Harold Ellis , 12 to Keith Smart and 10 to Orlando Vega . They did not make the most of them . &quot; I ' d hate to gauge the whole season on one exhibition_game , but , on the other side , we got_to play a lot of people , &quot; Fitch noted , grasping for a straw , any straw . &quot; These guys have been working hard in practice . They paid_for the opportunity in camp . So we got them in there and now we have a better idea of what to do when we have to cut_down to 12. &quot; Is it possible to cut an entire franchise ? Bright spots for the Clippers ? Fitch scratched his head and said he thought it was good to get Massenburg , a 6-9 forward from Maryland via F.C. Barcelona -- not the soccer team , presumably -- some playing time . &quot; He ' s missed most of camp , so it was good to put him out there for the conditioning , &quot; Fitch said . And Eric Piatkowski , the rookie swingman acquired from Indiana in the Pooh Richardson trade , made his NBA debut after signing Friday . &quot; He nailed his first shot , &quot; Fitch chirped . &quot; that ' s another good sign. &quot; Elmore Spencer also played . This was notable in that Spencer walked_out_of camp Monday afternoon . Quite literally . Spencer walked_off the Bren Center floor in mid-workout , changed clothes and kept walking , all_the way to the team hotel , about a three-mile stroll . For several hours , the Clippers considered Spencer AWOL . Not a good thing for a team already down one center , Stanley Roberts , currently sidelined with a sprained waistline . Eventually , Spencer showed_up , but Fitch kept him out of the starting lineup Tuesday night . On most teams , this is considered a disciplinary measure , but on the Clippers , this is known as a lucky break . Instead , Fitch started Bob Martin at center . He had four points and one rebound in 13 minutes . Then he sent_in Robert Werdann . Then Matt Fish . Then , he ' d seen enough , so Spencer was finally told to take_off the warm-ups . &quot; His minutes were planned , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; When you punish somebody , you don ' t want to overdo it . You just want to make_sure it doesn ' t happen again . &quot; Believe me , he won ' t do_it again. &quot; Unfortunately , the Clippers are scheduled to do_it again here six more times , all_of them counting in the regular-season standings . It keeps the place busy , I suppose , but if The Pond needs some suggestions on what do with itself during the NHL lockout , here ' s a partial list of things to try : 1 . Roller hockey . 2 . Indoor soccer . 3 . Roller disco . 4 . Indoor plumbing . 5 . Arena football . 6 . Arena foosball . 7 . Barbra Streisand concerts . 8 . Rolling Stones concerts . 9 . Sons of the Rolling Stones concerts . 10 . Barney ( the Forum Blue Dinosaur ) concerts . 11 . Tractor pulls . 12 . Taffy pulls . 13 . American Gladiators . 14 . Roller baseball . 15 . Miniature_golf . 16 . Mater Dei basketball . 17 . Mater Dei volleyball . 18 . Closed-circuit broadcasts of Phoenix Suns and Orlando Magic games . That way they can bill it , in good conscience , as &quot; NBA basketball. &quot; 19 . Save The Rams spirit rallies . 20 . Clippers Go_Home spirit rallies . You wanted basketball , you got_it . Too late to throw it back now .</TEXT>
