   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; LATINA WRITERS ARE SILENT NO LONGER ; FRESH , FRANK VOICES ARE FUELING A SURPRISING LITERARY BOOM IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH_AMERICA AFTER CENTURIES OF MACHO-MINDED REJECTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Ana Pizarro returned to Chile in 1991 after 17 years in exile , she offered the manuscript of a novel to a local publishing_house , which rejected it . Pizarro , 53 , was discouraged but not surprised . As a scholar of Latin_American literature , she knew that innumerable women writers in this region had been silenced for centuries by macho-minded prejudice and rejection . But through a friend ' s contacts with another publisher , Pizarro ' s &quot; The Moon , the Wind , the Year , the Day &quot; finally was printed last June . Then , much to her surprise , the Sunday book section of the conservative El Mercurio , Chile ' s most influential newspaper , splashed the author and her novel on its cover . Now , the publisher tells Pizarro that her book is selling well -- just one sign among many of a growing trend in Latin_America , where women authors are enjoying unprecedented success . &quot; There is an opening for feminine writing , &quot; Pizarro said in an interview . &quot; I believe the field is opening_up more and more. &quot; Books by Latin_American women have become international bestsellers , in what some critics are calling a new boom . It is reminiscent_of Latin_America ' s celebrated -- all-male -- literary explosion in the 1960s when luminaries such_as Gabriel Garcia Marquez of Colombia , Carlos Fuentes of Mexico and Mario Vargas Llosa of Peru attracted international recognition . The region ' s latest crop of big-name writers is headed by a Chilean , Isabel Allende , whose books , including the novel &quot; The House of the Spirits , &quot; have sold more_than 10 million copies worldwide . Literary scholars , while reluctant to belittle Allende ' s knack for telling a popular story , say privately that other women in Latin_America are producing richer , more literary material ; many of these also are achieving the big sales and critical acclaim once reserved almost exclusively for men . Because books are expensive in Latin_America and education levels generally are low , writers of either gender still lack the mass readership that many authors enjoy in the United States . But economic development , population growth and rising education levels have expanded the market for books , creating openings for new writers . Meanwhile , gender bias has been breaking_down throughout Latin_America . Women have more opportunities for education , career success and intellectual freedom . This has translated into a larger public of women readers with greater interest in serious feminine literature . It also has meant that more men are discarding prejudices against reading what women write . &quot; There are scads of women emerging at this moment , at least in Chile and apparently in Mexico and Argentina also , &quot; said Beatriz Berger , editor of El Mercurio ' s book section . Growing numbers of Latin_American women are being published outside their own countries , including in the United States . ( Some finance their writing careers by teaching at American universities ; a_few , including Allende , have married Americans. ) &quot; Some of them have leverage with American publishers , and they are the ones that get the attention , but there are hundreds more good women writers out there , &quot; said Kirsten Nigro , a professor of Romance_languages at the University of Cincinnati . Many others are little known abroad but are changing the face of literature in their home countries . &quot; One of the most original things being produced in Latin_America is women ' s voices , &quot; said Marjorie Agosin , a Chilean poet and professor of Latin_American literature at Wellesley College in Massachusetts . Much of the new writing reveals refreshing -- sometimes even shocking -- frankness by women on society , politics , sex and other subjects . &quot; It ' s women talking_about themselves in a very open way , very transparent , very daring , &quot; Agosin said in a telephone_interview . &quot; Before , women never spoke about how they felt , they never spoke about their sexuality . They censored themselves . It ' s new in the sense that women are doing_it with great openness. &quot; Claudia Ferman , an Argentine who teaches Latin_American literature at the University of Richmond in Virginia , called the trend a Pandora ' s box : &quot; You open it , and the most unexpected things come_out , because this is the classic phenomenon of when someone is silenced , then there are many things in fermentation . And that , it seems to me , is what is attracting the public . . . that novelty of vision. &quot; For example , women ' s erotic poetry is breaking ground in Caribbean Basin countries . In other parts of the region , women ' s poetic expression is invading the traditional territory of narrative writing &quot; so there is a kind of very lyric narrative , &quot; Ferman said . &quot; What we are seeing is that , when women start writing massively , they change not only what is said , but the genre it is said in. &quot; When experts are asked who are the best women writers in Latin_America today , the most-mentioned names include novelists Elena Poniatowska of Mexico , Diamela Eltit of Chile and Cristina Peri Rossi of Uruguay . Poniatowska ' s novels &quot; Here ' s Looking_at You , Jesus &quot; and &quot; Tinisima &quot; are &quot; testimonial narratives &quot; that look_at history through the eyes of women who lived it . The avant-garde Eltit challenges conventional thinking with stories about misfits , rebels and others on society ' s fringe . Peri Rossi , who lives_in Spain , deals with the confused sexual and national identities of the exiled characters in her best-known novel , &quot; The Ship of Fools. &quot; Dozens of other women have well-established reputations , and scores more are seen as promising new talents . David Geis , head of the Spanish and Portuguese department at the University of Virginia , is especially enthusiastic about Mexican novelist Maria Luisa Puga . He said her works are &quot; powerful and lyrical , &quot; exploring the condition of women in developing countries with critical realism . Until the last decade or two , women in Latin_America did not have opportunities that men did &quot; to make a life in_writing , to think they could be writers , &quot; Geis said . A few exceptional women did break_through . Chile ' s Gabriela Mistral won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1945 with her earthy , maternal-voiced poetry , and Brazilian Clarice Lispector ' s reflective novels and short_stories are ripe with provocative ambiguity . But only since the early 1980s have greater numbers of Latinas gained broader access to publishing circles , to the press and to the literary Establishment . &quot; They ' ve broken_in , &quot; Geis said . &quot; I think we ' ve pretty much eliminated the macho mind-set , and we are all richer for it. &quot; Publishers are richer too . Carlos Orellana , editor in Chile of the international publishing_firm Editorial Planeta , observed : &quot; Really , there is a pretty spectacular apogee in Latin_America , from the point_of_view that today the best-selling authors -- Garcia Marquez aside -- are women. &quot; The biggest blockbuster has been Allende ' s &quot; The House of the Spirits , &quot; followed by Mexican Laura Esquivel ' s first novel , &quot; Like Water for Chocolate. &quot; Both dramatize Latin_American cultural virtues and vices with storytelling virtuosity and enticing touches of magic_realism -- or &quot; magic feminism. &quot; Orellana said their huge success has helped pave the way for others . &quot; It contributes to knocking_down complexes and prejudices -- in women writers , who dare to do more now , as well as in publishers who could have misgivings about the commercial possibilities of publishing women , &quot; he said . Pizarro , a researcher in culture at Santiago University , said that since the 1970s , women ' s fiction in Latin_America has become more daring , while maintaining a female identity . &quot; It is a writing that has great aesthetic quality and speaks from another place , a place where sensitivities are different , where the relationship with reality is a little different from what we are used to in fundamentally masculine writing , &quot; she said . Many women , such_as novelist and poet Carmen Bullosa of Mexico , have developed artful ways of interpreting history through elaborate symbolism , she added . They are &quot; taking_on history , and in a new way , &quot; she said . &quot; It is a de-solemnized history -- open , playful. &quot; In her novel &quot; Llanto &quot; ( Crying ) , Bullosa jokingly questions conventional versions of Mexican history , examining it through the eyes of the Aztec emperor Montezuma . Traditionally , interpretation of such &quot; serious &quot; subjects in Latin_American literature had largely been left to men . Women writers were around but went unnoticed , Pizarro said . &quot; They didn ' t have a tribune . And because they didn ' t have a tribune , they couldn ' t advance in their aesthetic projects , because the only way to advance is to publish. &quot; Then came the political and ideological ebullience of the 1960s , when revolutionary movements and social activism spread through the region . &quot; There was a great process in Latin_America of affirmation of identities , &quot; Pizarro said . &quot; Starting from that time , the voice of the woman begins to emerge in the rest of the countries of the continent. &quot; Pizarro earned a doctorate in literature at France ' s Sorbonne in 1968 , then became a professor at Chile ' s University of Concepcion , a hotbed of social and political activism . Like thousands of other leftists , she went_into exile in 1973 after a right-wing military coup harnessed Chile with a harshly repressive regime . In the 1970s and 1980s , when much of Latin_America was ruled by military governments , women also played an important role in resisting dictatorships and pushing for democracy . &quot; Men give them a place , because they need women in those struggles , &quot; said Ferman of the University of Richmond . She said a feminist_movement and more assertive writing by women have sprung from those political origins . &quot; They have acquired permission , they have permitted themselves to move ahead , to have a voice , &quot; she said . &quot; They begin to understand that they were silenced. &quot; The progressive return to democracy throughout Latin_America since the early 1980s has permitted more open discussion , and that has further contributed to the surge in women ' s literature . The struggle for literary equality has been a long one in Latin_America . Sister Juana Ines de la Cruz , a Roman_Catholic nun in 16th-Century Mexico , ran_up against a wall of church censorship with her writing . Sister Juana is_best known for her penetrating poetry , such_as &quot; First Dream , &quot; a metaphorical interpretation of dreaming and awakening . From the 1920s through the 1950s , pioneers included Maria Luisa Bombal of Chile , who wrote subjective , stream-of-consciousness novels about women in reclusion , and Rosario Castellanos of Mexico , whose novels and short_stories described native life and racial discrimination in the southern state of Chiapas . While women authors have come a long way in Latin_America , they continue to lag behind their American and European sisters . Silvia Pellarolo , a professor of Hispanic literature at UCLA , said many continue to go unnoticed because what they have to say is &quot; not very appealing to a wider audience or to the owners of the publishing_houses , who are usually men. &quot; &quot; What we ' re seeing is just the tip of the iceberg , and there are many , many , many other women ' s voices that are completely ignored , &quot; Pellarolo said .</TEXT>
