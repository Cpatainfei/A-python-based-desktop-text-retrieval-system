   <HEADLINE> CLINTON TAKES SHOT AT CRITICS OF HIS HEALTH PLAN ; REFORM : HE TELLS AUTO WORKERS THAT TALK OF A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF INSURANCE SYSTEM IS WRONG . HE SAYS MEDICAL COSTS WILL RISE WITHOUT HIS PACKAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taking_on his health_care critics before an audience of friendly auto workers , President Clinton warned Tuesday that the slowed growth in medical costs will &quot; go right back_up again &quot; if the country does not follow General Motors ' lead in supporting his reform plan . Clinton , speaking at a Chevrolet light truck assembly_plant here , told auto workers not to believe business groups and insurance_companies that contend his plan would bring_about a government takeover of the health_care system . &quot; It ' s not true , &quot; he said . &quot; What the President wants to do is to keep the system we ' ve got now and give it to everybody : guaranteed private health_insurance , private doctors , private providers -- a private system. &quot; Without naming names , Clinton took a shot at the Health_Insurance Assn . of America -- which represents the interests of smaller insurers -- for its latest round of advertisements attacking his health plan . Clinton said he was &quot; tickled &quot; by the HIAA ' s commercials . &quot; I read these ads of these folks that are so desperate to keep the system we have now . And they say : ' Oh , the President wants to have the government take_over the health_care system. ' It isn ' t true. &quot; In a reference_to insurers ' financial resources and political savvy , Clinton added : &quot; Look , I know there ' s a lot of money in this . And there are a lot of good people who work for those companies . But you just have to ask yourself whether we can afford to continue to spend 40 % more_than ( other countries ) and not cover everybody. &quot; Clinton also criticized a health reform plan by Rep . Jim Cooper ( D-Tenn. ) that has emerged as the leading alternative to the Administration ' s initiative . Cooper ' s proposal promises &quot; universal access &quot; to health_insurance , but would not guarantee coverage for all Americans . &quot; There ' s universal access to this truck , &quot; Clinton said , pointing to a vehicle behind him . &quot; But only people with money can pay ( for ) it. &quot; In stressing the need for universal coverage , Clinton told of a woman who had written him about her husband , who developed lung_cancer but was denied treatment because he had no health_insurance . &quot; They would n ' t even treat him , and he died in five weeks , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; Our approach completely outlaws insurance discrimination . . . . Our plan reduces the control of the insurance_companies and gives more input to workers and to business. &quot; And he told of a Shreveport woman , an employee of an insurance_company , who suffered a brain aneurysm . Even when her doctors told her she was &quot; totally healed , &quot; she couldn ' t find new insurance . &quot; There are people like that all_over the country , &quot; Clinton said . Clinton said that medical inflation &quot; goes_down every time there ' s a serious threat to reform the health_care system. &quot; But if his bill is rejected , he said , &quot; it will go right back_up again , just like it has every time in the last 50 years. &quot; Clinton ' s remarks Tuesday came as the White_House is struggling to overcome a series of setbacks in its health_care reform crusade . Last week , the National Assn . of Manufacturers , the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce all declined to endorse the Clinton plan . On Tuesday , the Congressional Budget Office ruled that insurance_premiums paid by workers and their employers would have to be included in the federal budget under Clinton ' s plan . The White_House contends that these setbacks are temporary , and that it will find a way around the CBO ' s findings . Clinton ' s comments before the crowd of about 2 # 000 were beamed live to other auto workers around the country . The receptive audience was assembled by one of the few companies that still supports the President ' s plan . A key reason for GM ' s support is the plan ' s provision to pick_up 80 % of the health_insurance costs of workers who retire between the ages of 55 and 64 . The auto_makers and other old-line manufacturers have large_numbers of such workers , many of whom could be offered early retirement buyouts as companies continue to trim their payrolls . Clinton mentioned the early retirement provision of his plan , arguing that it would make U.S. companies able to better compete with firms overseas . &quot; Our approach protects the early retirees and finds a way to help companies pay_for it to spread the cost of that , to make General Motors , our steel_companies , a lot of our other companies far more competitive , &quot; Clinton said . He praised GM ' s executives and union officials as &quot; enlightened business leaders. &quot;</TEXT>
