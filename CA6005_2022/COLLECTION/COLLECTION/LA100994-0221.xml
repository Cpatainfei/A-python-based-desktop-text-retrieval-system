   <HEADLINE> WHAT U.S. CONGRESS SHOULD DO TO KEEP OUR STREETS SAFE ; CLOSE PROCEDURAL LOOPHOLES IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ABOLISH PAROLE . IF NECESSARY , BRING IN THE ARMED FORCES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The most fundamental duty of any responsible government is public safety . No society can prosper , no business can operate without a basic level of personal security . In too many neighborhoods , however , people are trapped behind locked gates and afraid to open the front_door . Middle-class residents of the San Fernando Valley and their children should not have to live like this . I do not view poverty and social inequality as legitimate causes of criminal behavior , although we should certainly work to reduce such conditions . Poor people too know the difference between right and wrong and should be held to it . The best preventive program is not midnight basketball ( which merely means your house may now be burgled at 2 a.m. ) but a proper family , good values and a stake in the community through neighborhood schools and homeownership . I am sorry_for the maladjusted youth who is now a criminal . But my first concern is for the safety of law-abiding citizens . My wife should be able to drive to the market without worrying about her safety . My daughter should be able to go_to school and focus_on her education . I propose specific steps we can and should take_to combat crime : * Abolish parole . We should simply abolish parole and time_off for good behavior ( criminals are in jail because of their bad behavior ) . Keeping criminals in jail may be expensive , but letting them out causes even more damage . A huge proportion of crimes are committed by a small group of repeat offenders who should be kept locked_up . Sometimes &quot; three strikes &quot; may be too many if the second or third strike might be you or your family . * Address juvenile crime . Juveniles should be treated like adults if they commit adult crimes . It is also high_time we fought gangs as what they are -- organized crime -- with much greater cooperation between local law_enforcement and federalagencies . To reduce juvenile crime in the first place , we need welfare reform and a renewed stress on teaching children right from wrong and responsibility for individual behavior . Just as we must reform the criminal justice system to discipline , we must reform the social and school_systems to instill values . * Reform criminal_law . Federal law should be changed so that convicted murderers and other criminals can no longer block justice with endless appeals and delays . There is something fundamentally wrong with a system that excuses the Menendez brothers and turns the O . J . Simpson case into a circus . We need to focus_on the search for truth , not procedural technicalities or bogus psychological arguments . * Make national security assets available to fight crime . We Americans spend $ 263 billion a year on national security , including equipment , computers and military_police . Let ' s make some of those resources available to local law_enforcement authorities if they want them . Before we send the Army to disarm bandits in Somalia and Haiti , maybe we ought to do the same here . * Stop illegal immigration . A quarter of California ' s violent felons are illegal aliens . Although my opponent , Anthony Beilenson , is now claiming credit for the provision in the recent crime bill to reimburse California for their costs , the proposal came from me in the governor ' s office , and Beilenson gave it away by agreeing to delay reimbursement until the year 2004 . In fact , he recently introduced legislation calling_for sensitivity training for the Border_Patrol and voted against a tracking system for illegal alien felons and requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote . Unfortunately , the &quot; crime bill &quot; just passed in Congress will make none of these needed changes . The &quot; 100 # 000 police &quot; the bill promises to put_on the street are a fiction , since the federal funding is only a 20 % matching grant . The bill ' s greatest failure is its refusal to impose real gun_control -- mandatory minimum sentences for the use of a gun in a crime . My opponent voted against it at_the_same_time he was voting for the use of racial quotas in the death_penalty . In fact , our congressman voted against every meaningful amendment to the crime bill that would have given it real teeth , including the death_penalty for murders committed during a sexual_assault and increased sentences for assaults on the elderly . Contrary to what he is now telling us , the incumbent has a long record of being soft_on crime . He opposes the death_penalty , supported Rose Bird and according to the Los Angeles Times &quot; consistently gets good reviews from such left-leaning groups as . . . the ACLU. &quot; By contrast , I campaigned against Rose Bird , have sought vigorous and fair enforcement of the death_penalty and have a long record of advocating tougher controls on crime . As a result I have been endorsed by Sheriff Sherman Block , the California State Police , the California Reserve Peace_Officers Assn. , former L.A. Police_Chief Ed Davis , Ventura County Dist . Atty . Michael D . Bradbury , former Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Robert Philibosian and anti-gang activist Chuck Jordan . Crime will be my No . 1 focus in Congress . This is the area of greatest difference between myself and the incumbent . In the past , he has said that crime is a state problem . I think it ' s everyone ' s problem until we can walk down the street and our kids can go_to school without fear of violence .</TEXT>
