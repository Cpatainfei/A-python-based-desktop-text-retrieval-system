   <HEADLINE> THEATER NOTES ; THE OSCARS STARTED SMALL TOO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the first winner to accept one of the new , competitive Ovation Awards Mon day night , Marga Gomez ( &quot; Carpa Clash &quot; ) told the 1 # 250 assembled at the Alex Theatre : &quot; I feel_like Janet Gaynor. &quot; She was referring to the winner of the first best actress Oscar , presented in 1929 . That was before the Oscars were seen worldwide , of course ; Gaynor later recalled that the ceremony &quot; was more like a private party. &quot; The Ovation ceremony was open_to the public , but it too resembled a private party . Loud cheers and whoops erupted from corners of the hall at the mention of certain nominees , signaling that a lot of theater people were there to support friends and colleagues . In scripted remarks before presenting an award , director Allan Miller observed that &quot; in Russia , the actors applaud the audience , &quot; to which Rue McClanahan snapped back , &quot; In L.A. , the actors are the audience. &quot; Nevertheless , Ovations sponsors eventually hope their annual ceremony will be famous among a much larger audience . The primary purpose of it is public relations -- to spread the word about the size and depth of the L.A. theater scene . Emcee Mariette Hartley picked_up a phrase that seems to have become a mantra among Ovations officials -- L.A. can boast of &quot; more shows on more stages than any other city at any time , anywhere on the planet. &quot; ( The number of shows on Mars has yet to be confirmed. ) L.A. offers more_than just quantity , she added , pointing_out the recent Pulitzers for shows that passed_through Los Angeles before going_to New York . Indeed , the evening ' s biggest winner , &quot; Sunset Boulevard , &quot; just opened in New York , after it found its footing in its Shubert Theatre run here . Everyone assumed the &quot; Sunset &quot; winners were all_in New York Monday . So by the time Joyce Van Patten announced that John_Napier , who designed &quot; Sunset , &quot; had won an award , she simply said &quot; We know where he is &quot; and started to walk_off the stage with his trophy . But then Napier rose from the audience , exclaiming &quot; I ' m here ! &quot; With his trophy finally in_hand , he announced that he ' s moving to L.A. , and &quot; it ' s comforting to know there may be some work here for me. &quot; &quot; Sunset &quot; hardly took all_the honors . Among the evening ' s biggest surprises was that Tracy Young , director of the Actors ' Gang ' s &quot; Hysteria , &quot; won the director / musical award over such competition as Trevor Nunn of &quot; Sunset &quot; and James Lapine of &quot; Falsettos. &quot; The best play awards to &quot; Fool Moon &quot; ( larger theaters ) and &quot; Men on the Verge of a His-panic Breakdown &quot; ( smaller ) prompted a bit of post-ceremony grumbling that these were not real plays , but rather revues or performance pieces . Even &quot; Men &quot; playwright Guillermo Reyes , accepting his Ovation , referred to his show as &quot; these monologues. &quot; Of course , the definition of &quot; play &quot; is not very precise . It would have been interesting to see how the winning plays would have fared if South Coast Repertory and the Cast Theatre -- two theaters whose productions have won many of the recent playwriting awards from critics ' groups -- were among the competitors . They don ' t belong_to Theatre LA , so their shows aren ' t eligible for Ovations . * AT THE LOBERO : West_End Artists Theatre Company , formerly based at the West_End Theatre in Van Nuys , has announced a season of shows at Santa Barbara ' s Lobero Theatre : Michael Kavanagh ' s solo performance &quot; Bein ' With Behan &quot; ( Jan . 28-Feb . 12 ) , Michael Valenti ' s Off Broadway musical &quot; Lovesong &quot; ( Feb . 25-March 4 ) , Gene Castle ' s new musical &quot; Tin_Pan_Alley &quot; ( June 30-July 14 ) and a revival of West_End ' s production of the musical revue &quot; Broadway Sings Out ! &quot; ( Dec . 9-16 , 1995 ) . The company presented &quot; Crazy Words , Crazy Tunes &quot; at the Lobero last summer , in the wake of the untimely departure of Pasadena-based Theatre Corp . of America , which left a number of Santa Barbara subscribers grumbling about their unfinished subscriptions . Although West_End has nothing to do with Theatre Corp. , West_End will offer a discount to the Theatre Corp. ' s Lobero subscribers ( available only until Dec . 1 ) in recognition of the fact that they otherwise might be leery of subscribing_to another Lobero series .</TEXT>
