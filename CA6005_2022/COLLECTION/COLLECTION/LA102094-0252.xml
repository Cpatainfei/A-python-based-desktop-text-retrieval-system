   <HEADLINE> A PEEK AT ' POCAHONTAS ' WHEN ' LION ' RETURNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Disney ' s megahit &quot; The Lion King &quot; returns to theaters just before Thanksgiving , movie audiences will get a first glimpse of what the studio hopes will be its next animated blockbuster , &quot; Pocahontas. &quot; More_than four minutes of continuous footage from Disney ' s latest animated creation -- featuring one of the movie ' s eight original songs -- will debut with the &quot; Lion King &quot; re-release at theaters Nov . 18 on 1 # 500 screens . &quot; Pocahontas , &quot; the studio ' s 33rd full-length animated feature and its first to be inspired by a real-life figure , will bow next June . The &quot; featurette &quot; ( as the studio calls the &quot; Pocahontas &quot; sequence ) is one of the key elements of Disney ' s new $ 10-million-plus campaign to relaunch &quot; The Lion King , &quot; which sold a whopping $ 267 million in tickets before it was intentionally yanked from theaters in late September with plans for re-release during the holiday season . Disney ' s unprecedented move to pull the film when it was still grossing millions each weekend was timed to when its core audience of children would likely drop_off with the start of school . Disney is hoping to re-attract families just as the holiday season gets under way , and the studio presumably wants to refreshen the movie for Oscar consideration . In giving moviegoers their first exposure to &quot; Pocahontas &quot; so far in_advance of its actual release , Disney is looking_to generate an early buzz as it successfully did last fall when it previewed the four-minute opening sequence of &quot; The Lion King &quot; in front of its live-action movie &quot; The Three Musketeers. &quot; The &quot; Pocahontas &quot; sequence , which runs approximately four minutes and 20 seconds , features the film ' s heroine ( voice of actress Irene Bedard ) singing &quot; Colors of the Wind , &quot; a musical lesson on the Native_American philosophy toward life , to her new acquaintance Captain John Smith ( voice by Mel Gibson ) . Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken and Broadway lyricist Stephen Schwartz ( &quot; Pippin &quot; ) wrote the score . &quot; This is not unlike what we did with ' The Lion King ' last year in terms of giving the public a real sense of what the movie is about -- the feeling , the emotion , the depth , &quot; says Disney ' s distribution president Richard Cook . Trailers of &quot; Pocahontas , &quot; showing various scenes from the movie , will begin showing in theaters in early spring . Disney animation president Peter Schneider expects the movie , which began production approximately three years ago , to be complete by April . A total of 450 artists , including 45 animators , are working_on the production . As part of the new &quot; Lion King &quot; campaign , a fresh trailer for the movie will debut this weekend on about 8 # 500 screens . The campaign also includes new posters and theater lobby displays with proclamations such_as &quot; The King Has Returned. &quot; New print ads and TV spots will begin appearing in early November . Another promotional lure Disney is using to attract audiences the first weekend of the re-release is offering the first 100 moviegoers at each show a special commemorative poster of &quot; Lion King &quot; featuring a holiday greeting and new artwork of all_the characters from the movie . &quot; It ' s as if we ' re launching a brand-new movie , &quot; says Cook . &quot; There are families who will certainly want to share the emotion , fun and excitement of this movie again . We ' ve found with movies that are evergreen , audiences just can ' t get enough of them. &quot; The relaunch also includes new promotional tie-ins from Disney ' s corporate sponsor partners , including Burger King , which will give_away another 20 million figurines from the movie . The interactive &quot; Lion King &quot; video_game is also due out during the holidays . While most rivals hail Disney ' s strategy as a clever and savvy business strategy , industry skeptics see the company ' s motivation as greed and conceit . Some speculate the re-release was a calculated attempt to sabotage New Line Cinema ' s animated feature &quot; The Swan Princess , &quot; which opens the same day . ( Several former Disney animators worked_on the movie. ) &quot; I think they were smart to reissue their movie to get the holiday playing time , but I also believe that they don ' t want ' The Swan Princess ' to be successful and would do anything to try and sabotage it , &quot; said Mitch Goldman , president of marketing and distribution at New Line Cinema . Goldman added that his movie was screened Saturday morning for exhibitors and the response was &quot; overwhelmingly positive. &quot; Cook dismisses speculation that competition with &quot; Princess &quot; figured into Disney ' s plan to reopen &quot; Lion King &quot; on the weekend prior to Thanksgiving . &quot; It ' s not anything new for us , &quot; he said . With the exception of &quot; Lion King , &quot; which originally opened in the summer , all_of Disney ' s new animated movies -- including last year ' s &quot; Tim Burton ' s Nightmare Before Christmas , &quot; &quot; Aladdin , &quot; &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; and &quot; The Little Mermaid &quot; -- traditionally open during the holiday season . Schneider explains that the strategy to relaunch &quot; Lion King &quot; was &quot; to maximize the film ' s potential both financially and artistically . And it helps set_up the release in the foreign market. &quot; The movie , which has opened in some overseas markets , including England and Japan , will debut throughout Europe beginning next month . Industry executives estimate that &quot; Lion King ' s &quot; re-release in the United States could yield as much as an additional $ 30 million at the box_office . &quot; Personally , I hope we get_to $ 300 million because that ' s an incredible benchmark , &quot; says Schneider , &quot; and for the artists it ' s thrilling for them to find that kind of recognition of their work. &quot; Cook declined to estimate how much more money he thinks &quot; Lion King &quot; can bring_in . &quot; This is a grand experiment . I honestly don ' t know what to expect -- none of us do. &quot;</TEXT>
