   <HEADLINE> TIRED IDEAS IN A SHINY NEW BOX ; JAPAN ' S LATEST TRADE PLAN DOES LITTLE TO ADDRESS WASHINGTON ' S CONCERNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japan is striving to put trade talks with the United States back on track with a so-called &quot; new &quot; set of market-opening initiatives . Too_bad the effort does not live_up_to Tokyo ' s stated intentions . The half-baked plan unveiled Tuesday is widely perceived as a mere repackaging of the vague , unsatisfactory proposals rejected by Washington last month when U.S.-Japan trade talks collapsed . The new plan is notable on two counts : Missing are the numerical targets or trade goals that have become a defining element in U.S.-Japan talks under the Clinton_Administration . The omission is in_line with Tokyo ' s well-honed campaign to portray as &quot; managed trade &quot; President Clinton ' s quest_for results in the effort to reduce the $ 60-billion U.S. trade_deficit with Japan . Should Washington balk at the latest Japanese plan , Tokyo surely will cry foul and claim the United States is violating the spirit of free_trade in seeking quantitative and qualitative results . Clever -- but misleading . Secondly , who are the Japanese to complain of managed trade ? Tokyo practices its own thinly veiled version of what it complains about . Even though Japan has dismantled many formal barriers , imports face major administrative and other hassles in entering Japanese markets . In 1991 Tokyo was willing to commit to fairly specific trade goals with Europe . Japan agreed to freeze car exports to Europe at 1.23 million units a year until 1999 , in return for being allowed to increase the number of cars produced by Japanese factories within the European Community fivefold . Two years later Tokyo even agreed to further cuts_in its car exports to Europe because of a slump in car sales in the EC . In short , Japan conveniently agrees to goals when it comes_to exporting but not importing . Curious . Sounds a bit like managed trade . Enough . The rhetoric , including the sometimes abrasive tone of U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor , distracts from the real issue : true results in reducing the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance . Tokyo should help define those results instead of fighting them . Its latest plan , however good Tokyo ' s intentions might be , does little to advance the dialogue .</TEXT>
