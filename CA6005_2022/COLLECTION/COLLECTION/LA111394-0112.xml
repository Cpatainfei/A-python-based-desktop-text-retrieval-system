   <HEADLINE> HIKING : ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST : STODDARD PEAK ' S PEEK AT L.A.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For most of the winter and early spring , 4 # 624-foot Stoddard Peak seems strategically positioned just below the snow_line and just above the smog line . Its summit offers great clear-day views of Claremont and the San Gabriel Valley below , and of Mt . Baldy and its neighboring peaks . The hike to Stoddard Peak is along a dirt fire road for most of its length . Directions to trail head : From Interstate 10 ( San Bernardino Freeway ) in Upland , exit on Euclid Avenue and follow it a_few miles , first through a commercial district then on a winding climb through the residential_district of San Antonio Heights to Mt . Baldy Road . Turn right and follow it to the signed junction with dead-end Mountain Avenue and turn right . ( The turnoff is also indicated by road paddle 1.07. ) Descend a short paved road to a small parking_area . The hike : Ignore the old paved road heading south into the canyon and instead join the dirt road that heads east past a teensy-tiny hydroelectric plant . The road crosses the creek at the bottom of San Antonio Canyon . Three-quarters of a mile from the trail head , you ' ll reach a_couple_of private cabins . Step over or duck under a vehicle gate , and enjoy the mellow ascent through an oak woodland . The path rounds Cascade Canyon and climbs to a saddle , a fairly level area called Stoddard Flat . Just as the dirt road reaches the flat , look sharply right for the unsigned path to Stoddard Peak . The brushy trail plunges west into the chaparral , ascending to a ridge top and turning south . You ' ll gain one false summit , then a second , before reaching the true Stoddard Peak . Enjoy the panorama from Stoddard summit , which includes San Antonio Canyon , Mt . Baldy , San Gabriel Valley , Pomona and the Chino Hills . Stoddard Peak Trail Where : Base of Mt . Baldy , Angeles National Forest . Distance : 6 miles round_trip ; 1 # 000-foot elevation gain .
