   <TEXT> &quot; I believe that ( it ) is destined to revolutionize our educational system and that in a_few years it will supplant largely , if not entirely , the use of textbooks. &quot; What is this wondrous technology , and who is the visionary making this bold prediction ? Bill Gates touting the power of the personal_computer ? No , it was Thomas_Edison , 70 years ago , talking_about the motion_picture . Once , the blackboard was supposed to turn education upside down . Today , multimedia computers and telecommunications are supposed to be the silver bullets that will fix the myriad problems that plague the nation ' s schools . But America ' s love of technological solutions often has ended in heartbreak . And history may repeat itself with the euphoria over computers and education -- a fixation driven as much by the electronics_industry ' s search for profit as any sign that PCs can turn_around student performance . It isn ' t that technology has no place in the classroom . Most educators believe that computers and other Information Age wonders can be powerful teaching tools . In the right_hands , they inspire the brightest students as they provide new ways to reach those with learning problems . But just as the corporate world discovered that technology did not unleash productivity until companies undertook the hard work of changing the way they did business , experts say the billions of dollars a year that schools spend on computers will yield disappointment unless educators change the way they teach . Which computer equipment to buy , how much to spend on it and how to use the technology are issues that cannot be severed from the national debate over school reform . &quot; Technology alone will never do_it -- not without a serious incorporation into how ( teachers and school administrators ) do their jobs , &quot; said Jan Hawkins , director of the Center for Children and Technology in New York . So far , such caveats have not slowed the flow of education dollars into high_technology . The nation ' s public and private_schools last year invested $ 2.1 billion in personal_computer technology , according to a study by the Software Publishers Assn . Some say that number needs to be higher for schools to be properly equipped . Nearly all schools now have some computers , but on average there is only one for every 14 students , according to Quality Educational Data , a Denver research firm . And California ranks 49th among the states , at one computer for every 19.8 students . Even at that level , investment in computers competes with spending on teacher pay , books and paper as_many schools face financial crises . Companies whose main talent is selling products to schools -- notably Jostens Corp. , originally known for peddling class rings and high_school yearbooks -- have been quick to capitalize on the educational technology craze . Entertainment firms are muscling in as well . Trip Hawkins , chairman of 3DO Co. , once declared his firm ' s advanced video_game machine to be nothing less than &quot; the greatest breakthrough in education since the invention of the printing press. &quot; Across the country , schools are leaping aboard the bandwagon . From the elite Dalton School in Manhattan , with its state-of-the-art computer_network and in-house software specialists , to scruffy Martin_Luther_King Elementary School in Oakland , with its shiny new , federally funded &quot; integrated learning system , &quot; schools are racing to install new technology before parents accuse them of falling_behind . Yet there is little evidence that computers in themselves lead to sustained improvement in educational performance . American students continue to lag behind counterparts in Japan and Europe , where the computerization of education is far less advanced . Most studies suggest that a range of factors -- especially teacher competence -- ultimately will determine the effectiveness of computers in the schools . For veteran educators , today ' s enthusiasm for computers provokes an uncomfortable sense of deja_vu ; they have seen too many technical fixes . In the 1960s and early 1970s , so-called &quot; performance contracting &quot; -- in which corporate management techniques and early educational computer_systems were applied to the performance of underachieving students -- was all_the rage . &quot; With the winding down of the military budget ( at the end of the Vietnam_War ) , a lot of companies looked_to education as a big market , &quot; said David Tyack , a Stanford_University professor who writes_about such educational experiments . &quot; There was an ideology : Business can solve any problem ; we can guarantee how much kids will learn. &quot; Pilot_programs were set_up nationwide , with one of the most prominent experiments in Texarkana , Ark . A company called Dorsett Educational Systems set_up a series of &quot; rapid learning centers &quot; where students logged into a centralized computer to practice basic math and language skills , Tyack recounts in a paper on the trend . Prizes were awarded for correctly finishing a programmed lesson or for advancing a grade level in mathematics or reading . But the experiment fell_apart when it turned_out that the Dorsett computers were giving students the answers to the standardized tests that were supposed to measure the program ' s effectiveness . Performance contracting quickly fell_out of favor . But computers returned in other guises . A brief enthusiasm for &quot; computer literacy &quot; had high_school and college_students learning arcane -- and now almost useless -- computer_programming languages . The first wave of microcomputers in the early 1980s spurred hopes again . But many schools , especially poorer ones , ended_up with obsolete equipment and lacked the software and teacher training to make_good use of what they had -- a phenomenon detailed in a special fall , 1992 , issue of the trade magazine Macworld , which warned of the creation of a &quot; technological underclass &quot; in America ' s schools . Multimedia -- the latest fad in the computer world -- is supposed to change all this , finally allowing computers to live_up_to their educational potential . By mixing sounds , pictures and video images with traditional text-based computers , multimedia_systems seem to engage children growing_up in a culture of video_games and MTV . &quot; The technology allows them to absorb things with much more vigor , &quot; said Chris Henmann , a science_teacher at John F . Kennedy Jr . High_School in Cupertino , a district that is part of California ' s model technology schools program . &quot; Kids are naturally curious , natural investigators , and this allows them to nurture that , &quot; he said , gesturing to his multimedia teaching station that features a computer and a laser disc player for high-quality , interactive video . &quot; They go at it with such passion. &quot; Hungry for the emerging market , the software and entertainment_industries are spending hundreds of millions on multimedia programs . Affluent parents -- fearful their kids will be left_behind -- are the most avid customers . Sales of educational software for the home leaped a remarkable 73 % in the fourth quarter of 1993 , making_it the hottest niche in the software business . Although video game-like &quot; edutainment &quot; programs may be more edifying than the TV watching they are supplanting at_home , computer-based learning in the schools displaces other kinds of teaching -- not always for reasons of educational effectiveness . Federal financial_aid programs encourage school districts with limited resources to buy integrated learning systems -- self-contained computer labs that focus_on drilling basic skills . Descended from the mainframe computer-based &quot; computer-aided instruction &quot; systems of the 1970s , ILSs are a little bit like electronic workbooks that can adapt themselves to students ' responses . A wrong answer to a question brings an explanation , and the next question will be of similar difficulty . With correct answers , the questions get progressively harder . The computer tracks the students ' progress , allowing them to pick_up where they left_off after each session . The leading ILS companies -- Jostens Learning Corp . of San Diego and Computer Curriculum Corp. , a Palo Alto-based subsidiary of Paramount Communications -- have been expanding their systems ' capabilities to include multimedia , providing visual and sound cues along with words . Many now can be integrated with other types of software , such_as electronic encyclopedias . But often , these systems ' appeal lies_in the fact that they provide a simple solution for a troubled school , paid_for by the federal_government . The companies employ legions of former teachers and administrators who wine_and_dine school officials -- and coach them on how to find money for computer projects . Under the U.S. Department_of_Education ' s Chapter I program , schools in poor neighborhoods can qualify for special funds to help underachieving students -- $ 6.9 billion for this fiscal_year . An estimated 5 % to 10 % of the funds , which are administered by state and local school authorities , are spent on computers . Some evidence indicates that ILSs help improve test scores in the short term , and for years they have been accepted in many quarters as a worthwhile way to spend Chapter I funds . Just as important , they do not require the expensive teacher training , curriculum overhaul and sophisticated assessment methods that experts call critical to making the most of computers in the classroom . &quot; The Chapter I programs use ILSs because they have a lot of money to spend at once , &quot; said John Cradler , director of the Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development in San Francisco , which evaluates programs for the California Department_of_Education . At Ralph Bunche Jr . High_School in Harlem , computer education specialist Paul Reese is familiar_with the problem . The &quot; school within a school &quot; that he helps run is recognized as a technology innovator -- a place where computers , teacher training and curriculum reform come_together . Yet when money became available for new machines , Reese was not_able to spend it the way he wanted . The terms of a special grant from New York ' s Municipal Assistance Corp . required the school to buy an integrated learning system . ILS companies reject the criticisms , pointing_out that their systems , based these days on personal_computers , are far more versatile than before . &quot; The technology now is so flexible that it ' s appropriate for all_of our youngsters , &quot; said Proctor Houston , executive_vice_president of Jostens Learning Corp . &quot; In our experience , the key to successful technology use is how it is implemented. &quot; But implementation is the heart of the problem . Especially in large , urban school districts , teacher training is inadequate . Technology programs are only sporadically coordinated with larger reform efforts . Too often , the computer lab is an island . And there is an enormous problem with assessment -- an extremely contentious subject in the schools even when computers are not involved . Many educators say technology underscores the need for assessment methods deeper and more revealing than standardized testing , which is under increasing attack as outdated and racially and culturally biased . There is growing support for so-called project-based learning -- in which computers can play a central role -- yet there is no cost-effective method to evaluate such techniques . That gap can make_it all but impossible to determine how money should be spent : More computers , or more teacher training ? More machines , or more high-level multimedia software ? &quot; Technology is a tool , which in the hands of a good teacher can be very powerful . Kids are very attracted to it , &quot; said Marilyn Rosenblum , vice_president for educational sales and marketing at Broderbund Software , a leading vendor of children ' s software . &quot; But it ' s not the solution to the ills of our schools , &quot; she added . &quot; I ' m scared that all_the media hype and all_the Wall_Street hype is going_to set us up for a big disappointment. &quot;</TEXT>
