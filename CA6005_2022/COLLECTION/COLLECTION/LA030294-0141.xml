   <HEADLINE> MUSLIMS , CROATS OK BOSNIA UNION ; BALKANS : CHRISTOPHER SAYS THE U.S.-BROKERED ACCORD ' SHOWS THAT PEACE IS POSSIBLE. ' OFFICIALS HOPE THE PACT WILL PUT PRESSURE ON SERBS TO REACH A SETTLEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Bosnian government and Croatian separatists , two of the parties in a three-sided war , signed a peace agreement Tuesday to form a federated state -- a move hailed by U.S. officials as a significant step toward ending two years of bloodshed in Bosnia-Herzegovina . The agreement &quot; shows that peace is possible , &quot; Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher declared after witnessing the pact ' s signing at a ceremony here . The accord came_after three weeks of intensive negotiations , which culminated in four days of U.S.-mediated talks here among representatives of the predominantly Muslim Bosnian government , Bosnian Croats and Croatia -- Bosnia ' s neighbor , which has armed and supported Bosnian Croat rebels . Despite the hopeful language , the agreement is far from an end to the war . Most significantly , it leaves_out Serbian separatists who control about 70 % of Bosnian territory , including large swaths that the new federation would claim as its own . But American and European officials hope the agreement will add_to pressure on the Serbs to reach a settlement that would involve giving_up some of the territory they have seized . The Croats and the Bosnian government also must still work_out numerous details of their new federation in talks expected to begin Friday in Vienna . Finally , although U.S. officials insisted that the men who negotiated the agreement -- primarily Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic -- acted in good_faith , they conceded that neither fully controls the forces on_his_own side . Extreme elements among the Croatian and Muslim populations have torpedoed earlier agreements between the two groups . Under the settlement , the two groups would form a federation made_up of several cantons , some of which would be predominantly Muslim , some predominantly Croatian and others mixed . That new federated state would cover just over half the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- leaving the rest in Serbian hands . In theory , Bosnian Serbs could join the new federation as a third_party , although neither American officials nor other observers expect that would happen . Under a second agreement , signed simultaneously , the new federation would form a loose economic union with Croatia . After two years of war that has involved thousands of atrocities and cost roughly 250 # 000 missing and dead -- mostly Muslim civilians -- the federation idea holds some benefits for each side that earlier peace plans did not . For the Bosnian government , a chief benefit would be territorial . By linking the Bosnian government ' s lands with those held by Croats , the new federation would be far more economically and politically viable than the remnant of territory the government seemed likely to control under earlier peace plans , which would have divided Bosnia into three ethnic states . The agreement also commits Croatia to guarantee Bosnian access to the Adriatic_Sea -- an economically vital point . &quot; The fact that you have these two units together helps a lot &quot; in making the resulting federation economically viable , said a senior Clinton_Administration official who assisted in the negotiations . By setting_up a binational federation , the agreement would maintain -- at least in theory -- the idea of a Bosnian state not based solely on ethnicity . That idea has been of great importance to some Bosnian government loyalists , who are mostly Muslim but include some Serbs and Croats . For Croatia , the chief selling point has been a chance to regain the graces of the United States and its European allies . Large chunks of Croatian territory remain under Serbian occupation as a result of earlier warfare . Granic made clear that his country now expects Western help in the &quot; peaceful integration &quot; of those territories back into Croatian control . Over the last three weeks , &quot; it started to sink_in that this was a real opportunity for Croatia to become a real partner with the United States and Europe , &quot; the senior Administration official said . The North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s action Monday in downing four Bosnian Serb warplanes violating a &quot; no-fly &quot; zone over Bosnia also may have sent a message to Croatian extremists , as well as_to the Zagreb government supporting them , that there is a price to be paid_for destabilizing and renegade actions . Croatia had been threatened with the same harsh international sanctions levied against Serbia if it persisted_in supporting Croatian nationalist rebels in Bosnia . Meanwhile , for the Administration the agreement caps a decision made last month to inject the United States directly into the Bosnian war for the first time as the sole mediator in negotiations . The result has staked the Administration ' s prestige more directly than ever before on a successful outcome . &quot; We have acquired a kind of moral_obligation , &quot; former White_House National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said . &quot; A year ago . . . we were hands off . Now we ' re no longer hands off. &quot; Despite the potential reasons for all sides to make the agreement work , previous accords and cease-fires signed by moderates in the Bosnian war have proven short-lived because radical military commanders have refused to abide_by them . American officials conceded the same fate could befall the current agreement . Emotions run high in central Bosnia , where Muslim-Croatian relations have been poisoned by the past year of violence , provoked by Western capitulation to the concept of ethnic partitioning . Tensions are particularly sharp in the central Bosnian city of Vitez , where radical Croatian forces , instigated by nationalists from the Herzegovina region , committed atrocities against Muslim civilians ; this has drawn_in equally violent , unscrupulous Islamic warriors who have come_to fight their own holy war in hopes of securing a fundamentalist foothold in Europe . Silajdzic and Granic represent the moderate factions in their respective republics , but their word and signatures on peace accords hold little sway with radical elements . But there have been signs_in recent weeks that the Croatian leadership in Zagreb is distancing itself from the more extreme elements of the Bosnian Croat community , such_as former rebel leader Mate Boban , who has been swept aside by another Zagreb surrogate . Boban , a small-town businessman through whom Croatian radicals have funneled millions of dollars in weapons with the aim of forcibly expanding the state of Croatia , had instigated much of the fighting in central Bosnia by loosing Croatian radical forces against Muslim civilians in a terror campaign aimed at forcing them to flee . He was removed from his post as self-proclaimed president of the purported rebel state of Herzeg-Bosna last month and replaced with Kresimir Zubak , a move thought to be aimed at convincing the West that Croatia has abandoned a nationalist course . Although Croatia has struck an official pose of neutrality in the Bosnian conflict , U.N. military observers have confirmed that at least 5 # 000 regular Croatian army troops have been fighting in Bosnia , and many_more nationalist volunteers are estimated to be backing Bosnian Croat forces . Under Tuesday ' s agreement , Croatia will withdraw its troops from Bosnian territory . Lauter reported from Washington and Williams from Vienna .
