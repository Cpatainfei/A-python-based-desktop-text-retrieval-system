   <TEXT> I would like to assure Elaine E . Minamide ( &quot; Bedeviled by Halloween , &quot; Voices , Oct . 17 ) that she needn ' t worry about Druids . What little we know about them we get from Julius Caesar and other classical writers , and a bit more from early medieval Irish sources . None of them speak about sinister rites on Oct . 31 , the end of the Celtic year . A plausible case has been made that All Saints ' Day was set_on Nov . 1 in Eighth Century Ireland , to coincide with the beginning of the new year ( see John Hennig , &quot; The Meaning of All the Saints , &quot; Medieval Studies 10 , 1948 , 147-61 ) , but there is no evidence to indicate that it was meant to offset remnants of superstitious high_jinks or low jinks that took_place on the previous day or evening . The commemoration of the faithful departed on Nov . 2 ( All Souls ' Day ) was a later Continental development , though perhaps it was partially inspired by an Irish commemoration on Nov . 14 . So when did the idea of spooky Halloweens arise ? Rather late , I ' m afraid , at least in the English-speaking world . The first relevant record I can find in Great Britain is a poem called &quot; Halloween , &quot; by John Mayne , which appeared in a Scottish magazine in 1780 . It doubtless inspired the similar poem of the same name published by Robert Burns in 1786 . Burns added explanatory notes &quot; for the sake of those who are unacquainted_with the manners and traditions of the country where the scene is cast , &quot; that is , among the peasantry in the west of Scotland . He explains , as if it would be unfamiliar to most of his readers , that Halloween &quot; is thought to be a night when witches , devils , and other mischief-making beings are all abroad on their baneful midnight errands ; particularly , those aerial people , the fairies , are said , on that night , to hold a grand anniversary. &quot; But in the poem itself , he only mentions fairies dancing , and he only describes various fortune-telling rituals performed by a group of courting couples , like pulling_up a cabbage to see what one ' s future spouse will be like . He makes_it sound like great fun . It is entirely possible , of course , that some of the rural Scottish beliefs in Burns ' time concerning the evening before All Saints ' Day were leftovers from pre-Christian times , but , if so , they must have been pretty diluted and should have given little cause for religious concern . I am still looking_for hard evidence of earlier Halloween celebrations , and I would be grateful for any light that readers can throw on the subject . Meanwhile , I urge everyone to go_with the flow and enjoy the festival as it has developed in our culture . ANDY KELLY Professor of English UCLA</TEXT>
