   <TEXT> To some people , he was a nuisance , knocking_over trash_cans to feed his addiction to garbage and grease . To others , he was a furry folk hero , beloved by tourists who brought him bread and honey . He was nicknamed Split Ear , for an old battle scar . Now he ' s dead . His mammoth carcass was found in the woods on Aug . 28 , five days after he was peppered with birdshot by a man sick_of seeing the 680-pound bear around his dogs and children . But even months after his body was bulldozed into the forest floor , Split Ear remains larger than life , his name invoked by those on both sides of a long-simmering feud in the hamlets within the 6-million-acre Adirondack Park , home to about 4 # 000 black_bears . On one side are wildlife biologists and others who say feeding bears is bad for the animals and dangerous to humans . On the other side are people who say bears are gentle , fun to feed and a great tourist attraction . The state caused the problems in town , they say , when it shut_down open-pit landfills . &quot; Old Split Ear was King of the_Hill at the town dump , &quot; said Eugene Conger , 64 , a semi-retired mechanic who fed seven bears in his yard until the state made him stop . &quot; He ' d been eating there for 26 years , then the government closed_down his ' restaurant. ' Where was he supposed to go ? &quot; Bear-feeding in Old Forge , about 100 miles northwest of Albany , has gotten so rampant that state officials plan to make_it illegal by next spring , said Louis Berchielli , bear expert for the state_Department of Environmental Conservation . Even those who feed bears &quot; incidentally , &quot; by leaving crackers for deer or being sloppy with their garbage , may be subject_to prosecution , he said . Legislation allowing the department to ban bear-feeding was signed by Gov . Mario Cuomo in August , along with updated hunting guidelines . Conger said he started feeding bears in addition to deer four years ago , when a sow he calls Mabel came_around . &quot; She had been hit by a car and was hurt , &quot; he said . Mabel would come for breakfast and dinner . &quot; Sometimes she ' d be lying on the picnic table , waiting , &quot; he said . &quot; I called it Mabel ' s Table. &quot; Every day , Mabel would gobble down a 5-gallon pail of grease-drenched pancakes and waffles donated by a local restaurant . A bakery sent 30 loaves_of_bread a week . Conger would sit at the table with Mabel , hand-feeding her grapes , honey-soaked bread and maple_syrup squirted from a plastic bottle . Other bears , including Split Ear , started coming_after the dump closed two years ago . People came too , as_many as 300 a day , to watch and feed the bears . &quot; It was quite the tourist attraction , &quot; Conger said . But neighbors complained of traffic_jams and cars_parked on their lawns . Police were told of a man who let Mabel lick honey from the arm of his 8-year-old son . &quot; It became a circus-like atmosphere , &quot; Berchielli said . There was no law against feeding . &quot; But because there was such a high potential for someone being hurt , we went_in ( in the fall of 1992 ) and told him that if he didn ' t stop we ' d treat it as a criminal nuisance case. &quot; Closing_down Conger ' s snack_bar didn ' t get_rid_of Split Ear , though . Plenty of other people also feed bears , although not so publicly , Conger said . And there are always trash bags and trash_bins to raid . &quot; After Mr. Conger stopped feeding the bears , Split Ear would still come and sit on his neighbor ' s porch , &quot; Berchielli said . &quot; It kind of terrorized the elderly lady who lived there. &quot; So in September of 1992 , Split Ear was lured into a culvert trap ( essentially a big section of pipe ) , drugged , and trucked about 12 miles to the Moose River Plains , a wilderness area rife_with black_cherries and other bear food . He returned to Old Forge in May . &quot; People say they have to feed the bears because we closed the landfills , &quot; Berchielli said . &quot; But Split Ear weighed 680 pounds ( more_than twice the normal weight of an adult_male ) . His belly just about dragged_on the ground. &quot; The outcry over Split Ear ' s death inspired local artist Richard Nadeau to design a T-shirt honoring him . It is selling briskly at his Moose River Trading_Post in nearby Thendara , he said . Nadeau envisions a whole line of Split Ear artifacts , including caps and key chains , with some of the profits going_to a fund for bear research and educational brochures . Celeste Nagle , who moved to Old Forge from Long_Island with her husband , Gary , and opened the Black_Bear Inn last July , said she doesn ' t mind the bears_pawing through her trash . She fumes when she talks_of Split Ear . &quot; That poor old bear just wanted something to eat , &quot; Celeste Nagle said , standing behind her bar beside several large , framed photographs of local bears . &quot; He was never a threat to anyone. &quot; Impassioned letters about Split Ear have become a regular feature in Old Forge ' s weekly newspaper , the Adirondack Express . One writer penned a poem titled &quot; An Ode to a Bear. &quot; Another , in &quot; A Eulogy to Split Ear , &quot; wrote , &quot; I will miss your silent lumbering and your dark , haunting eyes. &quot; Donald A . ( Pete ) Beckingham , who was fined $ 500 for illegally &quot; taking &quot; a bear_out of season , told the newspaper that he had birdshot in his shotgun and only meant to drive Split Ear away , not kill him . He said the bear had been bothering dogs and children in his yard for two years . &quot; We can thank a concerned citizen for doing what the paid conservation officers should have done last year , &quot; wrote Jim Capron , one of many who contend that the state should move nuisance bears farther away . That just moves the problem , said Berchielli , because bears accustomed to handouts will seek people wherever they go . The solution is to change the bear ' s behavior by denying it access to garbage and goodies . Berchielli said Split Ear ' s fate is not unique . &quot; Unfortunately , it ' s quite common &quot; for homeowners to shoot scrounging bears , he said . As for Conger , he still has the company of about 15 white-tailed_deer who eat 100 pounds of corn a week in his yard . Mabel and her cubs still stop by for an occasional visit . But he misses feeding the bears , who gaze from poster-size photographs on his dining_room walls . &quot; They were like part of my family , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
