   <HEADLINE> SCREENING ROOM : ' DRAGON GATE ' : SEARCH FOR SELF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No Oscar season would be complete without films opening in self-deluded Oscar-qualifying runs . Such a film is &quot; The Dragon Gate , &quot; which opens today at the Sunset 5.Dan Coplan , who wrote , produced and starred in this supernatural quest_for self-knowledge , is an attorney and martial artist , playing the same in the film . Coplan unfortunately is not an actor , and as a result his film , directed by Michael Oliver , comes_across as a foolish vanity production . Also opening today at the Sunset 5 is Russ Meyer ' s deliriously erotic and sadistic 1965 &quot; Faster , Pussycat ! Kill ! Kill ! , &quot; in which three dangerous dominatrix types zero_in on a rich but crippled Dirty Old_Man and his two dim sons at a desert ranch . Information : ( 310 ) 848-3500 . KEVIN THOMAS</TEXT>
