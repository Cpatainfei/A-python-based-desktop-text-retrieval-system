   <HEADLINE> AFRICA ' S SALVATION LIES WITHIN ITSELF ; CIVIL WARS : DESPOTS HAVE REFINED WHAT COLONISTS STARTED -- EXPLOITATION OF ETHNIC DIFFERENCES TO PERPETUATE THEIR REIGNS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To attribute the carnage in Rwanda and past massacres elsewhere in Africa to ancient tribal rivalries is unsatisfactory . These rivalries would always exist in Africa . The real cause is the exploitation of ethnic differences by autocratic governments to maintain their grip on power . The colonialists did this but , in the post-colonial period , despotic African heads_of_state refined the stratagem . Although Somalia is ethnically homogenous , former military dictators played one clan against another in attempts to perpetuate their rule . In Cameroon , Kenya , Sudan and other African_countries , one tribe is played off against another , often resulting in violence and ruinous civil strife . Last week , the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed when their plane burst into flames . The Rwandan government has said rocket fire brought_down the plane . Presidents Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and Cyprian Ntaryamira of Burundi were returning from Tanzania , where they and other African leaders had been meeting in another attempt to end years of ethnic warfare in their countries . The deaths unleashed a wave of terror and carnage as disaffected elements of the army and police_forces went_on the rampage , murdering Rwanda ' s interim prime_minister , three cabinet_ministers , nuns , Jesuit priests and Belgian peace-keeping soldiers . Tens of thousands have been slain in the orgy of violence . Two factors underlie Africa ' s never-ending political violence and civil_wars that have devastated economies and produced human suffering on a massive scale and a horrendous refugee problem . ( Africa ' s refugee count has reached 8 million , not counting those trapped in their countries. ) The first is the proliferation of oppressive dictatorships , concentration of political power in the hands of the state or one person and the absence of mechanisms for peaceful transfer of political power . In 1990 , only four of the 53 African_countries were democratic . Although this tiny number has grown to 13 since then , political tyranny is still the order_of_the_day . Consequently in the vast majority of African_nations , the only way to remove an incompetent , corrupt and oppressive regime from power is by waging a destructive civil_war . Ironically , the overthrow of an oppressive regime does not end the violence or strife . A political vacuum emerges and fierce fighting erupts over the spoils of power or to fill the vacuum : Witness Ethiopia , Liberia , Somalia and South_Africa . The second factor has been the near-total absence of mechanisms or institutions for peaceful resolution of conflicts . The Organization of African Unity , whose mandate is conflict resolution , shirked this responsibility for much of the post-colonial period . As a result , a minor political dispute can escalate into a full-blown civil conflagration and rage for years until foreign powers intervene to impose a settlement or mediation . Unfortunately , foreign intervention does not always work , as recent experience in Somali attests . The Somali mission , though a magnanimous humanitarian endeavor , lacked an African input and was reactive , rather than preventive . The mantra should be prevention . The international community should not wait until the violence degenerates into wanton carnage and destruction before rushing in peacekeeping troops and evacuating trapped foreign-relief workers . Where civil strife exists in any African_country , the world community should insist on an African solution . It must have the following elements : * The adoption of transition programs for democratic rule . The rules must be fair to and accepted by all parties before the elections . All parties must agree to abide_by the results . In Burundi and Rwanda , for example , a national conference of all leaders -- religious , political and traditional -- should be convened . In both countries , a special constitutional provision should be adopted to rotate the presidency . The army , police , civil_service , judiciary , educational_institutions and political_parties should be de-tribalized . A permanent supra-national commission should be appointed for this purpose . * The establishment of mechanisms for peaceful resolution of conflicts . A commission or panel of retired judges from neighboring countries should , with the blessing of the OAU , adjudicate political disputes . * Should these steps fail and war erupt , the OAU shall put_together a peacekeeping force with troops from neighboring African_countries . In Liberia , an OAU-backed peace initiative , supported with a $ 25-million U.S. grant , succeeded . The warring factions are being disarmed and an interim government will be installed next month . In Burundi and Rwanda , the U.N. Security_Council should pass its peacekeeping mandate on to the OAU . The solution to the cycle of wars lies_in Africa itself and the ultimate responsibility of saving Africa with its leaders . If they are not willing to save their continent , there is little the world community can do .</TEXT>
