   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; DOLLAR SHOWS SOME LIFE ; DOW HIGHER ON IBM SURGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dollar shot_up against the German mark and rose against other major currencies Thursday as Treasury officials and German central bankers spoke out firmly in favor of a stronger dollar . Meanwhile , short-term Treasury_bond yields were higher and the long bond was flat as investors anticipated that the Federal_Reserve_Board will raise interest_rates again soon to contain inflation . At the same time , stocks were mixed , with blue_chip shares pushed higher by IBM and other companies whose second-quarter profits beat predictions by Wall_Street prognosticators . In the most explicit dollar-supportive talk to come_out of the government since the greenback ' s latest descent began a_few weeks ago , Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers said in Senate testimony that a stronger dollar &quot; would have important economic benefits for the United States &quot; and would restore confidence in financial markets . Summers comments came_on the heels of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan ' s statements Wednesday that a weak dollar could ignite inflation . Taken together , the comments did for the dollar what two coordinated buying efforts have failed to do_in recent months : prop_up the beleaguered currency and change dealers ' perception that the government prefers a weak dollar to counter the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance , traders said . &quot; It ' s verbal intervention , &quot; said Kevin Lawrie , director of foreign_exchange at Mellon Bank . &quot; They ' re doing_better with these comments than they did when they were buying dollars. &quot; Traders said Summers ' and Greenspan ' s comments , combined with dollar-supportive statements made earlier in the day by officials of Germany ' s central_bank , reversed negative sentiment against the dollar among many market participants . In New York , the U.S. currency jumped nearly three pfennigs to close at 1.593 German marks from Wednesday . It was one of the largest single-day dollar-mark jumps in several months . The dollar also rallied against the Japanese yen , fetching 99.20 yen , up from Wednesday ' s 98.65. Some traders suggested that the dollar ' s rally was not a one-day event , and suggested that the momentum achieved Thursday could last . &quot; A lot of things came_together at once , &quot; said Chris Igo , international economist at Chase Manhattan Bank . &quot; There ' s been a fundamental change in market sentiment , and there ' s reason to think that we ' ve built a higher base. &quot; In the credit market , the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury_bond closed unchanged . Its price , which plunged 7 / 8 point Wednesday , ended 1 / 16 point higher , or about 63 cents per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . Prices of short-term maturities , meanwhile , dropped from 3 / 32 point to 5 / 32 point and intermediate maturities lost as much as 3 / 16 point , the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported . Analysts attributed the mixed performance to lingering reverberations from Greenspan ' s warning Wednesday that the Fed is prepared to push short-term rates higher if inflation reasserts itself . While there wasn ' t much new in Greenspan ' s comments , the markets had started to assume that with the economy slowing , inflation was tame enough to delay any immediate rate hikes . Yields on three-month Treasury_bills rose to 4.42 % as the discount rose 0.04 percentage_point to 4.32 % . Six-month yields rose to 4.90 % as the discount rose 0.04 point to 4.73 % . One-year yields rose to 5.40 % as the discount rose 0.05 point to 5.14 % . On Wall_Street , the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3 # 732.45 , up 5.18 points , largely on the strength of IBM . Broader market averages were also up slightly . However , declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-7 margin on the New York Stock_Exchange , where volume swelled to 290.80 million shares from 268.04 million on Wednesday . IBM gained 6 1 / 2 to 62 3 / 8 . The computer giant reported second-quarter profit of $ 1.14 a share , about twice what analysts had expected . &quot; The market today is one stock -- IBM . That is the story of the day and the story of the week , &quot; said Lawrence Rice , chief market_strategist at Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross in New York . The Dow ' s gain would have been even better had United Technologies not reported a profit of $ 1.25 per share . Although it was near consensus predictions , investors weren ' t satisfied and the defense and aerospace company ' s shares lost 3 7 / 8 to 62 1 / 2 . Among other companies influenced by positive earnings_reports , Sears was up 1 3 / 8 to 47 3 / 8 and Kimberly Clark gained 1 1 / 4 to 55 1 / 2 . Market_analysts said this quarter ' s earnings_reports have generally been favorable , but investors are skittish about those who fail to meet expectations . Among the market highlights : * Other computer stocks rallied with IBM . Compaq advanced 5 / 8 to 32 1 / 8 , Apple gained 1 3 / 8 to 28 and Dell climbed 7 / 8 to 26 5 / 8 . * AT &amp; T ended_up 5 / 8 to 53 3 / 4 after reporting a 8.7 % jump in revenues . * Integrated Device Technology , a maker of high-performance semiconductors , lost 7 3 / 16 to 18 3 / 4 after it reported a rise in quarterly profit but said it was cautious about its future business . Alex . Brown &amp; Sons downgraded the stock . * Johnson &amp; Johnson rose 1 5 / 8 to 46 3 / 8 . Merrill Lynch upgraded its rating on the health_care products company on Wednesday after J &amp; J posted strong results . * Cerner surged 6 7 / 8 to 32 . The clinical information_systems company posted a strong second-quarter profit , prompting upgrades from several brokerages . Foreign markets were mixed . German stock prices fell , with the DAX 30-share average closing_down 25.35 points at 2 # 113.30 , while Tokyo ' s 30-share Nikkei average ended off 157.84 points at 20 # 622.92. In London , the Financial Times 100-share average ended_up 17.9 points at 3 # 095.1 , while in Mexico_City , the Bolsa index rose 21.86 points to close at 2223.88 .</TEXT>
