   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : EMERGING MARKETS ' TROUBLES MAY PULL U.S. INVESTORS HOME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Return to the First World ? For investors , that may be the clarion call resounding from Mexico ' s deepening financial crisis . As plunging Latin_American share prices worsen an already lousy year for &quot; emerging markets &quot; stock owners , the lower-risk allure of U.S. , European and Japanese securities may grow . Some analysts believe that U.S. stocks and bonds in particular are poised to benefit as Americans -- and other global investors -- reconsider the hazards versus the potential rewards in committing money to far-off and usually illiquid Third_World markets . Mexico ' s stunning currency devaluation and seeming loss of financial stability since last week have been unnerving even to professional emerging-markets investors , because until this year the country had been considered one of the greatest foreign-market success stories . &quot; I don ' t think one can ignore that Mexico was seen as one of the more blue-chip emerging markets , &quot; said Richard T . Saler , manager of the Lexington Worldwide Emerging Markets stock fund . With the Mexican market now down nearly 40 % this year in dollar terms , &quot; To pretend that it ' s not going_to have an impact ( on investors ' attitudes ) is kidding oneself , &quot; he said . It was_on the heels of the Mexican stock_market ' s tremendous 1988-92 gains that emerging-markets investing in_general became fashionable in 1993 , leading to a spectacular surge in purchases of foreign stock mutual_funds . International funds , which took_in $ 5.1 billion in new cash_in 1992 , saw $ 26.3 billion pour in during 1993 . And through October of this year , the inflows kept_up a record pace , reaching $ 26.7 billion . The assets of emerging-markets stock funds alone , which had totaled a mere $ 600 million at the end of 1992 , ballooned to $ 10 billion by last Sept . 30 , says fund-tracker Lipper Analytical Services . But after huge stock gains in 1993 , the continuing inflow of cash into emerging-markets funds hasn ' t been matched by performance this year , despite a summer rally in many of those markets . The average emerging-markets stock fund plunged 12.6 % in the first_half of the year , according to Lipper , as the Indian uprising in Mexico ' s Chiapas state last January and the fallout from rising interest_rates worldwide slammed many Third_World markets . In the summer , a rebound in Mexico and other major emerging markets erased the first-half loss , but the gains proved fleeting . By last Thursday , as other Latin_American markets slumped with Mexico , the typical emerging-markets fund share owner was down 10.6 % for the year . In contrast , the average U.S. stock fund is off about 2.5 % this year , while the average diversified international fund ( many of which invest mostly in major foreign markets ) has lost a mere 1.5 % . * It has been possible to make money in emerging markets this year . But the biggest gainers have been some of the smallest and least liquid of world stock_markets -- places where most mutual_funds would have very little invested . Bangladeshi stocks , for example , are up nearly 114 % this year . The tiny Peruvian market is up about 51 % . On the flip side , the year ' s big losers have included markets that , like Mexico , had been touted as particularly promising in the 1990s : China , where the Shenzhen market index has plunged almost 64 % ; Hong Kong , off 30 % , and Malaysia , which has lost about 19 % . Of course , any investor taking_a_chance in high-risk emerging markets should in theory be prepared_for raucous volatility . What ' s more , the give-back in Third_World stock prices this year has been relatively small compared with 1993 ' s gains : The Fidelity Emerging Markets fund , down 19 % this year , was up 82 % in 1993 . But with this latest and more terrifying decline in Latin_American stocks , some investment pros worry that the public ' s patience is wearing_thin . &quot; What concerns me is that much of the money ( in emerging-market funds ) may have been invested by people who had no idea what could happen &quot; when trouble hits , said Madelynn Matlock , manager of the Bartlett Value International stock fund . Just as a surprising number of municipal_bond fund investors bailed_out of those funds in the wake of Orange County ' s bankruptcy this month , managers of emerging-markets funds worry about a delayed reaction to the Mexican crisis . Fears of heavy shareholder redemptions in international funds in early January have kept the Lexington fund ' s Saler from bargain hunting in Latin markets , he says ; if fund investors begin to exit in droves , the carnage in the Mexican , Brazilian and Argentine markets could worsen . Meanwhile , even though investors have been conditioned to buy when markets plummet , the relative attraction of most emerging stock_markets is dimming for another reason : U.S. stocks , bonds and money_market investments , and their counterpart investments in Europe and Japan , have become much more enticing for global investors . The surge in short-term U.S. interest_rates has lifted the yield on one-year U.S. Treasury_bills to 7.2 % , an extraordinary risk-free return . At the same time , long-term U.S. bond yields -- and European bond yields -- are coming_down as more investors assume that both economic_growth and inflation in 1995 will be moderate . A continuing bond rally could draw_in an increasing number of risk-averse , yield-hungry investors . For U.S. , European and some Japanese stocks , the renewed attraction is the prospect of another gain in corporate earnings in 1995 , with stock prices now at reasonable valuations after this year ' s declines . Indeed , with many First World and Third_World stocks now priced in the same range -- at 11 to 15 times estimated 1995 earnings per share -- investors may logically ask whether the risk inherent in Third_World markets makes them relatively overpriced . In the long_run , there ' s no question that emerging markets should offer higher returns for higher risk . But near term , the message of Mexico may be that the glory days of emerging-markets investing have run their course .
