   <HEADLINE> ' CHALLENGE ' LOOKS_AT WHAT ' S WORKING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Occasionally during his 4 1 / 2-hour report on the state of the nation , Hedrick Smith ' s &quot; Challenge to America &quot; sounds as if it is making a clarion call that has never been heard before . The message , in a sentence : If the U.S. is to stay afloat in the stormy waters of global business competition , the nation must rethink its approach to education , training workers , business and government relations and the free market itself . Anything less , Smith asserts , spells economic and social disaster . The four-part , two-evening report begins tonight ( 9-11 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15 and 8-10 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24 ) and concludes Tuesday ( 9-11:30 p.m. on KCET and KPBS and 8-10:30 p.m. on KVCR ) . The only problem with this is that the themes of long-term planning , teamwork models and public-private sector cooperation are old news , even on television . The late guru of teamwork and corporate restructuring , W . Edwards Deming , sounded forth on the airwaves on just these topics ( though Smith never mentions his name ) . Bill_Clinton , whom Smith interviews in the concluding 30-minute segment , has a secretary_of_labor , Robert Reich , who made the similar-themed &quot; Made in America ? &quot; for PBS in 1992 . What is new here is Smith ' s explicit linking of successful models in Germany and Japan with new American approaches in education , job training and high-technology research . The recent Tokyo stock_market collapse and grinding recessions in both of Smith ' s model foreign countries -- along with equally recent sales successes in the U.S. auto industry -- might seem to undercut the report ' s entire point . But as Clinton himself notes , such up-and-down economic blips shouldn ' t hide long-term structural problems in the American economy . Indeed , Germany and Japan may be_better able to cope_with their downturns , given the structures each country has in place . In the first and second parts ( &quot; Old Ways , New Game &quot; and &quot; The Heart of the Nation &quot; ) , Japan ' s Sharp Corp . is shown outstripping giant RCA in the revolutionary liquid_crystal business , while Japanese and German students appear infinitely more prepared for work than their American counterparts . In part three ( &quot; The Culture of Commerce &quot; ) , it ' s clear that classroom habits have carried_over to the German and Japanese corporate boardrooms -- but with big differences . While Japan provides a corporate &quot; family &quot; of mutual management-worker loyalties , Germany defuses conflicts by bringing labor into the boss ' office , with real voting power . But can any of this translate into American culture ? Smith is warily optimistic , showing in the final part ( &quot; Winning Strategies &quot; ) how Motorola remade its organization and is competing with Japanese products in Japan , and how Ford Motor Co . instilled German-like forms of worker involvement . Even more cheering are the looks_at New York ' s Central_Park East Secondary_School -- using rigorous academic standards and training to produce college-bound inner-city students -- and Wisconsin ' s statewide apprentice program , which rescues mediocre students from hamburger-flipping and trains them for skilled , high-wage work .
