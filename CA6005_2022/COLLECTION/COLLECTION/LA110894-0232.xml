   <HEADLINE> PROPERTY VALUES : A WEEKLY COLUMN BY RON GALPERIN : FINDING THE FUNDS TO FIX QUAKE DAMAGE ; RECOVERY : THERE ARE A RANGE OF LOAN OPTIONS TO CONSIDER , ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE HOMEOWNERS CAUGHT IN AN EQUITY BIND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For many homeowners who suffered damage from the January earthquake , money from federal and state_governments and from insurance_companies isn ' t enough to rebuild -- especially for owners who have a bigger mortgage obligation than their home is worth . &quot; The public funding is just not enough for many homeowners and their problems haven ' t been addressed , &quot; charged Toby Lieberman , project manager at Kosmont &amp; Associates Inc. , a real_estate consulting_company in Sherman Oaks . Many homeowners want to get a loan to do the needed repair work , she said , &quot; but how do you get anyone to help you out when your mortgage is higher than what your property is worth ? &quot; There are options out there , however : * The city of Los Angeles administers six earthquake emergency loan programs . These programs are available as a last_resort when funds available through other federal or state agencies , and from private insurance , are insufficient to repair all_of a property ' s earthquake damage . There ' s a Single-Family Home Program that will provide loans of up_to $ 50 # 000 . Deferred payment loans are available to lower-income families , and in some cases the principal amount is lent with no interest ; in other cases the interest_rate runs as high as 7 % , depending_on borrower income . Another loan program for condominium owners makes available up_to $ 35 # 000 at no interest , with the principal to be repaid over 30 years . Information about these loans is available by calling the Los Angeles Housing Department at ( 800 ) 994-4444 . * The Community Development Commission of Los Angeles County also has emergency repair grants of up_to $ 4 # 000 available and low-interest loans with no monthly payments . These loans of up_to $ 30 # 000 are_due and payable only when homeowners sell or transfer their homes There are many income and use restrictions , but some funds are available to families earning as much as $ 58 # 200 . * Habitat for Humanity has raised $ 2 million for repairing damaged homes and building new ones in the San Fernando Valley , reported Nanci Mavar , earthquake recovery program manager for the nonprofit organization ' s local offices in North Hollywood . Families earning up_to the high- $ 20 # 000 range can apply for loans and grants to buy building_materials . Homeowners then contribute their own &quot; sweat equity &quot; to help in rebuilding -- along with the help of volunteers . Elderly and handicapped residents who may_not be able to get_out and hammer nails can contribute sweat equity by helping_out Habitat in its office or even baking cookies and cooking spaghetti for the volunteers . No-interest loans of up_to 20 years are available through Habitat for chimney demolition , roof repair and replacement , new windows , walls , etc . One resident in Northridge recently got a $ 1 # 700 redwood fence built by Habitat volunteers . The homeowner will pay $ 25 a month until the debt is satisfied . More information is available by calling Habitat at ( 800 ) 266-7047 . * The Southern California Gas Co . is making available about $ 5 million to Southland residents who suffered earthquake damage and need to make minor home repairs . The money is offered through the gas_company in conjunction with several public agencies , including the California Department of Economic Opportunities and the California Conservation Corps . More information about the program is available by calling ( 800 ) 427-2200 . * The city of Calabasas is making available up_to $ 35 # 000 per household for earthquake repair grants . The money comes from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development community development block_grants . These funds are eventually funneled to Calabasas . To qualify for grants , homeowners must have already filed claims with any insurance carrier they may have , the SBA for disaster loans and the state ' s Individual and Family Grant Program . If these various money sources fail to cover all_the damage , a homeowner can apply to the city of Calabasas for a grant . Many other cities also have loan and grant programs . Culver City , for example has grants of up_to $ 2 # 000 available for owners of homes damaged by the earthquake . * Various religious organizations are offering help to earthquake victims . This includes the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles as well as Catholic , Mennonite and other groups . * Many contractors are willing to finance the work they are doing over time , said Lynette Findlay , president of Aberdeen Management Co . Inc. in Burbank and Santa Clarita . She advised home and condo owners to try to find a local vendor who will agree to stretch_out payment for construction and repair work over a period of a year or more . &quot; A contractor couldn ' t ask_for better PR. &quot; * FHA Title 1 home-improvement loans are a good option for many borrowers who are short on equity . These government-backed loans are made through a select group of Federal Housing Administration-approved lenders . With these loans , a borrower can get_up to $ 25 # 000 for acceptable home improvements , and borrowers who want less than $ 15 # 000 can get_it without even getting their property appraised . Title 1 lenders are generally in second position -- that is , behind a superior first lender . Borrowers can use a Title 1 loan to mortgage their house up_to 100 % . With several points_up front as a fee to the lender and interest_rates of up_to 14 % , these are not cheap loans , however . It ' s not as_good_as a conventional second_mortgage , but it ' s generally better than a credit_card . Another limitation to keep_in mind is that these FHA loans can ' t be used on luxuries such_as a pool or spa . More information about Title 1 loans is available by calling the FHA toll-free at ( 800 ) 733-4663 .</TEXT>
