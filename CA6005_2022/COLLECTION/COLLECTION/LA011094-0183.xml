   <HEADLINE> MUTUAL_FUNDS / RUSS WILES : PACIFIC FUNDS LOOK ROSY -- AT LEAST IN LONG TERM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Westerners have been dreaming about the riches of China since before the days of Marco Polo . Last year , they got a nice little payoff . Pacific region mutual_funds leaped 63.8 % in 1993 , with almost half the gain coming during the final three months of the year . Next to gold portfolios , it was the best performance of any mutual_fund category , Lipper Analytical Services reports . Although most of the Pacific funds held little , if anything , in the way of stocks from China proper , the country ' s move toward capitalism was an important reason behind their success . Numerous corporations from elsewhere in the region are doing business in China , lured by the potential of operating in the world ' s most populous nation -- which features low wages , tremendous pent-up consumer demand , a long mercantile tradition , double-digit economic_growth and other advantages . &quot; China is definitely a big part of the investment story for the region , but it ' s certainly not the whole story , &quot; says George Murnaghan , a vice_president at Rowe-Price Fleming International , which serves as investment_adviser to the T . Rowe Price international funds in Baltimore , Md . Excluding China and Japan , other nations in the region will probably log economic_growth of 6.5 % to 7 % this year , Rowe-Price Fleming predicts . China ' s growth could be closer to 11 % , while Japan ' s will come_in at an anemic 1 % to 1.5 % , the firm believes . Such superior economic_growth for the region ( aside from Japan ' s ) is the reason Pacific funds appear to have a bright long-term future . But the more timely question is whether they are currently overpriced given the surge in 1993 . * Thomas R . Robinson , chief international equity strategist for Merrill Lynch in New York , says he is concerned about the region ' s stock_markets today after the sharp rallies of the past few months . &quot; Certainly the ( positive ) long-term story is intact , but I ' d exercise caution right now , &quot; he says . As a sign that the road could be bumpy , Hong Kong ' s Hang Seng index -- which doubled in 1993 -- tumbled 6 % on Thursday , Robinson points_out . Other high-fliers include the stock_markets of Indonesia and the Philippines , whose major market indexes more_than doubled during the year , and those in Malaysia and Thailand , where indexes nearly did so . Another voice of caution comes from Mark Mobius , who runs two emerging-markets funds for the Franklin-Templeton family and heads Templeton Investment Management in Hong Kong . He considers the East and Southeast Asian markets to be vulnerable to corrections , although he hastens to add that it ' s hard to say when these might come . Stock prices in the region have been fueled by low interest_rates , a surge of investment cash from outside the region , a changing view of the risks of investing in Asia -- especially China -- and &quot; simple greed , &quot; Mobius says . &quot; People who don ' t want to miss the boat have a tendency to forget the fundamentals , &quot; he says . Mobius and Robinson say another emerging-market region , Latin_America , looks more promising from a near-term perspective . In particular , Mobius says he has been finding more individual bargains in Brazil , which has largely been overlooked due_to its economic and political uncertainties . Another lukewarm outlook is given by Mark Headley , director of international investments for the No-Load Fund Analyst newsletter in Orinda , Calif . For people who had Pacific fund investments last year , Headley recommends staying_put . &quot; These remain the most attractive growth stories in the world , &quot; he says of the Southeast Asian economies . * But for people thinking_about jumping in now , Headley suggests waiting for a pullback or putting_in money gradually through a dollar-cost averaging strategy . Headley , who has lived_in Hong Kong , says stocks there are especially vulnerable given that they have advanced fourfold in the past half_a_dozen years . He predicts that China will eventually have to apply the brakes to its surging economy to keep inflation in check , and that could cause the Hong Kong market to tumble . Murnaghan takes a more optimistic short-term view of the Pacific region . He points_out that many other stock_markets around the globe are also trading near record highs , despite much slower economic_growth in their home countries . &quot; It ' s dangerous to try to time these ( Pacific ) markets on a short-term basis , &quot; he says . But to mitigate the risks , Murnaghan also urges interested investors to follow a dollar-cost averaging strategy . * T . Rowe Price Associates of Baltimore has introduced a separate group of bond and money-market funds featuring lower expenses and higher investment minimums . The six no-load Summit portfolios will carry expense ratios ranging between 0.45 % and 0.60 % annually -- lower than most competing funds . The minimum investment will be $ 25 # 000 per fund . Boston-based Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group of Valley Forge , Pa. , are two other no-load groups that have special high-minimum , low-expense bond and money-market funds . * How much do mutual_funds pay to trade stocks ? Not much , according to information compiled by Morningstar Inc. The Chicago-based research outfit says the average stock fund pays about 0.31 % annually in brokerage commissions -- equivalent_to $ 3.10 on a $ 1 # 000 investment . Including other operating expenses , fund costs amount to 1.63 % on average . &quot; The fact is that most mutual_funds are cost-effective investment vehicles , even when their trading fees are taken_into_account , &quot; writes Morningstar Analyst Amy C . Arnott . Certain investment categories are more expensive than others , of course . Precious-metals funds have the top brokerage costs of 0.79 % a year on average , followed by foreign-stock funds at 0.60 % and health-care portfolios at 0.54 % . Equity-income funds are cheapest at 0.19 % . Other penny pinchers include financial-services and utilities funds , both at 0.20 % . A fund reveals its brokerage costs in its Statement of Additional Information , a prospectus-like document available on request . Adding Asia If you own a global or international mutual_fund , you probably already have a stake in the hot western Pacific stock_markets . On average , broadly diversified foreign funds have 15 % to 20 % of their assets in these markets . For a more concentrated play , consider some of the following funds . They enjoy better-than-average track records and have large if not dominant positions in Asian_countries other_than Japan . 04 # 28 , 08 # 21 , 16 Fund charge Focus Phone Dean Witter Pacific Growth 5 % Asia ( 212 ) 392-2550 Fidelity Emerging Markets None Asia , Latin_America ( 800 ) 544-8888 GAM Pacific Basin 5 % Asia ( 212 ) 888-4200 G.T.
