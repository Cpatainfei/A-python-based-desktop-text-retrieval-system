   <HEADLINE> SOCCER , SCHMOCCER ; DESPITE U.S. WIN , MANY STILL BORED AND CONFUSED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was 5:30 p.m. at Chillers Bar &amp; Grill in Santa Monica . The Nigeria-Bulgaria World Cup match was beaming down from overhead TVs . At a table by the door , Chris Lehr prepared to explain soccer ' s offside rule to his old college buddy , Kelly Younger . OK , Lehr said , the Heinz ketchup_bottle is the offense and the_French ' s Classic Yellow mustard container is the defense . The daiquiri cups are the goal posts . The saltshaker is the ball . And the pepper ? &quot; The pepper is just hanging out. &quot; At that point , a Bulgarian player collapsed in pain on the field . But the game continued without a pause . &quot; He ' s holding his crotch and they won ' t replace him ? &quot; Younger asked_in amazement . &quot; If that was me , I ' d want to leave town. &quot; Welcome to the world beyond the world riveted to the World Cup . As billions of people across the planet live and breathe each header and back pass -- and scads of Americans perk_up their ears in the wake of the U.S. team ' s stunning upset of Colombia on Wednesday -- many Southern Californians remain confounded , dumbfounded or just plain uninterested . Soccer , some say , is boring because of the low scores and what to the uninitiated seems like a slow pace . &quot; Nothing to nothing means nothing to me , &quot; said Gayle Green , 95 , as he sat at a South Pasadena bar , paying scant attention to a match on a nearby screen . &quot; I ' d watch the Financial News Network before soccer. &quot; Others are curious why goalkeepers insist on dressing differently than their teammates . ( In Spider-Man-style suits , for instance. ) Or are perplexed by the fact that the game doesn ' t necessarily end when the clock seems to say it should . Then there are those who simply can ' t fathom what keeps players from picking_up the ball and just flinging it into the darn net . &quot; Why did God give you arms and hands , &quot; said Westside film editor Richard Boehm , &quot; if you can ' t use them ? &quot; * In staging the planet ' s premier team sports event in the soccer-stupid States , sponsors are hoping that Americans will finally get caught_up in World Cup fever . But midway through Week 2 , evidence persists that , at best , it is a low-grade infection . Take the crowd last week at Gus ' s Bar-B-Q in South Pasadena , a neighborhood joint a_few miles south of World Cup Ground Zero , otherwise known as the Rose Bowl . In the midst of the startling U.S. victory against Columbia , bar patrons craned their heads away from the soccer match toward a second TV to watch the introductions , the introductions , of the players for the final game of the NBA basketball championships . &quot; Basketball is much more comprehensible , &quot; said banker Steve McIntire , 52 . &quot; Everything in soccer seems to be random and accidental. &quot; A_few minutes later , in the waning moments of the match , Colombia scored to narrow the American lead to 2-1 . Even then , McIntire and his drinking partner , Irwin Zolle , remained unfazed when apprised . &quot; This isn ' t basketball , they ' ll need another hour to score again , &quot; McIntire said . &quot; An hour ? They ' ll need two more weeks , &quot; replied Zolle , a financial adviser from Pasadena . In seeking to raise Cup consciousness , no better selling point could exist than the strong U.S. performance . After all , as Gus ' s manager Vincent Lappas puts it : &quot; Americans like sports that they ' re good at . If they don ' t win , they don ' t watch. &quot; Yet rarely has there been a week less suitable for marketing , with soccer having gone head to head with the seesaw New York Knicks-Houston Rockets NBA final , and , of course , the non-soccer story of the century , the O.J. Simpson saga . Indeed , for some national commentators , soccer continues to represent the epitome of ennui . CBS talk_show host David Letterman joked last week : &quot; I think I speak_for millions and millions of Americans when I say : Is the World Cup over yet ? &quot; Or how about the spoof of America ' s lack of soccer acumen in the new soft_drink ad aired before and after World Cup matches ? The PowerAde commercial features multiple sports star Deion Sanders catching a soccer_ball , cradling it in his arms , running downfield , and , after a ref waves a yellow penalty card , pulling_out a pen to autograph it . Among the newly converted , such ribbing may seem sacrilegious . &quot; All I know is you kick the ball into the net , &quot; growled actor / action hero Mr. T as he watched a match in Legends Sports Bar and Rib Room in Santa Monica . A little ignorance doesn ' t necessarily hurt , he suggested : &quot; I didn ' t know all_the rules for football and I had a football scholarship. &quot; * Unquestionably , those monomaniacal soccer fanatics streaming into Old Town Pasadena -- the ones sporting strange birthmarks on their cheeks that at second glance turn_out to be painted flags -- know the rules of the game . Yet even in their midst , one can find holdouts galore . Insurance_broker Gene Whitlock , a luncheon regular at Dodsworth Bar &amp; Grill , admitted that he would rather take a trip to the dentist than to the Rose Bowl . &quot; My feeling is that if they flew me in on a helicopter that landed on the 50-yard line and had me sit in an air-conditioned box , I still would n ' t go , &quot; shouted Whitlock above the din of fans watching a Switzerland-Romania match last week . &quot; I suppose I ' m interested in the United States . But Cameroon ? That sounds like a cookie. &quot; Down the street at a cappuccino bar , Pasadena college professor Gary Mraz gazed at the passing street spectacle and said : &quot; I ' m not interested in sports but this is like going_to a concert where people dress_up to look_like Madonna or Motley Crue . . . . It ' s a fascinating cultural experience. &quot; Farther down Colorado Boulevard at the staid old Pasadena Cafeteria , soccer was the last thing on the mind of attorney Robert Shelley . &quot; I frankly don ' t understand the game and therefore haven ' t watched , &quot; said the industrial accident specialist . &quot; I don ' t know what a free_kick is , although at least I do know there is such a thing. &quot; Similar sentiments were echoed last week across the Los Angeles Basin . &quot; I can ' t understand why they get so excited , &quot; said Juan De Cruz , a marketing representative at the Downtown YMCA . And on the Westside , film editors Boehm and Barry Zetlin seemed bugged about the fashion stylings of goalkeepers . &quot; The color has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the team , &quot; Boehm said while taking a break from cutting an air combat film scene . &quot; Have you noticed that ? The guy is dressed like Robocop . He has pads and everything . I mean , what game is he playing , where ' s he coming from ? &quot; &quot; It ' s like , ' I ' m the goalie , I think I ' ll wear black today , ' &quot; Zetlin said . &quot; Oh , let ' s see , today plaid might look nice . Or like we ' re playing Romania . I know they hate red . I ' ll wear red today . That ' ll rub them the wrong way. &quot; Yet there are some consolations for the soccer-ignorant . &quot; I thought the World Cup was that sailing contest , &quot; laughed Younger after his impromptu soccer / condiment lesson at Chillers . &quot; But at least the drinks here seem to be half price . So there are benefits for those who don ' t like soccer. &quot;</TEXT>
