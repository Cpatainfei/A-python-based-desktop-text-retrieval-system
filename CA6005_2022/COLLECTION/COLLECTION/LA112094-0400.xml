   <HEADLINE> CONFLICT MARKS ENDANGERED SPECIES TREATY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sitting at opposite ends of a cavernous auditorium , under a canopy of flags from around the world , Brazil and the_Netherlands waged a polite but emotionally strained debate over a tree that grows thousands of miles away . The chief delegate from the_Netherlands -- whose Dutch people are fierce rain_forest defenders -- argued that mahogany_trees are disappearing from the tropics so rapidly that trade_in the wood must be restricted . Brazil ' s delegate fervently protested , saying his people should control the Amazon forests . For the 118 nations that gathered_in Florida for two weeks of high-level talks on the environment , which ended Friday , both arguments were persuasive . Ultimately , the government_ministers voted , by a slim margin , to leave trade_in mahogany unrestricted . The conflict over mahogany -- a rich , highly prized tropical wood that graces the living rooms of many American homes -- symbolizes a new direction for the world ' s largest and most powerful conservation treaty , the 21-year-old Convention on International Trade_in Endangered Species . Should its decisions on wildlife be based on science , politics , economics or emotion ? Is it firstly a conservation treaty , or a trade treaty ? For the 124 nations that signed the pact , the answer is increasingly all_of the above . At the core of the debate is one of the most wrenching environmental questions : Which of the world ' s creatures warrant protection ? Already , international trade is prohibited for more_than 600 species from leopard skins and tiger bone to whale meat and rhino teeth . Trade is restricted for 25 # 000 other species . In last week ' s talks , it was evident that more nations are prepared to accept the concept of &quot; sustainable use , &quot; which maintains that if governments are allowed to trade threatened natural_resources , such_as elephants or wild orchids , or the plant used to manufacture the anti-cancer drug taxol , in limited amounts , then they will have more economic incentive to manage such resources in ways that will not drive them to extinction . &quot; It is a critical time for ( the treaty ) , &quot; said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Director Mollie Beattie , the chief U.S. delegate . &quot; I see it moving_into a much more thoughtful mode than it has been in . . . . People have realized that ( sustainable use ) is really the keystone of this treaty . It is a means of having countries help other countries and help themselves. &quot; Sustainable use adds a new twist to the classic battle between the international haves and have-nots . Like any global treaty , the environmental pact known as CITES must navigate the murky and sometimes treacherous waters of international conflicts . Wealthier , pro-preservationist nations , especially in Europe , are often pitted against cash-poor but resource-rich nations such_as Malaysia and Zimbabwe . When the treaty was drafted 21 years ago , trade bans were rapidly enacted as tigers , crocodiles , chimpanzees and leopards slipped toward extinction . But now nations such_as South_Africa , Zimbabwe , Japan , Norway and Malaysia that are vocal supporters of allowing more trade_in protected species increasingly are being heard . The result has been a softening of extremes : Nations that used to demand to be left alone have agreed that they have to manage their natural_resources well today to ensure their future existence . And those that used to support inflexible bans on trade now realize that if countries have healthy economies , they will have more money to spend on improving the environment . Marinus S . Hoogmoed of the National Museum of Natural_History in the_Netherlands said that when he was a delegate in 1979 , many of the nations that gathered were too rigidly preservationist . He heard the first rumblings of a shift in 1992 , and this year in Ft . Lauderdale , many nations voted to ease restrictions that had seemed unthinkable a_few years earlier , he said . &quot; Certain animals are still such a hot emotional item , such_as elephants , that it is nearly impossible to even have any conversation about it , &quot; Hoogmoed said . &quot; But as far as I can see in the European Union , there certainly is an understanding that CITES is a mixture of trade and nature conservation , and you have to have both of them. &quot; Much of the credit -- or blame -- for the easing of restrictions goes_to South_Africa , which has won a lot of converts with its strong efforts to protect wildlife . Johan Neethling , who directs a South_African conservation program , said the right to sustainable use is &quot; vital to the long-term health of this whole organization &quot; and &quot; a principle of paramount importance for conservation in all_of Africa. &quot; South_Africa last week sought support for weakening the global ban on elephant trade , enacted after ivory poaching in the 1980s decimated much of Africa ' s herds . Since its elephants have flourished , South_Africa asked_for permission to sell the hides of 350 elephants per year culled from its overpopulated national_parks , earning about $ 1 million per year it vowed to put into its conservation budget . The effort was rejected . But for the first time , many nations , including the United States and the entire European delegation , were sympathetic to South_Africa ' s request . Their representatives said they would have supported South_Africa if other African_nations weren ' t vehemently opposed because they thought it would increase ivory poaching . However , South_Africa was successful in easing the ban on trade_in white rhinos , a critically endangered species everywhere but in South_Africa . Other new rules allow ranching of sea_turtles and ease restrictions on trade of crocodile skin . &quot; Especially in Africa , some less restrictive regime has to be found , &quot; Beattie said . &quot; What South_Africa has done is break_through what resistance there used to be and bring people around to thinking that Africa can come_up with a long-term sustainable program for its wildlife. &quot; Still , some nations remain skeptical that countries without scientific expertise or adequate law_enforcement can successfully protect their environment . &quot; In some countries , it is very possible . For others , it ' s been a disaster , &quot; Hoogmoed said . Countries with a bad reputation for failing to protect their wildlife from illegal trade are Indonesia , Nepal and Colombia . An estimated $ 5 billion worth of wildlife products per year are legally and illegally traded worldwide , and the profits of the illegal side are thought to be eclipsed only by those of narcotics . Gilbert Simon , director of the_French Ministry of Environment ' s Department of Conservation , said the theory of sustainable use works only when a species , such_as crocodiles , is not very endangered and does not attract high prices . &quot; We , of course , agree on the principle of sustainable development . Everyone agrees , &quot; he said . &quot; But for this century , real sustainable development means strong and strict preservation because it ' s impossible to control poaching . It will not work with elephants or rhino because people can sell tusks for 10 times the salary of the average African . It ' s like drugs. &quot; A Canadian biologist and attorney , Ron Orenstein of the International Whaling Commission , said he &quot; watched with horror the collapse of the world ' s greatest fishery &quot; -- off the Atlantic coast of Canada -- because harvesting that scientists had deemed sustainable depleted cod populations beyond repair . The debate over tropical mahogany marked one of the first times that a product so vital to a nation ' s economy had been considered under the pact . Brazil is by far the largest exporter of mahogany and the United States by far is its largest consumer . A smooth , durable wood in a deep , reddish-brown hue popular for fine furniture , mahogany export is worth about $ 72 million per year to Brazil alone , making_it one of the biggest commodities in the Amazon . The Netherlands had proposed listing mahogany on the treaty ' s appendix 2 -- which does not ban sales but requires exporting countries to keep track of harvests and set quotas that are sustainable in perpetuity . Many exporting nations , including Venezuela , Costa Rica , Colombia and Honduras , supported the listing as a way of helping to conserve their forests . But after failed attempts to strike a compromise with the opposing nations of Brazil , Bolivia and Peru , 50 nations -- including the United States -- voted_in favor of the listing , with 33 against . Because a two-thirds majority is required , the proposal failed by six votes . Nilde Lago Pinheiro , president of the Brazilian Institute for Environment , said it was premature to list mahogany because &quot; we are implementing our own legislation , which is even more rigorous. &quot; She said Brazil has voluntarily reduced exports of mahogany from 174 # 000 cubic_meters in 1989 to 90 # 000 in 1994 . She adds , though , that the Brazilian government has been unable to stem widespread illegal harvesting by timber companies in remote rain_forests . While many mainstream environmental groups , including the World Wildlife Fund , support the pact ' s new emphasis on sustainable use , some animal rights activists believe that it is headed in the wrong direction . &quot; We ' re not opposed to it in theory , &quot; said John Grandy of the Humane Society of the United States . &quot; It ' s just that they don ' t cut it in the real world. &quot; The Humane Society is concerned mostly about a decision to allow trophy hunting of some species such_as rhinos . &quot; If you feel strongly about supporting conservation programs , give them your money . Don ' t kill their animals , &quot; Grandy said . Professor Marshall Murphree of the University of Zimbabwe contends , though , that the international community has a choice of either allowing limited trade or letting it happen anyway , uncontrolled and illegal . &quot; We are all users of wildlife , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s not an issue of whether it will be use or non-use . The real issue is whether that use can be sustainable or we abandon that and let it become unsustainable. &quot; While scientific data on the status of a species is supposed to rule conservation decisions , other factors -- politics , emotions and economics -- play key roles . Many nations were so disturbed by the lack of scientific basis for some decisions that they waged a two-year effort to craft new criteria , which were adopted unanimously last week .</TEXT>
