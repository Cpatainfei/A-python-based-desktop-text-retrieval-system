   <TEXT> Name : Carl Malamud Title : President , Internet Multicasting Service Age : 35 Education : Indiana University ; bachelor ' s in economics and MBA Daily hours on the Internet : four to five Daily incoming e-mail : About 500 messages ( all answered ) Favorite Internet newsgroup : &quot; I don ' t read news . I don ' t like it. &quot; Interests : Reading , music , cooking . His recipe for durian cheesecake was published in the Bangkok Post Last book read : &quot; The History of the City &quot; by Lewis Mumford For more information : e-mail info.radio.com * What Magellan was at_sea , what Roald Amundsen was to Antarctica , what Chuck Yeager was to the sound_barrier , Carl Malamud is to the Internet . Granted , pushing_out the envelope of cyberspace is a little less treacherous than reaching the South_Pole by dog sled , but in his own way , Malamud is no less intrepid an explorer . Among his innovations : He was the first to broadcast a radio program via the Internet , he was the driving force behind the project to bring Securities and Exchange Commission filings to the Internet , and he was the developer of &quot; an experiment in remote printing &quot; that lets you send a fax halfway around the world -- free -- simply by sending electronic_mail to a special address . Malamud , who refers to his nonprofit Internet Multicasting Service as a &quot; cyberstation , &quot; is also a respected consultant and computer networking guru . We caught_up_with him in Las Vegas at the recent InterOp trade show . * Q : What are you doing here in Las Vegas ? A : Well , we run the first radio_station on the Internet . We send audio out . This isn ' t newspaper , this is people sitting in front of their computers and listening . People listen on any personal_computer that has multimedia capability , so that ' s any Macintosh or any PC with a sound card or any high-end workstation . They listen to national press club luncheons , they listen to famous poets reading their own work . We do original programs -- for example , I ' m the host of &quot; Geek of the Week , &quot; a very technical interview show . * Q : Isn ' t &quot; Geek of the Week &quot; available on cassette in bookstores ? Why would anyone want it on their computer ? A : Well , you have to go_to the store and get_it , whereas you ' ve already got your computer on your desk . We ' re not going_to replace audiotapes and we ' re not going_to replace $ 10 radios . On the other hand , our programming stays around forever . You can listen to it whenever you want . You can stop it when a phone_call comes_in . You can pull the piece out that you like and ignore the rest . And so in that sense it is a new medium , and there are occasions in which it makes the most sense to actually listen to something on your computer . * Q : I tried to download one of your radio shows . After an hour and a half , I had about 12 megabytes , which was not quite half the show . I thought , &quot; There ' s something wrong with this picture. &quot; A : You know what ' s wrong ? You ' re trying to run it over 9 # 600-baud modems . And I ' m not saying there ' s something wrong with the 9 # 600-baud modem , but if you ' re trying to get a 35-megabyte file , it doesn ' t make a lot of sense . It ' s like driving a huge truck down a little country road . On the other hand , there are roads out there that are big . There are literally 2 to 3 million people on the core of the Internet , people that have dedicated links , their network manager goes_out in the middle of the night and brings it in , and in turn you have a 10-million-bit-per-second link into your corporate network . All of a sudden it takes a_few seconds to get that file instead of six hours . So you can ' t look_at something and say , &quot; Gee , this isn ' t universal. &quot; When CNN started cable TV and satellite-based systems , people in the country couldn ' t do_it , and people in many areas couldn ' t do_it . But you have to start someplace . What ' s interesting about our medium is the audience that can receive text on the Internet is now 30 million people . And the audience that could receive audio is 2 to 3 million . We ' re not trying to reach everybody , but we do have an audience of about 100 # 000 people in 30 countries . * Q : You have put the Washington , D.C. , restaurant Red Sage on the Internet by providing images from its menu and even a way to make reservations by fax . What was the point of that ? A : This is the beginning of trying to get as_many of the restaurants in D.C. as we can on the Net . The real reason we ' re doing_it is , we ' re a public cyberstation . We ' re a nonprofit . Most of what we do is global in scope -- things like SEC documents and U.S. patents . But we feel that as a Washington-based organization , we have to begin having local roots . * Q : that ' s interesting , because usually the whole idea of something like a cyberstation is that it is no place . It ' s virtual . Net &quot; citizens &quot; can reside anywhere . A : People think_of the Internet as a replacement for real_life , and I think that ' s wrong . Electronic mail is part of the arsenal of things we do as human_beings . It doesn ' t replace the phone , it certainly doesn ' t replace human contact . In fact , it makes human contact easier and better . The same thing with our cyberstation in D.C. Just because we ' re on the Net and anyone in Japan can get_to us doesn ' t mean that we ' re not still human_beings and a part of our community . It ' s not a replacement for the real_world , and that ' s really important .</TEXT>
