   <HEADLINE> U.S. COULD PROFIT FROM FIFA ' S $ 100 MILLION ; SOCCER : STAGGERING WORLD CUP NET EARNINGS COULD BRING ANOTHER TOURNAMENT AS EARLY AS THE YEAR 2010 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States ' chances of staging another World Cup , perhaps as early as 2010 , were enhanced considerably Thursday when FIFA released its financial figures for last summer ' s tournament . Joseph ( Sepp ) Blatter , the general secretary of international soccer ' s governing body , said FIFA made a net_profit of almost $ 100 million from World Cup USA ' 94 . This is over and above the $ 60-million profit already announced by the U.S. organizing committee . According to the FIFA financial report , the tournament produced revenue to FIFA of $ 84 # 304 , 500 from ticket sales , $ 90 # 601 , 644 from television rights and $ 60 # 217 , 500 from merchandising , for a total of $ 235 # 123 , 644 . Expenses involved in organizing and staging the event totaled $ 135 # 434 , 480 , leaving what FIFA termed &quot; surplus receipts &quot; of $ 99 # 689 , 164 . The profit is split , with 30 % going_to the local organizing committee and 70 % to the national soccer federations . The 24 World Cup ' 94 teams will each receive more_than $ 650 # 000 per team for each game played . In the case of the U.S. Soccer Federation , this figure is $ 2.6 million . For FIFA , the 1994 tournament was one of the most profitable , and several organization executives said the World Cup very easily could return to the United States within two decades . A USSF official said 2010 is most likely the earliest the United States will try to stage the event again . The presentation of the financial_statement was one of several noteworthy developments on the final day of FIFA ' s three-day meeting here . In other decisions made by the Executive Committee : -- Africa gained_ground at the expense of Europe in the allocation of additional berths in the 1998 World Cup in France , and the United States ' hopes of qualifying got a solid boost . There will be eight more teams in 1998 , an increase from 24 to 32 . The committee allocated two of them to Europe , which had wanted three ; two to Africa , one to South_America , one to Asia , one to CONCACAF and one to be split between Asia and Oceania . On paper , the extra place for CONCACAF should virtually assure that Mexico and the United States qualify for the next tournament , since they are the strongest teams in the North and Central_American and Caribbean region . -- Joao Havelange , FIFA ' s Brazilian president , announced that he would not seek another term in office when his current one ends in 1998 . By then , he will have led FIFA for 28 years . He suggested that an interim president be chosen from the Executive Committee to serve a two-year term from 1998-2000 , thereby assuring that the election of future presidents will not coincide with World Cup tournaments . -- Japan and South_Korea remain the only candidates to stage the World Cup in 2002 , which FIFA said will take_place in Asia , but the list of hopefuls for 2006 grew to include Germany , South_Africa , Australia , Argentina and Brazil . -- Major_League Soccer is virtually certain to postpone its inaugural season until 1996 , Blatter said . -- The Los Angeles Salsa of the American Professional Soccer League was given provisional permission by FIFA to play for one season in the Mexican second division . However , CONCACAF is expected to veto the move . -- In keeping with the lifting of United Nations ' sanctions against Yugoslavia , FIFA lifted its ban on Yugoslav clubs and the national team for a 100-day trial period . -- Former Argentine star Diego Maradona , banned from &quot; all soccer activity &quot; for 15 months after failing a drug test in World Cup ' 94 , will be allowed to continue coaching Argentine first-division team Deportivo Mandiyu . Maradona does not have a coaching license , but Argentine federation President Julio Grondona said that will be remedied . -- From now on , tied games in the later rounds of all FIFA tournaments will go_to sudden_death , including next year ' s Women ' s World Championship in Sweden , the under-20 World Youth Cup in Nigeria and the under-17 World Championship in Ecuador . &quot; We will call it the ' golden goal , ' not sudden_death , &quot; Blatter said . Games that remain tied after 30 minutes of extra_time will be decided by penalty kicks . -- All leagues and all levels of soccer worldwide will have to award three points for a victory starting next season . Some countries , notably England and Italy , already are doing so . Tied games still will be worth one point to each team . -- Plans are under way to establish a soccer resource center in Neuchatal , Switzerland , where archival material , game films , and other reference material can be obtained . Havelange also said courses were to be offered in all aspects of soccer through the University of Neuchatal , with graduates able to earn a diploma in the sport .</TEXT>
