   <HEADLINE> COMMENTARY ; WHO WILL HOST THE OSCARS ? IT ' S NOT CRYSTAL_CLEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two years ago , when Billy Crystal ' s hosting of the Academy Awards was threatened by a lingering flu virus , the show ' s producer Gilbert Cates made an 11th-hour call to Tom Hanks , asking the actor and sometime comedian if he would take_over if Crystal couldn ' t make_it to the stage . I was following Cates around that year , doing a story on the behind-the-scenes production of the show , and remember how anxious Cates was over Crystal ' s condition . It was Friday , three days before the show , and the host still hadn ' t been able to drag himself to rehearsals . Hanks didn ' t hesitate to say yes , even though he might not know until show day whether he was going_in or not , and as Cates laid the phone back in its cradle , he let_out a huge sigh of relief . &quot; If anybody could save the show , it would be Tom , &quot; he said . &quot; He ' d be a brilliant host. &quot; Crystal made the date , of course , and gave what many critics thought was his best Oscar performance . It was the year that weird Jack Palance did all those one-armed push-ups and Crystal milked an evening ' s worth of gags out of it . Now that Crystal has decided not to return for a fifth year , citing a bad case of host-itis ( he ' s also emceed three Grammys and six Comic Relief events ) , Cates should think_about redialing Hanks ' number and offering him the job , with two months ' notice . The producer ' s instincts were right about Hanks as host : He has charm , dignity , wit , intelligence and , it ' s worth mentioning , he ' s a movie_star ! You would rather have Howard Stern ? Cates and other Oscar officials are being mum about a replacement for Crystal for the March 21 ceremony , though industry insiders know they have been looking_for him or her for more_than a month . Bette Midler , Steve Martin , Whoopi Goldberg and host emeritus Johnny Carson have all reportedly been offered the ' 94 gig and turned it down . Robin Williams would make a great host . He ' s an actor , he ' s funny and everyone loves him . But academy sources think he ' s a bit too wild for 3 1 / 2 hours of live television . Hey , the Academy Awards shows we remember best and fondest are those that almost got_away , and attempts to reign it in and make network executives feel more comfortable have nearly ruined it for everyone else . Hanks , apparently , has not been approached because he is almost certain to be a nominee for best actor for his role as a lawyer devastated by AIDS in &quot; Philadelphia. &quot; There is the feeling among some academy people that it would be inappropriate to have a nominee doing double duty . They should be reminded that their own presenters are often nominees , and that other awards shows have survived the scandal . In fact , Hanks ' association with &quot; Philadelphia &quot; would make his presence as host fortuitous . In recent years , Oscar presenters have been able to don a pink ribbon on their way to the stage , in a Technicolor but silent call_for more AIDS research . Whether Hanks were to win or not , whether he were to even mention the disease , he would be making a stronger statement to the audience than a dozen bows . If not Hanks , who ? Because Johnny Carson had such a successful run as Oscar host , people are inevitably throwing_out the names of TV talk-show hosts Jay Leno , David Letterman and Arsenio Hall . Weirdly , Chevy Chase , the 1987 Oscar emcee , seems to have disqualified himself by losing his night job as a TV talk-show host . The Academy of Motion_Pictures Arts and Sciences ought to remind itself occasionally that though the Oscars show is a television event , the subject is movies . The host doesn ' t have to be a professional wisecracker . Lionel Barrymore did_it one year , so send Jack Nicholson up there . The movie business is in even worse shape than we thought if , for its most important and public moment , it can ' t find a genial host among its own members .</TEXT>
