   <HEADLINE> EASTER ; BEYOND CHOCOLATE BUNNIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Though Easter is usually celebrated in the United States with an endless stream of chocolate bunnies and jelly_beans , there are many other traditions associated with the holiday . Greek and Roman festivals -- ancient antecedents of the feast that celebrates Christ ' s return to life after His Crucifixion and death -- celebrated the passage of winter into the rebirth of spring and have common points with Easter as well as Passover . The rebirth of spring and its fertile promise of the long and prosperous season ahead is_well illustrated by the Sicilian Easter wreath . Its round_shape signifies the continuous passage of the seasons through the year -- in fact , the four eggs that decorate it probably stand_for the seasons . The eggs , of course , symbolize fertility and the replenishing of the earth with animals as well as plants after the dreary winter months . The promise of the harvest to come is seen in the_Swiss rice tart ; throughout Europe , Easter pastries are filled with grains . * In Naples , wheat_berries are used for a similar tart , the grain in all_of these pastries symbolizing the potential of birth and growth inherent in the seeds . Though of more recent origin , chocolate is associated with Easter almost as much as it is with Valentine ' s Day . The association probably came_about when chocolate became more available at the end of the 19th Century and confectioners vied with each other to produce elaborate molded chocolates in the shape of eggs and rabbits -- more symbols of fertility . Chocolate souffle roll is based on a famous recipe originally introduced to the United States by Dione Lucas . Famous as one of the original television cooks in the early ' 50s , Lucas introduced many homey French recipes , such_as this roll , to her audience . The recipe is equally associated with James Beard , who popularized it . * Wreath can be assembled completely and refrigerated up_to one day before baking . Bake the wreath on the day you plan to serve it .
