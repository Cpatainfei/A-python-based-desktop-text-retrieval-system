   <TEXT> Uldis Strelis was 11 when he was arrested during a geography class at school . &quot; They sent five KGB officers for me , a little boy , &quot; Strelis said , amused at the memory . The KGB also arrested his parents and shipped the family in cattle_cars from their native Latvia to a collective_farm in Siberia . A few years after Josef Stalin ' s death in 1953 , the Strelis family returned to Latvia , and today Strelis , 56 , heads the now-independent nation ' s Department for the Investigation of the Crimes of Totalitarianism . One of his first official acts was to arrest Alfons Noviks , the man in_charge of the KGB squad that interrupted his geography lesson all those years ago . Noviks , 86 and Latvian-born , was booked in mid-March , the most infamous catch in a Baltics-wide dragnet for KGB agents and informers from the days when Latvia was part of the Soviet_Union . The hunt has toppled a prime_minister in Lithuania and a foreign_minister in Latvia ; it has fostered accusations against Latvia ' s president , the Estonian president ' s late father and a handful of Latvian congressmen . Judging by the comments of prosecutors , politicians and ordinary citizens , the hunt is growing . As Latvian KGB head from 1941 to 1953 , it is said , Noviks put_to_death so many enemies of the Soviet regime that their blood at times clogged_up the shower drains at police_headquarters . But his fortunes changed with Stalin ' s death ; Noviks fell from power that same year and has spent most of his time since then fishing on a duck pond near his two-story cottage in Riga . Now in jail , he awaits trial , probably this fall , on charges of &quot; genocide against the Latvian people. &quot; That , at least , is what Strelis says . Noviks himself is not allowed to comment on his KGB days , his fishing , or anything else . Strelis won ' t let him meet with journalists , even though Noviks has yet to be tried , much less convicted . &quot; We want him to stay in isolation , &quot; Strelis said . &quot; He should feel punished. &quot; Most Latvians agree . Noviks ' arrest was greeted with quiet approval , and few have risen to the defense of a man whose deeds earned him a reputation as Latvia ' s Stalin . Noviks ' son-in-law is an exception to the chorus of condemnation . His complaint echoes Strelis ' memory of his elementary_school arrest 45 years ago : &quot; They sent men with machine_guns to arrest him . He ' s just an old man. &quot; In the days when the Baltic nations of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania were gaining independence , citizens watched in dismay as smoke poured from the windows of KGB headquarters in the capital cities of Tallinn , Riga and Vilnius : The KGB was destroying files . Many more were secretly sent to Moscow , where they remain . Within a month after Latvia achieved independence from the Soviet_Union in 1991 , members_of_Parliament boldly marched into KGB headquarters to seize a batch of secret files : 3-by-5 cards listing KGB collaborators . Each collaborator had one card , with his name , code name , address and date of recruitment . There were tens of thousands of cards . The cards were carried , in two suitcases and two sacks , to Parliament , where they were put into a safe . Later , they were handed_over to Strelis . They came_to be known as &quot; The Sacks , &quot; and for three years Latvians have wondered anxiously who or what they held . There were also thousands of dossiers on victims of KGB repression . Such files were captured throughout the Baltics -- though many were destroyed or sent to Moscow -- and they are now being made available to victims and their families . Many people in the Baltics are learning for the first time , through these impersonal archives , what happened to relatives who disappeared into the Soviet gulag or were secretly executed . &quot; I want to know what happened to my father , &quot; says one of many letters on Strelis ' desk . &quot; I want to know where his grave is. &quot; &quot; Information on victims is one thing ; files on collaborators are much rarer , &quot; Strelis notes . &quot; Only Latvia has The Sacks. &quot; Latvian law requires candidates for Parliament to sign a pledge certifying that they never worked for the KGB . Following elections in June , 1993 , those pledges were handed_over to Strelis to check . &quot; When we began to verify our 100 deputies in Parliament , &quot; Strelis said , &quot; we found five of them in The Sacks. &quot; One of the five was Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs . Confronted with a 3-by-5 card saying he was agent Ziedonis , recruited in 1963 , Andrejevs became the only deputy to confess . In an open_letter splashed across three pages of Diena , Latvia ' s largest newspaper , he recounted how , when he was 31 and an up-and-coming doctor , the KGB asked him to spy on his colleagues . That evening , Andrejevs told his wife about the agent ' s offer , reassuring her that &quot; I hadn ' t given and would n ' t give any compromising information about her friends or colleagues. &quot; They decided that Andrejevs should play_along ; otherwise , his doctor ' s career would be ruined . Playing_along , Andrejevs wrote , meant filing reports filled with boring nonsense , warning colleagues in whom the KGB had expressed interest , and otherwise behaving eagerly but doing nothing . Even his enemies concede that he became a great doctor who modernized Latvia ' s hospitals and medical_practices . In his letter , Andrejevs begged his colleagues to end the KGB hunt . He argued that The Sacks were far from definitive -- cards could be forged , or dug_up from Moscow files and slipped back into Latvia to serve Russia ' s ends . The hunt for collaborators , he said , &quot; is the greatest absurdity and danger to Latvia . . . ( and ) will be used by various forces to achieve their narrow , short-term ambitions of power. &quot; Parliament stripped Andrejevs of his office in June . Today , according to friends , he spends his days gardening . But his parting letter prompted a long-overdue debate . &quot; Before Andrejevs ' letter , we never had a serious , ethical discussion of our past , &quot; Sarmite Elerte , editor in chief of Diena , explained . Latvia , Elerte said , has learned from the examples set by other countries -- notably Lithuania and East_Germany , which threw open their secret_police files_in 1992 , and were shocked to see heroes , idols and political_leaders tarnished . Even without the famed Latvian Sacks , KGB hunters quickly turned_up a file on Lithuanian Prime_Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene , a leader of the anti-Soviet independence movement . As agent Shatri , she -- like Andrejevs -- wrote academic reports for the KGB on trips abroad . &quot; If such a thing can be called cooperation with the KGB , then all_of us can be accused of cooperation with the Soviet system , &quot; Prunskiene said . In 1992 , she too was stripped of office . Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis , meanwhile , denies charges published in the Russian-Palestinian weekly Al Quds that he was once a KGB informer code-named Hugo . ( The weekly is published in Russian , Arabic and English and has ties to the Palestine Liberation Organization , its Russian editor says. ) The Al Quds version gets oblique support from Andrejevs , who says that his own knowledge of English attracted the KGB ' s interest . As a boy , Andrejevs was taught English by a cousin who usually taught math and physics . &quot; My cousin told me in 1993 that she had only taught English to two boys in her life . The first is known to you , while the second is the current president , Guntis Ulmanis. &quot; Agent Hugo ? Strelis says that ' s not possible . &quot; We would have found his card , &quot; he said . He dismissed suggestions that the card was stolen or sent to Moscow , saying the KGB would have to have been clairvoyant to pay special attention to Ulmanis , who only became president after The Sacks were seized . But Ulmanis ' uncle , Karl Ulmanis , was Latvia ' s president before the 1940 occupation , while Ulmanis himself was a leader in the anti-Soviet opposition . For the moment and with the notable exception of Noviks , Latvian KGB files are being used only to screen politicians . But Latvians foresee a day when legal_actions will be brought against ordinary citizens . &quot; Criminal acts ( indicated in the files ) will be tried under criminal_law , &quot; Elerte predicted . &quot; If I ' ve always wondered , ' Why have I been so unlucky in life ? ' and then , looking through the files , I see that someone who worked next to me all my life took_care of me -- informed on me , ruined my career -- well , shouldn ' t I have the right to demand justice ? &quot;</TEXT>
