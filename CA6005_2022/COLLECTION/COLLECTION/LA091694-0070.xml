   <HEADLINE> PLENTY OF RIPTIDES ON ' WATERWORLD ' SET ; WITH KEY CREW PEOPLE QUITTING AND REPORTED TURMOIL , LOGISTICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS , THE BIG-BUDGET FILM , SCHEDULED FOR RELEASE IN SUMMER OF ' 95 , COULD END UP COSTING MORE THAN ANY MOVIE EVER MADE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two of the entertainment_industry ' s most powerful players , MCA president Sidney Sheinberg and superagent Michael Ovitz , led a high-level contingent to Hawaii last week to inspect personally what is looming as the most costly movie in Hollywood history . &quot; Waterworld , &quot; a futuristic &quot; ' Road Warrior ' on the water &quot; adventure picture starring Kevin Costner and slated to be Universal ' s biggest summer movie of ' 95 , now has a projected budget of around $ 135 million and is already two weeks behind schedule . The movie -- which also stars Dennis Hopper , Jeanne Tripplehorn and Tina Majorino -- is set_in a post-apocalyptic future when polar icecaps have melted and the earth is submerged in water . Costner plays the hero , Mariner , a creature with gills and fins who attempts to lead the surviving good humans to freedom . Directed by Costner ' s close friend , Kevin Reynolds , and being filmed on an elaborate floating set_off the Kona Coast , the production has been beset by turmoil and plagued by logistical and organizational problems , according to interviews with several sources connected to the production . And some key crew_members , including the assistant director and special_effects designer , have quit . Sources characterized the shoot as &quot; extremely difficult , &quot; &quot; chaotic &quot; and &quot; out of control. &quot; One described the production as &quot; a runaway train under water. &quot; Another said , &quot; No one is running the show , and the environment is hostile to the detriment of the film. &quot; When delays and cost_overruns escalated last week , Sheinberg and Ovitz decided to board the MCA corporate jet , along with MCA motion_picture chairman Tom Pollock , Universal president Casey Silver and physical production head Donna Smith and fly to the movie ' s set_on the Big Island of Hawaii . Sheinberg said that while he was mindful that his presence on a set &quot; can have a chilling effect on people , &quot; he came at the personal invitation of Costner and his Universal colleagues . He said it was not unusual for him to visit the sets of the studio ' s bigger productions , as he did last year with Steven Spielberg ' s &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; The MCA chief was invited to the &quot; Waterworld &quot; set by Costner ' s agent , Creative Artists Agency head Ovitz , who reportedly urged Sheinberg to make the trip since the executive had had extensive experience with difficult productions , including the 1975 thriller &quot; Jaws. &quot; Ovitz was there apparently to protect the interests of one of his most important clients , as well as_to run interference with MCA and the filmmakers , who include producers Charles Gordon and his brother Lawrence Gordon , who is not personally receiving screen credit but is actively involved in the production . Sheinberg , who for the first time publicly confirmed that &quot; Waterworld &quot; was greenlit at $ 100 million , told The Times that he was in part prompted to fly to the set because &quot; this is a very big , expensive movie , and I did want to go and see what was going on. &quot; The MCA president said his main purpose in visiting the set &quot; was to be sure everyone was pulling_together in the same direction to get_the_picture made and that delays would be no greater than they had to be . . . it could be the most difficult picture ever made. &quot; After meeting with Costner , Reynolds and the producers , Sheinberg said he was &quot; satisfied &quot; and &quot; very comfortable &quot; with how things were running . &quot; Knock_on wood , I ' m quite pleased with everything I ' ve seen so far. &quot; Sheinberg admitted that &quot; my biggest fear is that the unforeseen will happen with the weather and the water. &quot; But he refuted allegations that &quot; Waterworld &quot; is a production out of control : &quot; It ' s simply not true -- none of it. &quot; Sources working_on the movie , however , paint a grim picture . &quot; Nobody realized the magnitude of the problems with making a movie like this and how the logistics are so impossible , &quot; said one source . &quot; It ' s slow going and setting_up the shots ( on the water ) take forever. &quot; Since the production began June 27 , Universal executives have made several trips to the movie ' s set to try to address mounting problems . Several members of the nearly 500-person crew have either been fired or walked_off the picture , including assistant director Alan Curtiss , who reportedly left over creative differences . Curtiss refused to comment , although an experienced Hollywood filmmaker suggested that when a first assistant director &quot; up and quits , that ' s not a good sign . That means they don ' t like what they ' re seeing and have concluded that all_of their efforts are for naught. &quot; Sources on the set say most of the problems in delays and cost_overruns stem from shooting on water and from the logistical problems of coordinating some 30 boats and a crew that constantly has to be shuttled from the Kawaihae Harbor on the west_side of the island to the set a quarter-mile offshore . &quot; Unlike filming on land , anything you do on water is just more difficult . The wind is constantly changing , &quot; one source said . &quot; If you are lining_up a shot , things are always moving , they are never going_to stay in the same place. &quot; For example , several sources said it took four weeks to film one battle scene in which 125 actors on the floating city were attacked by 50 villains . Hurricane weather in Hawaii , which plagued Universal ' s production of &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; in 1992 , continues to be of concern to the &quot; Waterworld &quot; team , but so far the production has escaped serious damage . Several hurricanes passed_by the islands , creating high swells , but they did not cause any substantial delays , says a source , although hurricane season is not yet over . With the production not even halfway through its shoot , sources say that morale on the set has sunk and tempers have flared . Some crew_members have been targeted as scapegoats . Sources say physical effects designer Peter Chesney and effects liaison Kate Steinberg , who have been with the project for more_than a year , were being pushed off the picture , so they quit in early August . They declined to be interviewed . The Gordons , producer John Davis and executive producers Andy Licht and Jeffrey Mueller also refused to comment on all matters regarding &quot; Waterworld. &quot; Originally scheduled to shoot 96 days , including several weeks of additional effects work and filming in Los Angeles , the movie was to have wrapped by year ' s end , but now is not expected to be completed until early 1995 . The Hawaii portion of the shoot is expected to be finished by late November or early December . If the movie is not completed until January or early February , as some suggest , it could put a big strain on Reynolds to deliver a finished print by Universal ' s hoped-for July release date . &quot; With an investment and picture of this size , you can ' t slam the movie together in the editing room , &quot; says one veteran filmmaker . &quot; You have to have time to test the movie ( with preview audiences ) and go_back and fix what ' s wrong. &quot; Since Universal ' s financial risk is so huge , the studio will want to ensure the movie as much substantial summer playing time as possible . This summer , which tallied a record box-office gross of $ 2.2 billion , delivered more_than a half-dozen films with ticket sales each exceeding $ 100 million . Two of those blockbusters , &quot; The Lion King &quot; and &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; grossed more_than $ 200 million . &quot; Each week you hold a picture beyond Memorial_Day , it costs you summer playing time , &quot; says one industry insider , noting , &quot; On a movie as costly as ' Waterworld ' you want to give it as much time to make back its money and get_into profit as you can. &quot; ( Naturally , there are exceptions to the rule as was the case with &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; which was released Aug . 6 , 1993 , and grossed more_than $ 180 million. ) Universal has not yet officially slated &quot; Waterworld , &quot; but is undoubtedly hoping to release it over the heavy moviegoing Fourth_of_July weekend . But , Costner and Reynolds , who collaborated on 1991 ' s &quot; Robin_Hood : Prince of Thieves &quot; and on the recent , disappointing &quot; Rapa Nui , &quot; are well-known perfectionists who take their time in the postproduction process . Given the lackluster box-office performance of this summer ' s three-hour Western , &quot; Wyatt Earp , &quot; Costner -- one of Hollywood ' s most highly paid stars , undoubtedly has been banking on &quot; Waterworld &quot; to wow audiences next summer . Given the reported length of the script of &quot; Waterworld , &quot; some wonder whether Costner will deliver yet another long movie . He has personally done rewrites on the script , especially the third act , as has Reynolds . Joss Whedon , who did an uncredited rewrite on this summer ' s big action hit &quot; Speed , &quot; also spent weeks on the set polishing the script . Originally scripted by Peter Rader , the movie has gone_through a number of drafts . David Twohy ( &quot; The Fugitive &quot; ) will share screenwriting credit with Rader . One experienced filmmaker noted : &quot; All movies get rewritten during production to one degree or another . But on movies this big and complex , the essential story line and characters need to be locked before the cameras roll -- otherwise the ramifications are huge. &quot; One of the questions MCA will inevitably raise to the moviemakers , suggested the source , is &quot; how this movie ever got going without a script being locked. &quot; Even with all_of its rewrites , production problems and cost_overruns , &quot; Waterworld &quot; has the potential of being a blockbuster , much in the same way that &quot; Jaws , &quot; which also had problems during its filming , became one of the biggest box-office draws of all time . The 1975 movie , which cost around $ 9 million , nearly 100 % over budget , went_on to gross $ 260 million domestically . &quot; Waterworld &quot; now joins Hollywood ' s list of the most costly movies of all time , including this summer ' s Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle , &quot; True Lies , &quot; which reportedly had a $ 118-million price_tag . Sheinberg said he hopes &quot; Waterworld , &quot; which he called a &quot; big , unique action picture , &quot; will &quot; even be bigger than ' Jaws. ' &quot; Based on seeing some dailies of the movie , Sheinberg said , &quot; I really believe this picture has enormous potential . . . . Do I wish it had cost a lot less ? Of course . But I ' d rather have this movie than two ' Havanas , ' &quot; referring to Universal ' s 1990 box-office bomb directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Robert Redford . Sheinberg , who was_on his way to temple to observe Yom Kippur , said : &quot; I ' m going_to pray for ( &quot; Waterworld ' s &quot; ) successful and timely completion. &quot;</TEXT>
