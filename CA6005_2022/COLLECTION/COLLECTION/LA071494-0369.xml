   <HEADLINE> HAITI VIOLENCE WILL GET_WORSE , DIPLOMATS SAY ; CARIBBEAN : HUMAN_RIGHTS OBSERVERS LEAVE . SOURCES BELIEVE MILITARY REGIME WILL CRACK_DOWN ON ARISTIDE SUPPORTERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ouster Wednesday of the international human_rights mission here is the prelude to another wave of violent repression aimed at destroying the last remnants of the opposition before any possible American invasion , diplomats and military sources say . The regime will act ruthlessly , according to this theory , so that any U.S. occupying force would have to turn_to traditional Haitian institutions -- the military and the allied , civilian elite -- because there would be no one else they could rely_on to govern or to run police , security and other necessary state functions , the sources said . &quot; You are going_to see an increase in the systematic elimination of whatever is left &quot; of the loose political coalition established by exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , said a source close to the Haitian military . The source said the regime does not &quot; want to leave_behind an infrastructure that can facilitate an invasion or occupation. &quot; One security expert said the next days and weeks could see a repeat of the bloody repression of the spring and early summer , when the Haitian junta and its armed civilian allies murdered an average of 60 people a month in the Port-au-Prince area alone . Fears that a new bloody wave was developing resulted from the discovery earlier this week of two freshly dug mounds of dirt near the seaside town of Leogane , about 18 miles west of the capital . Some residents claimed the mounds were graves containing the bodies of 12 unidentified men supposedly killed by gunmen when they tried to board a boat that would carry them to the United States . But the reports could not be confirmed beyond a finding by the U.S. Embassy that there were bodies in the graves . Although the past killings involved many ordinary people , most of those targeted were seen by the military as active supporters of Aristide , who was ousted in a bloody military revolt on Sept . 30 , 1991 . Much of Aristide ' s political_movement was destroyed then . But evidently not enough , the sources said . &quot; As soon as they ( human_rights monitors ) are gone , the army will do whatever it wants , &quot; the source said . &quot; They have armed a bunch of civilian supporters , and I expect they will be operating in a big way in Cite Soleil and Carrefour. &quot; Carrefour and Cite Soleil , two dense slums populated overwhelmingly by Aristide supporters , have been the focus of military murders , beatings , rapes and extortion . On Monday , the puppet government of acting President Emile Jonassaint gave the 100 or so human_rights monitors , operating under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organization of American_States , 48 hours to leave Haiti . Without the monitors , who were confined to the capital for the most part , there will be no systematic tracking of human_rights violations . Unofficial scrutiny of human_rights abuses by reporters has been hampered for weeks now under an order from the regime that prevents journalists from traveling outside Port-au-Prince . While that restriction has been largely ignored by reporters , diplomatic and military sources say they expect the army to begin enforcing the ban ; that , in turn , may result in the arrest and expulsion of violators . The monitors and their administrative staff left on an Air France flight Wednesday along with about 170 Haitians approved for refugee status in the United States . At the same time , Air France announced on Wednesday that it was suspending its three weekly flights as of Aug . 1 , as demanded by the United States . All other passenger flights here were suspended June 25 ; with the last Air France flight , Haiti will be isolated as part of U.N. economic sanctions designed to force the military to give_up power . But most diplomats and military experts here don ' t see the military regime leaving , as the international community hopes . &quot; Biamby and Cedras are here to stay , &quot; said a source close to the military , speaking_of Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , the junta ' s strongman , and his chief_of_staff , Gen . Philippe Biamby . &quot; The rest of the officers are sitting on their hands , afraid to move &quot; against the commanders , he said . Diplomats said they also expect the army to step_up harassment of foreigners , particularly news reporters , both to restrict their ability to monitor the bloodletting and to intimidate them so they will leave . When asked if such actions could not be seen as provoking international intervention , one diplomat said the military and its puppet government either don ' t believe there will be U.S. action -- or they don ' t care if there is . &quot; They have successfully resisted ( international pressure ) for 2 1 / 2 years , &quot; he said , &quot; and each day encourages them . They are more assured and more audacious . They think they can do anything. &quot; In any case , he said , the military is actually more unified than before , reinforced by fear that any dissension now would destroy their institution or by the belief that Cedras is right and it would be foolhardy to rebel against him . In Washington , State_Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the Coast Guard picked_up 770 Haitians on Tuesday , bringing the total number to about 20 # 000 since June 15 . Meanwhile , there were reports that U.S. Marines had staged a mock evacuation on the Bahamian island of Great Inagua on Wednesday , practicing the sort of operation they might conduct if ordered to get Americans and others out of Haiti . Military officials said the two-day mission was routine . But some Clinton_Administration officials publicized the drill , apparently as part of the effort to coerce Haiti ' s military_leaders . Times staff writer Norman Kempster in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
