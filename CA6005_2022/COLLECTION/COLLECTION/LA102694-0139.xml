   <HEADLINE> COURT DOUBLES JUDGES HEARING FELONY CASES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fearing that defendants will be freed because their cases are taking too long to get_to court , Ventura County judicial officials said Tuesday that they will double the number of judges hearing felony trials . The move , which would reassign judges now hearing civil cases , is designed to head_off what local court officials say could be a potential disaster : Without the extra jurists , they might be forced to cut loose some criminal defendants . To prevent such a scenario , the number of judges hearing criminal cases is being increased from five to 10 , Superior_Court Presiding Judge Melinda A . Johnson said . Under the new system , the criminal caseload should be reduced to a manageable level within three weeks , she said . &quot; This is sort of a crisis situation , &quot; she said . Felony cases awaiting trial in the county have reached an all-time high of 230 , officials said . Some judges have more_than 50 trials scheduled for their courtroom , Johnson said . Under state law , criminal charges must be dismissed against defendants who are not given a trial within 60 days of arraignment , unless they waive their speedy-trial right . Prosecutors said they believe some defendants are refusing to accept plea negotiations in the hopes that charges will be dropped . But authorities would shut_down the entire civil section of the court before allowing that to happen , Johnson said . * Officials said they also are worried about the enormity of the court ' s civil caseload . As of two weeks ago , 6 # 579 civil cases -- some dating_back to July , 1989 -- were awaiting trial in the county , Assistant Executive_Officer Vincent Ordonez said . Although Johnson said she does not want to give short_shrift to civil cases , which involve disputes of $ 25 # 000 or more , she stressed that criminal cases must take priority . Under the new system , Johnson said the five civil judges will be assigned criminal trials as soon as the cases are ready for jury selection . If no criminal cases are ready , the civil judges will stick_to their normal assignments , she said . &quot; We ' re not going_to have any judge sitting around waiting for a criminal case , &quot; she said . Of the 14 elected or appointed Superior_Court judges in the county , two work in Juvenile_Court and two in Family Court . The other 10 had been divided between civil and criminal cases . * Officials disagree on the reasons for the sudden glut of criminal cases in Ventura County . Johnson said the tough-on-crime &quot; three strikes &quot; measure is one culprit . She also cited the passage in November of Proposition 172 , which increased funding to police , prosecutors and other law-enforcement agencies . Because of those two factors , &quot; We ' ve just have a lot of cases that piled_up as time has gone_by , &quot; Johnson said . Additionally , she said , two of the five Superior_Court judges now hearing criminal case are tied_up in lengthy trials and unable to help reduce the caseload . But Chief Deputy Dist . Atty . Kevin J . McGee said prosecutors do not believe that the three-strikes law -- which calls_for prison sentences of 25 years to life for some repeat felons -- has been a burden for the local court system . McGee said his office had only filed nine three-strikes cases through the end of September . Prosecutors had also filed about 60 two-strike cases -- which double some criminal sentences , McGee said . About one-third of those cases did not go_to trial , thanks to early guilty pleas . * &quot; I don ' t think we can say that ' three strikes ' has anything to do with our local situation , &quot; McGee said . McGee attributed the increased criminal caseload in part to the county ' s growing population and the resurgence of the drug methamphetamine . Whatever is behind the growth in criminal_court cases , prosecutors and defense_attorneys said the court is right to assign more judges to deal with them . &quot; The court is taking prudent action in light of the fact that the ( criminal ) inventory has grown considerably , &quot; McGee said . Public_Defender Kenneth I . Clayman also lauded the new system . &quot; It just seems to me that they are doing what they need to do to get the work done , &quot; Clayman said . But Clayman denied that his attorneys have tried to take_advantage of the judge shortage by advising clients against early guilty pleas in hopes of getting charges dropped . He did say , however , that with the new tougher laws , &quot; any conscientious lawyer is certainly going_to ask_for more trials. &quot;</TEXT>
