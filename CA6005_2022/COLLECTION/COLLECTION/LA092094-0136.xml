   <HEADLINE> PLAN TO FORCE DEVELOPERS TO PAY FOR TREE PLANTING , MAINTENANCE DEBATED ; LANDSCAPING : BACKERS SAY THE PROPOSAL IS NEEDED TO COVER HIGH COSTS OF UPKEEP . THOUSAND OAKS BUILDERS OPPOSE THE ADDITIONAL FEES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Trying to build_up their urban forest , Thousand Oaks council_members tonight will consider requiring developers to plant trees along city streets -- and then pay to trim , water and nurture them . The proposal , designed to keep city streets shaded and graceful , is contained in a new document known as the Forestry Element to the General Plan . The thick report also calls_for private donations to a so-called tree trust or tree endowment_fund , to cover the growing costs of maintaining city landscaping . &quot; The forestry master_plan is an effort to give a value to our community forest so it can be enhanced and protected , &quot; Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski explained . &quot; After all , this is Thousand Oaks. &quot; But some developers think the pro-bark plan carries too_much bite . Trees on city sidewalks should be the city ' s responsibility , they argue . Developers building on vacant_lots already pay $ 129 per parcel in tax each year to maintain landscaping , and most are opposed to shouldering additional costs . &quot; It ' s unfair , &quot; developer George Connor said . &quot; I see us being responsible_for the plantings on our property . But we had to plant some oak_trees on the sidewalk , and those trees got all bent over . They need to be straightened with a professional job . It ' s the city ' s responsibility , not the developer ' s to pick them up. &quot; Connor , who owns several shopping_centers along Thousand Oaks Boulevard , expressed another concern as well : Too many trees could block small shops and make_it tough for retailers to draw customers . He especially worries about a provision urging enforcement of a recent city law requiring that at least 50 % of a parking_lot be shaded by trees . &quot; A lot of our tenants have been kicking and screaming about it , &quot; said architect Francisco Behr , who is designing a project for the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Newbury Park . &quot; They ' re very concerned about visibility. &quot; Shading half of that project ' s 3 # 000 parking stalls will cost more_than $ 1 million , Behr said . The Forestry Element also covers other ground , establishing dozens of basic policies about how Thousand Oaks should treat its trees . The plan calls_for : * Promoting neighborhood forestry plans . Using tree plantings to create community identity . * Requiring permits for all tree pruning on public land and commercial and industrial properties . * Phasing_out grassy medians and replacing them with mulch and drought-tolerant plantings . * Encouraging the use of native plants and experimental species . When a draft of the Forestry Element was circulated last year , the document contained several proposals that council_members deemed too Draconian -- including a citywide tax to maintain trees . The latest draft omits that proposal and scratches a plan to count every tree in the city . But Councilwomen Zukowski and Elois Zeanah said they would like to revive the inventory idea , calling it vital to create a record of the city ' s urban forest . &quot; What good is a master_plan , and how can the city enforce it , if there is no inventory ? &quot; Zeanah asked . Public Works Director Donald Nelson said he does not know the cost of counting every tree in the city . But he wants to build a computer record of every tree on city property to keep tabs on maintenance procedures , he said . Once that computer count gets going , many city officials expect it to keep growing , as more trees sprout in Thousand Oaks . &quot; Planting a tree is indicative_of your belief in the future , &quot; Councilwoman Judy Lazar said . &quot; I can ' t say enough in favor of trees. &quot;</TEXT>
