   <HEADLINE> MAJOR_POWERS AGREE ON TERMS FOR BOSNIA PEACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States , Russia and the European Union on Friday launched a new effort to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina , calling_on the factions there to agree to a four-month cease-fire and a 51 % -49 % split of the republic ' s territory . Setting_out for the first time an agreed-on statement of the peace terms they will seek , the big powers also said they will begin lifting U.N. economic sanctions on Serbia , the Bosnian Serbs ' chief ally , once a Bosnian settlement is being implemented . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , speaking after a six-hour meeting with the foreign_ministers of Russia and five Western European_countries , said the governments are all determined &quot; to try to put this awful war to an end. &quot; Christopher said they were summoning Bosnian Serb , Croatian and Muslim negotiators to talks within two weeks to begin working_on details of a cease-fire and a new round of peace negotiations . The statement -- signed by the United States , Russia , Britain , France , Germany , Belgium , Greece and the European Union -- marked the first time in more_than two years of attempts to end the Bosnian war that the major_powers have agreed on so detailed a framework for a settlement . But after two years of diplomatic failures , both American and European officials concluded that they could only succeed if they buried their differences -- and brought_in Russia , which has acted_as a great-power protector of its longtime allies , the Serbs . Until now , British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said , &quot; there ( have been ) divisions . . . among those who have been seeking to achieve a negotiated peace -- divisions across the Atlantic between Europe and the United States , divisions between the West and Russia , divisions between NATO and the U.N. The main purpose of this meeting has been to create and sustain a united diplomacy. &quot; To that end , the foreign_ministers produced a three-page statement that emphasized their determination to convene peace talks , spelled_out basic terms for a settlement , artfully glossed_over some of the issues that have divided them in the past and did not say what they would do if any of the Bosnian factions failed to respond . Their statement calls_for a settlement that divides Bosnia into two republics -- one Serbian , one a Muslim-Croatian federation -- with an undefined constitutional link . It would give the Bosnian Serbs 49 % of the republic , leaving 51 % for the Muslims and Croats . The Bosnian Serbs now hold about 70 % of Bosnia . Russia for the first time endorsed those percentages , which Bosnian Serbs have rejected , diplomats said . The Muslims and Croats have accepted the 51 % figure , although they have said they believe that they are entitled to more and have been negotiating over which land they should receive . The offer to begin lifting sanctions on Serbia once a peace agreement is in_effect was an apparent concession by the United States , which had earlier resisted holding_out such a carrot to Belgrade without more conditions . Russia and some European governments had argued that offering to lift some sanctions as soon as a peace agreement was signed would induce the Serbs to be more flexible . &quot; Good-faith implementation of a peace settlement that includes provisions for withdrawal to agreed territorial limits will lead to phased suspension of the sanctions , &quot; the statement said . Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev praised the statement ' s &quot; clear link between the peace process and a removal of sanctions , &quot; and he suggested that it would appeal_to the Serbs . A senior American official said the Clinton_Administration had not changed its harder-line position of demanding significant territorial withdrawals and cooperation with war_crimes tribunals before the sanctions could be lifted . But he acknowledged that those conditions were left_out of Friday ' s statement -- to ensure that agreement could be reached . Christopher and the other foreign_ministers said they do not know whether their new approach will work . &quot; It may_not succeed , &quot; Hurd said . &quot; But we all felt that we had to make that effort . . . because the prospects for the future are dangerous. &quot; Christopher said he believes that the Bosnian Serbs and other factions will come_to the new peace talks . &quot; We think that they must recognize , as does the entire world , the need for a negotiated settlement , &quot; he said . There was no immediate reaction from the Bosnian Serbs or the Muslim-led government . But American officials said they had already outlined the allied plan to the Sarajevo government , which approved . A senior U.S. official said that if the parties respond , a formal &quot; cessation of hostilities , &quot; including a cease-fire and withdrawal of forces from the front_lines , could be in place within six weeks . The foreign_ministers called_for a four-month cessation of hostilities because the Bosnian government feared that a permanent cease-fire would freeze the territorial lines where they are , in_effect giving the Serbs control over the 70 % of Bosnia they hold . If the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims don ' t cooperate , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe warned , his country may pull_out of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia -- a move that could cause the entire force to collapse . And if the Bosnian Serbs don ' t respond , Christopher said , the Administration will feel more pressure from Congress to lift the U.N. arms embargo against Bosnia . The Senate passed a resolution Thursday giving President Clinton a mixed message about breaking the embargo , a step Clinton has refused to take .</TEXT>
