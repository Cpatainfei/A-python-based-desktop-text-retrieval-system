   <HEADLINE> NEXT STEP ; MEXICO ' S PRI AT CRISIS POINT : WILL IT CHOOSE DEMOCRACY ? ; COLOSIO ' S KILLING AND THE CHIAPAS REVOLT HAVE SHAKEN THE POLITICAL JUGGERNAUT AS NEVER BEFORE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The last time a virtual president was assassinated in Mexico , the course of the country ' s political history was changed forever . The year was 1928 . A religious fanatic , gaining access by impersonating a cartoonist , shot and killed President-elect Alvaro Obregon . To guarantee the ruling elite ' s hold_on power in the wake of Obregon ' s murder , strongman Plutarco Elias Calles the next year decreed into existence the vast , all-consuming political_party that has governed Mexico ever since . Last week ' s assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio , who as presidential candidate for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party was the heir_apparent to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , has once again plunged Mexico into the kind of pivotal crisis that could spell long-sought political progress -- or political disaster . Colosio ' s death in Tijuana at the hands of a young gunman is the most shocking in a series of recent events that have driven wedges into the solidarity of the PRI , as the ruling party is known . They have exposed a vicious internal debate and underscored the failure of the party to adopt truly democratic reforms . Still reeling from a bloody peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas , the PRI , and the party-state system through which it has controlled Mexico for 65 years , are under threat . Even within the party , the voice of dissent has swelled as never before as young , disaffected members are breaking ranks and challenging the hierarchy . Senior party leaders , struggling to contain the crisis , are emphasizing the party ' s position as the one Mexican institution that has traditionally guaranteed stability and order . &quot; In the PRI , there is loyalty , &quot; Party Chairman Fernando Ortiz Arana said last week . &quot; There is loyalty to the ideals of democracy and liberty that the party proposes . There is loyalty to the president of the republic , Carlos Salinas de Gortari , as the keeper of national trust and guarantor of rule_of_law and justice. &quot; After years of lip_service to the need for democracy , the trauma of the murder of Colosio may be the catalyst that forces the PRI to change , analysts say . But some observers say it is just as likely that the party , besieged and fearful of facing a disgruntled electorate on a_level playing_field , may instead close ranks and retrench . The drama will be played_out in coming months . &quot; This is a profound crisis that does not seem to have any alternative for the governing group other_than an authoritarian hardening , or an acceptance that Mexico must move toward democracy , &quot; said political_scientist Luis Javier Garrido , a prominent critic of the PRI . Calles founded the National Revolutionary Party in 1929 , and its name was changed to the current Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1946 . From the outset , the party was designed to incorporate -- in some cases , co-opt -- hundreds of tiny parties and movements that emerged from Mexico ' s 1910 Revolution . Waving the banners of social justice and anti-imperialism , the PRI became an organization based on tightly controlled sectors -- labor , peasant farmers , bureaucrats and , until the 1940s , the army -- where members are kept_in line through a paternalistic system of patronage , where corruption flourishes and where decisions are made at the top with little input from the bottom . Thanks in part to a sophisticated system of what observers call brazen vote fraud , the PRI has won every national election and most regional elections since 1929 . The Congress , the judiciary system and most of the press are controlled or at least heavily influenced by the PRI . Perhaps the single most anti-democratic tendency of the party is the presidential succession . Each president , as he nears the end of his six-year term , names an heir_apparent . And each time , that man is elected president . The killing of Colosio , then , was not just the elimination of a candidate but the murder of the man everyone expected to be the next president . Much of Mexico for many years readily accepted the system , sacrificing participatory democracy for a semblance of stability and peace . But that part of the equation -- stability and peace -- seemed to dissolve this year when rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation Army seized a string of towns in Chiapas , demanding justice and social equity for some of Mexico ' s most impoverished people . Suddenly , the myths of a &quot; modern Mexico &quot; -- the myths that Salinas used to catapult Mexico into partnership with the United States and Canada in the world ' s largest trading bloc -- were dashed . The credibility of Salinas , and the PRI , were called into question , deepening an already festering crisis caused by opposition in many circles to Salinas ' free-market economic_policies and the persistent cry_for democracy . Now , say analysts , simple reform may_not be enough . A New Chorus for Change Mexico , economist Luis Rubio said , must &quot; build a new political_system based on radically different assumptions . The current political_system is based on the objective of stability and governability on the basis of control . We need stability and governability on the basis of participation. &quot; People who hold political office must be made accountable , he said . The political process must be completely redefined , eliminating the privileges that the political class traditionally has enjoyed , and new parties , based on ideologies rather than on factions , should be created and patterned after parties in most Western democracies . In other words , Rubio and other analysts said , defusing the crisis this time will require concrete steps toward democratization , not the largely empty political promises that Salinas has made while keeping his focus_on economic reform since his 1988 inauguration . &quot; President Salinas has already had two dramatic warnings to remind him that democracy is the best way to attenuate the costs of destabilization . There may_not be a third chance , &quot; said Carlos Ramirez , an editor of the independent El Financiero newspaper . &quot; The death of Colosio represents a political challenge of enormous magnitude . It is not about rebuilding the popularity of a government that sees its happy world crumbling into pieces . This is about advancing in the construction of a political_system that restores the faith of the Mexican people. &quot; The calls_for reform within the PRI and , by extension , throughout Mexican political society , are not new . There have always been fledgling reform_movements that are allowed to go just so far , before they are bought_off , co-opted or crushed . They struggle against the &quot; dinosaurs &quot; of the party , the traditional sectors such_as the decision-making National Political Committee , which fight any erosion of their considerable power . The central agenda of the dissidents has not changed much : separation of party from state ; clean elections ; internal consultation on candidates for public office . The first dissident movement within the PRI was formed in August , 1986 , by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , the son of a revered former president , Lazaro Cardenas , who is remembered for nationalization of the oil_industry and massive agricultural reform that gave land to landless peasants . The younger Cardenas advocated change from within , but , utterly frustrated , resigned from the party in 1987 . The next year , Cardenas challenged Salinas , the PRI ' s candidate , in presidential elections that many Mexicans believe Salinas won only through widespread fraud . Cardenas has since formed his own party , the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party , and will again compete against the PRI candidate in the August presidential elections . After Cardenas left the PRI , the banner of internal dissent was taken_up by Rodolfo Gonzalez Guevara , who in late 1987 formed the Critical Current faction within the PRI . Three years later , he too left , giving_up on the notion of democracy inside the PRI . As PRI chairman in 1990 , Colosio proposed a radical reorganization of the party , eliminating the power-based factions and encouraging individual party memberships that could incorporate new groups that do not fit into the existing PRI structure . He framed the reform as a matter of survival : In the four decades since the last significant party restructuring , most Mexicans have moved from the farm to the cities , the unionized share of the work_force has dropped , and Salinas ' free-market policies are creating a new class of entrepreneurs . The PRI , heavily weighted toward official unions and peasant farmers , no longer reflected Mexican society . Labor and peasant leaders , whose power is based on steep pyramids of the traditional hierarchy , blocked the changes . Even the top-down attempt to change achieved only a nominal strengthening of the state-level party organizations , which are controlled by local bosses tied to longtime PRI leaders . The push for reform was then assumed by a group of mostly young PRI militants . Taking_advantage of the taint on the Salinas presidency because of his questioned electoral victory , the new movement , called Democracia 2000 , became vocal advocates of greater participation . They vowed not to desert but to fight from within . &quot; Young people who want to get_into politics in Mexico and change this country have two options : the PRI , and the PRI , &quot; said Josue Romero , a member of the movement . Their efforts culminated last October and November , just before Salinas named Colosio as the PRI candidate , when they staged rallies in the public plazas of about 500 cities and towns across the country , agitating for honest elections and popular participation . Then , said Ramiro de la Rosa , political action secretary of Democracia 2000 , the harassment and death threats began . Fidel Velazquez , the 93-year-old labor_leader and one of the most rigid party hard-liners , demanded their expulsion . De la Rosa , 25 , was not deterred . &quot; Why haven ' t they expelled us ? &quot; he asked_over coffee at a Sanborn ' s across the street from the mammoth PRI headquarters . &quot; Because it would expose them . It would show that they don ' t want to change . They know that if they expel us , we would laugh . We would name names . Are the corrupt ones going_to expel us ? &quot; The Troubles Within PRI One sign of the rapid unraveling of the PRI is the evaporation of its vaunted party discipline . In part , the lapses reflect the effort to incorporate into the PRI new groups that seem to be natural constituencies because they have benefited from the Salinas Administration ' s free-market policies . However , those new prospects often do not share the longtime members ' standards of loyalty and appreciation . Last year , for example , PRI stalwarts hosted a dinner for prominent businessmen who had purchased formerly government-owned companies or had other financial dealings with the government . They were asked to contribute millions of dollars each to a fund that would become an endowment for campaign financing . But instead of coughing_up the cash , several infuriated dinner guests leaked the story to the press , setting_off a scandal that forced the party chairman to resign . The trend away from discipline is spreading . Militants are breaking rank in unprecedented numbers and with unprecedented fervor , first with the Zapatista rebellion and now with the Colosio murder . They openly criticize . They challenge . Some even go so far as_to publicly blame the Salinas government for the assassination , suggesting Colosio ' s purported insistence on honest elections may have cost him his life . &quot; The lack of pluralism and democracy , and the lack of respect for what a party is , have produced this whole situation of violence , which will not end here , &quot; de la Rosa said energetically , ignoring his companions ' admonitions to tone_down his comments . &quot; We are at the beginning of a long night for this country , a night that can be stopped if Salinas can be made to understand that it is no longer a matter of simply fulfilling his will in Mexico , but allowing the will of the people of Mexico to be fulfilled. &quot; The tumult within the party was evident again over the weekend . Flying in the face of the traditional selection process , party rank-and-file and mid-level leaders began to talk publicly about who they wanted to see as the next presidential candidate . Democracia 2000 began demanding that a convention be held to name the candidate . Quickly , the party hierarchy issued a statement &quot; disauthorizing &quot; any statements by anybody connected with the PRI . Democracia 2000 responded , issuing its own &quot; disauthorization &quot; of the party leadership . Another rift within the party was aired before Colosio ' s death . Manuel Camacho Solis , a former Mexico_City mayor passed_over by Salinas as the PRI candidate , was named by the president as a special mediator to handle the Zapatista uprising . Camacho Solis ' success in that position fueled speculation that he would try an independent bid for the presidency , conjecture that increased when Camacho Solis refused to toe the party_line and publicly support Colosio . Finally , Camacho Solis relented , saying he would not run_for president . His announcement came one day before Colosio ' s killing , and many party stalwarts are very resentful of his reticence . He was booed when he appeared at Colosio ' s wake -- regrettable , say supporters , because Camacho Solis , like Colosio , backed democratic reform . The reform-minded Priistas admit that they have not gotten very far . Under Salinas , there has been just a smattering of democratizing measures . The party statutes were changed in 1988 , when Colosio headed the PRI , to allow some popular consultation on the selection of local candidates . And just last week , Congress passed a package of electoral reforms that raises fines for fraud and reduces PRI influence on the committee that oversees elections . Yet in both these cases and others , dissidents see the changes as largely cosmetic . The divisions and emotions within the party now appear to run so deep , analysts say , simple cosmetics may no longer do the trick . &quot; In six years of work . . . we have failed in making the PRI change , that is true , &quot; said de la Rosa . &quot; Where we have not failed is in helping make civil society stronger and better informed . People don ' t swallow the lies so easily any more. &quot;</TEXT>
