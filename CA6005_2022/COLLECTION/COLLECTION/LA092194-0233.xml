   <HEADLINE> LAWYER BLAMES CLIENT ' S AMNESIA FOR 2 SHOP KILLINGS ; COURTS : DOUGLAS STANLEY , 58 , OF WESTMINSTER IS ACCUSED OF SLAYING HIS SISTER-IN-LAW AND A CO-WORKER . PROSECUTION CONTENDS THAT GRUDGES -- NOT MEDICAL CONDITIONS -- LED TO 1993 SHOOTINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Westminster man was suffering from a form of amnesia triggered by stress and a bad heart when he gunned_down his sister-in-law and another woman in July , 1993 , and then fled to Colorado where he was later captured , a jury was told Tuesday . The unusual defense was revealed during opening statements in Orange County Superior_Court as trial began for Douglas F . Stanley , 58 , who faces life in prison without parole if convicted of killing Joyce Stanley and Terry Vasquez at the Fountain Valley embroidery shop where the three worked together . Prosecutor Robert Molko told jurors that Stanley plotted the killing because of longstanding grudges against the women , and blamed his sister-in-law for his estrangement from his daughter . He also did not like having the two women as his supervisors at the business , which was owned by Joyce Stanley , 52 , Molko said . But as Stanley sat impassively , his head cocked to one side , Deputy Public_Defender Denise Gragg told the jury that her client could have not premeditated the killings -- a factor needed to prove first-degree murder -- because the brain damage he was suffering rendered him unaware of his actions . &quot; He is in , essentially , a stroke &quot; at the time of the shootings , Gragg told jurors , adding that her client began suffering &quot; transient global amnesia , &quot; and only snapped out of the trance-like state when he found himself driving his sister-in-law ' s car in Colorado . For the first time , the trial ' s opening arguments offered some insight into the July 8 , 1993 , shooting , which sparked a nationwide manhunt for the fleeing suspect . Stanley was captured July 11 , after a gun fell out of one of his pants_legs while he was talking to a Colorado state_trooper . Family tension dates_back at least to 1991 , the prosecutor said . The defendant ' s brother and sister-in-law , Charles and Joyce Stanley , sought guardianship of the defendant ' s daughter , Lisa , at that time , because of Douglas Stanley ' s transient lifestyle . Although he did not fight the guardianship , he blamed Joyce Stanley for his poor relationship with the girl , Molko said . &quot; He never forgave Joyce for what he termed ' taking Lisa away from him , ' &quot; said Molko , who told jurors that the defendant boasted to a friend shortly before the killings that he was finally about to get his revenge . He also called a friend after the killings and bragged &quot; I did_it ! &quot; Molko said . In an ironic twist , the victim seemed to care about the defendant . Joyce Stanley nursed the defendant back to health after by-pass heart_surgery about a year before the killing and was constantly urging him to take_care of himself , Molko said . * In an apparent effort to undermine defense contentions about Stanley ' s diminished capacity , Molko also stressed in his opening statement that Douglas Stanley withdrew a large sum_of_money from the bank shortly before the killing , repeatedly lied_about his involvement in the slayings , and successfully eluded authorities for several days . Friends described Stanley as a &quot; survivalist &quot; type who collected guns and made_it a habit to threaten people who angered him . Gragg told jurors those were hollow threats , and noted that relatives never feared Stanley in the past . But there is at least some evidence , according to the prosecutor , that relatives shied_away_from confronting the defendant . Joyce and Charles Stanley were planning to move their business out of state and secretly bought a house near the new location . They were taking Douglas Stanley with them to a new apartment , but then planned to move to the new house and leave Douglas Stanley behind , Molko told jurors . Stanley also was angry because he believed Vasquez knew more about the relocation arrangements than he did , Molko said .</TEXT>
