   <HEADLINE> COUNTERPUNCH : LET ' S LET THE KIDS GET_ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As leaders of the electronic_communications industry , politicians and media pundits conjure images of the coming information superhighway , the only people left_out of all this talk are those most likely to be its first travelers -- kids . As tomorrow ' s users of the new technology , kids are already telling us they won ' t be satisfied with programming like &quot; Gilligan ' s Island &quot; on demand and a bunch of souped-up shopping channels . They are asking us for more . And it is time that we listen . This isn ' t the first time business_leaders have overlooked the needs of kids in charting the course of technological change . The $ 7-billion video_game industry was spawned by kids ' curiosity , sense of self-discovery and instinctive grasp of electronic technology . But the industry has ignored those very attributes in manufacturing and marketing their products . The result has been a steady stream of video_games , some very profitable , that quickly settled_on delivering G-rated violence and a mindless way to pass the time . By marketing to the lowest common_denominator , they and other manufacturers have failed to tap the vast potential that interactivity holds . Interactive media enables kids to do more things -- access information , communicate and play -- in ways that never existed before . * Most companies have taken little , if any , advantage of opportunities to give kids interactive technology that empowers them to explore their world through entertainment and education in an active and creative way . In experiments conducted by Nickelodeon and other companies , kids have already demonstrated their ability to push the use of television to its technological limits . We call these &quot; dirt roads_tests , &quot; and they indicate that the true programming breakthroughs that surface in the next decade are likely to come from kids . They need plenty of guidance and encouragement from creative adults whose goals are to shape programs that meet kids ' emotional and psychological needs and take_advantage of the way kids think and play . We should also learn from other interactive pioneers who have made &quot; kid input &quot; a key part of their programs . The Hueneme School District , a school_system in Oxnard , has drawn_on such input in developing a phenomenally successful CD-ROM-based curriculum . Shop classes , for example , have turned_into high-tech laboratories where boys and girls design animation and build robots , cars and buildings with computers . Likewise , Hueneme ' s computer-aided performance gains in science , math , literature and language have been remarkable . Since 1984 , when they first introduced technology into the classroom , Hueneme students ' statewide test scores have increased from below the 40th percentile to the 92nd percentile . Based on the experience at Hueneme , it is clear that interactivity could have a major impact on education -- both in the classroom and at_home . Taking a lesson from the shortcomings of the video_game industry , America ' s corporate leaders need to aim higher . They need to listen closely to consumers in developing software and programming that not only entertains , but also informs and enlightens . And they need to start by talking to kids , because they will play a critical role in our interactive future . Unlike adults , kids have little vested_interest in the past and are not creatures of habit . They are more inventive and more willing to accept change than their elder counterparts . * What this means is that we need to spend a little less time arguing about who will pay_for the new technology and a little more time talking_about the programming it will carry . As anyone who has bought a personal_computer knows , the hardware is just a starter ; it is the software that makes magic things happen . Let ' s ask consumers -- the kids in particular -- what they prefer to see and how they want to interact with the new technology as it develops . If we fail to learn from our mistakes by continuing to allow bottom-line concerns to take precedence over human needs , the information superhighway will surely not fulfill its potential . But if we take a different path , consumers may lead us to unimagined and wondrous possibilities .</TEXT>
