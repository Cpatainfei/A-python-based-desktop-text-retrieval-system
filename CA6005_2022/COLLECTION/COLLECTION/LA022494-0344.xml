   <TEXT> In a stunning challenge to Boris N . Yeltsin , lawmakers voted Wednesday to pardon all_of the Russian president ' s foes who face charges for their roles in political violence , from the 1991 coup attempt to last October ' s battle for the Moscow White_House . The Duma , the lower house of Parliament , voted 253 to 67 to declare amnesty for all_the alleged traitors after its Communist chairman , Ivan Rybkin , argued that doing so would be a step toward &quot; civic peace and harmony. &quot; Yeltsin ' s allies saw the amnesty instead as a move toward disaster , what reformist Deputy Sergei Yushenkov called &quot; the beginning of civil_war in Russia. &quot; A presidential spokesman condemned it as &quot; a dangerous path that contradicts the national interests. &quot; Rowdy opposition rallies in Moscow marking the Russian holiday that honors the military provided a taste of what may lie ahead , with about 10 # 000 protesters near the Kremlin calling_for Yeltsin ' s ouster . When told of the amnesty , the crowd cried thunderously , &quot; Hurrah ! &quot; The broad pardon set the stage ominously for Yeltsin ' s State of the Nation address today to the new Russian Parliament , which came_into being under a new constitution last month after Yeltsin dissolved the old Parliament in September because it blocked his reforms . If the Communist-nationalist coalition that supported the amnesty holds and all_the opposition leaders do go free , Russia appears doomed again to the cycle of endless political battles that Yeltsin tried to break_in September at an ultimate cost of more_than 140 lives . Yeltsin ' s spokesman , Vyacheslav V . Kostikov , said the amnesty is &quot; a challenge to Russian democracy &quot; and a sign that the Duma learned nothing from the old Supreme Soviet , which Yeltsin ended_up getting_rid_of with tanks and troops in October after it defied his order to dissolve . But Kostikov did not indicate whether Yeltsin will oppose the amnesty . &quot; There is nothing the president can do to legally reverse the decision , &quot; said Sergei A . Pashin , one of Yeltsin ' s top legal advisers . The Duma has a clear right under the new constitution to issue amnesties , and the decision is not subject_to a presidential veto because it is not a new law but simply a resolution . Journalists and some relatives began a vigil Wednesday afternoon outside Lefortovo prison , waiting for the release of former Vice_President Alexander V . Rutskoi , former Parliament Chairman Ruslan I . Khasbulatov and others jailed after the October clashes . The aging accused plotters of the 1991 coup attempt against Mikhail S . Gorbachev , who was then president of the Soviet_Union , have been living at_home as their trial has dragged_on month after month . There was no immediate sign of when the Lefortovo prisoners would be released . Some Yeltsin aides predicted that although the Russian president cannot stop the amnesty , he can put it off by waging a legal battle claiming that pardons cannot be issued to people who have not been convicted . Others , however , expect the release at Lefortovo to come today , when Russian prosecutors get the official papers needed from the Duma . The prospect of the return to the streets and podiums of such deputies-turned-rebels as Ilya V . Konstantinov , the bellicose leader of the banned National Salvation Front , was a daunting one indeed for the Yeltsin camp . &quot; People like Ilya Konstantinov are untamable , &quot; said Leonid Smirnyagin , a presidential adviser . &quot; They do not submit to the logic of history and will again try to reunite the irreconcilable opposition under their banner. &quot; At the opposition rally in front of the Bolshoi Theater , however , protesters exulted at the likelihood that their fight against Yeltsin will resume with full force . &quot; This will mean a revival of the movement for Russia ' s liberation from Yeltsin ' s capitalist puppet regime , &quot; said Tatyana Shevchuk , a 57-year-old retired biology teacher . &quot; This serves the ultimate purpose of getting_rid_of the president , &quot; said Andrei Bondarev , 27 . &quot; We do not need American valets as Russian president . The Russian people need a true Russian president , and we have one : Alexander Rutskoi ! &quot; Despite the danger of freeing opposition agitators , Duma deputies said they had voted for the amnesty because they believed it was time to do whatever it took_to create the national unity needed to straighten_out the economy . &quot; This gives us a chance to start movement in the direction of harmony , &quot; said Sergei M . Shakhrai , a former member of Yeltsin ' s government . &quot; Russia has a chance now , and so do its main political forces. &quot; In the Duma vote , only the most pro-Yeltsin faction , Russia ' s Choice , appeared to have opposed the amnesty . Extremist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky ' s Liberal Democrats , Communists and several moderate factions supported it . The Duma thus lived_up_to all_the gloomy predictions that it would , in_essence , be no better than the Supreme Soviet that Yeltsin dissolved . Yeltsin can only hope that his powers under the new constitution are great enough to allow him to shrug_off the constant resistance from lawmakers that led him to dissolve the last Parliament . He can also hope that enough has changed so that Rutskoi , Khasbulatov and others will find it hard to re-enter politics . &quot; In the time that those guilty in the tragic events of Oct . 3-4 were in prison , a new statehood has been created in Russia , in which Rutskoi , Khasbulatov and others have no part , &quot; Smirnyagin said . That new statehood , however , has drawbacks for Yeltsin as well . Before December elections brought Russia its new constitution , he could bend the law and justify it by claiming he was more legitimate than Russia ' s patched-up old constitution because he had been elected by the people . Now , however , he would seem to be stuck_with the system of power he helped to create . The Duma ' s amnesty provides the first real test of whether Yeltsin plans to abide_by the new division of powers or to try once again to ignore it and claim presidential rights -- such_as , perhaps , the right to block an amnesty -- that the constitution does not actually give him .
