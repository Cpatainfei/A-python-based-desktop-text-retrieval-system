   <HEADLINE> LAGUNA HILLS FINDINGS MOVE HUBER CASE TO O.C. ; CRIME : TESTS INDICATE SHE WAS KILLED IN WAREHOUSE , NOT IN ARIZONA . FAMILY IS RELIEVED JURISDICTION IS SETTLED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Long-awaited blood_tests indicated that a Newport Beach woman whose battered body was found in a freezer here was bludgeoned to death three years ago in Laguna Hills , leading Arizona authorities on Thursday to send the murder case to Orange County for prosecution . Orange County prosecutors quickly filed capital murder_charges in Municipal Court in Newport Beach against John J . Famalaro , a 37-year-old house_painter who lived most of his life in Orange County before moving_in 1992 to Arizona , where he was arrested earlier this month on murder_charges . The victim , Denise Huber , a 23-year-old UC Irvine graduate , disappeared June 3 , 1991 , after her automobile had a tire blowout on the Corona del Mar Freeway . Her whereabouts had been a mystery until Arizona detectives , thinking they were about to uncover a cache of illicit drugs , found her nude and handcuffed body in the freezer , which Famalaro brought here from California and kept running in a Ryder rental truck parked in his driveway . Although criminal attorneys both here and in California have said that prosecutors would have a tougher time securing a death sentence if the murder case were sent to Orange County , they also said that Arizona would have little choice but to surrender jurisdiction if evidence surfaced that the actual slaying occurred in California . That evidence was uncovered by Costa Mesa police_detectives and confirmed by crime lab technicians of the Orange County Sheriff ' s Department . The joint statement issued Thursday said that the decision to send the murder prosecution to Orange County was &quot; based on the DNA analysis of bloodstains collected at the warehouse ( Famalaro occupied ) at 23192 Verdugo &quot; in Laguna Hills . Two types of DNA testing were being done , the statement said , and &quot; results to date show that the blood found at the warehouse matches that of Denise Huber. &quot; The complaint charging Famalaro with murder included the &quot; special circumstance &quot; of kidnaping . &quot; Due_to the special-circumstance allegation , Famalaro is eligible for the death_penalty , &quot; the statement said . The murder victim ' s father , Dennis Huber , said from the family home_in Newport Beach that he and his wife , Ione , were greatly relieved that the jurisdictional issue had finally been resolved , and that his daughter ' s body would be released in time for a twice-postponed funeral now scheduled for Tuesday in South_Dakota . &quot; It closes the chapter , but not the book , &quot; Dennis Huber said . He added that he had &quot; mixed feelings &quot; about the case being transferred to Orange County . &quot; We felt it might have been an easier prosecution over there , &quot; he said . &quot; I think it will be a fair trial and justice will be served . It just might be tougher. &quot; Famalaro ' s defense_attorney , Thomas K . Kelly , agreed with that assessment . &quot; From Day One , I believed it to be in my client ' s best interest to have the case tried in California , &quot; he said , adding that the obstacles to imposing the death_penalty are more easily overcome in Arizona . Moreover , only two of California ' s more_than 300 Death Row inmates have been executed since 1977 , even though the death_penalty was restored in California in that year . If there is one good aspect to the case being transferred , Dennis Huber said , it is that &quot; we know a lot of people here , and if we come_out for the trial we ' ve had a lot of offers from people to stay_at their homes. &quot; The Hubers are planning to move from Newport Beach to North_Dakota in mid-August . Orange County Assistant Dist . Atty . John Conley said prosecutors were looking_into the possibility of filing a murder_charge with other special circumstances . California reserves the death_penalty generally for those killers who commit a second crime , such_as rape or robbery , in connection with the murder . When her body was discovered , Huber ' s eyes and mouth had been covered with cotton and sealed shut with duct tape . Autopsy results have not been officially released , but officials say there are no obvious signs of sexual_assault . In order to prove kidnaping , the state must show that a person was &quot; transported against his or her will by force or threat of force , &quot; and defense_attorneys say a persuasive argument could be made that Denise Huber might have willingly accepted a lift from a passing motorist when she found herself stranded on a dark freeway at 2 a.m. Conley said the murder complaint was filed late in the day , and that documents supporting a request for an arrest_warrant have been sealed by the court . * Famalaro will continue to be held without bail in Arizona ' s Yavapai County Jail pending extradition to Orange County , said Yavapai County Sheriff Buck Buchanan . &quot; If he waves extradition , he ' ll go quick ( to Orange County ) . If he doesn ' t , he goes slow . But he goes. &quot; Additionally , the Yavapai County attorney ' s office has filed papers requesting that all evidence seized in three searches of Famalaro ' s home here be turned_over to Orange County authorities . The Yavapai County grand_jury last week indicted Famalaro on first-degree murder and grand theft charges , but those charges are expected to be put_on hold and ultimately dropped now that Orange County prosecutors are taking_over the case . Orange County Deputy Public_Defender Leonard Gumlia was traveling_to Prescott late Thursday night and was expected to meet with Kelly and Famalaro to discuss proceedings in the case . Famalaro must be found to be indigent , lacking the financial resources to hire his own attorney , in_order to qualify for the services of a public_defender . But he has stated in court records that he is penniless and it is widely assumed that Gumlia will be appointed to represent him . Kelly said he was considering fighting Famalaro ' s extradition to California , but said Thursday that will be a joint decision made by himself and Gumlia . &quot; My understanding is this is a very high-profile case in Orange County . I ' m really concerned about Mr. Famalaro , &quot; Kelly said . &quot; I don ' t know what is going_to happen to him there. &quot; If Famalaro ' s attorneys decided to fight Famalaro ' s extradition to Orange County , Yavapai Deputy County Counsel Thomas B . Lindberg said it could take at least four weeks and probably longer to resolve the_matter . If not , Lindberg said Famalaro could be moved within two weeks . The Yavapai prosecutor said he would have liked to have handled the case , but acknowledged that it had become a distraction for the office because of the intense media interest in it . &quot; It ' s been hard to get things done , &quot; Lindberg said . But he said that Yavapai officials would continue to provide any help that Orange County authorities needed . &quot; Both sides are being cooperative as ever , &quot; Lindberg said . &quot; that ' s not going_to change . They ( Orange County authorities ) are not going_to be out_in the cold on this. &quot; Costa Mesa Police_Department Detective Lt . Ron Smith , who has been working 10-hour workdays in Prescott for almost two weeks as he struggles with fellow Costa Mesa detectives Lynda Giesler and Frank Rudisill to piece together the strongest case possible against Famalaro , said Thursday was really &quot; one long day . . . just so_much happening so fast. &quot; Smith said the blood at the Laguna Hills storage facility narrowed_down the time between Huber ' s disappearance and her murder , which will help authorities create a case for kidnaping . It ' s a critical allegation , he said , because that is what would make Famalaro eligible for the death_penalty . &quot; The blood helps us to establish a shorter time_period between the disappearance and the murder , which would show cause as_to kidnap , &quot; Smith said . Smith said there are probably additional crimes involved with carting the body around for three years , but said police are instead focusing_on the most serious charges . Smith said that all evidence &quot; points very strongly to Huber dying in that warehouse in Laguna Hills. &quot; He stopped short of ruling out the possibility that Famalaro might have had an accomplice , but said that is &quot; less and less likely all_the time. &quot; Although Orange County authorities agree that the killing took_place in Laguna Hills , which is policed by the Orange County Sheriff ' s Department , it was decided that the Costa Mesa Police_Department should handle the investigation because that was where Denise Huber disappeared and its detectives have the most experience with the case . &quot; It ' s our case from here on out , &quot; said Smith , adding that Costa Mesa police really had no preference about where the case should be tried . &quot; Wherever the prosecution would be best , that ' s where everybody ' s heart has been at . The case came first . There was never any question. &quot; In other developments Thursday , Yavapai County Superior_Court Judge Raymond W . Weaver Jr . signed an order allowing the medical_examiner to release Huber ' s body . Lindberg said he had spoken Thursday with Maricopa County Medical_Examiner Dr. Philip E . Keen to make arrangements for the release of Denise Huber ' s body , but it was not immediately clear who would take possession of the body and how quickly . An Orange County coroner ' s pathologist wanted to review the body before the funeral , and Dr. Richard Fukumoto had flown from Orange County to Phoenix in hopes of conducting an examination last Friday . But he was denied access to her remains by Arizona medical_examiners , who said the Orange County pathologist had no jurisdiction . The dispute led Dennis and Ione Huber to complain that Arizona &quot; egos &quot; were to blame for repeated delays in holding their daughter ' s funeral , which was postponed twice . Lt . Dan Martini of the Orange County Sheriff ' s Department said Fukumoto has not requested another review of the body , and will simply review the work already performed by Maricopa County medical_examiners . The issue of jurisdiction also stalled forensic testing of other evidence , such_as bloodstained clothing found at Famalaro ' s home , and several items that police speculate may have been the murder weapon . Arizona authorities were reluctant to conduct such forensic tests if the case was going_to move to California , requiring a second round of identical tests in Orange County , or possibly the presence of Arizona crime technicians to testify at an Orange County trial . Smith said Costa Mesa officers will need a large moving_van to cart all_the evidence back to Orange County , and that he expects those arrangements to be complete within a_few days . Famalaro ' s parents , Anne and Angelo Famalaro , arrived_at the Yavapai County Jail some two hours before normal visiting hours Thursday to see their son . They were accompanied by three female companions , whom Anne Famalaro referred to as her &quot; Maude Squad. &quot; As they waited to enter the chamber where they would speak_to their son through a plate-glass window using a telephone , Anne Famalaro was animated and visibly agitated , talking with her husband and three female friends about the case being moved to California , the possibility of the death_penalty , the lawyers she has consulted with , and the media frenzy that has surrounded her family since her son ' s arrest two weeks ago . &quot; They ' re going to bother you for the rest of your life , &quot; one of the women said as they waited . &quot; Unless he gets the death_penalty , &quot; added another . &quot; But even that can take 10 years. &quot; At the time of his arrest , Famalaro was making a living as a jack-of-all-trades . He did house_painting and repairing , carpet cleaning and most recently turned_to real_estate when his state contracting license was revoked because of customer complaints about shoddy workmanship . Neighbors described him as a moody sort who one day would be chatting with residents about everything from the weather to his work , while another day he would refuse to make eye_contact or acknowledge a neighbor ' s wave as he walked to pick_up his mail or newspaper . Nearly all his neighbors , however , had gripes about eyesores at Famalaro ' s home , where law_enforcement authorities say he lived like a pack_rat . Paint cans , tools and the now notorious rental truck took_up much of the driveway , while lumber and tools littered his balcony . Inside , law_enforcement officers found a cluttered home , and noted that it was oddly organized . Scores of dated magazines were neatly grouped and stacked . Famalaro ordered his books by subject , and they included medical and law textbooks . Several bizarre items were seized from inside , including women ' s clothing that appeared to carry bloodstains , as well as women ' s personal identification . The finds set_off fears that Famalaro was a serial_killer -- but those fears remain unfounded , officials said . Authorities have tracked_down 11 women whose names turned_up in Famalaro ' s home to ensure their whereabouts -- and all have been found safe . Authorities are still searching for another woman , Patricia Gage , whose Social_Security card was found in Famalaro ' s home . Authorities have linked Famalaro to Huber ' s death through additional items discovered in his house , including Huber ' s clothing and personal identification collected in a box_in a garage , keys to the freezer and handcuffs , evidence that Famalaro purchased the freezer nine days after Huber disappeared , and Orange County newspaper_clippings that chronicled the young_woman ' s disappearance .
