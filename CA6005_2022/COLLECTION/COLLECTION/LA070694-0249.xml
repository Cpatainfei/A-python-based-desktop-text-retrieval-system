   <HEADLINE> FACING EXPULSION , HILL RESIGNS SEAT IN SENATE ; LEGISLATURE : THE WHITTIER REPUBLICAN , CONVICTED OF CORRUPTION , LEAVES OFFICE FRIDAY . GOV . WILSON IS EXPECTED TO CALL A SPECIAL ELECTION TO REPLACE HIM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Facing expulsion by his colleagues after his conviction on corruption charges , state Sen . Frank Hill ( R-Whittier ) on Tuesday resigned his office effective Friday . In a one-sentence letter , the veteran lawmaker said : &quot; I hereby submit my resignation as senator for the Twenty-Ninth Senate District to become effective July 8 , 1994. &quot; On June 16 , Hill , 40 , was convicted of extortion , money_laundering and conspiracy stemming from his acceptance of a $ 2 # 500 check from an undercover FBI_agent posing as a Southern businessman seeking a legislative favor . Hill refused to resign , but the Senate was reluctant to move swiftly to oust a well-liked colleague . He continued to collect his $ 52 # 500-a-year salary plus a tax-free living allowance as his supporters urged that he be allowed to remain in office at least until his Sept . 12 sentencing . But last week the Senate Rules Committee voted 4-0 to oust Hill and scheduled a full Senate vote for later this week . The last time a senator was expelled was in 1905 , when four members caught_up in a political scandal were thrown_out . State Sen . Ruben S . Ayala ( D-Chino ) , a Rules Committee_member , said pressure was building from constituents to oust Hill . He said voters have accused senators of &quot; coddling one of_your_own . As far as they are concerned , Hill is a convicted felon . Why keep him on the payroll. &quot; Hill last week seemed to tip his hand , distributing to his Senate colleagues a flyer listing his Sacramento area condominium for_sale . &quot; Must sell or will list with realtor soon , &quot; the flyer said . Hill ' s resignation will clear the way for Gov . Pete Wilson to call a special election for the San Gabriel Valley to run concurrently with the Nov . 8 regular statewide election . A Wilson spokesman said a decision is expected soon . Combining the special election could save taxpayers about $ 1 million , legislative election consultants estimate . If no candidate receives a majority , a runoff election would be scheduled . Two Assembly Republicans , Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar and Richard Mountjoy of Arcadia , are considering whether to run_for Hill ' s safe GOP seat . Hill ' s letter arrived_at the close of business Tuesday . Karin Caves , press secretary to Senate Democratic leader Bill Lockyer of Hayward said , &quot; Sen . Hill did the right thing. &quot;</TEXT>
