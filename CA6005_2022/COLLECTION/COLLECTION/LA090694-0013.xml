   <HEADLINE> AMERICANS WANT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OUT ; THE COST OF TENDING TO THEM AND THEIR CHILDREN HAS OVERWHELMED THE STATE . WHY NOT DRAW THE LINE AT THE SCHOOL DOOR ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As one of the originators of Proposition 187 ( the &quot; Save Our State &quot; initiative ) and one of the thousands of volunteers working for its passage in November , I ' m concerned about the barrage of disinformation coming from many of California ' s richest special-interest groups . They seem to be threatened by having existing immigration laws enforced or , apparently , by any change in the status_quo of asking taxpayers to continue to fund services for those in this country illegally . The people of California , 600 # 000 of them statewide , have put this initiative on the ballot . They have done so because the politicians were afraid to deal with the problem . While Sacramento pointed its finger at Washington , and vice versa , the problem was allowed to grow . It has now grown to_the_point where it threatens to literally bankrupt this state . And an ineffective government must now hope that the people will save it . Fortunately , California has an initiative process whereby the people can legislate for themselves when necessary . This necessity was met before with Proposition 13 , which was attacked by many of the same special_interests that oppose us . They too , were targeted with a campaign of fear , with the same predictions of disaster that we are seeing now . Whether it ' s talk_of epidemics , or an explosion of crime , or the collapse of the economy , it ' s all_the same nonsense . A babble of nonsense designed to confuse the issue so that people won ' t know what they ' re voting on . But this problem is so pervasive and involves so many Californians that no amount_of_money spent by the special_interests can change people ' s minds . By now , most have read or heard the statistics about the costs of illegal aliens , and they have come_to their own conclusions about whether a bad system needs to be continued into perpetuity simply because &quot; they ' re here. &quot; And that is the essence of the problem : not just to secure the border ( where only 40 % of illegal entries occur ) but to deal with those already here . Once illegal aliens arrive in California , the burden falls on the state , not the federal_government . Proposition 187 would lighten that burden by ending public benefits paid_for health , education and welfare for illegal aliens . It would require law-enforcement agencies to cooperate with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and report all those under arrest for other crimes and subsequently suspected of being here illegally . It will also make the use of fraudulent citizenship documents , such_as the ever-popular phony &quot; green_card , &quot; a felony . Rather than support and harbor illegal aliens , California will report them to the INS . And , more important , a yes vote on Proposition 187 will pressure the federal_government to enforce its own laws . Our opponents boast that they are ready to file suit to challenge Proposition 187 in court . This is a challenge that we welcome . It will force the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit its narrow ( 5-4 ) decision of 1982 that required public education for illegals . The Plyler decision was based on circumstances very different from our problem today , where the cost of educating illegal aliens in bilingual programs is much higher than the amount allocated for American citizens . This is discrimination against our own people . In the words of Joseph Stein , president of the State Board_of_Education , the removal of illegals from public_schools will &quot; alleviate an inappropriate drain on scarce resources &quot; and will &quot; move our public_school system to the level necessary for successful preparation of children in the 21st Century. &quot; The deterioration in the quality of our education system threatens our economic competitiveness . But it cannot be reversed as long as more illegal aliens continue to pour into the system , demanding more and more special programs . Our public health-care system is also burdened with growing costs , largely as a result of immigration . In 1992 , the cost of providing free services to illegal aliens was $ 900 million , an increase of 1 # 800 % over the previous five years , according to the state ' s Department of Health Services . While American citizens must prove need ( and destitution ) before they can qualify for such services , illegals are able to take_advantage of them by claiming medical emergency . Once again , the system discriminates against citizens . Because the system is overloaded , the overall quality of care is being reduced to dangerous levels . According to the Los Angeles County Department of Health , for example , there isn ' t enough money for TB screening or follow-up care . This is the greater threat to public health -- not the deportation of illegals with communicable_diseases . Our welfare system is being abused as well . Although L.A. County Supervisor Gloria Molina says that no illegal aliens are receiving welfare in her county , she refuses to recognize the common practice of using fraudulent documents to show that the applicant is a legal resident . Once again , the system is being drained of funds that are then unavailable for those in need , those who are rightfully entitled to them . When food_stamp allocations are reduced next year , what do we say to Americans who don ' t have enough to eat ? Fraudulent documents are also used by illegal aliens to get jobs , although hiring them is prohibited by federal law . But the law doesn ' t work , as seen in the recent case against an employer charged with hiring illegal aliens -- the first such case in eight years . Moreover , employers are afraid to challenge applicants for fear of discrimination suits . Proposition 187 will require that the illegal aliens share responsibility ; it will discourage them from applying for jobs with phony identification . In spite of all these problems , many special_interests want the flow of illegal immigration to continue . Why ? Because they are advocacy groups that profit from litigation for &quot; human_rights &quot; at the expense of our rights . Because they are multinational corporations that profit from &quot; cheap labor &quot; at the cost of our jobs . Because they are bureaucracies that grow more powerful with ever increasing &quot; caseloads , &quot; while services for the rest of us are cut_back . Proposition 187 deals with the problem of illegal immigration at the state level , where most of the costs are incurred . Its passage will then pressure the federal_government to do its part . Its failure would send a message to all levels of government to do nothing . We must pass it .</TEXT>
