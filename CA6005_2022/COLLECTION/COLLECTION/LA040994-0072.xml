   <HEADLINE> EX-PROSECUTOR CONVICTED OF RACKETEERING ; TRIAL : AMID MOVIE-DEAL FEVER , ATLANTA ATTORNEY FREDRIC W . TOKARS IS FOUND GUILTY OF EIGHT COUNTS INVOLVING A DRUG RING AND HIS WIFE ' S MURDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ignoring allegations that greed and Hollywood overzealousness had corrupted the legal process , a federal jury Friday convicted an Atlanta attorney of racketeering in connection with drug charges and the murder of his wife . Fredric W . Tokars , a former Fulton County prosecutor and part-time municipal judge , was found guilty on eight counts , including racketeering , money_laundering , kidnaping and using a telephone to arrange a murder . Four of the counts carried mandatory life sentences . &quot; I ' m still in shock , &quot; said Jerome Froelich , Tokars ' attorney , as he left the courthouse in Birmingham , Ala. , where the trial was held . He said that he would file an appeal based on_trial errors , including the judge ' s allowance of what Froelich termed inadmissible evidence . Tokars , who has yet to stand trial on state murder_charges , sat stoically while the verdicts were read . Afterward , he turned toward his mother and briefly smiled . Assistant U.S. Atty . Wilmer Parker had portrayed Tokars as a seemingly strait-laced pillar of society -- a &quot; wolf in sheep ' s clothing &quot; -- who had his wife killed to keep her from disclosing his criminal activities . Tokars and co-defendant James Mason , a former nightclub owner , were accused of participating in a major cocaine ring that laundered its proceeds in offshore bank_accounts and nightclubs and used kidnaping , torture and murder to protect its operations . Mason was convicted of nine counts and faces life in prison . The five-week trial was dominated by talk_of movie deals . The two leading investigators of Sara Tokars ' murder , Cobb County police_detectives Ron Hunton and Pat Banks , were fired Monday after it was learned that they had signed a movie contract two months after the murder -- and eight months before Tokars was arrested . They were paid $ 4 # 500 each and would have received $ 200 # 000 if the case were made into a four-hour movie . Defense_attorneys alleged that the police , members of the media and Sara Tokars ' family had worked tirelessly to convict her husband because they lusted_after movie money and fame . &quot; The camera can be as seductive as any drug , &quot; Froelich said in closing arguments last week . &quot; Justice is not supposed to start_out by saying , ' I want this person and how do we get him ? ' &quot; The case , which has held much of Atlanta transfixed since Sara Tokars was shot down in front of her two young sons just after Thanksgiving in 1992 , sparked intense Hollywood interest . While the officers ' firings came_after the jury had begun its deliberations , one of the policemen admitted on the stand that he had lied to his supervisor about the movie deal . And there was testimony that Sara Tokars ' sisters and parents had agreed to participate in a made-for-television movie deal . Donald W . Chasey , executive producer for Patchett Kaufman Entertainment , contradicted one sister who testified that the family had backed_out of a movie deal . Chasey said that in January the sister , Therese Ambrusko , a San Francisco lawyer , told him she was concerned because she might be a witness in the trial and subpoenas might delve into the movie deal . &quot; She wanted to send me a letter saying we didn ' t have a deal , but that she didn ' t really mean it and in fact we really had a deal , &quot; Chasey testified . On Friday , Froelich repeated his allegation that Ambrusko committed &quot; flat-out perjury &quot; and said the family &quot; drove &quot; the prosecution . In yet another example of the way Hollywood affected the case , an Atlanta television_reporter and anchorman was fired last year after it was disclosed that he had entered into a partnership with sources -- including a lawyer and private_investigator who had worked for Sara Tokars -- to peddle a movie in which a character patterned after himself uncovered evidence proving that Fred Tokars was behind the murder . But none of this raised enough questions in the minds of the jury to discredit the evidence . &quot; I ' m very relieved , &quot; Parker said after the verdicts . &quot; I ' ve been involved in other major prosecutions that had more significant impact upon the United States society as_a_whole , but obviously this case had gripped the community of Atlanta and appropriately so . I think people yearned to see justice done , and I believe justice has been done. &quot; Froelich said he thought the jury had been overwhelmed by testimony of high-level drug dealing and graphic accounts of violence .</TEXT>
