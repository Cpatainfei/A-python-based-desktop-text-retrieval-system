   <TEXT> On more_than one occasion , Cardinal Roger M . Mahony of Los Angeles has spoken out forthrightly and eloquently about the illegal immigration issue . His continuing observations constitute a considerable public_service at a time when the issue is generating too_much heat and precious little enlightenment . While not gainsaying in the slightest the need to enforce the laws and maintain control over U.S. borders , the cardinal believes that the whole illegal immigration issue has been overly simplified , politicized and trivialized . Mahony ' s perspective is that to lose sight of the fundamentals -- which is that the people in_question are not mere statistics or simply fodder for politicians but human_beings with dignity and spirituality -- is to lose sight of our basic decency as a society . &quot; Prophetic vision will emerge when we are willing to include the moral dimension in the discussion , &quot; he said to a legislative committee in Sacramento , &quot; when we are able to recognize the immigrant as a sister or brother , not the enemy ; as an opportunity to strengthen our community , not a problem to be solved. &quot; Immigration into this country , he says , will not be controlled by simple devices , simplistic speeches or magical policy prescriptions . Nor should the effort to come_to grips with the problem undermine basic respect for the individuals involved . &quot; Respect for human dignity and human life is not negotiable , &quot; he said . &quot; Human dignity is not determined by social_class , citizenship , race or ethnicity. &quot;</TEXT>
