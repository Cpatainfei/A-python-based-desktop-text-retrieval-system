   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER ; ANGER IN KERRIGAN ' S CAMP ; ' THIS IS SUCH A TOUGH DEAL FOR NANCY , ' SAYS HER COACH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Figure skater Nancy Kerrigan ' s camp resolved to react with restraint to the announcement in the early morning hours here Sunday that rival Tonya Harding will compete in the Winter_Olympics , but , by the end of the day , the frustration and anger was pouring_out . &quot; This is such a tough deal for Nancy , &quot; her coach , Evy Scotvold , said Sunday night . &quot; She faces a second wound . &quot; She has to face somebody . . . whether that person or her family was trying to do her in , and yet they come_in here with such bravado . &quot; We don ' t live_in a perfect world . Sometimes , as those license_plates say , it just stinks. &quot; Paul Wylie , the Olympic men ' s silver medalist in 1992 and a close friend of Kerrigan ' s after training with her for several years in the Boston area , said he was so upset after learning of the settlement between the U.S. Olympic Committee and Harding that gives Harding the green_light to skate in the Olympics that he could not sleep . But he reserved his harshest judgments for the International Skating Union ' s insistence that Kerrigan and Harding must share practice times at the official rinks inside the Olympic Amphitheatre . &quot; All they seem to be concerned about is protecting Tonya , &quot; said Wylie , who is working as a commentator for CBS . &quot; Nobody seems to be standing_up to protect Nancy , especially in the area of practices . &quot; Nancy is the one who suffered the injury . Let ' s not forget that. &quot; As for Kerrigan , she practiced as scheduled Sunday afternoon , and although she did not look as sharp as she did the previous two days , Scotvold said that it had nothing to do with her reaction to the news about Harding . He said that he advised her to back_off because she had been trying too hard to be perfect in practices since arriving last Thursday . Afterward , Chelsea Clinton , whose mother led the official U.S._government delegation that attended Saturday ' s opening ceremony in Lillehammer , was allowed to speak_to Kerrigan , but reporters were not . Kerrigan ' s agent , Jerry Solomon , later issued a statement from his client that said : &quot; As you all know by now , I am not a lawyer and have tried to stay out of the fray in the whole matter of the investigation on the attack to my knee , which resulted in my having to withdraw from the U.S. championships . It has now been some 35 days since I was hit , and they have been trying ones to say the least . &quot; It seems now , for the moment and as it relates to the Olympic competition , the_matter has been resolved . Regardless of my opinion of the ruling , the Olympics have begun and it is time to skate . We have all worked very hard to get here , and I hope now that the focus can turn_to the competition and all_of the athletes who represent the pinnacle of athleticism and sportsmanship. &quot; Solomon added that Kerrigan will offer no more statements until her competition begins Feb . 23 , which means that reporters will have to draw their own conclusions about how she handles practicing with Harding . Scheduled to arrive Wednesday , Harding could be sharing a rink with Kerrigan by the next afternoon . Clearly disturbed because the ISU will not change the practice assignments so that Kerrigan and Harding can skate separately , Scotvold said : &quot; Everyone has kept silent , but silence is not weakness . The most important thing is that Nancy came here to be a champion . She is trying to do that by taking the high road and doing_it right . &quot; Maybe that doesn ' t work today in society . Maybe it ' s who yells loudest and most profane. &quot; Despite repeated pleas by the U.S. Olympic Committee and the U.S. Figure_Skating Assn. , the ISU has not budged . &quot; If they don ' t like it , don ' t bring her , &quot; said ISU vice_president Lawrence Demmy of Great Britain , referring to Harding . &quot; You come as a team , you skate as a team. &quot; The United States ' representative to the ISU Council , Chuck DeMore , agreed , arguing that placing Kerrigan and Harding in separate practices would attract large media contingents to both and burden twice as_many skaters . &quot; By splitting up the practice , you would expand the disturbance element to other skaters , &quot; he said . &quot; It isn ' t fair . This is an American problem . ( Kerrigan ) is going_to have to face the reality . She ' ll be_on the ice at_the_same_time ( with Harding ) . She might as well get used to it. &quot; Wylie said the ISU position is wrong . &quot; They think they ' re minimizing the problem by having them at a single practice , &quot; he said . &quot; But instead of having a small problem at two practices , you ' re going to have an extra-large problem at one. &quot; Beyond that , he said , the ISU is not taking into consideration Kerrigan ' s feelings about being forced to practice with a skater who has been implicated by a U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . hearing panel in the Jan . 6 assault on her at the national championships in Detroit . &quot; Nancy has a scenario in her head , &quot; Wylie said . &quot; She says , ' I can handle this , and I can handle that. ' But each day she has had to take_on more stress because of the events that are unfolding here. &quot; DeMore said , however , that there will be as much pressure , if not more , on Harding . &quot; Harding is the one who has to watch it , &quot; he said . &quot; If Harding skates by and Nancy just happens to fall from the breeze , they ' re going to say she got too close. &quot; The USFSA ' s team leader , Gayle Tanger , said the association offered both Kerrigan and Harding ice time in Oslo , 80 miles south of Hamar , if they would like to avoid potential problems by practicing away from the official rinks . &quot; At this point , both say they ' d rather be here , &quot; Tanger said . &quot; So we ' ll see how it works. &quot; The USFSA already had the Oslo rink available to accommodate Michelle Kwan , 13 , of Torrance , the first alternate who was asked to come_to Norway in case she was called_upon to replace Harding . As an alternate , she is not allowed to skate on the official rinks . Although it appears now that Kwan will not compete , the USFSA still wants her in Oslo in case things change between now and the Feb . 21 deadline for naming its entries in the women ' s competition . &quot; We always thought we should have our alternate close by , &quot; said Tanger , adding that Kwan probably will arrive late this week . &quot; I see no reason to change that. &quot; The USFSA also is urging Kwan to remain in shape . Pending the final outcome of the association ' s investigation , she might represent the United States in the March 22-27 World Championships in Chiba , Japan , if Harding is removed from the team . Harding has until March 7 to respond to the USFSA hearing panel ' s charges . &quot; We ' re agreeing with the USOC in the resolution of this situation , &quot; said Claire Ferguson , USFSA president . &quot; But we have our own code of conduct. &quot; * ANALYSIS : The USOC ' s code_of_conduct was never meant to deal with acts of violence .
