   <HEADLINE> CLASSES LEARN SPACE ' IS JUST STARTING ' ; SPECIAL HANDS-ON PROGRAM TEACHES STUDENTS ABOUT ROCKETS AND COMETS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s not every day that middle_school students get_to make comets with their own hands or launch rockets under the direction of . . . a rocket scientist . But there they were , 400 of them at the California Museum of Science and Industry , mixing dry_ice , soil , water , balsamic acid and Worcestershire sauce into frozen balls of ice and dirt . &quot; It was cool because . . . it came_out nasty , &quot; said Gabriel Chavez , 12 , a seventh-grader at South Gate Middle_School , who created one of the &quot; comets &quot; with his classmate and buddy , Matthew Jaramillo . Directing the &quot; nasty &quot; space-age exercise was Randii Wessen , a science systems engineer with Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena . It was all part of the Youth Science Symposium , subtitled &quot; Your Place in Space , &quot; held Wednesday at the Exposition Park museum for seventh- and eighth-graders from eight Los Angeles County schools . Wessen did not seem to mind if the &quot; lab work &quot; was like playtime for the youngsters , who were drawn from science classes . &quot; I think that space doesn ' t seem real to the kids because it is out there and we are here , &quot; he said . &quot; Anything that we can do to make_it tangible , to make_it real , will help them to better understand. &quot; The rocket-making was going_on at another trailer classroom on the museum grounds . Ingrid Rodriguez , 11 , a sixth-grader at Marina del Rey Junior_High_School , then got_to launch her missile -- made_out of a syringe , a cork and a bottle filled with water -- on the museum ' s grounds . The day was not all hands-on exercises -- while they worked , the students were taught the fundamentals of comets and rockets . The program , sponsored by the Lockheed Corp. , also featured the new IMAX film &quot; Destiny in Space &quot; and short lectures by Wessen , aerospace curator Kenneth E . Phillips and Brenda Forman , director of marketing policy at Lockheed . Wessen told the middle schoolers , &quot; Space is not over , it is just starting. &quot; Phillips told them that they did not have to be the smartest students to be the best at a chosen endeavor -- a pep talk amid the science . &quot; They are at a particularly vulnerable age , &quot; he said later . &quot; We want to bolster their confidence in their abilities. &quot; The message hit_home with 12-year-old Marie Meza . &quot; Anybody can be a scientist , &quot; she said . &quot; It doesn ' t matter if you are a girl or a boy , it just matters how you think. &quot;</TEXT>
