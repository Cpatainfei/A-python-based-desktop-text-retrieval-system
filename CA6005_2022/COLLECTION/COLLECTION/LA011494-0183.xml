   <HEADLINE> HOME TECH / LASER BIN : PLAYBOY ENTERS THE INTERACTIVE ERA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' ve started taking your first baby steps_down that highly touted information superhighway , you may bump_into some familiar figures . * And depending_on your viewpoint , you may be salivating , or cursing . Playboy , which plunged into the market early in the game via a pay-TV channel , audio and video tapes and CDs , has jumped into the laser disc video revolution with both feet , and most other body_parts . The empire , founded by a man whose wardrobe was defined by silk pajamas , is now presided over by his daughter , who has found even more imaginative ways to bring all those provocative -- some would say licentious -- images in the vaults into the ' 90s realm of laser discs , CD-ROMs and other interactive formats . If you thought the Philips CD-1 was a machine designed just to teach your kids how to spell and count , think again . &quot; Playboy ' s Complete Massage &quot; ( $ 25 ) , made exclusively for the interactive Philips CD-I Digital Video , provocatively promises to draw &quot; upon the therapeutic and sensual expertise of the masters , unites timeless techniques with new age technology for a truly erotic experience. &quot; The CD-I program promises to &quot; inspire you to explore and enjoy new sexual possibilities by arousing your intimacy and heightening your ecstasy. &quot; You might want to put the kids to bed first . The less tactile &quot; Playboy Electronic Datebook &quot; ( $ 40 ) includes 50 nude or partially clothed &quot; girls &quot; from the 1950s to the 1990s . A click-and-drag formula lets you organize your meetings , vacations and appointments around your favorite Playmates : that famous Marilyn Monroe nude calendar photo , or others named Debra Jo , Candy , Erika , Jessica or . . . LaToya . Playboy Video offers laser discs featuring everything from the Playmate of the Month to the documentary on Playboy founder and editor , &quot; Hugh Hefner : Once Upon a Time &quot; ( $ 20 ) , put_together by &quot; Twin Peaks &quot; producers David Lynch and Mark Frost . The film , released to theaters before its video release , includes home_movies of Hefner as a kid , glimpses into the Playboy Mansion , hokey clips of Hefner ' s first TV appearances and interview statements from close and not-so-close friends . Playboy ' s &quot; Inside Video &quot; series ( around $ 35 ) offers ribald tales . Playboy calls them &quot; unusual sexy tales of haunting passion and obsession , of intrigue , sensuality and eroticism. &quot; Others might characterize them as boring soft porn . It seems every time technology moves forward , adult entertainment gets_in line first . The laser revolution is no exception . These electronic adult titles are just the beginning . Penthouse already is providing raunchier offerings . And various computer software companies are producing such best-selling titles as &quot; Virtual Valerie &quot; with contents impossible to accurately describe in a family newspaper . Not to mention video_games well-bashed elsewhere . No matter what the technology , though , the viewing and purchase pattern may well stay the same : Men will rush_out to buy new toys ( laser disc and CD-ROM players ) to savor age-old fantasies , then justify the purchase by buying educational_programs for children and women . Playboy even hooked_up_with IBM to create one product that could prove to be illuminating for the entire family . It ' s a new CD-ROM called &quot; The Playboy Interview , 1962-1992 &quot; ( $ 70 ) . When Miles Davis appeared as the first &quot; Playboy Interview &quot; in 1962 , Playboy says that the idea of storing entertainment on a spinning disc was something out of an H.G. Wells novel . But now , 32 years later , we get not only the full text from interviews with 352 personalities ranging from Malcolm X to Martin_Luther_King Jr. , from Orson Welles to Woody Allen , but also 1 # 000 photos , video clips from a 30th-anniversary party , a tutorial and library . Maybe we are in_gear for the 21st Century .</TEXT>
