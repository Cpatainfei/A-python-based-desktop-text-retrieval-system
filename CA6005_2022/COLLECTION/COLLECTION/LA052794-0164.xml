   <HEADLINE> CLINTON REVERSES HIS POLICY , RENEWS CHINA TRADE STATUS ; COMMERCE : PRESIDENT ' DE-LINKS ' MOST-FAVORED-NATION PRIVILEGE FROM HUMAN_RIGHTS . HE ADMITS FAILURE OF EARLIER COURSE AND SAYS BROADER STRATEGIC INTERESTS JUSTIFY SWITCH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton , abandoning a central foreign_policy principle of his Administration , announced Thursday that he has decided to &quot; de-link &quot; China ' s privileged trading status from its human_rights record . While acknowledging that China &quot; continues to commit very serious human_rights abuses , &quot; Clinton said that he has come_to believe that broader American strategic interests justify the policy reversal . Striking a defensive , almost apologetic posture at a late-afternoon White_House briefing , Clinton acknowledged that his previous approach to U.S.-China relations had failed and said that he intends to set a new course . &quot; That linkage has been constructive during the past year , but I believe , based on our aggressive contacts with the Chinese in the past several months , that we have reached the end of the usefulness of that policy , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; . . . We need to place our relationship into a larger and more productive framework. &quot; Therefore , Clinton said , he will renew China ' s most-favored-nation status , meaning that Beijing can ship its exports to the United States on the same tariff terms as most other American trading partners . Last year , China exported about $ 31 billion worth of goods to the United States , running a trade surplus of $ 23 billion . The United States exported $ 8 billion in goods to China . The only limit Clinton imposed on the China trade is a ban on U.S. sales of Chinese-made guns and ammunition , which amounted to about $ 100 million last year . Clinton dropped the idea of forming a human_rights commission to monitor progress in China . The Chinese rejected such a body as an insult to their sovereignty , and human_rights groups derided it as likely to be ineffective . The President announced his new China policy in the White_House briefing room . Unlike previous major presidential announcements , he appeared alone , without Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher or senior White_House aides . Clinton seemed prepared to take the inevitable criticism that his change in course generated . Lawmakers on Capitol_Hill , human_rights organizations and Chinese dissident groups immediately expressed anger and dismay . Human_Rights Watch ( Asia ) called the Clinton announcement &quot; one more capitulation on human rights. &quot; &quot; Clinton has left his Administration looking vacillating and hypocritical , while the Chinese leadership , by contrast , has emerged as hard-nosed , uncompromising and victorious . We ' re deeply disappointed by this decision , &quot; said Sidney Jones , executive_director of the organization . AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland , in a particularly scathing statement , said that Clinton ' s decision &quot; sends a clear message to the world : ' No matter what America says about democracy and human_rights , in the final analysis profits , not people , matter most. ' . . . America should be standing with the Chinese people , not their oppressors , &quot; he added . Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) , an important ally of the President ' s on health_care and other major policy initiatives , also quickly criticized Clinton ' s new China policy . &quot; I disagree_with the decision . . . . The experience of recent years has been that each concession to the Chinese Communist regime encourages its intransigence , and I believe this will be the unfortunate result of this decision , &quot; Mitchell said . &quot; It will confirm for the Chinese Communist regime the success of its policy of repression on human_rights and manipulation on trade . It is likely to produce a result that is the opposite of what the President intends. &quot; Mitchell added that , when Congress returns from its Memorial_Day recess , he will introduce legislation to reverse Clinton ' s decision . That legislation probably will be similar to bills sponsored by Mitchell and Rep . Nancy Pelosi ( D-San Francisco ) during the George_Bush Administration , attaching conditions to future renewals of China ' s trade status . Bush repeatedly vetoed such legislation , and in 1992 Clinton accused him of &quot; coddling dictators &quot; in China . During his presidential campaign , Clinton also specifically endorsed the idea of imposing human_rights conditions on the renewal of China ' s trade benefits . Sen . John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , defended the decision on policy grounds . But he underscored that Clinton was adopting precisely the Bush_Administration policy that he assailed as cynical during the 1992 campaign . Renewing most-favored-nation status for China &quot; is a sound , if politically embarrassing , decision , &quot; McCain said . Clinton said he believes he reached the right decision and said he is prepared to defend it . &quot; I want to make_it clear to you I do not do this with rose-colored glasses on , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; I know there will be , no matter which approach we take . . . , continuing human_rights problems. &quot; Clinton ' s answer to his critics echoed the rhetoric of the Bush and Ronald Reagan_administrations in addressing the question of doing business with undemocratic regimes , whether in China or South_Africa or elsewhere . Bush and Reagan argued that engagement rather than confrontation with these governments was the preferable course , because any ruling group would bristle_at being subject_to outside pressure . On Thursday , Clinton gave a lengthy defense of the Bush -- and now Clinton -- policy . &quot; To those who argue that in_view of China ' s human_rights abuses we should revoke MFN status , let me ask you the same question that I have asked myself over and over these last few weeks as I have studied this issue and consulted people of both parties who have had experience with China over many decades . Will we do more to advance the cause of human_rights if China is isolated or if our nations are engaged in a growing web of political and economic cooperation and contacts ? &quot; Clinton said . Further explaining his new policy , Clinton noted that conditions in China and elsewhere in Asia have changed since he signed an executive order last year requiring &quot; overall significant progress &quot; on a number of human_rights fronts . He said that Christopher could not certify that China had met such conditions , but he said that he was dropping the trade-human rights link for several reasons , including severe political tensions between Beijing and the Chinese provinces , a desire on the part of China ' s aging leadership to &quot; preserve order &quot; and the fact that no government responds well to outside threats . Clinton noted that North_Korea ' s nuclear_weapons program and belligerent attitude toward South_Korea also justify American rapprochement with Beijing in the interests of larger Asian security concerns . In briefings with reporters , Clinton ' s advisers sought to put the best face on his about-face . Robert E . Rubin , the head of Clinton ' s National Economic Council , insisted that the decision &quot; was not made as a result of pressure &quot; from the American business_community . But he also predicted that the policy will open the way for greater trade between American companies and China . &quot; I think ( China ) will become an ever larger and more important trading partner , &quot; Rubin said . In Beijing , a Western diplomat said that Clinton ' s curb on sales of Chinese guns and ammunition may_not hurt the Chinese small-arms industry much because &quot; exports to the U.S. increased significantly last year when the Brady bill was under consideration. &quot; &quot; They ( importers of Chinese arms ) may have been stocking up in anticipation of this type of thing . They may have defended themselves by stocking up . The handwriting has been_on the wall for some time. &quot; Asked whether Clinton ' s action will alienate leaders of the Chinese People ' s Liberation Army , the diplomat replied : &quot; From the military point_of_view this is nowhere as bad as it could have been . It could have been much worse . It doesn ' t strike directly at the military and the important interests they represent . . . . This will be seen as light. &quot; Times staff writers Rone Tempest in Beijing and Michael Ross in Washington contributed to this report . * CALIFORNIA CHEER : State businesses , economy stand to benefit from move .
