   <HEADLINE> PROPOSED QUAKE AID LIMITS SEEN AS MOSTLY SYMBOLIC ; IMMIGRANTS : ILLEGAL RESIDENTS COULD STILL RECEIVE EMERGENCY BENEFITS . BUT DEBATE MAY HAVE POLITICAL IMPACT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The proposed congressional amendment barring illegal immigrants from receiving non-emergency earthquake aid may have more impact on election-year politics than any practical effect on providing assistance to disaster victims , federal_officials and immigration activists say . For one thing , the bulk of President Clinton ' s $ 8.6-billion aid package would go toward fixing freeways , schools and other public facilities rather than assisting individuals . Moreover , much of the aid to individuals is earmarked for emergency shelter , food and medical_care -- all_of which are exempt from the proposed regulations . Federal Emergency Management Agency director James Lee Witt said the amendment would have little impact on his agency , which primarily distributes short-term emergency aid . &quot; The amendment I have seen would n ' t hinder our efforts , &quot; he said . Emergency officials say they have no idea what percentage of aid-seekers are undocumented immigrants since they do not inquire , but Witt and others said they do not think the numbers are sizable . Studies have shown that most undocumented residents do not seek long-term aid from government_agencies because of fear of being deported . One such study showed that Latinos -- including illegal immigrants -- use government health and welfare benefits at half the rate of whites and a fifth of the rate of blacks , according to UCLA professor David Hayes-Bautista . &quot; Not that many undocumented will apply for these programs , &quot; Hayes-Bautista said . &quot; Economically , it is meaningless. &quot; The proposed regulation , introduced by Rep . Ron Packard ( R-Oceanside ) and adopted in modified form by the House on Thursday , would be aimed primarily at excluding illegal immigrants from longer-term aid programs such_as 18-month housing subsidy grants provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development , and low-interest residential and business loans offered by the Small Business Administration . The bill , with the amendment , still must be acted_on by the Senate . While the amendment bars federal agencies from giving long-term federal disaster aid to anyone they know to be in the country illegally , it does not require them to ask applicants their residency status . &quot; Unless there is a mandate to ask , the federal agencies won ' t ask , &quot; said Dan Stein , executive_director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform , adding that the amendment is therefore largely symbolic . &quot; We are again seeing political fraud. &quot; But Packard said that if the amendment is enacted , &quot; agencies will determine how to implement the law. &quot; &quot; If they choose to not find ways to implement that law , we will find ways for them to do_it , &quot; he said . Because extensive paperwork is required for an SBA loan -- applicants must also submit federal income_tax forms and a Social_Security_number -- few undocumented residents would be likely to apply for disaster assistance loans , SBA officials said . &quot; The bottom_line is , we have never heard of a single case of an illegal getting a loan , &quot; said Alfred Judd , deputy assistant administrator for disaster assistance for the SBA . HUD ' s Section 8 housing subsidy program for quake victims has moved forward so quickly that the implementation of a congressional ban might not occur until many earthquake victims have already received their vouchers and moved_into their new homes . Since the Jan . 17 earthquake , more_than 11 # 000 people have qualified for housing vouchers and 1 # 426 of them have located new apartments . The only remaining steps before they move_in are government inspections to make_sure the units are shipshape and the signing of contracts with landlords . &quot; I don ' t think we could undo what ' s done , &quot; said Joe Shuldiner , assistant secretary of HUD . &quot; I don ' t think contracts would be nullified. &quot; The detailed application procedure for winning housing subsidies makes_it unlikely that many undocumented immigrants would be served , Shuldiner said . &quot; We don ' t have a sense the people receiving certificates are undocumented , &quot; he said . &quot; As a practical matter . . . we ' re talking_about people waiting_on line for a long_time , filling_out forms in which they have to give their Social_Security numbers. &quot; Since 1980 , Congress has voted several times to restrict housing assistance programs to only legal residents . However , implementation was held_up as a result of court decisions and public criticism of the enabling regulations . The push for regulations against aid to illegal immigrants is an issue that HUD Secretary Henry G . Cisneros would prefer to sidestep during the current emergency , according to a White_House aide involved with immigration policy and earthquake issues . &quot; He thinks the earthquake is not the time to start making policy on this , &quot; said the aide . &quot; He ' s reluctant to turn HUD field_officers into immigration cops. &quot; Shuldiner concurred that HUD officials are concerned &quot; about this being imposed here for the first time. &quot; &quot; If this is something Congress wants to do to address problems with undocumented aliens , the department would hope they ' d take it up as part of an immigration issue rather than a supplemental to disaster relief. &quot; Over the years , Republican as well as Democratic HUD officials have expressed concerns about barring aid to illegal residents , who are eligible to send their children to public_schools and to receive emergency medical_care . In 1990 , President George_Bush ' s HUD secretary , Jack Kemp , warned Costa Mesa officials that they risked losing federal funding if they barred illegal immigrants from receiving HUD-related social_services . Those favoring Packard ' s restrictions call current government policy schizophrenic . &quot; They want to enforce immigration law at the border , but once illegals are in the U.S. , they want to play Santa Claus , &quot; said FAIR ' s Stein . But immigrant advocates counter that the limitations are motivated by ugly political interests , and fear the amendment may have negative ramifications for some undocumented residents , as well as the public at_large . The Rev . Jesse Jackson , speaking Thursday at the Central_American Resource Center , blasted the proposal as &quot; immoral and unfair. &quot; Joined by Los Angeles City_Council members Jackie Goldberg and Mark Ridley-Thomas , Jackson denounced the &quot; resurrection of anti-immigrant hysteria &quot; nationwide and called_for the defeat of the provision . Roberto Lovato , the center ' s executive_director , said , &quot; We have reached a moral low as a country when we deny emergency aid to anyone . &quot; This is part of the whole anti-immigrant agenda , &quot; he said . &quot; This is the first salvo in an ongoing battle this election year. &quot; Lovato said that limitations on housing and other assistance could result in more homelessness and crime by some of the county ' s estimated 700 # 000 illegal residents . &quot; A lot of people presume that if immigrants don ' t get aid , they will go_away , &quot; said Angelo Ancheta , executive_director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles . &quot; People won ' t go_back to Tijuana . They will stay in the parks. &quot; Times staff writers Patrick J . McDonnell and Alan C . Miller contributed to this report .</TEXT>
