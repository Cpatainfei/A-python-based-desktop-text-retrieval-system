   <HEADLINE> FIRE AND FLAIR ; HE ' S FLAMBOYANT , SHOWY , COCKSURE AND WIDELY REGARDED AS A SUPERSTAR OF BLACK STUDIES . BUT HARVARD ' S HENRY GATES IS NOT WITHOUT CRITICS . TO THEM , HE SAYS : DEAL WITH IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Talking to him , you get this clear , shining picture of an American childhood that vanished with the 1950s . A wholesome , loving warmth reminiscent_of times gone_by is what you think_of : a dad so devoted he held_down two jobs ; a mom who served as secretary to the PTA ; two boys who had their share of skirmishes , but who always managed to rank first in the class . No one locked their doors in this idyllic village . Almost no one swore . The grandmas wore flower-print aprons . And everyone was , as Henry Louis Gates Jr . puts it , colored . &quot; It ' s what we were in the 1950s , &quot; Gates said . He is not a large man , but he projects an immense presence . His smile exudes unshakable confidence . With precisely that smile , he added : &quot; It ' s endearing. &quot; But not every person who totes around a copy of Gates ' just-published memoir , &quot; Colored People &quot; ( Knopf , 1994 ) , would comfortably share that opinion . Some non-African Americans study the title quizzically , wondering if it espouses some racist tract . Some African Americans are also less than enamored ; Horace Porter , for example , the chairman of the African American Studies department at Stanford_University , coolly said the title &quot; totally suggests his point of view. &quot; In his office overlooking Harvard Square , Gates could not be less troubled . His vast self-assurance enables him to fire off frank opinions with the absolute certainty that the objects of those opinions will have to deal with them on_their_own terms . After all , he mused , he might have called the book &quot; The Melanin in Me , &quot; a title he sometimes uses for lectures . But Gates , 43 , wrote &quot; Colored People &quot; for his daughters , 14-year-old Maggie and Liza , 12 , to whom he writes in his introduction : &quot; In your lifetimes , I suspect , you will go from being African Americans , to ' people_of_color , ' to being , once again ' colored people. ' . . . I have to confess that I like ' colored ' best , maybe because when I hear the word , I hear in it my mother ' s voice and the sepia tones of my childhood. &quot; Already , in the insularity of the ivory_tower , Gates has sprinted forth with a meteoric trajectory that has made him a kind of legend . If his outspokenness were not enough to assure him of that status , colleagues say , his lyrical use of language would be . His scholarship seems above reproach ; as a 30-year-old junior professor at Yale , he was among the first group of MacArthur Foundation &quot; genius grant &quot; recipients . At only 33 , he earned full tenure at Cornell before moving_on to an endowed chair at Duke -- and , now , Harvard . Then there is his amazing network of acquaintances , housed in an obese Rolodex . His enormous circle of friends knows him as &quot; Skip , &quot; the nickname affixed to him as a boy in the strictly segregated mill town of Piedmont , W . Va . Students and faculty at Harvard know him as the W.E.B. DuBois Professor of the Humanities , chairman of the Afro-American Studies Department -- and the man who rattled the dust off John Harvard ' s grave by hiring Spike Lee as a lecturer . It was his first major act of flamboyance three years ago after assuming control of the then-moribund department . The faculty had shrunk to just one full-time professor , prompting Gates to quip that he would n ' t have to clear_out any deadwood &quot; because there ' s no wood at all. &quot; Only 19 students were declaring Afro-American as their &quot; field of concentration , &quot; as Harvard stuffily calls a major . Even some specialists in the subject were not aware Harvard had an Afro-American Studies department . &quot; I needed to pull a rabbit out of a hat , &quot; Gates said , proffering his dauntless smile once again . &quot; Br ' er Rabbit. &quot; Street-talking director Spike Lee , Gates said , was his rabbit . It made this spring ' s announcement that Gates had lured scholar and best-selling author Cornel West away from Princeton less surprising . The number of Afro-American &quot; concentrators &quot; at Harvard had tripled , and the faculty had mushroomed proportionately . Still , Gates said , hiring West was a coup that assured his department new credibility by providing more_than one resident celebrity . * But it is Gates who is most widely regarded_as black studies ' leading luminary . Admirers and detractors alike think_of him as the subject ' s superstar . Former Harvard Law Prof . Derrick Bell , now teaching at New York University , called Gates &quot; the dean of the black academic entrepreneurs. &quot; Peter Gomes , Harvard ' s chaplain and a professor of Christian Morals , gushed to the Boston Globe that Gates is &quot; the Second Coming. &quot; Porter , at Stanford , conceded of Gates that there are those &quot; who feel he is not Afro-centric enough , &quot; those &quot; who feel he sticks his nose in too many peoples ' business &quot; and those &quot; who resent his celebrity. &quot; Nevertheless , Porter described Gates as &quot; an extraordinary person in American intellectual and cultural life right now. &quot; With degrees from Yale and Cambridge -- and honorary_degrees from five universities , including Dartmouth -- Gates ' intellectual credentials are impeccable , said J . Eugene Grigsby , director of UCLA ' s Center for Afro-American Studies . &quot; Clearly he is a very prolific writer , &quot; Grigsby said . But he added that Gates is also &quot; a self-promoter -- and I don ' t mean that in a derogatory manner. &quot; Harvard , Grigsby said , &quot; thinks_of itself as king of the_hill . Skip ' ll fit right in. &quot; But as_to whether Gates should be vaulted to the top of some select academic pantheon , he continued , &quot; I hate it when someone tries to anoint someone . I ' d like to know who the Anglo-Saxon thinker is . So why is it that somebody can anoint ' the Black Intellectual ? ' &quot; Gates has questions along that line himself . &quot; There are 30 million black Americans -- more black Americans than there are Canadians , &quot; he said . &quot; But no one would expect Canadians to speak with one voice. &quot; * Yet even in the rarefied world of academe -- where some people are paid simply to be smart -- black intellectuals are regarded &quot; as if we were ancient Athens , 10 great minds in one room , &quot; Gates said . Excluding Harvard ' s professional schools , Gates is only the third black professor to be hired there , and -- with his joint appointment -- the school ' s first black professor of English . He is acutely aware of the implications of that attainment . Among his generation , Gates said , &quot; ' first black ' is still a modifier. &quot; &quot; There are so few of us , &quot; he said of the black academic community . &quot; And because there are so few of us , we are the crossover generation. &quot; Under such circumstances , Gates reasons , a little showmanship -- maybe even a lot of showmanship -- is not necessarily out_of_order . He is constantly publishing : books , magazine_articles , Op-Ed pieces -- offering his thoughts on everything , it seems , except sports , and maybe he just hasn ' t found time for that . He writes at a stunning pace , cranking_out a first draft of &quot; Colored People , &quot; for example , in six weeks . ( The comforts of an Italian villa , owned by the Rockefeller Foundation , may have helped stir his creative juices a bit. ) Unlike the legions of academics who eschew popular publications , Gates ' byline is just as likely to appear in the New Yorker or the New York Times as some remote scholarly journal . &quot; I do write more_than most people , &quot; Gates said , calling himself &quot; one of the most frequently published authors in black studies. &quot; Among &quot; the humanists , &quot; in fact , as Gates thinks_of himself , &quot; I am No . 1. &quot; Gates more_than displays the success he began earning so early on . He flaunts it . He drives a Mercedes , not exactly the battered antique Volvo of standard academic issue . His suits are exquisitely tailored , no suede elbow patches or dippy knit neckties for this professor , thank_you . At Duke -- which he departed in a well-publicized huff when he was not made head of his department -- Gates , wife Sharon and their two daughters lived_in a house that was said to be 9 # 000 square_feet . At Harvard , his salary is rumored to be among the school ' s very highest . But of course , polite Cantabridgians do not discuss unseemly subjects like money . He takes his cues from carefully chosen role_models -- among them W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T . Washington . His current academic mentor is Brown University President Vartan Gregorian , who advised him : &quot; Skip , turn everything into an event. &quot; * That may have been among his motives in 1990 when he testified in the obscenity trial of the rap_group 2 Live Crew . Gates said the group ' s style reflected the traditional African American heritage of &quot; signifying , &quot; or comical derision . He also argued that the group ' s right to free speech was no different than Madonna ' s -- or any other well-known performer . So some of his activities are perhaps slightly ostentatious , Gates allowed . So what ? &quot; You see , it ' s easy for my white colleagues to criticize me for being entrepreneurial , &quot; he said . &quot; But we have to be entrepreneurial. &quot; But Gates has also drawn fire from some of_his_own peers in African American studies . Partly it ' s envy -- &quot; and I ' d say envy comes_with the territory , &quot; Gates said . But he has also alienated some black scholars who think that he is insufficiently Afro-centric , or that he has overly homogenized the discipline . Mostly he ignores such sniping , sticking_to his position as &quot; a midwife , a conduit to help other people gain access &quot; to his field . He is &quot; trying to carve out a middle ground &quot; that makes the discipline inclusive , Gates said , and to serve in much the same role as &quot; a Talmudic scholar , protecting the traditions. &quot; But sometimes he gets annoyed , lashing_out at the critics who fault him for employing whites in his department . &quot; If someone said I couldn ' t teach Milton because I wasn ' t Anglo-Saxon and blind , I ' d say it was racist garbage , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s no closed_shop here by race. &quot; Gates comes as honestly by his righteousness as by his talent as a raconteur . His late mother set a standard of fearsome excellence . &quot; She believed there was a natural aristocracy , and she was it , &quot; Gates said . Both parents read &quot; all_the time , &quot; and his father -- who , at 81 , spends winters with his younger son and his family -- remains a nonstop storyteller . * Unlike his older brother , an oral surgeon in New Jersey , Skip Gates began school just as the Brown vs . Board_of_Education Supreme Court decision forced desegregation . So while the paper_mill picnics ceased before they would integrate , the schools took a different path . &quot; I became the prince of the school because I was smart , &quot; Gates said . &quot; In that classroom , no one hassled me . Ever. &quot; He paused , and a more modest version of his smile crept onto his face . &quot; It was only years later that I realized how amazing that was , &quot; Gates said . In his own life , he has had &quot; nothing but golden opportunities. &quot; Still , Gates said , &quot; I get angry about the fact that structural inequality has been such a fundamental fact of African American culture. &quot; Early in this century , Gates writes in his new book , black entertainer Bert Williams observed that &quot; it ' s no disgrace to be colored . But it is awfully inconvenient. &quot; Even at the very tip-top of the academic heap , Gates comes_to much the same conclusion today . &quot; Yes ! &quot; he railed . &quot; It is inconvenient , because of white racism . When I walk into a room , people still see my blackness , more_than my Gates-ness , or my literary-ness. &quot; But Gates is an optimist -- a luxury , perhaps , made_possible by his rock-solid family and by his steady course of success . Some things are changing , he said , such_as &quot; the more obvious interplay between race and class. &quot; The world he grew_up in has all but disappeared , Gates said . But some fine remnants have managed to resurface . Only a_few years ago , the African American employees at the paper_mill in Piedmont , W . Va. , decided to resurrect their traditional picnic . And this time , the white employees asked if they could come , too .</TEXT>
