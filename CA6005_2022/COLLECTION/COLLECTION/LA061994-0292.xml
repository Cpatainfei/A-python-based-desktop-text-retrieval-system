   <HEADLINE> SIMPSON UNDER SUICIDE WATCH AS D.A. MOVES TO INDICT HIM ; CRIME : BUT GRAND_JURY PROCEEDINGS HIT A SNAG AS THE FIRST WITNESS REPORTEDLY DEMANDS IMMUNITY . ARRAIGNMENT OF THE FOOTBALL LEGEND IS EXPECTED MONDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A day after being captured outside his 5 # 700-square-foot Brentwood estate , football legend O.J. Simpson spent Saturday under suicide watch in a 7-by-9-foot jail_cell , where he is being held without bail as prosecutors prepare to seek murder indictments from the county grand_jury . The 46-year-old Hall_of_Fame running_back , whose bizarre low-speed escapade through freeway traffic Friday capped a week of morbid melodrama , is expected to be arraigned Monday on charges that he fatally stabbed his ex-wife and her male friend in a bloody June 12 attack . His attorney , Robert L . Shapiro , who failed earlier to surrender Simpson as promised , described his client as distraught and emotionally drained . &quot; He was morose . He was exceedingly depressed . And he was in tears , &quot; Shapiro said outside the Men ' s Central Jail , where a deputy is_on guard to keep Simpson from harming himself . &quot; And his words to me were that he apologized to me and to everyone else for what he put people through ( Friday ) . &quot; Among the day ' s developments : * Prosecutors have convened the Los Angeles County Grand_Jury , according to sources , who said that the first witness was called Friday . Officials are using the closed-door proceedings to avoid the spectacle of a preliminary hearing , but they hit a snag after the unidentified witness reportedly refused to testify unless granted immunity . * Although no decision has been made about seeking the death_penalty , Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti said that he may use Simpson ' s attempted escape as evidence of guilt in the brutal slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson , 35 , and her friend , 25-year-old Westside waiter Ronald Lyle Goldman . * Los Angeles Police_Chief Willie L . Williams said the suggestion that Simpson was given special police treatment that afforded him the opportunity to flee was &quot; one of the dumbest statements &quot; he had heard . He added that suspects frequently have been given the chance to voluntarily surrender : &quot; The difference was the world wasn ' t watching. &quot; * Simpson ' s best_friend and former teammate , Al Cowlings , who was arrested for aiding him during the nationally televised two-hour pursuit , was released early Saturday on $ 250 # 000 bail . Storming past reporters later in the day outside a friend ' s Pacific Palisades home , Cowlings hurled expletives and snarled : &quot; Don ' t you have no respect ? &quot; * Several high-powered attorneys acknowledged that they had been approached by friends of Simpson to help mount his defense . Cowlings ' attorney , Donald M . Re , speculated that Simpson ' s aberrant behavior Friday could be a sign he is mentally disturbed . * Although the circus-like atmosphere that surrounded Simpson ' s brief time as a fugitive had subsided , sharp emotions continued to swirl . Some feminist advocates reacted angrily to the cheering crowds that rooted for Simpson ' s escape , while some African American activists contended that Simpson had been unfairly convicted by the mostly white news media . * In their first extended remarks since the slaying of their daughter , the family of Nicole Brown Simpson issued a statement Saturday , saying that her young children have demonstrated &quot; the uncanny ability to momentarily set_aside life ' s bitterness to enjoy life ' s goodness &quot; during the past week of tragedy and sadness . &quot; By no means are things ' normal , ' so to speak , but with the immense love and support we are all receiving from each other , we will all survive stronger in spirit , stronger as people , and stronger as a family , &quot; said the statement , which was also signed by Jason and Arnelle Simpson , O.J. Simpson ' s children from his first marriage . Sydney and Justin Simpson , ages 9 and 6 , have spent the last few days at their grandparents ' home_in Monarch Bay riding bikes , fishing , going_to the beach and playing handball , POGs and video_games with their cousins and friends . They also received counseling from a family priest , who said he has explained the concepts of God , death and heaven during a discussion with them . &quot; We talked_about where Mom had gone and they asked me some things about heaven and I tried to answer them , &quot; said the Rev . Bruce Lavery , who officiated at their mother ' s service Thursday at Ascension Cemetery in Lake Forest . &quot; The children were very , very aware that something had happened but they acted like any children : They would be solemn for a while and then start playing a game or playing with their toys again. &quot; Nicole Simpson ' s older sister , Denise Brown , said the children were doing &quot; surprisingly great &quot; in their efforts to cope_with the traumas of the week . &quot; They ' re pretty strong , &quot; she said . By contrast , the former football star was described as fragile . About noon , Shapiro and others met for several hours with Simpson in his jail_cell . After the visit , much of which Simpson reportedly spent talking to a psychiatrist , Shapiro underscored his concerns for Simpson ' s mental_state . &quot; We did not discuss the case , &quot; he said . &quot; Our primary concern now is for his mental and emotional welfare. &quot; Accompanying Shapiro were Simpson ' s civil lawyer , Leroy Taft , close friend Robert Kardashian and attorney Howard Weitzman , a friend of Simpson who had represented him in the early stages of the investigation . &quot; He is distraught . He is upset , and we are very concerned about him , &quot; Weitzman said of Simpson , who he said was dressed in a jail jumpsuit . In the first indication of how prosecutors plan to handle the high-profile case , sources told The Times that the district_attorney ' s office had convened the grand_jury Friday . The first witness they attempted to question , however , declined to testify on the grounds that he could incriminate himself , according to sources close to the case . That sparked heated objections from Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark , the lead prosecutor . A closed hearing was held , after which Superior_Court Judge J . Stephen Czuleger ruled that the witness was entitled to invoke the 5th Amendment . The witness was scheduled to be called again this week , but it was unclear Saturday whether he would testify . His attorney , William Genego , declined to comment . Prosecutors could not be reached . Garcetti , the county ' s top prosecutor , said in a news_conference outside Parker Center that Simpson would probably be arraigned Monday on the two murder_charges . He also acknowledged that Friday ' s outpouring of support for Simpson could foreshadow problems in getting a guilty verdict when the former football great is brought_to trial . &quot; There is no doubt that O.J. Simpson -- the persona , the hero of O.J. Simpson -- is something that most people don ' t want to let_go_of , &quot; Garcetti said . &quot; I mean this was a man . A beauty . A grace . A talent . He had succeeded . He had been through tough times and he had made_it , made_it big . And he was doing_good things . Unfortunately , we now have a set of circumstances that change that entirely. &quot; Garcetti was joined by Williams , who had cut_short a trip to Philadelphia to fend_off criticism that Simpson had managed to escape because he received preferential treatment . &quot; We have had hundreds of people in the city of Los Angeles who have committed crimes -- robbery , burglary , assault , rape , shoplifting -- who have surrendered . . . people who have surrendered to some of you in the media , &quot; Williams said . &quot; The difference was the world wasn ' t watching and if the person didn ' t show_up , we went_out and got them that afternoon or the next day and no one knew about it. &quot; Legal experts said Saturday that Simpson ' s strange behavior seems to have generated a degree of sympathy and could be turned_to his advantage . Hoping to assemble a high-octane defense_team , Simpson ' s advisers were busy contacting some of the region ' s top legal minds . Among those approached was Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , who represents pop star Michael Jackson . But Cochran said his close personal_relationship with Simpson would make_it difficult for him to serve as one of his attorneys . &quot; I know him , I care about him , &quot; Cochran said . &quot; I just think the way I feel about him would preclude me from giving him the best representation possible . It would be like ( defending ) a member of the family. &quot; One member of Simpson ' s legal team , respected forensic scientist Henry Lee , reportedly left town Saturday after examining a cut on Simpson ' s hand . His lawyers contend that Simpson cut himself after slamming down a water_glass upon being informed of his ex-wife ' s death . Police sources suspect he was slashed during the fatal attack . Lee , according to the Chinese Daily News , said there was no proof of that . &quot; There are some indications -- circumstantial_evidence and motive provided by the police -- but there is no direct_evidence , so the evidence is not conclusive , &quot; Lee , speaking Chinese , told the paper . Although Saturday seemed a lull after the previous day ' s spectacular events , a growing chorus of criticism about the case suggested that it had sparked a potentially polarizing debate . &quot; This thing is really a complicated mess all_of sudden , once you get past the chase , &quot; said political_scientist Raphael Sonenshein , who wrote a recent book on race and politics in Los Angeles . In the city ' s African American community , there was widespread concern that the sensational , wall-to-wall coverage of the case may have had much to do with the fact that the victims were white and Simpson is black . Even before Simpson was booked for the murders Friday evening , a_few supporters at his Brentwood estate and at Parker Center were chanting , &quot; Free O.J. ! &quot; &quot; People will be watching very closely around the issues of equity and fairness , &quot; Anthony Thigpen , a South-Central Los Angeles community activist , said in an interview Saturday . &quot; There is a certain concern on the part of the African American community that there has been almost a persecution of him , and his ethnicity has something to do with it. &quot; Those worries had been voiced the day before in Minneapolis , where the Rev . Jesse Jackson and the president of a national black press organization accused Los Angeles police and reporters of mishandling the case . &quot; There ' s been a trial in the newsrooms before it got_to the courtrooms , &quot; Jackson told reporters at the National Newspaper_Publishers Assn . convention . &quot; We only hope that justice prevails. &quot; The Rev . Carl Washington , founder of a South-Central Los Angeles ministers ' group , told a news_conference Saturday that he believes Simpson will receive a fair trial and urged young people to &quot; let justice take its course. &quot; Washington , who works with gang members , called_on young people to refrain_from gathering at the courts , police_headquarters , or the Simpson estate as they have in recent days . Feminists , meanwhile , were critical of the case for just the opposite reason . They complained that the way reports of Simpson ' s past abuse were handled -- especially the 1989 New Year ' s beating of his wife -- exemplified the short_shrift society continues to accord women and the issue of domestic violence . Rather than being unique , the wealthy football star is distressingly typical of battering husbands , said Tammy Bruce , president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization for Women . &quot; One thing O.J. kept saying in the police report was , ' This is private , this is family . I can handle this . This is none of your business. ' It ' s an attitude that runs_through the system , &quot; Bruce said . She added that Simpson ' s letter to the public in which he said he felt_like a battered husband was &quot; classic. &quot; &quot; He ' s trying to manipulate us into believing he was the one who was wronged , and that the press is battering him , and after all_the good he ' s done for everyone , why is this happening to him ? &quot; she said . &quot; This is absolutely classic. &quot; Almost immediately after the bodies of his former wife and her friend were discovered outside her Brentwood townhouse , suspicion began to focus_on the famed running_back . Two bloodstained gloves were recovered , police sources said , one at the scene and one at Simpson ' s home . Bloodstains on the walkway where the bodies were found reportedly matched Simpson ' s blood_type -- a fact that did not help Simpson ' s case , although it did not prove the blood was his . On Friday , sources reported that drops of blood found inside Simpson ' s home matched his ex-wife ' s type . After attending her funeral Thursday afternoon , Simpson was taken_to the San Fernando Valley home of a longtime friend , where he was sedated by physicians . On Friday morning , he was notified by his lawyer that two murder_charges were about to be filed and that he was expected to surrender by 11 a.m. Although Shapiro said his client was not tipped_off that police were_on the way , Simpson seized the opportunity to slip out of the sprawling Encino home with Cowlings , sparking a widespread manhunt . Over the next few hours a phalanx of officers trailed the car while Simpson reportedly held a gun to his head . The chase ended 60 miles later , on the driveway of Simpson ' s Brentwood estate . Cowlings walked_out_of the car and surrendered . An hour later , the LAPD Special Weapons and Tactics team had coaxed Simpson out . Before being booked , he was allowed to call his mother , use the bathroom and have a drink of juice . &quot; I ' m sorry_for putting you guys out , &quot; Simpson told the officers . &quot; I ' m sorry_for making you do this. &quot; Times staff writers Jesse Katz , Josh Meyer , Rebecca Trounson and Lynn Smith contributed to this story .
