   <HEADLINE> VEGETARIAN WITH A THAI TWIST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ordering vegetarian food in Asian restaurants can be a challenge , because dishes may be seasoned with meat and fish products that aren ' t apparent to the eye . Chinese chefs add a dash of chicken_broth to make sauce . Japanese use dashi , which is based on dried fish . Thai cooks rely_on fish sauce for saltiness and mix shrimp paste into dips and curry pastes . Vietnamese combine fish sauce with vinegar and sugar for nuoc cham , a dipping sauce . A strict vegetarian has to specify that such seasonings not be used . Otherwise , even dishes that appear to be meatless could be suspect . At a Thai restaurant in Hollywood , the waitress guaranteed that vegetarian dishes would not contain the offending seasonings . Soy_sauce would replace fish sauce , she said , and the curry paste was made without shrimp paste . A meal of vegetable curry , hot and sour mushroom soup , pan-fried glass noodles and egg_rolls was refreshing and light -- like spa food , but not much like Thai food . The flavors weren ' t as lively as they should be . &quot; Vegetarian eating and cooking is really not part of the Thai tradition as I understand it , &quot; says Edward J . McDonnell , an ordained Buddhist minister who teaches fundamentals of Buddhism at the Wat Thai of Los Angeles . &quot; One would be hard pressed to find a Thai dish that did not have some meat product in it. &quot; * In Buddhist countries , vegetarianism can be a religious obligation . Mahayana Buddhism , practiced in China , Japan , parts of Vietnam and Korea , is strictly vegetarian . Some practitioners even avoid garlic , onion and chiles , believing they inflame the passions . Theravada Buddhism , which is followed in Thailand , Sri Lanka , Burma , Laos and Cambodia , does not prohibit meat . Monks are permitted to eat it . And a book on Thai Buddhism published in Bangkok states that the_Buddha ate pork at his final meal . A recent lunch at the Wat , a Buddhist temple in North Hollywood , included fried chicken and other non-vegetarian foods brought by parishioners for the monks . For a Thai , vegetarianism would be a personal decision , McDonnell says . &quot; It would be a complete change from the normal style of Thai cooking. &quot; Thai vegetarian food can be very good , however , when prepared by an expert such_as Sisamon Kongpan , cookbook author and associate dean of the Faculty of Home_Economics at the Rajamangala Institute of Technology in Bangkok . * These recipes are from Kongpan ' s book , &quot; The Best of Thai Vegetarian Food , &quot; published in Thailand by Sangdad Publishing Co . The salad makes a wonderful main dish . In Thailand , the mushroom soup would be made with fresh straw_mushrooms , but canned can be substituted . In the fried_rice , such typical Thai garnishes as shrimp and egg are replaced with pineapple , corn and red kidney_beans .
