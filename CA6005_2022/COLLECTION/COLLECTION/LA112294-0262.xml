   <HEADLINE> SHEIK ' S ILLNESS DELAYS BOMBING PLOT TRIAL ; NEW YORK : MUSLIM CLERIC AND 11 OTHER DEFENDANTS ARE ACCUSED OF A TERRORIST CONSPIRACY AS PART OF A U.S. JIHAD . COURT DATE IS MOVED TO JANUARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal judge on Monday postponed until early January the trial of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and 11 other defendants charged with plotting a war of urban terrorism , because the blind Egyptian cleric remains hospitalized with pneumonia . Defense_lawyers said they expected Abdel Rahman , 56 , who is diabetic and has heart_disease , to return to his cell by the end of the week but that he would be too weak to stand trial . &quot; I don ' t have any choice , &quot; Judge Michael B . Mukasey said , postponing jury selection until Jan . 9 . According to a 100-page memorandum opposing defendants ' pretrial motions , the government contends that as early as 1989 , an Islamic jihad organization existed in the United States which trained for , planned and carried_out terrorist acts in New York , including the World Trade Center bombing in February , 1993 , and the assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane , founder of the militant Jewish Defense League , in 1990 . Prosecutors charge that Abdel Rahman became the leader of the U.S. jihad and &quot; played a key role both in articulating and defining &quot; its organization and acts . When the trial begins , the government will argue that the sheik &quot; provided necessary counsel &quot; on whether acts of terrorism &quot; were permissible or forbidden under his radical interpretation of Islamic law. &quot; Prosecutors also plan to introduce evidence that the killing of Kahane immediately after his speech at the Marriott East_Side Hotel on Nov . 5 , 1990 , was planned and carried_out to further the aims of the jihad . The government will charge that El Sayyid Nosair shot Kahane and was assisted by other members of a jihad and that the fingerprints of Mohammed A . Salameh and Nidal Ayyad , two of the defendants convicted of bombing the World Trade Center , were found in Nosair ' s car , which was abandoned in a no-parking zone near the hotel . The court papers also charge that Mahmud Abouhalima , a third Trade Center defendant who was found guilty , &quot; was the intended getaway driver and failed to station himself properly for the anticipated rendezvous with Nosair. &quot; A New York state jury acquitted Nosair of murder but convicted him of weapon charges . Prosecutors charge members of the jihad planned political kidnapings in an effort to free Nosair from the state_prison where he is serving more_than 20 years . He is one of the defendants in the upcoming federal trial . Prosecutors charged that Nosair organized paramilitary training for jihad members both in the United States and overseas . After his arrest , court papers charge that Nosair continued to consult with other jihad members about acts of terrorism . Abdel Rahman has been in prison for more_than a year . Prosecutors say the targets of the conspiracy included the United Nations , two tunnels linking New York with New Jersey and the federal building housing the Manhattan field office of the FBI . Defense_lawyers on Monday tried to have an alleged conversation between the sheik and Emad Ali Salem striken from evidence . Salem was the sheik ' s bodyguard and is now the government ' s chief informant in the case . According to court papers , Salem asked Abdel Rahman what he thought_about the plan to bomb the federal building . When Salem indicated that the plan was in motion , the cleric allegedy responded : &quot; It doesn ' t matter . Slow down . Slow down a little bit . The one who killed Kennedy was trained for three years. &quot; Lawyers in the case say the reference apparently is to Sirhan Sirhan , the Jordanian immigrant who assassinated Sen . Robert F . Kennedy while he was campaigning in Los Angeles for the presidency in 1968 . The defendants also are charged with planning to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during a trip to New York to address the United Nations . &quot; The evidence the government seeks to introduce in connection with the Kahane homicide and the Mubarak murder plot is directly relevant proof that the defendants were members of a terrorist conspiracy which viewed the West as a monolithic enemy , under the direction of the United States , that oppressed Muslims and was a lifeline to Israel and Zionists , &quot; prosecutors said in the memorandum . The memorandum further charged that the agreement to &quot; wage war &quot; against the United States was &quot; fully operational before the Kahane homicide. &quot; &quot; The attack on Rabbi Kahane did not occur in a vacuum , &quot; prosecutors said . &quot; It was a small , albeit brutal , step_in a terrorist campaign which comprehended not only assassinations of individuals but the mass destruction of political , social and economic assets of the ' infidel ' West , of which the United States was deemed the leader. &quot;</TEXT>
