   <HEADLINE> CREWS BRACE FOR POSSIBLE MUDSLIDES ; DISASTER : TWO AFTERSHOCKS STARTLE SLEEPERS . OFFICIALS URGE TENT DWELLERS TO MOVE INDOORS AS STORM MOVES IN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A day after being buffeted by a pair of strong aftershocks , the Southland is bracing for the strongest storm of the winter season today , increasing the risk of mudslides and flash-flooding in fire and quake-ravaged regions . Storm preparations come as the area is still jittery from two aftershocks early Sunday that roused quake-weary residents . The first , at 5:19 a.m. , measured magnitude 4.1 , a Caltech seismologist said . It was the 44th aftershock to register 4.0 or higher since the Jan . 17 earthquake , and was followed by a second jolt at 5:22 a.m. that measured 3.6. Nearly one-fourth of the 3 # 600 measurable aftershocks have registered 3.0 or better . The two tremors , which caused no apparent damage , were centered about two miles east-northeast of Granada Hills , according to Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton . Meanwhile , the storm , which arrived Sunday night , is expected to unload one to two inches of rain in the Los Angeles Basin , with even more precipitation expected in the mountains , where as much as a foot of snow may fall above the 4 # 000-foot level . &quot; It ' s pretty big , a lot bigger than the last one , &quot; said meteorologist Dean Jones of WeatherData Inc. , in Wichita , Kan . &quot; There could be flash-flooding and mudslides , especially in the areas hit by the October fires , where the land is still barren . Heavy rains in those areas could cause some problems. &quot; In anticipation of the storm , Los Angeles County firefighters have put more crews on_duty and readied two sand-filled dump_trucks for emergency sandbagging in mudslide-prone areas . The department ' s swift-water rescue team has been placed on alert . The storm was also expected to churn_up high_tides and surf on west-facing beaches today , making swimming and surfing risky , forecasters said . The Cooperative Medfly Project said Sunday that any rains today would delay until at least Tuesday the aerial spraying of malathion over an 18-square-mile area of Corona . The controversial pesticide spraying was scheduled for tonight . Because of the storms , quake victims who are still living_in makeshift homes and tents are being urged to seek cover at Red_Cross permanent shelters . American Red_Cross officials reported Sunday that they had closed the last two of what had been more_than a dozen formal tent shelters after persuading the residents to move indoors . Red_Cross spokeswoman Peggy Hinz said a handful of residents remaining at the large tent at Church on the Way in Van Nuys moved to indoor shelters , and about 100 from the Le Conte Junior_High_School shelter in Hollywood were taken by van to two indoor shelters . Originally , Red_Cross officials had erected the large tents outside some of their indoor shelters -- not because of a shortage of indoor space , but because many who came seeking aid were reluctant to stay indoors in the wake of the earthquake . But the expected heavy rains led Red_Cross officials to hasten the phase-out of their tents . Around Southern California , officials conceded that many people remain outdoors , living_in their own smaller tents , either outside damaged homes or at schools and parks . Disaster assistance workers have been venturing into hard-hit neighborhoods to reach them , encouraging them to seek help at government disaster assistance centers . Officials also said 26 shelters run_by the American Red_Cross and the Salvation_Army remain open , housing about 3 # 000 people . The Red_Cross reported that it has housed a total of 23 # 872 people , at a total of 47 shelters , since the earthquake . The Red_Cross also served more_than a_million meals at the shelters and from 127 mobile food vans . The agency reported that it has spent more_than $ 3.6 million in various quake relief efforts and expects to spend a total of $ 36 million . At a daily briefing on earthquake relief efforts , federal and state officials reported that so far : * 286 # 268 victims have registered for state and federal assistance , either at disaster application centers or via a toll-free &quot; tele-registration &quot; telephone_number , ( 800 ) 462-9021 . Outreach workers are continuing their efforts to identify the many victims who have not applied for help , said Jose Bravo , deputy federal coordinating officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency . * 31 # 258 federal temporary housing checks , totaling $ 97.8 million , have been issued to help victims with rent and other housing needs . &quot; We ' re seeing record speed in getting people housing , &quot; said Paul Flores , deputy director of the state Office of Emergency Services . * 890 home and commercial loans , valued at $ 28.6 million , have been approved by the Small Business Administration . Officials say the disaster relief applications from the Northridge quake were expected to surpass the record of 304 # 000 from Hurricane Hugo by Sunday or today . * Because of an overwhelming demand for help , a disaster application center in the Pico-Union area will open at 1 p.m. Tuesday at the Toberman Recreation Center , 1725 Toberman St . The center will be open until 7 p.m. Tuesday and from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily thereafter . Federal_officials initially moved a temporary mobile office into the area , expecting to help about 200 people over a_few days . But the mobile unit ' s staff has so far served more_than 1 # 300 people . The Toberman site is the 21st assistance center opened by relief officials . Another 13 mobile units are serving smaller communities . Quake victims can apply for a number of federal , state and local assistance programs at the centers . In addition to FEMA officials , representatives from various other agencies , including the Small Business Administration and the Department of Motor_Vehicles , help staff the centers .
