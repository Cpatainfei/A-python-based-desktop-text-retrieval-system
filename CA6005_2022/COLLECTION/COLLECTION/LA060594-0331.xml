   <HEADLINE> POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES : ALL-TIME FUMBLE ; USC ALUMNI HALL OF FAME VOTERS INSULT FOOTBALL_PLAYERS WHO MADE SCHOOL NATIONALLY PROMINENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When this was a younger century , USC football moved_in and up as practically all there was to Los Angeles sports . Little else of importance found its way onto the sports pages of the city ' s five or six daily newspapers . And in the American South , East and Midwest , where , before television , before air_travel , the West Coast seemed a distant , mythic dream , few sports fans even knew there was anything else out here . What they did know about was Trojan football . For , in the late ' 20s and early ' 30s , the opening of transcontinental radio sports coverage coincided with the beginnings of USC ' s football greatness . In that era , the Trojans always seemed to be heading for , playing in , or at least playing for the Rose Bowl -- once getting there three times in four years , and winning all three . Or they were winning national football championships -- three in five years . Or they were struggling with Knute Rockne , whose Notre Dame teams won three one-point decisions from USC in four years , 13-12 , 7-6 , and 13-12 . In the midst of all that , the Trojans beat Rockne in 1928 , 27-14 . Those Trojans , indeed , won half of their school ' s first eight Notre Dame games -- and most of their other games as well -- as millions of Americans learned for the first time about the University of Southern California . Or , as they ' ve usually called it , Southern Cal . that ' s how , in one decade , a provincial little Los Angeles school in the disconnected Far West was transformed into a national institution -- a national power . And 10 Trojans had the most to do with it . As the 1920s rolled into the ' 30s , a football_coach named Howard Jones and his nine consensus All-Americans led USC into a national prominence that it has held since . Accordingly , when USC finally got_around_to establishing an athletic Hall_of_Fame this year , those 10 should have been the first -- and only -- Trojans elected . Instead , when the 52 voters -- mostly younger alumni -- selected 16 athletes and others for the introductory Hall_of_Fame class , they got 15 names wrong . Of the history-makers who deserve election , they recognized only the coach , Jones . That was an extraordinary affront to the rest of those who helped get USC going . In truth , only four of those the electors chose -- O.J. Simpson , John McKay , Braven Dyer and Jones -- should even have been considered . And of these , on reflection , only Jones rates membership in the charter class . Most of the 52 voters , whoever they are , plainly lack both a sense of history at their own university and any interest in reading up_on it . Theirs is an all-time fumble . THE REAL HALL OF FAME On any big-news meter these days , a sports hall_of_fame isn ' t in it with Bosnia , perhaps , or even the NBA playoffs . Still , injustice is injustice , wherever you find it . And in this case , USC ' s alumni have wronged the school ' s first nine All-Americans , four of whom , lining_up as tailbacks , were called quarterbacks : Mort Kaer , Morley Drury , Gaius Shaver and Cotton Warburton . In a single-wing system , one was a blocking back , Erny Pinckert . And four were linemen : tackles Jess Hibbs and Ernie Smith , and guards Johnny Baker and Aaron Rosenberg . And without them , you can ' t have a valid Hall_of_Fame . Not at USC . They and 11 teammates in particular -- the 11 others who earned All-American or other distinctive attention in that generation -- were the true founders of USC athletics . They were the players who , in 1925-33 , during Jones ' first nine years in Los Angeles , led the Trojans through nine big-winning seasons ; who in one three-year stretch played a record 28 games without losing , and who played before crowds ranging up_to 100 # 000 at the Coliseum and 120 # 000 at Chicago ' s Soldier Field . And so , when the time comes for USC ' s alumni to expand their Hall_of_Fame next spring , they should elect a class of 20 -- starting with the nine players who should have made_it this year and adding in the 11 who deserve to make_it next year . Here ' s what they all did : * Four helped lead USC ' s 1928-29 football_teams to a national championship one season and a Rose Bowl victory the next : end Francis Tappaan , lineman Nate Barragar , and backs Russ Saunders and Marshall Duffield . * Five others helped take USC to a pair of Rose Bowl victories as leaders of the 1929 and 1931 teams and to the 1931 national championship : end Garrett Arbelbide , linemen Baker and Stan Williamson , and backs Shaver and Pinckert . * Enrolling in the early ' 30s , six other USC football_players helped lead their university to two national championships and two Rose Bowl victories on the 1931 and ' 32 teams : end Ray Sparling , linemen Smith , Rosenberg and Tay Brown , and backs Orv Mohler and Homer Griffith . * Five other key Trojans were_on teams that either began or ended the history-turning Jones decade . The school ' s first two great backs , Kaer and Drury , started it all off in the middle ' 20s with linemen Hibbs and Brice Taylor . In 1932 and ' 33 , when USC twice blanked Notre Dame , Warburton climaxed the Hall-of-Fame-decade-that-wasn ' t . Earlier this year , a USC alumni faction voted a different group of late-comers into the strange new Hall-of-Fame-that-is : Jon Arnett , Mike Garrett , Frank Gifford , Simpson ( football ) ; Fred Lynn ( baseball ) ; Buster Crabbe ( swimming ) ; Al Geiberger ( golf ) ; Parry O ' Brien ( track_and_field ) ; Bill Sharman ( basketball ) ; Stan Smith ( tennis ) ; Norman Topping ( administration ) ; Dyer ( sportswriting ) ; Jones , McKay , Marv Goux , Rod Dedeaux ( special awards ) . The historic contribution of 15 of these 16 has been to sustain their heritage . And for doing_it well , they , along with football stars Marcus Allen , Grenny Lansdell and Pat Haden , deserve early Hall_of_Fame membership . But not yet . Soon , but not yet . THEY MADE A GREAT UNIVERSITY The sports fans who throughout America tuned into the earliest transcontinental broadcasts -- hearing about Pinckert and Arbelbide and Johnny Baker for the first time in the 1920s -- are mostly all gone now . So are many of the millions who , in all 48 states , read all about it in their hometown newspapers . Yet the impression of excellence that USC first made on a big country nearly 70 years ago is still there . As one consequence , historians credit USC ' s early football_teams with a proud achievement : putting Los Angeles on the national sports map . That wasn ' t , however , the best thing they did . Their principal achievement was putting USC on the national university map . They built the foundation on which USC has erected a great educational_institution that might have had trouble reaching such heights without its football_teams -- particularly in a state crowded with so many other great schools , from UCLA and Caltech to Cal and Stanford . As John Hubbard , professor emeritus of history , formerly president of USC , noted in a 1980 Times interview , &quot; a half century of success in football &quot; has largely made USC what it is . Hubbard concluded that three winning coaches -- Jones , McKay and John Robinson -- have taken the university so far that , ironically , &quot; USC athletics has become no more_than a handsome auxiliary to one of the nation ' s fine academic institutions. &quot; Trojan football_teams slumped awhile after the Hubbard era , but they seem to be coming_back , now that Robinson has returned . And under 1990s President Steven B . Sample , USC has continued to attract eminent new scholars as well as an envied endowment . Thus in any reckoning of the American universities that for many decades have been_best known throughout the 50 states , USC is up there with Notre Dame , Harvard and Stanford . And their football_teams played a major role in bringing each to the attention of the nation : * Harvard helped invent football . And a Harvard team later played in the Rose Bowl -- and won -- long before USC ever got there . * For many years , football has also advertised Stanford , whose 1925 Rose Bowl team lost to Notre Dame ' s Four Horsemen six months before Howard Jones landed at USC . * As for USC and Notre Dame , their intersectional football series has been America ' s most celebrated since Jones and Rockne . In Los Angeles , it wasn ' t baseball , obviously , that introduced USC to the nation . And it wasn ' t swimming , golf , tennis or track -- which , curiously , were all represented in the Trojans ' first Hall_of_Fame class , and which have something else in common : Their public followings are so small that USC ' s football program must support them all . Long before there was midget auto racing in Hollywood , long before Benny Goodman played the Palomar , long before the arrival of the Raiders or Dodgers or Rams -- even before UCLA -- there was USC football . Nothing else mattered . Everyone who can read knows that . For USC ' s alumni , what matters now is their next vote .</TEXT>
