   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : OIL SPILL CLEANUP NEARS COMPLETION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> State wildlife officials declared the cleanup of an oil spill at McGrath Lake to be 90 % complete Tuesday . The only remaining question is the potential contamination of sediment at the bottom of the lake . Sediment samples are still being analyzed . But those samples are not likely to show enough contamination to warrant excavation , said Heidi Togstad , environmental specialist with the California Department of Fish and Game ' s oil spill prevention and response office . Officials discovered on Christmas_Day that a broken pipeline had spilled more_than 84 # 000 gallons of crude_oil onto the beach and wetlands and into the lake near McGrath State Beach . About 215 birds and other animals were found dead in the area after the spill . Berry Petroleum said in a report issued Jan . 21 that the cause of the spill was still unknown . But the Regional Water Quality_Control Board has asked_for further information . Meanwhile , cleanup continued in the Santa Clara River east of Piru , where a pipeline that ruptured during the Jan . 17 earthquake spilled 214 # 000 gallons of crude . The cleanup is about 25 % complete , said Fish and Game spokesman Bob Schlicting . Atlantic Richfield , parent company of Four Corners Pipeline , still has 524 people working_at the site to collect the oil . &quot; There are still places where there are pretty thick concentrations of oil , &quot; Schlicting said . &quot; There are also some areas where the oil has seeped deep into the ground and possibly into the ground-water table. &quot; Cleanup is expected to continue there for at least a_few more weeks , he said . Wildlife officials have collected 645 dead fish , 31 dead birds and another 25 oiled birds . JOANNA M . MILLER</TEXT>
