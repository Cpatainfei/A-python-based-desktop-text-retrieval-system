   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEWS ; ' REFLECTIONS ON CINEMA ' OFFERS TARNISHED PERSPECTIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like many art films , the group exhibition &quot; Screening Space : Reflections on Cinema in Recent L.A. Art &quot; is more rewarding to think_about than to see . Curated for Jan Kesner Gallery by artist Charles LaBelle , this 10-artist show is an intelligent if overly literal meditation on Hollywood ' s influence on everyday life . Predominantly made of low-tech leftovers scavenged from the movie_industry , it has the feel of a countercultural rebellion . Its pieces embody substantial disdain for a monolithic industry , while acknowledging how badly the odds are stacked against the artists . The work of each artist seems doomed when it tries to challenge Hollywood ' s well-financed power . There ' s something pathetic about Carter Potter ' s paintings made from strips of film wrapped around stretcher bars , Bruce and Norman Yonemoto ' s squares of home-movie screens stitched into a grid , and Jody Zellen ' s collaged magazines photo-transferred to window_blinds . Likewise , Cindy Bernard ' s photographs of locations where old movies were shot were made so_long after the fact that they resonate only for fanatical film buffs . Brad Dunning ' s increasingly blurry and finally blacked-out film stills from &quot; The Postman Always Rings Twice &quot; offer a slow-motion replay of Bernard ' s sendup of film ' s aura . Chris Komater and Mary Parker strike hollow poses . He collages his face over those of actors and actresses in stills from film noir classics , and she dresses_up as &quot; Maryboro , &quot; a transsexual version of the Marlboro man . Having worked as a propman and gallery assistant , Kevin White is the only artist whose understanding of Hollywood runs deeper than a layman ' s . His three pieces combine film ' s capacity to create compelling illusions with art ' s similar goals . White ' s exact clay , foam and plastic duplications of antique icons from Asia seamlessly fuse real_life and the movies . By playing Hollywood ' s game on its own terms , he raises the stakes of the exhibition , suggesting that the best way to undermine the status_quo is not by frontal assault , but by sneaky infiltration . * Jan Kesner Gallery , 164 N . La Brea Ave. , ( 213 ) 938-6834 , through Aug . 29 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * Mixed Media : Jamey Bair ' s solo show at 1301 looks_like a group exhibition . Its four sculptures , three paintings and six photographs share very little stylistically and only tentatively resemble the young , L.A.-based artist ' s earlier work . Although many artists since the 1960s have built prominent bodies_of_work in diverse media , few with as much talent as Bair have followed this strategy as ineffectively as he has . His mix of media does not appear to be part of an ambitious conceptual program but seems to result from confusion and laziness . Confusion is an essential ingredient of art that strives to do more_than illustrate ideas . Even laziness can be interesting . The problem with Bair ' s show is that it doesn ' t put either element to good use . His lead sculptures , cast from Lincoln Logs , Milk Bone dog_biscuits , a light_bulb and a small slide viewer , are little more_than trinkets made from a poisonous material . His canvases , which consist_of dozens of layers of oil and resin , look_like muddy , muddled reprises of previous paintings depicting giant eyeballs or tiny optical explosions . In contrast to these half-baked bodies_of_work , Bair ' s super-saturated close-up photographs of snapdragons are not infatuated with their own glibness or plagued by cool insincerity . Their sumptuousness is stunning . Made with many filters , these intense , vivid pictures are more beautiful than meticulously cultivated gardens or gorgeous floral arrangements . Ravishing light seems to radiate from behind them . These handsomely framed prints look_like liquid stained-glass_windows through which a surplus of sunlight incessantly pours . Bair ' s photographs of flowers do more_than steal the show . They reveal the depth of a largely untested talent . * 1301 , 1301 Franklin St. , Santa Monica , ( 310 ) 828-9133 , through Aug . 27 . Closed Sundays through Wednesdays .</TEXT>
