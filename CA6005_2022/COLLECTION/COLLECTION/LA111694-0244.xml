   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA : A BULLISH VOTE FOR THE FUTURE ; EL TORO AIRPORT-CONVERSION PLAN IS KEY FOR ORANGE COUNTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With a narrow vote and many misgivings , a future industrial power asserted itself last week . Orange County voters approved a ballot proposal to turn El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station into a major commercial airport when the Defense_Department hands_over the military facility in 1999 . Many residents -- especially in Lake Forest , Laguna Hills and other south county communities adjacent to El Toro -- were dismayed . With traffic already congested in the once semi-rural area of open fields and rolling canyons , they saw a future airport making Orange County more like its raucous neighbor to the north . In the past , when &quot; we ' re not L.A &quot; was a guiding principle of Orange County life , the airport initiative would have been defeated . But it passed last week because Orange County is now a diverse , high-tech manufacturing economy with growing trade connections to Asia and Latin_America . The words we ' re not L.A. have a different meaning . &quot; We need the airport to support our economic structure , in which job growth is more dependent_on exports than is the case in Los Angeles &quot; says James Doti , president of Chapman University in Orange . For the record , Los Angeles County gets 22 % of its $ 244 billion economic output from exports , compared to Orange County ' s 12.5 % of its $ 66-billion gross county product . But Los Angeles ' big economy is more diverse while Orange County at this stage is more like a Silicon Canyon , with business concentrated in computers and machinery , microchips and software and medical and scientific_instruments -- all_of them benefiting from foreign markets and foreign investments . So the voters decided to back the airport . And on Tuesday , Orange County ' s Board of Supervisors voted to disband the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority , which the supervisors had set_up to consider alternative uses for the military base . A new panel will be formed , not to consider alternatives but to plan for an airport on the 2 # 000 acres of Defense_Department land that has served as a Marine airfield for 51 years . Suburb no more . The decision marks a dividing line in Orange County ' s history , comparable_to the 1988 defeat of a slow-growth initiative . No longer a bedroom suburb of Los Angeles , Orange County -- population 2.6 million -- must be recognized once and for all as a decentralized industrial-residential community . It ' s a new kind of city , comparable_to Fairfax County , Va. , outside Washington or Gwinnett County , Ga. , near Atlanta . These are fast-growing centers of knowledge industry , adjacent to large cities but independent of them . Orange County , in fact , has been a model of the breed as it has developed multiple centers , from the older Anaheim and Santa Ana to Costa Mesa ' s South Coast Plaza complex to the Irvine Spectrum . &quot; The county has expanding industry and trade , a research university and good living accommodations . All it lacks is an international airport , &quot; says Dennis Aigner , dean of UC Irvine ' s graduate_school of management . The decision to build a major airport in addition to John Wayne Airport , which operates near capacity now and cannot be expanded , will shape the future of Southern California . For one thing , Orange County now sends 6 million passengers a year , plus considerable cargo , through Los Angeles International and another million passengers and cargo through Ontario and Long_Beach airports . One consequence of building a major airport at El Toro , near the Sand Canyon Road exit off Interstate 5 , will be to discourage plans for a giant international airport in Palmdale . Southern California will not go the way of Denver , attempting to funnel long-distance passengers through a mega-airport far from city_centers . Rather , the Southland will be served by a number of airports , led by LAX -- which can handle 55 million passengers -- and including the converted George Air_Force Base near Victorville , Norton Air_Base in San Bernardino and March Field near Riverside . In turn , this siting of airports near residential communities will push development of noise abatement and lower-emission engines . Business in the region will continue to be decentralized ; Orange County will compete for jobs and investment as the promise of El Toro nears reality . &quot; we ' ll show we ' re not just a gas_station on the way from San Diego to L.A. , &quot; says Supervisor Harriett Wieder . Indeed , some business people speculate that with high-speed rail links , El Toro could handle airline passengers for San Diego County . If all goes well , El Toro could be used for commercial cargo in 1999 , with passenger facilities to follow by 2005 . But that ' s a big if . Aside from inevitable wrangles about noise restrictions , new roads and infrastructure , El Toro -- like all military bases -- is an environmental nightmare with decades of fuel and toxic chemicals in the soil . The Defense_Department is responsible_for cleanup , which environmental experts say will cost more_than $ 1 billion . But the Pentagon only has to bring the property up_to standards &quot; for similar use. &quot; The air_base can become an airport , in other words , but the costs of converting the property to commercial office space -- not to mention residential developments -- would have been prohibitive . The airport itself will be financed by bond issues , but an Orange County builder , who opposed the ballot measure , wants to make_sure &quot; that the airport builders pay_for all_the roads and sewage and other public facilities surrounding the airport . Don ' t leave that bill to other developers or taxpayers. &quot; Growth and prosperity are not trouble-free , in short . But we should not forget that Orange County ' s new problems and many of those throughout Southern California -- Los Angeles ' exports are projected to grow 16 % to $ 63 billion next year -- are side_effects of opportunity . Orange County voters understood that last week . Perhaps they always have .
