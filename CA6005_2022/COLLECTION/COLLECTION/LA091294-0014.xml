   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : GIVING_BACK ; ' WE VIETNAMESE CAN FINALLY HEAL IF WE WANT TO '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the past few months I have been attacked many times in the Vietnamese-language press of Orange County and around the United States , and also in large demonstrations ( against improved ties between the United States and Vietnam ) What shocks me is that after all we Vietnamese have been through , including fighting and killing each other during our civil_war , there is still so_much anger and resistance among Vietnamese living in the United States . Many of the Vietnamese who attack me , including some former officers of the South Vietnamese Army , came from well-off educated families and lost everything to the communists . Some were put_in re-education camps and suffered a lot from the communists . Yet these same Vietnamese cannot seem to understand the lives of people born less fortunate . They insist that the only reason anyone helps the people of Vietnam is to help the communists . My generation growing_up in the Vietnamese countryside never had a chance to get education or training . I finished fifth grade , the highest grade then offered . Country women uneducated as I was had only one way to support themselves and their families -- prostitution . I have already told that about myself , so what is the point of the Vietnamese who were educated and wealthy bringing this up ( against me ) ? I travel_to Vietnam for my work with East Meets West , and I know that the children there are still not getting any education . In my home of Da Nang , less than one in five children finish the fifth grade . Only one in 15 graduate from high_school . I want this younger Vietnamese generation to be smarter than the uneducated farm_girl I was . Now , 20 years after the war , the toxic chemicals like Agent_Orange and the thousands of still-unexploded land_mines that people keep accidentally setting_off while plowing and so forth continue to cause birth_defects and injuries and deaths . The small , bare clinic that East Meets West has established does_good work , but it is a tiny drop_in a huge bucket . The younger Vietnamese in this country are very good . They want to understand the present reality and to help when they can . Many Southern Californians and other Americans , including veterans , are helping East Meets West . And some South Vietnamese who used to be protesters have been back to visit Vietnam since 1990 . They saw the terrible situation there , and had to ask themselves : &quot; How can I turn my back when so many are suffering ? &quot; I was happy to learn about the delegation including Vietnamese immigrants from Orange County that will soon go_to Vietnam to discuss business ties . I hope when they return they will openly discuss what they have seen and the situation of the Vietnamese people . I cannot expect everybody to like me or my books . But there ' s no need to divide , no need for this hatred . Everybody , especially every Vietnamese , has a story to tell , a scar on his or her life . If we Vietnamese want to go_on with our lives and finally heal in this peaceful country of the United States , we can do_it .</TEXT>
