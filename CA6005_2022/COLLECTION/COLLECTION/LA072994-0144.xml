   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; DANGEROUS ROMANCE BLOOMS IN ' STUDENT '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Foreign Student &quot; has such a good , offbeat premise and such winning performances from Marco Hofschneider and Robin Givens , it ' s a shame that it ' s only so-so when it could have been terrific . Hofschneider was the charismatic young star of &quot; Europa , Europa , &quot; in which he played a Polish Jew who winds_up in the German army during World_War_II . Here he plays Philippe , an 18-year-old Frenchman who wins a one-semester scholarship to a Virginia university . Hofschneider captures perfectly the culture shock experienced by the young_man upon his arrival in a small college community in the beautiful Shenandoah Valley . Not long after his arrival he encounters Givens ' April , a schoolteacher who also works as a cleaning woman for one of Philippe ' s professors . Their mutual attraction is instant , and why not ? Both are exceptionally attractive and bright individuals . But it ' s 1956 , the South , and the very notion of an interracial romance is fraught with peril . Still , Philippe is the only white_man who has ever looked April straight in the eye , and April is not only beautiful but as lonely as Philippe -- it ' s not likely that April has any friends trying , as she is , to learn French via a correspondence_course . Adapted by Menno Meyjes ( who also wrote the script for &quot; The Color Purple &quot; ) from Philippe Labro ' s autobiographical novel , the film is best and strongest when it sticks_to Philippe and April , whose romance develops with credibility and tenderness . From his sophisticated world of Paris , Philippe is baffled by naked racism and segregation while April is at once intrigued and wary of this very different kind of white_man . Director Eva Sereny does capture the aura of danger confronting the couple -- anyone who attended a college within a stone ' s throw of the Mason-Dixon Line in the ' 50s could tell you how daring and risky their affair is . When the film moves away from the lovers by themselves , &quot; Foreign Student &quot; becomes decidedly uneven . Rick Johnson is outstanding as Philippe ' s pal , a guy who fits the Golden Boy football star image but is actually a sensitive , caring and courageous individual behind his breezy jock demeanor . There ' s also a lovely cameo by Charles Dutton as a blues singer who comes_to Philippe ' s rescue when the youth dares to go_to a blues joint in a black neighborhood , a venue decidedly off-limits to white college_boys , and a brief , effective appearance by jazz vocalist Jon Hendricks as April ' s father . But Edward Herrmann , so often a fine actor , emerges as a caricature of the tweedy , pipe-smoking professor , and Charlotte Ross , a game young actress , is stuck_with what may well be the worst role of 1994 : a Bostonian who passes herself off as a Southern belle and then suffers a nervous_breakdown when she discovers Philippe has a &quot; black mistress. &quot; ( None of this curious behavior is explored. ) In her feature debut , Sereny , a Hungarian-born Englishwoman , displays more sincerity than style , and she has a hard_time imposing any kind of firm shape or form upon her material . Not helping matters are the film ' s syrupy score , banal theme_song and unctuous soundtrack narration . * MPAA rating : R , for language and some sexuality .
