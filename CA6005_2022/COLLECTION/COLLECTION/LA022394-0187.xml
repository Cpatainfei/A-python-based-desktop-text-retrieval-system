   <HEADLINE> GREENSPAN SAYS FED MAY RAISE INTEREST_RATES AGAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal_Reserve_Board Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Tuesday that the nation ' s central_bank could raise interest_rates again soon to keep a lid on inflation , prompting new concerns in Congress . In his semiannual report to Congress , Greenspan said that the nation ' s recovery is beginning to roll in most parts of the country and that the Federal_Reserve stands ready to take tough preemptive action to keep inflationary pressures from building and the economy from overheating . He called raising interest_rates a form of &quot; low-cost insurance &quot; against future inflation . Separately , Administration officials said they expect to announce soon that White_House economic adviser Alan Blinder would be named vice_chairman of the Federal_Reserve , making him what an Administration official called a &quot; leading candidate &quot; to succeed Greenspan when his second term expires in 1996 . Greenspan is a lifelong Republican who was first appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 and then reappointed by President George_Bush . As vice_chairman , Blinder would succeed David Mullins , who was appointed by Bush in 1990 and resigned effective Feb . 14 . Greenspan told a House Banking , Finance and Urban Affairs subcommittee Tuesday that &quot; if the Federal_Reserve is to promote long-term growth , we must contribute , as best we can , to keeping inflation pressures contained. &quot; Greenspan said that &quot; to promote sustainable growth . . . real short-term rates are more likely to have to rise than fall from here . I cannot , however , tell you at this time when any such rise would occur. &quot; In the arcane world of monetary policy , such comments amount to a thinly veiled threat that the Federal_Reserve is ready to raise rates again at any time to head_off rising prices . In fact , most economists expect the Fed to raise rates two or three times , leaving them by the end of 1994 as much as 1 full percentage_point higher than they were at the close of 1993 . The reaction in Washington was subdued . Unlike the Bush_Administration , the Clinton White_House in recent weeks has sought to avoid any public confrontations with the Federal_Reserve over economic_policy , and officials played_down the significance of the central_bank ' s decision to raise rates earlier this month . Still , the White_House repeatedly has pointed to the decline in interest_rates over the last year as the most important effect of the Clinton deficit-reduction plan . Aggressive Federal_Reserve action to move rates back_up will clearly increase tensions between the Administration and the central_bank , which continues to be dominated by Republican appointees . President Clinton told reporters Tuesday that &quot; there is no reason to believe there is an inflation problem. &quot; He said long-term interest_rates , which rise with investors ' expectations of inflation , could be &quot; considerably lower than they are &quot; -- about 6.5 % for U.S._government bonds that mature in 10 years or more . Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said the Administration likes interest_rates where they are . &quot; The continuation of low interest_rates has ( helped ) get the economy going again , &quot; Myers told reporters . &quot; We hope that long-term interest_rates stay low. &quot; In Congress , Greenspan met more direct complaints . Rep . Paul E . Kanjorski ( D-Pa. ) , chairman of the banking subcommittee , made_it clear that he did not want the central_bank to decide unilaterally to slow the economy even before it has a chance to gather momentum . &quot; Like many Americans , I am concerned that the Federal_Reserve ' s action may impede or even end our slow economic recovery , &quot; he told Greenspan . &quot; It seems to me you almost have a phobia when it comes_to inflation , &quot; Rep . Toby Roth ( R-Wis. ) said . &quot; Do you see the Fed focusing maybe too_much on inflation and to the detriment of an expanding economy ? &quot; But Greenspan said that &quot; the most virulent element to create economic distress and unemployment is inflationary pressures which have been allowed to get_out of hand. &quot; Greenspan ' s warning follows the Federal_Reserve ' s decision earlier this month to raise its benchmark federal funds rate , which banks pay on overnight loans from other banks , for the first time in five years . That rate hike , to 3.25 % from 3 % , sparked a 96-point selloff in the stock_market . Tuesday ' s comments by Greenspan had the opposite effect . Stocks and bonds finished higher after Greenspan ' s reassurance that the Fed is adopting a consistent stance and would take a get-tough approach to inflation . The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 24 points . The growing concern in Washington about interest_rates comes as congressional Democrats are pressing the Fed to open its closed-door deliberations to the public and to submit to greater oversight from the White_House and Congress . Greenspan has been caught for months in a running battle with House Banking Chairman Henry B . Gonzalez ( D-Tex. ) over whether the Fed should release transcripts of closed-door Fed meetings about monetary policy . Gonzalez is also pushing legislation that would require the 12 presidents of the Federal_Reserve ' s regional banks to be nominated by the President , thus increasing White_House influence over decision-making at the central_bank . The President now appoints the members of the Fed ' s board of governors , but the regional bank presidents , who have a strong voice in interest_rate policy , are named by the board of directors of their banks with the approval of the Fed ' s board of governors . Greenspan is also at_odds with the Administration over its proposal to consolidate banking regulatory_authority into one new agency , stripping the central_bank of its regulatory powers . Greenspan has said he believes that would permanently weaken the Fed ' s ability to monitor and influence the direction of the nation ' s financial system . Meanwhile , the central_bank ' s seven-member board of governors has a second vacancy . The Administration wanted to nominate George Perry , an economist at the Brookings Institution , a Washington policy research organization . But Perry apparently withdrew his name from consideration . He was interested in the board seat only if it might lead to the vice chairmanship , Administration officials said . They added that they planned to seek a woman or minority for the second vacancy to balance the appointment of Blinder , a white male . Perry could not be reached for comment . Blinder , 48 , is a former Princeton_University economist who served as an economic adviser to the Clinton presidential campaign in 1992 . He could not be reached for comment .</TEXT>
