   <HEADLINE> WINTER_OLYMPICS / NOTEBOOK ; NO ONE ' S STOPPING NORWAY ' S ULVANG FROM CRITICIZING THE IOC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The hot rumor Wednesday , entirely unsubstantiated , was that Vegard Ulvang , Norwegian cross-country_skiing hero , would not be allowed to recite the Olympic oath , as scheduled , on behalf of all_the athletes at Saturday ' s opening ceremony . Ulvang has frequently been critical of the International Olympic Committee and its president , Juan Antonio Samaranch , and repeated those criticisms Tuesday on Norwegian television . Ulvang said that Samaranch , a former minister in Spain ' s Franco regime , which he described as fascist , was hardly_a worthy representative of international sport . He also said democracy was lacking in the IOC . Despite the rumors , reaction was bland . Sandy Napier , spokesman for the IOC , said Ulvang ' s comments showed he had little knowledge of Samaranch or the IOC and that the organization was far more democratic than it was a decade ago . &quot; Ulvang is most welcome at IOC or the IOC Athletes ' Commission to meet and talk_about this , &quot; Napier said . The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee said Ulvang was free to voice his opinions and that his statements were not a problem . * Figure skater Nancy Kerrigan , who had not planned to march in the opening ceremony , apparently has changed her mind . Marit Rasmussen , the LOOC ' s figure_skating consultant in nearby Hamar , said Kerrigan would attend the opening ceremony and was a potential flag bearer for the U.S. team . MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
