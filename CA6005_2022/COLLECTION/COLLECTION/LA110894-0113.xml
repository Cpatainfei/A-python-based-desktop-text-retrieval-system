   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; A LIFE OF CONTROVERSY ; OPPONENT OF NAZIS , MCCARTHY AND EAST_GERMAN REGIME GETS READY TO SHAKE_UP THE GERMAN PARLIAMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At 81 , Stefan Heym has led a life of confrontation , with enough intellectual hairpin turns , moral standoffs and brushes with the law to be the stuff of an old-time picaresque novel -- and not a very believable one at that . In October , the onetime best-selling American novelist was elected to the German Bundestag , and as the oldest member will be the &quot; president by seniority , &quot; formally the most honored member of the lower house of Parliament and the one whose opening speech on Thursday will set the moral tone for the next four years of government . Yet Heym , a German-born Jew who fled the Nazis in 1933 , is a reluctant politician -- &quot; writers are always called_upon to support causes and to be the key figures that we do not want to be , &quot; he lamented in 1990 -- and indeed , a reluctant German , who confessed in his 1988 memoirs that after tasting the Nazi horror of the 1930s he never wanted to live_in his mother_country again . American book_lovers will remember Heym as the author of such erstwhile favorites as &quot; The Crusaders , &quot; a World_War_II novel that drew_on his experiences as a U.S. Army propagandist -- he waded onto the Normandy beaches with his typewriter in 1944 , a_few days after D-Day -- and that in its own time was likened to Norman Mailer ' s more enduring &quot; The Naked and the Dead. &quot; But by the early 1950s , Heym had renounced his place in the American book world , giving_up not only his U.S. audience but also his U.S. citizenship , and making a new home for himself in the intellectually stifling climate of the German Democratic Republic . His defection ought to have been a major propaganda coup for East_Germany , but instead of cultivating him , the Communist regime banned all but two of his books , recruited his own cleaning_woman to spy on him , froze his bank_account , kicked him out of the perk-dispensing East_German Writers ' Union and eventually , in response to his attempts to publish in West Germany , wrote a special paragraph that placed his activities into its penal_code . The laughably open-ended &quot; Lex Heym &quot; made_it a crime to communicate abroad any information damaging to East_Germany , punishable by up_to five years ' imprisonment . And yet the more the state harassed Heym , the more committed a socialist he declared himself to be . He remained convinced that East_Germany could somehow be reformed , and he chose to stay there even when opportunities to flee West presented themselves . This fall , in his latest caper , Heym ran_for Parliament on the ticket of the reconstituted East_German Communist_Party -- the successor to the very outfit that once banned his books and spied on him and is now reorganized and renamed the Party of Democratic Socialism ( PDS ) . All of which could make_for fireworks Thursday when he opens the new parliamentary session . Many Germans believe that the hard-line left died a richly deserved death in 1989 , when the Berlin Wall fell , and are appalled that a socialist fossil like Heym should turn_up in the Bundestag at all -- let alone have the top opening-day honors and national platform that he will enjoy . There have been rumors here that some parliamentarians , mainstreamers who have heckled the PDS mercilessly since its founding in 1990 , will either walk_out when Heym opens his mouth , ignore him or shout him down . &quot; I will speak_to my colleagues in Parliament in a way that makes them feel that I am someone who wants to cooperate with them , &quot; Heym said reassuringly , adding mischievously that he intends to invoke the spirit of Clara Zetkin , a leading Weimar-era Communist , in his remarks . Zetkin , who at 85 was the Parliament ' s &quot; president by seniority &quot; in 1932 , gave a firebrand Opening Day speech that called_for the creation of a Soviet Germany and rattled her fellow deputies so badly that they turned_around and elected the rising Nazi Hermann Goering their parliamentary president in the very same session . Such sheer cussedness turns_off many Germans . &quot; Never has so_much been said and written_about a political aspirant who has so little to contribute , &quot; complained the German writer and essayist Henryk Broder , who liked Heym better when he was picking fights with the East_German dictatorship . Yet Heym ' s uncompromising spirit has impressed many in his East Berlin constituency -- the economically poor but culturally rich Prenzlauerberg and Mitte districts . People there , mindful of the high unemployment and relatively low wages in their side of the country , have been deeply disappointed until now with the way German unification has turned_out . They believe that , second-class citizens in their own country , they need a tough representative in the Bundestag to fight for the interests of the former East . And over his 81 years , Heym has shown that he is nothing if not a fighter . Born Helmut Flieg in the eastern German town of Chemnitz in 1913 , Heym ran_afoul of the Nazis at 18 , when he published a poem scorning Germany ' s decision to send advisers to the Kuomintang army in China . He was kicked_out of school and blacklisted , and eventually went_into exile when the Nazis -- who wanted to arrest him -- couldn ' t find him and took his father hostage instead . He fled to Prague , sending home an all ' s-well cable signed with what would become his nom_de_plume , Stefan Heym . Later , he moved to the United States , took a job in a print_shop and set to work writing his first novel in English , &quot; Hostages. &quot; The book , a psychological murder mystery set_in Nazi-occupied Prague , brought Heym instant celebrity . Paramount bought the rights and made &quot; Hostages &quot; into a motion_picture . But then the Army drafted Heym and sent him back to Europe , putting him to work writing propaganda leaflets and radio scripts calling_on German soldiers to desert . One of Heym ' s leaflets is , in fact , credited with bringing_about the fall of a well-equipped German garrison on an island off Normandy . Heym said that when his homeland was liberated he felt a tremendous surge of hope for the world -- but his next novel , the best-seller &quot; The Crusaders , &quot; suggests that his hopes soon turned_to bitterness . Set_in wartime Europe , &quot; The Crusaders &quot; depicts not only the evils of National_Socialism but also the corruption and pettiness within the U.S. military and even the decay of America ' s founding , democratic ideals . Heym ' s disappointment with America grew during the McCarthy years , when he began to fear that the anti-democratic tendencies he had witnessed in Germany in the early 1930s were building in the United States . His wife was a member of the U.S. Communist_Party . He himself had recently written a novel favoring the 1948 ascent of communism in Czechoslovakia . He figured that it was only a matter of time before he was publicly vilified , so he left America in 1951 . He did not choose to go_to East_Germany , but bounced visa-less and homeless around Europe until finally the German Democratic Republic agreed to let him in . But he almost immediately wore_out his welcome , writing novels -- banned in the East but acclaimed in the West -- on such themes as freedom , truth and the clash between power and individual integrity . By November , 1989 , when more_than half a_million East_Germans took_to the streets of East Berlin to demand reform , Heym had become one of his country ' s most respected dissidents . &quot; Friends ! Fellow citizens ! Take_charge ! &quot; he told a cheering East Berlin crowd just days before the Berlin Wall was opened , urging listeners to achieve &quot; socialism , not the Stalinist type , but the authentic type that we want to build at last. &quot; But by the middle of the following year , most East_Germans had made_it eminently clear that what they really wanted was not so_much as_to build authentic socialism as_to go shopping with their new hard currency in the well-stocked West German department_stores . For a time , it seemed as if the aging perennial survivor had suffered one disappointment too many . &quot; With the Great Change , Heym lost not only his privileges , but also the very ground underneath his feet , &quot; Broder said . &quot; Visitors who strayed to his house in ( the eastern Berlin district of ) Gruenau told of seeing a tired , old_man suffering from a sense of meaninglessness. &quot; But then came the PDS offer that he run_for the Bundestag . Heym ' s critics said he went_into parliamentary politics at 81 not because he has anything useful to offer , but mainly to amuse . Indeed , Heym hasn ' t joined the party that helped him to his electoral victory , and has had little to say so far about what exactly he hopes to accomplish in the Bundestag . &quot; Why must a person always have programs ? &quot; he asked . &quot; Why can ' t I just take things as they come , and make decisions based on my long experience as a writer and a political person ? &quot; Why must I decide beforehand what I think_about this and that ? I cannot , and I will not do that . It would be so boring . You can expect surprises from me. &quot; Times researcher Reane Oppl in Bonn contributed to this article .
