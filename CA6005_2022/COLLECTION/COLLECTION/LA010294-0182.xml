   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CLINTON CABINET : MORE STUMBLES THAN SUCCESSES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ending a briefing in the wood-paneled solemnity of her conference_room , Atty . Gen . Janet Reno read a quotation from Abraham_Lincoln : &quot; If I were to read everything bad everyone said about me , I might as well close_up shop. &quot; Eight months ago , such displays of candor and probity were lifting Reno to unexpected stardom in President Clinton ' s Cabinet . Now , although still popular , she is also fighting a rear-guard action against critics in Washington who question her leadership and loyalty to the President ' s agenda . Reno has company in adversity . Blessed with talent and equipped with gold-plated resumes , many of the members of the Clinton Cabinet nonetheless have failed to meet the expectations that had been set for the first_team of Democrats to move_into Washington ' s top jobs in 16 years . In their debut year , some members of the Cabinet have proved successful , rising in stature and influence . Many others , however , have tripped and stumbled in the performance of what is admittedly a difficult assignment : helping to shape new national agendas at a time of skimpy resources , shielding their President from embarrassment or unwanted controversy and helping sell Administration policies to the public . Underlying all this is a political reality that Cabinet members of all administrations , and particularly this one , must eventually face : the real star of the show is the President himself . In Clinton ' s case , it was probably inevitable that the White_House would reserve for itself key decisions on such major issues as health_care , economic_policy , trade and welfare reform . Cabinet members form a supporting cast whose role is to stay just out of the limelight , not to share it . And , to switch metaphors , they must serve as the President ' s downfield blockers , shielding him from political attack and , at all cost , never ever getting_in his way . It was the failure to master this difficult ground that last month opened the trapdoor beneath Defense_Secretary Les Aspin . If Aspin was the first to exit , plenty of his colleagues are in difficulty : Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , unable to formulate a crisp and coherent post-Cold War policy for a President who is preoccupied with domestic problems ; Reno , too independent of the White_House and , worse , too popular in her own_right ; Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , out of step with the younger generation in the White_House ; Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown , under scrutiny for his dealings with a Vietnamese businessman . Some argue that the Cabinet stars who have_the_best chance of distinguishing themselves are those whose orbits are furthest from Clinton ' s sun -- those whose goals are not so dear to his heart that they invite his constant attention . Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt is one ; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G . Cisneros may be another . Even some White_House aides , asked to pick the Cabinet ' s stand-out performers , name second-tier deputies before those at the traditional core agencies of Treasury , State , Defense and Justice . Some Cabinet secretaries have labored under the additional handicap of functioning with many senior appointed positions unfilled . The Defense , Justice and Commerce_departments are the hardest hit -- only 10 of Commerce ' s top 28 jobs are filled , for example -- and nearly half of appointed positions are still vacant overall . The secretaries have also run_into competition from some who are not legally Cabinet members , though deemed by Clinton to be of Cabinet rank . Leon E . Panetta , the director of the Office of Management and Budget who was in the doghouse last spring for a burst of candor on the Administration ' s setbacks , has consolidated power as genial chief wielder of the budget cleaver . Another Californian , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor , has distinguished himself fighting for the twin international trade treaties that have unexpectedly ranked high among Clinton ' s first-year accomplishments . A closer look shows the progress and frustrations of the Cabinet ' s first year . Treasury : Bentsen Works to Increase Visibility Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen . &quot; I ' ve been part of the action , &quot; the former senator asserts these days , but the words may only underscore his failure to become the foremost voice on economic_policy . This traditional role of the Treasury_secretary has quietly migrated to Robert E . Rubin , head of the National Economic Council , the coordinating apparatus that operates under the White_House eaves . OMB ' s Panetta is more influential in some areas of economic_policy and Bentsen ' s second in command , Roger Altman , is personally closer to the boss . Bentsen ' s difficulty is partly style : the 72-year-old Texan has not taken_to the graduate-dorm style of policy-making that now dominates in the White_House . Notable by his absence from public events for several months , he dissented on some key decisions , including Vice_President Al Gore ' s broad-based energy tax . More recently he has been markedly unenthusiastic about financing plans for the health_care reform scheme . ( He couldn ' t bring himself to handle the lead-off congressional testimony for the plan , sending Altman instead. ) Still , Bentsen ' s influence was crucial in persuading Clinton to stick_with the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . And now the talk is of his efforts to increase his visibility , rather than retire with his memories to South Texas . State : Christopher Dogged by String of Bad Reviews Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher . Corporate lawyer and Clinton confidant , Christopher is so meticulous that he has been known to take pages of handwritten notes to cocktail_parties to ensure he would not lack for well-informed small_talk . But that preparation was not enough to enable Christopher to make silk purses of the President ' s intentions in Bosnia , Somalia and Haiti . Christopher ' s reviews hit bottom in May , when he swung through Europe asking the allies to back a plan to support the Bosnian Muslims . The Europeans snubbed the plan , and the sorry episode marked one of the few times since World_War_II that the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization allies have not gone_along with the United States on a matter of policy . Christopher has also seen a leaching of some of his powers . Amid grumbling about Christopher ' s communications skills , Gore has stepped into a more visible role as foreign_policy spokesman , while other officials are gaining influence on Russia , China and Japan . Christopher ' s apologists say , with some justice , that Daniel Webster himself would have stammered with the brief this secretary_of_state was handed . They say that much credit is owed him for holding together the Middle_East peace negotiations . Justice : Reno Charms Public , Pains White_House Atty . Gen . Janet Reno . The former Dade County , Fla. , prosecutor relieved Clinton ' s headache from the withdrawal of nominee Zoe Baird , but lately she has been causing the White_House shooting pains nearly as often as relieving them . After her public relations masterstroke of accepting responsibility for the muffed April assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Tex. , she drew criticism for weak efforts on behalf of the Administration ' s anti-crime bill , a top priority . Each month she demonstrated with ever more painful clarity her differences with the President ' s views on crime fighting , including his top campaign pledge of adding 100 # 000 more street cops and his support for mandatory minimum sentences . Even her administration of the department has brought criticism ; Webster Hubbell , the agency ' s No . 3 official , &quot; talks to the White_House a lot more_than she does , &quot; said one Clinton aide . An outside adviser calls the attorney_general &quot; a loser. &quot; The agency is still missing 14 top appointees , including senior officials for civil_rights and environmental enforcement . Reno has taken steps to increase sharply the flow of public information and begun overhauling the Justice_Department ' s internal investigation mechanism . With many Americans charmed by her classroom field trips and earnest talk_of fighting crime ' s root causes , her mail is still running three times as heavy as her predecessor ' s . Health : Shalala Getting Hang of It After Some Miscues Health and Human Service Secretary Donna Shalala . A leader of the Administration ' s liberal wing , Shalala advertises her independence from neo-Democratic dogma with the confidence born of her friendship with First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . &quot; I don ' t much like the term ' new Democrat , ' &quot; she said in a recent speech . But those ties have not always guaranteed her a seat at the banquet of power , nor has it fully cushioned her bumps after some embarrassing mistakes . What might have been her biggest role , as the voice of health_care reform , has been taken_over by the Clintons and their war-room general_staff . On welfare reform , the policy-drafting power seems to be flowing through her top aides but mostly around her . One top congressional aide compared her role to that of Secretary_of_State William P . Rogers while Henry A . Kissinger strode the diplomatic stage as President Richard Nixon ' s national security adviser . Former university president Shalala was given flunking grades by many for two congressional appearances where she appeared ill-prepared . She had the poor timing to float a value-added_tax proposal on April 15 ; later , she let slip that 40 % of Americans would pay more under the Clinton health_care reform , setting_off a convulsion of White_House clarifying and backpedaling . &quot; She was responsible_for a_few ( running ) news_stories we could have done without , &quot; said one White_House aide . But Shalala has also succeeded in selling a cost-reducing vaccination program , persuaded the White_House to spend more on a variety of health programs and apparently fought_off White_House efforts to fill her staff with appointees she called &quot; amateurs. &quot; Some say she is getting_the_hang of it . Labor : Most of Reich ' s Ideas on Hold_in First Year Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich . Some of his 1972 Yale law classmates thought the well-spoken Reich was more likely to be President than drawling Bill_Clinton , and Reich ' s abilities have served him well in changing the profile and agenda of his backwater agency . Still , the former Harvard_University professor ' s ideas have been largely delayed until the second year of the Administration . And he has caused consternation among Clinton ' s economic aides by espousing ideas that conflicted with other plans in the pipeline . Some aides blanched at his talk_of a fat payroll tax to finance worker training ; his call_for a higher , inflation-indexed minimum_wage stepped_on Administration claims that employer-paid health_insurance could substitute for such a hike . One outside Clinton adviser said that Reich ' s White_House ratings and access &quot; plummeted &quot; after his espousal of the failed economic stimulus program and plans that could be termed tax-and-spend orthodoxy . But some insiders insist that his light burns bright . Commerce : Allegation Has Cast Cloud Over Brown Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown . Promoted early as a star-to-be , lawyer-lobbyist Brown has already broadened the Commerce_Department ' s export promotion efforts and launched a domestic industrial policy program to foster technology industries . But Brown ' s progress was stopped_dead last fall by an allegation that he was paid by a Vietnamese businessman to lift the U.S. trade_embargo against Vietnam . Brown denies the charge , and little has been heard from a federal grand_jury in Miami in months . Although Brown continues to flash his unfailing smile , the White_House confessed its worries -- an unusual signal during a grand_jury investigation . The cloud forced Brown to take a lower profile on the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , lest he become a target for its foes . More recently he has engaged in a whirlwind of appearances , perhaps aimed at demonstrating that he lives . People who follow the Commerce_Department say its more severe problem is that only 10 of 28 top-level appointees have been confirmed . This , trade lawyers say , has confused outsiders and , by leaving policy-making in civil_servants ' hands , tilted policy in some areas in a protectionist direction . &quot; Call it ' uninventing government , ' &quot; said one trade expert . Interior : Babbitt Is a Winner Even Without Triumph Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt . The White_House considers the former Arizona governor a major public relations resource . Yet he has no clear-cut policy triumphs . On the Northwest logging dispute , Babbitt and the Administration reached a split-the-difference decision , but some environmentalists and the timber industry are already plotting new court challenges . On the feud over mining and grazing fees on public lands , Clinton shot down one Babbitt plan and Western lawmakers fought the second to a standstill in Congress . Babbitt is preparing a third and says , with understatement , that the battle &quot; has been a bit more complicated than we thought. &quot; Even if his solutions are messy , Babbitt can leave a permanent mark if he can demonstrate that environmental regulation does not have to be a dead-end of conflict and interminable litigation . Housing : White_House Is Sweet on Cisneros Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G . Cisneros . When a homeless woman died across the street from his office last month , the former San Antonio mayor spun it into a publicity blitz . Cisneros , long a media master , has also slept_in a New York homeless shelter and denounced racism in Vidor , Tex. , a city notorious for its segregationist attitudes . All this helped shame the White_House into giving him $ 823 million more to fight homelessness . But budgeters will cut other HUD programs and Cisneros has struggled with Congress . His agency , a swamp of corruption in recent years , still needs an overhaul . Still , the recognition is winning Cisneros important points with Democratic constituencies Clinton needs to keep happy as he presses a more centrist agenda . The housing secretary , who has had a cologne named after him , smells very sweet to the White_House just now . Veterans : So Far , So Good for Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown . If the Administration fails to ease strains with veterans , it won ' t be because Brown hasn ' t tried . A former employee of the Disabled American Veterans organization , he has hewed to the veterans groups ' party_line on just about every substantial issue , and they are pleased . But it remains to be seen how prominent he will be in health_care reform , and where his loyalties will lie if the Administration wants to cut the agency ' s spending . EPA : Browner Masters the Technical Points Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner . On her 38th birthday recently , Browner received a photo from Clinton of the two of them and other luminaries with a handwritten inscription . Here she was again , it said , explaining technical points to senior officialdom . Explaining , unfortunately , is about all this former Gore aide has done to date . She has been largely occupied with reorganization and housekeeping chores at a time of budget_cuts and growing workloads . But then , it ' s tough to stand_out when you ' re part of a swarm of environmental officials that also includes Babbitt and &quot; Big Green &quot; Gore himself . Transportation : Pena Allays Fears , but Record Is Thin Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena . Clinton made some aides very uneasy by choosing Pena , the largely untested former Denver mayor , in the final hours of his Cabinet selection process . Those fears have been allayed : &quot; He ' s not a disaster , &quot; said one outside adviser . Yet his record to date is thin : His plan to help the merchant_marine was torpedoed ; his attempt to unscramble the international airline landing-rights question is stalled ; and it was a White_House aide , not Pena , who ended the American Airlines flight_attendant strike just before the Thanksgiving rush . Education : Riley Leads Agency Into the Background Education_Secretary Richard W . Riley . Sincere and sophisticated , Riley has led a second-tier agency to near-invisibility . He reformed the college loan program and , with his Carolina-inflected Democratic rhetoric , brought smiles to the education Establishment . But the agency has been largely ignored by Riley ' s friend Clinton and by the outside world as well . Riley has surprised some observers by acquiescing in House Democrats ' efforts to water_down school performance standards . Agriculture : Espy Sets About Plowing a New Path Agriculture_Secretary Mike Espy . An early Clinton supporter , Espy has been praised for his efforts in Washington state ' s food contamination crisis and Midwest flood relief . He has shifted the agenda a bit , stressing rural development and nutrition programs over traditional farm programs . By contrast , he has been criticized for failing to fight behind the scenes for such causes as the increased food_stamp spending that Espy espouses . Energy : O ' Leary Takes On the Agency Itself Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary . The former utility executive got pummeled in early reviews for her weak grasp of the agency ' s work . But she lately has found a useful adversary : the 20 # 000-employee agency itself . O ' Leary has won wide notice for denouncing the department ' s Cold War-era secretiveness , including its concealment of plutonium experiments on humans . When Cable News Network ' s Larry King said in an interview that O ' Leary had been &quot; discovered , &quot; she replied : &quot; It ' s about time. &quot; Contributing to this report were Times staff writers Melissa Healy , Norman Kempster , David Lauter , Stanley Meisler , Ronald J . Ostrow , James Risen , Elizabeth Shogren and Karen Tumulty .</TEXT>
