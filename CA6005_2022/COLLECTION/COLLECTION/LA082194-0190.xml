   <TEXT> Chris Reece , a 52-year-old woman who contracted the AIDS virus after receiving a blood_transfusion in 1981 , is fighting for her life . So is her roommate -- Margaret , a 94-year-old preparing_for colon surgery . The two women live at Country Villa South , a pastel-shaded , 87-bed nursing_home in Palms . There , in a 30-bed special-care unit , the elderly and patients with AIDS coexist , side_by_side . An unusual mix ? Perhaps . But in many ways , Country Villa South might be considered the nursing_home of the future . Nationwide , experts say , there is a fast-escalating demand for the type of long-term care nursing_homes provide -- sub-acute services such_as skilled nursing , intravenous therapies and specialized drug treatments . Not only are more and more elderly people seeking such care -- the result of demographics and growing life_expectancy -- but so are the nation ' s burgeoning number of AIDS patients who , thanks to new drug therapies , are able to live longer with the disease . To complicate matters , the number of nursing_home beds has remained static since the 1980s , and home caretakers are in short supply . * The result , experts say , is that AIDS patients and the elderly will increasingly find themselves under the same nursing_home roof . &quot; It ' s time to look_at the mutualities of the chronically ill , rather than to continue to categorize people according to disease , &quot; said A.E. Benjamin , a UCLA associate_professor of social_welfare policy who is doing research on the subject for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation . &quot; There ' s no question that Country Villa South is part of the future. &quot; The trend is sure to cause tension . In fact , it already has : Activists and hospital-discharge planners in several states have claimed that nursing_homes have denied admission to AIDS patients . More_than 600 such complaints were filed with government_agencies from 1986 to 1991 , according to a report last year by the U.S. Inspector_General ' s Office . Small surprise , then , that Country Villa South is attracting attention from health experts as far away as China . Country Villa not only accepts AIDS patients -- one of three known to do so in Los Angeles County -- but it also integrates them with the elderly , creating a unique atmosphere in which the two groups share rooms and recreation . &quot; As far as I know , it is the only facility of its kind where the two populations are integrated , &quot; said Sharon Werbel , regional director of the 1 # 200-member California Assn . of Health_Facilities , a nursing_home association . Said Barbara Joseph , Country Villa ' s director of nursing : &quot; Country Villa is cutting edge. &quot; * Country Villa South , on Overland Avenue just south of the Santa Monica Freeway , is operated by the Country Villa Health Service Corp . The for-profit company owns 1 # 200 nursing-home beds in the Los Angeles area . It was company president Stephen Reisman who decided four years ago to open the sub-acute care unit for people with AIDS . But Reisman never intended for AIDS patients and the elderly to room together . The original concept was that there would be a separate wing . But there were not enough referrals of AIDS patients to sustain the unit , Reisman said , and there were numerous elderly patients who needed the skilled nursing_care . The decision was made to consolidate : Those who needed sub-acute care , AIDS sufferers and the elderly , would share the same staff and the same space . Currently , 23 of Country Villa South ' s 30 sub-acute unit beds are filled -- 16 with AIDS patients and seven with the elderly . Room and board is $ 250 a day , which might seem steep -- especially since it doesn ' t include medication and other ancillary services . ( For an AIDS patient , medicine costs an additional $ 1 # 500 to $ 8 # 000 per month. ) Still , it is only a fraction of the cost of a hospital stay . And Medicare and health_insurance coverage can be used for much of the cost . The unit is largely the responsibility of Michael Torgan , Reisman ' s cousin . Reisman made Torgan administrator of Country Villa in December , 1993 . Torgan , 30 , has a graduate degree in business administration and health-care management . He supervised another nursing_home before coming_to Country Villa , but admits : &quot; Nothing prepared me for this. &quot; Torgan had three challenges : turn a profit at Country Villa , maintain quality patient care and confront -- every day -- the fear of AIDS . The profits , Reisman says , have been slow to materialize . But the quality of care has been high , according to health officials and relatives of patients . And visits to the nursing_home suggest that patients have forged strong bonds , unfazed by the issue of AIDS . Consider Reece , who has been living with AIDS for 13 years . She clearly feels a connection to her roommate Margaret . &quot; If she makes a wrong move during the night , I call_out to her , ' Margaret , are you all_right ? ' &quot; said Reece , who is 52 . &quot; I want to know what ' s happening to her . We have our ups and downs , but I ' m just glad I ' ve got her. &quot; As for Margaret , she ' s nonplussed by the questions about rooming with an AIDS patient . Like many of the other elderly at Country Villa , she is so frail and faces so many physical complications that the issue of AIDS is not important to her . Said Bob Stelzer , a stroke survivor who has physical_therapy sessions with AIDS patients : &quot; Well , I don ' t really know who has AIDS . I ' m not sharing the same shaving utensils or anything like that . . . I feel safe. &quot; * Indeed , for patients_of all ages the chief concern is survival . At Country Villa ' s sub-acute care unit , the average stay is 18 days . Some patients go_home ; many die . Often , patients are so ill they can only lay_in their beds , unable to communicate . Ask the receptionist to speak_to a patient and the answer frequently is that so-and-so is sleeping . Or not lucid . Though AIDS patients and the elderly don ' t appear to mind being integrated at Country Villa , there have been signs of concern from relatives of the elderly patients . &quot; I remember one elderly man who was rooming with an AIDS patient who had absolutely no problem with the situation but was concerned that perhaps his grandchildren would n ' t visit him , and we moved him to another room , &quot; Torgan said . Gradually , the nursing_home has helped allay such fears . Barbara Joseph , who joined the staff as director of nursing a_few months after the unit opened early last year , drew from her experience as an AIDS unit nurse in Century City Hospital . She formed a team of four staff professionals to educate the elderly patients and their families about AIDS and combat the misconception that AIDS can be transmitted through casual contact . &quot; I say to these families I ' ve hugged people with AIDS , kissed them . They ' ve cried on me , sweated on me , died on me while I ' ve held them and I ' m still HIV negative , &quot; Joseph said . &quot; If I worried about getting AIDS from casual contact I couldn ' t work here. &quot; The message squares with that of health experts . &quot; There ' s no reason to isolate AIDS patients , &quot; said Richard Wolfe , regional supervisor of the health_facilities division of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services . According to Joseph , no one has removed a family member from Country Villa out of concern about its AIDS patients . But often , she says , fear of AIDS prompts families to decide against placing an elderly relative there . Crystal Morrow , a case coordinator at the nursing_home , remembers seeing the relative of a prospective patient pick_up one of the brochures that outlines Country Villa ' s services . After reading about long-term care_for AIDS patients , the relative hurried out of the building . Torgan says that , initially , some nursing_home staff_members feared taking_on AIDS patients . Once , he says , additional nursing assistance was needed immediately in the sub-acute care unit but none of the regular geriatric staffers wanted to help_out . He said he looked_into the problem and discovered that the employee in_charge of staff development has a phobia about AIDS . &quot; I fired her , &quot; he said . &quot; When you have your staff educator saying to staff , ' You don ' t want to work_up there , do you ? ' it doesn ' t help create a team. &quot; Torgan and his staff also had to adjust to the amount of care required by AIDS patients -- frequently far more , they say , than that of traditional geriatric patients . &quot; I tried to staff things traditionally at first . I would go_to Barbara Joseph and say we need to cut_back to this level and she would say we can ' t . And I would reconsider my decisions -- a lot , &quot; he said . * Despite all_the challenges , Torgan and his team appear to have created a nurturing environment under the most extreme circumstances . In the nursing_home ' s television and recreation_room one recent morning , the 8-year-old daughter of a staff_member daughter was bringing an AIDS patient a drink . A dog walked among the wheelchair-bound and licked a_few hands . Family members wiped the brows of their loved ones . In addition to interacting with the elderly in the sub-acute care unit , AIDS patients at Country Villa also mingle with the nursing_home ' s regular geriatric residents in common areas such_as the television_room and outdoor patio . On bad days , Torgan has plenty of letters to turn_to from appreciative family members . One , to members of the Country Villa staff , is from the family of Joey Fisher , who recently died of AIDS : &quot; You gave him medicines . You helped him to the bathroom , and , when his calls were too late , you helped clean him from top to bottom . You fed him . You changed his bedding . You showered him . ( Sometimes he showered you ! ) You rubbed cream into his dry skin and powered him , so he would n ' t get skin irritations . You put drops_in his eyes which he always tried to wipe_out again . You changed his IVs more times than any of us can remember . You dressed him for so many wonderful outings . You managed to deal with that damned bed that was always too soft to crawl out of or too hard to sleep on , and always too high for any of us to work around . &quot; You came_with compassion , understanding , concern and the genuine feeling of caring . You gave Joey dignity when there was little to be had . You gave him hope and confidence in his own abilities , even when those became limited . You let him wisecrack and be funny , and you were his best audience . You let him do what gave him the most pleasure -- act . And when his acting covered his real feelings , you pretended not to notice . &quot; If you wonder if you have made a difference , the answer is yes . You make the difference for patients between just surviving , and being able to live . For families the difference between hope and despair. &quot; How strong , ultimately , will the demand be for combined facilities like Country Villa ? That , experts say , depends in part on how much home-care service will be available in the future for the chronically ill . Home health_care is clearly the direction representatives of the leading AIDS and elderly support organizations favor . But experts agree that other options are needed , given the trends expected in long-term health_care . By the year 2030 , close to 25 % of the U.S. population will be 65 and older , compared to 12.5 % today . And the share of AIDS cases involving people over 50 -- currently 10 % -- is also expected to increase . &quot; We have a generation in their 40s , who were very sexually experimental , who took the least precautions , who are moving_into their 50s presenting problems our health_care system is not prepared_for , &quot; says Rita Strombeck , author of &quot; AIDS and Aging : What People Over 50 Need to Know. &quot; For his part , Torgan says Country Villa South has proven that nursing_homes can help handle the long-term care demands of diverse populations . &quot; I believe , without a doubt , we made_it work , &quot; he said . &quot; We provide an alternative which is cost-effective , serving all races , all genders , all ages and all ailments. &quot;</TEXT>
