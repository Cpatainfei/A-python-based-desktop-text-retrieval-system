   <HEADLINE> ZAPATISTAS CALL RULING PARTY VICTORY A ' LIE ' AND URGE PEACEFUL RESISTANCE ; MEXICO : IN FIRST STATEMENT SINCE VOTE , REBELS ASK FOR MASSIVE RALLIES . RESULT OF GOVERNOR ' S RACE IN VOLATILE CHIAPAS STATE STILL DISPUTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Mayan rebels whose revolt earlier this year plunged Mexico into unprecedented crisis on Friday blasted national elections and called_for civil_disobedience to &quot; repudiate the fraud. &quot; In its first statement since Sunday ' s vote , the Zapatista National Liberation Army said the ruling party ' s large margin of victory is a &quot; lie &quot; that &quot; only the gringos will swallow. &quot; The much-anticipated statement , signed by Subcommander Marcos , came as tensions in the southern state of Chiapas threaten to explode over what opposition forces claim was a rigged election that cheated their candidate out of the state governorship . &quot; The tactic ( of the government ) is to repeat the great lie until it becomes truth , &quot; Marcos said of the election results that give sweeping wins to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) . &quot; They are going_to be mistaken once again , and it will all come tumbling down on top of them as it did_in January. &quot; On New Year ' s Day , the Zapatista army launched a surprise rebellion that stunned Mexico and left 145 people dead in 12 days of fighting with the Mexican army until the federal_government ordered a cease-fire . The Zapatistas demanded democracy and human_rights for the hundreds of thousands of poor Indians who populate southern Mexico . Sunday ' s elections were seen here as a test of Mexico ' s commitment to democratic change . But numerous irregularities in the way the voting was conducted -- from alleged bribery and intimidation to the spoiling of ballots -- have left many in Chiapas angry and awaiting a signal from the Zapatistas . In two communiques released late Thursday and published Friday , the Zapatista army called_on Chiapans to &quot; defend their will &quot; and to turn_out for massive , peaceful demonstrations against the PRI . Rallies are to begin today here , as well as in Mexico_City . The opposition ' s bitter disappointment and frustration over the elections threaten to reignite the Chiapas conflict . Although most analysts do not believe that the Zapatistas have many military options at their disposal , the situation remains unsettled and volatile . The elections seem to have left Chiapas as divided and polarized as ever . Opposition forces , who share Zapatista demands , claim that the authentic election results , which they monitored , give a narrow win to Amado Avendano , their gubernatorial candidate . Avendano , publisher of a tiny local newspaper who survived a suspicious car wreck at the height of the campaign , claimed this week that he is the rightful governor-elect . In his first news_conference since the election , he told reporters Thursday night that he will fight the official results &quot; to the ultimate consequences. &quot; Meanwhile , in the Chiapas state_capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez , PRI candidate Eduardo Robledo made the same claim and began going_about the business of setting_up his new government . During the campaign , Robledo softened his rhetoric and assured voters he had &quot; learned the lessons &quot; of the Zapatista revolt . But for political victory , he had to rely_on the most conservative of the region ' s traditional power groups , such_as ranchers and old-style PRI militants , whom Zapatistas see as the root of Chiapas ' problems . On Friday , columnist Luis Hernandez Navarro described the situation in Chiapas as two locomotives speeding toward a collision . &quot; Holding elections for governor served more as an element of political decomposition than institutional stabilization , &quot; he said . &quot; The impending wreck of the two trains in Chiapas could have been avoided and it wasn ' t . . . . The war is there , latent . The wreck of the two trains will create the conditions for it to germinate. &quot; The official tally gives Robledo 50.4 % of the vote , with 34.9 % going_to Avendano , who ran_on the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) ticket . The Zapatistas said they intercepted radio communications between state election officials that proved Avendano won the race by a 2-to-1 margin . No proof of the claim was offered . Marcos also claimed that ballot_boxes were stuffed , Indians were pressured to vote for the ruling party -- sometimes by employers -- and votes for Avendano were intentionally voided by PRI poll workers . An independent watchdog group , the Civic Alliance , denounced more_than 300 irregularities in Chiapas , including vote buying , pressure and intimidation , names missing from registration lists and unauthorized people allowed to linger at voting_booths . The Civic Alliance said its own monitoring of a small sample of votes gave a narrow victory to Avendano . &quot; Personally , I believe there was fraud -- a more refined fraud -- but fraud , &quot; said Juan Jose Borrego , the Alliance ' s state coordinator .</TEXT>
