   <HEADLINE> STABLE DOLLAR BRACES STOCKS ; DOW UP 1.62</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The stock_market drifted higher in thin trading Monday . Some wary investors were encouraged by lower interest_rates , a steady dollar and good corporate earnings_reports . The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.62 points to 3 # 755.43. In the broader market , advancing issues outnumbered declining ones about 10 to 9 on the New York Stock_Exchange . Big Board volume came_to a light 227.46 million shares , down from the 275.86 million shares traded Friday . There was little news to guide investors , so they looked_to the bond market , said James Melcher , founder and president of Balestra Capital . &quot; It was a very slow day with little happening , &quot; he said . The lower bond rates boosted credit market_prices . The Treasury ' s bellwether 30-year bond yield dipped to 7.50 % from 7.54 % on Friday . That was good for stocks , because lower rates cut the cost of borrowing money and make share prices more appealing relative to interest-bearing investments . The dollar rose in New York to 98.35 Japanese yen , up from 97.85 yen on Friday . Against the German currency , the dollar closed at 1.547 marks , down from 1.554. The U.S. currency ' s performance was also encouraging , analysts said . The greenback has ridden a rocky road downward against some_other major currencies in recent weeks . The dollar ' s decline raised fears of inflation and thus higher interest_rates down the road as the cost of_imports rises . Its stable performance Monday meant investors didn ' t have to focus_on the direction of interest_rates . Profit news , meanwhile , drove the stocks of some companies . Midlantic rose 7 / 8 to 30 3 / 8 and Upjohn rose 1 / 2 to 30 5 / 8 on the NYSE . Both released reports of strong quarterly earnings . Don Hays , investment strategist at Wheat First-Butcher &amp; Singer , said that since Wednesday , when second-quarter corporate earnings_reports began in_earnest , 612 companies have weighed in . Of those , 72 % showed results better than those of last year ' s second quarter . Mostly , however , investors were cautious Monday , said Alfred Goldman , director of technical market analysis with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. Last week , the Dow average rose 44.67 points , and the Nasdaq composite index ended 13.90 points higher for the five trading days . &quot; A little rest is only natural , &quot; Goldman said . Melcher said many market players were reluctant to make significant moves before Federal_Reserve_Board Chairman Alan Greenspan gives his semiannual testimony on monetary policy and the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday . Stocks ended mostly higher abroad . Tokyo stocks closed lower in thin trading , with the Nikkei 225-share average falling 52.51 points to 20 # 717.64. In Europe , Frankfurt ' s DAX 30-share average closed 4.58 points higher at 2 # 098.19 ; London ' s Financial Times 100-share average finished at 3 # 082.0 , up 7.2 points .
