   <TEXT> Keith Braswell , a freshman guard at the University of Dayton , admires Muggsy Bogues of the Charlotte Hornets for good reason . Bogues is the shortest player in NBA history at 5 feet 3 . Braswell , however , literally looks_up_to Bogues . He stands only 4-11 1 / 2 and wears Size-4 1 / 2 shoes that must be bought_in the children ' s departments of stores . As a requirement of his work-study_program , Braswell spends eight hours a week doing cleanup work_at Founders Hall on campus . &quot; When he vacuums , he has to peek over the vacuum cleaner to see where he ' s going , &quot; a teammate said . Trivia time : Who holds the NFL record for most touchdowns rushing in a season ? Never too young : Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle on Venus Williams of Compton becoming a tennis_pro at 14 : &quot; Is 14 too early ? Who knows ? Genius has its own timetable . And bank book . &quot; Mozart was about 6 years old when he turned pro , went_on the European concert circuit , hustling his harpsichord hits. &quot; Campus humor : Larry Guest of the Orlando Sentinel writes that on the University of Florida campus they ' re asking : &quot; What ' s the difference between God and Steve Spurrier ? . &quot; Answer : God doesn ' t think he ' s Steve Spurrier. &quot; Why not ? Bernie Lincicome in the Chicago Tribune : &quot; Should a team on probation be allowed to be the national champion ? &quot; I look_at it this way . If Marion Barry can be mayor of Washington , then Auburn can be No . 1 in the country. &quot; Mat matters : Steve Jennings , a former punter with the New York Giants and Jets , is among alumni of St . Lawrence College in Canton , N.Y. , who intend to withhold donations to the school because it intends to drop wrestling to save money . Not heard from so far is the college ' s most famous wrestler , actor Kirk Douglas , who graduated in 1939 . Spooky night : Green_Bay quarterback Brett Favre , a Mississippi native , on the rain and high winds in Chicago during the Packers ' 33-6 victory over the Bears_on Monday night : &quot; It was like Hurricane Camille , only 80 degrees colder. &quot; Buddy bashing : Woody Woodburn in the Ventura Star-Free Press_on a trick-or-treater he would like to have seen on Halloween night : &quot; Buddy Ryan in a horse costume ( of course someone else will have to wear the front section and head ) . &quot; Waiting game : Curt Flood , talking_about the United Baseball_League in the New York Times : &quot; We need an alternative league . America deserves an alternative league . . . . I need an alternative league . Baseball owners have shut me out for 25 years. &quot; Trivia answer : John Riggins of the Washington Redskins with 24 in 1983 . Quotebook : Ed O ' Bradovich on Gale Sayers , his former teammate with the Chicago Bears : &quot; If there was one game , one play that had to be made , I ' d want ( Sayers ) to carry the ball . As fast as he was going_forward , he was that fast going sideways. &quot; MAL FLORENCE</TEXT>
