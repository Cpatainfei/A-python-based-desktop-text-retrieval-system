   <HEADLINE> GROWING INTO THE ROLE ; MOVIES : RALPH FIENNES GAINED WEIGHT -- AND CRITICAL PRAISE -- FOR HIS ROLE AS A BRUTAL NAZI WORK-CAMP COMMANDANT IN ' SCHINDLER ' S LIST. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ralph Fiennes had agreed to meet for morning coffee at the august Savoy Hotel , but when the appointed hour arrived , he was glowering in the foyer . He was dressed smartly in leather jacket , striped shirt and bolo_tie , but this ensemble did not please the Savoy ; its impenetrable dress codes dictated he must don a formal coat . We agreed to decamp to the more relaxed Waldorf , 200 yards down the street . &quot; The Savoy offered me one of their jackets , but I wasn ' t about to do that , &quot; muttered Fiennes as we strolled along the Strand . &quot; Honestly , this kind of thing just makes me want to pack up and move to the States. &quot; That would be music to Hollywood ' s ears . In the wake of his stunningly powerful performance as the brutal , sadistic Nazi work-camp commandant , Amon Goeth , in Steven Spielberg ' s &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; the_British Fiennes is a hot property . Best supporting actor awards from the National Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics ' Circle , and a Golden Globe nomination in the same category , have only intensified the heat . &quot; It was a remarkable experience working with Steven , &quot; says Fiennes , visibly relaxing after being ushered to a table at the Waldorf . &quot; I feel as though he ' s touched a tender human nerve in all_of us with this film. &quot; Fiennes also talks_of &quot; the huge bond of loyalty and friendship &quot; that now exists among Spielberg and his &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; stars ( Liam Neeson , Ben Kingsley and himself ) after the grueling five-month shoot in Poland . Fiennes ( whose name is pronounced Rafe Fines ) is a friendly , soft-spoken 30-year-old with impeccable manners , a shy smile , a slim frame and fair hair that flops boyishly over his forehead . It is almost impossible to square his demeanor with that of Amon Goeth , a man capable of randomly shooting Jewish prisoners with a rifle from the balcony of his villa overlooking the work_camp . As Goeth , Fiennes summoned up a look of chilling cruelty around his eyes ; he wore his hair slicked back and strutted around with a huge paunch . &quot; Steven didn ' t get involved in motivation or in my interpretation of Amon Goeth , &quot; recalls Fiennes . &quot; He wasn ' t dictatorial or autocratic . He trusted , and the trust built . But he did tell me not to make Goeth a cliched Nazi , and he thought I should certainly put_on weight. &quot; So Fiennes started eating three full meals a day before shooting began , washing_down dinner with a_few pints of Guinness . He accelerated the process by consuming a weight-enhancing substance made of vegetable fats and eventually gained 25 pounds , most noticeably around his stomach and jowls . * &quot; Everyone makes cracks about this being like De Niro putting_on the pounds for ' Raging Bull , ' but I think the decision was justified , &quot; Fiennes says . &quot; Goeth was a man with a sense of_his_own incredible power , the power to let people live or die . And powerful men often carry a paunch around with them in a way that demonstrates that power . It makes them more expansive , it creates extra space around them . There ' s something almost phallic about it. &quot; Fiennes may have seemed a left-field choice for such a rich role as Amon Goeth . Until now he has been_best known in Britain for stage work -- in a three-year stint at the Royal Shakespeare Company , he played Henry_VI and Triolus . He then played Lawrence of Arabia in a British TV film called &quot; A Dangerous Man &quot; and starred as Heathcliff in Paramount ' s ill-fated remake of &quot; Wuthering Heights , &quot; which was never released in America . &quot; I liked him as Lawrence , &quot; says Spielberg . &quot; He took a lot of chances , especially with Peter O ' Toole looming above the part like a guillotine . I asked to see a print of ' Wuthering Heights ' and thought it was a difficult part he pulled_off . &quot; Also , Ralph has a charm which can cut_off and become deadly calm . Goeth was such a nasty man , as evil as any of the icons of German Nazism -- and Ralph as Goeth looks you in the eye and makes your blood run cold. &quot; Fiennes believes Spielberg saw elements of Goeth in his portrayal of Heathcliff : &quot; I made him more vengeful and malevolent than he was in ( Emily Bronte ' s ) novel. &quot; The next time Fiennes is seen by film audiences , he won ' t be brutal or vengeful . Immediately after wrapping &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; in Poland , he flew to New York to play the celebrity 1950s TV quiz contestant Charles van Doren in Robert Redford ' s movie for Disney , &quot; Quiz Show. &quot; &quot; Charles van Doren was thin and angular , so of course I had to lose the 25 pounds immediately , &quot; he says ruefully . &quot; Redford got me a personal trainer. &quot; In addition to the two films he made last year , Fiennes also was married in 1993 , to British actress Alex Kingston . The future looks rather rosy too . &quot; I ' ve already read scripts which have ended_up going_to Tom Cruise and Daniel Day-Lewis . I can see the ingredients that go_into a star role . But one has to be really careful . Having just played two psychologically intriguing roles , I ' d like to follow them up with something that offers the same kind of challenge. &quot; Fiennes is still wrapped_up in &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; though . &quot; Working with Steven was so stimulating , &quot; he said . &quot; You felt you could take risks . I remember saying as much to Ben Kingsley one day after we ' d seen the dailies . Ben said , ' Yes , and just look_at where Steven ' s putting the camera . We ' re in good hands , you know.
