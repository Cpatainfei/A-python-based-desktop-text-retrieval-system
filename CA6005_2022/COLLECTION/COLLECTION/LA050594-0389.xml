   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : TEACHING TEEN-AGERS RISKS OF SEX</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At South Gate High , where an average of one girl each school_day reports a pregnancy , and losing one ' s virginity on prom night is not uncommon , student leaders decided that their peers needed a crash course on abstinence and safer_sex . The leadership group produced &quot; Face the Facts -- It Could Be You , &quot; an hourlong multimedia brushup on pregnancy , AIDS and other consequences that sexually active teens face , and presented it to 800 students two days before this year ' s prom . &quot; Everybody knows what goes_on that night , &quot; said Ezequiel Navarro , 18 . &quot; A lot of people think_about having fun but they see it in the wrong way. &quot; Hoping to reach teen-agers in a language they would listen to , &quot; Face the Facts &quot; featured a humorous but pointed theater presentation , rap_music and a clip from the film &quot; Philadelphia. &quot; Though the student audience hooted during the message-laden comedy sketch , many slouched in their seats and looked_away while a Planned Parenthood representative told them that getting pregnant would probably mean putting their dreams on hold . Nationwide , about 72 % of all high_school seniors have had sexual_intercourse , according to statistics from Planned Parenthood . In Los Angeles County , a teen-ager gives_birth every 7 1 / 2 minutes . South Gate High documented 121 pregnancies between July , 1993 , and April of this year , said school nurse Wilma Wilson . &quot; It ' s real shocking because we have the highest attendance rate in the district and the lowest dropout rate , &quot; said Cindy Rosales , 17 , senior_class vice_president . &quot; I have five friends here at school who are pregnant and one who had her baby yesterday. &quot; Audience members agreed that &quot; Face the Facts &quot; was an effective way to get the message across : There is no such thing as safe_sex . &quot; School classes on health and sex education don ' t get_it across as well , &quot; Navarro said . &quot; Nobody pays_attention because they ' re so boring . . . . Everybody feels it won ' t happen to them . ( This program ) makes you realize it can happen and you should be careful. &quot; MARY HELEN BERG</TEXT>
