   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; NOTEBOOK ; MUCH LIKE JANSEN , GERMAN CHAMPION SUCCUMBS WITH FALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It doesn ' t happen only to Dan Jansen . World champion Gunda Niemann of Germany skated_over a plastic lane marker in the women ' s 3 # 000-meter speedskating race Thursday at Hamar and fell , missing a chance to repeat as Olympic champion . America ' s Jansen , the top men ' s sprinter , fell twice in his specialties at Calgary in 1988 , then slipped again Monday in the men ' s 500 , which he might well have won otherwise . Instead , Russian Aleksandr Golubev finished first . Another Russian , Svetlana Bazhanova , took_advantage of Niemann ' s misfortune and won in 4 minutes 17.43 seconds , nearly seven seconds behind Niemann ' s world_record . Emese Hunyady of Austria was second and Claudia Pechstein , Niemann ' s teammate , third . &quot; I ' m in shock , &quot; Niemann said , crying . &quot; But in this sport this can happen any day . I ' m just happy to be alive . I ' m a good fighter and I ' ll try to overcome this. &quot; Her fall was nasty , taking_out Seiko Hashimoto of Japan , too , as Niemann slid across both the inside and outside lanes . Niemann got_up and finished the race , almost a minute off her record time , but was disqualified for being in the wrong lane . Hashimoto later was given a re-skate and finished sixth . German coaches protested the placement of the lane markers , but judges looked_at videotapes and rejected the protest . * Norwegian skier Bjorn Daehlie , who defeated Vladimir Smirnov of Kazakhstan in the men ' s 10-kilometer classical cross-country ski_race , later served cherry brandy to the Norwegian press , saying : &quot; It contains no Smirnov. &quot; Daehlie said the brandy was made from cherries picked by him and his father at his home_in Nannestead , Norway . &quot; It has been developed in various ways , and I do not recommend it to athletes , &quot; Daehlie said . Just shows what he thinks_of newspapermen . * Don ' t athletes want to have fun ? Off-hours activities in the Olympic villages have been canceled for lack of interest . &quot; It is a pity that the athletes aren ' t taking the chance to see more of the surrounding country , &quot; said Gerd-Helen Kvamme , marketing consultant for the company in_charge of the athletes ' activities . &quot; I believe their stay in Norway would leave a more lasting impression if they would only try a sleigh ride or a trip behind the dog sledge while they are here. &quot; * Lillehammer police are jailing Olympic tourists regularly -- giving them a place to spend the night . Officer Rigmor Saether said she did not want the police_station to become just another cheap hotel but added that those without lodging would not be turned_away , as long as there is room .
