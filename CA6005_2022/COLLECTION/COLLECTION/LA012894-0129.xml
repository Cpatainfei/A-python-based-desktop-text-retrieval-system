   <TEXT> The San Fernando Valley ' s education network took a double hit Thursday when Cal State Northridge said it plans to have all class and office work held_in portable buildings when the students return and Los Angeles Unified School District officials said a badly damaged and unstable elementary_school in Granada Hills might have to be abandoned . The news came_on the same day that a 4.5-magnitude aftershock centered two miles west of Granada Hills sent scores of students out of classrooms and reminded everyone in the Valley that it ' s too early to put the devastating Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake behind them . The 9:19 a.m. temblor rattled children and parents alike . Many schools got calls from parents checking to make_sure their children and the campuses were safe . Some parents returned to schools to retrieve their children . CSUN officials , saying they were weary of reinspecting each of the campus ' 58 buildings for safety after the aftershocks , announced that they plan to forgo use of all buildings and instead use portable trailers for classes and offices when the university reopens to about 22 # 000 students Feb . 14 . The elementary_school in peril is Van Gogh Street Elementary School in Granada Hills . School district officials were told Thursday that the ground beneath the campus is so unstable and crisscrossed by fissures that the site will probably have to be abandoned . The school has an enrollment of 370 . Officials said it might be the only campus that will have to be entirely shut_down because of earthquake damage . In all , the Jan . 17 quake caused $ 700 million in damage to campuses throughout the sprawling district . In related developments Thursday : * U . S . Secretary_of_Transportation Federico Pena released $ 50 million in emergency federal funds to assist in the demolition and reconstruction of damaged freeways . It was the largest allocation yet for transportation_systems crippled by the Jan . 17 earthquake . The money , combined with $ 45 million made available last week , is intended to help state officials continue their freeway rebuilding efforts while Congress mulls_over a $ 1.35-billion federal allocation for transportation . * State Controller Gray Davis issued $ 100 million in checks for government , transportation , educational and church agencies in Los Angeles County . Another cash infusion was announced by Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt , who said checks totaling $ 27.6 million have been disbursed for housing assistance . * Details began to emerge of the havoc created in the Valley court system by the Northridge earthquake . In San Fernando , judges were allowed back into their condemned courthouse to retrieve case files and computers . Most of the courtrooms will be moved by next week to the Van Nuys courthouse , itself damaged in the quake . Two floors there remained closed Thursday , with the other five open . The strong aftershock was the latest setback to CSUN officials , who are trying to reopen a campus that is located near the epicenter of last week ' s deadly 6.6-magnitude quake and suffered major damage . &quot; We have to plan on the basis of no building on the main campus being available , &quot; CSUN Provost Louanne Kennedy said . &quot; If they come_on line , then we ' ll use them , but we can ' t plan on that . Every time there is an aftershock , it changes the status of the buildings and then we have to start all_over again. &quot; Kennedy advised deans to plan spring and summer semester schedules around the use of about 190 trailers , each of which can hold about 25 people and which can be linked together to create larger spaces . Another 100 trailers will be used for faculty office space , with professors likely staggering office hours and sharing desks , she said . The trailers will be located on the school ' s athletic_fields . Other contingency plans include holding classes in meeting halls located near campus , borrowing laboratory space from private_corporations , instructing education students in local elementary_schools and shipping advanced science students to facilities at other area colleges and universities . Other likely adaptations include scheduling more classes during off-peak hours , especially Friday nights and Saturdays , Kennedy said . Meanwhile , L . A . Unified school_board members were presented with a bleak picture of Van Gogh school by Doug Brown , director of school facilities . A deep crack snakes its way through the main corridor , and several other fissures are visible throughout the wide open campus , he said . Several deep cracks have broken classroom and hallway floors . The campus has no water . An ominous sign greets visitors at the entrance of Van Gogh Street Elementary School : &quot; Parents : Please leave children outside. &quot; Principal Maureen Diekmann said she is considering relocating the students to Frost Middle_School in Granada Hills . At other schools , the day got_off to a harrowing start . Principal Sandra Coffey of Saticoy Elementary School in North Hollywood said several parents came_to pick_up their children after the morning aftershock , and many others called to ensure their children ' s safety . &quot; We ' re back to calming nerves again , &quot; Coffey said . At Osceola Elementary School in Sylmar , one teacher had her students bring their favorite stuffed animals to class Thursday . After the temblor , the students sat on the floor hugging their toys . There was some minor damage at local schools . Ceiling tiles shook lose and plaster chips fell . School district officials said there were no reports of injuries . District Supt . Sid Thompson announced the opening of 14 more San Fernando Valley campuses that have been closed since the 6.6 temblor nearly two weeks ago . Thirty-three schools , all_in the Valley , remain closed , meaning about 40 # 000 students have been out of school for two weeks . The most severely hit campuses -- two high_schools , Kennedy in Granada Hills and El Camino Real in Woodland Hills ; four middle_schools , Northridge , Lawrence , San Fernando and Frost ; and two elementary_schools , San Fernando and Van Gogh -- have been dubbed the &quot; Big Eight &quot; by school officials because of the severity of damage . &quot; I anticipate by Monday morning we can give definitive information on what happens at each of these schools , &quot; said Thompson . &quot; We realize you want your young people back . We will bring them back when it is safe. &quot; Options include installing portable classrooms in safe areas , finding alternative space in commercial and other buildings or transferring students . District officials also announced that every school in the district has been given $ 5 per student to spend on emergency quake-related counseling , health_care or the purchase of school supplies . Hard-hit campuses received $ 15 a student , aid provided by the U . S . Department_of_Education . Times staff writer Beth Shuster contributed to this story .</TEXT>
