   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / QUARTERFINALS ; PUTTING GAMES ON LINE ; PENALTY KICKS BETTER THAN COIN FLIPS , BUT BARELY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jorge Campos was a fallen figure in a sea of grass Tuesday evening at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford , N.J. His face was down , against the turf . His arms were flung out , legs bent at the knees . The Mexican goalkeeper was a heap of vivid color_in the middle of a giant stadium where moments earlier everything had gone so wrong for his teammates in a heart-stopping , second-round loss to Bulgaria . What could be done ? Mexico was eliminated from the World Cup in the most disheartening of manners . After 120 minutes had produced a 1-1 tie , Bulgaria won on penalty kicks , 3-1 . It is perhaps the cruelest way to settle a game since FIFA , soccer ' s governing body , did_it with coin flips . &quot; At least this way , everybody has a chance , &quot; said Joseph Blatter , FIFA general secretary . Since its adoption in 1970 , the round of penalty kicks has been debated and dissected , cursed by losers , praised by winners . Penalty kicks have made careers , and if not exactly ruined others , certainly left scars . Some have come_to terms with penalty kicks ; others reject the very idea . FIFA is expected to adopt sudden_death for the 30-minute overtime_period before the 1998 World Cup in France . But if neither teams scores , it will fall_back on the round of penalty kicks to determine the winner . &quot; It does not seem right to determine the game that way , &quot; said Wim Jonk , a Dutch midfielder , who could be called_upon to do just that in Saturday ' s quarterfinal game against Brazil at the Cotton Bowl . Carlos Alberto Parreira , Brazil ' s coach , disagreed . He said penalty kicks are the best method of doing_it . &quot; There is no other way , &quot; he said . &quot; If the players can ' t decide it after 120 minutes , FIFA has to drop one team . It ' s the only solution. &quot; For spectators , it is always high drama . Five kicks for each team , taken alternately , from 12 yards out against the goalkeepers . If that doesn ' t settle the_matter , they go_to sudden-death penalty kicks . A coin toss still is needed to determine which team kicks first . Soccer fans still talk_about how Argentina reached the 1990 final by defeating Yugoslavia in the quarterfinals and Italy in the semifinals on penalty kicks . What they mostly recall is the brilliance of backup goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea , who saved kicks_in each game . &quot; Some goalkeepers have better intuition than others , &quot; said Goycochea , who built his career on those games . &quot; I don ' t think saving penalties is just a matter of luck. &quot; In fact , the entire process has been turned_into a science . Like pitchers in baseball , goalkeepers keep detailed statistics of opponents ' shooting tendencies . In the brief moment before the ball comes flying at them , keepers must guess where it is going . Campos guessed right against the Bulgarians four times , but blocked only Krasimir Balakov ' s shot . Bulgarian keeper Borislav Mihaylov did not bother guessing . &quot; I just look_at the foot of the player who ' s going_to kick and try to move_in that direction , &quot; he said . Timo Liekoski , U.S. assistant coach , said the Americans wrote a detailed book on Brazil before their second-round game Monday in Palo Alto . The United States lost in regulation_time , 1-0 , and did not need it . But coaches try to learn as much as they can about opponents to prepare their keepers for the penalty-kick possibility . They also emphasize penalty shots once the World Cup becomes a single-elimination tournament , after the first round . Romania ' s players spent almost an hour practicing penalty kicks Thursday in the Bay Area . Brazil , practicing in stifling heat in North Dallas , did not . But Parreira has his own method of determining who is ready to take the pressure shots . &quot; We select the best shooters , those who are emotionally ready , &quot; he said . Coaches often make last-minute substitutions before the overtime ends to get a strong penalty kicker in the lineup . Only those on the field at the finish of overtime are eligible to shoot . Mexico ' s coach , Miguel Mejia Baron , was questioned for leaving Hugo Sanchez , 36 , on the bench at that critical moment . Most coaches say they want their most experienced players taking the penalty shots . &quot; The first shot is crucial , &quot; Liekoski said . &quot; I would not save my best kicker to the fifth because a lot of times it doesn ' t get_to the fifth guy , so you waste him . You also need a good kicker to go third. &quot; Most agree that when the match comes_down to penalty kicks , it becomes a game of nerves . Mexico seemed to lose its poise when it was most needed , missing its first three shots . The U.S. coaches look_for the players who want to take the shot in the make-or-break situation . &quot; It ' s not really a learned skill , &quot; Liekoski said . &quot; If you ' re afraid of it , it ' s not going_to work for you. &quot; By putting players in simulated situations , coaches try to determine which ones have steely wills . &quot; Who always picks his spot and doesn ' t change his mind , &quot; Liekoski said . Blatter said that from the moment FIFA adopted the penalty kick , proposals have been made_for changes . Most have been rejected . &quot; This solution is so far the best , unless something revolutionary comes_along , &quot; he said . Simply letting the match continue until one team scores could put fatigued players at risk of serious injury , some point_out . For those who endured the coin toss , the penalty kick seems like a nice option . Jan Van Beveren , a great Dutch goalkeeper of the 1970s , did not even want to think_about the coin toss . Now a stamp_dealer in Dallas , Van Beveren first encountered penalty kicks as a player in the North_American Soccer League . He had joined the team midway through the season and was not aware of the NASL shootout until his team made the playoffs . In his first playoff match , the game went_into the shootout . &quot; I went_to the sideline , and asked the coach , ' What is this all about ? ' &quot; Van Beveren recalled . Van Beveren said the only way to be a successful keeper is to have a feeling for where the kick is going . Like other keepers , he enjoyed the intense situation . &quot; For the keeper , everything is_on your shoulders but the pressure is not on you , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ve never seen a keeper get blamed for letting_in a goal . The one who misses the kicks is the goat. &quot; But that is not comforting to a goalkeeper who plays for the losing side . Campos , the flamboyant Mexican keeper , played admirably in the tense moments of Tuesday ' s match . But that was little consolation as he lay on the grass , considering what might have been . Bulgarians were running_across the field , celebrating their victory . When Campos finally stood , star forward Hristo Stoitchkov of Bulgaria put an arm around him , and they walked_off the field together . One a winner , the other a loser .
