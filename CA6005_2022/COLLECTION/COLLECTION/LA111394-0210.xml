   <HEADLINE> PHILIPPINES WILL CONSIDER OFFSHORE U.S. MILITARY DEPOT ; ASIA : PRESIDENT RAMOS TO DISCUSS TOPIC WITH CLINTON DURING FIRST VISIT BY AN AMERICAN HEAD OF STATE SINCE 1975 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the eve of talks with President Clinton , Philippine President Fidel V . Ramos said Saturday that his country might consent to having the United States set_up nearby the kind of floating military depot the Pentagon says it badly needs for regional crises . Ramos stressed that the idea has already been formally rejected by Thailand and that it would need to go_through several stages of consideration by Filipino and U.S. officials . But he also indicated that , at a time when he is trying to cultivate stronger U.S. economic ties , he did not want to reject the idea out of hand . &quot; I ' ve not seen any formal proposal . . . but looking_at this at a working level is a possibility , &quot; Ramos said in an interview at Malacanang Palace . The idea is likely to be highly controversial in the Philippines , which two years ago voted to eject U.S. troops from two colonial-era military bases , and where many citizens remain suspicious of U.S. intentions . That was demonstrated Saturday , when several hundred supporters of the leftist federation Sanlakas marched toward Clinton ' s hotel , shouting their opposition to any such agreement . They yelled &quot; Clinton out ! &quot; and called Ramos a &quot; puppet &quot; until they were dispersed by tear_gas and water_cannons . The first U.S. President to visit the 7 # 000-island archipelago since Gerald Ford in 1975 , Clinton and his wife , Hillary , arrived to a low-key ceremony at Ninoy Aquino Airport near midnight local_time . At talks with Clinton today , Ramos is expected to strongly stress that the country needs more American investment if it is to continue its recent economic_growth and stability . Clinton will also commemorate the joint World_War_II sacrifices of the Filipino and U.S. Army forces in appearances at the huge U.S. military cemetery in Manila and the Corregidor battle site in Manila_Bay . Tonight , Clinton heads to Jakarta , Indonesia , for talks with Asian leaders and a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum . Pentagon officials would like to have a floating depot where they could store enough equipment and supplies to sustain one heavy brigade for 15 days , for military or disaster relief operations in the Mideast or the Korean_peninsula . As proposed to Thai officials , the plan would include up_to 850 # 000 square_feet of storage for equipment that would include M-1A1 Abrams tanks and M-2A2 Bradley fighting vehicles . The gear would be stored on half_a_dozen huge ships or barges outside territorial limits . Some maintenance would be required , but the plan envisions no need for accompanying troops . Thailand turned_down the proposal . &quot; Establishing any armed depot in the Gulf of Thailand could lead to misunderstanding among other countries of the region , &quot; a spokesman for the Thai government said . He was presumably referring to China , which with its great size and growing power is a source of anxiety to many governments in the region . Indonesia and Malaysia are also reportedly wary of the plan , although State_Department officials say they were never formally asked . Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Abdullah Alatas has been quoted as saying that the balance of a U.S. presence in Asia is needed , but not in the form of military bases . Negative reactions by Indonesia and Malaysia may have also been prompted by their unwillingness to be a party in any military_action against an Islamic country in the Middle_East . In his interview , Ramos stressed the continuing strong mutual security commitments of the United States and the Philippines , noting that the two had recently conducted joint military exercises and that the Philippines had supported U.S. actions in Haiti and elsewhere . &quot; We have been responsive , &quot; said Ramos , a West Point-trained soldier who formerly directed the Philippine armed forces . &quot; We have supported U.S. and U.N. peacekeeping initiatives. &quot; Ramos said any plan for a floating depot would need to go before a review board of U.S. and Filipino officials that was set_up under a mutual security treaty in 1951 . The plan would then be reviewed by U.S. and Filipino diplomatic officials and considered by the legislature and other government_agencies . U.S. and Philippine officials last week announced a new agreement that will allow their warships to refuel and pick_up food supplies in each other ' s countries . Despite some Filipinos ' anxieties about U.S. influence in the region , Ramos has been pitching hard his desire for more U.S. investment to lift a country that is only slowly coming_out of the setbacks of the era of President Ferdinand E . Marcos . The Philippines ' growth_rate has recently risen to about 4 % , but unemployment is high , and the country desperately needs infrastructure improvements . But the nervousness of some Filipinos has been evident this weekend in demonstrations to publicize charges that the United States did not clean_up environmental damage at the bases before pulling_out its thousands of GIs . The talks between Clinton and Ramos may include other sensitive subjects related to the U.S. troop presence in the country . There is substantial domestic pressure for Ramos to bring_up the financial claims of former Filipino soldiers who fought alongside the United States , and of the Amerasian children of American GIs formerly stationed in the Philippines .</TEXT>
