   <HEADLINE> MIDEAST ; BIG WIN PUTS ISRAELI UNION CHIEF ON EVERY DANCE CARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Defeated by labor-union bureaucrats on reform of Israel ' s health_insurance system , Haim Ramon quit as health minister , challenged the old_guard in union elections and this week won a victory likely to shape Israeli politics for the next decade . Expelled last month by the governing Labor_Party as a traitor for challenging its control of the Histadrut , the union federation , Ramon found himself being courted Thursday by Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , wooed by other politicians as the country ' s new powerbroker and described by commentators as the person who will set the country ' s future agenda . Although he campaigned for less than a month , Ramon ' s ticket managed to win 47 % of the votes_in the Histadrut elections , overwhelming the Labor candidates who received only 33 % and lost_control of an institution the party had led since its founding 73 years ago . So stunning was his victory over the Labor_Party in the union elections that Ramon , 44 , immediately emerged as the leading candidate for the premiership when Rabin , 72 , steps_down , perhaps in two years and certainly in six . Labor scrambled quickly to bring him back into the party ranks . &quot; Haim Ramon will return to his natural place , the Labor_Party , but it will be a completely different party as a result of his victory , &quot; said Avraham Burg , a leading liberal in the party . &quot; A new revolution has started in_Labor . . . and there is a new agenda in the state of Israel -- a social one. &quot; The implications of the Ramon victory are far-reaching : * To take_on the Labor_Party leadership -- Rabin , Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and even old friends such_as Burg -- Ramon drew support from the leftist Meretz Party and the religious party Shas in a coalition . * Some Labor_leaders fear Ramon might be tempted to form such a coalition for the next parliamentary elections if he is not readmitted to the party or if Labor fails to change to his liking . Some triumphant Ramon supporters assert that this is precisely what he should do -- form a new party focused_on new issues . * A new generation -- men and women , like Ramon , in their 40s -- are preparing to assume leadership of the country , pushing_aside what is now called the &quot; lost generation &quot; of politicians who have been waiting for a decade and longer for Rabin , Peres and others to retire . * A prominent dove when he was in the Labor_Party , Ramon demonstrated that more_than 80 % of the country -- the combined total of votes for his ticket , the Labor_Party and the Communists -- favor Israel ' s efforts to reach peace with its Arab neighbors . The opposition Likud Party and its right-wing allies polled only 18 % of the votes , down from 27 % at the last union election . * Likud Chairman Benjamin Netanyahu will face new challenges to his leadership within his party , not only because it has lost much of the ground it had gained in previous Histadrut elections , but also because it has not been building the broader electoral support that would return it to power . &quot; We saw an amazing thing -- the whole nation standing_up together , religious and secular , Jews and Arabs , intellectuals and working people , &quot; Ramon said of his victory . &quot; It was a development I could not have imagined . . . . This is the coalition the Labor_Party has dreamed of for years. &quot; Ramon , a lawyer by training , will become secretary_general of the Histadrut . With 1.6 million members , it represents about 67 % of Israeli workers . More_than that , it owns many of Israel ' s major companies , runs its largest health_care and sports programs and provides so many services that it is almost governmental in character .</TEXT>
