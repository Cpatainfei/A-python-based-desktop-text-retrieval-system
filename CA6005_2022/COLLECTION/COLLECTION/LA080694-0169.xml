   <HEADLINE> U.S. ECONOMY GAINS NEW GROUND ; EMPLOYMENT : DESPITE A RISE IN THE JOBLESS RATE , ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS ARE FOCUSING_ON THE ADDITION OF 259 # 000 NEW JOBS LAST MONTH . INCREASES IN AVERAGE EARNINGS ARE ALSO OBSERVED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nation ' s unemployment_rate edged_up to 6.1 % in July from 6 % in June , the government reported Friday , but the slight rise masked a vigorous gain in employment that ignited investor fears of renewed inflation and raised the odds of the Federal_Reserve_Board boosting interest_rates again . California ' s jobless rate climbed more sharply , rising to 9 % last month from 8.3 % , as the state ' s sluggish economy continued to lag behind the nation and produced skimpy job increases . In Los Angeles County , the unemployment_rate was 10 % , down from 10.1 % in June . Nationally , analysts and investors focused_on a stronger-than-expected gain of 259 # 000 jobs last month in the closely watched survey of employer payrolls . Also suggesting robust economic_growth were increases in both average hourly and weekly earnings . The job gain is &quot; a very healthy increase and what it says is that businesses are still catching_up_with the fact that they didn ' t do any hiring for so_long , &quot; said Cynthia Latta , an economist with the consulting_firm of DRI / McGraw-Hill in Lexington , Mass . But Latta , echoing concerns on Wall_Street about the prospects for inflation , said &quot; there ' s got_to be pressure out there pretty soon in the job market for higher wages. &quot; Wall_Street over the past week had focused_on reports suggesting that the nation ' s 3-year-old economic recovery was slowing slightly . Consequently , investors began anticipating that the Federal_Reserve would not raise interest_rates soon . But based on today ' s reports , investors &quot; changed their minds again , &quot; Latta said , and turned their attention to the Fed ' s upcoming Aug . 16 meeting . Bond prices fell more_than one point , pushing_up yields on 30-year Treasury_bonds to 7.54 % from 7.4 % late Thursday . The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 18.77 points to close at 3 # 747.02. So far this year , employers have added a hefty 2 million jobs to their payrolls , a strong surge that is encouraging more people to enter the labor_force . One side_effect of the influx of job hunters , though , was the jobless rate rose last month even as_many new jobs were being generated . Last month ' s job gain was down from the 356 # 000 increase in June but the July total , economists said , was held_down by such factors as the strike at Peoria , Ill.-based Caterpillar Inc. During July , the economy showed its biggest gains in_services and retail trade , with restaurants , supermarkets and furniture stores all reporting increases . More workers also were added by temporary employment_agencies , one of the fastest growing segments of the economy . President Clinton proclaimed that &quot; the future looks good , &quot; alluding to employment figures during a Rose_Garden ceremony marking the first anniversary of Congress ' passage of his deficit-reduction program . Clinton said his program &quot; helped drive those interest_rates down and got this economy moving again. &quot; Republicans dissented . &quot; The truth of the_matter is , the President inherited a good economy when he came_in , &quot; Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) told reporters , adding : &quot; All he had to do was make_sure he didn ' t mess it up . The economy is continuing to look fair but it ' s not running wild. &quot; California ' s jobless rate remained the highest among the 11 big states whose employment figures were released Friday . North Carolina posted the lowest rate , 4.7 % . Given the relatively small sampling on which the state figures are based , California ' s jobless rates often are volatile . And even with last month ' s increase to 9 % , it remains well below the 9.6 % rate in April and the 1994 high of 10.1 % in January . Economists generally considered the state employment figures mediocre , but there was enough ambiguity in the statistics for varying interpretations -- particularly by politicians . For instance , Gov . Pete Wilson called the increase in the jobless rate a &quot; temporary statistical variation &quot; caused in part by seasonal forces , such_as students entering the job market . He added that &quot; trends over the last several months have been moving_in the right direction . We are encouraged in the fact that more people are seeking work , &quot; even though the rise in the number of job hunters helped push_up the unemployment_rate . But Wilson ' s Democratic opponent in the Nov . 8 election , state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown , said the disparity in figures nationally and for the state indicated to her that California &quot; continues to be a drag &quot; on the U.S. economy . &quot; I have to tell you I don ' t see it as a recovery , &quot; she said in an address in Long_Beach to a group of women business_executives . The payroll survey showed a gain of 8 # 100 jobs in California during July , mainly in_services and manufacturing . On the other hand , employment in retail and whole trade was down 3 # 500 , and small declines were posted in three other industrial categories . The state ' s figures reflect &quot; a pretty flat economy , &quot; said Tom Lieser , an economist with the UCLA Business Forecasting Project . Friday ' s employment reports provide further evidence that California ' s disastrous economic slide since mid-1990 has &quot; bottomed_out , &quot; Lieser said , &quot; but we ' d like to see more snap to the recovery. &quot; Ted Gibson , an economist for the state_Department of Finance , said other economic indicators show that the state ' s actually is doing better than Friday ' s employment figures suggest . He pointed to strong gains recently in the state ' s retail sales and payroll taxes , along with the continued strength of the housing market despite recent increases in home mortgage rates . &quot; We ' re moving ahead , &quot; he said . &quot; Not as rapidly as we ' d like , but we ' re moving ahead. &quot; Gibson also said he was encouraged that the state ' s economy has been adding jobs lately despite continuing cutbacks in U.S. defense spending that have devastated California ' s aerospace industry . * At the same time , Friday ' s figures included downward revisions in job totals for both May and June . As a result , even with the job increase in July , the latest figures show California ' s employment as being down 8 # 100 over the last three months since April and up only 6 # 800 since the end of last year . By some estimates , the state ' s job total is still down by more_than 800 # 000 since employment peaked in mid-1990 . In addition , July ' s gain in manufacturing jobs may have been inflated by a statistical quirk . Many of the additional jobs appear to have come at food processing plants that hired seasonal workers earlier than usual this year , without actually increasing their permanent payrolls . Los Angeles County ' s figures -- which , unlike the federal and state statistics are not adjusted for seasonal trends -- showed employment rising by 7 # 000 in July to just over 4 million . The number of unemployed fell by 2 # 000 to 446 # 000 . * Rosenblatt reported from Washington and Silverstein from Los Angeles . Times political writer Bill Stall in Los Angeles also contributed to this story .</TEXT>
