   <HEADLINE> PRESIDENT DELIVERS CHEERING WORDS TO TROOPS IN KUWAIT ; MIDEAST : JOINING THE GIS AT THEIR DESERT OUTPOST , CLINTON GIVES THEM MORE PAY AND INDICATES THEY ' LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS . HE HEADS BACK AFTER SAUDI STOP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton won cheers from American troops in Kuwait in the time-honored fashion Friday : by increasing their pay and suggesting strongly that they would be home for Christmas . Most of Clinton ' s speech -- a recitation of the importance of their mission and of U.S. attempts to contain Iraq -- drew polite applause from the several hundred American troops gathered along with British , Kuwaiti and other Arab soldiers to hear his remarks amid a made-for-pictures assemblage of military hardware in the dust of the Kuwaiti desert . But when Clinton finished speaking , soldiers calling &quot; When do we go_home ? &quot; drew him back to the podium . Smiling , he looked_out at the crowd and said , &quot; Don ' t forget to go Christmas shopping , &quot; drawing loud and raucous cheers . Military officials , including Secretary_of_Defense William J . Perry , had already said that most , perhaps all , of the U.S. combat troops recently sent to the Persian_Gulf will be home for the holidays , assuming that Iraq refrains_from any hostile moves_in the meantime , although new units may be sent to replace those now here . That word , however , had not yet filtered down to the ranks , and virtually all_the troops interviewed by reporters before Clinton talked said the one thing above all that they wanted to hear was news on when they would be leaving . Several also mentioned a festering pay dispute involving subsistence allowances for enlisted personnel , and Clinton drew a loud ovation by announcing that he had signed an executive order that will mean about $ 300 per month extra for enlisted personnel deployed on combat_missions such_as this one . Clinton ' s speech to the troops at a tactical base northeast of Kuwait City and about 50 miles from the Iraqi border was the final public event of a Mideast tour that has brought the President through six countries in four days . After brief visits with the Emir of Kuwait and Saudi_Arabia ' s King Fahd , the President headed for home and is expected to return to Washington early this morning . Army officials , eager to create the proper setting for the presidential visit to the troops , erected a desert base worthy of a Hollywood sound stage -- complete with triumphal_arch about 30 feet high and made from a portable armored bridge , a stage built_on the backs of two M-1 tanks and a lectern draped with camouflage netting . On a small rise just behind Clinton as he spoke -- framing his head in television pictures -- were another M-1 tank and a Bradley fighting vehicle . White_House officials did their part too , positioning some of the Arab troops near the President -- within the line of the TV cameras -- in an effort to guarantee the right image of allied cooperation in the effort against Iraq . The troops , meanwhile , like soldiers everywhere deployed far from home , seemed happy to have a visitor , although for many , Clinton seemed a lesser source of excitement than CBS news anchor Connie Chung , who autographed helmets and regimental colors for the troops while awaiting the President ' s arrival . Despite the eagerness to go_home , morale seemed high among the troops who have been deployed for about three weeks in the constant grit , ever-present flies and arid heat that make the Kuwaiti desert among the most_unpleasant places in the world . Many seemed to make light of the conditions . &quot; We ' ve got sand in California too , &quot; said Pvt . Edward Horcasitas , 21 , of Hawthorne , an infantryman normally based at Ft . Stewart , Ga . Still , he joined the near-universal sentiment in favor of a quick exit . &quot; I ' m hoping he says we ' re going to go_home real soon , &quot; Horcasitas said of Clinton . Coming_out to the desert &quot; shows he cares , &quot; Horcasitas added . &quot; At least somebody knows we ' re down here . We don ' t see much about this place on the news now . We figure people kind of forgot about us. &quot; The other topic on the minds of the troops appeared to be the pay dispute . Under military regulations , troops deployed abroad to potential combat areas lose the money they would otherwise receive as a subsistence allowance -- about $ 200 per month -- on the theory that they do not need the extra pay while in the field because the military is paying_for their food and shelter . The funds , however , can amount to 13 % of the pay_for a low-rank soldier , and many families depend_on the money . In addition , troops had complained that the rule was unfair because under the same regulations , troops deployed on peacekeeping or humanitarian missions , as opposed to combat , get_to keep the funds . The new executive order changes the rules to allow the extra pay to continue as well as some smaller additional allowances , bringing the total to about $ 300 . While in Kuwait and Saudi_Arabia , Clinton and his aides discussed efforts to increase the amount of military hardware that the United States leaves pre-positioned in the region . Before the trip began , the Administration succeeded in winning permission from Kuwait and some of its Arab neighbors to strengthen its military presence in the region in an effort to speed_up its response to any future threat from Iraq . After weeks of negotiations , Washington announced on Wednesday that it had secured permission from Kuwait to station a squadron of 24 Air_Force A-10 Warthog antitank warplanes there permanently , starting at the end of this month . The Pentagon also announced that Qatar had agreed to store enough tanks and armored vehicles on its territory to equip a brigade of U.S. soldiers , about 5 # 500 troops . Last week , Kuwait said it will double its own storage facilities to house a full brigade ' s armor . The Administration has also been negotiating with the nearby United Arab Emirates to accept enough armor to equip a third brigade -- a move that would enable the United States to house enough weaponry for a full division near the Kuwait-Iraq border .
