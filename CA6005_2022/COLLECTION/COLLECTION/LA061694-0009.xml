   <HEADLINE> SACRAMENTO HEAT OVER SMOKE ; ISSUE ' S PROFILE MAY RISE AS SENATE DEBATES ANTI-SMOKING BILL AMENDMENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Compared with the high-profile drama over the dangers of cigarettes now playing in Washington , the long-running debate over secondhand smoke in Sacramento has been a quiet sideshow . There have been no squad of tobacco executives testifying before the Legislature on cigarette ingredients , no industry threats to sue individuals accused of leaking internal documents and no discussion of regulating cigarettes as a drug . Instead , the Sacramento doings in recent months have centered_on behind-the-scenes deals between legislators and lobbyists and on poison-pill amendments , designed to kill legislation rather than modify it . However , the sotto voce nature of this process could change today as the state Senate debates a final batch of such hostile amendments to what could become the first statewide workplace smoking ban in the nation . If AB 13 , sponsored by Assemblyman Terry B . Friedman ( D-Brentwood ) , survives these last-ditch efforts to sabotage it , the bill could be before Gov . Pete Wilson within weeks . Its passage , intact and unadulterated , would be -- and should be -- headline news hailed as a major accomplishment for the measure ' s broad coalition of supporters . More important , legislative approval would be a huge step_forward for the health and welfare of every Californian . Smoking is clearly dangerous -- to smokers and to those around them . AB 13 would ban smoking in almost all indoor workplaces . It is supported by the California Restaurant Assn. , the California Hotel and Motel Assn . and the California State Federation of Labor , not to mention scores of medical and public interest_groups and city and county governments . Indeed , because AB 13 ' s supporters include the very groups that would be involved most in its implementation , contentions by legislative opponents that the bill would prove costly to business carry little credibility . But those contentions do arouse serious questions about the integrity of lawmakers who doggedly are trying to block a reasonable bill that would benefit so many .</TEXT>
