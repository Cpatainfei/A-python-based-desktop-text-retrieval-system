   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; RIVAL SYSTEMS FOR VCR ' REPLACEMENT ' COULD SPARK STANDARDS WAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now that the videocassette_recorder has become a fixture in American living rooms , consumer electronics_companies and movie studios are hatching plans to supplant it with a newer and allegedly better technology : the digital video disc player . Sony Corp . and Philips Electronics are expected to announce as early as this week a jointly developed technical specification for the new discs , also known as high-density compact_discs . They will be able to store an entire feature_film and promise higher_quality , greater flexibility and possibly lower prices than videocassettes . But Toshiba Corp . and Time Warner Inc. are trying to rally support for a competing high-density CD technology -- raising the prospect of an ugly standards battle similar to the infamous Betamax-VHS war of the 1970s . Toshiba and Time Warner say their system can hold even more data , but they face an uphill battle against the two companies that have controlled the development of compact_disc technology since its inception . Movie and electronics_industry executives agree that a standards battle is not in anyone ' s interest . And they are united in the belief that a new home entertainment system , which could be_on the market by next year , has plenty of profit potential -- even though it might not bring many benefits to consumers . Electronics manufacturers hope the digital video disc player will eventually displace the VCR , just as audio_compact_disc machines have supplanted record_players in nearly half of U.S. homes over the last decade . And the movie studios , facing a declining video rental market as cable and satellite television_systems begin to offer a wide menu of movies on demand , think consumers -- who rejected the once-promising laser disc technology and have generally opted to rent rather than buy videocassettes -- will be much more likely to purchase compact_discs . * In an unusual collaboration , a committee of representatives from nearly every major movie studio met last month to offer a list of their priorities to the hardware manufacturers developing the new medium . &quot; If a digital video disc solution is presented in a way that large_numbers of consumers look_at it and say , ' This is better than tape and better than laser , ' then it becomes a mass product opportunity for people such_as us who control libraries to sell the films all_over again , &quot; said MGM / UA Home Entertainment President Richard Cohen . &quot; The best-case scenario is it does for movie catalogues what CD did for audio catalogues. &quot; Today ' s standard compact_discs hold about 72 minutes of music ; through compression technology , film studios have been able to squeeze 74 minutes of a movie at VHS resolution onto one of the shiny platters . In contrast , the new CD -- which spins twice as fast -- would hold 135 minutes of video at higher resolution . The physical format , which involves crowding the microscopic pits on the discs closer together , is also likely to become the basis for the next generation of CD-ROM discs for personal_computers . It might also become a new standard for music CDs . But many consumers might resent being asked to invest in yet another new technology -- which itself might become obsolete in a_few years when a recordable CD is marketed . Dueling formats would almost certainly slow sales . Some in the industry are critical of Philips and Sony for not publishing their specifications , a step that might help establish a standard . &quot; Equipment vendors , movie studios and player manufacturers have pressured Philips , the de_facto licensing authority , to accelerate release of their HDCD standard &quot; said Ralph Oshiro , director of marketing communications for Santa Fe Springs-based disc equipment manufacturer Optical Disc Corp . But Philips officials said they have been holding_back on an announcement as they try to reach consensus with potential rivals . &quot; Anyone in the industry knows that a standards war would be a war with losers , &quot; said Jacques Heemskerk , Philips ' project manager for writable optical technologies , who is trying to hammer_out compromises with rival HDCD developers . &quot; There is a strong realization that if there would be two proposed systems , consumers will say it ' s better not to buy . It would be a real failing in our industry if we could not come_to a compromise. &quot; * The stakes are high . Sony and Philips have had a virtual lock on the audio_compact_disc market over the past decade . Their practice of cross-licensing patents and charging licensing_fees to other manufacturers is currently under an antitrust investigation by the Justice_Department -- a development that has made some competitors optimistic that the consumer electronics giants would not be able to extend their monopoly into the digital video arena . &quot; Ours has a higher data capacity , &quot; said a Warner Bros . executive who declined to be named . &quot; The higher data capacity , the longer the running time , the higher the data transfer rate , the higher the picture quality , the more audio channels and the more capacity for multiple soundtracks and multiple subtitle tracks. &quot; Industry sources say the Toshiba-Time Warner solution involves the creation of a double-sided CD , which could cost twice as much to manufacture as the single-sided version . The lack of a common format might cause studios to delay putting their films into yet another new medium that may never gain widespread consumer acceptance . &quot; We ' d like to see consumers end_up with better quality , more convenient delivery systems , &quot; Walt Disney technology vice_president Bob Lambert said . &quot; But it has to happen without fractionalizing the market into too many non-compatible hardware choices. &quot; * But for consumers , the bigger question may_not be which type to buy , but whether to buy_at all . The digital video compact_disc may_not represent the same quantum leap as color over black-and-white or digital audio over scratchy analog tape . &quot; It ' s new technology , it ' s sexier , it ' s perhaps more convenient , because you don ' t have to wind and rewind , &quot; said Bishop Cheen , an analyst at Paul Kagan &amp; Associates . &quot; But like so_much new technology , it ' s going_to take getting used to . Our media-consuming habits die_hard . Look how long it took the push-button phone to replace the dial_phone . I don ' t know about your mom , but my mom still has a dialer. &quot; Indeed , the ultimate in CD technology is yet to come : be a CD_player that could record at_home and store a full-length movie at broadcast-quality video standards . However , the exotic solution may involve holographic laser storage techniques that haven ' t yet been invented . The Next-Generation CD Today ' s standard compact_disc , left , holds about 72 minutes of music or VHS-quality video . The data is encoded in microscopic pits on the surface of the disc , which is read and decoded by a red diode light_beam in the player . By crowding four times as_many pits onto the same five-inch disc , right , the high-density CD holds about four times as much data -- the equivalent of a 135-minute movie at higher resolution than standard video . New CD : Boom or Bust ? Electronics and movie companies hope that the high-density compact_disc player will become the new VCR ... U.S. household penetration of VCRs : 80 % ( 101.17 million units sold to dealers 1985-93 ) U.S. household penetration of laser disc players : 1 % ( 1.33 million units sold to dealers 1985-93 ) Source : Electronic Industries Assn .</TEXT>
