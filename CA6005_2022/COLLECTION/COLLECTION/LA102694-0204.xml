   <HEADLINE> ONCE-HOSTILE FORCES WORK SHOULDER TO SHOULDER AT TREATY SIGNING SITE ; SECURITY : COOPERATION BETWEEN ISRAEL AND JORDAN ILLUSTRATES NEW MOOD IN REGION . EFFORTS ALSO REFLECT FEARS OF TERRORIST DISRUPTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Military_engineers from the once-hostile armies of Israel and Jordan worked around the clock Tuesday to ready a former desert minefield for the signing here of a treaty that will bring their countries peace . In an operation that reflected a new era of cooperation , even a kinship , soldiers from the two countries battled a sandstorm , 98-degree heat , then a sudden rain to prepare the new border station for today ' s ceremony . &quot; It ' s hard to recall that for two generations we have been enemies , &quot; an Israeli colonel said as he chatted with a Jordanian counterpart about the routes that VIP traffic will follow . &quot; This all seems , well , just so normal. &quot; Presenting the treaty to Israel ' s Parliament in Jerusalem for approval Tuesday , Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin spoke movingly of an era of peace , friendship , open borders and the growing acceptance of the Jewish state by its Arab neighbors . &quot; Normalization means an Israeli bus leaving the central bus_station in Jerusalem for Amman . . . and planes of the Jordanian airline crossing the skies of Israel on their way to Europe , &quot; he said . Trucks , he added , &quot; will leave Haifa carrying cargo for Amman ; businessmen will fly off in the morning to close a deal ( in neighboring Arab countries ) and return in the evening to Jerusalem , and families will go_off on trips to Jordan and Petra , three hours ' traveling_time from Tel Aviv. &quot; The peace_treaty with Jordan will be a major step toward Arab acceptance of Israel ' s place in the Middle_East , Rabin said , and will bring &quot; a fundamental and substantial change in our very existence. &quot; For people who have lived for many years in the sights of snipers from the other side , this is quite a change , Rabin reminded the Knesset , Israel ' s Parliament . The Knesset agreed and ratified the treaty , 105 votes to three with six abstentions . Yet in the very preparations for the signing ceremony on their frontier today , there were sharp reminders of the old era in the fears of further terrorist attacks by Palestinian radicals opposed to Arab-Israeli peace efforts . &quot; They intend to carry_out an attack , and we are taking all necessary steps to prevent them from being successful , &quot; Israeli police_commissioner Assaf Hefetz warned . While Israeli intelligence had no specific information on targets , Hefetz said police are afraid of an attempt to upset the celebrations . A massive security operation was under way here to protect Rabin , King Hussein of Jordan and the 5 # 000 dignitaries , President Clinton among them , who will attend the ceremony . In a unique operation , Israeli and Jordanian security_forces surrounded this border crossing and , working with the U.S. Secret_Service , created one of the most tightly protected environments ever for such a major international gathering . &quot; You set foot in the wrong place and you will have agents from three security services ready to shoot you , &quot; Uri Dromi , director of the Israeli Government Press Office , told photographers preparing to cover the ceremony . &quot; These security guys are very , very serious , and they have to be with so many leaders and top officials from so many countries in just 200 square meters. &quot; Roads in and out of the area , itself in the middle of an active minefield , have been closed , with thousands of troops patrolling both sides of the border . More_than 1 # 000 security personnel will protect the site and the guests . An even bigger security operation is under way in Jerusalem in preparation for Clinton ' s visit there Thursday and Friday . Israel is deploying more_than half of its 21 # 000 police to protect Clinton . Jerusalem , which normally has about 6 # 000 police , is getting more_than 4 # 000 additional personnel for the President ' s short stay , and more_than 1 # 200 are being deployed along the highway from Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . The United States has airlifted hundreds of security people and planeloads of equipment into the Middle_East to protect the President in the wake of recent terrorist attacks . &quot; The Americans want to close the whole country , &quot; police spokesman Eric Bar-Chen said when asked about plans to close the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway , one of Israel ' s busiest . Police warned Jerusalem residents that trips around the city by Clinton ' s 100-vehicle motorcade on Thursday and Friday will halt almost all normal traffic . &quot; If you don ' t need to be in Jerusalem that day , leave , and if you must be here but can stay_at home , do so , &quot; a police commander advised Israelis . &quot; If you must travel , allow an hour for a 10-minute drive . . . . People will need a year ' s worth of patience during these two days. &quot; The greatest danger , security officials say , will come if Clinton tours Jerusalem ' s walled Old City late Thursday night , as planned . Although police have flooded into the city this week , security officials fear that a Clinton Old City walk will bring_out stone-throwing Palestinian youths who know the roofs far better than they do . But that planned walking tour has stirred controversy . To underscore the American position that Jerusalem ' s status is an unresolved question , the White_House said it did not want Mayor Ehud Olmert to accompany the President when he visits the Church of the Holy Sepulcher , Al Aqsa mosque and the Western Wall of the old Jewish temple . Rabin is committed to the concept of a &quot; united Jerusalem ( as ) the eternal capital of the Jewish people and State of Israel , &quot; but he is loath to offend a President who is friendlier to Israel than any in decades . &quot; we ' ll find a way , &quot; a Rabin aide said . &quot; The President will get his midnight walk through the Old City , but maybe with a priest , a rabbi and an imam rather than a mayor. &quot; Rabin , proud_of the treaty he reached in negotiations with Hussein , accepted that it alone will not end terrorism but called it a major step toward that goal . &quot; We have lived with terrorism for a long_time , &quot; he told the Knesset . &quot; There are those who ask what is the point of peace if terrorism still exists . &quot; I can only promise that at the end of the road we will defeat it , &quot; he said . &quot; Peace is the only way to isolate terrorism . Peace will show the nations of the region that there is an alternative. &quot;</TEXT>
