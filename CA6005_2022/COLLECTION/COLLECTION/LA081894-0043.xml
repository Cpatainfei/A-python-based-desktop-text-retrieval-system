   <HEADLINE> RESIDENTS TARGET AIRPORT SAFETY , NOISE AT MEETING ; TRANSPORTATION : COALITION OF NEIGHBORS ALSO LEVIES COMPLAINTS TO LOCAL AND FEDERAL_OFFICIALS ABOUT FLIGHT PATTERNS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 200 residents packed a recreation center Tuesday night to complain angrily about increased air traffic , flight patterns over neighborhoods and low-flying aircraft associated with Santa Monica Airport . The meeting at the Penmar Recreation Center in Venice was called by Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter and Rep . Jane Harman ( D-Rolling Hills ) , whose district includes the Marina del Rey and Venice areas near the airfield , one of the busiest single-runway facilities in the nation . Federal and local authorities also attended . The meeting , which lasted three hours and included heated testimony from homeowners living under the airport ' s flight_paths , was called to address a list of safety and noise control recommendations from an ad-hoc safety committee composed of residents , pilots and airport officials . It was formed after three fatal plane crashes in the densely populated neighborhoods near the airport in the last nine months . Nobody on the ground was killed . The 20-member committee has asked federal and airport officials for increased pilot education , an evaluation of the airport ' s complaint process , more aggressive distribution of noise abatement and safety policies to pilots , and additional aircraft inspections ( many recent crashes have been blamed on engine trouble ) . Mark Wirth , a Harman aide , said the congresswoman ' s staff is working with the Federal Aviation Administration on the recommendations . &quot; We have received a letter from the FAA committed to dealing with these proposals , &quot; he said . Jeff Kruger , a Galanter aide , said the councilwoman has received dozens of complaints in the past few months about the airport , primarily concerning noise . A typical complaint from many at the meeting was the 95-decibel limit at the airport set by a 1984 agreement between the city of Santa Monica and the FAA . Many say the level is too high and is violated on a daily basis . &quot; I work_at home , and the planes are always over us -- you can ' t even think , &quot; said Frieda Marlin , a resident in the 795-unit Lincoln Place Apartments , just southwest of the runway . &quot; We ' ve always had lots of birds , but they sure don ' t sing anymore. &quot; Airport manager Tim Walsh said the decibel limit was reached after arduous negotiations that included residents , airplane manufacturers ' and pilots ' associations , and was unlikely to be changed . &quot; However , we will make a commitment to put sound-monitoring equipment on houses west of the airport , &quot; he said . Other residents griped about pilots who fail to adhere to the airport ' s recommended flight pattern , which remains a &quot; tricky little maneuver , &quot; Walsh said . Shortly after takeoff , pilots must veer left over the Penmar Golf_Course to avoid residential neighborhoods . After flying over the course , they must continue to Lincoln Boulevard before they can turn south . Planes going north must fly out_to the ocean before turning . Many residents said they want all pilots to make their primary turns_over the ocean and not over nearby residences . Other neighbors want the airport to scale back student flight patterns that they consider most bothersome and dangerous . In these flights , which make_up 28 % of the airport ' s air traffic , the planes often remain under 1 # 400 feet and execute a landing followed by an immediate takeoff . Walsh said the airport has already cut_back on such traffic , which made_up 37 % of total flights in 1990 . The airport has averaged one crash per 200 # 000 air operations , or about one a year -- a better record than the U.S. average of five per 100 # 000 takeoffs and landings . FAA officials said they hope to build_on that record and will implement a &quot; safety room &quot; at the airport in September that will feature additional pilot instruction . Recent Fatal Crashes April 20 , 1994 : Pilot Patrick Dean Brinnon , 36 , died after his single-engine plane developed engine trouble shortly after takeoff and crashed into the garage of a house in the 2300 block of Ashland Avenue in Santa Monica , about 100 yards from the airport . March 11 , 1994 : Passenger Gregory Leslie , 35 , was killed , and student pilot David Thompson , 22 , suffered a broken arm and second-degree_burns on his arm and hands after a four-seat Piper 28 developed engine trouble shortly after takeoff and crashed into an unoccupied house at 2734 S . Barrington Ave . in West Los Angeles . Nov . 26 , 1993 : Pilot Roy Belzer , 40 , and two passengers , Steven Pollack 34 , the son of film director Sydney Pollack , and David Lyon , 35 , were killed after their single-engine plane stalled while circling above the Santa Monica Pier and crashed in a residential neighborhood in Venice , 1.5 miles west of the airport .</TEXT>
