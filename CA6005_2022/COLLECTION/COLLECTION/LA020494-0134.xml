Prison officials identified the prisoners as Alvin Dennis , Paul Portillo , Nicolas Romero and Jimmy McKinney . McKinney was released from the hospital . Prison spokesman Kenn I . Hicks said the inmates were injured during Wednesday ' s search of the prison ' s administrative segregation unit , where inmates facing an administrative action are held_in one- and two-person cells . The eight-hour search was conducted after officials received information that &quot; there was a manufactured weapon in one of the cells , &quot; Hicks said . The weapon turned_out to be &quot; some type of plastic sharpened into a point to be used as a stabbing weapon. &quot; &quot; Inmates make manufactured weapons out of just about everything they can find , &quot; he said . Of the 159 inmates held_in the 100-cell unit Wednesday , 49 resisted the search of their cells and bodies , Hicks said . A team of corrections officers had to physically remove the inmates from their cells in what the prison describes as &quot; extractions. &quot; The four inmates suffered minor to moderate injuries when they resisted the extraction , Hicks said , added that it is believed that the officers acted properly . &quot; At this time we don ' t have any indication there was excessive force , &quot; he said . &quot; Any time we have a cell extraction , an incident report is written_up and reviewed. &quot; A weapons-possession charge will be filed against the inmate who had the plastic weapon , Hicks said .
