   <HEADLINE> MAJOR INSISTS HE WILL NOT QUIT DESPITE LOCAL ELECTION LOSSES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister John Major insisted Friday that he will not resign after the ruling Conservative government suffered a thrashing in local council elections across Britain . In a statement outside No . 10 Downing Street , Major replied to critics who would dispute his leadership : &quot; If anybody chooses to engage in that fight , they will find me standing there waiting for them . I will meet a challenge whenever it comes. &quot; The nationwide defeat of Conservative candidates in Thursday ' s elections -- conducted at the city and county levels -- was the worst in modern times , with the Tories winning 27 % of the total vote and suffering a net loss of 400 local seats . While the elections were clearly influenced by purely parochial concerns , politicians agreed Friday that voters had also expressed grave dissatisfaction with the Conservative government , which has been plagued by recession , higher taxes and a sense of a lack of strong political direction . The main opposition Labor_Party won 41 % of votes cast , while the Liberal Democrats climbed to 28 % . Labor_Party leader John Smith called the vote &quot; the best result in local_government in our history. &quot; Liberal leaders were equally jubilant . Political observers said the balloting was a reflection of the Conservative government ' s unpopularity and Major ' s inability to project himself as a strong national_leader . But analysts also noted that the government in power invariably loses votes_in midterm elections , and the government need not necessarily call national elections for three more years . Major predicted that the Tories will rally long before then , saying : &quot; The Conservative_Party that I care about is a good_deal bigger than any election setback . We must now pick ourselves up and fight_back . And that is precisely what I intend to do. &quot; But John Carlisle , a Conservative member_of_Parliament , called_for Major ' s resignation on Friday and threatened to mount a challenge to his leadership this autumn . Carlisle is not considered a serious challenger , but the mere fact that he would oppose the prime_minister is viewed_as a reflection of the disarray and vulnerability of the ruling party . A similar challenge in 1990 to Margaret Thatcher ' s party leadership resulted in her forced resignation -- which led to Major ' s ascension as prime_minister . He won a national election in his own_right in 1992 .</TEXT>
