   <HEADLINE> LANCASTER PRISON ' S ESCAPES EXCEED THE 1ST-YEAR NORM ; INCARCERATION : THE BREAKOUTS IGNITE THE FEARS OF RESIDENTS WHO FOUGHT THE FACILITY ' S CONSTRUCTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When a convicted murderer escaped_from the new prison here last fall by scaling an eight-foot block wall and two 12-foot chain-link fences -- all topped with razor wire -- he also shattered a state safety benchmark . Before that Oct . 6 breakout , California ' s prison system had gone almost six years without an escape by a male maximum-security inmate . Three months later , before the prison was even a year old , another maximum-security inmate escaped_from Lancaster , this time by hiding in a garbage_truck . He was crushed into a trash bale , then dumped at a landfill , where he was recaptured . Prison officials have attributed these escapes to construction defects and staff errors -- the sort of shakedown kinks that might be expected at a brand-new prison housing more_than 3 # 000 maximum- and medium-security inmates . But state records and interviews with officials at other new prisons in California show that Lancaster ' s first-year break-out record was far worse than the norm . &quot; It is not typical of any institution to have Level IV ( maximum-security ) inmates escape , whether it ' s in the first year or no matter how long they ' ve been in_operation , &quot; said Tip Kindel , a spokesman for the state_Department of Corrections in Sacramento . &quot; That is a very , very unusual event and one of very great concern to the department. &quot; The escapes were a key reason that state officials decided late last month to remove Otis Thurman as warden at the Lancaster prison . Thurman was urged to retire or accept a lesser position elsewhere . He has not announced his decision . During Thurman ' s tenure , two minimum-security inmates also escaped -- triggering a firestorm of controversy . &quot; I think it ' s an absolute embarrassment to the entire system that this brand-new prison -- state_of_the_art , supposedly -- could have four escapes in one year , &quot; said Danielle Marvin Lewis , a Lancaster businesswoman who led an unsuccessful fight to block the new prison . &quot; We have a very volatile situation out there , sitting within a half-mile of a residential_area . &quot; It ' s like living next door to a dynamite factory , in my opinion. &quot; Officials note that maximum-security breakouts are indeed rare . According to state records , only eight maximum-security inmates escaped statewide between April , 1982 , and February , 1988 -- all from three of the state ' s older prisons : San Quentin , Folsom and the California Correctional Institution at Tehachapi . All but one was recaptured . No maximum-security male inmates escaped_from any California prison in 1989 , 1990 , 1991 or 1992 , according to state records . In 1990 , a woman inmate escaped_from the California Institution for Women in Corona . In 1993 , the lone maximum-security escapee was Eric Rene Johnson , 23 , who climbed over the Lancaster prison ' s wall and fences . He was recaptured five hours later , outside a convenience market several miles away . Even so , his escape ignited fear and anger among residents and led the City_Council to drop its support for a proposed second state_prison in Lancaster . &quot; A murderer who was escaping_from their prison , desperate and capable of violence , was at loose on our streets while we slept , &quot; resident Donna M . Reed told the council . In a written report issued a month after the first escape , Warden Thurman said Johnson , after being assigned to work in a prison yard at 7 p.m. , climbed over the wall while two guards were &quot; simultaneously distracted. &quot; ( A state corrections official later said that no yard officer was supervising Johnson -- a violation of prison rules. ) In his report , Thurman said that after Johnson got_over the wall , &quot; unnoticed , ( he ) waited behind the housing units , presumably until dark , when he scaled the inner and outer perimeter fences. &quot; Razor wire was installed atop the wall and fences to entangle and injure anyone who tries to scale the barriers . Prison officials have not publicly explained how Johnson got_over the wire without being seriously injured . Prison officers recaptured the inmate at 1:50 a.m. the next day . Prison administrators drew harsh criticism for failing to tell local sheriff ' s deputies about the escape until two hours after it was discovered . After the breakout and an investigation by state officials , Thurman vowed to increase the number of times inmates are counted each day from six to seven , and to step_up security checks around the fences and housing areas . In his report , the warden said state investigators attributed the escape to &quot; staff negligence , construction deficiencies and procedural inadequacies. &quot; ( State_prison spokesman Kindel later said the investigators &quot; did not find any construction deficiencies in the escape route. &quot; ) At the conclusion of his report , Thurman stated that the Lancaster prison would receive $ 25 # 000 to provide 800 more hours of training on escape procedures to all employees . Nevertheless , the Lancaster prison was also the site of the only maximum-security escape reported so far in 1994 . On Jan . 13 , Steven Charles Brigada , 25 , serving a life sentence for attempting to murder a California Highway Patrol officer , was working in the prison kitchen . Although inmates are allowed to enter a garbage bin area only while accompanied by a guard , Brigada somehow slipped into a waste bin without being seen . Prison_guards escort garbage_trucks in and out of the prison . But on this morning , no one saw Brigada as the truck lifted the bin that he was hiding in and emptied it into the vehicle . The inmate was injured when the truck compressed its load , then emptied it at a local landfill . He was recaptured after calling_for help at the dump . Administrators at the prison have refused to provide further details on the two escapes or to discuss what disciplinary actions -- if any -- have been taken against guards who were_on duty . They have said these are sensitive security and personnel matters , which require lengthy , confidential investigations . Still , some members of the prison ' s 15-member Citizens Advisory Committee have complained that the scarcity of information and Thurman ' s low profile after the escapes only increased local fears about the institution . &quot; People need to be told what has taken_place , &quot; said Antelope Valley College President Allan Kurki , a committee_member . &quot; We have to build_up a confidence base in the community , and it ' s not going_to happen if the only response we get is : ' We can ' t discuss this. ' &quot; Thurman is_on a personal leave and has been unavailable for comment since his removal . James H . Gomez , director of the California Department of Corrections , would not comment on the escapes or Thurman ' s conduct as warden in Lancaster , a spokesman said . Residents were particularly upset because the recent escapes involved maximum-security inmates . The breakouts confirmed the worst fears of residents and local officials who waged a vigorous campaign in the late 1980s to block construction of a prison in Lancaster . Earlier in the decade , state lawmakers decided that a prison had to be built somewhere in Los Angeles County . They pointed_out that the county was producing about 40 % of the state inmates but had no prison within its boundaries . In a 1987 &quot; pain-for-pain &quot; political compromise , state legislators ordered that one Los Angeles County prison be built_in the predominantly Republican high desert , while the other would be in predominantly Democratic East Los Angeles . Strong opposition from East Los Angeles residents killed plans for that prison . But a similar campaign in Lancaster , citing the prison ' s potential impact on local water_supplies , courtrooms and property values , failed . &quot; We specifically chose not to use the fear of escape as an issue because we thought that could create panic , &quot; recalled Lewis , who chaired the committee opposing the Lancaster prison . &quot; We thought there were more_than enough other reasons not to build the prison. &quot; Still , many residents did say they feared that inmates would escape and harm people in neighborhoods near the prison . The site selected by the state was at 60th Street West and Avenue J , about four miles west of downtown Lancaster . On Feb . 1 , 1993 , the $ 207-million prison , occupying a 252-acre site , opened . Local officials were so anxious to disassociate the community from the prison that they fought -- successfully , this time -- to keep &quot; Lancaster &quot; and &quot; Antelope Valley &quot; out of the prison ' s name . California State_Prison -- Los Angeles County was designed to house 2 # 200 inmates but because of statewide overcrowding problems , it now houses just under 4 # 000 . As of March 1 , the prison_housed 1 # 887 Level IV , or maximum-security , prisoners . When inmates enter the state ' s general prison population , they are assigned to one of four security levels , based primarily on the length of their sentence . Their background and their record of behavior behind bars are also considered . Maximum-security inmates most often are convicted murderers and others who have committed violent crimes or multiple offenses that have led to long sentences . If a maximum-security prisoner maintains a good behavior record , he or she can eventually be moved to one of three lower-security levels . Lancaster ' s maximum-security inmates live_in cells and are closely watched , but there are no Death-Row inmates -- such prisoners are housed only at San Quentin . To discourage escape , state officials have begun installing lethal electrified fences between the two chain-link barriers that surround most maximum-security prisons . Lancaster is slated to receive one , but a date has not been announced . By contrast , minimum-security prisoners , who usually have committed nonviolent crimes and have short sentences , live_in open dormitories with no fences around them . Although the two maximum-security inmates who escaped_from Lancaster set_off the greatest uproar in the community , two minimum-security prisoners living_in barracks outside the prison fences , also walked away in July . Within four days , both were recaptured in the Los Angeles area , one after being involved in a carjacking , authorities said . In addition to the four escapes , brawls have erupted among inmates and between inmates and guards at Lancaster . Guards have shot four inmates who ignored orders to stop fighting . No inmates died in these incidents . Members of the prison ' s advisory committee have said skirmishes are to be expected at a prison . But they did not expect the string of breakouts . &quot; I am totally overwhelmed that we have had four prisoners escape in less than one year , &quot; said Howard Brooks , executive_director of the Antelope Valley Board of Trade and a member of the prison ' s advisory committee . &quot; People are real concerned , &quot; he added . &quot; You have to assume that a prison is a prison -- and none of this one-year shakedown business . It ' s supposed to hold prisoners securely from day-one. &quot; The state operates 28 prisons . Lancaster is one of 11 housing Level IV inmates . But none of the other California prisons opened in recent years match Lancaster ' s record for maximum-security escapes : * No maximum-security inmates have escaped_from seven-year-old California State_Prison -- Sacramento , which houses 3 # 000 Level IV prisoners , or from Pelican Bay in Crescent City , which opened in 1989 and houses 2 # 000 maximum-security inmates . * No prisoners -- maximum- or minimum-security -- have escaped_from Calipatria State_Prison , which opened in January , 1992 , or Centinela State_Prison in Imperial , which opened in October . * California State_Prison -- Corcoran has had no escapes by Level-IV inmates since it opened in February , 1988 . In 1993 , however , one medium-security prisoner got_out by hiding in a laundry_truck . * No escapes have occurred at California ' s two newest women ' s prisons , which opened in Stockton in 1987 and in Chowchilla in 1990 . At the California Institution for Women in Corona , which opened in 1952 , the last maximum-security escape occurred in 1990 . * One of the older prisons , Tehachapi , which opened in 1933 as a woman ' s facility , has had only one maximum-security escape since it was converted to a men ' s prison in 1954 . Convicted murderer Vincent Motley somehow obtained a guard ' s uniform and used it to drive_out of the facility on Feb . 1 , 1988 . He was recaptured about a week later . At older prisons , guards must &quot; walk the tiers &quot; to keep_an_eye_on the inmates . At the newer prisons , including Lancaster , guards can watch the inmates and open each cell electronically from a central , enclosed control booth . The new prisons also have fewer &quot; blind_spots &quot; where inmates can avoid being seen by guards . Jerry Enomoto , who was director of the California Department of Corrections from 1975 through 1980 , said that even the most secure structures must rely_on fallible human_beings . &quot; Occasionally , through somebody ' s error , escapes do happen -- even at a Level-IV prison , &quot; he said . &quot; If escapes happen , you have to hold somebody accountable. &quot; Ultimately , it appears that Thurman , the warden , was held responsible_for the maximum-security breakouts at Lancaster -- and lost his job largely because of them . &quot; Yes , it was a factor , &quot; said a prison system source . &quot; It ' s not that he did anything independently . But there was a management failure to make_sure the staff implemented the proper procedures. &quot;</TEXT>
