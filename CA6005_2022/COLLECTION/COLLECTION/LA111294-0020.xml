   <HEADLINE> U.S. , CHINA IN TALKS ON GATT RULES ; TRADE : CHINA WANTS WASHINGTON ' S BACKING IN MEMBERSHIP BID . KEY ISSUE IS WHETHER BEIJING SHOULD GET MORE LENIENT TERMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration and China launched an intensive , high-level drive Friday to resolve the most important and acrimonious dispute between the two countries , trying to settle_on the rules that will govern China ' s future economic relations with the rest of the world . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met for 45 minutes in the first of three scheduled Cabinet-level meetings between the two countries this weekend . They will be followed by a summit_meeting between President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Monday . Clinton will arrive in Jakarta on Sunday to attend an Asian trade conference . In all_of the sessions , China is expected to press the United States to support its bid for membership in the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . In effect , China wants to join the club of the world ' s leading trading nations , and to do so as quickly as possible . The main question is whether China -- now emerging as one of the world ' s leading economic powers -- should be given different , more lenient treatment than American , Western European and Japanese companies in the world trading system . The dispute has huge implications for American companies that try to sell their goods in China . At issue is the extent to which China may give special protection for its own industries , and to favor them over foreign products or companies , as it enters the GATT and its successor , the new_World Trade Organization . When American companies try to do business in China , &quot; we still often face a Chinese market that is closed , &quot; Assistant Secretary_of_State Winston Lord told reporters Friday . The controversy is also important beyond the United States and China . U.S. officials say that if they let China enter the world trading system on special or privileged terms , they may be asked_in the future to do so for other countries . &quot; Any special conditions we give to China will have broad implications for the next members of GATT , &quot; one senior Clinton_Administration official explained . &quot; There hasn ' t been a major new member of GATT for a long_time . All of us recognize that Russia and the Eastern European_countries will be next in line. &quot; For months , China has been arguing that it is still an impoverished , developing country and should not be forced to compete on equal terms with developed nations . Chinese officials point_out that China ' s per capita income level remains low , no more_than a_few hundred dollars per year . But American officials counter that China ' s economy is growing so fast that it cannot be lumped with developing countries such_as , say , Rwanda , which have weak economies . &quot; China is the second- or third-largest economy in the world , &quot; U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told reporters Friday . &quot; It has a $ 28-billion trade surplus with the United States . . . . I don ' t think China ' s situation would enable it to be considered a developing country. &quot; Kantor is expected to meet with China ' s minister of foreign economic relations and trade , Wu Yi , for more_than three hours Sunday in what appears to be a determined effort to settle the dispute . Secretary_of_Commerce Ronald H . Brown will also meet this weekend with the trade minister . Over the last few weeks , Administration officials say , China has suggested repeatedly that if it cannot get what it wants from the Clinton_Administration on the GATT issue , then it will block progress toward trade liberalization at the summit of Asian_nations that Clinton will attend here next week . The Clinton_Administration and other nations , such_as Indonesia , are asking the leaders of the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to adopt a joint statement pledging to work for free_trade in the region by a fixed date , such_as 2020 . &quot; The Chinese have been trying to say , ' Our price for signing the ( Asian ) leaders ' statement is U.S. support for China ' s admission to GATT , ' &quot; one senior U.S. official said . China has been bargaining hard to gain admission to the world trading group in time to be considered a special member of the new_World Trade Organization when it is set_up in January . And Beijing has applied the brunt of its pressure on the United States , which it views_as the principal obstacle to getting_into GATT on the terms it wants .</TEXT>
