   <TEXT> Science Finds , Industry Applies , and Man Conforms -- Motto , Chicago ' s 1933 International Exposition on Progress Bruce Webster hates new technology . The electronic gadgets at the Irvine psychologist ' s home are forever flashing triple zeros . He refuses to use a cellular_phone because it would end his favorite pastime of listening to rock ' n ' roll while driving to work . But Webster is feeling pressure to change . He now uses a pager so his patients can reach him instantly . And to put himself in touch with the times , he is considering the unthinkable : computerizing his practice . Call it the technology trap . As America rushes headlong into the Computer Age , more people are finding themselves responding to the allure of a powerful new master . Encouraged by aggressive advertising and eager to keep_up with the cyberspace Joneses , millions are racing out_to buy personal_computers , often with the idea that they will help their job prospects or bolster their children ' s education . For some , computers can do just that . But , at least for now , technology ' s calls may be a siren song that can lure the unprepared into unwise investments of time and money and lots of unnecessary Angst . The uproar over a comparatively minor flaw discovered in Intel ' s most advanced computer chip , the Pentium , shows how little most people know about the complexity and quality problems of PCs -- and how little manufacturers know about the needs and desires of non-technical consumers . Many such users find that PCs demand long hours of tedious self-instruction for few tangible rewards . For them , their machines can become little more_than costly toys . More_than half of the 10 best-selling software_packages are games . And computers simply aren ' t the special entree to the future that many people expect . &quot; You don ' t need to know computers for the age of computers , &quot; says Greg E . Blonder , who is starting a laboratory at AT &amp; T to study the interaction of people and technology . &quot; You have to be adaptable ; you have to learn how to learn. &quot; The flood of computer advertisements this holiday season -- the first ever in which consumers are buying as_many PCs as corporations -- portrays the computer as the miracle machine . &quot; Did you ever have to get_up in the middle of the night and go_to the bank ? &quot; Microsoft asks_in one ad that shows a computer glowing in the dark . Another Microsoft ad has two little_girls asking their father to forgo &quot; Goldilocks &quot; as their bedtime story and instead use the computer to explain Sartre and existentialism . And Intel is running a TV commercial that shows a family riding its computer through various adventures as if it were a modern magic carpet . &quot; They are making parents feel guilty for not having a computer for their children , &quot; says Robert Corpuz , PC analyst at Dataquest Inc. , a San Jose research firm . &quot; It ' s a strong emotional tug. &quot; &quot; If they ( children ) don ' t learn how to use computers by the fourth grade , they will be lost in the technology , &quot; said Ed Anoskey , a Boeing manager , as he charged a $ 1 # 666 Packard Bell multimedia computer for his 10-year-old granddaughter at a Seattle store . &quot; There is so_much to absorb. &quot; People concerned about their employment prospects may also be attracted by the promise of the PC . Some say a new national divide is developing between technological haves and have-nots , and one had best be_on the right side of it to be assured of prosperity and job security . &quot; If you are not computer-literate , do not expect anyone in your organization to respect you , &quot; scolds management guru Peter Drucker in a recent article in Forbes . &quot; My 5-year-old granddaughter would have no respect for me if I told her , ' You know , I ' m afraid of the telephone. ' She would n ' t believe me. &quot; &quot; Times change , &quot; says Drucker , &quot; and we must change with them. &quot; Bill Machrone , a columnist for PC Magazine , suggests that &quot; eschewing personal_computers in this day and age is like saying ' no thanks ' to refrigeration. &quot; But if we step off the technology treadmill for a moment and reconsider , the real benefits may_not be so obvious . There is no question that many businesses and professionals gain important advantages from computers . And temporary agencies say applicants who know their way around a keyboard are more employable -- just as workers skilled in_using Wang word_processors were in great demand a decade ago . But has the PC become a basic appliance ranking in importance with the telephone ? Well , no . . . or at least not yet . Instead , by appearing to offer more_than it can deliver , experts say , the computer has contributed to a growing sense of fear and anxiety over new technology . It is still light-years away from the phone when it comes_to ease of use . The Pentium flaw , which can cause errors in certain kinds of esoteric calculations , and a multitude of less-publicized problems show that PCs are far from the technological maturity of most common electronics products . Almost half of those surveyed recently by PC Magazine had had problems with their machines . Just as early buyers of the automobile had to be rich , have some familiarity with mechanics and be willing to contend with shortages of good roads and gas_stations , computer use requires a great investment of money , time and patience . People who buy PCs without any technical know-how or any specific sense of what to use the machines for often find themselves thumbing through mind-numbing manuals and spending hours on the phone trying to get_through to a help line . A recent study conducted by Larry Rosen , professor of psychology at Cal State Dominguez Hills , found that only half of the American university_students surveyed were comfortable with computers . More_than one-tenth had physical reactions such_as heart palpitations and sweaty palms when required to learn a new technology . &quot; People can ' t keep_up with the pace of change , &quot; says Rosen , who calls the phenomenon &quot; technophobia. &quot; In a survey of about 400 users , market researcher Coleman Assn . of Teaneck , N.J. , found that most had sworn at their computers , close to half sometimes felt_like throwing something at the screen and 7 % had struck their machine with an object . Much of that frustration comes from inflated expectations about what computers can deliver . A Seattle physician recently spent $ 3 # 500 on a computer expecting it to quickly balance his checkbook and help him with diagnoses . But he hasn ' t had time for the laborious process of entering every check and ATM withdrawal , so he still lives with his checkbook unbalanced . After six months , the main product of his efforts is a letter to a friend that includes a tiny picture of his baby daughter printed under the return_address . In certain respects , computers have always been a technology in search of a problem . Even in the business world , companies have often treated computer_systems as a brute means of replacing workers or measuring productivity , rather than developing applications to meet specific needs . New York publishers , for example , once thought they could increase their editors ' productivity if they forced them to edit all their manuscripts by computer , says Scott Larson , a Seattle anthropologist and consultant who has helped large companies respond to backlashes from the inappropriate use of technology . But editors invariably printed out the long manuscripts and edited them by hand . People who promote technology &quot; always pretend to know how best to do things , &quot; says Larson . &quot; But technology is just a tool and you should question it. &quot; Many corporations have learned from the past and are taking a more skeptical approach to the introduction of new technology . Some companies are even putting non-technical people in_charge of their computer_operations to guard against implementing technology for its own sake . Patagonia , the Ventura-based sports clothing maker , recently installed Ed Schmults , a business manager with little computer knowledge , as head of information_systems . &quot; The owners of the company are reluctant to embrace technology unless it ' s very well thought_out , &quot; he says . Patagonia has avoided using voice-mail systems that force customers to punch strings of numbers before reaching a real person . The company recently decided against marketing its products through on-line services because early experiences showed they weren ' t an effective sales channel for them . On a smaller scale , Philip Bereano , professor of technology and society at the University of Washington , still reads his reports and letters into a Dictaphone for his secretary to transcribe . &quot; In some ways it ' s absurd , but I ' m efficient at it , &quot; he says . &quot; I can ' t sit still in front of a computer . &quot; People who are into computers won ' t admit the fact that some people don ' t need them , &quot; Bereano says . But it is increasingly common for people to feel compelled to buy computers without a clear idea of what they will be used for . &quot; I have a lot of friends who have computers and they don ' t know what to do with them , &quot; says Jack Rosenberg , 76 , of Pacific Palisades . He helped John Von Neuman , the inventor of the modern computer , design his first machine and is a skeptic about the computer ' s home applications . &quot; Their grandkids come_in and play video_games . At most they write an occasional letter , &quot; he says . &quot; They are buying machines that cost $ 1 # 500 to $ 2 # 000 because they think they will eventually need one . They buy_it to keep_up with their neighbors. &quot; Those who have no specific plans for their machines and find themselves combing through home computer magazines may be disappointed . In its December issue , Home PC carried an article with holiday ideas for family projects . Among them : Use a computer to make a &quot; Welcome , Santa &quot; banner to hang over the fireplace . Leading the consumer stampede are parents who feel their children need expensive multimedia computers to excel in school . And schools themselves often feel compelled to have rooms lined with computer_screens to show parents that they are up_on the latest technology . But numerous studies have produced little concrete evidence that children who learn on computers do better than those who stick_to books . Of course , with_children , there ' s another variable . Anoskey , the Boeing engineer , says he is buying a computer to help his granddaughter with her homework . But when asked what she will use the machine for , Megan quickly responds : &quot; Games. &quot; Certainly , there are good reasons for children to learn new skills while they are young . &quot; There is a period of life when we are organizationally sanctioned to learn , &quot; says Robert Kraut , professor of social_psychology and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University . &quot; There is less time later on. &quot; But the notion that learning to use a computer gives children a significant head_start in life is debatable . &quot; The computer is just another rich educational toy , &quot; says Sally Narodick , chief_executive_officer of Edmark , an educational software company . She compares computers to other educational toys like clay , building blocks and books that each play a role in learning . Indeed , the whole notion of computer literacy as a fundamental skill like reading or math may be inaccurate . Successive generations of students have sought to become &quot; computer literate &quot; with a_few college courses in programming . Only a tiny minority ever used those skills . Most saw the programs they learned quickly become obsolete as new generations of computers used new kinds of software . Microsoft , Apple and others are constantly changing their software to make_it easier to use . The person who masters Microsoft ' s Windows , for example , must learn a new set of skills next spring when Microsoft releases a new version that it says will be far more accessible for lay people . The student who uses a computer for the first time at age 20 will not suffer a disadvantage against a child of comparable educational background who has used a computer all his life , says Donald Norman , a research fellow at Apple Computer Co . and author of &quot; Things That Make Us Smart , &quot; a skeptical look_at new technology . He is part of a research group at Apple working_on software that will make computer use more intuitive for new users . &quot; Teaching kids how to use computers is the wrong thing to teach , &quot; says Norman . &quot; You end_up teaching things we ( at Apple ) are trying to make obsolete. &quot; By the end of the century , experts say , most computers will be embedded in appliances the way electric_motors are in washing_machines . &quot; At some point if you know your work it will be OK , &quot; says Judith Ramey , director of a laboratory at the University of Washington that helps corporations develop user-friendly products . &quot; You won ' t need to know technology. &quot; Even in highly computerized workplace environments today , analytic skills are generally valued more_than any mechanical knowledge of computers . &quot; You have to know what computers can give you , &quot; says Dennis Strigel , chief_executive_officer at Bell Atlantic Mobile , a cellular_phone company based in New Jersey . But Strigel notes that even in customer support jobs at the company , the key requirement is a college degree and the versatility to handle problems from billing to technical support . Until computers make the transition to being a simple appliance with applications that are obviously helpful and easy to use , there is liable to be a lot of hand-wringing . &quot; I don ' t want to do_it , I don ' t have time for it , &quot; says Webster , the psychiatrist . But he is resigned to his high-tech fate . &quot; I ' m going_to be dragged kicking and screaming into the Computer Age. &quot;</TEXT>
