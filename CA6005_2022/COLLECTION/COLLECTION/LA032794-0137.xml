   <HEADLINE> BILL MOYERS ACTS_UP ; IT ISN ' T ENOUGH BEING THE CONSCIENCE OF AMERICA ; HE WANTS TO BE AN AGENT OF CHANGE , TOO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The blue and magenta ceiling lights coat a high-tech set at PBS ' WETA television studio with a glitzy aura . &quot; On Bill Moyers , OK , &quot; says a technician at a console behind me . Moyers , 10 yards away , sits still as statuary , his handsome face turned_in profile , a makeup woman spraying and brushing his already perfect hair . He has been through this routine for 23 years , most of them on_his_own terms , the journalist without a brief except the brief he sets for himself : conscience of America , some would say . The taping resumes , and an oversize screen to Moyers ' left displays Bill_Clinton orating . On monitors inside the control_room , the wall behind Moyers glows magisterially , like a midnight sky traced with purplish rocket trails . With Moyers as interlocutor , two best-selling political authors , William Greider and Kevin Phillips , are about to take_aim at the President and big-money politics . In quick succession , like knife_thrusts , Moyers leads the two -- and after them , a group of activists -- in delivering the blows . They list the President ' s ties to corporate America and lambaste his &quot; skimpy &quot; attempt at campaign-finance reform ; they lay out the mechanisms of lobbying , the damage done to democracy . It is typical Moyers -- discourse interlaced with mini-documentaries . Then , just after Moyers thanks his final guest , just before the credits roll , he turns toward the camera , his face a study in sober geniality , and lets slip the journalist ' s mask . In that famous Texas baritone , rich with gravitas , he appeals_to his audience to act . &quot; You can work to challenge the system , &quot; he says . &quot; Call this toll-free number . . . . Let me repeat that . . . . &quot; A few weeks later , &quot; Money Talks &quot; is the opening installment of PBS ' &quot; Bill Moyers ' Journal &quot; for 1994 and , it would seem , the opening act for the second_half of the journalist ' s life . This is the year that Bill Moyers -- in a riposte to critics who have long called him partisan -- becomes an activist . &quot; I really believe our democracy is being auctioned_off every day , &quot; he tells me days before the taping , &quot; and that unless we address the dominance of money in politics , we ' re going to lose our democracy . Whatever voters want , donors can trump and negate . One of the consequences of the sabbatical &quot; -- Moyers is only recently returned from eight months off -- &quot; is to realize it ' s not enough just to produce television . I have also as a citizen to try to be an agent of change on at least one fundamental issue . And that issue is money politics. &quot; A year earlier , Moyers had called me from New Hampshire . &quot; I ' m up here taping Donald Hall , the poet , &quot; he said . &quot; He ' s dying . It ' s very moving. &quot; In those days , he was mentioning death more_than a little . &quot; I guess I ' ve outlived my time , &quot; he had joked in November , 1992 , fumbling with a ticket machine in the Washington Metro . Then , back in New York : &quot; You should watch me interview Agnes de Mille ; I want to tape her before she dies. &quot; And driving_around his hometown , Marshall , Tex. , his mood was sometimes funereal . &quot; What breaks my heart , &quot; he said , pointing through the windshield at Marshall ' s faded downtown , &quot; is that this next block and all on around was just one small shop after another , full of mysteries and wonders and goods from all_over the world . That hotel was as bustling as Times Square. &quot; Now , he says succinctly , &quot; It ' s dead. &quot; It had been a dark season for Moyers . In October , his grandson , William Henry Moyers , was born with a serious lung defect . Moyers flew back and forth from his homes_in New York and New Jersey to Atlanta , where his son and daughter-in-law live , charting the baby ' s progress , worrying about his namesake ' s tenuous hold_on health . He anchored &quot; Listening to America , &quot; a weekly campaign series of round-tables and issue pieces -- many of which critiqued image-over-reality politicking -- and , when it ended , looked_up_to see such programs all but declared passe in the supposed era of phone-in talk_shows and infomercials . He had a new PBS series set for February of 1993 , &quot; Healing and the Mind &quot; ( a variation on the theme of death ) , but when he looked beyond that , nothing was sure . &quot; In the middle of the path of our life , &quot; wrote Dante to begin &quot; The Inferno , &quot; &quot; I found myself in a dark wood because the right way was lost. &quot; This middle is the moment when death becomes real and it produces a desire for a change_of_life . At the end of 1992 , contemplating his upcoming sabbatical , Moyers told me he was &quot; hoping for an encounter , someone or some experience to indicate a new way . I don ' t want to go_on just repeating myself more efficiently , &quot; he said . His franchise , as he put it , had worn not out , but down . Now , seemingly out of the woods , Moyers explains his new activism as &quot; partly a function of contemplation , partly a function of age. &quot; He is charged_up , passionate . Rather than retreating , as he had implied he might pre-sabbatical , he told me he is &quot; bountifully blessed &quot; with new plans : In the next few years , he will pursue television projects with less &quot; intensity , &quot; but there will still be monthly &quot; Journal &quot; entries , plus a four-hour special on violence and a 10-part look_at the Genesis Seminar , a salon at New York ' s Jewish Theological Seminary of America that focuses_on the first book of the Bible . And Moyers will continue to declare himself an &quot; agent of change. &quot; &quot; There are things I want to do other_than produce television , &quot; he says . One week after &quot; Money Talks &quot; aired , he faxed me . An estimated 20 # 000 people called the 800 number , his missive said . &quot; At least those people take citizenship seriously. &quot; TRUTH TO TELL , BILL MOYERS POST-SABBATICAL HAS PLENTY IN COMMON with the pre-sabbatical man . The 800 number may be new , but the impulse behind it isn ' t . Moyers has made a career of being Citizen Moyers , projecting the image of a private person going public in the Thomas Paine mold . Pre-TV , he might have been a crank writing letters to the editor or printing his own broadsides , a la &quot; Common Sense. &quot; But in the postmodern age , he has seized_on television ( and its corollary soapboxes -- book spinoffs , lectures ) to pronounce his jeremiads and sing his stories of hope and healing to a never-big-enough audience . ( He ' s sensitive about his ratings ; just 2 % of the nation regularly tunes into PBS. ) Moyers ' life journey started in Hugo , Okla. , and Marshall , Tex. , where his family moved when he was 3 . At the Marshall News Messenger , he was a cub reporter after school , and at the Central Baptist_Church , an active member . In 1959 , he was ordained a Baptist minister , but he followed instead another calling and became a politician ' s apprentice , working for Lyndon B . Johnson during Johnson ' s Senate years and his presidency . After Moyers resigned from Johnson ' s White_House , he became a newspaper_publisher , at Newsday in New York , and then a reporter again , at CBS and PBS . This particular pilgrim ' s progress , from political actor to observer , has made him controversial -- the far right considers him a liberal mouthpiece , the left can ' t quite forgive him for press-agenting for LBJ . With his history , and his penchant for saying things like &quot; I am a moral agent &quot; and &quot; information is hope , &quot; Moyers doesn ' t quite fit journalism ' s tabula_rasa ideal . Instead , says a top Washington newspaper journalist , he is &quot; an American type , a morally vain , Bible-toting figure_out of the southwest. &quot; &quot; The rap on Moyers is he ' s too earnest , &quot; says ABC News political and media analyst Jeff Greenfield . &quot; I used to write for the National Lampoon ; I am incapable of that kind of earnestness . But if you want cynicism and jadedness , hip and ironic , boy , there ' s enough of that to go_around in the media . So a little earnestness ? that ' s fine. &quot; Moyers admits to having &quot; the persona of a scold. &quot; Told once that he was considered preachy , he demurred : &quot; Having been called that , I retreat from assertion. &quot; Hardly . Moyers retreats only until he cannot bear it , hurling his judgment darts like some banderillero aching to be matador . &quot; In the beginning was the Word , &quot; a Gospel starts , and he is a master of words , using them to wound our sense of the way things are . Consider his off-the-cuff capsule history of recent administrations . &quot; Look , &quot; he tells me , &quot; You got Lyndon Johnson campaigning for peace , and we went_to_war . Richard Nixon , law and order , and we got a gang that tried to steal the Constitution . Jimmy_Carter , competence , and we got a maladroit . Ronald Reagan , fiscal responsibility , and we got the largest debt in our history . George_Bush , promising a kinder , gentler nation , and we got the culture war , the religious war . How anybody could take seriously the legitimacy of a governing class that has perpetrated , from the Vietnam_War right on through , such costly policies on the American people , is a mystifying question to me. &quot; It is his dearest theme : political responsibility . The post-sabbatical Moyers is just much bolder about brandishing it . &quot; The Titantic ' s captain was indifferent , &quot; he says . &quot; I have always likened democracy to the ability of a passenger to go_up on the bridge and grab the arm of that captain and say , ' Sir , that ' s an iceberg out there. ' &quot; Moyers hasn ' t been shy about hoisting himself onto the bridge of the latest American ship of state . It started with an invitation to Transition Little_Rock . Washington Post reporter Howard Kurtz questioned him about the visit while Moyers and I limousined from Washington ' s National Airport to the CNN studio , where Moyers was about to sit in_for vacationing Larry King . &quot; We saw ' A River Runs Through It , ' &quot; Moyers purred into the cellular , &quot; and then we went_back to the governor ' s mansion. &quot; A pause . &quot; Well , where else was I to go ? &quot; The next day ' s Post headline tore_into Moyers for backsliding , being tempted by the sin of participation : &quot; Listening to Bill Moyers : Objectivity Questioned After Chat With Clinton. &quot; Which didn ' t deter Moyers , bent_on preventing another Titanic disaster . The night before Clinton ' s inauguration , Moyers delivered the main speech at an invitation-only prayer_service for the President-elect . Standing at the lectern , he offered his advice to the new President . &quot; At the core of our ( Baptist ) faith is what we call soul competency , &quot; he declaimed , &quot; the competence of the individual before God . Created with the imprint of divinity , from the mixed clay of earth , we are endowed with the capacity to choose , to be . . . response-able . . . . These beliefs do not make_for lawless anarchy or the religion of Lone Rangers . . . . They aim for a community with moral integrity , the wholeness that flows_from mutual obligation. &quot; &quot; It may be , &quot; Moyers preached to Clinton and Gore , &quot; that this inbred tendency in free church life is one of the best gifts you bring_to high office at this most pluralistic , fragmented and perplexed time in our history . &quot; He kind of lifted at that point , &quot; Moyers would remember happily . Not that he wasn ' t dubious about the new President . &quot; The Administration has a chance , &quot; he said shortly after the election , sitting in a bar sipping a vodka tonic , &quot; if they don ' t screw_up , which I think they will. &quot; Post-sabbatical , Moyers has exchanged the persona of scold for a prophet ' s harsher tones . &quot; I had high hopes not only for Clinton but for the return of his party to power , for fresh faces , fresh voices and fresh willpower , &quot; he says with feeling . &quot; But I ' ve never seen anybody abscond so quickly . It ' s a year later , after the barricades have been stormed , and that new day of democracy , for democracy , turns_out to be midnight. &quot; BILL MOYERS FIRST WENT TO WASHINGTON IN 1954 , WHEN HE WAS 20 , A COLLEGE intern on then-Sen . Johnson ' s staff , writing letters to the voters back home . Moyers left after that summer disillusioned with what he had seen -- McCarthyism at its apogee . ( &quot; It was Edward R . Murrow ' s &quot; -- Murruh ' s , in Moyers ' soft drawl -- &quot; broadcast that made me aware it was not the Senate that first called McCarthy to judgment , but the journalist. &quot; ) Yet it can ' t have been a profound disillusionment , for six years later , Moyers came_back . Johnson called as he and his wife , Judith , were packing to move from Ft . Worth to Austin , where Moyers was going_to add a Ph.D. to his just-finished master ' s in divinity . He wanted the 26-year-old for the 1960 presidential campaign , as liaison to Jack_Kennedy . &quot; I told Judith , &quot; Moyers remembers , &quot; ' Leave everything in the boxes , just cross_out Austin and put_down Washington . We ' re going the other way. ' &quot; At 12 , he had been baptised , &quot; an affirmation of my desire to be in a right relation with God. &quot; At 25 he was preaching , circuit style , in small rural churches . Yet in Washington , he told me , he was instantly at_ease with power , even when it was exercised in Johnson ' s hideaway in the Capitol basement , where Moyers drank Old Capitol_Hill bourbon with the best ( and worst ) of them . ( &quot; I sure got drunk on it one night down there , &quot; Moyers says , laughing. ) Far from considering those days and nights any sort of lapse , he regards his ease of adjustment as a function of his religiosity . &quot; It didn ' t cause any moral crisis to be there ; it was a natural extension of your being prepared_for the world -- that ' s what soul competency means. &quot; He doesn ' t think &quot; the old story &quot; -- in his case , the Christian one -- ever ceases to resonate in those it informs , but as one pursues one ' s life , &quot; a continuing course in adult_education &quot; he calls it , &quot; you begin to realize the story ' s limits and listen for its successor. &quot; In 1961 , Moyers was named deputy director of the Peace Corps , where he remained for two years . Then , in November , 1963 , he went_to Dallas for President Kennedy and returned an aide to President Johnson . &quot; Kennedy ' s advance men had gone_down to set_up the November Texas trip , &quot; Moyers recalls . &quot; They had blundered terribly , and Kenny O ' Donnell , JFK ' s political adviser , asked me to go_down and hold the hands of all_the warring factions until Kennedy was in and out of the state . I was young and basically nonpartisan , and they knew that I was kind of a healer . And I told Kenny , ' I can ' t , I ' m in the Peace Corps ; the Peace Corps isn ' t political , so you have to get somebody else. ' &quot; Three hours later , the phone rang , and it was the President . &quot; He said , ' Bill , I want you to go_to Texas. ' I said , ' Mr. President , the Peace Corps can ' t get involved in politics. ' He said , ' Bill , you go_to Texas and worry about politics , and let me worry about the Peace Corps. ' &quot; Moyers did as he was told . Which is how , on Nov . 22 , he came_to be lunching in Houston at the Forty Acres Club with the chairman of the Texas Democratic Executive Committee . When word of JFK ' s shooting reached them , they chartered a plane and flew to Dallas . At Love Field , Moyers scribbled a note to Johnson : &quot; I ' m here if you need me. &quot; A_few minutes later , Moyers was motioned up into Air_Force One . &quot; We bonded rather quickly , &quot; Moyers says . &quot; We spoke a shorthand to each other , and I was useful to him. &quot; His four years with President Johnson were not without their low moments , some of which trail him today . Moyers has publicly apologized for what he says was marginal participation in circulating J . Edgar Hoover ' s files on Martin_Luther_King Jr . ( &quot; I was a very flawed young_man , &quot; he told a reporter , &quot; but I have never in my life engaged in character assassination. &quot; ) He also offers mea culpas about commissioning , on Johnson ' s orders , the infamous 1964 campaign ad in which film of a little_girl plucking daisy petals segues into an atomic_explosion : &quot; I wish I could take it back . &quot; The President said to me , ' You know , Goldwater is making a headlong dash toward respectability . Got to remind the public he ' s been reckless about nuclear_weapons , ' &quot; Moyers says . The daisy ad inaugurated the era of special_effects , contrived images in political ads , he allows -- &quot; which short-circuit the analytic process , which are so harmful precisely because they replace words. &quot; Still , the boss was pleased , and in the summer of 1965 , LBJ promoted Moyers to press secretary . &quot; It was a role that I resisted , &quot; says Moyers , &quot; but I couldn ' t say no any more_than I could say no to Kennedy when he asked me to go_to Texas. &quot; He told Judith , &quot; This is the beginning of the end , because no man can serve two masters. &quot; The second master was the press . &quot; The reason I get attacked by fellow journalists is they feel I ' m hypocritical . They say , ' Look , when you were press secretary , your administration regularly contradicted the very principles you so mightily espouse now. ' And there ' s no question about it . The two administrations I served , Kennedy ' s and Johnson ' s , were brought low by policies conducted in secrecy . Kennedy on Cuba , Johnson on Vietnam . &quot; Anyway , it ' s all past history , &quot; he says . The next quarter century of his life becomes two succinct sentences : &quot; I resigned in ' 67 and became publisher of Newsday , stayed there until it was sold in 1970 to the Los Angeles Times , and did ( the book ) ' Listening to America. ' In ' 71 , I was called by some people who were putting_together the ( news ) broadcast called ' This Week , ' and that ' s when I joined public television. &quot; In his hurry , he skips_over his move_in and out of network news -- twice he went_to work for CBS before giving_up on commercial television to start his own PBS-affiliated production company , Public Affairs Television , in 1986 . One Washington observer suggests another reason why Moyers fast-forwards through Life After Johnson : &quot; He could reasonably have dreamed about being President . But he was_on a train going a_hundred miles an hour -- right into the brick wall of Vietnam. &quot; Johnson ' s political collapse was also Bill Moyers ' . MOYERS IS SITTING IN AS HOST OF &quot; LARRY KING LIVE. &quot; AT 40 MINUTES before showtime , the phone rings , and Moyers picks it up : &quot; Hey , Larry &quot; -- King is calling from Hawaii -- &quot; I ' ve rolled_up the carpet , the boxes just arrived . I ' m going_to like it here , buddy. &quot; More chitchat . They are somewhat surprising pals -- Moyers the prince of the old news and King the celebrity of the new . A monitor on the desk softly plays the program that precedes King ' s , &quot; Crossfire , &quot; starring Michael Kinsley and John Sununu . Tamara Haddad , King ' s then-senior executive producer , sits across from Moyers , loosening him up with small_talk . Moyers ' eye catches the monitor . The mood goes from light to serious . &quot; That guy &quot; -- pointing to President Bush ' s onetime Chief_of_Staff Sununu -- &quot; should have ' lobbyist ' supered over his head every time he speaks. &quot; He notices Kinsley . &quot; Look_at the eyes , &quot; he directs me . &quot; He ' s arguing with a wink , &quot; he says . &quot; These guys are phony. &quot; &quot; Why do you think people even watch them , or Larry ? &quot; I ask him . He ' s aware I ' ve been transcribing the session on a small note pad , and now he gives me a morsel for it : &quot; Some people watch to fill_in the blanks , some people watch to fill_in the time , &quot; he says . I have the sensation that he is dictating , not talking , to me . &quot; People are so lonely , even when they live together , that a third_party in the house is always a welcome guest . It ' s noise in an otherwise empty room. &quot; It will be his turn_on the screen shortly . He will host a round-table on gays in the military , with Margarethe Cammermeyer , the National_Guard colonel dismissed for revealing her lesbianism , Massachusetts Rep . Barney Frank and retired Rear Adm . C . A . Hill . He will also quiz the Speaker of the House , Thomas S . Foley , and the majority_leader , Richard A . Gephardt , on the Clinton_Administration ' s chances for success . &quot; What do you ask these guys ? &quot; Moyers wonders aloud about Foley and Gephardt . &quot; They ' re not the most inspiring pair. &quot; Indeed , the conversation is not scintillating . Moyers manages to bring it around to what interests him , the notion of a pariah Congress and the President ' s relationship to it . &quot; Candidate Bill_Clinton stayed_away_from you folks during the campaign , &quot; he says , trying to provoke Gephardt . &quot; I mean , you were like lepers during the campaign , members of Congress -- a little exaggeration . . . . &quot; Well , &quot; responds Gephardt , &quot; first , we weren ' t treated that way in the campaign . . . . &quot; Afterward , Moyers is dismissive . &quot; It ' s squash , but they don ' t hit the ball you put against the wall . You hit a red ball there , and they make_it yellow and hit it back. &quot; They didn ' t -- the show ' s format doesn ' t -- play fair . Moyers couldn ' t exercise his customary control . He has already admitted that his own chat shows are a triumph of editing , not straight interviewing . &quot; If you were_on my show , &quot; he says , &quot; you would n ' t believe that was you talking . I ' d shoot 50 hours for the one I ' d use. &quot; In the second_half of the King show , Moyers encourages , then referees , a nasty point-counterpoint about the military ' s ban on gays and later delivers another bad review . It was not at all_the &quot; conversation of democracy &quot; he had intended . &quot; It was about arguing , not argument . It ' s a bloodsport , &quot; he says . &quot; I wasn ' t comfortable , &quot; he admits , &quot; and I just think I ' d be a rich_man today if I were . I ' m not . And I ' m saddened by that. &quot; He sighs . Such regret rarely passes Moyers ' lips . Instead , he says he considers himself well and happily out of the clutches of both the new news and commercial broadcasting . He left CBS -- and a big salary -- voluntarily , he reminds interviewers . &quot; There are few opportunities in any sphere of our society that can equal the freedom , the mobility , the access , the creativity , the license that I have in my job now , &quot; he says . He might also have added : the power and the glory . He is one of very few journalists whose names crop_up as presidential or vice-presidential material . Moyers doesn ' t always quash such talk . In July , 1991 , he coyly told the New York Times that a run would be &quot; fun &quot; ; a_few months later , he told the Washington Post he hadn ' t been seduced into electoral politics -- &quot; yet. &quot; The mere notion of a Moyers candidacy was the ostensible reason the New Republic made him its cover boy in August , 1991 . In a story by Andrew Ferguson , the magazine called Moyers a liberal fraud , accused him of getting privately rich off public broadcasting and generally attacked him for embodying one of the sins Moyers most often rails against -- the cultivation of myth to obfuscate venality . Moyers has always been sensitive to criticism . Now he went ballistic , paying_for two pages of ad space to rebut what he told me was &quot; an ideological attack by a journalistic hack. &quot; He quarreled over big and small points , saving perhaps his biggest outrage for Ferguson ' s attack against &quot; history &quot; in linking Moyers directly to the FBI ' s character_assassination of Martin_Luther_King Jr . in the ' 60s . &quot; If ( Ferguson ) were a gentleman , &quot; Moyers fulminated near the end of his &quot; Open_Letter , &quot; &quot; I would challenge him to a duel. &quot; In the resulting tempest in a media teapot , the New Republic piece was widely acknowledged as vicious , but Moyers was chided for overreacting . The words &quot; ego &quot; and &quot; obsessive &quot; came_up . At about the same time , conservatives were attacking public broadcasting ' s budget and casting Moyers as a biased villain in a liberal media conspiracy . Predictably , Moyers fired off more retaliatory letters . Months later , media writer Jon Katz , once a producer at CBS , weighed in with a witty New York Times piece that jabbed his former colleague -- &quot; a brooding , pious pain_in_the_neck , &quot; Katz acknowledged -- but also praised him . Moyers didn ' t let it pass . Seizing_on Katz ' s observation that he was mostly doing &quot; chats , &quot; he composed a fact-packed reply proving Katz wrong , ending with a writer ' s equivalent of a tight smile : &quot; Jon will no doubt think that setting the record straight indicates a thin skin . So be it . I do appreciate his advice that I not run_for President . Why should I ? As a journalist , I enjoy my work far more_than George_Bush seems to enjoy his. &quot; MOYERS HAS INVITED ME TO VIEW HIM THROUGH THE PRISM OF HIS HOMETOWN . &quot; Place is the glue on the stamp of time , &quot; he says . &quot; Even though I live_in New York and New Jersey , I ' m stamped. &quot; By Marshall , Tex. , he means . We begin at his mother ' s house . Over a cup of coffee , Ruby Moyers offers_up her explanation for the career choice her son made . &quot; Bill had no hobbies as a boy , &quot; she says . &quot; To this day he doesn ' t . He was too small to play football , too thin to play any sport , so he couldn ' t attract the girls on the basis of an avocation . But he became a reporter for the Messenger and he had the courthouse beat . And at 16 , after school , he would go_to the courthouse and stand around with the prosecutors , the judges , the defense_attorneys -- and would you believe it ? The girls would be congregated at the courthouse door , waiting for Bill , who was suddenly very popular , because he had the gossip. &quot; &quot; She ' s full of old stories , &quot; Moyers tells me , now at the wheel of my car . We are going 15 miles an hour , sightseeing . Marshall has a population of 26 # 000 , and like Everytown , U.S.A. , an outskirts crowded with franchise strips and big , alienating malls . But that ' s not where we are going . We are headed deep into old Marshall . &quot; Patsy Findlay lived_in that house that is now gone , &quot; he points . &quot; that ' s my church there , Central Baptist . There is the house where Gloria Taylor lived . I was_on my first double date with her . We were in the back seat . The couple in the front seat were necking . Gloria threw her arms back and said , &quot; Take me. ' And I said , ' Where ? ' Talk_of naive. &quot; Moyers has led this tour before , for the whole nation . His 90-minute &quot; Marshall , Texas ; Marshall , Texas &quot; is an oft-repeated PBS staple . He sounds its themes again today ; the hometown as teacher , touchstone for good or ill . As he did on film , Moyers doesn ' t shrink_from Marshall ' s dark side . &quot; This was the theater , &quot; he says ; we can faintly see the sign : &quot; Paramount. &quot; &quot; If you go_around the side , that ' s the entrance for colored . They would go_around to the side , and they ' d be sitting_up there in what we called the buzzard ' s roost . that ' s the kind of place it was. &quot; He pauses . &quot; I come_out of a culture that paid a terrible price for disallowing dissent . I think my scolding comes from being a Southerner who learned how much we suffered because we didn ' t engage in self-scrutiny and internal dissent. &quot; He pulls over and leads me up the lawn of a well-tended lot next to a restored historic landmark ; he shows me a plaque in the grass . It commemorates Georgiana Lale , and , not incidentally , the words on it were written by Moyers , a commentary in her memory he delivered long ago on CBS News : &quot; She . . . held no office except those stations which citizens must fill to keep things going , &quot; the plaque reads . &quot; Trinity Episcopal Church would not have been the same without her . . . nor the Red_Cross nursing_home volunteers . . . . Nor would the hummingbirds have been fed so lovingly on Fitzgerald Street . . . . I cannot count the ways she mattered , or her kind everywhere . If you look closely at the fabric of civilization which overlays the passions of this race , you will discover it held together with tiny rows of thread stitched by the hands of anonymous folk . No community makes_it without them ; no school , no church , no neighborhood or society. &quot; In case I don ' t get_it , Moyers makes clear what Georgiana Lale means to him . &quot; I am a self , an authentic self ; I truly matter , &quot; he says incantatorily . &quot; I signify historically . I am a moral agent. &quot; It is a fundamental tenet of fashionable contemporary thought , postmodern thought , that the self is anything but authentic , that it matters so little that scholars speak_of its death . Moyers is conversant with postmodernity and its offspring , deconstruction . But he is reconstructive , not deconstructive . He chooses to participate in what Elie Wiesel has called the new secular religion , a global wave of volunteerism , renouncing the aid of government and announcing the necessity of doing things yourself . &quot; Georgiana , &quot; he instructs me , &quot; having fed the hummingbirds , left the garden for the community. &quot; There will be one more stop on this tour . &quot; that ' s Bowie Street down there , that ' s Crockett Street , &quot; he says , &quot; and this is the house where I grew up. &quot; We peer into the front windows of 801 E . Austin St . &quot; That was my bedroom right there , first window to the right. &quot; His language is flat now , no rhetorical flights . &quot; Just a four-room house , that ' s what we had . This was a street of poor people , but you ' d never find this. &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; I ask . &quot; The stuff on the front_porch &quot; -- he waves his hand -- &quot; the old refrigerators and stoves , the boxes like this . It was clean and orderly . My mother and father had middle-class values even though they were working-class people. &quot; 801 E . Austin doesn ' t match his ideal of a web of community ; the fabric of civilization needs mending all_the more . WHEN THE LIGHTS GO_down_on the &quot; Bill Moyers ' Journal &quot; set , it ' s lunchtime . Ever the host , Moyers invites me upstairs , where sandwiches have been laid_out for the crew and the talking heads . At the top of the stairs , he pauses ; he has decided to interview himself . &quot; Is it on ? &quot; he asks , pointing to my tape_recorder . When I say it is , he says , &quot; Let ' s go. &quot; &quot; What ' s disappointing about Clinton ? &quot; he queries . &quot; It ' s that he took a dive in the first round on things that really mattered : fundamental reform of the political_system , getting money out of politics . The Clinton White_House has put itself on the side of the winners. &quot; &quot; What ' s the purpose of a political_system ? &quot; he asks next . &quot; It ' s not simply to be for the winners , it ' s not simply to bless the winners , it ' s not simply to lift the arms of the winners . It ' s to figure_out what to do about the losers. &quot; His anger won ' t end . He wants to matter in the world , to be a great man in an age that doesn ' t favor them . And in his own way , Citizen Moyers isn ' t shy about admitting it . &quot; I felt when my grandson was born that the history of the future is my downstream , &quot; he tells me . &quot; You begin to take yourself seriously historically . Not with grandiosity , but you realize , no matter what circle I ' m in , I matter . What Kazantzakis said in the end of his wonderful memoir , ' Journey to Morea ' : ' It ' s given to each man to serve one circle of ideas and people , and if he can ' t serve those ideas and those people , he can ' t save the world. ' That to me is what citizenship is all about. &quot;</TEXT>
