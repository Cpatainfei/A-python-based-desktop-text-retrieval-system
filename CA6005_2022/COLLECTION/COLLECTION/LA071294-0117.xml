   <HEADLINE> HE WILL MISS UNOCAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The pending departure of Unocal Corp. , a 104-year native of the local and state oil community , is a sad example of a trend that is threatening the California oil_industry and the state economy . At a recent economic forecast seminar in Ventura County , a UC Santa Barbara economist noted that the loss of manufacturing jobs is the most significant reason for the county ' s continuing stagnant growth . Unocal was born in 1890 in Santa Paula and was one of the many oil manufacturers that , through more_than a century of tax_revenues and lucrative manufacturing jobs , helped California achieve its powerful economic base . As we all know , that base has eroded in recent years due_to a recession . But it is more_than a temporary economic downturn that has oil_companies such_as Unocal looking_to sell its state operations . In fact , oil manufacturers trying to do business in California are finding fewer opportunities due_to unfriendly or cavalier business conditions imposed by government . For example , at a time when production along the outer continental_shelf is near capacity , transportation options to the huge Los Angeles refinery market are being limited or written_off , forcing companies to compete for dwindling pipeline space . Recent negative transportation developments include the indefinite shutdown of a crucial Four Corners Pipeline Co . line running from Kern County to Los Angeles , which was damaged by the Jan . 17 earthquake ; the rescinding of a permit for Chevron to tanker crude_oil from Point Arguello to Los Angeles , and the permanent shutdown of a 13-year-old Exxon offshore storage and treatment facility that used tankers to transport oil from the Santa Barbara Channel to Los Angeles . In each of these cases , government disinterest or regulation was unresponsive to the needs of the oil_industry , causing area manufacturers to transport state oil to other refineries ' areas -- especially Texas -- at a significant loss of revenue . It ' s important to remember that Unocal isn ' t leaving the state because oil is no longer a profitable type of business . Rather , it is choosing to invest in other states and countries where government believes_in opening doors for the oil_industry -- not slamming them shut .
