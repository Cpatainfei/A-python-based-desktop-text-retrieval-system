   <HEADLINE> ZENECA GROUP TO PURCHASE 50 % STAKE IN SALICK HEALTH ; HEALTH_CARE : THE DEAL CREATES A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN A CANCER_DRUG MAKER AND AN OPERATOR OF CANCER AND KIDNEY CENTERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a groundbreaking move by a pharmaceutical company to get more directly involved in patient care , British drug maker Zeneca Group said Thursday that it will buy a 50 % stake in Salick Health_Care , an operator of outpatient cancer clinics , for nearly $ 200 million . The deal creates an unusual partnership between Zeneca , a leading maker of cancer_drugs , and Los Angeles-based Salick Health , which operates cancer and kidney dialysis treatment centers throughout the United States . In recent years , pharmaceutical companies have tried to cope_with rapid changes in their global markets by investing in generic drug makers or in firms that manage prescription_drug programs for employers or insurers . But Zeneca ' s deal takes a different tack , in_effect putting the drug maker directly at the patient ' s bedside . David Barnes , Zeneca ' s chief_executive , said the deal gives his company access to valuable medical-outcome data from Salick clinics that should help Zeneca ' s scientists &quot; better target their drug research and development efforts. &quot; The deal also helps the_British firm move_into the U.S. managed care market and better understand how to cost-effectively treat cancer patients . &quot; This isn ' t just another way to push more Zeneca products through Salick , &quot; Barnes said . &quot; Where appropriate , ( Salick ) will use Zeneca products , and where appropriate they will use products by Bristol-Myers Squibb or other companies. &quot; The deal gives Salick Health the financial resources it needs to expand its operations in the United States and move_into Britain and other overseas markets , officials said . And it caps a personal success story for Salick ' s chairman , Dr. Bernard Salick , who founded the company in 1973 to provide kidney dialysis treatment and later built a highly regarded chain of 10 cancer clinics affiliated with hospitals such_as Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center in Los Angeles . &quot; There are great benefits from being involved with a company the size of Zeneca , &quot; which had 1993 sales of $ 6.5 billion , Salick said . Salick ' s shares soared $ 5.475 to $ 34.625 in Nasdaq trading on Thursday , an 18 % gain . The stock , which also gained $ 1.50 on Wednesday , had traded as low as $ 14 earlier this year . Bernard Salick , who owns about 25 % of Salick Health stock , will continue as chairman and chief_executive of the firm after the deal closes . Zeneca ' s move comes as pharmaceutical companies are increasingly searching for strategies to respond to rapid changes in their markets , such_as the expanding influence of managed-care companies in the United States and government price_controls overseas . One area that has attracted interest from some drug makers such_as Pfizer Inc. and Merck &amp; Co . is so-called disease management . Disease management involves developing cost-effective treatment standards for specific diseases and selling those services to health insurers and employers . Salick recently formed a managed-care subsidiary , SalickNet , that markets cancer management services to health_maintenance_organizations and other health_care purchasers . Earlier this year , Zeneca formed its own disease-management subsidiary focusing_on cardiovascular_disease . Under terms of the deal , London-based Zeneca will have the option to buy the remainder of Salick Health ' s shares , which would bring the total price of the acquisition to more_than $ 440 million . Salick stockholders will get $ 37.75 in cash for each two shares they now hold , plus one share of special common_stock worth $ 1.25 a share . They will have the right to sell it to Zeneca after 2 1 / 2 years at $ 42 per share . Zeneca will also have the right for four years to buy the stock at market_prices , at a minimum price of $ 42 and maximum price of $ 50 a share for 2 1 / 2 years after the deal closes .</TEXT>
