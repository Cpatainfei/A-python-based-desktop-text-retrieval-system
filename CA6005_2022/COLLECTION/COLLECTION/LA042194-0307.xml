   <HEADLINE> DEREGULATING ELECTRIC_POWER ; POWERFUL QUESTIONS ; Q &amp; A : HOW THE PLAN WOULD AFFECT RESIDENTIAL AND INDUSTRIAL USERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The California Public_Utilities Commission ' s proposal to make sweeping changes in the way the state ' s electricity services are regulated eventually would give all industrial and residential customers the power to choose which company they want to supply their electrical_power . Here are answers to some key questions about the plan and how it could affect utilities , customers and regulators . * Q : What exactly did the PUC propose ? A : The commission laid_out a two-pronged plan . First , beginning Jan . 1 , 1996 , large industrial and commercial customers in California would be allowed to buy electricity from any source of their choosing , rather than simply from the utility company holding a monopoly in their service territory . That option would gradually , by 2002 , be extended_to all business and residential customers . Any customer could , of course , continue to tap the utility company as its source . Second , the state would shift away from traditional formulas that have tied electric rates to utilities ' costs for power_plants and other expenses . Under that approach , major investor-owned utilities have been able to recover costs by raising rates , even if the power-generating facilities have proven uneconomical , as was the case with Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. ' s Diablo Canyon nuclear plant . With the new method , known as a performance-based approach , utilities would be rewarded for more efficient operations , management and investments . To the extent that a utility could reduce costs below an established target , it could divide any savings between ratepayers and shareholders . * Q : Why did the PUC propose these steps ? A : The goal is to reduce the state ' s electricity prices -- which generally run 50 % higher than the national average -- by fostering competition . Lower rates would make California more attractive to businesses and therefore help create jobs . * Q : How would the plan work ? A : PG &amp; E , Southern California Edison Co . and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co . would be required to open their transmission_lines -- for a fee -- to companies seeking to sell electricity . Customers could choose any provider , but at least during a transition period , they would still be obligated to cover certain costs incurred by the utilities under the previous regulatory formulas . Utilities should not be forced to absorb those costs , the PUC said , since the plants were built under an earlier system . * Q : Who would stand to benefit most ? A : Utilities could benefit by competing without many of the previous regulatory restraints . For example , the current process of setting rates for large customers can stretch to 18 months . The new performance-based formula would put an end to that . Furthermore , utilities ' shareholders would be insulated from most risk , particularly with_regard_to expensive nuclear_power plants . Large industrial customers could gain by having the option of shopping around for better rates . * Q : What about small customers ? A : Some consumer advocates fear the PUC proposal would leave small business and residential customers out_in the cold by letting the utilities compete without risk . Performance-based regulation , they say , would allow utilities higher profits with less regulatory scrutiny . Also , they would have control over transmission_lines and would tend to favor themselves . The PUC said one of its chief goals is to protect residential customers by ensuring that utilities will pass_on any savings from increased efficiencies to small ratepayers . * Q : When would the changes take_effect ? A : Nothing has been formally decided . The PUC has asked interested parties to respond in writing by May 20 . On June 14 , it will hold its first public hearing on the proposal in Los Angeles . After that , it will determine whether other hearings are necessary before it adopts a final policy , probably in August . Customers would probably not see any effects until at least 1996 . The End of the Electric Monopolies The California Public_Utilities Commission has proposed an unprecedented deregulation of the electric utility business . Over the next eight years , all customers of Southern California Edison Co. , Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co . and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co . would be freed to buy electricity from the supplier of their choice , just as they are free now to select a long-distance telephone_service . HOW DEREGULATION WOULD WORK Under the PUC ' s plan , a range of power suppliers -- from the existing local utility to out-of-town utilities to upstart independent producers -- will compete to sell electricity to power customers . The local utility ' s existing transmission system -- including existing power_lines to homes and businesses -- will deliver the power to the end_user . THE PUC ' S PROPOSED TIMETABLE Deregulation would be phased_in over six years . 1996 : Large industrial customers can buy electric_power from any producer . 1998 : Deregulation extends_to smaller industrial customers 1999 : Deregulation extends_to commercial customers , including small business 2002 : All California customers , including residential ratepayers , may choose power supplier of their choice . IMPACT ON KEY PLAYERS Customers : The PUC says the freedom to shop North_America for electric_power would lower rates for all categories of consumers . But a transition fee covering the costs of big past investments by the utilities -- notably for nuclear plants -- will be tacked onto bills , trimming the savings . Utilities : They win in two ways . The commission endorsed in concept their proposal to switch from traditional rate-making to a method that allows utilities to pass_on savings from efficiency gains to shareholders and ratepayers . And the transition fee would make ratepayers -- not shareholders -- shoulder the costs of retiring old investments . Environmentalists / Alternative_energy producers : They are unhappy with the plan to eliminate utility set-asides guaranteeing business for suppliers of environmentally benign power . Consumers still would be able to buy power from such sources , but the sources might not be competitive .</TEXT>
