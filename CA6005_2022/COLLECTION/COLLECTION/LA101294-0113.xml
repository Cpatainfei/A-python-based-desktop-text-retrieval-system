   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL SUSPENDS TALKS WITH PLO OVER KIDNAPING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Tuesday broke_off talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization , closed the Gaza Strip and said the peace process will be jeopardized if an Israeli soldier kidnaped by Hamas , a militant Islamic group , is harmed . Rabin told PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat that Israel holds him and the self-governing authority he heads responsible_for the soldier ' s safe return , a Rabin spokesman said . The prime_minister ordered Dany Rothschild , Israel ' s chief negotiator with the Palestinians , to return for consultations from Cairo , where Israel and the PLO are negotiating terms for holding Palestinian elections in the West_Bank and Gaza . Rabin told Arafat that , if the kidnaped Israeli soldier is harmed , &quot; it may have a grave influence on Israel ' s relations with the Palestinian Authority , and on the future of the peace process , &quot; spokesman Oded Ben-Ami told Israel Radio . In Gaza , Arafat convened his military advisers but issued no statement . An aide said he was monitoring the case closely . In a videotape and handwritten statement delivered to a news_agency office in Gaza , the Izzidin al Qassam military_unit of Hamas claimed it had abducted Nachshon Waxman , 19 -- whom it identified as Nachshon Mordechai -- and said it will kill him by 9 p.m. Friday unless Israel meets its demands . The Hamas announcement came just one day after the group claimed responsibility for a bloody attack on Israelis carried_out by two gunmen Sunday night in downtown Jerusalem . That incident left two people dead and 13 wounded . The two attackers were killed by paramilitary police . Hamas on Tuesday demanded the release of its founder , Sheik Ahmed Yassin ; another leader , Sheik Salah Shehada , and two clerics of the militant Lebanese Islamic movement Hezbollah , Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid and Sheik Mustafa Dirani . Israel kidnaped Obeid from southern Lebanon more_than five years ago . It has held him inside Israel ever since . The Israelis kidnaped Dirani on May 21 and have held him . Hamas also insisted on freedom from imprisonment for dozens of its followers , members of another militant Islamic group , Islamic Jihad , and members of three PLO factions . &quot; If the Israeli government refuses our demands , it must carry the responsibility of the murder of the soldier and then we will negotiate afterward on his body , &quot; Hamas said in its statement . An Israeli army spokesman refused to comment directly on the kidnaping , although military sources confirmed that Waxman has been missing since Sunday night . He was last seen hitchhiking in the coastal_plain town of Ramle . A friend who left him at a Ramle intersection said Waxman hoped to get a ride to his home_in Jerusalem . His mother , Esther , issued an emotional appeal on Israel Television to her son ' s kidnapers , asking Hamas &quot; in the name of God , return my son to me. &quot; The kidnaping poses a severe test of the power of Arafat , who returned to Gaza on Tuesday night after attending a funeral in Morocco . In May , Israel turned_over responsibility for running daily life in Gaza to the PLO . Since then , Hamas has carried_out operations against Israeli soldiers and civilians , inside the Gaza Strip and within the boundaries of pre-1967 Israel . Each time an attack has occurred , Arafat has been pressured to publicly condemn it and to seek_out and punish the perpetrators . He has issued condemnations but has avoided cracking_down on Hamas , which enjoys widespread popular support in Gaza . Arafat has sought accommodation with the group , hoping to entice it into running in Palestinian elections , due_to be held_in the next several months . But this time , Hamas has pushed Arafat into a corner by kidnaping the soldier and demanding the release of Palestinian prisoners . Arafat and his embryonic government have been severely criticized by many Palestinians for failing to win the release of all prisoners held_in Israeli jails . Israel has held_up the release of 4 # 000 prisoners , saying it wants assurances that the Palestinian Authority can handle the security situation in Gaza before freeing them . But by closing the Gaza Strip , Israel is increasing the pressure on Arafat . Each day , tens of thousands of Gazans cross into Israel for work -- the primary source of jobs for the impoverished strip . A closure that lasts more_than a_few days is likely to severely strain the precarious finances of many Gaza families . The kidnaping is embarrassing for Rabin , who expects later this week to be named -- with Arafat -- the recipient of this year ' s Nobel Peace Prize . Rabin faces attack from the right_wing in Israel for signing an agreement that prevents Israel from pursuing into Gaza guerrillas who carry_out attacks inside Israel . He is likely to come under enormous pressure to make an exception in this case and search Gaza for Waxman before Friday ' s deadline .</TEXT>
