   <HEADLINE> THE SEARCH FOR BURIED ROCK TREASURE ; POP_MUSIC : NOW THAT THE BBC UNCOVERED A GOLD MINE WITH THE BEST-SELLING BEATLES ALBUM , THE RACE IS_ON TO DISCOVER OTHER LOST CLASSICS IN THE VAULTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After the success of an album of Beatles recordings unearthed by the BBC , the hunt is_on for long-lost classics from other star acts that may lie buried in the archives . Archivist Phil Lawton , who works in the basement of the_British Broadcasting Corp. , has 5 # 000 hours of old tapes to wade through , some of which contain genuine treasures . He has uncovered everything from live jam_sessions by the Rolling Stones and Fleetwood Mac to &quot; a stoned Bob Dylan being interviewed by a very strait-laced Swedish journalist. &quot; &quot; I am like a kid in a candy_store . It is brilliant , absolutely superb , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot; Live at the BBC , &quot; 56 songs recorded by the Beatles in the 1960s , soared to No . 1 on the_British album charts four days after it was released here . The tracks were discovered in the BBC archives by researchers who likened the find to the discovery of the Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamen ' s tomb . The album includes some of the Beatles ' greatest hits as well as cover versions of songs written by other performers such_as Chuck Berry and Little Richard . &quot; This is stuff that has never been heard before . They are so raw . I love their cover versions , &quot; Lawton said of the Beatles . A record company has asked Lawton to search for a rare 1972 &quot; Ziggy Stardust &quot; recording by David Bowie . &quot; There are a_couple_of Led Zeppelin sessions I would like to see out ( on a record ) . There are also a lot of Fleetwood Mac sessions I would love to see published as well as Manfred Mann and the Moody Blues. &quot; But some of the stars are reluctant to revive their raw youthful efforts . * &quot; A record company comes_to me to find_out what we have got . But there are a lot of copyright minefields to go_through . Someone like Bowie probably doesn ' t want this old stuff out and probably thinks it ' s rubbish , &quot; Lawton said . &quot; ( The rock_group ) Genesis , as far as I know , are not interested in putting_out this material . People are trying to get them to agree. &quot; Lawton has already waded through 5 # 000 hours of tapes . With another 5 # 000 to go , he is not complaining . &quot; I have discovered interviews with stars like Jimi Hendrix , Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin , who are now dead . It is so important this stuff doesn ' t get junked . &quot; This is a unique rock ' n ' roll treasure . No other broadcasting organization in the world has an archive like this. &quot;</TEXT>
