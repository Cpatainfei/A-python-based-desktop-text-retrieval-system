   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : WORLD CUP USA ' 94 ; UNFORGIVABLE ; THE NURDER OF COLOMBIA ' S ANDRES ESCOBAR AFTER HIS OWN GOAL AGAINST THE UNITED STATES UNDERLINES THE FACT THAT SOCCER FANS CAN BE DEADLY SERIOUS ABOUT THEIR GAME ; THE BLAME GAME BECOMES DEADLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The name Escobar had become in Colombia synonymous with corruption , avarice and evil by the time drug lord Pablo Escobar ' s pallbearers carried him to the Jardines Monte Sacro cemetery last December , a corpse honeycombed by a special security_force ' s bullets . The name Escobar bears a new significance now , not only in Colombia but throughout the World Cup ' s world beyond . Forever it will symbolize martyrdom in sport . It represents an unprecedented grotesquery -- the killing of a scapegoat -- that brings a new element of terror to a growing fear over athletes being held responsible_for the public ' s satisfaction , a bloodthirst as primordial and frightening as when gladiators staked their lives . Andres Escobar -- no relation -- is dead , same as Pablo Escobar , likewise ambushed by a hail of gunfire , likewise a casualty of the malevolent , paved-with-coke streets of Medellin . Andres was not as notorious as Pablo , not as feared and , sadly , not even as popular . But he too paid_for a sin . He was a soccer player , 27 , whose failing was that he accidentally misdirected an opponent ' s shot into his own side ' s net . It cost his team a game . It cost him his life . Joseph ( Sepp ) Blatter , general secretary of FIFA , soccer ' s governing body , called Saturday &quot; the saddest day I ' ve ever witnessed , in football or any other competition. &quot; But not only sad . Frightful . &quot; Who wants to play international football if you get assassinated doing_it ? &quot; was the outraged reaction of Jack Charlton , Ireland ' s national coach , who spoke , whether he realized it or not , for athletic figures everywhere . For this isn ' t merely football . This is tennis_player Monica Seles , stabbed with a knife by a deranged spectator , simply because she posed a professional threat to his favorite player . This is baseball_player Bill Buckner , compelled to leave New England with his family , reeling from years of verbal abuse from Boston Red Sox fans over misplaying a ball during the 1986 World_Series . This is pitcher Mitch Williams , returning home to death threats in Philadelphia after yielding a home_run that ended the 1993 Series . This is not the price of fame . This is the price of blame . The murder of Andres Escobar is a new low in an increasingly uncivilized world . Killed over a soccer match ? Killed over a human error ? It sends chills down the spine of one of the U.S. players , team captain Tony Meola , who said : &quot; This doesn ' t belong in sports . Unfortunately , some people don ' t realize that ultimately what we do , even though there is a lot of passion and pride involved , it ' s only a game. &quot; Yet try explaining this to Colombians who responded five years ago to a poll taken by the magazine Credencial , asked to anoint the most important story of 1989 . By far the winner , with 34.9 % of the vote , was Colombia ' s qualification for the next summer ' s World Cup in Italy . In second place was the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan . How apt , then , when another U.S. player , Alexi Lalas , offered his opinion on the death of a brother athlete . &quot; It shows a complete lack of respect for life , &quot; Lalassaid . By some , not all . But some can be enough . At 3:30 Saturday morning , several thugs confronted young Escobar outside the Restaurante El Indio and followed him to his car . Preliminary reports had one of the suspects speaking menacingly to Escobar , saying something on the order of &quot; Gracias por el auto gol , &quot; thanking him sarcastically for the own goal that he scored for the United States . Within seconds , Escobar was dead , riddled with as_many as a dozen gun shots . Police mobilized to do two things -- search for the killers and protect the victim ' s teammates . In Medellin , approximately 150 miles northeast of Bogota , hearts were broken . The team had lost and returned home_in shame . A teammate of Escobar ' s had received a death threat before the U.S. game and was withdrawn from the lineup by the coach . The coach , Francisco Maturana , also had been threatened . It was Maturana who before the tournament had recognized Colombia ' s link with drug-trafficking , acknowledged that he too had been an acquaintance of Pablo Escobar and others who subsidized teams with their drug money and became heroes to some . It was also Maturana , a dentist by trade , who said at the time , &quot; This country has suffered a lot . Soccer helps relieve the pain. &quot; Or causes more .</TEXT>
