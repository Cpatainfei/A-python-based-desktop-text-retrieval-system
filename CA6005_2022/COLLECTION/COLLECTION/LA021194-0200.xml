   <HEADLINE> ANTI-CANCER DRUG TAXOL SYNTHESIZED BY RESEARCHERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> San Diego researchers reported Thursday that they had achieved complete chemical synthesis of taxol , a promising anti-cancer drug made from the yew tree . The research by the team of scientists from Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla will be published in the Feb . 17 issue of the magazine Nature . Taxol was originally isolated from the Pacific_yew tree . More recently it has also been made from the European yew . Synthesis of taxol could help scientists devise ways of making large amounts of it relatively cheaply . Researchers at Florida State University also reported this week that they had been able to manufacture taxol in a laboratory using camphor and other chemicals . Taxol has been described by the National Cancer Institute as one of the best new cancer_drugs in 15 years and has shown promise in treating ovarian and breast_cancers that do not respond to other drugs .</TEXT>
