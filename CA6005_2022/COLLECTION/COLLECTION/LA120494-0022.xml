   <TEXT> My first memory of Art is green Jell-O and apple_pie . On Sundays my father and I went_to art museums -- neither my mother nor my brother would go . My father took too long for them ; he lingered for hours in front of certain paintings . He took two steps_forward and three steps back . But I was in it for the pie , the snack that came at the end . I had infinite patience . We started off together at the beginning of the exhibit . We looked_at the first painting and then the second , and while he was still on the second I was_on the third , the fourth , I had moved_on to the next gallery . I went_through the entire exhibition and then backward , returning to find him in the second room . He couldn ' t speak except to say , &quot; In a little bit. &quot; I sat on a bench . I waited . I faced a painting -- Rubens or Rembrandt . The face of the figure was luminous , the fabric of the clothes unfolding . I sat watching and thought_of my own efforts to draw -- to color . I examined the painting , the surface was smooth , the features of the figure delicate , there was the hint of a brush stroke , but only a hint . I wondered how art was made , how a painter could pull light out of a canvas . My father was a painter . On Wednesday nights a nude woman sat on a platform in our basement while my father and assorted other men and women drew pictures of her.I was not allowed downstairs . I was kept upstairs with my mother who made coffee and cut_up fruit for fruit_salad . On Sundays I sat on the bench in the museum looking_at paintings , wondering what really went_on in the basement , in all that silence with the door kept closed . People came and went , pushing strollers , carrying small children . Assorted strangers sat_down next to me and sometimes their sleeves or their arms would touch mine and I would think_of the nude woman in the basement and all_the men and women drawing her and my own efforts -- to color -- and my stomach would growl . In the quiet remove of the museum , guards hovering , my senses were heightened and everything became art -- the human traffic was a most modern_dance . I learned choreography , social history . It was Pinteresque play , I picked_up bits and pieces of dialogue . It was all a performance piece , a staged happening . I sat waiting for my father , for hours on end , a human camera , a recorder , watching . Later , when I was slightly older , more willing to wander , I took_on the entirety of the museum , I left my father with his Realism and High Renaissance and went_off on exploratory adventures ; two new museums opened , the Hirshhorn and the East Wing of the National Gallery . I found Picasso , DeKooning , Pollock and Rothko . I found paintings and sculptures that told the story of who I was , who I wanted to be , articulating my impulses and impressions , speaking_to me and for me , far better than I could speak_for myself . On my own , I raced forward through history , found the moment that was mine and then I went_back again , back through the galleries , through history , looking_for my father , hoping to pull him forward , to bring him with me . &quot; Almost , &quot; he ' d say when I ' d finally find him lost in another century , his eyes still fixed on a particular work . &quot; In a minute. &quot; &quot; I ' m fainting , &quot; I ' d say . And I ' d hear his stomach growl too . &quot; Time for pie , &quot; he ' d say , and finally there was something about which we agreed . We ' d go_to the old cafeteria in the National Gallery -- the cafeteria itself as much a painting , an installation , a play , a work_of_art as any of the exhibits . It was all my father ' s beloved social realists and it was Edward Hopper , Richard Estees and Duane Hanson . And all_of it from beginning to end was Warhol . It was pre and post and pop and old and chrome and shiny . My father would take a tray and go_down the line , picking_out first a slice of pie and then a piece_of_cake and maybe some chocolate_pudding -- he always had a problem with cafeteria lines -- too many choices . I ' d take a bowl of Jell-O cubes , red or green -- a delicacy , having come from a house where dessert was either carrot cake or zucchini bread . We ' d sit at a table with cups_of_tea trying the various deserts , marveling at the colors , the textures . I ' d swallow the Jell-O cubes , reveling in how they felt going_down -- slimy but substantial , marvel at the idea that green and red could be flavors as well as colors . And when we were done , it was always late , close to closing time , and we ' d make a mad dash for the gift_shop -- this was the one moment when my father moved quickly , &quot; with alacrity , &quot; he ' d say . My father was not a shopper , he didn ' t believe_in buying anything other_than what was needed , required , and as far as he was concerned almost everything I wanted was not required . The one exception was the gift_shop -- I could have whatever I wanted -- these things were essentials . It was late , the museum was closing , the guards had begun herding people toward the doors . We rushed , hurrying to gather what we could carry_away with us ; postcards , posters , reproductions and books , lots of books ; exhibition catalogues , monographs , themed collections , biographies , all_of it absolutely essential . We would stay until they asked us to leave , not once , not twice , but until the guards had to lead us out the long way -- around to the front of the building and through the already locked doors . And while my parents ' idea of a good Christmas_present was big pad_of_paper and a box of pens , this year I have a_few suggestions ; 1994 brought wonderful exhibition catalogues from Willem DeKooning , R . B . Kitaj , Bruce Nauman , Robert Ryman , Cy Twombly , along with the playful Picasso : Sculptor / Painter , and a beautiful monograph on Odillon Redon -- the_French painter , known as the Prince of Mysterious Dreams . The Andy Warhol Museum gives a behind-the-scenes look_at how museums are built . The catalogue comes_with a CD featuring bits and pieces of the Warhol tape archive -- the Velvet Underground rehearsing , etc . As companion volume -- the compulsively readable Death and Disaster : The Rise of The Warhol Empire and The Race For Andy ' s Millions by Paul Alexander , and for stocking stuffers , Warhol ' s Cats , Cats , Cats and Angels , Angels , Angels . Then there ' s the witty and ironic Prints of Roy Lichtenstein : A Catalogue Raisonne 1948-1993 , the long awaited , The Power of Feminist Art , a true reference_book with contributions by 18 of the movements , major figures including Linda Nochlin , Moria Roth , Suzanne Lacy and Arlene Raven . And Installation Art , the first history of one of the most significant and underreported -- due_to the large scale and often impermanent nature of installation projects -- contemporary art_forms . Vito Acconci by Kate Linker , a full-scale study of the New York-based artist best known for his early body / performance work . However , it is his more mature public art / sculptural pieces along the lines of the Adjustable Wall Bra 1990-1991 , which take_on issues of house and home and brilliantly illustrate how art at its best can at once be personal , political , humorous and philosophical . For the deliberately decorative and decorous : Stephen Calloway ' s Baroque : The Culture of Excess , and Pugin : A Gothic Passion , a scholarly and charming volume on perhaps the most influential designer / architect in 19th-Century Britain . Japanese Art After 1945 : Scream Against the Sky is that rare catalogue that is perhaps better than the exhibition . &quot; Create what has never existed before , &quot; Yoshihara Jiro , leader of the Guitai association declared . With essays by architect Isozaki Arata , video artist Nam June Paik and others , this catalogue contains a critical anthology with extended citings of writings by artists and critics along with a glossary laying_out historical events and groups essential to understanding postwar Japanese art . Isamu Noguchi , Essays and Conversations is eloquent and well-illustrated , with essays ranging from Noguchi ' s graceful proposal in 1927 for a Guggenheim Foundation fellowship to his comments on his multiple collaborations with choreographer Martha Graham . The Museum of Modern Art ' s A Century of Artists ' Books beautifully documents the history of the artists ' books and collaborations . And for the real_thing in contemporary artists ' books , San Francisco Artspace ' s Real Gone , a collaboration between photographer Jack Pierson and novelist Jim Lewis . New York Dada 1915-23 by Frances M . Nauman , traces the roots and Dada in the New York art world to the living room of Walter and Louise Stevens Arensberg where writers and artists such_as Marcel Duchamp , Charles Sheeler , Joseph Stella , congregated at the Paris salon of Gertrude Stein . This is the definitive volume on New York Dada -- a movement Robert Mcalmon prophetically referred to as &quot; the small , sweet , forget-me-not of the war. &quot; The Art Book is a kind of big art dictionary -- great for kids -- that suspends the timeline tradition of art history and arranges the artists alphabetically , one painting per artist . For those who prefer more thorough pondering , I highly recommend Theory and Philosophy of Art : Style , Artist , and Society , the latest volume of essays from legendary art_historian and teacher Meyer Shapiro , which includes his well-known text on Freud and Leonardo da Vinci , also Embodied Meanings , from Arthur Danto , art critic for the Nation , and Making It New , a lively collection of essays , interviews and talks from the late Henry Geldzhaler . For the classicists among us -- my father included -- The Sistine Chapel : A Glorious Renovation , a beautiful history of the nine- year renovation of Michelangelo ' s monumental frescoes and Michelangelo : The Medici Chapel -- Michelangelo as sculptor with absolutely stunning black-and-white photographs by Aurelio Amendola . Last but not least , my favorite volume of the year , highest marks for Howard Hodgkin by Andrew Graham-Dixon , chief art critic for the Independent in London . Howard Hodgkin is a painter I first encountered on one of those Sundays when my father cajoled me into going_with him to the museums . Truly one of the most wondrous artists working , Hodgkin ' s paintings are_intimate and intense , expressing the simultaneity of melancholia and ecstasy , representing neither the literal nor the narrative , but the impulses and emotions behind them . He is a psychological portraitist who , in describing his own work has said , &quot; I paint representational pictures of emotional situations. &quot; And while nothing takes the place of seeing the work in_person , these are the best reproductions to date of Hodgkin ' s work -- the Jell-O cubes and pie you ' ll have to supply yourself .
