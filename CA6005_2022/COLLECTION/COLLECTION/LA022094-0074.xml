   <HEADLINE> SPREADING THE WORD ; MORMONISM ' S TRADITIONAL VALUES APPEAL TO CONVERTS OF MANY ETHNICITIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Standing at the pulpit of a Mormon meeting_house near the Koreatown District , Virginia ( Ginger ) Johnson looked_out at the Sunday morning crowd and said , &quot; This is what I always envisioned Heaven to be like. &quot; Johnson was sharing her fast-day testimony with a crowd made_up of blacks_and_whites , Asians and Latinos , five-generation Mormons and recent converts . &quot; It ' s now like a mini-U.N. , &quot; said Johnson , who is black . The scene at a recent meeting of the church ' s Wilshire Ward underscores the remarkable success of the Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints , one of the nation ' s fastest-growing religious denominations and one of the biggest in California . While it is not quite the fastest-growing religious group in the United States -- that honor goes_to black Pentecostalists known as the Church of God in Christ -- Mormonism ' s gains are striking compared to declines of up_to 40 % reported for some mainstream Protestant_denominations . According to Mormon figures , church membership worldwide has climbed from 5 million in 1982 to 9 million today . For the first time in the church ' s 164-year history , half of the world ' s Mormons now live outside the United States , officials said . The church is_on the march at_home as well . Fueled by a high birth_rate and aggressive missionary_work , the church in the United States grew by 22.3 % between 1982 and 1991 , according to figures reported by the National Council of Churches . The Westside of Los Angeles , site of the largest Mormon Temple outside Salt_Lake_City , provides a striking illustration of the church ' s new diversity . The church does not keep records of membership by race . But from Hollywood to Westchester , from Pacific Palisades to Koreatown , Spanish- , Korean- , Tongan- and Cantonese-speaking wards and branches share leaders and buildings with older , English-speaking congregations . The area is home to Mormons who come from as far as Armenia and Nigeria , and from as near as Hollywood and Mar Vista , part of a growth_rate that church officials estimate at 5 % to 6 % a year in California . * After more_than a century of denying the priesthood to blacks , the announcement of a divine revelation opened that door in 1978 to &quot; every faithful , worthy man in the church. &quot; Since then , Mormonism has drawn an increased number of African Americans . The long ban on entry to the priesthood did not bother James A . Moody , an African American who serves as first counselor , the No . 2 position , in the Wilshire Ward . &quot; It took a long_time to get a mayor of a different race in this town , so everything takes time , &quot; said Moody , 63 , a retired oil-truck driver . &quot; There ' s a lot of beautiful people in this church , &quot; he said . &quot; And if they ' re not beautiful , I make them beautiful . I love them whether they love me or not. &quot; The attraction of Mormonism for people who may feel_out of the American mainstream is not new for the religion , which made many of its early converts among workers who were pushed_aside by the upheavals of the Industrial Revolution in the United States and Europe . &quot; Mormonism continues to appeal_to many socially and culturally disoriented members of society , &quot; wrote Klaus Hansen , author of &quot; Mormonism and the American Experience. &quot; &quot; They are attracted by a lay church that offers active participation to all_of its members and . . . an instant , socially cohesive group whose authoritarian male leaders set boundaries while providing recognition for behavior that conforms_to group standards . Many converts are especially drawn to the Mormon family ideal. &quot; Ginger Johnson , who now is president of the Relief Society , a women ' s auxiliary group at the Wilshire Ward , knew little about Mormonism when she got a call_out of the blue on Christmas_Eve 14 years ago . The caller said her name was Sister Lofton , and she asked Johnson if she would accept &quot; a wonderful gift. &quot; &quot; I was thinking nuns would come_by with a present , &quot; she remembered , &quot; and since when did nuns start doing that ? &quot; Sister Lofton turned_out to be a Mormon missionary . Her gift was an introductory lesson about Mormonism -- an intricate , controversial and demanding system of beliefs and social ties that was shaped in the backwoods of upstate New York and forged by decades of persecution in the 19th Century . &quot; All I knew ( about Mormonism ) was Donny and Marie Osmond , Brigham Young and plural marriage , &quot; said Johnson , a fortysomething contest coordinator for a cable TV_show . &quot; They told me to pray about it and I did , &quot; she said , &quot; and I knew it was true. &quot; What is Mormonism ? Neither Protestant nor Catholic , it is a family-obsessed lifestyle , a welfare system and a business empire as well as a religion . Even now , many other Christian groups find Mormons to be &quot; kind of far out , &quot; according to Ronald Enroth , a sociologist at Westmont College in Santa Barbara who has studied the church . The primary reason is Mormonism ' s view of the Bible as a flawed document in need of modern prophecy , he said , along with the church ' s unique view of the afterlife , the_virgin birth , and the nature of God and Jesus . Mormonism proclaims itself to be the restoration of Christ ' s church on Earth , with Joseph_Smith Jr. , its founder , and his successors speaking as prophets of old . It offers men a priesthood tracing back to biblical times , and women a role as wives , mothers , missionaries and advisers . In rites held behind closed Temple doors , white-clad spouses and offspring are &quot; sealed &quot; to each other &quot; for time and eternity. &quot; The spirits of dead ancestors , identified by zealous genealogical research in the church ' s data bank of more_than 2 billion names , are also offered a chance at glory , and those found worthy are promised resurrection as celestial beings , with the privilege to learn at God ' s feet and eventually to rise to a godly status . Even God himself , and his consort , the divine Mother , are said to have been creatures of flesh and bone in some remote past , who perfected themselves to the highest state . * The faith is rooted in the_Book_of_Mormon , which tells the story of immigrants from the Middle_East who founded elaborate civilizations in the Americas . Visited by Christ after the Resurrection , they prospered for centuries , only to disappear after falling victim to evil ways and fighting among themselves . Their story , inscribed on golden tablets , was said to have been found by Joseph_Smith in 1823 , guided by a vision of an angel named Moroni . It is an image of Moroni , covered in gold_leaf , that can be seen holding a trumpet atop the Westwood Temple . Over the years , church leaders have set_aside some of Smith ' s teachings , notably polygamy . But many singular features of the Mormon lifestyle remain , providing its believers with more_than enough study , duties and supervision to keep them busy . Singing , socializing and entertainment such_as &quot; road-show &quot; plays put_on by youth groups take the edge off the seriousness of it all . Mormons are expected to donate a tenth of their income to the church , along with the money it would cost to pay_for the two meals they skip every month to help feed the hungry . They also give time and money to support the church ' s building program and welfare system . Mormons wear special undergarments decorated with markings that symbolize a covenant with God . They also follow dietary rules known as the Word of Wisdom , which bans alcohol , coffee , tea and tobacco and urges the consumption of &quot; little meat. &quot; Families gather on Monday nights for a &quot; home evening &quot; devoted to prayer , study and other activities that can range from board_games to night skiing . Classes , worship and meetings can fill_up to 10 hours a week , with volunteer pastors , known as bishops , and higher-ranking church officials putting_in much more time . Devout Mormons pray , study and socialize every Sunday at chapels , or meeting_houses , that are scattered across Southern California . For strictly ritual purposes , such_as marriages , family &quot; sealings &quot; and proxy baptism for the dead , they go_to temples like the one that has been a landmark on Santa Monica Boulevard for 38 years . Only Mormons in good standing may pass beyond the building ' s lobby . The Mormon_church has virtually no professional staff , and the demands on the time of members are often cited by dropouts as the reason for drifting away from the church . Those who stay find it tiring , but comforting . &quot; You ' re going to be growing yourself and putting these principles into action , so I always say yes , &quot; said Jeanine Bentz , 30 , of Santa Monica , a former radar engineer and mother of three who advises the young_women ' s group in her local ward . &quot; It ' s hard , but I say yes. &quot; &quot; It ' s a stretch for us but we look_out for each other , &quot; said her husband , Scott , who runs a copying and subpoena service . &quot; that ' s why Monday night is a dead night . Nobody calls because nobody wants to interrupt the Family Home Evening. &quot; The Bentzes , both born to Mormon families , belong_to a ward in the church ' s Santa Monica Stake , which covers most of the area west of the 405 Freeway . A stake is a regional unit like a diocese in the Catholic_Church . According its president , Robert E . Hedrick , the Santa Monica Stake is not growing as fast as others in areas where houses and apartments don ' t cost as much . &quot; Mainly what we have are longtime people who ' ve put a lot of time into the community , &quot; said Hedrick , 59 , who converted as a teen-ager , largely out of admiration for the hard work of one of his predecessors as stake president , the father of two childhood chums . It is elsewhere on the Westside -- in the Los Angeles Stake , the oldest in California , which extends through Latino and Asian areas to Downtown , and in the Westchester-based Inglewood Stake , which stretches down to the South Bay -- that changes in the church can best be seen . For James Pak , president of a Korean-speaking branch of the Los Angeles Stake , it was the force of his brother ' s clean living , and his family ' s lack of commitment to its ancient faith , that brought him to the church . &quot; We called ourselves Buddhists , but there was no sense of belonging , &quot; said Pak , 43 , of his family in the Korean city of Kwang-ju . When his older brother converted after meeting Mormon missionaries at the University of Seoul , he was quick to do the same . &quot; He set a good_example . He was respected by many , &quot; Pak said . &quot; He brought pride to the family. &quot; Now an accountant living_in La Crescenta , where there is a Mormon chapel within a three-minute drive of his house , Pak makes the 40-minute trip to Koreatown a_few times a week . There , he runs the affairs of the Korean branch and looks_out for the spiritual and temporal welfare of its members . &quot; There ' s a need for my service , &quot; he said . * Mormons are generally required to join the ward where they live , but exceptions are made_for immigrants to study and socialize in their native language . &quot; We had no choice but to accommodate that need , &quot; said Howard B . Anderson , president of the Los Angeles Stake . &quot; In many ways this helps strengthen ( immigrant converts ) and provide acculturization in a way that ' s comfortable to them. &quot; Many families switch to their local wards when their children become teen-agers and want to socialize with their high_school friends , said Titus K . May , Inglewood Stake president . May , 57 , who traces his roots to Hawaiian and Napoleonic royalty , presides over English-speaking as well as Tongan wards , where some men come_to meetings in their native garb of long robes and straw belts . His middle name , Kealiihoolulaauopuowaina , means king who made plants flourish at Opuowaina , a place on the island of Hawaii . The attitude among his parishioners is not a divisive &quot; us versus them , but , ' What can we do to help ? ' &quot; said May , a security officer at Northrop . Still , he said , he vetoed a proposal to take_in a Samoan-dominated ward from the Carson area as part of a recent restructuring . &quot; The Samoans and the Tongans , they ' ve got a little thing going_on , going_back to the island times , &quot; he laughed . Most of the Tongans converted on their home island , where more_than half the population is Mormon , said David Latu , 46 , a building contractor who is a leader of a Tongan-speaking ward based in Westchester . &quot; I met a girl and she was Mormon , &quot; he said , &quot; and when I saw the example they set and the principles they teach , it amazed me . So I thought it would n ' t hurt if I tried to become a Mormon. &quot; He said the church ' s emphasis on education causes many members to follow friends and relatives to better opportunities on the mainland . For many new converts , especially Latinos who grew_up as Catholics or Pentecostalists , one attraction is the opportunity to baptize their children or their spouses themselves , and to practice the healing rite of the laying on of hands , said Keith J . Atkinson , a church spokesman who served as a missionary in Mexico . &quot; Not to be critical of the Catholic_Church , but some of our Hispanic friends indicate that kind of empowerment , for them to be able to do those things themselves instead of going_to the priest or minister to do_it , is something they found very attractive , &quot; he said . * Bobby Herrera , a 19-year-old missionary from Boston , said that empowerment made a difference for his parents , natives of El_Salvador , when they converted after moving to Massachusetts . He was baptized at his father ' s hands . &quot; I see a big difference between them and others in the family , &quot; he said . &quot; My dad ' s really dedicated . He drank and smoked before , and now he ' s completely left it. &quot; Herrera is attending church at the Wilshire Ward with other young people who devote up_to two years after high_school to preaching the gospel wherever the church may send them . Although they still knock_on doors in the time-honored way , they spend most of their time talking to potential converts referred by new members or attracted by radio and TV ads . With 200 envoys working in the Los Angeles area , they record about 1 # 300 baptisms a year . &quot; We ' ve had a good response in the month after the earthquake , &quot; said Bart Peterson , a newly arrived missionary from Star Valley , Wyo . &quot; People seem to be so humble that they ' re willing to listen. &quot;</TEXT>
