   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : MAKING A DIFFERENCE ; ONE OBSERVATORY ' S APPROACH : ' STAR PARTIES ' FOR EVERYDAY PEOPLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 1.8 million people each year relieve their earthbound routine with a visit to Los Angeles ' Griffith Observatory . A handful of scientists , trained guides and volunteers ensure that thousands who aren ' t likely to get_to the observatory still have a chance to see something of the heavens from their own neighborhoods . For more_than 50 years Griffth Observatory astronomers and trained guides have been bringing portable telescopes to schools , libraries , parks and recreational centers to introduce stargazing to people throughout Los Angeles . With volunteers from local astronomy clubs supplementing the observatory ' s outreach efforts more_than 20 # 000 people in Los Angeles and Orange counties look through traveling telescopes each year . Scores of people gather outdoors for &quot; star parties &quot; around the region to peer through telescopes while guides direct them to objects in the sky . But those who offer their equipment and expertise to provide access to sights millions of miles away sometimes pay a price . Recently , nearly $ 3 # 000 in telescope accessories collected for more_than 20 years was stolen from one volunteer while he helped conduct a star party near a downtown Los Angeles library branch . WHY LOOK TO THE SKIES ? Anthony Cook Griffith Observatory ' s Astronomical Observer All of us can learn about a different way of looking_at where we are in the universe when we look_into the sky . We can learn how we ' re connected by seeing what makes_it real that we ' re all a part of the Milky Way . The traveling telescope removes astronomy and the study of the universe from being an academic and remote topic . We show people the excitement in the images of astronomy by presenting them directly . I don ' t want to sound hackneyed about encouraging a sense of wonder about the skies , but often our immediate environment in the city can be depressing . We forget or don ' t realize that we ' re surrounded by incredible things that we can experience with our own eyes , like constellations and most of the planets . The traveling telescope is not only for children , but for everyone and especially for those who can ' t make_it up_to the observatory -- seniors and those who might not have transportation to visit us . I ' ve seen people who speak all different languages , who come from different cultural backgrounds and I ' ve seen homeless people get_into serious discussions about the sky . Seeing the moon ' s surface , the rings of Saturn removes believing_in their existence from being dependent upon someone else ' s authority . You can verify it and test that truth yourself . We try to make that science real , to animate its process and to remove it from the idea that it ' s abstract drudgery . ONE NIGHT OF SIGHTS FROM THE SIDEWALK On cloudless nights with a little astronomical knowledge and no more_than a pair of binoculars Southern Californians can spot plenty in the sky even through an atmosphere fouled by urban light and smog . This year the Griffith Observatory will celebrate Astronomy day April 16 from 1:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. Observatory guides will conduct special telescope tours ; astronomy clubs will set_up additional telescopes on the observatory lawn for guests to look through . With binoculars , sidewalk astronomers throughout Southern California can spot : Craters on the moon , 238 # 000 miles from Earth Phases of Venus , 144 million miles from Earth Moons of Jupiter , 414 million miles from Earth Orion Nebula , gaseous star cloud 1 # 600 light_years from Earth Comet McNaught-Russell , 84 million miles from Earth TO GET INVOLVED For information about donations and volunteer opportunities at the Los Angeles Observatory , call Friends of the Observatory , ( 310 ) 559-9707 .
