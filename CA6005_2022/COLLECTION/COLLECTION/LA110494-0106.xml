   <HEADLINE> YOUR WHEELS : THE GOODS ; YOUR CAR IS A LOT SAFER IN L.A. THAN YOU THINK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One night your neighbor ' s car is stolen from the street . Every news_report about a carjacking reinforces your presumption that car theft is out of control in Los Angeles . But national statistics tell a far different story . Los Angeles has among the lowest auto theft rates of any American urban_area . You have a higher risk of having your late-model car stolen in Chicago , Miami , Houston , Philadelphia and New York . All those Southlanders moving to Denver for the quality_of_life there -- they can deal with a higher theft rate as well . San Francisco motorists lose their cars twice as often as people in Los Angeles . In Detroit the chances of a theft are three times higher than in Los Angeles . And even Portland and Indianapolis have a higher auto theft rate , despite their safe , small-city images . The statistics were compiled recently by the Highway Loss Data Institute , an insurance industry association . The study covers the period from October , 1990 , to May , 1994 , and ranks theft losses of 1991 to 1993 model-year cars in 30 major cities . Losses in those urban regions account_for the vast majority of car thefts in the nation . The worst city in terms of theft-claim frequency was Detroit , with a rate of 29.6 stolen vehicles for every 1 # 000 cars insured over a one-year period . The lowest ranking city was Cincinnati with a rate of 5.6. Los Angeles County ' s rate was 9.7 and the four-county region outside Los Angeles was a close 8.5. The combined metro rate for Southern California ' s five counties was 9.1. It is not clear why Los Angeles has a lower rate than many smaller cities , despite the widespread perception that it is rife_with every type of crime , says Kim Hazelbaker , senior_vice_president of the data institute . City theft rates vary widely , often for no apparent reason . In general , coastal cities and border cities tend to have a higher theft rate , related to the trade_in exporting stolen vehicles . When the theft rates are ranked by the dollar loss rather than frequency of claims , the ranking of cities changes and Los Angeles looks somewhat worse . On average , Los Angeles has a loss rate of $ 57 per insured vehicle , compared to the higher rates of $ 248 in New York , $ 82 in Miami and $ 74 in San Francisco . But Los Angeles was higher than Chicago with $ 28 , Denver with $ 21 and Houston with $ 55 . Hazelbaker says international events can trigger changes in theft losses . When the Berlin Wall fell , there was an explosive trade_in vehicles stolen in the United States to meet demand in former communist countries . While that problem has slacked_off , the economic boom in China has created a huge market for stolen luxury cars . Because of stolen vehicle exports , recoveries are going_down . But overall theft rates are going_down as well , thanks to vastly improved vehicle security_systems installed by manufacturers . In 1979 , the national theft frequency was 20.4 claims for every 1 # 000 vehicles , compared to 5.1 claims for the 1993 model year cars . But the average loss has gone from $ 800 in 1979 to $ 4 # 000 in 1993 . The drop_in frequency and the rise in loss have almost exactly offset each other and the portion of auto insurance_premiums going_to theft has remain almost constant . So , lock your car and relax a little bit .</TEXT>
