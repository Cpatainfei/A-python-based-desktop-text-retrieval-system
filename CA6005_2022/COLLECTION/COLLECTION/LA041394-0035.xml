   <TEXT> This summer , Hollywood ' s big commercial movies will have to share more of their multiplex turf . Of course , it won ' t exactly be a case of &quot; Move_over , Arnold , &quot; or &quot; Step aside , Harrison. &quot; But , Hollywood ' s independent movie distributors , which have tended to concede the summer playing time to the major studios , are no longer content to sit_out the lucrative season . These companies are becoming increasingly aggressive about booking their product alongside the big guns . So , come summer , playing_at your neighborhood theater along with such films as Universal Pictures ' &quot; The Flintstones , &quot; Walt Disney ' s animated &quot; The Lion King &quot; or 20th Century Fox ' s &quot; True Lies &quot; starring Arnold Schwarzenegger will be such titles as New Line Cinema ' s &quot; The Mask , &quot; IRS Media ' s &quot; The Beans of Egypt , Maine &quot; and Sony Pictures Classics ' &quot; Mi Vida Loca. &quot; &quot; Beans &quot; and &quot; Mi Vida &quot; are very personalized dramas dealing with human themes . &quot; The Mask &quot; is a big , special-effects film headlined by &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective &quot; star Jim Carrey . But all three are from the smaller , maverick film companies that usually shy_away_from the hotly competitive summer . However , over the last few summers , these smaller distributors have increasingly tried to capture a share of the high-volume ticket buying action that accounts_for roughly 40 % of the entire year ' s box-office sales . This summer the numbers tell the story . There are roughly 60 films scheduled for release between the week before the Memorial_Day holiday weekend in May and Labor_Day weekend in September . And about 15 of those are what can be considered major releases from the independent companies . &quot; There is a movement going_on , &quot; acknowledges Harvey Weinstein , co-chairman of Miramax Films , which found a summertime gold mine in such pictures as &quot; Enchanted April &quot; and the Spanish-language &quot; Like Water for Chocolate. &quot; * For Weinstein , the reason for the success of such films is simple : &quot; How many times can people go_to see ' Terminator 75 , ' ' The Fugitive 8 ' or ' Jaws ' ? &quot; he asks . And the lines of what distinguishes a major from a smaller company are continuing to blur -- especially when a studio like Paramount Pictures releases an intimate and off-beat film like &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; due out this June starring Tom Hanks , or a &quot; small &quot; company like New Line releases &quot; The Mask , &quot; which boasts millions of dollars of special_effects from George Lucas ' outfit Industrial Light &amp; Magic and stars the new popcorn hero Carrey . The line becomes even fuzzier when one considers that some &quot; independents &quot; are now owned by the major studios . Miramax ' s parent is the Walt Disney Co. ; New Line was recently acquired by media mogul Ted Turner ; and Gramercy Pictures , which is releasing the currently popular &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral , &quot; is a co-venture of Universal Pictures and Polygram . Savoy Pictures , which is revving_up to release around 12 major titles a year but only has one film scheduled for this summer ( &quot; Exit to Eden &quot; ) , declined to participate in this article because its founders , a group of veteran Hollywood executives , consider the 2-year-old company to be a major studio in the making . Miramax was one of the first firms to crack the major studio monopoly of summer with its 1989 release &quot; sex , lies , and videotape , &quot; a film the company picked_up for distribution when it won the grand prize at the Cannes Film Festival in May and rushed into theaters by mid-summer . &quot; We ' ve educated the theater exhibitors that they don ' t have to play the same old movies . There is room for counter-programming , &quot; Weinstein said . In the case of &quot; Like Water for Chocolate , &quot; explained Weinstein , &quot; Our big break came Memorial_Day weekend ( 1993 ) when we opened in 180 theaters ( opposite such studio releases as &quot; Sliver , &quot; &quot; Hot Shots ! Part Deux , &quot; &quot; Cliffhanger &quot; and &quot; Made in America &quot; ) and we played all summer . We proved it could be done . Goldwyn ( the Samuel Goldwyn Co. ) used the same strategy last summer with ' Much Ado About Nothing ' and had fantastic results. &quot; Some say the pioneering effort was in 1985 , when Embassy Pictures managed to book Ingmar Bergman ' s critically acclaimed &quot; Fanny and Alexander , &quot; subtitles and all , into theaters . One of the earliest proponents of counter-programming the summer season was L.A.-based , Goldwyn Co.-owned Landmark Theatre Corp. , which has 121 screens in several states and primarily exhibits specialized films . Said Landmark co-founder Gary Meyer : &quot; We ' ve been harping on this for years . We ' re thrilled that the independents are learning that lesson . For us , it ' s a matter of survival . We operate 52 weeks a year . Besides , sophisticated people don ' t leave the planet during the summer . . . . They ' re looking_for movies to go to. &quot; But , Meyer cautioned that the specialized movies that do better in summer are ones with lighter topics . Not everyone is as optimistic about the realistic opportunities for some of the specialized films . A variety of major theater chain operators see the logjam of major studio titles still putting a squeeze on the smaller movies . &quot; This is going_to be one heck of a summer at the box_office , &quot; said Michael Patrick , chairman of the 2 # 100-screen , multi-state Carmike Cinemas , now the nation ' s second-biggest circuit . &quot; Every summer , the_indies try to get their pictures ' opening dates set . But I don ' t think this year will be any different , because , come June 24 ( the day Disney expands the run of &quot; The Lion King &quot; ) , the major pictures will begin colliding and there won ' t be enough theaters . It will be extremely hard for independent films to compete. &quot; That point isn ' t lost on New Line ' s theatrical marketing president Chris Pula . &quot; Whenever you ' re situated in the summer with the high-concept movies like ' The Flintstones , ' ' Maverick ' and ' True Lies , ' you have to come_in with something different . We think in the case of ' The Mask ' we do. &quot; Samuel Goldwyn Co . production President Tom Rothman notes , &quot; This is a trend that has been creeping forward . Three and four years ago we would see these films squeezed into August , &quot; long considered the dog days of the movie business . In 1990 , Goldwyn ' s &quot; Longtime Companion , &quot; one of the first feature_films about the human effects of AIDS , was one example . &quot; But now , we ' re going to be right in the teeth of summer . We were there with ' Much Ado , ' right opposite ' Jurassic Park. ' And , lo and behold , the specialized film audience isn ' t going away. &quot;</TEXT>
