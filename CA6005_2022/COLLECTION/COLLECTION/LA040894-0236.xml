   <HEADLINE> RABBI IS CONVICTED OF MONEY CONSPIRACY ; COURTS : JURY FAILS TO REACH VERDICTS ON COUNTS OF BANK FRAUD AND CHARGES THAT ABRAHAM LOW ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN THE LAUNDERING OF CASH , AS DISTINCT FROM CONSPIRING TO DO SO . IT WAS HIS SECOND TRIAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Los Angeles federal_court jury on Thursday convicted an Orthodox rabbi of conspiracy to launder drug money . The jury deliberated more_than a week before finding Abraham Low , rabbi at Mogen Abraham , an Orthodox Jewish synagogue on La Brea Avenue , guilty of one felony charge . The jurors were unable to reach unanimous verdicts on two other money-laundering charges and six bank-fraud charges . It was the second trial for Low . Last year , a different jury failed to reach a verdict on any of the charges against the 43-year-old rabbi after deliberating for 25 days . Low ' s attorney , Thomas J . Nolan , said his client was disappointed at the conviction and planned to ask U.S. District Judge Robert M . Takasugi for a new trial . If the request is denied , Low will appeal the verdict , Nolan said . Takasugi scheduled a May 9 hearing for post-trial motions and to ascertain whether the government will seek to retry Low on any of the charges on which the jury failed to reach a verdict . During the latest trial , the government presented video and audio tapes of meetings between Low and an undercover FBI_agent posing as a drug dealer who wanted the rabbi to launder money for him . Prosecutors said the tape showed Low ' s financial acumen and his desire to engage in profitable , illegal activities . Assistant U.S. Atty . Leslie A . Swain said Low met five times with the undercover_agent . The agent said Low told him how he could set_up a long-term money-laundering operation and transfer the illicit drug money through diamond dealers and through charity-related bank_accounts in Europe . The agent said Low told him he could launder up_to $ 5 million a week . The jury , while favoring guilt by a 10-2 vote , was unable to reach unanimous verdicts on two charges that Low actually engaged in money_laundering , as distinct from conspiring to do_it . The jury was evenly divided on charges that Low defrauded Home Savings of America when he deposited a $ 496 # 000 Bank of America cashier ' s check that turned_out to be stolen and forged . Low , financial consultant Alan Weston , 50 , of Hollywood and Sharlesseta Brown of Lomita were indicted in January , 1993 . Weston pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge and testified against Low . Brown pleaded guilty to related charges on Wednesday , Swain said . The maximum penalty under federal law for conspiracy is a five-year prison_term and a $ 250 # 000 fine .</TEXT>
