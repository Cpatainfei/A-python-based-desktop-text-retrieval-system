   <HEADLINE> 7.2 QUAKE OFF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST CAUSES NO MAJOR DAMAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck Thursday off the Humboldt County coast in a seismically active area where three tectonic plates converge , but the quake was far enough out_to sea that no major damage and no injuries resulted . The 8:15 a.m. temblor was placed by the U.S. Geological Survey on the Mendocino Fault about 90 miles west-southwest of Eureka . It was felt as a long , gentle rolling motion through much of Northern California and southwestern Oregon . The quake ' s epicenter was under the Pacific , but no tsunami or seismic sea wave_formed because the quake ' s movement was horizontal rather than vertical . In this colorful town of Victorian-style homes and businesses , the quake shook just a_few books from the library shelves , but it did remind uneasy residents of their recent earthquake history , which included a magnitude 7.1 temblor two years ago . That large quake in 1992 and its aftershocks damaged 300 homes , injured 356 people and caused $ 50 million in damage . Thursday ' s quake was further offshore and , aside from knocking one house off its foundation in the town of Fortuna , barely disturbed area residents . &quot; It was not like the last ones , &quot; said Frank Mathes , Ferndale ' s public works director . &quot; This was just a big roller . There was no damage of any kind , anywhere . It ' s amazing considering the magnitude . . . . People are astounded to hear the magnitude. &quot; Stanford_University scientists recently estimated that if a similar but slightly smaller quake struck along the Newport-Inglewood fault in urban Los Angeles , it would do $ 125 billion to $ 145 billion in damage . But this area of California ' s North Coast is sparsely populated except for scattered towns such_as Ferndale and Eureka , about 20 miles north . The quake Thursday was the second strongest to hit in or close to California in the 1990s , eclipsed only by the June 28 , 1992 , quake centered in the Mojave_Desert near Landers that was magnitude 7.3. The latest quake was the fourth of magnitude 7 or greater in the last five years . Thursday ' s quake occurred close to the &quot; triple junction &quot; of the North_American , Pacific and Gorda tectonic plates and not far from the potentially deadly Cascadia subduction zone , where scientists have warned that a gigantic quake could devastate the Northwest coast . Tectonic plates are large land masses that float on the molten core of the Earth . The areas where they meet are often associated with volcanic and earthquake activity . A subduction zone is a place where one plate pushes under another . Lori Dengler , a seismologist at Humboldt State University , said the Mendocino Fault , on which Thursday ' s quake occurred , forms the boundary between the Gorda and Pacific plates . Although a different fault was involved in the 1992 quakes , she thinks that it was close enough so that the temblor may have been a response to the 1992 quakes . She said she did not think that Thursday ' s quake indicated that the feared Cascadia subduction zone quake would happen soon . Bill Ellsworth of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park , Calif. , said the quake ruptured a segment of the Mendocino fault that was between two segments that ruptured in 1954 and 1984 . The type of rupture , Ellsworth said , was similar , on a much smaller scale , to that of the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 . But since the segments on either side had ruptured fairly recently , he shared Dengler ' s view that no larger earthquake is imminent . Paddock reported from Ferndale and Reich reported from Los Angeles . Coastal Earthquake A magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck in Northern California Thursday morning . It was centered in the ocean about 90 miles west-southwest of Eureka .</TEXT>
