   <HEADLINE> VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW : TOLD CENTER REPORTS VACANCIES ARE DOWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Things are looking_up at TOLD Center , a part of Oxnard ' s Channel Islands Business Center that was taken_over by the developer ' s lender , Wells Fargo Bank . Wells Fargo had taken possession of 25 of Channel Islands ' 56 buildings when the development ran_into financial problems . TOLD Center , consisting_of 12 multi-tenant industrial buildings , was in turn purchased from a Wells Fargo subsidiary in May , 1993 , by R &amp; E Pacific Development , a family-owned partnership . At that time , 47 of TOLD Center ' s 102 units were vacant , reports Liz Ricci , R &amp; E ' s managing partner . Today , vacancies in the center_on Pacific Avenue are down to 23 . New tenants include machine_shops , woodworking shops and Scully Enterprises Inc. , a sportswear concern , which has expanded beyond twin office_buildings that it purchased elsewhere in the Channel Islands project . &quot; We ' ve been helped by the improving economy , &quot; Ricci said , &quot; but I think we ' ve made progress mostly because we go_out of our way to ' stroke ' our tenants . If something needs to be fixed or cleaned , we get_it done immediately. &quot; And , the economic recovery notwithstanding , R &amp; E still offers new tenants free rent for the sixth and 12th months .</TEXT>
