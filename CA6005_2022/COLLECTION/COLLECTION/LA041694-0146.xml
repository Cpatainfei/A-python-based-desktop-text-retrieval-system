   <HEADLINE> WILDLIFE WATER_TANK VANDALIZED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> High above Simi Valley on Rocky Peak , two members of Quail Unlimited surveyed the damage to their latest project , a 1 # 000-gallon water_tank for wildlife . Part of the tank they installed in February was vandalized during the past week . Most of the water dribbled into the surrounding hillside . Mike Taylor , county chairman of the group , held the lid to the drink box , a metal container where larger animals get water , and looked down at its severed hinges . &quot; They just broke it off , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s just no reason . Seems like they were just doing_it to be spiteful. &quot; Quail Unlimited , a group of hunters and conservationists , has built a dozen of these ingenious drinking_fountains around the county , most of them in Los Padres National Forest . This is the first time members have seen such destructive vandalism at one of their projects . The tank is made from the same simple design that ranchers and farmers have been using for the past century . Called guzzlers , they are commonly built_in dry areas to benefit wildlife . A hole is dug , and wooden forms are placed inside to shape the sides and barrel-vaulted top . Then cement is poured in to create the underground tank . One side slants up , so animals can walk down into the tank to drink . Providing water sources for wildlife is the top priority for Quail Unlimited , a national organization with more_than 100 members in its Ventura County chapter . As an environmental group , Quail Unlimited has rather unlikely origins . It was formed by hunters to preserve the habitat of the small birds that hunters pursue with dogs and guns . Membership -- 99 % male in Ventura County -- tends to grow in leaps and bounds after each local gun show . Few of its members find anything incongruous about the idea of hunters building drinking_fountains for wildlife . They seem drawn to Quail Unlimited largely as a way to get outside and hang_out with the guys while making life a little easier for the animals . Ventura resident Bill Ingenito has been with the group three years , though he has hunted since childhood . &quot; The first project I went_up on , I just thought it was kind of nice to be out there doing something constructive instead of shooting the place up , &quot; he said . New recruit Ray Pomada , also of Ventura , learned about the group at a recent gun show . He described himself as a hunter , but not &quot; an avid hunter. &quot; His reason for joining was simple . &quot; I like to take_care of the birds , &quot; Pomada said with a shrug . &quot; I do_it for the birds. &quot; Chairman Taylor has hunted only once in the past 20 years . &quot; I ' m in this because I ' m an environmentalist , &quot; Taylor said . &quot; If you want to put something back into the environment , this is the only group around here that specializes in restoring habitat. &quot; At monthly membership meetings , the focus is usually on guzzlers ; where to put them and how to maintain existing ones . Using annual dues , grants and matching funds from the U . S . Forest Service , the group can afford to install about three guzzlers a year . They work closely with park rangers to choose locations . George Garcia , a biologist with the Ojai Ranger District , said the group ' s assistance has become critical as budget_cuts hit the Forest Service . &quot; I think it ' s a pretty valuable piece of labor that they provide us with , &quot; he said . &quot; They spend their entire Saturdays sometimes helping me out . They ' re out_to help quail , but the work they do benefits all wildlife , maybe even the bigger species more_than the birds. &quot; Guzzlers are particularly important in water-scarce Southern California , Garcia said . Since so_much of Ventura County flatlands -- where streams and creeks run -- have been settled , the wildlife that retreats to the_hills often has to look hard for water sources . The project in Simi Valley is not within Forest Service jurisdiction , so Quail Unlimited won ' t get matching funds for it . Total costs for putting_in a guzzler are usually about $ 2 # 000 . After ripping_off the lid , someone filled the drink box with rocks , causing the water to overflow , and destroying the valve that leads to the main tank of the guzzler . Normally the valve serves as a slow stopper , allowing levels to rise slowly as animals drink from the box . Without it , all_the water from the main tank drains out . The damage could cost as much as $ 600 to fix . That cost includes driving_in a water truck to refill the tank , which upsets both Mike Taylor and Eric Taylor , the group ' s unrelated conservation committee chairman . They were careful to bring the heavy truck in during February , so the grasses and plants they disturbed would have time to recover before the heat of summer . &quot; Now we ' re going to have to drive through the meadow again it ' ll probably be trashed for a year , &quot; Eric Taylor said . By next year , assuming there is no drought , the tank will refill itself with rainwater . Most of the dozen guzzlers installed by Quail Unlimited are in spots inaccessible to people . They don ' t like to advertise the spots for fear that people they call &quot; slob-hunters &quot; will come and take_advantage of easy prey . No hunting is allowed on Rocky Peak , but the Rocky Peak site is well-traveled by hikers and bikers . It was selected largely to promote gene mixing between the animals that live_on either side of the Simi Valley Freeway . A tunnel under the freeway , built for sheep , allows animals to get_through . A new water source on the other side should encourage healthy mixing . But there was another reason for choosing the Simi Valley spot : so people as well as animals could enjoy it , giving residents a chance to view deer , coyotes , birds and other wildlife as they drink from the tank . It is an experiment the group might not be able to repeat . &quot; If it ' s accessible , they ' ll screw it up , &quot; said Ingenito , shaking his head . FYI Quail Unlimited welcomes anyone interested in attending their meetings , which are held_on the second Monday of each month . Meetings begin at 7:30 p.m. in the office of the Ventura County superintendent of schools , 5189 Verdugo Way , Camarillo . For information , call Mike Taylor at 482-5177 .</TEXT>
