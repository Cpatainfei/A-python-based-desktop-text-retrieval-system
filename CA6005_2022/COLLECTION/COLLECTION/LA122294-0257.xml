   <HEADLINE> 3 ON O.C. BOARD INDICATE RAABE IS_ON WAY_OUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Less than three weeks after Matthew Raabe took_control of the embattled Orange County treasurer ' s office , a majority of the Board of Supervisors -- which pressured Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron to resign -- said Wednesday that it ' s time for acting Treasurer Raabe to go too . Raabe , Citron ' s chosen heir_apparent , was initially hailed for alerting the county to problems with the fund in early November . But county supervisors said Wednesday that they could not ignore reports that Raabe continued to aggressively reassure other governmental investors -- even as the fund lurched toward collapse in October -- of the investment pool ' s ability to cover any potential losses . &quot; We need to restore credibility to the office , &quot; said Supervisor Roger R . Stanton . Supervisors Stanton and William G . Steiner said Wednesday that they favor installing as interim treasurer Thomas E . Daxon , the former Oklahoma auditor who was brought_in Dec . 12 as a special consultant to the treasurer ' s office . &quot; There is such a cloud_over the treasurer ' s office , &quot; Steiner said . &quot; It ' s time to appoint Daxon. &quot; Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez , who becomes chairman_of_the_Board of Supervisors in January , said that while Raabe currently serves as an important &quot; link &quot; in unraveling Citron ' s investments , he most likely will not be part of a post-bankruptcy treasurer ' s office . &quot; A change will occur , &quot; said Vasquez , who declined to elaborate . Depending_upon the outcome of ongoing investigations of both Raabe and Citron by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Orange County district_attorney ' s office , supervisors are considering everything from Raabe ' s reassignment to complete removal . Vasquez said a decision about a leadership transition in the office will occur &quot; in a matter of days. &quot; While it remains unclear whether Raabe had a hand in devising the risky investment strategies that torpedoed the multibillion-dollar fund , interviews and documents indicate that he was a devoted disciple of Citron , fervently preaching the reclusive treasurer ' s investment gospel to the fund ' s inglorious end . For 10 months this year , while interest_rates rose five times and the treasurer ' s office relied increasingly on a stepped-up series of borrowings for cash , Raabe , 38 , crisscrossed the state , reassuring gatherings of city treasurers and other participants in the investment pool that the fund was sound . In April , after the Federal_Reserve_Board had increased interest_rates three times for a total of three-quarters of a percent , Raabe personally sold skittish Newport-Mesa Unified School District officials on the idea of rolling_over a $ 47-million loan they had taken_out to invest more heavily in the fund . And at several meetings of public finance officers and treasurers -- including one in mid-October -- Raabe dismissed questions about the fund ' s risks , saying the county had $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion in &quot; overnight money &quot; to be used in case an interest-sensitive investment went awry , or investors in short-term county bonds or notes demanded their money back . &quot; You never , ever got a sense that they weren ' t confident , &quot; said Howard Longballa , the Placentia finance director . Raabe &quot; said , ' Yes , the pool has exposure if interest_rates rise , ' but that ( the county ) always kept liquid just for that reason . He said they had a_billion set aside. &quot; Raabe , who is under scrutiny for possibly misrepresenting the fund ' s solvency to investors , would not comment Wednesday on a possible shake-up in his office . But , in his first public comments about his involvement in formulating and carrying_out the county ' s failed investment strategy , he said Citron made all such decisions alone , and that he had virtually no input into the process . &quot; It would be fair to say that anywhere I went I was explaining what Mr. Citron ' s investment strategy was , &quot; Raabe said . &quot; I never had anything to do with devising investment strategy. &quot; But investors argue that if Raabe wasn ' t designing the car , he was smoothly selling it -- and neglecting to tell them that this year ' s version could turn_out to be a lemon . &quot; I do not believe he was just a lieutenant responding on the directions of the captain , &quot; said Edward H . Decker , a Newport-Mesa school_board member who met with Raabe in April . &quot; I came_away with the feeling that he was as much a part of the scheme or proposal as his boss was. &quot; Raabe was certainly Citron ' s chosen successor in the eyes of many county officials . He joined the auditor-controller ' s office 10 years ago , but switched to the treasurer ' s office in 1987 because there was a greater opportunity for advancement , his friends said . When Citron ' s longtime deputy Ray Wells retired , Raabe , who had earned his certified_public_accountant certificate , became the assistant treasurer in 1993 . Steiner said he remembered asking County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider last spring if there were plans for succession in Citron ' s office , which he considered &quot; a one-man show. &quot; Steiner said he was led to believe Raabe was being groomed for the job . &quot; He was the heir_apparent , &quot; Steiner said . In a Sept . 14 , 1993 , memo to the supervisors accompanying his financial report , Citron himself devotes half a page to praise of Raabe , who is &quot; directly involved in the day-to-day operation of the Treasury. &quot; Citron wrote that Raabe &quot; is involved or aware of the daily decisions being made . He is responsible_for implementing investment decisions . . . . I thought you would be interested in knowing that there is in the county treasury a person such_as Mr. Raabe who can actively manage and operate the county treasury. &quot; Raabe also served as Citron ' s front_man . Calls to Citron were invariably answered by Raabe . Citron signed most requests to county supervisors to issue notes , but Raabe was the person the supervisors were asked to contact if they had any questions . And while Citron was an awkward speaker , who stuttered when he got nervous , Raabe could smoothly explain the Orange County investment way to groups of county and municipal treasurers . &quot; You didn ' t get_to talk to Citron . Citron is the mountain , &quot; said one investment_banker , who asked that his name not be used . &quot; The oracle is Matt Raabe. &quot; City and county treasurers and finance directors say Raabe ' s attitude about the investment fund strategies was one of &quot; don ' t try this at_home , kids . Leave it to the professionals. &quot; Raabe really seemed to click into high_gear , they said , after Citron ' s hotly contested election campaign this year , when opponent John M.W. Moorlach said the value of the pool had already dropped from $ 7.5 billion to $ 6.3 billion . &quot; There was a sense of urgency , &quot; Newport-Mesa ' s Decker remembered . &quot; He wanted to make_sure he delivered the party_line and we rolled_over our $ 47 million. &quot; The previous June , Raabe had helped sell Newport-Mesa and three other school districts on joining forces to issue $ 200 million in one-year bonds to raise cash to increase their investments in the fund , and to offer an identical $ 200-million issue the following year for the same purpose . A letter to each of the districts assured them : &quot; You will not . . . have risk of any market loss. &quot; When the first bonds were about to be redeemed , and Raabe was selling them on the second issue , Newport-Mesa officials began raising questions about the safety of their investment . Raabe made the same promise orally , Decker recalled , and pledged to put it in writing as before . But no such written guarantee ever arrived . In a meeting with district officials , Raabe &quot; became rather intense , &quot; Decker said . &quot; I said I didn ' t see how he could guarantee us the money . In order to guarantee us or anyone in the fund , he ' d have to take_away money from someone else . . . . At the time , I think he knew the fund was in trouble. &quot; That same month , Raabe wrote a letter to Peter J . Oeth , general_manager of the Tri-Cities Municipal Water District , describing his office ' s investment strategy : &quot; The pooling of funds allows us to concentrate more monies on these investments while using a shared liquidity of $ 1.5 billion , which is constantly kept available. &quot; Raabe said the treasurer ' s office had &quot; several strategies in mind &quot; should there be an &quot; extremely unlikely &quot; rise in interest_rates that imperiled some investments . &quot; Please be assured , &quot; Raabe wrote , &quot; the investment pool is strong. &quot; Just three months ago , on Sept . 26 , Raabe spoke about investing public funds at the annual California Public Finance Conference in Santa Monica . Orange County had just issued $ 320 million in pension obligation bonds backed solely by the county ' s good name . A large portion of the bonds had interest_rates that changed weekly with prevailing market rates , and allowed bondholders to demand their money back on only seven days ' notice . Raabe told the finance specialists that Orange County had a deserved reputation as an &quot; aggressive &quot; investor but had not crossed the line to become &quot; an overly risky investor. &quot; He is quoted in The Bond Buyer , a trade publication that sponsored the conference , as saying that the county had $ 1 billion in reserve &quot; in case we ' re wrong on some of our investment guesses . . . . &quot; But a little over two months later , that billion-dollar reserve was no place to be found , and Orange County defaulted_on the &quot; seven-day floaters &quot; issued in the pension bond deal . In October , Raabe twice reassured outsiders that the fund could handle any problems , even dropping_in on officials in Mountain View , which had $ 33.9 million invested in the pool . &quot; He said things were fine . Everything was OK , &quot; remembered Patty Kong , the city ' s assistant finance director . But within weeks , Raabe , the fund ' s most visible booster , had turned Citron in . He went_to Auditor-Controller Steve E . Lewis with concerns that Citron continued to take huge investment gambles while the pool teetered on the edge . &quot; He told me directly , and he told Ernie Schneider , that he had confronted Bob Citron about ( certain ) transactions , &quot; Steiner said . &quot; He said he told him to stop this train going_down the track out of control . Stop these transactions . Citron assured him that he would. &quot; Steiner said Raabe came_forward after &quot; documents came_across his desk on the first of November and he saw that Citron was still trading big time. &quot; Steiner said he has mixed feelings about removing Raabe because he &quot; prevented the ultimate meltdown of the fund. &quot; But on the other hand , Steiner said , the soft-spoken accountant also made &quot; a lot of questionable &quot; representations to investors . Raabe won ' t comment on what triggered him to go_to county officials . Right now , he said , he is too busy helping various investigators , accountants and auditors dig through the remains of the pool .
