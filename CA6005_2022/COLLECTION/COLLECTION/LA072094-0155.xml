   <HEADLINE> TRADE TENSIONS SHADOW GORE IN CANADA ; NORTH_AMERICA : VICE_PRESIDENT , OTTAWA OFFICIALS EMPHASIZE FRIENDSHIP IN SPEECHES . BUT DISPUTES OVER FLOW OF GOODS MAY WORSEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Vice_President Al Gore met with Canadian Prime_Minister Jean Chretien and other top officials here Tuesday , emphasizing the strong friendship and economic ties that endure between the two countries despite rising trade tensions . In public remarks , Gore , Chretien and Canadian Deputy Prime_Minister Sheila Copps all stressed the historic amity between the United States and Canada . Gore even recalled that a Canadian neurosurgeon operated_on his son , Albert Gore III , in 1989 , restoring the 6-year-old ' s use of his arm after he had been struck by a car . Private meetings were also described by both sides as cordial . But Canadian officials suggested that Chretien and others made clear their views on the trade irritants , which threaten to worsen in coming months . Gore ' s visit came one day after farm state members of Congress met with President Clinton pressing for U.S. limits on the import of Canadian wheat , which American farmers believe is unfairly subsidized . If the United States acts to cap Canadian wheat imports , Canada is expected to retaliate against American food_products , including California_wine . Negotiators from the two countries also are deadlocked over each country ' s share of the salmon catch in the Pacific Northwest . That impasse threatens to erupt into a &quot; salmon war &quot; in which fishermen from both countries would catch as much as possible , depleting stocks and disrupting conservation efforts . Gore said he hoped the disputes would be resolved amicably , but added , &quot; you can ' t possibly have trade flows as large as the ones between our two countries without having disputes from time to time. &quot; Canada ' s emphasis on the trade snags , considered relatively minor by American officials , underline the peculiar nature of the bilateral relationship , in which a hiccup by the giant to the south can feel_like an earthquake in Canada . Besides the tension over wheat and salmon , there are unresolved disputes over Canadian export of softwood lumber to the U.S. and limited access by American brewers to Canada ' s beer market , among others . While these arguments account_for only a small part of U.S.-Canada trade -- which totaled about $ 250 billion last year and could hit $ 275 billion in 1994 -- they are well-publicized here . That stems in part from the one-sided nature of the relationship -- almost 80 % of Canada ' s trade is with the United States -- and in part from the expectation here that adoption of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement would end such disputes . &quot; When Americans suggest we have a cap on the amount of wheat we can sell to the United States , that doesn ' t sound like the Yankee free_trader we had expected , &quot; Copps said in an interview last week . The announced purpose of the visit by Gore , who was accompanied by his wife , Tipper , was to plan for the Summit of the Americas , scheduled for December in Miami . Canada wants the summit to focus_on economic issues , with an eye toward expansion of membership in NAFTA beyond the United States , Canada and Mexico . There also was discussion of a possible visit to Canada by President Clinton , but no announcement . In the nearly nine months since Chretien ' s Liberal_Party won a landslide election , ending nine years of government by Conservatives Brian Mulroney and Kim Campbell , there have been other disagreements with the United States . The most notable have been over Canada ' s reluctance to back possible military_action to oust the military dictatorship in Haiti and its gentle urging for an end to the U.S.-enforced isolation of Cuba .</TEXT>
