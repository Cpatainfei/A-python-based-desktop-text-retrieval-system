   <HEADLINE> NEW STATUS MIGHT AID PLAYERS ; HOCKEY : THE NHL ' S LABOR DISPUTE COULD OFFICIALLY BECOME A LOCKOUT TODAY , PROMOTING ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wayne Gretzky in_line at the unemployment office ? According to California ' s state unemployment insurance laws , workers who are locked_out by management are eligible to apply for unemployment benefits . Although the NHL has deliberately called its work_stoppage a postponement and has disputed the use of the term &quot; lockout , &quot; the league is expected to concede -- perhaps as soon as on today -- that the 17-day-old stoppage is a lockout . In about 20 states , that means hockey_players would be eligible to file for unemployment benefits . Not that many would take_advantage of that status . But the official declaration of a lockout might give them stronger legal footing if they want to pursue other temporary playing opportunities . &quot; Right now , the whole_thing is based on ( NHL officials ) calling it a postponement , &quot; said Ron Salcer , an agent who is looking_into placing players with European clubs and in the International Hockey_League . &quot; The league ( has maintained ) it will be a full 84-game season . Once you say they ' re locked_out , if you get before a court of law , I think it will be different. &quot; From Oct . 1 , when the season was scheduled to start , NHL officials insisted the stoppage was merely a delay and not a lockout because games would be made_up later and would n ' t be lost . A strange line_of_reasoning , say those familiar_with labor law , and not very strong . It didn ' t matter what the NHL called it , and it didn ' t matter that there are no padlocks on arena doors . From the beginning , it has been , in_effect if not in name , a lockout . &quot; Players are being told they can practice , but the only way they get paid is if there ' s a game , and they ' re not letting them play any games . I ' ve done this for 17 years . that ' s a lockout , &quot; said William S . Waldo , who is a partner in the Los Angeles firm of Paul , Hastings , Janofsky &amp; Walker and represents management in_labor disputes . &quot; By the way , I ' m not saying the management strategy is wrong or ill-conceived . I think it ' s a good strategy that puts maximum pressure on the players. &quot; Said Al Latham , a partner in the same firm and a teacher of labor law at USC : &quot; Legally , a lockout is when the employer does not allow employees to work . There does not have to be a notion that there are literally locks on the gate . . . &quot; You can certainly say it ' s an unusual situation . People talk_about lockouts and strikes , but I ' m unaware of anything in between . The fact that they ' re compensated only for playing and they ' re not being allowed to play when they normally would be allowed to play , it certainly has the features of a lockout , let ' s put it that way . &quot; But if a company says , ' We ' re shutting_down the factory now and we ' ll eventually resume regular hours ( without lost pay ) , is that a lockout ? The concept is different . It doesn ' t quite fit the usual mode . Their argument is , ' we ' ll play the whole season , but we ' re not going_to do_it now. ' . . . It ' s novel. &quot; But now , the NHL ' s last bit of pretense is about to disappear . With its original starting date long past and its second proposed opener wiped_out Saturday because of a bargaining stalemate , games are certain to be lost . Players pledged to play and not strike if the NHL would not lock them out , but the NHL refused to let the season begin . &quot; Once they officially cancel games , a lot of things change , &quot; Salcer said . Players will have more time to pursue other jobs , but only a_few are expected to do so because of insurance concerns . IHL clubs are reluctant to sign high-priced NHL talent , but the Kings ' Marty McSorley is negotiating with the Las Vegas Thunder . Although Rene Fasel , the International Ice_Hockey Federation ' s president , said last week he won ' t let European clubs sign idled NHL players , some say they will do so anyway . However , if the lockout is prolonged , players are expected to say they are being unfairly denied employment and challenge those obstructions . Canceling games will also obligate NHL clubs to refund money to ticket holders . The league , in a memo sent last week , said it will provide refund guidelines by Nov . 1 . By delaying the change in terminology , not only did the NHL allow owners to hold onto that money a while longer , it gave the league a chance to solidify its bargaining stance . The labor lawyers interviewed also say the NHL kept the upper_hand by rejecting the players ' Sept . 29 no-strike pledge . &quot; Generally , you see the traditional lockout where the workers are locked_out of the plant . In effect , from what ' s been said here , they ' re able to come_to the plant but there is no production taking_place and they ' re only paid_for production , &quot; said Linda Deacon , a management-side specialist in_labor law in the Los Angeles office of the St . Louis-based Bryan Cave law_firm . &quot; In effect , ( management is saying ) , ' We ' re not going_to be held hostage by you , you guys are being held hostage by us. ' &quot; Accepting the no-strike pledge , she said , &quot; is not going_to help if what management really needs is concessions . They need to put pressure on the workers. &quot; Waldo agreed that NHL negotiators have devised a solid strategy . &quot; The players have offered status_quo for a year ( with their no-strike pledge ) . Accepting that proposal is totally in the interest of the players and accomplishes nothing , &quot; he said . &quot; My sense , with no inside_information , is they will postpone ( starting the season ) until the players get ready to accept something very similar to what management wants. &quot; As in California , when a work_stoppage in Massachusetts is termed a lockout , workers are eligible to file for unemployment . However , those who file for unemployment in Massachusetts and are offered a job must take that job . Which could lead to some amusing scenarios if members of the Bruins applied for benefits . &quot; So if some guy picks_up your bag at Logan ( Airport ) , &quot; Harry Sinden , the president and general_manager of the Boston Bruins told the Boston Globe , &quot; you might be saying , ' Hi , Cam ( Neely ) . What are you doing here ? ' &quot;</TEXT>
