   <HEADLINE> OC HIGH : STUDENT NEWS &amp; VIEWS ; TERMINAL TEENS ; YOU KNOW THAT OLD JOKE ABOUT KIDS WHO HOG THE PHONE ? WELL , TODAY ' S GREAT COMMUNICATORS ARE PLUGGED INTO A WHOLE NEW WAY TO TAP THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY FROM HOME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the growing number of computers and the services they provide , teens are finding new ways to &quot; talk. &quot; They are getting_together with people they ' ve never met to instantly trade information and find_out what ' s going_on from Arizona to Zaire . Communicating by modem -- transmitting messages and other information over phone_lines from one computer to another -- gets you an acknowledgment and a reply in a single step . Among computer users , the postal mail system is referred to as &quot; snail mail. &quot; Electronic mail , or E-mail , is instantaneous . If your computer has a modem , you can &quot; talk &quot; with other computer users and , with a_few keystrokes , tap into large data bases for up-to-date information . You can also send your own work to another computer instantly . There are four major commercial on-line services : America Online , CompuServe , GEnie and Prodigy . These and other services specialize in certain features , such_as electronic_bulletin_boards , interactive games , news_reports , magazine_articles , stock quotes and more . ImagiNation , for example , is a commercial service featuring on-line , multiplayer games . Access to these and other services costs money -- to subscribe and in monthly connection fees . But they open_doors to new_worlds . These new_worlds are represented through bulletin_boards , and teens are making use of a wide variety of them . There are thousands of bulletin_boards providing millions of files for downloading and conferences -- or forums -- on various topics . It ' s estimated that half the homes_in the United States have a computer . About 4.5 million subscribers are connected to commercial services , and 4 million to 8 million computer users dial up local , non-commercial bulletin_board_systems -- or BBSs . About one in 10 of those users is a teen-ager , according to Boardwatch magazine , a national publication for BBS users . If you have a computer but not a modem , now is the time to get one : Prices have dropped unbelievably , so that a top-of-the-line modem is about $ 100 at outlets such_as Fry ' s and Micro Center . Be sure to get one with a speed of 14 # 400 or greater , because that is becoming the new standard . Once you connect it to your computer , you can dial out and get_in_touch not only with information , but with other people . Here ' s how some of the systems work : Prodigy Prodigy has a reputation for being user friendly and offers a selection of information features such_as News , Weather and Encyclopedia . It emphasizes user communication through message topics and offers file downloading services through a feature called Ziffnet . The main bulletin_board is sub-divided into several smaller ones including Teen , Arts , TV , Music and Video_Games . These mini-bulletin boards have their own sections , subjects and bulletins . For example , to get_to the College topics , you would first go_to the Teen Bulletin_Board and then choose the topic &quot; College. &quot; You would then see the bulletins relating to college such_as &quot; HARVARD IS EASY. &quot; Then again , you could go_to the TV section and message some personalities , including Patrick Stewart and Jay Leno , because the stars frequently answer mail there . Prodigy also has a private mailing system , in which you could send E-mail directly to the person ' s &quot; mailbox. &quot; The company offers a Value Plan for $ 14.95 per month , which includes 30 personal private messages , all_the basic services and two hours of Plus features . The Plus features include using the bulletin_boards . If you exceed the allotted use , you ' ll be charged $ 3.60 per hour . The person who will be responsible_for paying the bill must be over 18 . To join , call ( 800 ) 776-3449 . ImagiNation ImagiNation , formerly The Sierra Network , by Sierra On-Line , is one of my favorites . It has a user base of 40 # 000 . You can chat real-time with other users as opposed to leaving mail . It ' s also one of the most intuitive , because you can actually see the other person ' s portrait ( and design your own ) . ImagiNation is mainly game-oriented , and it does games well . You can invite someone to Mini Golf and take turns as if you were playing_on the green . You can play Red Baron , a flight_simulator , and shoot_down the other person in a dogfight . You can have others join you in the dungeons of a role-playing game . Of course , there are chess , checkers and your standard card_games . ImagiNation is a great way to make friends because of the graphically fun setup . After inviting someone you don ' t know to a friendly game of checkers , chances are that you ' ll discuss something in common and will soon be friends . Of course that someone may be many states away , but not to worry , it ' s a local_call . The start-up kit is $ 5.95 ; the monthly charge in $ 9.95. For use over five hours , the cost is $ 3.50 per hour . To join , call ( 800 ) 462-4461 . ( You can also get access to ImagiNation through a Prodigy service_called Gamepoint , which costs $ 3.60 per hour or a monthly rate of $ 22.95. ) GEnie The General Electric Network for Information Exchange Service is more for the person who wants access to vast databases of information . GEnie offers full text from more_than 900 publications , including newspapers and periodicals . It is not for the casual user because of the high cost of searching for information through the databases . GEnie carries many forums , but its mail service , GE Mail , is difficult to master . If you have to do research and want 400 # 000 people to discuss it with , then GEnie is worth the cost . The monthly charge is $ 8.95. Usage over four hours incurs an additional charge , which varies with the time of connection . Internet If you ' re interested in a more global experience , then Internet is for you . It is a loose connection of computers at thousands of sites around the world where users can share information and files . It is like a really big network without a central authority . Originally intended for research and academic communities , people now join the Internet to search for data and meet other people . Not only does_it contain current usable information , but it also has discussion groups and can reach many universities . It also has Usenet News , the equivalent of bulletin_boards . The problem is that thousands of messages are posted every day , and it ' s tough to just keep_up . The Internet is a global network that gives E-mail connections all_over the world . CompuServe , GEnie , Delphi and America Online all offer Internet access . The cheapest rate for Internet access is at $ 2 an hour plus a $ 3 monthly surcharge by Delphi . To join America Online , call ( 800 ) 827-6364 . To join CompuServe , call ( 800 ) 848-8199 . To join Delphi , call ( 800 ) 695-4005 . Chips + If you prefer , you can access friends and communicate locally . One of the largest bulletin_board_systems in the Orange County area is the Chips + Connection . This BBS has several lines to dial in on . It carries more then 600 conferences on topics from Art to Virtual Reality ; there is even one on Pets . One to check_out would be Teen Issues -- conference No . 671 -- which is reserved for teens to chat about anything and everything . Even though the local BBSs are not as big as the commercial services , they can still &quot; echo &quot; mail back and forth , so eventually you can reach someone as far as the conference goes . Most local BBSs are free , thanks to the contributions of users and the efforts of the BBS system operator . Eventually local BBSs will offer Internet access , opening_up a whole new avenue . You can reach CHIPS + at ( 714 ) 556-3208 by modem . So . . . Communicating by modem is entertaining and fun . Sometimes it ' s an easier place to chat than finding words to say over the phone . It ' s a great place to make new friends who share some of the same interests you do . If you ' re really lucky , you might even meet that special someone and fall_in_love at first byte : - ) .</TEXT>
