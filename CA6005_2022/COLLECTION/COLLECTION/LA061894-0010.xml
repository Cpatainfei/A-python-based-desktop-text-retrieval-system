   <HEADLINE> HIGH_COURT RULES FOR TRUTH IN SENTENCING ; TRIALS : THE JUSTICES OVERTURN A SOUTH CAROLINA MAN ' S DEATH SENTENCE BECAUSE JURORS WERE NOT TOLD THAT HE WAS INELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Supreme Court , insisting on truth in sentencing , ruled Friday that jurors may_not be fooled into thinking that a convicted killer eventually will go free if they do not sentence him to die . The 7-2 decision overturned a South Carolina man ' s death sentence on grounds that prosecutors and the judge had refused to tell the jurors that , regardless of their sentence , the defendant would never again be a free man . The Constitution ' s guarantee of due_process_of_law is violated by the state ' s &quot; refusal to provide the jury with accurate information &quot; about the defendant , wrote Justice Harry A . Blackmun for the court . The ruling may require new sentencing hearings for some Death Row inmates in South Carolina , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Texas , attorneys said . In those states , jurors in death sentencing hearings are not told if the defendant is ineligible for parole . Jurors might choose the death sentence for fear that the convicted killer might otherwise eventually go free and pose a danger to society , defense_lawyers said . The ruling is unlikely to have much impact in California , where , by law , jurors in capital cases are told they must choose either a death sentence or life in prison without parole . The possibility that the defendant will go free is not an issue . Friday ' s ruling in the case ( Simmons vs . South Carolina , 92-9059 ) represented a rare occasion when the Supreme Court has overturned a death sentence . It illustrated how jurors could be confused about the meaning of a simple phrase : &quot; life in prison. &quot; Only 7 % of adults in South Carolina believed that &quot; life in prison &quot; really means that a defendant will stay behind bars until he dies , according to a poll cited in the opinion . The vast majority realize that a defendant given a life term might be paroled later . But many states , as well as federal sentencing guidelines , have abolished parole for some crimes . In those cases , life in prison can mean just that . In the case before the Supreme Court , Jonathan D . Simmons had pleaded guilty in 1990 to two sexual_assaults before being tried_for the murder of an elderly woman . Because he was twice guilty of an assault , he would be kept_in prison for life without parole if he had a third strike on his record , according to South Carolina law . The third strike came_with his murder_conviction . During his sentencing hearing , the prosecutor stressed that Simmons was a &quot; threat . . . in our midst. &quot; His defense_attorney was told he could not tell the jurors that Simmons , if not sentenced to death , would be kept_in prison for life without eligibility for parole . Shortly after beginning deliberations , the jury sent a note to the judge asking if a life sentence would carry with it the possibility of parole . Rather than answering that it would not , the judge replied : &quot; Do not consider parole or parole eligibility. &quot; Twenty-five minutes later , the jury returned a death sentence . In reversing the sentence , the justices agreed that if jurors are told about the defendant ' s &quot; future dangerousness , &quot; they must also be told if he is not eligible for parole . Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented , complaining that the decision opened &quot; another front in the guerrilla war &quot; against the death_penalty . In other rulings , the court : * Insisted that the Federal Communications Commission maintain fixed rates for all long-distance telephone_service ( MCI vs . AT &amp; T , 93-356 ) . In a 5-3 decision , the justices reversed an FCC policy that allowed MCI and other companies to negotiate lower rates while AT &amp; T was required to follow its fixed rates . * Struck down , 7 to 2 , a Massachusetts law that subsidizes milk produced in the state ( West Lynn Creamery vs . Healy , 93-141 ) . The Constitution does not allow a state to protect its product &quot; from the rigors of interstate competition , &quot; the court held .</TEXT>
