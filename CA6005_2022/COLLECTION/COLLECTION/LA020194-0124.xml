   <HEADLINE> PROPERTY VALUES : FORECLOSURE CAN OFTEN RESULT IN COMPLICATED TAX BURDEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite the long slide in local housing prices , one boom market in local real_estate has been foreclosures . Last year a record 3 # 650 single-family houses and condominiums in the Valley were foreclosed , according to TRW-REDI Property Data in Riverside . And that was before last month ' s Northridge earthquake . Given the hefty 10 % deductibles most homeowners face on their earthquake-insurance policies , and because many people now have mortgages bigger than the value of their home , many homeowners figure to walk away from their mortgages and let the property go_into foreclosure . Even for those whose homes escaped damage from the earthquake , the job market remains tough , and layoffs keep mounting , so many people will continue to have problems making their mortgage payment . No matter what the reason , if a home is foreclosed on , that property_owner faces plenty of complicated tax burdens . If your home suffered significant earthquake damage , you may be eligible for special tax_breaks -- although it depends greatly on the tax basis of your house and the size of your adjusted gross income . It will also probably take an accountant to sort_out the couple dozen possible tax formulas on earthquake deductions . For do-it-yourself tax filers , start with additional information on earthquake disaster losses : Call the Internal Revenue Service and ask_for Publications 547 and 584 on Nonbusiness Disasters and Publication 334 , a Small Business Tax Guide . As for homeowners who had foreclosure tax headaches even before the earthquake : Consider Ed and Ann Smith , who purchased their first home_in Van Nuys in 1988 for $ 190 # 000 . They borrowed $ 152 # 000 to help pay_for the house that today is worth only $ 130 # 000 . Ed lost his job and the couple was four months delinquent on their mortgage in the fall of 1993 . What would you do ? The Smiths -- whose names have been changed here to protect their privacy -- were very concerned about their credit rating . Facing foreclosure , they placed their home on the market and debated what to do when they found a buyer willing to pay the home ' s current $ 130 # 000 market_value . The Smiths consulted an accountant about the tax implications of each alternative they were exploring . What the Smiths -- and many other financially strapped homeowners -- discovered was that the IRS considers debt forgiveness as taxable ordinary income . The IRS may also have a stake in any deferred capital_gains associated with a foreclosure . The resulting tax_bill for a troubled homeowner can be staggering . The Smiths , for example , ended_up with an $ 8 # 000 tax_bill even though they lost money on their home . The Smiths had three options , said their accountant Bob Solomon , a partner at West Los Angeles-based Levine , Cooper , Spiegel &amp; Co . The first was to sell their Van Nuys home for $ 130 # 000 and turn that money over to their mortgage lender , along with the $ 20 # 000 still owed on their loan . This would have left the couple with a $ 60 # 000 loss , $ 20 # 000 out of their pockets and no tax_bill . It should be noted that if the Smiths had a deferred gain of , say , $ 100 # 000 on a previous residence , the tax basis of their $ 190 # 000 home would have been $ 90 # 000 . In such a case , the IRS and California ' s Franchise_Tax Board would demand their share of a $ 40 # 000 &quot; gain &quot; realized by the Smiths -- unless the couple had the wherewithal to roll_over into another home within two years . This , of course , is easier said than done for a family already facing financial ruin . The second option , Solomon recalled , was allowing the home to be foreclosed . The IRS considers a foreclosure to be a sale and the IRS deems the sales price equal_to the loan balance . Here , the loss to the Smiths would be $ 40 # 000 and they would suffer the negative repercussions of a foreclosure . If this had been their second home -- as in the first option -- the IRS and Franchise_Tax board would want their share of the Smith ' s $ 60 # 000 gain -- roughly $ 24 # 000 . A third option is the one that the Smiths chose . They sold the home for $ 130 # 000 and realized a loss of $ 60 # 000 . Their lender forgave them the other $ 20 # 000 still owed on the loan , but the Smiths had to pay $ 8 # 000 in taxes for the $ 20 # 000 in debt forgiveness . If this had been their second home and they had rolled_over a $ 100 # 000 gain from before , they would have had a $ 40 # 000 &quot; gain &quot; and an additional capital_gains tax obligation of about $ 16 # 000 . If you ' re not confused by the numbers , you may be shocked by the size of the potential tax_bills . The tax issue is further complicated because capital_gains are taxed by the feds at about 28 % , while the &quot; ordinary income &quot; of debt forgiveness is taxed on a sliding scale of 15 % to 39 % , depending_on your tax_bracket . There ' s still more complexity to a borrower ' s tax obligation when there ' s a foreclosure or debt forgiveness . First , when a debtor is insolvent , the IRS won ' t hold the debtor responsible_for the debt cancellation to the extent of the debtors ' insolvency . Second , if there ' s a foreclosure , a debtor who is personally liable for a debt may also have to pay tax for debt forgiveness , noted Steven M . Friedman , West region director of real_estate advisory services at accounting_firm Ernst &amp; Young in Los Angeles . Another twist to these tax rules is that cancellation of a debt obligation by a lender will no longer necessarily result in income for tax purposes . Many borrowers have complained that they ' ve been hit not only with a reduction in their property values but also with a tax_bill when a lender forgave some of their debt . Owners of commercial property will now be able to defer any &quot; income &quot; that results from debt forgiveness -- as long as the taxpayer owns another commercial property . Residential property_owners should know , however , that this change only applies to commercial real_estate . Starting last month lenders must fill_out IRS form 1099 for any residential debt they forgive . &quot; The tax implications of debt forgiveness and foreclosure are extremely complicated , &quot; said Chris Carlson , a tax partner at accounting_firm Deloitte &amp; Touche , which has offices in Woodland Hills . He advises troubled homeowners to sit_down with an accountant and figure the tax_bill on each of the options that are available . Also , if there is any deferred capital_gains tax from previous residences , he said , all or part of that gain can continue to be deferred if the taxpayer buys another residence within two years or if the taxpayer is 55 or older .</TEXT>
