   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; U.S. COULD BE BUMP IN ROAD FOR FINLAND ; HOCKEY : AMERICANS HOPE TO USE AGGRESSIVE CHECKING TO KNOCK UNDEFEATED FINNS OFF TRACK IN TONIGHT ' S QUARTERFINAL GAME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The team that never believed it could win and the team that couldn ' t win until it had to will meet today in the quarterfinals of the Olympic hockey tournament that looks more like a mismatch than a matchup . Finland , known for producing teams with world-class skills and fragile psyches , began to shed that reputation here with a 5-0 round-robin record and a defense that gave_up only four goals . A victory today would remove that label . &quot; So far , we have played the best hockey , but in a game like the quarterfinals , you also need luck , &quot; Coach Curt Lindstrom said . &quot; You can ' t say we will win , but like every_other team , we have also the possibility to take the gold . It is very open. &quot; To Brian Rolston and his U.S. teammates , who faced an early trip home until they beat Italy on Monday , it ' s American ingenuity and grit against a team that ' s skillful but squeamish about being hit . The United States routed Finland in December , 6-2 , but Finland has since changed much of its personnel . &quot; We ' ve got_to pressure their defense and make them cough_up the puck , keep the puck low ( in the offensive zone ) and bang their defensemen , &quot; Rolston said . &quot; We have to throw everything at the net and crash the net , just like a North_American hockey_game . We ' ve got_to finish our checks . Against Sweden ( in a near-comeback on Saturday ) , in the third_period we were playing a North_American style , finishing our checks , and they were backing_down . &quot; We know how to do_it and I think we ' ll get_it done . If we don ' t win , we don ' t go_on . We ' ve played against that sort of pressure all year , and we ' ve played good under pressure. &quot; The winner will play the winner of today ' s quarterfinal game between Canada ( 3-1-1 ) and the Czech Republic ( 3-2-0 ) . In other quarterfinal matchups , Group_B winner Slovakia ( 3-0-2 ) , seeded 12th , will try to keep its upset streak alive against top-seeded Russia ( 3-2-0 ) and Germany ( 3-2-0 ) faces Sweden ( 3-1-1 ) . In the preliminary round , Finland held opponents to an average of 12.4 shots on goal and fewer than one goal . Lindstrom alternated goaltenders Jarmo Myllys -- the former Minnesota North_Star and San Jose Shark -- and Jukka Tammi . He would n ' t reveal today ' s starter , but it is Tammi ' s turn if the rotation holds . The goalies ' job has been made easier by a new defensive system that emphasizes constant motion , puck control and persistent forechecking in the neutral zone . Lindstrom ' s biggest contribution , though , is how he has strengthened his players ' self-assurance . &quot; He ' s talking a lot to us and trying to get our confidence up , &quot; winger Mikko Makela said . &quot; He ' s always saying , ' You ' re good ! You ' re good ! ' For Finns , it ' s important to hear that all_the time because otherwise we get down. &quot; When their spirits went_down , their bodies often followed if they were hit . Not anymore . &quot; I don ' t think the USA can do that to us , &quot; said center Raimo Helminen , Makela ' s linemate . Said Lindstrom , who is in his second year as coach , &quot; They didn ' t have the self-confidence . They were always afraid to meet Russia , Sweden , Canada . Now this year , we have beaten those teams , but not the USA team . We have beaten Sweden , Czechoslovakia ( the Czech Republic ) and Russia and we have more confidence. &quot; That has been apparent to U.S. Coach Tim Taylor . &quot; They ' re a very complete team and they play a very effective style , &quot; said Taylor , whose team was an inconsistent 1-1-3 in group play . &quot; So far in this tournament , they ' ve made the fewest mistakes and played the best defense . You ' ve got_to give Finland an awful lot of credit . They ' ve always taken a back seat to a lot of other nations in terms of hockey prowess , like Sweden , Russia , Czechoslovakia . Their coach has done a marvelous job. &quot; Finland ' s offense was as formidable as its defense , averaging five goals . Helminen , with six points , and Makela , with five , are among the top scorers , and the line of Ville Peltonen , Saku Koivu and Jere Lehtinen has been dazzling with its quickness and puck handling . &quot; They don ' t take long_shots , &quot; said goalie Garth Snow , today ' s probable U.S. starter . &quot; A goalie might only see 15 shots , but eight of them might be great shots from the slot . You have to be mentally prepared and try to keep the goals against to a minimum. &quot; Each coach saw a potential weakness in the other ' s team . Lindstrom said the Americans are mistake-prone while when forechecking but added , &quot; The American players are very good and have a very good fighting spirit. &quot; Said Taylor : &quot; It ' s really going_to come_down to emotional strength . . . . We ' ve got a lot of emotion going_for us . We ' re not going_into this thing fearing the outcome . We ' re going into it looking_forward to the challenge. &quot;</TEXT>
