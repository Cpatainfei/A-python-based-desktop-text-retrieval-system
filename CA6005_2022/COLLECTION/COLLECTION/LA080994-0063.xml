   <HEADLINE> WOMAN IS SENTENCED FOR FALSE AID CLAIM ; EARTHQUAKE : WOMAN GETS PROBATION FOR FRAUDULENTLY COLLECTING FEMA MONEY BY CLAIMING SHE LIVED AT NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After telling a judge she has been plagued by shame and remorse , a Carson woman was sentenced to three years probation Monday for receiving $ 2 # 300 in federal aid by falsely claiming to have lived_in the Northridge Meadows Apartments , where 16 people died during the Northridge quake . U.S. District Court Judge Terry J . Hatter opted to give Denise Jones , 36 , a chance , despite requests by prosecutors to sentence her to three months at a correctional facility for illegally obtaining aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency . Jones , 36 , who has since returned the money , pleaded guilty in April to one count of making a false claim to a government_agency in_order to seek FEMA aid by phoning an assistance line and giving her address as Northridge Meadows . &quot; I don ' t understand what ' s with you , &quot; Hatter told Jones . &quot; What ' s your problem ? &quot; &quot; I wasn ' t thinking at all about what I did , &quot; Jones replied . &quot; I had a drug dependency and it caused a lot of problems with my life . &quot; I ' ve been in agony , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m very ashamed of what I have done. &quot; Authorities were tipped_off to Jones , and three others who falsely used the Northridge Meadows address to collect emergency aid , by a mail_carrier who found himself delivering mail -- including FEMA material -- to unfamiliar names at the apartment complex after the quake . The crimes were considered particularly ghoulish among a rash of quake-fraud attempts because of the high death toll at the collapsed apartment_building , which made_it the disaster ' s deadliest address . At least three others who used Northridge Meadows addresses have already been convicted of the same charges Jones faced . Two received prison_terms -- Daniel Richards of Hollywood was sentenced to two months in prison and Miguel Cordero of Van Nuys was sentenced to four months in prison -- while Mary Mitchell of Paramount also received three years probation . In Cordero ' s case , authorities said he filed a FEMA claim using the apartment number where mechanic Pil Soon Lee and his 14-year-old son , Hwon , were crushed to death . When reviewing Jones ' case , Hatter apparently was influenced in her relatively light sentence by the fact that Jones has a young daughter . Jones also told Hatter she has been off drugs for a year and a half and that she has been taking parenting lessons . Jones did not elaborate in court on the relationship between her earlier drug problems and filing a false FEMA claim . Moments before imposing the probation sentence , Hatter told Jones she owes debts to herself , her child and society that cannot be paid from jail . &quot; It ' s time you start repaying some of these , &quot; Hatter said . &quot; You ' ve just got_to stop doing these things that are self-destructive . In contention was why Jones did not immediately return the aid money -- which she said she never spent -- to the government . Eda Suh , a federal public_defender , told Hatter that the money was not returned sooner because federal authorities failed to tell Jones where to send the check . Suh described Jones as &quot; shy and timid. &quot; Assistant U.S. Atty . Edward Moreton , however , pointed_out that since the Northridge quake hundreds of people have returned money they were not entitled to receive . Jones , he said , &quot; was not one of them. &quot; Following the hearing , a man who identified himself as Jones ' father said , &quot; We ' re just glad it ' s over . We ' re relieved. &quot; He declined to comment further . Prosecutors say Jones is one of as_many as 30 people who have been charged with filing false claims following the Jan . 17 quake . A multi-agency task_force began making the arrests to signal that law_enforcement authorities planned on pursuing opportunists who took_advantage of quake aid programs . Additional investigations are continuing , authorities said .</TEXT>
