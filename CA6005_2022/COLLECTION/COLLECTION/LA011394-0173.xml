   <HEADLINE> DO IT : GETTING RUNNERS OFF THE STREET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Barry Hawley ( &quot; Baz &quot; to his friends ) is waging a sometimes lonely campaign to get runners off the pavement and onto the trails . Since 1984 , the gregarious English expatriate has organized the San Juan Trail 50 , a 50-mile run held each fall along trails in the backcountry of Cleveland National Forest . A favorite event among that hardy breed known as ultra-distance runners , the race is nonetheless well beyond the limits of most weekend warriors . So last year , Hawley launched a four-race series of shorter off-road runs starting from Blue_Jay Campground off Ortega Highway . The winter series has been expanded to six runs_for 1994 , starting Saturday with a 12-kilometer jaunt and building_up to a 50K run March 26 . The races will be held every two weeks . With a shoestring budget , Hawley is depending_on word-of-mouth to build the series . Last year ' s races ranged from 40 to 90 runners . Some of the more popular street runs can draw thousands of participants , but Hawley sees hope for his crusade to get runners to try the trails . Many runners over 30 years old &quot; are really sick and tired_of the 10Ks and that sort of thing , &quot; Hawley said . When they try trail running , he added , the injuries have fallen . &quot; Running slower and on softer terrain is definitely easier on the legs and joints. &quot; Trail running has the advantage of some spectacular scenery as well . From the trails around Blue_Jay , at about 3 # 000 feet , there are vistas that stretch such peaks as San Jacinto , above Palm Springs , and San Gorgonio , the highest peak in Southern California . &quot; Once they have tried the trails , I have never had anybody say , ' Hey Baz , that was terrible , ' &quot; Hawley said . He is counting_on lots of repeat runners for the coming series , plus an infusion of newcomers . Saturday ' s course starts off with a half_mile on paved road to separate the runners before they hit the trail loop . The course includes some moderate elevation gain and loss . The race begins at 8 a.m. Runners can register before the race , but there ' s a $ 5 penalty atop the $ 12 fee . Coming events are a 16K on Jan . 29 , entry fee $ 12 ; a 22K on Feb . 12 for $ 18 ; another 12K on Feb . 26 for $ 12 ; a four-by-12K team relay March 12 at $ 60 per team , and the 50K race March 26 , with an entry fee of $ 40 . Series T-shirts are $ 9 . The relay is something Hawley tried_out at a recent race he organized at Lake Isabella . &quot; It worked_out really fantastic , &quot; he said . &quot; What I ' m hoping for basically is for groups to get involved in trail running. &quot; What : 12K trail run . When : Saturday , Jan . 15 , at 8 a.m. Where : Blue_Jay Campground , Cleveland National Forest . Whereabouts : From the San Diego ( 5 ) Freeway , exit at Ortega Highway and drive north into the_hills , past Ronald W . Caspers Regional Park and past Upper San Juan Campground . Turn left at Main Divide Road and follow the signs to Blue_Jay Campground . Wherewithal : $ 12 ( T-shirt is $ 9 ) . Where to call : ( 714 ) 380-2666 .</TEXT>
