   <TEXT> President Clinton on Monday announced agreement with Ukraine and Russia to dismantle Ukraine ' s entire nuclear arsenal , hailing the long-sought accord as &quot; a hopeful and historic breakthrough that enhances the security of all three participants. &quot; The agreement , disclosed at the NATO summit here and scheduled to be signed_in Moscow on Friday , must survive potentially serious opposition by nationalist factions that oppose elimination of the weapons and control the Ukrainian Parliament . But if it survives attack , the accord will represent a substantial step_forward for the U.S. policy of curbing nuclear proliferation . Ukraine , politically and economically unstable since it became an independent state after the dissolution of the Soviet_Union , has 176 intercontinental missiles armed with some 1 # 240 nuclear_warheads -- all aimed at the United States . It also has 592 nuclear_warheads aboard bombers , which would be covered by the agreement . The chaos in Ukraine , while possibly threatening the ability of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to carry_out the agreement , also underscores the pact ' s potential importance . It would allay Russia ' s fear of a hostile nuclear neighbor and answer concerns that Ukraine ' s nuclear_weapons could wind_up in the hands of other countries . Under the agreement , the United States , Russia and Britain will provide security assurances for Ukraine when it gives_up its weapons and becomes an adherent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . Ukraine also will get financial assistance in dismantling the weapons as well as compensation for surrendering the highly enriched uranium in the warheads , which can be converted into fuel for civilian nuclear_reactors . The United States has offered at least $ 175 million to help pay the actual cost of dismantling the nuclear_weapons . The White_House said the pact could also lead to a doubling of U.S. economic aid to Ukraine , from $ 155 million this year to $ 310 million . Clinton_Administration officials said the payments for uranium would be substantial . And the agreement provides that , in_effect , Ukraine will receive fuel rods it needs for its power reactors from Russia now and Russia will be repaid out of the proceeds from the sale of warhead uranium later -- another strong incentive for the economically desperate government in Kiev to go_forward with the deal . Meanwhile , as expected , the NATO summit , initiated by Clinton to revitalize the 45-year-old military alliance and redefine its mission in the aftermath of the breakup of the Soviet_Union and the end of the Cold_War , endorsed the President ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; plan Monday . The plan provides_for enhanced North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization cooperation with former adversaries of the old Soviet Bloc and for gradually extending NATO membership to them . The NATO leaders , in a draft of a declaration to be released today , propose that &quot; peacekeeping field exercises &quot; be held beginning later this year with those countries that join the plan . To coordinate joint military activities within the partnership , NATO will invite participating states to send permanent liaison officers to the alliance ' s headquarters in Brussels . The plan does not guarantee expanded NATO membership . Nor does_it set a timetable for admitting new members . As a result , it falls far short of realizing the hopes of Poland , Hungary and some_other East European_countries for immediate membership . But Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said the compromise blueprint was endorsed enthusiastically by all NATO members . Based on signals from countries in East and Central Europe , he said , he expects &quot; a very high degree of acceptance &quot; by the former Communist countries as well . Pointing_out that NATO also had endorsed another Clinton initiative placing non-proliferation at the core of the alliance ' s effort , Christopher said that sitting in the room with other summit participants &quot; one could see and feel the re-emergence of U.S. leadership in this post-Cold War era . This was President Clinton ' s summit . He called the summit . He developed the three initiatives , which were enthusiastically and unanimously endorsed. &quot; While the Ukrainian Parliament has balked on nuclear arms control issues in the past , Christopher and Clinton said there are strong reasons for Ukraine to endorse the trilateral agreement . And the secretary said the United States believes Kravchuk can implement it through executive order . Clinton said , &quot; We have no reason to doubt the ability of the president ( Kravchuk ) to keep the commitment that he is prepared to make. &quot; Kravchuk ' s press service announced Monday night that an agreement had been reached to hold a &quot; consultative meeting &quot; between Kravchuk and Clinton in Kiev on Wednesday and a trilateral summit with Clinton , Kravchuk and Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin in Moscow on Friday . The statement said nothing about a substantive nuclear agreement , noting only that the Moscow session would focus_on &quot; the completion of recent trilateral negotiations. &quot; Senior officials in Ukraine suggested the final terms of the accord had yet to be determined . &quot; From a legal standpoint , a final agreement and the end of talks are two completely different things , &quot; said Anton Buteiko , Kravchuk ' s top foreign_policy adviser . Valentyn Lemysh , head of Parliament ' s military affairs commission , said Kravchuk is empowered to conduct negotiations on Parliament ' s behalf . &quot; The president is entitled to sign accords , but if there are any contradictions with the conditions imposed earlier , then the pact must be put to ratification , &quot; he said . The prospect of Kravchuk signing a nuclear accord with Russia and the United States immediately came under_fire from Ukraine ' s nationalist opposition . &quot; President Kravchuk has no authority to sign an international document on nuclear_weapons , &quot; opposition leader Vyacheslav Chornovil told the Interfax-Ukraine news_agency . &quot; Nuclear policy is to be worked_out by Parliament. &quot; Alexander A . Shalnev , a columnist for the Russian newspaper Izvestia , expressed doubt about Kravchuk ' s ability to win parliamentary support . &quot; It is very unlikely that Kravchuk will succeed in lobbying for the agreement in the Ukrainian Parliament , &quot; he said . &quot; In his efforts to reach an understanding with the United States , he is always having to make concessions to the opposition . I am not sure this attempt will be much more successful than the previous ones. &quot; On another issue , Clinton reaffirmed that Washington remains ready to help NATO implement a peace settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina if one is reached by the warring parties . He expressed confidence the U.S. Congress would support such a move if the operation were clearly under NATO command , the means of carrying_out the mission were equivalent_to its purposes and the purposes were clear in scope and timetable . He said he welcomed inclusion in the final declaration at the end of this summit a reaffirmation that NATO is prepared to carry_out air strikes if necessary to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo , the safe areas and other threatened areas in Bosnia . Clinton said NATO had better not be engaging in rhetoric but be prepared to take military_action . &quot; Those of us gathered here must understand , therefore , if the situation does not improve , the alliance must be prepared to act , &quot; he declared . &quot; What is at stake is not just the safety of the people in Sarajevo and any possibility of bringing this terrible conflict to an end , but the credibility of the alliance itself . And that , make no mistake about it , will have great ramifications in the future in other contexts. &quot; In announcing both the Partnership for Peace plan and the trilateral agreement with the Ukraine and Russia , Clinton said , &quot; we have taken two giant steps toward greater security for the United States. &quot; Calling nuclear_weapons in the former Soviet_Union the most crucial non-proliferation challenge facing the world , he pointed_out that when the Soviet_Union dissolved , four of its countries were left with nuclear_weapons -- Russia , Ukraine , Kazakhstan and Belarus . He said that by working to eliminate Ukraine ' s arsenal -- the world ' s third largest after the United States and Russia -- he was seeking to assure that the breakup of the Soviet_Union does not result in the birth of new nuclear states , which could raise the chances for nuclear accident , nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation . Earlier , after a year of U.S. diplomacy , both Kazakhstan and Belarus agreed to accede_to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . Clinton is scheduled to leave here today when the summit ends and go_to the Czech capital of Prague to meet with leaders of Poland , Hungary , Slovakia and the Czech Republic to discuss the Partnership for Peace plan and other issues . Addressing the opening session of NATO , Clinton said : &quot; The size of the reactionary vote_in Russia ' s recent elections reminds again of the strength of democracy ' s opponents . The ongoing slaughter in Bosnia tallies the price when those opponents prevail . If we don ' t meet our new challenge , then most assuredly we will , once again , someday down the road , face our old challenges again. &quot; Skeptics have viewed Clinton ' s Partnership for Peace as an empty halfway step between East European leaders ' demands for full NATO membership now and the reluctance of Moscow and some European capitals to see any expansion of the old Cold_War alliance . But Clinton declared , &quot; This must_not be a gesture. &quot; Staff writer Richard Boudreaux in Moscow and special correspondent Mary Mycio in Kiev contributed to this report . * RELATED STORIES : A6-7 An Atomic Arsenal Aimed at U.S. President Clinton said Monday that Ukraine had agreed to a deal with Russia and the United States to give_up its nuclear arsenal , including 176 missiles targeted on the United States .
