   <HEADLINE> ' CHUNNEL ' OPERATOR FACES CRUNCH GETTING ITS FINANCES IN ORDER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eurotunnel PLC faces a crunch week in its troubled eight-year life as the_English Channel_tunnel operator scrambles to bring banks in_line before asking long-suffering investors for a lifesaving share issue . The market expects banks to cough_up a grudging $ 1 billion of debt this week , with a stock rights issue of up_to $ 1.36 billion possibly coming_before the end of next . That would take total costs of the world ' s biggest engineering project to nearly $ 16.6 billion , more_than double the original budget . Eurotunnel , though , refuses point-blank to say exactly how much it will ask shareholders to put_up . It also declined to comment on weekend news_reports that banks were already considering deferring interest payments in case refinancing fails . &quot; It ' s all speculation , &quot; a Eurotunnel spokeswoman said Sunday . &quot; We don ' t wish to comment on where we are at the moment . Once the debt is finalized , then we will go_out to shareholders. &quot; The group has had a frantic last two months . In April , it shelled_out $ 1.66 billion to settle a bitter cost dispute with Transmanche Link , builders of the 31-mile undersea tunnel . May 6 saw the tunnel ' s official opening by Britain ' s Queen Elizabeth and French President Francois Mitterrand , and the first trucks finally rolled through last Thursday -- a year late . Saturday , the Financial Times newspaper reported that a reluctant European Investment Bank had agreed to pump in $ 75 million , and Germany ' s public sector Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau had also joined in . Bank_of_England lobbying has also pulled Japanese banks -- lenders of nearly a quarter of its $ 10.3-billion debt so far -- into line . &quot; All the way through , the bank has been kept_in touch by the company and its banks . At times , we have been able to help them reach agreement , &quot; a Bank_of_England spokesman said of its efforts . Eurotunnel ' s money runs_out in June , and it needs at least $ 1.66 billion to $ 1.81 billion to see it through to a projected cash break-even in 1998 . Add costs , extra interest and a cushion , and the market expects it to go_for up_to $ 2.42 billion . Eurotunnel ' s share price slumped to $ 5.63 on Friday as thoughts of the cash call , far higher than expected , began to start sinking_in . Most of Eurotunnel ' s 633 # 000 shareholders are individuals expected to shun the issue , meaning underwriters are looking_for a large discount -- up_to 30 % , one Sunday newspaper said .</TEXT>
