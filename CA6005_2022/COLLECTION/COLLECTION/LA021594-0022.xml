   <HEADLINE> YOUR BODY / KATHLEEN DOHENY : RIDDING THE MIND OF THAT NAGGING CRAVING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You gotta have a cookie . Now ! One with chips big enough to satisfy this urge for chocolate that is making you crazy . Should you or shouldn ' t you ? When a craving is this intense , enjoy , say some researchers . Indulging occasionally might satisfy you enough to stay_on the nutritional straight-and-narrow the rest of the time . Whoa , say others who counter that a little willpower is what ' s needed : Eating a nutritious , low-fat_diet can reduce and even eliminate cravings . Then there ' s the all-in-your-head approach : Rescript your mental_image of craved foods to make them seem less appetizing . * The Chemical Connection : When certain brain chemicals increase , so do cravings , according to Sarah Leibowitz , a neurobiologist at Rockefeller University in New York , who has studied the effects of some brain chemicals on animals ' appetites . High levels of a chemical called neuropeptide Y increase urges for carbohydrates , she says , while high levels of galanin make the animals choose fat-filled foods . A taste for carbohydrates is highest in the morning , she says , while urges for fatty foods increase throughout the day , often peaking around dinner time . She says that is probably true for animals as well as people -- although abundant human data is lacking . Another researcher , Adam Drewnowski , professor and director of the Human Nutrition Program at the University of Michigan , agrees that a variety of brain chemicals can trigger cravings . But for humans , he says , there are other factors that also influence what foods you crave . Physiological factors such_as pain , along with psychological factors such_as depression , can bring_on cravings , he says . Cultural and socioeconomic factors can come_into play too . Consider the change in dietary habits in Japan , which has undergone drastic Westernization . &quot; Fat intake there has tripled in the last 25 years , &quot; he says . &quot; But I am assuming their galanin levels have not tripled. &quot; Food cravings often occur in response to a painful or stressful situation , Drewnowski says . &quot; Sugar and fat may act_as natural analgesics. &quot; Some cravings are strongly tied to habit : You always eat popcorn dripping in butter at the movies . * The Gender Differences : Women tend to crave more often than men , Drewnowski has also found , although he does not know why . Women are likely to crave foods filled with fat and sugar , such_as candy and cookies . Men are apt to want foods high in protein , fat and salt -- like a juicy steak . * Wishing Away Those Cravings : Never mind those brain chemicals or life ' s stresses . The trick to controlling your cravings , says Linda Tatum , a Beverly Hills hypnotherapist , is to teach yourself to regard foods you crave as neutral or , better yet , unappetizing . She asks clients with cravings to visualize the object of their desire -- say , a chocolate_chip_cookie -- on a large screen . Then she interrogates them about their mental_image . Is the cookie in_color ? In a frame or free-floating ? How does_it smell ? Is it on a plate ? In clear focus ? Once that mental_picture is firmly implanted , she asks the same questions about a food the client loathes -- say , cottage_cheese . &quot; In every case , something is different , &quot; she says . A cookie is likely to be pictured in mouth-watering color ; cottage_cheese in unappetizing black-and-white . Next , clients learn to transpose mental_pictures of the unappetizing food to the irresistible food : to see the cookie in black_and_white , for starters . * The Nutritious Approach : Eating right can reduce or eliminate cravings , others say . &quot; If you are providing your body with optimal nutrients , you should not be experiencing cravings , &quot; says Diane Grabowski , a dietitian and nutrition educator at the Pritikin Longevity Center , Santa Monica , where the menu emphasizes very low-fat_diets . Concentrate_on eating a diet with about 75 % carbohydrates , 15 % protein and 10 % fats , Grabowski says , and your body won ' t want sugary , fried or fatty foods . She emphasizes eating carbohydrates that are unrefined -- apples instead of apple_juice , for instance . Those who switch to a low-fat , balanced_diet and eat frequently -- six mini-meals a day -- can expect cravings to disappear within a week , she says . * The Long View : Drewnowski acknowledges that some people -- but very few -- seem to adapt to low-fat_diets without cheating , but if you ' re not one of them , an occasional indulgence might actually keep you healthier in the long_run . &quot; Women who go_on severe diets ( with little fat or sugar ) appear to be at greater risk of alcohol and drug use , &quot; he says , citing preliminary results of a current study . Someday , drug treatments might target overwhelming cravings by normalizing levels of brain chemicals associated with them . Meanwhile , depriving yourself too_much might have adverse long-term consequences , Drewnowski says .</TEXT>
