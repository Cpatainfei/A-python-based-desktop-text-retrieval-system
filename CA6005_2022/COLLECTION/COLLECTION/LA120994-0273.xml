   <HEADLINE> LEADERS CLASH ON U.S. ROLE IN BOSNIA ; POLITICS : DOLE , GINGRICH PUSH FOR GREATER INTERVENTION . IN BOW TO ALLIES , CLINTON FAVORS NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Recent calls from Republican congressional leaders Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich for an escalation of American intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina point toward a contentious new round of legislative and political struggles over U.S. involvement in Europe ' s bloodiest conflict since World_War_II . Dole and Gingrich , in recently blasting President Clinton for inaction and urging the United States to support the Bosnian Muslims with air strikes and arms shipments , have set the stage for bruising legislative conflicts with an Administration that is now pushing for a negotiated settlement to the fighting . But the two leaders may also be precipitating a collision with members of_their_own party who are skeptical of greater U.S. involvement in the conflict on either military or political grounds . &quot; I think we have a very full plate of a legislative agenda , which are the commitments we made to the American people -- and Bosnia wasn ' t one of those , &quot; said Sen . John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , a leading opponent of greater American military involvement in the war . &quot; I don ' t think there ' s a huge amount of support in Republican ranks for having a crusade on Bosnia , &quot; said one well-connected GOP strategist , who asked not to be identified . The sharp attacks from Dole and Gingrich , the incoming Senate majority_leader and House Speaker respectively , are bringing full circle the long and tortured domestic debate over Bosnia . As a presidential candidate in 1992 , Clinton sounded much as Dole and Gingrich do today . He frequently accused President George_Bush of not doing enough to support the Bosnian government and called_for air strikes to limit or reverse the battlefield gains of the Bosnian Serbs . In office , Clinton has repeatedly declared his support for greater use of force against the Bosnian Serb rebels but has been unable to persuade the Europeans to go_along . The low point came_in the spring of 1993 , when the Administration proposed the so-called &quot; lift and strike &quot; option -- under which the United Nations would lift the embargo against shipment of arms to the Bosnian government and the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization would undertake widespread air strikes on military facilities of the Bosnian Serbs . Clinton was forced to back_down after the major NATO countries brusquely rejected the proposal . After a frustrating series of similar confrontations that produced only minimal military_action , the Administration moved toward the European position in November . After the allies rejected an Administration call_for air strikes against Serbian forces advancing on the besieged government-held area around the town of Bihac , the Administration indicated that it would drop requests for further air strikes and instead emphasize negotiations to reach a settlement . That abrupt turn_in policy created the opening for the new Republican thrust . Last Sunday , on the ABC-TV program &quot; This Week With David Brinkley , &quot; Dole laid_out a three-step alternative to the Administration plan . The Kansas senator called_for the removal of U.N. peacekeeping forces from Bosnia ; for the United States unilaterally to break the international arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims , and for a NATO campaign of &quot; robust bombing &quot; against Bosnian Serb military targets intended &quot; to bring them to the negotiating table. &quot; Appearing the same morning on NBC-TV ' s &quot; Meet the Press , &quot; Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) endorsed Dole ' s agenda , but appeared to go even further in urging air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs and perhaps Serbia itself . Gingrich said the United States should warn the Serbs that &quot; if you launch a general offensive , we would reserve the right to use air_power against every position you have , against every command and control_center , against every position , everywhere . We would reserve the right to take you apart , and we ' d do_it in three to five days . . . and we ' re telling you to just back_off and accept an armed truce. &quot; Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and other Administration officials have denounced those proposals as a prescription for expanding the war . But many observers see broad similarities between Dole ' s approach -- if not Gingrich ' s broader discussion of bombing -- and the Administration ' s own ill-fated &quot; lift and strike &quot; initiative . In criticizing Dole and Gingrich , the Administration has sounded some of the same cautious notes about the risks of escalating the conflict that Bush raised against candidate Clinton in 1992 . &quot; It ' s one of the ironies , &quot; said Richard Haass , a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and an aide on the National Security_Council under Bush . &quot; Now you have Republicans arguing for ' lift and strike ' and you have Clinton -- after the campaign where he outflanked Bush early on and talked tough at the outset of his presidency -- coming_around to a fairly extreme version of the Bush position. &quot; In some important respects , however , the Republican leaders ' plans go beyond even Clinton ' s earlier approach . While Clinton sought multilateral approval for lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian government , Dole and Gingrich want the United States to breach it alone . Dole has indicated that he intends to move quickly next year on legislation instructing Clinton to break the arms embargo . The Administration staunchly resists that proposal , arguing that shipping arms to Bosnia without U.N. approval would undermine compliance with other international embargoes that United States supports , such_as the sanctions against Iraq . But support for lifting the arms embargo has steadily grown across the political spectrum , and even Administration officials consider it virtually inevitable that Congress will approve such legislation next year . The real issue may be whether the votes exist to override a veto if Clinton chooses to exercise one , which White_House aides say he would be inclined to do . Even less certain is the capacity of Dole and Gingrich to generate much pressure behind their calls_for wider air strikes . Even Dole allies concede that Congress can ' t compel Clinton -- much less NATO -- to bomb more heavily . With most legislators focused_on other concerns , Republican congressional aides say , opinion has not hardened in GOP ranks about the Dole-Gingrich push for wider military_action in Bosnia . But several sources said that GOP legislators and strategists alike will be cautious about investing too_much political capital in_demanding greater involvement in a war still distant to most Americans . &quot; You want the agenda next year to be , ' The Republicans change Congress , ' &quot; one GOP pollster said . &quot; You don ' t want the story for the first two months to be , ' The Republicans go_into Bosnia.
