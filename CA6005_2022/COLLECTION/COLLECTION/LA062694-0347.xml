   <HEADLINE> SHAPIRO NOW FACES HIS DEFINING MOMENT ; COURTS : AFTER YEARS OF HELPING CELEBRITIES , THE DISCREET ATTORNEY LEADS SIMPSON DEFENSE_TEAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For some of the most emotionally gripping scenes in the rapidly unfolding drama of O.J. Simpson , the man at center stage has been Robert L . Shapiro , a discreet advocate who is known for deft damage_control behind the scenes and in front of the news media . Before dozens of journalists and cameras nine days ago , Shapiro said his client was suicidal and pleaded for him to return to face arrest . Last Monday , he comforted the subdued former football great as Simpson said he was not_guilty of murdering his ex-wife and her friend . And , on Friday , the bushy-browed Shapiro won a victory when Superior_Court Judge Cecil J . Mills decided that a tide of leaked information had tainted the grand_jury that was considering murder indictments . The decision to pull the jury off the case means that Simpson , who stands charged with murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman , may have a chance to first hear the evidence against him at a public preliminary hearing scheduled for Thursday . Shapiro had hoped to avoid a grand_jury indictment , which would have precluded a preliminary hearing where witnesses could be cross-examined . With characteristic reserve , Shapiro did not gloat over what is being called a major setback for the prosecution , even though Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti supported the dismissal because of pretrial publicity . Shapiro merely said he looked &quot; forward to finally presenting this evidence in a public courtroom. &quot; The victory did much to at least temporarily dispel criticism that Shapiro , best known for getting celebrity clients out of relatively minor scrapes , was not up_to the job of handling what is one of the most sensational murder cases of this century . &quot; He made a brilliant move , &quot; said Harland W . Braun , a former prosecutor who defended some of the officers accused of beating Rodney G . King . &quot; The main thing is he ' s shaking them up_on the other side. &quot; The stakes in the trial are high for everyone involved . Simpson stands accused of crimes that could make him subject_to the death_penalty . For Garcetti , the case is a chance to end a string of embarrassing defeats for the district_attorney ' s office , including hung juries in the Menendez brothers ' first trial . And for the 51-year-old Shapiro , the son of a factory_worker who later operated a catering truck and moonlighted as a bandleader , it may be the case that defines his place among the most famous attorneys in America . Although he has counted among his clients a_few murderers , drug dealers and blue-chip corporations during his 25-year legal career , Shapiro has made his name by representing entertainers such_as Johnny Carson and Rod Stewart , sports figures such_as Darryl Strawberry and Vince Coleman , and other lawyers , including F . Lee Bailey . Instead of courtroom brilliance , his professional stock in trade has been his skill at negotiating plea bargains and winning sympathy for clients by shaping the public perception of their alleged misdeeds . And some lawyers , including New York attorney William Kunstler , have noted that Shapiro does not have an extensive record of arguing cases in court . During the Simpson case , the ever-dapper Shapiro has appeared at each juncture to be unflappable , even serene , the antithesis of the confrontational lawyers often portrayed in movies and on television . Asked prickly questions by the media , he has opened his eyes wide and answered in detail without a hint of dismay . And inside and outside the courtroom , he has been the paragon of politeness , even when forcing the prosecution to admit it did not have a piece of widely reported evidence -- a bloody ski_mask . Being polite , sincere and low-key has served Shapiro well personally as well as professionally . Celebrity car valet Chuck Pick , a friend since childhood from the working-class Westside neighborhood where both grew_up , attended a bar_mitzvah for Shapiro ' s son recently at movie producer Robert Evans ' house . Other guests included Garcetti , to whom Shapiro made a campaign donation of $ 5 # 000 last year , and such celebrity clients as Strawberry and Coleman and movie_star Jack Nicholson . Shapiro , Pick said , spent much of the party &quot; hanging_out with us guys that he grew_up with. &quot; Those characteristics also win points for Shapiro in the courtroom , said Alvin S . Michaelson , a criminal defense_attorney who has worked with Shapiro on numerous cases . Somehow , he said , Shapiro is able to be very nice and still get what he wants out of a system that is built_on confrontation . &quot; It ' s absolute nonsense that he doesn ' t know how to try a case , &quot; Michaelson said . Two members of the pantheon of legal stars come_down on opposite sides of the debate over Shapiro ' s readiness to take the case . Bailey , godfather to Shapiro ' s first son , described him as the only lawyer in America allowed to use Bailey ' s name on a letterhead . &quot; The bottom_line is O.J. Simpson is in perfectly good hands , &quot; he said . Bailey , who defended Albert DeSalvo in the Boston Strangler case and publishing heiress Patty Hearst , said Shapiro has been consulting with him on the Simpson case since the beginning and talked to him about Friday ' s motion to void the grand_jury proceedings . Leaving open the possibility that he might be brought_in to handle the courtroom phase of the case , Bailey said Shapiro has not made a decision . Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz , who defended boxer Mike Tyson , also has been consulted about constitutional aspects of the case . Another member of the team is Gerald F . Uelmen , dean of the Santa Clara University Law_School . &quot; Bob is a team kind of guy and is quick to say that the best service to my client is to get all_the best to help_out , &quot; Bailey said . In the 1990 murder case involving Christian Brando , son of actor Marlon Brando , Shapiro took_over from Kunstler . Kunstler said the younger Brando had a strong defense in the death of Dag Drollet , the lover of his half_sister , Cheyenne , and that Shapiro should have taken the case to trial . Instead , Shapiro allowed Brando to plead guilty to manslaughter and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison . Shapiro later appealed the sentence . &quot; To take_on a notorious fixer , a plea bargainer , like Shapiro gives the wrong message , &quot; Kunstler said . &quot; He is entirely the wrong man for O.J. Simpson. &quot; Shapiro also took heat in that case for allowing police to interview Cheyenne Brando about her lover ' s death . She later left the country and turned_up in Paris . Prosecutors suspected that Shapiro had , at least indirectly , advised her to flee to keep her from testifying against her half brother . Although witnesses were subpoenaed about that , it could never be proved and the_matter was dropped . The Brando case is one Shapiro cites in an article he wrote for a professional journal advising other lawyers how to handle themselves in high-profile cases . In the Brando case , he wrote , he had to counter the likelihood that the prosecutor would try to make an example of his client because of his famous actor father . &quot; To keep my options open , my first response to the media was a statement . . . that in all cases a lawyer has a responsibility and obligation to attempt to resolve cases without a trial. &quot; That statement made_it seem like it was common practice to resolve cases without going_to trial , he said . It put pressure on the prosecution to settle &quot; on terms that were acceptable to us. &quot; The first time Shapiro ' s name was associated with renown was in 1975 , when he was still trading services for office space at a Sunset Boulevard firm headed by veteran defense_attorney Harry Weiss . Brought in to help represent porn star Linda Lovelace in a Las Vegas drug case , he managed to get the case dismissed . In 1982 , he got calls from Bailey and Carson on the same day , asking him to represent them in drunk-driving cases . He was part of a team that called nearly 30 witnesses and got Bailey acquitted in what was at the time the state ' s most celebrated such case . To avoid such a trial , Carson pleaded no contest in Beverly Hills . Other clients have included Evans , whom Shapiro was able to keep_from testifying in the spectacular Cotton Club case involving the 1983 murder of Roy Radin . Evans was not charged in the case . Last fall , Shapiro took_on New York Mets outfielder Coleman as a client after he was charged with throwing a powerful firecracker in the parking_lot outside Dodger Stadium , injuring three people , including a toddler . Attorney Larry Feldman , a longtime friend , said Shapiro ' s first public statement after taking the case showed his ability to shape perceptions . Shapiro said throwing the firecracker was &quot; the stupidest thing anyone can do , &quot; said Feldman , who last fall represented the child who accused Michael Jackson of sexual molestation . &quot; That defused the whole situation and then he went_about building_up who this person was and how sorry he was. &quot; Coleman pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was given a one-year suspended jail sentence and three years probation . He was ordered to pay $ 1 # 000 and restitution to those who were injured . At Coleman ' s sentencing hearing last fall , during the Malibu fires , Shapiro told the judge that Coleman had his jeans and shovel_in the car and was_on his way to help_out . By that point in Shapiro ' s career , humanizing his clients to deflect attention from their misdeeds had become almost second nature . Texas_Rangers baseball slugger Jose Canseco had started carrying a gun , Shapiro said when his client faced weapons charges , because he was scared and tormented by obscene telephone_calls . Canseco pleaded no contest and received a six-month suspended jail term and 80 hours of community service . Christian Brando , in his murder trial , was portrayed as protecting his half_sister from further beatings by her lover . In the case of Simpson , Shapiro has talked_about the football injuries that keep his client from sleeping unless he has a special pillow , and described him as lonely for his children on Father ' s Day . In 1980 , Shapiro defended Jerry Blackmon , who was neither famous nor rich . He had admitted shooting his estranged wife twice in the chest with a . 357-caliber magnum revolver a year earlier while standing over her at the side of the Foothill Freeway in Pasadena . According to court records , witnesses testified that Blackmon said if he could not have his wife , no one else would . Two psychiatrists hired as witnesses concluded that Blackmon was &quot; so mentally impaired that he lacked the capacity to form ' malice ' as the law defines it &quot; and the charges in the case were reduced to manslaughter . Blackmon served five years and four months of an eight-year sentence . &quot; I know how Mr. Shapiro . . . orchestrates things , &quot; said Blackmon , who now lives outside Oklahoma_City . &quot; He was like Liberace playing the court system . If it weren ' t for him , I would have served 27 years to life. &quot; Now Shapiro is handling a case with eerie parallels , one that will forever mark his career for good or for ill . And his transformation from hard-working celebrity attorney to the celebrity attorney of the hour is all happening within a_few miles of the neighborhood where Shapiro grew_up . He was born Sept . 2 , 1942 , in Plainfield , N.J. , to a father who was working in a shirt factory and a mother who was employed as a department_store clerk . He was 5 when he moved with his parents , an aunt and a grandfather to a four-unit apartment_building at Pico and La Cienega boulevards . After graduating from Hamilton High_School , Shapiro went_to UCLA , where he earned a bachelor ' s degree in finance in 1965 . Studies came easily for him and his fraternity brothers recall him spending as much time at parties at the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity -- called the campus &quot; Animal House &quot; by members -- as in the library . Thirty years later , fraternity brothers still remember the dapper suits and big hair that earned him the nickname &quot; Trini , &quot; after folk_singer Trini Lopez . &quot; We used to tease him about being flashy , &quot; said Jeffrey Allan Cohen , a Beverly Hills civil attorney and one of Shapiro ' s fraternity brothers , recalling in particular a powder_blue polyester suit with &quot; zero lapels. &quot; They also remember his ability to negotiate settlements to frat_house disputes . &quot; He was always there to set matters right , &quot; said Richard Levin , another fraternity brother who is now an executive with major_league baseball in New York . At Loyola Law_School , Shapiro struggled at first . He once told an interviewer that he failed his first_class but that the shock was enough to make him study harder . Always a skillful communicator who was able to ad lib as if he was reading from a script , Shapiro won a moot_court presentation before a U.S. District Court judge . While studying for the Bar , however , he became so nervous that he plucked out his eyebrows . Even so , he passed the test on his first try and began working as a deputy district_attorney in Torrance . He had married while in law_school but the marriage fell_apart a year later and was annulled in 1969 . In 1972 , he joined Weiss ' high-volume practice , where the young attorneys worked late many nights on everything from drunk-driving to child molestation cases . It was during that time he married his second wife , Linell , and the couple later had two sons , whom Shapiro now coaches in soccer or Little_League baseball . The Shapiros live_in a 3 # 600-square-foot , four-bedroom Cape Cod-style home_in Benedict Canyon that they bought_in 1991 . The 1975 victory in the Lovelace case &quot; made me feel good , &quot; he told an interviewer several years ago , &quot; but it also showed me the political pressures that come_with publicity &quot; and that it is &quot; scary when somebody sticks a microphone in your face. &quot; Although Shapiro has declined to give interviews in the wake of the Simpson case , he has held several impromptu news_conferences attended by scores of reporters and photographers . In dealing with the press , Shapiro advises his colleagues , avoid cliches when describing a homicide . Do not , for example , call it a &quot; tragedy. &quot; Rather , use the term &quot; horrible human event &quot; or some_other phrase that an attorney finds appropriate , he wrote . Repeat such phrases continuously , he wrote , and &quot; they will be repeated by the media . After a while , the repetition almost becomes a fact . That is the lawyer ' s ultimate goal. &quot; The best initial response in a high-profile case , he wrote , was almost exactly what he employed in the Simpson case . He suggested telling reporters that &quot; the best experts in the field are reconstructing the crime scene &quot; and informing &quot; the public that the client has support from his family and friends. &quot; He did veer from his prescription when he told the media the day he replaced Howard Weitzman as Simpson ' s attorney that his new client had an alibi . If Shapiro later decides to argue that Simpson committed the crime but did so only under great mental stress , he will have to backtrack on the alibi statement , Kunstler said . In describing Shapiro , attorneys familiar_with his work as well as longtime friends return constantly to his personal qualities -- his skill at making people feel at_ease and his confidence with such social graces as remembering birthdays , sending flowers and notes to old friends and looking directly in someone ' s eyes . They also talk_about the importance he places on his personal commitments . Last Wednesday , after appearing in court with his client and accompanying forensic experts to examine evidence , he ducked out_to keep a promise to his children by taking them to a World Cup soccer match . His sense of honor , his acquaintances say , prompted Shapiro to go_to great lengths a week ago to explain how Simpson had disappeared despite the lawyer ' s assurances that he would be there when police came_to arrest him . Danny Davis , who defended Ray Buckey in the McMartin Pre-School case , said : &quot; Bob Shapiro has immense interpersonal talent . He is one of the nicer guys in the Bar I know . Anyone who has ever talked to him knows he is very warm , very focused on people he is talking to , very sincere. &quot; Those skills , Davis said , have &quot; facilitated what he has accomplished for other celebrities who have had minor skirmishes with the law . But that is different from defending someone in a murder trial. &quot; For his part , Shapiro says he is confident in a trial arena : &quot; Let me tell you something about that . You cannot resolve cases or get favorable settlements until the prosecution knows you are capable of going_to trial and winning. &quot; Indeed , there are some who say Shapiro ' s reputation as a negotiator overshadows his substantial trial skills only by comparison . Elizabeth Baron , a Los Angeles County Superior_Court judge in Compton , said she met Shapiro in 1983 during a child molestation case . Shapiro represented a father who was trying to gain back the right to visit his daughters after they had been molested by a half brother in his home . By the end , &quot; I was persuaded that the father was an incredibly good father , &quot; said Baron , who was representing the daughters . &quot; His cross-examination of witnesses was a marvel to behold . He does_it calmly and quietly and he makes them look_like idiots. &quot; She said Friday ' s dismissal of the grand_jury is further evidence of his skill . &quot; I ' ve never heard of such a thing being done , ever . It shows he has the ability to handle a big case like this and is not being overwhelmed by it. &quot;</TEXT>
