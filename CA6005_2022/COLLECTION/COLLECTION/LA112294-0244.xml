   <HEADLINE> KEMP , BENNETT WARN OF GOP RIFT ON PROP . 187 ; POLITICS : THEY URGE WILSON , OTHERS TO TONE_DOWN DEBATE . THE REMARKS SUGGEST PITFALLS AWAITING NEW MAJORITY PARTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Presaging what may evolve into an internecine battle over immigration in the upcoming GOP-dominated Congress , two prominent Republicans Monday warned that carrying the Proposition 187 banner on the national stage could prove divisive and shift party thinking sharply to the right . William J . Bennett and Jack Kemp , former cabinet secretaries with presidential aspirations , continued their attacks on Gov . Pete Wilson for his promotion of Proposition 187 as a national remedy for the problems of illegal immigration that wrack California and a_few other states . Saying they fear that emotions over the issue will swamp sound policy decisions , Bennett and Kemp sought to tone_down the anti-illegal immigrant rhetoric from Wilson and others as threatening to the Republican_Party ' s future . &quot; He ' s scapegoating , damn it , and he should stop doing_it , &quot; Bennett said of Wilson . &quot; The problem with ( Proposition ) 187 as a solution . . . is it is meretricious . It is superficially attractive . But it doesn ' t solve the problem. &quot; &quot; Where the battleground will be fought is if they want to carry this nationally and turn the party away from its historic belief in opportunity and jobs and growth , and turn the party inward to a protectionist and isolationist and more xenophobic party , &quot; Kemp said . &quot; That would be something around which the soul of our party would be decided. &quot; In a written statement , both Republicans counseled taking a longer view . &quot; We are willing to concede that tossing logs onto the anti-immigration fire might result in short-term gains . But believe that in the medium and long term , this posture is a loser. &quot; Bennett and Kemp surprised many Republicans by opposing the ballot initiative shortly before the Nov . 8 election , while endorsing Wilson ' s reelection . Wilson criticized them for butting into California affairs and blurring the distinction between legal and illegal immigrants . But rather than burying the hatchet , the three Republicans appear to be locked_in a running shootout . The rift among top Republicans reflects not only the importance that immigration has attained in the wake of the Proposition 187 victory . It also suggests the pitfalls that the new majority party in Congress may encounter while wrestling with the visceral issue . Existing Republican immigration proposals do not advocate barring illegal immigrant children from school , as Proposition 187 would . But if the measure ' s backers succeed in winning sufficient lawmakers to their point_of_view , the debate over immigration legislation could become sharply factional . &quot; It ' s an issue of tension that they ' re aware of and will do everything they can to avoid , &quot; said Kent Weaver of the Brookings Institution , a Washington think_tank . &quot; It will pit the fiscal conservative , pro-cheap labor_forces versus those who want to appeal_to Hispanic voters. &quot; Rep . Lamar Smith ( R-Tex. ) , who is in_line to chair the House judiciary subcommittee on immigration , said , &quot; The success of 187 will push the issue ( of immigration reform ) . . . and will guarantee that Congress will take it up . I hope that the legislation has bipartisan support. &quot; Facing the new complexities that now underlie congressional discussions about immigration , Smith would not reveal his position on denying schooling to illegal immigrant children , the most controversial aspect of the California ballot initiative . Kemp and Bennett made their remarks at a news_conference co-sponsored by the Manhattan Institute and Empower America , two conservative Washington think_tanks that issued a group of &quot; leading immigration indicators , &quot; a compendium of various demographic statistics on legal immigrants . The two former cabinet officials and other speakers said they worried that the momentum generated by Proposition 187 would carry_over to punitive measures toward legal immigrants . &quot; This report puts the facts on the table , &quot; said Bennett , a former secretary_of_education . &quot; Just like health_care , there is no crisis in legal immigration. &quot; Rather , Bennett said , the problem lies_in blending the new arrivals into American society . &quot; It ' s a problem about American society right now , and that is assimilation . So , if you will , it ' s not legal immigration , stupid , it ' s assimilation , stupid , &quot; Bennett said , modifying the Democrats ' 1992 campaign credo . Joined by several speakers , including Ron Unz , who challenged Wilson for the Republican gubernatorial nomination , Bennett and others praised the net benefits of legal immigrants . &quot; If we are to improve things , we should look less to adjusting the flow of legal immigrants and much more to things like affirmative_action and reverse discrimination , bilingual education , multiculturalism in the classroom and the_like , &quot; Bennett said . Wilson , reacting in a television interview at Williamsburg , Va. , where he is attending the Republican Governors Conference , said , &quot; We really don ' t need any lectures from anyone from outside of California on the vast contributions of legal immigrants . &quot; ( Kemp and Bennett ) continue to confuse legal and illegal immigration . They are missing the point that was not missed by all_the legal immigrants who voted for 187. &quot; Kemp and Bennett advocate a stronger Border_Patrol presence , accelerated deportation process , crackdown on counterfeit documents and reform of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to combat illegal immigration . Times staff writer Robert Shogan in Williamsburg contributed to this story .</TEXT>
