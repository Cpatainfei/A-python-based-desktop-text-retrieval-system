   <HEADLINE> FRENCH OPEN / MEN ' S CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH ; A SURE THING : TITLE WILL REMAIN IN SPAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One is Catalan , the other Basque . But today , Sergi Bruguera and Alberto Berasategui will play for all_of Spain when they meet for the_French Open men ' s championship . And the cynics say that ' s all they will be playing for as the finale of the world ' s premier clay-court tournament has been banished to Iberia . No doubt Bruguera , of Barcelona , and Berasategui , of Arrigoriaga , will be doing hard_time today at Roland Garros Stadium , where they have swarmed all comers with unshakable ground_strokes . It could be a three-hour blinking contest , with the No . 6 Bruguera trying to become the ninth man to defend successfully a French Open title . Berasategui , ranked 23rd , will be trying to make history , as well . He wants to become the fourth man to win the_French Open without losing a set -- the last being Bjorn Borg in 1978 and 1980 -- and the second unseeded champion . Mats Wilander did_it in 1982 . Either way , one will become the fifth Spanish champion of the_French Open , and although that might not pique the interest of many , it is nonetheless an intriguing prospect . Even King Juan Carlos of Spain is expected to be in Paris for the grand event . Since Berasategui left the Palmer Academy tennis school in Florida , he moved to Barcelona to train with Spain ' s top players , including Bruguera . The two have become good friends , often practicing together , eating_out and going_to discos . Now they will be battling for the one Grand_Slam tournament title that means more to the Spanish than the three others combined . &quot; Sergi doesn ' t want to play Alberto , &quot; said Imanol Bellegui , Berasategui ' s youth coach . &quot; ( Bruguera ) has all_the pressure. &quot; The way Berasategui , 20 , clobbers those deadly wayward shots , few like facing him on clay . He hits forehands with a backhand grip in one of tennis ' most unusual swings . &quot; It is absolutely ( a ) world-class forehand , &quot; said Magnus Larsson , who lost to Berasategui in a 72-minute semifinal . Bruguera , 23 , knows it as well as anyone . He sees it during practice , and has defeated his young rival in two of their three matches . Both victories have come_on clay this year -- at Barcelona and Monte Carlo . Bruguera has lost only one set -- against Jim Courier in his semifinal victory Friday -- en route to the final . What has distinguished him and Berasategui from other competitors in Paris is sure-footed quickness on the unforgiving clay . &quot; I don ' t know if I am the fastest player in the world , but I am very quick and I have to take_advantage of that , &quot; the 5-foot-8 Berasategui said . It will be a footrace against Bruguera , who does not make many errors as he sends arcing shots deep to his opponents ' baseline . And Bruguera seems to have improved with each match , particularly in defeating No . 4 Andrei Medvedev in the quarterfinals and No . 7 Courier in the semifinals . Although not surprised by what has happened , Luis Bruguera , Sergi ' s father and coach , thinks his son can improve . &quot; He can do_better than this , &quot; the elder Bruguera said . Now that ' s a scary thought .</TEXT>
