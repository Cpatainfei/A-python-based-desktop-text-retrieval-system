   <HEADLINE> COMMITMENTS : THEY ' RE BREAKING_UP BUT YOU FEEL BAD . THAT COULD BE BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO HURTING FOR A COUPLE IN PAIN , THERE ' S A CHANCE YOU WILL LOSE A CHERISHED FRIENDSHIP -- OR TWO. ; FRIENDS IN NEED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They were the couple you always caught the latest movie with , or perhaps you helped each other on moving day . Your weekends were spent at each other ' s back-yard barbecues , or your kids were_on the same soccer team . You took occasional vacations together . Maybe you asked them to be your child ' s godparents . You knew they had disagreements , but all couples do . Then one day they drop the bomb : Their marriage is breaking_up . As their world crumbles , your future with this couple has abruptly changed forever . You feel awkward and upset . You don ' t know who to believe . You try not to take sides . When friends divorce , their closest allies not only deal with their own sadness , but must avoid becoming a casualty by staying in the marital DMZ . Barb Collins of Corona said she felt shocked and hurt when the couple she and husband Bill least expected to break_up suddenly did . &quot; They seemed like the ideal couple , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s not as if they owe you anything , but when you invest yourself in a friendship you end_up feeling somewhat betrayed. &quot; The wife , who initiated the divorce , did not stay in touch with the Collinses . Bill Collins said he found himself siding with the husband , who felt failure and embarrassment over the situation . &quot; They seemed like a couple that belonged together , &quot; Barb Collins said . &quot; It was very hard to accept that they weren ' t together anymore. &quot; &quot; People change tremendously and marriages can ' t always accommodate individual changes , &quot; said Marlene Schoen , a Beverly Hills psychologist specializing in relationship issues . &quot; Divorce may occur because couples are unable to make changes in their lives to support personal growth. &quot; Schoen thinks it ' s important for friends to put their own needs aside and to look_at what the divorcing couple ' s needs might be . Both couples will experience the divorce as a loss , said psychologist Peter Fisk , a family and marriage specialist practicing in the San Fernando Valley , and author of the book &quot; Give_and_Take With Eb and Flo : Adventures in a Marital Relationship &quot; ( Fithian Press , 1993 ) . &quot; As with any loss , there will be grief , depression and sadness . Assuming that your relationship with each person in the couple was equal , your friendship with them as individuals should not disintegrate . Tell yourself , ' I ' m losing the couple , but I ' m not losing the people , ' &quot; he said . Schoen and Fisk agree close friends can and should be honest about their feelings . &quot; It ' s going_to be an uncomfortable process . Explain that you would like to stay friends with both of them , &quot; Schoen said . &quot; You need to say , ' How can I help ? How can we remain friends on your terms for right now ? ' Ask them how you can make_it easier , &quot; Fisk said . Friends will see some psychological deterioration in the divorcing individuals , he added . &quot; It ' s important to be compassionate and understanding . Let them know that what they say is in the strictest confidence and try not to get drawn into the negativism . Mix the realities with positive statements . Let them know divorce doesn ' t mean the end of life , &quot; he said . &quot; Also be realistic about how much you are willing to listen to. &quot; Marcia and Carl of Burbank found themselves so embroiled in the tumultuous personal life of their friends that when those friends finally split_up , Marcia and Carl were completely burned_out and declined to get involved in the divorce . &quot; Define the boundaries of your friendship and let them know when they are putting you on the spot , &quot; Fisk said . &quot; You ' ll be much more of a friend by bringing them out of the_doldrums rather than allowing them to constantly focus_on the negative aspects of the break-up. &quot; Staying friends with both parties puts you in a delicate situation . Fisk finds the natural inclination for each person in the divorce is to look_for allies among their existing friends . &quot; Everybody wants to be viewed_as the good_guy , &quot; said Al Brill of Sylmar , married to Alice for 10 years . Both are previously divorced . &quot; I would never recommend choosing sides . It ' s important to support them individually , while staying neutral on their situation. &quot; &quot; If you start taking sides it will only create more conflict , &quot; Schoen said . She said that it is important not to make a judgment about who was right and who was wrong in the relationship . Both parties are hurt and will see things very differently , Schoen said . Friends should accept each individual ' s perception of their feelings . &quot; You just don ' t know what goes_on behind other people ' s closed doors , &quot; Brill said . &quot; If you ' re in a good marriage it ' s either difficult or impossible to understand being in a bad marriage . When you ' re in a bad marriage you can ' t imagine what it ' s like to be in a good one. &quot; &quot; They ' re getting enough advice already , &quot; said Richard Sherer of Redondo Beach , who is twice divorced . &quot; If you attempt to advise them , there ' s a great opportunity to hurt your friendship. &quot; Sherer finds that being a good listener is the best gift you can give a friend who is divorcing . &quot; People going_through a divorce ask a great_deal of their friends , because they are so self-involved , &quot; said Mary of Calabasas , who recently divorced after 20 years of marriage . She kept friends on the phone for long periods_of_time listening to her trauma . &quot; You really don ' t want to hear about them . All you want to do is talk_about yourself , &quot; she said . &quot; When it ' s all_over , whatever friends you have left should be treated like gold because they have been through so much. &quot; The reality is that maintaining friendships after a divorce isn ' t always possible . Much depends_on how the friendship evolved in the first place . Mary lost touch with the friends she made during her marriage , but many were wives of her husband ' s business associates . She was no longer being invited to any of the social_events that revolved_around being a couple . As she adjusted to the single life , her circle of friends changed . She found herself regaining some of her old friends who had fallen_away during the past 20 years . Many divorcing couples will let their mutual friends go , regardless of how persistent and supportive they seem to be . Fisk himself reacted this way when he divorced 12 years ago . &quot; Whenever I saw our old friends I was reminded of my ex-wife and the pain associated with the relationship , so I let them go . I recently got_in contact with an old friend who had tried in vain to maintain our friendship . He told me he couldn ' t understand why I had pushed him away , &quot; Fisk said . Being cut_off can mean a_couple_of things . &quot; If the divorcing person finds seeing you as hurtful or perceives you as attacking or unsupportive , they may choose to let the friendship go , &quot; Schoen said . &quot; The person could also be saying that they need some time and space to move_on in their life . People may need to disassociate themselves . Friends should put aside their own needs and agendas. &quot;</TEXT>
