   <HEADLINE> A YEAR AFTER WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING , TERRORISM SEEMS REMOTE ; NEW YORK : AT FIRST , EXPERTS PREDICTED A WAVE OF INCIDENTS . BUT NOW IT SEEMS MORE LIKE TRUCK BACKFIRING ON THE FOURTH OF JULY -- A BRIEF DISTRACTION . SOME WARN , HOWEVER , THAT THE WORST COULD BE TO COME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A year later , the lunch bag left on the park_bench is not a &quot; suspicious package. &quot; Motorists need not pop the trunk before entering the Rockefeller Center parking garage , and tourists don ' t have to line_up at metal detectors in the Empire_State Building . The Plaza ' s lobby no longer looks_like a Secret_Service convention . The World Trade Center bombing , once regarded_as a sign that terrorism had finally crossed the oceans to America , now seems more like a truck backfiring on the Fourth_of_July -- a momentary distraction , soon forgotten amidst the general cacophony . &quot; I don ' t think very much about it anymore , &quot; said Patricia Renton , a paralegal who works_at the Trade Center . &quot; There are other things to worry about. &quot; On the afternoon of Feb . 26 , 1993 , however , there was only the bomb . It shook the nation ' s two largest office towers , killed six people , injured another 1 # 000 and closed the complex for weeks . Eventually there would be arrests of a group of Islamic fundamentalists , followers of a storefront preacher with a seething contempt for Western modernity ; revelations of the suspects ' anger over U.S. policy in the Middle_East ; a long and largely uneventful trial that was winding_up with closing arguments last week . But what the nation remembers are the images of Feb . 26 -- tens of thousands of office workers streaming into the street , bewildered and exhausted , their faces streaked with smoke , sweat and tears . &quot; We all have that feeling of being violated , &quot; said Gov . Mario Cuomo . Experts warned of more of the same . Then-FBI Director William Sessions said the bombing &quot; could be the harbinger of a new era. &quot; RAND Corp . analyst Bruce Hoffman called it &quot; a watershed . . . . We are incredibly vulnerable . Everyone is going_to be looking_at us. &quot; Our borders were porous . Our policies were unpopular . &quot; We are in very deep trouble , &quot; said Robert Kupperman , another terrorism expert . The attack ' s success was said to have offered encouragement to almost anyone with a grudge and a bomb . If the center ' s bombers were amateurs , that showed anyone could do_it ; if they were pros , that meant foreign terrorists were ready to strike the home front . For years , of course , Americans had been installing metal detectors , closed-circuit_televisions and car barricades . Now there were calls_for even more security , an unappealing prospect to those already living behind triple-locked doors and window bars . But a funny thing happened : Nothing . The alleged perpetrators were quickly arrested , and four months later a related cell also was rounded_up -- before , authorities said , it could blow_up the Lincoln Tunnel , the United Nations and other targets . The FBI increased surveillance of other suspected terrorists and reportedly told them , in so many words , &quot; Don ' t even think_about it. &quot; The State_Department started a computerized program to make_sure suspected terrorists overseas don ' t get entry visas . The Nuclear Regulatory Commission tightened security requirements for nuclear_power plants . And , mostly without realizing it , Americans declared the Trade Center episode a victory . Three days after the blast , the President of the United States outlined the rules . The terrorists win half the battle , said Bill_Clinton , &quot; if they can get us to change the way we live and what we do. &quot; So the windows were replaced , the soot was washed off and the holes were patched . The nation moved_on ; the terrorists lost . &quot; I was extremely pessimistic a year ago , &quot; said Kupperman . &quot; Now I ' m much less so. &quot; The Trade Center itself still bears many signs of the bombing , including its shuttered underground garage and rooftop restaurant . But elsewhere , &quot; very little has changed , &quot; said Philip Stern , a former prosecutor who manages the Fairfax Group , a security service . &quot; There ' s no additional security at bridges or tunnels . You can walk into most office_building lobbies and get_onto an elevator without identification . Very few companies have taken serious security steps. &quot; Terrorism continues to be a problem , but largely a foreign problem . The weekend of the Trade Center blast there were bombings in Cairo , London and Lima . On two separate days in 1993 , Kurdish terrorists attacked about 75 separate Turkish targets around Europe . The number of global terrorist incidents logged by the State_Department increased from 361 in 1992 to 427 last year . But ' 93 compared favorably to ' 91 , when there were 557 incidents . More_than half of those involved U.S. citizens or property , compared to only about 20 % last year . Besides time and benign neglect , there was another reason the bombing faded from consciousness : It was an act of violence in what Cuomo , speaking Feb . 28 , called &quot; the most violent place in the world -- not because they do_it to us but because we do_it to ourselves. &quot; A year later the bombing seems nefarious but not remarkable , not in a nation where gunshots kill more_than 100 people a day ; not in a state where more people die from gunshots than auto accidents ; not in a city where gun deaths are so common that one newspaper lists them , like movie starting times , in a standing column titled &quot; The Toll. &quot; The Trade Center blast was spectacular , but it was also just one of 30 # 000 cases of workplace violence last year , just one of 2 # 200 bombings . In the weeks and months after Feb . 26 , there were plenty of other violent diversions : The catastrophe at the Branch Davidian compound in Texas ; the arrest of a Long_Island man who allegedly murdered a string of prostitutes ; the murder of six people by a gunman who opened_fire on a Long_Island commuter_train at rush_hour . Will what the government calls &quot; the single most devastating terror attack ever committed on American soil &quot; eventually fade from memory ? High_school students still learn of the &quot; Palmer raid &quot; roundups of suspected subversives in 1920 , but not the bomb that killed 30 people on Wall_Street in the same year . &quot; It was like throwing a rock in a pond , &quot; said Brian Jenkins of Kroll , the security consulting_firm . &quot; A big splash , but the ripples dissipate. &quot; Some experts , however , still think the Trade Center blast marked a turn for the worse . &quot; The fact there haven ' t been any more attacks doesn ' t mean we ' re out of the woods , &quot; said Hoffman of RAND . &quot; Terrorism doesn ' t work in a predictable fashion . It may be another year before a new one in the U.S. &quot; The attack , he says , remains a landmark of &quot; the amateurization of terrorism &quot; ; it showed that amateurs using ordinary materials could have an extraordinary impact in the United States . Any terrorism forecast based on the Trade Center is undercut by the fact that , after a four-month trial with 207 prosecution witnesses and 1 # 003 exhibits , &quot; we still don ' t know the big picture , &quot; Hoffman said . &quot; Was a foreign government behind it ? If so , why ? &quot; Good questions . But in the meantime , there is so_much else to worry about .</TEXT>
