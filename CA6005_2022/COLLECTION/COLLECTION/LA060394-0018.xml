   <HEADLINE> RODRIGUEZ ON SMOKING BAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I have always admired the writing of Richard Rodriguez . But I am sad that he uses tobacco as a metaphor for misplaced priorities ( Opinion , May 22 ) . I used to try to write and think as broadly and holistically as Rodriguez . But after I became ill and disabled because of cigarette smoke in my workplace , I became a one-issue person . I truly regret that I have had to become so narrowly focused . But I have come_to understand that all_of my adult life I have had to separate myself from the community . I was born with asthma and could not be in any location where people were smoking , whether it was in a university hallway , in a workplace , or simply in a place to have a good time . My son also has asthma and discovered in his first full-time job after graduating from college that he too cannot work or play in an environment where there is secondhand smoke . Ten percent of the population have asthma and other lung diseases . Our segregation from the community because of secondhand smoke should be labeled what it is , a denial of civil_rights . For us , tobacco smoke is a weapon as lethal as the weapons used in a drive-by_shooting . But it is not as visible it doesn ' t make headlines . A smoking ban is not a futile attempt to avoid the inevitable death . It is a long overdue restoration of the civil_rights of persons with respiratory disabilities . I do not hate the people who smoke . Certainly I cannot hate my parents , who both died prematurely of smoking-related illnesses . They smoked while I struggled to breathe and could not see the connection . Rodriguez and I both empathize with the people trapped in this sad addiction . We cannot control much in this life , but Los Angeles can begin to become the brighter and happier place that Rodriguez yearns for if the air is cleared in nightclubs and places where young people go_to have a good time . My son says amen to that . ESTHER SCHILLER , Co-Director Smokefree Air for Everyone Newbury Park * Rodriguez ' essay did my heart good . After 24 years in Los Angeles , having been mugged , burglarized , rear-ended three times , overcome by heat and smog in all seasons , no longer able to go_out for a leisurely meal where I could linger_over coffee and a cigarette ( need I mention riots , floods , fires , earthquakes ) , I am determined to escape to someplace where I can at least ease the strain with a smoke . I ' m outta here -- back to New York City . ARLENE BEER Tarzana</TEXT>
