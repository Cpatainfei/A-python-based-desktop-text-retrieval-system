   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION / HONG KONG ; A WORLD AWAY ; LITTLE LAMMA ISLAND , A 40-MINUTE FERRY RIDE FROM HONG KONG , OFFERS A RURAL RESPITE FROM THE CROWDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Most of Hong Kong ' s 6 million inhabitants are packed onto a section of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula . Pushing_through the crowds on Nathan Road or in the teeming markets of Mongkok , the city ' s density is all too palpable . But take a ferry to one of Hong Kong ' s 235 outlying islands , and you can escape a world of high-rises and flyovers in less than an hour . Lamma is one of the closest islands to the city , only 40 minutes away by ferry from Hong Kong ' s Central District . Its open-air seafood restaurants on the waterfront are famous for the freshest prawns , lobster and other delicacies -- at prices about a third less than Hong Kong ' s . The largely rural , five-square-mile island attracts a sizable contingent of Hong Kong day-trippers , particularly on summer weekends . But when I visited on a quiet autumn weekday , I was searching for serenity , not seafood . Private cars are prohibited on Lamma , and I was looking_forward to a relaxing hike along its gentle , grassy hills and deserted beaches . I disembarked at Yung Shue Wan , one of two Lamma villages served by the Hong Kong Ferry , with several commuters returning home from work . ( Most of the island ' s 5 # 000 residents are fishermen , but it has also drawn former Hong Kong residents fleeing the city ' s congestion. ) Following the commuters ' lead and my map , I walked 20 or 30 minutes to a small crescent of almost-white sand , at this hour echoed by the crescent moon just visible in the western sky above the bay . Straight up the steep hill overlooking Hung Shing Ye Beach , I saw a red-and-white sign advertising , in Chinese characters , Han Lok Yuen , one of several small , unpretentious &quot; holiday houses &quot; that cater to weekend visitors from Hong Kong . I climbed a broken flight of cement steps to a scarlet-painted iron gate , beyond which was a terrace dotted with umbrella-topped tables and surrounded by palm_trees and potted plants . My corner room on the third and top floor , with a tiny bathroom whose shower produced a weak jet of warmish water , was simple in the extreme . But its very simplicity set_off the beauty of the scene outside . I carefully averted my eyes from the large power_plant directly to the west ( whose twin stacks are visible as far away as Hong Kong ) . But to the east , against a backdrop of brown hills , banana_trees with broad , tattered leaves fluttered in the wind . Red and purple bougainvillea crowded the windows . And on the bay side , green bamboo at least 30 feet high pushed_through my balcony ' s crimson railings , and the indigo South_China_Sea lay beyond . The restaurant at the Han Lok Yuen is famous for its roast pigeon , and securing a table at dinner ( especially for one or two people , since most tables seat 8 or 10 ) can be difficult . I managed to get a seat on the terrace at sunset and asked_for their signature dish . &quot; Why don ' t you have it tomorrow , &quot; my waiter suggested . &quot; I ' m going_back to the city tomorrow , &quot; I replied . &quot; Well , if you don ' t mind waiting a long_time . . . . &quot; I didn ' t -- but learned to order in_advance the next time . When my pigeon finally arrived , spread-eagle on its white plate , it was crisp and luscious . . . not really roasted at all , but simmered first in a richly spiced broth , then deep-fried to seal_in the juices and give the skin a glossy crunch . The following morning , I set_out on what I had planned as an all-day hike to some of Lamma ' s more remote beaches and up 1 # 158-foot Shan Tei Tong ( Mt . Stenhouse ) , the island ' s highest vantage_point . I was prepared_for at least a_few wrong turns . In more populated parts of the island , footpaths are often paved and clearly marked in English . But once you pass beyond the larger settlements , they are neither maintained nor marked . The path that began below my hotel , just off Hung Shing Ye Beach , bumped_up and down along low and windy cliffs above stony beaches and sheer drops to the sea . Dragonflies and blue , black_and_white butterflies darted in and out of the tall grasses . Already a hot-looking haze hung over the peak in front of me -- making me glad I ' d chosen to explore Lamma in autumn , when temperatures are often at least 10 degrees cooler than on a sticky midsummer ' s day . From the island ' s isthmus near Lo So Shing Beach , the little fishing port of Sok Kwu Wan was shining in the sun , the wind rippling the water to a fine glitter . Dozens , maybe hundreds , of small_boats and pontoons topped by little shacks painted pink and green formed a floating bridge almost all_the way across the harbor . A red-brick and whitewashed-cement-block building with scarlet doors stood open_to the breeze on the outskirts of the village . Inside , cramming the narrow aisles of the Tin Hau temple ( dedicated to the Taoist queen of heaven and goddess of the sea ) , I saw a horned beast ' s head of papier-mache and red plush and two shrines encrusted with paper deities , dragons and red , green and blue flowers . Gold-and-white lanterns with silky red tassels hung suspended from the ceiling . An open window on Sok Kwu Wan ' s main_street revealed a small room full of older_women , lustily playing mah-jongg with much clacking of tiles . Along the waterfront , shops and restaurants were just opening_up . At one establishment , the kitchen staff sat around a table outside , eating richly flavored sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves , a snack that looked so tempting I bought one as sustenance for my journey . Following a cement path along the coast to the east , I bypassed the turnoff to the beach at Mo Tat Wan and headed directly for the village of Mo Tat , a cluster of houses and banana groves . Near laundry poles sporting sets of black pajamas in front of traditional , tile-roofed stone houses , a man was doing his washing at a communal spigot . Past the cluster of houses and banana groves that make_up Mo Tat , the path led under cover , and tiny sapphire butterflies darted in and out of the shade . From another nearby village called Tung O -- where two tattered red rags tied to a bamboo pole marked the entrance , reminiscent_of a Chinese landscape_painting -- I took an unmarked , yellow dirt path up the northeast ridge of Shan Tei Tong . As I climbed , I looked down the mountain ' s steep eastern slope to the lapis_lazuli waters and white-sand beach at Sham Wan . About halfway up , the path became steep steps cut_into the sandy soil by the feet of earlier climbers -- a graphic reminder that the trail is recommended for experienced hikers , and only when the visibility is good . At the summit , crickets chirped faintly in the sharp wind , amid grass and pale purple thistle . The skyscrapers of Hong Kong Island and the cement works_at Sok Kwu Wan prevented some of the isolation I seek on mountaintops , but the views across the water were breathtaking , the gray shapes of neighboring Lantau ' s peaks suggesting another expedition . The northwest descent from the peak to Lo So Shing Beach , along a gently undulating ridge with a view of the water , looked more gradual and less fearsome than the way I came_up . But the final segment of the trail petered out_in the grass . Although I was just above cultivated fields on the outskirts of a village , I found myself fighting through a dense growth of cane , emerging in the midst of neatly tilled rows of eggplants . Two women in black pajamas and conical straw_hats , working in a corner of the field , waved me away , showing their displeasure at my intrusion . Making my way carefully between the soft ridges of eggplant , I was soon on the path back to where I had started , the beach at Hung Shing Ye . I arrived_at dusk , with plenty of time before the last ferry left for Hong Kong at 10:35 p.m. Colored lights to celebrate Friday night were strung across the red iron gate at my hotel , the Han Lok Yuen ; it was so inviting that I decided to stay for a leisurely dinner . I had another pigeon , along with a dish of choy sung and oyster sauce and a cold Tsing Tao beer to wash the dust of the road from my throat . I was rounding_out my stay_on Lamma as I had begun it -- but with a deepened appreciation for the island ' s serene contrast to its frenetic neighbor across the way .
