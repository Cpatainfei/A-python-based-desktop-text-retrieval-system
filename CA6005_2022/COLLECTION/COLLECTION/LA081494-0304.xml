   <HEADLINE> OFFICIALS TAKE SIDES ON WORTH OF PROP . 187 ; POLITICS : CONTROVERSY BUILDS OVER ' SAVE OUR STATE ' MEASURE THAT WOULD DENY MANY PUBLIC BENEFITS TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Ventura County Board of Supervisors opposes it . So does the local chapter of the Mexican-American Bar Assn . and a countywide advisory panel to the public health department . But so far , the true depth of feeling over the so-called &quot; Save Our State &quot; initiative has not been demonstrated locally . Stay tuned . Supporters and opponents of the Nov . 8 ballot measure -- which would deny schooling , non-emergency health_care and other public benefits to illegal immigrants -- have spent the summer gearing_up countywide campaigns aimed at winning_over voters . Now , less than three months before Election_Day , both sides say they are set to go toe-to-toe over a proposition that holds the promise -- or the threat -- of further fueling the already fiery immigration debate . &quot; The law needs to be upheld and government should not act_as a magnet for lawbreakers , &quot; said Steve Frank , coordinator of the Ventura County campaign in support of the measure . &quot; If they can ' t get jobs and they can ' t get benefits , they will have to go_back where they came from. &quot; Polls show the initiative gathering widespread support among voters . And it could play a significant role this fall_in at least one of the races for Ventura County ' s two congressional seats . With that in mind , groups throughout Ventura County have launched a series of efforts aimed at reversing the public mood . Opponents say they hope to reveal the initiative for what they believe it is : a misguided measure that violates the California and U.S. constitutions , turns citizens into immigration agents and casts a shadow of suspicion on Latinos , Asians and other nonwhites . &quot; It ' s a very divisive initiative , &quot; said Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez , who on Tuesday will urge his fellow councilmen to adopt a resolution opposing the measure . &quot; As time goes_on , and people see it for what it really is , I think more and more agencies are going_to take a position against it. &quot; Its official name is Proposition 187 . Supporters have dubbed it &quot; Save Our State , &quot; or SOS for short . The initiative would bar illegal immigrants from public education , non-emergency health services and other publicly funded programs . To accomplish this , teachers , police_officers , social_workers and health_care_providers would be enlisted to weed out illegal immigrants . Beyond the desire to limit public benefits to U.S. citizens or legal residents , supporters of the measure acknowledge that what they really want to do is reshape national immigration policy by forcing judicial_review of court rulings that guarantee education and other services to the undocumented . It is likely that even if voters pass the measure , major provisions of it will be tied_up for years by protracted legal battles . &quot; I think it ' s a sad situation that it has to be done_in the form of initiative because the federal_government has not done its job in enforcing immigration law , &quot; said Rep . Elton Gallegly ( R-Simi Valley ) , a Proposition 187 supporter and longtime advocate of tougher controls on illegal immigration . &quot; But I ' ll tell you , &quot; Gallegly added : &quot; If it passes the way I think it ' s going_to pass , it will send a very strong message to those in the Congress that the people of California can ' t take any more. &quot; Many opponents of the initiative do not argue the need for some type of immigration reform . They simply question the wisdom of a measure that would deny education and health_care to people who are unlikely to return to their homelands simply because they can no longer get public benefits . &quot; We feel that it is unhealthy public policy , &quot; said Barbara Thorpe , chairwoman of the Ventura County Public Health Community Advisory Board . &quot; We are not saying that illegal immigration isn ' t a problem . But what we are saying is that this is not the way to go_about solving that problem. &quot; The advisory_board to county public health has officially opposed Proposition 187 . Thorpe points_out that the initiative overlooks a simple public health concept : If the health of one segment of a community is allowed to decline , the health of the entire community is jeopardized . Thorpe said she doesn ' t believe that illegal immigrants drain health services the way framers of Proposition 187 say they do . &quot; I don ' t see them as heavy users or , as this initiative would have you think , abusers of the system , &quot; she said . &quot; They ' ve picked the wrong crowd , I think. &quot; In perhaps the most drastic provision of the initiative , school officials would be obligated to verify the legal_status not only of students but of parents and guardians , even if their children are U.S. citizens . This provision will probably trigger a court challenge and possibly a review of state and U.S. Supreme Court rulings that guarantee public schooling to illegal immigrant children . &quot; I think we need some discussion about whether or not it will , in the long_run , benefit this county and this state to not provide education and public health services to children who are here , &quot; said Chuck Weis , Ventura County superintendent of schools . &quot; My concern , &quot; Weis added , &quot; is that this dialogue is really about trying to find a scapegoat for our economic problems. &quot; Supporters of the measure acknowledge that hard_times have a lot to do with the creation of Proposition 187 . But more to_the_point , they argue that illegal immigrants have overrun the state and that California simply has had enough . So deep is public sentiment on the issue that it could have repercussions this fall_in several political races , including the contest in the 24th Congressional District , which includes Thousand Oaks . In that race , Rep . Anthony Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) is being challenged by Calabasas Republican Richard Sybert , a former aide to Gov . Pete Wilson . The two are_on record in support of legislation to curb illegal immigration . But Sybert supports Proposition 187 and Beilenson does not . &quot; Tony Beilenson has done a very good job of engaging in anti-illegal immigration rhetoric while at_the_same_time doing absolutely nothing about it , &quot; Sybert said . &quot; I certainly plan to make_it ( Proposition 187 ) an issue . On immigration , as with so many things , he says one thing here at_home and he does another thing in Washington. &quot; Beilenson said his record in support of legislation to stem the tide of illegal immigration speaks_for itself . But he said he believes that many of the provisions of the ballot measure will be ineffective , and that some are downright offensive . &quot; The problem of illegal immigration is extremely serious and has to be dealt with in a substantive way , &quot; Beilenson said . &quot; But if one truly cares about this issue . . . then you concentrate_on the things that hold_out some real promise of stopping illegal immigration. &quot; Gallegly , Ventura County ' s other congressman , said he thinks the practical effect of Proposition 187 will be to spur changes in immigration policy on Capitol_Hill and the White_House . He said he believes measures he has long championed -- such_as denial of citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants and calling_for counterfeit-resistant identification cards -- will gain widespread support because of the measure ' s passage . &quot; You ' ve never heard me say that this is a panacea or a perfect initiative , &quot; Gallegly said . &quot; What this is is a public expression of frustration that says we ' ve got_to do something about the problem. &quot; But opponents of the ballot measure say they fear that the practical effect of Proposition 187 will be to unfairly pin the state ' s economic woes on those who can ' t stick_up for themselves . &quot; People look_for easy answers and this is the easy way_out , &quot; said Moorpark Councilman Bernardo Perez , president of the Latino advocacy group El Concilio del Condado de Ventura . Perez will debate the issue with Steve Frank early next month . The two squared_off in another debate last month . &quot; My concern , &quot; Perez said , &quot; is that Proposition 187 , and the political rhetoric from both sides of the aisle , are getting us away from responsible and reasonable dialogue on immigration policy. &quot;</TEXT>
