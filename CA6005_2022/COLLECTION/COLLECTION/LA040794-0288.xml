   <HEADLINE> JUDGE CRITICIZED OVER 4-MONTH DELAY IN MURDERER ' S SENTENCING ; COURTS : FAMILY OF VALENCIA VICTIM SAYS JURIST DOESN ' T WANT TO HAND_DOWN DEATH_PENALTY RECOMMENDED BY JURY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Five months ago , a jury decided that a prison parolee who abducted and murdered a Valencia man deserves to be put_to_death . But 24-year-old Scott Forrest Collins is still in county jail , awaiting the formal sentencing . The family of Fred D . Rose , who was shot in the back of the head , believes there is one simple reason why Superior_Court Judge Leon Kaplan hasn ' t sent Collins to Death Row . &quot; I don ' t think he wants to sentence him to the death_penalty , &quot; said Sharon Rose , wife of the slain construction supervisor . Prosecutors say the four-month delay in this case is unusual , noting that actions by the judge , and not the defense_attorney , have delayed the sentencing . The judge , who has never handled a death_penalty case before , has requested that defense_attorney Bruce Hill write memos concerning possibly inappropriate conduct during the trial by prosecutors and members of the court audience . Kaplan ' s requests for additional paperwork have come during several hearings and were not solicited by the defense . In all , Kaplan has conducted six post-trial hearings which have delayed a sentencing originally scheduled for Dec . 2 . &quot; To me , ( Kaplan ) has no courage and he should not be sitting on the bench , &quot; Sharon Rose said . &quot; He ' s not for preventing crime. &quot; Kaplan declined to comment on the case , citing ethical rules which bar judges from commenting pending a case in their courts . Collins is again scheduled to be sentenced today , but Kaplan must first rule on a request for a new trial , a motion filed_in nearly every serious case . Prosecutors and members of the victim ' s family firmly believe Kaplan will order a new trial in Collins ' case , this to avoid the difficult chore of sentencing someone to die . &quot; I ' m very concerned that the judge will not in fact follow the jury ' s recommendation , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Lea Purwin D ' Agostino , who added that jurors have contacted her to express &quot; their dismay. &quot; If Kaplan wants to retain his position on the bench , the Rose_family has warned , he should hand_down the death sentence . If not , he should prepare to suffer the wrath of victims advocacy groups who , according to Sharon Rose , will challenge him when he comes_up for reelection and take the judge &quot; on a roller_coaster ride that will last ( his ) entire life. &quot; Collins was found guilty of first-degree murder in the Jan . 23 , 1992 , execution-style slaying of Rose , a Valencia resident and father of three who was shot only one month after Collins was released from prison . The jury also convicted Collins on two special circumstance charges , murder during a robbery and a kidnaping , both of which made him eligible for the death_penalty . The same panel that convicted Collins on Sept . 30 later determined that death was the appropriate punishment . The jury made its formal recommendation to Kaplan on Nov . 2 . Under California law , if a jury recommends death , the judge must act like a 13th juror and independently weigh the evidence presented during the penalty phase . It is extremely rare for a judge to overlook the death recommendation and hand_down the only other possible sentence in a special circumstance murder case -- life in prison without the possibility of parole . Based on their observations , Rose_family members feel Kaplan is acting as if he is the attorney who will represent Collins during the inevitable appeal . They point to Kaplan ' s three-day review of the nearly 7 # 000 pages of trial transcript , while in open court , and recommendations he made to defense_attorney Hill about specific points to make during his motion for a new trial . The constant delays have been widely discussed among prosecutors in the Van Nuys courthouse , many of whom believe Kaplan is looking_for a way to avoid issuing an execution order . &quot; This is a classic case of justice delayed , &quot; D ' Agostino said . &quot; Did the defendant wait five months until he killed the victim ? &quot; * Last year , Collins ' attorney made_a_motion for a new trial , a request initially based on action by the jury during deliberations . Two jurors used a protractor and string -- and what Hill characterizes as erroneous evidence -- to determine Collins shot Rose while the victim was_on his knees . When Hill first appeared to argue his motion , Kaplan raised other issues , pointing_out that he observed D ' Agostino and courtroom observers making inappropriate faces during the trial . After being &quot; encouraged to brief those issues &quot; by the judge , Hill was forced to amend his motion , or else face possible accusations of malpractice . &quot; It is this type of behavior that has caused the public to lose faith in the criminal justice system , &quot; D ' Agostino said . Sharon Rose said she has been demoralized by the wait . &quot; My heart is totally immobilized , &quot; she said . &quot; It does affect how we get_on_with our lives. &quot;</TEXT>
