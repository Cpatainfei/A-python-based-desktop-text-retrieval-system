   <HEADLINE> HAWKS ' WINTER HAVEN ; BIRDS OF PREY FLOCKING TO WILDLIFE REFUGE AT SEAL BEACH NAVAL STATION , SURVEY FINDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The bait was set . A small wire cage containing a mouse and a sparrow sat in a field , easily seen by any of the sharp-eyed red-tailed_hawks in a nearby grove of eucalyptus_trees . Within 20 minutes , one of the large birds swooped in_for a late breakfast and was snared . An elated biologist , Pete Bloom , had one more startled young_bird to measure , weigh and hold firmly , carefully avoiding its sharp talons , while he wrapped an aluminum identification band around its leg . It was the 116th red-tailed_hawk that Bloom had banded and the 221st he had counted so far this winter at the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station . Bloom , who is under contract with the Navy to identify and count all birds_of_prey that utilize the 5 # 000 acres of marsh and uplands , works even after sunset , searching the night sky and fields with spotlights for owls . The survey is part of a joint effort by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Navy to protect and enhance wildlife in the undeveloped part of the military facility . Besides warehousing weapons , the site is an important winter destination and rest stop for southbound birds_of_prey along their historic migratory flight_path between the Arctic_Circle and South_America . In recent years , biologists have achieved a resurgence of endangered shorebird species at the station by controlling predators and providing a man-made island and floating nests . They also want to increase the numbers of hawks , owls and other birds_of_prey that mostly hunt in the station ' s expansive uplands that shoulder the marsh . Off limits to the public and protected from development , Bloom said , the large expanse of open space at the station is &quot; an incredibly significant resource that supports several species of raptors ( birds_of_prey ) that are almost absent in the rest of Orange County. &quot; And it is increasingly essential to migratory birds , he added , as other wetlands and open spaces fall to development along the western coast of North_America . &quot; Birds that are migrating south along the Pacific Flyway have no safe place to land and catch a meal in the 30 miles between the Santa Monica Mountains and Seal Beach , &quot; Bloom said . &quot; The most important aspect of the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station is that it is protected and will remain a sanctuary. &quot; * One of his most surprising findings , Bloom said , is that the uplands provide a winter home to the highest density of red-tailed_hawks in North_America . The booming population of red-tailed_hawks , Bloom said , reflects an exceptional breeding year for the birds throughout California , Oregon and Washington . The hawks , 90 % of which were fledged last spring , are attracted to the base , he said , by an abundance of ground_squirrels and gophers that inhabit the burrow-pocked fields and offer good eating . Bloom said he has found 20 species of birds_of_prey on the base , including eight pairs of burrowing owls , a once common inhabitant of Orange County that has been nearly decimated outside the naval weapons station by development . &quot; This is where they are making their last stand , &quot; Bloom said of the owls . In the winter , the base is visited by a growing number of peregrine_falcons , a bird_of_prey on the federal and state endangered species lists . Bloom said he expects at least 100 migrating peregrines to stop at the base this winter to feast on smaller shorebirds . The peregrine population is starting to rebound nationwide because of a reduction in the use of agricultural pesticides and because of efforts to breed captive birds , whose offspring recently have been released to the wild in large_numbers , Bloom said . * While birds_of_prey inhabit the uplands , the marsh is filled with shorebirds and water fowl , including large flocks of Canada geese that drop_in this time_of_year to feed_on dry lima_beans left after the harvest on nearby fields that the Navy leases to farmers . In all , 155 bird species use the station , said Rodd Kelsey , a biologist who works for the Navy and oversees protection of wildlife on the base . Among his challenges , he said , is dealing with barn owls that raise their young inside some of the partly vacant storage buildings . Another of Kelsey ' s responsibilities , he said , is making certain that those who farm on the base do not endanger the birds by using pesticides or exterminating rodents that the birds depend_on for their diet . Credit for a significant local comeback of two bird species , the California least tern and the light-footed clapper rail , both of which are listed as endangered , is given to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , which since 1972 has operated about 1 # 000 acres of marshland on the base as a national wildlife refuge . While the least tern population at the station dwindled to only five in 1983 , Kelsey said , biologists last spring counted 198 pairs nesting on a man-made island surrounded by electric fencing to protect the terns ' eggs from opossums , skunks , hawks and other predators . Michael Mitchell , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist at the weapons station refuge , said that there has been an even more dramatic rebound of light-footed clapper rails , which over the last eight years have multiplied at the refuge from 10 birds to 150 . Artificial floating nests have been provided to encourage the birds to breed on the water , out of the reach of skunks and opossums . But most importantly , Mitchell said , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service between 1986 and 1993 trapped and removed about 300 red_foxes , a non-native species of fox with a wide-ranging appetite that had been thriving on the endangered birds at the weapons station . * Bloom said the light-footed clapper rail is not the only bird to have benefited from the removal of most of the red_foxes ; so have hawks and other birds_of_prey that no longer have to compete with the foxes for rodents . &quot; It is an ecosystem coming_back into order , &quot; Bloom said . If development plans for the Bolsa Chica wetlands south of the weapons station are implemented , Bloom said , all_of the Bolsa Chica uplands that support birds_of_prey will be destroyed . One result , he said , may be a further increase in the number of hawks in Seal Beach . &quot; However , some of the red-tailed_hawks would not survive the loss of their homes , &quot; he warned . As a result of his findings , Bloom said , he may recommend that the Navy plant at the station native trees such_as sycamores that have natural cavities favored by owls and limbs that other predatory birds can use for roosting , hunting and nesting .</TEXT>
