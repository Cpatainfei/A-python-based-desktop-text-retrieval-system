   <HEADLINE> WILSON SPRINTER IS LIVING IN FAST_LANE ; PREPS : LAKEISHA BACKUS , A RELATIVE NEWCOMER TO TRACK , HAS ALREADY REACHED ELITE STATUS IN THE SPORT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At 5 feet 2 inches , LaKeisha Backus , a self-proclaimed tomboy , learned early that it was speed , not size , that separated her from the field . &quot; I played every sport when I was younger , &quot; said Backus , a 17-year-old who will be a senior at Long_Beach Wilson High in the fall . &quot; I wish I was a little taller , but I don ' t consider it much of a disadvantage. &quot; It certainly wasn ' t a disadvantage for Backus the past track season . In June , she won the State 200-meter title and also joined Michelle Nelson , Mary Harris and Kinshasa Davis on Wilson ' s victorious 400-meter relay team . Last month , Backus timed 22.88 seconds to place second in the 200 at the International Amateur Athletic Federation World Junior Championships at Lisbon , Portugal . Heidi Seyerling of South_Africa nipped Backus at the wire to win the event in 22.80 seconds . The sprinters were aided by a 2.2-meter per second tail wind , nullifying Backus ' time for record purposes . Nonetheless , her time ranks as fourth-fastest by a U.S. high_school athlete under any conditions . Only Marion Jones of Thousand Oaks High , the national record-holder at 22.58 , Chandra Cheesborough ( 22.64 ) , a 1984 Olympic silver medalist at 400 meters , and Wendy Vereen ( 22.75 ) , a member of the 1993 U.S. World Championship team , have run faster . &quot; I felt normal and I didn ' t think I ran that fast , &quot; said Backus , who ran a legal-best of 23.21 at June ' s State meet . &quot; I wasn ' t really worried about my time or intimidated by the competition , I was just glad for the experience to travel outside the United States. &quot; Two months ago , the experience was an unforeseen opportunity for Backus , who has attracted scholarship interest from UCLA , USC , Louisiana State , Arkansas , Tennessee , Nebraska , Indiana and North Carolina . Backus had planned to conclude her season after the state meet . Instead , she accepted an offer to compete the next week in the Golden West Invitational in Sacramento , where she won the 100 and 200 . Then came an invitation to compete in the USATF Junior National Championships at Tallahassee , Fla. , the qualifying meet for the World Junior Championships , in the last week of June . &quot; I worked real hard to win State and after that I was going_to stop , &quot; Backus said . &quot; It has been my longest season and I didn ' t feel that good . I didn ' t really feel I had a 22.88 or a big ( personal record ) in me . I ' m just glad I can take a training break now. &quot; Backus ' performance in Portugal also helped erase a disappointing season in the 100 , her preferred event . She was disqualified for a false start in the Southern Section Division I finals in May . In July , Backus finished seventh in the Junior National meet after she slipped at the start on a rain-slicked track . Backus , however , rebounded to place second in the 200 at the Junior National meet and earn a spot on the U.S. squad . The top three finishers qualified for the national team . &quot; I wanted to qualify in the 100 , &quot; said Backus , who has a best of 11.65 for 100 meters . &quot; I like it because it is shorter and I ' m the kind of runner that likes to get_out hard . But I guess for now , the 200 might be the best race for me. &quot; In the eighth grade , Backus was racing down the football_field as a tailback for a local flag football_team . It was there , she first discovered her talent as a sprinter . In her first season of track , she placed third in the 100 meters in the age 14-15 division in The Athletics Congress national championships competing for the California Flyers track club . Backus also won the 100 and 200 in the Amateur Athletic Union regional and district finals . As a sophomore in 1993 , Backus was fourth in the State meet in the 100 and 200 and lowered her time in the 200 from 25.05 -- her best time as a freshman -- to 23.96 .</TEXT>
