   <HEADLINE> NEW JAPANESE PREMIER NOT EXACTLY GROOMED FOR TOP JOB ; POLITICS : LITTLE STANDS_OUT ABOUT MURAYAMA -- EXCEPT HIS EYEBROWS . THE MODEST LEADER IS NOT KNOWN FOR HIS POLICIES OR AMBITION , BUT IS PRAISED AS A GENIAL MAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When people here talk_about Tomiichi Murayama , the Socialist_Party chairman who stunned the world by winning election Wednesday as Japan ' s new prime_minister , it is not his political philosophy nor his leadership style that invariably merits a mention . It is his enormous , shaggy eyebrows . That facial hair is Murayama ' s single most distinctive characteristic pretty much says it all about this modest , amiable fisherman ' s son who never dreamed of becoming Japan ' s top political_leader and has repeatedly said he is unqualified for the job . On that point , few argue otherwise . Murayama , 70 , has never held a Cabinet post in 39 years of political life . He has never traveled widely in Asia or the United States , his staff says . At a time when the world is pressing Japan to reduce its trade surplus , open its markets and take a greater role in global affairs , Murayama ' s specialty is domestic welfare issues ; his most prominent book to date is titled &quot; Your Pension. &quot; &quot; Most people say he has no leadership and no knowledge about policy , and that is true , &quot; said a Japanese journalist who has covered Murayama for the past two years . &quot; And if a crucial moment occurs on economic or security matters , it is hopeless that Mr. Murayama can do anything. &quot; Murayama is essentially another titular head of another shaky political coalition -- this time a shotgun marriage between erstwhile rivals , the liberal Socialists and the conservative Liberal Democrats . Most analysts believe his administration will collapse in a matter of months and will be remembered merely as another stage in the recasting of Japan ' s political landscape that began last year with the demise of the Liberal Democratic Party ' s 38-year rule . &quot; This is just another part of the power game ; it will last for another one or two years , &quot; the journalist said . Murayama is a left-leaning Socialist , whose party has supported North_Korea , opposed opening Japan ' s agricultural markets , criticized nuclear_energy and objected to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty . Yet those policies are not likely to become the law_of_the_land . The new ruling coalition has already announced that it will maintain previous government policies ; few analysts think coalition leaders would dare renege_on political reform or Japan ' s commitment to open its markets under the so-called Uruguay Round accord . Legislation on both issues will be made final later this summer . And despite the Socialists ' traditional distance from the United States , a party spokesman said that Murayama &quot; has a lot to learn about international politics &quot; and would basically leave foreign_policy to the LDP . &quot; The LDP has good connections to the U.S. and other countries , so on diplomatic policies , I suppose there will be no problem , &quot; the spokesman said . Some argue it doesn ' t particularly matter who becomes prime_minister in Japan because national policy is crafted and executed not by politicians but by bureaucrats . Japan ' s new prime_minister is a native of a small fishing village in Oita prefecture in the southern island of Kyushu . Born March 3 , 1924 , he is the seventh of 11 children . He devoted himself to the labor_movement after watching his mother struggle in poverty peddling fish after her husband died while Murayama was a junior_high_school student , according to Japanese press reports . A graduate of a two-year program in politics and economics at Meiji University , Murayama has devoted his entire career to being a Socialist_Party politician . He worked his way up from city councilman in 1955 to prefectural assemblyman in 1963 to the lower house of Parliament in 1972 , where he is now serving his seventh term . He was in the army in World_War_II but quickly joined the postwar democracy movement . He says the most moving moment of his life came shortly after the war , when he listened to a fiery speech by a writer , Hitoshi Yamakawa , who declared Japan was poised on the doorstep of great change toward becoming a democratic nation . Since then , Murayama has been an avid opponent of moves to strengthen Japan ' s military . He engineered the famous &quot; cow walk &quot; tactic a_few years ago -- in which opposition party members took an interminable time walking to the ballot_box to try to block passage of a bill to dispatch Japanese Self-Defense Forces overseas to aid in U.N. peacekeeping activities . The maneuver failed , however . He is most favorably known for his geniality and ability to bring people together across party_lines . He honed that skill as the Socialist chairman of the parliamentary affairs committee from 1991 , working closely with his LDP counterpart . Murayama is also strikingly unambitious , a quality that has kept him from making enemies . He wanted to retire last July but ran again when his supporters begged him to . When he was tapped to become Socialist chairman last year , he said he had neither the desire nor ability for the job . And when he was approached to run_for prime_minister as the candidate of the LDP-Socialist-New Party Harbinger alliance , he was so shocked he asked , &quot; What country are you talking_about ? &quot; In contrast to the glamorous Morihiro Hosokawa -- who donned Armani ties , sported hair implants and carefully managed his media image as the first coalition government ' s prime_minister -- Murayama is resolutely anti-chic . When asked why he doesn ' t trim his bushy eyebrows , he told reporters : &quot; I don ' t care about my appearance . Natural is best. &quot; He told one Japanese journalist he did not want to move_into the prime_minister ' s residence because he would no longer be able to cook for himself or wash his own socks . He performs such pedestrian chores while living alone in the small , two-bedroom apartment provided to Parliament members . In keeping with the traditional role of the Japanese political spouse , Murayama ' s wife , Yoshie , 71 , stays behind in his Oita district . The couple has two daughters ; Murayama says his life ' s greatest pleasure is playing with his two grandchildren . He is often called the &quot; good grandpa &quot; in press reports . Murayama ' s resume lists reading and theater as his hobbies . But when queried , a staff_member responded : &quot; Well , he doesn ' t really have any hobbies. &quot; But he has a motto : &quot; Always remain with the people and learn from them. &quot; Unlike other prime_ministers , Murayama will almost certainly not be hounded from office over corruption charges . He lists no stock , no debt and total assets of $ 336 # 000 . Profile : Tomiichi Murayama Title : Prime_minister of Japan Born : March 3 , 1924 , in Oita prefecture on Kyushu island .
