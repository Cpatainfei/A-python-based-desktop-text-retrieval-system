   <HEADLINE> U.N. GENERAL_ASSEMBLY VOTES TO LIFT BOSNIA ARMS BAN ; BALKANS : BUT ONLY THE SECURITY_COUNCIL HAS ENFORCEMENT POWERS . JUST A THIRD OF ITS MEMBERS CAST BALLOTS FOR THE MEASURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.N. General_Assembly passed a U.S.-endorsed resolution Thursday calling_for the lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina in six months , but the vote only exposed the weakness of the American position . The General_Assembly has no powers of enforcement , and its resolution amounts only to a recommendation that the Security_Council , which does have such powers , lift the ban . Despite a vote of 97 to with 61 abstentions , the balloting made_it clear that an American anti-embargo resolution now before the Security_Council would fail if put to a vote . Only five members of the Security_Council -- Djibouti , Oman , Pakistan , Rwanda and the United States -- voted for the General_Assembly resolution . The 10 other members -- Britain , France , Russia , China , Spain , the Czech Republic , Argentina , Brazil , Nigeria and New Zealand -- abstained . If that vote were repeated in the Security_Council , the resolution would be defeated , since a resolution needs nine affirmative votes to pass . In view of this certain defeat , most U.N. diplomats believe that American Ambassador Madeleine Albright , who is the president of the Security_Council this month , will refrain_from submitting her resolution to a vote . Abandonment of the measure would reflect the frayed state of U.S. policy on Bosnia . The Clinton_Administration insists that more pressure must be put_on the Bosnian Serbs to persuade them to accept a peace pact that would roll back some of their gains on the battlefield . But the Administration has failed to convince its most important allies to join in most of the pressure . American frustration over this failure was made clear by Albright , who told the General_Assembly , &quot; Today the Bosnian Serbs are the lone holdout against peace . They alone have said ' no ' to ending this barbarous war . Unfortunately , the consequences for them of their rejection have not been sufficiently grave . . . . &quot; Economic sanctions have not been tight enough , &quot; she went_on , &quot; enforcement of safe havens and exclusive zones has not been robust enough , and diplomatic pressures not united or consistent enough to bring the Bosnian Serbs to a new level of insight . &quot; We must do more to make them understand that settlement is their best and only option. &quot; Albright ' s plea did not sway America ' s European allies . Most do not take the Administration ' s anti-embargo campaign very seriously because they know it has been forced upon the White_House by Congress . Under a law passed in the last session , the United States was forced to submit the resolution to the Security_Council . If the resolution is not passed_by Nov . 15 , the legislation prohibits the Administration from using federal funds to enforce the embargo . German Ambassador Detlev Graf zu Rantzau , speaking on behalf of the European Union , told the General_Assembly that its 12 members abstained because they were &quot; seriously concerned by the consequences of lifting the arms embargo. &quot; Three members of the union sit on the Security_Council . &quot; We consider that a political settlement should be pursued until all avenues are exhausted , &quot; Graf zu Rantzau said . &quot; That stage has not been reached. &quot; In an impassioned speech to the General_Assembly , Bosnian Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey defied the threat of Britain and France to withdraw their peacekeepers from the U.N. mission in Bosnia if the ban is lifted . The British and French contend that otherwise their troops would be too easily exposed to retaliation from Bosnian Serb forces . &quot; If given the option between the continuing role of ( U.N. peacekeepers ) and the effective lifting of the arms embargo on our government , &quot; he said , &quot; we choose the option of directly addressing the continuing root causes and aggression by the lifting of the arms embargo. &quot; Sacirbey also painted a lurid picture of Srebrenica , the Muslim enclave that had been declared a &quot; safe haven &quot; by the United Nations more_than a year ago . He accused the Serbs of preventing &quot; essential hygiene ( products ) and nutrients necessary for survival &quot; from reaching the enclave . Those in the safe area are being denied salt , soap and detergent , he said . As a result of this &quot; new technique of ' ethnic cleansing ' and slow-motion murder , &quot; Sacirbey said , &quot; the civilians are suffering from horrendous diseases not lately seen in civilization. &quot;</TEXT>
