   <TEXT> I must comment on the Nov . 6 article regarding humane officers . The overall impression left by the article discounted the dedication of humane officers who monitor and eradicate cruelty to animals , overlooked the risks that these officers undergo when they infiltrate a dogfighting ring , disregarded the fact that humane officers partner with other peace_officers in their efforts to combat violence in our community and ignored the fact that they serve as educators , career models , rescuers ( they are willing to hang off a cliff to rescue somebody ' s injured dog ) and disaster relief workers . Instead , the article focused_on the negative and exceptional aspects of this system . Even within this imperfect system , most California humane officers employed by reputable organizations receive training in excess of that mandated by the new law and could withstand scrutiny of any oversight board . In fact , it was the reputable organizations that joined together and demanded the more stringent regulations . While I think it is essential that we constantly re-evaluate our programs to best fulfill our missions , it is also essential to keep a sense of perspective on the issue . This type of an article can do damage to those of us who exist on financial contributions and donations based upon our meritorious performances in the field . Such an article can impede the progress of our organizations , damage the reputation of humane officers at_large , and give publicity and credibility to those who deserve it the least .
