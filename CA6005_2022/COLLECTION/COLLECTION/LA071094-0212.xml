   <TEXT> * Too_bad it took a drive-by_shooting to find_out about the Watts matriarch May Dunkentall ( July 2 ) .Why don ' t we read about such colorful community figures before they die ? I live_in a &quot; good area , &quot; Playa del Rey , yet no one cooks soul food for the neighborhood . Dunkentall did more for Watts than all_the city politicians and bureaucrats combined . She showed she cared , she created community . More articles about people like her , community heroes , would encourage more people to follow her role_model . I ' d like to see an article about a community hero on the front page every day . DAVID QUESTON Santa Monica</TEXT>
