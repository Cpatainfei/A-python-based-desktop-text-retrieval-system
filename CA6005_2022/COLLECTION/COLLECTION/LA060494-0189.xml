   <HEADLINE> PUBLISHING EXEC EXPECTED TO BE HOLLYWOOD PICTURES CHIEF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Michael Lynton , a top_executive from Disney ' s Hyperion Press publishing unit in New York , is expected to be named the new head of Hollywood Pictures , sources confirmed Friday . The Walt Disney Co. , under which Hollywood Pictures hangs its banner , is currently in intense contract negotiations with Lynton and his announcement could come as early as next week when details of his deal are hammered_out , sources said. &quot; It ' s between days and weeks , &quot; an insider noted . Lynton has been house-hunting in the Los Angeles area , sources confirmed , and Disney officials are now looking_for his replacement at Hyperion Press . With his background in publishing instead of movie-making , some film_industry observers were surprised that his name surfaced in April after Ricardo Mestres stepped_down as president of Hollywood and became a producer on the lot . &quot; Nobody else ( inside Disney ) wanted it , &quot; said one film_industry source with knowledge of the studio hierarchy . &quot; I hear they are very serious about putting ( Lynton ) in there. &quot; Unlike Mestres , Lynton would take his marching orders from his close friend David Hoberman , who was elevated to the post of president of motion_pictures for the Walt Disney Studios when Mestres departed . Hoberman , in turn , answers to the real power at Disney , studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg . Under Mestres , Hollywood Pictures struggled to make hits , releasing a string of lackluster films from &quot; Super Mario Bros. &quot; to &quot; Swing Kids. &quot; Ironically , Hollywood Pictures is expecting a better year in 1994 , with this summer ' s Pauly Shore comedy &quot; In the Army Now &quot; and this fall ' s Robert Redford drama &quot; Quiz Show. &quot;</TEXT>
