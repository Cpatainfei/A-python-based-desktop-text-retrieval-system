   <HEADLINE> NO AMNESTY FOR PERPETRATORS OF BALKANS ATROCITIES , U.S. SAYS ; WARFARE : ENVOY COMMENTS AFTER VISITING A MASS GRAVE . SHE VOWS CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR WAR_CRIMES TRIBUNAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright vowed Thursday after inspecting a mass grave in Serbian-occupied Croatia that the United States will never allow amnesty for those who have committed atrocities in the former Yugoslav federation , even as the price for a Balkan peace settlement . The U.S._government also pledged $ 25 million in new support for a war_crimes tribunal intended to try those suspected of crimes against humanity in this region still torn by nationalist war . The contribution is likely to breathe some life into the 11-judge panel based in The Hague that was proclaimed by the U.N. Security_Council last year but was granted few resources and little authority to pursue suspects . Albright ' s visit to the mass grave at Ovcara , a stretch of desolate , refuse-strewn farmland where at least 200 Croatian hospital patients are believed to have been executed and buried two years ago , was intended to underscore U.S. commitment to the international quest_for justice in the Balkans . &quot; Seeing it there was a stark reminder of the horrors of this war , &quot; said Albright , the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit any part of the former Yugoslav federation since hostilities broke_out more_than 2 1 / 2 years ago . &quot; The fact that people suffer and then end_up in something that is basically a garbage_dump is symbolic of the tragedies of this country and other parts of former Yugoslavia. &quot; While Albright ' s push for pursuit of war_criminals demonstrated U.S. concern on humanitarian issues , it came at a time when European leaders are threatening a pullout from U.N. peacekeeping efforts and demanding more direct American military involvement to end the conflict . Her presence here has served to spotlight Washington ' s biggest foreign_policy crisis and its ongoing dispute with NATO allies just as President Clinton embarks on his first European tour . Albright , declaring the prosecution of war_crimes &quot; an integral part of the peace process &quot; and vital to fostering any postwar recovery , said the United States will never allow the tribunal to be negotiated out of existence , as proposed by Serbs at Geneva peace talks . To emphasize Washington ' s commitment to the tribunal , John Shattuck , the assistant secretary_of_state for human_rights , announced that the U.S._government is making another $ 25 million in professional services available to the court . The contribution will ensure that the tribunal &quot; gets_off to a strong start , &quot; Shattuck said , calling_on other countries to ante_up similar support for the first such panel since the Nuremberg court that prosecuted Nazi war_criminals after World_War_II . The United States and its West European allies have sharp differences in their policies toward the former Yugoslav federation , with the Clinton_Administration still smarting over British and French refusal to back Washington ' s proposals for stopping the war still raging in Bosnia-Herzegovina . Clinton last spring called_for air strikes against Serbian gunners besieging the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo and for a lifting of the U.N. arms embargo that has prevented only the forces of the Muslim-led government from acquiring weapons to defend the country . Since West European allies nixed the U.S. &quot; lift and strike &quot; proposal , Britain , France , Canada and Spain have threatened to pull their troops out of Bosnia because they are increasingly endangered by the raging conflict they have no mandate to stop . The 12 # 000 U.N. troops deployed in Bosnia are assigned only to escort humanitarian aid . French Defense Minister Francois Leotard stepped_up the pressure on Washington earlier this week by announcing that he will appeal at the forthcoming North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization summit for deployment of U.S. military_forces to Bosnia to back_up existing U.N. forces . The United States has refused to commit ground troops to the Bosnian conflict unless all three warring factions endorse a peace plan . * Albright , asked how the U.S._government will respond to calls_for more direct involvement , insisted it is already demonstrating sufficient commitment , especially on humanitarian issues . &quot; We are the ones , as you can tell , that are pushing very hard on the war_crimes tribunal , and we are also holding steadfast on the sanctions , so the United States is very much involved in this situation , &quot; she said , sidestepping any mention of contributing troops . The American ambassador to Croatia , Peter Galbraith , accompanied Albright and Shattuck to the Serbian-occupied territory and was the one who conducted the discussions with rebel authorities -- to avoid , as one U.S. official explained , meeting with the renegades at &quot; too high a level. &quot; The self-styled president of the Serbian-occupied region known as the Krajina , Goran Hadzic , conceded during the talks that Serbs have committed war_crimes and even offered to turn_over some unspecified suspects for prosecution , Galbraith said . But in light of previous pledges of assistance from the rebels in Western attempts to resolve the Balkan crisis , the U.S. officials seemed to hold_out little expectation of cooperation . More_than a year ago , American forensics specialist Clyde Snow examined some remains at the Ovcara site , and his preliminary conclusions prompted a U.N. war_crimes investigative team to order a thorough probe of the grave ' s contents . But Serbian nationalist gunmen who have occupied one-third of Croatia , including the area around Ovcara , near Vukovar on the eastern border , threatened the U.N. exhumation team at gunpoint and have blocked further probes .</TEXT>
