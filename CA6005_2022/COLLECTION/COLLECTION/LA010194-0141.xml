   <HEADLINE> ' SCHINDLER ' RESONATES ON L.A. ' S STREETS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I have just seen what I consider to be one of the most startling and brutally effective films of my recent memory , a film that is unrelenting in its realistic details , yet touching and life affirming and , yes , even entertaining . It is an extremely violent film , yet a film that neither glamorizes nor romanticizes violence . This is a cry of awakening , of reaffirmation , for here is a film that can take one of the ugliest events on the human soul and still find a joy of being . This film achieves verisimilitude . Yet , ironically , &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; was directed by the same man , Steven Spielberg , who created the &quot; Indiana Jones &quot; trilogy , which dehumanizes the killing of humans by clever and entertainingly choreographed and stylized violence . There are no consequences to death in the kind of films the &quot; Indiana Jones &quot; trilogy represents ; no one is affected by the killing , and the bodies are never disposed_of . The emphasis is_on violent action , not its consequence ; we look_at its doing , not the result . As I sat and watched scene after scene of mindless horror in &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; I was struck by a comparison to the mindless violence on our streets . Just as the German guards looked_upon Jews as non-human , the drive-bys and automatic and semiautomatic weapons dehumanizingly distance attackers from victims . It is parents and friends who see the carnage and have to deal with it . I hope the transformation of such directors as Spielberg and Clint Eastwood ( who demythologized violence in &quot; Unforgiven &quot; ) will kill the romanticizing of violence in our popular art . MICHAEL VETRIE , Sylmar I have no doubt that the &quot; Schindler &quot; story has provided Spielberg the vehicle for attempting to preserve a profound human experience that he has known all his life he must somehow try to present . And I am reasonably certain he also knows that every_other knowledgeable co-religionist must also have been constantly bedeviled by the urge to relate this episode of human depravity so as_to alert others to the threat . Spielberg must be thanking God that he has been given this opportunity . WILLARD LEVIN , Rancho Palos Verdes Spielberg has done_it again ; creating a cinematic masterpiece . Like most people , this film outraged me . It is difficult to believe that these events actually took_place . I am writing this letter to ask both Universal Pictures and their distributors to make this film available to schools , civic groups and all educational outlets so that everyone can learn more about this unfortunate period in our history . TOM CHALTAS , Studio City Work for Health Coverage Regarding the Dec . 22 article &quot; Will Work for Health Coverage , &quot; concerning Lee Mathis , the healthy HIV-positive actor who placed an ad in Daily Variety seeking employment in_order to maintain his Screen Actors Guild health_insurance : While I certainly can sympathize_with Mathis ' plight and admire his courage for coming_forth so publicly , I couldn ' t help but think how ironic it is that someone like myself who is fortunate enough to be in relatively good_health and to work in the entertainment_industry has no health coverage . I am one of thousands of assistants in this industry who work without any health_insurance from either the company or the trade_unions . I am extremely grateful to have a steady job in these difficult economic times , especially in a business that I love , but if I were to suddenly find myself facing a life-threatening disease I would not be able to appeal_to anyone . As many entertainment companies continue to make cutbacks in employee benefits , my situation is , sadly , far from unique . BILL NORMYLE , Los Angeles Look , I ' ve been lucky . Through the Writers Guild and SAG , I ' ve had health_insurance for a long_time . It ' s covered everything from the birth of my children to cosmetic chin repair from a racquetball -- yes , racquetball -- accident . Now my coverage is expired . Why ? Maybe because my last script sales were options , not hired work that counts toward coverage , or maybe because the free-lance hour writing market has shrunk , or maybe I ' m too ugly to get an acting job . . . . I don ' t know . But , if my health coverage is restored , it ' ll be through my talent , persistence and luck , not because I whine publicly about my hard_times . Who made this guy or any of us enter a chance business ? PAUL EHRMANN , Santa Monica that ' s in Bad Taste Concerning &quot; After Brenda , Whither Shannen ? &quot; ( Dec . 23 ) , regarding Shannen Doherty and a list of work she could do after leaving &quot; Beverly Hills , 90210 , &quot; among them was : &quot; Perhaps the Jim Rose Circus Sideshow will have an opening for the Incredible Crooked Eyeball Lady. &quot; I am a professional comedy writer , and I find this to be in exceedingly bad taste . To suggest , even in apparent fun , that people with physical abnormalities should be hustled off to circus sideshows is abhorrent . DOUGLAS WYMAN , Studio City Photo Diminishes Actor Give us a break : Your Dec . 14 article on Wes Studi is acceptable ; the photo by Tony Barnard and whoever made the selection is not ( &quot; I Came Into the Business at the Right Time &quot; ) . That boudoir shot of Studi is ridiculous . He is an actor and not Geronimo , but he has a commanding presence that you have totally negated . Truman Capote he ' s not . Americans today are attempting to restore dignity to the Native_Americans we have damaged . Your photo doesn ' t help . PANO DOUROS , Venice ' Hemingway ' Exhilarates I had just come from seeing &quot; Wrestling Ernest Hemingway. &quot; I was exhilarated . Then I read Peter Rainer ' s review ( &quot; Actors Over the Top in ' Hemingway , ' &quot; Dec . 17 ) . I read it three times to make_sure we ' d seen the same film . First I was amazed , then annoyed , then worried . I was worried that someone would read such phrases as &quot; life-affirming mush &quot; ( what does that mean ? ) and &quot; soppy cantankerous coots &quot; and deprive him / herself of seeing a wonderful , emotion-filled story . Robert Duvall , Richard Harris and director Randa Haines have made some deliberate choices that this viewer thinks work . If this movie slobbers , it can slobber on my shoulder any time ! LYNN ROTH , Los Angeles Las Vegas Theme Park The MGM Grand Theme Park , part of the MGM Grand Casino and Hotel complex , is an absolutely dismal attempt at Las Vegas ' first theme park . It has just six rides , featuring two especially horrible ones . One is the Lightning Bolt , a lame and very short rip-off of Disneyland ' s Space Mountain ; the other is the Haunted Mine , a very unpleasant trip through an abandoned mine filled with skeletons . The major portion of the park features some cheesy movie-set streets and numerous snack_bars . A few of the stores feature some nice items ( such_as animation cels ) . Southern California may no longer be the aerospace center of the nation , but its supremacy in theme parks remains unchallenged ! MATTHEW OKADA , Pasadena</TEXT>
