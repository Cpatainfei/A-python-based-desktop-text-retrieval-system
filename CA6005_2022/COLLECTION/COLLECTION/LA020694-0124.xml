   <HEADLINE> GOING WHERE FEW ROADS GO ; SHIPS EXPLORE CORNERS OF THE 49THSTATE THAT can ' t BE REACHED BY CAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you spread_out a map of Alaska and study the veined lines that denote highways , you ' ll see how little of that vast state can be reached by road . But traveling_by sea opens_up much more of the state . Over the years , we ' ve stepped off cruise_ships and into the hearts of communities from Dutch Harbor in the Aleutians to Barrow , far above the Arctic_Circle , and from the Inside Passage ' s southeasternmost port of Ketchikan to Little Diomede Island in the middle of the Bering Strait . Two midsummer cruises aboard Clipper Adventure Cruises ' 140-passenger World Discoverer ( July 8 and Aug . 9 ) will take you to the wind-swept cliffs of the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea , where cartoon-faced horned and tufted_puffins stare comically down from their ledge perches and thousands of fur_seals tumble in the icy water among the rocks and kelp . There are Arctic_foxes , not white in summer but coal_black , looking_like small furry dogs , and bald_eagles soaring lazily above the sea . The ship also visits Katmai National_Park , where Katmai brown_bear can be glimpsed fishing for spawning salmon , and Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island in the Aleutians , nearer Japan and Russia than Washington and Oregon . Almost everyone in Dutch Harbor works for one of the Japanese-owned fish-packing plants and lives in community housing . Each employee shares a 12-by-12-foot room and bath with one roommate and is fed_in a central dining hall at 6 a.m. , noon , 6 p.m. and midnight , since work goes_on around the clock during the short but busy season . The 188-passenger Hanseatic , a recently built state-of-the-art expedition vessel marketed in the United States by Seven Seas Cruises , will set_out Aug . 18 from Greenland for an east-to-west transit of the rarely visited Northwest Passage . Should the transit be successful in getting_through the ice , it will visit Barrow , Pt . Hope , Little Diomede , Nome , Dutch Harbor and Homer before arriving in Anchorage Sept . 14 . If not , it will turn_around and visit other ports_of_call . * One of the last great seagoing adventures , the Northwest Passage transit by passenger_ship has been successful only six times prior to this attempt , the first in 1984 from east to west . In 1985 , on the first west-to-east transit , we sailed aboard the World Discoverer through a world of fire and ice in the Beaufort Sea , surrounded by a surrealist fantasy of towering frozen cliffs on one side and the glittering sand-colored skyscrapers of an Arctic Manhattan , twinkling with lights and belching flames , on the other . A mirage effect called &quot; looming &quot; made the frozen cliffs reflect against themselves in the sunlight , and the &quot; city &quot; of the oil platforms and administration buildings at Prudhoe Bay reflect upside-down and right-side-up in several layers as if suspended in gray aspic between sea and sky . Along the way , we visited sparsely settled villages in the Alaskan and Canadian Arctic , and went ashore at Beechey Island to see graves from the tragic 19th-Century Franklin Expedition . Zodiac landing_craft took us close to icebergs off Greenland and unexplored inlets along Baffin Bay . But while a_few of Alaska ' s seagoing visitors this summer will be aboard expedition ships and more casual vessels that offer alternative shipboard lifestyles and explore off-the-beaten-track areas , most will opt_for classic , mainstream cruise_ships with professional entertainment , dress-up evenings and spa and exercise programs . With 32 vessels cruising Alaska this summer , offering some 25 % more beds than last summer , the range of choices is wider than ever for passengers considering a first , or even second or third , Alaska cruise . Better still , early bookings earn discounts or special bonuses . Alaska-bound vacationers can select theme cruises that range ofrom country-Western and square_dance sailings to photography workshops and big-band sounds , or opt_for a luxury rail trip in a dome car through pristine Alaskan wilderness . They can go_in search of moose and musk_ox in Denali National_Park , traveling between Anchorage and Fairbanks by train , or climb aboard the historic narrow-gauge White Pass &amp; Yukon Railway in Skagway for a trip_up to Dead Horse Pass and the 1898 gold-rush trail to the Klondike . They can hoot and holler in a turn-of-the-century saloon with sawdust on the floor and dancing girls by the piano , cheer for the hero and boo the villain in a melodrama , or recite &quot; The Shooting of Dan McGrew &quot; with a Robert Service look-alike . They can book a combination cruise / RV overland vacation , or stay before or after the cruise in a private fishing lodge_in a national_park . They can cruise fiords and glaciers by day and sleep overnight in a shore-side hotel , or take an inflatable Zodiac landing_craft into remote waters to watch Alaska brown_bears fishing for salmon . The average Alaska cruise passenger is getting younger . Bill Pedlar , vice_president of marketing and sales for Princess Tours , an affiliate of Princess Cruises , estimates the average visitor ' s age at 50 , compared to 58 or 59 a decade ago . Of the 19 large mainstream vessels scheduled to cruise Alaska this summer , three will be shiny 1993-model ships : Holland America Line ' s 1 # 266-passenger Maasdam , which made its debut in December ; Cunard ' s 800-passenger Crown Dynasty , which was christened last July , and Norwegian Cruise Line ' s 1 # 246-passenger Windward , which entered service in June . Itineraries are about evenly divided between the classic Inside Passage seven-day cruise -- with many vessels sailing into Glacier Bay -- and the Gulf of Alaska seven-day cruise , which includes cruising past Columbia Glacier with an option to visit Anchorage . A few ships -- Cunard ' s Sagafjord , Royal Caribbean Cruise Line ' s Sun Viking and Princess Cruises ' Fair Princess ( which sails on 10-day round_trips from San Francisco ) -- offer sailings of 10 or 11 days . While both itineraries include cruise-by looks_at glaciers , passengers should bear_in_mind that the bigger the ship , the further away from the ice it has to stay . Many large cruise_ships , such_as those from Holland America , offer alternative small-boat glacier cruises as part of add-on land packages . Counted among the alternative vessels , which usually number about a dozen , is one large ship , the 540-passenger Universe from World Explorer . A seagoing university in winter , the Universe offers a 12 # 000-volume library , a roster of expert lecturers and a 14-day cruise that covers nine ports_of_call , plus Glacier Bay , Columbia Glacier and the Kenai Fjords . The biggest operator in the small-ship field is Alaska Sightseeing / Cruise West with six small_ships , including the 90-passenger Sheltered Seas , which cruises by day and takes passengers to shore-side hotels overnight . Clipper Adventure Cruises ' World Discoverer and its 138-passenger Yorktown Clipper both sail the Inside Passage , Gulf of Alaska and British_Columbia ' s Queen Charlotte Islands . The ships emphasize the flora and fauna of the region , with frequent forays in rubberized Zodiac landing_craft . Special Expeditions takes its 70-passenger sister_ships Sea_Lion and Sea_Bird , equipped with Zodiac landing_craft , into hidden areas of Alaska ' s coastal wilderness in search of humpback_whales , bald_eagles and sea_lions . One new option for Alaska cruises is a combination cruise and overland recreational_vehicle vacation with Holland America and Alaska Highway Cruises . A number of options are available , all combining a seven-day cruise with a seven- or 14-day overland drive . Alaska Highway Cruises has 100 new Class C cab-over vehicles sleeping from two to six persons , and will provide reserved campground spots , maps and other travel information . Most Alaska-bound cruise lines are offering early-booking incentives . For example , book 120 days ahead of the sailing date with Cunard ' s Sagafjord or Crown Dynasty and get a 15 % discount on the cruise fare . Book five months in_advance with World Explorer ' s Universe and earn a three-day Vancouver stay or a two-day Seattle stay before or after the cruise .
