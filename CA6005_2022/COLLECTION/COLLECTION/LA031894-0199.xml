   <HEADLINE> SIMI MAN , 71 , DIES OF VALLEY_FEVER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 71-year-old Simi Valley man has died of Valley_fever , a respiratory illness that may have been caused by the Northridge earthquake , health officials said . Eugene Walter Cole , a retired maintenance worker , was diagnosed in February with the disease , which is contracted by breathing airborne spores that grow in the soil . He died March 2 in a North Hollywood hospital . Health officials have speculated that the Jan . 17 earthquake kicked_up fungus-laden dust that has infected residents in the San Fernando Valley and eastern half of Ventura County . The Centers_for_Disease_Control has reported 170 cases of Valley_fever in Ventura County since the earthquake , more_than half of them in Simi Valley , said Gary Feldman , director of the Ventura County Department of Health . Cole ' s death is the only reported fatality , health officials said . &quot; There was a lot of dust all_over Simi Valley , maybe this was why he was infected , &quot; said Rana Hajjeh , an epidemiologist with the Atlanta-based Centers_for_Disease_Control , who added that Cole had other health_problems that might have put him at risk . &quot; He was a diabetic , and diabetes sometimes can weaken your immune response. &quot; Cole ' s wife , Hazel , said her husband had a high fever and flu-like symptoms when he went_to the emergency_room Feb . 10 . He was sent home after being diagnosed with pneumonia . Two days later , he returned to the hospital with a 103.6-degree fever and was admitted . &quot; When he left , he just said , ' See you tonight or in a_couple_of days. ' that ' s how sure he was that it wasn ' t serious , &quot; Hazel Cole said . He weakened quickly , however , in the hospital and died March 2 . &quot; It just took_over , &quot; said Cole ' s stepson , Raymond Dempsey . &quot; The doctors tried everything they could to stop it . But it just spread so fast . Like wildfire . We knew it was just a matter of time. &quot; Dempsey , who also lives_in Simi Valley , said family members immediately suspected the earthquake was to blame for Cole ' s illness . &quot; Every time the ground shook , you could see the dust rising from the_hills , &quot; he said . &quot; The grayish , black clouds were everywhere. &quot; Feldman said the health department , which is investigating a possible link between the earthquake and the rise in Valley_fever cases , plans to test 450 randomly selected Simi Valley residents to determine the magnitude of exposure in that area . &quot; One of the things we ' re trying to find_out is what the base infection rate is , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re trying to find_out to what degree the earthquake has contributed to the outbreak of Valley_fever . This is truly a new phenomenon , that is to say there ' s never been an outbreak attributed to an earthquake. &quot; Feldman said those who test positive for Valley_fever would be interviewed &quot; to look_at factors they were exposed to. &quot; Although the number of Valley_fever cases for Ventura County is dramatically above normal -- there were only 52 cases reported in 1993 , according to the Centers_for_Disease_Control -- health officials stress that death is uncommon . &quot; Even ( among ) those people who were_sick enough to come_to medical attention , very severe illness or fatality is quite rare , &quot; Feldman said . &quot; To the ordinary person , the risk is really quite low , so_much so that most people don ' t realize they have it. &quot; Patients with Valley_fever report flu-like symptoms such_as headaches , coughs , fatigue and muscle aches , said Susan Reef , a physician with the Centers_for_Disease_Control . &quot; I think what is important to know is that 60 % ( of those infected ) have no symptoms , &quot; Reef said . &quot; Only 0.5 -- that ' s less than 1 % -- have the form that goes throughout the body. &quot; But health officials are taking_note anyway . The Centers_for_Disease_Control , which has set_up a Valley_fever hot_line , released a report Thursday that addresses the outbreak of the disease . The hot_line number is ( 404 ) 332-4554 . &quot; The increase in cases follows the Jan . 17 earthquake centered in Northridge , which may have exposed Ventura County residents to increased levels of airborne dust , &quot; the report states . &quot; The California Department of Health Services , local public agencies and the CDC are conducting an investigation to determine the magnitude of the outbreak , risk factors for infection and its possible association with the Northridge earthquake. &quot; The Ventura County Health Department ' s Simi Valley study could begin as early as Monday , Feldman said . &quot; we ' ll do a skin_test first ( that ) shows whether a person has ever had experience with Valley_fever , &quot; he said . Those who test positive will be asked to take a blood_test that would indicate the time of exposure . Feldman said it will take the department about a week to conduct interviews and tests . County health officials don ' t expect to have any conclusions for at least two months , he said . Times staff writers Tina Daunt and Sara Catania contributed to this story .</TEXT>
