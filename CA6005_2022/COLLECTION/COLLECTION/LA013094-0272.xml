   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL , PLO TRY TO PATCH_UP PEACE PACT ; MIDEAST : BOTH SIDES SAY THEY ARE READY TO COMPROMISE AS THEY MEET AT SWISS RESORT . BUT NO ONE IS MAKING ANY PROMISES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Faced with a prolonged impasse in their negotiations on a program to implement Palestinian self-government , Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization are attempting again this weekend to resolve the issues that stand_in the way of a settlement . PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres met for more_than four hours late Saturday and planned further talks today , with both sides declaring their readiness for compromise . Both sides &quot; are making an effort , both have taken a_couple_of steps_forward , &quot; Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said . &quot; We are not yet at an agreement , but there is a very good atmosphere. &quot; The two delegations appointed a small drafting committee to work_through the night in an effort to strike a deal that would satisfy each side ' s political needs . &quot; I would not say we have an agreement , but there is an atmosphere of compromise and an atmosphere of trying to work things out , &quot; said Yasser Abed-Rabbo , a member of the PLO Executive Committee . Although Arafat and Peres had reached some broad understandings a week ago in Oslo , negotiators found themselves unable to put these into writing during further talks in Cairo . &quot; We shall try to sign an agreement , but nobody can promise ahead of time , &quot; Peres said before the meeting with Arafat . &quot; We have a lot of hard work ahead . I just hope for the best. &quot; Upon his arrival at this ski resort high in the_Swiss Alps , Arafat was equally downbeat . Asked if he thought agreement could be reached , Arafat said simply : &quot; I hope so . we ' ll see. &quot; Arafat and Peres were meeting in_advance of a joint appearance today before the World Economic Forum , a privately organized annual gathering of government and business_leaders . There are two basic issues before the men : * Control of the border crossings from Jordan and Egypt into the regions that will become autonomous under the basic agreement between Israel and the PLO . Israel insists for security reasons that it be able to inspect all travelers and their baggage . The PLO argues that it should control entry into the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho and that Israel should limit its security checks . Israel counters that the PLO wants trappings of statehood -- and that this is more_than it can accept . * The size of the autonomous Jericho District on the West_Bank . Israel is offering 22 square_miles and insisting there will be no more . The PLO wants 85 square_miles , and it is asking_for access to the Dead_Sea and control over areas where there are Jewish settlements -- though not control of the settlements themselves . Also on the table , however , are security arrangements for the 5 # 000 settlers living_in the Gaza Strip and half_a_dozen other issues with political implications , according to Israeli and Arab diplomats . The failure to reach agreement on these questions has held_up completion of the detailed program to implement the autonomy accord signed_in September . As a result , Israel ' s troop withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho has been delayed . Israeli sources indicated Saturday night that Israel might agree to some of the border arrangements desired by the PLO in return for greater security measures to protect the Gaza settlers . However , Arab diplomats familiar_with the negotiations in Cairo last week said the gaps are wide , and Palestinians added that outside mediators such_as Norway , which helped Israel and the PLO reach their basic accord , might have to help . Arafat met before dawn Saturday with the PLO Executive Committee before leaving his headquarters in Tunis , Tunisia , according to Palestinian sources , and then saw the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia to request American assistance in breaking the deadlock . Israeli officials with Peres were even less encouraging , predicting that several more meetings could be needed . &quot; There are lots of baskets of differences , &quot; Peres said Saturday as he trudged through the snow back to his hotel from the Davos conference_center . He had told Israeli television on Friday that he had come &quot; with a will to sign &quot; an agreement with Arafat on the outstanding issues , but he warned : &quot; There is a possibility that we will only discuss . &quot; I would like the progress_to be significant , but I also am aware of the difficulties , &quot; Peres said . &quot; We are handling negotiations with emotional significance between people , negotiations that touch_on difficult sensitivities . &quot; Every word has a different repercussion . All this means crossing oceans , doubts , fears and difficulties. &quot; Scheduled to join Arafat and Peres in addressing the World Economic Forum on &quot; Cementing Peace in the Middle_East &quot; are Crown_Prince Hassan of Jordan , Foreign Minister Amir Moussa of Egypt and Joan Spero , U.S. undersecretary of state for economic affairs .</TEXT>
