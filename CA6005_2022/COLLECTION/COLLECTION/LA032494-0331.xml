   <HEADLINE> NOVELL CAST AS UNDERDOG IN FIGHT WITH MICROSOFT ; SOFTWARE : COMPETITION BETWEEN THE TWO IS NOTHING NEW , BUT THE PROPOSED MERGER WOULD CHANGE THE DYNAMICS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Novell Inc. ' s plan to buy WordPerfect Corp . sets_up a dogfight with Microsoft Corp . that could leave all sides battered . The question is whether Novell will survive the struggle . &quot; Both companies have no illusions , &quot; said Jeffrey Tarter , publisher of Softletter , a software trade publication in Watertown , Mass . &quot; There ' s going_to be a winner and a loser or , like World_War I , years of trench warfare where everybody gets beat_up over a_few yards of territory. &quot; Novell shares took a pounding in Nasdaq trading Wednesday . They closed_down $ 1 , at $ 19 , after losing $ 3.75 on Tuesday . Seeking to defuse Wall_Street ' s criticism of the deal , announced Monday , Novell Chairman Raymond J . Noorda on Wednesday called Microsoft &quot; almost indomitable &quot; and played_down some analysts ' concerns that Novell would wage a full-bore attack that could prove to be suicidal . &quot; There ' s no way to compete head on with Microsoft , &quot; he said in a telephone_interview , explaining that Microsoft ' s product offerings are simply too broad . Competition between these companies in various niches is nothing new , of course . But the proposed union changes the dynamics . Where Novell has a shot at prevailing , Noorda said , is in products that link computers and allow users to share information . Corporations are rapidly moving to such systems from stand-alone desktop computing . Just as Microsoft dominates the global industry overall , Novell , based in Provo , Utah , is the undisputed leader in this key networking sector . Microsoft ' s current network offerings haven ' t had much success ; a new Microsoft networking product , code-named Cairo , is still in development and due on the market late next year . &quot; Novell will be first to the party in ' groupware , ' &quot; said Therese Murphy , an analyst with the Smith Barney Shearson investment_firm in San Francisco . By buying WordPerfect , publisher of the No . 2 word_processing program , and Borland International ' s spreadsheet business ( a companion deal announced Monday ) , Novell seeks to deliver a package of products that would tie_in smoothly with the desktop_computer networks that run_on its Netware and Unixware network software . These new &quot; suites &quot; would aim to steal business from Microsoft Office and other offerings that are increasingly popular_with corporate buyers looking_for bargains . * The idea of selling products bundled together at a deep discount was Microsoft ' s . With such schemes , the Redmond , Wash. , company has continually changed the rules of the software game and has ascended to the top of the global heap . Its approximately $ 4 billion in sales this year will represent nearly 40 % of the market for personal_computer software . ( A combined Novell and WordPerfect would move_into a distant second place , with sales equal_to about half of Microsoft ' s . Lotus Development would be No . 3. ) Led by its hard-driving chairman and founder , Bill Gates , Microsoft also has used price as a weapon , helping to render the industry ' s formerly cushy profit_margins a dim memory . And it develops computer operating systems that tend to squeeze_out smaller players that don ' t adhere . Gates ' relentless tactics and winner-take-all attitude have prompted government investigations . They contrast sharply with Noorda ' s and Novell ' s culture of cooperating with rivals to build a market , something Noorda calls &quot; coopetition. &quot; Noorda is_on his way_out , having announced that he will step_down as Novell ' s chief_executive in June , when he turns 70 . His successor will inherit the challenges of merging the companies and grappling with the Microsoft juggernaut . Microsoft views the potential disarray as an advantage . &quot; These are new businesses for them , and mergers are hard , &quot; said Pete Higgins , senior_vice_president of Microsoft ' s applications business . Rich Edwards , senior analyst with Robertson , Stephens &amp; Co . in San Francisco , gives the Novell-WordPerfect team a slim chance of success against Microsoft , even if it does have a head_start with its strength in networking . &quot; Microsoft has made_it very clear they ' re going to be brutally punishing to anyone trying to occupy the same space , &quot; he said . &quot; ( Novell ) is having a good time in the desktop sandbox , ( but ) it ' s Microsoft ' s sandbox. &quot; * AMBITIOUS QUEST : Microsoft ' s Bill Gates aims to be the John D . Rockefeller of the information age . A1 How Suite It Is &quot; Suites &quot; -- bundled packages of office software including a word_processor , spreadsheet and other applications -- came_into their own in 1993 . Price was the initial attraction , but customers also like the compatibility , consistency and integration . Suites could eventually make stand-alone word_processors and spreadsheets obsolete . 1993 SUITE SALES * ( millions of dollars ) Microsoft : $ 762 Lotus Development : 120 Borland / WordPerfect : 14 * preliminary THE SPREADSHEET MARKET Lotus Development ( 1-2-3 ) : 46.1 % Microsoft ( Excel ) : 31.8 % Borland International : ( Quattro Pro ) : 18.1 % Computer Associates ( SuperCalc ) : 2.3 % WordPerfect ( PlanPerfect ) : 0.9 % Other : 0.8 % THE WORD_PROCESSOR MARKET Microsoft ( Microsoft Word ) : 42.8 % WordPerfect ( WordPerfect ) : 36.7 % Lotus Development ( Ami Pro ) : 9.5 % WordStar International ( WordStar ) : 3.6 % Software Publishing ( Professional Write ) : 2.7 % Other : 4.7 % * Latest figures available Source : Dataquest</TEXT>
