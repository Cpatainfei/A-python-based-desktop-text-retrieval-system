   <HEADLINE> 2 AMERICANS WIN NOBEL FOR MEDICINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two American scientists who discovered a cellular &quot; switch &quot; that is crucial to vision , smell and the functioning of hundreds of other processes throughout the body , were named Monday to receive the 1994 Nobel Prize for medicine or physiology . Alfred G . Gilman , 53 , of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical_Center in Dallas and Martin Rodbell , 68 , of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina shared the prize for their discovery of &quot; G proteins , &quot; which turn biological_processes inside cells on and off in response to signals from other cells . Defects in G proteins have been implicated in a variety of diseases , from cancer to alcoholism , and the Karolinska Institutet , which announced the award Monday , predicted that Gilman and Rodbell ' s discoveries could eventually lead to a cure for these and other diseases . Gilman has won a number of major awards for his work , and researchers have long expected at least one of the pair to receive the Nobel . &quot; It would have been a major surprise if it were never awarded , &quot; said biologist Ray Deshaies of Caltech . Their discoveries , products of two decades of work , have been &quot; paramount &quot; in helping scientists understand diseases that affect tens of millions of people , said Bertil Fredholm of the Karolinska Institutet . Rodbell and Gilman ' s findings represent &quot; a breakthrough so fundamental to medical_science that G protein research has become one of today ' s hottest fields , &quot; said Dr. William Neaves , dean of the Southwestern Medical_School . In that sense , the award was &quot; a little bit surprising in that . . . Nobels are often given_in a field where all_the work is finished , &quot; said biologist Melvin Simon of Caltech . &quot; This is a field that hasn ' t matured yet . We have a lot more to learn. &quot; Ironically , Rodbell retired from the health sciences institute in May because he did not have enough funds to continue research for the entire year . His type of basic research , he said , is no longer widely welcomed in the mission-oriented world of federal science . &quot; The world ain ' t the same , &quot; he said at a news_conference in suburban Washington , where he was visiting family . &quot; Now everything is targeted , bottom_line , how to make a buck . . . . The attention of the Congress and the executive_branch always has been toward the end goal . They are not as willing to take_a_chance now on people like me in exploring the unknown. &quot; The pair will share an award estimated at $ 930 # 000 . Gilman , who became interested in science working in his father ' s laboratory at Albert Einstein University at age 10 , said : &quot; I ' m awestruck . I ' m more excited than I ' ve ever been. &quot; He pointed_out that G proteins play a critical role in the adrenaline response , and noted that when he heard about the award early Monday morning , &quot; this very pathway was being activated as my heart was going_about 150 beats a minute. &quot; In fact , Rodbell and Gilman made their initial discovery working with the adrenaline pathway . The question before scientists in the 1950s was how , when adrenaline is released into the bloodstream to produce the classic &quot; fight or flight &quot; response , does_it produce its effect on individual cells in the body . The adrenaline binds to receptors on the surface of cells in much the same way that the radio_signal from a remote_control is captured by the antenna of a garage door opener . The two scientists discovered that inside the cellular membrane , right next to that receptor , sits a protein , which they named the G protein because it binds to a molecule called guanosine triphosphate . When adrenaline binds to the receptor , it switches_on the G protein , which then triggers a cascade of reactions within the cell in the same manner that a simple switch in the garage door opener transmits the signal that starts the motor that opens the door . After a very short period , the G protein shuts itself off , and the cell returns to normal . Other scientists have subsequently found that G proteins work throughout the body . When light strikes a pigment in the eye , the pigment switches_on the G protein , which triggers the visual pathway . When an odor molecule binds in the nose , it switches_on a G protein that activates the process by which a smell is recognized . When an endorphin molecule binds to receptors on brain_cells , it switches_on a G protein that produces the &quot; high &quot; sensation when one is elated . G proteins have assumed critical importance in recent years as researchers have discovered that several of them are produced by oncogenes , genes that cause cancer . G proteins produced from these genes trigger cell growth and replication in response to a hormone in their environment . But occasionally when the gene mutates , in response to a carcinogen perhaps , the G protein loses the ability to turn itself off . The affected cells thus continue to replicate , producing a tumor . Many researchers believe that if they can find a way to mimic the normal activity of such G proteins , they can halt tumor growth . &quot; I think it ' s a fairly safe bet that future G protein research will identify more problems that can be linked with malfunctioning of this mechanism , &quot; Gilman said . Such knowledge , he said , could lead to treatments for a variety of such problems . The Prize Winners Two Americans won the Nobel Prize in medicine for shedding_light_on how cells communicate and how failures in that communication can cause disease . * THE FINDINGS : The scientists determined how a certain group of proteins can help transmit and modulate signals in cells , much like a biological switchboard . They found that once a cell has received chemical signals by means of surface proteins called receptors , G proteins transmit and modify these signals within a cell to produce the cell ' s response . Too many or too few G proteins can lead to disease . * SOME EXAMPLES : In cholera , toxin from cholera bacteria keeps G proteins switched_on like a stuck green_light . That prevents salt and water from being absorbed from the intestines , which can lead to dehydration and death . Disturbances in the G proteins also can explain symptoms in tumor diseases , alcoholism and even whooping_cough . * POSSIBLE RESULTS : Knowledge about the communication process inside cells should help in designing better drugs for treatment of certain diseases .
