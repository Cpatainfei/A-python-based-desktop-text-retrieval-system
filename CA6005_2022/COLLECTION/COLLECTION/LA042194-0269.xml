   <HEADLINE> BAD_WEATHER FORCES EDWARDS LANDING OF SHUTTLE ENDEAVOUR ; NASA : THE SPACE PLANE ENDS A PRODUCTIVE 11-DAY MISSION BY SCRAPPING A PLANNED TOUCH-DOWN AT KENNEDY SPACE CENTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After bad_weather in Florida twice prevented a hoped-for landing at the Kennedy Space Center , the space shuttle Endeavour returned to Earth here Wednesday , ending an 11-day mission that garnered reams of data on changes in the Earth ' s environment . &quot; The radar lab has provided an unprecedented view of our planet , &quot; a mission control announcer at the Johnson Space Center in Texas told the six astronauts aboard Endeavour as it came_to a stop on concrete Runway 22 . &quot; Welcome home. &quot; In all , enough data was recorded during the journey , dubbed &quot; Mission to Planet Earth , &quot; to fill 20 # 000 encyclopedia volumes . About 12 % of the Earth ' s surface , more_than 70 million square kilometers of land and sea , was mapped during the flight . The Earth-observing instruments met scientists ' &quot; highest expectations , collecting unique imagery of important environmental sites around the globe , &quot; according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . Endeavour touched_down with its payload of sensitive radar equipment and six astronauts a_few minutes before 10 a.m. in what a NASA announcer described as &quot; virtually pristine &quot; weather_conditions at Edwards Air_Force Base on the edge of the Mojave_Desert . The picture-perfect landing under a cloudless sky left Endeavour with what appears to be heavier than normal wear_on its nose gear tires , something that will need further evaluation , NASA spokesman Don Haley said . The California landing , the first since the shuttle Columbia landed here Nov . 1 , means that Endeavour will have to be ferried back to Florida atop a modified 747 , adding more_than $ 1 million to the cost of the mission . Because it was an unscheduled landing , few others besides those who work_at Edwards Air_Force Base were_on hand to watch Endeavour ' s return . Only a_few people were at NASA ' s hillside viewing site , a VIP area that is usually packed during a scheduled shuttle landing . There are no scheduled shuttle landings at Edwards in 1994 . The Endeavour mission was planned for nine days , but early into the flight was increased by a day &quot; because of abundant supplies , &quot; according to NASA . The first landing attempt in Florida on Tuesday was canceled because of cloud_cover and poor runway visibility . Poor weather there Wednesday morning forced the California landing . Endeavour , which has now completed six missions , is expected to be returned to the Kennedy Space Center_on Monday morning , Haley said . The orbiter ' s next flight is scheduled for August . It will carry the same radar equipment as on the just completed mission . Within hours of the April 9 launch , the radar equipment in the shuttle ' s payload bay was activated and continued to collect data without interruption throughout the mission , NASA officials said . Data was gathered from points around the world , ranging from Mammoth Mountain in California to the forests of the Amazon in Brazil to the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia , as the shuttle orbited the Earth every 89 minutes , traveling more_than 4.7 million miles . In orbit about 135 nautical_miles above the Earth ' s surface , the radar equipment was able to penetrate the dry sand cover of the Sahara_Desert to reveal drainage patterns hundreds of years old . Data on the amount and distribution of carbon_monoxide in the atmosphere was collected to aid in determining &quot; how well the atmosphere can clean itself of ' greenhouse gases , ' chemicals that can increase the atmosphere ' s temperature , &quot; according to NASA . The radar instruments were also used to observe flooding_in Missouri and Germany , as well as the San Andreas fault . Astronauts supplemented the vast radar data by taking more_than 14 # 000 still photographs . During the flight , mission specialist Jay Apt used amateur radio equipment to have an in-space chat with Russian cosmonauts aboard the MIR space_station . Apt also used the equipment to talk with two American astronauts and a pair of cosmonauts who were at the Star City training center near Moscow .</TEXT>
