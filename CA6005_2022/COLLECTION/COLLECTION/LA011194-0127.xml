   <HEADLINE> PROPERTY VALUES : MISTAKEN FORECLOSURE LIST AT_FAULT FOR HOMEOWNERS ' WOES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last year ended in confusion and frustration for Warren and Norma Becker of Studio City . Three days before the new year , the Beckers received a letter from a Sherman Oaks attorney , Steven A . Wolvek , which said : &quot; I noticed that your home is involved in a foreclosure processing . . . . If you do not have an attorney , then please feel free to contact my office so you can set an appointment for a free consultation. &quot; The next day , another letter came_in the mail -- this one from Basic Mortgage Group Inc. , a California mortgage lender . The letter was written in longhand and photocopied to make_it look nice and personal . It urged the Beckers to call so that they could deal with their loan default and start sleeping better at night . &quot; I understand the pressure and stress you must be under at this time , but take 5 minutes to call me . . . &quot; The Beckers were certain that they couldn ' t possibly be facing foreclosure on any of their residential or commercial properties , but they were nervous . &quot; When I got the first letter , I felt a pit in my stomach , &quot; Warren Becker recalled . &quot; I knew that everything was paid_up , but it makes you feel real low . I was worried about the experience of going_through a lawyer and about having future problems with lenders . It ' s really scary. &quot; It turns_out that the Beckers are current on all their loans . A check by them with Stewart Title in Glendale confirmed that everything was OK , but the letters kept coming . After some research , the Beckers discovered that one of the state ' s largest publishers of foreclosure lists had mistakenly printed a notice of default with the Beckers ' name_and_address . The Beckers now know firsthand just how easy it is for a mistake to make its way through various information services and potentially cause headaches for property_owners . Trust_deeds are basically three-party legal_instruments which are created to secure real_estate loans . In California , when a property_owner ( called the trustor ) borrows money from a lender ( called the beneficiary ) , they do so by signing a promissory_note to repay the debt . The borrower also signs a trust_deed giving a neutral third_party ( called the trustee ) the power to foreclose and sell the property if the borrower doesn ' t make_good on his or her loan obligation . After two missed payments ( about 30 days late ) , most lenders generally report the default to credit_bureaus . If nothing is done to correct the situation within about 75 days , the lender files an official notice of default ( NOD ) -- which begins the foreclosure process . Once a notice of default has been filed , there ' s a 90-day period between the notice of default and the recording of a notice of trustee ' s sale . The borrower has up_to five business days before the date of sale to catch_up on their loan payments . &quot; There are several steps_in the process where a mistake can happen , &quot; said Ronald M . Frumkin , publisher of Redloc Information Services in Santa Ana , which published the Beckers ' mistaken notice of default for its own subscribers , and for readers of the Los Angeles Daily Commerce . Attorneys , lenders , property investors and some credit companies use these lists to generate new business , Frumkin explained , but there ' s no way these foreclosure listings can be 100 % accurate , he said . Each month Redloc publishes about 20 # 000 notices of pending trustee sales and of completed sales in 13 California counties . Los Angeles County alone has 300 to 400 notices daily . Mistakes happen several times a week , Frumkin conceded . People call_up surprised to find themselves on a list of defaulting borrowers . &quot; Sometimes they ' re irate and we have to calm them down , &quot; Frumkin said . NODs that are filed with the Los Angeles County recorder don ' t have to include a legal description or property address . The NODs merely reference an original deed_of_trust and the name or names of the borrower , or trustor . Redloc compiles lists of NODs and then looks_up the original deeds_of_trust on microfilm to get the legal description of the property . Then , from the county assessor , Redloc gets the street_address of the property . A clerk may look_up the wrong deed_of_trust , the legal description may be copied wrong , the legal description may be matched with the wrong parcel or an error in entering all this information into the computer may occur , Frumkin said . When this happens , a retraction is published . &quot; It would definitely be a better system if the trustees printed an address or legal description on the NOD , &quot; Frumkin said . &quot; It would eliminate a lot of errors. &quot; While Frumkin ' s idea may be a good one , the California Trustee ' s Assn . doesn ' t agree with him . &quot; If you require a legal description on NODs , it will often be wrong , &quot; said Phillip Adleson , corporate counsel to the association . &quot; We have a very complex system . There are so many problems , &quot; he said . The system won ' t get any better by adding more requirements , Adleson argued . &quot; The issue is making people who are in default aware of their situation , &quot; he said , and that is being accomplished with NODs being sent to wayward borrowers by both regular and certified mail . Because the Beckers were never really facing foreclosure , they never got any official notice of default . They did get plenty of other letters , though . It seemed to the Beckers that the vultures were circling . Warren Becker said that when he tried to contact attorney Wolvek about the letter , Wolvek didn ' t return his calls and his office declined to say where they had gotten the Beckers ' name_and_address . And Wolvek did not return any of my calls seeking a comment . It should be noted that attorneys are presumed_to be violating the rules of_their_own profession if they send_out a solicitation letter to a non-client , &quot; unless the envelope bears an ' advertising ' notation to enable the recipient to distinguish such advertising from legal correspondence , &quot; according to the California State Bar . There was no such notation on the Beckers ' correspondence from Wolvek . One also can ' t help but wonder about attorneys who don ' t return phone_calls . Becker said his own attorney didn ' t return his calls about the &quot; foreclosure &quot; letters . Warren Becker said he ' s now scratched that attorney ' s name off of his list . Most of the letters the Beckers received in the mail were disturbing . A firm called Homesavers Unlimited offered for $ 395 to &quot; get your home out of foreclosure today &quot; -- probably with a bankruptcy filing . Another letter offered to provide the Beckers with a new loan or , if they prefer , to offer their property for_sale through the multiple listings . Yet another letter said that , &quot; If the responsibility has fallen on your shoulders to save your family ' s home , give me a call right now . I can help you get_back on your feet with a loan . . . . P.S. If I ' m out helping someone when you call , please leave me a message. &quot; &quot; Everybody ' s looking_for some business . that ' s the way it is , &quot; said Jonathan Byron , a loan representative with Basic Mortgage Group Inc. , which was one of the Beckers ' solicitors . Mistakes in transcription and in the compiling of foreclosure lists occur frequently , said Claudia Queen , vice_president and residential sales manager for Stewart Title in Glendale . She was recently perusing the listings of defaults and noticed one valuable property in default_on a $ 470 # 000 loan . In fact , Queen said , the publisher of the listing was off by two digits -- the default was a whopping $ 47 million . &quot; that ' s quite a mistake , &quot; Queen said . &quot; I have a sense that it happens very often. &quot;</TEXT>
