   <HEADLINE> SIOUX CULTURE CLOUDS GIRL ' S FUTURE ; LAW : THE STANDING ROCK TRIBE FEARS THE CHILD IS IN DANGER OF LOSING HER HERITAGE . IT PLANS TO APPEAL JUDGE ' S DECISION ALLOWING HER TO STAY WITH GUARDIAN , WITH WHOM SHE HAS LIVED NEARLY ALL HER LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kayla American Horse ' s hopes seem simple enough : to stay in Kentucky , play basketball , join the cheerleaders and serve on the safety patrol . But her future is anything but simple . Eleven-year-old Kayla is at the center of an increasingly bitter custody fight that pits Loni Rye , the Kentucky woman who reared her from the age of 8 months , against the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . The tribe claims Kayla as a member -- and argues that she belongs with her people . Too many children , the Sioux say , are adopted off the reservations . &quot; The bottom_line is , Indian children are the lifeblood of Indian tribes , &quot; said Steve Moore , a senior staff attorney with the Native_American Rights Fund of Boulder , Colo . The population base is diminishing due_to these cases , he said . &quot; The very vitality of tribes are threatened. &quot; All Kayla wants is to be a kid . &quot; I ' m scared , &quot; Kayla whispered . &quot; I wish this would be over. &quot; It is not . Although Boyd County Circuit Judge C . David Hagerman awarded custody to Loni Rye in April , the tribe has promised to appeal . Rye says when she first saw Kayla on the reservation in 1984 , the girl was clothed in nothing but a filthy T-shirt . Kayla ' s mother , now known as Effie Iron Road , was an alcoholic and admitted she couldn ' t care_for Kayla . The mother signed custody of Kayla over to Rye and her ex-husband , Kim Weasel , who is Kayla ' s uncle and a member of the tribe . A tribal judge later appointed them legal_guardians , although retaining wardship . But in the intervening years , Rye said , the tribe showed no interest in Kayla . When Rye asked_for financial assistance three years ago to have a hole in Kayla ' s heart repaired , the tribe refused . &quot; It just seems to me to be kind of a self-serving proposition , &quot; said Gurney Johnson , Rye ' s attorney . &quot; ' Now the child ' s well and happy , so we want her back. ' &quot; Standing Rock Chief Tribal Judge Mike Swallow said the tribe had no reason to be concerned about Kayla until October , when Rye and her husband filed for divorce . He feared that without Weasel , Kayla would have no tribal influence in her life . Rye said that was absurd . She said she took Kayla and her other two children , who also are_on the tribe ' s rolls , to powwows and other cultural events . Rye , who is of Cherokee and Choctaw descent , has also given the children books about their heritage . &quot; I love the Sioux people , &quot; she said . &quot; They ' re wonderful people. &quot; Still , the custody fight has gotten ugly . In arguing that the case not be transferred to the reservation , Johnson described &quot; deplorable &quot; conditions in some Sioux foster_homes . And Swallow cited a petition circulated in the Ashland area that accused the tribe of wanting Kayla merely for &quot; a government check and for breeding purposes. &quot; Swallow argued that Kayla was still a ward of the tribe , and that the case should have been transferred to the reservation , which straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border . But Hagerman maintained jurisdiction because Kayla and most of the witnesses in the case live_in Kentucky . While not discounting the bond between Rye and Kayla , Moore said there are &quot; competing factors that come_into play &quot; in Indian custody_battles . Toby Grossman , senior staff attorney for the American_Indian Law Center in Albuquerque , N.M. , said there are several hundred such cases pending each year . Grossman could not say how many of those children are returned to the reservation . But when most tribes number in the low thousands , even one case &quot; is terribly significant , &quot; she said . &quot; They look_at one child as important to them , and people have to understand that , &quot; she said . The federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 was passed to help reduce the number of adoptions off the reservations . Moore of the Native_American Rights Fund said the law is so full of loopholes as_to be nearly ineffective . He said nearly half of the estimated 1.96 million people of American_Indian ancestry live_off the reservations . That puts tribal courts at a great disadvantage in custody_cases , he said . &quot; There ' s been an obvious effort by state court judges to create loopholes and exemptions ( in the act ) , to_the_point that I believe Congress needs to take the_matter up again , &quot; he said . Rye is preparing_for a long fight for Kayla . She has contracted with Los Angeles-based manager George Pasmore to hire a tutor to school the children in Sioux ways and establish a defense fund at an Ashland bank . Pasmore is also lining_up television appearances and has already assigned the rights for a movie &quot; if a show is to be made. &quot; Kayla was in New York to appear on ABC ' s &quot; Good_Morning America &quot; the day Hagerman made his ruling . She says she ' s getting tired_of the attention . &quot; Everybody in my school , all_the teachers , call me a movie_star , &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t want to be_on TV at all. &quot;</TEXT>
