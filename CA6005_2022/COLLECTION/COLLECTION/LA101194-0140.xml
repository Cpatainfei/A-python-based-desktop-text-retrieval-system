   <HEADLINE> R.J. REYNOLDS TO INTRODUCE LESS-SMELLY CIGARETTE ; CONSUMER PRODUCTS : TOBACCO FIRM SAYS NEW SALEM MENTHOL BRAND IS MADE WITH PAPER THAT REDUCES STALE ODORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. , which tried and failed to market a smokeless cigarette in the late 1980s , announced plans for a sweeter-smelling cigarette Monday . Later this month , the company will introduce a new version of its Salem menthol brand featuring a cigarette_paper that reduces stale odors , it said . &quot; Smokers were asked , other_than price , if we can change something about our product , what would they change , &quot; RJR spokeswoman DeeDee Whitt said . &quot; They said they would change it to get_rid_of the lingering stale smell . &quot; We ' re addressing a growing social concern that perhaps some people don ' t like the smell of cigarettes in their clothing , car and hair , &quot; she said . A sample magazine advertisement for the new brand , called Salem Preferred , reads , &quot; I love what you ' re not wearing. &quot; It says Salem Preferred has a &quot; less lingering stale smell &quot; and lists four problem areas where the smokey smell can linger : hair , clothes , home and the car . RJR said Salem Preferred uses a patented paper technology that changes the smoke odor and gives the cigarettes a smoother taste . While the company won ' t elaborate on the process , Whitt said it is done_by adding a &quot; very common food_additive &quot; to the paper . Salem Preferred will be introduced this month in_stores on military bases across the country , Whitt said . She said she did not know when they will be available to the general public . &quot; We hope it ' s a great success and we ' ll roll it out even further , &quot; she said . Six years ago , RJR had a short-lived trial for a smokeless cigarette , known as Premier . Company officials have since said Premier was introduced prematurely and had an unusual taste and odor that bothered some smokers . RJR has no immediate plans to wrap all its brands in the new paper , Whitt said . &quot; Just like the cork-tip ( filter ) and 85-millimeter length are preferred by some of our customers , some of our customers prefer this , &quot; she said . Asked if the new menthol brand will also please nonsmokers , she said , &quot; You ' ll need to check with them. &quot; The Wall_Street Journal on Monday quoted Timothy Hensley , a spokesman for the Centers_for_Disease_Control ' s Office on Smoking and Health in Atlanta , as saying Salem Preferred could draw attention to what has been an unregulated part of cigarettes : their paper . Right now , cigarette companies are required to disclose only the ingredient list for the tobacco and any additives to it , not the composition of the paper , he said . Whitt said RJR anticipated questions about the paper ' s composition and has provided details to federal regulators .</TEXT>
