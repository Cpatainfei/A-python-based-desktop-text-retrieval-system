   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEWS ; D-DAY INVASION FIRES EARLY SHOTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The invasion is underway . The TV invasion , that is , about the D-Day invasion 50 years ago . &quot; Masterpiece Theatre &quot; fired an early shot with its &quot; A Foreign Field , &quot; soon followed by the spare , brilliantly constructed &quot; D-Day &quot; for &quot; The American Experience &quot; on PBS , and retired Gen . Norman Schwarzkopf ' s own reconnaissance with CBS ' Dan Rather . With wave after wave of TV troops , it ' ll be easy to lose filmmaker Christopher Koch ' s 90-minute &quot; Normandy : The Great Crusade &quot; in the barrage . While it lacks the grim purity of PBS ' &quot; D-Day &quot; film , it is an even more ambitious montage of archival film , photos and personal documents covering the entire course of the Allied campaign from the invasion to the eventual collapse of the Nazi occupation of France . This is the product of the school of history-as-biography -- history reconstructed through the diaries , letters , poems , home_movies and other personal scribblings of soldiers , loved ones and innocents caught between the lines . In this latter category , Koch takes a huge interest in the plight of Marie-Louise Osmond ( spoken fervently by Leslie Caron ) , whose Normandy manor home was occupied by the Germans in 1940 and then , in the summer of 1944 , became the center for hot days of battles . Koch gets hokey , though , when his camera tries frantically to track Osmond ' s point_of_view as she escapes the bullets and bombs . While &quot; D-Day &quot; recorded the voices of actual soldiers recalling those terrifying days , &quot; The Great Crusade ' s &quot; use of actors reading material written as blood was being spilled causes an odd distancing from a film full of visceral horror . ( The images of a dead soldier covered in flies is out of Bunuel. ) Narrator Charles Durning , himself part of the first invading force on Omaha Beach , adds_to the distancing since he doesn ' t include ( reportedly by his own request ) any of_his_own personal recollections . For all_of its attention to the individual perspective , &quot; The Great Crusade &quot; encompasses a vast sound scape of voices , from American widower Karin King and Nazi-hating Berlin reporter Ursula von Kardorff ( Joanna Pacula , in a reading tinged with bitterness ) to early teen-aged Hitlerjungend sent to the front_lines and confused but excited Allied troopers . Their words resound with the sense of people swept into forces beyond their control , fearfully expectant , even inspired by war ' s ferocity to poetry . * &quot; Normandy : The Great Crusade &quot; airs tonight at 9 and midnight on Discovery Channel . Other D-Day programming this week includes &quot; George Stevens : D-Day to Berlin , &quot; Tuesday , 9 p.m. on Disney Channel ; &quot; Turning Point at Normandy : The Soldiers ' Story , &quot; Wednesday , 9:30 p.m. , ABC , and &quot; Fall From Grace , &quot; a two-part TV movie , Thursday and Friday , 9 p.m. , CBS .
