   <HEADLINE> LABOR DEPT . SET TO GO AFTER STORES SELLING GARMENTS FROM SWEATSHOPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stepping_up its efforts to crack_down on rampant labor abuses in the garment-manufacturing industry , the Clinton_Administration is threatening legal_action against major retailers that sell clothing produced in law-breaking American sweatshops . Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich will announce today that his department is prepared to seek court_orders , under the federal statute known as the &quot; hot goods &quot; law , to prevent retailers from selling goods manufactured under conditions that violate labor laws . The move is intended to curb what government investigators claim is a chilling trend : the return of the type of abuse-ridden sweatshops found in the garment industry at the turn_of_the_century , a problem particularly severe in Southern California . A study by state and federal authorities released in April found chronic abuses by California garment makers , including cases of bosses locking fire exits , children as young as 13 working nine-hour days , and workers receiving pay far below the $ 4.25-an-hour federal minimum_wage . Yet authorities have been thwarted in efforts to combat the problem , largely because the worst abuses often occur at small sewing contractors that simply shut_down and set_up for business under a new name when investigators bear_down_on them . Federal labor officials in California began to strike back by taking_aim at big garment manufacturers that hire law-breaking sewing contractors . To that end , they dusted off the little-used 1938 hot-goods statute , which bars interstate transport of goods made at companies breaking labor law . In a major precedent in 1992 , the Labor_Department investigated Guess Inc. , Southern California ' s biggest apparel firm , under the statute and extracted an agreement making the company responsible_for its contractors ' labor practices . The plans to be announced by Reich today step_up that program by striking at big retailers along with the manufacturers and by expanding the hot-goods initiative outside California to other apparel-making centers of the country . One source said Reich may disclose the name of a major retailer already in talks with federal_officials to work with the government in connection with the hot-goods program . Industry groups , however , are expected to oppose their government initiatives . In California , industry opposition led to previous defeats of proposed state legislation to make manufacturers liable for labor law violations committed by their contractors . A scaled-down version of the proposal was approved by the Legislature again this year , but Gov . Pete Wilson has not indicated whether he will sign it into law . Garment industry abuses are are widespread in other parts of the country as well . A General Accounting Office study estimated that nearly two-thirds of the garment shops in New York City are violating the law . Another target of the department ' s new enforcement effort is the growing number of apparel contractors that hire people to sew at_home , paying them a piecework rate that is_well below minimum_wage . Federal labor laws prohibit such industrial work_at home . &quot; We have two strategies , &quot; Reich said in an interview Thursday . The first , he said , is to get retailers to better police their manufacturers by using the hot-goods provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act to block shipments from the manufacturer to the retailer . That provision allows the government to seek restraining orders prohibiting the shipment of illegal goods . The second strategy , Reich said , would be to use the same clause to seek court injunctions to prevent retailers from selling any illegally produced goods they may have received . This will be the first time the federal_government has taken this approach in the courts . He said that once a retailer has been warned about illegal manufacturers , it will be liable under the law .</TEXT>
