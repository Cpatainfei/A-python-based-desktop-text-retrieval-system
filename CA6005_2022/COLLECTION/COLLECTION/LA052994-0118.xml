   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : KEEPING A HEALTHY ATTITUDE ABOUT TROPICAL DESTINATIONS ; DISEASES : THERE ' S ALWAYS A RISK OF GETTING SICK IN EQUATORIAL CLIMES , BUT PREVENTIVE MEASURES CAN HELP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even experienced travelers venturing into tropical realms often do so with some apprehension about their health -- and understandably so . After all , lots of bacteria , parasites and other little unseen nasties are just waiting to strike . But travel_to the tropics isn ' t something to be feared &quot; as long as good_health habits are carefully practiced , &quot; says Martin S . Wolfe , a Washington specialist in tropical medicine . Wolfe is editor of the most recent edition of &quot; Health Hints for the Tropics , &quot; a helpful , 51-page guide to staying well abroad , published periodically since 1948 by the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene . &quot; Although many exotic diseases and other health hazards in tropical locales are not found in the United States or Europe , &quot; says Wolfe , who has lived and worked in the tropics and is a tropical medicine consultant to the State_Department , &quot; most of these illnesses are preventable by maintaining sanitation and using common sense. &quot; On the good news front , the guide reports that a new hepatitis_A vaccine , which is now licensed in Europe , should be available in the United States sometime this year . It provides longer protection than the current recommended vaccine -- immune globulin ( IG ) -- against the hepatitis_A_virus , which means it does not have to be administered as frequently . The virus , considered a &quot; significant risk &quot; in developing countries , can be acquired by consuming contaminated food , water or shellfish taken from contaminated water -- all_of which are sometimes hard to avoid in the developing world . And now the bad news : Malaria-causing mosquitoes are becoming increasingly resistant to antimalarial_drugs in some parts of the world , the guide says , &quot; and no present-day antimalarial_drug regimen guarantees protection against malaria. &quot; To avoid malaria , travelers are advised to pay much greater attention now to avoiding mosquito_bites . This means using an insect_repellent containing DEET ( 35 % concentration ) on exposed skin , wearing clothes that cover most of the body and spraying an insecticide on clothing , using a mosquito_net at night and spraying a flying-insect insecticide in your room . Among other recommendations in &quot; Health Hints &quot; : * Cholera : For most travelers , cholera immunizations are no longer recommended . The only vaccine currently available is not considered very effective , says the guide , and the injection can cause a fever and headache . Instead , if you are going_to an area of active cholera outbreaks , such_as South_America , your best protection is to be cautious in what you eat and drink . Improved oral vaccines may be available soon . * Diarrhea : An estimated 20 % -30 % of travelers to the developing world suffer a bout of diarrhea . The most common sources are contaminated food , water and beverages . Many people get tripped_up on what the guide calls &quot; oversights &quot; : brushing your teeth with contaminated water , ordering a drink with contaminated ice , sipping a diluted fruit_juice , or eating cold foods that are much more likely than hot substances to be contaminated by the hands of infected food handlers . To spare your stomach , make_it a practice to consume only hot cooked food , fruits that can be peeled , carbonated beverages ( they inhibit the growth of bacteria ) , and coffee , tea , beer and wine . Boiling water for five minutes kills all dangerous organisms , including hepatitis viruses . You can carry iodine water purification tablets or small , portable water_filters with an iodine component . But be aware , says the guide , that many available water_filters &quot; cannot be considered reliable for removing all infectious agents. &quot; Also , make_a_point of washing your hands frequently -- especially before eating . Pepto-Bismol tablets , taken as a preventative , have been found safe and effective in warding_off diarrhea for many people . Generally , tropical medical authorities don ' t recommend taking antibiotics as a preventative , unless you have other medical problems that could be worsened by diarrhea . * Typhoid_Fever : Since 1989 , an oral typhoid vaccine has been available in the United States for travelers age 6 and older . A version of it is in development for younger children . Previously , prevention of typhoid , a bacterial infection caused by contaminated water and food , required a series of injections . * Sleeping_Sickness : In tropical Africa , sleeping sickness is &quot; a potential hazard , &quot; warns the guide , particularly in the game parks of East Africa . But infection has been rare in American travelers . The disease is spread by the large tsetse_fly , and the best protection is to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants to avoid bites . For a copy of &quot; Health Hints for the Tropics , &quot; send a check for $ 5 to the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene , 60 Revere Drive , Suite 500 , Northbrook , Ill . 60062 . For a directory of U.S. and Canadian physicians who specialize in traveler and tropical medicine , send a stamped ( $ 1 ) , self-addressed envelope ( 9 by 11 inches ) to Dr. Leonard C . Marcus , 148 Highland Ave. , Newton , Mass . 02165 . Christopher Reynolds is_on assignment .</TEXT>
