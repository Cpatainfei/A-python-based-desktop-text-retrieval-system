   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 ; PLAYING HOST TO THE MOST ; VENUES FOR THE WORLD CUP GAMES ARE COUNTING ON GOOD SOCCER AND BOOMING BUSINESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the soccer community , the essential numbers are 24 teams , 52 matches and 31 days . For the business_community , they are 1.4 million foreign tourists and $ 500 million in tourist spending . Coming_in 33 days to a stadium near you , the World Cup . A glance at the sites and scenes : WORSE YET , THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE STANFORD BAND TO LEAVE THE FIELD With assistance from the ballpark version of a SWAT team , the organizing committee ' s Architecture , Construction and Turf team ( ACT ) , all nine venues have received FIFA ' s good groundskeeping seal_of_approval . To meet international standards , fields were widened , crowns were removed and artificial grass was replaced by the real_thing . The Rose Bowl , which already had natural turf , replanted it twice within the last year . Its first field of dreams withstood the UCLA football_season but not the recent Pink Floyd concerts . The stadium is the only one that has not been tested by soccer within the last year -- that will happen June 4 in a game between the United States and Mexico -- but FIFA officials expect it to pass . The only concern they admit to involves Stanford Stadium , where university officials will not completely turn_over the field to FIFA until after graduation_exercises June 12 . That is only eight days before the first game there . &quot; Commencement comes first , not World Cup soccer , &quot; said Lois Wagner , Stanford ' s director of events and services . I can ' t TALK NOW , I ' VE GOT TO MOW THE DOME Perhaps it ' s not Tonya and Nancy , or Lorena and John , or the Menendez brothers , but the installation of natural turf inside the Pontiac Silverdome is big news , and not only in agronomy circles . On a recent afternoon , Sports Illustrated photographers were in Pontiac , Mich. , taking pictures of a Thai television crew , which was filming the grass growing . And you thought soccer was slow . Because so_much soccer is played outdoors during chilly winter months , FIFA wanted to experiment with a domed_stadium to see whether the concept would work in other parts of the world . The first question was whether it was feasible to grow grass indoors . Professors at Michigan State ' s Crop and Soil Sciences Department bet that it was , and 6 million pounds of Kentucky_bluegrass , soil from Camarillo ' s Pacific Earth Resources Sod Farm and $ 1.5 million later , they appear to be right . &quot; What they have done_in Michigan is a miracle , &quot; German Coach Berti Vogts said after his team played there last summer . A LATE ENTRY : BERMUDA The only complaint the German coach had concerned the steamy conditions inside the Silverdome , which , as the site primarily of Detroit Lion games and other winter events , does not have air-conditioning . Heat and humidity will be a problem at most venues , where many games have been scheduled for the afternoon so that they can be televised in prime_time in Europe . European coaches have suggested that South_American teams have an advantage because they are more accustomed to sultry conditions , but Brazil wilted in a day_game last summer at Washington ' s RFK Stadium . Organizers cannot do much for the players , who are forced to remain on the field for long stretches without breaks because of rules limiting substitutions . But relief has been offered to World Cup staff_members and volunteers in two hot spots , Orlando , Fla. , and Dallas . They have been issued shorts as part of their uniforms . PULL OVER , PAL . YOU WERE DOING 97.75 IN A 55.25. Orlando ' s Public Works Dept . is spending $ 2 # 500 to erect 100 metric speed-limit signs_on routes leading to the Citrus Bowl . &quot; It ' s going_to be an awful job for us , &quot; director David Metzker said . &quot; But if we ' re truly an international city , we should adopt those standards. &quot; SURGEON_GENERAL ' S WARNING : THE WORLD CUP MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH &quot; These people eat later than we do , they smoke heavily , and their demands on our services will be unique , compared to what we are used to , &quot; said Stephen Elmont , owner of Mirabelle restaurant in Boston , speaking_for a U.S. service_industry that is gearing_up for an expected 1.4 million foreign soccer fans . In some cities , restaurants are extending their hours , printing menus in other languages and re-establishing -- or at least increasing space for -- smoking sections . Hotels that have nonsmoking floors also are reconsidering their policies . &quot; Then , after the World Cup , we ' ll have to figure_out how to get the smoke odor out , &quot; Elmont said . TODAY ' S REFEREE : NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF In their effort to wake_up local law_enforcement authorities to the threats posed by hooligans , lager louts and other rowdies , the organizing committee ' s security experts did too good a job . Now , FIFA is complaining about an overreaction in Dallas , Palo Alto and Washington , where fences have been constructed around the fields to protect players and referees from overzealous fans . They point to the tragedy at Sheffield , England , in 1989 , when 95 were killed and at least 200 injured when they surged forward to escape violence behind them and were crushed against a security fence . &quot; FIFA is of the opinion that the only things behind fences are prisoners and animals , &quot; said the governing body ' s general secretary , Sepp Blatter . Blatter also argues that misbehaving fans usually do not follow their national teams , but Dallas ' deputy police_chief , Rick Hatler , is not buying that after witnessing the destruction in Sweden during the 1992 European Championships . &quot; The question is not , ' Will they come ? ' &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s how many , and where they will cause problems. &quot; Waiting for them in Orlando is Kevin Beary , the sheriff of Orange County , Fla. , who prepared_for the World Cup with crowd and terrorist control training in Belfast . His most recent budget request included $ 262 # 000 for riot gear , bomb-squad devices and other items such_as groin protectors for his deputies and shin_guards for horses . The day after a violent confrontation at an Orlando concert between police and Grateful Dead fans , Beary ' s request was approved . MEANWHILE , IN WASHINGTON , BILL_CLINTON IS STILL PULLING FOR ARKANSAS Although they have to cross an ocean to get here , Germany and Italy would not be more at_home if they were playing in Munich or Milan . About 30 # 000 Germans are expected to travel with their team to its first-round matches in Chicago , where they will be greeted by a thriving community from back home . The largest crowd ever to attend a soccer game there , 54 # 000 , watched the Germans play_at Soldier Field last summer . The best-known German restaurant in the Loop , the Berghoff , is postponing vacations for its employees in anticipation of 4 # 000 customers a day , twice the usual summer crowd , and the Chicago Brauhaus on the North_Side is erecting a tent in its parking_lot to handle all_the diners it expects . But no team is likely to be greeted more enthusiastically than the Azzurri . Three million people of Italian descent within 50 miles of New York made_it virtually impossible to get tickets to the team ' s first-round games at the New Jersey Meadowlands . AND IN BOSTON , NIGERIAN EYES ARE SMILING Nothing against Argentina , Bolivia , Greece , Nigeria and South_Korea , but Boston , where one in every four persons is of Irish descent , was praying that Ireland would play its first-round games there . Even the city ' s Italian-American mayor , Thomas Menino , wore a green tie on the day of the draw . When Ireland was sent elsewhere , Austin O ' Conor , the owner of three Irish pubs in Boston , was sobered . But that condition lasted only for a_couple_of moments before he perked_up . Turning_to a friend , he asked , &quot; What does a Nigerian drink ? &quot; IN DETROIT , THEY THINK MARADONA IS THE BLONDE SINGER WITH THE CONE-SHAPED BRASSIERE Desperately seeking a home is America ' s team , whose fans usually are drowned out by those favoring the opponent even at games played in the United States . For an example , check_out the United Sates-Mexico exhibition on June 4 at the Rose Bowl . But U.S. players believe they finally will be embraced in Pontiac , where they open against Switzerland on June 18 before playing their other two first-round games at the Rose Bowl . &quot; I think we will be the home team this time , &quot; defender Desmond Armstrong said . &quot; I mean , Motor_City . Motown . that ' s America right there. &quot; If Armstrong is there , however , it will be as a spectator or TV commentator . He was cut from the team last week . And one Detroit native believes that the only way the U.S. players will be loved there is if they switch to the kind of football usually played in the Silverdome . Said Buffalo Bill owner Ralph Wilson , who once owned an extraordinarily unsuccessful soccer franchise in Detroit : &quot; Soccer , I think , is a terrible spectator sport . Millions like it in Europe , Asia or wherever they play it . They don ' t like it in Detroit. &quot; WHAT IS A SIX-LETTER WORD FOR A SPORT IN WHICH YOU can ' t USE YOUR HANDS ? Officials responsible_for making_sure that the World Cup runs smoothly in the various cities range from those with little previous soccer experience to those whose lives have revolved_around the sport . Among the former are Paul Klepper , a former Marine officer who pulled duty during Operation_Desert_Storm in the White_House situation room and now serves as the assistant venue director in Washington , and Olympic triple jumper Willie Banks , who is the assistant venue director in Pasadena . One of the latter is Farrukh Quraishi . A former Hermann Trophy winner , college soccer ' s equivalent of the Heisman , and a professional player for six years with the Tampa Bay Rowdies , he is the venue director in Orlando . But perhaps the only official who still wakes_up every morning asking , &quot; Why me ? &quot; is Jay Pritzker , the Hyatt chief who became chairman of Chicago ' s host committee at the behest of Mayor Richard Daley . &quot; I knew_nothing , absolutely nothing about soccer , &quot; Pritzker recently told the Chicago Tribune . &quot; And you want to know what I know about it now ? I know there are 11 men on a team , and I know that because it ' s an answer in crossword puzzles. &quot; SO WHAT ' S NEW ? THE CUBS HAVE BEEN BOOTING THE BALL FOR YEARS Church_bells didn ' t ring when FIFA announced the World Cup was coming_to America , but cash_registers did . Commerce_Department officials estimate that foreign soccer fans will spend $ 500 million , almost a fifth in Southern California . The expected benefits to some cities , however , cannot be measured in dollars , pesos or marks . One city eager to project itself in a better light is Detroit , which , according to GQ , has the image of &quot; Sarajevo with car plants. &quot; The city ' s host committee chairman , Roger Faulkner , told the magazine , &quot; We ' ve had more written about us in the last six months than in the last six years -- and it ' s not been about unemployment or crime , either . We are going_to change the perception of Detroit worldwide. &quot; Another city attempting to make itself over is Chicago , where Gerald Roper , president of the city ' s Chamber_of_Commerce and Industry , said , &quot; We have the opportunity to dispel our old image and put Al Capone in the grave once and for all. &quot; Times columnist Mike Downey contributed to this story .
