   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : YOUTH / OPINION ; ' ABSTINENCE-ONLY PROGRAMS NOT FOR EVERYONE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Contrary to the popular adage , I ' m inclined to believe that , in most circumstances , ignorance is not bliss . In the case of denying birth_control information to students , ignorance can be downright deadly . There have been conflicts in public_schools across the country over whether and / or when such birth_control curricula should and would be taught . Some who object argue that any contraceptive method that is not 100 % effective should not be taught in schools . Others see this as a religious issue rather than one of health education , attaching words like &quot; immoral &quot; and &quot; sinful &quot; to the discussion . Their answer to birth-control education almost always consists_of religious-based curricula that are often short on facts and long on propaganda . Some widely used abstinence-only programs have been challenged in court for presenting inaccurate medical information . The public should look_at any sex-education curricula that stress abstinence only and compare them to what common_sense tells you about sexuality and teen-agers . In other words , is it realistic to expect that every student will heed an abstinence-only message ? Undeniably , abstinence is the only 100 % way to keep safe from pregnancies and disease . But if this message is not reaching 100 % of the students , would n ' t the program , according to beliefs of abstinence-only supporters , be a loser ? I believe so . In a perfect world , students could receive barrages of abstinence-only messages before they experiment sexually and elect to wait based on health concerns or religious reasons . But this is not a perfect world . Students who have decided to engage in sex and are not educated about protection are at great risk of disease and pregnancies and the complications of life that accompany them . The realist realizes that most teen-agers do not receive this education at_home and that the student who has already made_up his or her mind will never regard an abstinence-only message , regardless of how it may be presented . People who object to birth-control education often cite concerns that it undermines their role as parents to decide what to teach their children . This argument is a fallacy , for if these pious parents teach their children morals and values and set good_examples , those children will not sway from their beliefs . Responsible educators would agree that programs stressing religious themes could have devastating psychological effects on the psyche of a sexually active student who would receive the message that he is immoral , sinful , and wrong -- bearing out already-existing confusion and guilt . Abstinence-only programs are not for everyone . They should not be , for students are as diverse religiously as they are racially and each comes from a home where values and morals are being stressed by religious and non-religious parents alike . Just because some methods of contraceptives are only 80 % effective does not mean that they should not be used . This is as crude as suggesting that chemotherapy should not be used to counteract cancer , since it does not work for everyone . Sexually active students who are ignorant about protection become victims of cruel and misguided censorship . A responsible protective program must stress abstinence first and foremost , but also must reach_out to students who choose not to abstain to avoid sending the message of &quot; I told you so ! &quot; to any who fall victim to AIDS , other sexually transmitted diseases or premature parenthood . I ask those who oppose sex education : How could education ever be wrong ? How could ignorance ever be right ? What good is reading , writing and arithmetic to a student who will die of AIDS because he or she was denied education by our schools ? There are many reasons why schools must educate students on life issues like protective sex education . Ignorance is not bliss .</TEXT>
