   <HEADLINE> POLITICIAN FROM QUEBEC HAS LEG AMPUTATED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lucien Bouchard , a charismatic Quebec separatist hoping to help lead the mainly French-speaking province to independence as soon as next year , had his left leg amputated Thursday after he developed an infection , possibly from the so-called flesh-eating bacteria . Bouchard , 55 , was reported in serious but stable condition in intensive care at Saint Luc Hospital in Montreal.He entered the hospital Tuesday for treatment of phlebitis . A hospital statement said an infection developed that forced the amputation . Two television_stations reported that Bouchard was afflicted with necrotizing fasciitis , which rapidly destroys skin and tissue . There was no immediate confirmation from the hospital . Bouchard ' s wife , Audrey Best Bouchard , an American who grew_up in Orange County , was at the hospital . The couple , who married in 1989 , have two children . Bouchard is extremely popular in Quebec but widely despised in the rest of Canada as the man who wants to break_up the country . His Bloc Quebecois won 54 seats in Parliament in last year ' s election , making_it the second-largest party after the ruling Liberals . Bouchard shares stewardship of the separatist movement with Jacques Parizeau , Quebec ' s premier , and has been tapped for a starring role in the province-wide campaign expected next year in anticipation of a referendum on independence . The separatists believe voter endorsement of Quebec independence will pave the way for separation . A visibly shaken Parizeau appeared on television and directed his comments to Bouchard . &quot; Old friend , hold_on and show the same courage you have shown so often in the past , &quot; he said . Bouchard ' s leading opponent , Prime_Minister Jean Chretien , issued a statement from Paris , where he was attending a conference on AIDS . &quot; At moments like this , we put political differences aside to express our personal solidarity with the suffering of a fellow human_being , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
