   <HEADLINE> PORT POLICE_OFFICERS PATROL ON LAND , SEA AND AIR ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : THE LITTLE-KNOWN , 55-MEMBER FORCE HELPS TO SAFEGUARD LIVES AND PROPERTY IN THE SPRAWLING HARBOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a city swarming with law_enforcement agencies , the Port Police may be the least-known cops who ever walked , drove , pedaled , flew or swam a beat . Everybody has heard of the Los Angeles Police_Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department . Most people are probably aware of airport , transit and school police , not to mention local police_departments from Burbank to El Segundo . Except for those who live or work_at the Port of Los Angeles , it ' s probably fair to say that most Angelenos have never heard of the Port Police . In fact , while South Bay residents may be aware that the Port of Los Angeles is one of the busiest commercial shipping ports in the world , people in Van Nuys or Pasadena or Beverly Hills tend to think that the port is some kind of marina . Actually , it ' s a teeming center of industrialism interspersed with pockets of recreational activity , 28 miles of waterfront where oil tank farms , lumber yards and auto storage facilities sit cheek by jowl with marinas and beaches and restaurants with harbor views . It ' s a place where freighters tie_up near luxury cruise_ships . Every year more_than $ 60 billion worth of goods pass_through the port , bound to and from almost every country in the world . Every day about 50 # 000 people pour into the port area to work . For hundreds of others , the &quot; live-aboards &quot; in the more_than 4 # 000 marina slips , the port is their permanent home . For others , the transients who sneak into container yards and set_up housekeeping in empty shipping boxes , the port is a temporary home . Patrolling and protecting all that are the Port Police , 55 sworn officers who patrol on land , in the air , on the water and even under the water . But you ' ll never read a book or see a movie in which the hero draws his gun and shouts , &quot; Freeze ! LAPP ! &quot; &quot; We ' re the best-kept secret in law_enforcement , &quot; says Lt . Ronald Boyd , Port Police operations commander . When he ' s working his special assignment beat , Port Police_Officer Robert Myers doesn ' t come face to face with criminals . He comes face to face with fish . About twice a month , Myers and others on the Port Police dive team put_on scuba gear and descend into the oily , silty , bacteria-rich black water of the Port of Los Angeles to search ships . Armed only with flashlights , and working in water where the visibility may be measured in inches , they creep slowly along the bottoms of boats , looking_for stashes of drugs concealed in rudders or stabilizer tubes or sea_chests , the large grated openings that serve as water intakes for engine cooling systems . Sometimes they find what they ' re looking_for . A couple of years ago , for example , dive team members found 55 kilos of cocaine sealed_in welded metal boxes hidden below the waterline on a freighter from South_America . &quot; When everything around you is black and all you can hear is the sound of your breathing , it gets a little claustrophobic , &quot; says Myers , 36 , an officer for the last dozen years , first with the Burbank Airport Police and for five years with the Port Police . It ' s not exactly clean diving , either , particularly after a downpour sends every conceivable kind of bacteria and assorted other crud flowing through the storm drains and into the harbor . If the bacteria level is too high , the divers won ' t dive unless it ' s an emergency . They all carry mouthwash and anti-bacterial eardrops to reduce the risk of infection from a dive . The 12-member dive team was formed in 1989 . All its members are volunteers who work patrol or other duties but are called_in when divers are needed . Dive team members do ship searches -- in conjunction with the U.S. Customs Service -- rescues , underwater searches for contraband or evidence ( such_as weapons ) , even retrieval of Harbor Department equipment from the ocean_bottom . &quot; Until a_few years ago , at least twice a year we ' d get people and cars going_into the water , &quot; says Lt . Martin Renteria , Port Police_investigations and administration commander , who heads the dive team . Operating under the Los Angeles Harbor Department , with an annual budget of about $ 6 million , the officers also protect the port and enforce environmental laws . Burglaries , robberies , truck hijackings , domestic arguments in the marinas , car thefts , assaults , and traffic violations by boats and vehicles all part of the job . Port Police_officers also perform foot and bike patrols in the Ports O ' Call Village , a waterfront restaurant and retail complex ; the World Cruise Center , the embarking point for cruise_ships , and at the Cabrillo Beach recreation area . Port Police_officers make about 175 arrests each year . The safety and environmental duties are more unusual . Last year , Port Police_officers conducted nearly 30 # 000 safety inspections in container terminals , oil tank farms and ships berthing at the port . They also check the channels and other harbor areas for illegal dumping or discharge of hazardous wastes . According to the people they serve , the port cops are doing a bang-up job . &quot; They ' re great , &quot; says Damaris Rausch , manager of the California Yacht Marina in the eastern portion of the port . &quot; Any time we ' ve called they ' ve gotten_out here immediately . They always seem friendly , and they ' re very helpful. &quot; Bob Kleist , a spokesman for Evergreen shipping lines , one of the port ' s largest companies , agrees . &quot; They ' re totally professional , extremely cooperative , well-motivated , well-directed. &quot; Despite recurrent rumors that the Port Police would be absorbed by the Los Angeles Police_Department , Boyd says it ' s not true . &quot; That rumor has been downgraded to even less than a rumor , &quot; he says . &quot; This is our swimming_pool , and we ' re going to continue to protect it. &quot; Like most police_officers , they feel underpaid : a non-supervisory officer makes about $ 2 # 800 to $ 3 # 200 a month . The salary is a sore point with most of them , as are the limited retirement and disability_benefits . But most port officers say they would n ' t want to work anywhere else . They especially like the diversity of the job . &quot; I like the flexibility , &quot; says Officer Daniel Aleman , a 13-year veteran . &quot; For example , I ' m a helicopter observer , I ' m on the bike team , and I ' m a senior patrol_boat officer . This job allows us to wear a lot of different hats. &quot; Aleman is an observer on the chopper , which is owned and operated by the city General Services_Department . Aleman ' s mission is to check the water for signs of environmental contamination . &quot; It ' s definitely not like being a forest ranger , &quot; says Port Police_Officer Robert Reynolds . Reynolds , a five-year veteran who earlier worked as an airport police_officer , is_on routine patrol today , which means that he ' ll cruise through everything from container yards to junk yards toslag heaps to the marinas -- some upscale and some not -- that line the waterfront . &quot; People down here are pretty friendly , &quot; Reynolds says . Port Police Detective Ken Huerta remembers well the strangest thing that he ' s ever seen stolen by cargo thieves . It was an entire truckload of rubber adult toys . It just goes_to show you , Huerta says , that cargo thieves will steal anything . Cargo_containers , also known as &quot; cans , &quot; are the 20- to 40-foot metal boxes that can be transferred from a ship to a truck or rail car . It ' s not uncommon for thieves to sneak into a freight yard somewhere in the vast industrial sections of the Los Angeles area , hot-wire a parked semi-tractor trailer and simply drive through a gate or crash a fence . The thieves can be murderous . Last year , hijackers shot and killed a truck_driver near Wilmington . Sometimes , though , the drivers are in on it . A &quot; broker &quot; will approach a driver who ' s making $ 5 an hour , non-union , and offer him $ 5 # 000 to give_up a truck and then report it stolen . Often , Huerta says , the broker gets the truck and pays the driver only $ 500 or so , if he pays him at all . It ' s a huge business , probably the biggest criminal enterprise in Los Angeles , next to drug dealing . Container burglaries , in which the can is broken_into in a yard and some of its contents taken , are a different category of crime . Huerta figures that every day in the Los Angeles area , about $ 1 million worth of goods are stolen or hijacked by cargo thieves .</TEXT>
