   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; THE REAL COLOMBIA ARRIVES TOO LATE ; GROUP_A : EARLY FAVORITE POSTS A SOLID 2-0 VICTORY OVER SWITZERLAND , BUT ITS TIME IS UP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Colombia team that many experts , including Pele , considered the world ' s best finally made an appearance Sunday , showing not only its fans but all fans of positive soccer what might have been if only Valderrama , Asprilla , Rincon and friends had unleashed their potential in the first or second games instead of waiting until the last . After disappointing losses to Romania and the United States , the Group_A favorites went_into their fast-forward mode before 83 # 769 at Stanford Stadium for a 2-0 victory over Switzerland . The Swiss argued about the legitimacy of the goals but not the result . They had been clocked and knew it . &quot; Colombia proved that it was rightfully labeled as one of the favorites , or at least as one of the outsiders to win the tournament , &quot; Switzerland Coach Roy Hodgson said . &quot; I don ' t feel terribly disappointed to lose to a team like that. &quot; He , of course , could afford to be gracious because the_Swiss will live for another day , finishing second in their group to advance to the second round Saturday in Washington against either Spain or Bolivia . As for the Colombians , who are going_home as the group ' s fourth-place team , the president of the country , Cesar Gaviria , said it all . &quot; The Colombian people are going_to be sad that we didn ' t progress in the tournament , &quot; he said . &quot; But we have to be satisfied that the Colombian players finally demonstrated the football they have inside. &quot; They might have had a short stay in the United States , but it must have seemed to them like it would never end . After feeling as if they had let_down their entire country in the opening loss to Romania , defender Luis Herrera ' s brother was killed in an automobile accident in Bogota and midfielder Gabriel Gomez left the team because of a death threat . Then , in the aftermath of the humiliating loss to the United States , their popular coach , Francisco Maturana , announced he was quitting after eight years in the job . He said Sunday he arrived_at that decision before the World Cup , but the timing of his announcement added_to the team ' s despair . With nothing more to lose , they played like it against Switzerland . &quot; Without so_much pressure on them , they had less of a responsibility , &quot; Maturana said . &quot; They felt freer. &quot; They were committed on defense , so_much so that reckless goalkeeper Oscar Cordoba had few chances to make the mistakes that cost the team so dearly in the first two games , and so relentless were midfielders Carlos Valderrama and Freddy Rincon and forward Faustino Asprilla on offense that Swiss goalkeeper Marco Pascolo will see them looming over him in his nightmares . So it is a shame they cannot feel more proud_of their goals , particularly the first one . It came only moments after Valderrama had leveled Swiss midfielder Ciriaco Sforza with an elbow to the jaw in the 44th minute , a certain red-card infraction had either the referee or linesman seen it . They apparently did not , but the referee did see a subsequent foul against Valderrama and awarded Colombia a free_kick . Valderrama aimed it over the_Swiss wall and into the penalty area , where midfielder Herman Gaviria caught the defense unsettled and headed it past Pascolo . One reason the defense was unsettled , Hodgson said later , was that the man who was supposed to mark Gaviria on set plays , Sforza , was still on the ground , writhing in pain . The impact of Valderrama ' s elbow was not limited to the moment . While the_Swiss fans took_out their frustrations in the second_half on the wild-haired Colombian , whistling derisively every time he touched the ball , so did Sforza , spending more time chasing him than organizing an attack . As a result of that , and injuries to Swiss midfielders Alain Sutter and Christophe Ohrel , there was no attack . Switzerland ' s best chance came_in the next-to-last minute , when forward Stephane Chapuisat received a through pass from Nestor Subiat just inside the penalty area but misfired over the goal . That set Colombia off on a counterattack , which it converted with a goal in the 90th minute by Harold Lozano . For the Colombians , it was an exclamation_point that , at least in their minds , erased an imposing question_mark .</TEXT>
