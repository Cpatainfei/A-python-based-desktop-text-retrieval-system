   <TEXT> Sharp price hikes for many agricultural and industrial commodities , and forecasts for even more gains ahead , have spurred renewed interest in the highly volatile and intensely risky &quot; futures &quot; market , where fortunes are made and lost in the blink_of_an_eye . Interest in the raw-materials side of the commodities markets was fairly moribund all through the 1980s and into the early 1990s , as investors focused_on more sophisticated financial products such_as stocks , bonds and interest_rate contracts , experts note . But thanks partly to soaring values for items such_as coffee , cocoa , lumber , cotton and copper , sophisticated investors are returning to &quot; traditional &quot; commodities and are promising a revival in this long-maligned industry . &quot; We have seen more interest in the commodity sector from sophisticated investors recently than we have seen in a long_time , &quot; says Hunt Taylor , managing director of Reynwood Trading Corp . in Short Hills , N.J. However , analysts readily acknowledge that the bulk of investors in this highly volatile market lose money rather than make_it . Even when the market holds the potential for stunning double-digit returns , investors must be cautious , they say . How do you make a killing without getting killed ? Realize , first , that there are essentially three ways to invest in commodities . You can invest on_your_own by setting_up a commodity trading account with your friendly neighborhood broker . The broker would then open a margin_account for you that would allow you to borrow a portion of the cost of each commodity contract from the brokerage . In other words , if you wanted to buy a $ 100 # 000 contract on wheat futures , the broker might require only a $ 5 # 000 deposit . The remaining $ 95 # 000 purchase_price would be borrowed from the brokerage_firm . As long as your contract rises in price -- or stays level -- the $ 5 # 000 is your entire cash investment . But if the value of the contract falls , you ' d be subject_to a &quot; margin_call , &quot; for which the broker requires you to kick_in more cash to secure your loan . You can also choose to trade through a commodity trading adviser . CTAs , like other money managers , agree to invest your money for a set fee . In the commodities market , the fee usually works_out to about 3 % of your assets , plus 15 % to 25 % of any profits the adviser earns for you . Most CTAs require minimum investments of $ 10 # 000 or more . Some won ' t take_accounts of less than $ 1 million . Because of the huge investment requirements with CTAs and the chance of losing more_than your initial investment when you open an individual commodities account , the bulk of middle-income investors are advised to enter this market through commodity pools . Commodity pools are the futures industry ' s answer to a mutual_fund . Operated by many major brokerage_firms , such_as Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter , commodity pools allow fairly modest investments of between $ 2 # 000 and $ 5 # 000 . Like mutual_funds , commodity pools are sold through prospectuses that detail many of the risks and rewards of the pool . It is imperative that investors read these documents carefully , because not all commodity pools are alike . Some are fairly conservative , while others are highly risky . Some boast long and illustrious track records , while others are new and have little to show in the way of past performance . What do you look_for in the disclosure documents ? * Risks . Pools must detail the risks of commodities investments in_general and of the pool in particular . Some of this is simply boilerplate , but it should prepare you for the general risks in the market . * Background of the principals . The principals of the pool must disclose pertinent information about their employment history , conflicts_of_interest and any past criminal , administrative and civil actions taken against them . * Investment methodology . Some pool investments are based on computerized models . Other pools follow technical trends or engage simply in discretionary trading . The pool will also disclose how its cash is divided among commodity trading advisers and what segments of the commodity market those advisers specialize in . If you want to invest in agricultural commodities , look_for a pool that specializes . If you want a diversified pool , make_sure the operators are dividing the pool ' s cash among a well-rounded group of CTAs . * Redemptions . To limit the possibility of a cash crunch that will force the pool managers to sell positions at inopportune times , most funds limit your ability to cash out_to just once a month or once a quarter . If you miss the redemption date , you must wait until the next one . If you have immediate needs for your cash , the redemption dates are pivotal . * Fees . Brace yourself . Fees in this industry are stunning . The average commodity pool will charge between 7.5 % and 10 % of your invested capital each year . However , if the results are still good , fees in this range shouldn ' t discourage you . * Performance . The hardest thing about reading a pool disclosure statement is that there is so_much performance information that it ' s hard to discern what it all means . Pools must disclose their month-by-month investment returns for their entire history or for three years , whichever is longer . If the pool doesn ' t have much of an investment history , it must disclose the investment history of its principals . Any adviser who invests more_than 10 % of the pool ' s assets will usually list his or her investment history as well . The figures should all be net of fees . In other words , what ' s reported is what investors earned after all fees and expenses were deducted . However , realize that when performance figures are listed for the CTAs rather than the pool , the pool ' s fees are not included . In other words , pool investment results are more telling than CTA investment results . Also be wary of hypothetical return information . Some pools &quot; back test &quot; newly formulated trading strategies and then report how they would have fared if they ' d used the strategy with real money . Hypothetical results always look great , but they mean nothing . Finally , realize that past performance does not predict future returns . However , past volatility is a good indicator of future volatility , says Sol Waksman , president of Barclay Trading Group Ltd. , a Fairfield , Iowa-based futures consulting and publishing_company . Waksman , who studies CTA returns , says many investors make the mistake of pouring their money into a pool immediately after it ' s had a great month . But they don ' t notice that monthly returns gyrate wildly . Then , when the inevitable happens and the fund has a losing month , they get frightened and bail_out . Jumping in and out of commodities is a great way to lose a lot of money quickly . Investors should carefully note how much the fund ' s results vary and determine whether they ' re comfortable living with the swings . If you ' re not , invest elsewhere .</TEXT>
