   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON THE HOLOCAUST ; WHEN WILL JEWS LET IT REST ? ; ' SCHINDLER ' S LIST ' SANCTIFIES AN AMORAL WAR PROFITEER ; THIS IS THE LAST STRAW IN THE OBSESSION WITH VICTIMIZATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the life of me I can ' t understand what possessed Steven Spielberg to make &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; to glorify a latter-day Robin_Hood who profited at the expense of Polish Jewry . In brief , this is Oskar Schindler , as depicted in the film , which , being shot almost completely in black_and_white , conveys the impression of a documentary : Schindler , a failed German businessman , goes_to Krakow in 1939 to make his fortune as a supplier of the German army . He takes_over a factory that the Nazis have appropriated from the Jewish owners . He persuades Krakow Jews , whose bank_accounts are being frozen , to provide him with the capital he needs to start the manufacture of cookware ; since they can ' t own money , he pays them back in pots and pans . He hires Jews because they are cheaper than Poles . He ingratiates himself with the most vile of the Nazi Establishment to keep his contracts -- and his obscene profits -- growing . In his personal life , too , Oskar Schindler is less than heroic , to put it mildly . He indulges in every excess of vanity and sensuality . With a wife back home , he keeps a mistress in Krakow while maintaining a years-long affair with his secretary . He lives like a prince ( in a home expropriated from Jews ) , wears the finest silk suits and jewelry , drives -- or is chauffeured -- in the most luxurious cars . All that he has is afforded by the round-the-clock labor of Jews , his virtual slaves . I would call it &quot; Swindler ' s List. &quot; As the movie evolves , Schindler decides to help &quot; his &quot; Jews for one of two reasons : because man also has a soul and he will have to give an accounting to G-d after death ; or that he play G-d by saving his worker-victims from the Nazi ovens and make even more profit . We really never know . In the end -- and this I find incredible , almost blasphemous -- Jews anoint him a tzadek , a righteous person of great rarity , sending the message : No matter how evil man is , he can change . I don ' t think so . Let me explain . I was a fifth-generation American growing_up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in the 1950s . With survivors of the Holocaust all around , it was like living_in the Twilight Zone . The butcher had a tattoo number from the Nazi camps , as did the baker and the teacher . Almost everyone had a number . I thought that when you came from Europe you received a number on your hand together with your passport . I can remember visiting a family and being told by the woman , &quot; How lucky you are , yingela , sonny-boy , that you have a father , a mother , a brother , a sister , uncles , aunts and even grandparents . The only thing I have left from Germany is this ! &quot; She shoved her hand with the blue tattoo in front of me . My teacher , a survivor of the camps , often would start to cry , thinking_of the suffering he and his family had experienced . Many of my classmates were from second marriages , with half-brothers and -sisters 10 or 15 years older . Either their father ' s or mother ' s first spouse had been killed and the survivor had remarried . In almost every household I visited , the fear of death and persecution persisted . There was hardly_a holiday or happy occasion that didn ' t end in a funeral speech for the family members who weren ' t there . At parties for newborn babies or Bar_Mitzvahs , there was always talk_about a dead or martyred relative for whom the child was named . At times I felt_like a victim myself for having been born free , healthy and safe in rich America . Survivors of the Holocaust would point to me and say , &quot; Look_at this American ! How old are you ? &quot; I would state my age . &quot; Yes , that ' s how old my son would be , but he was killed in the camp. &quot; Others would ask , &quot; How many brothers or sisters do you have ? &quot; After I answered , they would say , &quot; Lucky you ! Mine were killed before their Bar Mitzvah age. &quot; I became very sensitive to their cries of misery and untold misfortune . With this in mind , I am wondering why Jews in Hollywood are singing the praises of &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and its sanctifying of Oskar Schindler . He should be shown for what he was , a war profiteer , an opportunist , a carpetbagger of the worst kind , and not a &quot; righteous Gentile. &quot; Why did he make an effort to save Jews near the end of the war ? Was it because he knew that Germany was losing and wanted to have some Jews on his side ? Was it because he wanted to outsmart the Germans , or establish himself as a more superior Aryan than the other Germans ? What moral awaking occurred in this man driven to play G-d ? I really don ' t care to know . He went_to his grave with the answer . I understand that for many Jews this film is a sacred_cow and nothing bad should be said about it , just as the museums of the Holocaust are considered beyond criticism . However , truly speaking , for young Jewish Americans , these films and museums add nothing but fear . The message is that the world is never a safe place for Jews . Throughout Jewish history there have been untold catastrophes . Beginning with the enslavement in Egypt , millions of Jewish brothers and sisters were sacrificed ; millions more were dispersed ; all that they put into building new lives in the diaspora was lost , again and again . Yet there never was a need for museums . I am_sick and tired_of this generation identifying Judaism with suffering . Why is it imperative for our children and young people to visit Holocaust museums ? Why do they need to hear lectures about skinheads and neo-Nazis and growing anti-Semitism ? Why should they see every film about the Holocaust , always portraying Jews as victims running_for their lives ? I know what I am talking_about . I may_not make movies , but I run a school for children . What we should be doing is teaching the richness and everlasting greatness of our noble religion and not the negative experiences . It is preposterous to think that an American filmmaker can help preserve Judaism by showing a most horrific and pitiful scene of naked Jewish women huddled in the gas_chamber . This doesn ' t make better Jews , just better-selling movies . If for a moment you think that there is a moral lesson to be learned from &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; tell it to E.T. These movies , museums and displays only cause more pain . There is no enlightenment to be gained from seeing Jews as victims over and over again . If anything , it gives Jewish young adults further reason to think they should assimilate . &quot; Why be Jewish ? &quot; they ask after viewing such material . &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; is expected to make millions for its producers . If only this money were channeled into building Jewish schools and rehabilitating the children and grandchildren of Holocaust victims , then it would make some sense . What is sincerely needed is a commitment to end all negative portrayals of Jews . What is needed is for Jews , first of all , to say to Steven Spielberg and anyone else tempted to present Jews as victims and call it entertainment : Dayeno ! Enough !</TEXT>
