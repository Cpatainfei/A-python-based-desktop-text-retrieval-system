   <HEADLINE> PUBLIC NEEDS A SAY ON AIRPORT , BUT ITS PRICE_TAG MAY BE A SHOCK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * The initiative to convert the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station into a commercial airport will be_on the November ballot for all_of the Orange County voters to decide ( &quot; 113 # 000 Signatures Back El Toro Airport Vote , &quot; June 2 ) . Opponents to this initiative declare that this issue should not be decided by the public but rather by county planning_commissions . However , I believe that the public should have a voice in this matter because this is a critical issue that will affect all_of us in Orange County for years . We must look ahead 20 or more years , when the Irvine Ranch and other nearby undeveloped areas are fully developed with homes , apartments , condos , motels , hotels , recreation facilities , and all kinds of businesses . There will be a huge demand for airport services . John Wayne Airport will not be able to meet these demands . We will need another local airport . Where will it be ? Before El Toro became available , no one could find suitable locations . The El Toro base is now available with a ready-made airfield . As a taxpayer , I have already paid to have this airfield built at El Toro . I do not want my tax money wasted . El Toro can be modified for use as a commercial airport at a cost that is far less than what a new airport would cost . We cannot leave this decision to planning committees that are stacked with representatives from nearby cities who have their own particular interests in mind . Since a commercial airport at El Toro would use less than one half of the base area , many other developments can also be proposed , which the planning committees can work_on and resolve . We need the democratic process to resolve this critical airport matter . I am very pleased that I can vote on this important issue . ROBERT P . DAWSON Newport Beach * The article , &quot; Voters to Have Say on El Toro &quot; ( June 22 ) , sheds some light on the important issue of El Toro ' s future . As a mere Orange County resident with no perceptible ax to grind , I ' d like to see El Toro become a commercial airport . There ' s long been talk_of a need for an international airport . Maybe here ' s an answer . One question is &quot; What will be the relationship of El Toro to John Wayne ? &quot; Will John Wayne stay the same , decrease to only commuter and small-plane status ( after all_the money spent on roads , posh terminals and parking structures ) or allowed to grow , too ? I ' d guess developers and South County homeowners would like to see El Toro become houses , each for their own reasons . Homeowners around John Wayne Airport would like to see El Toro prosper and reduce some of John Wayne ' s traffic . What does Orange County need in addition to a larger airport ? It needs a jail site , low-cost housing ( modified barracks ? ) , and recreational / park space . Here ' s an opportunity to get all three in one fell swoop . I feel the voters would be shortsighted to side with a_few homeowners or developers and cheat themselves out of a great opportunity . JACK AND VIRGINIA THEIBERT Orange * In November voters will be asked to approve or disapprove an initiative to develop an all-day / all-night commercial airport as a reuse of the Marine Corps Air_Station at El Toro . We have been told that a &quot; yes &quot; vote means thousands of new jobs for Orange County . What we haven ' t been told is that this initiative socks us with a price_tag of a $ 1-billion bond issue ! So think_twice , taxpayers . Approval will not only damage our environment and quality_of_life , but it will heavily impact our pocketbooks . There are better ways ! ANITA C . SINGER Laguna Hills * A recent issue of your paper contained three letters opposing both the El Toro Marine base as a commercial airport and the countywide petition to vote on this issue . It is not surprising that all three were from residents of Irvine and Laguna Hills . They are , of course , biased and state some erroneous facts . The base was there as an airport long before most of the residents now opposing a commercial airport moved_into its vicinity . They should not now complain . Incidentally , commercial aircraft are much quieter than most military planes . An airport would be a financial boon for the whole county , the third largest in population in California and expected to increase by almost another 400 # 000 by 2003 . IRVIN C .
