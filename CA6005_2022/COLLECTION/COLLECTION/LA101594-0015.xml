   <HEADLINE> ITALIANS TURN_OUT AGAINST BERLUSCONI ' S POLICIES ; EUROPE : MILLIONS OF WORKERS STRIKE TO PROTEST CUTS IN SOCIAL BENEFITS . RALLIES ARE SOME OF THE LARGEST SINCE THE 1970S .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a heady spring of renewal , political rookie Silvio Berlusconi came_to power promising Italy a_million jobs and no new taxes . Now , in a restless and noisy autumn six months later , Berlusconi is the butt of economic disarray and social discontent among some of the same Italians who cheered him to office . On Friday , millions of workers struck in massive protest against their billionaire prime_minister ' s quest to balance the books of a country accustomed to living beyond its means . Berlusconi himself was far from the madding crowds Friday -- in Moscow on a trade mission -- but it seemed as if everybody else was in the streets of Italy . Huge rallies in sunlit piazzas up and down the peninsula were some of the largest since the 1970s . Called by the country ' s three largest unions , the strike protested Berlusconi ' s first budget , an adventure in austerity aimed at lopping a third off a swollen government deficit of about $ 100 billion . Planned pension pruning is what outrages Italians most . Labor_leaders claimed more_than 3 million marchers in the dozen largest cities . Police saw about two-thirds that number in protests that were sometimes angry but everywhere peaceful . Demonstrators marched in bright sunshine behind drums , trumpets , whistles , flags , banners and catcalls in more_than 30 cities , jamming landmarks such_as Piazza Santa Croce in Florence , Piazza del Duomo in Milan and Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome . The strike was nationwide and nominally for four hours , but many workers stayed away all day . Rail and air service was chaotic , with disruptions and cancellations even after their sector strikes ended . Private shops and businesses were open , but schools , banks , government_offices and many factories closed . Buses_stopped in nearly every city , and there were walkouts by hospital workers , immigration and customs officials and traffic police . &quot; Berlusconi Out &quot; was a favorite placard in Rome . The biggest march , more_than 200 # 000 strong , was in Milan , Italy ' s industrial heart and Berlusconi ' s hometown . Among the strikers there were workers from companies in his Fininvest empire , which had revenue of about $ 7 billion last year . &quot; The government says it hasn ' t touched people ' s rights , and it ' s true -- it ' s simply canceled them , &quot; said union leader Pietro Larizza in Milan . He termed the protest &quot; a gigantic vote of no confidence in the budget. &quot; In Moscow for talks with President Boris N . Yeltsin , Berlusconi did not seem impressed by the protests . &quot; You can ' t change the numbers , not with one strike , or with 10 strikes . The numbers are there . I found them ; I didn ' t produce them , &quot; he told reporters . At the head of a right-wing , free-market coalition , Berlusconi is seeking parliamentary approval for a budget that would cut about $ 33 billion from Italy ' s chronic deficit , reducing it to below 8.5 % of GNP in 1995 . Most of the cuts would come from social programs that were sacred_cows of previous governments led by political_parties that have since collapsed in corruption scandals . Berlusconi seeks reductions in spending on schools , defense , scientific_research and health_care , but the lion ' s share of the cuts are aimed at one of Europe ' s most generous -- and corrupt -- pension systems . Nearly a third of Italians draw pensions . Women can retire at 56 and men at 61 , but in some cases pensions are available at as much as 80 % of final salary after as little as 15 years ' work . In southern Italy particularly , tens of thousands of able-bodied citizens with political friends live_off disability pensions . The government is seeking to freeze early retirements and cut benefits as part of an austerity needed to reduce a government debt equal_to 123 % of last year ' s GNP . Economists applaud the austerity as a necessary tonic after years of overspending .</TEXT>
