   <TEXT> In the streets of the South_Korean capital , under the shadow of the North_Korean nuclear threat across the border , a substantial distance separates Kim Joo Ki and Kim Li Na -- generationally and politically . Kim Joo Ki , 69 , the owner of a furniture firm , is convinced that the South needs to develop its own nuclear_weapon as a counterthreat to the North , which he fears may be ready to blast South_Korea away . That is nonsense to Kim Li Na , 21 , a history major at Ehwa Women ' s University in Seoul . She says the United States and Japan are &quot; picking on North_Korea , &quot; which she believes would never use nuclear_weapons against its southern brethren . These two South_Koreans illustrate the sharp dichotomy here in attitudes toward the North . It is a tension between an emotional yearning to think the best of their fellow Koreans and a hardheaded view that the Communist regime of Kim Il Sung is dangerous , unpredictable and responsive to nothing but force . These polarized views are evident from the South_Korean grass roots to the office of President Kim Young Sam and have been blamed for sowing discord and disarray in the government ' s North_Korean policy . Pyongyang ' s abrupt announcement 10 days ago that it had begun removing fuel rods from an experimental nuclear_reactor in defiance of international demands may unify Kim ' s government around a firmer view . The president earlier this month created a special council to coordinate North_Korean policy in an effort to eliminate disarray . But in a country where everyone has an opinion on North_Korea , strongly held and often passionate , unifying the disparate views may_not be easy . &quot; The government is still cohabited by forces that are mutually suspicious , &quot; said Lee Dong Bok , a self-proclaimed hawk who was a key architect of South_Korea ' s northern policy for the last 20 years before being fired in December . &quot; It is causing a bloodletting , and it is weakening the foothold of President Kim ' s government. &quot; The tension is evident in the very labels used_to describe the two sides . Those who doubt Pyongyang ' s motives and advocate a hard line , including sanctions and even military_action if necessary , call themselves pragmatists and professionals . Their opponents call them outdated Cold Warriors . Those who counsel flexibility and concessions , including generous economic aid , regard themselves as liberals . But they are criticized as romantics and amateurs . The most prominent hawk is Lee . He was fired after revelations that he had unilaterally refused to sign an agreement with the North in defiance of orders from then-President Roh Tae Woo while serving as South_Korean representative for high-level South-North talks . Many regard Kim Deok , the director of the National Security Planning Agency , as Lee ' s ideological soul_mate . &quot; We are prepared to graduate from the legacy of the Cold_War , but we cannot do_it unilaterally , &quot; Lee said . &quot; As long as one party remains Cold War-oriented . . . you have got_to lock horns_in some manner. &quot; On the other side is Han Wan Sang , former deputy prime_minister and minister for unification of the two Koreas . He strongly supported a package deal giving North_Korea economic aid and dropping joint U.S.-Korean war_games in exchange for Pyongyang ' s return to compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . But Kim also fired Han in December because of suspicions that he was leaking unification board secrets to bolster his softer line . &quot; The idea that we can settle the nuclear issue by isolating , suffocating and sanctioning North_Korea is a Cold_War outdated myth , &quot; said one analyst sympathetic to the liberal side . &quot; North_Korea is facing a crisis of the system itself . If they are suffocated , they don ' t have any option but to attack in a joint suicidal-homicidal mission. &quot; The firings of both Lee and Han removed the government ' s most glaring dichotomy between hawk and dove . But even since then , Kim has continued to waver between the two camps , confusing many here and abroad . Analysts here were stunned when Kim , in his inaugural speech in February last year , proclaimed that &quot; no ideology or political belief has priority over national kinship. &quot; The implication was that North_Korea is more important to South_Korea than the United States is . Seoul ' s &quot; spin_doctors &quot; quickly moved_in to explain that the president meant nothing of the sort . The next month , Kim released a convicted North_Korean spy in a gesture of magnanimity to Pyongyang -- and the next day the Communist regime announced that it would withdraw from the non-proliferation treaty . Hard-liners here who saw the spy ' s release as a unilateral concession felt vindicated , but Seoul implored Washington not to convene the U.N. Security_Council to ask_for economic sanctions against Pyongyang because it bolted from the nuclear-control pact . By June , however , Kim had taken a tougher line . He declared before Asian Pacific bankers that &quot; we will not shake hands with anyone with nuclear weapons. &quot; When he met in August with Rhee Sang Woo , a Sogang University professor and chairman of Kim ' s 21st-Century advisory committee , he was a changed man . &quot; He told me : ' Do not be deceived by North_Korea . They are not people to be trusted , ' &quot; said the bemused Rhee , who has long advocated a firm line . Even after U.S. officials began talking_about cutting a package deal with Pyongyang in November , Kim continued his hawkish line , throwing_out roadblocks to a deal in his meeting with President Clinton . Officials here were worried that Seoul might be sacrificed in such an agreement , especially if Washington allowed Pyongyang to keep a nuclear bomb or two in exchange for pledges not to manufacture or sell them in the future . By December and January , as consensus grew in U.S. intelligence circles that North_Korea might already have developed one or two crude atomic weapons , Kim began saying he did not believe North_Korea possessed the bomb . He also said he would be willing to meet with North_Korean leader Kim Il Sung to settle the issue . Since then , South_Korea has generally toed a softer line , despite Pyongyang ' s recent threat to turn Seoul into a &quot; sea of fire. &quot; Analysts say Kim may be heavily influenced by Chinese President Jiang Zemin , who made_it clear when they met in March that he opposes sanctions . Indeed , South_Korea ' s ambassador to China , Hwang Byung Tai , stunned reporters at the time by announcing what seemed like a major policy turnabout : Seoul would begin giving China weight equal_to that of the United States in consultations over strategy on North_Korea , he said . Kim ' s aides forced Hwang to retract his statement . Such incidents , including a similar turnabout on Seoul ' s position on presidential envoy exchanges between North and South , have raised repeated charges of confusion and conflict in Kim ' s policies . Not everyone is complaining , of course . One U.S. official praised Kim ' s team for taking a &quot; very constructive and intellectual approach. &quot; This official said past Seoul administrations were dominated by &quot; slash-and-burn &quot; conservatives bent_on destroying the North_Korean regime . The official said they sabotaged high-level contacts between Pyongyang and Washington . Some analysts insist discord is inevitable . Although hawks and doves always existed in the past , the voices of appeasement were often repressed by military governments who used the North_Korean threat to justify their existence . Kim , as the first civilian president , does not need the issue to legitimize his government . At the same time , the policy conflicts are more visible in the more open , democratized nation : More officials leak details of meetings , and more newspapers report them . More people also play politics with the issue , criticizing Kim for being too soft or hard , too close to Washington or overly influenced by China , too neglectful_of Seoul ' s political interests . Kim , who has a flair for reading the public mood , often responds to those concerns . The result can be &quot; conducting foreign_policy by reading local headlines , &quot; as one critic told a newspaper here . In addition , the president must tread a delicate line between two top policy concerns that in some ways conflict : resolving the nuclear issue and strengthening the nation ' s international competitiveness -- particularly after agreement in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks to open_up markets globally , said Ahn Byung Joon , a Yonsei University professor of political_science . &quot; If we give the impression that the nuclear issue is more important , we run the risk of arousing concern about the safety and credibility of Korean industry , &quot; Ahn said . &quot; President Kim can ' t just take an aggressive stance . He has to please several different constituencies. &quot; Some hotels , such_as the Westin Chosun , report that occupancy_rates are down compared to last May and say the nuclear threat may be one reason . But in_general there is no obvious sense of crisis : Letters_of_credit and tourism are up over last year . The stock_market remains as active as shopping districts , where people gaily fill coffee_shops , restaurants and movie_theaters . College_student Chung Young Rim , 25 , said her friends outside South_Korea are more worried about the threat than she is . &quot; It seems they know more about North_Korea than I do . I ' m wondering if the government is hiding something from us. &quot; Rhee , the Sogang professor , says the new coordinating committee should make a big difference in unifying policy . The reason , he says , is highly Confucian and therefore Korean : Newly appointed Unification Minister Lee Hong Koo went_to Seoul National University with fellow committee_members Han Sung Joo , the foreign_minister ; Kim , the national security chief , and Chung Jong Uk , senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs and national security . Lee also went_to the same high_school as Han and Kim . &quot; They are all his juniors , and he is the boss , &quot; Rhee said . &quot; They cannot say no to him . He will be able to unify the government. &quot; A President on Both Sides of the Issue There is division in South_Korea between the dovish view that North_Koreans are follow countrymen and the two nations should be reunited , and the hawkish view that the Communists are dangerous and unpredictable . South_Korean President Kim Young Sam appears to waver from one view to the other . Kim Young Sam : &quot; No Ideology or political belief has priority over national kinship. &quot; ( February , 1993 ) &quot; Do not be deceived by North_Korea . They are not people to be trusted. &quot; ( June , 1993 , quoted by Prof . Rhee Sang Woo )</TEXT>
