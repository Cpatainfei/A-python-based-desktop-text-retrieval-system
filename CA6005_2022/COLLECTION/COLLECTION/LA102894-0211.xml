   <HEADLINE> ' AMERICA WILL STAND WITH YOU , ' CLINTON REASSURES ISRAELIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel must_not &quot; give_in to the doubts that terror brings , &quot; President Clinton exhorted Thursday as he pledged to the Israeli people that &quot; your journey is our journey , and America will stand with you now and always. &quot; Speaking_to the Knesset , Israel ' s Parliament , Clinton was continuing an 18-month effort to minister to the Israeli psyche -- telling a nation scarred by recent acts of terror that peace has begun to yield true benefits and that the final goal has come within sight . &quot; Once in this area , you were shunned , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; Now , more and more you are embraced. &quot; Israelis , he said , have begun to see &quot; that they can free themselves from siege. &quot; Watched from the visitors ' gallery by the parents of Israeli Cpl . Nachshon Waxman , who was kidnaped earlier this month by extremists and killed in an unsuccessful rescue attempt , Clinton said Americans share Israel ' s grief over its losses . But achieving a stable peace , he said , is the best way to put an end to such attacks . &quot; After all_the bloodshed and all your tears , you are now far closer to the day when the clash of arms is heard no more and all_the children of Abraham -- the children of Isaac and the children of Ishmael -- will live side_by_side in peace , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; It is the promise of making_sure that all those who have sacrificed their lives did not die in vain. &quot; The goal of the terrorists , Clinton said , &quot; is to make the people of Israel , who have defeated all odds on the field_of_battle , to give_up . . . on the peace by giving_in to the doubts that terror brings_to every one of us . But having come so far , you cannot give_up or give in. &quot; And in a final , highly personal fillip , Clinton recounted to his listeners how his onetime pastor , a mentor now dead , had enjoined him to stand_by Israel . Thirteen years ago , he said , he and Mrs . Clinton visited Jerusalem ' s holy sites with their pastor as part of a religious mission . A few years later , &quot; when he became desperately ill , he said he thought I might one day become President. &quot; At that point , Clinton recounted , his friend and teacher told him , &quot; ' If you abandon Israel , God will never forgive you. ' He said it is God ' s will that Israel , the biblical home of the people of Israel , continue for ever and ever. &quot; Clinton ' s emotional and largely extemporaneous speech was the latest effort in a campaign that he began early in his presidency after a meeting with Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin . At the meeting , as Clinton has recounted since , Rabin pledged that he would &quot; take risks for peace. &quot; Clinton , in turn , asked what steps the United States could best take_to help the process of peace . The Israeli leader urged the President to use his office to reassure Israelis , who face a series of deeply unsettling decisions about relinquishing land in return for promises of peace from neighboring Arab states . Those doubts within Israel have deepened of late , both because the nation now faces the extremely divisive issue of whether to relinquish the long-occupied Golan Heights to Syria -- something that Rabin had previously pledged not to do -- and because of recent , dramatic terrorist acts . Clinton saw that division on clear display before his speech , as Rabin and opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu both delivered long talks outlining their contrasting positions on the question of trading land for peace . Netanyahu , whose Likud bloc opposes trading away any of the territory now under Israel ' s control , sharply attacked any suggestion that international forces on the Golan , perhaps including Americans , could adequately provide_for Israel ' s security if the land were returned to Syria . &quot; Only Israeli forces on the Golan can protect Israel , &quot; Netanyahu declared . And he broke_off from his Hebrew text to speak in English as he chided Clinton for not accepting Israel ' s position that Jerusalem must remain , undivided , under Israeli control . Jerusalem &quot; is a united city under Israeli sovereignty , and it will always be so , &quot; Netanyahu declared . Clinton , like his predecessors in the White_House , has taken the position that the final status of Jerusalem should be determined as part of an overall settlement of all issues between Israel and its Arab neighbors . Clinton ' s mission of reassurance over the past 1 1 / 2 years has suited him , given his deep beliefs both in the power of words and in the importance of psychological factors_in human affairs . Ever since Rabin talked to him about the issue , the President has taken repeated opportunities -- interviews on Israeli television , public speeches and other occasions -- to repeat the basic message that Israel does not stand alone and that Israelis can now afford to drop their long-ingrained siege mentality . Thursday ' s Knesset speech provided the highest-profile forum that Clinton has yet had for making those points . He seized the opportunity with considerable energy , despite an exhausting schedule in which he spoke until well after midnight Wednesday night with Jordan ' s King Hussein in Amman , then left near dawn to fly to Damascus for almost four hours of meetings with Syrian President Hafez Assad before flying here for still more meetings , the speech and a press_conference . Clinton began his speech with a recitation of the steps the United States has taken_to &quot; minimize the risks of peace &quot; -- efforts to enhance Israel ' s military , particularly its air_force , joint projects to develop defenses against missile attacks such_as those that hit Israel from Iraq during the Persian_Gulf_War , and steps to expand Israel ' s economy . And he repeated U.S. pledges to work for the elimination of the remaining parts of the Arab boycott of Israel and to maintain Israel ' s strategic edge_in military power . His speech began visibly to gain energy toward the end , as Clinton abandoned his prepared text and warmed_to a series of scriptural images -- a favored rhetorical_device for this President steeped in the southern tradition of biblical politics . Repeating a line he had used the previous day before the Jordanian Parliament , Clinton reminded his listeners that the Koran recounts Mohammed ' s saying to people of other faiths that &quot; there is no argument between you and us . God will bring us together , and unto him is the homecoming. &quot; And Moses , he said , had told his people as they prepared to cross the River Jordan that they must &quot; choose life so that you and your descendants may live. &quot; Those who are willing to make_peace with their neighbors are choosing life , Clinton said , &quot; and once again , America is proud to walk with you. &quot; Clinton ' s speech was warmly received by the legislators . And he heard similarly enthusiastic greetings from city crowds along his way Thursday . Landing at Tel Aviv ' s airport after flying from Damascus in late afternoon , the President passed enthusiastic crowds that lined the streets as his lengthy motorcade entered Jerusalem to the sound of pealing church_bells . Today the President heads to Kuwait and Saudi_Arabia for a speech to U.S. troops and discussions of security issues .</TEXT>
