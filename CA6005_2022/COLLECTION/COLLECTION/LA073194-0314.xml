   <HEADLINE> PANEL RULES FRENCH LAW AGAINST FOREIGN WORDS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> France ' s constitutional watchdog Saturday partially overturned a controversial law to enforce use of the_French language . The nine-member Constitutional Council ruled that the government had no right to impose official French translations of foreign words on private citizens , companies and the media . It could only force their use by public authorities and nationalized companies other_than radio and television . Among the words the government sought to ban in advertisements , broadcasts , menus and books were &quot; cheeseburger , &quot; &quot; cash flow , &quot; &quot; marketing , &quot; &quot; software &quot; and &quot; air bag. &quot; The council said articles of the law , adopted by Parliament on July 1 , violated freedom of expression and communication as guaranteed in the preamble to the_French constitution . &quot; Freedom of expression implies the right of each citizen to choose the most appropriate terms to express his thought , &quot; the council ruled . &quot; Like any living language , the_French language evolves . . . . It cannot remain frozen. &quot; If official terms were imposed , French &quot; would risk becoming a dead language , &quot; the ruling said . But the council upheld the section affecting government officials and employees , citing Article 2 of the constitution , which stipulates that &quot; the language of the republic is French. &quot; Martin Malvy , president of the Socialist caucus in Parliament that challenged the law , called the ruling &quot; good news for democracy and for the French-speaking world , &quot; which he said &quot; needs more writing than gendarmes. &quot; The newspaper Le Monde called the ruling a triumph of common_sense , but the ruling was read quite differently by the government . Culture Minister Jacques Toubon , who initiated the law to try to repel an &quot; Anglo-Saxon invasion &quot; of English words , called the ruling &quot; extremely positive &quot; but acknowledged that it meant the government could not tell private citizens what words to use . Toubon said the legislation was vital to the long-term survival of the_French language , which was being eroded in such areas as medical and scientific seminars . Ridiculed abroad , the law enjoyed broad public support in France , according to opinion polls , except among people under 25 , whose slang is often peppered with English terms picked_up from rock_music . Fines of up_to $ 3 # 700 had been proposed for violations of the law . Fines already exist for announcements such_as theater posters and airline boarding passes not printed in French , but the regulations have rarely been enforced .</TEXT>
