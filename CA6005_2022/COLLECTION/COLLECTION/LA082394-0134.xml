   <HEADLINE> VALLEY INTERVIEW ; AIDS RESEARCH PIONEER GOTTLIEB OFFERS PATIENCE AND CONFIDENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There is a greater awareness of the killer disease known as AIDS since it was discovered in 1981 , but the number of people infected with the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome continues to grow . According to the World_Health_Organization , in the last 12 months 3 million more people worldwide have become infected with HIV . To date , more_than 17 million people are infected , setting a pace for as_many as 40 million by the year 2000 . Earlier this month , at the 10th annual International AIDS Conference in Yokohama , Japan , many scientists used the word &quot; crisis &quot; to describe the state of AIDS research . Many researchers have concluded that 10 years after finding the &quot; bug &quot; that causes AIDS -- but no cure -- it is time to put more emphasis on basic research . Federal_officials have announced plans to revamp the $ 1.3-billion annual AIDS budget to devote more time to laboratory studies and less to clinical research to test new treatments . Still , there has been some progress . The drug AZT has been found to reduce the transmission of HIV from infected mothers to their children by two-thirds . Antiviral drugs called protease inhibitors have also been found to block an enzyme that is intimately linked to viral replication . Dr. Michael S . Gottlieb , who reported the first known cases of AIDS in 1981 , remains optimistic that progress has been made and will continue to be made in the fight against AIDS . Gottlieb , who has offices in Sherman Oaks , Pasadena and Century City , spoke with Times staff writer Julio Moran . * Question : Do you think that some scientists have concluded that we are back to square one in AIDS research because 10 years later we still do not have a vaccine for HIV ? Answer : I think that people are frustrated and disappointed , and it is natural for them to feel that way . After all , 250 # 000 people in the United States have died of AIDS ; 150 # 000 people today in the U.S. are living with AIDS . Another 100 # 000 test positive for HIV every year . I think people care a lot more today about better treatments because they know or have known people with AIDS . People are frightened and frustrated and disappointed and expect faster progress . But in medical research , 10 to 15 years is a relatively short time frame . Q : So you personally are not surprised that there have not been more developments in AIDS research ? A : No , there have been a lot of developments . None have been home_runs . On the other hand , it hasn ' t been a no-hitter . Even at the Japan conference there were a number of developments that could be called singles or even doubles . The ability of AZT to cut_down on the transmission of HIV from mother to baby is a very significant development . It raises a whole_lot of additional ethical questions about the lack of availability of AZT in many countries around the world where mother-to-child transmissions are occurring . But on a purely medical level , our ability to affect something as important as mother-to-child transmission , while admittedly a very focused and limited application of technology , to me it is an indicator that we are not at a research standstill . Q : Has research up_to now been limited to finding a vaccine , or is that merely a public misperception ? A : I think it is natural for people to anticipate something dramatic like the Salk vaccine for polio , which was a very dramatic_event in world history . That event has set_up an expectation which in this case hasn ' t been fulfilled because the virus has been so elusive . Q : More elusive that when you first saw the disease in 1981 ? A : When the virus was first described , we did not appreciate just how complex and evasive and formidable it was . With every year , the new information we have gathered about it continues to add_to its reputation as a bad actor . We did not anticipate how tough and adaptable HIV is . Q : Do you see the Japan conference as a starting-over point ? A : There is some of that , and I think that ' s healthy in any endeavor , especially science , to revamp a strategic plan . I don ' t entirely agree with the new strategy of the Office of AIDS Research to put a much greater emphasis on basic biology research , in some cases on viruses other_than HIV , in_order to try to understand HIV much better . The study of other viruses is important , but HIV is the one that should be most intensely under the microscope . I ' m also concerned that the strategy is a reversion to the business-as-usual modus_operandi of the National Institutes of Health before HIV . It is based on the idea in science that breakthroughs come_about when scientists are totally free to choose what to work_on without being directed to work_on specific problems by someone else . Q : You don ' t agree with that ? A : In principle I agree . However , when it comes_to a global emergency that threatens the survival of the species , I favor a more focused approach . It may_not require bringing_together scientists from all_over the country to a Los Alamos , but I support scientists working together in a more focused , goal-oriented way on AIDS . Q : Have there been factors that have hampered finding an HIV vaccine by now ? A : The absence of a good animal model has been a very big issue . HIV has a preference for human_beings . It has very specifically evolved to become a parasite of humans . There are related viruses with some similarities , but specifically vaccine trials for HIV must be tested on an animal that is susceptible to HIV . that ' s why there are so many ethical dilemmas about HIV vaccine trials because the human_being is the most suitable experimental animal . Q : Do you think the public still believes that AIDS is only a gay disease ? A : I think there is still some of that . But most people becoming infected with HIV outside Western Europe and the United States are not gay_men . By the year 2000 , the gender difference will disappear worldwide . In this country , in the last 18 months 8 % of new cases reported were heterosexuals who acquired HIV through sexual_activity . Q : Do you think that the growing number of women with HIV will bring more attention for AIDS ? A : Women with HIV are becoming more organized and vocal with_respect_to needs for services for themselves and their children . They have become more politically active . That seems to be taking_off around the globe . That is a very welcome development . A lot of the spread of HIV around the world has to do with the second-class citizenship of women . In many countries , woman are treated as property and have very little choice in deciding whether they have_sex or not , and whether their partner uses a condom . Q : Are you surprised that the number of people infected with HIV continues to grow ? A : It has grown in relationship to poverty and prostitution and apathy . And it ' s growing because we are late in getting serious about curbing it . For example , given the social mores in Thailand , it was highly predictable it would become a hot spot . Yet , preventive efforts were insufficiently intensive to prevent a catastrophe . On another level , it relates to HIV itself . Just as it exploits weaknesses of the immune_system , its spread globally depends_on weaknesses in social_structures and human behavior . Q : Some people have compared HIV to cancer , in that both are fatal and a vaccine has not been found for either one . Is that a fair comparison ? A : I think it is a little unfair to compare the two . Most cancers do not have anything as specific as a virus as the cause . HIV depletes the immune cells , where you usually think_of cancer as a multiplication of cells . Since we know that HIV is the instigator , we have a leg up in finding an effective therapy . I believe that we have a better chance of finding treatments for HIV than in the case of cancers . Q : What about your patients ? Has their outlook changed in the last 14 years ? A : I ' ve seen it go from hopelessness to hope , and now hopelessness again . A misreading of the current state of care is leading to hopelessness . We have news_reports that reinforce to a person that they are going_to die from HIV . Doctors are seeing a relapse toward quackery and therapies that offer false hope . Q : Do you see an increase in HIV patients turning_away from traditional doctors ? A : Patients always have sought alternative therapy . I think now there is more disenchantment with the approved antiviral drugs and a misreading of the new information coming_out of the international meeting in Yokohama . Q : So some of your treatment is not just for the body , but for the mind ? A : Sometimes I do feel_like a cheerleader . For patients to come_away from a conference resigned to the fact that there is no hope is very damaging . But to say we are back to square one -- that we have made no progress and that research is at a standstill , or that the problems are insurmountable or that we will never solve these problems -- is just plain wrong .</TEXT>
