I don ' t want to say it was cold here in the Northland yesterday , Bjorn , but my nose almost fell_off my face . I ' m talking Minus Six Degrees of Separation here . Ya , your face looks_like a teapot , Bob . Are those your ears or are you auditioning for the Norwegian production of &quot; Dumbo ? &quot; Very funny , Bjorn .

Here in the big Norge outdoor refrigerator , 66 different lands from around the globe will be represented in the big parade of nations ! I hope those men from American_Samoa brought their flannels , Bjorn . And some Chap-Stick , Bob . Among the dignitaries here today , Bjorn , will be King Harald and Queen Sonja from your beautiful country ! Right you are , Bob . I had a chance to speak with the King last night at the big Heineken-Heineken Light party promoting Heineken Bowl XVII and &quot; ABC ' s Monday Night Skiing &quot; with Dan Dierendoorfen . Who was the King with , Bjorn ? The Palace Cowboy cheerleaders , Bob . What did the King say , Bjorn ? He said , &quot; It ' s good to be the King , &quot; Bob . Say , how was that party , Bjorn ? Great , Bob ! Great food ! I had myself a double reindeer whopper with fries and a large Ovaltine shake . Mmmm , delicious . You should ' ve been there . Count me out , Bjorn .

Why ' s that , Bob ? Health_care ! Maybe your First_Lady will do the wave , Bob . When we went_to Albertville two years ago , Francois Mitterand and Dan Quayle did the wave .
