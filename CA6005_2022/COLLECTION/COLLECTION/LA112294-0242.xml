   <HEADLINE> USDA TRIES TO SERVE_UP FOOD_STAMPS TO THE HUNGRY ; POVERTY : MILLIONS HAVE BEEN SPENT TO MAKE THE PROGRAM ACCESSIBLE . CRITICS SAY IT ENCOURAGES WELFARE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bucking the anti-welfare movement , the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture is bankrolling a crusade to attract people to food_stamps -- the most broadly used federal anti-hunger effort , already serving one in nine Americans . The effort is a striking turnaround for the USDA , which has issued grants totaling more_than $ 2.5 million to 27 groups since last year in an attempt to make food_stamps , the largest of 14 federal hunger programs , more accessible . Such federal outreach funding was banned throughout much of the 1980s , as government shunned the notion that taxpayers should pay to promote welfare programs . The new policy means taxpayers are now underwriting the efforts of anti-hunger advocates such_as Cynthia Lottie . Twice a week , Lottie and others from the nonprofit Southern California Interfaith Hunger Coalition scour welfare offices , hoping to ease the way for many among the millions who are eligible for food_stamps but not receiving them . On a recent morning , Lottie passes throngs of security_guards and a metal detector as she enters the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social_Services office Downtown . Every chair inside is taken , and people line the walls . The air reeks of sweat . Social_workers in 12 plexiglass booths address people through microphones . Lottie announces : &quot; Anyone have a problem with their case ? &quot; &quot; Yes ! Right here ! &quot; exclaims Milton Oppenheimer , madly waving his arms in the air . Oppenheimer , 35 , is beleaguered . This is his second trip to the office to apply for food_stamps in the past week . On this day , he arrived_at 7 a.m. After he repeatedly asked why he hasn ' t been put_on food_stamps , the homeless man says , his social_worker shut_off her two-way microphone and shoved his application aside , asking him to move along . A security_guard who has been out_of_work for two months , Oppenheimer says he is despondent . &quot; I ' m in limbo . I think they put my papers in the circular file. &quot; Lottie offers to help the Marine Corps veteran . Oppenheimer cheers her on . &quot; Sure ! Go_in there ! Kick some tail ! &quot; He adds : &quot; Once you get hungry you get desperate . Then , you take_care of No . 1 . . . . This is America . C ' mon . I ' m a veteran , for God ' s sake. &quot; Lottie files a complaint , then prods the social_worker to put Oppenheimer on food_stamps , arguing that he is clearly eligible . An hour later , Oppenheimer ' s name blares over the loudspeaker as he is called to be fingerprinted and issued a food_stamp identification card . Oppenheimer says he can now spend his time looking_for another job as a security_guard or in a factory rather than standing in soup_kitchen lines . As a homeless man , Oppenheimer is part of one group the federal_government is trying to reach through its new efforts to promote hunger assistance programs . Others are the elderly and the working poor -- people who often don ' t know about food_stamps , falsely believe they are not eligible , are stymied by the bureaucracy or avoid applying out of shame , sometimes going hungry instead , USDA officials say . The policy shift -- which probably will be reviewed by the new Republican majority in Congress -- also reflects a recognition of research that shows the ranks of hungry Americans have burgeoned to up_to 30 million , many of them children . In Los Angeles , $ 200 # 000 in federal money now funds seven public_service television ads -- airing in English and Spanish since August -- that urge people to look_into food_stamps . &quot; Food_stamps can help you in tough times , &quot; the announcer intones , flashing the Interfaith Hunger Coalition hot_line number . A San Francisco grant helps five city outreach workers promote food_stamps in senior_citizen centers and subsidized child-care centers . And in New York City , the Community Food Resource Center Inc. scours unemployment , utility and telephone offices to sign people up . Soon , the USDA will announce a $ 5-million , two-year national nutrition education blitz by the agency . The aim is not only to inform children about the benefits of good eating , but to use the agency ' s first coast-to-coast billboard , television , radio and print ad_campaign to highlight the nation ' s anti-hunger programs . Some oppose the agency ' s new outreach attempts . &quot; The government should be discouraging people from getting_on welfare . We used to tell people we wanted them to be self-sufficient , &quot; says Robert Rector , senior welfare policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think_tank . The federal_government will spend $ 40.2 billion in fiscal 1995 for 14 anti-hunger programs , including food_stamps and school lunches , roughly 60 % of the Agriculture_Department ' s budget . &quot; What we are doing is generating a huge population of dependent people who work less , marry less and rely_on the government more , &quot; Rector said . Many in Congress are moving_in the opposite direction of the Agriculture_Department , determined to cap spending on food_stamps and other welfare entitlement programs whose budgets until now have expanded to meet the burgeoning numbers of eligible applicants . Almost 69 % of those eligible received food_stamps in 1992 , the most recent figure available -- up from nearly 56 % in 1989 . One welfare reform bill -- which estimates that the total welfare tab will swell from $ 328 billion to $ 500 billion by 1998 -- requires that the growth_rate in these programs be held to 3.5 % each year . But USDA officials and many food policy experts point_out that two-thirds of the elderly who are eligible for food_stamps and more_than half of the working poor go without . Some opt instead for church-sponsored food pantries , but these , facing more clients and fewer food donations , are overwhelmed , forcing them to limit their assistance and turn_away many requests for help . &quot; There are many needy people who aren ' t participating , &quot; said James Ohls , a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research Inc. , which conducts government studies on food_stamps . Contrary to widespread perceptions of dependency , most food_stamp recipients use the program for less than seven months . More_than a third , however , again sign_up for food_stamps within a year of leaving the program . &quot; A lot of this is people moving_in and out of jobs , &quot; said University of Wisconsin professor and welfare expert Maurice MacDonald , who contends that food_stamps therefore are doing exactly what society wants : preventing hunger . Recent studies , MacDonald said , have measured the disincentive to work generated by food_stamps and found the effect is minor . &quot; These programs exist to serve all who are eligible and hungry . If we aren ' t reaching them , we should , &quot; said USDA Undersecretary Ellen Haas , who intends to continue outreach funding . The government ' s new efforts are unlikely to curb what many see as the main factor driving hunger : the growing number of people falling_into poverty . Although outreach , increased government assistance and an expanding economy drastically reduced the ranks of the hungry in the 1970s , their numbers soared by 50 % between 1985 and 1991 , according to Tufts University reports , as global economic shifts brought a loss of manufacturing jobs and erosion of income . &quot; The problem is more with our poverty policy than our hunger policy . It is our continuing failure to address poverty , &quot; said Peter Eisinger , director of the La Follette Institute of Public Affairs , Public Policy and Administration Program at the University of Wisconsin . Contrary to earlier spurts of economic_growth , expansion of the economy in the 1980s and 1990s pulled more people -- now almost one in six -- into poverty , as a growing number were left to compete for low-paying service jobs . Earnings for the average man without a high_school degree plummeted to an inflation-adjusted $ 14 # 439 in 1989 from $ 22 # 858 in 1967 . Mounting divorce rates and out-of-wedlock births have left more parents to raise and feed children on one salary . Spending on public housing declined , forcing nearly half of low-income families to spend 70 % of their earnings on housing , and less on food . Those who seek_out government assistance such_as Aid to Families with Dependent Children have seen benefits for a family of three plummet 47 % since 1970 , when adjusted for inflation . &quot; The government must create incentives to keep jobs in the U.S. &quot; and discourage their flight to lower-wage countries , said Marc Cohen , senior research associate with the nonprofit advocacy group Bread for the World . &quot; The problem isn ' t really with the ( anti-hunger ) programs . It is with the lack of high priority for a full_employment economy. &quot; Still , in California , only half of those eligible for food_stamps receive them . Focus groups conducted this summer by the nonprofit California Food Policy Advocates found that many falsely believe a person must be homeless or unemployed to qualify for food_stamps ; many elderly say that despite hunger , they cannot ask_for a government handout . Others say that because food_stamp benefits are adjusted according to a person ' s income , small benefits for some are outweighed by application waits that can last_days in dangerous and dirty welfare offices . Welfare offices often close their doors early -- 2 p.m. in Los Angeles . Anyone with a car valued at more_than $ 4 # 550 is disqualified . Food_stamp recipients must file monthly reports and reapply every six months , even if their incomes do not change . Those who want to apply for various federal anti-hunger programs must deal with up_to four separate agencies that manage the programs in California , according to the Government Accounting Office , Congress ' investigative arm . &quot; We need to simplify procedures , &quot; Haas said . &quot; Today , many people sit in food_stamp offices all day. &quot; Participation problems affect other USDA anti-hunger programs , where nearly two-thirds of recipients , according to the GAO , are children . Most children who are eligible for a free or reduced-price breakfast at school don ' t get_it because their districts don ' t participate in the program . Fewer than 17 % of children getting free or reduced-price lunches at school last year received summer meals because of the lack of sponsors , according to the Food Research and Action Center . Ohls , the government ' s food_stamp researcher at Mathematica , noted that those receiving food_stamps typically get enough coupons to last three weeks , leaving them hungry the last week of the month . The average benefit , 74 cents per meal , is only about half of what the USDA calculates is needed for a nutritionally balanced_diet . Benefits are low because the Agriculture_Department ' s formula unrealistically assumes that even applicants with very low incomes can set_aside 30 % for food , Ohls said . Another assumption -- that people who often lack cars can shop_at low-priced supermarkets absent from many inner_cities -- is equally unrealistic , said David Super , general counsel for the Center_on Budget and Policy Priorities , a liberal research group . &quot; Clearly , &quot; Ohls said , &quot; people who are_on food_stamps are hungry . It is not satisfying all their food needs. &quot; Among the USDA ' s highest priorities now is to substitute a plastic credit_card for traditional paper food_stamp coupons . The recipient ' s benefit amount becomes a kind of credit limit ; purchases are deducted at the cash_register . The process , which operates in six areas of the country , is meant to be less vulnerable to fraud and also reduce the stigma for food_stamp users . California ' s program is scheduled to begin in San Bernardino and San Diego counties in 1995 , followed by Los Angeles the next year . While the government moves to modernize its food_stamp program , people like Sondra Trudeau are at the front_lines in welfare offices , helping the public sign_up . Trudeau , an Interfaith Hunger Coalition trainee , encounters people struggling with the 10-page food_stamp application -- shorter than those in other states , which run_up to 40 pages long . Sometimes tempers flare . &quot; If I see you on the street , I ' ll kill you . I ' ll kill you , &quot; one woman says , gesturing angrily in a social_worker ' s direction as security_guards guide her toward the door of the South-Central office . A 58-year-old woman with bad eyesight who can ' t read or write approaches Trudeau , who has helped three others get food_stamps today . Her food_stamps stopped eight months ago -- she ' s not sure why , but she wants to get them again . This is her seventh trip to the office , says the former garment_worker , who is looking_for work as a nanny or cleaning lady because she can no longer see well enough to sew . &quot; No one will help me , &quot; she laments , explaining that she has spent five hours in the office today alone . Nearly two hours later , Trudeau has worked with the woman ' s social_worker to gain her $ 115 in food_stamps and $ 212 in_general relief . Deeply moved , the woman , explaining that she is very hungry , quietly says to Trudeau , &quot; Thank God . Thank you. &quot; About This Series In this series , The Times examines four battlegrounds in the war on hunger in Southern California . * Sunday : Hungry children , caught in the battles over school breakfast . * Monday : The growing salvage food industry -- spawned by hard_times -- takes a bite_out of charitable food_banks . * Today : U.S. Department_of_Agriculture changes_course and launches a crusade to attract more people to food_stamps . * Wednesday : A one-woman crusade to ease neighborhood hunger , one family at a time . Fighting Hunger With Food_Stamps The food_stamp program is the government ' s single largest effort to fight hunger , providing people whose net_income is at or below the poverty level with coupons that can be used to purchase food in grocery_stores . About one in nine Americans -- and nearly half a_million households in Los Angeles County -- receive food_stamps . The program , which has bipartisan support , was first developed during the Depression . Food_stamps can be used to buy most food , but not alcohol or cigarettes . HOW IT WORKS * Applications : In Los Angeles County , the Department of Public Social_Services -- the local welfare agency -- handles applications ( although applicants do not have to be receiving welfare ) . * The coupons : In denominations of $ 1 , $ 5 and $ 10 . Recipients pick_up their booklets of coupons on or after an assigned date . * Outlets : Coupons can be used at any store certified by the USDA , which includes most grocery_stores in Los Angeles . Can purchase * Meat and vegetables * Bread and cereal * Soft drinks and candy can ' t purchase * Alcohol * Cigarettes * Detergents , toilet_paper , soap , cleaning supplies RECIPIENTS IN THE U.S. * 62 % of households include children ; of those , more_than two-thirds are single-parent homes * 52 % of the recipients are under age 18 By race White : 44.6 % Black : 35.4 % Latino : 12.3 % Asian , Native_American , and other : 7.7 % The numbers In L.A. County : 1.1 million In California : 3.1 million How long * Two-thirds of all recipients are in the program less than a year * However , more_than a third of those return to the program within 12 months The benefits $ 67.96-the average received per person per month 74 cents-the average received per person per meal ELIGIBILITY Anyone whose net_income is at or below the poverty level , including the elderly , the childless and the working poor .
