   <HEADLINE> SUSPECTED NAZI IN MASSACHUSETTS FACES CITIZENSHIP LOSS ; HOLOCAUST : RETIREE IS ACCUSED OF HIDING HIS ROLE IN THE MURDER OF JEWS AS HEAD OF A LITHUANIAN UNIT . HE CAME TO THE U.S. FROM GERMANY IN 1955 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Justice_Department Nazi-hunters moved Wednesday to strip U.S. citizenship from a Massachusetts man on the grounds that he hid his role in the mass_murder and persecution of Jews while heading a unit of the Nazi-sponsored Lithuanian Security Police during World_War_II . The Justice_Department action , portrayed as &quot; one of the most important Nazi cases brought anywhere in the world in recent history , &quot; illustrated the crucial value of records that had been under Soviet control and out of the reach of federal investigators for decades . Aleksandras Lileikis , 87 , who allegedly ran the Saugumas -- or security police -- in Vilnius Province of Lithuania , immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1955 under the Refugee Relief Act and became a naturalized citizen in 1976 . Eli M . Rosenbaum , acting director of the Justice_Department ' s office of special investigations , described Lileikis , a retired publishing_company employee , as &quot; a senior-level perpetrator of the Holocaust. &quot; Rosenbaum said that before the Lithuanian records became available , the Nazi-hunting unit had been looking_into whether Lileikis had lied_in denying his wartime role , but they had been &quot; stymied by the inability to get hard evidence. &quot; Opening of archives in Eastern and Central Europe in 1991 produced &quot; a veritable treasure of evidentiary riches , &quot; Rosenbaum said . &quot; We ' re able to make cases that would have been impossible to put together. &quot; The Lileikis case is a &quot; prime example of what access has made possible. &quot; At his Norwood , Mass. , home , Lileikis repeatedly told reporters &quot; no comment &quot; Wednesday , then slammed the door , the Associated Press reported . In a denaturalization complaint filed Wednesday in federal_court in Boston , the government claimed that from August , 1941 , until the German occupation of Lithuania ended in July , 1944 , Lileikis directed his security_force to seek_out and arrest Jews who violated Nazi anti-Jewish decrees . The more_than 100 Saugumas plainclothes officers under Lileikis ' command focused_on Jews who escaped or attempted to escape_from the barbed wire-enclosed ghettos in which they had been interned under &quot; catastrophically inhumane &quot; conditions , according to the complaint . The complaint cited several instances in 1941 when Lileikis turned_over Jews to the so-called Lithuanian &quot; special detachment , &quot; with full knowledge that the unit served as an execution squad . The allegations are based on captured Axis documents currently located in the Lithuanian State Archives . &quot; The best evidence against Mr. Lileikis is his own signature on one after another captured Nazi document , &quot; Rosenbaum said . The genocidal campaign launched by the Nazis in the summer of 1941 killed at least 55 # 000 of Vilnius ' 60 # 000 Jewish residents . During much of the 19th Century and continuing until the Nazi invasion , Vilnius and Warsaw were Europe ' s two preeminent centers of Jewish cultural , intellectual , religious and political life , the Justice_Department noted in its announcement of the action against Lileikis . Most of the victims were forcibly transported , often on foot , to the Paneriai woods about six miles outside of Vilnius , where large pits were used for mass executions , according to captured records preserved at the archives . There the Jews were shot to death , usually by special detachment members . The complaint cited Lileikis ' written &quot; decision &quot; on Gita Kaplan , a Jewish woman , and her 6-year-old daughter , Fruma , who were arrested on Dec . 1 , 1941 , for having fled and hidden outside the Jewish ghetto along with two non-Jewish Lithuanians who assisted them . After questioning them , Lileikis allegedly ordered that &quot; the Jew Gita Kaplan , who is being held_in my custody , born in 1896 , and her daughter Fruma , be turned_over as of Dec . 2 to the German Security Police_Chief &quot; with full knowledge that such Jews were &quot; almost invariably taken_to Paneriai for execution , &quot; the complaint said . German occupation records report the mother and daughter were executed on or immediately after Dec . 22 , 1941 . &quot; It is , tragically , too late for the victims of Paneriai , &quot; Rosenbaum said . &quot; But it is not too late to pursue some measure of justice on their behalf. &quot; Lileikis succeeded in entering the United States after failing twice in attempts dating to 1950 . He was admitted despite suspicions about his past . The U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps , for example , wrote that he was &quot; possibly connected with the shooting of Jews &quot; in Vilnius . When questioned before being granted a visa , however , he lied_about his wartime duties and activities , the complaint alleges . If Lileikis is stripped of citizenship , the Justice_Department then would likely seek his deportation to a country he would select if it would accept him . These are the maximum remedies available under U.S. law .</TEXT>
