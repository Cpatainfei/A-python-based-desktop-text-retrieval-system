   <HEADLINE> DOES RISE IN BREAST_CANCER CASES CONSTITUTE EPIDEMIC ? ; HEALTH : THE MEDIA HAVE IMPLICATED POLLUTION . BUT THE FACTS SUGGEST THAT EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND A LARGER POPULATION ARE BEHIND THE INCREASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The magazine cover is striking . A woman , clearly distraught , is naked to the waist -- except for what appear to be two gas masks hooked together to form a crude brassiere . &quot; Breast_cancer cover_up , &quot; says the cover line . &quot; Why scientists ignore vital evidence about toxins. &quot; Less graphic -- but no less scary -- many newspapers last fall published stories saying scientists thought pesticides in the nation ' s food supply &quot; may be contributing to an alarming surge in breast_cancer , &quot; as the Los Angeles Times story put it . There is a widespread perception in this country -- shaped in no small measure by just this sort of intense coverage -- that there is a new breast_cancer epidemic among women , much of it attributable to post-World War II environmental pollutants . But in April , the largest study on this issue to date found no evidence that breast_cancer is caused by pesticide residues . That doesn ' t mean that a cause-and-effect relationship won ' t be found in the future between breast_cancer and pesticides -- or some_other environmental pollutant -- but science hasn ' t established that link yet . Many women do have -- and die from -- breast_cancer . Studies suggest that there is a 1-in-9 lifetime risk of the disease . But the risk of breast_cancer rises dramatically as a woman ages , and it remains most likely to strike the very elderly . According to one study , a 60-year-old woman has one chance in 28 of developing breast_cancer by the time she is 70 . That may still warrant the tag of epidemic . It is clearly a tragedy , one calling_for massive research and human compassion . But it is neither as new nor as pervasive -- especially among younger_women -- as most media coverage suggests . The age-adjusted death rate from breast_cancer in this country has remained almost constant for 60 years . According to one study , a white_woman aged 50 to 94 has a 2.8 % chance of dying of breast_cancer ; that same woman has a 31 % chance of dying of heart_disease . Contrary to common perceptions , experts say , the primary reason there are more cases of breast_cancer among younger_women today is simple : There are more younger_women -- baby_boomers born between 1946 and 1964 . Overall the number of new cases every year in the United States has been rising dramatically in recent years . Most of that increase is attributable not to the pernicious effects of technology but to its beneficial effects -- specifically new diagnostic tools . &quot; There ' s been an enormous increase in screening , in early detection , an enormous increase in the number of mammographic machines around , &quot; says Malcolm Pike , chairman of the department of preventive_medicine at USC , who has long specialized in the epidemiology of breast_cancer . &quot; Not all . . . ( the increase ) is_due to that , but most of it &quot; is , Pike says . In other words , there appears to be more breast_cancer largely because we ' re able to diagnose ( and treat ) cases that in previous generations , we would not even have known about . Other factors are probably also involved in the increased incidence of breast_cancer , but they are much less significant and there is little agreement on what they are and on precisely what role they play . Nevertheless , the news media have devoted considerable space and time to the &quot; new &quot; epidemic . Breast_cancer is perceived as a &quot; hot &quot; disease , in part because -- after years of neglect and discrimination -- many editors have been sensitized to issues of concern to women by the presence of more women in the nation ' s newsrooms . Women now make_up 40 % of newsroom professionals and 30 % of executives and supervisors , the editors who decide what stories are assigned , covered and played prominently . Many women think breast_cancer , like other women ' s health issues , hasn ' t received enough attention in the mainstream media . On many health_problems , they may well be right . But last year , breast_cancer was mentioned 5 # 799 times in major newspaper and magazine stories , according to a search of the computerized Nexis database ; prostate cancer -- a disease that strikes only men , primarily older_men -- was mentioned 1 # 742 times . Breast_cancer killed about 46 # 000 women last year ; prostate cancer killed about 38 # 000 men . Thus , breast_cancer claimed 22 % more lives but received 233 % more media space . Not surprisingly , given the influence of the media on government decision-makers , that difference is reflected in government spending for research on the two diseases . The National Cancer Institute spent $ 213 million for breast_cancer research , $ 51 million for prostate cancer research , a difference ( 418 % ) that is much closer to the relative media coverage of the diseases than to the relative number of deaths . Since the age-adjusted death rate for prostate cancer has increased 30 % over the past 30 years , one could legitimately argue that it is prostate cancer , not breast_cancer , that is the &quot; new &quot; epidemic . But one would never know that from the media . Why not ? There are several reasons , not the least of them being that cultural forces have made breasts uniquely important to most women ' s self-image . There is a also -- perhaps inevitably -- a sociopolitical element to the battle against breast_cancer . Moreover , men are generally more reluctant than women to discuss their intimate body_parts , especially when sex or sexuality may be involved . The risk of impotence associated with treatment for prostate cancer makes most men especially squeamish . Recent inroads by women notwithstanding , the key decision-makers in the nation ' s media are still predominantly male . Thus , it ' s probably not surprising that one does not see many Page 1 , newsmagazine cover or top-of-the-evening-news stories on the prostate cancer &quot; epidemic. &quot; Disparity in Spending and Coverage Government spending on breast_cancer research -- an opposed to prostate cancer research -- more closely reflects media coverage than actual death rates from the two diseases . 03 # 37 , 14 # 13 Breast Prostate Deaths ( 1993 deaths ) 46 # 000 38 # 000 Media Coverage * 5 # 799 1 # 742 Research Spending $ 213 million $ 51 million ( By National Center Center in 1993 ) * Mentions in major newspapers and magazines in 1993</TEXT>
