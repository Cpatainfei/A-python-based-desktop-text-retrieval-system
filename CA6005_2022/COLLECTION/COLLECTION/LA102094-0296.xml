   <HEADLINE> KARCHER DEALT FINANCIAL SETBACK FROM LOAN RULING ; COURTS : FOUNDER OF CARL ' S JR . MUST PAY BANK $ 600 # 000 THAT HE GUARANTEED . BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS ARE POSSIBLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hamburger mogul Carl N . Karcher could soon be forced to seek bankruptcy protection from creditors after a legal setback Wednesday on a lawsuit involving the Karcher family trust and a former business partner . The suit was filed_in Los Angeles Superior_Court by National_Bank of Long_Beach regarding a $ 600 # 000 real_estate loan that Karcher guaranteed in connection with a troubled 1991 real_estate development in San Bernardino County . Judge Eric E . Younger on Wednesday granted the bank ' s motion to summarily force Karcher to pay_back the loan amount , said Gail B . Greenberg , an attorney whose firm represented the bank . Karcher was unavailable for comment on Wednesday , but his personal attorney said the decision could push Karcher , 78 , toward a bankruptcy filing . &quot; If we can ' t get this judgment stayed , Mr. Karcher is going_to have to seriously consider the option of Chapter 11 &quot; bankruptcy proceedings , said Andrew Puzder . &quot; But Mr. Karcher remains adamant that he will not have to file bankruptcy. &quot; The lawyer said that Karcher would ask the State Court of Appeal_to reverse Younger ' s decision . The unfavorable legal decision was the latest in a series of recent developments for the fast-food legend who in October , 1993 , lost a bitter boardroom fight and was forced_out as chairman of the company he founded more_than half a century ago . On Monday , CKE Restaurants announced that Karcher , now the company ' s chairman emeritus , would return to his cherished role as television pitchman for the Carl ' s Jr . hamburger chain . CKE Restaurants also said it would return the chain ' s marketing focus to quality food rather than competing on lower price -- a strategy Karcher long has endorsed . The next day , Donald E . Doyle , CKE Restaurants president and chief_executive_officer , said he was resigning to become chief operating officer of Hardee ' s Food Systems Inc. , a larger national fast-food chain with headquarters in Raleigh , N.C. Karcher and Doyle had been at_odds over the chain ' s direction . Karcher ' s finances remain shaky despite his highly publicized debt restructuring last year , when a group led by businessman William P . Foley II , the current chairman and chief_executive of CKE Restaurant , assumed $ 30 million of Karcher ' s personal debt in exchange for about 30 % of CKE Restaurants ' outstanding shares . Karcher and his family trust still hold about 1.63 million , or 9 % of the company ' s outstanding shares . Karcher also has been seeking negotiated settlements with other creditors , including National_Bank of Long_Beach . Failure to reach agreement with any one of those creditors &quot; would be major enough to force Mr. Karcher to consider options that he doesn ' t want to consider , &quot; Puzder said . Wednesday ' s court hearing involves a business_deal Karcher had with Maurice Monnig , 52 , a longtime family friend and business associate . The two men were involved in a series of troubled real_estate deals in the Inland Empire through a now-failed company called Monnig Development Inc. In the Los Angeles Superior_Court suit , National_Bank of Long_Beach contended that Karcher was ultimately responsible to repay the $ 600 # 000 development loan because he guaranteed it through his family trust . But Karcher unsuccessfully argued that his obligation was limited because Monnig and National_Bank of Long_Beach had failed to fully disclose the actual terms of the loan transaction .</TEXT>
