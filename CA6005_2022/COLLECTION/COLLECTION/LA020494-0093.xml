   <HEADLINE> UKRAINE LAWMAKERS OK INITIAL DISMANTLING OF NUCLEAR ARSENAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Parliament gave tacit approval Thursday for this country to begin scrapping 200 of its more_than 1 # 500 nuclear_warheads as part of a deal struck last month in Moscow . But lawmakers refused to declare Ukraine a non-nuclear state , as the United States , Russia and their own president have demanded . Further , the resolution on nuclear arms , passed_by 260 of the 296 Ukrainian lawmakers Thursday , was so vaguely crafted and hinged_on such legal technicalities that many deputies could not say what its effect will be . &quot; I have no idea what we voted for , &quot; complained legislator Ihor Dercacz . A top government official said President Leonid Kravchuk will interpret the measure as a green_light to begin transferring the first 200 weapons to Russia in return for fuel for Ukrainian nuclear_power plants . &quot; We are going_ahead &quot; with disarmament , the official said . &quot; I can ' t see anything that can get_in the way now. &quot; During President Clinton ' s visit to Moscow in January , Clinton , Kravchuk and Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin signed an agreement committing Ukraine to giving_up its nuclear_weapons in seven years in exchange for American economic aid , security guarantees and nuclear fuel . But the conservative Parliament has , so far , proven ambivalent about whether giving_up the world ' s third-largest nuclear arsenal will leave Ukraine defenseless against possible Russian aggression . Last November , Parliament approved the START I disarmament treaty in principle but said it applied to fewer than half of the 176 nuclear-tipped strategic missiles on Ukrainian soil . Lawmakers then added tough conditions that made their approval meaningless . Kravchuk and his government told Parliament on Thursday that the deal struck in Moscow satisfies most of those conditions -- and that Ukraine will become a pariah nation if it refuses to sign . &quot; To be left by oneself in the international community , even if you think you are right , is a losing game , &quot; Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko said . In the first sign that Parliament agrees , the preamble of the measure passed Thursday says the three nations &quot; will adhere &quot; to the deal , which &quot; makes_it possible to satisfy the conditions &quot; that Parliament set when it ratified START I . The preamble , however , is not legally binding . Parliament also refused to approve the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , a move that could irritate the West . Lawmakers fear that if they renounce all nuclear_weapons , they will then forfeit the right to demand compensation for warheads they hand_over . &quot; Ukraine should approve the non-proliferation treaty only if the United States and Russia explicitly recognize its rights , &quot; said Yuri I . Kostenko , a key lawmaker . Kravchuk hopes to get a less ambiguous mandate to disarm from the new Parliament to be elected in March . Meanwhile , he wants to keep the volatile nuclear issue from dominating the spring election campaign . Already , Communists accuse him of selling_out to the United States , while nationalists charge him with appeasing Russia . Parliament may be coming_around , but Kravchuk ' s allies say he will still have to &quot; run between the raindrops &quot; to make the disarmament deal stick .</TEXT>
