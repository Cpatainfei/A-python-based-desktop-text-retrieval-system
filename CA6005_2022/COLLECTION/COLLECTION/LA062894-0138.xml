   <HEADLINE> COUNTY COALITION DRAFTS ALTERNATIVE TO EPA SMOG PLAN ; POLLUTION : STRATEGY WOULD IMPOSE FEES ON MOTORISTS WHO DRIVE THE MOST AND PURCHASE CLEANER-RUNNING CARS FOR LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Ventura County coalition of government and business_leaders on Monday released its version of a plan to clean_up Ventura County ' s smoggy air , a plan they say will be effective without devastating the local economy . The draft plan , released by the Council on Economic Vitality and the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. , carries fewer economic and social impacts than a federally designed program , coalition members say . But they said it would reduce as much smog or more . The coalition ' s alternative plan calls_for a heavier burden on the average driver , emphasizing the need to reduce vehicle emissions by imposing higher car registration or other fees for those who drive the most . The plan would establish a fund to purchase cleaner-running cars for low-income residents to eliminate older , higher-emitting cars from the road . Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy Mikels acknowledged that stricter regulation of cars is &quot; politically touchy. &quot; But cutting_down on car emissions , she said , is &quot; the most effective and most provable because we know what cars do. &quot; Vehicles account_for half of the county ' s air_pollution . The plan also supports the right of motorists to choose to drive higher-polluting cars , but they would be charged an annual fee for the privilege of polluting more . &quot; This allows individual freedom by requiring accountability for that freedom , &quot; said Robert E . Paulger , a co-chairman of the economic vitality council and spokesman for Procter &amp; Gamble in Oxnard . The plan also calls_for further testing before restrictions are placed on pesticides , which are targeted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to cut_down on smog-producing chemicals . The coalition this week will begin sending_out letters soliciting endorsements from all areas of the community . &quot; We are hoping to get wide community support for these proposals , &quot; said Marc L . Charney , president of the county ' s economic development association . &quot; And if we do , we hope that will help the EPA to accept them &quot; as a replacement for the federal plan , Charney said . John Ungvarski , environmental scientist with the EPA , said the coalition ' s alternative plan must be reviewed for its technical merit . &quot; But we are open_to other options , as we ' ve said all along , &quot; Ungvarski said . &quot; The main idea is that it gets equivalent reductions . So if there is a better and cheaper way to do that , we want to see it. &quot; * The federal_government considers Ventura County to have a &quot; severe &quot; air-quality problem , based on ozone , the principal component of smog . After Ventura County failed to devise a way to clean_up the air to meet health standards , the EPA issued its plan in February . The agency gave the county one year to come_up with a better alternative or the federal plan would take_effect . A public hearing on the federal plan is scheduled July 20 . The county ' s Air_Pollution Control District is also working_on a plan , but the draft of that document does not go_far enough to meet required reductions in pollution by 2005 . The federal plan , which includes far-ranging restrictions that affect business , agriculture and industry , has drawn wide criticism . Paulger of Procter &amp; Gamble called the federal plan &quot; awesome and overwhelming . . . . People do not realize what is going_to hit them in February , 1995 , &quot; he said . Rex Laird , executive_director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau , called the federal plan &quot; Draconian &quot; and said it would devastate the agricultural economy . The coalition said its alternative plan would delay a federal proposal to restrict the use of some pesticides because they contain smog-causing ingredients . In addition , the oil that many growers use to suffocate pests in place of more toxic pesticides would be restricted as well . But Laird and others who worked_on the coalition plan said that more tests are needed before pesticides should be restricted . Another federal measure that would potentially affect agriculture would restrict the number of stops a large truck could make in the area . The measure was intended to promote the use of smaller , less-polluting vehicles within the area . But the trucks often make several stops to pick_up different commodities before heading out of state . The coalition proposes instead that tougher emission restrictions be placed on the trucks themselves , rather than limiting their stops . The coalition also strongly opposes the federal proposal to require large companies , like Procter &amp; Gamble , to reduce pollutants emitted into the air by more_than 4 % a year for five years beginning in 2001 . The reductions are based on emission levels in 1990 . But the coalition wants businesses to get credit for any reduction in pollutants made since then . The federal plan does not make such allowances . The coalition also wants companies to get credit for reducing emissions by converting their company cars to clean fuel . The federal plan requires reductions from each source , the manufacturing_plants themselves as well as the fleets , and does not allow the credits to be interchangeable . Bill Mount , deputy director of the county ' s Air_Pollution Control District , said the coalition ' s proposed alternative plan has many &quot; good ideas. &quot; &quot; But it still needs more work before it can be accepted by the EPA , &quot; he said . In order for any strategy to be acceptable to the federal_government , it must be adopted as a regulation by the county supervisors so it can be enforced by law . * Furthermore , he said , some of the coalition ' s ideas , such_as imposing higher fees on motorists , would require new state law and need a source of funding . Mount worked with the Council on Economic Vitality to develop some of the alternative proposals . And he commended the group for its efforts . He also stressed that the work must continue beyond February , 1995 , when the EPA is scheduled to adopt its own plan . &quot; Many of the toughest measures won ' t be implemented until 2000 or 2001 , so there is still time to propose alternatives even after the federal plan is adopted , &quot; he said . The EPA was ordered to prepare the federal plan after the U.S. Supreme Court ended a five-year local battle . When the EPA approved Ventura County ' s 1982 Air Quality Management Plan that failed to show that the county would reach health standards , the Citizens to Preserve the Ojai sued the EPA . A 1988 settlement produced a court_order for the EPA to devise a plan to clean_up the county ' s smog . But after the federal Clean Air Act was revised in 1990 , the EPA claimed that the court_order was moot . The courts have ruled differently , instructing the agency to make_sure Ventura County ' s air meets federal health standards within a decade . FYI The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will hold a public hearing on its proposed new air-pollution control plan on July 20 in the lower plaza assembly room , Ventura County Government Center , 800 S . Victoria Ave. , Ventura . The three sessions of the meeting begin at 10 a.m. , 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. The public is invited to speak on a first-come , first-served basis for up_to five minutes . Speakers are asked to bring written_copies of their comments for the hearing_officer .</TEXT>
