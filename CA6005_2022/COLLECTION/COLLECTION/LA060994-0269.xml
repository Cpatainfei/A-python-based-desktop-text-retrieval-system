   <HEADLINE> EXPERT SEES 90 % CHANCE OF BIG BAY AREA QUAKE BY 2020</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The chance of a major earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area by 2020 has climbed to near certain , according to a scientist who warns that new faults were found after the devastating 1989 Loma Prieta quake . &quot; A 90 % likelihood is probably not unreasonable , &quot; David Schwartz , a seismologist for the U.S. Geological Survey , told a conference on earthquake hazards . Four years ago the agency forecast a 67 % chance of a killer quake by 2020 . But since the October , 1989 , quake , researchers have found new faults or suspected faults , including two in the southern half of San Francisco Bay that run under or close to San Francisco International Airport , Candlestick Park and the San Mateo Bridge . The Oct . 17 , 1989 , earthquake had a magnitude of 7.0 , killed 63 people and caused more_than $ 6 billion in damage . &quot; Significant new information has been obtained on the behavior and location of faults in the region , &quot; Schwartz told a San Francisco conference on seismic hazards this week . Growing evidence indicates that some Bay Area faults are potentially deadlier than anyone guessed four years ago . Researchers also found that some faults are slipping faster than originally suspected . The researchers used sonar-like devices on boats to map hidden faults beneath the bay and detonated explosives to map faults under hills and valleys . Other tools included instruments that measured the millimeter-by-millimeter creep of faults .</TEXT>
