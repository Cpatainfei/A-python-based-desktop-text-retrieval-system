   <HEADLINE> IN DEVELOPMENT : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; DIGITAL BACK-SEAT DRIVER WILL TALK YOU THERE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Auto navigation systems that display maps and directions have been showing_up in high-priced cars for several years . Aside from cost , the main drawback of these digital maps is that they require drivers to take their eyes off the road to continually glance at the map . But AudioNav , developed by Burbank-based Amerigon Inc. and scheduled for release later this year , allows you to literally tell the system where you want to go and receive voice directions on how to get there . AudioNav , about the size of a VHS videotape , connects to a car ' s compact_disc player and carries_on its dialogue with the driver using a microphone on the visor and the car ' s stereo speakers . The dialogue , map and programs are recorded on CDs . The driver spells street names or the names of landmarks related to his current location and ultimate destination . Using voice-recognition software , AudioNav identifies the place_names on a map and plots the fastest route . It then reads back directions . Car audio_system manufacturers Eclipse / Fujitsu Ten and Clarion plan to offer the AudioNav systems , which are expected to retail for $ 500 to $ 600 . * Virtual Science Center : Despite its name , the Weizmann Institute of Science ' s new BioMOO biology center has nothing to do with genetically engineered cows . MOO stands_for Multiple-user dimension , Object Oriented and was coined to describe a multiple-user computer_game . But scientists who visit BioMOO aren ' t playing games . They are participating in the first major effort to use a virtual environment for day-to-day science and science communications established by the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot , Israel . When you log into BioMOO , which can be accessed via the Internet , you can type &quot; who &quot; to find_out who else is_on the premises and where . Want to find a fellow biologist working_on glycosphingolipids ? Leave a note on the bulletin_board . To share the results of a research project , invite others to visit your lab . To discuss a key scientific paper , post a date , time and place and see who shows_up at your seminar . BioMOO has more_than 700 registered members . * Foiling Aphids : It might one day be a common sight for motorists along Interstate 5 to see painted silver farmland stretching into the distance . In a study to find new methods of preventing aphid attacks on crops , University of California entomologists have found that reflection works where insecticides don ' t . For plants that are highly susceptible to aphid-carried viruses that stunt growth , the discovery could lead to the first effective deterrent to aphids . It seems that when an aphid is flying along looking_for a landing spot , it cues off the reflection coming from plant surfaces . If an aphid sees a reflection of the sky , say in silver paint or a strip of aluminum_foil , it won ' t land . Foil is an effective solution for back-yard gardeners . But it would be prohibitively expensive for commercial growers , and researchers are doing a three-year study of the effectiveness of spraying water-based silver paint on planting beds . When the crop is finished , the paint can be plowed under with no harmful effects . * Making Star Light , Star Bright : The technology available to scan the heavens has advanced to such a degree that astronomy , astrophysics and cosmology are said to be in a golden_age of discovery . But advances in visual power are also bringing new technical challenges . One of the most formidable is the distortion caused by the Earth ' s atmosphere on the captured image . To correct distortions , astronomers are working with adaptive optics to restore light to its original condition . Adaptive optics use a bright object above the distorting layers of atmosphere , along with sensors that detect and measure the distortion . By utilizing a small , computer-controlled corrective mirror , the image can be repeatedly adjusted to cancel_out atmospheric blurring . The corrected imaging not only provides greater detail , it also enables telescopes to detect faint objects by compressing the light . To produce a bright source near the object under study , one proposal is to create an artificial &quot; star &quot; made with lasers . Scientists at Hawaii ' s Keck Observatory say the technology may be ready by late 1997 . KATHLEEN WIEGNER</TEXT>
