   <HEADLINE> CULTURE ; MUMMIES ; * THE PRIZED REMAINS OF EGYPTIAN PHARAOHS WILL RETURN TO PUBLIC DISPLAY IN CAIRO , AIDED BY THE GETTY INSTITUTE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years they have slumbered in silent twilight , stretched_out in splendid repose in a storeroom of the Egyptian Museum . Here in this cluttered mausoleum , the same sun that once gave life to Egypt ' s pharaohs peeks each morning through small , dusty windows near the ceiling and creeps noiselessly across their grinning teeth and shrunken eyes . Egypt has always welcomed outsiders to the painted tombs of its pharaohs and the magnificent temples erected to ancient gods . But for years the royal mummies have been hidden from public view -- shielded by the conviction , dating_from the heyday of the Islamic revolution in Iran , that it would be unseemly to display bodies of dead kings . But political realities change , and so , it seems , does the fate of these 3 # 500-year-old relics . It started in 1980 , when former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat criticized Iran for displaying on television the bodies of American servicemen killed during an abortive hostage-rescue mission near Tehran . Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini responded angrily : What was Egypt doing displaying the bodies of its pharaohs to tourists ? Sadat swiftly banished the mummies to the basement . Now , both Sadat and Khomeini are dead . And the royal mummies are once again going_on public display -- thanks not only to new politics , but to new technology that will allow their ancient corpses to be protected from the modern-day hazards that lay outside their quiet tombs . &quot; You can see all_the objects in the pictures , you can go_to any square in the world and see the monuments created by these people -- the obelisks in New York , or Paris , or Istanbul or Rome . But this does not compare with looking face to face with the men that did these works -- that man who made all this empire ! &quot; said Nasry Iskander , who for 20 years has studied Egypt ' s mummies and who is now heading the project to reopen the mummy room at the Egyptian Museum next month . A total of 11 royal mummies will go_on display during the first phase , including Seti I , Ramesses II , Ramesses V , Tuthmosis IV and Queen Henttawi , the lovely , full-bosomed queen , only about 22 when she died , who was the wife of Pinejem I and the only mummy to be successfully restored . These are the rulers who presided over the greatest_years of Egyptian civilization and who created the cult of priests whose mysterious ceremonies , documented in hieroglyphic inscriptions and ancient papyri , preserved the bodies of the pharaohs and nobles in the belief that a new and eternal_life was to come_after the pharaoh ' s death barge sailed_through the stars of the night . For the new exhibit , the Egyptian Museum is gathering together all_the materials which accompanied this ancient rite of death : The fox-like hood worn by the priest during his prayers over the dead king , the ankhs ( small crosses with an arched oval joining the two arms ) held aloft to symbolize eternal_life and the wedge used to help breathe the spirit of life into the pharaoh ' s mouth . The museum even has the tools used in the mummification process , which wasn ' t fully understood and duplicated until the 1940s . On display will be the sloped embalming table , with a basin at one end used to collect bodily_fluids ; tiny pricks and knives , used to remove the viscera from a small hole in the lower abdomen and suck the brain out through the nose . The rest of the body was then packed in natural salts to extract the remaining fluids from the tissues , and it was then wrapped in resin-coated linen and draped in a garland of lotus flowers , some of which survive today . During the fabled expeditions of the 19th Century when most of Egypt ' s burial treasures were uncovered , the pharaohs themselves eluded a generation of French , Italian and British adventurers and were presumed_to have been long ago plundered . Then , in 1881 , Sir Gaston Maspero , a professor at the College de France , arrived in Egypt and opened an expedition to find_out for_sure . Maspero had returned briefly to Paris when his assistant , Emile Brugsch , prevailed upon local villagers to lead him along a long and winding path through the Deir al Bahari line of cliffs near the ancient city of Thebes ( now Luxor ) . They descended into a deep shaft , from which they entered a chamber filled with coffins . On their lids they read names that could only have been dreamed of before : Amosis , founder of the New Kingdom ; Tuthmosis I , II and III ; Ahmose Nefertari , patron of necropolis workers ; Ramesses I and II ; Seti I . All the major pharaohs dating_from as far back as the 17th Dynasty , about 1580 B.C. In all , there were 39 mummies , 19 of them royals . ( A second cache discovered in 1898 boosted the total of unearthed royals to 27. ) Brugsch was left with two fears : The first , that the remainder of the unbelievable treasure might be plundered if it were left to the villagers ; the second , in those politically unstable times , that the locals might be enraged at the sight of foreign archeologists hauling out such a precious Egyptian treasure . He decided in favor of preservation , and loaded the mummies onto a boat to sail up the Nile to the protection of the museum in Cairo . Brugsch recalled the scene in a magazine_article of the day unearthed by John Romer in his book , &quot; The Valley of the Kings : &quot; &quot; When we made our departure from Luxor , our late helpers squatted in groups upon the Theban side and silently watched us . The news had been sent_down in_advance of us . So , when we passed the towns , the people gathered at the quays and made most frantic demonstrations . . . the women were screaming and tearing their hair. &quot; * The royal mummies went_on display in 1953 in room 52 of the Egyptian Museum -- which quickly became its most famous room -- and remained there until Sadat ordered them secreted . &quot; I can ' t accept exposing the remains of Egypt ' s pharaohs in exhibitions for people to view . This is against the commandments of the three religions -- Islam , Christianity and Judaism , &quot; the late Egyptian leader said . But Iskander sees the mummies as examples of history and a lost civilization . &quot; These are magnificent leaders , and you feel you want to see them face to face , &quot; he said . &quot; On the other hand , these are not any more human_beings . They are now objects . And everybody must now look_at them as objects , not as bodies of human beings. &quot; More_than 130 years after the discovery of the first cache -- 3 # 000 years after it was last sealed -- technology now is playing an important role not only in preserving the mummies but in learning the secrets of their ancient identities . The display_cases , developed by the Los Angeles-based Getty Conservation Institute , provide a nearly oxygen-free environment that is as near the still air of the tomb as possible . &quot; In the past , very little research has been done on the conservation of organic materials , &quot; the Getty Institute said in an announcement of the showcase project . &quot; Through this project , part of our environmental research program , we are developing preventive conservation methods that can be used by museums throughout the world to protect their collections. &quot; In addition to protecting the mummies , technology is for the first time allowing scientists to extract ancient DNA samples -- a human version of &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; -- to establish royal genealogy trees and confirm the identities of mummies who often were reburied in the wrong casket . A study by the Australian Center for Egyptology in cooperation with Utah ' s Brigham Young University , completed last year , extracted the genetic building-block material from mummified bones , membranes and teeth and established a clear genetic relationship spanning three generations from 4 # 200-year-old mummies uncovered near Fayoum , Egypt . &quot; We can identify grandfather and grandmother and son and daughter , and by marriage , granddaughter and grandson , &quot; said Iskander , who participated in the study . The fact that scientists have been able to extract DNA from mummies and perform restoration work that has shown tissues to be virtually intact &quot; means that the process was perfect , &quot; Iskander said . &quot; What we want to present with this is that it was not just an act , it was a process , physical and spiritual . Each piece of it that remains means something . It shows it was a real civilization , a unique civilization. &quot;</TEXT>
