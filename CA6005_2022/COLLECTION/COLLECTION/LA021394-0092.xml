   <HEADLINE> TAKING THE PLUNGE ; AT GUADELOUPE , THE ' ISLAND WITH EVERYTHING , ' THE IDEA WAS TO STAY IN THE WATER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A huge cement cross loomed above us , a monument to shipwrecks offshore ; equally huge rocks loomed below . We loomed somewhere in the middle , clawing our way toward the top of Guadeloupe ' s easternmost cliff -- and straight into a bloodthirsty thornbush . that ' s when the same thought hit us both : This was our Caribbean beach vacation ? Oops . I was_on the first Caribbean_island of my life , and I ' d already learned and forgotten the great lesson of the Antilles within 24 hours of arriving . It was this : Stay in the water . Nothing bad can happen to you there . In the water , impossibly warm and clear , everything ' s wonderful and nothing matters . Float . Dive . Mmmmmmm . The proof had come immediately the day before . From the terrace of our miniature cottage , we ' d looked down on our hotel ' s tiny cove , where we intended to make our first Caribbean plunge together . It looked_like a deserted mud_flat . But after six hours in airplanes and airports , we had pledged to swim at the earliest opportunity . Now dusk was hitting the surf before we were . Down a dark path we hurried , gripping hotel towels and upholding an unspoken pact of I ' ll-keep-smiling-if-you-will . We pitched ourselves into the water , and everything changed . We surfaced in a new landscape , or at least in a new perspective . What lovely brown sand ( not mud after all ) , what a glorious view , what a cute little cove . And now we couldn ' t stop smiling . Everything was wonderful ; nothing mattered . We floated . We dived . Mmmmmmm . I know , I know . I would n ' t believe it , either . That Caribbean_Sea , sure , it ' s nice and warm and it turns a dozen pretty shades of blue and green and it ' s so buoyant that it gathers around you and lifts you like an invisible cushiony raft , yeah , yeah , but it doesn ' t have miracle healing powers , correct ? All I know is , we stayed in that modest little cove past nightfall , until the hotel turned its spotlight on the water and got a bright eyeful of my girlfriend and me swirling around together like those giddy tourist couples in TV commercials . When we climbed back_up the bluff , our wicker-furnished room , which had looked just maybe a tad shabby at first , now looked_like one of the all-time travel finds , our own private treehouse over the sea . Was it because of the water that even the farmland scenery of Guadeloupe ' s interior would seem so bewitching ? That sugar , chocolate , coffee , avocados , grapefruits and bananas would taste like nothing else in this world ? That for once in our lives we would tan and tan but never burn ? It was suddenly clear why Caribbean travelers often just select an island , step onto the nearest beach , and then barely budge until the plane leaves , attempting no tasks more demanding than deciding on a_level of sunscreen or the color of a cocktail . And yet , this great lesson didn ' t quite take . * After all , we ' d chosen Guadeloupe because it was the island with everything . &quot; The Caribbean in miniature , &quot; was one guidebook ' s enthusiastic phrase , picked_up during our long sojourns in bookstore travel sections . We were bound and determined to do_it all . This was the island with both a volcano and a casino ; with sands of nearly every color and a rain_forest with a permanent rainbow ; with some of the best snorkeling , some of the best French and Creole food , some of the best roads . It was the island so diverse it was actually two islands , one of flat coral and the other volcanic and mountainous , separated by the only channel in the world connecting the Caribbean_Sea and the Atlantic_Ocean . By the end of the week , we would circumnavigate both the mountainous Basse-Terre and flat Grande-Terre and visit a tiny offshore island to boot -- despite numerous wrong turns , several missed or misread road signs ( they ' re in French ) , and temptations to spend hours each day eating dishes that were a total mystery . Wherever we went , we looked_for the water , to wash all that traveling away . It wasn ' t just the 11 beaches we sampled ; we also bathed under two waterfalls , swam laps in a farm-country hot_springs , snorkeled among hundreds of fish at Jacques Cousteau ' s favorite reef , and even got wet in the rain -- in the rain_forest , of course . On our first day , we drove five minutes to Guadeloupe ' s largest white-sand beach , Plage Caravelle , which gave shape to our cottage ' s ocean view . Caravelle was bustling -- mostly with vendors walking up and down the shoreline with plates of pastries , calling &quot; Cho-cho-chocolat , &quot; the_French Caribbean equivalent of &quot; Peanuts hear. &quot; But the water was serene . This is Club Med ' s location , and the perfect line of palms is certainly the resort ' s doing , but in Guadeloupe all beaches are public up_to the high-tide mark . We pulled_up a palm and sat_down for the morning . * It was in the afternoon that we headed to the eastern tip of the island , Pointe des Chateaux , and lost our heads for a minute climbing_up to the giant cross . We did finally reach the top , a little scratched and a little shaky . We were rewarded with a view back over the entire upper island of Grande-Terre -- and the realization that we had totally missed the nice little path built for tourists . But a quick dip in the breakers below eased the pain and suffering . The next day , a beach all_the way to the west did the same thing . We had to take_care of business in the morning -- changing money in the busy , traffic-plagued center city , Pointe-a-Pitre , and changing our rental car because the first one had proved a little unreliable in the steering , brakes and ignition departments . Armed with new wheels , we sped onto the mountainous lower island of Basse-Terre -- and drove right through the national_park that was our destination , without realizing it . ( Those darn little French signs again. ) Our consolation was the beach on the other side : La Grande Anse , a wild , empty stretch the color of raw sugar , with water that we stayed in_for an hour at a time . Adding_to the beach ' s mystique was a palm-shaded restaurant , Karacoli , with fiery stuffed crab and its own hidden entrance onto the sand . Day Three was our grand_tour of Grande-Terre , bracketing the island ' s northern point , named literally &quot; The Great View , &quot; with visits to three different beaches on the route . At one , Anse Laborde , the beach hosted a cow ; at the next , Anse de Souffleur , the beach had a cemetery . We reached that one at sunset , and walked through the memorials of black_and_white tile and fresh bouquets lit by a purple sky . We returned the next day to the park , by way of Basse-Terre ' s gorgeous rolling farmland and a hot_springs turned_into a spa . Once in the park , a short hike brought us to a waterfall where locals and tourists swam together , with the veterans showing the neophytes how to sit directly under the falls and dive through to the other side . It was the coldest water we had been in , and we didn ' t care . We dried off , sat_down with a picnic of baguettes and Camembert , and then jumped into the waterfall again . * After a day on the offshore island Terre-de-Haut , with fine coves of its own , we had our last marine adventures . First we took a glass-bottomed boat to Pigeon Island , whose coral_reef preserve , often featured by Jacques Cousteau , is now named after him . The place is a haven for divers , but mere snorkelers can swim amid entire schools of curious rainbow-colored fish just as easily -- even first-timers like me . It was , I imagine , like visiting outer space , only better because of the refreshing ocean . There was still the promise of one more waterfall , and the accomplishment of rounding the southern end of Basse-Terre -- the one coastline we hadn ' t traveled . The mountain roads revealed wonderful views and a choice of more beaches to sample , but the road up_to the falls called &quot; Chutes du Carbet &quot; proved to be another trip into new territory . A half-hour hike , well marked , brought us to the middle falls of a set of three . This one was 200 feet high and boiling ; nearby , we slipped into one of its steaming pools . We did skip a_few things . We missed the Rum Museum . We passed_over merchants hawking &quot; Your Name on a Grain of Rice. &quot; We spent only an hour in the casino and never explored the volcano . It would have been a very long drive and a very long hike . And there would have been nowhere to swim . GUIDEBOOK Going_to Guadeloupe Getting there : American Airlines flies round-trip from LAX to Guadeloupe , with a change of planes in San Juan , Puerto Rico . Lowest available fare is $ 767 . The island is part of France : You need a passport . Where to stay : The clear winner was our own selection , La Toubana in Ste-Anne ( from the U.S. , tel . 011-590-88-25-78 ) . Our cottage -- bedroom , bathroom and kitchenette -- was not fancy but was completely private , with a large terrace looking_out to sea . The grounds were beautiful , the staff cheery and helpful , the restaurant excellent and our cove -- where we never saw another soul -- one of our favorite parts of the trip . High-season price : $ 175 double , including breakfast . Other hotels : Hamak in St-Francois ( tel . 011-590-88-59-99 ) , named for the hammocks on each patio , is the priciest resort . The grounds are very pleasant and so are the hammocks , but the rooms are neither particularly private nor elegant for the money . Price : about $ 300 for a double , including breakfast . Hotel Arawak ( tel . 011-590-84- 24-24 ) , on the Gosier strip , seemed to have_the_best beach in that area and was tastefully designed for a high-rise . A more affordable alternative at about $ 215 for a double , including breakfast . Le Relais du Moulin ( tel . 011- 590-88-13-78 ) near St-Francois was probably the best bargain we saw . It ' s not on the water , but the hotel beaches aren ' t the best ones anyway . This one has individual cabins with views and a fine restaurant . Price : about $ 100 for a double , incuding breakfast . Where to eat : It ' s difficult to eat lunch for under $ 20 or dinner for under $ 30 per person unless you picnic . Here are some non-hotel restaurants worth the money : Le Rocher du Malendure , overlooking Pigeon Island , won for best setting and best cold_fish . Restaurant Karacoli , Grand Anse beach , has terrific Creole food . Le Relais Caraibe , Gosier , serves Creole food and lots of charm . L ' Affamilar , Gosier , was a bargain serving pizzas and grills .</TEXT>
