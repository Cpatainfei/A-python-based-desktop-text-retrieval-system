   <HEADLINE> POLITICS LEAVES LAWMAKERS IN JAPAN OUT OF POLICY LOOP ; ASIA : CRITICS SAY THE NEED FOR NATIONAL CHANGE MEANS BUREAUCRATS MUST STEP ASIDE . BUT THAT MAY NOT BE EASY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You think Masahisa Aoki had time to wrestle arrogant bureaucrats and dream_up grand policy visions during his 26 years as a Liberal Democratic politician in Japan ? Give him a break . Aoki was busy juggling visits to 90 bereaved families in three days , 17 weddings in one day and 124 New Year ' s parties in one season -- typical tasks for a Japanese politician . In a society that values concrete displays of personal concern over abstract policy , politicians ignore rituals at their peril . Aoki once lost a major supporter because he did not know a voter ' s father had died and he failed to send funeral money and a condolence telegram . &quot; People say you can earn votes by making new schools or bridges , but that ' s an old story , &quot; said Aoki , who represented Tokyo ' s neighboring prefecture of Saitama until losing a reelection bid last year . &quot; Funerals are the most important way to earn votes. &quot; U.S.-Japan trade frictions ? Aoki was more consumed by rumors last year that his political rivals were handing_out rice balls stuffed with $ 100 bills . Japan ' s global leadership role ? Let bureaucrats drone_on about that . Aoki has more colorful tales to tell about the shifty character who slithered into his office one day and tried to sell 30 # 000 votes for $ 300 # 000 . Here in Japan ' s political trenches , it ' s no contest : The grunt work of getting votes is far more pressing than crafting national policies . That , however , is precisely the problem , a growing number of critics say . As a rapidly changing world buffets Japan , raising fears that decades of prosperity may begin to decline , politicians must head_off a looming crisis with wide-ranging reforms , they assert . But , as Aoki ' s experience illustrates , that may_not be so easy . Compared with Japan ' s elite and experienced bureaucracy , politicians are not particularly expected -- or equipped -- to provide policy leadership . Those who do possess expert knowledge are said to use it more to benefit special_interests . Indeed , such legislators , who are almost exclusively Liberal Democrats , are tagged with the withering title zoku giin -- literally , tribal lawmakers , who rule clans of special_interests that compete to carve_up the public purse . Ever since the Liberal Democratic Party , or LDP , came_back to power in June in a coalition with the Socialists and the New Party Harbinger , the tribes are said to have run amok . The LDP ' s powerful agricultural tribe , for instance , recently won a whopping bailout of $ 60 billion over six years to compensate farmers for the pain of Japan ' s decision to open its rice market . The prospect of national elections under a new redistricting plan also has created tumult in Japanese politics . Consumed with electoral survival , most politicians have little mind for dreaming_up new national directions , leaving Japan in the bureaucrats ' hands . &quot; In this uncertain political situation , if the bureaucratic apparatus goes_bad , Japan ' s economic and social_systems will stop functioning , &quot; warned Takashi Imai , Nippon Steel president . &quot; It is_better not to criticize bureaucrats so much. &quot; Yet critics such_as Karel van Wolferen , author of a piercing study of who governs Japan , argue that this nation has little choice but to turn_to its elected leaders . Unless Japan rewrites its bureaucratic blueprint of relentless economic expansion , it risks alienating the world and cheating its own people of the best possible future , he says . Bureaucrats have helped Japan amass great national wealth . But the strategy to produce and sell ever more goods abroad while suppressing the Japanese consumer appetite at_home has also led to huge trade surpluses , a soaring yen and skimpy public_services . Japan must share more of its national wealth by opening markets further and must shoulder more of the world ' s problems , Van Wolferen and others argue . Only political leadership , they say , can shake the status_quo preventing such policies . &quot; Without political direction , you won ' t have significant changes and Japan will go_on forever doing what it is doing , &quot; Van Wolferen says . &quot; Some people think that is wonderful and Japan will become the strongest industrial power on Earth . But many people , myself included , think many things could go_wrong . . . . In the long_run , it will undermine Japanese security by alienating the United States. &quot; But paradoxically , Japan ' s political culture tends to suppress what analysts say the nation most needs today : strong , visionary leaders . Former Prime_Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone , for instance , blazed a trail by trying to transform the weak premier ' s post into a launch_pad for presidential-style leadership . Hailed as Japan ' s last truly effective prime_minister , Nakasone beefed_up defense spending , privatized railway , tobacco and telephone monopolies and presided over a peak in U.S.-Japan relations . International Trade and Industry Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto , a rising star in the LDP , and Ichiro Ozawa , who masterminded the LDP ' s ouster from power last year and helped form the New Frontier Party , are also regarded_as leaders with intelligence , political experience and policy knowledge . Although such strong leaders push the nation ahead , they are unpopular in a political culture that values consensus , says Tomoaki Iwai , a Tokiwa University political_science professor . They may draw public support -- Nakasone and the Ozawa-backed former coalition government of Morihiro Hosokawa enjoyed the highest popularity ratings in recent history . But in Japan ' s political world , Iwai says , they end_up making too many enemies , limiting their grip on power . Japan ' s history has also suppressed the emergence of statesmanlike leaders , analysts say . Politicians enjoyed a brief heyday of genuine power just after World_War_II , when the Allied Occupation reforms broke the back of the bureaucracy and put power in the hands of the people ' s elected representatives , said political analyst Minoru Morita . But the outbreak of the Korean_War , along with China ' s Communist regime , made Asia a top Cold_War concern for the United States . U.S. officials pressured Japan to follow the American lead , effectively neutering Japanese policy-making power and instead encouraging economic development led by bureaucrats , Morita said . Left with a reduced role to play , Japanese politicians focused_on doling out public works pork and other parochial interests , analysts say . &quot; The Korean_War and Cold_War in Asia stopped Japan ' s democratic reforms . . . and led to today ' s system of a parliamentary Cabinet in name only , with bureaucrats holding actual power , &quot; Morita said . To restore the balance , he said , would take &quot; 50 to 100 &quot; years . Others say changing the status_quo will take changes in government structure and even more sweeping shifts in the mentality of the people . Take , for instance , Fukushima prefecture , a picturesque resort area of hot_springs and mountain_peaks in northern Japan . There , as in other areas of Japan , voters value elected officials blessed with three political assets : jiban , kaban and kanban ( local connections , money and a family_name ) . Hiroyuki Arai has none of these advantages -- which is why his election to Parliament ' s lower house in the summer on his second try was considered extraordinary . At 36 , the energetic Liberal Democrat says he represents the silent mass of salaried workers who , like himself , lack family wealth or an illustrious lineage . But a visit to his district found many of the old attitudes remain deeply embedded ; personal ties still often outweigh policies in moving voters . What does Kenya Yabe , one of Arai ' s main supporters , want from politicians ? &quot; Someone who will stand_up to the United States , &quot; he growls . &quot; We ' re made fools of. &quot; But ask if Arai ' s U.S.-Japan policy attracted his support and the medical doctor blinks blankly . &quot; No . He went_to high_school with my son , and I thought it was pitiful that he lost in his first try , &quot; Yabe said . On the strength of that personal tie -- and the urging of his wife -- Yabe activated his network of 3 # 500 doctors , who in turn urged their thousands of patients to vote for Arai . Fukushima business_executives describe what they want from politicians in two words -- &quot; a pipe &quot; -- one that will run from Tokyo to their local towns and will be wide enough to funnel back a piece of the nation ' s public works . Recently , for instance , one executive said he asked a politician to introduce him to a bureaucrat in_order to prod a contractor to give his firm a piece of a public works contract for waste disposal . In a society where introductions are still required for entree into closed groups , the businessman said &quot; politicians who know how to get this work are best for us &quot; -- and his firm has prepared more_than $ 200 # 000 to hand_out to those willing to oblige . To dodge the donor limits of $ 10 # 000 per candidate in the new political reform law , he said , they plan to funnel the money through several different organizations . The need for introductions , mediators and fixers is pervasive in Japanese society -- and politicians , for better or worse , end_up filling it . That is one reason why a web of local connections -- along with the family_name and money that enhance them -- has been so important for successful politicians . Indeed , fully half of the current LDP legislators are sons or daughters of politicians . Despite occasional cries of nepotism and criticism that Parliament is losing its political diversity , inherited connections and a family_name offer an overwhelming advantage . So does money . &quot; People are lustful creatures , and , in reality , politics is activated by money , &quot; said Aoki , the former LDP legislator . He said voters often expect everything from cash to free lunches to gift coupons for beer or gas . Politicians must constantly shell_out funeral condolence money , wedding_gifts and party fees at a minimum of $ 50 a pop . And to secure a post in the political_party , huge sums are passed_around . Aoki said he was once approached by three different candidates for the LDP party presidency and offered $ 20 # 000 by each of them for his vote . Politicians need so_much cash on_hand that many instruct their tailors to sew inner pockets into their clothing -- &quot; passport size &quot; and capable of carrying $ 60 # 000 in bills worth $ 100 each , said Aoki , who has written a book about his experiences . He added that it is virtually impossible to run a successful campaign without breaking election laws -- though he declined , in an interview , to say whether he was guilty of doing so . As a result of such political demands , many legislators are consumed not with brilliant policy vision but with the sheer work of raising cash . One time-tested way has been to join a party faction and pledge loyalty to the leader , who will in turn support followers with money and political posts . The late Kakuei Tanaka , Japan ' s dynamic former premier sullied by a bribery scandal in the mid-1970s involving Lockheed Corp. , is said to have invented the system . Another way is to join a political tribe and milk its related industry for contributions . The construction and transportation tribes are the most_desirable because of the enormous sums said to flow between those industries and their political benefactors . Not all tribal leaders , of course , are so craven . Sadanori Yamanaka , for instance , is the highly respected chief of the LDP financial tribe . A gruff man with graying sideburns , he is said to have mastered his field so thoroughly that , unlike most legislators , he can answer committee questions on any aspect of fiscal_policy without relying_on written materials from bureaucrats . He has also demonstrated considerable political courage . In 1989 , he played a key role as head of the LDP ' s tax council in pushing the 3 % consumption levy -- and paid the price for it by suffering electoral defeat that year . But Yamanaka , who was subsequently reelected , says that fewer than five of his fellow legislators in the 511-seat lower house have mastery to rival bureaucrats in a given policy area . And more often than not , political tribes use their knowledge to benefit narrow interests rather than the greater national good , critics say . The recent rice bailout was &quot; pork_barrel politics run amok , &quot; a Japan Economic Institute analysis said . It estimated that only $ 2.3 billion of the $ 60 billion allotted will go_to make Japanese rice farmers more competitive , the presumed policy rationale . &quot; Unless we can clarify the policy , &quot; fretted Tomomitsu Iwakura , the LDP ' s top agricultural staff specialist , &quot; we will invite further public distrust. &quot; Such realities prompt many opinion leaders here to question whether the nation ' s elected officials can forge a new direction . &quot; With respect_to neutrality and fairness in implementing crucial policies , politicians can ' t be a good match for bureaucrats , &quot; says Kojiro Shiraishi , a Yomiuri Shimbun editorial writer . Those politicians with a genuine interest in policy get few resources . Each national legislator , regardless of seniority , long received just two staff_members , although the number was increased this year to three . The annual public salary and office budget amounts to $ 320 # 000 , which Aoki said was not even enough to pay_for regular mailings to his 1 million constituents . In the United States , members of the House of Representatives have $ 557 # 000 each to hire as_many as 22 staff_members for offices in Washington and in their home districts . American legislators also have aides who work for them on their House committees . Further , House members receive at least an additional $ 122 # 500 a year to pay_for travel_to and from their districts and for rent while they are in Washington . Official mailings to constituents are free . And while congressional aides in the United States are typically young , with little political experience , about the only breeding ground for political policy specialists in Japan is the LDP . The party ' s policy research council employs 30 senior staff_members . It is organized into policy committees corresponding to each government ministry -- a structure that encourages specialization but has also produced the notorious political tribes . Koichi Kato , chief of the LDP policy research council , has been outspoken in urging legislators to take greater political control . The three-party coalition has an ironclad rule not to divulge information on policy debate until there is clear agreement , preventing bureaucrats from trying to divide and conquer . But ultimately , legislators must vote themselves a bigger budget and staff to create their own , independent policies , analysts say . Some politicians , such_as Ozawa , argue that Japan also should vastly increase the number of political appointees sent to direct the bureaucracy , as in the American system . While the President may appoint more_than 3 # 000 people , Japan ' s prime_minister is empowered to select fewer than 30 . That plan , however , raises protests from ministry officials . &quot; To have large_numbers of politicians working in the ministries may damage the objectivity of judgment and continuation of foreign_policy , &quot; said Kunihiko Saito , the vice minister of foreign affairs . Some say the younger generation is producing politicians better equipped to battle the bureaucrats . Yasuhisa Shiozaki , for instance , is as pedigreed as the most elite public official : Tokyo University , Harvard graduate_school , Bank_of_Japan . His intellectual confidence allows him to dress_down bureaucrats when others might not dare ; he is less reliant_on them for information , thanks to an independent network of banking and financial contacts . He succeeded his father in politics but entered of_his_own volition last July as an LDP lower house member -- in part , he says , to help raise Japan ' s standard_of_living to levels he enjoyed as a high_school exchange student in Marin County in 1967 . Although he attends weddings and performs other expected constituent services , his passion is policy debate -- from tax reform to welfare . &quot; Japanese politicians have to become more capable and intelligent . . . , &quot; Shiozaki says . &quot; But things are changing . Younger politicians are more interested in policy-making than staying in the district and going_to funerals. &quot; In Fukushima , Arai is trying to offer a new political style , involving voters in choices about their future . He returns to his district every weekend , working crowds and appealing for help in tackling big issues . Using a blackboard and colorful props , he explains such tedious topics as the Uruguay Round trade talks in terms the sunbaked farmers and their reticent wives can understand . His campaign seems to be paying_off . &quot; No one has ever explained these things to us in such a concrete way , &quot; beamed 60-year-old farmer Murakosu Hatsura recently after one such talk . But whether Japan ' s elected officials can make the leap to genuine policy leadership is still a question among those who know the country well . &quot; Japan has no history of politicians taking_charge , &quot; argues Chalmers Johnson , president of the Japan Policy Research Institute and author of the classic study on the role of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in engineering the nation ' s economic miracle . &quot; The best hope is to redirect the bureaucrats into a new national role. &quot; With no easy solution in_sight , some analysts say that only crisis or foreign pressure will move Japan to produce the leadership needed to make critical policy_changes . It was the Gulf War , for instance , that pushed Japan to break a political taboo and dispatch peacekeepers to aid U.N. efforts in Cambodia and other hot spots . &quot; Where there is no fire , the Japanese won ' t go and put it out , &quot; said Gerald Curtis , a Columbia University political_science professor . Times staff writer Joel Havemann in Washington and Megumi Shimizu and Chiaki Kitada of The Times ' Tokyo Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
