   <HEADLINE> DOW ' S PLUNGE TRIGGERED BY RATE FEARS ; WALL_STREET : ' CIRCUIT_BREAKERS ' KICK IN TO HELP SLOW THE FALL . COLLAPSE OF THE TCI / BELL ATLANTIC MERGER ALSO A FACTOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Investor fears fed by a surge in long-term interest_rates sent stock prices plummeting Thursday . The collapse of a multibillion-dollar merger and weakness in_stocks abroad added_to the gloom on Wall_Street , where the Dow Jones industrial average dropped enough in the final half-hour of trading to trip a New York Stock_Exchange &quot; circuit_breaker &quot; aimed at coping_with extreme conditions and preserving investor confidence . The blue_chip indicator lost 51.78 , closing at 3 # 839.90. Broader market measures also posted steep declines . The NYSE composite index fell 3.38 to 257.75 and the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 index dropped 6.43 to 464.26. At the same time , selling waves washed over smaller stocks as well . The Nasdaq Stock_Market composite index shed 9.67 to 779.44. Losers swamped gainers on the NYSE by about 4 to 1 on heavy Big Board volume totaling 342.94 million shares , up from 309.91 million Wednesday . Among the disconcerting factors for the stock_market was the announcement late Wednesday that Bell Atlantic ' s planned acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. had been terminated . The news was a blow for cable and communications companies in particular because their stocks had been bid up in recent months due_to takeover speculation as investors bet that the industries would consolidate . At the same time , a bearish sentiment rampant in the bond market overshadowed a decent showing at the Treasury ' s five-year note auction , and the closely watched 30-year Treasury_bond ended the day down more_than a full_point , driving_up its yield to 6.73 % from 6.65 % on Wednesday . The long bond ' s price , which moves_in the opposite direction , slumped 1 1 / 16 points , or $ 10.63 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . Traders began bailing_out of bonds from the opening in response to a government report of unexpectedly robust economic activity . The Commerce_Department reported that orders to U.S. factories for durable goods jumped a surprising 3.7 % in January . Many economists expected a 1 % increase . Demonstrating the bond market ' s bearishness , the Treasury auction of $ 11 billion in five-year notes met decent demand but failed to quell an afternoon selling spree . Yields on the five-year notes rose to their highest level in more_than a year . The high yield was 5.61 % , up from 5.10 % at the last auction Jan . 26 . It was the highest rate since five-year notes sold for 5.66 % on Jan . 27 , 1993 . The bid-to-cover ratio , a measure of auction demand comparing bids offered to those accepted , was 2.85 to 1 . That was up from 2.69 to 1 in the previous 12 auctions of five-year notes . Meanwhile , investors who blamed the stock_market ' s slide mainly on the bond market ' s performance noted that attitudes have turned against stocks . &quot; There ' s real concern here about the rise in interest_rates . The fear now is that this rise in interest_rates will reduce the flow of money into mutual_funds . If it does , then the market has real problems , &quot; said Michael Metz , a vice_president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co . Metz said portfolio managers have been culling holdings to raise cash_in case of mutual_fund redemptions . Among the market highlights : * Cable_television stocks were hammered by the news of the canceled TCI / Bell Atlantic deal . TCI dropped 1 7 / 8 to 22 3 / 8 , Comcast lost 1 to 19 1 / 2 and CableVision Systems plunged 5 1 / 4 to 62 1 / 4 . * The shares of cable equipment makers , which are seen as having been set to benefit from the merger , also lost ground . General Instrument shrank 6 1 / 8 to 44 5 / 8 , DSC Communications fell 2 1 / 2 to 52 3 / 4 and Tellabs lost 1 to 51 3 / 4 . * Bell Atlantic , which had drifted lower in the weeks after the merger deal ' s announcement in October , ended_up 1 3 / 4 to 54 1 / 2 as analysts raised their rating on the company . * Novell rose 1 to 24 5 / 8 after the software company reported strong earnings . * Stac Electronics surged 2 1 / 8 to 6 1 / 2 . On Wednesday , a federal jury awarded Stac $ 120 million from Microsoft for patent infringement . Most foreign stock_markets suffered setbacks , except Tokyo ' s , with the 225-issue Nikkei average rising 423.65 points , or 1.84 % , to end the day at 19 # 765.48. In Frankfurt , London and Paris , stocks moved sharply lower amid worries about the implications of Russia ' s political uncertainty , speculation about rising British interest_rates and disappointment over a small rate cut by Bank of France . Mexico_City ' s Bolsa index rebounded from early losses to close_up rose 19.98 points at 2 # 592.33.
