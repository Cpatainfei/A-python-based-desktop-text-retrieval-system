   <HEADLINE> PICKENS MINDING HIS OWN BUSINESS ; CORPORATIONS : STILL NURSING HIS WOUNDS FROM FOILED OIL_COMPANY TAKEOVER_BIDS IN THE ' 80S , HE ' S BUSY TRYING TO LIVE DOWN RAIDER IMAGE AND REVIVE NATURAL_GAS FIRM HE DOES CONTROL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> T . Boone Pickens spent the 1980s in the headlines , aggressively pursuing oil_companies , earning millions of dollars from their stock , and angering some business circles . The Boone Pickens of the ' 90s has a much lower profile . Instead of trying to take_over someone else ' s company , he ' s trying to restore the financial health of_his_own , Mesa Inc. , after a losing gamble on natural_gas prices . He also has some regrets about the last decade . &quot; Ehh , the ' 80s , &quot; he said in a recent interview . &quot; I go_back and look_at that period , I wished it never happened . Because , you know , what you thought you were doing -- other people didn ' t agree with what you thought you were doing. &quot; Pickens unsuccessfully targeted several oil_companies for takeover in the 1980s . The most prominent were his 1984 bid for Gulf Corp. , followed by plays for Phillips Petroleum Co . and Unocal Corp . Critics , particularly oil_company executives , called Pickens a corporate raider . Unocal sued Mesa , charging Pickens ' company made an illegal profit from Unocal stock , and won $ 42.8 million in a settlement with Mesa this year . But Pickens spurns the &quot; raider &quot; label and insists his offers were sincere . At 66 , Pickens still works_out , stays busy with his eight children and 16 grandchildren , and is a powerful Republican fund-raiser and sought-after personality . But he says he ' s too old for his cherished dream of a run at the Texas governorship . Dropping his sometimes combative public persona , he admits there are things he would have liked to do differently . &quot; If I had it to do over again , which you never get that chance , I would never have made an offer for a company after we had become Gulf ' s largest stockholder , &quot; Pickens said . The last of Pickens ' big moves ended in 1991 . Pickens ' Boone Co . purchased 26 % of Japan ' s Koito Manufacturing Co . but was refused a seat on Koito ' s board during a two-year battle . Koito maintained Pickens was a front for a Japanese investor trying to shake down the firm , a charge Pickens denied . These days , Pickens buys shares of Mesa stock , now owning close to 7 % . He ' s trying to build demand for natural_gas and find premium markets for it , while decrying the nation ' s reliance on foreign oil . He served two terms as chairman of the Natural_Gas Vehicle Coalition and recently reached a deal with SuperShuttle to use Mesa ' s natural_gas for its van fleets at Los Angeles International and John Wayne airports . Pickens also hopes to further ease Mesa ' s $ 1.2-billion debt load . In the summer of 1993 , Mesa restructured $ 600 million in debt , deferring about $ 150 million in interest payments over two years . Mesa is expected to lose up_to $ 90 million in 1994 , its sixth straight year of losses . &quot; The debt , there ' s no doubt , it is the centerpiece of the problem , &quot; he said . &quot; We distributed $ 1.2 billion ( to shareholders ) over a period in 1986-90 , which really gutted our equity , believing that natural_gas prices would go_up and everything would be fine . Natural_gas prices went_down and things weren ' t fine , is about what happened. &quot; Mesa hopes to be back in the market next year , or as soon as prices rise and interest grows in natural_gas stocks , not with equity but perhaps with convertible debt or selling a royalty trust . Analysts see little to get excited about at Mesa these days . They say the company has good gas properties and quality reserves , but its long-term viability depends in large part on natural_gas prices . Bryan Dutt , oil and gas analyst at Howard , Weil , Labouisse , Friedrichs in New Orleans , called Mesa a &quot; wait-and-see-type story. &quot; &quot; There ' s not much they can do without restructuring their debt . They ' ve got_to sit and wait for higher natural_gas prices . Talk_about a natural_gas engine is fine for the year 2000-plus , but it ' s not going_to help them in the short term , &quot; Dutt said . Pickens has mellowed in recent years , said Wales Madden , an Amarillo attorney and businessman who has known Pickens for 50 years -- since high_school -- and served on the board of Mesa since its inception . &quot; He is more able to relax and enjoy the fruits of some of his labor , &quot; Madden said . &quot; I think that Boone has learned , as we all have as we reach this age , that not everyone ' s going_to agree with us and not everyone ' s going_to love us , and we relax and enjoy those things that are important to us , which are family and friends , &quot; he said . Pickens said he feels fortunate . &quot; The last thing I am is bitter , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ve had a great career as far as just the people and all_the things we ' ve accomplished . &quot; If you ' ve got_to make a lot of decisions , you ' re going to make some you ' re not going_to like when you go_back and reflect on them. &quot; The toughest , Pickens said , was his analysis on natural_gas prices . But no one could have predicted in the mid-1980s that prices would drop , he said . &quot; I did bet the farm . That was the mistake , is the bet was too big , &quot; he said . &quot; I thought that natural_gas was it. &quot;</TEXT>
