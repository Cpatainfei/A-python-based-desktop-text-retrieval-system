   <TEXT> JOURNEY TO KHIVA : A Writer ' s Search for Central Asia by Philip Glazebrook ( Kodansha International , $ 23 hardcover ) and CENTRAL ASIA : The Practical Handbook by Giles Whittell ( Cadogan Books / Globe Pequot Press , $ 15.95 paper ) . &quot; What child , &quot; asks British author Philip Glazebrook rhetorically , &quot; has not responded to the ring of ( the ) names , Bokhara , Khiva , Samarcand , and their images of cupolas and courts and shadows in the sand , images glinting with the scarlet thread of cruelty and spilt blood . . . ? &quot; Well , probably most of the kids in Los Angeles today for starters -- not more_than a dozen of whom are likely to know Samarcand ( or Samarkand , as it is more usually spelled ) from Salt_Lake_City . But never mind . For anyone who has heard of them , these cities -- all_of them in the newly independent Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan -- are fascinating , mysterious , places ; a domain ( or so we imagine ) of capricious khans , wily merchants , dashing nomads , colonial adventurers , beautiful sequestered princesses . Such characters pop_up in Glazebrook ' s book , in his many historical and literary references , as he visits and travels between the three aforementioned Uzbekistani cities plus a fourth , Tashkent . He deftly blends his colorful history with contemporary anecdote , though , and with observations both appreciative and ironic , and he writes in an accessible , evocative style -- so that we can easily picture him fending off a murderous attacker in a Moscow hotel_room or defending Mrs . Thatcher at an inn outside Bokhara or standing alone before the slender jade tombstone of Tamerlane in Khiva itself . Giles Whittell ' s extremely well-researched and enjoyably crafted Cadogan guide , which covers not just Uzbekistan but also Turkmenistan , Tajikistan , Kyrgystan , Kazakhstan and a bit of western China , establishes practical parameters for a Glazebrook-style jaunt . The history is sound , the fables and tales amusing , the details riveting . * ADVENTURES IN CHEAP EATING : HAWAII : The Comprehensive Guide to Righteous Deals &amp; Authentic Meals on Oahu by March Egerton ( Tsunami Press , $ 9.95 paper ) . I was going_to mention this book -- which offers short reviews of some 175 restaurants , bakeries , takeout stands , coffeehouses , etc . on the island of Oahu -- as a &quot; Quick Trip. &quot; Its subject is relatively minor in the greater scheme of things , after all . But it turned_out to be such pure delight to read -- full of color and unforced humor and good-natured commentary -- that I think it deserves slightly more space . March Egerton has obviously not just visited every place he writes_about ( by no means common practice in the restaurant-guide business , I ' m sorry to say ) , but has made an attempt to understand each one and find its strong_points . Of a dish of seaweed , bamboo_shoots and pickled plums served at the Japanese noodle house called Tentekomai , for instance , he notes , &quot; It ' s not for everyone , I grant you , but damn tasty if you ' re feeling open_to a little adventure. &quot; His frame_of_reference is also sometimes astonishingly wide . In reviewing the wonderfully named Masu ' s Massive Lunch Plate , for instance , he writes that , &quot; Common to all_the specials is enough meat to make ' The Jungle ' seem like a stroll in the garden. &quot; A typical repast here , he adds , might include &quot; Fried pork chop with tonkatsu sauce , charcoal-broiled top sirloin_steak , fried shrimp tempura , baked Spam , Melveen ' s famous Tita-style Vienna_sausage and tuna-potato salad. &quot; Aloha , heartburn . * Quick trips : A SENSE OF MISSION : Historic Churches of the Southwest , photography by David Wakely , text by Thomas A . Drain ( Chronicle Books , $ 18.95 paper , $ 35 hardcover ) . Twenty-nine churches in adobe , wood or stone , many of them little jewels , most of them from the 18th and 19th centuries , presented handsomely and respectfully in luminous photographs and clean , crisp prose . NEW ORLEANS by Bethany Ewald Bultman ( Compass American Guides / Fodor ' s , $ 16.95 paper ) . Music , food and Mardi Gras are ( not surprisingly ) among the principal themes of this affectionate portrait of New Orleans . Like all_the Compass guides , this one has plenty of bright photography , lots of local color and plenty of boxes and sidebars on various subjects . There ' s no great depth here , but a pretty good portrait of the city shines through .</TEXT>
