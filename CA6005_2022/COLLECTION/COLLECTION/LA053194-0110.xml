   <HEADLINE> ITALY MAY OFFER TAX_BREAKS FOR AUTO BUYERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Italy is likely to offer tax_breaks to buyers of new cars in an effort to reverse a 7 % slide in sales this year and jump-start the economy , a government spokesman said . Italy would follow France , Spain and Denmark , which have each increased sales 14 % or more during the first four months of this year with various incentives , while overall European sales rose 3 % . Car sales in France , Europe ' s fourth-largest car market , rose 14 % during the first four months of the year after the government offered buyers $ 890 if they traded_in a car at least 10 years old . Car_makers matched the offer , leading to a strong increase in small car sales after the combination of government and car_maker incentives lopped as much as 20 % off prices . Spain last month began a similar offer , and Denmark ' s tax_breaks to car buyers have helped sales rise 47 % during the first four months of the year . The Italian government is still evaluating various plans to increase sales , Finance Ministry spokesman Carlo Nocera said . Italian auto_maker Fiat , which sells 46 % of all cars in Italy and is the country ' s largest privately owned industrial company , is expected to be the biggest beneficiary of any measures . Fiat is Italy ' s major domestic car_maker , owning the Fiat , Alfa Romeo , Lancia , Masserati and Ferrari brands . Economists say the month-old government of Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi needs to encourage consumer spending to help the economy . Fiat ' s sales during the first_quarter rose 11 % , but much of that was because of exports . Volkswagen , Ford and General Motors ' Adam Opel division , the next biggest car sellers in Europe ' s second-largest car market after Germany , also may benefit from the incentives to consumers . News_reports said the government was looking_at abolishing taxes to encourage car sales . These include car registration taxes of several hundred dollars , depending_on the size of the car , a $ 35 annual tax on the driver ' s license , and a similar tax on car radios . The Finance Ministry ' s Nocera declined to comment on whether the government would duplicate France ' s incentive to trade_in old cars . One-fifth of Italy ' s 30 million cars are at least 10 years old .</TEXT>
