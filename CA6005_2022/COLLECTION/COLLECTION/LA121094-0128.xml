   <HEADLINE> LAGUNA NIGUEL RESIDENTS URGE CITY TO USE DIFFERENT ANIMAL SHELTER ; HEARING : GROUP CLAIMS COUNTY POUND IGNORES PETS . THEY WANT SHIFT TO NEW MISSION VIEJO FACILITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Saying that county workers ignore pets and pet owners in South County , a group of local animal lovers asked the City_Council on Tuesday to leave the county ' s animal control program and join the new Mission Viejo city-run animal shelter . Animal lovers accused the county agency of being slow to respond to injured and lost pets and of euthanizing unlicensed animals as soon as the mandatory three-day holding period is over . &quot; We care about our animals , &quot; resident Diane Argyle said . &quot; We are not happy at all with the services of the county . It is not acceptable to kill any healthy animal. &quot; But Judy Maitlen , the county ' s animal control director , said that the county shelter has a pro-humane policy and that her office has received no complaints about ongoing service problems from Laguna Niguel residents . &quot; If you want to have a shelter right across the freeway , that ' s your choice to make , &quot; Maitlen told the council . &quot; But please don ' t make your decision based on a perception that we kill animals after three days . We don ' t have a need to do that . Her comments drew angry shouts from animal lovers in the audience , who said that they prefer Mission Viejo ' s policy of keeping all healthy , unclaimed animals alive indefinitely by giving them to the Friends of Mission Viejo Animals . They also said that telephone_lines at the county shelter are constantly busy , forcing many people to give_up trying to find lost pets . The animal advocates also said the proximity of the $ 2.3-million Mission Viejo shelter would improve response_times . City_Manager Tim Casey estimated that joining the Mission Viejo shelter would cost the city about $ 20 # 000 to $ 30 # 000 more per year than the current county contract . In addition , the city would probably be required to pay $ 75 # 000 to $ 100 # 000 to expand the Mission Viejo shelter . The council is expected to make a decision at its Dec . 20 meeting .</TEXT>
