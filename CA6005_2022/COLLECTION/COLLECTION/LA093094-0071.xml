   <HEADLINE> REALLY BIG SHOW ; INTERRUPT YOUR SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING . A DRAMA IS ABOUT TO UNFOLD IN THE NIGHTTIME SKIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If the new fall TV season lineup has you down , October is definitely the time to look_up . October ' s planets will surprise San Fernando Valley residents with more dramatic scenes than many weekly television series and , at_the_same_time , help you learn how to identify these celestial_bodies during one of the few times of the year when they can be seen together . The best sky show is actually a miniseries airing just after sunset Thursday and next Friday , when the moon makes a guest appearance in an area of sky featuring three planets : Mercury , Venus and Jupiter . On Thursday night , the moon can be seen above Mercury , about level with Venus and below Jupiter . Next Friday , the moon is positioned above all three planets . These two nights present a rare opportunity to spot the elusive planet Mercury . To find Mercury , use a pair of binoculars ( 7 x 50 power ) or a six-inch-diameter or larger telescope , and find a viewing site with a clear , flat western horizon . Look_for Mercury before it sets shortly after sunset . Without a telescope , Mercury will look_like nothing more_than a faint star . If you fail to spot it , try again Oct . 31 , about 40 minutes before dawn , when it is easily visible near the bright star Spica . Because Mercury and Venus are between the sun and Earth , we are able to see them only near sunrise and sunset . As the closest planet to the sun , Mercury is also the swiftest , circling the sun every 88 days . Because of the gravitational tug of the sun , Mercury rotates on its axis only every 58 days . As a result , there are 1 1 / 2 Mercury days in every Mercury year . But although it is the closest planet to the sun , Mercury is not the hottest . That honor belongs_to Venus , easily spotted below the moon_on Thursday as the brightest object in the sky . With a thick blanket of carbon_dioxide making_up its atmosphere , Venus lets_in light but does not let it out , creating a greenhouse_effect that has , over billions of years , raised its temperature to a blistering 878 degrees Fahrenheit . Like Mercury , Venus and the other planets shine not because they are generating heat , but because of the sunlight reflected off their surfaces . With a small telescope , you can see Venus ' crescent phase as it begins its passage between the sun and Earth in mid-November . Follow Venus from the beginning of the month with a telescope to see how the crescent phase disappears as it descends into the glare of the sun . The next brightest object in the sky Thursday is the planet Jupiter , still showing the effects of the collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in July . The dark , Earth-sized impact zones on the planet ' s hydrogen cloud tops may still be visible with a small telescope , and may remain so for a year . Even though it is the largest planet in the solar_system , 11 times the diameter of the Earth , Jupiter will appear smaller in a telescope than Venus . Yet four of its 13 known moons , known as the Galilean_satellites , should be visible with only a pair of binoculars . If you prefer getting_up early to see morning shows , check_out Mars about 2 a.m. Oct . 17 and 18 , when the planet passes_through the Beehive Cluster in the constellation Cancer . A collection of a_few hundred stars 500 light_years away , the Beehive will appear like a sparkling backdrop of jewels through a pair of binoculars or a small telescope . Mars will blaze a brilliant red . Mars ' color stems from the iron-rich dust on its surface that has , in_essence , rusted . Mars is also home to Olympus Mons , the solar_system ' s largest volcano . Using a telescope in the coming months , observers may be lucky enough to observe Mars ' north polar cap begin to &quot; melt &quot; during that planet ' s spring season . But don ' t look_for any rivers or streams emanating from the cap -- the frozen surface there is carbon_dioxide , or dry_ice , which is actually evaporating into the atmosphere . But the greatest guest star of all this month is the planet Saturn , whose own appearance will change more during the next year than a character_actor ' s . Saturn is high in the southeast after dusk , appearing in the faint stars of Aquarius . Visible all this month and the rest of autumn , Saturn ' s rings are tilting in respect_to our plane of sight , a process that occurs every 15 years . By 1995 , Saturn ' s rings will appear edge-on , making them virtually disappear from our view on Earth . As a result , this fall is one of the last times this year that you will be able to catch Saturn ' s rings through a small telescope . Since the planets constantly change position and appearance as they revolve_around the sun during the year , the show never ends . So when your favorite television_show becomes a repeat in the spring , grab a star_chart from Sky and Telescope or Astronomy magazines and look_for the new season of planets on the celestial channel -- commercial free , of course .</TEXT>
