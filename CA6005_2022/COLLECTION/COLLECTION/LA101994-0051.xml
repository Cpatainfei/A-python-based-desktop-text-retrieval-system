   <HEADLINE> CLINTON OKS DEAL TO STOP N . KOREA ' S NUCLEAR PROGRAM ; ASIA : PACT WILL BE SIGNED FRIDAY . IT GIVES PYONGYANG ECONOMIC , POLITICAL REWARDS FOR COOPERATION ON WEAPONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton on Tuesday approved a deal reached by U.S. negotiators in Geneva to stop North_Korea ' s nuclear_weapons program , saying the agreement &quot; will make the United States , the Korean_peninsula and the world safer. &quot; Clearly delighted by what he considers a victory for his foreign_policy , the President appeared before television_cameras to hail the agreement as &quot; the first_step on_the_road to a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. &quot; He instructed Special Ambassador Robert L . Gallucci , the Administration ' s lead negotiator with North_Korea , to sign the accord Friday in Geneva . However , the White_House refused to release the text Tuesday , and Administration officials said that it will not be made public until after it is signed . Instead , Gallucci and other U.S. officials briefed reporters on what they said are its principal elements . The accord , concluded Monday in Geneva , gives North_Korea a series of economic and political benefits in exchange for promises to freeze and eventually dismantle its current nuclear facilities , which the CIA believes have been used to make the material for one to two nuclear_weapons . &quot; The North_Koreans do have an interest in a political and economic opening . They do have long-term energy needs . And we are addressing those needs , &quot; Gallucci told reporters at a White_House briefing . &quot; They are giving_up a nuclear program that posed an enormous risk to South_Korea , to Japan , to Northeast Asia and to the international non-proliferation regime. &quot; North_Korea will dismantle two large nuclear_reactors now under construction , which would have had the potential to make enough fuel for hundreds of nuclear_weapons . Operations of an existing , smaller reactor at Yongbyon will also be stopped , and it too will eventually be dismantled , U.S. officials said . About 8 # 000 radioactive fuel rods now sitting outside the Yongbyon reactor will be sealed , and U.S. officials said the North_Koreans have agreed to let those rods be shipped outside their country . That is an important new concession by Pyongyang , which previously had insisted that the rods , a potential source of fuel for nuclear_weapons , would have to be stored on North_Korean soil . But the rods do not have to be shipped out for eight or nine years . And Pyongyang has the same time frame to dismantle the nuclear_reactors . In return for its concessions , North_Korea will get two 1 # 000-megawatt light-water nuclear_reactors valued at $ 4 billion . South_Korea and Japan will supply most of the equipment and financing for those facilities . The light-water reactors employ technology that can be used for civilian nuclear_energy , but they produce plutonium that cannot be turned_into weapons-grade fuel as easily as that from North_Korea ' s current gas-graphite reactors . In addition , Administration officials said , the United States and its allies will supply North_Korea with more economic benefits , in the form of oil supplies to provide energy in the years before the light-water reactors are finished . U.S. officials said that North_Korea will get heavy oil , which cannot be used for tanks , planes or other military equipment . Beyond these economic benefits , the long-isolated North_Korean regime will gain its first dollop of political recognition from the West . The United States and North_Korea will open liaison offices in each other ' s capitals , the first_step toward the establishment of diplomatic relations . Finally , in the key compromise of the deal , North_Korea agreed to submit to special inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency of two sites believed to contain nuclear wastes . But the United States agreed that these inspections , which the agency had demanded last year , will not have to take_place for &quot; about five years , &quot; according to Gallucci . The special inspections of these waste dumps are important because they are expected to show how far North_Korea has progressed in its efforts to make nuclear_weapons . The agreement does not specify a five-year delay , but it says that the special inspections must take_place before North_Korea gets any significant amount of nuclear equipment for its light-water reactors -- a period expected to take about five years . Outside the Administration , a number of specialists on the proliferation of nuclear_weapons said they worry that the agreement represents nothing but promises that will not be carried_out . &quot; We ' re letting them off the economic and diplomatic hook , without getting anything more_than promises that have been broken_in the past , &quot; said Gary Milhollan of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control . &quot; If the North_Koreans are being let_out from under the present embargo and are being given oil to rescue their economy , we are losing the leverage over them that we now have , meaning economic leverage. &quot; &quot; I just hope we ' re not deluding ourselves , &quot; said David Albright , a physicist and nuclear expert who heads the Institute for Science and International Security . &quot; Do you believe that the North_Koreans want to put their bomb program behind them , or are they just buying_time ? You have to be suspicious of North Korea. &quot; Nevertheless , Clinton maintained that North_Korea ' s compliance with the accord will be carefully monitored by the international inspectors . &quot; It ( the agreement ) does not rely_on trust , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
