   <HEADLINE> WHITE_HOUSE STARTS FINAL BIG PUSH FOR GATT PACT ; TRADE : ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS AND CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS ARE NEARLY DONE NEGOTIATING COST ISSUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an effort almost lost in the roiling debate over health_care reform , the Clinton_Administration is beginning a final concerted push to win approval of U.S. participation in a massive global trade agreement , optimistic that it will be able to nail_down its second major political victory on the trade front -- and one that eluded the two previous Administrations . Senior White_House officials and congressional leaders are nearing completion of arduous , often contentious , negotiations over how to meet the trade plan ' s $ 12-billion price_tag . The opposition , though active and vocal , has been unable to coalesce into a political force that could pose a serious threat to passage of the legislation implementing participation in the agreement . The White_House ' s goal is to slip the 22 # 000-page trade pact into the legislative mill by the beginning of August and quickly push it through to final approval -- despite the more visible work_on health_care -- before the House and Senate begin their summer recesses in the middle of the month , a senior Administration official said Wednesday . That timetable has prompted criticism from Congress , where Administration allies are concerned that failure to meet the schedule will suggest that momentum favoring the agreement is slowing . * But whether Congress acts before it leaves for its August recess or after it returns , increasingly optimistic Administration and congressional sources predict that the plan -- whose goal is to cut tariffs by roughly one-third and liberalize trade rules to stimulate world commerce -- will pass each house with bipartisan support . After having spent two days this week in negotiations with congressional trade experts , a senior Administration official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said Wednesday , &quot; I am more cautiously optimistic than I was 48 hours ago. &quot; According to the Administration ' s estimate -- which is more conservative than some -- the trade plan would expand the U.S. economy by $ 100 billion in its first years and be an important first_step in raising U.S. exports to the $ 1-trillion range , more_than twice the current level , over the next 15 years . The pact , negotiated over seven years , would expand the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , which took_effect in 1947 , and replace it as the international trade rule-enforcing body with a new Geneva-based operation to be known as the World Trade Organization . That body would be given greater authority than its predecessor over the more_than 120 member nations . Opponents in the United States are concerned that bureaucrats in Switzerland would be in a position to overrule local , state and federal laws governing such sensitive matters as food safety , environmental protection and labor rights by decreeing that such laws and regulations serve protectionist purposes and therefore stifle free_trade . Among the other points raised by opponents and wary supporters : * Will the new rules mean that the United States and other countries would be restricted in efforts to protect home industries from foreign products dumped at below-production costs ? * Will key provisions in U.S. trade laws intended to pressure other nations into opening their markets to U.S. products be overruled because they could result in trade sanctions ? * Will the Administration succeed in keeping its authority to negotiate trade agreements on a &quot; fast-track &quot; basis ( this prohibits time-consuming and agreement-threatening amendments ) when the completed pact is sent to Congress for approval ? That would come_into play when the Administration seeks to expand the North_American Free_Trade Agreement to include Chile . Organized labor has recently intensified its opposition to the fast-track procedure , a leading congressional expert on trade issues said , and the trade agreement being advanced by Sen . Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) , chairman of the Senate Finance_Committee , omits it . * Finally , there is the sticky question of what participation in the trade plan will cost . There is little dispute over the Administration ' s assertion that the increased commerce the pact would bring would , in the end , produce more government_income -- as much as $ 3.90 for every $ 1 lost to lowered tariffs , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor says . But federal budget law requires that for every $ 1 lost in revenue , there must be a $ 1 cut_in spending or a $ 1 increase in taxes or other income . Under a plan outlined by Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , the Administration will recommend spending_cuts of $ 8 billion , including $ 1.6 billion in reduced agriculture subsidies .</TEXT>
