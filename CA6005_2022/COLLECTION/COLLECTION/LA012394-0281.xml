   <HEADLINE> BOTH SIDES ACT TO HELP JAPAN LEADER STAY ON ; ASIA : POLITICIANS SAY ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN_POLICY NEEDS can ' t WAIT . PRIME_MINISTER ' S LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE POLITICAL REFORMS VIEWED AS FUTILE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japanese leaders on both sides of the political fence moved Saturday to help Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa stay in office , even if he fails in an eleventh-hour bid to salvage his political reforms . &quot; Full efforts must be devoted to carrying_out measures to spur the economy , &quot; said Michio Watanabe , former foreign_minister and a major faction leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party . &quot; I don ' t think anyone will try to force the prime_minister to assume responsibility &quot; for the stunning defeat of Hosokawa ' s reform bills in the upper house of Parliament on Friday , Watanabe said . Yoshiro Mori , the Liberal Democrats ' secretary_general , also said that priority must be given to economic measures and foreign_policy issues . Hosokawa is scheduled to meet President Clinton in Washington on Feb . 11 . The opposition ' s expressions of support for Hosokawa came as leaders on both sides predicted the prime_minister ' s last-ditch attempt to come_up with a compromise package and enact it by next Saturday , when the current session of Parliament ends , will prove futile . Hosokawa was expected to ask that both the upper and lower houses establish a 20-member joint committee to hammer_out the compromise . Any revised bills would require the approval of two-thirds of the joint committee but only a simple majority of each house . The lower house passed Hosokawa ' s reform package last Nov . 18 , but on Friday , a rebellion by 21 of Hosokawa ' s coalition members -- 20 of them Socialists -- sent the bills to defeat by a vote of 130 to 118 in the upper house . In a debate broadcast today by NHK , the semi-governmental national TV network , Watanabe demanded that Hosokawa scrap his election reform plans and agree to enact only a bill designed to uproot corruption . Leaders of both the coalition and the opposition Liberal Democrats reportedly suggested that a &quot; consultation committee &quot; be established to continue debate on political reforms after the close of Parliament . Establishment of such a committee could sound the death_knell for reform , but it would hand Hosokawa a face-saving way_out of the pledge he made last August to &quot; assume responsibility &quot; if the bills were not enacted . Some commentators , however , said Hosokawa might resign -- without calling a general_election -- out of personal conviction to keep his promise . In that case , the lower house would choose a new prime_minister . With Japan ' s economy in deep recession , a sense of crisis has emerged among both politicians and business people who believe that the government must act immediately to spur growth . The budget_for the next fiscal_year , which usually is compiled by the end of December , still has not been drawn_up . And an announcement of a package of measures to spur economic_growth that had been planned this week was expected to be delayed by the last-minute efforts to win approval for political reform . Even if Hosokawa stays_on , the blow to his leadership may prove fatal . With proof in_hand that he cannot count_on the support of the Socialists , the largest group in his coalition of seven parties in the lower house and eight in the upper chamber , attempts to cut taxes to spur growth are likely to be more intractable . Socialists adamantly oppose any increase in a 3 % consumption tax as part of a deal to cut income_taxes , while the Finance Ministry insists on a trade-off . Japanese economists , as well as Clinton_Administration officials , regard an income_tax cut as essential to spur consumption , lift the economy and pull_in more imports . Japan ' s trade surplus with the United States last year was expected to amount to about $ 56 billion . Friday ' s defeat for Hosokawa , Japan ' s best hope for political change in decades , also called into question whether he could carry_out other pledges to reduce government intervention in the economy , disperse central government powers to local administrations and put the consumer -- instead of the producer -- at the core of policy . An agreement by Hosokawa to stay_on would ensure he could make his scheduled trip to Washington . But both sides admit yearlong talks to conclude a &quot; framework &quot; for U.S.-Japanese economic relations remain stalemated . Hosokawa and Clinton had been scheduled to sign the framework at their February meeting . The newspaper Yomiuri reported today that Foreign Ministry officials are studying what to do if the Clinton_Administration decides to postpone the meeting because of lack of hope for an agreement . Hosokawa is to meet today with Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , who is_on the final leg of a 12-day international tour . The prime_minister ' s proposed political reforms would have carried_out the biggest overhaul of Japanese politics since the post-World War II American occupation . The reforms would have scrapped electoral districts from which an average of four representatives are chosen , created new constituencies in which only one candidate is elected and established a system of proportional_representation in the lower house .</TEXT>
