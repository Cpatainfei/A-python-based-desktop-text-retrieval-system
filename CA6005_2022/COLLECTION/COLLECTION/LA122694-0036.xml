   <HEADLINE> WILDERNESS LOST ; URBAN ' PLINKERS ' TURN REMOTE CANYON INTO SHOOTING_RANGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Standing next to his mud-splattered pickup_truck , Stan Zarkowski took_aim with his Chinese-made MAC-90 and ripped_off six quick rounds . Small spits of dirt jumped around the target -- a diamond-shaped &quot; Divided Road &quot; sign propped against a stream bed . It was noon , and the 33-year-old maintenance worker from Thousand Oaks had been target shooting_for hours . An open Coors Light rested_on his tailgate near boxes of ammunition , a 9-millimeter Ruger pistol and a new Smith &amp; Wesson . 357-magnum revolver . By his estimate , $ 70 worth of spent shell casings littered the ground nearby . &quot; You come_up here and let your frustrations out , &quot; said Zarkowski , clad in a sweat shirt , dusty jeans and tennis_shoes . &quot; It keeps you in_line . It keeps you out of trouble. &quot; Of all_the remote spots in Ventura County ' s backcountry , Cherry Canyon has emerged as an unofficial , unregulated shooting_range for urban &quot; plinkers. &quot; Because of its immense popularity , the canyon also has become one of the most abused stretches of wilderness in the Los Padres National Forest . Broken glass sparkles on the hillsides . Bullet casings and shotgun_shells carpet the ground . One of the larger piles of trash contains a toaster , a toilet rim , a Twinkie display stand , clock_radio and dozens of beer_cans . At a clearing that was once an established campground , plinkers blasted a picnic table so often that U.S. Forest Service officials removed it last year . &quot; They come_out here with a gun and their mind-set all_the sudden changes to this Rambo-type attitude , &quot; said George Garcia , a wildlife biologist with the Ojai Ranger District . In recent years , the Forest Service has done little to discourage shooting at Cherry Canyon . Under a broad policy , guns are allowed throughout the national forest , except near campgrounds and other recreational areas . &quot; Everybody really turned_a_blind_eye to it , &quot; Garcia said . &quot; The attitude was : It ' s better to have it there than scattered throughout the whole district. &quot; But rangers are now taking a closer look_at the canyon and figuring_out ways to repair the environmental damage . Eventually , they may issue a plan to protect the canyon from further abuse . Ranger Linda Riddle said the Forest Service could decide to ban shooting in the canyon , though that decision will probably not be made within the next year . &quot; There is that possibility , &quot; she said . &quot; But I just don ' t know how it ' s going_to turn_out in the end . I don ' t have any preconceived ideas about it. &quot; Recognizing the controversy that would come_with any decision to ban or restrict shooting , the Forest Service is taking a cautious , inclusive approach . The first_step , Riddle said , is to study the impacts of shooting and off-road vehicles in Cherry Canyon and in the larger watershed that feeds into Sespe Creek . Specific funding has not been set_aside for such a study , but it has been cited as a priority project . The second step involves determining whether target shooting can be done safely in three-mile-long Cherry Canyon . To get an answer , rangers will study shooting locations in other mountainous areas , consult with gun clubs and meet with other members of the public . All of that will take time , Riddle said . Consequently , rangers are concentrating now on winning public cooperation to limit the damage to riparian and wildlife areas . &quot; If they don ' t act responsibly , we have to act responsibly for them , &quot; Garcia said . While litter and abandoned , rusting appliances are the most visible sign of the canyon ' s abuse , it is the dirt paths carved by motorcycles and four-wheel drive pickups that have prompted the Forest Service ' s plans to close the canyon before the winter storms soften the terrain . In past winters , the rain-swollen creek has proved a favorite spot for drivers of four-wheelers careening through the mud . Their tracks have turned the entrance to Cherry Creek Road into a wide , barren bowl devoid_of vegetation . And along the bed of the seasonal creek , clumps of reddish buckwheat , great basin sage , wild rose and willow bushes lay trampled or uprooted , leaving bare patches of land . The loss of vegetation , Garcia said , could lead to more soil runoff into the creek , choking the path of steelhead trout swimming upstream to spawn . &quot; It could be interrupting the reproduction of the species , &quot; he said . This month , Forest Service officials are installing a gate at the California 33 turnoff that they hope will end winter traffic to Cherry Canyon and minimize the hillside erosion and silt buildup in Sespe Creek . Rangers are also concerned about pollution from lead ammunition and toxic chemicals leaching into stream beds . Cans of paint , antifreeze and other chemicals are used as targets . Once plugged with holes , their contents seep into the ground . In July , a Forest Service employee spotted a sheen on a hillside just inside the canyon ' s entrance . A five-gallon bucket of motor_oil was found riddled with bullet_holes , triggering an $ 1 # 800 cleanup effort . Half a mile down Cherry Creek Road , the canyon walls narrow next to a stand of big cone Douglas firs . From there , the road winds uphill , and the evidence of shooting is more scattered . On a recent tour of the canyon , Garcia stopped his green Forest Service truck near a cluster of alder_trees beside the creek for which the canyon is named . &quot; Look_at that , &quot; Garcia said , pointing to bark on an alder_tree shredded by hundreds of shotgun pellets and larger lead slugs . &quot; When the bark starts falling_off , the trees are more susceptible to insects and disease. &quot; &quot; It ' s going_to live for a while , but it ' s eventually going_to die off. &quot; It has only been in the past decade that Cherry Canyon emerged as the county ' s proving ground for would-be sharpshooters . Until 1984 , shooting was permitted at the entrance to the Rose Valley Recreation Area , 10 miles south of Cherry Canyon . Cars would park along the paved road , with shooters blasting away at bottles and other targets . The legacy of that era is &quot; Sparkle Mountain , &quot; a low hillside embedded with so_much glass that it reflects sunlight like a mirror . Once that area was closed to guns , shooters moved several miles up Maricopa Highway to a wide , grassy clearing . The spot remained popular for several years until plinkers began taking_aim at a large California Department_of_Transportation storage shed to one side of the clearing . At the request of Caltrans , the Forest Service banned shooting there , pushing the activity farther up the highway until it reached the mouth of Cherry Canyon . And while the canyon is clearly the hub of target shooting , rangers occasionally find trash and other evidence of activity in smaller , nearby canyons . Forest Service personnel fear that if they try to restrict gun activity in one area , such_as Cherry Canyon , target shooters will simply move_up the highway or spread to neighboring canyons . There is one controlled range_in Ventura County ' s backcountry . A few miles inside Rose Valley , the Ojai Valley Gun Club features a series of targets at measured distances , regular tournaments and classes on shooting safety . Each dues-paying member is provided with a key to the locked gate , and the club is open_to the public for contests and once a month target_practice . &quot; We ' re shooting enthusiasts and we try to make_it as safe as possible , &quot; club president Jim Pendleton said . But many of those who flock to Cherry Canyon bristle_at the thought of paying money to shoot outdoors . And they say they prefer the freedom of Cherry Canyon , where there in no one to tell them what kind of weapons they can fire . Aware that the Forest Service considers Cherry Canyon a problem , the shooters said they fear that guns will someday be banned in the area . Many expressed frustration with the trash and said they do their part to keep it clean . Some have participated with other volunteers in organized cleanup days . &quot; Whatever we bring , we take_back , &quot; said John Schlossman , 26 , of Newbury Park , who works for the Los Angeles County Fire_Department . Still , he acknowledged it can be a losing battle . &quot; This stuff just keeps getting bullet-riddled and before you know , there ' s too_much to pick_up , &quot; he said . On a recent weekend , despite a chilling wind , about two_dozen people had staked out spots along the road that bisects the canyon . Few people described themselves as hunters . Instead , they said they were there for target_practice and and to sharpen their skills for self-protection . They fired an array of weapons ranging from small , palm-sized pistols to sawed-off 12-gauge shotguns and Russian AK-47s . Others , who considered themselves collectors , had brought World_War II-era guns and replicas of older weapons . &quot; It ' s a hobby , &quot; said Richard Brandt , 29 , a communications engineer from Thousand Oaks , who was firing a replica of a rifle from the 1880s . &quot; You like to come_up here and see if you can hit stuff. &quot; For some , outings to Cherry Canyon are family affairs . While the shooting is done almost exclusively by men , often they are accompanied by wives and children . After making a trip to the top of the canyon to see a dusting of snow , Todd Raymond and several friends stopped to test their skills at skeet_shooting . Raymond blasted away with a . 12-gauge shotgun , as his 4-year-old daughter , Ashley , and 6-year-old son , James , watched nearby . &quot; Daddy , can I shoot ? Can I shoot ? &quot; Ashley pleaded . &quot; No , honey , this one is too big for you , &quot; Raymond replied . A short distance away , another father and his son were firing two homemade canons filled with black gunpowder . The booms echoed off the sandstone below Pine Mountain ridge . Rick Azevedo , 46 , said his son Brian had asked to go_to Cherry Canyon for his birthday rather than hosting a party for his friends . The two had made the canons together during the past year . Azevedo then taught his son to load the canon with black powder , tamp it with a rod , insert a metal ball , light the fuse and quickly back_away . &quot; I ' m a single dad and I enjoy every minute of it , &quot; Azevedo said . &quot; This is just kind of a thing we do. &quot;</TEXT>
