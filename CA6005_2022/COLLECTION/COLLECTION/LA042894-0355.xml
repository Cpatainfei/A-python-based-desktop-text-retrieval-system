   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; SEA WORTHY ; A CREW OF SEASONED SAILORS -- SOME IN THEIR 70S -- FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS TO FRANCE ABOARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If the Lane Victory sails out of Los Angeles Harbor as scheduled this week , bound for England and the Normandy coast of France , it won ' t be the oldest large vessel ever to sail the high_seas . But it certainly will have one of the oldest crews ever to go_down to the sea in a ship . The captain is 77 ; the chief mate is 76 . The chief engineer is 72 . Of course , most of the other crew_members are much younger than that . Their average age is only 68 . Despite their age -- or maybe because of it -- the 53 Lane Victory crew_members are determined to take their restored World_War_II cargo_ship on the voyage to France for ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the D-day invasion of Normandy . For most of them , it ' s an 18 # 000-mile voyage back in time , back to the days when they were young sailors in the U.S. Merchant_Marine , hauling cargo through dangerous waters to far-flung battle fronts around the globe in World_War_II . For most of them , too , it will be the last great adventure of their long and often adventurous lives . &quot; Look_at all these old_boys , &quot; Lane Victory Capt . Bill Tilghman , 77 , a veteran of half a century at_sea , said as he waved a weather-beaten hand at the congregation of gray-haired men -- and a_few women -- who assembled on the ship last week for a pre-voyage crew meeting . &quot; Every one of these old sailors is at the twilight of his life . How often do you get a chance to do something really exciting at the end of your life ? Not too damn often . that ' s why it ' s worth fighting for to make this trip. &quot; And fight they did . They and other members of the U.S. Merchant_Marine Veterans of World_War_II , a national organization with about 4 # 000 members , fought to get the old Lane Victory out of mothballs , and they fought to fix it up and turn it into a sea-going museum and memorial . Then they fought to collect the prodigious amounts_of_money , fuel and food they needed to make the Normandy voyage . The Lane Victory and its crew -- most of whom are from Southern California -- plan to steam southeast to Panama , through the Panama_Canal and then across the Caribbean , passing between Cuba and Haiti and into the Atlantic . Depending_on how long it takes_to get there , near Bermuda the Lane Victory may rendezvous with two other ships -- the Maine , a training_ship from a maritime academy in Maine , and the Jeremiah O ' Brien , a World_War_II Liberty_ship based in San Francisco that also is going_to Normandy . ( The O ' Brien left San Francisco last week , but since its cruising speed is less than 10 knots , the faster Lane Victory could catch up. ) Alone or with the other ships , the Lane Victory will head east from Bermuda toward the coast of Africa , turning northward near the island of Madeira and sailing to Portsmouth , England , for a port visit before the Normandy ceremonies on June 6 . It ' s a 9 # 000-mile voyage one way , and at a cruising speed of about 15 knots , it will take almost a month to get_to Europe , and a month back , with some side trips in between . All told , the voyage is expected to last about four months . The trip will be arduous ; it won ' t be like a cruise on the Princess Lines . There are no shuffleboard courts on deck , no health spa , no floor_show at night . The crew cabins are at best Spartan . Like any other working ship ' s crew , the Lane Victory crew_members , all_of them volunteers , will stand bridge , deck and engine-room watches 24 hours a day . If they want to get from one deck to another they ' ll use ladders , not elevators . And although the Lane Victory is equipped with modern navigational and radio gear and is taking the so-called &quot; good_weather &quot; route across the Atlantic , any professional sailor can tell you that it ' s a tough ocean . There ' s always a chance the ship could hit rough seas . There will be a doctor on board , and all_of the crew_members had to get letters from their personal physicians saying they were able to make the trip . Still , a pitching , yawing , rolling ship on the high_seas , coupled with the inevitable problems of advancing years , could make the trip hazardous for some . At the pre-voyage crew meeting , Capt . Tilghman , a sometimes crusty old_salt who lives_in Fallbrook in San Diego County , didn ' t downplay the actuarial problem . &quot; Now , considering our maturity , &quot; the captain said , &quot; there ' s a good chance we might lose one or two of us before this thing is over . If somebody snaps the twig over there , he better decide right now if he wants us to ship him home or fill his pockets with scrap_iron and dump him over the side. &quot; But none of the Lane Victory crew_members seemed worried . &quot; I went_around the world in a ship just like this one during the war , &quot; said Ralph ( Barney ) Starr , 71 , a Corona minerals prospector now serving as a galley &quot; utility_man &quot; aboard the Lane Victory . &quot; It won ' t be any problem . Everybody ' s looking_forward to it. &quot; &quot; I suppose we ' re trying to recapture our youth , &quot; said Chief Mate Bill Skinner , 76 , a World_War_II Merchant_Marine veteran who lives_in Lakewood . &quot; But I don ' t think we ' re too old for this trip . Nobody ' s pooping out . In fact , my blood_pressure is down since I ' ve been involved with this ship. &quot; Doubters may shake their heads and say it ' ll be a miracle if the Lane Victory and its crew accomplish what they ' ve set_out to do . But as Joe Vernick , president of the national Merchant_Marine veterans group , puts it , &quot; This whole ship is a miracle. &quot; The Lane Victory ' s story began in 1945 at the California Shipbuilding Corporation ( CalShip ) yard on Terminal Island . One of 531 Victory ships built during the war , the Lane Victory was designed as a seagoing workhorse , an unglamorous but tough vessel able to haul cargo and troops wherever they needed to go . The Lane Victory is 455 feet long , with a 62-foot beam and five cargo holds ; powered by steam_turbines , like other Victory ships it is larger and faster than the Liberty_ships built earlier in the war . Construction of the Lane Victory began on April 5 , 1945 ; less than three months and about $ 3 million later , the completed ship was delivered to the American President Lines shipping company , which operated the ship for the War Shipping Administration . The Lane Victory , named after Lane College in Jackson , Tenn. , which had been founded by a former slave who became an Episcopal minister and educator , became part of the U.S. Merchant_Marine . A little-known and little-publicized part of the war effort , the Merchant_Marine was a government-contracted civilian organization that hauled about 85 % of all war-related cargo , everything from tanks to ammunition to oil . Being in the Merchant_Marine in World_War_II was dangerous work . Of the 225 # 000 who served , more_than 6 # 000 died when their ships were hit by bombs or torpedoes , a battle death rate higher than any of the U.S. armed_services except the U.S. Marines . Most Merchant_Marine ships were equipped with defensive deck- and anti-aircraft guns , manned by U.S. Navy &quot; armed guards &quot; assigned to the ship . In wartime , the Lane Victory carried a crew of about 55 Merchant_Marine seamen , plus about 20 Navy_men . World_War_II ended during the Lane Victory ' s first voyage carrying supplies to American troops in the Pacific . After the war , the ship was operated by American President Lines , carrying cargo around the world . In 1948 the ship was mothballed , but was recalled to service in the Korean_War . The Lane Victory helped evacuate thousands of U.S. troops from the port of Hungnam while under Chinese and North_Korean shelling and took them to relative safety farther south . In 1953 the Lane Victory went_back into mothballs , but in 1966 it was recalled yet again to haul war supplies to Vietnam . It was mothballed for the third time in 1973 , after a total of 31 voyages . Assigned to the National Defense Reserve Fleet near San Francisco , it was one of many old ships kept_on hand in case of another war . Unlike many of the ships in the reserve fleet , however , the Lane Victory was kept_in relatively good_shape as a &quot; show ship &quot; for the fleet . In 1988 , Merchant_Marine Veterans of World_War_II president Vernick and John O . Smith , vice_president of the organization , persuaded Congress to give the group the ship for use as a maritime museum and memorial . In 1989 the Lane Victory was towed from San Francisco to the Port of Los Angeles -- to the consternation of port authorities , who were reluctant to give the old ship valuable berthing space . After considerable political maneuvering by the veterans , the Lane Victory was finally given temporary space at Berth 53 in San Pedro . Hundreds of Merchant_Marine veterans and other volunteers spent hundreds of thousands of hours and almost $ 1 million fixing_up the old ship . In 1991 , the Lane Victory was named a National Historic Landmark . In addition to a museum commemorating the U.S. Merchant_Marine , the ship , which is open_to the public , also serves as headquarters for the Merchant_Marine veterans group . In 1992 , after passing rigorous Coast Guard inspections , the Lane Victory went_to sea again under its own power for the first time in almost two decades , taking about 700 passengers on a daylong cruise off Catalina Island . Since then it has made 10 such cruises . Meanwhile , the Merchant_Marine veterans started thinking_about Normandy , where thousands of American veterans will convene on June 6 to commemorate the day in 1944 when American , British , Canadian and other Allied troops staged the largest amphibious landing in history . The Allied landing on the shores of occupied France , coupled with advances by forces of the then-Soviet Union on Germany ' s eastern front , was the beginning of the end for Adolf Hitler and the Nazi German domination of Europe . &quot; We started talking_about this trip about a year and a half ago , &quot; said Vernick , 80 , a North Hollywood resident . &quot; We never had any doubt the ship could make the trip . This ship is in as good a shape as it was when it was built . The problem was raising the money. &quot; Taking a ship on an 18 # 000-mile , four-month voyage is an expensive proposition , especially when the ship burns a barrel of fuel -- 42 gallons -- per mile . Going_through the Panama_Canal costs $ 16 # 000 each way for a ship the Lane Victory ' s size ; food for the crew costs about $ 100 # 000 . All told , the group needed more_than $ 1 million in fuel , equipment , supplies and cash to make the Normandy trip . Shell , Arco , Exxon , Texaco and Mobil oil_companies donated some fuel and cash , and the Stouffer company donated some frozen_food . The Long_Beach Naval Shipyard donated about 2 # 000 tons of concrete ballast needed to stabilize the ship . The Port of Los Angeles contributed $ 16 # 000 for Panama_Canal transit fees . Members of the Merchant_Marine Veterans of World_War_II and countless other individuals and smaller companies donated money and services . But it wasn ' t enough . As late as last week the Merchant_Marine veterans weren ' t sure if they ' d be able to go . Then the Kenneth T . and Eileen L . Norris Foundation of Long_Beach , a philanthropic organization founded by an important World_War_II munitions manufacturer , heard about the Lane Victory ' s plight and stepped_in with a $ 250 # 000 donation . That put the veterans over the top . &quot; It took some luck and some guts , and a little bluffing , &quot; Smith , 83 , of Seal Beach said of raising the money . &quot; But we did it. &quot; Not everyone who has worked hard to make the Lane Victory ready could make the trip . There were more volunteers than there were spaces for them . &quot; The hard part is deciding who gets_to go , &quot; said Chief Engineer Peter Jacobelly , 72 , a Harbor City resident who spent 46 years at_sea as a merchant seaman before retiring 10 years ago . The ones chosen , he said , were &quot; the guys who worked here longest and hardest. &quot; Some of the Merchant_Marine veterans had health_problems that kept them from going . Vernick , for example , who still suffers ill effects from the beriberi he developed while interned by the Japanese in the Philippines in World_War_II , plans to fly to England and rendezvous with the ship for the D-day ceremonies . And not all_the spouses of the old sailors are eager to see them go . &quot; My wife is mad as a cat , &quot; says Capt . Tilghman , who retired as an oil_tanker captain just two years ago . &quot; But it ' s always been like that . Every time I come_home it ' s a honeymoon , and every time I go_back to sea it ' s almost a divorce . But I would n ' t miss this trip for anything. &quot; Some wives , on the other hand , won ' t have to stand on the dock and wave goodby . Five women who put_in many long hours helping fix_up the Lane Victory are making the voyage . &quot; I ' ve always bitched about the men having all_the fun , &quot; said Mary Stahl , 59 , of San Pedro , whose husband , Ron Stahl , 67 , participated in the D-day invasion as a young merchant seaman . &quot; Now it ' s my chance to have some too. &quot; &quot; I want to experience what my husband did , &quot; said Mary Anne Struyk , 68 , from Downey , whose 71-year-old husband John , a former Merchant_Marine sailor , also is making the voyage . &quot; Besides , we worked our fannies off to get_on this trip. &quot; Not everyone on the voyage is an old_hand , either . The youngest member of the crew is Jim Watson , 32 , a part-time hotel_clerk from Redondo Beach . Although he never served in the Merchant_Marine , he spent many hours helping to restore the Lane Victory , and subsequently got his seaman ' s papers . He is assigned as a utility_man in the galley . &quot; It ' s an honor that they ' re letting me go_along , &quot; Watson said . &quot; And I think this is one of the best crews you could have . I mean , look_at all_the years of experience they have -- and years , and years , and years . I really admire and respect these guys. &quot; So the men -- and women -- of the Lane Victory head to sea again , for what Vernick calls &quot; their last hurrah. &quot; In a pre-voyage interview , Tilghman probably summed_up the feelings of most of the Lane Victory crew_members when he quoted some lines from &quot; The Ship That Never Sailed , &quot; a poem he learned in high_school . &quot; I ' d rather feel the sting of strife , where storms are born and tempests roar / Than settle_down to an empty life , and rot in dry-dock on the shore. &quot; Lane Victory Built : In 1945 at California Shipbuilding Corp . on Terminal Island . Served : In World_War_II , Korean_War and Vietnam_War . Type : General cargo . Length : 455 feet . Beam : 62 feet . Power : Steam_turbine . Speed : 15 knots . Crew : 55 to 60 sailors .
