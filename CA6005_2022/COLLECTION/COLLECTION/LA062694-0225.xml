   <HEADLINE> HIGH-TECH REFERENCE_POINT ; FACILITY : SCIENCE LIBRARY THAT WILL OPEN TUESDAY AT UCI HOUSES BOOKS AND CUTTING-EDGE LEARNING EQUIPMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The largest medical and science library in California , featuring more_than 2 # 000 desks and chairs , up_to half a_million books and the latest in library technology , is opening this week at UC Irvine . The six-story high-tech Science Library -- between the School of Biological Sciences and the College of Medicine -- cost $ 33.5 million , all coming from state revenue and general obligation bonds , UCI spokesman Scott Nelson said . It can hold as_many as 500 # 000 texts , has about 2 # 200 reader stations and features a study center that will be open 24 hours during midterm and final_exams . The library will open_to the public at 8 a.m. Tuesday . Budget problems have hampered UCI and threatened to close some departments , but the library project went_ahead . The project , which began in 1987 , &quot; addresses a longtime need for additional library space at UCI and was_on the books before the budget_cuts of recent years , &quot; Nelson said . UCI political_science senior Mike Ross has seen the library evolve from a hole_in_the_ground to an earth-toned , high-tech learning center . &quot; I ' m super pleased , &quot; said Ross , the on-site building manager . &quot; I can ' t wait to move_in here. &quot; On a recent afternoon , Ross surveyed the library from floor to floor , dodging scurrying workers moving thick , dusty books back and forth on plywood dollies . Maroon-colored shelves will house the books , protected from outside light by translucent plastic walls . In areas of the library where clear glass windows rise from floor to ceiling , photocells detect light that might harm books and set_off mechanisms that lower blinds to shield books from the sun . &quot; It ' s pretty high-tech , &quot; Ross said . To show what he meant , Ross brushed by a steel water_fountain and moved his hand . Water arched and burbled from a valve . &quot; Motion detector , &quot; he said . At four kiosks in the library , visitors will be able to get maps of the library by touching a computer_screen , Ross said . Students will take classes and find pictures and articles on CD-ROMs -- compact_discs that hold vast amounts of data -- in the library ' s interactive learning center . Library employees will carry personalized cards that they must run_through security boxes before entering stairwells , Ross said , and graduate_students will get cards that they can use to access rooms in the building that other students may_not use . By installing such security measure , university officials hope to keep the collections of valuable books intact , he said . Balconies will be kept locked so that no one can throw books out windows and down to other people below . Builders have also included details that will help students keep_up with educational technology . More_than 450 computer outlets dotting walls throughout the library will allow students and other patrons to access databases with laptop_computers . When the outlets are activated in 1995 , students will be able to link their computers with Internet , a network of thousands of computer_systems from around the world . Students will also be able to retrieve articles and poems that are not copyrighted through computers , Ross said , as well as archive photographs such_as images from the Hubble Space Telescope . &quot; People can come_in , plug_in their computers and bring things right up_on their screen , &quot; he said . Students who copy texts from the database onto their computers can take the texts home without lugging stacks of photocopies or books . Workers are emptying the Physical_Sciences , Biological Sciences and Biomedical libraries of books and hauling them to the new library , Ross said . Those libraries will be turned_into office and class space by their departments , he said , but the Main Library will stay open . UCI is part of a nationwide movement among academic and public_libraries to upgrade equipment , officials at colleges and universities said . In Orange County , Cal State Fullerton broke ground in February for its nearly $ 30-million library expansion , including $ 4.6 million in CD-ROM equipment and other computer resources . Officials at Chapman University in Orange also are upgrading equipment and plan to have several academic journals available to students on computers by the next school_year . Fullerton and Newport Beach public_libraries are two of about 170 in the state that received grants to install computers that allow patrons to use Internet , Fullerton Public_Library director Al Melo said . &quot; The new technology is going_to come whether we want it or not , &quot; Melo said . &quot; If we don ' t ( upgrade ) now , two years from now , we ' ll be that much further behind. &quot; Largest Science Library in California UC Irvine ' s new Science Library will feature advanced computer access to information . Science and technology collections , now stored in four different places on campus , will be centralized at the library .
