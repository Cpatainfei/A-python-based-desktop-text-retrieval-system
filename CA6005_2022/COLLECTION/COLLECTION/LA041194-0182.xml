   <HEADLINE> THE HUMAN_RIGHTS PIPELINE ; CHARGES OF SLAVE LABOR IN MYANMAR LEAD TO BALLOT AT UNOCAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a proxy vote this month , Unocal Corp. ' s shareholders face a decision that may have a major impact on the debate over U.S. human_rights policy in Myanmar , where the military regime allegedly is using forced labor to build infrastructure projects possibly related to a Unocal gas pipeline . Company officials deny any connection between Unocal ' s activities in Myanmar ( formerly Burma ) and alleged human_rights violations . They have urged shareholders to reject a resolution calling_for a full report on the situation . But as proxy votes are being cast by mail in_advance of Unocal ' s April 25 annual shareholders ' meeting in Los Angeles , evidence is mounting that serious problems have occurred in the vicinity of the planned natural-gas pipeline . Burmese refugees reportedly have poured into Thailand , complaining that government troops uprooted villages and conscripted men for forced labor gangs working_on highway and railroad construction in the area , formerly a war zone where ethnic Karen and Mon rebels were_active . &quot; We think these reports are credible , &quot; said a knowledgeable U.S. official , who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the_matter . &quot; Forced labor is an important aspect of the human_rights problem in Burma. &quot; No evidence has surfaced directly linking the alleged labor abuses to plans by Unocal and its French partner , Total , to build a 38-mile pipeline through the Ye-Tavoy region , in Myanmar ' s southern panhandle , to Thailand . The U.S. official said there is &quot; certainly a possibility &quot; of a link . But Unocal officials said any construction in the area has nothing to do with the pipeline project . Pipeline construction would begin only if offshore drilling concessions , located in Myanmar ' s territorial_waters in the Andaman Sea , prove commercially viable , Unocal officials said . &quot; We will not hire slave labor , &quot; said Dennis Codon , vice_president and general counsel for Unocal . &quot; We will not be a party to that. &quot; Yet the Unocal proxy resolution , filed by investors affiliated with the Interfaith Center_on Corporate Responsibility , brings focus to a festering trouble spot in U.S. foreign_policy . And it highlights the kinds of ethical questions corporations must ask themselves as they pursue opportunities in developing countries . &quot; Unocal and other corporations claim political neutrality in Myanmar , &quot; the proxy resolution states . &quot; However , doing business with a repressive regime is inherently political. &quot; Myanmar ' s ruling military junta , which calls itself the State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) , &quot; flaunts its partnerships with foreign corporations as proof of political legitimacy , &quot; the resolution asserts . John Imle , Unocal executive_vice_president , insisted that Unocal representatives in Myanmar have seen no evidence to substantiate the claims of human_rights abuses in the pipeline area . He added that Unocal believes its presence in Myanmar will contribute to the growth of democracy . &quot; I cannot take an anti-SLORC stand , &quot; Imle said . &quot; But I don ' t think they ' re gaining legitimacy on the world stage by having Total and Unocal there . I think the people have gained through employment . . . and Western influence. &quot; Unocal has been_active in Myanmar since 1988 ; it abandoned an unsuccessful onshore drilling site in 1992 . The tension between U.S. commercial interests and human_rights concerns in Myanmar mirrors the increasingly belligerent dispute over China ' s trade privileges . Sometime over the next several weeks , the Clinton_Administration is expected to announce a tougher plan_of_action for Myanmar , which may include economic sanctions , knowledgeable sources say . The new policy will follow a series of White_House discussions with a group of Nobel Peace Prize_winners who have been protesting the house_arrest of fellow laureate Aung San Suu Kyi . Aung leads the National League for Democracy , the party that won Myanmar ' s first free election by a landslide in 1990 . The military junta abrogated the election results and cracked_down on dissent . Western countries stopped foreign_aid after the military massacred hundreds and possibly thousands of civilian demonstrators in 1988 . But in the absence of economic sanctions , international human_rights activists have been pressuring corporations to voluntarily withdraw from Myanmar , or adopt a code_of_conduct that would restrict their activities . Activists complain that doing business with the SLORC regime not only legitimizes the military government , but brings_in the badly needed hard currency that will ensure its survival . In the Total-Unocal deal , the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise , the state oil_company , will acquire a 15 % stake in the gas project once it starts producing , a Unocal spokeswoman said . Unocal , which now owns 47.5 % of the project , will retain at least a 28 % interest ; Total , the lead partner , will control about 31 % . The Petroleum Authority of Thailand has an option for a 26 % stake . So far , the activists have had little influence on U.S. corporate policy . The exception has been privately owned Levi Strauss , which withdrew operations from Myanmar as well as China in 1992 , citing human_rights concerns . Besides Unocal , shareholder resolutions on the Myanmar human_rights question have been filed at three other corporations this year : Amoco Corp. , Texaco Inc. and Pepsico Inc. But all three persuaded the Securities and Exchange Commission to strike the measures from their proxy statements . ( Chicago-based Amoco announced last month that it was withdrawing from an onshore energy exploration project in Myanmar , citing economic reasons. ) Unocal , however , chose not to appeal_to the SEC . Company officials said they allowed the Myanmar resolution to remain on the proxy statement because they wanted to engage in open discussions with its sponsors and let shareholders decide . Father William G . Devine , a Jesuit priest from Boston who has spearheaded the Unocal stockholder measure , said he has met twice so far with Codon , the company lawyer . A meeting with Imle is scheduled for Wednesday . &quot; Unocal says it really wants a dialogue , and they ' re coming all_the way across the country to sit_down with us , &quot; he said . &quot; But their answers aren ' t very clear . There ' s not much follow_through yet. &quot; The Interfaith Center_on Corporate Responsibility , which Devine represents , holds 3 # 608 of Unocal ' s 240 million outstanding shares . Devine noted that the resolution does not censure Unocal or require it to suspend operations in Myanmar , but only directs management to study the situation and prepare a report for shareholders . Still , Imle said the company wants the resolution defeated to avoid setting a precedent . &quot; If we created reports for every Unocal shareholder , we ' d be writing a lot of reports , &quot; he said . &quot; We don ' t have the time. &quot; A group of Pepsico shareholders asked_for and received a report on the company ' s activities in Myanmar last year without resorting_to a proxy resolution . This year they filed a resolution demanding the company withdraw , but Pepsico got the SEC ' s permission to drop the measure from its proxy , said a spokesman for the Purchase , N.Y.-based company . Meanwhile , the Investor Responsibility Research_Center ( IRRC ) -- a Washington group that evaluates social issues facing shareholders -- issued a report last week on the Unocal resolution . &quot; That SLORC is guilty of serious human_rights abuses in_general appears beyond any reasonable doubt , despite assertions by the oil_companies , &quot; the report said . &quot; The charges of forced labor and relocation are open_to more question . . . . &quot; Some shareholders may feel that a vote_in favor of this resolution could help to establish the truth of these allegations , &quot; the IRRC concluded . But the group added that the resolution also brings Unocal management ' s judgment on Myanmar into question , possibly &quot; endangering projects and relationships that are providing -- or seem to offer the prospect of providing -- substantial profits for the company. &quot; Unocal ' s Codon expressed doubts about the report ' s objectivity . &quot; I would n ' t say they ' re not neutral , &quot; he said . &quot; But I would say they ' re being lobbied and petitioned by that group ( of religious investors ) . &quot; The IRRC report cites allegations of forced labor abuses in Myanmar by the State_Department and human_rights advocacy groups such_as Amnesty International and Asia Watch . It quotes a United Nations investigator as saying &quot; atrocities are being committed consistently and on a wide scale by the soldiers of the Myanmar army against innocent villagers. &quot; However , it is not clear whether evidence of forced labor in the Total-Unocal pipeline area can be clearly documented and whether such abuses can be linked to pipeline infrastructure . A British documentary maker said he recently visited the pipeline area and photographed a laborer in chains . An American anthropologist said she interviewed an army_officer there who described the infrastructure work as partly aimed at &quot; boosting security &quot; for the pipeline . Neither claim could be independently verified . &quot; This is all hearsay in my mind , &quot; said Codon . &quot; We ' re asking for proof and evidence. &quot; Focus of Controversy A proposed natural_gas pipeline in which Los Angeles-based Unocal will be a major investor has prompted questions from religious activists about the company ' s activities in military-ruled Myanmar .
