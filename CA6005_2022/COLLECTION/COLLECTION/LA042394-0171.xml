   <HEADLINE> MEMORIES OF NIXON ARE BITTERSWEET FOR VALLEY POLITICIANS , ACADEMICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For San Fernando Valley-area politicians and academics who knew and studied him , the memories of Richard Nixon are indeed bittersweet -- that of a shrewd , complicated man , a slick and media-savvy former President always ready to deal the quick political pay-back while forgiving himself for any mistake . For better or worse , they agree that Nixon was indeed a chameleon , a political animal of more_than nine lives , able to rise from the ashes of Watergate to become a respected political statesman who changed the face of American foreign_policy . But the debate will rage for years : How will history treat the 37th President ? &quot; From the very early days the man entered politics , it was quite clear that was going_to be his career . And from the very early days , he was a scoundrel , &quot; said Eugene Price , chairman of the political_science department at Cal State Northridge , who once spent a day interviewing the former President at his home_in San Clemente . &quot; He was either a politically amoral or immoral person , &quot; he said . &quot; Politically , his attitude was anything goes as long as you don ' t get caught . To his dying day , he could never understand why an observing public could not condone his activity in Watergate , &quot; Price added , saying Nixon simply considered the debacle a matter of politics . A self-described &quot; middle-of-the-road liberal , &quot; Price said he doubted that Nixon ' s reputation will be much redeemed over the years and that history will rank him as a &quot; mediocre &quot; President along with the_likes_of Herbert Hoover and Calvin_Coolidge . &quot; He was just a tacky politician . He had no real class . Who in America can point to Richard Nixon and say , ' There ' s the man I would like my daughter to marry , ' &quot; Price said . &quot; The President is our great national image , but in his hands , that became squandered. &quot; For John Broesamle , a CSUN history professor who ' s written_about Nixon in a book on modern politics , Nixon will be among the most difficult Presidents of this century to evaluate because his great achievements , such_as reaching detente with the Soviet_Union , were counterbalanced by even greater failures , such_as Watergate and Vietnam . But on a personal level , &quot; Nixon ' s a man who spent much of his career over a span of more_than 40 years involved in an exercise of explaining his past behavior and rehabilitating his image , &quot; Broesamle said . And partly because of Nixon ' s successful efforts to recast his career , time will mellow history ' s reading of it , he added . However , he said that will probably only boost Nixon ' s presidency from &quot; failure to marginal failure , from the lower class to the lower middle class. &quot; He said history will record the man as &quot; crude beyond any external expectation , &quot; &quot; petty , mean and vindictive , &quot; and &quot; an opportunist whose chief character flaw was a lack of principle. &quot; &quot; Historians shouldn ' t mellow too_much toward Richard Nixon because he doesn ' t deserve it , &quot; Broesamle concluded , saying the tarnish of Watergate will never be wiped_away . &quot; His most memorable phrase was ' I ' m not a crook ' -- and he was. &quot; Despite calling him &quot; a control freak &quot; and a man with &quot; an awful lot of psychological hang-ups , &quot; Rodolfo Acuna , CSUN professor of Chicano studies , said history will record Nixon as a much better President than he was popularly perceived during the Watergate era , particularly in terms of his foreign_policy successes . Acuna said Nixon &quot; had much more vision in foreign_policy &quot; than Ronald Reagan and called Nixon &quot; much brighter &quot; than either Reagan or John F . Kennedy . &quot; If Reagan would have been in during Vietnam , he would have nuked them . ( Nixon ) probably will go_down in history as an above-average President when it comes_to foreign_policy , &quot; he said . Yet at the domestic level , Acuna blamed Nixon for reductions in job training_programs , being weak on civil_rights and beginning to undermine Lyndon B . Johnson ' s anti-poverty programs . &quot; He set the groundwork for Reagan . Reagan was a President who screwed the middle_class , where Nixon with his policies turned the middle_class against the poor. &quot; Ed Davis , a former GOP state_senator and Los Angeles police_chief , now 77 , recalls the former President as a complicated man always ready to forgive his own mistakes , one with an elephant ' s memory . And he ' s glad that he ' s not the historian who has to decide if Nixon , in the end , was America ' s friend or bad-boy foe . &quot; It ' s going_to be a real test for historians because of Watergate , &quot; he said . &quot; He obviously made some terrible mistakes there on leveling with the American people . But his recovery from that and his re-emergence as a statesman shouldn ' t be overlooked . &quot; In the end , he proved that , between Watergate and his life as a political statesman , he was very human and that there ' s hope for everyone . &quot; He was a man of very strong convictions who was really brilliant . I would always be amazed when I sat_down with him when he could recount the football or baseball_scores from years ago and political elections as well . He never seemed to forget anything. &quot; Davis recalls at times having a rocky road with Nixon , after once having called former Atty . Gen . John Mitchell &quot; a bald-faced liar. &quot; In his own way , Nixon wreaked his revenge . A picture taken with the President -- a would-be keepsake for most people -- showed only Davis ' left ear . And once , among a group of other police_chiefs visiting the Oval Office , Nixon looked_at Davis and handed him a pair of cuff-links , saying he wanted to be sure that Davis knew that the items did not come at taxpayer expense . &quot; He was trying to embarrass me , &quot; Davis recalled . &quot; I merely responded that , ' Mr. President , I didn ' t think you stole them. ' &quot; In the end , though , Davis said , Nixon showed his true political colors . In the early 1980s , a local Republican group asked to use Nixon ' s Western White_House , Casa Pacifica in San Clemente , for a fund-raiser . At first , the ex-President was all business , saying over the telephone that the house could be used only if all profits went_to the Nixon Library . &quot; Then he called me back on the phone and said that he and Pat had talked the_matter over and that not only would our group get_to keep the profits , but that they insisted on catering the whole affair . &quot; He had a nice human side . Too_bad his brilliance was wasted. &quot; Former Rep . Bobbi Fiedler recalls meeting Nixon in 1984 with other politicians for a strategy session prior to Reagan ' s reelection -- and walking away impressed with his political acumen , even a decade after he had left political office . &quot; For me , the personal characteristic that stands_out is the high-level skill in terms of strategy , &quot; she said . &quot; Many Presidents relied_on pollsters and political consultants . But Nixon was very hands-on in that regard . He had strong opinions and many , if not all , of them were well-founded . They turned_out to be true. &quot; As far as Nixon ' s legacy , Fiedler believes that he will be able to outdistance Watergate as a career milestone . &quot; Ultimately , this is a generational matter , &quot; she said . &quot; The younger generation won ' t be as tuned_in to Watergate as the older ones . They didn ' t see him in that context . The fact that he stayed in the political_arena and continued to have a role in foreign_policy will more be remembered , I think . &quot; Still , Watergate is hard to forget. &quot; Corporate political consultant Paul Clarke , as a reporter for ABC News , covered Nixon as President during his glory years : &quot; Unfortunately , Watergate will be the stone around Richard Nixon ' s historical neck , &quot; he said . &quot; But there is so_much to consider about the man . In the area of foreign_policy , he was the person who started the major changes in the Cold_War relationships . There was his relationship with ( Soviet leader Leonid ) Breshnev , his stature around the world that helped move the nation from a real Cold_War posture. &quot; Then there were his bold moves_in international finance , removing the United States from the gold_standard , allowing the dollar to compete in foreign markets . &quot; It had a long-lasting effect on economy , &quot; Clarke said . &quot; He realized back then when nobody else did that international trade would be the thing. &quot; Clarke said that from his viewpoint as a journalist , Nixon will find a place in the midlands of American Presidents in terms of greatness and fiasco , &quot; not in the morass of Coolidge , Grant and Fillmore , but not with Lincoln and Jefferson. &quot;</TEXT>
