   <HEADLINE> FOR ANY SOLUTION TO HAITI , U.S. MUST INCLUDE ARISTIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Haitian problem is growing thornier by the minute . Amid a deluge of proposals to end it , the issues that caused the crisis are growing clearer : an entrenched business elite unwilling to part_with an iota of its power nor share a penny from its pocketbook ; a military that traditionally acts_as paid agent of the business elite ' s agenda ; an overwhelming majority of poor and disenfranchised who hoped change would come when they elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide , a president unique in Haiti ' s history because he represented the people ' s interests , and a large contingent of jobless , uneducated young toughs who see no hope for a future and are willing to join whatever death squad will pay_for a house , a month ' s meals or a bottle of rum . Aristide ' s election was supposed to have produced a peaceful overthrow of the status_quo , but because he went_about changing things in Haiti , and didn ' t do_it slowly or subtly enough , he was overthrown instead , taking things in Haiti back to square one -- to square zero , in fact . He tried to purge and professionalize the military , to tax businesses , to eliminate the drug trade , and to grant workers certain basic rights . These reforms , which seem elementary , are exactly what the elite in Haiti will not stand_for . Here are some of the amusing and not so amusing solutions being bandied_about in Washington : * Bay of Pigs Jr . Since Bay of Pigs Sr . worked so well . This solution proposes that the U.S._government -- rather than send its own boys -- arm a group of Haitian exiles and send them in boats to retake Haiti and install a new government . The question is , what group of Haitians would the Americans arm ? There are so many . Taking a leaf from the Bay of Pigs , there are the crazed right-wingers ; there are the crazed left-wingers ( split , of course , into many warring cells ) ; there are Christian groups and voodoo groups , friends of the United States and avowed anti-Americans . There are relatives of the elite , groups of professionals ( send_in the doctors ) and people militating for a mass movement of the proletariat ( as if Haiti had one ) . There are Aristide supporters , former Aristide supporters and anti-anti-Aristide supporters . You choose . * The Black King of La Gonave . This is my personal favorite , actually mentioned for two days running in the national press . ( This proposal , at least , has a historical precedent , sort of : During the U.S. occupation of Haiti , Marine Lt . Faustin Wirkus of Pennsylvania , civil administrator of La Gonave , a barren and impoverished Haitian island about 40 miles from Port-au-Prince , was crowned king by the people there , and was known as &quot; The White King of La Gonave. &quot; ) The Black King solution proposes that Aristide should be flown to La Gonave . There , he should gather and organize his people for an armed attack on the main land . The United States could then remove itself from the continuing crisis . Unfortunately for Aristide and the men and women he would need to take_back Port-au-Prince , there is not enough drinking_water or food on La Gonave now to support the current population . This plan also seems to posit that Aristide ' s physical removal from the United States would somehow enable Washington to wash its hands of the_matter . &quot; You ' re on_your_own now &quot; is the theory . But the United States has never let the Haitians go it alone . America has been involved in Haiti since the beginning -- since Haitian slaves declared independence from France in 1804 , while the United States still relied_on slavery ; since United Fruit and the National City Bank became major players on the island ; since the United States invaded and occupied Haiti from 1915-1934 ; since the Cold_War , when we supported the cold-blooded dictator Francois ( Papa Doc ) Duvalier as a reasonable alternative to an imperceptible communist threat ; since the fall of his son , Jean-Claude ( Baby Doc ) Duvalier , in 1986 , when we supported the Haitian military as a force for democracy . And now , since the post-Aristide era , when the United States has obfuscated and generally encouraged an atmosphere in which the military regime believed it had the tacit support of Washington and the international community . * Think_Tank Option . Form a multi-party interim government that would permit a U.N. force to oversee next year ' s elections and stay_in_place afterward to protect the results . If you ' re just reading along , you don ' t notice how no one says who is going_to form this new government . You don ' t notice that no one mentions the military high_command stepping_down . You don ' t notice that justice is not mentioned in this high-minded-sounding solution , nor the elected government of Aristide . You don ' t notice how that omission implies an amnesty for crimes committed by death squads and the military in the coup aftermath ( some 3 # 000 killed ) . You don ' t notice that &quot; multiparty &quot; government in a country where parties are tiny staffs of self-important politicians really means a U.S.-led and -directed &quot; transition &quot; committee . You don ' t notice that next year ' s elections are presidential elections in which Aristide cannot constitutionally run , because Haitian law does not permit successive terms for the president . You aren ' t made aware that there is hardly_a Haitian who would vote_in such elections . Most of all , you don ' t notice that the Think_Tank Option has been the U.S._government ' s underlying solution to the Haitian crisis all along , and that the only way it could work with the high_command in place is at the whim of the generals , as a tool of their policies . Which are , in case anyone has forgotten : to wipe_out all opposition ; to destroy the progressive movement for the next generation or two ; to prohibit the return of Aristide by any means necessary ; to end literacy , education and health_care for the Haitian people , and to enrich themselves . What all these solutions share is a subtle but unmistakable plan to dump Aristide . Yet Aristide must be a willing part of any solution , or it will not be a real solution . To the Haitian voter , Aristide is the living symbol of Haitian democracy . Any plan that excludes him excludes democracy , as far as they are concerned . This has been the Bush and Clinton_administrations ' problem : They don ' t like Aristide , but they can ' t create anything even faintly legitimate without him . So , to solve the Haitian problem , the Americans have to do something they don ' t want to do : reinstate Aristide . This has been the reason for the stalemate in U.S. policy , and why the generals perceived that Washington was not really against them . The two most important goals for any real solution are the high_command ' s resignation from the Haitian Army and Aristide ' s reinstatement . For more_than two years , the Haitian business elite has been paying lobbyists to get the sanctions lifted -- thus one must believe the sanctions are working . The Clinton_Administration is now trying some of the right things : tightening U.N. sanctions ; pressuring President Joachim N . Balaguer of the Dominican_Republic to close his border with Haiti where goods banned by the sanctions are still pouring through . Now the Administration should do more . Take_away the military ' s motive for staying . ( Hugh profits from contraband are enriching them. ) Bomb the new highway that brings oil and other contraband from the border to Port-au-Prince . Include families of the elite in the ban on visas and the freezing of assets . Shut down commercial as well as non-commercial air traffic to Haiti . Help Aristide ' s government set_up an offshore radio_station to provide Haitians with information and give them hope . Convince Balaguer -- by threatening an aid cutoff or elimination of the Dominican_Republic ' s special sugar-trade status -- to allow a multilateral force to patrol the border . Long before military intervention becomes necessary , the high_command will step aside -- though it might take some months of tough talk and tougher measures . Is the Clinton_Administration capable of maintaining a steady course with this policy , or will it cave to expediency and hope that a fast military_action ( a la Panama ) will give it a needed boost in public_opinion ? Because the Administration ' s recent , positive maneuvering on the Haiti front has been so timid , so lacking in moral backbone , the long , painful crisis goes on. *</TEXT>
