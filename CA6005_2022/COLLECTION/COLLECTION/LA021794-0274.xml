   <HEADLINE> O.C. ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO U.S.-JAPAN TRADE CHILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When trade relations between Japan and the United States get chilly , an icy breeze blows through Orange County . Japan is Orange County ' s largest export destination , taking about $ 1 billion in computers , medicines and other goods produced locally every year . And Orange County is the home of U.S. headquarters for Japanese companies like Mazda , Mitsubishi , Kawasaki and Ricoh , which provide thousands of jobs locally . So it hit_home Wednesday after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said that the United States may seek high tariffs on several hundred million dollars ' worth of Japanese goods in response to Japan ' s refusal to fully open its cellular_telephone market to companies such_as Motorola Inc. &quot; If there was a general deterioration of exports to Japan , then Orange County is bound to lose more_than other areas , &quot; said economist Anil Puri of Cal State Fullerton , who has analyzed the county ' s export industry . Without specifics , many businesses were unsure of how to gauge the announcement or know what to expect , but officials were uniformly unhappy about the prospects of rising discord among the two countries . &quot; I don ' t want to see it deteriorate to_the_point of emotional hatred , &quot; said Maho Fukuda , president of Maho International Co . Ltd. , an Irvine trading company that sells U.S.-made industrial machinery to the Japanese . Her business would suffer if trade_barriers went_up , she said , but &quot; it will ( put ) pressure on the Japanese. &quot; What Fukuda said she fears most is a resurgence of anti-Japanese sentiment . &quot; Americans are always blaming the Japanese and the Japanese are always blaming the Americans , &quot; she said . Within 30 days , Kantor said , the United States would publish a list of Japanese products that could be subject_to punitive tariffs of up_to 100 % if the cellular_phone dispute isn ' t resolved . In Japan , chief government spokesman Masayoshi Takemura said Tokyo would wait for a U.S. decision on sanctions before responding to the U.S. trade representative ' s announcement . But a bilateral trade war is unlikely , suggests Cal State Fullerton ' s Puri . Japan and the United States both have a lot to lose from retaliatory tariffs and other restrictions , so any action by the Clinton_Administration will probably be fairly limited , he predicts . About 16 % of all Orange County companies that sell overseas are trading with Japan , said UCI management professor Kenneth L . Kraemer , who released the university ' s annual survey of the county ' s top_executives earlier this week . While a trade war could cause short-term pain , Kraemer said he sees long-term benefits . Such action could force Japan to pry open markets for high-technology products heretofore closed to Americans , creating new opportunities for Orange County companies , such_as computer disk-drive maker Western Digital Corp . in Irvine . For now , most Orange County companies with ties to Japan are waiting to see how the two nations respond . If the United States imposes tariffs on Japanese-made cellular_phones , that could hurt phone manufacturer Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc. in Cypress , part of the far-flung Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Electric Corp . &quot; It ' s too early for us to tell what impact there would be , &quot; said Mitsubishi spokesman Tom Chapman . &quot; It has been mentioned that cellular_telephones might face a tariff , but we don ' t know what will happen. &quot; The company , however , has several options . For instance , if tariffs are slapped_on assembled phones imported from Japan , Mitsubishi would likely expand its assembly operations in Braselton , Ga. , which depends largely on Japanese-made parts . If the parts are hit with tariffs too , Mitsubishi would be forced to find American suppliers of those parts or consider raising the prices on its phones , though they are assembled in the United States . Similarly , Toshiba America Information_Systems Inc. in Irvine could see its business disrupted if the Clinton_Administration reinstitutes tariffs on imported computer_screens , a sanction that was lifted last year . Under President George_Bush , tariffs were imposed on flat-panel displays that were imported into the United States , but not on displays that were brought into the country as part of an assembled computer . As a result , companies with U.S. manufacturing , such_as Toshiba America in Irvine , shifted assembly of the affected portable_computers offshore so that they would n ' t be hit with a tariff . Critics of the policy contended the tariff forced thousands of jobs overseas . &quot; The lifting of that tariff allowed us to assemble the computers here and create jobs here , &quot; said Robert Wittenburg , a Toshiba spokesman . Rino Zaccuri , spokesman for Ricoh Electronics Inc. in Tustin , said the company doesn ' t expect to be affected with product sanctions since it is not involved in the telecommunications industry . The company ' s 1 # 000 employees in the county are involved in making and selling copiers . But the currency fluctuations resulting from the rise of the yen could play havoc with the company ' s financial planning , he said . Like with the electronics_companies , Orange County ' s cadre of Japanese car and motorcycle importers say they are paying close attention . Japanese auto and motorcycle importers -- Mazda , Mitsubishi , Kawasaki , Suzuki and Yamaha , which all have U.S. headquarters in the county -- already are being hurt by the growing weakness of the dollar against the yen . So to the extent that trade_policy affects currency exchange_rates and pressures Japanese companies to increase prices in the United States , the burgeoning trade war would be a problem . &quot; The strength of the yen affects us more &quot; than the present strain in trade relations between the two countries , said Kim Custer , spokesman for Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc. in Cypress . Tom Meyers , marketing director for American Suzuki Motor Corp. , the Brea-based importer of cars , sports utility vehicles , motorcycles and outboard_motors , said he and other officials of the company don ' t see the trade dispute affecting their business at all . &quot; At this point , the issue seems strictly one targeted at mobile phones , and we think any retaliation against Japan will be in that area and would n ' t affect our industry. &quot; * HOW JAPANESE SEE IT : In pragmatic Japan , fair trade is more a matter of perception .
