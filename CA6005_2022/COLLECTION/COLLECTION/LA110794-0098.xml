   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS ' 94 ; GAY RIGHTS FOES TAKE TO BALLOT AGAIN ; ELECTION : DESPITE LOSING IN ' 92 , AN OREGON GROUP IS BACKING A REVISED MEASURE TO BAN LAWS PROTECTING HOMOSEXUALS . IDAHO HAS A VERSION TOO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Forgive the Oregon voter who may be a tad confused about what year this is . Just as in the fall of 1992 , radio and television advertisements boom warnings about gay propaganda infiltrating the schools , of taxpayers being forced to subsidize the promotion of homosexuality . Warnings of censorship and state-sanctioned discrimination boom back . The Oregon Citizens Alliance , author of a failed 1992 anti-gay-rights initiative that riveted the state , is_on the ballot again with a revised version . The arguments are much the same this time , although some of the fizz has gone_out of the fight . Not only is it Round 2 , but there are a number of other controversial initiatives grabbing the media ' s attention this year . &quot; I ' d definitely say the decibel level is a hell of a lot lower , &quot; said Portland pollster Tim Hibbitts , who predicts that this fall ' s toned-down measure will garner more votes than its predecessor and even has a chance of passing . Along with a similar proposal in Idaho , the Oregon initiative is one of two anti-gay-rights measures on state ballots this week , far fewer than conservative activists had hoped for but testament nonetheless to their determination to keep the issue alive . Initiative proponents in both states are trailing in the polls and lagging behind in financial donations and political endorsements . Even if the measures pass , they will surely wind_up in court . A milder anti-gay-rights referendum approved by Colorado voters in 1992 was recently declared unconstitutional by that state ' s Supreme Court . And in a formal opinion , the Idaho attorney_general has said his state ' s ballot proposal is also unconstitutional . None of that seems to faze initiative backers , who insist they have their fingers on the public pulse . &quot; I anticipate this thing passing_by 56 % to 60 % , &quot; said Dennis Mansfield , one of the drafters of Idaho ' s Proposition 1 and executive_director of Idaho Family Forum , associated with the national conservative group Focus_on the Family . Certainly the history of the Colorado initiative gives him hope . Behind in the polls and endorsements before the ' 92 election , the referendum won anyway . Moreover , Hibbitts does not think the Colorado court ruling will influence voters . &quot; It ' s an emotional vote , not a vote based on what a judge says one way or the other , &quot; he said . The Oregon and Idaho proposals have virtually identical goals -- not surprisingly , since the Idaho Citizens Alliance , the principal sponsor of that state ' s measure , is an offshoot of the Oregon group . Both initiatives would prevent state and local_government from adopting laws protecting gay_men and lesbians from discrimination or recognizing same-sex partnerships . The measures would further forbid the spending of public money in any way that implies approval of homosexuality or its sympathetic treatment in public_schools . &quot; The whole key is that there will not be . . . the endorsement of it as an acceptable lifestyle , &quot; Mansfield said . In an effort to make this year ' s measure more palatable to Oregon voters , the OCA dropped the charged language of the 1992 proposal , which lumped homosexuality with sadism and pedophilia and condemned it as &quot; abnormal , wrong , unnatural and perverse. &quot; The group also has included wording intended to counter some of the more effective opposition arguments used two years ago -- that the constitutional amendment would bar the government licensing of gay professionals and rid public_library shelves of literary classics that contain even a hint of homosexuality . But opponents argue that Measure 13 , as it is known , is the same old thing wrapped in a prettier package . &quot; It ' s legal discrimination , &quot; said Dennis Brodigan of the No on 13 campaign . &quot; It ' s legal censorship . It curtails curriculum that can be taught. &quot; In both states , the opposition campaigns are hitting pragmatic themes . So completely do their advertisements sidestep discussions of homosexuality that it is often hard to figure_out that the initiatives have anything to do with gay_men and lesbians . Idaho ' s No on 1 Coalition warns that the proposed measure &quot; dictates interference in the lives of all Idahoans &quot; and will cost taxpayers millions of dollars to implement and defend in court . Given the conservative reputation of the state , the coalition has amassed an impressive array of allies , ranging from the governor to the Catholic bishop of Boise . &quot; Many of the conservatives in this state are fiscal , economic conservatives and not social morality conservatives , &quot; said Don Crowley , chairman of the University of Idaho ' s political_science department . With the help of out-of-state contributions , the No on 1 group raised $ 500 # 000 , according to campaign manager Diane Sands . The coalition ' s media advertising expenditures of $ 250 # 000 overshadows the $ 20 # 000 spent on television by initiative supporters . Still , Mansfield says , the pro-Proposition 1 group is getting plenty out of its limited TV time . &quot; I ' m sure it knocks a_couple_of potato farmers off their sofas , &quot; he said . Taking cues from other anti-gay campaigns , the Proposition 1 ads feature provocative clips of transvestites in big-city gay-pride parades , interviews with gays bragging about their political clout and the comments of African Americans complaining that gay_men and lesbians have no right to the civil_rights protections granted blacks . The Oregon group , which portrayed gays as diseased , homicidal child_molesters in its 1992 campaign , has tempered its rhetoric somewhat this year . Still , the group last month claimed that homosexuals were responsible_for the Holocaust . Questions of accuracy also kept an OCA television ad off the air until a sympathetic congressional candidate incorporated it into one of his campaign spots . The ad cites a disputed incident in a suburban school district as evidence of the promotion of homosexuality by public educators . District officials say the OCA version is exaggerated and inaccurate . Whatever the outcome of the two referendums , the future holds promise of more of the same . An anti-gay initiative will appear on the Maine ballot next year . And if the OCA fails a second time , it vows to try again in 1996 . &quot; One election cycle we ' re going to get a majority , &quot; said OCA chairman Lon Mabon . Gay-rights proponents , for their part , say the initiative battles are sowing seeds of activism in fresh ground . &quot; They wanted to squash gays and lesbians , &quot; Sands said of her Idaho foes . &quot; They ' ve in fact brought the gay , lesbian and bisexual community together. &quot;</TEXT>
