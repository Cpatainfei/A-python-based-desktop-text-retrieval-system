   <TEXT> Perfect for school_days is Casio ' s new Secret Sender 6000 Diary , an electronic digital diary for kids that does a lot more_than store telephone_numbers and addresses .

In addition to a variety of practical functions , Secret Sender also can send messages from one unit to another via infrared signals . And it can even activate a TV or VCR . In its message mode , the compact diary can send 10 pre-programmed messages or a child ' s own personalized ones as far as 25 feet . Up to 10 messages of 28 characters each can be stored , and messages and telephone_directory data can be recalled from the unit ' s memory and sent just by touching a button . The unit ' s display features four lines of 16 characters . Intended for children 8 through 13 , Secret Sender ' s phone directory also has a &quot; Fun Face Maker &quot; that allows kids to create funny faces to accompany friends ' phone_numbers . Addresses , birthdays and other important dates also can be stored . The unit keeps time , too , displaying the time in 29 time_zones on a scrolling world map . A calendar with cartoon pictures for sports , homework , hobbies and the_like reminds the child on what day and time a specific activity is planned , and has a schedule alarm ( in addition to a daily alarm ) so he or she won ' t be late . A &quot; Secret Password &quot; function permits the child to put_in private information as well .

It is available at Target , Toys R Us , Good_Guys and Fedco . If you can ' t find it in your area , call ( 800 ) YO-CASIO . Now You Can Draw and Sniff Even crayons have gone high-tech this fall . Crayola is out with Magic Scent Crayons that feature &quot; micro-encapsulated &quot; fragrances in the nontoxic crayons . There are 16 food and nature fragrances -- orange , lemon , banana , chocolate , strawberry , blueberry , cherry , spearmint , lime , licorice , grape , coconut , bubble_gum , rose , pine and a fresh air scent -- and they smell quite realistic . It ' s not too likely kids would eat the fragrant crayons , because they don ' t smell unless you draw with them or scratch the surface of the crayon . But Binney &amp; Smith , makers of Crayola crayons , has had them tested by toxicologists and an independent safety specialist to assure their safety . After evaluating the scented crayons , Dorothy Drago , the specialist who was formerly with the Consumer Product Safety Commission , said they &quot; pose no greater potential for ingestion than do regular crayons. &quot; Drago reasoned : &quot; The scent is produced only on the writing / drawing surface , so if anything , it is the surface that may be licked or eaten . The most common coloring surface is paper , which does not pose a serious ingestion hazard. &quot; Another test was done with 170 families with_children , who used the crayons for a week . None of the parents reported that their children had placed the crayons in their mouths or eaten them . Crayola Magic Scent Crayons ( $ 2.79 ) come_in boxes of 16 regular size or eight large size and are available nationally .</TEXT>
