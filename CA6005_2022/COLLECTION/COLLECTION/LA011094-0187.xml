   <HEADLINE> TRADE AGREEMENTS BRIGHTENING THE GLOOMY WORLD ECONOMIES ; FINANCE : GATT , IN PARTICULAR , IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A STRONG BOOST AT A TIME WHEN KEY COUNTRIES ARE DEALING WITH RECESSION , UNEMPLOYMENT , INFLATION AND OTHER ILLS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The world ' s economies staggered through 1993 with a wide range of maladies , from recession in Japan to high unemployment in Western Europe and inflation in Russia . But economists see a healthier future as they pin their hopes on expanding world trade . The 117-nation General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , in particular , is expected to provide a strong boost by eliminating many tariffs that impede the flow of goods and services . The pact , 400 pages long , was seven years in the making and finalized in mid-December . GATT is scheduled to take_effect in 1995 , after it has been ratified by the participating nations . The formal signing will be in Morocco in April . Economists say it couldn ' t come at a more welcome time . As 1994 opens , unemployment is ravaging Western Europe , weak oil prices are hurting Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and inflation is gripping the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe . The United States is moving farther out of recession , but higher interest_rates could derail its fragile recovery . Latin_America and Africa also are looking toward renewed growth after emerging from years of debt crises and droughts . In Asia , the so-called &quot; Small Tigers &quot; of Singapore , Taiwan , South_Korea , Hong Kong , Malaysia and Thailand , growth champions for years , are finding themselves overshadowed by the &quot; Big Tiger &quot; of China , which expanded at a double-digit pace . Western Europe had pinned its economic recovery on the creation of a separate 17-nation free_trade zone embracing 380 million people from the Arctic to the Mediterranean . The pact , made in January , was not ratified until December . About 18 million people remain jobless in the 12-nation European Community , an unemployment_rate of 10.6 % . Economists predict it could reach 11.3 % by 1995 . Jacques Delors , president of the EC executive commission , said the EC would have to bring more people into the job market or face the end of the European way_of_life , with 30 million unemployed by the end of the century . EC Economics Commissioner Henning Christophersen predicted the EC economy would grow 1.3 % in 1994 , following a 0.4 % contraction in 1993 . &quot; The recovery must mainly come from trade with third countries , &quot; he said . But which countries ? Japan , whose unemployment is rising as corporate profits , auto exports and the stock_market are all plunging , faces bleak prospects this year . Despite a tradition of lifetime employment , more Japanese companies have resorted_to dismissing workers . Bank_of_Japan Gov . Yasushi Mieno said in December that there were still no signs of a recovery . The United States , experiencing a stop-and-go recovery since the most recent recession ended in March , 1991 , faces modestly favorable prospects for this year . Its economy will grow about 2.8 % this year , the same as last year , the National Assn . of Business Economists forecast . The United States , Canada and Mexico agreed to the North_American Free_Trade Agreement in December , 1993 . NAFTA takes_in 360 million consumers and about $ 7 trillion a year in production . In South_America , the Third_World ' s biggest debtor , Brazil reached a deal with creditor banks on a major part of its $ 120 billion in foreign debt . It was the last major Latin_American country to do so under a U.S.-sponsored plan . &quot; When completed , ( the agreement ) will mark the end of the Latin_American debt crisis , &quot; which had stuck the region in economic stagnation in the 1980s , said bank negotiator William Rhodes . The OPEC nations seem to be entering an economic_crisis of_their_own . Unable to agree on a production cut_to raise prices , the 12-member cartel decided in November to leave its crude output unchanged at 24.52 million barrels a day . With the oil market glutted , said Ian Seymour , editor of the Middle_East Economic Survey , OPEC faces the possibility of prices moving even lower . That would help restrain inflation in the developed world , but Seymour said it &quot; would obviously be catastrophic on the finances of OPEC. &quot; Meanwhile , parts of Asia anticipated more growth in 1994 . Deutsche Bank of Germany predicted a gross_domestic_product growth_rate of 6.2 % in Taiwan , 5.8 % in South_Korea , 7.2 % in Singapore and 4.5 % in Hong Kong . Hong Kong , a British colony to become part of China in 1997 , saw its economy grow 5.5 % in 1993 , and its per capita output surpassed Britain ' s . Thailand is estimated to grow 8.5 % this year on top of 7.5 % last year . Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . forecasts 7.8 % growth for Indonesia and 8.3 % for Malaysia . Only the Philippines lags in the area with 3.8 % growth foreseen byMerrill Lynch prediction . But China -- which grew at 13 % in 1992 and was expected to surpass that rate in 1993 -- was the standout . Success came as the Communist_Party announced that 100 state-owned enterprises would be turned_into independently run Western-style businesses over the next seven years . China ' s record growth &quot; over the past 15 years has already brought it roughly the same per capita income levels as the economies in Eastern Europe , &quot; said Union Bank of Switzerland . But Nobel Economics Prize_winner Douglass C . North said the former Soviet republics will take about 50 years to reach Western economic levels &quot; if they are lucky. &quot; In the republics and the ex-communist countries of eastern Europe , chaos and confusion reigned in 1993 as democracy struggled to take_hold . Hyperinflation , unemployment and declining industrial production were the main economic ailments .</TEXT>
