   <HEADLINE> SANDOZ TO GOBBLE_UP GERBER FOR $ 3.7 BILLION ; ACQUISITIONS : THE SWISS CONGLOMERATE SHOCKS MANY ANALYSTS BY OFFERING $ 53 A SHARE FOR THE U.S. BABY FOOD GIANT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Baby food giant Gerber Products Co. , whose foods have been a staple in American parents ' cupboards for nearly 70 years , agreed Monday to be acquired by Swiss pharmaceuticals conglomerate Sandoz Corp . for $ 3.7 billion in cash . The deal would allow Gerber , which claims more_than 70 % of the large but stagnant U.S. baby food market , to seek faster growth overseas through Sandoz ' s international network of subsidiaries and distributors . Sandoz , in turn , would acquire a well-known U.S. brand name as it expands its own fast-growing food business , which includes Ovaltine malted drinks . While most analysts praised the deal , many were shocked by the high price Sandoz offered : $ 53 for each Gerber share , or a 53 % premium over last week ' s closing_price . On Monday , Gerber ' s shares shot_up $ 15.50 to close at $ 50.125 on the New York Stock_Exchange . &quot; They paid top dollar , &quot; said food industry_analyst John M . McMillin at Prudential Securities Research . &quot; Gerber has a solid franchise. &quot; However , the Fremont , Mich.-based company ' s franchise is virtually unknown outside the United States , and some analysts questioned Sandoz ' s high price for Gerber , given the costs and tough competition it faces in promoting unfamiliar brands in foreign markets . Gerber draws only 10 % of its $ 1.2 billion in sales from overseas . Of particular interest have been underdeveloped countries in Eastern Europe and Latin_America , where commercially made baby foods are not widely available . Meanwhile , at_home , a nearly stagnant birthrate in the United States has left Gerber , which markets more_than 250 varieties of baby food , struggling to boost sales and profits . Analysts said its baby food volume declined 2 % last year , and the company launched a reorganization to cut operating_costs . With birthrates dropping as &quot; the thirtysomethings turn_into fortysomethings , Gerber needs to be more global to grow , and Sandoz will help them be more global , &quot; McMillin said . &quot; Joining with Sandoz provides us with opportunities for dynamic growth in a much shorter time horizon and with the necessary infrastructure already in place in most major markets , &quot; said Gerber Chairman and President Alfred Piergallini . Sandoz is one the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world , selling a wide variety of prescription_drugs and over-the-counter products , including Triaminic cough syrups , TheraFlu and Ex-Lax . However , more_than 10 % of Sandoz ' s $ 10.3 billion in sales last year came from its health-related foods group , which is also its fastest-growing division . &quot; Gerber ' s position in North_America strengthens our existing base of nutrition products there , &quot; said Rolf Schweizer , chief_executive of Sandoz . &quot; Gerber provides synergies for Sandoz with advanced technologies in processing and packaging which we can apply in Europe and the Far East. &quot; Sandoz said current Gerber management would run the company as a separate subsidiary after the acquisition , which is subject_to shareholder and government approval . Founded originally as a small fruit and vegetable canning company , Gerber entered the baby food business in 1927 when the daughter-in-law of company co-founder Frank Gerber suggested selling prepackaged , strained baby foods . Until then , most baby food was cooked , mashed and strained at_home . Gerber on Monday reported that its fourth-quarter profit for the three months ended March 31 tumbled to $ 25.6 million from $ 40.6 million a year earlier . The company blamed much of the drop on restructuring costs .
