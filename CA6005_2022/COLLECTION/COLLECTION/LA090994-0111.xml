   <TEXT> &quot; Use your imagination , &quot; Roy Frampton was saying , his hand sweeping across the empty battlefield . &quot; Out of the woods straight ahead come 12 # 000 Southerners , line upon line , rank upon rank , regiment upon regiment , marching , marching , marching , 110 steps a minute , keeping the rhythm of the drum , flags waving , an overwhelming tide of men . You hear their yell and now they ' re on the dead run , coming right at us . &quot; The Northerners are here , right where we ' re standing . They ' re firing volley upon volley . Whole rows of Southerners are falling , but Lee ' s army is surging . It ' s chaos . Bloody hand-to-hand combat . Men rolling on top of each other , picking_up rocks and heaving them at one another . . . &quot; Frampton pauses , as though to seek calm amid the fury of battle . He is , in his mind ' s eye , a survivor of Pickett ' s Charge , surrounded by Civil War ghosts who are no longer strangers . He knows many of their names , knows intimate details of their lives . Frampton , 45 , is one of 100 free-lance Gettysburg guides who escorted some of the 1.5 million visitors to the battlefield last year . But people like Frampton -- whose love of history keeps the Civil War from fading from American consciousness -- face a devastating challenge : Urban encroachment is swallowing_up our battlefields faster than they can be saved . &quot; I ' ve been tramping Civil War battlefields for 43 years , &quot; said Jay Luvaas , a professor of military history at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle , Pa. , &quot; and I can tell you they are disappearing fast. &quot; In Spring Hill , Tenn. , a Saturn automobile plant occupies part of the ground where Union and Confederate forces clashed . Large poultry sheds dominate much of the battlefield view in Prairie Grove , Ark . Housing_developments in Fredericksburg , Va. , have eaten_up the tangled forests where the two armies met in hand-to-hand combat during the Wilderness_Campaign in 1864 . Seven hundred new homes will soon claim the last of three battlefields in Winchester , Va. , a town that changed hands so many times during the war -- 72 by one count -- that merchants kept two cash drawers , one for Confederate money , the other for Federal dollars . The Hazen Monument -- one of the oldest Civil War memorials -- stands_in the shadow of a cement factory at Stones River National Battlefield in Tennessee . Five major roadways that feed into Interstate 75 to Atlanta divide the Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park . Two of the four sites of major battles in Tennessee ' s Chattanooga Valley have been lost entirely to urban expansion , and a large chunk of the Manassas battlefield in Virginia was spared from development as a shopping_mall only after public protests prodded a reluctant Congress into buying the disputed 542 acres for $ 120 million in 1989 . &quot; I don ' t think the American public understands how threatened this part of our heritage is , &quot; said Walter Powell , historic preservation officer for the borough of Gettysburg . &quot; This next decade will be the turning point . What we consider important is that close to being destroyed . Even Gettysburg is not safe. &quot; Alarmed by the potential destruction of Manassas , Congress in 1991 established an advisory commission to make the first survey of battlefield sites in 60 years . Its conclusion : &quot; The nation ' s Civil War heritage is in grave danger. &quot; One-third of the principal sites had already been lost or were barely hanging onto existence , the commission said ; without swift action , two-thirds of the sites would be gone_by 2001 . * The commission identified 384 principal battlefields in 25 states from the 10 # 500 sites where armed conflicts occurred during the war . Of the 384 , it chose 50 that had a direct impact on the course of the war and recommended that they be targeted for initial preservation efforts ; it also suggested that tax incentives be provided to encourage preservation of the 144 key battlefields under private ownership . One of the problems that makes the preservationists ' task daunting , says Edwin Bearss , the National_Park_Service ' s chief historian , is that by 1860 , the nation ' s transportation corridors -- the roads , railroads , waterways -- were in place and it was along these routes that the major Civil War battles were fought . Today ' s transportation pattern follows that of the 19th Century and those old turnpikes are now four-lane thoroughfares linking rapidly growing urban_areas . So , unlike battlefields from the Indian Wars -- the most popular of which are in the still-spacious West -- and the Revolutionary War -- which was characterized by small clashes in some now-out-of-the-way places -- the Civil War was fought in a wide path along what has emerged as our interstate highway_system . The interstates -- I-95 linking Virginia , the Carolinas and Georgia ; I-81 through Virginia ' s Shenandoah Valley ; I-65 , I-24 and I-75 from Louisville , Ky. , to Nashville and Atlanta -- have spawned massive development , sprawling suburbs and soaring real_estate prices that threaten the economic feasibility of saving farmland , let alone historic sites that aren ' t on the tax rolls . &quot; What does_it say about us , &quot; David McCullough , a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian , asked a Senate subcommittee recently , &quot; . . . if we destroy or . . . stand_by while others destroy historical America -- knock it down , pave it over , blot it out -- in the name of so-called progress and corporate profits ? &quot; McCullough is one of a pantheon of historians and writers who have formed Protect Historic America to fight a theme park about American history that the Walt Disney Co . wants to build four miles from Manassas . The park , said to be the largest private construction project ever in Virginia , has the support of Gov . George F . Allen . Disney ' s controversial proposal has focused new attention on the future of Civil War sites , transforming a local zoning flap into a national issue . Disney opponents say they fear that the theme park and the development it would bring would result in Manassas being boxed_in by towering modern buildings and bisected by traffic-clogged commuter roads . As with many of America ' s other most important Civil War sites , the threat to Manassas is external , not internal . I-66 skirts the battlefield , carrying a stream of bumper-to-bumper northern Virginia commuters in and out of Washington . Two heavily traveled state roads traverse the national_park , and a mile away a strip of fast-food chains and gas_stations inches ever closer to Bull_Run Creek , where 25 # 000 Americans were killed or wounded in the two battles fought at Manassas . To the south and west , county supervisors have zoned 77 million square_feet for commercial development . &quot; There ' s no doubt development is coming , &quot; said Kenneth Apschnikat , the National_Park_Service ' s Manassas superintendent . &quot; Our basic concern is that the integrity of the view from within the park is maintained , that you don ' t stand on this sacred ground looking_out at office_buildings . We ' re not asking_for the moon . All we ' re saying to the developers is : ' Keep your buildings low so they don ' t infringe on the battlefield. ' &quot; Efforts to save the nation ' s battlefields are as old as the Civil War itself , dating_back to 1863 , when citizens began buying and preserving farmland on which the Gettysburg battle had been fought . In later years Civil War survivors were instrumental in persuading a Congress dominated by veterans to provide funds to turn Chickamauga , Chattanooga , Shiloh , Antietam , Vicksburg and Gettysburg into national military parks . * &quot; Generations that we know not , heart-drawn to see where and by whom great things were suffered and done for them , shall come_to this deathless field , to ponder and dream , &quot; said U.S. Gen . Joshua Chamberlain at Gettysburg in 1889 . Chamberlain won the Medal_of_Honor for his heroics at Little Big Top , a key moment in the Gettysburg battle . Although the parks have always been big attractions , it is only in the last decade that the Civil War has crossed the threshold from being a subject pursued by academics and a handful of aficionados to one of broad popular fascination . By some estimates no fewer than 50 # 000 Civil War-related publications have been written in the past 25 years , and 38 million Americans watched the premiere of Ken Burns ' television documentary , &quot; The Civil War , &quot; in 1990 . More_than 100 citizens groups across the country are involved in efforts to save Civil War battlefields . Next year a Civil War memorial coin will be minted , with its expected proceeds of $ 5 million to $ 21 million earmarked to purchase battlefield sites threatened by development . ( One hundred parcels_of_land within the national Gettysburg battlefield are , for instance , still privately owned. ) &quot; Why there ' s so_much interest in the Civil War these days is anybody ' s guess , &quot; said James McPherson , whose book , &quot; Battle_Cry of Freedom , &quot; was a surprise bestseller in 1988 and the winner of the Pulitzer Prize . &quot; Part of the explanation , I think , is that we ' re seeing a kind of bounce-back from the disinterest in anything military during the Vietnam era . Since the ' 80s , there ' s been a great growth in the interest in the Vietnam_War and in our commitment to the vets , and the Civil War seems to be part of that revival. &quot; No one , of course , favors not saving the battlefields but , like the spotted owl controversy in the Pacific Northwest , the question in the heavily populated mid-Atlantic states is one of priorities and balances : How does a county preserve what is precious while at_the_same_time encouraging sensible development that provides jobs and increased taxes ? ' I get very resentful on this because there ' s no chance of being a moderate , &quot; said Bill Chase , a Culpeper ( Va. ) County supervisor . &quot; Either you want to save it all or you ' re perceived as a pro-growth fanatic who wants to pave everything over. &quot; Chase is a farmer , West_Point graduate and two-tour Vietnam_War veteran who remembers sitting on his great-grandfather ' s knee and hearing the old_man tell of fighting at Gettysburg . But when he recently joined the majority of the Culpeper supervisors in a 5-2 vote that would permit the construction of a Formula One racetrack near Brandy Station , on the site of the largest cavalry battle of the Civil War , his best_friend stopped speaking_to him and he received accusatory letters from as far away as California . * &quot; I wish we could keep the county unchanged forever , but you can ' t save everything and Brandy Station was not a particularly significant battle , &quot; Chase said . &quot; To me the whole_thing boiled_down to a property-rights issue . As long as an owner doesn ' t destroy the health or the welfare of his neighbor , he ought to have the right to decide how his land will be used. &quot; The farmland around Brandy Station was zoned for development 30 years ago and county supervisors did not encounter any public outcry when a small airport was built_on it in 1969 , followed by an industrial_park in the early 1980s . But a California developer started buying_up the land in 1989 with the intent of building a residential and commercial community and , after he went_into bankruptcy , a Maryland developer announced plans for the racetrack . Preservationists howled and made a $ 5-million bid for the land . If the bankruptcy court rejects the bid as inadequate , construction of the track is expected to proceed . After the Civil War , Confederate Gen . Robert E . Lee returned to Brandy Station . Looking_out_on the rolling farmlands , he said : &quot; The country here looks very green and pretty not withstanding the ravages of war . What a beautiful world God in His loving kindness to His creatures has given us . What a shame that men endowed with the reason and knowledge of right should mar His gifts. &quot; Annie Snyder , 72 , of Gainesville , Va. , knows Lee ' s words by heart and has spent the last 10 years fighting plans to develop Manassas and Brandy Station . Her generation , she recalled , never dreamed the battlefields one day would be threatened . &quot; It was just farmland , &quot; she said . &quot; We thought it would be here forever. &quot; The wife of a retired airline pilot , Snyder was instrumental in putting_together 110 groups to defeat the planned shopping_mall on the Manassas battlefield . &quot; I was thrilled when they came_up with the term ' citizen activist , ' &quot; she said , &quot; because I used to be known as a pain in the ass. &quot; Had the mall been built , she said , the family ' s nearby 180-acre farm could have been sold for $ 10 million . ( Its appraised value is $ 735 # 000. ) &quot; My husband is fond of reminding me now about that , &quot; she said . &quot; He ' ll say : ' Annie , we could have left an awful good inheritance for our children. ' And I ' ll say : ' Well , true , but I feel_like we ' re leaving an awfully good one for our grandchildren. ' &quot;</TEXT>
