   <HEADLINE> LEBANON BREAKS TIES WITH IRAQ OVER KILLING OF DISSIDENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lebanon severed diplomatic relations with Iraq on Monday and ordered Baghdad ' s mission in the Lebanese capital to leave within 72 hours . The decision followed Iraq ' s refusal to waive the diplomatic immunity of two embassy diplomats allegedly involved in the assassination of a prominent Iraqi dissident in Beirut last week . Lebanon rejects any infringement on its sovereignty , security and stability as well as the violation of diplomatic rules , Information Minister Michel Samaha said after a three-hour special_session of the Lebanese Cabinet on Monday night . The two Iraqis have been held_in solitary confinement since Lebanese security_forces apprehended them last Wednesday . Samaha said the two have admitted killing Sheik Taleb Ali Suheil , 64 , on direct orders from the Iraqi intelligence department in Baghdad . Despite official Iraqi denials of any involvement on their part and the demand for the men ' s release , the press speculated Monday that prosecutors will proceed with the case against Mohammed Kazem Faris , 37 , the Iraqi Embassy cultural_attache , and Khaled Alwan Khalaf 34 , the Iraqi commercial attache . Lebanese authorities say the murder weapon , a silencer-equipped pistol , was found in the diplomats ' car when they were arrested by Lebanese police in front of the Iraqi Embassy compound shortly after the crime . Authorities here also want to interrogate Iraqi Consul Ali Sultan Darwish , thought to be the chief intelligence_officer at the embassy , on suspicion of masterminding the assassination . A Lebanese employee at the embassy , George Teredjian , was formally charged Friday with complicity in Suheil ' s killing and is also being held . Possible repercussions were hinted at Saturday by Awad Fakhri , the Iraqi charge d ' affaires at the Beirut embassy . He noted that 12 # 000 Lebanese live and work in Iraq and that they are treated like brothers . Every country should think_of its interests , Fakhri added . In spite of this consideration , editorials in Monday ' s newspapers argued for severing ties with the government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein .</TEXT>
