   <HEADLINE> ART ; LOVE , DEATH AND REBIRTH ; TITIAN ' S ' VENUS AND ADONIS , ' THE GETTY MUSEUM ' S LATEST ADDITION , IS A STORY OF AN OBJECT OF NEGLECT THAT BECAME AN OBJECT OF DESIRE , AND HOW ITS SUITORS BROUGHT THE AILING 400-YEAR-OLD CANVAS BACK TO PASSIONATE LIFE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two things about Titian are widely known : He was the greatest painter in Venice in the 16th Century , when the city rose to its pinnacle of artistic achievement . You can ' t buy a major work by him , even if you can afford it , because they are all owned by museums . But in 1991 , when a soiled painting of &quot; Venus and Adonis &quot; was hauled down from its obscure position in an English country_house and put_up for auction at Christie ' s in London , conventional wisdom on the second count had to be revised . Clumsily restored and darkened , the painting had been installed high above eye level in the home of the second Earl of Normanton , where scholars had long squinted at it and , for the most part , dismissed it as the work of Titian ' s assistants . When they finally got a close look , however , most agreed that &quot; Venus and Adonis &quot; was no mere workshop picture . It was essentially the work of the master himself . Excitement grew when George Goldner , then curator of paintings and drawings for the J . Paul Getty Museum , indicated an interest in the picture . When he summoned Getty conservator Andrea Rothe to inspect the painting ' s condition , the word was out : The Getty would go_for the Titian . As it turned_out , the Getty did not buy the painting at Christie ' s auction on Dec . 13 , 1991 . A partnership of dealers -- Hazlitt , Gooden &amp; Fox of London and Herman Shickman of New York -- snagged it at $ 13.47 million , a record sum for a Titian and nearly twice the painting ' s estimated selling price of $ 7.2 million . The dealers claimed that they had purchased the picture as an investment , but the Getty soon arranged to buy_it from them at an undisclosed price , contingent upon receiving an export license from British authorities . The license was granted about four months later , and in due time the Getty announced the purchase . Now -- after a year and a half of treatment and study in the museum ' s conservation laboratory -- &quot; Venus and Adonis &quot; is scheduled to go_on view on Tuesday at the museum in Malibu . &quot; We don ' t expect to make an acquisition like this very often . It ' s too late in the game , &quot; Getty Museum Director John Walsh said of the spectacular new addition . Indeed , landing a major work by one of the Western world ' s supreme painters is something of a miracle , said Goldner , who left the Getty in July to head the drawings and prints departments at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York . The best the Getty might have hoped for was a minor example , but the museum now claims one of a very few significant Titians in U.S. museums , second only to &quot; Rape of Europa &quot; at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston , he said . Philip Conisbee , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art ' s former curator of European paintings and sculpture , also lauded the purchase . &quot; I think it is the boldest and best acquisition the Getty has made in European paintings . . . . I would certainly have bought_it for the county if I had the means , &quot; said Conisbee , who left LACMA in the fall to become curator of French paintings at the National Gallery of Art in Washington . * Fortunately for the Getty , such miracles do happen . &quot; We didn ' t expect to get the Pontormo either , &quot; Walsh said of the Italian Mannerist ' s &quot; Portrait of Cosimo I de ' Medici , &quot; which had been_on long-term loan to the Frick Collection for many years before the Getty bought_it for $ 35.2 million in a 1989 auction . The Titian joins the Pontormo and Andrea Mantegna ' s &quot; Adoration of the Magi &quot; in a select group of the Getty ' s greatest purchases , Walsh said . &quot; Venus and Adonis &quot; will be the centerpiece of a &quot; great little group of Venetian pictures , &quot; he said , referring to such paintings as Vittore Carpaccio ' s &quot; Hunting on the Lagoon , &quot; Dosso Dossi ' s &quot; Mythological Scene &quot; and &quot; An Allegory of Fortune , &quot; Sebastiano del Piombo ' s &quot; Portrait of Pope Clement VII &quot; and Paolo Veronese ' s &quot; Portrait of a Man. &quot; The High Italian Renaissance is &quot; practically a mined-out vein , &quot; Walsh said , but the museum has had surprising success in that area . &quot; Venus and Adonis , &quot; which measures about 5 by 6 1 / 2 feet , was created circa 1555-1560 . Based on a mythological scene in Ovid ' s &quot; Metamorphoses , &quot; the painting portrays a nude , voluptuous Venus attempting to restrain her lover from going_off to hunt because she fears he will be killed . &quot; Be brave against timorous creatures , but against bold creatures boldness is not safe , &quot; she warns in the literature . But Adonis declines her invitation to stay with her under a shady poplar_tree and goes_off to his death . The painting is likely to win the hearts of the public both for its subject_matter and expressive_style , Walsh said . &quot; Like many works by Titian , this one really tells a story , &quot; he said . &quot; In this case , the story is about love and death , and you can see that across the room . You can see Venus trying to hold_back this impetuous kid and that he and the dogs are going_off to hunt . &quot; Everyone knew the story in Titian ' s time , and once you know that Adonis was going_off to get gored to death by a wild_boar , and that for days and days Venus had been sleeping_with him , and trying to persuade him not to do this , you realize what the story is . It ' s brains against testosterone , I suppose , but also the pull of action and sensuality , adventure and common_sense . It ' s a story that ' s part of everyone ' s life . &quot; So that ' s part of the appeal -- a story we understand , &quot; Walsh said . &quot; The other half is . . . a cast of characters -- a beautiful Venus , an Adonis whose face shows a combination of pity and arrogance . It ' s all painted very solidly , so you believe_in the characters . . . but softly and very expressively , and within a landscape that ' s full of movement , which tells you something very big is going_on . . . . It ' s a universal story but quite particular in the warm , sympathetic way it is handled. &quot; * The story and its style of delivery are easier to appreciate now that the painting has been cleaned and restored by Rothe , the Getty ' s conservator in_charge of paintings conservation . To the untrained eye , however , differences in the work ' s &quot; before &quot; and &quot; after &quot; appearance are not dramatic . There were no gaping holes to be patched , as has been the case in some of the laboratory ' s projects . &quot; The major problem was pinch marks due_to the fact that the painting had been rolled_up at a certain time in history , &quot; Rothe said , in an interview at the museum ' s conservation laboratory . Although the exact circumstances and date of the damage are unknown , ultraviolet photographs taken by the Getty have revealed parallel lines of stress running horizontally across the canvas . Only minor spots of pigment had actually flaked_off , but &quot; outrageous masses of color were used to retouch the relatively small losses , &quot; he said . Awkward restorations done 20 or 30 years ago in London and much earlier in Italy masked sections of the original painting and disguised the underlying condition , he said . Titian sometimes built_up as_many as 30 layers of thin glazes on his paintings , and these delicate glazes are frequently damaged or destroyed by overzealous cleaning , Rothe said . Failing to understand the extent to which unstable colors darken and glazes become more transparent , restorers sometimes think they can get_back to brighter colors if they remove varnish . The danger is that they may actually remove Titian ' s glazes , he said , &quot; and if cleaning is too harsh , there is nothing much you can do ( to save a painting ) . &quot; Listening to Rothe ' s account of a typical Titian dilemma , Dawson Carr , the Getty ' s associate curator of paintings , said : &quot; that ' s why Titians often look so raw and they lack a sense of modeled form and subtlety . So when Andrea started finding glazes on ' Venus and Adonis ' we were elated. &quot; Although some of Titian ' s work had been painted over in &quot; Venus and Adonis , &quot; it hadn ' t been destroyed . As Rothe worked -- proceeding through a four-step cleaning process of using progressively stronger solvents in increasingly selective areas -- he revealed many subtleties , including a dimple on Venus ' back . Where losses of the original paint were disruptive to the eye , he filled them . In keeping with standard practice , all_of the new conservation work is fully reversible . * Titian ' s popularity has made the artist ' s work particularly vulnerable to damage , so some observers feared that &quot; Venus and Adonis &quot; might not be salvageable . But after examining it in London , Rothe disagreed . &quot; I felt the condition hadn ' t compromised the painting so far that you couldn ' t retrieve it again , &quot; he said . Recalling his excitement when Goldner called and confided , &quot; I think we have a real one , &quot; Rothe said he was suffering from influenza at the time , but he dragged himself out of bed and onto a plane for London . &quot; I felt absolutely revived after I saw it , &quot; he said . &quot; I could recognize what the problems were. &quot; The painting is not as_good_as new , however . As the work has aged , greens in the landscape have turned brown , for example , and that process cannot be reversed , but Rothe ' s faith in the picture appears to have been rewarded . &quot; I think Andrea Rothe has done a wonderful job , &quot; said National Gallery curator Conisbee , who watched the painting emerge from layers of dirt and varnish during periodic visits to the Getty . &quot; He revealed fresh color and rich passages of impasto and created a greater sense of space in the painting. &quot; &quot; Venus and Adonis &quot; is the work of an immensely successful artist who was named Tiziano Vecellio and became known as Titian . He was born between 1480 and 1490 and died of the plague in 1576 . Titian was trained in Giovanni Bellini ' s workshop in Venice , worked as assistant to Giorgione and in the late 1520s became the leading painter in Venice . As his fame spread throughout Italy and beyond , his clients included Holy_Roman_Emperor Charles V and Pope Paul III . Titian created several versions of &quot; Venus and Adonis , &quot; others of which can be found at the National Gallery in London , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York , the National Gallery in Washington and the Prado Museum in Madrid . At some point in the future , Walsh hopes to assemble all these works_at the Getty for public exhibition and scholarly study . The prototype for the Getty ' s Titian is the Prado ' s more classical , restrained treatment of &quot; Venus and Adonis , &quot; which was commissioned in the 1550s by Philip II of Spain . Nothing is known of circumstances surrounding the commission of the Getty ' s Titian , but the painting has been in distinguished collections , including that of Queen Christina of Sweden . &quot; Given who had owned it , we should have known that it might very well be a better version than people supposed , &quot; Walsh said . * The Getty ' s &quot; Venus and Adonis &quot; remains a topic of debate , however , with scholars disagreeing on exactly how much help Titian might have had with various parts of the painting . &quot; There is always discussion and speculation about who did what in paintings that were created in large workshops of successful artists , &quot; Walsh said . &quot; Titian was in_demand by everybody , &quot; he noted , and works created in his studio ranged from those done with minimal assistance to those he merely authorized . &quot; We care very much that Titian ' s hand ( is strongly in_evidence in our painting ) , and we think it is there for the eye to see , &quot; Walsh said . &quot; But we care more about the quality of the painting and its effectiveness , the importance of the subject and the state of conservation than the more arcane questions of whether an assistant painted this or that bit of drapery . The great thing is that now the painting is out where it can be seen. &quot;</TEXT>
