   <HEADLINE> HIGH_COURT LETS ENGLISH-ONLY JOB RULES STAND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for employers to enforce English-only rules for their bilingual workers . By a 7-2 vote , the justices refused to hear an appeal of a ruling in a San Francisco case that said requiring workers to speak English on_the_job does not violate federal anti-discrimination laws . Two weeks ago , lawyers for the Clinton_Administration had urged the high_court to reverse that decision , calling it &quot; an issue of great national importance to national origin minorities. &quot; Since 1970 , the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has told companies that they may_not enforce English-only rules , except in the rare case where it was judged to be a &quot; business necessity. &quot; But last year , the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals threw_out that guideline . It concluded that where workers can speak both English and Spanish , requiring them to converse only in English at_work may be an &quot; inconvenience for some &quot; but it &quot; does not impose a burden significant enough to amount to the denial of equal opportunity. &quot; The appeals court referred only to bilingual workers . It would amount to discrimination , the court indicated , to impose an English-only requirement on employees who could not speak English . Meanwhile , the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether states can impose term limits on their members of Congress . In the past , the court has allowed states to set term limits for the members of state legislatures . But some lower courts have ruled that the Constitution does not allow_for such limits on members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives . Increasing numbers of employers have sought to enforce rules requiring their workers to speak English , partly to improve communication on_the_job but also to reduce friction among workers . The owner of the San Francisco meat-processing plant whose case reached the high_court said that he imposed the English-only rule after other workers complained that two Latino employees were insulting them in Spanish . After the high_court ' s action Monday , English-only workplace rules are legal as a matter of federal law in California and in the eight other West Coast states . The law is less clear elsewhere . Since the court did not issue a formal ruling , its decision is not binding outside the region of the 9th Circuit . EEOC attorney Jennifer S . Goldstein said , however , that her agency will continue to adhere to its guideline that frowns_on English-only requirements . &quot; We think ( the guideline ) is still correct . We view this as a matter of discrimination , &quot; she said . The commission said it has 120 cases before it in which the agency is fighting English-only rules . If EEOC lawyers can win a ruling in another appeals court that rejects an employer ' s English-only policy , the high_court may be called_on to revisit the issue later . The legal dispute arises from an interpretation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . That law makes_it illegal for employers &quot; to discriminate against any individual with_respect_to his compensation , terms , conditions or privileges of employment because of such individual ' s race , color , religion , sex or national origin. &quot; In its 1970 guideline , the EEOC said that an English-only rule discriminated against &quot; national origin minority employees &quot; because it took_away a &quot; condition or privilege of employment enjoyed by other employees : the right to converse in a familiar language with which they are most comfortable. &quot; Administration lawyers noted that this legal interpretation has been followed consistently since then in the lower courts and has won the implicit endorsement of Congress . But recently , the Supreme Court and some conservative lower courts have rejected longstanding liberal interpretations of federal civil_rights laws . In its 2-1 ruling last year , the 9th Circuit Court judges said that &quot; nothing in the plain language of the ( 1964 ) law supports EEOC ' s English-only rule. &quot; The case that reached the high_court began in 1990 at a small meat-packing plant in South San Francisco . Kenneth Bertelson , the company president , had received complaints from a black and an Asian who said they had overheard racist insults spoken in Spanish by two Latino workers . In response , Bertelson issued a new rule : &quot; Only English will be spoken in connection with work . During lunch , breaks and employees ' own time , they are obviously free to speak Spanish if they wish. &quot; Priscilla Garcia , who had worked_on the assembly_line for 19 years , filed a suit contending that the new rule violated federal civil_rights laws . Initially , a federal judge in San Francisco declared the rule illegal . However , last July , the 9th Circuit Court not only upheld the company ' s rule but threw_out the longstanding EEOC policy . The justices ' vote left intact the decision in the case ( Garcia vs . Spun Steak Co. , 93-1222 ) . Dissenting were Justices Harry A . Blackmun and Sandra Day O ' Connor . The term-limits case tests a popular reform that has swept_through 15 states , including California , since 1990 . But there has remained considerable doubt whether the Constitution allows the states to impose new restrictions on who can be elected to the House and Senate . A new Arkansas law would limit U.S. senators to two six-year terms , while members of the House would be limited to three two-year terms . But earlier this year , the Arkansas Supreme Court declared those limits unconstitutional . The high_court will hear the case ( U.S. Term Limits vs . Thornton , 93-1456 ) , during the fall and issue a ruling next year . In other actions , the court : * Made_it harder for some coal_miners and longshoremen or their heirs to collect benefits for their disability or deaths . In deciding claims involving these workers where the evidence is equally balanced , the Labor_Department has tilted toward the workers . But in a 6-3 vote ( Director of OWCP vs . Greenwich Collieries , 93-744 ) , the justices rejected this policy as a matter of federal law and said that workers must prove their cases . * Ruled that the federal law protecting airline and railway workers does not prevent them from suing under state law if they are wrongfully fired . The 9-0 ruling in the case ( Hawaiian Airlines vs . Norris , 92-2058 ) , clears the way for a suit filed by an airline mechanic who contended that he was fired for refusing to cover_up the fact that a plane was not ready to fly . The company had contended that the case had to go_to arbitration . * Refused to hear an appeal from the first man sentenced to death under the new federal law aimed at drug kingpins ( Chandler vs . United States , 93-1033 ) . In 1991 , David R . Chandler , who ran a marijuana-selling ring , was convicted of paying $ 500 for the murder of a potential informer . He was sentenced to death under a 1988 federal law . Six others have since received federal death sentences . Since 1962 , no person has been executed under federal law . * COURT SAYS NO DICE : Indian casinos lose bid to use a video gaming machine . A3 * BETTER BUSINESS : Companies find benefits in employing workers who speak two or more languages . D1</TEXT>
