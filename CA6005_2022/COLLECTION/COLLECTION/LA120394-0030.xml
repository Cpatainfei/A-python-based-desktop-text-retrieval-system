   <HEADLINE> CLINTON BANS FUNDING FOR EMBRYO CREATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a highly unusual move , President Clinton injected himself into the scientific process Friday night by announcing that his Administration would prohibit the use of federal money to create human embryos solely for research purposes . &quot; I do not believe that federal funds should be used to support the creation of human embryos for research purposes , &quot; Clinton said , &quot; and I have directed that NIH not allocate any resources for such research. &quot; The ban applies only to the most controversial question involved in_embryo research : Whether to allow the creation of such embryos for research purposes only . Notably , his action did not address the larger question of the use of federal money for any human embryo research , leaving the door open for possible government approval of wide-scale research on the thousands of already existing and unused embryos now in storage as a result of in-vitro fertilization . Nevertheless , his decision -- coming_on the same day that a federal advisory panel to the National Institutes of Health recommended permitting the creation of research embryos under some circumstances -- almost certainly will send a disturbing message to a research community that has grown increasingly troubled in recent years over what it views_as political intrusion into the scientific process . Research on embryos has generated growing ethical concerns because it deals with creating and manipulating human life . Many scientists believe that studying the human embryo , which after one week of growth constitutes a cluster of cells no bigger than the period at the end of this sentence , could yield infinite knowledge about some of nature ' s worst medical scourges , including genetic_diseases , infertility and cancer . But the work has been condemned by abortion foes and others who view it as the destruction of human life , and have vowed to fight any efforts to conduct such research . In many ways , the Clinton ruling was reminiscent_of the moratorium during the Ronald Reagan and George_Bush administrations on research using human fetal tissue , which met with similar opposition . Paradoxically , Clinton lifted that ban with great fanfare in 1993 during his first few days in office . Researchers also have been critical of the growing involvement of Congress and other federal_officials in pursuing their own investigations into questions of scientific fraud and abuse . At least one member of the NIH advisory panel , Patricia King , a law professor at Georgetown University who served as the committee ' s co-chair , bluntly dismissed Clinton ' s action as having more to do with &quot; politics &quot; than the &quot; merits of embryo research. &quot; The action marked the second apparent concession Clinton has made to conservatives since the Nov . 8 election . On Thursday , Clinton unveiled plans to increase defense spending , in part to head_off a GOP push . But the White_House denied that the decision was influenced by the election results . &quot; The election had nothing to do with this decision , &quot; White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Friday after the announcement . &quot; The President simply believes this ( funding ) is not right. &quot; The advisory panel , which presented its findings to NIH Director Harold E . Varmus earlier Friday , endorsed human embryo research generally , but proposed only two specific circumstances under which embryos could be created for research reasons : &quot; when the research by its very nature cannot otherwise be validly conducted , &quot; and when a &quot; compelling &quot; case can be made that it is necessary &quot; for the validity of a study that is potentially of outstanding scientific and therapeutic value. &quot; Varmus was expected to study the panel ' s findings and decide soon whether to accept them . Clinton ' s action , in_effect , circumvented that process . Varmus could not be reached for comment Friday . NIH sources , however , indicating they were taken completely by surprise by the White_House action , said it took several hours to sort through and understand exactly what the directive meant . The sources said they concluded that &quot; it probably should be narrowly interpreted , &quot; meaning that the NIH would likely still consider &quot; all_the other avenues of important research &quot; not addressed by Clinton ' s decision . The panel , in endorsing the field of human embryo research , said it holds significant promise for medical advances , but proposed a strict framework for its conduct . The recommendations apply only to research conducted on human embryos that are created outside the uterus , that is , embryos produced in a laboratory by mixing sperm and egg . The panel said that research should be limited &quot; to the shortest time possible. &quot;</TEXT>
