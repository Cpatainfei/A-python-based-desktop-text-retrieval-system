   <TEXT> Kimberly Belshe strides through the day-care center in Irvine and spots a group of tots munching on raisins . &quot; that ' s good ! &quot; praises the tall woman in the red blazer as she wags a finger , mommy-style . &quot; Eat your five a day. &quot; &quot; Five a day &quot; is the state ' s campaign to encourage Californians , big and small , to eat_at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day . And while the 3-year-olds don ' t give a raisin that this advice comes from the director of the state_Department of Health Services herself , something about Belshe ' s manner causes them to turn and peer quizzically at her . Later this day , at the Sporting Club in Irvine , she presides amiably over a group of older schoolchildren who are building the world ' s largest salad as part of an American Cancer Society event on healthy eating . The new director of the DHS has a way of getting people ' s attention , no matter what their age -- although with adults , Belshe has had to put_up with some back talk . Since Gov . Pete Wilson appointed the 34-year-old to direct the DHS in November , Belshe has had to defend herself repeatedly against a firestorm of criticism questioning her position on the state ' s anti-smoking campaign and her job qualifications -- she is not a physician . Formerly the deputy secretary of the Health and Welfare Agency , Belshe ( pronounced Bel-SHAY ) is known in Sacramento as a straightforward and smoothly professional administrator . But she has kept a low profile in her first six months on_the_job , either because of her massive workload as chief of the 5 # 000-employee department or the opposition her appointment triggered . Now , with her recent Senate confirmation , Belshe is ready to talk_about her agenda -- and the item on her resume that threatened to derail her nomination . While at the San Francisco public relations firm Ogilvy and Mather six years ago , Belshe helped the tobacco_industry oppose Proposition 99 , the landmark 1988 anti-smoking initiative that increased the tax on cigarettes . This little factoid floored observers when it came_to_light in November and led some health leaders to charge that Belshe would be unable to reconcile her past position with her current duty to lead Californians to better health . During a lengthy interview , Belshe does not shy_away_from addressing this paradox . She even sighs with some relief : &quot; It ' s so nice to actually be asked that question. &quot; Her critics , she says , have not bothered to give her the opportunity to explain . * It ' s like this , Belshe says : She worked_at Ogilvy and Mather for only a_few months after finishing grad school . She wasn ' t working directly for the tobacco_industry , but in a lobbyist role for a coalition , including the Republican_Party and the California Taxpayers Union , which opposed Proposition 99 . She is a nonsmoker who dislikes smoking and thinks that it ' s bad for your health . But she viewed Proposition 99 as a tax initiative , not a health initiative . She says her thinking about Proposition 99 has evolved considerably since 1988 , and she now praises the initiative . She is not , she states emphatically , a tobacco-industry sympathizer who is insincere about her public health agenda . &quot; What I say to folks when this issue comes_up -- and it ' s rarely acknowledged -- is I would hope that my commitment to educating the public about the adverse consequences of smoking . . . be judged not on a three-month stint working for a public affairs firm but be based upon my demonstrated record while in positions of authority over the course of the past 3 1 / 2 years. &quot; Belshe is angered that her sincerity is questioned even now . &quot; My critics point_out that it is just unconscionable that I could have done public affairs work opposing the tax initiative , &quot; she says . &quot; That inference I find extremely disconcerting because it ' s really questioning my integrity , when if anything , I think I have demonstrated over the last three years ( as deputy secretary ) that I am someone with a lot of honesty and openness. &quot; Proposition 99 , which taxes cigarettes to raise money for anti-smoking education programs and media campaigns , is recognized by many as one of the most ambitious , innovative and successful public health campaigns in the nation . It is credited with reducing the number of adult smokers in the state by 28 % . Recently , however , a debate has arisen about how to spend the Proposition 99 revenues ( which usually amount to about $ 700 # 000 yearly ) under a reauthorization the bill . Anti-smoking proponents charge that the Wilson Administration wants to divert a significant share of the funds to other health programs instead of anti-smoking programs and that Belshe -- again under_fire -- supports this . Says Mark Pertschuk , co-director of the Berkeley-based nonprofit group Americans for Nonsmokers Rights : &quot; There are two things we would have wanted from Belshe . The first is a clear , public statement that ( her 1988 opposition to Proposition 99 ) was a mistake . And the second is an opposition to the diversion of funds from Prop . 99 , which she has supported . We consider that a violation of the voters ' will and an extremely bad public health policy. &quot; Other anti-smoking leaders say they believe that Belshe will support whatever Wilson wants , even if it is not in the best interest of public health goals . &quot; Belshe may be privately committed ( to anti-smoking efforts ) , but I don ' t feel this Administration is , &quot; says Carolyn Martin , an American Lung Assn . volunteer and vice_chairman of the Tobacco Education Oversight Committee , which reports to the Legislature on anti-smoking programs . &quot; This Administration has procured a budget that decimates the smoking education program . This is the premiere prevention program in the United States , and we are_on the brink of extinction . We need strong , courageous leadership , and whether ( Belshe ) has the courage to publicly question some of Wilson ' s decisions , I can ' t tell you. &quot; * The controversy thrusts Belshe into a debate on how important anti-smoking programs are in comparison to the other state health programs competing for funding , such_as immunization , control of tuberculosis , school-based health programs , HIV prevention and treatment , sexually transmitted diseases , violence and health screening for low-income children . Belshe says these are all high-priority programs and she supports Wilson ' s proposal to share the Proposition 99 funds . &quot; Arguably , all_of the programs funded by ( Proposition 99 ) moneys are being used in a manner consistent . . . with the initiative overall , &quot; she says . &quot; What this whole debate boils_down to , from our perspective , is a very very difficult decision we have to make in terms of balancing competing public health priorities. &quot; But it ' s in this difficult context that friends and colleagues say Belshe shines . She is known as someone who can bring opposing factions together in pursuit of a compromise . And she has a reputation for her ability to make hard choices while withstanding the heat . &quot; She listens very closely to both opposing and supporting arguments about policy decisions , &quot; says her good friend and former colleague Kassy Edgington Perry , now with Greenbaum Public Relations in Sacramento . &quot; She is not an ideologue in a sense that ' this is the conservative way to do this. ' Yet at_the_same_time , she is very tough about what she believes in. &quot; Belshe ' s smooth passage through her confirmation_hearings reflects the respect lawmakers have for her administrative abilities , says Assemblyman Phil Isenberg ( D-Sacramento ) . Belshe &quot; understands policy implications intuitively . And she is not a bureaucrat , &quot; Isenberg says . &quot; That does not mean I agree with everything she does . But she does not come_up with reams of paper and a cadre of excuses in_order to say , ' Nothing can be done. ' And in government , believe me , that ' s rare. &quot; Belshe also comes_across as fun-loving and good-natured . A fifth-generation San Franciscan , she is an athlete who loves tennis , golf and workouts at the gym . &quot; I think it ' s important for the health director to set a good_example , &quot; she says . She is single , and although she puts_in long hours -- at a salary of $ 95 # 052 -- she argues that she is not , by nature , a workaholic . &quot; If I continue to work these hours , I will probably always be single , &quot; she says with a laugh . &quot; People say , ' How do you like your job ? ' I say , ' I love my job . I hate my personal life. ' &quot; * Belshe was attracted to politics early on , majoring in government as a Harvard undergraduate . She became interested in health_care economic issues while pursuing her master ' s in public administration at Princeton . A thin woman with a no-nonsense short haircut and soft brown eyes , Belshe says she must rely heavily on the physicians in her department for guidance on some issues . Most DHS directors -- such_as her predecessor , Molly Joel Coye -- were medical doctors . ( Coye resigned to take a job in the private sector ) . But Belshe contends that some of the biggest decisions for the department today are fiscal ones . The Proposition 99 funding controversy is typical of the hard choices that must be made by the state ' s leaders in an era of shrinking budgets and fiscal crisis , she says . &quot; That truly has been the biggest challenge : How do you structure innovative and creative and compassionate solutions to what are clearly some very , very compelling problems in the health_care arena at_the_same_time you are enacting millions and millions and millions of dollars in reductions ? It hasn ' t been easy. &quot; Belshe has made health_care reform a top priority , continuing Coye ' s work to restructure MediCal into a more cost-effective , managed-care plan . She also emphasizes prevention , such_as immunization programs and an ambitious program to reduce teen pregnancies , Education Now and Babies Later . Finally , Belshe says , the state has worked diligently to thwart a resurgence of tuberculosis . Yet , she differs from many public health leaders when it comes_to spending_money on undocumented immigrants , taking the hard line that the federal_government -- and not the state -- is responsible_for health_care of undocumented people . For example , the state recently cut a program to provide prenatal care to undocumented women . Except for emergency care and efforts to limit the spread of communicable_disease , Belshe says undocumented immigrants should be denied services from the state . &quot; The bottom_line ? Tough budget times , tough choices , &quot; she says .</TEXT>
