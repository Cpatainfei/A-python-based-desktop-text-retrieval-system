   <TEXT> I am astonished that The Times would publish a letter as racist as Rosemary C . Watson ' s bizarre and slanted vision of white males as &quot; natural born killers &quot; ( Sept . 4 ) . To suppose that anyone is more or less prone to vicious behavior by nature of their race requires a &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; -like innocence , or self-imposed ignorance . Recent massacres in Rwanda and Somalia clearly demonstrate that not all blacks live_in harmony outside the influence of the American media . Similar acts of aggression in Asia , the Middle_East , the former Yugoslavia and Northern_Ireland suggest that all races are equally capable of horrific bloodshed . Ultimately , individuals of all races decide for themselves whether to practice tolerance or violence . I , for one , will not surrender my individuality to any supposed influence of media or ancestry . RUSSELL FRAZIER Glendale * How dare Calendar print Watson ' s racist letter . Calendar would never print a letter that contained such a vicious libel of black_men . PATRICK CURREN Santa Monica * Watson should be more concerned with young black males seeing Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur as heroes , rather than worrying that they are being brainwashed into believing Billy the Kid is a figure to be admired . TOM TISDALE Fullerton * I suggest that Watson look deep inside her emotions and examine the guilty pleasure she feels when she makes a generalized attack on a group she considers to be a convenient and easy target while maintaining a delicious sense of moral righteousness . If she does this , she will begin to understand the true nature of prejudice . If she harbors no such feelings , then I apologize to her for being wrong ; but I am no more wrong than she is in carelessly and erroneously labeling me as a &quot; natural born killer. &quot; DON TERLINDEN Long_Beach</TEXT>
