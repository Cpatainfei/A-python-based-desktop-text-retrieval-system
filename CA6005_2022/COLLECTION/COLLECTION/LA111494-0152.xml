   <HEADLINE> CLASH OF THE TITANS : 10 DAYS IN THE MUSIC WARS ; POP_MUSIC : THE WARNER MUSIC GROUP DISPUTE BETWEEN ROBERT J . MORGADO AND DOUG MORRIS THREATENED TO TEAR APART A LUCRATIVE , SUCCESSFUL OPERATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ahmet Ertegun , the legendary co-founder of Atlantic Records , leaves his Manhattan brownstone most weekdays just before noon for the 10-minute ride to his office at Time Warner headquarters in Rockefeller Plaza . Ertegun -- whose signings over the last 47 years range from Aretha Franklin to Led Zeppelin -- had a different destination in mind , however , when he slipped into the back seat of his chauffeured Mercedes sedan on the last Thursday in October . The goateed record titan directed his driver to an apartment_building overlooking Central_Park West , where seven colleagues , all top_executives in the Warner Music Group , were secretly meeting . With clouds gathering over Manhattan , they paced anxiously -- each grasping a cellular_phone -- awaiting the outcome of a showdown at Rockefeller Plaza between their boss , Doug Morris , and his boss , Warner Music Group Chairman Robert J . Morgado . The faceoff , which had all_the earmarks of an old Western shootout , was for control of the domestic division of the $ 5.4-billion Warner Music Group -- a Time Warner subsidiary whose chief assets include the Warner Bros. , Elektra and Atlantic labels . The executives in the apartment , all Morris allies , were prepared_for an unprecedented palace revolt that could paralyze the world ' s largest record company . They were ready to sacrifice their jobs in what would have been the most dramatic exodus ever in the record business . Already , top-selling Warner artists such_as R.E.M. and Neil Young were threatening to jump ship over the turmoil . The rebellion had even forced the involvement of Gerald Levin , chairman of a massive empire that includes Time magazine and the Warner Bros . movie studio . For three tense hours , Ertegun huddled with the team that recently had been established to guide the company into the 21st Century -- a firm whose artists , from Jimi Hendrix and the Doors to Madonna and Prince , have helped shape global pop culture for three decades . To those in the budding insurrection , Morgado and Morris represented vastly different agendas . Morgado symbolized a new breed of boss -- a &quot; corporate suit &quot; brought_in to impose strict business practices in an industry where success depends_on creative instinct . A former chief_of_staff to New York Gov . Hugh L . Carey , Morgado , 51 , has been described by colleagues during his 10-year tenure at Warner Music as a brilliant but insensitive strategist . Morris , 54 , was a music man -- an industry veteran and former songwriter who had been trained at Ertegun ' s side over the past two decades . The battle was being closely monitored at rival companies , where executives also were concerned about increasing corporate encroachment and their ability , if any , to fight it . At the same time , these competitors were practically salivating at the prospect of Warner Music crumbling apart . After an anxious morning in the Central_Park apartment , Ertegun and company returned to their offices at Rockefeller Plaza . Shortly before nightfall , they learned that the music men had won : Morgado had caved_in . Morris had full autonomy to run the labels . &quot; This isn ' t the first time in the history of the music business that executives have argued in the back_room , &quot; the 71-year-old Ertegun said last week . &quot; In moments of emotional outburst , people can say all kinds of silly things to each other that they wish they hadn ' t said afterward . The important thing is that the music division is now united and moving forward. &quot; In the days that followed , other Warner executives attempted to publicly downplay the incident . Morgado even joked about it in a speech to an industry gathering in Santa Monica , saying press accounts of the Warner tumult made &quot; Bosnia look_like Shangri-La. &quot; Privately , however , nearly a dozen senior Warner executives recounted the 10 days in which Warner Music came perilously close to imploding . * To the average fan , nothing matters but the music -- the next album by their favorite artists . But the record industry , which was pioneered by free-spirited individuals who followed their instincts and passions , has become a corporate battlefield where all that matters is power . Robert Morgado exercised his power in July , infuriating top officials by promoting Doug Morris , formerly head of the Atlantic Group , to run Warner ' s American music division . Rather than report to Morris , who some viewed_as Morgado ' s pawn , two legendary industry figures stepped_down -- Mo Ostin , chairman of Warner Bros . Records , and Robert Krasnow , chief of Elektra Entertainment . But in August , Morgado began alienating Morris when -- without consulting his top lieutenant -- he threatened to send cease-and-desist notices to executives at several competing record companies demanding that they stop approaching Warner-affiliated Interscope Records with buyout offers . Morris , who brought the hugely successful label and its artists -- including Nine Inch Nails , Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg -- into the Warner fold , feared the move might incense Interscope founders Ted Field and Jimmy Iovine so_much that they would break ties with Warner . A month later , Metallica , the wildly popular hard rock_band , publicly blamed Morgado ' s &quot; greedy and arrogant &quot; behavior as the reason it filed a lawsuit to sever its decade-long association with the Elektra label . At issue in the still-pending suit : Morgado ' s alleged refusal to honor a revised deal made by Krasnow . While these incidents added_to Morris ' suspicions about Morgado ' s reluctance to share power , his fears came true in mid-October . The pivotal episode occurred not in the offices of Time Warner ' s music division , but in the company ' s publishing wing , where Entertainment Weekly was preparing its annual list of the 101 most powerful figures in the entertainment_industry . Until Oct . 18 , the day before the issue was to be printed , editors had decided that Morris would share a spot with Morgado at No . 19 . Morris ' photo , however , was deleted after a top Morgado assistant called the publication ' s managing editor and objected , arguing that displaying the two executives side_by_side was &quot; inappropriate. &quot; Following additional complaints from Morgado ' s assistant , all references_to Morris were altogether excised around midnight -- minutes before deadline . Inadvertently alerted about the last-minute change by a magazine researcher ' s phone_call , Morris ' office contacted Entertainment Weekly seeking an explanation . They were told to call Morgado ' s office , but were unable to make contact . Entertainment Weekly managing editor James Seymour denies any impropriety , but admits that he erred by not including Morris somewhere on the list . &quot; People are seizing upon a stupid mistake as evidence that some grand design of dark forces was at_work , &quot; Seymour said , &quot; but that simply was not the case. &quot; One name that remained on the list at No . 59 was Lenny Warnoker , who had been offered Ostin ' s job -- the chairmanship of the Warner Bros . label . But Warnoker was having second_thoughts because he was unhappy with the direction the label was going , leading to another clash at the top . Morris was angered when he learned that Morgado had put_in a pep-talk phone_call to Warnoker without prior consultation . Warner Bros . Records was supposed to be Morris ' domain , and he saw Morgado ' s call as yet another violation of his recently bestowed autonomy . Warnoker wasn ' t swayed by Morgado and announced on Oct . 24 that he would not take the new job . ( He is likely to leave the company before his contract expires at the end of 1995. ) &quot; It was like a war going_on , &quot; one senior Warner executive said . &quot; The corporate boss was pitting each company chief against the other . It got_to the point where everybody was suspicious that somebody else was going_to stab them in the back. &quot; Two days later , Oct . 26 , Morgado made a presentation to Wall_Street analysts , which many on the Morris team saw as a humiliating slap . They felt Morgado took credit for their contributions and downplayed the U.S. division ' s value in the company ' s international growth . Ironically , the speech came when company acts -- Snoop Doggy Dogg , R.E.M. , Green Day and Eric Clapton -- dominated the national Top 10 . Overall , the Warner Music Group controls more_than one-fifth of the domestic market . By that afternoon , the conflict was spiraling out of control . Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin met with Morris and Morgado at 4 p.m. to try to restore order -- and to define Morris ' power . Though three months had passed since Morgado had elevated Morris to run Warner Music U.S. , the contract remained unsigned . Morris hoped Levin would mediate the dispute , but the Time Warner chief left the meeting after just five minutes , telling the two men to work it out themselves . As soon as Levin departed Morgado ' s office , an angry shouting match ensued , with Morgado refusing to budge . Around 10 p.m. that night , Morgado called Morris at_home and threatened to strip away his new title and demote him to his former job as head of the Atlantic Group . About two hours later , Morgado called Morris again to inform him that he had just appointed Warner Music U.K. chief Rob Dickins to replace Warnoker as head of Warner Bros . Records in Burbank . The move infuriated Morris , but Dickins was already on a plane to New York to sign his contract . The next morning , Oct . 27 , instead of reporting to Rockefeller Plaza , Ertegun and his colleagues secretly gathered_in the Central_Park apartment of Stuart Hersch , who runs Atlantic ' s video division . Present were Atlantic executives Danny Goldberg , Mel Lewinter , Val Azzoli , Ina Lee Meibach and Jason Flom , plus Sylvia Rhone , the recently installed Elektra Entertainment chairwoman . &quot; The tension in the room that morning was outrageous , &quot; said one insider . &quot; Everybody felt betrayed and angry and nervous. &quot; Morris had intended to meet his allies at Hersch ' s apartment , but moments before leaving home he was summoned to a 10 a.m. meeting with Morgado . Unlike the night before , the two-hour session in Morgado ' s office proceeded calmly , with Morris outlining a plan for better working relations . His primary request : the autonomy to deal with artists and executives . But Morris walked_out_of the closed-door session empty-handed and headed for Hersch ' s apartment . By the time Morris arrived , just past noon , he figured Morgado had already announced Dickins ' appointment . The mood in the apartment was somber . Many of the participants wondered if they had any future at Time Warner . Ertegun called Morgado to express concern . But unknown to them , more powerful forces were at_work . Members of the Time Warner board of directors , anxious about the impact of the controversy on the company ' s image , called chairman Levin to complain . In a crucial phone_call , Levin re-entered the fray . Sources believe he urged Morgado to resolve the_matter immediately . Minutes later , Morgado called Morris ' office , requesting another meeting . Morris ' team followed him back to Rockefeller Plaza to await their fate . Morris and Ertegun entered Morgado ' s office around 2 p.m. Over the next three hours , Morgado acquiesced to nearly every request as the three men sketched out the exact parameters of Morris ' power -- including a new title : chairman and chief_executive of Warner Music U.S. Under the plan , Morris still reports to Morgado , but he has been given autonomy to run the North_American companies . During the meeting , Morris told Morgado that he wanted to appoint his trusted confidant Danny Goldberg , rather than Dickins , to head Warner Bros . Records . Morgado agreed . An embarrassed Dickins , who had already told several industry figures that he had the job , returned home to London . The day ended in Morris ' office with a champagne toast between Morgado , Morris , Goldberg , Lewinter and Rhone -- joined by Levin . &quot; Everybody was smiling and hugging and making_up , &quot; said one executive . &quot; But it ' s a different ballgame than it was before the battle broke_out . Morgado is a powerful man and he ' s not likely to soon forgive or forget . He ' s been defanged , but not de-clawed. &quot; No one expects the scars to heal soon . &quot; The lesson in all_of this is that there ' s more to a music company than the profits it generates , &quot; suggested one executive . &quot; It involves people . It ' s the people that count. &quot;</TEXT>
