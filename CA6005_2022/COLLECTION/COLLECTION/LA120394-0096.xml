Interest_rates dropped despite an unexpectedly strong November employment report , which showed the nation ' s unemployment_rate dropping 0.2-percentage point to 5.6 % . Analysts said that data might have signaled that the economy was growing at an inflationary pace , and could encourage the Federal_Reserve_Board to further raise short-term interest_rates . But bond investors focused_on part of the jobs report that showed a drop_in hourly wages and the average workweek , both of which signaled that inflation may_not be an immediate problem . Signs of low inflation could slow_down any plans the Fed may have for further tightening credit , and that was taken as good news for both stocks and bonds . &quot; The conclusion , at least for today -- and it ' s only tentative -- is that the economy is going_to slow to a no-boom , no-bust , sustainable , non-inflationary pace , &quot; said Hugh Johnson , chief market_strategist at First Albany Corp .

Investors ' fears of higher interest_rates were also softened by a drop of 0.1 % in October in the government ' s index of leading indicators , and a 0.4-percentage point drop_in factory orders in October , analysts said . Todd Clark , senior director in equity trading at Mabon Securities , said stocks were also getting a lift from the firmer dollar and lower oil prices . The dollar ended the week in New York at 100.61 Japanese yen , up from 99.34 late Thursday . It was the currency ' s first close above 100 yen since Oct . 11 and the highest since Oct . 7 . The dollar closed at 1.580 German marks -- the best finish against that currency since Aug . 31 -- up from 1.573 marks Thursday . Crude_oil futures plunged to a seven-week low after 28 Pennsylvania counties backed_away from using a new gasoline aimed at reducing air_pollution . The prospect of reduced demand for the cleaner-burning fuel triggered a 6.8 % drop_in gasoline futures and a sharp decline in heating_oil .
