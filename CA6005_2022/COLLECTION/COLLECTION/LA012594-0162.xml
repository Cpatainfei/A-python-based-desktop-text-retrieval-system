   <HEADLINE> PROPERTY VALUES : EARTHQUAKE LEAVES MORTGAGE CHAOS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Rose recovered from the initial shock of last week ' s earthquake , she began to worry about her two-bedroom Tarzana condo and how the earthquake would affect her plans to refinance her mortgage . Rose , who does not want her last_name used , was one of the lucky ones . The interior of her condo suffered only cosmetic damage , and the complex itself seems to have fared pretty well . Getting a new loan on the condo will probably be more complicated now , however . Plus , Rose ' s tenants packed up and moved two days after the quake because they couldn ' t stand the shaking anymore . &quot; I need to sort through what I ' m going_to do , &quot; Rose said . &quot; I was hoping a new loan would be approved soon so that I could save money on my mortgage , &quot; she said . &quot; But my gut feeling is that it ' s going_to be put_on hold. &quot; Homeowners who sustained serious damage from the Northridge temblor are obviously in a quandary about what to do . There are many_more people lucky enough to have suffered very little damage , but they are still worried about their property values and prospects for getting their mortgages refinanced , and whether pending sales of property will actually go_through . &quot; We are still figuring_out what our policy is going_to be , &quot; said Kathy Marshel , Los Angeles regional manager at Chase Manhattan Personal Financial Services , which has offices in Encino . &quot; The process is going_to get delayed -- especially in the Valley. &quot; The decision of what to do with particular loans is being made on a &quot; case-by-case basis , &quot; Marshel said . &quot; We want to make_sure we have a solid piece of collateral. &quot; In some cases , Chase Manhattan will send_out an appraiser for a second look . If an initial review suggests there may be a problem , she said , then an inspector will be asked to take a close look_at any earthquake-related damages . Figuring what a property is worth after all_the earth movements is very uncertain , Marshel conceded . &quot; It ' s a very tough judgment call to make. &quot; &quot; The procedure that we ' re going to be following is what ' s required by the VA , FHA , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and other investors , &quot; said Ann Pennywitt , vice_president at ARCS Mortgage Inc. in Calabasas . &quot; We ' re all going_to be driven by what the secondary mortgage market requires , &quot; she added . &quot; Secondary market investors ( those who buy mortgages ) don ' t want a re-verification of_value , they want to know if there has been substantial damage to the property. &quot; &quot; People who are going_through the process of getting a loan with us will have to show that there are no visible signs of damage to their property from the earthquake. &quot; Some properties will have to be inspected , others will need reappraisal . When there is a reassessment of the appraisal , Pennywitt said , &quot; the appraiser will have to address . . . what market_value losses may have occurred as a result of the quake. &quot; There will be other new demands . Because many businesses have been adversely affected by all_the shaking , Pennywitt said , &quot; we ' ll require reverification of employment for certain loans. &quot; On government-backed loans , she said , lenders will generally want any damage to a property to be repaired before the loan is made . If damage to a property is not substantial , she said , lenders may agree to close a loan so_long as repair money is set_aside in escrow . All this extra work will lengthen the loan process , Pennywitt predicted . At ARCS ' headquarters last week , staffers and outside contractors were using hair_dryers and clotheslines to dry_out documents that were soaked when its building was flooded . Pennywitt remains optimistic about moving things along , though . &quot; We ' re hearing from some of our loan officers that they can accomplish the extra paperwork in just a_few days , &quot; she said . And , loans that were supposed to close within the next two weeks will have their loan-rate lock-in period extended . Dennis B . Ellman , a real_estate partner at the Century City law_firm Greenberg , Glusker , Fields , Claman &amp; Machtinger and a resident of Encino , reports that he has received numerous calls from clients with questions about pending sales and other real_estate transactions . &quot; If a residence is significantly damaged or destroyed , buyers generally have a right to cancel a sales contract and tenants can terminate their lease , &quot; Ellman said . &quot; I think there will be purchasers who will attempt to either terminate their escrows or obtain a reduction of the purchase_price based on the fact that the neighborhood has changed because of the earthquake . I don ' t believe , however , that the law will give them relief in this situation , &quot; Ellman said . Most courts will only allow the sales transaction to be canceled if there has been serious damage to the premises . While the risk of a property being destroyed traditionally passed to a buyer as soon as a purchase_contract was signed , that ' s no longer the case . The risk does not pass from seller to buyer until escrow closes or until a buyer takes possession -- whichever comes first , Ellman said . Real_estate contracts were also traditionally not considered to be time sensitive like other types of contracts . Most residential sales contracts_in California , however , provide that &quot; time is of essence &quot; in closing the deal . If a seller can make needed repairs within a reasonable time beyond the intended closing date of a sale , most courts will still consider the buyer obligated , Ellman said . If the repairs would take a long_time , the buyer is more likely to get_off the hook . These are confusing times and all_the rules are uncertain , said Joe Conrad , president of the Spectrum Group , a Woodland Hills-based mortgage brokerage , and a board_member of the California Assn . of Mortgage Brokers , Los Angeles chapter . Lenders will continue to make money available , Conrad said . &quot; If you ' re in the process of getting a loan , lenders are not overly concerned with cosmetic cracks but with structural damage . They want to know the impact on property value , &quot; Conrad said . &quot; The majority of lenders don ' t want to know about damage to the neighborhood but damage to the structure. &quot; Besides , he averred , &quot; you could make an argument that the value of properties in damaged neighborhoods has gone_up because there ' s less to choose from. &quot; A house that was worth $ 200 # 000 two weeks ago is probably still worth $ 200 # 000 , assuming there has been no structural damage , Conrad said . &quot; The current level of concern will pass , &quot; he said . &quot; If anything , the earthquake may create a shortage of available housing and in the long term , all this may help fuel the local economy. &quot; &quot; Nobody really knows where values are going except by complete conjecture , &quot; said Mark Soroko , manager and vice_president of the Bank of Hollywood in Toluca Lake , which makes commercial loans and brokers residential loans . &quot; I don ' t think we have a true handle yet on the damage , &quot; Soroko said . &quot; Time will tell what the trend will be , &quot; he said . For now , &quot; people are still in a state of shock. &quot;</TEXT>
