   <HEADLINE> 5.3 QUAKE HITS EUREKA AREA ; TEMBLOR : DAMAGE IS CONSIDERABLE IN SEVERAL HUMBOLDT COUNTY_TOWNS . MOST INJURIES ARE MINOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck before dawn Monday near Eureka , causing about 25 minor injuries , littering the downtown area with glass and producing considerable damage in several communities in Northern California ' s Humboldt County . Emergency authorities said seven homes were red-tagged as unsafe and their occupants were moved to shelters after the 6:10 a.m. temblor , which occurred 11 miles beneath the surface on the Gorda tectonic plate , 12 miles southwest of Eureka . California ' s North Coast -- where three plates floating on the Earth ' s mantle intersect -- has been shaken repeatedly in the last 15 years , with four quakes measuring at least magnitude 7 . But all_of these have been off the coast and at a greater distance from Eureka . &quot; A quake closer to home seems stronger , &quot; said Lori Dengler , a Humboldt State University seismologist . &quot; And this one struck with a large closing jolt , and a lot of people say they saw flashing lights , not an uncommon phenomenon in some earthquakes. &quot; &quot; It hit really hard , &quot; said Eureka resident Jean Gordon . &quot; We were still in bed asleep and it woke us . It broke a_few things in the house . We had shelves come_down , but there was no damage to anything that was important. &quot; Gordon said she and her husband later drove through the city of 25 # 000 on the overcast and drizzly day and saw &quot; quite a_few big bay_windows shattered and some evidence of landslides. &quot; &quot; It created a total mess , &quot; Jonathan Webb said of his neighborhood . &quot; I can hear people hammering and pounding and putting things back together. &quot; Gary Fallan , a spokesman for the Humboldt County Office of Emergency Services , said that the county_courthouse , which had been undergoing retrofitting , was damaged and that three towns -- Arcata , Fortuna and McKinleyville -- had some damage . Chimneys fell at several homes_in and outside Eureka , he said . Three hospitals told Eureka police that injured people , a_few with fractured limbs , came_to their emergency_rooms for treatment . At St . Joseph ' s Hospital , emergency generators were used for an hour when power failed , and even hours later , the facility ' s computer_system remained out , a spokeswoman said . Bill Walser , a Eureka city spokesman , said that aside from the injuries , a gas_line rupture caused the most trouble . The street had to be ripped_up by workers seeking to locate the leak , he said . Fallen merchandise caused two major stores in the city ' s malls to close for cleanup on the first shopping day after Christmas , Walser said . The city ' s fishing pier appeared to sustain &quot; a very minor movement away from the shoreline , &quot; he said , and there was a broken waterline at the pier . But the public was still being allowed on the pier . Dirt and mudslides on U.S. 101 did not interrupt traffic and scattered power outages were cleared_up quickly , Walser said . He said one man was arrested on suspicion of looting after he was found with merchandise from a store whose window had been shattered . The earthquake was felt as far away as Grants Pass , Ore . Allan Lindh , a scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey at Menlo Park , Calif. , called the quake unusual because it was_on the tectonic plate itself rather than on one of the plate boundaries . &quot; Not too many quakes have been felt at this particular location , &quot; Lindh said . &quot; But it ' s part of a pattern of increasing activity in the Gorda plate north of the Triple Junction , &quot; where the Gorda , North_American and Pacific plates come_together and California ' s greatest fault , the San Andreas , first comes ashore from the Pacific_Ocean . In 1992 and on Sept . 1 of this year , major temblors , measuring magnitude 7.1 and 7.2 , occurred near the Triple Junction and were related to subduction zones , where the leading edge of one plate is slowly submerging and burrowing under another . But Monday ' s was not a subduction zone quake , Lindh said .
