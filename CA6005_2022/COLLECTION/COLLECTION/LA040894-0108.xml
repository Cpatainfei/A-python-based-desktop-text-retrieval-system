   <HEADLINE> A PROTEST OUT OF AFRICA ; * MOHAMED OMER BUSHARA ' S STEREOTYPE-DEFYING WORK REFLECTS OPPRESSION IN HIS NATIVE SUDAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A chance meeting in Africa has affected the lives of two very different people . Sondra Hale , who teaches anthropology and women ' s studies at UCLA , met Sudanese artist Mohamed Omer Bushara in Sudan in 1972 . He was working_at the Department of Culture in Khartoum . She had first visited Sudan in the early 1960s , and returned after earning a master ' s degree in African studies , to do research for her doctorate in anthropology . Bushara , using everyday objects in his office -- pen and ink , markers , matches and scraps of paper -- was making small-scale drawings . Though they appeared whimsical , Hale also saw serious ironies in Bushara ' s work . The artist , then 26 , had never shown his work to the public . Self-taught , he chose drawing as a way to convey his feelings about his culture . &quot; My contribution was professionalizing his life , &quot; Hale said . &quot; I convinced him to show his work. &quot; Two years later , he had his first solo show in Khartoum . Out of that show , he won first prize in a visual arts competition sponsored by African Arts magazine , and a scholarship to the Slade School of Fine_Art in London . Hale is now introducing Bushara ' s work to the West Coast with the exhibit &quot; Mohamed Omer Bushara : Protest Art and Sudan , 1973-1993. &quot; It was originally organized through Cal State Northridge ' s Art_Galleries and was scheduled to open there in February until the Jan . 17 earthquake closed the gallery . The Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena graciously made space available . Hale , who besides her adjunct associate professorship at UCLA chairs the women ' s studies department at Cal State Northridge , curated the exhibit of more_than 200 drawings , etchings , artist ' s books and sculpture . Sabrina Lynn Motley , a doctoral candidate in anthropology at UCLA and lecturer at Otis School of Art / Design , helped curate . Hale and Motley see the show not only as a spotlight on Bushara ' s work , but as a &quot; test of our stereotypes &quot; about African art , Hale said . &quot; To walk in a room where there is no kinta cloth or baskets , and to think_of Bushara , who is a Muslim , but doesn ' t do the stereotype of ( traditionally calligraphic ) Islamic art . He does human forms . This is not a man apart from his culture . To have somebody think_about African art differently would be enough for me. &quot; &quot; Art in Africa has been dynamic and innovative and continues to grow , &quot; Motley said . Sudan , the largest country in Africa , gained its independence from Britain in 1956 . It was the first sub-Saharan country to free itself from European domination . Nevertheless , the military has often governed the nation . * Hale said Sudan is one of the 25 poorest countries in the world . Among its population of about 25 million are more_than 500 ethnic_groups , 110 languages and hundreds of religions and religious sects . However , an estimated 70 % of the population is Sunni Muslim . &quot; In 1989 , an ultraconservative , Islamist military junta came_to power , &quot; Hale has written in a curator ' s statement . &quot; Sudan is now an Islamic state , with sharia ( religious law ) in_effect . All political_parties , interest_groups , unions and professional_associations are banned , as were most of the newspapers. &quot; Bushara , reacting to the military dictatorship in the ' 70s and ' 80s , &quot; was part of an outspoken leftist contingency in Sudan . He wrote art criticism , and illustrated political stories against the government , &quot; Hale said . Feeling the threat to his artistic freedom , in the early ' 80s he left for Saudi_Arabia , where he still lives . Among the earlier works in the show is Bushara ' s two-part &quot; Seasons of Our Discontent , &quot; a 1975 collaboration with Hale . Her haiku verse and his drawings convey the weight of oppression and political corruption on the people . Bushara &quot; likes to have people engage with him in his art , &quot; Hale said , &quot; to break_down the notion of artist as estranged character removed from society . Anything that could be mass-produced serves his purposes . All objects in nature and society could be art . The stuff he did with coffee and sugar disintegrated . I would write him and say , ' Bugs ate your art. ' &quot; The 1975 &quot; Self-Portrait &quot; in the show was fashioned out of wood . &quot; He said , ' I saw this piece of wood on the ground , and it looked_like me , ' &quot; Hale said . &quot; He is the most unpretentious artist and intellectual . He ' s political in the humanitarian sense of depicting poor , sad children , but his work is also comical and often beautiful , poetic and loving. &quot; But there are also the chilling etchings he did while at the Slade school ( 1976-77 ) . The suggestion of death by torture and execution is omnipresent in these images . A soldier eats a person in Bushara ' s 1976 ink-wash drawing from the &quot; Political Series of Four. &quot; In his most recent work , the human figure is becoming increasingly more abstract , each image less lyrical and quirky . &quot; For me , the art depicts political situations , but that ' s just a depiction , &quot; Motley said . &quot; It becomes political when we walk_out_of here and do something about it. &quot; WHERE AND WHEN What : &quot; Mohamed Omer Bushara : Protest Art and Sudan , &quot; 1973-1993 . Location : Armory Center for the Arts , 145 N . Raymond Ave. , Pasadena . Hours : Noon to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays . Ends April 24 . Price : Free . Street parking .
