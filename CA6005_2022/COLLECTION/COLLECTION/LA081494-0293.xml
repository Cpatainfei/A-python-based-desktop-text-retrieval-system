   <HEADLINE> GERMAN POLICE CONFIRM SEIZURE OF NUCLEAR FUEL SMUGGLED FROM RUSSIA ; EUROPE : CACHE ON FLIGHT FROM MOSCOW WAS THIRD FOUND THIS YEAR . OFFICIALS THINK IT WAS HEADED FOR BLACK_MARKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> German police have made their third and largest seizure this year of weapons-grade nuclear material apparently smuggled from the former Soviet_Union for_sale on the world black_market , officials said Saturday . Bavaria state police in Munich confirmed reports by the weekly magazines Der Spiegel and Focus that they confiscated a stash of highly enriched plutonium hidden in the suitcase of a passenger on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow on Wednesday . German media reported that three suspects , two Spaniards and a Colombian , were arrested . The seizure supports warnings by U.S. and German officials of a growing post-Cold War black_market in radioactive materials . German authorities say their country is a primary transit route for the smugglers , and they suspect that the buyers of the nuclear materials could be terrorist organizations or the governments of Iran , Iraq , Libya or North_Korea . &quot; This is a grave danger , not only for us but for many ( countries ) , &quot; Chancellor Helmut Kohl told the German television network ZDF . On a trip through Germany , Poland and Russia in early July , FBI Director Louis J . Freeh called nuclear smuggling operations &quot; the greatest long-term threat to the security of the United States. &quot; The exact quantity of plutonium confiscated Wednesday was still uncertain , but it was at least 10 times as great as the previous find and potentially worth millions of dollars . Police said experts at a European atomic research institute in Karlsruhe were examining 100 to 300 grams of what could be pure plutonium-239 , which can be used to build a nuclear bomb . Der Spiegel reported that 500 grams of a &quot; fine dark-brown powder &quot; was confiscated by police but that nuclear experts had indicated only about 50 grams of it was usable for nuclear_weapons . Final test results are not expected for several days . About three to five kilograms -- approximately seven to 11 pounds -- of plutonium are needed to build an atomic_bomb , according to one scientific expert . &quot; Of course the worry is that it might be we only catch one of five ( shipments ) and they all have the same buyer , &quot; the expert said . German authorities have handled about 250 cases involving supposed radioactive substances since the collapse of the Soviet_Union . All but three turned_out to be scams in which con_men were trying to peddle fake bomb material . The three exceptions , however , have alarmed officials . Last May , police in the southwestern state of Baden-Wurttemberg arrested businessman Adolf Jaekle on suspicion of counterfeiting and found six grams of nearly pure plutonium-239 in his garage . Tests showed that the sample was of Russian origin , probably from a nuclear_weapons factory . On Thursday , Bavarian police announced that during June and July they arrested five East European men and a German woman for smuggling one gram of enriched uranium-235 , believed to have come from a Russian nuclear_power station or submarine . The woman , a real_estate_agent , was believed to be the leader of that smuggling band . Several German media reported Saturday that a police informant helped obtain the most recent arrests at the Munich airport . Der Spiegel quoted German intelligence officials as saying that the operation possibly had been organized by Libyan , Iranian or Iraqi diplomats . Police said the plutonium was carried in a lead-lined steel box and that no passengers , flight crew or ground_crew had been exposed to danger . It is not known if the three seizures in Germany are related . The exact sources of the nuclear materials are unknown , although all are believed to have come from Russia or the former Soviet republics . Germany ' s DPA news_agency said Russian government_agencies had no information on the most recent seizure . &quot; Up to now , not a single plutonium loss has been recorded , &quot; one Russian official told DPA . But Russian police also have announced several arrests and seizures of nuclear materials . Kohl said he wrote to Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin on the issue before leaving for vacation in Austria last month and that the two will speak about the issue when Kohl returns . &quot; I will also very quickly send an envoy to him to find_out what we can do to establish once and for all where these things come from . We do not know this . Secondly , every possible step must be taken_to prevent such things from happening in the future , &quot; Kohl said . Poorly paid workers at former Soviet nuclear facilities are among those suspected of selling the nuclear material . The smuggling is being done_by low-level criminal gangs willing to peddle anything from narcotics to currency to weapons , authorities say . But they also fear that organized crime in Russia or Italy will get_into the business . Der Spiegel reported that the Russian deputy minister for nuclear_energy , Viktor Sidorenko , was aboard the flight from Moscow on which the latest stash was discovered . He was flying to Germany to meet with Bavarian officials about civilian nuclear projects . A police spokesman would not comment on whether Sidorenko was a suspect in the smuggling , but one source said his presence was believed to be an &quot; ironic coincidence. &quot;</TEXT>
