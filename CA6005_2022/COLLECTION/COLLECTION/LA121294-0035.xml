   <HEADLINE> FIRST DAVIS CUP THEN GRAND_SLAM CUP FOR LARSSON ; TENNIS : SWEDE DEFEATS NO . 1 SAMPRAS TO WIN SPORT ' S RICHEST TOURNAMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One week after helping Sweden win the Davis Cup , Magnus Larsson upset top-ranked Pete Sampras to win the richest prize in tennis -- $ 1.5 million . Larsson won , 7-6 ( 8-6 ) , 4-6 , 7-6 ( 7-5 ) , 6-4 , in the final of the Grand_Slam Cup on Sunday , at $ 6 million the most lucrative tennis tournament in the world . &quot; This is the best Christmas_present I could get , &quot; Larsson said . Larsson nearly equaled his career prize_money of $ 1 # 690 , 317 , and more_than doubled his 1994 earnings , which had stood at $ 639 # 105 before the final . The economic news wasn ' t bad for Sampras , either . The American , who won the inaugural Grand_Slam Cup in 1990 , earned $ 750 # 000 , plus a bonus of $ 500 # 000 for the two Grand_Slam titles he won in 1994 -- the Australian Open and Wimbledon . By adding $ 1.25 million to his 1994 earnings , Sampras reached the record sum of $ 4 # 857 , 812 for a year . Sunday ' s prize_money also boosted the career earnings for the two-time Wimbledon champion to more_than $ 16 million . The tournament invites 16 players with the best records in the four Grand_Slam events , which also include the_French and U.S. Opens . Larsson , who had never beaten Sampras in five previous matches , made the tournament by virtue of reaching the semifinals at the_French Open , his best finish at a Grand_Slam event . He is ranked 19th in the world . Sampras won 10 titles this year , the last at the ATP Tour World Championship in Frankfurt in November . But he could not match the raw power of Larsson , who hit 31 aces . A winner of two titles this year , Larsson broke Sampras twice in the final set to take a 5-1 lead . He wasted a match_point and was broken_in the eighth game , allowing Sampras to cut the lead to 5-4 . But Larsson went_up , 40-0 , on his serve , and a service winner gave him the match after 2 hours 37 minutes . &quot; At the start of the fourth set I had a_few good games , but at the end I felt a bit tired -- the pressure was_on me , &quot; Larsson said . &quot; But I saw that Pete was also tired and I thought that the longer the match lasts , the better my chances . &quot; To win the Davis Cup is something very big , I felt I could go here and play with no pressure. &quot; In reaching the final , Larsson upset three higher-ranked players -- Davis Cup teammate Stefan Edberg , world No . 2 Andre Agassi , and Todd Martin in the semifinals . Sampras had to battle through five tough sets Saturday against Goran Ivanisevic . He didn ' t look as fresh Sunday as Larsson . &quot; I felt a bit tired , but you ' ve got_to give Magnus credit , &quot; Sampras said . &quot; He played too good , he served too big , and he ' s coming_off the Davis Cup victory. &quot;</TEXT>
