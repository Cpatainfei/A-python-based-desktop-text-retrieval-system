   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : PLATFORM ; PROP . 187 : ' RACIST INITIATIVE ' OR A ' STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ? '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Nov . 8 , Californians will vote on a controversial initiative on immigration , Proposition 187 , the so-called Save Our State initiative ( See box , right ) . Here are opinions on the initiative from Latinos and Latinas , a community that arguably will be most affected if S.O.S. passes . EDGAR APARICIO Artist , 44 , legal resident who emigrated from El_Salvador 12 years ago I came here because of the war in El_Salvador ( after his wife , brother , sister-in-law and daughter were killed ) . What I have heard about the initiative is that it will prohibit illegal immigrants from receiving medical benefits , and the children will be denied education . It is justified by stating that it will save money , but what is forgotten is that the refugees are here as a result of American policy toward the countries we came from . It is a policy of helping repressive regimes , not a policy of helping to create jobs in our countries or solving the problems . The sad and contradictory part is that we are in a worse situation here . With this initiative we would not have access to health_care . What country in the world denies health_care to a human_being ? Even a country like Cuba that is poor and criticized for its economic_system has the sensibility to understand that the essential elements for a human_being are access to health_care and an education . Denying illegal immigrants an education would only increase the formation of gangs and juvenile_delinquency . This initiative would have normal folks , like teachers , whose mission is to educate , point a finger at a person who looks illegal . That would be the saddest thing for a teacher , to learn how to destroy rather than construct . It would have police_officers and doctors or nurses point a finger at somebody who comes asking_for help . CELESTE GREIG Importer / exporter , naturalized American citizen who emigrated from Spain 27 years ago * The sad part of Proposition 187 is that our elected officials have blatantly disregarded the will of the people , therefore we have to go_through the process of the initiative in_order to implement the laws . They have failed to come_up with good legal immigration policy . I think that this is not a perfect initiative , but it ' s a step_in the right direction . A lot of people from the opposition claim we are using the illegal aliens as scapegoats because of the economy . That is not true . These individuals that come here , granted , come here to seek a better life due_to finances at_home . I know for a fact that there is a very small percentage of them who come here because of disturbances in their countries . I don ' t think that the illegal aliens are to blame for crime . However , I do feel very strongly that they do contribute to the decay of the economy . Some people claim that they pay their share of taxes , but I am in business . Most of these people do not pay their share of taxes because when they come here they do not have documents . Our children are not getting enough education -- the classrooms are crowded . I sympathize_with all_of the children , legal or illegal , but let ' s face it : We have to take_care of our people first . Personally , if I came_across somebody who I knew was an illegal alien I could not report them . I know it is hard to comprehend why I am supporting the S.O.S. initiative and why I would be unable to turn somebody in , but I just couldn ' t do_it . That will be the role of law_enforcement and the school_system . PETE NAVARRO Attorney , 43 , Los Angeles native * This initiative is the most racist initiative ever . It targets the Mexican , Central_American and Asian communities . The proponents of this initiative are using the immigrant population as scapegoats for the economic woes of this state , which are the result , in my opinion , of Republican economic_policies in the past 12 years . This initiative targets the most vulnerable segments of our population : children and the sick . The children of the immigrants had no choice in the_matter as_to immigrate . They have no political power -- they can ' t vote . And the uninsured sick who have no health benefits , can ' t qualify for medical , are in the worst position to fight for their rights . It also doesn ' t make practical sense . The initiative states that , undocumented or not , all are eligible for emergency health_care . That means , if I was undocumented and have a cough and a fever , I go_to the clinic or general hospital , I will be denied care . So I have to wait until it develops_into pneumonia , then I ' ll be eligible and they ' ll have to spend thousands of dollars . Proponents don ' t mind illegal immigrants cleaning their toilets , taking_care of their children and mowing their lawns and on the other hand talking_about all_of these problems that illegal immigrants are causing . Illegal immigration is a problem that is larger than what this initiative or any local initiative can handle . It ' s a global problem , tied to international economics . FEDERICO MARISCAL Mexican citizen , 24 , attending USC on a student visa * I think this is a really complex problem , but I agree with the proponents . There are too many people here already . The United States has lots of problems with health_care and crime . They have to take_care of their problems first before they take_care of the problems of illegal aliens . I think one of the problems is that illegal immigrants don ' t merge into American society . For example , Mexicans stay Mexican and Asians stay Asians -- everyone has their own society . They can ' t melt into American society in_general if they don ' t want to . I think Mexican heritage and culture is so strong that it ' s really hard for them to melt into American society . I am not saying that we have to forget our heritage as Mexicans ; I think we have a great history and culture and we have to be proud_of it . However , if you are coming here , you have to change a little bit . To break_into another culture you have to at least speak the language . In Mexico it is very , very hard to become a Mexican citizen . What we have to do as Mexicans is try to improve the situation in Mexico . If these people want to leave Mexico it ' s because something is wrong . AMANDA Undocumented immigrant , 34 , who arrived in Los Angeles from Honduras 18 months ago * I don ' t think this initiative will cease immigration to this country . The causes of immigration originate_in our countries . There is too_much poverty , too_much injustice , terrible economic_conditions , political repression and those causes still persist_in our countries.I came here not only for a better way to live ( myself ) but to provide a better way_of_life for my family . I could not come here with my two children . I left them in Honduras with my family . My intention is to stay here for a while and then go_back , because really the situation here is not very easy . In our countries we are not aware of the services that are offered here . We only hope to improve ourselves and to work . We do pay taxes -- we consume goods and services . This issue of illegal immigration needs to be looked_at in a more creative way such_as understanding the factors of immigration , and how much immigrants contribute to this country , economically and culturally . It cannot be looked_at in only a negative light . My life here has been very difficult and sad . It ' s hard coming_to a new country and leaving my family and experiencing discrimination . The negative effects of this initiative are already being felt . The fear in the immigrant community is growing . What the Ballot Proposal Would Do Proposition 187 , which will appear on the Nov . 8 ballot , seeks to discourage illegal immigration by denying publicly funded benefits . Critics say immigrants come_to the United States for jobs , not benefits . Here are the major provisions : HEALTH SERVICES * Current law : Illegal immigrants may receive a wide variety of care at publicly funded hospitals and clinics . Federal law bars health_facilities from denying emergency aid to anyone . * Proposition 187 : Denies non-emergency public care to those who cannot prove legal_status , including prenatal and postnatal services . SOCIAL_SERVICES * Current law : Federal and state laws bar illegal immigrants from most major benefits , such_as welfare and unemployment insurance . * Proposition 187 : Cuts_off a host of other state and locally funded programs that are directed toward troubled youths , the blind and other illegal immigrants with special needs . FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS * Current law : The use of fraudulent documents to prove residency is illegal . * Proposition 187 : Creates new state felonies and stiffens penalties . EDUCATION * Current law : Court rulings have held that undocumented children are entitled to elementary and secondary public_school education . Illegal immigrants may also attend state colleges and universities , but most are charged non-resident tuition rates . * Proposition 187 : Bars enrollment in all public_schools , colleges and universities . Parents or guardians of all schoolchildren , including U.S. citizens , would likewise have to demonstrate legal residence . The law would oblige school administrators to report students and parents suspected of being illegal immigrants . LAW_ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION * Current law : Many local police agencies avoid getting involved in immigration matters because they believe it would discourage victims and witnesses from reporting crimes . * Proposition 187 : State , city and county law_enforcement authorities would be obligated to question arrestees about their citizenship or immigration status and report suspected illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the state_attorney general .</TEXT>
