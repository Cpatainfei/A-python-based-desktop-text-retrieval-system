   <HEADLINE> SECRET OPERATION SAFEGUARDED URANIUM ; KAZAKHSTAN : U.S. WORKED FOR MONTHS TO ARRANGE TRANSFER . CLINTON CALLS IT A MAJOR NON-PROLIFERATION SUCCESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kazakhstan ' s decision to transfer half a ton of weapons-grade uranium to the United States involved months of top-secret negotiations , assembly of a garage-size processing facility in remote Ulba and a clandestine airlift , U.S. officials said Wednesday . Details of the operation , which was designed to prevent the uranium from falling_into the hands of rogue Third_World governments , were revealed Wednesday , a day after U.S. officials disclosed that they had succeeded in bringing the material to the United States . The more_than 1 # 000 pounds of highly enriched fuel , which the officials said was enough to manufacture 20 to 36 nuclear bombs or warheads , was left over from Kazakhstan ' s days as a Soviet republic and was poorly stored and vulnerable to smuggling . Over a nine-month period , U.S. technicians tested and dehydrated the uranium , packaged it in special containers and flew it to the Energy_Department ' s facility at Oak Ridge , Tenn. , for reprocessing into commercial-grade fuel that no longer will be usable for weapons . President Clinton on Wednesday called the operation a major success for the Administration ' s counter-proliferation efforts . &quot; One more threat of nuclear terrorism and proliferation has been removed from the world , &quot; he said . &quot; Today , this is a good day. &quot; The story , as told by senior U.S. officials at a news_conference , began early this year , when Kazakh President Nursultan A . Nazarbayev personally brought the uranium cache to U.S. attention , asking_for help in safeguarding and disposing_of the unneeded material . The uranium had been used by a Soviet metallurgical facility that had used it to produce fuel for nuclear warships . Kazakhstan no longer had any need for the material and had no way of keeping it properly stored and secure from possible pilferage . Over the next several months , U.S. officials entered into detailed negotiations with the Kazakhs , bringing_in the Russians to make_sure they were aware of the pending arrangement and had no serious objections . The U.S.-Russian side of the deal was worked_out by a bilateral commission headed by Vice_President Al Gore and Russian Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin . By June , the Russians were fully on board . The United States and Kazakhstan finally could go_ahead . The terms of the arrangement were simple enough : U.S. technicians would extract uranium from the cache and send it to Oak Ridge for reprocessing . The entire process would be overseen by the International Atomic Energy Agency . At Oak Ridge , technicians began preparing_for the venture . Scientists built a garage-size processing facility in Tennessee , tested it and took it apart again for reassembly at the Ulba plant in Kazakhstan . Security drills were conducted every day . In early October , a team of 31 Americans -- from the Pentagon , State_Department and Martin-Marietta Corp. , the prime contractor at Oak Ridge -- traveled_to Kazakhstan for a six-week operation designed to bring the uranium to the United States safely . The job was a complex one . The material was scattered in several different batches and in different forms . It had to be prepared carefully for removal , dried and baked so that it could be packaged in cans . The process included opening 1 # 050 Soviet-era containers of highly enriched uranium . The material was repackaged in 456 special U.S.-made containers and loaded on U.S. military planes . The radioactive uranium required special handling so the technicians would not be contaminated . But the technical side was only part of the job . Because of the threat of pilferage or smuggling , the team had to operate under top-secret security procedures . The team worked 12 to 14 hours a day , six days a week . Finally , late Sunday morning , the first section of the uranium deposits was loaded aboard a U.S. Air_Force C-5A cargo plane and flown to Dover Air_Force Base in Delaware on the first leg of the mission . Two other planes followed , each about 12 hours apart . At Dover , the containers were placed on trucks and hauled in convoys to Oak Ridge under heavy security . The final shipment arrived early Wednesday morning . Television networks , which became aware of the story Tuesday , were asked to hold it off the air . For the Administration , the transfer of the former Soviet uranium stockpile marked something of a diplomatic coup -- precisely what it had been trying to accomplish . Iran already has tried to buy Kazakhstan ' s uranium , and other countries had expressed interest . U.S. intelligence agencies have pointed to a growing number of Third_World countries -- from Iran to North_Korea -- that either have nuclear_weapons programs or are trying to buy bombs . The Clinton_Administration has been engaged in a multi-pronged effort to rein_in nuclear proliferation , both through traditional diplomatic efforts and by providing U.S. technical and financial_aid to keep nuclear materials under closer scrutiny . However , the transfer deal involving Kazakhstan is the first of its kind . For Kazakhstan , the move meant new recognition around the globe and several hundred million dollars in compensation from the United States . ( U.S. officials are refusing to make public the amount for fear of setting a &quot; floor &quot; for other negotiations that may come up. ) In Moscow , news of the uranium transfer brought protests from some conservatives , who argued that former Soviet nuclear stocks should by rights belong_to Russia and that the Kremlin should control their disposal more closely . &quot; All the weaponry in the Soviet_Union was made by Russians , &quot; said Valery Davydov , an expert on nuclear non-proliferation at the USA-Canada Institute , a prestigious Russian think_tank . &quot; The Kazakhs could never create nukes by themselves -- that ' s clear. &quot; Davydov warned that the Kazakhstan deal would &quot; give a very strong card to the opposition in Russia . They will yell that Russia ' s national security is_on sale , without Russia ' s control. &quot; But the Russian government stuck_by the agreement Wednesday , and there was little doubt that the Clinton_Administration considered it a red-letter day . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry said that the United States did not yet have any other takers for such a transfer of nuclear material . But he left the door open .
