   <HEADLINE> FACTORIES REVEL IN NEW INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION ; MANUFACTURING : SPENDING ON HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT IS DRIVING A BREATHLESS EXPANSION . BUT WHAT ' S GROWING IS PRODUCTIVITY , NOT JOBS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The factory floor is clean -- and surprisingly quiet . Only a handful of men tinker with huge machines destined for other plants that will turn metal into automobiles , appliances and construction equipment . Owned by Giddings &amp; Lewis , America ' s biggest producer of machine_tools , the factory is a window on a revolution in U.S. manufacturing -- and the peculiar nature of the nation ' s robust economy . Heavy industry is pouring money into advanced equipment such_as Giddings ' automated machine_tools . Capital spending on equipment increased 16.2 % in 1993 , driving the kind of breathless economic_growth not seen in nearly a decade -- growth that has policy_makers and the financial markets worried that the economy is overheating . Simply put , American manufacturers , who just 10 years ago evoked images of inefficiency and obsolescence , are enjoying a revival . But , unlike in past expansions , they are not meeting demand by putting_up new factories or opening shuttered ones . Nor are they hiring many_more workers . Instead , they are reconfiguring plants , adopting lean manufacturing techniques and buying automated , versatile equipment . &quot; Our customers are looking_to do more with less , &quot; said Stephen Peterson , Giddings vice_president of sales . As recently as three years ago , the Giddings plant here , in a blue-collar suburb northeast of Detroit , employed 1 # 200 people . Today , there are fewer than half that many , but the smaller work_force is shipping almost as_many automated machine_tools out the door . &quot; Real growth . . . is coming from productivity driven by capital spending , &quot; said David Littman , chief economist of Comerica , a Detroit-based bank holding company . Littman ' s conservative estimate is that capital spending will rise 13 % this year . The Commerce_Department reported Thursday that companies are increasing investment in plants and equipment to the highest level in five years . One reason : The average age of metalworking machinery in U.S. plants is 10 years , older than at any time since 1941 . To remain competitive , factories simply must replace aging equipment . Not everyone is thriving , of course . Aerospace and other defense industries are reeling from cuts_in the Pentagon budget . California and the Northeast , with manufacturing bases much more reliant_on military contracts , have not felt the expansion as much as the Midwest and the South . &quot; It ' s a complete flip-flop from a decade ago , &quot; said Diane Swonk , economist for First Chicago National_Bank . Another difference from 10 years ago : This expansion has been a feeble producer of jobs , particularly in manufacturing . Overall , employment decreased in 1991 and 1992 and grew only 1.6 % last year . The Commerce_Department estimates that half of the 120 manufacturing industries expected to show growth in sales this year will also cut employment . &quot; I know of no similar period when there has been such a reluctance to add employment to meet demand , &quot; Littman said . Layoffs by major employers continue ; an estimated 186 # 000 jobs were cut by big companies in the first nine weeks of the year . The firings are concentrated among companies that are still restructuring , embracing new technology or facing stiff price_competition , as in the computer_industry . But the remaking of manufacturing may be laying the groundwork for more jobs and a stronger economy in the future . Painful as the process is , productivity already has drastically improved . The Labor_Department reported this month that the productivity of U.S. workers -- output per hour worked -- was improving at the fastest rate in seven years . Such gains have been made_possible by the so-called re-engineering of U.S. factories . Many plants have cut costs and work_force . They have adopted lean production principles that emphasize quality , shorten manufacturing time and reduce inventory . They have learned how computers and other high-tech communications can make them more efficient . &quot; It ' s a technology revolution in manufacturing , &quot; Swonk said . Manufacturers have been aided by several other factors : a resurgence of consumer confidence that is creating demand , low interest_rates that have reduced the cost of capital ( though rates now are going_up ) and a weak dollar and lower trade_barriers that make exporting easier . The auto industry is leading the improvement in the manufacturing sector -- and adding jobs for the first time in years . Nearly 14 million vehicles were sold in the United States last year , up 8 % from 1992 . Growth has continued at a brisk pace through the first three months of this year , with sales of 15 million cars and trucks projected for 1994 . For the first time in 14 years , the United States is likely to produce more vehicles than Japan . Even with sales and production strong , however , the auto_makers are not opening new plants . Instead , they are increasing output by eliminating production bottlenecks , redesigning assembly_lines to make them more efficient and adding third shifts . Chrysler , for instance , recently announced it will spend $ 1.8 billion over three years to increase assembly_plant output 17 % . The company will also upgrade engine facilities , including a $ 120-million investment for new equipment to build 100 # 000 minivan engines at its Trenton , Mich. , factory . The No . 3 auto_maker is doing all this without building any new plants , although it is keeping a St . Louis plant open that was previously slated for closing . &quot; One thing we don ' t want is to get stuck_with too_much capacity , &quot; said Dennis Pawley , executive_vice_president of manufacturing . The new investments could result in 6 # 000 new jobs , as Chrysler adds new equipment and third shifts at existing plants . Another company hiring is Caterpillar , the Peoria , Ill.-based maker of construction equipment . Strong demand for its earth-moving equipment has been spurred by highway repair projects and other major construction undertakings . In three announcements since November , Caterpillar has declared its intentions to hire 1 # 000 factory_workers . Some new hires will replace workers who retired , but most are needed to meet higher than expected demand . &quot; In 1991 , Caterpillar had 10 % too many workers , &quot; Swonk said . &quot; Now it is calling_back workers in record numbers. &quot; Cummins Engines of Columbia , Ind. , is also operating_on all cylinders . The producer of heavy-duty diesel_engines for trucks has enjoyed strong profits for the past two years , after a difficult restructuring in the ' 80s . Industry-wide , the backlogged demand for tractor-trailer engines is a record 120 # 000 units . The rising demand for autos , trucks , appliances and construction equipment has boosted the machine_tool business as well -- the critical industry that builds the machines that make all other machines . Today machine_tools are the nation ' s fastest-growing manufacturing sector , according to the Commerce_Department -- a remarkable turnaround for a business devastated by foreign competition in the 1980s . More_than 900 of 1 # 400 U.S. machine toolmakers have disappeared since 1982 . The survivors , leaner and wiser , enjoyed a 32 % increase in machine_tool orders and a 13 % rise in shipments in 1993 . Last year , the United States surpassed Germany as the world ' s largest consumer of machine_tools , a trend expected to continue through 1995 . One thriving machine toolmaker is Newcor Inc. of Bloomfield Hills , Mich . The company , which makes specialty machines and precision parts for the auto and appliance industries , has enjoyed three years of record revenue and earnings . At its Wilson Automation plant in nearby Warren , Newcor recently completed a $ 40-million automated assembly system for installation at Ford Motor Co. ' s engine plant in Cleveland . The computerized system is being used to make Ford ' s new V-6 engine . Newcor ' s high-tech bent is evident in the makeup of its 250-member work_force in Warren : 170 of the employees are engineers who spend most of their time working_on computers . Newcor works closely with customers , typically forming teams early in a project to help design , engineer and build a system . The emphasis is_on flexibility -- having a machine perform more_than one function with little retooling -- and eliminating downtime . &quot; Ten years ago , a machine would be up 65 % of the time , &quot; said Richard Parkes , manager of new product sales at Wilson Automation . &quot; Today that is 85 % to 90 % of the time . And we are striving for 100 % . &quot; Just three miles north , the effort to build better machine_tools is under way at a Giddings &amp; Lewis plant . The company , based in Fond du Lac , Wis. , exemplifies the renaissance of the U.S. machine_tool industry more_than any other manufacturer . In 1987 , Giddings was losing money as a unit of Amca International of Canada . William Fife , a turnaround specialist brought_in to revive the unit , implemented a strategy aimed at broadening Giddings ' base beyond its traditional Big Three auto customers . Fife took the company public in 1989 . In 1991 , he made his boldest move -- acquiring Cross &amp; Trecker , a company twice Giddings ' size , for $ 107 million . The purchase allowed Giddings , a specialist in high-end automated systems , to expand into less costly machines and gain entry into Europe . Giddings aggressively cut costs , cut Cross ' staff and developed new products by merging the expertise of the two companies . Productivity almost doubled . The result : steadily higher sales and hefty profits . Last year , the company earned $ 43 million on sales of $ 517 million . In Fraser , a team of Giddings engineers is working with Chrysler to design manufacturing solutions to reduce production time for a 1998 replacement for the car_maker ' s LH-model sedans . &quot; We have targets here to shrink the manufacturing time , &quot; said plant manager Ed Schenk , who has spent 25 years in the manufacturing trenches . &quot; It ' s a competitive advantage to be faster. &quot;</TEXT>
