   <HEADLINE> THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD : NORCO ' S GENTIS IS OVERLOOKED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Things could not have gone any better for Shane Gentis last football_season . The senior rushed for 1 # 571 yards , added 754 yards in receptions and scored 28 touchdowns to help lead Norco to an undefeated season . For his efforts , Gentis was voted to the All-Southern Section team and selected as the Riverside County player of the year . But all this was not enough to obtain a Division I college scholarship . Gentis was ignored last Wednesday on national letter-of-intent day . Three of his teammates signed with Arizona State . &quot; This is the hardest thing I ' ve ever had to deal with , &quot; Gentis said . &quot; I know I ' m good_enough , but the recruiters think different. &quot; Gentis ' main problem is size . He is 5 feet 8 and 195 pounds . He runs the 40-yard dash in 4.6 seconds . Recruiters prefer backs that size to be able to run the 40 in 4.2 or 4.3. Although he received letters of interest from many major colleges , Gentis said the attention started to wane in November . He took a paid visit to Colorado State two weeks ago , but after he arrived there coaches told him they did not have a scholarship available . &quot; When I got_back from that trip , I realized that college coaches didn ' t think I was good_enough , &quot; Gentis said . &quot; It really hit me hard. &quot; He might attend junior_college in the fall or try to join a lower-division college program . He could also be a walk-on at a big school . There are other notable players without scholarships , including quarterback Seka Edwards of Westchester , offensive tackle Jason Rempel of Calabasas and running backs Enrico Bozman of Los Alamitos and Chris Johnson of Saugus . * Dean Bradshaw , boys ' basketball_coach at Simi Valley , has been suspended for the remainder of the season for shoving one of his players during a game against Westlake on Jan . 14 . The decision was made by officials of the Simi Valley Unified School District last Thursday . Bradshaw , who was suspended after the incident , was told of the punishment Friday . Bradshaw , in his sixth year as coach , shoved senior reserve guard Sam Rodriguez to the floor for apparently not playing well in the fourth quarter of the Westlake game . &quot; I regret the incident and I apologize to the Simi Valley community and Sam Rodriguez , &quot; said Bradshaw , who will return to his coaching_job at the end of the season . Simi Valley ( 15-6 ) will be coached by Brian Saunders , a local attorney who has worked with many of the players in youth basketball_leagues . Saunders took_over two weeks ago and is 3-1 . * Security has been increased and tickets limited for Wednesday night ' s boys ' basketball_game between Gardena Serra and Santa Monica St . Monica . The Camino Real League showdown will begin at 7 at Serra . Arthur Hernandez , Serra ' s principal , said he has assigned two additional police_officers to the game and that the crowd will be limited to 150 fans from each school . The precautions are being taken because of a fight that broke_out between the teams in their last meeting Jan . 24 at St . Monica . Two players were ejected , and Serra Coach Dwan Hurt struck a parent who was hitting one of his players . Hernandez and Cheryl Milner , St . Monica ' s principal , were ordered by league officials to improve the atmosphere for Wednesday ' s game . Milner suggested playing before no fans , but Hernandez obtained a compromise to limit the crowd . Prep Notes The CIF State Federated Council passed a motion last week that requires the midcourt stripe to be used in girls ' basketball . Girls currently are not penalized for returning the ball to backcourt after it has been advanced to front court . The rule goes_into effect next season . . . . The San Juan Capistrano St . Margaret ' s boys ' basketball_team set a Southern Section single-game scoring record last Tuesday with a 151-35 victory over South Gate Southeast Lutheran . The record of 144 was set by Ribet Academy against Antelope Valley Christian during the 1990-91 season . . . . This is the final week of the regular season for boys ' and girls ' basketball_teams in the Southern Section . Playoff pairings will be announced this weekend . City Section basketball_teams have two more weeks left in the regular season .
