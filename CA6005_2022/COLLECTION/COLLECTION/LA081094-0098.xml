   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; IN DEVELOPMENT ; HARNESSING ENERGY ON SOLAR FILM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Converting sunlight into electricity may someday be as simple as buying a roll of what looks_like plastic_wrap at the local hardware_store , stretching it over a frame and plugging_in a_couple_of wires . A joint research effort to develop such a &quot; solar_cell on a roll &quot; has been announced by Advanced Research Development Inc. of Athol , Mass . and the Department_of_Energy ' s Argonne National Laboratory . The three-year , $ 1.8-million project aims to develop solar_energy technology that uses a film instead of layers of semiconductors to convert light into electric_power . The project would incorporate light-activated molecules developed by Argonne into an electrically conductive film developed by ARDI . Argonne ' s molecules are based on perylene dyes , which are used in photocopying and liquid_crystal_displays . While these molecules convert solar_energy into electrical_energy with greater than 99 % efficiency , it is not clear yet how much efficiency will be lost when the molecules are coupled to the film . Mama-San , Phone Home : In the United States , cellular_telephones and pagers are generally wielded by the young and the restless -- business people who need to stay in constant touch with home and office . In Japan , however , portable telephone technology may soon be deployed to help the old and the lost . Faced with a rapidly aging population -- forecasts are that by 2024 , one in every four Japanese will be 65 or older -- the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is concerned about the problem of how to locate elderly people who may wander off and become lost . One proposal is to equip elderly relatives with a personal handy phone . PHP technology would allow cordless telephones to be used outside like portable cellular_phones . In the search system envisioned , a worried relative would call the handy phone carried by a lost elderly person . Even if the person did not respond , the phone would send an automatic signal to a nearby land station equipped for PHP services and searchers would be sent_out . Land stations are expected to be situated at intervals covering a radius of 100 meters . The ministry is also testing a pager system that would flash a light when it received calls and send a message four times , asking passers-by to telephone the caller ' s number . In tests in Tokyo , however , passers-by had trouble hearing the pager.. Haste Makes Better Aluminum : Aluminum car parts have been something of a Holy_Grail for the auto industry because they are very_light and thus can cut the weight of a car and improve gasoline usage . But the components have traditionally been very difficult and costly to fashion , limiting their use to only the most expensive cars . Researchers at the Center for Materials Research at Ohio State University in Columbus have now resurrected technology from the 1950s and ' 60s that holds the promise of forming aluminum parts much more easily and cheaply . Called &quot; high-rate forming , &quot; the technique slams metal into a die at velocities of about 200 m.p.h. , which makes_it possible to take_advantage of the effects of inertia . At high speeds , inertia -- the tendency for matter in motion to move at a constant velocity -- coaxes the metal to stretch gradually rather than tear . Also , the momentum makes the metal act like a piece of clay thrown against a wall , causing it to spread easily without fracturing . Thus metals can be stretched two to five times farther than sheet_metal formed using standard techniques . Light-Emitting Plastic : Materials that turn light into electrical signals and vice versa show_up almost everywhere in daily life . Fax machines , copiers , computer monitors , fluorescent lighting , solar_cells -- even the human eye -- are based on these so-called opto-electronic materials , such_as gallium arsenide . Opto-electronic polymers , inexpensive and versatile plastics , have long existed as low-cost and convenient alternatives to conventional materials , but they have always had serious drawbacks . For one , engineers have not been very successful at controlling the amount and color of light they emit . And the polymers are inefficient , wasting a lot of energy by converting only a small fraction of one form of energy into the other . But now engineers at the University of Rochester have discovered that by blending a second type of polymer with the original , they can prevent the formation of pairs of molecules , or eximers , that do not emit_light efficiently , and instead create a material that emits light very efficiently .
