   <HEADLINE> JUSTICES APPEAR TO BACK STATE ' S DEATH_PENALTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Supreme Court indicated Tuesday it is likely to reject a claim that California ' s death_penalty law is unconstitutional and , in a separate action , upheld the state ' s definition of &quot; reasonable doubt &quot; in jury instructions . Had the court declared those instructions unconstitutional , prosecutors could have faced the daunting task of having to retry thousands of criminals who have been convicted in recent years . Defense_lawyers challenging the death_penalty ran_into a barrage of skeptical questions from the court , with Justices David H . Souter and Anthony M . Kennedy -- two potential swing votes -- defending the law because it follows the common-sense approach of telling jurors what factors &quot; are relevant to consider &quot; before imposing a punishment of death or life in prison . &quot; I don ' t see what ' s wrong with that , &quot; Souter commented . Kennedy also chided a defense_lawyer for making &quot; an amazing argument &quot; that it is better to give a juror no guidance rather than some . The high_court called the state ' s 1978 death_penalty law into doubt four months ago when it voted to hear a broad challenge to its constitutionality . Prosecutors feared an adverse decision could go so far as_to sweep aside the sentences of all 374 inmates on Death Row . But after 90 minutes of argument on Tuesday , that threat had clearly faded , and state prosecutors were visibly cheered . &quot; The argument went very well for us , &quot; state Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren said on the court steps . &quot; The questions went_in the right direction , and while you can never read too_much into an argument , it seemed to point to a favorable decision. &quot; The argument focused_on the instructions given to jurors who must sentence a convicted murderer either to death or life in prison without parole . In most states , jurors are told to &quot; weigh &quot; possible &quot; aggravating factors &quot; -- such_as whether the killer used torture , acted for financial reasons or had committed previous violent crimes . These are to be balanced against possible &quot; mitigating_circumstances , &quot; such_as whether the defendant was drunk during the crime or had a troubled childhood . Repeatedly in recent years , the high_court has said that states may_not use a &quot; vague aggravating factor &quot; to put a &quot; thumb . . . on death ' s side of the scale. &quot; But when two defense_lawyers recited those statements Tuesday and stressed that California jurors are told to &quot; weigh &quot; something as vague as &quot; the circumstances of the crime , &quot; the members of the high_court appeared to back_away from their earlier opinions . &quot; If we accept your argument , the Georgia ( capital_punishment law ) is going_to be unconstitutional , too , &quot; Souter told defense_lawyer Howard Gillingham , who represented Paul Tuilaepa , a Death Row inmate who shot four men in a Long_Beach bar in 1986 , killing one of them . Kennedy , a Sacramento native who recently authored a court opinion striking down Mississippi ' s death sentence statute as flawed , defended California ' s law as being better than those in Texas and Georgia . State Deputy Atty . Gen . William Prahl picked_up the theme , calling the state ' s law &quot; unique &quot; and a &quot; hybrid that adopts the best features &quot; of other state statutes . If Kennedy and Souter vote to affirm the state ' s law , they almost surely will be joined by the court ' s three solid defenders of capital_punishment : Chief_Justice William H . Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas . A ruling in Tuilaepa vs . California can be expected before July . Earlier in the day , state prosecutors avoided another legal nightmare when the high_court unanimously upheld California ' s jury instructions defining &quot; reasonable doubt. &quot; The state ' s definition of a &quot; reasonable doubt &quot; includes archaic and confusing terms such_as &quot; moral certainty , &quot; said Justice Sandra Day O ' Connor . &quot; But taken as_a_whole , the instructions correctly convey the concept of reasonable doubt &quot; and therefore are constitutional , she said . Everyone agrees that the Constitution requires a jury to find a defendant guilty &quot; beyond a reasonable doubt. &quot; But defining that term has long proved troublesome . A juror need not resolve every &quot; possible doubt &quot; about a defendant ' s guilt because &quot; absolute certainty in human affairs &quot; is unattainable , according to one common instruction . In 1850 , the chief_justice of the Massachusetts high_court said that a defendant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt when jurors &quot; feel an abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the charge. &quot; In 1927 , the California Legislature copied this definition into state law . Today , before a jury begins its deliberations , a judge tells the jurors that they must find the defendant &quot; guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. &quot; This means that &quot; after consideration of all_the evidence ( the jurors ) feel an abiding conviction , to a moral certainty , of the truth of the charge. &quot; Last year , a lawyer representing East Los Angeles murderer Alfred Sandoval challenged this instruction as a &quot; jurisprudential dinosaur &quot; that confuses jurors and is unfair to the accused . In the 19th Century , the phrase &quot; moral certainty &quot; referred to a factual certainty , as opposed to a philosophical conviction . But today , jurors would understand the same term to refer to their personal values and judgments , rather than the weight of the facts , said Eric Multhaup , the San Francisco defense_lawyer who filed the appeal . As a result of this confusion , a jury might vote to convict a defendant based on a gut feeling about his guilt rather than on the factual evidence , he argued . In the end , the justices agreed these jury instructions were outmoded and possibly confusing , but they upheld them nonetheless . &quot; We do not condone the use of the phrase . . . ' moral certainty , ' &quot; O ' Connor said in the case of Sandoval vs . California , 92-8894 . She voiced a warning , too . Unless California amends its criminal code and removes the references_to &quot; moral evidence &quot; and &quot; moral certainty , &quot; the high_court may well throw_out convictions based on them in the future , she said . Lungren , who personally argued the case in January , hailed Tuesday ' s decision and said it &quot; will help safeguard the criminal convictions of thousands of felons , including murderers on California ' s Death Row . Had this decision gone the other way , we would have seen a mad dash to the courts to invalidate thousands of properly obtained criminal convictions. &quot;</TEXT>
