   <HEADLINE> IMPACT OF THE FALLING DOLLAR ; TURMOIL IN THE MARKETS ; U.S. TRADE_GAP SURGES 22 % , SPARKING NEW RATE HIKE FEARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nation ' s monthly trade_deficit soared 22 % to $ 8.4 billion in April , the Commerce_Department said Tuesday , as Americans ' appetite for foreign-made goods reached record levels but sluggish economies overseas continued to hurt demand for items and services offered by U.S. companies . April ' s trade_gap was larger than most analysts had expected and left the deficit running at a $ 133.5-billion annual rate -- putting the United States on track to suffer its worst trade imbalance since a record $ 152.1-billion shortfall in 1987 . The report put even more pressure on the shaky U.S. dollar and resurrected fears that the Federal_Reserve_Board may raise interest_rates again soon in an effort to prop_up the battered greenback while keeping a lid on inflation . The dollar has been generally weak against most major foreign currencies for months . A falling dollar usually boosts America ' s export business because it makes U.S.-made goods cheaper for foreign customers to purchase . But U.S. manufacturers have yet to benefit much from the dollar ' s latest slide because many of America ' s chief trading partners -- including Japan and most European_countries -- have been suffering from prolonged recessions . &quot; The drop_in the dollar hasn ' t helped us much , because people and companies overseas just don ' t have much money to spend on anything , &quot; said Gladys Moreau of the Export Small Business Development Center , a Los Angeles-based trade group that helps small U.S. companies trying to expand their foreign sales . Overall , U.S. consumers in April spent $ 8.4 billion more on foreign goods and services than they sold to overseas customers , up 22.1 % from a $ 6.87-billion shortfall in March . * Still , Moreau and most other experts said there is no reason to panic over Tuesday ' s trade_gap report . Though U.S. exports declined a steep 4.2 % in April from March , to $ 40.29 billion , analysts noted that nearly half the decline stemmed from an unusually large drop_in sales of non-monetary gold . Sales of the gold , which is primarily used to make jewelry , had soared the month before . And though the value of_imports in April climbed 0.2 % from March to a record $ 53.6 billion , the increase was caused by a sharp jump in oil prices rather than an upswing in overall purchasing trends . &quot; The numbers really aren ' t as bad as they look , &quot; said Stephen Cooney , international trade analyst for the National Assn . of Manufacturers in Washington . &quot; All things considered , the manufacturing sector looks poised for a strong second_half of the year. &quot; Despite the widening trade_gap , Cooney noted that exports in the first four months of 1994 were running 6 % ahead of the same period last year . More important , he said , Germany ' s economy is_on the mend and Japan is showing signs of pulling_out of its recession . &quot; Manufacturers here in the U.S. should see business pick_up as Japan and the European_countries get_back on their feet and start buying our products again , &quot; Cooney said . Analysts say the nation ' s home building boom has apparently peaked and that consumer spending is_on the wane , so its manufacturing sector will have to improve if America hopes to prolong its economic expansion that began more_than two years ago . A weak dollar should ultimately benefit U.S. manufacturers by making their goods cheaper for foreign consumers to purchase , analysts said . * &quot; But a weak dollar also raises inflationary pressures , because it can cause American consumers to pay higher prices for imports and also encourage domestic manufacturers to institute price hikes of_their_own , &quot; said Gary Ciminero , chief economist of Fleet Financial Bank in Providence , R.I. As a result , Ciminero and some_other analysts said , Tuesday ' s report could put more pressure on the Federal_Reserve_Board to raise short-term interest_rates for a fifth time this year in its efforts to cool the economy and keep inflation in check . * DOLLAR SHOCK : Dollar falls amid rate hike fears .
