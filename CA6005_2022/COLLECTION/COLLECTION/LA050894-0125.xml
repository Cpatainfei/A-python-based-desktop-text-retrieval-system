   <HEADLINE> LOGICAL WAYS TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * The editorial &quot; Put the Bucks Along the Border &quot; ( April 27 ) , remarkably states that The Times has &quot; argued that it makes no sense to try to control illegal immigration &quot; at a checkpoint 62 miles inside the country . It is a remarkable statement because the argument of The Times itself makes no sense . Nowhere in the editorial does The Times set_forth how the Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) is to cope_with the thousands and thousands of aliens who are able to infiltrate the first line_of_defense at the border if there are no secondary barriers like the checkpoint if , as The Times urges , all Border_Patrol officers should be sent to the border . The 2 # 500 miles along the southern border cannot be sealed even if the government does increase the Border_Patrol significantly . Many thousands of aliens will still infiltrate illegally . The Border_Patrol cannot be at all places at all times , even with augmented personnel . A logical and necessary strategy is for INS to monitor and guard the few highways leading north from the border , and which necessarily must be used by the smugglers in transporting illegal immigrants into the hinterlands . The Times refers to the checkpoint as &quot; largely ineffective and even dangerous. &quot; The checkpoint is proximate to the border and a necessary adjunct to border immigration control . Additional immigration officers at the border may slow_down and make_it more difficult to enter illegally , but will not materially impede entry along a 2 # 500 mile stretch of border . The checkpoint must be looked_upon as an integral part of the border defense against illegal entry . Once the alien is able to get beyond the checkpoint and into the big industrial cities , it is like looking_for the proverbial needle in the haystack , as evidenced by the recent amnesty program that granted permanent residence to more_than 2 million aliens who had eluded detection for several years . The Times asserts that the checkpoint is &quot; even dangerous. &quot; It is presumed that this assertion refers to accidents that have occurred when the smuggler with a load of illegal aliens seeks to crash through the checkpoint , or it may refer to the dangers the illegal immigrant may encounter if he / she seeks to walk_around the checkpoint or through inhospitable terrain . It is a senseless disservice to U.S. law_enforcement for The Times to argue that we should walk away from our enforcement responsibilities at a checkpoint because the smuggler or the illegal alien , in the act of violating our laws and , by his own action , might encounter danger . The argument of The Times is but another example of the softness toward law violators , resulting in increased law violations and lack of respect for our laws . JOSEPH SURECK Dana Point * The editorial about the elimination of San Clemente checkpoint makes a lot of economic sense . The checkpoints in the United States are bad for business . Every time I pass_through one of them , it reminds me of a Nazi-type of government rather than a democracy . The coalition of organizations defending the undocumented workers should pressure Congress to eliminate the San Clemente checkpoint at once . At the base of these efforts are the lessons learned from the Jewish people in Germany of the 1930s : If we permit one group of workers to be used as scapegoats for the economic failures of a government without defending their rights as workers , what is to prevent us from becoming the next scapegoats ? If we do not stand together now , who will be there to stand beside us tomorrow ? JAIME B .
