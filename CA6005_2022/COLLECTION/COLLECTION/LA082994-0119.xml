   <HEADLINE> POP_MUSIC REVIEW ; AMOS EARNS DIVA WINGS , SUPPLIES OWN HALO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The traditional singer-songwriter was a species that thrived in the ' 60s and ' 70s but has been threatened in the ' 90s by a musical environment gone all grungy . Still , like salmon spawn , they keep hatching , and good albums by ' 90s-vintage arrivals such_as Vinnie James , Ben Harper , Archie Roach , Sheryl Crow , Lisa Germano and Freedy Johnston suggest that the breed hasn ' t lost its grace , its commitment or its intelligence . But with noise-rock ringing the register among most younger fans , will these newest heirs to Dylan , Newman , Mitchell , et al be hardy enough to make the swim upstream to long-term survival ? Tori Amos is one ' 90s singer-songwriter who is getting_on swimmingly . Her 1991 debut album , &quot; Little Earthquakes , &quot; went gold , and so has this year ' s follow-up , &quot; Under the Pink. &quot; Not only did she sell_out UC Irvine ' s Crawford Hall on Saturday , but the humid little gymnasium , more fit_in summer for growing tropical flowers than for staging pop concerts , rang_out with ovations and intrusive , mid-song cries of adoration . Amos , 31 , seems well equipped for survival in today ' s marketplace . Far from being a modest , unassuming songsmith , her appeal rests_on a diva ' s commanding voice and a diva ' s intense , spotlight-grabbing , somewhat pretentious bearing ( her show ' s well-conceived , frequently arresting stage lighting typically vested the beatific star in a full-body halo ) . The jarring dynamics that became a staple for Nirvana and other popular full-on rockers have their parallel in Amos ' shows , even though she plays as a soloist , self-accompanied on an acoustic grand_piano . Many songs in her 90-minute set found her rising from delicate reveries to keening , tortured cries and back to dramatic whispers . Amos also has a theme that ' s ripe for ' 90s consumption : the struggle for empowerment . She is too ambitious an artist to address this pop-psychology concept in bland , psychobabble lingo . Still , what you get_in Amos ' lyrics are fragmentary glimpses of characters struggling to don the vestments of full personhood . They confront crippling self-doubts and murmur to themselves in the aftermath of relationships in which they have been treated or , worse , allowed themselves to be treated , as inferiors . Then there ' s &quot; Me and a Gun , &quot; Amos ' memorable , first-person account of a rape in which the victim , stripped of all power but the power over her own thoughts , is seen playing whatever mental tricks she can to hold onto a sense of self and a will to live through the violation . Having found an audience , the question now is whether Amos knows what to do with it . &quot; Under the Pink &quot; shows alarming signs that it may be going_to her head . While the album is by no means a washout , it ends on a terribly sour note , with empty songs like &quot; Cloud on My Tongue , &quot; &quot; Space Dog &quot; and the bloated blather of the 9 1 / 2-minute &quot; Yes , Anastasia. &quot; These fail to register even fragmentary meaning ; they are purely inscrutable , suggesting either that Amos lacked the songwriting stamina to finish_off her second album , or that she has become so full of herself that she thinks an audience will swallow anything she sings , so_long as it comes couched in that intensity , carried by that voice . In short , if Amos as commodity looks well-established , the jury was still out on Amos as artist . * Even to a skeptic , the show at Crawford Hall offered powerful testimony in her favor . She cropped_out all_the empty filler from &quot; Under the Pink , &quot; choosing six substantive songs from it . ( Well , &quot; Cornflake Girl &quot; is as inscrutable as she gets , but the song worked_on the strength of its musical_drama . Amos ' darting , classically informed piano sallies gave it a sense of freedom and unpredictability that allowed her to get_away with the questionable ploy of performing it to a canned backing track culled from the album . &quot; God , &quot; the only other song using similarly prepackaged ingredients , didn ' t fare as well. ) Over a long closing stretch that encompassed nearly half the concert , Amos earned the right to a diva ' s pretensions by doing what divas are supposed to do : She created a sustained , unbroken , fully involving moment of heightened passion . It was an unsparing sequence , filled with songs of deep sadness and loss , starting with &quot; Bells for Her , &quot; which she played_on an upright_piano rigged to produce the delicate , hollow-ringing sounds of Chinese bells . The a cappella &quot; Me and a Gun &quot; was next -- a song as unsparing as they come . Conventional concertizing would call_for an eventual upward reach after that , moving from the song ' s stark depths toward an eventual affirmation later in the show . But Amos , who had played her few humorous , music-hallish cards early in the concert ( &quot; Leather , &quot; &quot; Happy Phantom , &quot; &quot; The Waitress &quot; ) , continued to survey inner damage on the next song , the set-closing &quot; Baker , Baker. &quot; * Through three encores , she kept the momentum going . A luminous cover of Stevie Nicks ' Fleetwood Mac-vintage ballad , &quot; Landslide , &quot; was the closest she came_to affirmation , but it was only an affirmation of the will to endure loss . &quot; Winter , &quot; one of her loveliest songs , came next , with its glimpse of a father ' s desperately impatient attempt to get_through to an apparently depressive daughter . Encore three was a haunting meditation on the dismal side of rock history , linking Buddy Holly ' s accidental death with Kurt Cobain ' s self-inflicted one . Amos , a minister ' s daughter who loves waxing ironic about Christian iconography , began with the quietly ironic fragment of Don McLean ' s &quot; American Pie &quot; in which &quot; the three men I admire most , the Father , Son and the Holy_Ghost &quot; are seen giving_up their own faith on &quot; the day the music died. &quot; Then , with spectral circles of light swirling about her , she moved_into a ghostly reading of Nirvana ' s &quot; Smells Like Teen Spirit , &quot; giving poor Cobain the only thing in anyone ' s power to give : a properly mournful wake in which his own sad music was kept alive . This grieving show-closer was far from an affirmation , but it was something more_than a denial . In all , a memorable display of power , depth , taste and thoughtful linkages of meaning consistent with a real contender , rather than a lucky diva of the hour . Amos ' handpicked opening act , Bill Miller , is a Native_American from Wisconsin . His message was both anguished and stirring . His songs lamented the historic disaster that befell his people , and in &quot; Trail of Freedom &quot; he didn ' t flinch from reporting on such lingering effects as the widespread alcoholism among Native_Americans . But the songs , drawn mainly from Miller ' s major-label debut , &quot; The Red Road , &quot; also carried the conviction that the story isn ' t over . He envisioned a rebirth of Native_American culture , founded on enduring spiritual values and a tenacious national character . Certainly nothing in his fervent , kinetic , hard-strumming performance would belie that message . Backed by Hans Mayer , a capable bass and mandolin player , the sturdy-voiced Miller offered familiarly structured folk-rock anthems and laments geared for the mainstream , but also injected traditional strains with bracing tribal chants and a haunting flute air . His raw but focused music , full of driving , elemental acoustic_guitar solos , had far more clout live than on his comparatively tame album . Miller was personable , inserting musical jokes to set the audience at_ease ( although a brief , laugh-drawing interlude from &quot; Stairway to Heaven &quot; was out_of_place in the middle of his powerful prayer-song , &quot; Praises &quot; ) . The only thing you could really fault him for was a tenuous grip on Orange County surf-rock history : introducing a wryly conceived acoustic version of &quot; Pipeline , &quot; which he said was one of the first songs he learned as a kid , he described the Chantays original as a Ventures tune . On the other hand , we ' d hate to face a pop_quiz on the history of Miller ' s tribe , the Mohicans . The sound in Crawford Hall , where punk and alternative bands go_to drown in acoustic murk , was adequate for Amos and Miller . The gym , set_up for reserved seating , was far more hospitable with chairs on the floor in lieu of the customary mosh pit . But the muggy heat was awful . There must be a better place in Orange County for serious , singer-songwriter-type acts with a draw of 2 # 000 to 4 # 000 fans . Maybe the Orange County Performing Arts Center will one day see fit to work with established rock promoters on this sort of show ; the politics of the pop concert industry make_it very unlikely that OCPAC can program contemporary artists such_as Amos on its own . Another possibility is the dormant Pacific Amphitheatre . Under Nederlander , its former operator , the Pacific proved itself a fine venue for scaled-down shows by such theater-level performers as Tracy Chapman , Carole King , Bruce Hornsby , the Chieftains and an acoustic Neil Young . The Orange County Fair , which now controls the Pacific , would be doing a public_service by resuming those smaller-scale , won ' t-disturb-the-neighbors shows at the amphitheater .</TEXT>
