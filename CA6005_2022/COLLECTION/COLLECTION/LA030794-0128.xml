   <HEADLINE> U.S. ENVISIONS NEW MILITARY TIES TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the midst of the Clinton_Administration ' s conflicts with China over human_rights , the Pentagon is preparing a series of important steps to upgrade America ' s defense ties with Beijing , including possible joint U.S.-Chinese military cooperation in Asia , according to Pentagon officials . The military cooperation , aimed at reassuring the People ' s Liberation Army that the United States does not consider it an adversary , would begin with peacekeeping operations or joint U.S.-Chinese disaster relief in places such_as Central Asia . As envisioned by Pentagon officials , military_units of the two countries would work together to set_up joint command_posts or temporary airfields . Other steps envisioned by the Pentagon include the creation of a Joint Commission on Defense Conversion to discuss how to transform Chinese and U.S. defense industries from military to civilian use ; and regular or annual meetings between America ' s defense_secretary and China ' s defense minister . These steps could be discussed or even finalized during Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher ' s trip to China , which begins Friday . A Pentagon source said Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner will accompany Christopher to Beijing in what would be the highest-level visit by a U.S. defense official since China ' s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing . Wisner ' s visit to Beijing has not been officially confirmed , however , and it is possible that it could be postponed because of the Administration ' s unhappiness with China ' s recent arrests of several dissidents . At a Hong Kong news_conference Sunday , Assistant Secretary_of_State John Shattuck said the detentions &quot; cast a pall over Secretary Christopher ' s visit to Beijing. &quot; So the Pentagon ' s plans to upgrade ties with China illustrate some of the complexities , mixed signals and contradictions of the Clinton_Administration ' s current China policy . During the 1992 campaign , Clinton attacked the George_Bush Administration for &quot; coddling dictators &quot; in China and other countries . And after taking_office , Clinton signed an order that made the annual extension of China ' s &quot; most favored nation &quot; trading benefits conditional on improvements in the human_rights climate in China . Clinton must decide by June what to do about China ' s MFN status . But while the Administration has taken a relatively strong public position on human_rights , both the Pentagon and officials at the National Economic Council have been pressing hard for more conciliatory policies toward China . In a speech two weeks ago to the Asia Society in Washington , Assistant Defense_Secretary Charles W . Freeman Jr . characterized Clinton ' s 1992 campaign statements merely as &quot; strong rhetoric. &quot; He said these election-year statements were among the &quot; irritants &quot; in U.S.-China relations that the Administration has been trying to smooth_over . &quot; We in the Department_of_Defense don ' t spend a lot of time worrying about China , &quot; Freeman said in the speech . &quot; We don ' t see it as a threat , particularly . . . . We see it as an opportunity. &quot; After the 1989 crackdown on protesters , the United States cut_off all ties between U.S. military officials and the Chinese army . Last fall , after an intensive internal review of China policy , the Administration re-established the military contacts as part of a series of measures aimed at_easing tensions between Washington and Beijing . From the Pentagon ' s point_of_view , better ties with Beijing would help prevent China from turning_into a troublesome adversary . China is in the middle of a defense buildup , and U.S. military officials see China as the future power of Asia . Pentagon officials believe that leaders of the People ' s Liberation Army can be influential in determining the outcome of a number of potential flash_points in Asia , including the nuclear crisis in North_Korea , conflicting territorial claims in the South_China_Sea , continuing instability in Central Asia and the persistent conflict between India and Pakistan .
