   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : SPECIAL REPORT / HOT TIPS ; WHAT ' S COMING , WHEN , AND WHY IT ' S A BIG DEAL ; NEXT YEAR COULD BRING START OF ON-LINE PROFITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If 1993 was the year businesses figured_out what the Internet was and 1994 the year they learned how to use it , 1995 will be the year corporations actually make some money on the global computer_network . With the emphasis on some . Electronic commerce -- currently crude and not yet secure -- will come_of_age next year as entrepreneurial firms such_as Vienna , Va.-based Cybercash and Mountain View-based Netscape Communications team_up with banking heavyweights the_likes_of Wells Fargo and Bank of America to ensure secure transactions . By early in the first_quarter of ' 95 , analysts expect consumers will be able to make purchases over the network without exposing their credit_card numbers -- a turning point in the evolution of the Internet that will lead to perhaps 30 # 000 electronic &quot; storefronts &quot; opening by year ' s end -- a tenfold increase over the current number . The volume of traffic over the World Wide Web portion of the Internet , which allows_for graphics display and audio , is expected to catch_up_with and exceed fax traffic in 1995 . At the same time , federal law_enforcement officials are getting ready for a wave of digital terrorism far more sophisticated than anything the teen-age &quot; hacker &quot; has wrought , as corporations and whole nations begin to engage in on-line espionage . With the added capability of digital cash and credit transactions , the Internet increasingly will compete with major commercial on-line services , which will be forced to lower prices and reorient their core businesses . Experts differ , however , as_to just how they will be reshaped . Most look_for increasing integration of the services into the Internet itself and , via new cable modems that will be available to consumers beginning next year , over the cable network . The commercial services together have about 5 million subscribers now ; by the end of next year several forecasts have that number more_than doubling . The largest , Prodigy Services Co . with 2.3 million members , has made the deepest forays_into the cable industry and is expected to offer its service over several systems in 1995 . America Online , the fastest-growing service , aims to leverage its experience with the less technically literate consumer to reposition itself as a friendly Internet access provider and a packager of on-line entertainment and information . All the major services will come_out with new user_interfaces , which will likely incorporate the language of the World Wide Web -- an acknowledgment that they must be compatible with the broader Internet , whose user base is expected to reach 45 million , in_order to be competitive . Still , some analysts say , that will not be enough . &quot; In 1995 we ' ll see the death_knell of commercial services like CompuServe , &quot; said Michael Strangelove , publisher of the Internet Business Journal . Microsoft ' s sally into the on-line services business will dramatically affect the year for everyone else . The Microsoft Network , packaged with a new version of Windows , is expected to wreak havoc with the structure of the on-line services_industry . But most do not expect to see it until late in 1995 . Interchange , the on-line service developed by Ziff-Davis before it was sold , may or may_not materialize , depending_on whether it finds a buyer . And the degree to which business prospers on-line anywhere ultimately will depend_on the quality of the goods offered -- and their presentation . In the meantime , young techies may be the only ones spending their money on line . Says Bruce Ryon , an analyst with the San Jose-based consulting firm Dataquest : &quot; The Internet will be a great way to sell in 1995 -- to college kids , mostly. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) DIGITAL SHOPPING What : Secure electronic transactions When : Early next year Why it ' s important : Will make the Internet safe for commerce .</TEXT>
