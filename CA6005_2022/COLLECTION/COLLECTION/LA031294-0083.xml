   <HEADLINE> CHRISTOPHER IN BEIJING ; MOOD TENSE ; ASIA : IN CHINA FOR HUMAN_RIGHTS DISCUSSIONS , HE MAKES NO STATEMENT AT THE AIRPORT AND REJECTS BANQUET OFFERS . HIS ARRIVAL IS FURTHER MARRED BY A SHOVING MATCH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a tense atmosphere that reflected the shaky state of U.S.-Chinese relations , a somber Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher landed in Beijing on Friday night on a mission to try to change human_rights policies in the world ' s most populous country . It was clear immediately upon Christopher ' s arrival that neither the Chinese government nor the United States was in any mood for politeness , smiles or routine diplomatic formalities . State_Department officials disclosed on Christopher ' s plane before landing that they had scrubbed plans for the secretary_of_state to make an arrival statement . They also rejected Chinese offers of a banquet on the trip and decided that he would not visit China ' s best-known tourist attraction , the Great Wall . &quot; He ( Christopher ) wants to set a tone that is focused_on the business he is here to do , &quot; spokesman Mike McCurry explained . On Friday , Chinese security officials rounded up two more dissidents , Yang Zhou and Wang Fuchen of the Assn . for Human_Rights in Shanghai . Yang was released this morning . The Chinese government had detained several other dissidents in the 10 days before Christopher ' s arrival . Most of the dissidents were later released . As Christopher was walking_off the plane , a brief shoving match broke_out between American and Chinese security aides . &quot; Is this how the visit ' s going_to go ? Is this how the visit ' s going_to go ? &quot; shouted one of the American officials to his Chinese counterpart . Christopher ' s trip is designed to try to persuade Chinese leaders that they must change their policies to show &quot; overall significant progress &quot; on human_rights , as President Clinton required in an executive order last year . If China fails to do so , it could lose trade privileges that permit Chinese goods to be imported into the United States at low tariff rates . Months ago , when Christopher ' s trip to Beijing was first being planned , State_Department officials imagined that he would calmly encourage Chinese leaders to show the United States that they are making progress . But China ' s recent arrests and detentions of democracy advocates have changed the tone and the politics surrounding the visit . Clinton_Administration officials now find themselves on the defensive , trying to come_to grips with a Chinese leadership that does not seem to care what the U.S._government says or thinks_about its human_rights policies . &quot; Obviously , it ' s not the same situation as it was two weeks ago , &quot; when Christopher ' s visit to Beijing was announced , Assistant Secretary_of_State Winston Lord said . &quot; But the purpose of the trip remains the same : to carry our message ( on human_rights ) directly to the Chinese leaders. &quot; Speaking_to reporters on Christopher ' s plane as it flew from Tokyo to Beijing , Lord seemed to be trying to downplay expectations for any immediate human_rights improvements . &quot; There may be results in the wake of the trip , but not while we ' re there , &quot; he said . Christopher is to spend today in meetings with top Chinese officials , including Foreign Minister Qichen Qian , Premier Li Peng and President Jiang Zemin . He is scheduled to meet with American business_executives Sunday and may see a group of Chinese lawyers interested in reform of the legal_system . Other American officials will hold their own separate sessions with Chinese leaders on issues such_as the proliferation of weapons and defense conversion . Christopher ' s delegation includes Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner , the highest-level official from the Pentagon to visit Beijing since a 1988 visit by then-Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci . While human_rights issues will be the most important subject , Lord emphasized that &quot; there will be a broader agenda , &quot; including discussions with Chinese leaders on North_Korea ' s nuclear program . Before Friday , Christopher had been in China on only one occasion , a 1985 trip with a group of lawyers while he was in private law_practice in Los Angeles . Shortly after his arrival Friday night , he went_to the U.S. Embassy to get an update on the situation in China and to prepare_for today ' s meetings . The embassy has a special room protected against monitoring devices , called &quot; the bubble , &quot; in which American officials can talk without fear of being overheard . Christopher ' s decision not to attend any Chinese banquets during his trip is rooted in the turmoil the events have caused in the last five years of high-level visits by American leaders . When American officials invited a dissident to one banquet with then-President George_Bush , it proved politically unacceptable to the Chinese regime . In December , 1989 , six months after the Chinese government ' s deadly crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing , the Bush_Administration dispatched National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary_of_State Lawrence S . Eagleburger to the Chinese capital on a mission of reconciliation . The two men were photographed in a warm banquet toast to Chinese leaders . The furor in the United States over the symbolism of that toast galvanized Congress to press for tougher U.S. action on human_rights in China . The most prominent critics of Scowcroft ' s banquet toast included Clinton , who in 1992 accused the Bush_Administration of &quot; coddling dictators , &quot; and Lord , a veteran Republican appointee . &quot; It ' s pretty ironic , when you think_about it , &quot; one U.S. official said Friday . &quot; It ' s five years after Tian An Men ( the 1989 crackdown on demonstrations for democracy ) , and the relationship ( between the United States and China ) is in more dire straits now than it has ever been. &quot;</TEXT>
