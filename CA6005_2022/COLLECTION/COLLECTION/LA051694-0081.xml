   <HEADLINE> FRANCE , BRITAIN AVOID COLLISION OVER AIR RIGHTS ; TRANSPORTATION : THE LAST-MINUTE ACCORD GIVES BRITISH CARRIERS ACCESS TO ORLY AIRPORT IN PARIS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> France and Britain on Sunday narrowly avoided a showdown over landing rights at Paris ' s Orly airport , resolving a dispute that threatened to escalate into a commercial air war . An accord reached by the two nations will give British carriers access to Orly , as demanded , but will allow the_French some time to adjust to the change , which could hurt France ' s already-hobbled state-owned carriers . It will also assure better French access to Heathrow and other London airports . The agreement halted a show of force planned for today by British airlines . The carriers had said they would fly to Orly despite France ' s refusal of access . Ten flights were reportedly scheduled to participate . They will now be sent to Charles de Gaulle airport . &quot; There will be no British planes arriving tonight or tomorrow &quot; at Orly , French Transport Minister Bernard Bosson said in a Sunday radio interview . A joint statement issued by Bosson and his British counterpart , John MacGregor , said the two agreed to open_air traffic to Orly and to London airports as soon as possible and &quot; at the latest by the end of June. &quot; British airlines said the accord amounted to victory . &quot; Our objective all along was to secure our right to fly to Orly and we have done that , &quot; British Airways chairman Sir Colin Marshall said . TAT European Airlines , British Airways ' French subsidiary , said it was pleased to &quot; note that the_French government is committed to respecting the decision &quot; by the European Union Commission , which ordered France to open Orly to British carriers . British Airways and TAT said they are confident that daily flights to Orly will start well before the June deadline . British Airways plans four flights a day from Heathrow to Orly . TAT is also planning four daily flights . Air U.K. plans six . The trouble began April 27 , when the European Union ordered France to open Orly to British airlines . Complaints by state-run Air France and Air Inter , which carries passengers within France , pushed the_French government toward a political crisis with Britain . British airlines , which land at Charles de Gaulle airport , had hoped to capture some of the lucrative market of passengers flying from elsewhere in France through Orly . Those flights have traditionally been reserved for Air Inter , a subsidiary of Air France . France announced Wednesday that it would not comply with the ruling and that flights by British Airways , TAT and Air U.K. between London and Orly would be considered illegal . Paris argued that the European Court of Justice had to rule on France ' s appeal of the European Union ruling before Orly was opened . The dispute was the latest clash within the European Union over efforts to lower trade_barriers within the 12-nation trading bloc and spur competition . France has_on several occasions been caught between its policy to promote European unity and its wish to protect certain sectors of its economy . Competition has already hobbled Air France . The carrier lost about $ 1.4 billion last year . Bosson called the air agreement balanced , saying it will allow the opening of Orly to British carriers &quot; without haste , &quot; permitting the two countries to resolve issues of safety , environment and congestion . The British , in return , &quot; have agreed to work with us on a balanced opening of London airports , particularly Heathrow , &quot; Bosson said . The discord came amid newly achieved harmony between France and Britain after the recent opening of the Channel_Tunnel .</TEXT>
