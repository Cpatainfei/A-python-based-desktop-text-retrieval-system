   <TEXT> As hundreds of worshipers filed into the First African Methodist Episcopal Church , Los Angeles ' oldest and most prominent black congregation , several dozen protesters stood across the street , waving picket signs . One read : &quot; The snitch got_to go . Free Geronimo. &quot; The demonstrators were an unsettling challenge to a venerable institution , and their target on that Sunday in January was no less than the 61-year-old chairman of First A.M.E. ' s Board of Trustees : Julius C . ( Julio ) Butler . Butler ' s route to that prominent position has included a series of sharply contrasting stops . He has been a Marine sergeant , a Los Angeles County sheriff ' s deputy , a hairstylist known as &quot; Mr. Julio , &quot; a Black Panther , a City_Council aide , an early campaign volunteer for former Mayor Tom Bradley and a legal aid attorney . But the demonstrators were focusing_on another role Butler played , one that is rooted in the political turbulence of the 1960s . He was the linchpin in the murder case against Elmer G . ( Geronimo ) Pratt , a former Los Angeles Black Panther Party leader . Pratt , who was convicted in 1972 and sentenced to life in prison , maintains that the FBI knows he is innocent because agents had him under surveillance in Oakland when the murder was committed in Santa Monica . Butler testified that Pratt had confessed to him that he shot a teacher and her husband during a 1968 robbery . Butler said Pratt discussed &quot; the mission &quot; with him before the crime , admitted later that evening that he had shot the couple , and confirmed his role the next day . The woman died days later . Her husband , who was critically wounded , recovered . The jury , however , did not know what documents released more_than seven years after the trial would disclose : Butler was not merely a disgruntled former Panther associate of Pratt ' s . He was giving information to the FBI . Butler , who denies he was an informant , gave testimony so critical that three jurors who convicted Pratt say they would have regarded Butler ' s account as less credible and would have held_out for acquittal if they had known of Butler ' s relationship with the FBI . In addition , a retired FBI_agent has maintained for years that Pratt is innocent , and that he was framed by the bureau as part of the FBI ' s infamous and now-defunct Counter Intelligence Program ( COINTELPRO ) -- covert efforts to &quot; neutralize &quot; organizations the bureau called &quot; black hate groups. &quot; Despite a stack of FBI memos that spell_out the information he provided to agents beginning in 1969 , three years before Pratt ' s trial , Butler insists he was not an informant and has steadfastly refused to comment on his apparent relationship with the FBI . At Pratt ' s trial , he testified that &quot; the connotation ( of ) informant means a snitch , and I have never been in the world a snitch. &quot; &quot; I still say I stand_by the testimony , &quot; Butler said in a recent telephone_interview from his office at Bet Tzedek legal services in the Fairfax district . He declined to comment further . The FBI consistently has maintained there was no conspiracy to frame Pratt . Pratt ' s conviction has long been a cause_celebre for political and social_groups that say it symbolizes a legal_system that was twisted to prosecute a political enemy . To have Butler near the helm of First A.M.E. , which has gained citywide prominence since the 1992 riots , troubles some in the 9 # 000-member church . &quot; How can a church that is a beacon in the black community have this person with this history as chairman ? &quot; asks one member . Clearly , that question does not disturb many others . Shortly after the January demonstration , the church ' s 3 # 500-member men ' s group rallied behind Butler , expressing its support in a formal vote_of_confidence . First A.M.E. ' s charismatic pastor , Rev . Cecil L . ( Chip ) Murray , did not respond to requests for an interview . He was made aware of Butler ' s role in the conviction , according to a knowledgeable church source . He approved the elevation of Butler , a member since 1987 , to the church ' s board , then to the chairmanship . Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , one of Pratt ' s early defense_lawyers , said Butler is &quot; passing himself off as this pillar of the community . An innocent man is in jail . If you ' re a real Christian , I don ' t know how you can live with that . And I don ' t think you can just stonewall it forever. &quot; Recent efforts to free Pratt have drawn new attention to Butler ' s role in the trial . Los Angeles Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti is reviewing the case , prompted by crusading lay minister Jim McCloskey , who submitted a detailed report arguing Pratt ' s innocence . McCloskey , who heads New Jersey-based Centurion Ministries , drew national attention in 1992 after he helped gain the release of Clarence Chance and Benny Powell , Los Angeles men who spent 17 years in prison after they were wrongfully convicted of murdering a sheriff ' s deputy . The Pratt controversy has created ironies for First A.M.E. Murray was one of several Los Angeles clergymen who filed a friend-of-the-court brief in 1980 supporting a new trial for Pratt . Early this year , after FBI_agents foiled a skinhead plot to foment a race war by launching an armed attack on First A.M.E , Murray and other church officials held a Sunday service to thank the agents . Among those expressing gratitude was Butler . The FBI ' s work , Butler told a reporter afterward , &quot; has given us the beginnings of a new relationship with the current administration of the FBI. &quot; * The story of Geronimo Pratt and Julio Butler goes_back a quarter-century , to an era when the Black Panthers frightened and outraged much of Middle America . Clad in their signature black berets and black leather jackets , the Panthers openly armed themselves and marched through the streets shouting : &quot; Off the pigs. &quot; They reveled in their image as urban_guerrillas defending the black community from police abuses . Then-FBI Director J . Edgar Hoover labeled them &quot; the greatest threat to the internal security of the country. &quot; A U.S. Senate committee on intelligence_activities found that the FBI ' s COINTELPRO effort originally targeted organizations like the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and leaders such_as Martin_Luther_King Jr . But by 1967 , the bureau had made the Panthers its primary target , the committee reported . In Southern California , the report said , the FBI ' s covert action exacerbated an existing &quot; gang war &quot; between the Panthers and US ( United Slaves ) , led by militant black nationalist Ron Karenga . That war resulted in the killing of four Panthers by US members and in &quot; numerous beatings and shootings , &quot; the committee reported . Butler joined the Panthers in the summer of 1968 -- a relatively late entry into radical politics for a man who had started his working life in the military and law_enforcement . Butler would not discuss his personal life in an interview . But according to court documents , he was born in Los Angeles , graduated from Jefferson High_School in 1950 , joined the Marines a year later and saw duty in the Korean_War , where he was wounded . He was married that same year . Butler was discharged in 1954 , and he was divorced the next year . He studied criminology at Los Angeles City College and became a sheriff ' s deputy in 1956 . But he resigned in 1960 , citing problems from a second marriage that also ended in divorce . In 1964 , state records show , he was issued a cosmetology license . Using the name Mr. Julio , he opened a shop on Adams Boulevard in 1966 . Two years later , he joined the Panthers , quickly becoming the party ' s Southern California security chief . Pratt , a decorated Vietnam veteran from Louisiana , became a Panther the same year . He enrolled at UCLA , where he was recruited by local Panther leaders Alprentice ( Bunchy ) Carter and John Huggins . Three months after his arrival , an event occurred that would shape the rest of Pratt ' s life : On Dec . 18 , 1968 , Caroline Olsen , 27 , was fatally shot and her husband , Kenneth , 33 , was critically wounded in a robbery that netted about $ 30 on a Santa Monica tennis_court . Soon after , the Panthers were thrown into turmoil . In January , 1969 , gunmen belonging_to Karenga ' s US killed Carter and Huggins on the UCLA campus . Pratt , then 21 , succeeded the iron-fisted , charismatic Carter as local party head . That set_in_motion a rivalry with Butler , who later testified that he grew to &quot; dislike &quot; Pratt . Butler saw his authority for security reduced to a small area near the Crenshaw district . By the spring of 1969 , according to FBI documents , Butler had grown more dissatisfied with the direction the Panthers were taking . About that time , he began providing information to FBI_agents , documents said . Tensions between Pratt and Butler rose , and by Aug . 5 Pratt had &quot; probably &quot; expelled Butler from the party , an FBI memo said . Five days later , Butler wrote an &quot; insurance &quot; letter that implicated Pratt in Olsen ' s murder . In it , Butler said he had written the letter to protect himself against death threats by Pratt and other Panthers . He delivered the letter , to be opened &quot; only in the event of my death , &quot; to a man he described in testimony as a friend , Los Angeles Police Sgt . DuWayne Rice . By January , 1970 , the Los Angeles FBI office had sought permission from headquarters for a counterintelligence effort &quot; designed to challenge the legitimacy of the authority exercised &quot; by Pratt in the local Panthers , according to documents released later . Another FBI memo dated five months later noted that the bureau was constantly considering counterintelligence measures designed to neutralize Pratt &quot; as an effective ( Panther ) functionary. &quot; In the fall of 1970 , Butler ' s letter resurfaced under circumstances that seemed to show he had been in contact with the FBI . Unknown to Rice , Butler had told agents about the letter three days after giving it to Rice , according to FBI documents and a sworn statement Rice made to Pratt ' s attorneys . The letter contained information that could put Panthers in the gas_chamber , Butler told agents , according to an FBI memo . When agents asked Rice for the letter , he refused to turn it over without Butler ' s permission . In seeking that permission , Rice said in his statement , he asked Butler how the agents knew about the letter . Butler said he told agents about it because they were pressuring him , Rice said . The letter implicating Pratt in Olsen ' s murder became the cornerstone of the prosecution case against Pratt . Within two months , he was indicted . * In his defense and ongoing appeals , Pratt has contended that he was in Oakland at a weeklong series of party meetings when Olsen was killed . Proving that should have been simple enough by having others who attended the meetings testify that Pratt was there . But by the time Pratt was tried , three years after the murder , he had been expelled from the party for siding with former Panther Minister of Information Eldridge Cleaver , who had broken_with Panther leader Huey P . Newton . Newton forbade any Panthers from testifying on Pratt ' s behalf , although several people in Oakland supported Pratt ' s alibi . Cleaver ' s wife , Kathleen , testified that Pratt was in Oakland . But three years after the fact she could not specifically place his whereabouts on the day Olsen was slain . In sworn statements two years ago , Panther co-founder Bobby Seale and former Panther official David Hilliard did place Pratt in Oakland on the day of the murder . Pratt has argued that on that day the FBI had a wiretap on phones at the Panthers ' Los Angeles headquarters . Wiretap logs would show that Pratt had several conversations from Oakland with the headquarters on Central Avenue , his attorneys say . The trouble is that , despite the FBI ' s history of documenting its wiretaps , no logs from that wiretap have been located . In 1985 , the agent who had been assigned to Pratt testified at an appellate_court hearing that he had no knowledge of a wiretap on Panther headquarters in 1968 . However former agent M . Wesley Swearingen , who was once assigned to the squad that investigated the Panthers in Los Angeles , thinks Pratt &quot; was deliberately set_up . . . what we termed in the FBI to neutralize him. &quot; Swearingen said he thinks the FBI destroyed the logs . Swearingen , who retired in good standing in 1977 , said he saw documents showing an FBI wiretap was in place at Panther headquarters on the day Olsen was killed . Two staffers in the office of the late Charles Garry , an attorney who often represented Panthers , said they saw logs of an FBI wiretap showing Pratt was in Oakland the day Olsen was shot . But a Los Angeles Superior_Court judge dismissed Pratt ' s petition to have those alleged logs produced . * To a large degree , the case against Pratt may be a question of who is more believable -- Pratt or Butler . At Pratt ' s trial in 1972 , the prosecutor , Deputy Dist . Atty . Richard P . Kalustian , now a Superior_Court judge , summed_up just how important a witness Butler was : &quot; Julio Butler has testified in this court under oath and to the jury to a confession that Mr. Pratt made to him that admits all_of the elements of the offense . If the jury believes Julio Butler . . . Mr. Pratt is guilty . The case is over if they believe that. &quot; Butler had testified that Pratt confessed only hours after the shootings . Kalustian likened Butler ' s &quot; insurance &quot; letter to a deathbed declaration , saying &quot; at no time did ( Butler ) desire to go_to the police with the information and at all times intended to keep it secret. &quot; However , in the report he delivered to Garcetti ' s office last June , minister-turned-investigator McCloskey argued that Butler had every intention of having the letter ' s contents become known . &quot; Only three days after he wrote and delivered it to Sgt . Rice , he told the FBI what was in it , &quot; McCloskey said in his report . In Rice ' s 1979 sworn statement , he said that as soon as Butler handed him the letter on a street_corner , two FBI_agents walked up and demanded the letter . Rice said that when he refused , the agents shouted after Butler , calling him &quot; Julio , &quot; but Butler kept walking . McCloskey called it &quot; preposterous &quot; to believe that the FBI &quot; just happened to pass_by when their informant on Pratt and the ( Panthers ) was passing a letter to someone on the street_corner in broad daylight that ( could have ) put Pratt in the gas chamber. &quot; The jury , knowing none of this , convicted Pratt after 10 days of deliberation . One juror , Jeanne Hamilton , said in a recent interview that she feels as if she had been &quot; used by the government , by the FBI , by Kalustian , by everybody who had a hand in it . I feel betrayed by the justice system right now because nobody will listen. &quot; The jury also did not know that shooting victim Kenneth Olsen , who identified Pratt , had earlier identified someone else . Had the jury known about Olsen ' s earlier identification , Hamilton said , &quot; I think that alone would have changed our mind. &quot; She said she regrets she did not counter the jury foreman , a second-year law_student , when he sternly looked her in the eye and asked : &quot; If somebody shot your husband , would n ' t you remember their face ? &quot; * After Pratt was convicted , Butler volunteered for former City Councilman David Cunningham ' s 1973 election campaign . A year or two later , Cunningham said in an interview , he hired Butler as a field deputy , adding that Butler was very effective in getting police to crack_down on drug dealers in his district . In 1981 , Butler was arrested for allegedly threatening a man with a pistol and kicking him . He resigned from Cunningham ' s staff and pleaded no contest to charges of carrying a loaded weapon and driving under the influence of alcohol . He was sentenced to probation and fined . Two years later , Butler was hired as a paralegal at Bet Tzedek , a legal services_program for the poor . He attended West Los Angeles College and then law_school . He was admitted to the State Bar in 1989 and became a staff attorney at Bet Tzedek . So far , Pratt ' s lawyers have lost every appeal of his conviction . In 1980 , the state ' s 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled , in part , that Pratt failed to prove his contention that he was framed by FBI_agents and Los Angeles police . Periodic demonstrations demanding Pratt ' s freedom continue . Butler ' s name is prominently raised as a symbol of the alleged betrayal of Pratt , but he remains secure near the top of one of Los Angeles ' symbols of social justice -- First A.M.E. Earlier this month , some of the January demonstrators met with church officials , but both sides agreed not to publicly discuss the meeting . However , a source close to the negotiations , who requested anonymity , said the church had offered to ask Butler to write a letter to the state parole board , urging that Pratt be released . Some of Pratt ' s supporters say they would be satisfied with nothing less than a letter from Butler that recants his testimony and exonerates Pratt . Pratt ' s supporters say the church has repeatedly described their efforts to hold Butler accountable as an attack on First A.M.E. &quot; The church keeps putting ( Butler ) up front and trying to make the community accept him as some kind of new black leader or something , &quot; said former Panther Roland Freeman , one of the January protest ' s organizers . &quot; That is not going_to work . The issue is that Geronimo has been in jail for 23 years , and one of the persons who was instrumental in it is Julio Butler. &quot; Pratt ' s only opportunity for freedom appears to rest with McCloskey ' s report and Garcetti ' s review of the case . The district_attorney ' s office says it has set no deadline for completion of he review . &quot; The only decision now is to determine if there is anything in the material ( McCloskey ) has given us that would be worthy of an investigation , &quot; said Assistant Dist . Atty . Dan Murphy . Said former Pratt attorney Cochran : &quot; I hope Garcetti will do the right thing -- at least a hearing or a new trial .</TEXT>
