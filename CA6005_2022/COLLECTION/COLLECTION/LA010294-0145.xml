   <HEADLINE> GOING HOLLYWOOD ; MORE VALLEY CITIES ARE SEEKING STARRING ROLES AS LOCATIONS FOR MOVIES , TV_SHOWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Rose City Diner in Pasadena doubles as the Peach Pit on &quot; Beverly Hills 90210 , &quot; Dave ' s White_House was in Arcadia , and downtown Monrovia is having its 15 seconds of fame in &quot; Wayne ' s World 2. &quot; The San Gabriel Valley ' s all-American-looking cities have played a supporting role in Hollywood productions since D.W. Griffith filmed in Pasadena in 1912 . Now a handful of cities are going_out of their way to lure movies , TV_shows and commercials to the San Gabriel Valley . Pasadena , Sierra Madre and Monrovia have hired film liaisons to bring more film companies to town . In Altadena and other unincorporated areas , the Los Angeles County Film Office cuts_through red_tape to entice productions . Although filming has dropped_by more_than 12 % in the movie_industry ' s favorite location -- Los Angeles -- in the last two years , productions have increased in San Gabriel Valley areas . Since Pasadena hired a film liaison in 1985 , the annual number of productions has more_than doubled , with 470 film permits issued last year . Likewise in the smaller communities of Altadena , Monrovia and Sierra Madre , with their picturesque , homey Midwest looks , the number of permits has risen steadily since they began to encourage filming . Last year , each issued 50 to 65 permits . This year Monrovia became the latest San Gabriel Valley city to hire a liaison after the city began doubling as Rome , Wisc. , on the CBS television_show &quot; Picket Fences. &quot; &quot; More cities are seeing the potential for economic development through filming , &quot; said Pamela A . Powell , deputy director of the California Film Commission , which promotes the industry in California . In addition to the money cities make from filming permits , hotels and local businesses get a boost , and so do residents who rent their homes to film companies . And then there ' s the intangible benefit of the free publicity garnered when a city makes a cameo appearance . Powell said the San Gabriel Valley is popular_with film companies in part because all cities except San Dimas , La Verne , Claremont and Pomona sit within a vital 30-mile zone , where 70 % of movies are made . Beyond this zone , union crews are paid more , which increases production_costs . The dominant player in the movie location business in the San Gabriel Valley is Pasadena , where scenes from &quot; Gone With The Wind , &quot; &quot; The Sting &quot; and &quot; Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid &quot; were filmed . In 1993 , filming was worth $ 5 million to Pasadena ' s economy . Filming fees brought the city $ 700 # 000 , far more_than all other San Gabriel Valley cities combined , said Ariel Penn , the city ' s film liaison . After Penn was hired in 1991 , she helped the city draw_up regulations and set permit fees to attract more filming . And in two years , filming in Pasadena has shot_up 29 % . She helps film crews arrange street closures , obtain police and fire backup , even find a better location -- all_in the blink_of_an_eye . &quot; There was a time when Pasadena had a really bad rap , but that has all changed since Ariel , &quot; location manager Antoinette Levine said of the city ' s new eagerness to please . Penn helped Levine turn Old Pasadena ' s Dayton Street into Venice ' s Market Street for Columbia Pictures ' soon-to-be released &quot; I ' ll Do Anything , &quot; starring Nick Nolte . The $ 5-million boost to Pasadena ' s local economy comes from fees to property_owners ranging from $ 500 to $ 12 # 000 a day , and from film company spending on hotel_rooms , food , equipment and other services , Penn said . The city charges $ 480.84 daily for permits on private_property and $ 612.45 for filming on city property . Crews can spend up_to six days every three months at one residence and longer if neighbors approve . Last year , Michael Keaton in &quot; My Life &quot; lived_in a 20 # 000-square-foot Arden Road home once used for &quot; Dynasty &quot; and the Marx Brothers ' &quot; Duck Soup. &quot; &quot; Addams Family Values &quot; haunted a Manford Avenue home and &quot; The Beverly Hillbillies &quot; camped_out in an Oaklawn Avenue estate . Crews from &quot; Beverly Hills 90210 &quot; and &quot; Murder , She Wrote &quot; were regulars . And the Civic Center became the backdrop for &quot; Love_Affair &quot; with Warren Beatty and Annette Bening . Sharp-eyed television watchers can see the city in everything from Lexus ads to McDonald ' s commercials . The city in June played an East Coast town for Bell Atlantic and a month later , the Midwest for Michigan Bank . Penn ' s daily challenge is to overcome a unique regional malady : location burnout . For example , residents of South San Rafael Road , where homes sell for $ 2 million and up , are regularly inundated by quarter-mile-long lines of movie trucks and trailers . Last month , the &quot; Lois and Clark &quot; TV_show and the seventh &quot; Nightmare on Elm Street &quot; film joined the list of productions that have used the street , including the &quot; Batman &quot; TV series and the film &quot; Dead Again. &quot; To minimize complaints by neighbors , Penn promotes less well-known areas such_as North Pasadena and has put_together a book of 157 film locations whose owners want filming . Still , not all residents are pleased . &quot; The film liaison is a movie_industry representative , &quot; said Betty Keatinge , a San Rafael homeowner who led a neighborhood rebellion in 1991 against Paramount Pictures ' plan to use helicopters to fly in sets for &quot; Dead Again. &quot; She complained to the City_Council , which refused to grant the studio an exemption from city filming rules without residents ' approval , and the sets were trucked in instead . Penn said complaints are rare , perhaps in part because 14 # 000 of the city ' s 131 # 500 residents work in film production and related industries , according to the 1990 U.S. Census . In nearby Sierra Madre , Ruth and Jim Harmon were contracted eight years ago as liaisons after many residents began complaining of location burnout . The city , where the original &quot; Invasion of the Body_Snatchers &quot; was shot , is now more appealing_to the movie_industry , city officials said , and complaints are dealt with quickly . &quot; I get residents ' authorization for filming and stay_on the location to make_sure the neighbors aren ' t bothered , &quot; Ruth Harmon said . Harmon said many of the productions are filmed at an Italian villa in the Alverno High_School , a private Catholic girls school which has played host to everything from the Guns N ' Roses video &quot; November Rain &quot; to Tim Burton ' s &quot; Ed Wood. &quot; &quot; It brings_in money for scholarships , &quot; said Principal Elizabeth Broom , who declined to reveal how much money the school earns from filming . Last year , the city earned approximately $ 20 # 475 from the 49 permits issued for productions , including the movies &quot; The Three Musketeers , &quot; &quot; Man ' s Best_Friend &quot; and &quot; Beethoven ' s 2nd. &quot; In Monrovia , Old Town merchants and city officials are finding a financial windfall in the city ' s Middle America look . In 1993 , the city hired a film liaison to oversee productions after &quot; Picket_Fences &quot; became a regular part of town life . In July , the city and merchants closed Myrtle Avenue for two days and turned_over Old Town to &quot; Wayne ' s World 2 &quot; for a scene in which Mike Myers plows a car into a fire_hydrant . David Gayman , president of the city ' s Old Town Merchant ' s Assn. , said he can give the OK to a production in the city_center the same day a location manager calls , thanks to an agreement among shop owners . &quot; Whether we ' re selling tools or serving as a movie backdrop , it ' s all business , &quot; Gayman said . His Valley Hardware_Store was featured as a Western-wear shop in the movie &quot; Son-In-Law &quot; in 1992 . Last year , Monrovia received more_than $ 60 # 000 in permit fees and property_owners received more_than $ 300 # 000 for locations . Chamber_of_Commerce officials say productions have boosted the local economy and provided free advertising for the city . In some cities private groups promote filming . Most of Arcadia ' s productions are at the invitation of the Foundation for Los Angeles State and County Arboretum . The foundation has increasingly turned_to private fund raising after county budget_cuts in the last two years . The arboretum , with its Queen Anne Cottage built by E . J . ( Lucky ) Baldwin in 1906 , has been the setting for more_than 200 films . It was the centerpiece of television ' s &quot; Fantasy Island , &quot; the Bob Hope and Bing Crosby hit &quot; The Road to Singapore &quot; and five Johnny Weismuller Tarzan movies . This year , the arboretum , which charges_up to $ 3 # 900 a day to rent , co-starred in &quot; Dave. &quot; The White_House ' s Truman Balcony was built_on the grounds . Moviegoers also saw Robert Redford charm Demi Moore in &quot; Indecent Proposal. &quot; Arcadia issued 41 film permits in 1993 . The city received $ 13 # 870 in return . In an increasingly competitive market , some cities such_as San Marino may have priced themselves out of consideration , location managers say . San Marino charges a minimum of $ 1 # 000 a day for permits to film on private_property . With the recession and the move toward reality-based shows , San Marino has seen its film revenue drop from $ 45 # 000 to $ 25 # 000 in the last year , city officials said . Others cities such_as La Puente get few productions because they do not have an organized permitting process . La Puente officials say they simply cannot afford a film liaison to encourage filming . A number of cities , location managers say , may be revitalizing their way_out of the location business . &quot; Wayne ' s World 2 &quot; was filmed in Monrovia partly because Covina ' s Citrus Avenue , where the original &quot; Wayne ' s World &quot; was shot , was remodeled . Location manager Levine , who sought_out Sierra Madre and Monrovia ' s pre-tract housing for the &quot; China Beach &quot; characters ' return from Vietnam , gave this advice to other San Gabriel Valley cities interested in making_it in show_business : &quot; Don ' t tear_down your period buildings. &quot; Lights , Camera , Action ! 03 # 22 , 31 # 20 FILMS , TELEVISION_SHOWS AND COMMERCIALS FILMED CITY IN 1993 INCOME Alhambra Six commercials $ 1 # 700 in Six commercials permit fees Altadena 50 to 60 productions , $ 50 # 000 including plus fees &quot; Beverly Hills 90210 &quot; and &quot; Melrose Place &quot; Arcadia 41 productions , $ 13 # 870 in movies including permit fees &quot; Dave &quot; and &quot; Hot Shots II &quot; Azusa Three movies , including not available &quot; The Naked Gun 33 1 / 3 &quot; and an untitled Dolph Lundgren film Baldwin Park Three commercials $ 500 for Lucky and Vons Bradbury 10 commercials $ 10 # 000 approx .
