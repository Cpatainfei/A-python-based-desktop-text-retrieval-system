   <HEADLINE> THE NEW GUARDIAN OF CALIFORNIA ' S ZERO EMISSIONS RULE SPEAKS ; AUTOMOBILES : JACQUELINE SCHAFER DEFENDS GOV . WILSON ' S COMMITMENT TO TOUGH ANTI-POLLUTION STANDARDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s rule forcing production of the first modern , mass-market , zero-emission vehicles -- most likely electric_cars -- has become increasingly controversial as the 1998 deadline approaches . The state ' s electric utilities , alternative-fuel vehicle and parts manufacturers and environmentalists -- along with many political and business_leaders -- support the state mandate . But big U.S. and foreign auto_makers want to shelve the rule , one segment of a plan to drastically reduce health-endangering air_pollution from transportation sources . Car_makers say the limitations of current battery technology make practical , reasonably priced electric_cars impossible by 1998 . Last Tuesday , Ford Motor Co . turned_up the industry ' s lobbying effort , announcing that it may cancel a program to develop a new electric vehicle ; one official termed the effort a waste_of_money without better batteries . As the dispute heightened last fall , Gov . Pete Wilson alarmed electric-car proponents by removing Jananne Sharpless , an eight-year proponent of tough air_pollution measures , as chairwoman of the state Air Resources Board . Her replacement : Jacqueline E . Schafer , who spent most of her 20 years in the environmental field in Reagan and Bush_administration posts . Since then , there has been much speculation about Schafer ' s views on the zero-emissions rule . At the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show earlier this month , she met with reporters to talk_about electric_cars and other issues . Here are excerpts from her remarks : SCHAFER : For the last 25 years , the California Air Resources Board has been setting challenges for the automobile_industry . Our emission standards have long been the world ' s model , since even before the federal EPA began in this business . And the ability of the automobile manufacturers to respond to those challenges is evident in millions upon millions of cars on_the_road today throughout the world . The list of technologies that have been developed to meet those emission standards is long and impressive . It includes catalytic_converters and other add-on equipment , of course . But those standards have also produced more precise fuel_systems , electronic and computerized engine-management systems , and lightweight materials . So it ' s no coincidence that stricter emission standards have produced cars that also have better performance and higher fuel economy . Simply put , in responding to the challenges that we have posed so far , car_manufacturers have produced cars that are good for the consumer and good for air quality at_the_same_time . Emissions from a new car today have been cut by more_than 90 % compared to the models that were being built when we started the Air_Pollution Control Program for Mobile Sources . The air quality results have been impressive . Population exposure to ozone in Los Angeles has been cut_in half over the past decade . But despite that progress , the challenge for us as a public-health agency continues . California continues to be one of the nation ' s most popular places to live . The automobile population is increasing . And the mileage that these cars collectively are being driven is increasing at an even greater rate , because people choose to live_in suburbs that stretch ever farther from our central_cities and places of employment . As a result , motor_vehicles continue to be the single greatest source of air_pollution . And there is no other place where the effects of that are more acute than here in California , which experiences 75 % of the nation ' s health threat from excessive air pollutants . And there is no place in California that feels the effect of that pollution more_than where we are sitting here today in Los Angeles . So our challenges are the auto industry ' s challenges : To improve public health by making more environmentally acceptable vehicles . An ever-cleaner transportation_system has been the greatest reason for the air-quality improvements we ' ve achieved over the past 25 years . And advances in technology developed in response to emission standards have been the key to cleaner cars and fuels . It ' s a policy we must continue if we are to meet our public health goals . . . * QUESTION : What is your position on the zero-emissions rule ? SCHAFER : I have a bias toward retaining the ZEV rule for a simple reason : It has generated the production of a whole new set of incentives . . . and high-technology applications for transportation_systems that will serve us well into the 21st Century . My boss -- my big boss , the governor of the state of California -- . . . in his state ( of the state ) message pointed_out that technologies that once built jet fighters are now being used to build electric_cars , and that here in California environmental cleanup is a particularly exciting opportunity , in_order to create many new jobs for Californians . I think our regulation is part of that . I also point_out that as part of the board ' s adopting that regulation , we resolved to review progress toward meeting that 1998 goal periodically . One of those periodic reviews will be conducted in 1994 . I don ' t regard the automobile_industry as a monolith , nor the fuels industry as a monolith , and there are lots of entrepreneurs out there working hard to make this happen . So I look_forward to hearing the kind of testimony that will be brought_to the board , and I hope that we can work with the industry to make this standard produce the car of the 21st Century . * QUESTION : Have you seen information from the auto_makers that would encourage you personally to repeal the standards ? SCHAFER : I ' ve been reading the newspapers . I am waiting to hear from them in their own words , ( to hear them ) speak_for themselves . I understand that some manufacturers have had some difficulty in pursuit of a particular technology that they ' ve been investing in , but I think that our hearing process will bring these out . And I think you will see some people making advances faster than others . That just remains to be seen . * QUESTION : Should the board maintain the ZEV rule so that those who have made advances can keep going , or stop the whole process , or delay it , so others can catch_up ? SCHAFER : I ' d like to think that it ' s good public policy to continue the incentives in place to get people to behave in the way that we would like them to behave . . . I do not like to turn_around and disincentivize the people who are succeeding in doing what we would like to see done . . . Obviously , we also have to sell automobiles , in this state and we ' ll see how the consumers react . * QUESTION : Is anyone at the board looking_at alternative schemes that would meet clean-air goals without ZEVs ? SCHAFER : Our low-emission vehicle program , of which the zero emission vehicle is a part , is over and above that which is required by federal EPA , because the problem we have here is so_much larger than any other state . In California , the number of days out of compliance with the ozone standard is 10 times the next worse case , which happens to be the New York City metropolitan area . So we have a larger problem . We have standards to meet that larger problem , and as a consequence we have to push the technology that much harder . The fact is that automobile emissions account_for the single largest source of the air_pollution problem that we face . What we want to do is get_at the large sources in the most cost effective way possible , and that has argued for a strong program of cleaner cars and cleaner fuels as the most cost effective way of meeting the particular clean-air problem we have here in California . There ' s no Plan B right now . But , of course , we will review anything that ' s presented to us as we undertake the review of the ZEV standard this year . BIO Jacqueline E . Schafer Position : Chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board . Age : 48 Born : Greenport , Conn .
