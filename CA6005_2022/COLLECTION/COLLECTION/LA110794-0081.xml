   <HEADLINE> IN SYRIA , ASSAD ' S WORDS SPEAK LOUDER THAN DEEDS ; MIDEAST : DAMASCUS WANTS LEADER ' S DESIRE FOR PEACE TAKEN ON FAITH . BUT ISRAEL , OTHERS DEMAND ACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The library was bursting_out of the old house , so Suheil Zakkar built a large hall upstairs and laid_in more books . There are more_than 30 # 000 in all , a musty gilt , leather and ink shrine to the eras when Arabs fashioned an alphabet to set_down their violent and lovely tales and liberated Jerusalem . Zakkar , Syria ' s premier historian , spends most of his hours at a cramped desk in the shadow of his towering shelves , writing a new history of the Crusades in 26 volumes , this one through Arab eyes . It has been funded personally by Syrian President Hafez Assad . Next , Assad is commissioning a history of Damascus , believed to be the world ' s oldest inhabited city . Zakkar spends his days recording and preserving a civilization . He leaves it to his tough-minded political benefactors to fashion the future . Destiny weaves a fine web of the two . &quot; There was a man named Hajib who in pre-Islamic history asked_for wheat from the Persians . And when they said , ' How will you pay ? ' he said , ' I cannot give you more_than my word ' and ( made ) a small wooden bow . And the Persian emperor gave him what he needed . It took years after that , and Hajib died . But after those years , the tribe repaid the wheat , &quot; Zakkar recounted . &quot; Today , when President Assad said we are going_to make_peace with Israel , we have nothing to give but his word , &quot; he said . &quot; They say that isn ' t enough . What shall we give them ? Shall we give them Damascus as a hostage ? If they want peace , they have to trust us . Let them try , and they will not lose . But let them not try , and they will surely lose. &quot; As U.S. analysts sought to pinpoint new landmarks for Middle_East peace forged by Assad ' s crucial meeting recently with President Clinton , it was rough going . The stubborn Syrian leader had repeated his demand for a full return of Syria ' s occupied Golan Heights and balked at publicly condemning a recent wave of terrorist acts in neighboring Israel . He again declined to offer gestures proving he was serious about peace -- he made no offers to meet with Israeli officials , declined all talk_of an Israeli Embassy in Damascus and refused even to send envoys to last week ' s Middle_East economic summit with Israeli leaders . But in Damascus , the aging Assad ' s meaning was clear : In unequivocal terms , he had offered peace in exchange for occupied territory . He had defined peace as a strategic objective . Now , in the Syrian view that reaches back as far as history , it is up_to Israel to take him , and this nation , at his word . &quot; When Syria said we want peace , the expectation in Syria is this statement should be believed , &quot; said Yehya Aridi , a political analyst close to Assad and a former professor at Washington ' s Georgetown University . Yet it is equally clear that Syria ' s peace will come_on its own terms , in its own time . &quot; There was an example for us when ( PLO Chairman Yasser ) Arafat and the Israelis went_to Washington . They shook hands . They embraced even , &quot; Aridi said . &quot; Do you feel Arafat has achieved peace now ? How many Palestinians are happy with what has happened ? Very , very few . Those who have an interest in Arafat getting them money . Does peace mean having money ? There ' s something more valuable than that . There is dignity . There is the honor of the person . There is a saying in Arabic , ' Land is honor. ' &quot; We have lived a long_time like this , and we can live a long_time longer , &quot; Aridi said . &quot; This land , &quot; he added , &quot; is the first piece of Earth to have seen the sun . It is the cradle of civilization . The first alphabet was found here . It is the home of prophets . For this reason , we do no accept to be insulted . We do not accept to lose our dignity . And we have no need to make you feel comfortable . When we believe we are older than history , we can wait for a long , long time. &quot; After the recent peace_treaty signings by Jordan and the Palestinians , U.S. officials had hoped , with Clinton ' s intervention , to speed Syria to the peace table too . But by all indications , Syria is in no hurry . Far from eager to join the rush toward treaties with Israel , Syria is both the key to an enduring peace in the Middle_East and the one nation most likely to stand_in the way of its rapid realization . &quot; Assad has been talking the same game for 20 years . It ' s remarkable how consistent he ' s been . So nobody should hold_out hope for bold new gestures , &quot; said a diplomat in the Syrian capital in the wake of Clinton ' s visit . &quot; Assad has made the decision to seek peace , but at the moment , he has nothing compelling him to seek anything but the best possible deal. &quot; Analysts here say Syria is ready to make_peace on its own terms , but because of a number of factors , it cannot be expected to join Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization in signing a quick treaty , or one that compromises Damascus ' basic demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights . First , Syria doesn ' t face the same economic imperatives -- a crushing need for foreign debt relief , a cutoff in financing from the Arab Gulf states , rising joblessness -- that pushed Arafat and Jordan ' s King Hussein into Israel ' s arms . The demise several years ago of its former benefactor , the Soviet_Union , backed Syria into abandoning its hope of ever defeating Israel militarily . But Syria has moved rapidly to forge new ties with the West and take a path toward economic self-sufficiency , with encouraging results . While imports have doubled_over the past six years , the Syrian_pound has remained stable with a substantial increase in agricultural and industrial production that has fueled new exports . After years of_importing food , Syria five years ago began exporting farm goods , nearly doubling production of cotton and quadrupling citrus production . Since 1988 , petroleum production has grown by 150 % , with 60 % of it exported to foreign markets . A fledgling private sector -- still vastly overshadowed by the lumbering state industries fostered under decades of Arab Baathist socialism -- is opening factories and developing markets abroad for Syrian goods , mainly garments and foodstuffs . Commercial exchange with neighboring Lebanon -- a virtual captive with 40 # 000 Syrian troops stationed there -- has grown from $ 50 million to $ 500 million a year since 1990 . &quot; We are the last Middle Eastern country that needs economic aid , and yet we have continuous hopes that the U.S. will have an honest stand toward us , &quot; said Elias Nejma , an economics professor at Damascus University and member_of_Parliament . Syria has made_it clear that it hopes the United States will lift the crippling restrictions on aid and investment that stem from Syria ' s designation as a nation that supports international terrorism and drug-dealing . But Nejma said Syria was in no hurry to join last week ' s economic summit in Casablanca , Morocco , where Arab nations -- except Syria and Lebanon -- met to begin forging a new , joint economic future . &quot; They ' re asking us to cooperate with Israel even before we cooperate with ourselves as Arabs , &quot; Nejma complained . &quot; It is a mere maneuver to submit the economies of the Middle_East to the Israeli economy. &quot; There is an even more basic reason why Assad is in no hurry for peace : Over the past 25 years , he has built his empire on confrontation with Israel . In the name of uniting the nation against a common enemy , Assad has ruthlessly stifled dissent at_home , quelling unrest within Syria ' s diverse Christian and Muslim ethnic communities and brutally putting_down Islamic fundamentalist opposition . He has built a well-equipped army of 400 # 000 and an accompanying security apparatus that now forms the underpinnings of his regime . What happens when there is no more enemy ? &quot; I think it ' s clear they have learned some lessons from the disintegration of the Soviet_Union after the Cold_War , and their intent is not to let that happen , &quot; one Western envoy said . &quot; that ' s a big unknown even in Assad ' s mind : what forces peace would set_off . And that ' s probably accounting_for some of his caution. &quot; Government officials privately admit they are worried that Syria could see the same wave of Islamic fundamentalism that has mounted a vocal opposition to peace with Israel in Egypt , Jordan and the Gaza Strip . Assad , they say , believes he can head_off such opposition only by winning the whole of the Golan Heights back from Israeli occupation , a belief that in his mind renders a partial Israeli withdrawal , or a withdrawal leaving in place Israeli settlements , completely unacceptable at_home . &quot; To tell his people we made_peace with Israel without half the Golan , he won ' t be accepted as a leader , the stability we have will not last very long , &quot; said one Baath Arab Socialist_Party official , who also made a reference_to Assad ' s quelling of Islamic fervor in 1982 by virtually destroying the city of Hama . &quot; All those difficult years are still in the back of our minds . They ( the Islamists ) don ' t have a slogan to attract the people , but if you give them a subject like this , any concessions on the Golan Heights , they will ignite their engine again . This is the fear of all_of us. &quot; Perhaps equally threatening are the demands of the generals who have built their own empires in Syria through three decades of war . &quot; The strongest voice resisting peace right now comes from the people in the military and security apparatus who have been making fortunes ( from confrontation with Israel ) , &quot; one Western diplomat said . Yet Western analysts here say there are indications that Assad is preparing himself to meet Israel ' s inevitable demand that the Syrian army be shrunk . In August and September , the government announced the retirement of 15 army generals , together with a number of other important job shuffles that included the appointment of a new chief of the air_force and a new intelligence chief . &quot; One way of looking_at it is that Assad is moving_out the Old_Guard , preparing_for the day when the downsizing has to happen , &quot; an envoy in Damascus said . &quot; Even going so far as_to eventually cut the army in half , it ' s not impossible . He could do_it , and he could get_away with it , as long as Assad is Assad . And now we are seeing indications that he is already beginning to do it. &quot; Perhaps just as troublesome , many analysts say , will be the inevitable demands for political change that could accompany an end to the standoff with Israel . At Damascus University , students and academics quietly debated the outcome of Clinton ' s trip , and many were looking further ahead than a simple end to hostilities . &quot; The price of war has been very heavy , and it must be said that we hope for a change in the level of political life . We will expect democracy if peace comes , &quot; one young professor said , lowering his voice and surveying the sidewalk around him as he spoke . &quot; The government has always said the enemy , Israel , is there , and it ' s necessary to fight it together . It is a pretext . . . &quot; he said . &quot; And when peace arrives , it will be necessary for us to search for democracy . The government will stay after peace , I am sure . But they must find another strategy of governing . The politics of terror , we have to finish with all that. &quot; Zakkar , for his part , said he is an advocate of peace but will take his enmity for Israel with him to his grave : &quot; I am ready to make_peace , but I am not ready to make friends . And I will not do_it . I am accepting peace , and no more . And let time do its business. &quot;</TEXT>
