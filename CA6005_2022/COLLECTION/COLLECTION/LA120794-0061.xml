   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW / NONFICTION ; A TRAVEL DIARY THAT READS LIKE LITERATURE ; THE LOST HEART OF ASIA BY COLIN THUBRON ; HARPERCOLLINS $ 23 , 374 PAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The place that Colin Thubron calls &quot; the world ' s heart &quot; is what used to be known as Soviet Central Asia and is now a vast puzzle whose pieces are newly minted nations with ancient names : Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan . &quot; For mile upon mile the only colour was a terrible , famine- breathing platinum , less like pure sand than the pulverised clay of the empires which had petered out_in its dust : Persia , Selucia , Parthia , Macedon , &quot; Thubron writes . &quot; It was awesome and somehow expected : that the heart of the world was not a throbbing organ but a shifting question mark. &quot; Thubron is one of those unconquerably curious and superbly literate travelers that the_English seem to breed in abundance . His earlier adventures in the former Soviet_Union , China and the Muslim world are the subject of a series of well-regarded novels and travel memoirs , and now he tells us tales of his experiences as a stranger in yet another strange land in lush prose that often soars into poetry . Thubron describes exactly what he sees at eye level -- the men and women he encounters and the here-and-now of their curious and often desperate lives -- but history and politics are never quite out of mind . For example , when he introduces us to a beleaguered Russian woman in newly independent Turkmenistan , she speaks words that could have been uttered by any number of dispossessed European settlers in Africa or Asia over the last century or so : &quot; Will these people regret it when we go ? The Russians run everything here ! We ' re the only people who make things work . When we ' re gone , what will their future be ? &quot; Of course , Thubron is always quick to remind us that the history of these lands is measured not merely in decades or even centuries but millennia . And so he is more likely to invoke Alexander the Great or Genghis Khan or Tamerlane than more recent Russian overlords . Thubron expects to find an eruption of Islamic fundamentalism in the Muslim communities of Central Asia , but what the Soviets left_behind turns_out to be an odd hybrid of several orthodoxies . He happens_upon Jews at prayer in a synagogue where Hebrew is now a forgotten language , a gentleman in a homburg hat who was among the Germans deported from the Volga by Stalin during World_War_II , and an unlikely congregation of Baptists who were converted by &quot; a rich Korean . . . from Los Angeles. &quot; Indeed , Thubron describes a world in the grip of a collective identity_crisis . At a mosque in Bukhara , Uzbekistan , for example , he encounters Gypsies sacrificing a sheep , peasant women making obeisance to an ancient tree believed to induce fertility and cure backache , and a_few rather befuddled devotees praying at the mausoleum of a Sufi saint . &quot; He scarcely knew the history of the saint he served , &quot; Thubron writes_of one worshiper , &quot; but lapsed into communist jargon , describing him as a Stakhanovite holy_man who achieved through work and planted melons. &quot; As Thubron shows us , the countries of Central Asia -- and the people who live there -- have been cruelly severed from their own memories and traditions . In Stalin ' s days , a mosque in Uzbekistan was turned_into a Museum of Atheism ; today , the Lenin Museum in Kyrgyzstan has been made_over as a museum where the battle maces of Tartar warriors are_on display . And so no one quite knows the authentic history or destiny of what Thubron calls &quot; the hinterland of God ' s vengeance. &quot; &quot; The city ' s heart seemed numb with lessons and memorials , &quot; he writes_of the Russified city of Tashkent . &quot; People faded to shadows here. &quot; For me , the emblematic scene in &quot; The Lost Heart of Asia &quot; is a visit to a ruined mausoleum in the desert of Turkmenistan , one of dozens of crypts and mosques and castles that seem to litter the dreamy landscape across which Thubron wanders . &quot; You watch_out in those ruins , &quot; says the driver who escorted Thubron into the desert . &quot; They ' re haunted. &quot; &quot; By whom ? &quot; &quot; I don ' t know , &quot; the driver answers . &quot; People have been heard crying there. &quot; So it is with Thubron ' s book . He invites us to places that are haunted by history , and the anguished voices we hear in these pages might belong_to the ghost of the Veiled Prophet of Khorsan -- or a flesh-and-blood woman keening over the burial stones of long-forgotten nomads . Thubron cannot be sure , and neither can we .</TEXT>
