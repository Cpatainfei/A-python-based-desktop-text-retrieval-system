   <HEADLINE> ETHNIC DISCORD ; BACK TO SUDETENLAND ? ; THE PRESSURE IS BUILDING ON CZECHS TO RETURN HOMES AND PROPERTY THEY SEIZED FROM GERMANS AFTER WORLD_WAR_II OR TO AT LEAST COMPENSATE THE VICTIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Baroque central square of this charming border town is a hub of German tourism and Czech Angst . Across from the town_hall , visiting Germans frequent a bookshop in Haus von Gruener , the home of Cheb ' s Sudeten German mayor before he was expelled with 38 # 000 other residents after World_War_II . &quot; When they come_in and demand maps in German with the local names the way they used to be , that ' s an indicator of something , &quot; bookseller Irena Schulzova said . For Schulzova , whose hybrid last_name is testimony to the region ' s bicultural history , the sought-after maps are symbolic of Sudeten German desires to take_back the Czech borderlandproperties that were confiscated from them after the war . Her answer is to keep only Czech-language maps in_stock . &quot; There were more Germans in this town than Czechs , and if the Germans came_back now , where would we Czechs be ? It would be absolute chaos , &quot; she said . An estimated 2.5 million Sudeten Germans were stripped of their Czech citizenship and properties and expelled from the country after Nazi Germany was defeated in 1945 . Thousands were beaten and killed in a riot of revenge for Adolf Hitler ' s annexation of the border region preceding World_War_II . What was then termed the Sudetenland became the mark of Western appeasement of the Nazi leader , cemented in the 1938 Munich Pact in which Britain and France agreed to the annexation . Six months later Nazi forces swallowed all_of Czechoslovakia and in 1940 invaded Poland , triggering the world_war . Since the collapse of communism , Sudeten German representatives in Bavaria have been pressing for the return of their properties . Recently their call was taken_up by high-ranking German officials -- a worrisome development to the residents of Cheb . At a Sudeten German congress in Nuremberg in May , German Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said the Czech government should seek reconciliation with the expelled Germans . Finance_Minister Theo Waigel linked support for the Czech Republic ' s bid to join the European Union to concessions on the Sudetens . ( The former Czechoslovakia has been split into independent Slovakia and the Czech Republic. ) But the German government has not officially linked the two issues , and many German and Czech officials suggest that the high-level comments were campaign rhetoric to win Sudeten votes for the ruling German coalition in the October federal election . They also say the vast majority of Sudetens have no desire to return to the Czech Republic . But the issue remains deeply emotional on both sides of the border . &quot; The question is not whether a_hundred , a_thousand or a_hundred_thousand Sudetens would go_back , &quot; said Franz Neubauer , leader of the Sudetendeutsche Landsmannschaft , an organization of expelled Sudetens that claims 100 # 000 members . &quot; What is important is that the Czechs say this was wrong. &quot; Neubauer says his group wants dual citizenship , which neither country recognizes , and to discuss property_rights with the Czech government . He is calling_on the Czech government in Prague to abolish a 1946 confiscation decree by President Eduard Benes issued to punish Sudeten Germans for their role in the Nazi occupation , and says the Sudetens would consider restitution or compensation . In a controversial speech on New Year ' s Day , 1990 , Czech President Vaclav Havel actually did apologize for the mass expulsion and said the Sudetens should not be burdened with &quot; collective guilt &quot; for those who fought on the side of the Nazis and helped the occupation of Czechoslovakia . But he stopped short of raising the land issue , and Czech restitution laws limit return of properties to those confiscated after the Communist takeover in 1948 . Sudeten lands are excluded . In a region that has suffered so_much turmoil , many Czech citizens say Havel opened a can of worms and are adamant that the land issue be laid_to_rest . &quot; I think no one doubts that the laws we have now for restitution of property confiscated after ' 48 should be final , &quot; said Lubomir Novotny , deputy mayor of nearby Sokolov . &quot; If we go before that , then we would have to talk_about restitution from Germany ( for Nazi crimes ) . And if we went so far back into history , we ' d have to go_back to 1648 when the Swedes invaded Prague , &quot; Novotny said . After the Sudetens were expelled , most of their houses were occupied by Czechs or torn_down ; their lands were occupied or confiscated by the government . Like many border residents , Novotny tells a story of a Sudeten German arriving unexpectedly at the door of his house one day in the 1970s . &quot; A German car stopped , a man and a woman got_out . He said he was 9 when he had to leave and wanted to show her where he was born . He said outright he lives_in Stuttgart and just came_to see where he spent his childhood , &quot; Novotny said . From that , Novotny concludes that most Sudetens would not want to return . Cheb Mayor Frantisek Linda agrees and would object to any compensation from the Czech government to the Sudetens . But he also blames the former Communist government for having incited anti-German feelings , and , rather than dwell_on the past , he prefers to emphasize cooperation among Czechs and Germans at a border that burst open in 1989 . Cheb sits about five miles from the German border . Daily , Germans cross over to the Czech Republic to shop for goods less expensive than those they can find at_home , to get their hair cut , to have an afternoon coffee and cake . Cheb ' s central square is surrounded by currency exchange houses and signs_in German . German influence is again so strong -- and so touchy -- that the local newspaper , Chebsky Denik , recently ran a cartoon of a Czech vendor whose billboards were all written in German . &quot; I ' d be as patriotic as they come if Czechs just paid in D-marks , &quot; the vendor says . Some Czechs suggest that the Sudetens have become more aggressive on the land issue since the split of Czechoslovakia into two countries a year and a half ago ; now they are up against a smaller country . Some Germans say the problem has been overblown by politicians far from the border . Edita Danesova , 62 , whose German family remained in Czechoslovakia after the war , said &quot; the tough years were ' 45 and ' 46 &quot; but that the two groups have long since made_peace . At the sweet shop where she works in Sokolov , Danesova meets many German tourists and says she doubts many would abandon Germany for the poorer Czech Republic . In Cheb , bookseller Schulzova says she understands Czech-German sensitivities as well as anyone : Her grandfather was Czech and her grandmother German . &quot; When the war started , it was bad for my grandfather and they moved inland . After the war , it was bad for my grandmother , so they came_back here again , &quot; Schulzova said . Nonetheless , she holds_fast to the Czech mainstream , which says that Cheb must remain Czech .</TEXT>
