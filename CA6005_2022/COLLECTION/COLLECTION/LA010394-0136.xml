   <HEADLINE> UNEARTHING A HIDDEN PAST ; ARCHEOLOGY : AFTER YEARS OF CONTROVERSY , NATIVE_AMERICAN ARTIFACTS EXCAVATED FROM THE LOST VILLAGE OF ENCINO WILL BE_ON DISPLAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For most of the past decade , thousands of Native_American artifacts recovered from the Lost Village of Encino , one of the costliest archeological excavations in state history , have been sitting in an Orange County warehouse , freed from the earth after centuries , but collecting dust in obscurity . Soon , however , the public will get its first chance to see the most significant pieces -- stone tools , shell beadwork and arrowheads -- when they are donated by an archeologist to two San Fernando Valley museums . Nancy Whitney-Desautels is celebrating the resolution of a series of controversies that have embroiled Native_Americans , archeologists and the corporate developers of the site since the 3 # 000-year-old village was accidentally unearthed in 1984 . The debates that have swirled around the finds have overshadowed their archeological importance , some scientists say . &quot; This was clearly a very important discovery for both the diversity and quantity of artifacts and also that so_much of it was found intact , &quot; said Mark Raab , director of the Center for Public Archeology at Cal State Northridge . &quot; But there hasn ' t been an extensive publication on it &quot; in peer-reviewed archeological journals , he said , the key step_in establishing scientific worth . &quot; Neither the scientific community nor the public really know what ' s there , so displaying some of them should help. &quot; Whitney-Desautels said she hopes to deliver the first of the artifacts this month but arrangements with the museums have not been finalized . The gift of about 10 pieces to the San Fernando Mission and San Gabriel Mission museums and the placement of other , larger artifacts -- probably at a state museum on Ventura Boulevard near the site of the find -- comes_after Whitney-Desautels had refused for years to hand_over the pieces until she was paid_for her work by the company that constructed an office_building on the site . But with the settlement of a $ 1-million lawsuit against the developers in 1989 and the completion of the cataloguing of most of the pieces , Whitney-Desautels said this month that she is ready to part_with the collection . &quot; I never intended to keep the artifacts , but a lot happened along the way , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s not really anybody ' s fault . The village was a surprise and there wasn ' t a lot of time to prepare_for everything that was coming. &quot; Indeed , the recent history of the prehistoric village is a thoroughly modern story of cultural clashes , cost_overruns , bankruptcy and even slow-growth politics . At first , discovery of the village was simply the solution to a decades-old archeological mystery . For years , archeologists had attempted to find the ruins of the large settlement described in a 1769 diary kept by a member of the Spaniard Gaspar de Portola ' s expedition , the first Europeans known to have reached the San Fernando Valley . It was clear that the village must have been somewhere in the vicinity of Los Encinos State Historical Park on Ventura Boulevard , where a spring that continues to flow today would have provided water . But despite the efforts of several researchers , no sign of the settlement was found , earning it the nickname the Lost Village of Encino . Many archeologists who had searched for it unsuccessfully , hampered by inexact Spanish maps , feared that recent urbanization might have irretrievably buried the site . But in July , 1984 , a construction crew accidentally solved the mystery . While demolishing a defunct restaurant on the southeast corner of Balboa and Ventura boulevards in preparation for construction of an office complex , the workers came_across a_few artifacts , leading eventually to the discovery of increasing numbers of them and then the skeletons of about 20 Native_Americans . Although more_than 2 million tiny artifacts and fragments of human and animal bone were found in the village , only a_few thousand of the larger items are of real significance , Whitney-Desautels said . Among those are mortars and pestles , milling stones , stone bowls and arrowheads and other projectile points . The presence of both Native_American shell beads and Spanish glass beads suggests that the two groups engaged in trading before the village was abandoned for unknown reasons some time in the 19th Century . During the dig , scientists also found the areas where villagers cooked , processed hides and made beads . The village had a large burial_site , where researchers dug_up the bones or cremated remains of about 20 humans , 20 dogs and at least one bird . Whitney-Desautels believes the animals were used in sacrifices . Complying with state law that requires that such finds be examined and safeguarded by an archeologist , First Financial Group Inc. , which was building the office complex , hired Whitney-Desautels . Originally , Whitney-Desautels and First Financial negotiated a fee of $ 10 # 000 to $ 20 # 000 , but because the scope of the archeological work expanded as more and more artifacts and skeletons were unearthed , her excavations lasted almost eight months and the price eventually ballooned to $ 1.7 million . First Financial balked , firing Whitney-Desautels after paying her about $ 600 # 000 . Although First Financial did not return phone_calls for this article , the company ' s vice_president , Joel Shine , said at the time that the firm had gone beyond its legal requirements and refused to pay additional costs for the dig . State law requires that real_estate developers pay archeological excavation costs of up_to . 5 % of the site ' s construction budget , which First Financial followed . But Whitney-Desautels contended that the developer had also agreed to pay additional expenses for the excavation and preservation of the artifacts and said that she had paid $ 350 # 000 of_her_own money to complete the work . In June , 1987 , she filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization . However , saying she had a &quot; moral duty &quot; to complete the work , she continued to sort , catalogue and preserve the pieces in the Newport Beach warehouse owned by her company , Scientific Resource Surveys . A month later , she filed a lawsuit against First Financial which sought more_than $ 1 million in compensation for labor , storage , attorney ' s fees and profits she maintained she would have earned if the developers had not breached their agreement with her . Additionally , she placed a lien on the artifacts so First Financial could not get them . Meanwhile , representatives of Native_American groups were also squabbling . Gabrielenos , Chumash and Fernandenos all claimed the village as the ancient dwelling place of their ancestors . Fernandeno leaders maintained that the settlement is in an area they had inhabited for centuries . Chumash representatives cited reports by two consulting archeologists that found evidence of Chumash-style burials in the village . But Whitney-Desautels said the artifacts she found were clearly the work of the Gabrielenos . The state Native American Heritage Commission also declared that the village had probably been inhabited by Gabrielenos . Under state law , Native_American remains belong_to the groups representing descendants of the dead , as nearly as those can be determined . So , with the state commission backing them , the Gabrielenos won the right to reinter the bones , choosing the Los Encinos park , only half a block from the excavation site . On April 15 , 1985 , the park was closed to everyone else at dawn so a delegation of Gabrielenos could rebury the bones in a secret grave , its location known only to them . The wounds of that rift have not healed . &quot; My great-great-grandmother owned that land , so I ask how it can be Gabrieleno ? &quot; said Rudy Ortega , 67 , of San Fernando , who claims to be hereditary chief of the Fernandenos . The controversy reached Sacramento in 1985 , when then-state Sen . Alan Robbins ( D-Van Nuys ) , introduced legislation to set_aside $ 11 million to buy land and build a museum to house the artifacts . A portion of that appropriation would have also helped First Financial pay Whitney-Desautels ' fees . But after state-hired archeologists concluded that the collection was insufficiently valuable to warrant its own museum , the bill stalled . Robbins had to settle for a $ 195 # 000 appropriation to remodel the historic Garnier House in the Los Encinos park to house some of the artifacts . Although Whitney-Desautels now says the museum at Los Encinos State Park will probably get only a selection of the artifacts , park manager Russell Kimura said he originally expected to receive as_many pieces as Garnier House could hold . &quot; We thought that we would get most of the larger pieces here , &quot; Kimura said . &quot; I thought it had been arranged , but hopefully we can work something else out because this is something we ' d like to be a part of. &quot; In 1990 , when a $ 35-million office_building was planned for land across the street from the Lost Village site , an unusual alliance of Native_Americans and slow-growth suburbanites opposed it , arguing that the area could contain additional artifacts and human remains . After the developers , Katell Capretta Partners of Gardena , paid_for an archeological survey -- which found no significant artifacts -- the city gave them the go-ahead to build . With that battle ended , and large building_complexes now covering both the excavation on the southeastern corner of Balboa and Ventura Boulevards and the northeast corner as well , attention turned_back to Whitney-Desautels . Although she had settled her lawsuit with First Financial in 1989 -- dividing ownership of the artifacts between them -- the pieces remained in her company ' s warehouse , where they were still being catalogued . It was not until this year that the work was completed . While it is still unclear where the majority of the artifacts will be placed , many who have been involved in the protracted battle believe the displays at the two museums will focus attention on the people who inhabited the area long ago -- and still do . &quot; A lot of people think that there aren ' t Indians in the San Fernando Valley anymore , &quot; said Ortega , the Fernandeno leader . &quot; But I have 12 children , 69 grandchildren and either 44 or 49 great-grandchildren , and they all live_in the San Fernando Valley . Maybe by displaying these artifacts , we will remind people that we have been here a long_time and plan to stay here. &quot;</TEXT>
