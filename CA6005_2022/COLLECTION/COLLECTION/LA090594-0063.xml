   <HEADLINE> ANN CONWAY : REINVENTING THE WHEELS ; LIMO EXTERIORS ARE KEEPING_DOWN WITH THE TIMES , BUT PERKS STILL ABOUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Step with Henry Snyder into a converted Lincoln Town Car and you ' re in_for more_than a limo ride . Foil-wrapped chocolates ? Fresh berries ? Iced pink Champagne ? Coffee in a China cup ? They ' re all part of the tour perks that Snyder -- general_manager of Getaway Limousine Services in Orange -- has dreamed_up for clients . And you thought limos had no place in the dressed-down ' 90s . With the society-set gearing_up for a season of nonstop charity galas , land-yachts are as popular as ever . &quot; People still like to travel in_style , &quot; says Snyder , who has snagged some of the county ' s top corporate and social accounts -- The Walt Disney Co. , the Mighty Ducks , Tiffany &amp; Co. , and George Argyros , to name a_few . &quot; But now limos are less showy , more understated. &quot; Forget the velour-lined white &quot; prom cars &quot; that are stretched to a city_block . In are leather-lined black town cars and sedans -- or specialty cars such_as Getaway ' s ivory and ebony 1934 Rolls Royce -- that whisper instead of shout . &quot; Class is coming_back , &quot; Snyder says . &quot; In the ' 80s , everything was flash and glitz . We ' re heading into a more elegant time. &quot; And getting more for our money . For $ 60 per hour , which includes tax and gratuity , Snyder arrives 15 minutes early , presents you with his calling card , and helps you into a leather interior so deluxe you feel_like you ' re sitting inside a Judith Leiber handbag . Tap a button and a color_TV swivels out of a hidden compartment . Tap another and exactly 1 1 / 2 ounces of your complimentary beverage of choice cascades into a crystal tumbler . As the limo clicks along the diamond lane , you have some pressing decisions to make : Should the opaque privacy divider be down and the etched window divider up ? The sun roof closed ? The ceiling-hidden vanity mirror open ? You want to dish ? Drop Brooke Shields ' name . Snyder is her godfather , drove her to an Orange County charity gala last spring . ( Yes , it ' s still on between Shields and Agassi . And yes , Brooke is one of the nicest women alive. ) Or the name of the beloved Jackie O . She knew Snyder when he had the boutique at the famous Kenneth hair salon in New York in the ' 60s . ( &quot; She had such taste , &quot; he says , softly ) . It ' s &quot; special treatment &quot; that keeps clients coming_back , Snyder says . &quot; We ' ve developed everything from special request forms ( so Snyder will know if it ' s espresso or cappuccino a client wants , muffins or croissants , alcohol or soft_drinks ) to out-of-county tours to Bel-Air and the Temecula wine country . &quot; The challenge for the limousine company of the ' 90s is to make people feel special . It ' s an indifferent world out there. &quot; * Culinary art to benefit CHOC : Fresh off the fax is the menu for the Oct . 18 &quot; Culinary Event of the Century &quot; benefit for Children ' s Hospital of Orange County featuring chef Paul Bocuse at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach . Sponsored by the Four Seasons and the House of Mumm Champagne , the menu will feature a first course of pheasant consomme with lentil and wild mushrooms followed by baby lobster salad with chive sauce , roasted veal chop with goose_liver and truffle and a dessert of sabayon with figs and berries . All courses will be accompanied by vintage champagnes . Bocuse -- acclaimed in culinary circles as one of the world ' s great chefs -- will be joined by the hotel ' s executive chef , Michel Pieton . Tickets are $ 150 per person . Call 714-760-4920 for reservations . * Beatrice Wood honored : Centenarian ceramist Beatrice Wood of Ojai will be honored in Laguna Beach on Nov . 11 by the Archives of American Art , a division of the Smithsonian Institution . The gala dinner event will be at the Surf and Sand . &quot; I have just sent a telegram to heaven to keep me alive through Nov . 11 , &quot; Wood , 101 , wrote art collector Gerald Buck of Mission Viejo in May . ( Buck , an archives trustee , is helping mastermind the affair. ) Among the celebs on the invitation list are Michael and Diandra Douglas ( she helped produce the documentary , &quot; Beatrice Wood : Mama of Dada &quot; that was premiered on Wood ' s 100th birthday last year ) , Jack Nicholson and Lily Tomlin -- all avid collectors of the master ceramist ' s lustrous art ( a Wood bud vase goes_for about $ 500 , a 12-piece tea_service for $ 25 # 000 ) . &quot; She is a wonderful , spicy lady , &quot; says Electa Anderson , an event coordinator . Wood will receive the prestigious &quot; Esteemed Living American Artist Award &quot; from the archives , whose West Coast offices are at the Huntington Library in Pasadena . Last year ' s winner was David Hockney . For information , call ( 714 ) 492-7087 . * Royalty watching : Prince Charles will visit the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts on Nov . 2 as the guest of honor for the Royal Shakespeare Company ' s production of &quot; Henry_VI -- The Battle for the Throne. &quot; His visit will be celebrated with an invitation-only performance by the company . As president of the Royal Shakespeare Co. , the prince has selected the Cerritos Center as one of his destinations during his visit Oct . 31 through Nov . 4 during the UK / LA event .</TEXT>
