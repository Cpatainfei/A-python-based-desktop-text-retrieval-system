   <HEADLINE> 19 NEW CASES OF TB FOUND IN STUDENTS AT SANTA ANA SCHOOL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Skin testing of 146 students and staff at Sierra Intermediate School , prompted by the discovery of a classmate with symptoms of active tuberculosis , has found 19 students with previously undiagnosed TB infections , officials reported Wednesday . An additional eight students and staff were found positive for the disease who had also tested positive in the past , the officials said . Penny Weismuller , the Orange County Health_Care Agency ' s manager of disease control , said all students and staff with positive skin_tests will receive chest X-rays later this week at the school to help determine if they have active cases of tuberculosis . Sputum cultures would have to be taken_for a definitive diagnosis , she said . While the county tested only those students and faculty who came_in contact with an ill 12-year-old girl at the school , Weismuller said the results do not indicate that the girl ' s disease is highly contagious . &quot; At this point ( the 19 positive cases ) appear to be just a part of the rate of infection that we would expect in the school , &quot; Weismuller said . Weismuller said a large portion of the student body at Sierra Intermediate is Latino , an ethnic_group that tends to have a significant incidence of tuberculosis because of immigration from countries where the disease is endemic .</TEXT>
