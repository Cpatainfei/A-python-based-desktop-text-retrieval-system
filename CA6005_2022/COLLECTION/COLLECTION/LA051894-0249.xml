   <HEADLINE> HALDEMAN ' S DIARIES SHOW NIXON ' S DARK , HUMAN SIDES ; HISTORY : SECRET MEMOIR TELLS OF PRESIDENT ' S ALTERNATE GLEE AND GUILT AT PROVOKING ANTIWAR DEMONSTRATORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Newly released diaries kept by Richard Nixon ' s chief_of_staff portray the late President as alternately gleeful and guilt-ridden about provoking confrontations with Vietnam antiwar demonstrators and more scornful of blacks and Jews than had been reported previously . The diaries secretly kept by the late H.R. Haldeman , one of Nixon ' s most trusted White_House lieutenants , provide new insights into Nixon ' s complex personality . They reveal the darker side of the only U.S. President to resign and also illustrate his humanity , as when Haldeman reported that he wept openly on hearing of former President Dwight D . Eisenhower ' s death and when the deaths of four students by guardsmen at Kent State University upset him . For four years and three months before his Watergate-related resignation in April , 1973 , Haldeman kept by hand , and later dictated on tapes , a daily record that remained a secret to all but his family . Completing a foreword for his diaries shortly before his death in Santa Barbara last November , Haldeman left it up_to his wife , Jo , to decide if they should be published . She subsequently worked_out arrangements with G . P . Putnam ' s Sons Inc. , which is publishing the Haldeman diaries this week . The document is unique because Haldeman ' s reporting is contemporaneous , said Nixon biographer Stephen E . Ambrose . &quot; No other presidential chief_of_staff has gone_to such lengths to make a record in anything approaching such detail , &quot; Ambrose said . The diaries show Nixon torn by conflicting emotions toward young demonstrators protesting the Vietnam_War . In May , 1970 , shortly after Nixon widened the war by ordering the bombing of Viet Cong bases in neighboring Cambodia , the four students at Kent State in Ohio were shot and killed by National Guardsmen during a campus demonstration . &quot; He ' s very disturbed , &quot; Haldeman recorded . &quot; Afraid his decision set it off . . . . Issued condolence statement , then kept after me all_the rest of the day for more facts . Hoping rioters had provoked the shooting but no real evidence they did. &quot; In October , 1970 , Nixon took joy in taunting demonstrators whom he encountered on a visit to San Jose , Calif . In his diary , Haldeman wrote : &quot; We wanted some confrontation and there were no hecklers in the hall , so we stalled departure a little so they could zero_in outside and they sure did . Before getting_in car , P ( resident ) stood_up and gave the V_signs , which made them mad . They threw rocks , flags , candles etc . as we drove_out , after a terrifying flying wedge of cops opened_up the road. &quot; Nixon ' s low view of blacks appears both in his discussion of substantive issues and political opponents . In an April 28 , 1969 , discussion of welfare reform with Haldeman and John D . Ehrlichman , his domestic affairs adviser , Nixon &quot; emphasized that you have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks , &quot; Haldeman wrote . &quot; The key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to. &quot; Nixon &quot; pointed_out that there has never in history been an adequate black nation and they are the only race of which this is true . Says Africa is hopeless , the worst there is Liberia , which we built , &quot; Haldeman wrote . Although racial or ethnic slurs occasionally are found on some of Nixon ' s White_House tape_recordings made public previously and while some historians have noted his biases , the Haldeman diaries present by far the most graphic examples of these attitudes . However , John H . Taylor , director of the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda , Calif. , defended Nixon ' s statements as a reflection of his frustrations and said that they should be viewed &quot; strictly in a political context. &quot; On Feb . 26 , 1970 , Nixon expressed great displeasure with American Jews for planning to boycott a dinner for French President Georges Pompidou in New York . Nixon &quot; really raged again today against United States Jews because of their behavior toward Pompidou , &quot; Haldeman reported . &quot; Has decided to postpone Jewish arms supply for their ' unconscionable conduct. ' &quot; Haldeman also told of a Feb . 1 , 1972 , meeting between Nixon and evangelist Billy Graham in which &quot; there was considerable discussion of the terrible problem arising from the total Jewish domination of the media and agreement that this was something that would have to be dealt with. &quot; At one point in his diaries , Haldeman noted that &quot; Graham has the strong feeling that the Bible says that there are satanic Jews and that ' s where our problem arises. &quot; On other topics , Haldeman comments on the well-known feud between Nixon National Security Adviser Henry A . Kissinger and Secretary_of_State William P . Rogers . &quot; Actually , most of the fault in all_of this is chargeable to Henry because of his almost psychopathic concern with everything that Rogers does , &quot; Haldeman wrote . &quot; He acts like a little kid. &quot; Biographer Ambrose , who has read the Haldeman diaries , spoke in a television interview Monday of &quot; the extraordinarily bad relationship &quot; between Kissinger and Rogers that Haldeman records . &quot; We hadn ' t any idea of the extent of it . Every day Kissinger comes_to Haldeman and says you ' ve got_to fire Rogers or I ' m quitting , I ' m going_to resign. &quot; Some of the Haldeman diary entries as well as audio_recordings of Nixon were the subject of two programs on ABC ' s &quot; Nightline &quot; television_program on Monday and Tuesday . A diary entry by Haldeman on June 18 , 1972 , the day after the Watergate break-in , bolsters evidence that Nixon had no advance knowledge of the burglary of Democratic National Committee headquarters . &quot; So far the P is not aware of all this , &quot; Haldeman wrote . Two days later Haldeman wrote that White_House thinking was &quot; that we ' ve got_to hope the FBI doesn ' t go beyond what ' s necessary in developing evidence and that we can keep a lid on that. &quot; In the spring of 1973 , Haldeman and Erhlichman resigned in an attempt to shield the President from the growing Watergate scandal . On April 29 , 1973 , as Nixon tried to convince the two to step_down , Haldeman said that Nixon &quot; went_through his whole pitch about how he ' s really the guilty one . He said he ' s thought it all through and that he was the one that started ( White_House aide Charles ) Colson on his projects , he was the one who told ( White_House counsel John ) Dean to cover_up , he was the one who made ( John N. ) Mitchell attorney_general , and later his campaign manager and so on. &quot; Haldeman ' s diaries also paint Nixon as two-faced with political opponents like Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) . On July 21 , 1969 , shortly after a car Kennedy was driving plunged off a bridge on Martha ' s Vineyard and a woman passenger drowned , Haldeman wrote that Nixon &quot; wants to set_up and activate dirty tricks &quot; against the senator . But several days later , on Aug . 4 , 1969 , Nixon invited Kennedy into his office and &quot; told him he understood how tough it was etc. , &quot; Haldeman reported . However , a year later , Nixon &quot; came_up with a plan &quot; for the White_House to hire a private_detective to follow Kennedy in Paris and take photographs of him with various women , in hopes it would damage him politically , Haldeman said .</TEXT>
