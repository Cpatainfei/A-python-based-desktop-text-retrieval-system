   <HEADLINE> LATE RAINS , COMING SUMMER HEAT MEAN IT ' S TIME TO FIGHT FLEAS ; ENVIRONMENT : EXPERTS SAY we ' ll SEE A LOT OF THE PESTS THIS YEAR . THEY OFFER SOME TIPS FOR COMBATTING THE INSECTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Summer is coming , and with it beach parties and back-yard barbecues . But warmer temperatures and increased humidity also bring those tiny blood-sucking varmints that attack man and beast alike : fleas . And this year looks_like a bad one . &quot; With all_the late rains , you can bet we ' ll see a lot of fleas , &quot; said Larry Day of the Grand Avenue Pet Hospital in Santa Ana . &quot; They are mostly a nuisance , although if little kids get lots of bites , and they continually scratch them , they can cause a secondary infection , &quot; said Kelsey Onaga , a specialist with the Los Angeles County Environmental Health Department ' s Vectorborn Disease Surveillance and Entomology Program . Fleas are around all year , but they are most bothersome in summer because they reproduce best in warm , damp environments . In late spring , there is literally a population explosion of the pesky critters , which have hidden all winter long in front_yards , beneath rose bushes and in the cracks of sidewalks . Time to go_on the offensive : Veterinarians and pest-control experts say spraying now could prevent a serious flea infestation later . First , check household pets carefully . Any fleas you see on a dog or cat have plenty of friends who are probably all_over your house . &quot; As a rule_of_thumb , for every flea you find , there are 100 more in your environment , &quot; said Scott Chaness , president of Fleabusters , a pest-control company with offices throughout Southern California . &quot; The flea continues to lay eggs all day long , and a lot of those eggs fall onto carpets. &quot; Every year , Americans spend nearly $ 1 billion on flea control and prevention , according to flea-product maker Miles Inc. of Kansas City . Some of it goes_for a variety of pills and potions , gizmos and gadgets that don ' t work , said Granada Hills veterinarian William M . Bender . Among the so-called flea fighters Dr. Bender finds ineffective : flea collars ( including ultrasonic collars ) , yeast / garlic tablets , organic flea repellents and organic bedding . Bender also does not recommend topical insecticides , which are absorbed into a pet ' s bloodstream . Fleas are particularly difficult to get_rid_of because they breed so rapidly . A female flea lays_up to 50 eggs every day . The tiny eggs , which resemble grains of salt , are resistant to pesticides . A small larvae hatches from an egg , and later spins a silky web around itself in the pupa stage of development . Finally , an adult flea emerges . From start to finish , the reproduction process takes two weeks in optimum weather_conditions . In cold temperatures , a flea egg remains dormant indefinitely until spurred by warm temperatures and humidity . The flea ' s average life span is about eight weeks . So , even if a dog or cat has been dipped in flea bath and the house has been fogged , eggs in the carpet continue to hatch . Chaness of Fleabusters said that besides grooming pets and brushing_off the insects , it is also important for pet owners to spray their homes and yards . He said over-the-counter sprays and powders work fine , but because the killing agents do not last long they must be applied regularly to kill eggs that have not yet hatched . Fleabusters claims its treatment is effective for up_to one year . Incredibly strong for its minute size , an adult flea -- the size of the ball in a ballpoint_pen -- can jump 13 inches . The wingless insects , which pass readily from animal to animal , puncture the skin with their sharp beak and suck out blood . Fleas are generally more annoying than harmful , except to pets and people who are allergic to them , Onaga said . But the critters can cause some serious problems . Fleas can carry murine typhus , a debilitating disease that causes severe flu-like symptoms . The disease , which mostly affects people in their 50s and 60s , is passed_on to humans by fleas that have bitten field possums , said Onaga . He added that , fortunately , few cases of murine typhus have been reported in Los Angeles County . Typically , pets suffer from the annual onslaught of fleas the most , of course . Many dogs and cats suffer from allergic_reactions to flea_bites , often leading to severe skin irritations and sores . Fleas can also carry dog and cat tapeworms and can cause anemia especially in young or weak animals , according to veterinarian Bender .</TEXT>
