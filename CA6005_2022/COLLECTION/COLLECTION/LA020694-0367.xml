   <TEXT> Dr. Iver Juster ' s idea of a good time is getting a master ' s in business administration . Business fascinates him , and the degree couldn ' t hurt in his career as a physician-executive . But there was never time . Juster has a family and works 60 hours a week as medical director for a Cerritos health_maintenance_organization . In spare moments , he is an insatiable consumer of workshops and home study courses . Then last year , Juster heard about an MBA program offered entirely by computer . All the lectures , class discussions , papers and exams took_place on-line . Students came and went_on their own schedules , signing_on before work or after midnight . If they kept_up , participated in class , did their papers and passed the tests , they could have an MBA within 2 1 / 2 years . It was perfect for Juster . Now the HMO director signs_on to the University of Phoenix ' s on-line MBA program -- usually before dawn , armed with a cup of coffee , at his home computer in Long_Beach . But he has also logged_on from a dance camp in Sequoia National_Park over the Labor_Day weekend . And from time to time he lugs his laptop to a Thai restaurant near his office and squeezes in some on-line time over lunch . He spends 15 to 20 hours a week on schoolwork . By late next year , if all goes well , Iver Juster MD will become Iver Juster MD , MBA . Juster is one of a growing number of busy adults -- higher education ' s &quot; new majority , &quot; known in the old days as non-traditional students -- whom schools have begun courting with a high-tech bag of tricks capable of offering courses , degree_programs , even an entire college education , to people who need never set foot on a campus . The New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark , for example , offers a bachelor of arts in information_systems via videotapes and a system of computer conferences it calls the virtual classroom . In the near future , Cal Poly San Luis Obispo plans to offer videotaped lectures and demonstrations combined with self-paced tutorials , electronic_mail and conferencing . Several other California state universities plan to offer college courses to students in rural high_schools , relying entirely on videotapes , printed materials sent by mail , and computer and telephone conferencing . Northern Virginia Community_College offers foreign language_teaching by voice mail , enabling a teacher miles away to correct a student ' s accent . &quot; We have multiple senses , right ? &quot; said Sally M . Johnstone , director of the Western Cooperative for Educational Telecommunications in Boulder , Colo . &quot; So we might have some video , some computing , some audio conferencing , some faxing back and forth of quick written material . There ' s now a whole basket of technological tools that can be used. &quot; About 1 # 000 students are enrolled in the University of Phoenix on-line degree_programs . About 1 # 500 students have taken on-line courses through Connected Education Inc. in White Plains , N.Y. , since 1985 . And thousands of others have taken classes and earned degrees through other forms of long-distance learning . Prices vary . A single three-credit course through Connected Education costs $ 1 # 344 . Juster ' s MBA will end_up costing $ 16 # 000 to $ 17 # 000 , he figures . In most cases , the telephone_calls necessary to link up with an on-line service are local or toll-free . * Part of the appeal of distance learning is obvious : In most cases , no one has to be any place at any time . An engineer , say , who hopes to keep_abreast in a rapidly evolving field and be positioned for a lucrative promotion can take long business trips and even be transferred cross-country without ever missing a class or exam . Barry Galloway , 40 , of Springfield , Va. , designs training_programs for companies . He works for a consulting group but wants to eventually go_out on_his_own . So he recently got a master_of_science degree in instructional and performance technology from Boise State University via computer rather than attend the University of Maryland , 90 minutes away . Margie Whiteleather , 28 , of Ashland , Ohio , found other advantages . She has an undergraduate degree from Yale College . Now she is working her way , on-line , toward a master ' s degree in media studies from the New School for Social Research in New York City through Connected Education . Naturally shy and reticent in &quot; in-person &quot; classes , Whiteleather says she participates far more on-line . Students with impaired hearing for whom English is a second language also thrive on-line . In addition , prejudices are undermined . &quot; I don ' t know if these people are white , black , yellow , fat , thin , tall , overweight or have a speech impediment , &quot; said Mark Eisley , who runs the Boise State program . &quot; Things that might cause a bias or a hesitation to participate aren ' t there. &quot; For college administrators , too , distance courses are suddenly hot . Faced with dwindling resources , rising demand and shifting student demographics , schools in states such_as California are finding it makes_sense to try educating people at_home or at_work rather than squandering scarce money on new buildings that future students will be too busy to reach . &quot; Many universities are starting to see that this could be a path out of the problems they are facing , in terms of more students than they could possibly educate in their current buildings or with their current faculty , &quot; said Lin Foa , deputy director of the Annenberg / CPB Projects in Washington , which supports the development of courses and course materials to improve the quality of and access to education . But how good is this form of education ? Students seem pleased , although they say some teachers use the technology more effectively than others . Some students feared that their courses would be too easy but have been pleasantly surprised . It ' s easy to fall_behind , they say ; motivation and self-discipline help . Unfortunately , few programs have been systematically evaluated . &quot; Not enough effort has been put into assessment , frankly , &quot; said Jay Donahue , a senior program officer at the Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education at the U.S. Department_of_Education . The evaluations that have been performed are encouraging , researchers say . In New Jersey , researchers offered identical undergraduate and graduate courses on-line and in_person over three years . When they compared each group ' s exams and grades , the only significant differences had occurred in the computer_science courses . The on-line students had done better . Starr Roxanne Hiltz , a pioneer in the use of computer conferencing in education who conducted the experiment at New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark and Uppsala College in East Orange , believes the main advantage of on-line classes is that they encourage collaborative , or group , learning . Students work more closely with one another , and the role of the professor shifts . &quot; There is a change in the role of the lecturer , who stood_up there expounding truth with a capital T , to a kind of learning facilitator and coordinator who pulls_together a set of resources , issues and questions , &quot; she said . It is much more possible to give group assignments and require teamwork because the technology negates the usual barriers to getting_together . Remarkably , some evaluations have found that students and faculty prefer distance education because there is more student-faculty interaction , particularly when computer conferencing is used . &quot; My on-line students are more personal with me than my traditional students , &quot; Hiltz said . Some professors , however , have other concerns . Sondra Farganis teaches social theory at the New School for Social Research and is about to teach her first on-line class . The prospect thrills and fascinates her . But she wonders if she will still be able to convey her passion for her subject . &quot; I would worry about it turning_into a kind of chatty talk_show , &quot; said Robert Polito , a writer and poet who is also embarking upon teaching his first on-line course at the New School . &quot; In a classroom discussion , a teacher provides a lot of focusing and redirection. &quot; There are legal , ethical and logistic questions , as well . Should faculty be evaluated differently than in the past if they are teaching on-line ? What about copyrights ? And if a professor agrees to videotape a course for later use , can the university continue to use the videotape long after the teacher has left for another job ? But while those issues are sorted_out , Juster moves methodically toward graduation . &quot; A day doesn ' t go_by that I don ' t apply something that I ' ve learned , &quot; he said .

Some Intelligent Talk -- Without Saying a Word During an on-line course last year called Artificial Intelligence and Real_Life , offered by Connected Education Inc. of White Plains , N.Y. , and the New School for Social Research in New York City , Prof . Paul Levinson asked his students to discuss computer theory pioneer Alan Turing ' s famous test of artificial_intelligence : If we can ' t tell the difference between the way a machine behaves ( or &quot; talks &quot; or &quot; writes &quot; to us ) and the way a human does , then by what criteria do we deny the machine human intelligence ? The on-line discussion that ensued lasted for weeks , leaping from the subject of the soul to Star Trek and beyond . Here is a sampling of the E-mail exchanges . 2 / 2 / 93 , 6:45 a.m. * Student 1 : I remember reading some of the text of . . . computer-human exchanges and thinking it fairly inane . But then I listened to a_couple_of teen-agers recently and perhaps it was not so far off . 2 / 6 / 93 , 7:31 p.m. * Student 2 : &quot; Smart &quot; machines are indeed fantastic -- within limits , machines have some of the capabilities of human intelligence . But , does the machine have the ability to reason ? . . . So what does a machine have to do to pass my Turing test ? Show that it ' s alive ? It ' s not . 2 / 7 / 93 , 11:07 a.m. * Student 3 : It may be true that we have the ability to distinguish reality from illusion , but we also have the ability to choose not to . My neighbor believes that her dead dog visits her nightly . . . I do not , however , choose to perceive an intelligent piece of plastic and circuitry to be a living being . 2 / 7 / 93 , 5:38 p.m. * Student 4 : At first I thought this course ( no offense ) was going_to muddel around in speculation and low-level , widely known facts ( at least to me ) but it seems you really are quite competent ( giggle-ha-ha ) . 2 / 8 / 93 , 11:08 a.m. * Levinson : I was hoping someone would seriously introduce the notion of soul here . How about taking a shot at defining it for us -- and in what way it is different from other qualities like intelligence , emotion , personality , etc. ? 2 / 9 / 93 , 11:13 p.m. * Student 5 : Tell me more about this dead dog thing . Might make a good pet for those of us who are allergic to almost all living things ! 2 / 11 / 93 , 8:35 p.m. * Student 6 : To continue with the debate on souls , . . . if the soul has something to do with &quot; essential being &quot; and &quot; what makes us tick , &quot; is our essential being something we all have in common or what makes each individual unique ? I ' d opt_for the latter in my definition of soul . . . People in beer commercials and other lifestyle ads are good representatives of soulless beings . 2 / 14 / 93 , 9:04 p.m. * Student 6 : Hey , ( Student 2 ) , I just reread all my questions to you about the divine and what not , and realized that in my editing frenzy in the wee hours I might have come_across like a lawyer cross-examining a witness . 2 / 14 / 93 , 9:31 p.m. * Student 5 : So , back to the question of what is a soul . . . I ' m not sure a soul qualifies as matter but I ' m still having a hard_time grasping anything that ' s not solid , liquid or gas . 2 / 15 / 93 , 2:23 p.m. * Student 3 : ( Student 6 ) , I just read your new note -- don ' t worry about all_of the questions -- they make all_of this much more interesting . Besides , challenges are good for the soul .</TEXT>
