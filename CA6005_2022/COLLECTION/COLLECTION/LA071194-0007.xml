   <TEXT> Cancer . Four years ago , I was told that my type of lymphoma had a high cure rate . Two years ago , after a nonstop arsenal of almost every chemotherapy drug ever invented , daily radiation treatments for two months and a month ' s stay in a hospital isolation room completing a bone_marrow transplant , I was handed a terminal prognosis . I was given the option of receiving more chemotherapy , even though all my treatment in the past had failed . I lay_in bed with a pharmacy of pills and a stockpile of alternative cancer literature and pondered my next move . Even with the hope of a possible cure , it had been difficult enough to face the continuous needles and nausea of chemotherapy . Now , they called me &quot; terminal &quot; and tried to sell me on the idea of continued chemotherapy as &quot; the only thing to do. &quot; My heart told me that , at only 19 , I was far from ready to die . My books told me there was a cornucopia of alternative treatments to try . My mind told me there was only one thing to do : I was going_to heal myself or die trying . I was immediately attracted to and intrigued with the macrobiotic_diet . Both a philosophy and nutritional system , macrobiotics theory is that cancer growth can be slowed or even stopped when one adheres to an all organic , radically low-fat , low-protein , no sugar , high-fiber diet -- basically a whole grain , vegetable-based diet . I flew to the Berkshires of New England and for 10 days embarked_on a new way of eating . Black seaweed . Sticky brown_rice . Bitter greens . These would become my staple foods . It wasn ' t an easy transition . Pain riddled my cancerous body . A mourning of all_the past foods and restaurants I loved surfaced . But day by day , meal by meal , I persevered . Gradually I was getting stronger and the cancer , while it wasn ' t vanishing , was stabilizing . I also began to enjoy my new diet . I was metamorphosing myself from a fast-food junkie into a connoisseur of whole grains and vegetables . Cooking became my passion . I looked_at each day as another opportunity to create fresh , healthy and beautiful meals . With my new-found energy , I also learned yoga and started seeing a therapist to figure_out patterns of behavior that were limiting me . My symptoms of disease , now not constant , would come and go like night and day . I ' d have a great day and then all_of a sudden at 1 o ' clock_in the morning , I ' d wake_up crying in pain . I was not bedridden nor was I the picture of radiant health I worked so hard to achieve . But there was more : Something gave_way inside of me and I began focusing_on getting the most out of my life by turning my physical limitations into limitless thinking . New , exciting &quot; firsts &quot; happened . My first camping experience . My two-and-a-half- year absence from school ended as I began college . For the first time in my life , I cultivated meaningful and deep friendships . I resolved to live each day to my fullest , taking loving care of myself , and , through relaxation and deep breathing , not getting overwhelmed during times of physical pain . A few months ago I celebrated my two-year survival since the doctor ' s ( not mine ) issuance of a terminal prognosis . I recently saw my oncologist who humbly admitted that I did more for myself than he could have ever dreamed of doing for me . While the words &quot; cured &quot; or even &quot; remission &quot; are not something he or even I would use , we both know that what I ' ve accomplished is pretty special . Quite recently , a lump in my groin has been exploding in size . Pain-free moments are few and far between . There are still many possible treatments . I could try a newly invented chemotherapy regime or one of the many non-mainstream alternative treatments . It seems very much like two years ago revisited . Inside me , beneath the joy of being alive and the pain I endure from being alive , is my intuitive spirit . I will let it guide me down the path that is right for me . My journey continues .</TEXT>
