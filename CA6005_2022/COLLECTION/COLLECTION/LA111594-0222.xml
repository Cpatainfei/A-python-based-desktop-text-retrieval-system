   <HEADLINE> KEVORKIAN LICENSE HEARING FRIDAY ; MEDICINE : PHYSICIAN DUBBED ' DR . DEATH ' IS ASKING COURTS TO RESTORE HIS RIGHT TO PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA , WHICH HE LOST IN PART FOR ASSISTING IN THE SUICIDE OF A COSTA MESA MAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jack Kevorkian , dubbed &quot; Dr. Death &quot; for assisting in 21 suicides , including that of a Costa Mesa man , will seek reinstatement of his California medical license at a court hearing Friday , state officials said Monday . The Medical Board of California voted to revoke Kevorkian ' s license in July , citing among other cases that of cancer patient Jonathan Grenz , an Orange County real_estate_agent and one of two Californians who traveled_to Kevorkian ' s home state of Michigan to obtain help in committing suicide . Deputy Atty . Gen . Thomas Lazar said Monday that the case involving Grenz helped form the cornerstone of the state ' s evidence against Kevorkian , who obtained a California medical license in 1957 and worked_at two hospitals in Long_Beach from 1979 to 1982 . Grenz , 44 , was found to have cancer in 1992 , and doctors removed his voice_box and tongue . But at the time he committed suicide with Kevorkian ' s help , he had recovered from the cancer , according to testimony from a friend and co-worker , Linda Healy . Kevorkian , 66 , was later charged with murder in Michigan , where authorities cited his having assisted in the suicides of Grenz and Martha Ruwart , 40 , of Cardiff by the Sea , whose duodenal cancer had invaded her small_intestine and ovaries with numerous tumors . Friday ' s hearing will be in Los Angeles Superior_Court . Kevorkian has also filed suit in U.S. District Court , alleging that California ' s revocation of his medical license constitutes a violation of his civil_rights . That matter will be heard in Los Angeles on Dec . 12 . Meanwhile , the Michigan Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on a variety of cases affecting Kevorkian , whose medical license has been suspended in his home state . In May , the Michigan Court of Appeals overturned the state law designed to stop Kevorkian ' s practice of assisted suicide but ordered murder_charges reinstated against him . The Michigan Supreme Court then agreed to hear the case . Joining Kevorkian as a co-plaintiff in the federal_court case is an unidentified Los Angeles man who is dying of AIDS and who protests California ' s ban on physician-assisted suicide , according to Kevorkian ' s Los Angeles attorney , Mark Field , who noted that the man is not a client of Kevorkian ' s . &quot; But this principle California follows applies to everybody , &quot; Field said , &quot; not just Jack Kevorkian . It prevents everyone in California from being able to control the timing and dignity of their death . It forces them to suffer and deprives them of any meaningful control over the end of their lives. &quot; As for Kevorkian ' s California license , Field said , &quot; obviously , we feel the state was wrong . Otherwise , we would n ' t have challenged it in Superior_Court . Aside from that , we feel a sense of puzzlement . Why did the California Medical Board feel it necessary to jump into a dispute that ' s being handled entirely in Michigan , where each of the 21 suicides has taken_place ? Why is it California ' s business ? &quot; California and Michigan were the only states in which Kevorkian was licensed to practice medicine . Under California law , Kevorkian had the right to protest the suspension and later the revocation of his license through the administrative_law process . But at numerous hearings in San Diego , he failed to attend or send a representative , choosing instead to pursue the_matter in state and federal_courts . Part of the state ' s contention , according to Deputy Atty . Gen . Lazar , is that Kevorkian had the right to protest the suspension and revocation by &quot; exhausting administrative remedies before the Medical Board. &quot; His decision to reject those options is grounds for dismissal , Lazar said .</TEXT>
