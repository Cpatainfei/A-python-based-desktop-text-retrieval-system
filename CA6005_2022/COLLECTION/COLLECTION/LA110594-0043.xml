   <HEADLINE> CANADA MOVES TO LIMIT IMMIGRATION ; POLICY : THE SHIFT AWAY FROM GIVING PRIORITY TO RECENT ARRIVALS ' FAMILY MEMBERS SIGNALS U-TURN BY GOVERNMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Californians prepare to vote Tuesday on whether to cut_off most public social_services to illegal immigrants , an emotional debate is surging through Canada on a similar issue . While illegal immigration is negligible in Canada , in recent years there has been a growing chorus of complaint that legal immigrants cost Canadian taxpayers too_much in welfare and other social_services . In response , Immigration Minister Sergio Marchi this week announced a drop_in legal immigration levels for the coming year and a policy shift away from family unification and toward immigrants who bring with them sought-after work skills , personal wealth and an ability to speak English or French , Canada ' s official languages . &quot; The days when Canada required a large pool of unskilled labor are long gone , &quot; said Marchi in a report to Parliament . &quot; Today the country needs people who are entrepreneurial , have good language skills and are able to adjust to a rapidly changing labor_market . The criteria used to select immigrants must reflect this change. &quot; The reaction was immediate and heated . &quot; The real reason why people want to limit immigration is racism , &quot; said Emmanuel Dick , vice_president of the Canadian Ethnocultural Council . &quot; There is still the prevailing colonial mind-set in this country that ' real Canadians ' are only those who are descended from British and French stock. &quot; On the political right , the new policy was denounced as not going_far enough . &quot; Pure smoke and mirrors , &quot; pronounced Art Hanger , a member_of_Parliament from Calgary and spokesman for the conservative Reform Party , which has made restriction of immigration an integral part of its platform . Marchi ' s announcement represents a political U-turn for the governing Liberal_Party of Prime_Minister Jean Chretien , who campaigned last year on pledges to hold immigration to recent levels and continue to give priority to family unification . It also is laden with irony for Marchi , who arrived in Canada from Argentina at age 3 with his Italian-born parents . Marchi , 38 , is fond of talking_about how his father arrived in Canada with $ 40 and no English and found success . Asked by reporters whether his father would have made_it into the country under the new rules , Marchi replied that times have changed . Canada , the United States , Australia and Israel are the only nations that accept large_numbers of legal immigrants . In recent years , Canada has set immigration levels at about 1 % of the total population . Like Americans , Canadians regard their country a land_of_opportunity and freedom for newcomers . But a backlash against immigration has been building_in recent years , coinciding with an increase in immigration from Asia , a long , deep recession that is just ending and the arrest of immigrants in a_few highly publicized crimes this year , mainly in Toronto . Much of the criticism is directed against family unification , a program that allows recent arrivals to Canada to sponsor the immigration of family members , including adult children , parents and grandparents , on the promise that they will provide financial_support . Although statistics show that a smaller percentage of immigrants receives social_assistance than the Canadian public at_large , Marchi estimated that lapsed sponsorships cost Canada $ 700 million in social_assistance to immigrants last year . Marchi said the government will lower total immigration from a projected 230 # 000 this year to between 190 # 000 and 215 # 000 in 1995 . The family unification program will be directed more at spouses and minor children , and applicants will have to show that they can maintain a sponsorship , including perhaps posting a bond . Over the rest of the decade , the government intends to reduce the percentage of family unification immigration from 51 % to 44 % . Immigrants admitted for economic reasons -- those with desired skills and capital -- will increase from 43 % to 53 % over the same period . Canada will also increase the number of political refugees accepted next year from 24 # 000 to 32 # 000 . In what is becoming a trademark of the Chretien government , the policy_change was announced after a long period of public hearings and study . Marchi said more_than 10 # 000 Canadians were consulted in the process . Similar studies are under way on foreign_policy and reform of social_assistance programs . A review of defense_policy also was just recently completed .</TEXT>
