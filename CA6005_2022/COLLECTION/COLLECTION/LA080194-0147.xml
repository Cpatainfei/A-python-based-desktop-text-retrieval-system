   <HEADLINE> BOMBINGS UNDERSCORE WORLD ' S VULNERABILITY ; MIDEAST : MORE DEADLY ATTACKS AGAINST JEWS ARE FEARED . ISRAEL SAYS PEACE PLANS MUST NOT SUCCUMB TO TERRORISM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A white delivery_van parks on a Monday morning in front of a building in downtown Buenos Aires that houses many of Argentina ' s Jewish organizations . A few minutes later , a quarter-ton of explosives in the van are detonated , demolishing the building . Ninety-six people are killed , 230 are wounded . A day later , a man believed to be Lebanese and using a crudely forged U.S. passport boards a small commuter plane in Panama -- and shortly after takeoff blows it up with a bomb he is carrying . Twenty other people die with him -- 12 of them Jewish businessmen . In London a week later , a well-dressed , middle-aged woman described as &quot; Middle Eastern &quot; or &quot; Mediterranean &quot; parks her car next to the Israeli Embassy , tells a police_officer she is visiting friends next door and walks_off , a department_store shopping_bag in_hand . Minutes later , the car explodes , heavily damaging the embassy and wounding 14 people . At 12:45 the next morning , another car_bomb goes_off outside a north London building housing Jewish community organizations . Five people are wounded . From four terrorist strikes in nine days , profoundly troubling questions arise : Are Jews around the world -- not only Israelis but all Jews -- now targets in a new surge of Middle_East terrorism , a campaign able to strike globally with deadly suddenness ? Can the Middle_East peace process , still fragile despite the breakthroughs of the past year , survive such murderous attacks ? Or will terrorism push the region toward war once again ? Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , speaking_to his colleagues at a special Cabinet meeting last week , responded to those questions with characteristic bluntness : &quot; Jews once again are being killed precisely because they are Jews . The motive this time is to halt the search for peace . We know where the trail leads . Israel will do all within its power to find and punish those responsible_for these bombings . Peace must_not succumb to terror. &quot; Yet the bombings showed how vulnerable the Jewish communities of the Diaspora are , whether in security-conscious Britain or remote Panama . In the sober judgment of Israeli and Western intelligence_analysts and counterterrorism specialists , any Jewish group virtually anywhere in the world is now a potential target , with Israeli and high-profile Jewish institutions at a significantly higher risk . &quot; Perhaps the most dangerous time is still ahead as the peace process is actually implemented and as barriers between Mideast states come_down , &quot; commented Bruce Hoffman , co-director of the Center for Terrorism and Conflict Studies at St . Andrew ' s University in Scotland . &quot; As peace takes_hold , terrorists will have even more to lose and more motivation to demonstrate their capacity as spoilers. &quot; The driver of the Renault van in Buenos Aires had carefully positioned it just outside the front_doors of the building housing the social_service organizations of Argentina ' s Jewish community of 250 # 000 . It was a_few minutes before 10 a.m. on July 18 , a time when the building would be filling with more_than 100 employees and clients . Inside , the brothers Schalit had arrived to arrange their father ' s funeral with the Argentine-Jewish Mutual Assn. , which operates four Jewish cemeteries . Veronica Goldenberg , a receptionist for the Delegation of Argentine-Jewish Assns. , had taken her position working the phone banks . Her colleague , Lucia Osiboff , had overslept and was_on her way to work , late . At 9:53 , the car_bomb was detonated , and the seven-story community_center collapsed in a deafening explosion . The Schalit brothers were killed , probably instantly . Goldenberg , 20 , was crushed to death . Osiboff ' s sleepiness had spared her life . The driver of the Renault was blown into many pieces , and what was left of his body was found a full eight days later behind the van ' s charred steering_wheel . &quot; I never saw so_much helplessness , &quot; said Nestor Pelliciaro , 35 , a shopkeeper on the same block . Norberto Libster , a Hebrew teacher who lived across the street , recalled : &quot; Everything was going_in slow_motion . It looked_like a movie , like Lebanon , Bosnia , Sarajevo , anything but the window of my apartment. &quot; Some people were rescued , but by the time specialists arrived from Israel with dogs trained to search through bomb rubble , the recoveries were only of the dead . &quot; This will last forever as a tragic date , as the mutilation of the body and bosom of the Jewish community , &quot; said Ruben Beraja , a banker and the president of the Delegation of Argentine-Jewish Assns . He was having coffee at a cafe three blocks away from the explosion . &quot; Nearly 100 families have buried their loved ones as though a lightning bolt of death struck , &quot; he said . &quot; . . . This will not be forgotten. &quot; The Argentine investigation has focused_on the radical Islamic group Hezbollah ( Party of God ) in Lebanon , on an offshoot called Ansarallah , which claimed responsibility for the bombing , and on Iran as their patron . Authorities are trying to determine if Iranian diplomats provided support for their activities . Sheik Sobhi Tufeili , Hezbollah ' s former secretary_general and now a leader of its most militant wing , is regarded by investigators and counterterrorism specialists as the likely planner of the attack . A break_in the case came when Argentine Judge Juan Jose Galeano traveled secretly to Caracas last weekend to interview Monoucher Motamer , a former Iranian diplomat and now political refugee in Venezuela . Motamer implicated at least two and as_many as five people working_at the Iranian Embassy in Buenos Aires , according to sources familiar_with the investigation . &quot; The information he gave me is of extreme importance , &quot; Galeano said . The Iranian ambassador , Hadi Soleimanpour , was interrogated twice last week at the_Argentine Foreign Ministry amid suspicions that he and his embassy ' s cultural_attache were involved in the bombing . Five people have reportedly been detained for questioning in Buenos Aires . Iran , for its part , rejected accusations of involvement , calling them part of &quot; an American-Zionist conspiracy to justify further aggression &quot; in the Middle_East . But Ansarallah , or the Partisans of God , which Western analysts believe Tufeili heads , said in a statement from Lebanon that it committed the_Argentine and Panamanian bombings and planned more . &quot; Suicide squads ( have been formed ) to confront the Zionist enemy everywhere , &quot; the statement said . &quot; The Argentina and Panama operations are but a proof of our struggle against Zionism. &quot; Lebanese political analysts , however , saw Iranian hands in the bombings . Iran , which last week again voiced its opposition to the Arabs ' expanding peace process with Israel , provides expertise and financing for many militant groups throughout the Middle_East . It created Hezbollah in 1982 , it maintains the anti-Iraq Islamic Alliance in Tehran , it aids the fundamentalist regime in Sudan , and it has links to a variety of militant Islamic groups in the Horn of Africa . Iran also reportedly lost 20 of its Revolutionary Guards in an Israeli attack June 2 on a Hezbollah camp in the Bekaa Valley . Thus , according to this Lebanese analysis , Iran would have had the motive and capability to finance an operation like the Buenos Aires attack , providing logistic_assistance such_as false passports and calling_in expertise from various countries , including Lebanon . &quot; Because this was so well organized , it can ' t be viewed_as a flash in the pan , &quot; a senior U.S. counterterrorism official in Washington said of the attacks . &quot; Striking in the heart of big capitals as well as in the countryside of Panama sends a strong message. &quot; The attacks set_off alarms because of their boldness and changes in tactics . In the past , neither Hezbollah nor Ansarallah has been involved in a systematic series of bombings ; their attacks have generally been tit-for-tat reprisals . And , although Lebanon ' s Shiite extremists have hijacked airliners , they have never carried_out a midair suicide bombing . The four attacks also demonstrated deadly expertise . Advance intelligence in Panama , where the flight patterns of Jewish businessmen were noted , and in one of the most protected sections of London deeply concerns counterterrorism officials . The Panama incident surprised experts -- as a site , for the evident knowledge about the target , and for originality . In London , the bomber coolly talked her way past a roadblock and a police_officer ; her shopping_bag from Harrods department_store showed attention to detail . Counterterrorism specialists also believe that those who carried_out the attacks had deep roots in the places where they were operating ; they noted the local support networks , extensive reconnaissance and preparation . Trained terrorists probably traveled_to each place to carry_out the final planning and oversee the attack , but most work was done_by local supporters . &quot; This appears to have been planned for a long_time , &quot; said Frank Brenchley , chairman of London ' s Research Institute for the Study of Conflict and Terrorism . &quot; It ' s part of a widely spaced campaign that includes Buenos Aires , Panama and the attempt to bomb the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok , Thailand , in March . That kind of planning must be done months ahead . . . . I think this is not the end of the process . They may hit targets in other high-profile capitals like Paris and Rome. &quot; Intelligence_analysts and counterterrorism officials are increasingly convinced that the major factor_in the attacks was the confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon . Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging blows for more_than a decade , mostly in southern Lebanon but sometimes outside the Mideast . Opposition to the peace process , the experts say , was an important but secondary element . &quot; Terrorism is never a direct line , &quot; Hoffman , of the St . Andrew ' s center , said . &quot; It is wheels within wheels , shadows overshadowing other shadows . The big picture is the act in which it occurs : the Mideast peace process . But often there is a little picture that is far more important , like Israel ' s raids on Lebanon . . . . &quot; Hezbollah has to demonstrate to a certain extent that it will not remain idle and that it will defend its followers . The domestic element is the small driving_force . The bigger picture is the unfolding peace process. &quot; Michael Kramer , deputy director of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University , said the success of Israel ' s recent attacks on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon probably led the group to seek softer targets elsewhere for its reprisals . &quot; For a long_time , Hezbollah had ample targets in south Lebanon for launching tit-for-tat attacks against Israel , &quot; Kramer said . &quot; Only when they were overwhelmed by some Israeli strike that they couldn ' t respond to locally have their eyes turned abroad. &quot; Hezbollah ' s first foreign targets were French and not Jewish , he noted , recalling a series of devastating bomb attacks in Paris in 1985 and 1986 intended to discourage France from supporting Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War . Hezbollah ' s black_flag with its insignia of a raised rifle flies across Beirut ' s fetid southern suburbs and other impoverished neighborhoods where Shiite Muslims , displaced by the fighting in southern Lebanon , have taken refuge . With further strongholds in southern Lebanon , in Baalbek and parts of the Bekaa Valley , Hezbollah would appear to have lost little of its radicalism of the 1980s , when its bombings of American targets and kidnaping of foreign hostages made_it one of the most feared names in the Middle_East . Hezbollah ' s leaders today , however , stress its role not as a militia but as a political_party with deputies in the Lebanese Parliament . It runs more charitable and service organizations , including hospitals , pharmacies and schools , than the government . It should be seen as a member of the broad Islamic coalition against the negotiations with Israel . Hezbollah had no connection with the bombings , asserted Hussein Khalil , chief of Hezbollah ' s political department , in an interview . He dismissed the Israeli allegations as an attempt to justify further attacks on Lebanon and to &quot; tarnish the image of the resistance. &quot; Khalil , in tailored black pants and a pullover , greets visitors in an elegantly appointed reception_room , full of plush sofas and beautifully inscribed quotations from the Koran . It seems an island of cultivated civility in one of the foulest quarters of Beirut ' s sweltering , overcrowded southern suburbs . Yet the talk there is tough and uncompromising . Recent Israeli strikes in Lebanon were an attempt to destabilize the country , Khalil said , charging that &quot; Israel is interested in creating divisions in Lebanon and re-creating the state of civil_war . . . . &quot; We usually fight the Israelis on our own soil , but when Israel wants to expand its aggression against Lebanon , sometimes we are forced to expand our range of reprisal , even if it takes_in the whole land of northern Palestine . Whenever aggression expands , reprisals must expand. &quot; Still tougher talk comes from Tufeili , the Hezbollah leader suspected in the Buenos Aires bombing . &quot; Even if the whole world signs peace with the Jews , we will continue to fight them , &quot; he told the Beirut newspaper L ' Orient-Le Jour . He denied any role in the attack . Israel has encouraged speculation that , just as it did after 11 of its athletes were killed at the 1972 Munich Olympics , its intelligence_agents would methodically hunt_down and kill those responsible_for the Buenos Aires bombing . &quot; Just as we found solutions to terror in the past . . . so too a solution will be found to Iranian terror , &quot; a senior general told Israeli military correspondents last week . But Rabin is under considerable pressure from the Clinton_Administration not to retaliate directly or immediately , according to officials here and in Washington , for fear this would widen the circle of reprisals , escalating attacks by Shiite extremists and bringing them to the United States . There were real fears , based on what FBI officials described as firm intelligence , that Hezbollah or another Iranian-backed group was ready to mount a terrorist campaign against Israeli and Jewish institutions in New York and other American cities . There was also concern among some diplomats that the peace process -- Israel ' s new relationship with Jordan , the development of the self-governing Palestinian Authority , the just-starting-to-move talks with Syria -- could be enveloped by a wave of terror . But U.S. officials claimed they are confident that current Israeli-Arab peace efforts would not be halted by either an upsurge in terrorism or a cycle of violence in which Israel retaliates for each attack and , in turn , provokes more suicide bombings . &quot; We will , I am convinced , ultimately see a lasting and comprehensive peace for the Arabs and Jews , &quot; Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher told the House Foreign Affairs Committee Thursday . &quot; Those results , of course , will be the best answer_for terrorists. &quot; Acknowledging that &quot; the terrorist bombings in Latin_America and London serve as a tragic reminder that the enemies of peace remain formidable , &quot; Christopher added , &quot; We must take new and strong action to deal with this wave of terrorism. &quot; In the worst-case scenario , combatting Middle_East terrorism worldwide could be even more demanding than making_peace after nearly half a century of war in the region . Counterterrorism officials contend that it will take unprecedented international cooperation on a scale witnessed only once -- during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1990 and 1991 . That lasted only eight months , they point_out , and this effort will require years of coordination , intelligence-sharing and multinational security arrangements . And while Hezbollah is likely to remain the most feared opponent , other radical groups also pose serious threats . Israeli and Western intelligence and counterterrorism experts believe strongly that the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command , led by Ahmed Jibril , and another radical Palestinian group known by the name of its leader , Abu Nidal , will also mount attacks -- and that one or the other may have carried_out the London bombings . An Abu Nidal member is the prime suspect in the assassination of a Jordanian diplomat last spring in Lebanon , and others launched attacks there last year on Fatah , the principal group within the Palestine Liberation Organization . The Abu Nidal group , which has backing from Libya , retains an infrastructure in Europe and through much of the Middle_East , according to intelligence_analysts . As the peace negotiations proceed , it is likely to attempt disruptive attacks since it will have no political role in the future Mideast and thus has nothing to lose . Its targets , according to counterterrorism officials , will probably be Jordanians , Palestinians and finally Israelis . Jibril has been comparatively quiet over the past year , but as Syria enters serious negotiations with Israel his organization stands to lose its base and financial supporter in Damascus . Any Syrian deal with Israel would certainly include an end to backing and refuge for militant groups . Counterterrorism efforts are easy to mobilize when there is a specific threat and an end within sight , experts noted . The current challenge will be an indefinite struggle requiring a focus and a long-term commitment that the international community has never been able to sustain . &quot; It ' s an illusion to think we can ever stop terrorism completely , &quot; Hoffman said , &quot; but we can certainly make_it more difficult to carry out. &quot; But Western resolve to combat terrorism seemed , even to cynical Israelis , renewed and stronger than before . &quot; Imagine car_bombs like that in Buenos Aires in the heart of Manhattan , &quot; a senior Israeli official commented . &quot; Imagine the London bombs going_off on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles and then , 13 hours later , in Pasadena . . . . &quot; After the World Trade Center bombing in New York , we are finally getting U.S. officials to take terrorism seriously . And this is serious : You could have synagogues and Jewish day_schools and community_centers being bombed across America . That is the meaning of Buenos Aires , Panama and London. &quot; Outbreak of Terror A rash of attacks on Jewish targets in Latin_America and Britain showed how vulnerable the Jewish communities of the Diaspora are . Israeli and Western intelligence_analysts say any Jewish group virtually anywhere in the world is now a potential target . * The investigation of a deadly bombing in Argentina has focused_on the radical Islamic group Hezbollah and an offshoot called Ansarallah , both based in Lebanon , and on Iran as their patron . Iran and Hezbollah have denied involvement . * Intelligence_analysts believe the major motivation for the attacks was the confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon , with opposition to the Middle_East peace process a secondary element . * Some diplomats fear a new_wave of terror could damage the peace process between Israel and its Arab neighbors . U.S. officials say they are confident the efforts would not be halted by an upsurge in terrorism .
