   <HEADLINE> 2 PHYSICISTS SIMPLIFY STUDY OF FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPACE ; SCIENCE : DISCOVERY STUNS MATHEMATICIANS . FINDING WILL HELP IN UNDERSTANDING BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ever since Albert Einstein showed that the three-dimensional space we live_in actually curves into an unseen fourth_dimension -- much as the seemingly flat Earth plunges into invisibility over the horizon -- mathematicians have been trying to understand the shape of our universe . It could curve , like the Earth , into a familiar sphere . Or it could have a hole , like a donut . Or even two holes , like a two-handled cup . Now two physicists , Ed Witten of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton and Nathan Seiberg of Rutgers , have made studying these strange spaces tantalizingly simple . Their discovery has electrified mathematicians who have spent decades trying to find ways to describe four-dimensional space . The finding will almost certainly help physicists understand the most fundamental properties of matter . Essentially , Witten and Seiberg figured_out a way to solve problems in the complex world of four-dimensional space that is as simple as it would be in two dimensions . In other words , they took equations that were essentially unsolvable and transformed them into the ordinary equations of everyday calculus . The discovery has packed lecture_rooms at the prestigious Princeton institute where Einstein once worked and scientists around the world , informed over computer_networks , already have begun working_out the implications . In one sense , the physicists ' work is a major embarrassment to mathematicians , who ' ve struggled with the problems of four-dimensional space for decades with limited success . &quot; People in the mathematical community were very skeptical about this at first , &quot; said Sylvain Cappell of NYU ' s Courant Institute of Mathematics , &quot; but now they ' ve been blown away . It ' s an awesome thing that a physicist came_in and did this. &quot; According to Cappell , the discovery has the potential of simplifying an entire field of mathematics into a single 10-page paper . For physicists , the work offers insights into the smallest building_blocks of matter , an area of study that has been stuck since the 1970s due_to its overwhelming mathematical complexity . In the innermost heart of the atom , particles called quarks bind together to comprise all matter . Quarks , it turns_out , have very perplexing properties . Close_together inside a proton , they rattle around freely , like marbles in a bag . But try to pull them apart , and the force between them gets infinitely strong . The harder you pull , the more fiercely they stick_together . Physicists have methods for describing this behavior . &quot; But the equations are impossible to compute , &quot; Seiberg said . &quot; People use massive computers and it still doesn ' t work out. &quot; Now together , Witten and Seiberg have found a way to tackle these complex four-dimensional problems by methods essentially as simple as a two-dimensional problem . The physicists are pleased because they have a model , &quot; a practice case , &quot; Witten calls it , where the problems of quark behavior look workable . Because it ' s simpler than the real_world , it can be solved . &quot; We hope it ' s the same as the real_world , &quot; said Seiberg , &quot; but only time will tell. &quot; In the meantime , mathematicians are both pleased and appalled . &quot; It ' s embarrassing because we didn ' t notice it first , &quot; Cappell said . Why so_much interest in problems of four-dimensional space ? One obvious answer , says mathematician Ron Stern of UC Irvine , is that &quot; it ' s the space we live in. &quot; More interesting to the abstract world of mathematics , it ' s the most quirky space of all . Quirkier , even , than eight-dimensional space . Or 10 # 000-dimensional space . &quot; It ' s ironic , &quot; Stern said , &quot; because we understand one- and two-dimensional manifolds ( surfaces ) . We understand five-dimensions and higher . But we don ' t understand three and four , and those are the ones we live in. &quot; The problem that Witten and Seiberg has solved has to do with equations that were not &quot; commutative &quot; in four-dimensional space . In other words , A times B did not equal B times A . If you rotated something in one direction , and then rotated the same thing in another direction , you would not get the same result as if you performed the rotations in reverse . This made things enormously complicated . In order to understand the universe , physicists like laws_of_nature that are not constantly changing . That is one reason why symmetrical equations are so appealing . It was a similar symmetry , for example , that allowed Einstein to see that energy and matter are just different facets of the same essential stuff . The buzz around Princeton these days has spread from mathematicians from coast to coast . &quot; What we ' re trying to understand is the kind of universe we live_in , &quot; said Stern . &quot; It ' s a sad thing for a mathematician , but in the last 15 years , the physicists have made all_the good insights. &quot; As for the physicists , they ' ve made one step toward understanding the essential quirkiness of quarks . &quot; We ' ve made one step , &quot; Seiberg said . &quot; But it ' s never clear how difficult the next step will be. &quot;</TEXT>
