   <HEADLINE> GRAF TURNS TABLES ON AUSTIN ; WOMEN ' S TENNIS : THE WORLD ' S TOP PLAYER ROLLS TO 6-0 , 6-0 VICTORY IN 43 MINUTES IN EVERT CUP , RECALLS LOSS ALMOST 11 1 / 2 YEARS AGO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steffi Graf spent another 43 minutes on the stadium court in the Evert Cup at Hyatt Grand Champions Wednesday , long enough to overpower Tracy Austin , 6-0 , 6-0 , and avenge her earliest professional defeat . Graf , 24 , was barely a teen-ager when she lost to Austin at Filderstadt , Germany , in her pro debut almost 11 1 / 2 years ago . &quot; When I played Steffi the first time , she was a little kid -- 13 , just starting_out -- and I was at the top , &quot; said Austin , comparing the only two matches between the current and former champions . &quot; Now , I ' m an old_lady at the end of my career and she ' s at the top. &quot; Austin , 31 , is 12 months into her comeback , but is not ready to challenge the top-ranked player on the WTA Tour . &quot; It must be an awful feeling to be_on the other side and to realize that nothing is really working for you , &quot; said Graf , asked to put herself in Austin ' s shoes . &quot; It ' s not a nice spot to be in. &quot; Not that she would know . Graf has dominated women ' s tennis in the absence of Monica Seles , who has not played since last April 30 when she was stabbed by a spectator at a tournament in Hamburg , Germany . Graf has won 62 of her last 64 matches and four consecutive Grand_Slam tournaments . She is 14-0 this year and has yet to lose a set . And it probably didn ' t help Austin that Graf was stung by a comment allegedly made by Austin after their long-ago meeting . Austin , Graf said Tuesday , had told reporters that &quot; there were hundreds of players like me in America. &quot; Graf , though , said she found no inspiration in the perceived slight -- &quot; There was really nothing behind it , &quot; she said of her performance -- and that she regretted bringing it up before the second-round match . &quot; The minute I said it , I said , ' Why did I say it ? ' &quot; she said . Joked Austin , who said Graf had taken her comments out of context : &quot; Maybe I should get some of the credit ( for her rise to No . 1 ) . Maybe I made her mad and motivated . Maybe she could share her trophies with me. &quot; Austin , who won only 21 points Wednesday , said she felt no embarrassment in absorbing only the second shutout loss of her pro career . &quot; She ' s one of the greatest tennis_players of all time , and I did the best that I could , &quot; Austin said . &quot; I have my head_up high . &quot; You know , Aranxta ( Sanchez Vicario ) lost ( to Graf ) , and 2 , at the Australian Open , and she ' s the second-best player in the world . Steffi is . . . I just can ' t describe how good she is right now. &quot; Tennis Notes Second-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez defeated Angelica Gavaldon , 6-3 , 6-3 , and third-seeded Lindsay Davenport , a 17-year-old senior at Murrieta Valley High , defeated Natalia Medvedeva , 6-4 , 6-1 , in first-round matches . . . . Fourth-seeded Natalia Zvereva eliminated Linda Harvey-Wild , 6-3 , 6-3 , in a second-round match . . . . Among the no-shows this week is the woman for whom the tournament is named , Chris Evert , who bowed_out after doctors recommended that she not fly here from her home_in Boca Raton , Fla. , because of minor complications with her pregnancy . . . . Boris Becker has declined an invitation to accept a wild-card entry into the Newsweek Champions Cup , which starts Monday and runs_through March 6 at Grand Champions .</TEXT>
