   <TEXT> ' Monkey Trouble ' -- The review of &quot; Monkey Trouble &quot; in Friday ' s Calendar section characterized the production of the film as sloppy and referred to scenes in which a microphone drops into view . In fact , the version of the film shown to the reviewer was a rough cut , and was billed as such . The print of the film currently in release does not contain those scenes .</TEXT>
