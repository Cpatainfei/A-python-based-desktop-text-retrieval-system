   <HEADLINE> 20-YEAR DEBATE CAN WAIT A LITTLE LONGER ; * QUESTION OF BONES COMES BEFORE BOLSA CHICA PROJECT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After 20 years of debating the fate of the Koll Real_Estate Group development planned for the Bolsa Chica wetlands area , some new uncertainty has appeared in a proposal that was looking_like a sure thing . This month , the Seal Beach City_Council has gone_on record against the development that will contain more_than 4 # 000 homes , citing an increase in traffic along Pacific Coast Highway . And the host council in Huntington Beach decided to call_on the county to produce a new environmental impact report , citing a host of perceived problems with the existing one . With all that , perhaps nothing was quite so dramatic as the debate over the discovery of about 20 concentrations of bones , and the acknowledgment this month by the Orange County coroner ' s office that it will be months before a determination can be made on whether these are human or animal remains . While it would be better to have an answer sooner than later , this matter must be resolved satisfactorily before anything is approved . A group of Native_Americans argues that the 7.4-acre site parcel may once have been a prehistoric burial_site . And the revelation in news_reports last month that an archeologist working for the Koll Real_Estate Group found the bone fragments in 1992 raised new , as yet unresolved , questions about the development . Last week , the City_Council voted to ask_for a grand_jury investigation into Koll ' s handling of the bone fragments . That may_not be necessary , but neither would it be acceptable to proceed with development until questions about the bones are answered . While state law does not rule_out the destruction of Native_American cemeteries , it obviously would be a terrible injustice and violation of sacred land , even if done inadvertently . It should never come_to that . The project should be reconfigured if necessary to ensure protection of the site . Or , if these are animal bones , let the project go_forward as may be appropriate . At the very least , development plans should err on the side of respect for the history of the land . Public pressure alone may persuade the county to require big changes in the project , in_order to save it . The best approach for now is to determine as quickly as possible what the site actually is . Beyond that , the best advice is to go slowly on the project . One question is why it has taken so_long for the confirmation of bones , one set of which is believed to be about 8 # 000 years old . The coroner ' s office has acknowledged the existence of a map that came_to_light last month , even though a forensic anthropologist hired by the office examined the bones found there in 1992 . Judy Myers Suchey , a faculty_member at Cal State Fullerton , said that the handful of bones she had seen were very old , about 8 # 000 years old , and were of interest to archeologists . Project opponents point_out that no mention of the find had been made in the county ' s draft environmental impact report released last year , and it has fueled concern . At this point , there is no reason to doubt the credibility of Tom Mathews , director of planning for the county ' s Environmental Management Agency , which oversaw preparation of the EIR . He said that the discovery was not mentioned in the document because there had not yet been any scientific confirmation of its significance . What the county must do is be certain that it closely monitors the investigation to be certain that the questions about the bones are properly addressed .</TEXT>
