   <HEADLINE> 3-YEAR UNDERCOVER OPERATION YIELDS 1 # 000 POUNDS OF COCAINE ; CRIME : VENTURA COUNTY-BASED PROGRAM DISRUPTS COLOMBIAN CARTELS ' U.S. BUSINESS . EIGHTEEN ARE ARRESTED AND $ 5.8 MILLION SEIZED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal and local authorities in Ventura County have seized $ 5.8 million in cash and nearly 1 # 000 pounds of cocaine as part of a three-year nationwide money-laundering and drug-trafficking case targeting major Colombian cartels . The undercover operation , which was based in Ventura County , led to the arrest of one high-ranking member of the Cali cartel and 17 other members of the Cali and Medellin cartels . No details of the arrests were given , nor were the suspects identified . More arrests are expected as authorities seek a dozen federal indictments in the case next week . Five suspects have been secretly indicted in Los Angeles and Detroit , authorities said . At a press_conference in Ventura on Friday , Ventura County Sheriff Larry Carpenter said the case represents the largest confiscation of drug money in county history and the second-largest seizure of drugs . The largest was a 1989 Simi Valley case involving 2 # 100 pounds of cocaine . &quot; This will become the benchmark , &quot; Carpenter said . Up to $ 2 million of the seized cash could be returned to the Sheriff ' s Department through federal asset-forfeiture laws , he said . The money was seized at a variety of locations in several states over two years , including $ 1 million last month in Thousand Oaks . The joint investigation by U.S. Customs officials and Ventura County deputies was launched in October , 1991 , when an informant arranged a meeting at a_Thousand Oaks hotel between undercover sheriff ' s deputies and a high-level Cali trafficker . &quot; We started_out with the cartel , so we knew we were going_to be at a very significant level , &quot; Carpenter said . Before long , undercover_agents from Ventura County had infiltrated both Colombian cartels and met with traffickers in Los Angeles , Houston , Detroit , Chicago , New York and Newark , N.J. , the sheriff said . Authorities consider the two cartels responsible_for most of the cocaine imported into this country . To gain greater access to the cartels , drug agents set_up an illegitimate money-laundering organization based in eastern Ventura County that would , for a fee , deposit drug profits in U.S. and foreign banks . The sums averaged about $ 500 # 000 and ranged from $ 100 # 000 to several million , said James D . Donahue , resident agent in_charge of the U.S. Customs office in Oxnard . In recent months , the investigation expanded into drug trafficking . On half_a_dozen occasions , agents were paid to transport cocaine , all_of which was seized by other authorities before it reached the street . &quot; In the end , they came_to us to not only launder the money , but to transport drugs , &quot; Donahue said . &quot; We couldn ' t get_into the narcotics early or we would have had to seize it . And that could have tipped them off. &quot; The case was novel because it involved both money_laundering and drug trafficking , authorities said . Donahue said the 960-pound cocaine seizure , worth about $ 44 million on the street , will not set the cartels back significantly . But he said the busts have disrupted drug operations within several subgroups . &quot; Confusion has reigned supreme in the past month , as we had hoped , &quot; he said . By posing as money launderers , authorities identified 30 bank_accounts in Miami , Atlanta , Los Angeles and overseas tied to the cartels ' operations . About $ 300 # 000 has been seized in recent weeks from 21 accounts , Donahue said . Authorities decided to end the investigation last month , when they saw a chance to seize large amounts of both cocaine and cash . On Jan . 12 , undercover_agents were given 458 pounds of cocaine at an undisclosed location in Thousand Oaks to deliver to drug sellers . Two days later , authorities seized $ 1 million in cash_in Thousand Oaks . Another $ 1.5 million was then confiscated in other cities . At the news_conference , authorities laid_out piles of cocaine , packaged in white , black_and_tan wrapping , along with bundles of bills in denominations of $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 , and $ 100 . Investigators would not say whether the suspects are Ventura County residents . But Sgt . Gary Pentis , who heads the sheriff ' s unit that began the investigation , said , &quot; There has been involvement by county residents from the onset of this case. &quot; Some suspects remained unaware of the broader investigation even after they were arrested , because local police stopped them under the guise of traffic violations , then feigned surprise when discovering cash or cocaine in the cars . &quot; They have not yet tied together this particular investigation with why they lost a large amount of cocaine or why a bag of money disappeared , &quot; Pentis said . In addition to customs agents and sheriff ' s deputies , the FBI and police in Chicago , Houston , Detroit , New York , Los Angeles , Glendale , Orange County and Santa Paula assisted in the investigation .</TEXT>
