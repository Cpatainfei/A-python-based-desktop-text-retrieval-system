   <HEADLINE> THE FALL COLLECTIONS / PARIS ; HIGH DRAMA , YES , BUT NOT ON RUNWAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Expect high drama at a Karl Lagerfeld show . This season , though , it had nothing to do with clothes . Well before the lights went_up on the designer ' s fall ' 94 line Monday , a fire_door slammed shut and water began flooding the showroom lobby . People were trapped for several long minutes and rumors circulated about a bomb threat by a women ' s group protesting exploitation of women via fashion . &quot; Not at all , &quot; protested Jacques Mouclier , president of the_French Chambre Syndicale , organizer of the shows . Car-exhaust fumes in the underground parking_lot set_off the alarm , he explained . Meanwhile , another protest brewed on the other side of the fire_door . John Fairchild , publisher of the fashion trade newspaper Women ' s Wear Daily , let it be known that he wants no part of the Robert Altman film &quot; Pret-a-Porter , &quot; on location here . People here fear it will be a fashion version of &quot; The Player , &quot; the director ' s cutting commentary on Hollywood . Waiting for Lagerfeld ' s show to begin , Fairchild stepped_in front of the seats occupied by the U.S. fashion press . &quot; It ' s not fair to us , &quot; he announced , pointing to a notice enclosed in invitations to the Christian Dior show later that day . The insert read : You may be featured in some of the shots . Therefore your presence during the event tacitly implies your consent to being in this film . &quot; We don ' t know what they ' re going to do , &quot; Fairchild continued . &quot; ( This ) reads like a legal thing. &quot; Vogue magazine editor Anna Wintour agreed . &quot; They ' re setting us up , &quot; she said , referring to Altman and company . &quot; Going_to the Dior show is to consent to be in the movie . So we ' re not going_to Dior. &quot; On second thought , she sent a fax to Dior saying she would attend only if the movie lenses were turned_in other directions . Fairchild also showed_up . Both , presumably , were out of camera range . &quot; Altman is a genius -- I just hope he ' s doing something positive , &quot; said Andre Leon Tally , artistic director for Vogue . To those with little at stake , such_as newspaper journalists , the Altman crew has seemed surprisingly unobtrusive . Some have wondered out loud whether this tempest in a cafe_au_lait cup isn ' t the fashion_industry ' s way of getting more attention . The shows do seem in danger of being overpowered this season . Still , Lagerfeld and Dior left an impression . Lagerfeld ' s purple , orange and yellow stretch jersey dresses , piled on top of each other and over pink tights and stiletto-heeled clear plastic boots , were an eyeful . Look_for low-priced versions soon in_stores such_as the Limited and Contempo Casuals . Suits and jackets were the best of this show . After several seasons of unmatched looks , this was a collection of monochromes . Deep green , wine , navy and black short jackets and short skirts , both wide at the hem , gave suits the vigor of a double flying trapeze . Pantsuits , rarely seen in this line , were a strong theme . Longer black gabardine jackets topped skinny pants that crumpled over thick-heeled shoes . Black stretch pants worn with long jackets in gray tweed or solid black had a chic , energetic quality . At Dior , designer Gianfranco Ferre , really put_on the dog , inspired by Altman ' s cameras no doubt . This collection hasn ' t looked so young and with-it in several years . Black leather minis had silver hardware that resembled corsets . Dior showed them with crisp white shirts . Black body wear seemed downright ladylike tucked under long , swashbuckling coats . A furry pink Angora sweater set trimmed with pearls topped a long black chiffon skirt for a sweetly romantic evening look . After the show , &quot; Pret-a-Porter &quot; cast members Lauren Bacall , Kim Basinger and Stephen Rea made like fashion regulars , climbing onto their chairs and hopping_up on the runway to get backstage . So far , the stars have been wearing Valentino , Issey Miyake , Christian Lacroix and Calvin Klein . But at Nino Cerruti ' s show , the press director handed_out a list of who is wearing his label . Basinger , Tim Robbins , Marcello Mastroianni and Forest Whitaker , who plays fashion_designer Simone Lowenthal in the movie , were_on it . And this season ' s collections will appear in the movie , too , posing as Lowenthal originals . Costume_designer Catherine Leterrier , sitting in the front row , took_notes when the runway filled_up with ankle-length man-tailored coats of pale gray worn over deeper gray pin-striped pants and off-white suede Oxfords . Other good looks included a beige suede shirt dress with a flared hem , topped by a deep gray rib-knit coat , both short . The movie bus arrived_at Jean Paul Gaultier ' s show , held_in an abandoned train_depot , and out stepped Sophia Loren in an enormous black hat and dark suit that have been her uniform this week . Her outfit didn ' t look much like the clothes on the runway . Gaultier ' s trans-Siberian fashion trip led past a folkloric montage of sheepskin jackets with fake-fur hoods , silk pajama pants , quilted kimonos , Chinese silk parkas and a_few of his favorite tartan plaid kilts . Lagerfeld crammed his Chloe collection with baby-doll clothes in candy colors . Furry sweaters over taffeta apron-skirts , furry sweaters over little lace dresses and furry dresses with pink puffy sleeves and bubble skirts were clothes to wear to a gooey game of Candyland . To get things rolling at her show on Sunday , Vivienne Westwood put a shot of cognac on every chair . By the time the event started 1 1 / 2 hours late , a lot of people were ready for another round . Still , this was one show worth waiting for . British-based Westwood is_on a mission to preserve such English fashion traditions as hand-knit sweaters , tartan kilts , tweed suits and aristocratic velvet evening wear . Preserve , but not protect . She spins them all on their ear . This time , tweed suits had cushions underneath , to give those svelte super models fat-lady hips . From gold damask curtain fabric worthy of Windsor Castle windows , Westwood cut a long evening skirt with tulip hem , and a matching vest . They went_over a dress of gingham checks , the sort of fabric once saved for kitchen tablecloths . Dark-toned plaid suits with velvet collars , pale tartan kilts with huge paisley stoles , crocheted roses for trim , and an assortment of royal velvet evening_dresses fit for a queen all paid tipsy tribute to Westwood ' s beloved old England .
