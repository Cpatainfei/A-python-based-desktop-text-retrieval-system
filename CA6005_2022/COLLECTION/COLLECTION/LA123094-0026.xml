   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; YELTSIN TAKES GAMBLE WITH CRACKDOWN IN CAUCASUS ; RUSSIA : PRESIDENT ' S FORMER ALLIES ARE NOW AMONG HIS HARSHEST CRITICS . THEY BRAND HIM A KREMLIN HARD-LINER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With his decision to storm the rebel Chechen capital of Grozny , Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin ' s transformation from populist reformer to Kremlin hard-liner is complete , the Russian president ' s many critics say . &quot; Yeltsin is at the point_of_no_return , &quot; political analyst Alexei G . Arbatov said . &quot; He has decided to go_all_out . He thinks he needs no allies because the army and police are_on his side . He spits on the democrats ' love. &quot; As bombs fell on a Grozny orphanage , making a mockery of Yeltsin ' s promise to halt the bombing of civilian targets , democrats who once embraced the former Sverdlovsk Communist_Party boss as the symbol of Russian reform said they can no longer support the Russian president . &quot; I have the feeling that we and the president are living_in two separate information fields , &quot; said liberal economist Yegor T . Gaidar , referring to the growing and sometimes absurd divide between Russian government statements about the conflict in Chechnya and the footage that Russian citizens see on television . &quot; I think he has made a fatal mistake , &quot; Gaidar said . Yeltsin jettisoned Gaidar in January after the liberal economist , the first architect of Russia ' s free-market reforms , led the only party that campaigned under Yeltsin ' s banner to a humiliating defeat in last year ' s parliamentary elections . But Gaidar stayed loyal to Yeltsin , even when the president stopped returning his telephone_calls once Gaidar spoke out against the intervention in Chechnya . In the last two days , Gaidar , former Finance_Minister Boris G . Fyodorov and human_rights activist Yelena G . Bonner , the widow of Nobel Peace Prize-winning dissident Andrei D . Sakharov , have all broken publicly with the president over Chechnya . &quot; A democratic country cannot keep by armed force an ethnic_group that does not want to remain in it , &quot; Bonner wrote in a letter to Yeltsin . Claiming that Russia was turning_back to totalitarianism , she resigned from the president ' s human_rights commission . The liberal Fyodorov had initially supported the crackdown , arguing that multinational Russia must defend its territorial integrity or risk becoming an ethnic Humpty Dumpty . But on Thursday , he blasted the government for causing needless bloodshed through gross military incompetence . Fyodorov and Gaidar said the war in Chechnya threatened to bust the Russian budget , send inflation skyrocketing and shackle this new democracy ' s fragile political freedoms . * Gaidar said he will not seek Yeltsin ' s impeachment , as some have demanded , but hinted that the democrats will be looking_for an alternative to Yeltsin in presidential elections scheduled 18 months from now . &quot; You must pay_for your mistakes if you are president , &quot; he said . In recent weeks , Yeltsin has lost the support of not only the democrats but also most of Russia ' s intellectuals , journalists , members_of_Parliament and many of_his_own senior advisers . One Russian newspaper on Thursday dubbed the president &quot; Bombeltsin. &quot; Far more damaging , at least five army generals have publicly criticized the Russian attack on the tiny Muslim republic . &quot; What is the purpose of killing people ? &quot; Lt . Gen . Alexander I . Lebed , commander of the Russian 14th Army in Tiraspol , Moldova , asked_in an interview with the news_agency Interfax . &quot; Are there no other ways to resolve the problem ? Or would Moscow lose too_much merely by talking to ( Chechen President Dzhokar M. ) Dudayev ? &quot; &quot; The blitzkrieg has failed , &quot; said Deputy Defense Minister Boris V . Gromov , who faces possible dismissal for criticizing the intervention , which he warns could split the armed forces and lead to civil_war . Analysts saw the renewed bombardment of Grozny as a watershed for Yeltsin , who has now thrown_in his lot with the most hawkish of his Kremlin advisers and staked his political future on a quick victory in Chechnya . &quot; He was a populist from the very beginning , not a democrat , &quot; Caucasus scholar Sergei A . Arutiunov said . &quot; He is turning_into a puppet of the hard-line generals surrounding him. &quot; * Among those who appear to have Yeltsin ' s trust are the powerful Security_Council Secretary Oleg I . Lobov , Nationalities Minister Nikolai D . Yegorov and the mysterious head of Yeltsin ' s security service , Maj . Gen . Alexander V . Korzhakov . Although Yeltsin met with Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin to discuss how to restore Chechnya ' s economy , Chernomyrdin seems distanced from his boss of late . Kremlinologists -- who are making a comeback as the decision-making process inside the red brick fortress becomes ever more opaque -- whisper that Korzhakov has been especially influential on Chechnya policy . Yeltsin once described himself as &quot; inseparable &quot; from Korzhakov , who was the KGB bodyguard assigned to Yeltsin when he joined the Politburo . The shadowy Korzhakov ' s powers have come under intense scrutiny since the leaking of an eyebrow-raising letter in which Korzhakov instructed Chernomyrdin to review agreements made with the World_Bank . &quot; Who is running the country -- Yeltsin , Chernomyrdin or Gen . Korzhakov ? &quot; a recent headline in the newspaper Izvestia asked . Though the hawks clearly have the president ' s ear , they may be saying exactly what Yeltsin wants to hear . Some analysts argue that Yeltsin is merely continuing the political metamorphosis he began one year ago , when ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky and the Communists trounced Gaidar and other democrats in elections to Russia ' s first post-Communist Parliament . Liberals who clung_to the comforting thought that the 1993 election results were a fluke have been disabused of the notion this year , when nationalists and Communists triumphed in local by-elections across Russia . Ever the shrewd politician , Yeltsin began redefining himself as the authoritarian &quot; strong hand &quot; that poll after poll say some Russians long for . Less than two years ago , when Zhirinovsky was generally dismissed as an extremist crank , the tireless orator stood_up on a platform in Gorky Park and promised his sparse but zealous crowd that Russia would soon regain its former Caucasian and Black_Sea possessions , along with its battered prestige . Now Zhirinovsky is one of the few lawmakers who support Yeltsin ' s Chechnya policy , along with such &quot; national patriots &quot; as Sergei N . Baburin and Alexander G . Nevzorov , and a coalition of conservative regional officials headed by former Soviet Politburo member Alexander S . Dzasokhov . &quot; In fact , Yeltsin has already embraced Zhirinovsky ' s line , &quot; Arutiunov said . &quot; What he is doing_in Chechnya is exactly what Zhirinovsky would do . So it has happened already. &quot; Over the last year , Yeltsin has also adopted a more stridently nationalist tone on such questions as Bosnia-Herzegovina , NATO membership for Eastern Europe and an early lifting of the trade_embargo against the former Soviet_Union ' s best client , Iraq . This week , the Russian Foreign Ministry once again said Moscow wants changes in the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty , which limits the number of troops it can station in &quot; flank &quot; areas such_as Chechnya . Arguing that the Soviet-era treaty is discriminatory toward Russia in light of its post-Soviet borders , spokesman Grigory B . Karasin complained that the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization has dragged its feet on agreeing to allow more Russian troops to be stationed in the Caucasus . * Karasin hinted that Russia might have to take unspecified measures to protect its national interests if the treaty is not revised soon . Turkey is lobbying NATO against allowing Russia to move more troops southward , concerned that Russia is steadily re-creating its Soviet-era military presence in Armenia , Georgia and Azerbaijan . The bloodier Yeltsin ' s crackdown on Chechnya , the less likely is the West to accommodate Russian demands on such sensitive issues as troop limits and the expansion of NATO . With polls showing that 75 % of Russians no longer support him , Yeltsin is clearly gambling that a quick victory in Chechnya will revive his authority and his popularity . The danger is that the Chechen war will cost more money and political goodwill than Yeltsin expects . Most wars do . Russia ' s first freely elected president could wind_up jeopardizing both economic progress and the support of the West . That could hurt even a Kremlin hard-liner .</TEXT>
