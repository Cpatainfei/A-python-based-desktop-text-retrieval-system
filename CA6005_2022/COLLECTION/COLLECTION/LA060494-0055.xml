   <HEADLINE> BLOW AWAY ALL THE SMOKE ; WERE SIGNERS MISLED ON PHILIP MORRIS-BACKED PETITION ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There ' s no doubt that a lot of voters who signed petitions to qualify a smoking initiative for the November ballot in California thought they were supporting a tough anti-smoking plan . In fact , the measure ' s aim is to weaken existing local restrictions on smoking in public places . The reasonable question is whether the signers were deliberately misled . Acting Secretary_of_State Tony Miller is one of those who believes they were . He wants permission from a Sacramento court to ask 400 or more randomly chosen signers what they were told by signature gatherers . Miller says documents indicate the petition circulators were told not to reveal that the initiative would wipe_out strong local anti-smoking laws . Nor was the sponsor of the initiative to be identified as Philip Morris , the nation ' s largest tobacco company , which has spent just under $ 500 # 000 to qualify it . Had that been known , many might have had second_thoughts about signing the petitions . Philip Morris denies any wrongdoing , and there apparently is no precedent of a court allowing the kind of questioning of petition signers that Miller has requested . Certainly , too , this is not the first initiative to be signed by voters who were unclear or in the dark about what they were lending their names to . Noting all that , health-conscious Californians are still left with the dismaying prospect of finding a regressive and deceptive so-called anti-smoking initiative on their November ballot . That measure would wipe_out many of the gains made at the local level to ban smoking in public places , allowing instead a statewide easing of rules on smoking in restaurants that -- no surprise -- would benefit the initiative ' s sponsor . What the court will do with Miller ' s request is uncertain . What the voters should do if this duplicitous initiative reaches the ballot is as clear as can be .</TEXT>
