   <HEADLINE> CONFERENCE SAFETY A PRIORITY IN CAIRO ; TOURISM : EGYPT HOPES PEACEFUL POPULATION MEETING WILL REDEEM REPUTATION OF CAPITAL CITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For weeks , the bloom on this dusty old city had been almost palpable . New , young trees were planted in boulevard medians , curbs were repainted , pothole-peppered streets were repaved . The whole country almost seemed to be pulling itself out of the_doldrums . After three years of Islamic militant violence had choked the life out of the $ 3-billion-a-year tourist industry , a six-month lull in tourist attacks seemed to put all that in the past . Hotel bookings started climbing , and summer tourism rose 14 % over last year . It was with this air of confidence that Egypt prepared_for what officials are calling the largest tourist event in its history : the U.N.-sponsored International Conference on Population and Development , scheduled to bring 20 # 000 delegates -- including world leaders such_as Vice_President Al Gore and former President Jimmy_Carter -- into the Egyptian_capital starting Monday . Then , last week , Islamic gunmen opened_fire on a tour bus in southern Egypt , killing a Spanish teen-ager and wounding three others . The militant Gamaa al Islamiya followed up its claim of responsibility with a warning to foreigners : &quot; The Gamaa advises all foreigners taking_part in the licentious conference known as the Population Conference that , by taking_part in this conference , which all sectors of the Egyptian people have rejected . . . , they are putting themselves in danger ' s way. &quot; One week later , the gunmen suspected in the bus attack were themselves killed by Egyptian police , and Tourism Minister Mamdouh Beltagi was confidently brushing_aside the Islamic warnings . &quot; It is very easy to send a fax warning . That is not automatically to be considered as credible , &quot; he said . But by night , Beltagi is going_home and putting an ice_pack on his head . For Egypt -- where tourism revenues can make or break an economy that depends_on them as its largest source of foreign currency -- much depends_on the peaceful outcome of the conference . And security is only part of Beltagi ' s headache . He must also coordinate transportation for delegates from hotels all_over Cairo , through the city ' s legendary traffic snarls and out_to the modern new conference_center on the city ' s eastern edge . He must arrange for computer link-ups , satellite feeds and journalists demanding mobile phones . Logistics alone prompted worries in a city that almost routinely turns its annual international film festival into a fiasco by mixing_up the show times and leaving VIPs stuck waiting for seats at the opening_night gala . And the worries weren ' t eased by Wednesday and Thursday , when delegates from non-governmental organizations and journalists had to wait up_to four hours for their conference badges . A near-riot broke_out Wednesday when CNN showed_up and moved to the front of the line . Yet , for everything that could go_wrong , Egypt has been moving ahead with remarkable aplomb . Leave has been canceled for all security services , and 14 # 000 police and soldiers have been assigned to guard the conference -- patrolling streets , monitoring hotels , safe-guarding tourist sites , such_as the Pyramids , and Islamic monuments . Metal detectors are in place at all hotels , and , as has been the custom for months , guards check all bags brought into foreign-style eateries such_as Kentucky Fried Chicken and Baskin-Robbins . Dozens of Nile cruise boats have been brought_up as floating hotels to accommodate conference guests who are not staying in luxury hotels that line the banks of the river . Buses will travel from all hotels to the conference site , wired with thousands of new telephone_lines , modems , faxes and on-line computer links . &quot; This conference is a certification for Egypt from the international community of security , stability , carrying capacity , organizational and touristic capabilities , &quot; Beltagi said , noting that Egypt has hosted 24 international conferences this year . &quot; People talk_about security when security in Egypt has always been strong , &quot; Beltagi said . &quot; The U.S. , with the best security services in the world , you were not_able to prevent the assassination of a President . . . and you have not been able to control criminality . But has tourism to Miami been affected ? In Washington or New York , where more_than one person is killed a night , have tourists stopped going ? &quot; Yes , the international conference is important for tourism . But tourism to Egypt is in the long range -- it is already booming , and the indications are that it will continue to boom again . We are very hopeful there will be no accidents. &quot;</TEXT>
