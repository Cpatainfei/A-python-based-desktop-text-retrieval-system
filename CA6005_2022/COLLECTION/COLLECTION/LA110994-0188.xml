   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL SPEEDS HAND-OVER IN BID TO BOOST ARAFAT ; MIDEAST : PALESTINIANS WILL SOON GET AUTHORITY IN THE WEST_BANK . PLO LEADER ' S POPULARITY HAS BEEN DECLINING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Faced with evidence that Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat ' s political base is rapidly eroding , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin promised Tuesday to speed_up the hand-over of authority in the West_Bank and accelerate negotiations on Palestinian elections . Emerging from two hours of talks near Erez , the crossing point between Israel and the Gaza Strip , Arafat and Rabin said they had made progress on some of the many issues bedeviling Israeli-Palestinian relations . Rabin announced that Israel will transfer authority in the West_Bank to the Palestinians for tourism , welfare , health and taxation by the end of the month . In September , Israel transferred authority for education to the Palestinians . But the Israelis refused to relinquish the administration of the other services until they were assured that donor countries would supply enough money to fund them . Rabin said Tuesday that adequate funding will be available by the end of the month . Rabin also accepted a Palestinian suggestion for speeding_up talks on holding elections in Gaza and the West_Bank . The two sides disagree on the nature of the elections , on the extent and timing of an Israeli troop redeployment out of Palestinian population centers before the elections are held , and on security arrangements in the West_Bank . Rabin said that negotiating teams from the two sides will meet Nov . 21 to discuss all those issues . Previously , he had insisted that the issues be discussed and finalized one at a time , a policy Palestinian officials said was intolerably slowing negotiations . In another gesture to Arafat , Rabin announced that he had agreed to authorize the return of 10 # 000 more workers to their jobs in Israel . Last month , after a bomber killed 22 people -- and himself -- in an attack on a Tel Aviv bus , Rabin banned both Palestinian goods and more_than 60 # 000 Palestinian workers from entering Israel . Israel began to lift that ban a week ago , allowing 8 # 000 workers to re-enter , but Palestinians have been pushing for a full lifting of the restrictions . Rabin also said Tuesday that Gazan merchants will be allowed to sell their goods freely in Israel . It was unclear how that declaration would affect an earlier decision by the Ministry of Agriculture to ban all Gazan fruits and vegetables because of a reported outbreak of cholera in Gaza City . Rabin said Israel will soon make_good on an earlier commitment to build facilities at the Rafah border crossing from Egypt into the Gaza Strip for transporting goods across the border . It was all good news for Arafat , who dubbed the meeting &quot; positive and fruitful , &quot; although Palestinian officials had hoped that Rabin also would announce the release of more Palestinian prisoners . Arafat suffered public humiliation Friday when he was booed out of a mosque in Gaza where a militant Islamic activist -- killed in a car bombing -- was being mourned . &quot; I am desperate , &quot; Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath told the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharanot , in an interview published Tuesday before the summit . &quot; . . . We cannot handle the closure and Rabin ' s loathing of us. &quot; Shaath said that the closure of the Gaza Strip had ruined the Palestinian Authority ' s efforts to attract investors there and was driving Palestinians into the ranks of the opposition . He said Palestinians were also infuriated by Israel ' s plans for economic cooperation with Jordan , with whom Israel has signed a peace_treaty . &quot; I follow all you are planning to do with the Jordanians and I am exploding with despair and anger , &quot; Shaath said . &quot; Rabin is deliberately slow with us and very fast with the Jordanians. &quot; Aides to Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were taking credit Tuesday for Rabin ' s decision to try to ease tensions with Arafat and the Palestinians . &quot; Rabin has finally recovered from the joy of the perfect enemy , &quot; said one aide , referring to Rabin ' s intense personal involvement in negotiating the treaty with Jordan . &quot; He understands that he still has the Palestinian chapter on his hand , and that we won ' t gain anything from the feeling of rejection that the Palestinians have had during the festivities surrounding the peace_treaty with Jordan. &quot; The aide , speaking on condition of anonymity , said Rabin was alarmed by Arafat ' s declining popularity among Palestinians . Opposition to Arafat cuts_across political boundaries , with members of Fatah , the guerrilla group Arafat founded , complaining just as bitterly as Islamic militants about his authoritarian style of governing and his failure to win concessions from Israel .</TEXT>
