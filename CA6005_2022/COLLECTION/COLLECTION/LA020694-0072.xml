   <TEXT> In regard_to EMI Records Group , North_America , in Pop Eye ' s annual record industry roundup ( &quot; Reassessing the Labels After a Record Year , &quot; Jan . 16 ) , there were obvious problems with your understanding of the structure of our company . In April , Charles Koppelman was appointed chairman and chief_executive_officer of the newly formed EMI Records Group , North America.This combined EMI ' s labels and operations from all across North_America ( which include Capitol Records ; ERG -- Chrysalis , SBK and EMI Records ; Blue_Note ; Liberty , and others ) . In your article , you seemed to imply that Koppelman was simply responsible_for ERG and , as such , you didn ' t even mention the label ' s current president , Daniel Glass , who has been in_charge for almost a year . You also included Liberty as a part of Capitol Records when , in fact , it is a free-standing label . The point here is that by overseeing all_of these North_American operations , Koppelman is responsible_for the direction of the entire company -- not just a single label . Whatever successes these various businesses experience ( as well as the &quot; misses &quot; ) he is happy to share credit ( and blame ) with the individual presidents . Given your lack of knowledge of the structure of our company , it is difficult to give credibility to some of your more pointed and acerbic personal remarks . BOB BERNSTEIN Hollywood Bernstein is vice_president , public relations / corporate communications , EMI Records Group , North_America .</TEXT>
