   <HEADLINE> AP SPORTS EDITORS GATHER TO TACKLE DIVERSITY OF PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thirty years ago , editors of the nation ' s sports sections had a simple task : Report the results of professional and college games -- maybe throw_in a little golf or tennis or track_and_field on the side -- and do so in an entertaining fashion . This was done_by white males , and targeted for them . But when 135 members of the Associated Press Sports Editors gather beginning today at the Dana Point Resort for their 21st national convention , the 3 1 / 2-day program will include sessions and workshops on an assault conspiracy case involving women ' s figure skaters ; a sensational double murder case centering_on a revered football hero ; diversifying both staffs and readership ; sexual_harassment in the newsroom , and communicating more effectively with employees . There also will be discussions of writing , reporting and editing , and social functions . But the days when those were the dominant activities at an APSE convention are gone . &quot; Sports sections used to just go_about presenting your typical menu of baseball , basketball and football and a bunch of local names , &quot; said Paul Anger , sports editor of the Miami Herald , first vice_president of APSE and the convention ' s program chairman . &quot; Now there are more sports and issues to cover and an increasingly diverse readership . &quot; There ' s no such thing as a pat formula for producing a sports section anymore . What ' s going_to work in Miami isn ' t going_to work in Kansas City ; what ' s going_to work in Los Angeles might not work in Washington , D.C. &quot; The convention , with The Times Orange County Edition as the primary sponsor , will be making its second Southern California appearance . It was in Santa Monica in 1983 . APSE was formed in the early 1970s by editors who were tired_of the perception that they ran the newspaper ' s &quot; toy department &quot; and were seeking ways to make their sections better and more ethical . The organization has since grown to more_than 550 members . &quot; APSE has increased awareness of ethical standards among sports editors and reporters , &quot; said Dale Bye , the organization ' s outgoing president and sports editor of the Kansas City Star . &quot; It has raised the issues of diversity , both in staff hiring practices and in coverage and readership . &quot; I think it has just raised the standard for sports journalism in general. &quot; But the strides made have been mirrored by an increasingly complicated set of stories to cover ; editors have had to keep running just to stay_in_place . Among this week ' s panels : -- In Pursuit of Tonya Harding : The session will focus_on tactics used by reporters and editors in the wake of an attack on Nancy Kerrigan by men close to her figure_skating rival , Harding . Some steps taken -- such_as a small group of reporters calling_up Harding ' s personal_computer message list at the 1994 Winter_Olympics in Lillehammer , Norway -- have sparked debate within APSE . Mike Moran , director of public information and media relations for the U.S. Olympic Committee , is certain to take_issue with some of the actions taken . -- Two discussions on diversity , one as it relates to hiring and the other to readers . -- A last-minute session , set for Saturday , to discuss the O.J. Simpson murder case and the coverage of it . Panelists will include Leo Wolinsky , Los Angeles Times metro editor , and Steve Bisheff , Orange County Register sports columnist . Jimmy Johnson , outspoken former coach of the two-time Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys , will make Thursday ' s keynote_address . Johnson recently left the Cowboys and will go_to work for the Fox network as an NFL analyst . Friday , the APSE will honor Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Dave Anderson with the Red Smith Award , named after Anderson ' s late colleague at the New York Times . The award , given to an individual who has made major contributions to sports journalism , was first won by Smith in 1981 . Los Angeles Times columnist Jim Murray won the following year . Anderson ' s career has spanned 43 years ; he has been a New York Times columnist since 1971 . Convention sessions will be covered and presented in a daily report by this year ' s members of the Freedom Forum Sports Journalism Institute , an intern program designed to attract students -- particularly minorities and women -- to print sports journalism .</TEXT>
