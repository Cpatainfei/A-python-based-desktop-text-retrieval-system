   <TEXT> Early on , they were drawn to their profession by a love of art , a fascination with the process of transformation , even the aroma of a beauty_salon . Now six Los Angeles makeup artists polish the faces of those oh-so-gorgeous ones who pose for magazines , appear in commercials and decorate the movie screen . Making an actor or model more beautiful is usually easy . But what happens when they ' re challenged with their own less-than-perfect features ? I ' ve always been attracted to the metamorphosis of beauty -- it never ceases to amaze me , &quot; says Tena Bernard , who personally wears very little makeup ( &quot; You get kind of burned out on it &quot; ) . Come a special occasion , however , and Bernard transforms . Her moisturizer is Chanel ' s Oil-Free Skin Recovery Lotion , followed by a yellow-toned concealer -- &quot; a lot of concealers add pink , which looks unnatural &quot; -- then MAC Studio Colour Sheer Foundation applied with a makeup sponge . She adds yellow highlights beneath her eyes and down the center of her nose to enhance the shallow bridge . She prefers Bobbi Brown face_powders because the tones are warm enough for black skin without turning orange . Her eyebrows are thin , so she plucks them only to create a clean line . She applies Prescriptives Eye-shadow Multiples from the yellow-orange line with a fine brush , using a light hand and a brown shade to sculpt rather than paint the brow . She highlights her eyes with a beige shade , then coats her lids with a camel-colored Bobbi Brown shadow . Throughout , she tests the colors repeatedly on the back of her hand . On her hair , she uses a mild relaxer , a reddish-brown rinse and Artec shampoo for color-treated hair . She keeps it short -- &quot; I like tousled hair that looks_like it just fell_into place. &quot; The 31-year-old holds a degree in merchandising from Louisiana State University but prefers makeup to retailing : &quot; I heard an inspirational speech saying that the way to be happy was to find something you enjoy doing and make money at it . For me , makeup was it. &quot;</TEXT>
