   <HEADLINE> TROPICAL STORM RUINS HOLIDAY FOR GULF COAST TOURISTS ; WEATHER : DAMAGE IN FLORIDA IS RELATIVELY LIGHT ; NO DEATHS ARE REPORTED . AS ALBERTO PUSHES INLAND , GEORGIA , ALABAMA BRACE FOR HEAVY RAINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tropical Storm Alberto crashed into what should have been a perfect holiday weekend along the Gulf Coast on Sunday , lashing oceanfront highways with high winds and sand after scattering thousands of tourists to their homes or inland shelters . Ironically , those who abandoned their Fourth_of_July weekend plans and fled the beaches of Florida ' s Panhandle may have only run_into the worst of the weather . Heavy rains of up_to 10 inches , along with a chance of tornadoes and flash-flooding , were forecast overnight for southern Alabama and much of Georgia as the remnants of the first tropical storm of the season pushed northeast . Particularly heavy rainfall was expected later in the week in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains . Among events at risk today was Atlanta ' s Peachtree Road Race , an annual Independence_Day extravaganza that is expected to draw about 50 # 000 runners and thousands more spectators for a 6.2-mile jaunt . Race planners said only lightning would delay the 7:30 a.m. start . Alberto ' s top sustained winds of 60 m.p.h. caused relatively little property damage , and no deaths were reported as the ill-defined eye of the storm made landfall about 10 a.m. Sunday in the Ft . Walton Beach-Destin area of Florida ' s coast . Winds toppled signs , ripped down awnings and left tree_branches strewn on area roads . A five-mile stretch of U.S. 98 , the only road along the barrier islands that front what is a booming northern Florida resort area , was closed for two hours Sunday morning when a seawall began to crumble . The major damage , however , was to the area ' s tourist industry . &quot; We were 100 % filled yesterday , &quot; Kelly Barnes , a reservation agent at the 450-room Ramada Inn , said Sunday afternoon , even as skies were clearing . &quot; But we ' re down to 50 % now. &quot; Joe Farley , general_manager of the Destin Holiday Inn , predicted losses of $ 50 # 000 after guests fled about 100 of his hotel ' s 233 rooms . &quot; Some people are coming_back , and those who were courageous enough to stick it out with us enjoyed the uniqueness of the situation , &quot; he said . &quot; We had no damage , and the biggest problem now is that our beaches are no longer as beautiful as they were . The high_water left seaweed and debris . &quot; But we dodged a bullet . And if we get some sunny weather tomorrow , we ' re going to survive economically. &quot; Added Barnes , a recent arrival from Texas experiencing her first tropical storm : &quot; It was kind of exciting , even though the winds were not as strong as predicted . . . . &quot; In Panama_City , Fla. , damage was reported to the city ' s long oceanfront pier , and power_lines were downed by falling tree limbs . Apalachicola , Fla. , reported a seven-foot rise in the tide within one hour . Although most of Florida saw nothing of Alberto ' s high winds , the entire state was battered throughout Sunday by thunderstorms and rain , much of it the outflow of the storm system . Over land , Alberto ' s power waned quickly and when sustained winds dropped below 39 m.p.h. Sunday afternoon , the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression . Naomi Surgi , a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Miami , said thousands of people along the Gulf Coast obeyed warnings to move away from the beach in_advance of the storm ' s approach . &quot; In some ways , this was a good reminder to people that even though it ' s a holiday , hurricane season has begun , &quot; she said . &quot; People vacationing anywhere on the coastline need to be_well aware of that. &quot; What grew_into the first_named storm of the 1994 hurricane season began as an area of low_pressure spotted south of Cuba on Friday . By Saturday forecasters said the low began to gather strength into a tropical storm -- with minimum winds of 39 m.p.h. -- and quickly headed toward hurricane-strength of 74 m.p.h. as it spun northward over the warm waters of the Gulf_of_Mexico . But while Alberto never reached hurricane strength , its potential , as well as its march toward the popular white-sand beach towns along the Gulf Coast , made_it a serious holiday disruption . Early Sunday , the storm-warning area extended from Gulfport , Miss. , to Cedar Key , Fla. , and hundreds of vacationers were evacuated along that 400-mile target_area . Some went_home Saturday , while other tourists and some local residents without secure housing spent the night in emergency shelters opened in schools and churches . About 1 # 200 people were reported in shelters in Destin alone . While sunny skies are forecast for the Gulf Coast today , rain and thunderstorms may complicate picnics and fireworks displays planned in northern Georgia .
