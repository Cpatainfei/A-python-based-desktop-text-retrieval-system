   <HEADLINE> BLEAK HOUSE ; AS PATIENTS DIED ONE BY ONE , A WASHINGTON D.C. HOME FOR THE MENTALLY RETARDED BECAME ONE OF THE NATION ' S MOST DEADLY INSTITUTIONS . EVENTUALLY , FOREST HAVEN WAS CLOSED , BUT QUESTIONS LINGER ABOUT HOW THE NATION CARES FOR THOSE ENTRUSTED TO ITS PROTECTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During the early morning hours of Aug . 8 , 1989 , two detectives were summoned to the grounds of Forest Haven , Washington , D.C. ' s institution for the mentally_retarded &quot; to investigate the report of a dead body. &quot; At the scene , they discovered the &quot; body of a B / M ( black male ) . . . lying on his right side in his bed in a fetal position . . . . &quot; Their report further related : &quot; He was wearing a hospital gown and white socks with red stripes . . . . There was what appeared to be dried blood on his mouth. &quot; The body was identified as that of Arthur Harris , a severely retarded young_man known to his family and friend as Arkie , who had spent more_than 17 years institutionalized at Forest Haven . Not long before his death , Arkie ' s family had celebrated his 22nd birthday at Forest Haven , 300 acres of wooded , campus-like grounds located outside Washington in suburban Laurel , Md . In one of the 22 cottages , many with pleasant-sounding names like Athelia , Dogwood and Camelia , they ate ice_cream and cake and snapped photographs . But when it came time for them to go_home , Arkie ' s older sister , Brenda , did not want to leave . For reasons she could never explain , she was filled with fear and despair as she said goodby to her brother . &quot; We said we got_to go , but she just stood there , &quot; recalls their mother , Gloria Mae Harris . &quot; So I waited about a half an hour for her , and I went_back in the ward and she ' s laying_in the crib with him . She said , ' Mom , I don ' t want to let Arkie go. ' I said , ' Honey , he ' s OK , nobody ' s going_to hurt him here. ' So she looked_back and she busted out crying and she went right back and held him again . that ' s when I said ' Brenda , come_on , ' ' cause I was trying to be strong for her . But she kept crying and soon we both ended_up crying , and I went_back there and I said , ' He ' s fine. ' She looked_at him and said , ' I love you Arkie. ' And he just took his hand to her face . She said , ' I feel better now. ' &quot; But Arthur Harris would soon become one of at least 10 Forest Haven residents who , during a two-year period , died of complications related to aspiration pneumonia , an infection that can be caused by entry of food into the lungs when patients are fed while they are lying_down instead of sitting_up . Those deaths , says John Dunne , the assistant attorney_general for civil_rights during the Bush_Administration , constitute the deadliest known example of institutional abuse in recent American history . &quot; Based on our various investigations around the country &quot; says Dunne , &quot; there was no other institution of any kind in America where so many people died from abuse and neglect over such a short period of time. &quot; The ultimate death toll at Forest Haven may never be known . The problem dates_back at least 20 years , according to city records and interviews , when the population of the facility averaged more_than 1 # 300 . Yet the Justice_Department and city only began to monitor deaths there between May , 1989 , and March , 1991 , while the institution was in the process of closing and roughly 200 residents remained . &quot; There is nothing to indicate that there was a dissimilar rate prior to that , &quot; says Joseph Tulman , a law professor at the District_of_Columbia School_of_Law who worked_on behalf of Forest Haven residents . &quot; What we discovered in 1991 was only the tip of the iceberg. &quot; Social problems such_as homelessness , street crime and drugs generate headlines , but less public attention has been focused_on the often life-threatening conditions facing people living_in prisons , mental_hospitals , institutions for the mentally_retarded and public nursing_homes . Especially threatened are those left_behind at institutions such_as Forest Haven , forgotten as communities debate whether to maintain such facilities or to close them . Mary Bray , an occupational therapist who has investigated conditions at facilities for the mentally_retarded as an expert for the Justice_Department and advocacy groups , says that Forest Haven is hardly unique and residents all across the country are still in danger of dying of aspiration pneumonia . &quot; Over 200 # 000 people in institutions who are immobile and rely_on others for eating are at risk . Others such_as the mentally_retarded , high-risk infants , children and adults with developmental disabilities are also at risk , &quot; says Bray . &quot; Part of the problem is that the parents and relatives of a good number of these people have long since forgotten them . So there is no one to make_sure they are not neglected or abused. &quot; The Justice_Department and private advocacy groups have sued state_governments in Pennsylvania , Connecticut , Oregon , Tennessee , Oaklahoma and many other states for violating the constitutional rights of mentally_retarded residents of state-run institutions . In a number of cases , lawsuits have charged that residents had died unnecessarily from aspiration pneumonia . Last November , a federal judge ruled that the State of Tennessee had violated the constitutional rights of mentally_retarded residents of a state institution known as the Arlington Developmental Center . Among other things , the judge ruled that it was &quot; virtually conceded by the state of Tennessee that psychiatric and psychological services were virtually nonexistent. &quot; Medical_care , he found , was &quot; below any minimum standard and well below the medical malpractice standard. &quot; A Justice_Department expert in the case estimated that at least 25 residents of the institution had died of aspiration pneumonia , and that many of those deaths could have been prevented . Karen Green McGowan , also a Justice_Department expert witness , says that the extent of the problem across the country has never even been exposed : &quot; Someone dies of aspiration pneumonia and they ( state authorities ) will say they died of heart_failure or respiratory arrest or that they stopped breathing . Everybody who dies has stopped breathing or their heart has stopped . And so the real cause of death is often not identified . What we have here are_quiet little murders . They ' re killed one day at a time because people don ' t pay_attention and then no one finds_out the real cause of death. &quot; Some experts say they believe that the story of Forest Haven is an example of what is to come , as municipal and state budgets become tighter , institutions face overcrowding and understaffing , and the public ' s attention is focused elsewhere . WHEN ARTHUR HARRIS DIED , ONLY A HANDFUL OF FAMILY AND PEOPLE who knew him attended his funeral . The city that had been responsible_for his care during his life concluded it was too expensive to pay_for a tombstone , so his grave is designated only by a numbered metal disk . Arthur Harris ' death was the result of inaction by representatives of the government of the District_of_Columbia , the federal judiciary , the medical_profession , advocacy groups and law_enforcement . The city was warned repeatedly over a 15-year period about the abuse and neglect of patients at Forest Haven , and specifically that aspiration pneumonia was killing them . But despite the warnings and a court_order to improve conditions , the city government did nothing until it was too late . Justice_Department civil_rights attorneys presented evidence eight times over a period of 18 months to federal_district Judge John Pratt , who was enforcing the court_order , that Forest Haven patients were dying because of improper mealtime practices and substandard medical_care . But Pratt did nothing . The medical_profession was also indifferent . One physician , according to city documents , provided substandard care to five Forest Haven residents who died of aspiration pneumonia . Another was allowed by the Maryland medical licensing board to continue practicing at the facility even after it suspended his license and declared that his continual practice_of_medicine would pose a &quot; grave risk and imminent danger to the health , safety and welfare of the citizens of Maryland. &quot; Justice_Department and city documents say he later provided inappropriate care to Forest Haven residents who died . After most of the deaths , the U.S. Park Police , which had jurisdiction because Forest Haven is located on federal park land , were called to investigate . With their daily mission of policing the nation ' s national_parks , they had little experience at probing institutional abuse or medical negligence . And so the cops did nothing . Forest Haven is now closed , its doors shut on Oct . 14 , 1991 . But the story has not ended . Retarded citizens continue to die as a result of abuse and neglect by the city government -- in city-run group homes and in a municipal nursing_home . A multimillion-dollar civil suit alleging wrongful death filed by the families of six Forest Haven residents is scheduled to begin Monday in a District_of_Columbia Superior_Court . And perhaps there will finally be answers to the lingering questions about how so many people over so many years could have died at the institution , and how even though so many powerful people in the community knew what was going_on at Forest Haven , nothing was done to stop the dying . IMPROPER MEALTIME PROCEDURES CAN KILL IN A NUMBER OF WAYS , EX-Mary Bray , the occupational therapist . &quot; There is a valve we all have called the epiglottis , &quot; she says . &quot; The epiglottis opens and closes depending_on whether you ' re breathing or eating . Under normal circumstances , the epiglottis closes_off when you ' re drinking or eating , and it prevents food from going_down in the lung , &quot; which eventually can be fatal . &quot; But if you ' re fed lying_down , or too quickly , or a combination of the two , the epiglottis does not function properly , the consequence of which is food lodging_in your throat or going_down into your lungs , &quot; she says . If food or fluid builds_up in the lungs , the result can be a fatal infection or asphyxiation caused when so_much scar tissue builds_up around the foreign material that the lungs can no longer function . Other times , as the person coughs repeatedly , trying to expel the food , he can choke to death . Improper feeding and lack of movement can also cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal conditions , including one known as volvulus , in which the intestines become so twisted that they may eventually , in the words of one physician , &quot; resemble an entangled telephone cord. &quot; The inability of the intestines to function can , in turn , cause the crowding of other nearby body organs , internal hemorrhaging or asphyxiation if the intestines pressure the diaphragm . Almost all_of the 10 Forest Haven residents who died from complications related to improper feeding died in these ways , according to reports prepared by experts retained by the civil_rights division of the Department_of_Justice and in internal reviews by the District_of_Columbia . Yet aspiration pneumonia need hardly be fatal . Only because the conditions went untreated , the medical reviews concluded , did the residents die . ARTHUR HARRIS WAS 5 YEARS OLD WHEN HE WENT TO LIVE AT FOREST HAVEN in 1973 . For the first years of his life , Arkie had seemed like any other little boy , except that he was developing a bit more slowly . &quot; He was a happy child , always smiling ; it ' s just that he wasn ' t performing like my other children when they were born , &quot; Gloria Harris recalls . But she soon began to notice problems with Arkie , which she reassured herself at first were not serious . When he started to walk and play and tried to keep_up with his two older sisters , his left leg would always drag , slowing the little boy down . And his left arm seemed to be &quot; always in a clench. &quot; When Arkie was 2 , doctors told Harris that her son was mentally_retarded , and she kept him at_home , where he continued to receive medical treatment and therapy . &quot; They prescribed glasses for him because his eyes , the left side would always go nearly in the corner , &quot; says Harris . &quot; They were just cute little glasses . They had very thick lenses . And we used to always mess with them ' cause we ' d have to put them on him . And then he would always with his right_hand take them off. &quot; When Arkie was 5 , a social_worker warned Harris that her son would &quot; have the strength of 20 men &quot; when he was a teen-ager and be impossible to control . And not long after that , Arkie went_to live at Forest Haven , taking only his clothes and a_few stuffed animals , including his favorite , a green alligator . During her first visit to her son , Gloria noticed the alligator was missing . &quot; They said it probably got knocked_on the floor and the cleanup man probably put it in the trash , and I ' ve never seen the alligator since. &quot; Three years later , as a movement toward removing the retarded from institutions swept the nation , the now-defunct Antioch Law_School filed the class-action lawsuit that eventually led to Forest Haven ' s closing . The lawsuit , Evans , et al . vs . Washington , charged that the constitutional rights of residents were violated because they were victims of inhumane treatment . The Justice_Department joined the suit two years later as a co-plaintiff . Betty Evans , mother of Joy Evans , the name plaintiff in Evans . vs . Washington , later provided a sworn affidavit to Judge Pratt . &quot; Dogwood , the cottage where Joy lived , was a veritable snake pit , &quot; she wrote . &quot; I once witnessed a nurse open the cottage door only to find 80 half-clad screaming women come running to the door ; the nurse quickly closed it shut. &quot; She also described the constant physical abuse her daughter had been subjected_to : &quot; The more simple injuries ranged from chipped teeth to scratches , lacerations and bruises all_over her body . . . . On one occasion we found Joy ' s entire back raw. &quot; The Evanses were later to learn the injury was the result of &quot; urine burns from being restrained on a rubber sheet. &quot; On June 14 , 1978 , the plaintiffs and the city agreed to settle the case , signing a consent decree ordering that Forest Haven would be closed and its residents moved to community group homes . In the meantime , they would no longer be subjected_to &quot; acts of physical or psychological abuse &quot; and would receive proper &quot; medical , dental , and health related services. &quot; ( The consent decree came too late for Joy Evans , who had died at Forest Haven , at the age of 18 , in July , 1976. ) Buried in the lengthy court_order was the following promise by the city government : &quot; No class member shall be fed_in a position less than the maximum upright position consistent with his or her capabilities or handicaps. &quot; Contacted 15 years later , Bob Catz , the attorney who initiated the Evans vs . Washington case and drafted the consent decree , explains : &quot; There were a large_number of people who were dropping_dead like flies . What was happening was that way back then they were dying from being fed lying_down , which caused them to eventually choke on their food . It was common knowledge . So we put the language in to require them to be fed sitting up. &quot; Unknown to Catz , however , aspiration pneumonia deaths continued . In July , 1986 , the District_of_Columbia Association of Retarded Citizens , which had been appointed by the court to monitor conditions at Forest Haven , asked an expert in developmental disabilities to submit a proposal for training Forest Haven staff to feed patients properly . The proposal , with a modest budget of $ 24 # 698 , called_for assessing the aspiration risk for each resident and training workers at the facility . But the expert , Karen Green McGowan , says she was told later that the proposal was turned_down when the city said it had no funds for such a program . Without that training , many well-intentioned workers fed residents improperly out of sheer ignorance . &quot; Nobody ever instructed them that it was wrong to feed the residents lying_down , &quot; says Bray , the occupational therapist . &quot; The sad thing is that many of the workers were the only people in the world who cared about many of the clients. &quot; I observed that mix of care and ignorance when I visited the institution in 1990 . A nurse lovingly washed a profoundly retarded boy , holding him in her hands , cleaning him , singing to him . ( &quot; From what you read in the newspapers , you ' d think we ' re all monsters , &quot; she good-naturedly scolded me. ) Later , while I still looked_on , she fed the boy while he was lying_down . But even had there been proper training , a number of workers and medical personnel say that staffing levels at Forest Haven were so low that it still would have been all but impossible to feed residents in a responsible way . When she visited her son at mealtime , Gloria Harris wondered why the staff did not sit_up Arkie in his bed but spoon-fed him bits of food while he was lying_down . At home , she had taken_care to prop him up with pillows . But she was not one to question the staff procedures , often watching as a single worker attended a roomful of hungry residents . &quot; I knew the nurses had their hands full , &quot; she says . Kathy Senior , a social_worker who volunteered at Forest Haven , recalls that &quot; it would take me 20 to 30 minutes to properly feed one ( resident ) . A lot of workers were required to feed eight or 10 residents in that time . And it ' s made quite clear to them that they ' ll lose their job if they don ' t get all their people fed. &quot; A constant source of wonderment for Harris was why her son was kept_in a crib even as an adult . &quot; But I figured that was the way Forest Haven procedures were. &quot; It was difficult for Brenda to see her brother that way , says Harris . &quot; When Arkie got_to be 11 or 12 , she could not stand to leave him there , and I remember when I took here there , she would n ' t want to leave . . . . She said , ' Somebody gonna hurt my brother. ' I ' d say , ' No . He ' ll be fine. ' And she ' d look_back and she ' d just bust out crying. &quot; On their final visit , Harris recalls , &quot; We brought him half a sheet cake and had his name put_on , put ' Happy Birthday Arkie ' on it . There were a_couple_of children that came_down there . We were having a ball with giving him ice_cream and cake. &quot; Harris knew Arkie was happy that day : Arkie and Brenda blew_out the candles on the cake together . Then Arkie &quot; turned_around and patted Brenda ' s face , like that , &quot; Harris says , imitating her son ' s mannerism , &quot; and that would show he ' s happy. &quot; Later , when Gloria had trouble persuading Brenda to leave , it was only after Arkie once again patted her on the face that she agreed to go . Around the time of that final goodby , early 1989 , the original target date for Forest Haven ' s shutdown had come and gone , with 252 residents remaining . Medical_care and living conditions were so bad that the federal Health_Care Financing Administration had taken the unusual step of cutting_off $ 8 million in Medicaid funding for Forest Haven . The city , which could have continued the funding for months simply by appealing the decision , took no action to recover the money . And now , without this substantial funding , conditions deteriorated . By now the civil_rights case had been turned_over to Joe Tulman . An intense , soft-spoken , bearded man of 40 , Tulman was stunned by reports of inhumane conditions at Forest Haven . Convinced that the residents needed more forceful advocacy , Tulman called the Justice_Department ' s civil_rights division , where attorney Laurie Weinstein , alarmed about the Medicaid cutoff , recommended that the department become re-involved . Among her first actions was to arrange a tour of Forest Haven with Dr. Robert Kugel , an expert on medical_care of the retarded , who concluded in a report that &quot; medical_care and practice at Forest Haven . . . expose residents to unreasonable risks of harm. &quot; Two months later , on May 2 , 1989 , Sheila Dabney , 39 , a profoundly retarded Forest Haven resident , died_suddenly , the first of three deaths over the next few months . Medical_records indicated that the cause of death was related to either aspiration pneumonia or an infected bedsore that had gone untreated for such a long_time that the infection had spread and killed her . John Schneider , a 60-year-old resident , was the next to die , and a city report concluded that &quot; aspiration may have been a factor_in the demise of the patient. &quot; Four days later , on Aug . 8 , 1989 , Arthur Harris died , and the Justice_Department asked Kugel to investigate . He concluded that Arkie had suffered from symptoms related to aspiration pneumonia since 1986 , but no aggressive action had been taken_to correct the problem . Although the city would repeatedly argue before Judge Pratt that nothing was wrong with medical_care at Forest Haven , it had been monitoring care at the facility and had concluded in many instances that treatment was even worse than the Justice_Department was alleging . A city-sponsored peer_review of the medical_care Arkie received noted that he had apparently had many episodes of vomiting in the three months prior to his death . &quot; The vomiting was so severe that ( Harris ) had dehydration , &quot; the report said , and at various times he was admitted to the hospital or Forest Haven ' s infirmary . His medical_records show that between February , 1988 , and August , 1989 , he was sent to D.C. General Hospital at least seven times to be treated for symptoms associated with improper feeding , such_as upper gastrointestinal bleeding , vomiting and aspiration pneumonia . &quot; Vomiting appeared controlled . . . but on June 28 , 1989 . . . there was continued vomiting including a large amount of dark brown material . . . . On July 17 , 1989 , nurses ' notes show ( ashen ) color , bluish lips , rapid pulse . . . . ( This ) suggests shock probably due_to a massive GI ( gastrointestinal ) hemorrhage. &quot; But Kugel , in his report to the Justice_Department , concluded that despite all this , Arkie could have still been saved on the last_day of his life if someone had called 911 and rushed him to a hospital . A police report shows that more_than six hours passed between the time medical personnel believed Harris ' life was in danger and an ambulance arrived . At 6:30 on the morning of Aug . 8 , 1989 , the report related , a nurse checked on Arkie and &quot; noticed that Harris had vomited. &quot; At 8:30 , the same nurse checked once more and Arkie vomited again , an event that did not alarm the nurse , who explained to the detectives &quot; that any time Harris was moved he would vomit. &quot; Arkie was finally examined an hour later by a Forest Haven physician who waited nearly two hours before writing &quot; an order to have Harris taken_to D.C. General Hospital. &quot; The nurse , the report says , contacted a local ambulance service &quot; to arrange transportation &quot; but was told they could not send an ambulance until 3 p.m. At 1 in the afternoon , the nurse again called the ambulance , and asked if &quot; they could not make the transport sooner. &quot; Around that time , the nurse noticed that Arkie was &quot; choking and in some respiratory distress. &quot; She rolled him onto his side then noticed that &quot; vomit ( which ) consisted primarily of blood and mucus . . . gushed from mouth and nose. &quot; CPR was attempted , but proved futile . By the time the ambulance arrived , Arthur Harris was long dead . Gloria Harris only learned about her son ' s death by happenstance , from a relative whose daughter worked_at the facility . Panicked , Harris called the institution , eventually reaching a social_worker . &quot; She said , ' Mrs . Harris , I have bad news for you . I regretfully have to say he passed at 1:35 p.m. , ' &quot; Harris recalls . &quot; My son could have died and nobody told me for months. &quot; After the funeral , the nurse gave Harris Arkie ' s belongings : &quot; There was a new pair of camouflage fatigues and two little stuffed animals . I told her that the clothes were not his , that I had never seen Arkie wear them . And those are not the stuffed animals I gave him . And I said , ' This is all his belongings ? ' ; she told me ' yes. ' And I still have it all_in the same bag and a picture of him they gave him . I just left it in a plastic bag up in my closet. &quot; The city paid_for Arkie ' s burial at the Harmony Memorial Park cemetery in suburban Maryland . There , in the Garden of Eternal Rest , his grave is marked by a small metal disk engraved with four numbers , one in each corner , each signifying a different grave . Arkie ' s number , 174 , in the upper right corner of the disk , indicates that his wooden coffin is buried in the area above and to the right of the marker . Shortly after the burial , the Justice_Department filed a motion with Judge Pratt relating that &quot; Dr. Kugel discovered that the medical_records of all three deceased residents revealed an absence of appropriate medical care. &quot; Armed with such evidence , the attorneys prepared_for a hearing in federal_court , where they would seek a contempt ruling and fines against the city for neglecting to obey the consent decree . They were confident that the dying would finally come_to an end . THE COURT DATE SOON CAME . BUT LAURIE WEINSTEIN , THE JUSTICE_DEPARTMENT civil_rights attorney , hardly had the chance to make her case . Judge Pratt told attorneys for both sides that he had decided to review the_matter in another 120 days , telling them to try to work it out on_their_own . Weinstein rose to object , but the judge was in no mood to listen . &quot; Thank you , Ms . Weinstein , &quot; he said , gesturing that the court session was over . Tulman noticed that Weinstein ' s eyes welled_up with tears as she pleaded with the judge . &quot; Your Honor , may I add something ? &quot; she asked . &quot; I really feel that it is important to do something immediately about the situation currently at Forest Haven . The court monitor and our own expert . . . have found that every day the residents are out there , they are in serious risk of harm . Now you have just given them another 120 days of danger , and I really feel that we have got_to do something better than that , Your Honor. &quot; But Pratt had already made_up his mind : &quot; I appreciate your concern . Thank_you , &quot; he said and recessed the court . Five more Forest Haven residents would die of complications related to aspiration pneumonia before Judge Pratt held his next hearing on Jan . 12 , 1990 . On Oct . 11 , 1989 , Marcia Carter , 31 , died of hypothermia and pneumonia , according to an autopsy report . Despite having been diagnosed with a disorder of the hypothalamus , which regulates body_temperature , and previous hospitalizations for hypothermia , Carter did not receive appropriate medical_care for either condition , a Justice_Department review found . One week later , 22-year-old Joseph Hardy Jr . died_suddenly from complications associated with aspiration pneumonia . Joe Joe , as he was known to his friends and family , was placed in Forest Haven when he was 3 . Joseph Hardy Sr. , a former police_officer who visited his son almost every weekend , recalls that he often complained about the way his son was treated , but he was ignored : &quot; They never moved him too_much out of the position that he was laying_in . His bed_sheets sometimes were filthy , &quot; and he constantly had bedsores . &quot; They were feeding him baby food , &quot; Hardy says . &quot; They would n ' t even give him time to swallow what he had in his mouth . They would be pouring it in him like they were pouring water_down his throat and it would all just come_back out of his mouth and nose. &quot; &quot; From the ( medical ) record , &quot; says Kugel ' s report for the Justice_Department on Joseph Hardy ' s care , &quot; it is clear that this man had repeated episodes of aspiration pneumonia and many episodes of vomiting . He was hospitalized on several occasions because of these problems . . . . Obviously , the staff was aware of the somewhat fragile nature of this patient and the likelihood of acute gastrointestinal disorders. &quot; Kugel concluded that &quot; one is astonished to see how little attention was given to this patient on the night prior to his transfer to the hospital and subsequent death . . . . There is no evidence that any of the physicians stopped by to see him or were asked to see him. &quot; Kugel said his study of the death of Joseph Hardy was incomplete because he was hampered by &quot; the lack of autopsy results. &quot; But the report concluded that his death was &quot; due_to acute bowel obstruction &quot; or &quot; volvulus. &quot; The report concludes : &quot; Joseph Hardy died of inability to breathe because of twisting of the intestines. &quot; After Joe Joe ' s death , the city paid_for his funeral . &quot; It was a very pretty casket he was in , &quot; recalls Hardy . &quot; I ' m not gonna lie to you . They dressed him up real nice. &quot; Blue was Joe Joe ' s favorite color and Joe had asked the chaplain to find him a blue suit for the funeral . And there would be other funeral preparations as well : Because he had never received physical_therapy , &quot; his hands were like someone who had a stroke . Their fingers get real stiff and turn_in , &quot; says Hardy . At the funeral_home , they broke the bones of Joe Joe ' s hands , so they could be straightened , at his side , looking good and proper for viewing at the funeral . On Nov . 9 , 1989 , the Justice_Department told Pratt of the deaths of Carter and Hardy and asked him to more quickly consider their motion to have the city held_in contempt . Pratt declined to move_up the hearing date . There were two more deaths in December . On the 8th , Mary Elizabeth Reeves , 35 , died as the result of having suffered &quot; volvulus of the intestine , &quot; according to an internal city report . Then , on the 17th , Willie Marie Gil , 21 , died of complications related to aspiration pneumonia . At the time of death , she weighed only 28 pounds . And on Jan . 10 , 1990 , 20-year-old Walter Tolson died , also of complications related to aspiration pneumonia . In a report for the Justice_Department , Dr. Renee Wachtel , an expert in the care of the retarded , concluded that poor medical_care was responsible_for all three deaths : &quot; There was no investigation of the role recurrent aspiration might be playing in her respiratory distress , &quot; she wrote regarding Willie Marie Gil . And despite the fact that Walter Tolson was regurgitating an average of 10 times a day just before his death and had &quot; recurrent aspiration and GI bleeding &quot; there was no medical intervention to save him . On Jan . 29 , 1990 , Judge Pratt finally heard arguments about whether to impose sanctions . Dr. Wachtel ' s report , which had been presented to the judge , concluded : &quot; Medical_care and practice at Forest Haven is inadequate . . . ( and ) exposes ( Forest Haven residents ) to unreasonable risks of harm. &quot; But Pratt praised the city , noting that it had reduced the number of residents from 1 # 300 in 1978 to a current level of 232 . &quot; The most significant outplacement they ' ve done is that they ' ve buried five more people since the last meeting , &quot; Weinstein responded . &quot; We don ' t know whether they would have died anyway , &quot; Pratt told Weinstein . &quot; These people . . . are not in the best of health probably , any of them. &quot; The next day , he issued an order concluding that although the district was in &quot; consistent and continuing violation &quot; of his court_orders , he still would not make a final_decision about sanctions until a March 1 , 1990 , hearing . Judge Pratt declined to be interviewed for this story , saying he makes_it a practice not to comment about cases over which he has presided and noting that his ruling and comments from the bench explain his actions . The 83-year-old jurist , who won a Bronze_Star and a Purple_Heart in World_War_II , was appointed to the federal bench in 1968 by Lyndon B . Johnson . His judicial trademark has been to press litigants to settle their differences out of court , an often complex and time-consuming process . At the March 1 hearing , Weinstein argued that Judge Pratt should fine the city each day it refused to properly feed Forest Haven residents and provide appropriate medical_care . Again he ruled against her . And the dying continued . Just a week before , a patient named Michael Pipkin , a city report would later charge , had died after having received deficient medical_care . On April 9 , Judge Pratt issued an order threatening the city with stiff fines if his schedule to close Forest Haven was not met , but he still refused to address the issue of medical_care there . Three months later , the Justice_Department once more petitioned Pratt to impose sanctions , entering into the record a report by Victoria Therriault , a registered nurse , who warned : &quot; Meal times remain a nightmare in terms of aspiration risk . . . . I continue to be horrified at the feeding techniques . . . used by staff . The sound of coughing and choking permeates the area at mealtime. &quot; But again , Pratt rejected the Justice_Department ' s motion . On Nov . 14 , 1990 , a year and three months after its original motion charging the city of Washington with contempt , the Justice_Department took the rare step of petitioning the United States Court of Appeals for a writ_of_mandamus . The little-used legal maneuver asks an appellate_court to compel a federal_district court judge to adjudicate a case or make a ruling when the judge refuses to do so on_his_own . The petition related : &quot; At least eight Forest Haven residents died between May 1989 and January 1990 . . . . Yet the court inexplicably has refused to decide whether sanctions are necessary to force defendants to comply with its orders. &quot; The appeals court denied the writ three months later , saying that not enough time had passed yet for it to take action . But the three-judge panel also commented : &quot; Although we understand that Forest Haven is to be closed by September of 1991 , we are cognizant of the potential risk to residents in the interim . Thus , we are confident that the District Court will act with all due haste . . . . &quot; It took another two months for Pratt to hold a hearing to consider the contempt motion and request for sanctions . In listening to the arguments , Pratt was at a disadvantage because the city was withholding vital evidence it had obtained in its own investigation of Forest Haven . The city had , in August , 1990 , provided Pratt with sworn affidavits from two top city officials denying that there was anything wrong with medical_care at the institution . One of the officials said in the affidavit that &quot; current medical and nursing services &quot; were better than they ever had been before . Mary Tierney , a physician and an official with the city ' s Commission of Public Health , informed Pratt that &quot; overall medical_care and practice at Forest Haven is adequate_to meet the health_care needs of its residents. &quot; Neither official was telling the full story . Indeed , Tierney had overseen an investigation that concluded that a single city doctor working_at Forest Haven had provided substandard care to five of the eight residents who had died in the previous year . Among them was Arthur Harris . The investigation concluded that despite nurse ' s notes since June 28 , 1989 , showing &quot; continued vomiting of blood , decreased blood_pressure and rapid pulse , which suggests massive gastrointestinal bleed , &quot; the doctor never ordered the blood_test that would have revealed the extent of the internal bleeding that eventually killed Harris . A month before Tierney entered her affidavit into evidence , the city had sent a letter of termination to the doctor , telling him they were firing him for &quot; inexcusable neglect of duty. &quot; Federal investigators say that the city never alerted them to the investigation of the doctor , despite a request that the city keep them informed about medical_care at the facility . And so when Weinstein and Tulman appeared in federal_court , they had no knowledge of the findings . Although kept_in the dark , they still argued that the only way to force the city to provide appropriate medical_care was to impose sanctions . But Pratt once more told the lawyers that he did not believe their charges that poor medical_care was killing Forest Haven residents . &quot; You are assuming a nexus between being in Forest Haven and dying , &quot; Pratt admonished Tulman . &quot; There is not necessarily that nexus . In some cases , there may be , but you ' ve got a number of people who are elderly , a number of people who are suffering from serious disabilities , whose life_expectancy is completely different from that of the average member of the population . These people are going_to die quicker and die more often than other people . . . . &quot; Tulman indignantly challenged the judge : &quot; All I ' m saying , your honor , is if they put me in that bed and didn ' t move me every two hours , or if they put you in that bed and didn ' t move you every two hours , we would end_up with a high chance of dying of aspiration pneumonia . It has nothing to do with mental retardation. &quot; But Pratt remained unconvinced : &quot; You will agree that the reason they are there in the first place is because of mental_retardation ? &quot; he asked . Tulman was now beside himself : &quot; There was a case of a twisted intestine in one of the deaths . . . . If you go_out and look_at these folks , Your Honor , many of them have teeth that are gone . Why do they have teeth that are gone ? . . . The reason these people ' s teeth are rotting out is that they ' re regurgitating their food constantly. &quot; Weinstein warned Pratt that in the meantime , others would die : &quot; People are getting sicker and sicker out there . . . . They ' ve got somebody out there now who is bleeding internally . The best they can do about it is say , ' Golly , gee . She ' s bleeding internally. ' . . . This court now has the power to do the things that need to be done . You have the power to keep people from choking ; you have the power to make_sure people get their medical care. &quot; But Pratt closed the hearing by saying he would render a decision about sanctions against the city at some later , unspecified date . On April 21 , 1991 , two weeks after the court hearing , Charisse Marcella Gantt , a 28-year-old resident of Forest Haven , died_suddenly ; the cause of death was once more aspiration pneumonia . ASKED HOW SHE HAD COME up with such a beautiful name for her second child , Charisse Marcella , Sheila Gantt answers without hesitation : &quot; Romantic heart . I was always wanting to go_to Paris . I don ' t know if I will ever go . So my oldest child ' s name is Paris Deseree. &quot; She gave her two youngest girls French-sounding names , too : Charisse Marcella and April Rochelle . While Charisse was home , Gantt worked from 10:30 p.m. until 7 in the morning at the neighborhood post_office : &quot; That way I was home during the day to tend to her . I could still get some sleep during the day and still do for her . You know , feed her and dress her . &quot; She was a strong child . She tore_up her crib . She would shake it . I was beginning to wonder how in the world I was going_to contain her. &quot; Charisse was sent to Forest Haven in 1967 , when she was 5 . &quot; I could no longer lift her every day , &quot; Gantt recalls . &quot; I knew she needed special attention . I thought that ' s what she would get. &quot; Gantt had trouble visiting at first . &quot; I was crying all_the time . So for a while , I just got myself together and accepted the fact that that ' s where she was going_to be . That she would be there and be OK there. &quot; Charisse ' s roommate was another severely retarded girl , Christine . Even though they could barely speak , they still could communicate with each other &quot; making little sounds sometimes , &quot; touching , playing . Charisse , always the mischievous one , came_up with her own version of institutional bumper_cars : &quot; Charisse would fly her wheelchair into Christine ' s . Sometimes she ' d run right into her and she ' d laugh. &quot; Christine could barely talk , but Gantt could see the love between the girls -- &quot; her eyes would be smiling. &quot; When Christine attended Charisse ' s funeral , someone rolled her up_to the open casket to view the body , but she refused to look . Gantt looked_for some expression on Christine ' s face , but all she could see was emptiness . Shortly after Charisse Gantt died , the Justice_Department filed yet another motion seeking a ruling from Pratt , asserting : &quot; On April 21 , 1991 , a 28-year-old resident of Forest Haven , who was otherwise in good_health , died . . . due_to aspiration ( pneumonia and ) the recent death indicates that medical_care deficiencies at Forest Haven continue. &quot; On May 15 , 1991 , Judge Pratt finally responded to the request made almost two years earlier by the Justice_Department . He refused to impose sanctions . ON OCT . 14 , 1991 , FOREST HAVEN closed its doors forever , but the abuses continue for mentally_retarded citizens in the nation ' s capital . To meet Judge Pratt ' s schedule to close Forest Haven in 1991 , at a time when there were still not enough beds in the community homes for all_the residents leaving , the city relocated 21 former Forest Haven residents into a city-run nursing_home called D.C. Village , where conditions are little better than at Forest Haven . Joe Tulman went_into federal_court and expressed fears that the abuses that went_on at Forest Haven would now continue at other facilities , including D.C. Village . The transfer of residents to the nursing_home , he asserted , was a means by which the city could evade the court_order to deinstitutionalize , and in not abiding that order , the city was continuing to place the lives of mentally_retarded wards at risk . On Sept . 5 , 1991 , John Dunne , then the Justice_Department ' s civil_rights chief , wrote to Washington Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly , charging that mentally_retarded individuals had been improperly placed at D.C. Village and that their constitutional rights were being violated because they were forced to live_in life-threatening conditions . Mentally_retarded residents of D.C. Village , Dunne wrote , were inappropriately drugged , physically restrained and were not receiving proper medical_care . Dunne also charged : &quot; Our consultants observed physical restraints . . . routinely fastened backwards , which places residents at the risk of strangulation. &quot; The Justice_Department has since commenced a new investigation to determine whether neglect and substandard medical_care might have contributed to some of the eight deaths of former Forest Haven residents at D.C. Village . At least two deaths were the results of conditions associated with aspiration pneumonia , according to city records . Willie B . Reese , who had been institutionalized at Forest Haven at the age of 3 , died on June 2 , 1992 , at age 26 . Four months later , 24-year-old Donna Cook also died . A union grievance filed by a physician working_at the nursing_home charged that Cook ' s death was the result of negligence , alleging that &quot; due_to a lack of staff to monitor her feeding , she had repeated aspirations and died. &quot; On Aug . 2 , 1992 , the families of Arthur Harris Jr. , Joseph Hardy Jr. , Charisse Gantt , Mary Elizabeth Reeves , Walter Tolson Jr . and , later , Marcia Carter filed suit against the city of Washington , D.C. , for the wrongful deaths of their children . Larry Brown , a spokesman for the city , said he could not discuss the pending lawsuit or other allegations of improper care of the mentally_retarded . But , he said , &quot; We are concerned about the welfare of all_the citizens we serve . It is our practice to provide the best possible. &quot; Joe Tulman had first come_up with the idea of suing the city for wrongful death in 1990 , after one of his many frustrating appearances before Judge Pratt . Tulman knew that juries often award plaintiffs in medical malpractice and wrongful death cases large monetary judgments . The prospect of the city being held liable for millions of dollars , he reasoned , might serve as an incentive to improve conditions at Forest Haven , and also provide some small measure of justice for the families of those who died . But Tulman had a difficult time finding a law_firm willing to take the case . What he had not previously known was that in Washington , D.C. , unlike some_other jurisdictions in the country , damages in wrongful death cases are largely limited to what would be the earning potential for the rest of the life of the person who had died . Since profoundly and severely retarded persons have little , if any , potential to earn money , Tulman was told that even if the city lost , there would very likely be no financial recovery . As one lawyer who had earlier been approached by the family of Marcia Carter to sue the city explained , &quot; I could make as much money suing someone for the wrongful death of your cat as I could from suing the city for the wrongful death of Marcia Carter. &quot; SINCE THE BEGINNING OF my investigation of the deaths at Forest Haven , I had been determined to understand how so many people could have died with nothing done to end the dying . I concluded that although individuals and institutions were responsible_for what happened there , they , in turn , represented the city government , the legal_profession , the medical_profession and law_enforcement . The ultimate , terrible truth is that these institutions reflect the values of the larger community . Perhaps nobody understood this better than Betty Evans . Her daughter , Joy , who died of aspiration pneumonia , was the name plaintiff in Evans vs . Washington , the lawsuit that ultimately closed_down Forest Haven . When the Pratt decree had been signed_in 1978 , Betty Evans declared the court_order a vindication of sorts . But the following year , after finding that little had changed at Forest Haven , she wrote an angry , despairing letter to the editor of the now-defunct Washington Star . Despite the death of her daughter , Betty Evans now said , she only felt &quot; relief that Joy no longer had to endure &quot; the &quot; indifference of the human_race that moves through the streets , parks , houses and churches of the District of Columbia. &quot; An entire community was to blame . From the 18 years of the Evans vs . Washington litigation , in the tens of thousands of pages of records , is a sworn affidavit , prepared_for Judge Pratt , by Miles Santamour , a former special assistant to the President ' s Committee on Mental Retardation , describing a visit he had made to Forest Haven . &quot; Late one evening I visited the residence of a group of older_women , all_of whom were gathered_in a large ' day room , ' idly watching television or working_on some piece of embroidery or knitting . As I circled the group , asking questions and explaining who I was , and why I was there , I began to sense the dominance of a large , matronly woman who had positioned herself on a couch in the center of the room . She watched my every move and as I began to leave , she summoned me back . &quot; So that all could hear , she began a series of questions to which she answered ' yes ' without waiting for me to respond . Are you from downtown ? . . . Are you a big_shot ? . . . Are you here to see how bad we live ? . . . Are you here to make this place better ? . . . Are you going_to get us out of here ? -- at which point she turned_to her assembly and began to laugh uproariously , almost hysterically , along with many of the other residents . My usefulness had been fulfilled , and without responding I left . Their laughter continued as I made my way_out of the room and did not subside for some time . &quot; These women had spent a lifetime observing the_likes_of me evaluating their situation and then disappearing with no meaningful aftereffects upon their lives . One wonders how many times the_likes_of me carried_on similar investigations , how many ' big_shots ' from ' downtown ' had been responsible_for raising the hopes of these individuals , how many times they had waited for such visits to change their lives , and for how many people the changes had never come. &quot; Miles Santamour ' s affidavit was filed with Judge Pratt ' s court in April , 1977 . The following year , Joy Evans was to die . Twelve years later , Arthur Harris , Joseph Hardy and Charisse Gantt would die at Forest Haven . Fourteen years later , the institution finally closed , but the dying has not stopped . Remembering my own first visit to Forest Haven , I realize how little has changed , including the quiet rage .</TEXT>
