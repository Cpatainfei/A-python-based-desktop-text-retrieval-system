   <HEADLINE> STRICT LIMITS SET IN BID TO SAVE SALMON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the western salmon population in steep decline because of the steady degradation of its freshwater habitat , a federal agency on Friday adopted the strictest limits ever on salmon fishing off the West Coast . Hoping to ensure that enough salmon survive to perpetuate the species , the Pacific Fishery Management Council banned salmon fishing off Washington state for the first time and imposed tough limits on commercial and recreational fishing off California and Oregon . The council , which is responsible_for overseeing the West Coast fishing industry , said the chief reason for the decline of salmon is the destruction of spawning grounds -- in some cases hundreds of miles from the ocean . But the agency is powerless to protect salmon except by limiting fishing . &quot; Fishing is not the primary cause of the decline , and ( restricting fishing ) is not the answer to rebuilding , &quot; said Larry Six , executive_director of the council . &quot; The actions we take here are only a small measure and one that by itself will not do the job to restore these stocks. &quot; For consumers , the fishing restrictions will go largely unnoticed , because salmon farming and the salmon catch in other parts of the world will continue to supply California markets . The council ' s decision comes nearly two decades after fishermen and environmentalists began urging protection of salmon ' s inland spawning grounds and predicting that the West Coast ' s multimillion-dollar commercial fishery would be lost if action was not taken . In California , the salmon fishing industry from Morro Bay to Eureka is facing collapse , with many fishermen predicting that they will be unable to make a living from the limited season adopted by the council Friday . Earlier this week , 13 members of California ' s congressional delegation urged President Clinton to provide emergency aid to fishing communities that have been devastated by the decline in salmon . And the National Marine Fisheries Service , which oversees the survival of marine species , is considering whether to list the coho_salmon as endangered , which could lead to changes in water use and logging practices . Each year a dwindling number of salmon are hatched in freshwater streams throughout the West . The young_fish , or fry , swim downstream to the ocean . Several years later , at the end of their lives , the salmon return to spawn in the same streams in which they hatched . In recent years , the Pacific Fishery Management Council has concluded that salmon are jeopardized primarily by human_activities on land : construction of hydroelectric dams , diversion of streams and rivers , logging , ranching , mining , pollution , road_construction and development . Dams have blocked the migration of salmon upstream . Gravel beds where the fish spawn have been smothered in silt . Diversion of water to agriculture and cities has reduced the flow of rivers and caused water temperatures to rise to levels that are lethal to salmon eggs . &quot; You can ' t keep destroying rivers and forests and have salmon , &quot; said Zeke Grader , executive_director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen ' s Assns . &quot; We ' ve been telling them for the past 18 years this was going_to happen . Now it ' s happened. &quot; The only major river system producing enough salmon to provide much of a fishing_season is the Sacramento River , which has been plagued by a dwindling salmon population . One Sacramento River species -- the winter-run chinook_salmon -- is critically endangered , but hatcheries on the river have produced enough salmon to allow a limited harvest this year outside San Francisco Bay and to the south . As a result , recreational fishing will be permitted all season from the Mexican border to Point Arena , 100 miles north of San Francisco . &quot; The Sacramento ' s not at the peak of production by any means , but compared to the disastrous situation we find elsewhere , it ' s about the only bright spot , &quot; Six said . The council ' s action , which is expected to be ratified by Secretary_of_Commerce Ron Brown , for the first time prohibits commercial fishing for coho or silver_salmon anywhere off the West Coast . It also restricts fishing for other types of salmon to a much shorter season to protect fish that are returning to spawn . The restrictions vary along different sections of the coast . Off the northern coast of California , for example , commercial salmon fishing is restricted to August and September . South of San Francisco , such salmon fishing is prohibited during most of June and all_of July -- the heart of the season for some fishermen . State_governments usually model their fishing restrictions for inland waters on the council ' s action . As a result , restrictions on river fishing are likely to match the coastal limits . During Friday ' s hearing , commercial and recreational fishermen appealed for action to save the salmon habitat and to preserve as much of this year ' s salmon season as possible . Cathy Novak , representing fishermen from Morro Bay , said this year ' s restrictions will cut their commercial harvest in half , putting many of the 100 boats harbored there out of business . &quot; It ' s going_to be economic disaster , &quot; she said . At Ft . Bragg ' s Noyo Harbor , fishermen anticipating the restrictions have been selling_off seaworthy boats for as little as $ 1 . &quot; Fishermen are struggling just as surely as the salmon are struggling for survival , &quot; Rep . Dan Hamburg ( D-Ukiah ) told the council .</TEXT>
