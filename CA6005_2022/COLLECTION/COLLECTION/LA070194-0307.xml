   <TEXT> Cargo Flights : An environmental impact report on the potential problems caused by adding two daily jet freight flights at John Wayne Airport has found minimal impact . John Wayne doesn ' t allow cargo flights at present.United Parcel Service and Federal Express have both indicated they would be interested in operating from there , saving their Orange County delivery_trucks from having to drive to the Long_Beach or Ontario airports . Many of their customers love the idea , because it would give them pickup times later than mid-afternoon for overnight shipments . But since John Wayne has limited its number of flights , the fear was that the addition of each cargo flight would result in one less landing slot for a passenger flight . Those potential passengers instead would have to seek flights from other area airports . The study , paid_for by UPS , found that two daily cargo flights would cause no major increase in either noise from the Boeing 757s that would be used , or pollution or traffic tie-ups from airline passengers heading to other airports . Even though the report appears to favor air cargo , it won ' t be until next year that landing slots at the popular airfield could become available .</TEXT>
