   <HEADLINE> MATADORS TO WAIT AND SEE IN SHOOTINGS CASE ; COLLEGE FOOTBALL : LINEMAN BEAUREGARD , ACCUSED OF WOUNDING TWO , MIGHT NOT BE DISCIPLINED , OFFICIAL SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Cal State Northridge administrator said Monday the school might not take action against a football_player charged with attempted murder in the shooting of two outside a San Bernardino bar in August . Jonathan Beauregard , 22 , of San Bernardino , was arrested on Aug . 29 a_few hours after a shooting at the Arrowhead Elks ' bar , authorities said . Beauregard , a senior and two-year starter at offensive right guard for the Matadors , was taken into custody near his mother ' s home_in San Bernardino , police said . The victims were identified as Dunyella Darshell Smith , described by authorities as Beauregard ' s former girlfriend , and Von E . Thompson , a security_guard who was sitting in his truck with Smith at the time of the incident , authorities said . Smith was shot once in the hip as she tried to flee . Thompson was hit once in the arm , and a second shot aimed at his chest was stopped by a bullet-proof vest , authorities said . Beauregard could not be reached for comment Monday . Beauregard has not been suspended from the team . School spokesman Barry Smith said Monday that school administrators had not confirmed with police that Beauregard had been arrested , adding that the incident was still &quot; under administrative review. &quot; Ronald Kopita , vice_president for student affairs , said that it could be a violation of Beauregard ' s civil_rights to take action against him based only on an accusation , not a conviction . &quot; The feeling is still that he ' s been accused and hasn ' t had his day in court , &quot; Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said . Kopita added that there are standards of &quot; expected behavior &quot; for athletes representing the university , and said he expected to discuss the issue with Bob Burt , the Matadors ' head coach . &quot; All the teams have codes_of_behavior and I suspect there will be discussion within the football_team regarding this individual , &quot; Kopita said , never mentioning Beauregard by name . &quot; The team may decide as a group what should take place. &quot; Hiegert said a meeting with Northridge administrators has been scheduled Wednesday to discuss the_matter . If Beauregard chooses to remain on the squad , the school might be forced to decide whether he can stay , Hiegert said , adding : &quot; I don ' t know what we ' d do then. &quot; Burt told the team about the arrest before practice Monday . Most of the players were unaware of the incident , he said , although he described himself as in shock . &quot; The guy has been a stand-up member of the program , &quot; Burt said , his voice cracking . &quot; He ' s done all_the right things . He was a good student and he was well-liked . &quot; This has taken us all back a step . We don ' t know him in this way at all. &quot; Sophomore defensive back James Woods was one of several players who hadn ' t heard the news about Beauregard until Burt held a brief meeting before practice Monday . &quot; It was disbelief , &quot; Woods said . &quot; Coach Burt sat us down and said he and Beau and the family were going_to handle it , and for us to try to move ahead. &quot; Beauregard was originally booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon , but when charges were filed against him on Sept . 2 , they included two special circumstances -- using a handgun and inflicting great bodily injury -- which could add eight years to any prison sentence imposed , said San Bernardino County Deputy District Atty . Denise Trager . Court documents also contained a notation that read , &quot; ex-girlfriend has been victim of ( 2 ) assaults by him in past. &quot; There were no descriptions of either alleged incident . School officials said Beauregard asked_for and was given permission to skip practice Monday &quot; to attend_to personal matters. &quot; Beauregard , senior_class president at San Bernardino ' s Cajon High in 1989-90 , started all four games for the Matadors this season .</TEXT>
