   <HEADLINE> WHEN STRANGERS MOURN , A NATION MOURNS ; ISRAEL : ACTS OF TERRORISM EVOKE TEARS OF BEREAVEMENT AND A SENSE OF PERSONAL LOSS , EVEN WHEN THE VICTIMS ARE UNKNOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every family has its own style of mourning , and its times and reasons . So does each nation . My thoughts can wander around the cities of the world -- Sarajevo , Port-au-Prince , Seoul , to the American parents in Italy whose child was killed in a drive-by_shooting and try to imagine how various groups of people are feeling today . In spite of cultural variations , however , there ' s a certain kind of crying which is common to all mourners : The person in_question cries not because he knows it ' s wise_to express his feelings , nor in the hope of getting_over his feelings , nor because he has learned that weeping elicits sympathy and understanding . The mourner cries without ulterior motive . He knows , perhaps for the first time in his life , that no human_being can help him , can restore what has been lost . What the death of a loved one does is turn the living person ' s eyes automatically to the invisible , unknown realm into which the other one has vanished . You can see this brush of the infinite on the face of anyone in mourning . In Israel , as stipulated by Jewish law , people &quot; sit shiva &quot; the first week after a family member ' s death . They aren ' t expected to make conversation with condolence callers . They don ' t listen to music , permit themselves the pleasure of parties , of bathing , of meat or alcohol . Freed from the normal social conventions , they sit on lowered chairs , such_as couches with the cushions removed , and just let the grief express itself . These customs are designed to unburden the mourner of any sense_of_responsibility to wear a stiff upper lip , to carry_on bravely , to try to be happy in spite of the loss . I paid a condolence visit to the Waxman family . I cannot claim them as friends , though they did once live_in our neighborhood . But when , amid all_the silent people streaming in and out of their living_room , I finally caught sight of Esther Waxman , feet curled beneath her on their cushion-less sofa , her face was startlingly familiar from the newspaper photographs . We all knew her . She was the one who had said of the Hamas kidnapers : &quot; They talk_about the God of us all. &quot; Her husband ' s face was equally familiar . It was he who had asked that people not condemn Yitzhak Rabin for the unsuccessful rescue attempt , and who had said : &quot; A father doesn ' t always say yes to his children . This time God said no , and to human_beings , God ' s reasons are usually not apparent . But we still have faith in the God of mercy and justice. &quot; When I went_out into the day again , it was a sweet , magnificent autumn afternoon . A brush with death can make life itself seem exquisitely precious , and this morning was no exception . The sky was so blue , and on the bus ride home , the breeze_through the window was like a mother ' s cool hand on my face . Opposite me sat a blond , Slavic-looking woman , chin uplifted slightly with self-contained dignity , about 50 . Though her hands were folded placidly in her lap , lips set stoically and face unmoving , after some minutes I noticed tears filling her blue eyes . It occurred to me that perhaps she had just come from the Waxman home , too , and I leaned forward . &quot; Excuse me , &quot; I said , &quot; were you just at the . . . &quot; &quot; Sixteen , &quot; she replied . I looked_around me and suddenly realized that everyone on the bus was utterly silent . They were listening to a news_bulletin blaring_out over the bus radio , the Hebrew too fast for my comprehension . &quot; Sixteen ? &quot; I asked . &quot; Sixteen what ? &quot; &quot; Sixteen died , &quot; she said impassively , as more tears brimmed up in her eyes , then trickled down along her cheeks . &quot; In Tel Aviv , Dizengoff Street . There has been a bomb. &quot; It turned_out to be more_than 16 , of course , and the dying more horrible than any of us on the bus in Jerusalem then knew . At that moment all I wanted was to get home as fast as possible , and have my children safe inside our walls . For all families , like nations , have their own style of fear , hope and self-protection .</TEXT>
