   <HEADLINE> SUDAN TROOPS ROUT SOUTHERN REBELS ; AFRICA : IN STUNNING REVERSAL OF FORTUNES , THREE-PRONGED ARMY ATTACK LEAVES INSURGENTS WITH ONLY ONE TOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In their biggest offensive of this nation ' s decade-old civil_war , government forces have routed southern rebels from several key towns and are driving toward the Ugandan border , Western and Arab diplomats said Friday . The rebels -- made_up of Christians and pagans from the black south -- broke and ran last week from Kajo Kaji , their main supply center . They now control only one town , Nimule , on the White Nile . It too appears in danger of falling to the Arab-led Sudanese army , diplomats said , and if it does , the army could sweep along the Ugandan border and cut rebel supply_lines . The success of the army ' s three-pronged attack , launched from garrisons in the southern towns of Juba , Wau and Malakal , represents a stunning reversal of fortunes for the Sudan People ' s Liberation Army , or SPLA , led by John Garang , who holds a doctorate in agriculture from the University of Iowa . Just three years ago the &quot; outlaws , &quot; as the government calls the SPLA , held virtually all_of southern Sudan . Sudan is a land unofficially divided between an Arabized , Islamic north and an impoverished , undeveloped and drought-stricken African south . Not so_long ago , Garang , a former Sudanese army_officer and member of the Dinka tribe , said his goal was to create a unified Sudan , not a separate state . But in May , 1991 , Garang lost his major patron with the overthrow of the Marxist Ethiopian government , which had offered his 20 # 000-guerrilla army sanctuary , weapons and a communications base . Three months later , two of his chief lieutenants , Riak Machar and Lam Akol , criticizing Garang ' s dictatorial style , split from the SPLA . They set_up a rival faction . And late last year , the Khartoum government -- increasingly under the influence of Islamic fundamentalists -- took_on a dramatically more aggressive posture in the war . For much of last year , the government sat_back and watched rival SPLA groups battle it out among each other . Meanwhile , it began recruiting students and young_men , many religious zealots , from the north for a Popular Defense Force . Eight months ago , the government sent them into battle with the bulk of its 100 # 000-man army . Although publicly the government of Lt . Gen . Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir denies wanting to subjugate the south , it has begun referring to the conflict as a jihad ( holy war ) . The Sudanese civil_war , which raged between 1955 and 1972 and restarted in 1983 , was traditionally a matter of southerners killing southerners , as 85 % of the Sudanese army -- including almost all its junior enlisted men -- are Africans from the south . Now , for the first time , Arab northerners are suffering substantial casualties . Moderates in the government are not displeased at the prospect of keeping young religious fanatics occupied in a war . Better that they be_on the southern front , this reasoning goes , than here at_home , where they could agitate for the creation of an even more radical Islamic society and could eventually pose a threat to Bashir ' s military regime . In Khartoum , where large_numbers of Arab and African Sudanese live together without incident , there has never been a sense of civil conflict . The war is seldom even mentioned in casual conversations , and when the government tried to organize demonstrations last week to celebrate the fall of Kajo Kaji , no more_than a handful of supporters showed_up . Despite the loss of towns it controlled , the SPLA does not appear in danger of collapsing , military analysts said . Garang , who now says he is fighting a secessionist war , can still return to the countryside -- where the conflict began -- and can be effective in hit-and-run attacks , particularly on the government ' s overextended supply_lines . The West has kept its distance from both sides in the civil_war , neither of which has an enviable record as human_rights advocates or effective combatants . When , for example , the SPLA tried to take Juba in May , 1992 , numerous bodies turned_up with slit throats . Among the dead were four Sudanese employees of AID , the U.S._government agency for international development . They were executed by government soldiers , U.S. diplomats said . Peace talks , last held_in May and scheduled again for July in Nairobi , Kenya , have been fruitless .</TEXT>
