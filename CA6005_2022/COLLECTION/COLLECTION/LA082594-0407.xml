   <HEADLINE> A WEEKEND TRIP TO MERRY OLDE ENGLAND ; ENTERTAINMENT : THE RENAISSANCE ARTS FESTIVAL WILL RE-CREATE THE TRAPPINGS OF THE 16TH CENTURY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Allen Hughes works as a sheet-metal mechanic at the Long_Beach Naval Shipyard , but this weekend he will don the trappings of 16th-Century England and help transform downtown ' s Shoreline Park into an Olde English village . The Long_Beach Renaissance Arts Festival is coming_to town , and for two days Hughes and other volunteers will have the chance to become any character they choose -- peasant , nobleman , Gypsy , craftsman , minstrel and others . Many volunteers say they participate in the festival year after year because they love re-creating the history of the era . &quot; It ' s definitely different than the normal grind , &quot; Hughes said . The festival , celebrating its 10th anniversary this year , seeks to re-create a spring celebration during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I , complete with royal feasts , mock battles , parades , folk pageants , traditional games and fortunetellers . Eighty booths , surrounding the Rainbow Lagoon at Shoreline Park , will have enough food and drinks to satisfy the hungriest knight and lady . And dozens of vendors will sell items ranging from swords and daggers to jewelry and handmade garlands . The festival is a fund-raiser for the Traveler ' s Aid Society , a United Way agency that assists the homeless . It relies_on about 600 volunteer performers to add an authentic flavor and interact with customers . Although some pageants are scripted , most of the actors ' work_at the Long_Beach festival is improvisational . The royal court also is composed of volunteer actors . This year ' s royalty will include King James , who ruled Scotland during Elizabeth ' s reign and assumed her throne when she died without an heir in 1603 ; his Queen , Ann of Denmark ; the_Irish Queen and her entourage , and the King of Denmark . King James will be played by Ole Olausson , a Whittier resident who has portrayed royal figures at festivals for 17 years . * Performers pride themselves on making_sure costumes are authentic and that accessories , from drinking_cups to metalwork , could be created from the technology and tools of the Elizabethan era . They often chide festival-goers for wearing &quot; strange bejeweled blindfolds &quot; ( sunglasses , of course ) and athletic shoes that show the person is no doubt dealing with &quot; a shady pirate who doth sail from the Far East. &quot; Hughes , a history buff who collects 16th-Century firearm replicas , will demonstrate his skill with a primitive musket . Ralph Owen , a respiratory therapist at the Long_Beach Veteran ' s Hospital , will be playing tunes on a &quot; sak-but , &quot; one of the first valved brass instruments . Owen , 29 , attended his first festival in 1986 and has returned as an actor since 1988 . &quot; It was exciting to see people dressed_up in costume and speaking in the ( Olde English ) language I ' d never heard before , using ' thees ' and ' thous. ' It really was a whole new_world , &quot; Owen said . Like other performers , Owen spends many summer weekends at festivals across the state , including San Marcos , San Bernardino , Long_Beach and San Luis Obispo . Some festival organizers pay performers , but the sums usually don ' t exceed lunch money . * Renaissance festivals , as they exist today , began in 1963 with the Renaissance Pleasure Faire , which is held_in San Bernardino . In a similar spirit , other nonprofit and fund-raising festivals have been organized during the years . Long_Beach ' s festival , which attracted about 12 # 000 people last year , raises an average of $ 23 # 000 for the homeless each year . The performers speak highly of the community and friendships that develop among people who may have little in common except the bond of a bygone time . &quot; You develop friendships over a series of weekends , and then you go_back to your home life for the rest of the year , &quot; said Kathy Hughes ( her husband is the musketeer ) . &quot; But many longtime friendships are made at the festivals . There ' s an open-mindedness and acceptance that you don ' t find elsewhere. &quot; Transforming oneself into a different character and persona , with names , background and attitudes developed by the performer , is a unique creative outlet , said Natalie Beatie of Gardena , who plays a brewer ' s wife in a group of traveling merchants . &quot; Creating a character allows you the freedom to do things that you would n ' t ordinarily do , &quot; she said . The Long_Beach Renaissance Arts Festival will be Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Rainbow Lagoon , near Pine Avenue and Shoreline Drive . Admission is $ 8 for adults , $ 5 for seniors , $ 2 for children ages 5 through 12 . Children under 5 are free . Information : ( 310 ) 437-0751 .</TEXT>
