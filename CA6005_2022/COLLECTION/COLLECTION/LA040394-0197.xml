   <HEADLINE> BRITISH ERA FADES , CHINA GAINS IN MYANMAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Waiters in starched white shirts and bow_ties still serve afternoon_tea and heaping platters of Yorkshire_pudding at Maymyo ' s Candacraig Hotel , a Tudor mansion of the defunct Bombay &amp; Burma Trading Co . But the_British quit Burma , now Myanmar , in 1948 . These days , clients at the Candacraig are likely to be a new breed of foreign fortune-seeker -- Chinese businessmen exploring overseas markets . Many of the Candacraig ' s Chinese guests show_up for dinner in cowboy_boots , American-made blue_jeans and sunglasses . Some openly carry bottles of fine Scotch_whiskey . On the streets , they ' re easy to spot taking taxi rides in some of the 153 miniature horse-drawn carriages left from colonial times , when British officials used to retreat to mountaintop Maymyo to escape the heat of Mandalay . Mandalay , now Myanmar ' s second-largest city , was linked by rail to the old Burma Road , which followed an ancient trade_route and was the chief supply_line to China during World_War_II . Here in the foothills of the Shan plateau , where the clouds rush to meet blossoming bougainvillea , the Chinese are buying turreted Victorian houses with names like &quot; Polo Villa &quot; and &quot; East Ridge Estate. &quot; And they are investing in local businesses . Some Maymyo residents speak_of darker activities . &quot; The Chinese have definitely replaced the_British as our masters , at least in commerce , &quot; said a Burmese businessman dressed in the traditional &quot; longyi , &quot; the all-purpose wraparound garment worn by both men and women . &quot; The Chinese underworld is laundering its money here , especially in real_estate and gems. &quot; The Chinese presence in Maymyo , longtime residents and foreign diplomats say , is unmistakable testimony to the thriving trade -- both legal and illegal -- between Myanmar and its giant neighbor to the northeast . Legal trade across the border is conservatively estimated at $ 1 billion a year . The boom is part of Myanmar ' s efforts to open its economy after nearly three decades of state-imposed socialism and official isolation from its richer neighbors . Meanwhile , no one here doubts that contraband Burmese timber and opium , which is turned_into high-grade heroin in jungle refineries , are making traders even richer on both sides of the porous 1 # 370-mile border . Myanmar produces more_than 90 % of the heroin in the &quot; Golden Triangle &quot; region , which includes neighboring Thailand and Laos . Myanmar ' s forests hold more_than 70 % of the world ' s teak reserves . In recent years , China has become both a market and a transport route for narcotics and teak . Policing the rugged border through thickly canopied jungle is virtually impossible , despite recent truce agreements between ethnic insurgents , including several opium warlords , and Myanmar ' s hard-line military junta , the State Law and Order Restoration Council . Burmese troops hold only a narrow 37-mile-long corridor of jungle near the Chinese border town of Ruili . Day and night , convoys of overloaded trucks and new cars make their way through Maymyo from the British-built section of the old Burma Road , which snakes across the mountains into China ' s Yunnan Province . Chinese buyers say they are shipping cheap Burmese teak , much of it cut by hill tribes in defiance of government quotas and export restrictions . They also buy gemstones , no longer a state-run monopoly , and locally grown corn . Other Chinese appear to be watching_over the delivery of Japanese cars , four-wheel drives and minibuses that move north on the Burma Road to Yunnan Province . Because most Chinese provinces levy hefty taxes , it is cheaper for Chinese businessmen to smuggle vehicles through Myanmar than to import them legally through Shanghai or Hong Kong . &quot; The tribes , especially the Shans , are willing to trade their culture -- their forests , antiques and crafts -- for the good things in life , &quot; said Mohammed Slim , a merchant and pharmacist of Indian heritage whose family has been in Maymyo for three generations . &quot; The Burmese and Shans want T-shirts , jeans and TVs . And the Chinese have them to sell. &quot; Down the same Burma Road , Myanmar ' s military dictators are importing large_numbers of Chinese-made light-infantry weapons and armored personnel_carriers -- part of a $ 1.4-billion arms deal signed_in 1989 . Last year more_than 300 trucks laden with multiple rocket_launchers , recoilless rifles , mortars and ammunition passed_over a new Chinese-built bridge on the Shweli River . The &quot; gun bridge , &quot; so-called because of the heavy volume of southbound military traffic , links China with the town of Muse and the Burma Road on the Myanmar side of the border , according to Western intelligence sources . Chinese construction crews are reportedly improving the twisting Burma Road between the frontier Myanmar town of Lashio and the China border . Western correspondents are forbidden to travel_to Lashio to see for themselves . But Chinese goods are visibly flooding the markets of Maymyo and Mandalay . For sale are Chinese-made antibiotics and herbal medicines , Michael Jackson T-shirts , bicycles , sports shoes , beer , soft_drinks , soap , toothpaste , televisions , rice cookers and other electronic appliances that are cheaper than locally made products . &quot; We don ' t lack for anything these days , even medicines , &quot; said John Aung Khiang , a retired Burmese army_officer in Mandalay . &quot; If you have the money , you just buy_it straight away . It ' s not like the old days of isolation. &quot; What seems undeniable , according to local Burmese and Western diplomats , is that China has dramatically shifted its strategy from supporting anti-government communist rebels within Myanmar toward greater economic cooperation with the government in Yangon ( Rangoon ) , the capital and largest city . As part of the increase in aid and trade deals , China has promised to build three roads linking Yunnan with Myanmar ' s northernmost state , Kachin . And China is reportedly studying construction of a hydroelectric plant for Kachin state , which includes the World_War_II supply base of Myitkyina . &quot; The Burmese are just surviving , &quot; said a Maymyo shopkeeper . &quot; But the Chinese have won a lot of economic control and haven ' t fired a shot. &quot;</TEXT>
