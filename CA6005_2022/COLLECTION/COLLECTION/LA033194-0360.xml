   <TEXT> Torrance resident Antonio Rizzo , who once made instruments for spacecraft , has turned his talent to making instruments for classical musicians . Rizzo started making violins after he retired from his job as a mechanical and design engineer at TRW six years ago.One of his first customers was classical musician Troy Googins , whose uncle worked with Rizzo at TRW . Googins bought two of Rizzo ' s hand-crafted violins while visiting Torrance from his home_in Japan . Rizzo will hear one of his instruments played when Googins performs in a benefit_concert in Torrance on Friday . Rizzo has made 19 instruments , including cellos and violas , and is building five more . They sell for $ 1 # 000 to $ 8 # 000 . &quot; I had made a classical guitar before retiring , but I am kind of self-taught , &quot; Rizzo said . In recent years his violins have won prizes for tone and clarity from the national Violin Makers ' Assn . based in Tucson . Googins , born in the United States to a Japanese mother and German father , has lived_in Japan for seven years and is a member of the Orchestra Ensemble Kanazawa . On Friday , he will perform in a duo called &quot; Rayon de Soleil. &quot; The other half of Rayon De Soleil is pianist Akiko Inoue , who has played since she was 3 . Inoue studied in Germany and Italy before returning to Japan , where she performs solo recitals and chamber concerts . The program will feature works by Mozart , Beethoven and Prokofiev . The single performance will be at 8 p.m. in the James R . Armstrong Theatre , 3330 Civic Center Drive . Tickets are $ 8 to $ 12 . Information : ( 310 ) 781-7171 . The musicians will donate half of the proceeds from the concert to earthquake victims . MARY GUTHRIE</TEXT>
