   <HEADLINE> GULF WAR SYNDROME MAY BE CONTAGIOUS , SURVEY SHOWS ; HEALTH : RESULTS OF GOVERNMENT STUDY FIND SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF VETERANS ' SPOUSES , CHILDREN EXHIBITING SYMPTOMS OF THE MYSTERIOUS ILLNESSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Preliminary results from a new survey have raised suspicions that the mysterious illnesses that have afflicted more_than 20 # 000 Persian_Gulf_War veterans since their return home may be contagious , Senate sources said Thursday . Responses from the first 400 of a planned 1 # 000 servicemen and women to be polled has found that some of the symptoms , known collectively as Gulf War syndrome , also have affected 78 % of their spouses and 25 % of their children who were born before the 1991 operation , according to an aide to Sen . Donald W . Riegle Jr . ( D-Mich. ) , chairman of the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee , which is conducting the study . Also , of those responding , 65 % of children born after the veterans ' return are suffering chronic health_problems , said the committee official , who declined to be identified . &quot; It could be the result of a virus or bacteria &quot; acquired in the gulf , &quot; or it is possible that some chemical exposure could have depressed their ( the veterans ' ) immune_systems &quot; making_it easier to become infected with an organism and , subsequently , to transmit that organism to a family member , he said . Of the children affected , those born after the war appear to be suffering from chronic infections , including respiratory , yeast , sinus , ear and others , he said . &quot; These children are being born with these infections , &quot; he said , which is puzzling because &quot; they ' re in a sterile environment until and when they are born. &quot; Department_of_Defense officials said they are aware that family members also have become sick but insisted that they have not yet been able to find a scientific link to Gulf War participation . &quot; We are aware of these complaints , &quot; said Col . Doug Hart , a Pentagon spokesman . &quot; We don ' t take them lightly . But at this point we have not been able to establish a scientific link -- we cannot come_to any conclusion that they are , or are not , related. &quot; Bob Howard , a spokesman for the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention , which is working with the Pentagon and the Veterans Affairs Department , said that &quot; we do not have a definitive infectious agent linked to birth_defects or illness in the veterans or their family members , &quot; although the possibility has not been ruled_out . &quot; We don ' t want to make any snap decisions or quick judgments , &quot; Howard added . An estimated 20 # 000 or more of the nearly 700 # 000 troops who served in the Persian_Gulf four years ago have reported numerous ailments , including fatigue , skin_rashes , muscle and joint pain , headaches , memory_loss , shortness of breath and gastrointestinal problems . Their complaints have prompted a series of investigations that thus far have yielded no definitive conclusions . The Banking Committee study -- which is not expected to be completed until the end of the year -- asks both veterans and spouses a series of questions about symptoms that they have experienced or have seen in their offspring . &quot; We even threw_in a_couple_of ' ringers ' ( questions about symptoms that are not among those considered part of the syndrome ) , &quot; the Riegle aide said , and the responses thus far have been consistent , meaning that no one claims to be suffering from ailments that have not been among those previously reported . He said the responses received thus far indicate that spouses and children born before the war are experiencing some -- but not all -- of the symptoms that have afflicted the veterans . &quot; They will have 3 or 4 or 5 of them , whereas the vet may have 18 , &quot; he said . He emphasized that the committee survey is not intended to &quot; be a medical study , &quot; but &quot; to prompt a medical study. &quot; &quot; Unless a preliminary investigation is done , a medical investigation will never be done , &quot; he added . &quot; We want to put some hard numbers in front of the medical_community and say : ' Hey , we ' ve got_to deal with this. ' &quot; Hart said the Pentagon also is conducting a survey of 700 # 000 individuals , half of whom served in the gulf and , for comparison purposes , half of whom did not to &quot; see if there are any statistically significant differences &quot; in their health status . No single substance or organism has been identified as the cause of the health_problems suffered by Desert Storm veterans . But many of the troops were exposed to a variety of potentially toxic chemicals , such_as fumes and smoke from oil_well fires , diesel fumes , toxic paints , pesticides and depleted uranium used in munitions and armor . They were also given three drugs , including one to prevent the effects of chemical_warfare , which many have blamed on their health_problems . The drugs given soldiers included pyridostigmine bromide , a drug to protect against chemical_warfare , which has known gastrointestinal side_effects and which is licensed only for the treatment of myasthenia gravis , a chronic muscle weakness disorder ; an as yet unapproved vaccine to combat botulism , and a licensed vaccine to protect against anthrax . None of the three are being administered to soldiers serving in the current deployment .</TEXT>
