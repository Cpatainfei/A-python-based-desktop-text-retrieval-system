   <HEADLINE> FIRST_LADY IN SPOTLIGHT FOR HER ROLE IN WHITEWATER ; INQUIRY : HER REPUTATION AS A TOP CORPORATE LAWYER SEEMS TO CONFLICT WITH HER PURPORTED NAIVETE ABOUT HIGH_FINANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the White_House struggles to contain the controversy surrounding the First Family ' s involvement in the tangled Whitewater real_estate and banking affair , First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton ' s role has begun to raise as_many questions as her husband ' s . Indeed , the Whitewater matter now seems to be a controversy befitting the Clintons ' modern , two-career political marriage : Just as the First_Lady has played a critical role in major policy decisions on health_care and other issues , she now finds herself a central figure with her husband in this politically threatening affair . It is Hillary Clinton ' s independent career as a top attorney in Little_Rock , Ark. , while her husband served as governor -- and her reputation for being the financial brains of the household -- that have prompted questions about her role in the Whitewater matter . Even friends in Arkansas are wondering why she has not come_forward with a fuller account of what she did and what she knew at the time the events in Arkansas were unfolding . &quot; I don ' t know why she hasn ' t been more open about explaining &quot; her work as a lawyer for the defunct savings and loan at the center of the affair , said Beverly Bassett Schaffer , a former Arkansas state regulator and longtime acquaintance . &quot; I don ' t understand why they ( the Clintons ) were in business with someone like McDougal , &quot; the thrift ' s owner . James B . McDougal , a friend of Clinton ' s , owned Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan and was half-owner with the Clintons in an Ozark Mountain real_estate venture called Whitewater Development Corp . The President and Hillary Clinton have said they were innocent bystanders as McDougal drove his lending_institution into the ground with a binge of bad loans and frittered_away nearly $ 70 # 000 of their assets on the bankrupt Whitewater project . Unresolved , though , is the mystery of how to reconcile this image of naivete in the world of high_finance with Hillary Clinton ' s reputation as a top corporate lawyer and board_member of some of the nation ' s biggest corporations . The question being asked more openly in Washington and Arkansas is : How could Hillary Clinton -- whom one legal journal called one of the 100 most influential lawyers in the United States -- be unaware of gross mismanagement at a savings institution she represented as an attorney and neglect her family ' s only substantial financial asset ? Those questions intertwine with a web of others as federal investigators continue their inquiry . Specifically , they are trying to determine whether , amid the careening disorder in the runaway S &amp; L and Whitewater , money from a federally guaranteed thrift was diverted into Clinton ' s 1984 campaign coffers . Also , there is the_matter of whether the institution got favorable treatment from Arkansas authorities that helped keep it in business before federal regulators finally shut it down in 1989 . It is Hillary Clinton ' s role as a former attorney for the savings and loan that has raised concerns about her actions . McDougal , who worked with Clinton in Sen . J . William Fulbright ' s office in the 1960s , bought Madison Guaranty in 1982 and soon began using it to make loans to important figures and to finance an assortment of speculations including his 4-year-old Whitewater venture with the Clintons , according to records filed with state regulators . Before long , the S &amp; L was_on dangerous ground , and in 1984 federal regulators warned that they considered its lending practices questionable . The Federal Home_Loan_Bank Board directed the S &amp; L -- along with others in Arkansas -- to raise more capital and put its house in_order . McDougal hit upon a quick way to raise money : selling stock . But that was not normal practice for savings and loans in Arkansas , and the proposal needed approval from the Arkansas Securities Commission . So McDougal had Little_Rock ' s Rose Law_Firm -- and specifically partner Hillary Clinton -- make his case for the stock sale to state regulators . The White_House has acknowledged that Hillary Clinton , then on a $ 2 # 000-a-month retainer with Madison Guaranty , worked_on the proposal in 1985 . But senior presidential adviser Bruce Lindsey said her involvement was minimal and that most of the legal work was done_by a junior associate , Richard N . Massey , then a 28-year-old , first-year lawyer at the firm . Joe Madden , the current commissioner of the Arkansas Securities Department , said there are at least three Rose Law_Firm documents to the commission that refer questions back to either Hillary Clinton or Massey . But he said the case was fairly routine and that a &quot; competent first-year attorney ( as Massey was at the time ) could have been primarily responsible_for doing the research and doing the drafting. &quot; Schaffer , who had just been appointed securities commissioner by then-Gov . Clinton when the case arose , said Massey handled meetings with her staff and that Hillary Clinton was the only senior attorney at the Rose firm with whom she or her staff communicated . Ultimately , Schaffer and her staff decided that the unusual capital-formation plan did not violate Arkansas law and approved it . Because of its growing financial problems , though , the plan was never carried_out by the thrift . Schaffer , now an attorney in private practice in Fayetteville , Ark. , said she did not feel pressured to rule favorably because the governor ' s wife was involved in the case . But she expressed frustration at her old friend ' s seeming hesitation to publicly explain her role as a senior attorney in the case and thereby allow suspicions to grow . Repeatedly , Hillary Clinton has insisted that questions arising from private matters a decade or more ago are not a fit subject for public scrutiny . She has refused to respond to any detailed inquiries , including the central one : whether it was proper to represent a business partner before a state regulatory board run_by a personal friend and appointee of her husband ' s . She has expressed bewilderment that the press and investigators are interested in the aftermath of a money-losing private real_estate investment . Jack Pitney , a political_scientist at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont , said the First_Lady ' s response created a credibility problem . It is difficult , he said , to believe she would ignore a major family investment and overlook a potential conflict_of_interest . &quot; She can ' t just throw her hands in the air and say she doesn ' t understand all this legal stuff . She can ' t claim ignorance of legal details , &quot; he said . &quot; It is not a credible defense . Her involvement is a fix of_her_own making. &quot; Friends and associates said the two images of Hillary Clinton -- meticulous lawyer and absent-minded investor -- are not mutually_exclusive . While she was a keen professional at_work , she had little interest in acquiring wealth or closely monitoring her family ' s finances , according to her defenders . Lindsey , a longtime Arkansas friend of the First Family , said the Clintons got_into the Whitewater deal on the assumption that McDougal would manage the property and the Clintons would simply make payments periodically on loans taken_out to purchase the undeveloped land . &quot; They went_into a real_estate development with a developer with the clear understanding that he would manage the investment and with the clear understanding they would be passive investors , &quot; Lindsey said . &quot; When they were asked to write a check to Citizens Bank of Flippin ( Ark. ) or even to the McDougals when McDougal said there weren ' t sufficient funds from property sales to cover that month ' s mortgage payments , that didn ' t seem unusual. &quot; He said the Clintons were aware that the property appeared to be losing value , but rather than questioning McDougal or seeking detailed financial_statements on the deal , they just wrote it off as &quot; bad business judgment , &quot; Lindsey said . Another family friend ' s assessment is that neither of the Clintons was interested in getting rich ; they concentrated through the 1980s on Clinton ' s political career and his wife ' s policy crusades . &quot; They don ' t know beans about business , &quot; said this Arkansas friend , who asked to remain nameless . According to McDougal , the Clintons early in 1985 expressed interest in Madison Guaranty ' s affairs -- as well as their personal enrichment -- and sought the thrift ' s legal work for the Rose Law_Firm . McDougal said he put Hillary Clinton and the Rose firm on the $ 2 # 000-a-month retainer at then-Gov . Clinton ' s request -- a claim the White_House has denied . In 1988 , when Madison Guaranty clearly was_on the verge of failure and McDougal was suffering personal problems , records show that Hillary Clinton wrote to McDougal to seek power_of_attorney over all Whitewater-related business . She received that power but apparently did not use it until 1992 , when she authorized Rose firm law partner Vincent Foster to work_on Whitewater ' s delinquent tax_returns . In an unrelated case , she took a distinctly active role in a family investment involving much less money . In 1983 , she , Foster and Webster L . Hubbell , another law_firm partner , formed an investment partnership called Mid-life Investors , with each contributing an initial $ 15 # 000 . Roy P . Drew , a stockbroker who helped them set_up the venture , said neither Foster nor Hubbell later expressed much interest in the performance of the partnership but that Hillary Clinton called frequently to ask about her investment , at times phoning him daily with questions and instructions . The partnership eventually foundered , paying annual dividends of between $ 2 and $ 20 from 1986 to 1992 , according to the Clintons ' income_tax_returns . Lindsey , who follows the Clintons ' personal_business closely , said he knew virtually nothing about Mid-life Investors except that it was an insignificant part of the family ' s portfolio . Some of the White_House defensiveness about Whitewater questions over the last three weeks can be attributed to concern for Hillary Clinton ' s potential exposure to political damage . The chief item on the White_House agenda for 1994 is the health_care reform initiative , which the First_Lady has headed . White_House aides -- and ultimately the Clintons -- concluded this week that until questions are resolved about the First Family ' s business matters , little progress can be made on affairs of state , officials said . &quot; There ain ' t going_to be no health_care campaign if they don ' t get Whitewater out of the way , &quot; said Betsey Wright , Clinton ' s former gubernatorial chief_of_staff and an informal adviser .
