   <TEXT> Miltos Louisides was taking an 8 a.m. shower in his plush room at the Grand Hotel Europe when someone began knocking insistently at the door . Dripping wet , the_British businessman opened it to see a bald man of about 40 in the hallway , an idiotic smile on his face and a Snickers bar in his outstretched hand . Baffled , Louisides accepted the candy and closed the door , but apparently it didn ' t lock . He returned to the bathroom to towel off and stepped_out a minute later to find his black briefcase gone . Inside were $ 15 # 000 , 6 million rubles , plane_tickets , credit_cards and contracts for his company ' s cotton deals in Central Asia . Louisides called hotel security to ask them to seal the exits . But too late ; the man was gone . &quot; I was stupid , &quot; Louisides said . &quot; I should never have opened the door. &quot; He was also lucky . Not only did his briefcase turn_up in a hotel lobby across town , wiped clean of fingerprints and minus everything but the plane_tickets and contracts , but he was also unhurt . As crime rises across Russia , foreigners are becoming the special targets of thieves and extortionists who are_better armed , better organized and more violent than ever . According to the Interior Ministry , there were 8 # 304 crimes against foreigners last year , about 70 % more_than in 1992 . Most of the crime is concentrated where the foreigners are -- in Moscow and St . Petersburg -- and police in the two cities say some gangs specialize in preying on innocents abroad . Foreigners are easy and obvious targets , identifiable by the restaurants they frequent , the cars they drive , even by such details as eyeglasses or book_bags . And in a country where the average monthly wage is about $ 80 , they are fabulously wealthy . &quot; In the past , the local belief was that the Mafia restricted their activities to Russians , keeping their hands off the foreign business_community , &quot; said a recent report by the U.S. Consulate in St . Petersburg , using Mafia to describe local gangsters . &quot; If that situation was ever true , it certainly is no longer the case in St . Petersburg. &quot; Fifteen American employees at the consulate , more_than half the staff , have been crime victims in the past six months . One was mugged by a band of street_urchins in a populous area where no one came_to his aid . Another was beaten and robbed by a cab driver . Foreign businesses are routinely approached by racketeers demanding protection money , and about one in five pays_up , according to Col . Sergei F . Sidorenko of the St . Petersburg police organized crime division . Attacks on foreigners in St . Petersburg , Russia ' s second city , are so alarming that the consuls general of the United States , Germany , Finland , Britain and Sweden complained about them in a letter to Mayor Anatoly A . Sobchak last month . Sobchak has written Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin asking_for special crime-fighting powers , including the ability to mobilize army paratroopers based near the city . Soldiers could be used to strengthen patrols , Sobchak said , especially at night -- when , according to the U.S. Consulate report , foreigners are in special danger . &quot; Never , never , venture out at night alone , go_to a club and then expect to find a reputable taxi driver , &quot; the report warns . &quot; Virtually guaranteed : You will be robbed . . . . Americans , who may have been observed drinking and dancing earlier in the evening , have been followed home and then robbed , beaten and murdered in their own apartments. &quot; The report also warns foreigners on the Moscow-St . Petersburg overnight tourist train to secure the doors to their sleeping berths with electrical wire to keep_out intruders who routinely break_in and spray an odorless gas to drug passengers into deeper sleep before robbing them . Crime against foreigners may well be worse in Moscow , which is twice the size of St . Petersburg , and is not unusual in other cities . Last October , 34-year-old Lauren Binklin , a Canadian who worked for a children ' s charity in Moscow , was tricked into opening her apartment door by a woman she had befriended a_few days earlier . The visitor was accompanied by two men , and police said they killed Binklin for a tape_recorder , camera and $ 100 in cash . The Russian woman was tracked_down and charged with the crime . But St . Petersburg has gained special notoriety in recent months . The year began with a New Year ' s Eve explosion at a shoe_store partly owned by Italians that blew boots , pumps and spike_heels across Stone Island Prospekt . Local TV_showed citizens combing the avenue with charred and twisted shoes in_hand , searching for matching pairs . A few weeks later , a fender-bender involving members of two rival Russian gangs set_off a shootout that left 10 people dead . The winning gang blithely trucked the corpses in the loser ' s van to a wooded area , doused them with gasoline and set them afire . In February , police pulled over a small Zhiguli -- a boxy , Russian car -- towing a black Mercedes limousine through early morning streets . Seven corpses wrapped in canvas were packed in the Mercedes . Police later arrested six Russian businessmen , who said the corpses were bodies of racketeers who had demanded $ 65 # 000 in protection money from their company . Many crimes go unreported , as foreigners and Russians alike view police as corrupt and incompetent . Many are indeed . GAI , the Russian highway patrol , is notorious for pulling over cars with foreign plates to assess whopping fines for imaginary violations . Motorists who refuse to pay are threatened with blood alcohol tests with dirty needles , the U.S Consulate said . Last summer , five policemen attacked a U.S. Consulate employee in St . Petersburg with fists and truncheons . The American , who had been drinking , said he was beaten after being handcuffed by police_officers , who shouted at him that the United States had killed Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan . Maj . Gen . Arkady G . Kramarev , chief of the St . Petersburg police , said many foreign businessmen in need of help avoid the police because they are afraid to defy the mob or fear further scrutiny of_their_own dealings . &quot; I have heard foreign businessmen say that it ' s easier to pay the mob than to pay the tax inspector , &quot; Kramarev said . Yet of 300 Russian and foreign businessmen who turned_to police in 1993 , none suffered any repercussions , Kramarev said . St . Petersburg ' s grim new look is taking a toll on tourism . Vladimir N . Karpenkov , who heads a police team that investigates crimes against foreigners , says the number of tourists each year has fallen fourfold since the late 1980s . Despite the alarming anecdotes , the city ' s murder rate is lower than that of Los Angeles , New York and many other U.S. cities . St . Petersburg reported 875 murders among its 5 million people last year , compared to 1 # 058 among the 3.6 million people of Los Angeles . Police said six of the victims were foreigners : citizens of Germany , the United States , Vietnam , Finland , Latvia and Mongolia . Nearly 17 # 000 people reported being mugged in 1993 , 282 of them foreigners . &quot; You can ' t scare Americans with crime , &quot; Mayor Sobchak says , and many Americans doing business here agree . John and Anna Mahli , developers from La Canada-Flintridge , come frequently to St . Petersburg , looking_for Russian partners to help build prefabricated housing . During the August , 1991 , military coup against Soviet President Mikhail S . Gorbachev , and again during the armed uprising against Yeltsin last October , the Mahlis advised friends in Moscow to come_to St . Petersburg , which was quieter during those violent events . &quot; Americans get a jaundiced version , &quot; said Anna Mahli . &quot; When my neighbors hear that I ' m going_to St . Petersburg , they say , ' Oh , Russia , it ' s so dangerous ! ' And I say : ' Sweetie , I live_in L.A. There ' s nothing there to scare me. ' &quot;</TEXT>
