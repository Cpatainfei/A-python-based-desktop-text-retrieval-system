   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / QUARTERFINALS ; TODAY ' S GAMES AT A GLANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> at Foxboro Stadium Foxboro , Mass . Italy vs . Spain * TIME : 9 a.m. PDT * TV : ABC , Univision * KEY MATCHUPS : Millions around the world will be watching the same thing as the Spaniards -- Roberto Baggio ' s legs . Baggio , No . 10 and wearing the braided ponytail , carries most of Italy ' s hopes . Will he be the daring player who scored twice in the final 35 minutes of an overtime victory over Nigeria in the second round ? Or will he be the disappearing player who has only those two goals in four games despite having taken 15 shots ? With forward Giuseppe Signori benched after missing 14 shots , the entire Italian offense will finally revolve_around Baggio . But Spain ' s Albert Ferrer and Abelardo Fernandez say they will be ready . They are two of the hardest hitting defenders in the tournament . Between them they have committed 20 fouls and have been assessed three yellow cards for bad behavior . They also have manned a unit that has allowed only one goal a game . Assisting them will be two of the best midfielders in the Cup , Juan Antonio Goikoetxea and Miguel Nadal . The Italians will counter with a defense led by AC Milan stars Alessandro Costacurta and Paolo Maldini . The best matchup will be in the style section . The Italians will be pretty , the Spaniards rough . * OUTLOOK : Can this really be happening ? Can the Italians , who have looked terrible in winning only two of their four games , really be headed back toward the final again ? The Spaniards , undefeated in four World Cup games , one a tie with defending champion Germany , believe it is finally their turn for glory . They were nearly perfect against Switzerland and fully expected to be riding that emotion in a quarterfinal game against Nigeria . The last thing they wanted , or expected , to hear at Foxboro Stadium today was the Italian national_anthem , and Italian players talking_about destiny . * OUTCOME : First , a secondary prediction . The winner of this game will play for the championship in the Rose Bowl . Germany , which probably will advance from the other quarterfinal in this bracket , will be no match for the skilled Italians or the determined Spaniards . So which will it be ? For that answer , we ' ll look not at the statistics , but the calendar . The Spaniards have had six days_of_rest , the Italians three . In an emotional game between teams this close , an extra breath might be the difference . That noise you hear around noon today will be the good people of Barcelona , raising their roofs . Spain by a goal . In overtime , of course . BILL PLASCHKE</TEXT>
