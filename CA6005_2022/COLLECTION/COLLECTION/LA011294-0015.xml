   <TEXT> * In response to your editorial , &quot; Tuneup for a Venerable Vehicle &quot; ( Jan . 3 ) , I would suggest a major engine overhaul ! The Endangered Species Act of 1973 , like a lot of well-intended legislation , has some flaws , the primary one being that it undermines a moral_principle upon which our form of American democracy is founded : the protection of private_property . While we flaunt the protection of the golden_eagle and the peregrine_falcon as examples of the act ' s success , we are able to identify the obvious purpose of the act . These species , as well as the spotted owl , reside largely upon government-owned land . There can be little argument regarding public land . But what about land that is not owned by the government ? How many of us envisioned back in 1973 that a private landowner would be denied the right to build his retirement home on his acre of land because the act was being used to protect a rodent , a bird that dwells mostly in Mexico , or even a fly ? You stated , &quot; Landowners with imperiled species on their property have been able to proceed with development while limiting and mitigating the ecological damage caused by construction. &quot; That sounds nice but it sure is poppycock ! Paying $ 4 # 000 to a &quot; rat preserve &quot; for permission to build a home on one acre of land is rubbish . What happened to &quot; just compensation &quot; in the Fifth_Amendment ? What ecological damage is being mitigated to save a subspecies of rat at such enormous costs ? We should not allow the act to be used to prohibit owners of private_property from using their land in what would otherwise be a legal and practical purpose . KENNETH WILLIS Upland * We found your editorial regarding the Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) dismaying , and believe your statement that the act has stopped only 23 of more_than 34 # 000 plans and projects reviewed under ESA between 1987 and 1991 to be intellectually dishonest . Many projects were reviewed and approved under the act , but phenomenal amounts of land and mitigation funds were extracted from private_property owners for the &quot; right &quot; to build_on &quot; their &quot; property ; without a dime of compensation . The government is taking land for our societal goals without paying_for it , and that is theft . While protecting the bald_eagle or even the lyrate bladderpod are noble causes , they don ' t justify institutionalized thievery and tyranny . If species and habitat are that important to society that we prevent someone from fully or partially utilizing his land , then it is our responsibility to compensate him commensurate with the degraded value of his property .
