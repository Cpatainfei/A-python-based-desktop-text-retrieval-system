   <HEADLINE> IRA ' S ADAMS CARRIES A MESSAGE OF PEACE , PLURALISM IN L.A. VISIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Over the years , Irish Republican leader Gerry Adams has been imprisoned , wounded and condemned as a terrorist thug -- considered so dangerous that the United States would not even let him set foot in the country . But most of that seemed forgotten Friday . In Los Angeles for the final stop of a two-week tour of the United States , Adams , the president of Sinn Fein , the_Irish Republican Army ' s political arm , was feted , applauded and photographed . He charmed audiences with his wit and talk_of peace in Northern_Ireland , one of the world ' s long-smoldering trouble spots . He even signed autographs . &quot; We are at a very important and crucial juncture in the history of the people of Ireland , &quot; Adams told a luncheon gathering of the Los Angeles World Affairs Council at the Century Plaza Hotel . &quot; We haven ' t got peace , but we have a momentous opportunity for peace. &quot; Adams ' visit to America -- which included a meeting with State_Department officials -- followed the IRA ' s Aug . 31 declaration of a cease-fire in its quarter-century guerrilla war against British rule_in Northern_Ireland . Soliciting support for the peace initiative and Irish independence , Adams drew parallels between Irish resistance and political struggles around the world , from the American civil_rights movement to the fight against apartheid in South_Africa . He called Ireland the first and last British colony , criticizing British leaders ' insistence on three months of cease-fire before peace negotiations can begin . &quot; Let ' s start talking , &quot; urged Adams , who is barred from visiting Britain and whose image and voice were until recently banned on British television and radio . &quot; If it works in the Middle_East , why not in Ireland ? If it works in South_Africa , why not in Ireland ? Are we Irish so stupid , are we so thick ? &quot; Adams asked to chuckles from his listeners . He repeated the conciliatory remarks he has made elsewhere on his U.S. trip , acknowledging &quot; the hurt which republicans have inflicted &quot; and calling the Protestants , his longtime enemies , &quot; my people. &quot; Sounding American themes of pluralism , he added : &quot; The type of Ireland which we need is one which must reflect all_the diversity of the_Irish people. &quot; At breakfast , Adams , who turned 46 this week , spoke_to hundreds of enthusiastic Irish Americans who sought his autograph and gave him standing ovations . &quot; I have been overwhelmed by the warmth of the welcome , &quot; Adams said of his U.S. reception . &quot; I hope to be back. &quot; Special correspondent Mary Moore contributed to this story .</TEXT>
