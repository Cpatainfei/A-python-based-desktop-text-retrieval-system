   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON RICHARD M . NIXON ; A MAJOR LEADER , A DOUBLE_STANDARD ; NIXON ' S PROFOUND ACHIEVEMENT , FOR WHICH HE SHOULD BE CELEBRATED , WAS BREAKING THE BACK OF THE COLD_WAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The man seemed to me so awkward , even insecure . We did a box-step as he welcomed me into his office and I wondered if he was one of those who felt that a proper distance from others would prevent catching the common_cold . He was friendly enough , speaking about his daughter , whom I knew , and mentioning surfing in California , which neither of us really cared about . Clearly , the preliminary chitchat was not his thing , and so we soon settled into an intense discussion , for almost three hours , about what ails the world . Suddenly , Richard M . Nixon was brilliant and in every way self-assured . That was 1984 , 10 years after he was hounded out of office , but boy , could he hold forth . Pick a spot anywhere on the map , from Beirut to Kansas City , and he knew the players , the issues and the likely result . Even more obvious , if surprising to his critics , was how consistently reasonable and moderate he was . He had been around the block more_than a_few times , and whatever venom might have once been suggested , say in his earliest campaigns , was long gone . Now , of course , there will be no shortage of people to praise Nixon , but I have long had a soft_spot for the man , thinking him attacked more for quirks of personality than for errors of policy . Indeed , the occasion of our visit was an article I had written for The Times suggesting that a revisionist view of the Nixon presidency was overdue . He wrote , thanking me for the article -- which he termed &quot; very objective , &quot; despite the harsh quotes from critics -- and agreed to my request for an interview . I had wanted to talk with him because , in_forced retirement , he had re-emerged as a force for sanity and peace in the midst of a degenerating Cold_War . He had written a book called &quot; The Real Peace , &quot; which defended his policy of detente with the Soviet_Union and urged caution on the Reagan_Administration , which was developing the potentially destabilizing nuclear-shield notion of &quot; Star Wars. &quot; Nixon clearly recognized the danger in this approach . As I reported , the former President &quot; urged the United States and the Soviet_Union to share research on ' Star Wars ' missile systems because otherwise , such defensive systems could fuel fears that they might be used as a ' shield ' for a nuclear first strike. &quot; It did not bother him that this was also the Soviet position at the time . But then again , being soft_on communism was not an easy charge to level against this onetime ally of Sen . Joseph McCarthy . Say what you will , Nixon was also a statesman who knew that in the end there was no recourse but diplomacy , since there was no such thing as winnable nuclear war . You have to recall the nuclear-war-fighting climate of the early 1980s to understand why I wanted to cheer when he said , speaking_of nuclear_warheads , &quot; When you have 10 # 000 of these damn things , there is no defense. &quot; Not everyone , President Reagan included , seemed to grasp that . At the time , Nixon looked good not only to me but to George McGovern , his Democratic opponent in the 1972 campaign who had as much right to hold a grudge as anyone . But McGovern was always a serious person , and as he told me then : &quot; In dealing with the two majorcommunist powers , Nixon probably had a better record then any President since World_War II. &quot; Nixon , added McGovern , &quot; Put us on the course to practical working relationships with both the Russians and Chinese. &quot; Because of the back-channel negotiations , Henry Kissinger is often given the credit for the historic opening to China . But the record is quite clear that the courageous proposal to acknowledge that the true government of China was in Beijing and not Taipei was Nixon ' s . He advanced this course in an article in Foreign Policy magazine in 1967 , before he had ever met the man who would end_up as his top gun on foreign_policy . Little noticed for all_the reporting on the voluminous documents released from the Nixon archives , which overwhelmingly stress indications of personal instability and highlight profanity , is the fact that they prove that Nixon and not Kissinger ran foreign_policy . It was Nixon who decided to be the first U.S. President to visit Jerusalem , and it was Nixon who first treated Arab leaders as more_than caricatures . Nixon was a true visionary along the lines of Woodrow Wilson . But instead of projecting a messianic role for this country , Nixon understood the &quot; limits of power &quot; of the United States in the emerging multipolar world ; he detailed this notion in his &quot; Nixon Doctrine &quot; speech . Still , he made his mistakes . Some , like extending the Vietnam_War to Cambodia , extracted a horrible human price . But it was neither Nixon nor the Republicans who started that war , and it was Nixon who ended it . Watergate revealed a mentality all too willing to sabotage the spirit of democracy , but no more so than Lyndon Johnson ' s persistent lying_about Vietnam or Ronald Reagan ' s stonewalling on Iran-Contra . Every modern President has used the claim of national security to stay in office , democracy be damned . Nixon was subjected_to a double_standard , being judged much more harshly because he was , by virtue of personality , the anti-Teflon President , with every bit of the normal dirty grease of government sticking_to the media perception of his essential soul . Face it : Reporters , including many Republican ones , never liked Nixon . He was inaccessible , quirky , devious and in most of his mannerisms light_years away from the breezy style and the prevalent , if not always genuine , bonhomie of our world . Awkward he may have been , but I believe_in the end he was at_peace with himself . And so should we be in acknowledging one of the major leaders of our time , remembering the bold achievements and putting into perspective his contradictions . Be charitable , not as an act of kindness , but in the interest of accuracy . Nixon had his failings , and we in the media made much of them . But remember that Franklin Delano Roosevelt betrayed European Jewry all_the way to the crematories and that Lyndon Johnson dropped more explosives on Vietnam in immoral spite than were targeted against the Germans in a war that made perfect moral_sense . But they were both important Presidents because of the other things they did , like getting us out of the Depression and acknowledging civil_rights . No less an achievement was Nixon ' s in breaking the back of the Cold_War . We may owe our lives to it .</TEXT>
