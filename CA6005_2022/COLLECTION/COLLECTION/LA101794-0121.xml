   <HEADLINE> ARISTIDE QUICKLY GETS TO WORK RUNNING NATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The flags still waved , the troops remained on the streets and crowds milled_about the Presidential Palace on Sunday , but President Jean-Bertrand Aristide spent his first full day back in Haiti out_of_sight , attending_to the dull routine of governing . According to diplomats , Aristide advisers and Haitian political figures , his first tasks will be to name a new prime_minister and Cabinet and find the money to restore a bureaucracy that had become the personal servant of the military over the last three years . Aristide , who was accused of indecision and even sloth during the seven months he ruled before the Sept . 30 , 1991 , coup that sent him into exile , immediately went_to work Saturday after an official luncheon , talking to political and parliamentary leaders well into the night and again Sunday . Aristide told reporters on his Saturday flight from Washington to Port-au-Prince that he had selected a prime_minister but had not decided when to announce the nomination . First , he indicated , he wanted to point Haiti toward reconciliation and peace in_order to convince the nation that his focus will not be the past and vengeance . &quot; Nice words , &quot; said Franz Voltaire , an aide to caretaker Prime_Minister Robert Malval , &quot; and obviously the guiding principle of the government , but what he is doing now is looking_at the hard work of translating words into action. &quot; The prime_minister is a key figure in Haiti , actually more powerful on a day-to-day basis than the president , since he and his Cabinet set and administer policy . If Aristide has selected someone from an original pool of six candidates , he has kept it a close secret , although many sources think it will be Smart Michele , a wealthy businessman who has maintained links with the generally anti-Aristide industrial sector while strongly backing the president . * The other key Cabinet nominations that diplomats say must come quickly are the ministries of finance and planning and the president of the Central_Bank . &quot; If Aristide expects to get a quick infusion of money , then he has to name a financial team this week , &quot; said a U.N. financial expert . Most sources think the finance_minister will be Leslie Delatour , a free-market advocate who has designed a long-range economic program approved by Aristide and the international lending agencies . The planning minister probably will be Voltaire ' s brother Leslie , an economic adviser to Aristide , while the Central_Bank could be headed by Marie-Michele Rey , a veteran banker who was finance_minister in Aristide ' s original government . Those selections would be accepted , even welcomed , by most of the business_community , including those who approved if not actively backed the coup because of Aristide ' s alleged leftist political views . One possible ministerial candidate who draws shudders of fear from businessmen , but also from diplomats and some moderate pro-Aristide Haitians , is Rene Preval , Aristide ' s original prime_minister and current political adviser . While Preval , a baker whose leftist views and vengeful politics led to a parliamentary conflict that finally led to the coup , was in the original list for prime_minister , Aristide is said to have found a less controversial job for him . Preval told reporters Sunday that he &quot; will be in the government , &quot; a prospect that led one Haitian political consultant to Aristide to say : &quot; Preval ? Even if he is minister of sewage , that would be a disaster. &quot; While Aristide virtually has to start from the beginning and concentrate_on the essentials in forming a government and creating policy for a country left stripped bare economically by the military and its civilian henchmen , there are some emotional and philosophical issues he must settle soon . Among the most explosive are the related questions of amnesty , an investigation into the military rule and establishment of a new judicial_system . Peter Schey , a Los Angeles human_rights attorney who advises Aristide on legal matters , says the questions about amnesty concern how broad it should be and for what period . Schey and other American advisers &quot; are adamantly opposed to a blanket amnesty , &quot; he said , &quot; particularly for crimes against humanity . That sends the wrong message , &quot; Schey said . Predictions are that Aristide will issue a narrow amnesty covering the period from the coup to his return . A larger argument has developed over a &quot; truth commission , &quot; an investigatory body that would probe human_rights violations . Some Aristide advisers want the inquiry to be conducted by a government commission composed only of Haitians and to deal only with the coup and its aftermath . Others prefer an international committee , probably organized by the United Nations and the Organization of American_States , made_up of foreigners . Its time frame would reach back to 1986 and the fall of Jean-Claude Duvalier and finish with Aristide ' s return , thereby including Aristide ' s original seven months in office . William O ' Neil , another American human_rights adviser to Aristide , said the decisions on amnesty and the truth commission would probably be delayed for a month or two &quot; because the president wants to move cautiously. &quot; In addition , O ' Neil said , having an investigation now would be pointless since there are no functioning courts or judges . &quot; It will take at least a year before there will be any court system that could handle human_rights cases , &quot; he said . There was some slight indication Sunday that Aristide might move more quickly against military_officers for human_rights violations ; an aide said some army and police personnel identified as those engaged in torture and murder might be arrested this week . * In spite of the expectations of many Haitians and journalists who drove from church to church hoping to pray with him , Aristide did not leave the Presidential Palace where he spent the night to attend Mass , attending services instead in a small chapel inside the building . In fact , he has not left the palace since arriving there in triumph early Saturday afternoon to address the nation and pledge a government of peace and reconciliation . Besides the president ' s need to get_to work , his private home is still being remodeled .</TEXT>
