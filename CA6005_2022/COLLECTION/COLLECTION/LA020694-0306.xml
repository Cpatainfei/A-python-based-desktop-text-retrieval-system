   <HEADLINE> TOWNS PAY THE PRICE WHEN GOVERNMENT VENTURES FAIL ; TECHNOLOGY : LIST OF ABANDONED MEGA-PROJECTS GROWS . FOR PLACES LIKE IUKA , MISS. , THE IMPACT IS PROFOUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The industrial complex 20 miles out_in the piney woods north of Iuka looks_like one of the New Age factories springing_up in the Sun Belt . On one side of the highway , a sprawling gray-and-white administration building sits in the middle of a freshly paved parking_lot with spaces for 500 cars . Across the road , guards in crisp uniforms stand at gates leading to a high-security production area . Painted signs direct visitors and job-seekers to security and personnel_offices still housed in temporary quarters . Landscapers have yet to install shrubbery , and winter has interrupted work_on Route 25 , which is being widened to four lanes between Iuka and the site on Yellow Creek . But the vans that now come and go are moving people out , not in . With work 80 % complete , the government is walking away from this $ 1.5-billion installation because the budget-cutter ' s ax has fallen on NASA ' s plans to build more-powerful booster_rockets for the space shuttle . About 1 # 000 construction workers have been let_go , and a similar number of rocket engineers , secretaries and officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will follow . In Iuka , where residents had looked_for the project to bring prosperity , the disillusionment is profound . On the day Congress killed the project , &quot; this was like a ghost_town , &quot; said Harold Fulton , longtime owner of the local Piggly-Wiggly market . &quot; Everybody just stayed_at home . This was a despondent community. &quot; For Fulton and his wife , Janet -- who had just modernized their store -- and all_the other longtime residents of this community of 3 # 200 people , NASA ' s pullout evoked a strong sense of deja_vu : This was the second time they had experienced a governmental change of heart . Iuka ' s experience is an example of a phenomenon that is occurring across the nation with increasing -- and some say alarming -- frequency : The government launches an ambitious , expensive , high-tech project . Then , in the face of rising costs , technical difficulties or shifts in political currents , it walks away -- leaving billions of wasted taxpayer dollars in its wake . The effects on some of the communities chosen to host such mega-projects can be devastating . With expectations that Iuka would become a boom_town , for instance , state and local taxpayers ponied up for improved schools , hospitals , sewers and roads . But when the NASA project failed , the community wound_up instead facing an additional economic pinch replete with unemployment and rising crime . The increasing inability to see ambitious projects through to completion is worrisome to many . The danger , say analysts in business and government , is that the United States will become unwilling to take_on the challenging , groundbreaking , government-sponsored projects that have been its hallmark for decades . It may be that the day of U.S. mega-projects -- such_as the space shuttle , the superconducting super collider and the Hubble Space Telescope -- is already past and nations must share the risk in great technologies , said Rep . George E . Brown Jr . ( D-Colton ) , chairman of the House Science , Space and Technology Committee . In the future , multibillion-dollar science and engineering endeavors may be carried_out &quot; through international consortia or treaties , &quot; he said . To be sure , Iuka ' s experience is extreme . Only a_few years before the space agency arrived , the Tennessee Valley Authority left Iuka after spending $ 1.2 billion on a nuclear_power plant on the very same site now being vacated by the rocket people . About the same time the TVA dropped the half-finished nuclear plant , work was completed on the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway , which joins the Tennessee_River near the site . That ended jobs for hundreds more workers . To the disappointment of Iuka residents , it quickly became obvious that the waterway -- which forms a shortcut from the Tennessee_River to the Gulf_of_Mexico -- had not attracted the new industry they had dreamed about . Unemployment shot to nearly 30 % , and the area suffered a veritable crime_wave . &quot; All of a sudden Tishamingo County had one of the highest arson rates in the United States , &quot; said Harold Luminek , an insurance_agent in Iuka , &quot; and you couldn ' t keep a Silverado pickup because somebody would steal it right out from under you. &quot; The TVA ' s massive reactor-containment structure still stands amid the empty rocket-fabrication buildings . So does an incomplete cooling_tower , rising like some Mississippi Stonehenge . Altogether , calculates Iuka Mayor David Nichols , the TVA and NASA investment in the 1 # 200-acre site beside the little-used waterway amounts to about $ 2.5 million per acre . For that reason , he and others had a hard_time believing that the nearly finished rocket project would be killed . &quot; We kept thinking that prudent people would eventually prevail in Washington , &quot; Nichols said . &quot; It was hard to imagine even the federal_government wasting that kind of money. &quot; The Iuka experience is particularly notable because the town was left with two government lemons -- three if you count the Army Corps of Engineers ' Tennessee-Tombigbee project . But the projects abandoned here are peanuts compared to other high-tech ventures that have been ditched . On the same day the plug was pulled on the advanced solid-rocket project , Congress also axed the Energy_Department ' s super collider -- upon which $ 2 billion had already been spent . As much as anything , the laboratory near rural Waxahachie , Tex. , was a victim of cost_overruns . The estimated tab had soared from $ 2 billion to $ 11 billion , setting_off alarm_bells in congressional offices all_over Capitol_Hill . By the end of March , fewer than 1 # 000 of the 2 # 250 construction workers , scientists and engineers who were_on the project last fall will be left . By summer there will be only 500 , disposing_of computer equipment , closing_out laboratories and securing the 14 miles of 14-foot-diameter tunnel that had already been excavated for the huge atom_smasher . The Mississippi and Texas projects join a long , old and growing list of technological lemons , false starts and reversals that have cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars since the beginning of the Cold_War . &quot; This is certainly not a new phenomenon , &quot; said Norman R . Augustine , chairman of Martin-Marietta Corp. , &quot; but it is getting worse. &quot; For example : * The Air_Force and the old Atomic Energy Commission invested more_than $ 1 billion in a nuclear airplane project before it was canceled by President John F . Kennedy in 1961 . Pushing for a separate military space_program , the Air_Force put another $ 1.7 billion into its own Manned Orbiting Laboratory before dropping it . Similarly , it dropped plans for a space glider it called Dynasoar . * The Transportation Department spent nearly $ 1 billion on design and development of a supersonic transport plane before the congressional purse snapped shut . * In the 1960s , the National Science Foundation undertook to drill a hole through the Earth ' s outer crust , but called it quits with the estimated cost soaring toward $ 100 million . * After spending $ 3.5 billion , the Energy_Department dumped construction of an Ohio plant where it proposed to use centrifuges to enrich uranium . Plunging uranium prices and new technology overtook the venture when it was but a third completed . The department spent another $ 1.7 billion on its proposed Clinch River Breeder_Reactor -- and an estimated $ 7 billion-plus on breeder technology -- before Congress concluded it was economically unjustified and environmentally hazardous . * In the aftermath of the Middle_East oil embargo and huge increases in oil prices in the 1970s , the government-backed Synfuels Corp . spent several billion dollars on a variety of sophisticated schemes to increase the use of coal . The massively unsuccessful undertaking was killed by the George_Bush Administration as the United States again succumbed to the appeal of cheap imported oil . * Killed by degrees , President Ronald Reagan ' s much ballyhooed and ridiculed &quot; Star Wars &quot; strategic defense initiative soaked_up about $ 30 billion over a decade . Reasons for the waste go_on and on : underestimated costs , overestimated results , unexpected difficulties , poor management , political uncertainty . Too often , said Robert M . White , president of the National Academy of Engineering , fragile and flawed designs emerge when officials faced with shrinking budgets take shortcuts . &quot; The space_station is a good_example . You come_up with a design and it is approved by Congress . Then you find that the money you need is not going_to be available , and you design to fit budget , and then you budget to fit design. &quot; Redesigned three times in 12 years , the space_station so far has cost $ 9 billion . Conceived during the heyday of the Cold_War space race with the Soviet_Union , the station is now expected to cost $ 30 billion to build and operate for a decade . Ironically , it may survive only because Russia is joining the United States , Canada , Japan and the European Space Agency in the effort . Congressional opponents will make their bid to kill the project for good this year , having come within a single House vote_in 1993 . But Sen . Barbara A . Mikulski ( D-Md. ) , who chairs the subcommittee handling NASA appropriations , said the super collider cancellation &quot; served as a wake-up call &quot; for contractors and government officials involved in aerospace projects . After years of debate , the mission of the space_station is coming_into focus and it has public support in spite of its troubled history , she said . Martin-Marietta ' s Augustine blames the space_station dilemma and similar experiences on three fundamental problems : a year-by-year budgeting process that creates delays and rising costs , excessive reviews and investigations &quot; that turn every little problem into a big issue , &quot; and a national &quot; aversion to risk. &quot; &quot; We have reached a point , &quot; he said , &quot; where the objective is to prevent anything from going_wrong , rather than making things go right . The rewards are not for accomplishment , but for avoiding a hearing , a headline or an investigation . We have taken_away much of the incentive for accomplishment. &quot; It is a very different atmosphere from that of 33 years ago , when Kennedy called_for the United States to send men to the moon . Warning of the heavy costs and obstacles in the project , Kennedy asked_for a firm commitment . &quot; If we are able to go only half way , or reduce our sights in the face of difficulty , in my judgment it would be_better not to go at all , &quot; he said . &quot; There is no sense in agreeing , or desiring , that the United States take an affirmative position in outer space unless we are prepared to do the work and bear the burdens to make_it successful . If we are not , we should decide today. &quot; What has been decided these days , Rep . Brown said , is that wherever possible , high-tech projects should be &quot; reduced in size , cost and duration. &quot; Objectives will be attacked in steps rather than leaps . Partners will be sought to share the risk . &quot; This is not a good time for good , long-range policy-making , &quot; he said . &quot; Most members of Congress have no recollection of why we got started on many long-range projects . We have no institutional basis for planning beyond the next two years . It ' s a defect , but it ' s a defect that most democracies have. &quot; Meanwhile , back in Iuka , plans have been announced for Thiokol Corp . to manufacture rocket nozzles at the abandoned NASA complex . About 850 engineers and technicians are to be at_work there within two years . The town ' s residents took the news , announced in December , with understandable skepticism . &quot; If I had to bet my lunch money , &quot; said Luminek , the local insurance_agent , &quot; I would bet that they will be gone_in three to five years. &quot;</TEXT>
