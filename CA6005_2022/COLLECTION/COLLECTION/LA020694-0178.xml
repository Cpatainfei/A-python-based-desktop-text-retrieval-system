   <HEADLINE> RECOVERY OFFERS US CHANCE TO CHANGE WAY WE DO BUSINESS ; WE MUST TURN THE QUAKE INTO AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSFORM BUREAUCRACIES . HOUSING , TRANSIT AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES ARE AREAS THAT CAN USE BOLD CHANGES FOR THE LONG TERM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The destruction brought by the Jan . 17 earthquake was enormous , but I ' m beginning to witness hope amidst the despair . As I ' ve visited the shelters , parks , damaged businesses and hard-hit residential neighborhoods in my district , I ' ve been heartened by the countless ways our city has come_together in this crisis , reconnecting the frayed bonds of community . That heady spirit may ebb as we settle back into our ordinary lives . However , we cannot let the positive energy generated by tens of thousands of Angelenos dissipate without capitalizing on it . As humans , we must learn from tragedy and then do our best to turn it into opportunity . Let us commit ourselves in the coming months to making Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley a model for new ways of doing business . Let ' s get imaginative -- even heretical -- at all levels of government . If we cannot transform rigid bureaucracies and outmoded habits today , when everything is fluid , we ' ll never be able to do so . The quake is forcing us to experiment . Instead of flinching from change , we should cull lessons from the experiment that we can utilize in the coming years . Several opportunities have been thrust upon us : * We must use this period to create a better kind of affordable housing for the Valley . The Valley had an affordable-housing crisis before the earthquake . Now we have tens of thousands of people of all ages , backgrounds and income levels in desperate need of housing . The private sector must fill this need for those who can afford market-rate housing . But the Valley suffers from a disadvantage : Unlike the rest of the city , the Valley does not have an experienced nonprofit housing_development community to deliver housing in the coming months . Now is our opportunity to develop this network , and in the process transform the term &quot; affordable housing &quot; from a negative into a positive . We need to create this grass-roots network of nonprofit housing developers so the Valley can have affordable housing that is attractive , compatible with surrounding areas and seismically sound . If we don ' t respond quickly , I fear that informal solutions people will find -- sleeping on the streets , living_in their cars , renting illegal and unsafe garages -- will create deep structural scars in our society that could prove more expensive to fix than the physical earthquake damage itself . * Commuters have adjusted to riding trains and buses , taking alternate routes , ride-sharing and driving on one-way_streets . Innovative transportation strategies cannot be reserved for the Olympics and for emergencies . When all_of the freeways return , let ' s break gridlock in Los Angeles -- permanently . * Just as I ' ve been proud_of the cooperation among residents , I ' ve also been heartened by the close coordination between city departments during this emergency . But why should it take an earthquake for departments to communicate with one another , for city employees to adopt a can-do attitude , and for the delivery of services to be restructured ? The flexible , streamlined , customer-oriented approach we ' ve seen in recent days must lay the groundwork for a more efficient city government when the emergency ends . These opportunities are just the start . The coming months must be a time when we embrace all opportunity -- to create a more flexible workplace , new venues for educating our children and a different tone of everyday life . Los Angeles should err on the side of being too bold , not too timid . It is_well known that after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake , San Francisco muddled through_with half measures that have left the reconstruction unfinished five years later . We should not repeat their mistake . It may_not be fashionable to say anymore , but I still love L.A. -- despite all that we ' ve been through lately . I ' ve heard it suggested that the earthquake served as a noisy exclamation_point , putting an end to the all-too-long string of tragedies that have struck our city . As we open a new era , let ' s do things right this time .</TEXT>
