   <TEXT> In the first study designed to investigate whether physical activity can reduce the risk of breast_cancer , researchers at USC ' s Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center have found that women of childbearing age who spend more_than four hours a week exercising can cut their risk of the disease by nearly 60 % . The study was limited to women under 40 , who are generally less likely to be afflicted by the disease than older_women . Nonetheless , experts hailed the work as another promising indication that lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of cancer . &quot; A study like this is very encouraging because it does suggest an activity that may readily modify the risk of breast_cancer , and there really are very few , &quot; Dr. Robert Smith , senior director of cancer treatment and prevention for the American Cancer Society , said in an interview Tuesday . &quot; This is an extremely exciting study , &quot; Dr. Susan M . Love , director of the UCLA Breast Center , told the Associated Press . &quot; This is the kind of prevention we need . This is lifestyle changes instead of drugs. &quot; There is currently no proven method for preventing breast_cancer , although researchers are looking_into two possibilities : cutting dietary fat and taking the drug tamoxifen , a controversial step that would be used only for women at high risk . The disease is the leading cause of cancer in women , and is expected to afflict 182 # 000 American women this year . The USC study , published in today ' s Journal of the National Cancer Institute , tracked 1 # 090 women , all age 40 or younger , all white , all residents of Los Angeles County . Half of them had newly diagnosed breast_cancer when USC epidemiologists interviewed them in July , 1983 . The other half served as controls . The researchers collected personal histories from the patients , asking questions about their exercise habits from the time they began menstruating to the year before the study began . They then followed the women for six years . The researchers found that women who engaged in four or more hours of physical activity each week had a 58 % lower breast_cancer risk . Those who spent one to three hours a week exercising cut their risk by 30 % . The results do not come as a surprise to experts in the field . Rather , the research is &quot; a well-conducted study that confirms what probably most of us would have believed , &quot; said Louise Brinton , chief of the environmental studies section of the National Cancer Institute . Previous studies have suggested , although not as strongly as the USC study , that there is a link between physical activity and lower breast_cancer rates . In 1981 , for instance , Harvard researchers reported that female college-age athletes were less likely to develop breast_cancer . Experts theorize that the link exists because exercise modifies a woman ' s menstrual_cycle , often lengthening the cycle or halting ovulation altogether if the woman is extremely active . This lessens the woman ' s exposure to crucial hormones -- estrogen and possibly progesterone -- that are believed to play a role in breast_cancer . Whether the benefits of exercise extend_to older_women , particularly those past menopause , remains unclear . Since obesity is considered a risk factor for breast_cancer in older_women , some experts think exercise would be beneficial to women past menopause , if only to keep them slender . Bernstein is currently conducting additional research among women aged 55 to 64 , and is hoping to answer two questions : whether being physically active during the childbearing years reduces the risk of breast_cancer later in life , and whether exercise would protect women who begin exercising when they are past menopause .</TEXT>
