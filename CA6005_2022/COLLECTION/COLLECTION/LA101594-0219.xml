   <HEADLINE> BASEBALL : FORMER LABOR_SECRETARY HAS A REPUTATION FOR GETTING RESULTS IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Negotiators for major_league baseball_players and owners said Friday that they welcomed the help of former Labor_Secretary William J . Usery as a mediator in the bitter bargaining dispute , though neither side expressed confidence in a swift settlement . The appointment of Usery , former head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and a labor_secretary in the Ford Administration , was announced at the White_House by Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich . The selection marks the most significant effort to date by President Clinton to help settle the bitter strike , which began Aug . 12 and has wiped_out the 1994 playoffs and World_Series . &quot; This is no easy undertaking , but Bill Usery is no ordinary man , &quot; Reich said . &quot; Bill Usery is truly the Mr. October of labor negotiations . . . . Baseball fans across the country want these two sides to reach an agreement . And with the addition of Secretary Usery , we ' ve got a process in place to help make that happen . The rest is up_to the players and the owners. &quot; Negotiations are expected to resume Tuesday in New York , but there was no display of optimism . Acting baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said the sides are willing to join Usery at the table , but he made_it clear that the owners and players have hardly moved from their bargaining positions of two months ago . &quot; We have had some discussions , but they ' ve been very informal and I think that , relative to where we are now as opposed to where we were two months ago , it ' s safe to say that we ' re generally in the same areas , &quot; said Selig , who answered reporters ' questions at the White_House with Usery , Reich and baseball union chief Donald Fehr . &quot; that ' s the very reason we need to come_back in an organized and a structured way and resume conversations. &quot; Said Fehr : &quot; The negotiations need to resume , and we ' ve been working toward that end . . . . I think it ' s safe to say we can use all_the constructive help we can get. &quot; He added , however , that Usery will need time to familiarize himself with the issues , and Usery agreed . &quot; It is a dispute that can ' t be resolved easily , nor quickly , &quot; Usery said . &quot; In fact , what little bit that I do know about the things in the dispute , it will take considerable time and considerable effort. &quot; Two months into the dispute , negotiations between the players and owners remain at an impasse over the owners ' demand for a salary cap , the divisive issue that is now at the heart of labor disputes throughout professional sports . The baseball_players ' union believes the owners eventually plan to implement the cap unilaterally . A proposed curb on player salaries has also led to a management lockout in the NHL that has delayed the start of the season , and players in the NBA are pressing for removal of their league ' s salary cap . A new cap in the NFL has prompted turmoil and sparked deep resentment among players . Reich noted that Usery was brought_in only after the failure of earlier efforts at federal mediation . Reich added that the Administration turned_to Usery after John Calhoun Wells , the current national director of the mediation service , contacted Reich and suggested that &quot; the time was right to appoint a special mediator. &quot; Officials of the mediation service , led by Wells , joined the talks the day after the strike began but were unable to move the sides toward a settlement . Usery may be tailor-made for the job of stepping_in where others have failed . He is known for displaying a stubborn persistence and a willingness to endure marathon bargaining sessions -- sometimes lasting as long as 44 hours -- to close a deal . In the early 1980s , he helped negotiate the first labor_agreement between the United Auto Workers , General Motors and Toyota at the GM-Toyota joint_venture assembly_plant in Fremont , Calif . Last fall , he successfully mediated an end to a six-month coal operators ' strike . And this is not his first foray_into the world of sports labor relations . When football_players struck for 44 days before the 1974 NFL season , Usery ' s mediation helped settle the dispute before the season began . Reich suggested that cancellation of the season might have drained some of the acrimony and tension from the negotiations , enhancing chances for successful mediation , but Usery faces a situation that is complicated by other issues . Management lawyer Chuck O ' Connor said Friday that the owners will decide next week whether to impose a 45-day freeze on contract signings . The union has indicated that it will not agree to the freeze request and would challenge unilateral imposition by the owners with a collusion grievance . The owners have also requested a delay in today ' s scheduled start of free-agent filing until Nov . 30 , but agents contacting the union on Friday were told to begin filing their players today . &quot; We ' re proceeding under the old rules , &quot; agent Alan Meersand said , adding that he will file on behalf of Dodger third_baseman Tim Wallach today . There are about 170 players eligible for free_agency . Those filing can talk to any club but can sign only with their own until Nov . 1 .
