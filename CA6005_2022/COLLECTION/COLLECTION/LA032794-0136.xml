   <HEADLINE> DOING TIME IN TIJUANA ; IN LA MESA PENITENTIARY , PRISONERS LIVE WITH THEIR FAMILIES , RICH INMATES CONTROL THE REAL_ESTATE AND EVERYTHING -- EVEN GUNS AND DRUGS -- HAS A PRICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> THE BOY IS 4 YEARS OLD . WEARING A BLUE SWEAT SHIRT , BAGGY jeans and a look of solitary awe , he wanders through the Sunday afternoon tumult of the La Mesa State Penitentiary , a raucous Tijuana dreamscape . The boy passes taco stands_in the central plaza , a makeshift video arcade and a general_store with a hand-painted 7-Eleven sign . He gets a pat on the head from one of the scruffy tattooed men crouched in a predatory daze around the basketball_court . He stops and peers up at a trio of musicians celebrating the baptism of 32 babies in angelic white regalia , new arrivals behind the walls patrolled by baby-faced guards who wear rifles and jaunty touches -- a scarf , a Raiders jacket -- over their uniforms . The boy ' s world is a daily barrage of wonders : huddled heroin_addicts shooting_up in a corner , point-blank gunfights between pistolero s in cowboy_hats . He mimics what he sees . In the chapel with a Madonna framed by flashing lights , he clasps his hands in prayer . In the gym , he throws furious shadow-punches as boxers pound speed-bags to a clattering funk beat . Asked his name , he responds with one soft word : &quot; Mascara. &quot; His melancholy visage has inspired that moniker , which means &quot; mask. &quot; He has been rechristened by residents of a prison that seethes with the surrealism of the U.S.-Mexico border . He is not visiting . He lives here with his parents . Of the more_than 2 # 500 residents of La Mesa , 300 are wives and children of prisoners . Because many inmates are migrants , the prison evolved to accommodate their impoverished kin . The resulting overpopulation forced authorities to tolerate construction of unofficial dwellings , known as carracas , creating a lucrative real_estate market . More_than 200 carracas and about 60 inmate-owned businesses are crammed into four acres that bear scarce resemblance to the stark confines of U.S. prisons . In many ways , La Mesa is a product of the only land boundary between First and Third_Worlds , a frontier shaped by wayfarers , pioneers and desperadoes . In a 1992 report , the National Human_Rights Commission of Mexico concluded : &quot; It is not exaggerating to state that the prevailing circumstances inside the state penitentiary create a tableau that is unique in the world. &quot; With its strolling families and shack-town skyline dotted by homemade television_antennas , this prison-turned-village in the centrally located La Mesa neighborhood has earned the nickname &quot; El Pueblo de La Mesa. &quot; It has developed its own architecture , economy and laws -- a strange order that governs the seeming anarchy . Creativity and warmth endure alongside corruption and savagery , challenging the stereotype conjured by the words &quot; Mexican jail. &quot; &quot; The government accommodates the people , and the people accommodate the government , &quot; says San Diego Police Sgt . Carlos Chacon , an expert on prison gangs who knows La Mesa well . &quot; The government doesn ' t have a lot of money , so they are forced to work together. &quot; The pragmatic arrangement has produced a class_structure mirroring that of the larger Mexican society . The rich amass luxuries and surround themselves with servants and bodyguards hired from the ranks of the poor , who scrabble to survive . &quot; It doesn ' t look_like it ' s dangerous , &quot; says Mario , a tall , rugged Chicano serving 10 years for marijuana possession . &quot; But there are criminals in here that will kill you for a quina ( about 20 cents ) . You can ' t forget you ' re in a penitentiary . You gotta remember , they got guns in here. &quot; Inmates committed at least 12 murders in the prison in 1993 , using smuggled firearms including Uzis . Although turf wars between inmate mafias pose a potential for disaster , La Mesa has not had the deadly riots experienced by other Mexican , Latin_American and U.S. penitentiaries . The presence of inmates ' relatives defuses some of the tension . &quot; In our society , the family is extremely important , &quot; says warden Jorge Alberto Duarte Castillo . &quot; Through the family , it has been possible to control the situation. &quot; For all its problems , the prison preserves a measure of humanity . &quot; They should take this and apply it in the U.S. , &quot; says Mario , who has done time on both sides of the border . &quot; You got the stores , the wives and the kids . Morale-wise , a guy doesn ' t feel locked_up . In the U.S. , it ' s all steel and concrete . A guy is in with a bunch of men ; there ' s homosexuality , frustration . He comes_out angry and violent . He goes from a black-and-white world to color . And he can ' t handle it. &quot; Like Mexico in_general and Baja California in particular , La Mesa is experiencing a sometimes painful transformation . The federal_government and the administration of Gov . Ernesto Ruffo Appel have spent more_than $ 5 million on new cellblocks and other improvements . Gingerly , Duarte is trying to superimpose a modern institution on the existing one . During his two-year tenure , the 41-year-old law professor has begun programs in which inmates participate in community service , athletic events and musical_performances outside the walls . And he openly acknowledges the nagging existence of guns and drugs . &quot; I think you are making a big step_forward when you speak the truth , &quot; he says . The bearded , deeply religious Duarte retains a gentle demeanor in a job that chews_up wardens regularly . Some critics regard him as well-intentioned , but say he has ceded power to criminal kingpins . Duarte shrugs_off the accusations . &quot; We cannot lose the human aspect . If all we do is toughen the system , it will not work . This is a reality with which I have to live . Gradually , conforming_to the economic_conditions , we can go_about changing the situation. &quot; ANGEL LEANS ON THE RAILING OF HIS BALCONY , SURVEYING HIS DOMAIN . A boombox cranks a San Diego Top 40 station . In good_weather , Angel and his neighbors recline in the sun outside their second-floor carracas . &quot; You don ' t feel the time , &quot; he says . &quot; This is the most luxurious prison in the world . The only problem is , you can ' t leave. &quot; Angel was sentenced to 10 years after federal police busted him at the Tijuana airport with 200 kilos of California-bound cocaine . The bearlike , unshaven 24-year-old is from Mexico_City . He slides breezily between Spanish and English , explaining how he went_about setting himself up in the typical style of the big_shots . &quot; You hire four or five guys to take_care of you , &quot; he says , indicating the grinning young inmates who hover nearby . &quot; Bodyguards . This is my cook . Somebody to watch your house , do the household work . I had two French poodles , and a Rottweiler , too. &quot; The balcony overlooks a grocery stand with three brightly colored parrots in cages , as well as a new , fenced vocational_school ; the prison ' s past confronts its future . Construction of new carracas is banned , but the real-estate_business flourishes . Buyers use brokers and property deeds to avoid rip-offs . A percentage of transactions goes_for prison services , such_as maintenance . Prices range from $ 100 for a tiny enclosed bunk to about $ 25 # 000 for townhouse-type dwellings stocked with cellular_telephones and Jacuzzis . Angel leads a jovial tour : the separate bathroom , living area , kitchen and what he calls the &quot; master ' s bedroom. &quot; He paid the previous owner $ 8 # 000 for the apartment , which suggests a slightly ramshackle college dormitory suite . He has a microwave_oven , refrigerator , compact-disc player , shower , TV / VCR , heater and air conditioner . &quot; It gets hot here in the summer , man. &quot; Unlike some of his neighbors , Angel does not have cable_television . He rents movies from the video club and watches the networks from north of the border . &quot; CBS , NBC , Fox , KPBS , &quot; he says . &quot; Public broadcasting -- I watch that a lot. &quot; As a big_shot , you fork over $ 40 to avoid three months of maintenance work required of newcomers . You tip guards to avoid getting_up at 6 a.m. for roll_call . You tip the industrious messengers who race each other to bring news of a visitor at the gate . Perks and appliances enter for a fee ; guards charge $ 20 for bringing_in a radio . Scotch , marijuana and other prohibited items cost more . The price for sneaking_in a gun is as high as $ 5 # 000 . You spread enough money around , Angel says , and &quot; you can get what you need. &quot; SINCE THE PENITENTIARY WAS built_in 1956 as a municipal jail with a capacity of 600 , Tijuana has surged from honky-tonk to metropolis . The city ' s population now approaches 2 million , fed by trans-border industry and migration at the world ' s busiest international boundary . Always notorious for vice , Tijuana has evolved into a hub for multimillion-dollar criminal enterprises : drug trafficking , immigrant smuggling , car theft . Growth overwhelmed infrastructure , including law_enforcement . Migrants from throughout Mexico filled desperate shantytowns , often hoping to cross to California , sometimes ending_up behind bars . Officials , moved by both humanitarianism and payoffs , soon began allowing families to build housing within the walls . Replicating the helter-skelter sprawl of Tijuana , incarcerated workmen erected two-story blocks that consumed most open space . &quot; The government was obligated to construct at the rhythm dictated by reality , but it was not done , &quot; says Jose Luis Perez Canchola , Baja California ' s human_rights ombudsman . &quot; Two factors converged : The state did not invest enough for an appropriate jail . . . . At the same time the market flourished in selling spaces , construction permits , properties . And then the sales among the inmates themselves . It has all been corruption and bureaucracy. &quot; In recent years , the state has improved pay and training in hopes of rooting_out persistent corruption among the guards , who routinely carry guns on patrol among the inmates . Officers earn an average of about $ 500 a month . ( But in the California system , better pay and high-tech vigilance have not eliminated bloodshed , drugs and bribery , notes Sgt . Chacon , the San Diego prison gang expert . &quot; What ' s the difference ? &quot; he asks . &quot; A guy in Pelican Bay ( California ' s maximum security prison ) can still order a murder in another prison . The power to kill is still there. &quot; ) Americas Watch and other human_rights watchdogs have criticized Mexican prisons for overcrowding , corruption , squalor and constitutional violations such_as the mixing of sentenced convicts and suspects awaiting trial . In La Mesa , killers live next to drug-mules who live next to the wrongly accused . &quot; The Napoleon law , man , &quot; says Mario , referring to the Napoleonic Code , the foundation of Mexican law . &quot; Guilty until proven innocent. &quot; Whether guilty or innocent , those who run_afoul of Mexico ' s troubled justice system tend to be the most vulnerable . &quot; The rich don ' t go_to jail , &quot; says Perez Canchola , the rights ombudsman . &quot; And there are many criminals among the rich . . . . It is a very unjust situation. &quot; The most desperate of the poor in La Mesa are the drug_addicts , more_than 500 of them . Their hustling and marauding charge the streets with a roiling energy . &quot; We knew there were drugs , &quot; says a former high-ranking guard . &quot; We attacked heroin , but not marijuana . You punish the seller but not the user . You have to leave the poor something or they ' ll explode . It calms them down. &quot; Says Victor Clark Alfaro , a Tijuana human_rights activist who works with inmates : &quot; La Mesa is a latent bomb. &quot; Periodically , it does explode : In 1978 , the warden , his assistant and two guards were killed , one of several multiple shootings over the years . In 1991 , a corruption scandal felled another warden , a military_man chosen for his stern reputation . Then in January , after a harrowing disturbance in which inmates fired guns into the air , warden Duarte removed his commander and three other top officers . They allegedly beat_up a convicted murderer after getting_word that he was hired to kill the commander in retaliation for a crackdown on misconduct . The strained relations between the state and federal_governments worsen La Mesa ' s plight , according to critics . Gov . Ruffo , elected in 1989 as the first opposition-party governor in modern Mexican history , contends that federal_officials neglect Baja ' s budget because the state is a bastion of opposition to the dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party . Federal criminals account_for close to half the population , but no federal institution exists in Baja . Construction of a new state_prison at Tecate ground to a halt years ago for murky reasons , leaving a ghostly compound in the mountains . The pattern has become familiar . The Tijuana press , generally eager to criticize an opposition administration , thunders about the latest crisis . The government pledges reform . The attention subsides . DOWN THE BLOCK FROM ANGEL ' S balcony , in one of the old dormitories known as tanques , a gloomy passageway leads into a congested warren of cells resembling pigeon coops . Men smoke cigarettes on benches , murmuring in the near-dark . A precarious staircase winds_up to the workshop of Celestino Martinez , 29 . As in many other hard-luck stories , his began when he crossed illegally into the United States . The immigrant from Guanajuato settled in a San Diego barrio , where he did landscaping jobs and eventually won resident status . But then his marriage fell_apart . On the day the divorce became final six years ago , Martinez went looking_for his ex-wife . &quot; I was out of control , &quot; he says , eyes haunted behind thick glasses . &quot; I killed her. &quot; He fled to his parents ' home_in Tijuana . Mexican authorities hunted him down and tried him in cooperation with San Diego officials under a Mexican law that allows prosecution for crimes committed abroad . He got 11 years . Martinez has become a skilled woodworker , seeking redemption in sculpted crucifixes and statues . The working poor here do what they have always done outside : shine shoes , serve food , sift through garbage like the professional scavengers of Mexico ' s urban dumps . Until about two years ago , hundreds of inmates could not even afford a bed . The homeless of La Mesa curled_up in dormitory hallways known caustically as los freeways . Recent construction of two cellblocks with a capacity of 1 # 350 has reduced homelessness , providing the only living space that is not for_sale . &quot; It ' s not fair to say nothing has changed , &quot; says warden Duarte . &quot; But we have two types of housing -- the official housing , which is a cell for six people , and then the individual housing , with more conveniences . This implies a very serious problem for the prison and the government itself. &quot; Unabated population growth still forces grim improvisations . Two men bunk on the shelves of an old cabinet in a stairwell . Another lives in a furnished top-floor loft with a low ceiling ; his head disappears through a hatch when he stands . When inmate Norma Yvette Araujo arrived_at La Mesa , she spent two nightmarish weeks without a place to live . The 32-year-old former accounting clerk sought refuge in corridors and stairwells , wrapped shuddering in a blanket during the menacing pre-dawn hours . &quot; I was terrified , &quot; says Norma , a divorced mother of three . &quot; I didn ' t sleep the whole time. &quot; Today , she lives comfortably in an individual cell she bought for $ 300 in the tranquil women ' s dormitory that is decorated with plants and multicolored crepe_paper . The dormitory is the only area segregated by gender . &quot; As a woman , you have to be careful , &quot; Norma says . &quot; I say hello to everybody . But there are certain carracas where I do not visit . There are certain places I don ' t go. &quot; Five years ago , Norma moved to Tijuana from Mexico_City to be near her family , immigrants living_in Los Angeles . But she was arrested for possession of five grams of marijuana and now she works_at the prison maquiladora to support her children , who sometimes stay with her at La Mesa . Prices in the prison are artificially high , forcing reliance on the lifeline of family and friends . &quot; Every diaper costs 50 cents , &quot; Norma says . &quot; A bottle of milk that would cost me $ 2 outside costs almost $ 4. &quot; Norma ' s black hair cascades_down her back . Her wardrobe is well-kept -- sweaters , a sports jacket , crisp jeans . She has a pleasant , slightly gap-toothed smile . In a conscious effort to stay busy , she takes English_classes and belongs_to the theater ensemble , which has performed around Tijuana . Exuding serenity , Norma exchanges greetings with passersby as she strolls down the manic thoroughfare known as the Boulevard of the Eagles . She stops in_for a cup_of_tea at an Asian food stand run_by a group of accused immigrant smugglers , marooned Taiwanese sailors from three ships that were intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard off Baja and turned_over to the Mexican Navy last year . Nine-year-old Esmeralda comes running_up and gives her mother a hug . Norma supplies her with change and sends her scampering back to the children crowded around the video arcade in the sun-splashed plaza . Esmeralda is old enough to be frightened by the surroundings . &quot; She says , ' Mami , I don ' t like this place , ' &quot; Norma explains . &quot; She doesn ' t go anywhere alone . She ' s scared. &quot; Four months after Norma was imprisoned , she gave_birth to her youngest daughter , now a year old . &quot; It was very tough and very sad for me that she was born here . I had her here for the first three months , then my brothers took her to Los Angeles . They bring her and she spends 10 days , a week , 15 days with me . So she doesn ' t forget me. &quot; ARMS FOLDED , A SHORT , SOLEMN MAN OVERSEES EMPLOYEES BENT OVER sewing_machines in a 24-hour workshop that produces clothes to be sold in California . A husky young bodyguard in a cowboy_hat watches the door . The man in_charge has a gray mustache and favors fashionable warm-up suits . His cap bears the legend &quot; Commander in Chief. &quot; He is Antonio Vera Palestina , who is serving 25 years for the 1988 assassination of Hector ( Gato ) Felix Miranda , a crusading Tijuana columnist . Vera formerly directed security at the Agua Caliente racetrack owned by businessman Jorge Hank Rhon , a target of Felix ' s column . Mexican journalists have demanded for years that authorities investigate whether Hank ordered the murder . Hank , whose father is Mexico ' s agriculture minister , denies involvement and has never been charged . Vera opened the garment business last year and obtained contracts with U.S.-owned maquiladoras , low-wage plants that dominate the border economy . Workers earn between $ 5 and $ 13 a day , not much less than on the outside ; the penitentiary gets almost 100 sorely needed jobs ; Vera collects a profit . Rich inmates constitute a formidable shadow government . &quot; The big_shots don ' t escape because they don ' t want to , &quot; says Jesus ( Flaco ) Araiza , the officially designated inmate coordinator who controls everything from work assignments to property disputes . &quot; They take_care of their business from in here . They are comfortable. &quot; Araiza ' s nickname means &quot; Skinny , &quot; but he is bulkier than the sobriquet suggests . The respect he enjoys is evident as he roams the prison with a swashbuckling languor , calling orders over his shoulder to a cleanup crew , joking about his hangover with a deferential guard , handing a coin to a beggar . &quot; The authorities don ' t interfere , &quot; says Araiza , who owns a thriving restaurant in the plaza . &quot; We run the businesses , the sales of carracas . Among ourselves. &quot; Araiza , who is more_than six feet tall , bought his well-appointed apartment for $ 3 # 000 and had the ceiling raised to accommodate his height . He predicts it will sell for $ 10 # 000 when he finishes his seven-year drug trafficking sentence . Araiza entrusts only his servant with the keys . Guards do not have keys to carracas ; residents lock themselves in at night . &quot; It ' s my own little jail , &quot; Araiza says . &quot; And I ' m the jailer. &quot; Press reports have said that Araiza is one of the chieftains in the prison ' s so-called mafias , which run liquor , prostitution and protection rackets and have ready access to hidden guns that elude sweeps by police . Authorities confiscated 50 firearms last year . Araiza scoffs at those accounts . &quot; They said I walk_around with 20 bodyguards , &quot; he says . &quot; Do you see any bodyguards ? &quot; But he can field a personal security_force in a hurry if hostilities break_out . &quot; You have to . You ' re not going_to make_it alone. &quot; One former pistolero -for-hire describes the life : He earned free meals , marijuana and about $ 5 a day for guarding the steel door of a drug dealer ' s carraca . &quot; Sometimes I had to push people out , &quot; he says . &quot; And sometimes I had to pull them inside. &quot; The king of the La Mesa gunslingers appears to be Comandante Zafiro ( Commander Sapphire ) . Tomas Gonzalez Zamacona , 37 , was an officer of the federal police until he crossed the thin line separating the federales from the drug cartels . He allegedly led a band of hit_men until his conviction for a kidnap-murder last year . His ferocity has gained him near-legendary status . Since a wary phalanx of police deposited him in La Mesa last year , Comandante Zafiro has , by many accounts , established himself as a kingpin . When a federal judge went_to the prison to hear his testimony , Zafiro sent_word from his carraca that he would not come_out . The judge left . On a Saturday night last October , Zafiro and two sidekicks engaged in a wild shootout with rivals near a row of burned-out food stands . At least 27 shots were fired from semiautomatic weapons . Two gunmen were wounded , one seriously , and Zafiro was hit in the leg . Conflicting theories circulated afterward . Did another boss try to bump_off Zafiro ? Was the shooting a setup engineered to make guards take Zafiro to a hospital , where he could escape ? Regardless , Zafiro was never removed . His power brings relative peace , according to a Baja official . &quot; If you give him control , the violence stays down , &quot; the official says . &quot; Zafiro rules_in there. &quot; ON WEEKDAY MORNINGS , the perennially busy main gate releases a crowd of wives leaving for work and children going_to school . The live-in relatives bring economic as well as psychological benefits -- and present a thorny dilemma that is central to any debate about reform . &quot; It ' s not that we don ' t want to leave , it ' s the economic_conditions , &quot; says Maria Isabel Martinez , who is from Jalisco . &quot; It would cost me $ 20 just for child-care . We can ' t afford to leave. &quot; Maria , 19 , earns about $ 50 a week at an outside factory that makes briefcases and suitcases . She returns in the evening to wait in_line for guards to rummage through her grocery_bags and stamp her hand as a &quot; permanent visitor. &quot; The waits are especially lengthy on the two nights designated for conjugal visits . While Maria works , her husband baby-sits Jose Arturo , 3 , and Joanna , 1 . &quot; The men stay out of trouble because their kids are here , &quot; Maria says . &quot; They control themselves for the sake of the kids. &quot; The children play outside near a row of concrete washbasins that serve as the communal laundry . About 100 feet away , junkies duck behind a coffin-like box to inject themselves . &quot; It ' s up_to me to raise the kids right , &quot; Maria says . &quot; We keep them close by . Some people let them run_around alone. &quot; Having visited prisons in the United States , Cuba and Russia , warden Duarte asserts that Mexico ' s liberal visiting policy is among the most progressive . &quot; We do not understand a philosophy that prohibits conjugal visits . That is nothing more_than punishment , not rehabilitation. &quot; But he agrees with experts who want the government to provide alternative housing for the wives and children of La Mesa , the only Mexican prison in which carracas and families are permanent fixtures . The environment breeds exploitation of women , who are pressured into prostitution . Although most children are showered with affection , the playground becomes increasingly treacherous as they grow_up . &quot; It helps rehabilitate the inmate , &quot; says rights activist Clark . &quot; But this also hurts the family . They are manufacturing future criminals. &quot; At least theoretically , new family members have been discouraged from moving_in . Duarte would like to remove those who remain . But previous attempts provoked violent protests . Inmates have come_to regard singular practices as inalienable rights . To demolish 33 carracas for the construction of the new school , for example , authorities had to engage in protracted negotiations . The true solution is to build another prison in Baja , Duarte says . &quot; In the long_run , we have to think_about another facility . It ' s not possible to have this many people in here. &quot; ON THE FEAST_DAY OF THE Virgin of Guadalupe , patron_saint of Mexico , the bishop of Tijuana pays a visit to inaugurate the new chapel . Shaking hands , dispensing laminated pictures of the_Virgin , Bishop Emilio Carlos Berlie Belaunzaran makes his way smoothly through the men lining the chain-link fence that separates the chapel from the plaza . The chilly interior is packed with a visiting choir in wool ponchos and families in their Sunday_best : wet-combed toddlers , stern fathers in sunglasses , a mother with black hair swept_up by glittering ribbons decorated with pictures of Minnie Mouse . The little boy named Mascara drifts among the pews . He fixes his mute questioning stare on adults until they notice him , smiling down in surprise . Mascara follows a carpenter carrying a wooden cross to the altar . When the bishop blesses the cross , the carpenter breaks_down and weeps . Mascara finds a good spot next to the choir . Bishop Berlie leads the Mass . He asks the_Virgin to bestow mercy and comfort on the people of La Mesa . Afterward , he baptizes 32 babies born to inmates . Then the congregation emerges on the steps of the chapel and faces the mob : the forlorn migrants , the baleful addicts . A chant builds expectantly : &quot; Bolo ! &quot; The word refers to the time-honored ritual in which godfathers must dispense alms to the poor after the christening . On cue , the godfathers toss a shower of coins through the fence into the plaza . The mob goes wild . Dozens of men lunge , wrestle , scrabble for the skittering coins . The frenzy seems sure to end in bloodshed . But it subsides . The men dust themselves off , laughing . And through it all , this ritual of faith and despair , Mascara watches .</TEXT>
