   <HEADLINE> UPDATE ; ATOMIC BOMBING EXHIBIT HAS VETERANS UP IN ARMS ; SOME SAY SMITHSONIAN DISPLAY WILL IGNORE JAPANESE ATROCITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During perhaps the most critical moment of the 20th Century , Maj . Thomas W . Ferebee peered down from the Enola Gay bomber at a T-shaped bridge . Two minutes later , he had changed the world forever . A 9 # 000-pound atomic_bomb called &quot; Little Boy &quot; fell_out of the sky at 8:15 a.m. on Aug . 6 , 1945 , and leveled the Japanese city of Hiroshima . Tens of thousands of lives were simultaneously saved and lost with the flip of a switch , and the mushroom_cloud that hovered over Hiroshima became the first lasting image of the Atomic Age . The days and years that followed produced other images , both proud and fearful -- a sailor bending his sweetheart in a homecoming kiss , diplomats walking the thin line between deterrence and destruction , missile-carrying ships crawling first toward Cuba , then away . Today , World_War_II veterans and historians are engaging in a tug-of-war over the meaning of those photographic images and hence , over the fabric of history . As the Smithsonian Institution prepares to pull the Enola Gay , the legendary Air_Force B-29 Superfortress that delivered Little Boy , from its resting place for an exhibit commemorating the first atomic bombing , decades-old tensions over the attack are festering again . Aviators and combat veterans say the planned exhibit , titled &quot; The Last Act : The Atomic Bomb and the End of World_War_II , &quot; will present an unfair and incomplete picture of the war by highlighting the devastation caused by the bomb without also portraying atrocities by the Japanese military . Early blueprints for the display included far more photos of Japanese victims than U.S. casualties . Veterans say making the Enola Gay , which has been sitting in a dusty Maryland hangar for nearly 50 years , part of such a display would dishonor the warplane . Historians at the National Air and Space Museum have insisted that their display , which has been re-scripted to pacify critics repeatedly since March , will be unbiased . Museum Director John Harwit has said the exhibit will present the &quot; naked brutality &quot; of the Japanese forces , which tortured POWs and performed biological experiments on innocent victims . For months , Air_Force officials , members of Congress and veterans have been negotiating with the exhibit ' s designers to find some middle ground . &quot; Now , the heels are dug_in , &quot; said Jack Giese , a spokesman for the Air_Force Assn. , a group made_up of veterans , active military members and civilian supporters . Efforts to find a balance in the exhibit have deteriorated into an acerbic feud that threatens to produce a result that satisfies no one . The 5 # 500-square-foot display , set to open next May , even has spurred infighting among museum staff . Under the current layout , the exhibit will consist_of five areas , each with artifacts on display and captions explaining their significance . The first area , called &quot; A Fight to the Finish , &quot; will focus_on combat in the Pacific . It features an Ohka Japanese suicide bomber used against U.S. ships . The second area recounts how President Harry S . Truman arrived_at his decision to drop the bomb and includes a replica of the &quot; Fat Man &quot; atomic_bomb that razed the Japanese city of Nagasaki eight days after the first bomb . The forward 60 feet of the Enola Gay ' s bullet-shaped fuselage will be the centerpiece of the third section , &quot; Delivering the Bomb. &quot; The fourth area , &quot; Ground Zero , &quot; is the &quot; emotional center &quot; of the exhibit , administrators say . It will include photos of the decimation inflicted on the two Japanese targets , the charred remnants of a schoolgirl ' s meal , a clock forever frozen at 8:15 a.m. &quot; We certainly aren ' t trying to shock people , but we ' re going to accurately show the destruction on the ground , &quot; said Mike Fetters , museum spokesman . The last area , &quot; The Legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , &quot; will revisit the immediate post-World War II period , the Cold_War and the nuclear arms race . Veterans say the display , particularly the post-war section , is geared toward politically correct revisionism . The exhibit largely ignores the significance of the Japanese attack on Pearl_Harbor and the Bataan death march , they say -- and by devoting too_much space to issues such_as nuclear proliferation and brinkmanship by the superpowers , the museum seems to apologize for U.S. use of the bomb . The Air_Force Assn . and other groups have demanded the designers re-script the display . Two dozen members of Congress , distressed by a &quot; lack of context &quot; in the display , said in an August letter to Robert M . Adams , secretary of the Smithsonian Institution , that the exhibit blueprint is &quot; anti-American &quot; because it includes more photographs of Japanese casualties than American casualties . And on Friday , the Senate unanimously passed a non-binding resolution urging the Smithsonian not to discount the sacrifice of American veterans in its exhibit of the Enola Gay . To appease critics , exhibit designers have added an anteroom to the main gallery with more background information on how the war began . To get_to the main exhibit , visitors would pass_through the anteroom , featuring about 50 photographs and focused_on the ways that Americans experienced the Pacific War , both on the battlefield and at_home .</TEXT>
