   <HEADLINE> RESEARCH ADVANCES ARE BEING MADE ; HEALTH : EFFORTS TOWARD UNDERSTANDING ALZHEIMER ' S ' ARE GOING LIKE GANGBUSTERS. ' DRUGS THAT MAY SLOW THE DISEASE ARE BEING TESTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The prognosis for Alzheimer ' s patients nowadays is still not good . Cognex , the one drug approved to treat the condition , only relieves symptoms . But , according to Carl W . Cotman , a prominent psychobiologist who directs UC Irvine ' s research into Alzheimer ' s , efforts toward understanding the disease &quot; are going like gangbusters . It ' s an amazing rate of progress. &quot; Drugs that may slow the disease are being tested . Researchers have long known that the disease kills cells in the brain ' s cortex , memory cells that don ' t regenerate . The effect , which worsens over the years , is partially erased memories and an inability to store new ones . Cotman says the newest , most promising hypothesis is that Alzheimer ' s is actually normal body_processes running amok . Brain_cells receive orders to destroy themselves and comply , but the orders are bogus . Programmed cell death , or apoptosis , is an established fact in all body cells , Cotman says . Under certain circumstances , a cell will trigger its own program for self-destruction . &quot; It ' s kind of like a society that would ask an undesirable person to go take a permanent walk into the wilderness . We think it initially was an adaptive mechanism that is used to take_out bad-performing cells or sick cells , and it ' s just running_away in Alzheimer ' s disease. &quot; A protein called beta amyloid is exuded by neurons for some unknown purpose and accumulates in the fluids outside the cell . Everyone has a small amount of it , but with age , the concentration builds . In some people the proteins spontaneously condense into a sticky , fibrous substance that cannot be dissolved . Like plaque on teeth , this substance binds to the outside of the cells and somehow stimulates or simulates the signal for cell suicide . &quot; It triggers a process intended to be triggered by something else , &quot; Cotman says . * So far , a_few high-risk factors have been identified for Alzheimer ' s . A head injury or cardiovascular_disease seems to signal a greater likelihood of developing Alzheimer ' s . Researchers are also on the track of genetic indicators and have a_few promising clues . Meanwhile , researchers are experimenting with ways of slowing the Alzheimer ' s progress . &quot; We ' re testing whether physical activity might produce something in the system that interferes with the Alzheimer ' s process , &quot; Cotman says . &quot; It ' s a shot in the dark , but we ' re encouraged . We ' re getting some indications , but it ' s too early . &quot; It also turns_out that education is an offset . Apparently if you stimulate the brain , it becomes more resistant . It ' s ' use it or lose_it , ' exactly. &quot; * Vitamin_C and E sometimes are prescribed to protect against , perhaps even slow , the progress of Alzheimer ' s , but their effectiveness has not been proved . &quot; There is solid evidence that the vitamins protect against heart and blood_vessel problems due_to aging , and they ' re safe to take_in moderate quantities , so why not ? &quot; Cotman says . &quot; I take a gram of C and 800 units of E daily , but it varies person to person. &quot; Most diseases are studied through animal tests , but for Alzheimer ' s &quot; there ' s no animal model ; that ' s the big problem , &quot; Cotman says . &quot; We haven ' t figured_out how to give rats Alzheimer ' s yet . So you ' re into cell culture and simpler models , and so whatever you ' ve got , you ' ve got_to work_on it until it ' s safe , then put it in man to find_out . that ' s very time-consuming. &quot; Something similar to Alzheimer ' s does occur in animals , Cotman says . Other primates show similar symptoms in old_age . Old dogs sometimes suffer from memory problems , making_it literally impossible to teach them new tricks . &quot; The real efforts in Alzheimer ' s research are only a_few years old , &quot; Cotman says , &quot; but we ' re getting more and more solid leads all_the time. &quot; STEVE EMMONS</TEXT>
