   <HEADLINE> MAJOR CRIME_RATE UP 8 % ON UC IRVINE CAMPUS ; VIOLENCE : STATISTICS WERE LOWER FOR THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AS A WHOLE OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Major crime increased 8 % at the UC Irvine campus in 1993 over the previous year , while the rate was lower for the state ' s university system as_a_whole , according to University of California police . The reason for the increase from 651 cases to 706 cases was a significant rise in property crimes , such_as burglary and theft . However , violent crime at UCI dipped slightly , from 14 to 13 incidents . UCI still ranked fourth in violent crime among nine UC campuses , behind UCLA , UC Berkeley and UC Riverside . The UCI Medical_Center , which is located off campus , had 27 % fewer major crimes in 1993 compared to 1992 . Major crimes are classified as homicide , rape , robbery , aggravated assault , burglary , theft and arson . For violent crime , UCI compared favorably to the rest of the UC system , which overall had a 24 % jump in violent crime -- from 162 to 200 cases -- from 1992 to 1993 . More_than a quarter of those crimes -- 65 incidents -- occurred at UCLA . Some authorities cautioned against drawing conclusions from the statistical changes . &quot; We ' re dealing with very small numbers ( of crimes ) to begin with , &quot; said John A . Anderson , UC San Diego police_chief and coordinator of UC system ' s Police Services . &quot; So , the percentage increases look much larger than they would be in a large municipality. &quot; At UCI , theft led the list of most common crimes , according to the report issued by university police . Statistics indicate that about 150 bicycles were reported stolen from the UCI campus in 1993 , up 46 % from the previous year . Statistics show that no bicycle theft cases were solved in 1993 . &quot; Bike thefts have been problematic on campuses for several years , &quot; Anderson said . UCI police started their first bike patrols last year . Five UCI police_officers were trained at the San Bernardino County Sheriff ' s Department in bike-assisted policing , and now use mountain_bikes to move_around the campus . &quot; It ' s proven itself in that we ' re able to access areas faster than we would on foot , &quot; UCI Assistant Police_Chief Dennis Powers said . &quot; It also touches_on community-based policing because officers can meet people one-on-one. &quot; Although bicycle theft was up at UCI , statistics show 4 % fewer bicycles were stolen throughout the entire UC system . But robbery jumped 25 % and aggravated assaults grew 31 % systemwide , and Anderson said assaults are often due_to &quot; pub fights , fights that break_out at football games , and the like. &quot; A challenge now facing UCI and UC San Diego , Anderson said , &quot; is that these campuses have become much more urban and accessible . They used to be more remote , but now areas are becoming built_up around them. &quot;</TEXT>
