   <TEXT> He has a master ' s degree in business from Harvard , a bachelor ' s in economics from Stanford and some blunt advice for the farmers at Underwood Ranches . Liquidate . If the partners auctioned_off their tractors and sold their land , they would no doubt reap a hefty sum . Enough , surely , to invest in a solid mutual_fund , kick_back and watch the dividends roll in . At least , that ' s how consultant Bill Knoke figures it . Hired to draft a long-term strategy for Underwood Ranches , Knoke discovered that the most sensible course might be the most radical . Half tongue-in-cheek , he recommended that the farmers abandon farming . &quot; People in agriculture do_it for the love of agriculture and not to make money , and that ' s a problem , &quot; Knoke said . &quot; They ' d be better_off liquidating everything . They could invest the money and earn 10 % without even working for it. &quot; Solid economic students themselves , the three partners who dominate Underwood Ranches understand their consultant ' s advice . But follow it ? No way . Not now . Not now , when the first , optimistic shoots of corn have begun to stretch their lady-finger leaves on the rich dirt known as Conejo Ranch . Not now , when they see promising new products in the pipeline , crops never before sold in North_America . No , not now . But the idea lingers , tempting . As spring sags into summer , the three worry about markets and weather and pests . &quot; There ' s always a fear of becoming another statistic , &quot; Craig Underwood says , to knowing nods . &quot; When prices are down , you wonder if they ' ll ever turn around. &quot; That fear has grown especially sharp because of the ferocious competition roaring through the produce industry . Agribusiness conglomerates are now eyeing lucrative niche crops , such_as baby carrots and esoteric salad_greens , which were once the exclusive province of smaller_farmers . The big boys of vegetables -- the Doles and Del Montes -- are poised for a killing . And on their 60-acre patch outside Camarillo , the Underwood partners feel the threat . Their specialties , such_as the gourmet greens that flourished on Conejo Ranch last season , no longer seem quite so special . Their sure things are undeniably unsure . So in some ways , the advice to liquidate makes_sense . Especially since Conejo Ranch -- newly cleared and leveled , commanding majestic mountain views -- might fetch a good price from developers . But the farmers are not yet ready to give_up . They sunk nearly $ 575 # 000 into Conejo Ranch last spring , buying the field with borrowed money and borrowing more to prepare it for farming . It ' s the only piece of property the three hold title to . They work other fields in Ventura County , have for years , but those plots are rented from absentee landlords . Conejo Ranch is theirs . Theirs to farm -- and theirs to gamble on . In buying the field for vegetables , the partners bucked a nationwide trend . Strip malls and golf_courses have sprouted everywhere , gobbling_up huge swaths of agricultural soil . Nearly 2 million acres of United States farmland vanish each year , paved under to make_way for homes and shops and parking_lots . As little guys in the produce industry , the Underwood Ranches partners understand the pressures that prompt farmers to divest . Yet , tugged toward the land , they find agriculture all but irresistible . &quot; When it ' s good , &quot; partner Jim Roberts says , &quot; it ' s really sweet. &quot; So far this year , it ' s been just shy of sweet . The ranchers have plucked a first crop of salad_greens from Conejo Ranch , the 60-acre plot that they bought with borrowed money nearly a year ago . They sold about three-quarters of the harvest , at moderate prices , and mashed the rest into the soil to decompose -- a colorful , all-organic fertilizer . The greens , turnips and radishes proved &quot; an average crop , &quot; Roberts said . Roberts hopes for better luck with Conejo Ranch ' s next crop . While the partners will continue to grow mixed greens on the fields they rent from absentee landlords , they ' ve already begun planting a summer stand of corn on Conejo Ranch . The partners at Underwood Ranches are counting_on corn in a big way this year . Not the standard , green-jacketed corn sold for a quarter an ear , with the long silk tassels and the occasional , startling maggot . The corn they ' ll sell is an upscale , easy-to-deal-with version -- pre-cut , pre-husked , and guaranteed worm-free . Three years ago , the partners ' first attempt at marketing the ready-to-eat Somis Creek Corn flopped miserably . The corn itself was good , they said , so sweet and tender that you could eat it raw . But demand was low -- very low . Underwood ended_up plowing under about half the crop , leaving it to rot in the fields . Burned once , the partners cut way back on corn production last summer . Now , however , they ' re ready to try again , backed by $ 80 # 000 worth of equipment that should fully automate the picking , husking , trimming and wrapping . &quot; Everyone has their fingers crossed , &quot; Underwood said . Secretive about their sales figures , the partners are reluctant to publicize exactly how many acres of corn they ' re planting this year . But all_of Conejo Ranch will be covered , plus some rented fields . It ' s an unusual tack for Ventura County , where corn accounts_for less than 1 % of vegetable crop sales each year . On the agricultural commissioner ' s scale of crop value , corn ranks below even obscure vegetables like kale and cilantro . But at Underwood Ranches , the partners see their corn as an ideal &quot; value added &quot; product -- a semi-prepared fresh vegetable that will command higher prices than the husk-it-yourself variety . The trio has concentrated_on marketing value-added products , from bagged salad to peeled carrots . Problem is , their competitors have the same idea . Perfect for the harried but health-conscious shopper , ready-to-eat products fly off the shelves . Industry insiders rhapsodize about value-added veggies in sound_bites studded with superlatives : Explosive ! Exciting ! The wave of the future ! At least 70 % of the new produce items introduced in American supermarkets over the past two years have been semi-processed fruits and vegetables , from bagged salads to pre-cracked coconuts , according to a Fresh Cut survey . Toss_in the statistic that the average American eats about 90 pounds of fresh vegetables a year , and you have agribusiness executives everywhere salivating about the brave new_world of ready-to-eat produce . And when the big guys salivate , the little guys sweat . With their limited resources -- several hundred employees and sales of less than $ 10 million a year -- the Underwood partners cannot begin to compete with the produce behemoths steadily moving_into the prepared-veggie market . One competitor , Ready Pac , boasts the world ' s largest vegetable processing plant in Irwindale , along with 1 # 000 employees and $ 130 million in annual sales . Ready Pac ' s dazzling line of salads dominates many supermarket produce aisles , the crinkly plastic bags screaming fuchsia and mustard-colored enticements to buyers . There ' s the Farm Fresh Salad , for example : iceberg_lettuce tossed with carrot and cabbage strings . There ' s the Caeser Salad Kit : romaine_lettuce , croutons and a sealed bag of dressing . There ' s even a Santa Barbara Salad : mixed greens sprinkled with tangy radicchio . &quot; We look_like geniuses -- everything we put_on the shelf sells , &quot; said Chris Nelson , Ready Pac ' s chief operating officer . Ready Pac has boomed so quickly that demand sometimes outstrips supply . Ironically , Nelson has been forced , on occasion , to buy salad_greens from Underwood Ranches to fill his own bags . For his part , Nelson praises the partners as &quot; very ethical , excellent people &quot; and calls Underwood Ranches &quot; a quality house. &quot; He uses their salad as a backup for his Spring Mix , he said , adding , &quot; I can ' t speak highly enough of them. &quot; Nor can he compete fast enough with them . With more and more competitors entering the fray , the Underwood partners realize their salad days could soon end . They generally expect to get a two- to three-year &quot; ride &quot; out of each product , before bigger companies come_along and outpace them . That window of profitability looks precariously close to slamming shut on the gourmet salad mixtures . &quot; We have some technical advantages that are helping us maintain our position , &quot; Jim Roberts said . &quot; And we have some degree of loyalty ( from buyers ) because we were the first with the salad . But ( competitors ) have deep pockets. &quot; Deep pockets that buy a lot . &quot; We ' ve got armies of people with Ph.D.s working in our technology department , &quot; boasts Ready Pac ' s Nelson . &quot; We have $ 2-million washing lines and ( small_farmers ) are using Kenmore washing_machines . that ' s literally the difference. &quot; Nelson ' s description is right on target . The Underwood partners actually did start_out drying their lettuce in Speed Queen laundry machines , plunking in quarters and revving_up the spin cycle . They also experimented with a low-cost , low-tech method of peeling baby carrots : churning them in a cement_mixer with a_few handfuls of railroad gravel . &quot; It worked real well , &quot; Underwood recalled , &quot; but the carrots were kind of gritty. &quot; Gritty , and ferreous . Traces of iron , possibly from the railroad gravel , stuck_to the carrots . The veggies didn ' t taste metallic , but they did set_off magnets on the packinghouse assembly_line . Perfecting the production and packaging of baby carrots took nearly three years . Developing the salad mixture , and the corn now growing on Conejo Ranch , each took three years as well . After so_much research , the partners feel confident they have a winning corn product . Yet they ' re equally sure that competitors will soon be hot on their trail . &quot; It ' s so easy in this business for people to copy what you ' re doing , &quot; Underwood said . &quot; We may spend three years developing a product , and once it ' s on the market , within six months someone else can copy it. &quot; Copying is one way to go_about it . Stealing is another . Agricultural espionage , rare in past decades , has become an irritating worry for modern-day farmers . In one spectacular case , a carrot grower in Bakersfield publicly accused a competitor of sneaking around at night to sketch and measure a brand-new , unpatented harvesting machine . The alleged spy , Dave Yurosek , admitted to The Times last summer that &quot; we had a lot of ideas and went_out and confirmed it on ( the rival ' s ) machine. &quot; Such incidents help explain why Ready Pac posts round-the-clock security_guards at every plant . To prevent leaks , the company also keeps employees away from the most sensitive machines , letting them into the processing rooms only on a &quot; need-to-know basis , &quot; Nelson said . Secrecy has become such an obsession that the National Assn . of Fresh Produce Processors has a hard_time getting an accurate picture of the $ 4 billion-a-year value-added industry . Even the trade group ' s own members refused to give_out sales figures during a survey earlier this year , spokeswoman Shelley Sapone said . And safeguards are becoming more common . An experimental variety of corn hand-planted on a sliver of Conejo Ranch is identified only by white sticks lining the rows . Several beds over , a yellow placard marking a tried-and-true variety notes only , &quot; CORN No . 1. &quot; Each marker corresponds to a file inside the Underwood Ranches office , which lists information about the seed , the fertilizer , the pesticides and other secrets . &quot; We don ' t want to write it all down here ( in the field ) because our competition could come_by , &quot; planting foreman Zavala explained . &quot; If everyone knows , we have no chance to earn money. &quot; Indeed , successful experimentation is crucial for Underwood Ranches ' long-term survival . The partners have banked their future on a strategy of innovation -- developing new products and getting them to market before anyone else catches wind . To that end , they spend roughly 25 % of their profits each year on research and development . &quot; The key for us , as with all guerrilla operations , is to fight around the edges and be quick and nimble , &quot; Roberts said . Sometimes , they wind_up with spectacular failures -- like the case of the poisoned potatoes . Eager to develop a new super-sweet variety of potato , the partners planted a four-acre test crop back in 1992 . They expected the potatoes to turn_out tender and fresh , tasting of spring itself . But , as Underwood sheepishly recalled , &quot; We had a little glitch. &quot; When the first harvest came_in , Athanassiadis zapped a plateful of the potatoes in the office microwave and dug_into a tasty lunch . Ten minutes later , he began to notice &quot; a very definite sensation of being poisoned. &quot; Somehow , he and an assistant , who also gobbled the potato lunch , managed to stay calm . The nasty feeling abated within 20 minutes . They recovered completely . Yet they weren ' t too keen on that particular variety of potato . The culprit , it later turned_out , was a type of alkaloid -- a natural organic substance that also shows_up , in various mutations , in caffeine , morphine and quinine . Found in tomato and rhubarb leaves and some potato_skins , the colorless , crystalline substance can poison animals or humans . And it overpowered the other compounds in the tiny test potatoes . Skittish about poisoning their customers , the partners had to chuck all four acres of the alkaloid-rich potatoes . They wrote_off their $ 6 # 000 investment as a loss , then started all_over again with a different variety . The three harvested their second test crop this spring -- and sent the baby potatoes to a lab for chemical_analysis before anyone dared try them . Pronounced fit to eat , the potatoes are now being test-marketed at several local groceries . To help them plan beyond the potatoes , Underwood and his partners recently spent several thousand dollars to hire two strategists . The first , Danilo Lopez , has three decades of experience in the produce industry . The other , Bill Knoke , has worked with high-tech firms for years , and knows more about aerospace than carrots . The farmers have pestered their consultants with questions like : How much should the company grow ? How can they speed_up research and development ? How can they encourage customer loyalty ? And , most basically : How can they thrive in such tumultuous times ? The consultants ' suggestions have already prompted some changes . On Lopez ' s advice , the farmers hired two new sales associates . They ' re also continuing to study ways to expand existing product_lines . But the grand strategies mean little in the day-to-day grind of this hectic spring planting season . Whether fighting_off cutworms or fertilizing the soil , the farmers must plow through the daily tasks that nurture life on Conejo Ranch . ABOUT THIS SERIES &quot; 60 Acres of Hope , &quot; a series that began in October , follows the first year of a Southern California farm . Three previous articles traced the field ' s first crop of gourmet salad_greens from planting to harvest to market . This story looks_at the field ' s second crop -- corn -- and explores the farmers ' attempts to develop new products to compete in a crowded industry . Future stories will focus_on a continuing battle with the U . S . Environmental Protection Agency and will evaluate the economics of the field ' s first year . Crop Pests The corn planted at Conejo Ranch in March needs to be protected from a variety of pests during its short lifetime . Most varieties of corn take 78 to 95 days to mature , depending_on the weather and soil conditions . From seed to stalk , corn is treated with fungicides and pesticides to safeguard it from predators . Fungus Problem : Immediately after planting , a corn seed begins sucking moisture from the soil . The seed swells with water and then bursts , leaving its starchy endosperm exposed . A fungus may eat this carbohydrate-rich material and destroy the seed . Treatment : All seeds are coated with a fungicide and sometimes with an insecticide as well . Timing : Applied before planting A Mature Cron Seed : Fungus may attack the endosperm once a seed has burst . The seed_coat protects the endosperm and embryo . The embryo develops_into a new plant . Cutworm Problem : Cutworms cut_through corn stalks underground . They can even fell a plant that has grown_up to six inches tall . Treatment : A granular insecticide is spread across the field . The insecticide trickles through a large funnel , which is pulled by a tractor along each bed . Timing : As soon as the worms are spotted , usually within first month after planting . Cutworm : ( Shown curled_up as it does during daylight hours ) Earworms and Aphids Problem : Just as the corn blossom , a moth lays eggs in the ear silk . When the eggs hatch , the worms crawl out and gnaw the corn . Aphids , which appear during earworm treatment , suck juices out of the corn . Treatment : Insecticides are sprayed by helicopter or using tractors that ride above the corn , misting each ear . Aphids appear during treatment because spraying kills their predators . Amount of insecticide is increased to kill aphids . Timing : Three to four treatments as the corn blossoms . Sources : Iowa State University ; Cal Poly , Pomona ; Jim Roberts , Underwood Ranches .
