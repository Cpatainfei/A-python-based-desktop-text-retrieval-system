   <HEADLINE> AEROSPACE WALK OF HONOR INDUCTS 5 ; AVIATION : LANCASTER PAYS TRIBUTE TO DECORATED TEST_PILOTS -- TWO POSTHUMOUSLY . THEY JOIN 20 OTHERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Robert Rahn remembers the first time he saw a jet airplane as he taxied down a runway in 1940 . Little did he know then that within 10 years he would be one of the nation ' s first pilots to fly one . &quot; I saw them placing blocks underneath the wheels of this strange aircraft , &quot; Rahn said . &quot; What ' s that ? &quot; he asked , calling_down to a ground_crew member , who told him , &quot; It ' s a jet airplane. &quot; &quot; that ' s nice , &quot; Rahn recalled saying . &quot; What ' s a jet airplane ? &quot; Rahn , 73 , was one of five decorated test_pilots inducted Sunday into the city of Lancaster ' s Aerospace Walk of Honor in a ceremony that featured &quot; Star Trek &quot; legend Leonard Nimoy , who separated Mr. Spock ' s fictional heroics from the work of real heroes . &quot; I believe_in the Aerospace Walk of Honor because I believe_in history , &quot; Nimoy said . &quot; History begins with the willingness of one person to do something first . To boldly go where no one has gone before , &quot; he added , borrowing the now-famous phrase from the popular television series . Along with Rahn , Air_Force Col . Charles C . Bock Jr. , Herman Richard Salmon , Maj . Gen . Robert A . Rushworth and Alvin S . White were honored at the fifth annual awards ceremonies at the Lancaster Performing Arts Center . The inductees join 20 test_pilots who have been honored since the city began the awards program in 1990 . Together , the pilots honored Sunday logged more_than 40 # 000 hours of flight time , carried_out hundreds of combat_missions and flew some of the first jets ever built . &quot; It means an awful lot because of all_the past honorees , some who I ' ve known for 50 years , &quot; Rahn said . &quot; Jimmy Dolittle was a hero of mine. &quot; Salmon , a gifted test_pilot who , it was said , could &quot; feel with the plane , &quot; and Rushworth , who flew the X-15 rocket research aircraft 34 times , were honored posthumously and their awards were accepted by family members . Bock participated in the SR-71 Blackbird Test Program in 1965 , and flew more_than 70 aircraft as well as flying more_than 100 combat_missions in Korea and Vietnam . When he tested the XF4D Skyray , a prototype Navy fighter jet , Rahn became the first man to break the sound_barrier and perform a spin and recovery maneuver in a delta wing aircraft . He is also the only Army pilot honored in the Navy Test_Pilot Hall of Honor . At a reception before the ceremony , Rahn marveled at the changes in aviation that have occurred since he left the U.S. Air_Force Test_Pilot School in Lancaster nearly 50 years ago . &quot; In 50 years , we went from 15 # 000 pounds of thrust for an entire plane to 90 # 000 pounds of thrust -- and that ' s just one engine in a commercial airliner , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s just phenomenal. &quot; Alvin S . White , a World_War_II combat veteran , was honored for his work as an engineering test_pilot . He also helped design parachutes used on the ground to slow aircraft , and ejection_seats . White took two experimental aircraft to a speed of more_than 2 # 000 m.p.h. while working as the chief test_pilot for North_American Aviation . White , 76 , also told a tale about how he survived a midair collision during an experimental flight in the final stages of testing for the XB-70 , a bomber developed to replace the B-52 . The plane was later used as a research aircraft . After his plane scraped wings with an escort fighter , the bomber went_into a spin and fell 20 # 000 feet before he was able to escape in an ejector_seat , White said . &quot; We got hit at 30 # 000 feet , and I got_out about 10 # 000 feet , &quot; White said . &quot; My co-pilot was killed. &quot;</TEXT>
