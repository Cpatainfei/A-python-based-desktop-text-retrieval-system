   <HEADLINE> WORK_FORCE DIVERSITY ; EEOC : THE MILL GRINDS SLOWLY ; AT UNDERSTAFFED AND UNDERBUDGETED AGENCIES , THE BACKLOG OF CASES CONTINUES TO GROW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a real-life episode that invites comparisons to the Michael Crichton bestseller &quot; Disclosure , &quot; Sabino Gutierrez alleged that his boss at a Pomona spa company regularly embraced him , kissed him , fondled him and told him of her desire to have_sex with him . When Gutierrez announced his engagement to another woman , the supervisor , Maria Martinez , had his office demolished , demoted him and eventually tried to get him fired , Gutierrez later said in court records . He complained to the company ' s owner , then to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . All to no avail . &quot; By that time , there was not much I could do . I could leave the job . . . or I had to confront the problem , &quot; he said in an interview . In the end , Gutierrez , 34 , took his case to a private lawyer , Carla Barboza , now a partner with Walker &amp; Barboza in Los Angeles . In 1992 , he filed a sex-discrimination lawsuit against Martinez and California Acrylic Industries Inc. , or Cal-Spas . Last May , a jury awarded him more_than $ 1 million in what was believed to be the first verdict of its kind . That verdict is being appealed ; a judge has already reduced the award to $ 350 # 000 in response to a defense motion . Martinez , who is chief financial_officer of Cal-Spas , denies there was any sexual_harassment . However the case turns_out , it highlights the limited options available to someone who feels discriminated against but doesn ' t have a lot of money . If not for Barboza ' s willingness to take his case without a retainer -- unusual for an attorney in private practice -- Gutierrez may have had no other recourse . Ostensibly , the federal EEOC and its state counterparts help anyone who believes he or she has been the victim of illegal discrimination in the workplace . Plaintiffs are required to pursue their complaints through these agencies before seeking legal remedies . In reality , however , the agencies are overworked , underbudgeted and understaffed , and few of the cases brought_to them result in corrective action . After a worker first contacts the EEOC , it can be months before an investigator is assigned , and months longer before the investigation begins . In an internal analysis , the EEOC found that the average processing time for a case in 1993 was 294 days -- two days longer than the year before . And the backlog is growing with complaints covered by the new Americans With Disabilities Law . If discrimination is found , the agency can issue a letter stating the offense and seeking negotiation of a settlement or , ultimately , court action . The likelihood of legal_action is small , however . In 1993 , the EEOC dismissed or found no discrimination in 84.2 % of the charges brought_to it . Long before the process runs its course , however , most complainants may request a letter authorizing them to pursue a lawsuit on_their_own -- in_effect freeing the agency from further responsibility . Most lawyers who handle discrimination cases urge workers to pursue internal remedies first : talk with their supervisors , personnel officer or other company officials , or go_through mediation . that ' s particularly important if a worker wishes to remain on good terms with the employer . If talks don ' t resolve the situation , the employee can turn_to a public interest law_firm or legal aid . But the case must be a strong one or one that will have meaning for a large group of workers , such lawyers say . To hire a lawyer , a worker must have money up front or expect an award that would cover the $ 15 # 000 to $ 30 # 000 cost of litigating a routine discrimination case , Barboza said . &quot; If you have someone who is experiencing discrimination in the workplace , but not at a_level that will command six-figure damages in court . . . or if you have a $ 10 # 000 case , then you have no access to the private legal_system , &quot; said Douglas J . Farmer , a former trial_attorney with the EEOC in San Francisco who now represents employers in discrimination cases for the law_firm Corbett &amp; Kane in Emeryville , Calif . Michael Wilton , 40 , an African American who has worked 19 years as a gardener for the city and county of San Francisco , found that out . Wilton says he has been a victim of racial discrimination on_the_job since 1989 . He filed several complaints with the EEOC and sought help from at least six private lawyers . None would take his case . He eventually ended_up at the city ' s nonprofit Employment Law Center . Staff attorney William McNeill listened to Wilton ' s complaints and helped him file a federal lawsuit , but chose not to represent him in court . Why ? Wilton ' s case would have required too_much factual investigation and didn ' t have broad enough application to others , McNeill said . Wilton ' s 1991 lawsuit was thrown_out of court when the city sought and won a summary_judgment . He has appealed . Consulting a private lawyer can sometimes pay_off handsomely . Take the case of Pamela Farrington , a worker at the Albertsons supermarket in Napa . From 1984 , when she began working as a grocery bagger , Farrington had been denied promotions to the night crew or the retail floor -- jobs considered stepping stones to management . Her qualifications and seniority were disregarded and men were given the jobs , she said in court records . She and colleagues approached their union , the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers . They were referred to Saperstein , Mayeda &amp; Goldstein , an Oakland law_firm that was handling class-action discrimination suits against other grocery chains . The firm saw an opportunity to mount another class action and took the case . Months later , Albertson ' s Inc. agreed to settle . Under the terms of last November ' s pact , Farrington and 20 # 000 female and Latino employees at 144 Albertsons stores in California will get $ 29.5 million . The chain agreed to modify its employment practices without admitting any violation .</TEXT>
