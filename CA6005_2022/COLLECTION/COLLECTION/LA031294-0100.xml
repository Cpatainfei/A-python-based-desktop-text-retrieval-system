   <HEADLINE> PROSPECT OF PEACE OPENS_DOOR TO SARAJEVO EXODUS ; BOSNIA : SOME RESIDENTS SAY THEY WON ' T LEAVE . OTHERS WORRY THE CAPITAL COULD BE TAKEN BY SERBS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Inside a dank , three-room apartment they share with 10 other relatives , Aljo and Rasma Sepkic pass their idle days plotting an escape_from this ruined city that has rediscovered peace but not its spirit . Although the brutal artillery bombardment that afflicted Sarajevo for 22 months has ceased -- for now -- the Sepkics fear that there will be no chance to provide their two children with any semblance of a normal life for at least a decade . Schools operate only sporadically . Running water and electricity still depend_on the whim of armed Bosnian Serb rebels encircling Sarajevo . Snipers continue to menace pedestrians in the center of this city once renowned for its harmonious blend of cultures and religions . What the Sepkics despair about most is their native city ' s loss of hope for any rebuilding of a tolerant and multiethnic society and for a recovery of the prosperity it enjoyed before Bosnia-Herzegovina fell victim to nationalist terror . He is a mathematician , she an economist , and they once knew all_the suburban comforts enjoyed by their peers in Western Europe . Today , however , there is no local work in either profession , and those employed in Sarajevo ' s few operating offices and industries earn less than $ 2 per month in a city where the rudiments of survival are possibly more expensive than anywhere else in the world . Foreign food aid provides most families with enough flour to prepare a daily ration of bread . But meat , sugar , coffee and most vegetables -- smuggled in by thriving war profiteers -- sell for more_than $ 20 per pound . Gasoline , for the few who can afford it , has topped $ 60 per gallon . &quot; An honorable man will never again be able to make a living here , &quot; says Sepkic , who has been appealing_to friends , relatives and complete strangers in the West to give him the chance to perform even the most menial labor if Sarajevo ' s barricades are lifted and he can get his family abroad . Throughout the shattered Bosnian capital , dispirited people await the lifting of a Serb rebel blockade , as promised by officials of the U.N. Protection Force endeavoring to implement a step-by-step restoration of peace and order . Some Sarajevans say they will never abandon their city , despite the deprivations inflicted by nearly two years of war . But concerns are mounting among both U.N. officials and politicians here that the first consequence of liberation might be a mass exodus of desperate civilians , leaving Sarajevo easy prey for the Bosnian Serb gunmen who want it as the capital of_their_own rogue state . Bosnian government officials concede privately that they would prefer that the option of leaving Sarajevo be offered its war-weary residents only after the city has been at_peace for a_few months . &quot; No one yet believes the shelling has really stopped , &quot; one Sarajevo official said . &quot; If the barricades were lifted tomorrow , I think you ' d see crowds of people rushing to leave. &quot; Thousands of Sarajevans seeking refugee status in foreign countries are already listed with religious and human_rights organizations that have been negotiating with both the Muslim-led government and Bosnian Serb and Croat rebel leaders for limited evacuations of those in need of medical treatment or reunion with relatives abroad . But for the vast majority of the 380 # 000 people left in the Bosnian capital , any departure , whether permanent or temporary , must await lifting of the rebel blockade . The British commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia , Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , has promised to restore freedom of movement for Sarajevans who have been trapped in this city since rebel Serbs launched an artillery siege in the spring of 1992 , after a majority of Bosnians voted to secede from the former Yugoslav federation . Rose ' s efforts to open civilian traffic corridors in and out of Sarajevo have been stymied , however , as Serbian gunmen have refused even to allow restoration of foot_traffic over the midtown Bridge of Brotherhood and Unity that spans the Miljacka River and links the Serbian-occupied Grbavica neighborhood with the center of the capital . For those yearning for a better life elsewhere , such_as the Sepkic family , escape remains in the planning stage . Forecasts of the size of the exodus that would follow genuine liberation of Sarajevo vary widely , and the most dramatic projections usually fail to take_into_account the difficulty most Bosnians would have in obtaining the right to visit or settle abroad . Croatia , Slovenia and Austria all require Bosnian refugees to first secure visas , even if they plan only to travel through those countries while en route elsewhere . And permission to work or settle in the Western destinations most desired by those wanting to leave here -- such_as Germany , Switzerland and the United States -- is even more difficult to obtain in this time of global recession and fierce competition for jobs . Franz Bogen , Austria ' s special envoy to Bosnia who lives_in this shattered city about two weeks each month , predicts that there would be a massive outflow of Sarajevans if all barricades and travel restrictions were lifted . But he firmly believes that most would soon come_back . &quot; Everyone who leaves his country sooner or later wants to come_back . That was our experience in Croatia and I ' m sure it would be the same here , &quot; said Bogen , whose makeshift embassy at the bomb-blasted Holiday Inn still has no visa-issuing authority because there is no way for Sarajevans to travel . &quot; Everyone here has been saying for 22 months that they want to get_out . But we have to make_it clear to people that they have to be patient , they have to live through this , that there will be a future , &quot; the diplomat said . In the interim of uncertainty , though , thousands are preparing to leave . At the Interlingua private language_school in the shattered Skenderija neighborhood , nearly 200 Sarajevans have plunked_down the relative fortune of 100 German marks , about $ 65 , to study English , German , French or Italian , most in hopes of finding work abroad . &quot; Before the war , people usually planned to come_back &quot; after taking their new language skills to Western Europe to find jobs in which they could earn hard currency , said Edin Hadzic , director of the 5-year-old school . &quot; Now I think the majority would n ' t want to come back. &quot; Hadzic himself said he cannot envision choosing life as a refugee over fighting to defend what is left of his native country and culture . &quot; If the situation improves , if there is no shooting for some months , if it is peaceful and Sarajevo is not divided , then I think there is a possibility we could all live together again and people would change their minds about leaving , &quot; the 30-year-old school director said . Because normal commerce and travel have been disrupted for two years now and there are few encouraging signs that the blockade will be eased any time soon , many have given_up waiting for relief and , like the Sepkics , look outward for any chance to start over . &quot; There is no chance to rebuild this city . It is divided now . It ' s dead . No one who was a true Sarajevan will want to stay here , &quot; said 21-year-old Ariana Redzovic , who washes dishes at a cafe patronized by war profiteers to earn enough to buy the occasional potato or onion to supplement her charity flour rations . &quot; I would go anywhere , absolutely anywhere , even to Albania , if I could just get out. &quot;</TEXT>
