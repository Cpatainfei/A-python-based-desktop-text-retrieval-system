   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; OH , THE SHAME OF IT ALL : BRAZIL TIES SWEDEN ; GROUP_B : TOURNAMENT FAVORITES STILL WIN DIVISION , WITH SWEDES SECOND AFTER 1-1 DRAW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cellular phones came at Carlos Alberto Parreira like knives . Brazilian journalists screamed questions -- machine-gun fast -- at the national soccer coach , then hysterically relayed the terrible news back home into their phone receivers . The terrible news ? Tuesday afternoon , a day that will not live_in glory , Brazil clinched the Group_B title in the World Cup with a 1-1 tie against Sweden before 77 # 217 at the Pontiac Silverdome . Still the World Cup favorite , Brazil advanced to the second round and will next meet the United States at Palo Alto on Monday , the Fourth_of_July . Sweden will play the second-place finisher from Group F , still to be determined . Fact : Neither Brazil nor Sweden was motivated to win . The Swedes , who took an early 1-0 lead , knew at intermission that Russia was beating_up on Cameroon , a result that automatically assured Sweden ' s advancement . The Swedes admitted that they had not really tried to score in the second_half . Once Brazil tied the game in the 47th minute , both teams seemed content to play_out the string . Technically , for Brazil , a tie was as_good_as victory . Emotionally , however , it was another story . Hordes of drum-pounding Brazilians whistled derisively as their team played it safe . They booed when Parreira removed star midfielder , Rai , in the 83rd minute , seeing this as concession . Reporters challenged Parreira afterward for his &quot; defensive &quot; strategy . Parreira blamed the Swedes , who packed their defense to slow the Brazilian assault . Parreira also blamed the smaller-than-standard soccer dimensions at the Silverdome . Parreira insisted his team had been trying . &quot; Did you see how many times ( defender ) Leonardo went_forward ? &quot; Parreira shouted . &quot; My God ! We didn ' t change . We did what we had to do . We finished first in our group . We didn ' t change . But how can you penetrate with no space ? You have to be patient , be cool. &quot; Brazilians are rarely that when it comes_to their soccer team . With less than a dominating performance , you could sense an underlying uneasiness of Brazil now having to play the United States on its turf . Expectations for Brazil are incredible . A loss to the United States would be unthinkable . &quot; We did not want to play the U.S. on their Independence_Day , &quot; said Mario Zagalo , the Brazilian assistant coach . But Brazilian coaches and player were quick to note that Tuesday ' s game was different . &quot; It was almost like a friendly , &quot; Parreira said . &quot; It was a matter of who was going_to finish first or second place , no more_than that. &quot; Dunga , the Brazilian defender , assured anyone who would listen that there are no problems with the team . &quot; It was ugly for the players to play because there was no game to be played , because of Sweden , &quot; he said . The Swedes , who gladly took the tie , rarely challenged the Brazilian goal after scoring in the 24th minute . Sweden ' s goal was brilliantly executed , though . Taking a crossing pass from Tomas Brolin on his chest , left of the goal , forward Kennet Andersson allowed the ball to bounce once before striking a shot over the head of Claudio Taffarel , the Brazilian goalkeeper . Brazil spent most of the first_half passing the ball back and forth , often in its own end , but came_out firing after intermission . In the 47th minute , Romario dribbled his way through three defenders and pushed a shot past goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli . Brazil kept_up the pressure , but its effort produced only occasional chances . The Swedes , most of whom towered over the Brazilians , clogged the goal area with defenders and didn ' t mind using their bodies in the process . Andersson , who moved_up to take suspended forward Martin Dahlin ' s spot , said the U.S. team could learn a thing or two by watching Tuesday ' s game film . Zagalo , the Brazilian assistant , tried to put the U.S. game in perspective . &quot; When the American basketball_team plays Brazil , we pray , &quot; he said . &quot; I hope you guys pray when the Brazilian soccer teams play the U.S. &quot;</TEXT>
