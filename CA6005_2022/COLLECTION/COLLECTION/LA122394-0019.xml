   <HEADLINE> HOME ENTERTAINMENT ; A ' SOUND OF MUSIC ' LASER SET TO TREASURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a season filled with long-awaited laser-disc releases of memorable films , the &quot; 30th Anniversary Edition &quot; of &quot; The Sound of Music &quot; ( Fox Video / Image Entertainment , $ 120 ) arrives as a hallmark . The three-disc boxed set is a treasure_trove for any fan of this extraordinary 1965 film of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musical . It includes : * Five extended-play sides on which the nearly three-hour movie_starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer unfolds . The gorgeous Todd-AO film , shown in a new film-to-tape transfer using the 65mm camera negative and interpositive , was supervised by director Robert Wise and produced for laser in clear , carefully monitored THX audio and video , with an aspect_ratio of 2.2:1. The picture and sound are lush , far richer than an earlier ( 1982 ) laser release . ( Intermittently , however , on the copy previewed the color seems to occasionally fade in and out slightly , most likely the result of problems with the original source material . But there is still no comparison to the earlier disc , which literally pales in comparison. ) * An 87-minute documentary , &quot; The Sound of Music : From Fact to Phenomenon , &quot; on the making of the five-Oscar winner starts on the fifth side and continues on the standard-play sixth side . Unlike most such accounts , this documentary is a carefully put_together , thoughtful presentation that offers valuable information and historical tidbits . * A candid , informative commentary by Oscar-winning director Wise on an analog soundtrack for the full length of the film , except for the musical numbers . During those numbers , you can listen for the first time to the orchestration alone on a stereo analog track . In effect , you can have your own &quot; Sound of Music &quot; karaoke track at_home , accompanied by the lush musical direction of the late Irwin Kostal , who also won an Academy Award . * Screenwriter Ernest Lehman ' s ( &quot; West_Side Story , &quot; &quot; The King and I , &quot; &quot; Somebody Up There Likes Me &quot; ) incredibly valuable 35-minute track on the set ' s fifth-side analog channel and a booklet detailing &quot; The Saga of the Ernest Lehman Screenplay. &quot; In combination , along with Wise ' s discussion , they are an invaluable course in screenwriting taught by one of the cinema ' s premier screenwriters . * A 24-karat gold CD made from a new 75-minute master and including previously unreleased music . The music sounds great , though , it doesn ' t need gold to give it its sheen . * An eight-page full-color booklet with pictures of the entire cast , including the seven children ( who have all remained good friends ) , a timeline beginning with the birth of Georg von Trapp in 1880 , and excellent chapter stops so you can find any scene or musical number in an instant . * A host of interactive still archives tracing the history of the Von Trapp family , on whom the story is based , and the making of the film take_up the balance of the sixth side . And , if you let them , the balance of a well-spent weekend . Luckily , most of the principal players in the film ' s saga were alive during the making of this commemorative edition and cooperated eagerly in the production of this laser set , which took more_than a year for producer Mike Matessino to complete . Throughout the analog track , Wise credits Lehman , who won an Oscar for his screenplay , with finding ways of restructuring the original Howard Lindsay-Russel Crouse book that turned the successful stage musical into an overwhelming cinematic experience . Rarely in Hollywood do screenwriters ( even top-flight screenwriters ) get public credit , let alone the respect , they deserve , which makes listening to and reading about the screenplay ' s evolution so fascinating . Lehman , in fact , became involved in the translation of stage musical to film musical even before Wise , who came onto the project after director William Wyler -- who was never that enthusiastic about it -- bowed_out . Lehman not only suggested the elimination of two songs , but also the addition of two others ( &quot; I Have Confidence , &quot; &quot; Something Good &quot; ) that an eager Richard Rodgers wrote expressly for the film , after the death of his collaborator Oscar Hammerstein II . The screenwriter also suggested that several songs be placed elsewhere in the film than they were in the stage play , contributing significantly to the power of the narrative line . &quot; My whole thrust , my whole direction toward the film was primarily the screenplay itself and my knowledge of the stage show before it , &quot; Wise says . Any liberties taken with the story of the novice Maria and the Von Trapp family came_about in the interest not of &quot; telling an untruth &quot; but of developing &quot; a more effective and dramatic line. &quot; The details of how that was done , including the overwhelming cinematography and problems on location in bitter-cold Austria , during alternating three days of rain and three days of sunshine , make_for a wonderful laser disc , put_together with care and attention .
