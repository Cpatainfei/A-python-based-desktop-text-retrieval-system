   <TEXT> Shame on Tommy . If alcohol and drug_addiction is a weakness , Lasorda is the epitome of wisdom and decorum . Surely , he knows better . As a life-long professional in a field littered with careers splintered by drug and alcohol_abuse , the Dodger manager has consistently been exposed to the facts of addictive disease and is far more knowledgeable_about it than the average person . His anger at Darryl Strawberry ' s relapse and his apparent feelings of betrayal are understandable . But the irresponsibility of his public comments is not . As a highly visible leader in the megaworld of professional athletics , Lasorda should limit his ex cathedra pronouncements to baseball and leave the definition of alcohol and drug_addiction to the medical experts . That drug / alcohol_addiction is a disease is unquestioned in the field of medicine . The American Medical Assn . so classified it many years ago , and addiction treatment and therapy is a well-accepted medical specialty . In addition , genetic and neurological research have proved that certain types of alcoholism are inherited . The sad facts , however , are these : The disease has a painfully high relapse rate ; most people who have it die from it , and there is no cure , only remission . If Lasorda is frustrated by this reality , imagine how Strawberry and his family feel . Why didn ' t Lasorda just come_out and say what is probably true -- that Strawberry broke his heart ? Alcoholics and addicts hold the world ' s record for breaking hearts -- but not out of immorality , lack of character or stupidity . Question : Will an active addict deny that he is using ? Answer : Is the Pope Catholic ? The symptom of denial is commonplace . It ' s simply untrue that Dodger leaders couldn ' t directly confront Strawberry with their suspicions that he had relapsed . Based on their comments in the press , they had documented proof of unprofessional conduct , with unacceptable excuses . Given that , and Strawberry ' s acknowledgment of his disease and prior treatment , the Dodgers were_well within their legal_rights to take more aggressive steps . Indeed , it could be argued that the facts required them to intervene . Interventions are an accepted and effective process for confronting the sick_person , most often involving family members , close colleagues from work and a good friend or two . The goal of an intervention is to block all_the psychological exits , leaving the addict with no excuses or viable rationalizations for his behavior . The critical success factor is consensus on the consequences of refusing treatment and the commitment of all involved to follow_through on them . While interventions often fail , most successful ones have a consequence that is work-related . Experience teaches that the typical alcoholic / addict in the throes of disease may well choose the loss of family over the loss of alcohol and drugs , but far fewer choose their drug of choice over their jobs . Sobriety is a life-long challenge met one day at a time . Darryl Strawberry has an extremely hard road ahead , made immeasurably more difficult by his celebrity and visibility . There are lots of us out here , trudging that same hard road . Hang_in there , Darryl .</TEXT>
