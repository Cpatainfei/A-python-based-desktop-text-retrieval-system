   <HEADLINE> EUROPE : FIVE YEARS LATER ; ' IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DO THIS IN 2 OR 3 YEARS. ' ; JACQUES DELORS , PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ' S EXECUTIVE COMMISSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I f post-Cold War Europe has a political visionary , it is Jacques Delors , the president of the European Union ' s Executive Commission for the past decade and the man who revived the dream of binding onetime enemy states into an economic and political union . Sitting at a work_table in his airy 14th floor office in Brussels , Delors spoke quietly but forcefully about the region ' s problems and its future with Times correspondent Tyler Marshall : * Question . Before the Berlin Wall opened , you talked_of resolving the German question within a European federation . Germany is now united but what has happened to your vision of a federated Europe ? Did the fall of the Berlin Wall come a decade too soon for the architects of a united Europe ? Answer . The federalist approach remains the best way . . . ( but ) the main problem is a question of goals . For me , the responsibility of my generation is to extend the values of peace , tolerance , mutual recognition and cooperation to all European_countries . It ' s the only way to avoid many Bosnian wars in the future . These are the same goals that drove the fathers of a united Europe . It ' s a priority to me , because if Europe ' s identity exists -- and it does exist as strongly in Prague , Budapest and Warsaw as in London , Paris or Berlin -- then the fall of communism implies a new approach to the geographic and political limits of the EU . It ' s not possible to achieve this in two or three years because the economic_conditions are not the same in eastern and western Europe . We just have to accept that reality . * Q . Eastern European democracies are still very new . Some do not have strong democratic traditions . Isn ' t that a danger to the united Europe ? A . Yes , because for more_than 40 years , the Communist regimes tried to stifle the development of the individual , his initiative and his spirit . We must rebuild this spirit . This is the reason why European_countries face not only economic problems but also psychological ones . As citizens of Western Europe , we must understand that and be patient . It is not possible to do this in two or three years . However , if I assess the situation in many East European_countries right now , I ' m confident . But please , we need time ! They need time . * Q . How much time ? Two generations , three generations ? A . One generation . Twenty years to adjust to democracy . But do not forget that Western democracies must think_about the quality of_their_own political life . They must reinforce the feeling of responsibility of each citizen . If people remain too individualistic , too indifferent to public life , it is impossible to make progress in the democratization of European Union . * Q . There has been criticism in Central and Eastern Europe that the EU nations have not done enough to help them . How do you react to this ? A . Through our loans and loans from the European Investment Bank , we have matched the efforts of the IMF ( International Monetary Fund ) and the World_Bank . We have also opened our markets . Imports into the EU in 1993 were twice that of 1989 . From my personal point_of_view , we have ended with stage one of our relation with Eastern European_countries -- the emergency support . For me stage two . . . means a more sophisticated form of help , notably through common infrastructure , creation of financial markets in those countries , financing of private investments and helping with a very difficult restructuring of agriculture . To succeed , we must combine these steps with a greater opening of our markets . . . . This is not easy but the concession we make today will be a benefit for all tomorrow , in increasing the level of exchange and also in opening your ( American ) market for our economy . * Q . As you look_back over the five years since the Berlin Wall fell , what concerns you most about the future of Europe ? A . I have two worries . First , the risk of economic decline of all Europe vis-a-vis the United States , Japan , China , Asian_countries and so on . Without a strong economic position , it is going_to be impossible for Europe to maintain its distinctiveness and its influence in the world . This is clear . My second worry is how people accept the present trend toward a more fragmented society with the phenomena of social exclusion and unemployment . . . . These ( worries ) are not directly linked with the future of the construction of Europe , but they are fundamental points . The discussion of the future of Europe is not only one about which country is capable of joining the EU .</TEXT>
