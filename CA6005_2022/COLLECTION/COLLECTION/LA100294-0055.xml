   <HEADLINE> WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; MICHAEL ZASLOW STIRS THE PLOT ON ' GUIDING LIGHT ' AND HOPES FOR MORE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For actor Michael Zaslow , the secret to playing a successful soap villain used to be &quot; leaving every so often , either dying or being sent_off in disgrace. &quot; As Roger Thorpe on CBS ' daytime drama &quot; Guiding Light , &quot; Zaslow has done both -- taking two sabbaticals from the role he has played for more_than 20 years and coming_back stronger ( and meaner ) and more compelling each time . His most recent return to the show , in 1989 , resulted in a series of dynamic story lines that made Thorpe the focus and earned him three nominations for the best actor Daytime Emmy . He won the prize last May in a moment he clearly relished but doesn ' t expect to pave the way to future riches . &quot; It doesn ' t hurt that I got ( the Emmy ) , but if somebody calls and asks about my interest in a movie or a TV movie , is it because I won the Emmy ? &quot; Zaslow wonders over lunch at the Central_Park Boathouse cafe . &quot; I don ' t know , because I ' ve been around for 25 years and I show no signs of quitting , so they say , ' Well if he ' s gonna be in our faces ... ' &quot; Zaslow trails off with some hearty laughter but his background bears_out his belief that &quot; a career is largely a result of tenacity , perseverance , talent and luck , perhaps with luck rated at the top of that list. &quot; In his early days , Zaslow acknowledges he was a theater snob . &quot; Television was an accident to me , &quot; he says . &quot; I was a serious artiste . I didn ' t want to be a star in that sense. &quot; On this sweltering summer day , the 51-year-old actor could not look less like his devious TV character . He ' s traded Thorpe ' s double-breasted Armani armor for green shorts and a green embroidered Central_Park T-shirt . His trusty , 20-year-old Motobecane bicycle is locked_up outside . Like Roger , Zaslow ' s career is_full of surprises . His early days acting were spent on the West Coast , in musicals , both as a baritone with the Los Angeles Civic Light_Opera and the USO ( he toured Asia playing opposite Bonnie Franklin in &quot; Carousel &quot; ) . The Inglewood , Calif. , native , who graduated UCLA with a degree in political_science , did his share of episodic television before tackling Broadway . There , in 1971 , he starred as Perchik in &quot; Fiddler on the Roof , &quot; where he met his wife Susan Hufford , whose career is as diverse as his own . Once a singer-actress , she ' s now a psychotherapist . The couple have adopted two Korean girls , Marika , 11 , and Helena , 8 . &quot; I would never have been able to stay_on a show -- I ' m in my sixth year now -- before children , &quot; he confesses . Another strong reason for doing daytime cropped_up three years ago when Zaslow and National Endowment for the Arts chairperson Jane Alexander , among others , were embezzled by their business manager -- &quot; Everything we ' d ever saved. &quot; While his business manager serves a jail sentence , Zaslow has to pay_back taxes to the government for returns he and his wife thought were filed but never were . While Zaslow has no &quot; aching &quot; ambition &quot; to be_on a prime-time series at all , &quot; he and pal Ed Sherin ( Alexander ' s husband and producer of &quot; Law &amp; Order &quot; ) have discussed possible roles for him on the New York-based prime-time show . ( &quot; I was considered for about a minute and a half for Michael Moriarty ' s replacement , &quot; Zaslow reveals with a smile. ) What he really wants to do , though , is get_back to the theater . Emmy Award notwithstanding , the stage is where Zaslow had what he expects will be the most &quot; magic &quot; moment of his career : the night he took_over -- on three hours ' notice -- for an ailing Keir Dullea in the 1974 Broadway revival of &quot; Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , &quot; opposite Elizabeth Ashley . &quot; When I came_out for my curtain_call , right before Liz , the audience stood_up and started going_to town . Then she came_out after me applauding and separated the whole cast , just left me and my crutch and my vulnerability , center stage looking_out there. &quot; Moments like that are rare in any career . Until another one occurs , Michael Zaslow will have to be satisfied with his Emmy -- more_than television ' s equivalent of a standing_ovation . &quot; Guiding Light &quot; airs weekdays at 2 p.m. on CBS .</TEXT>
