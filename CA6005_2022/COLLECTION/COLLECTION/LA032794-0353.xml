   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; IRVINE CO . QUIETLY BIDES ITS TIME IN BASE PLAN DEBATE ; CONVERSION : REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME , THE COMPANY , WITH ABOUT 4 # 000 ACRES NEAR EL TORO , STANDS TO BENEFIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In all_the rhetoric that has consumed planning for the afterlife of El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station , including the promise of big profits from development there , the voice of one corporate giant has been noticeably silent : the Irvine Co . By far the largest owner of undeveloped property ringing the air_station , officials with the real_estate giant have neither been stalking supervisors at the Hall of Administration nor have they taken sides in the roiling debate over whether a new commercial airport should be in El Toro ' s future . &quot; I haven ' t seen them anywhere , &quot; said Supervisor William G . Steiner , whose county office has served as home to an &quot; El Toro encounter_group &quot; in recent months for various interests , from the Lincoln Club , one of Orange County ' s most politically powerful groups , to Leisure World , the senior_citizen community in Laguna Hills . The company ' s public silence has taken_on an element of political intrigue all its own in some quarters , yet differs little from the reclusive personality of Donald Bren , whose Irvine Co . controls more_than 60 # 000 acres in Orange County . Company officials say that about 4 # 000 of those acres are in the immediate area of the base . The company has maintained its neutral stance even as leaders of the Lincoln Club have filed an initiative seeking approval of a commercial airport through a vote of the people . At the same time , government officials in South County -- where the Irvine Co . is a dominant force -- have adamantly opposed an airport at El Toro , fearing increased noise and traffic to the area . &quot; You don ' t get that kind of money by sitting pretty for long , &quot; Supervisor Thomas F . Riley said . &quot; Donald Bren is a pretty smart person . They are going_out to see what ' s best for the Irvine Co . . . . we ' ll hear from them. &quot; But the right time , company officials say , has not yet arrived . Irvine Co . Vice_President Monica Florian said the issue has been particularly vexing and presents possible development limitations for the company , whether or not the base becomes a new airport . &quot; All of the different possible uses for the base have different implications . There is a big new universe there , &quot; Florian said . Said company Vice_President Larry Thomas : &quot; There are very complex questions that are not easily answered . Unless you do the studies , there is no simple way to assign whether one kind of development will be good or bad . &quot; If you have an airport , what does_it mean ? &quot; Thomas said . &quot; Does that preclude other uses ? If it does , does that mean the land becomes less valuable ? I guess it depends_on how the officials draw the maps. &quot; For years , Florian said , the company maps have always been drawn_on the basis that El Toro would continue to operate as a military base . &quot; We have decades of planning agreements with the Marines and the ( adjacent ) city of Irvine that reflect that , &quot; she said . Rather than participate in a potentially divisive airport initiative or join the vanguard of South County cities in their vocal opposition to an airport , Florian and Thomas said the company intends to allow the newly created El Toro Planning and Reuse Authority to commission studies of possible new developments for the base before taking a position . &quot; The initiative may be a way to expedite the gathering of information from the community , &quot; Florian said , &quot; but from personal experience it ' s not the kind of atmosphere that can necessarily get good information. &quot; Florian said she shares the frustration of the local business_community with the months it has taken_to create the authority and begin planning , but the company has committed to participating as one of 50 members of the authority ' s executive advisory council . &quot; I think there is a frustration on everybody ' s part on how to crystallize the decision-making process , &quot; she said . For various reasons , chief among them being the maintenance of political_relations with South County cities , Irvine City Councilman Barry J . Hammond said the Irvine Co . would gain little by taking a strident position . &quot; They ' ve definitely been the sleeping giant in this thing , &quot; said Hammond , one of the city ' s delegates to the authority ' s nine-member governing board . &quot; I know they are going_to keep a very close eye on what ' s going_on , but I don ' t think it would be politically wise for them to get involved now . &quot; There is no need for them to take a position that would alienate some ( government ) officials who may have to vote on their future projects , &quot; he said . Hammond said that company officials would likely allow the planning process to run its course since the Irvine Co. ' s status as the area ' s largest landholder leaves them in a virtual no-lose position for most any future base development . Wayne Wedin , chairman-elect of the Orange County Chamber_of_Commerce , said the company ' s current neutral position is reflective of a methodical and very &quot; process-oriented &quot; approach , not particularly unlike the company ' s corporate personality . &quot; All I can tell you is that Monica ( Florian ) has been very supportive of the authority and the established process , &quot; Wedin said , &quot; but I don ' t know what Don Bren or ( Irvine Co . Executive_Vice_President ) Gary Hunt might be thinking . &quot; Maybe the smartest thing for them to do is not to be too far out front on this thing and not get sucked into the fray too soon , &quot; he said . &quot; They ' ve got_to be very careful. &quot; Nonetheless , the company ' s enormous real_estate holdings and presence in the community have been difficult to ignore as the fractious debate has raged on . And there are some who believe the company could ultimately serve as a &quot; peacemaker &quot; when more specific and controversial land-use proposals are floated . &quot; They are going_to have to do_it in a way that won ' t alienate the South County cities , &quot; said Anil Puri , co-director of Cal State Fullerton ' s Institute for Economic and Environmental Studies . &quot; But at_the_same_time , they are going_to have to do_it in a way that promotes long-term growth. &quot; For now , Puri said , the Irvine Co. ' s silence should be a relief for local politicians , especially members of the Board of Supervisors , who now find themselves juggling the interests of a divided county . &quot; The Irvine Co . might be doing the supervisors a favor by not coming_to them now , &quot; Puri said . &quot; I certainly would not want the biggest developer in the land coming_to tell me what they want on top of everything else that ' s been happening. &quot; Until the studies are complete , Florian and Thomas said there are few facts to discuss . While some may advocate plans for a commercial airport , Florian said little is known about &quot; what kind of an airport . What kind of planes will fly in and out ? What regulations will there be ? There are not answers to those questions yet . &quot; As the process moves forward , there will be something more tangible to talk_about , &quot; she said . &quot; We are not afraid to engage community groups on matters of policy. &quot;</TEXT>
