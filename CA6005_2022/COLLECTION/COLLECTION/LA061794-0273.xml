   <HEADLINE> STRONG YEN REDUCES THE SIZE OF JAPAN ' S TRADE IMBALANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japan ' s trade surplus fell_in May , snapping a five-month upward trend , as the strong yen curtailed growth in exports , the government and economists said Thursday . The surplus fell to an unadjusted $ 6.54 billion from $ 7.78 billion a year earlier , the Finance Ministry said . The high yen has been helping to dampen exports by boosting the price of Japanese goods overseas , thereby making them less competitive , economists said . But a great shrinkage in the surplus is highly unlikely this year even though the up trend should peak , said Soichi Enkyo , economist at Bank of Tokyo Ltd . &quot; This year the surplus is likely to remain around the same level , &quot; he said . The surplus was far below the average forecast by economists earlier this week . They predicted a surplus of $ 7.1 billion for May . In April , the trade surplus climbed to $ 11.12 billion from $ 10.29 billion a year earlier . But the surplus with the United States , which has been most critical of Japan ' s trade imbalances , climbed to $ 3.04 billion in May from $ 2.83 billion a year earlier .</TEXT>
