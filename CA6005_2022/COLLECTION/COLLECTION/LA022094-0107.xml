   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; TO THE GOP ' S DISMAY , THE REAL CLINTON EMERGES -- AS A NON-IDEOLOGICAL BLUR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The recent change in Bill_Clinton ' s political fortunes represents : a ) gains from his new sounding-like-a-Republican crime , welfare and budget policies ; b ) losses in Febru ary poll ratings after further developments in Whitewater and other Arkansas-related scandals ; c ) favorable public reaction to better news on the economy ; d ) uncertainty about his get-tough tack with Japan , or e ) all_the above ? The best answer is &quot; e ) all_the above &quot; -- and it ' s a confusing set of crosscurrents . Today ' s reality is that Clinton is both weaker and stronger than he appears , and the politics of 1994 -- and perhaps also 1996 -- will be confused accordingly . The notion of Clinton as a blurry , non-ideological centrist is gaining_ground -- with good reason . Talk that he now sounds like a Republican on issues like welfare reform and crime is an exaggeration voiced most easily by liberals who know few Republicans . But his crime policies -- from lifetime incarcera- tion for three-time violent felons to advocacy of 100 # 000 added policemen -- do represent a significant shift for a Democratic President . Whatever Clinton sounds like -- committed centrist or talented opportunist -- what he no longer sounds like is clear : the type of liberal Democrat who Americans started getting tired_of in the 1960s and ' 70s . That is the great benefit for Clinton-era Democrats . They are free to take middle-of-the-road , even moderately conservative positions on crime , federal spending_cuts and welfare reform . This is tough for the GOP , because Democrats have stopped being a liberal-caricature opposition and started taking reasonable positions on issues the GOP used to dominate . The result is that Republicans , who started losing domestic- and economic-policy credibility during the Bush years , in January actually found themselves trailing the Democrats as the better party to handle crime , welfare reform and reducing the budget_deficit . Health-care reform , meanwhile , has become an unexpected yellow_light for the Democrats . True , they have a large lead in the polls as the better party to deal with health-care reform , but that is in the abstract . The actual Clinton health plan , designed back in the 1993 period of Hillary and Bill_Clinton ' s ambitions for a bigger role of government , has been losing support . When first announced last fall , national polls showed Clinton ' s program had a lopsided 65 % support to 25 % opposition . But by early 1994 , as doubt about its bureaucracy and costs grew , pollsters found a standoff : Supporters and opponents more or less balanced each other , and the all-important middle_class was tilting toward disapproval . In short , health reform , which Democrats had counted as their high-scoring issue , was turning_out not to be . Swing voters were beginning to think the Clinton program was too ambitious , that it raised as_many problems as it answered . Assuming that Clinton and Congress produce a compromise health-care package this year , the President should still profit . But even this proposal must be qualified by the evidence of a new global political reality . Many welfare_states that expanded in the 1970s and even the 1980s -- Britain , Canada , Scandinavia and Germany , for example -- are now retrenching . Too many people are finding services reduced or new charges imposed -- or both . Fewer governments are finding health coverage a winning issue , and the Clinton White_House may ultimately count itself in this group . The other big question_mark with an increasingly negative tilt for the President is his collection of alleged Arkansas scandals -- ranging from the Madison Guaranty-Whitewater land deal to the charges of sexual misconduct made by two Arkansas state_troopers . Several women have come_forward to confirm the troopers ' account , and Whitewater special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr . has taken_office space in Little_Rock on a lease that runs_through January , 1997 . Republicans are excited at the prospect that both these issues -- and , with them , Clinton ' s ethics and alleged untrustworthiness -- could be major undertows working against him in the 1996 race . This could be important , because when Iran-Contra charges echoed against George_Bush in the last_days of the 1992 campaign , they cut_short a Bush resurgence . Republicans may have the same thing in mind for Clinton in 1996 . They are certainly going_to need all_the help they can get . Not only has Clinton ' s move to the center preempted several once-Republican themes , but also the GOP has a number of other emerging weaknesses . First , like many parties out of power after a long period of rule , it doesn ' t have much of an agenda . Second , the GOP could gain enough seats in Congress in November ' s elections to get blamed for what could be 1995-96 gridlock . Meanwhile , strains between their leaders -- Bob Dole of Kansas in the Senate , Newt Gingrich of Georgia in the House -- could add_to the problem . Finally , there ' s the lack of any strong GOP presidential nominee for 1996 , coupled with significant ideological splits in the party and the possibility of a second independent presidential bid by Ross Perot . These GOP weaknesses -- all hard to correct -- count as pluses for Clinton . But at_the_same_time , any assessment of the President ' s circumstances must take several points into account . His job ratings , which hit 60 % last month , have dropped into the mid-to-low 50s , and one recent Newsweek poll had him slipping to 49 % . The public remains standoffish toward Clinton , and , in the next three years , two issues now relatively quiet -- the economy and the perils of U.S. foreign_policy -- are likely to come_to_the_fore . Right now , both are &quot; X factors. &quot; There ' s no doubt that the improving economy has been a boon to Clinton , helping to pull his ratings up from the high 30s in some polls and the low 40s in others . Too many people forget , though , that a similar economic surge in late 1992 raised Bush ' s ratings from the high 30s on Election_Day in November to the mid-50s in January as he prepared to retire . Part of Clinton ' s gain over the last three months could be just as shallow -- especially if the economy starts to sag again . That is a possibility no Democrat strategist can ignore . But in a_few weeks , believe it or not , our current economic recovery -- it officially started back in March , 1991 -- will be entering its fourth year . In other words , we may_not be looking_at economic or cyclical springtime ; because the typical postwar business_cycle has lasted 3 1 / 2 to 5 years , we could now be looking_at some pleasant autumn economic weather , with a possible winter chill not too far off . Moreover , there are some specific cautions to keep_in mind . Experts worry that the huge amount_of_money put into mutual_funds over the last few years has created a stock-market bubble , while others are now concerned that the possibility of a trade war between the United States and Japan could wind_up damaging the international financial structure . The second &quot; X factor &quot; that should haunt the Democrats is the unpredictability of international affairs and the possibility of some debacle linked to America ' s declining power to control overseas events . Democrats have particular reason to be nervous , because three of the last four Democratic Presidents left_office in disrepute partly because of a failure to effectively apply U.S. military power : Harry S . Truman because of the Korea War , Lyndon B . Johnson because of Vietnam and Jimmy_Carter because of the botched Iranian hostage crisis . In short , this President may_not be in as good_shape as_many think because of the extraordinary economic , moral and international crosscurrents at_work . Sometimes , it ' s not even enough to be blessed with a second-rate opposition. *</TEXT>
