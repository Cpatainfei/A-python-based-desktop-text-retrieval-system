   <HEADLINE> ITALIAN RIGHTIST STEPS ON MINE CALLED MUSSOLINI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just as Easter reflection brought momentary respite to the tumult of Italy ' s born-again political_system , Gianfranco Fini stepped_on an old mine named Mussolini . In context , fresh fireworks and deepening uncertainty Saturday were hardly surprising after the most revolutionary political week in Italy for decades . Corruption-weary voters abruptly transferred power to an untried alliance of right-wing parties that have a mandate but no cohesion , reformist ideas but no common program . The search for a new government will quicken at inter-party negotiations this week , but there are still many doors to slam , many arias to sing . In the wings are national anxiety and potential unrest among left-leaning labor_unions unhappy with the election results . This was signaled by a wave of strikes Saturday by restaurant and hotel workers as 20 million Italians and hordes of foreign tourists headed for Easter weekend celebrations . Still , it is startling that the first victim-in-victory should be the articulate and telegenic Fini , leader of Italy ' s resurgent neo-fascists . At 42 , he is by far the most polished politician in the power-bound triumvirate that also includes brittle billionaire Silvio Berlusconi and abrasive regionalist Umberto Bossi . Speaking in a post-election interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa , Fini paid tribute to former dictator Benito Mussolini , the founder of fascism and a figure not remembered fondly by Americans , their World_War_II allies -- or most Italians . &quot; I would say he was the greatest statesman of the century , &quot; Fini told La Stampa . &quot; Berlusconi would have to pedal hard to show he belongs_to history like Mussolini . Two identical men are not born in a year and not even in a century. &quot; Bad timing . Fini made the same historical judgment of Mussolini publicly in October , 1992 , La Stampa pointed_out Saturday , but that was before last week ' s big-bang elections . Fini was not as prominent then -- and neither was his party claiming a share of power for the first time . * Fini calls his party &quot; post-fascist , &quot; supports Berlusconi for prime_minister and is demanding strong Cabinet representation . He respects Mussolini the man , Fini says , but rejects many of his policies . And he rejects critics who charge that he is the stalking-horse for the rebirth of a disgraced past . &quot; A dozen kids giving the Roman ( fascist ) salute in the Piazza Venezia is not grounds to talk_about a resurgence of fascism , &quot; Fini said . The authoritarian Mussolini -- who took Italy into disastrous war as an ally of Adolf Hitler , imposed racial laws , deported Jews , invaded African_countries in chimerical pursuit of empire , suppressed civil_rights and made the trains run_on time in a corporate state -- was killed by partisans in 1945 , to national applause . The Fascist Party was outlawed after the war . Since becoming their leader in 1987 , though , Fini has transformed Italian neo-fascists from untouchables into respectables . He breathed new life and fresh votes into the Italian Social Movement , which typically got 5 % to 6 % of the national vote , nearly all_of it in the south . In the elections last week that toppled centrists from power for the first time since the war and rejected a leftist alliance ' s bid to replace them , Fini ' s party ran as the National Alliance , a new name aimed at recasting the movement ' s jackboot image . When the votes were counted , neo-fascists had more_than doubled their usual showing , claiming 106 of the right_wing ' s 366 seats in the new 630-member Chamber of Deputies that takes_office April 15 . During the campaign , Fini took pains to portray the alliance as a modern party moving away from yesterday ' s right and toward a new center , and along the way he attracted substantial support from disenchanted former supporters of the scandal-racked centrist Christian Democrats . Thus , Fini ' s eulogistic remarks on Mussolini brought a quick domestic backlash , just as the sight of a_few youths giving the old fascist salute at Fini ' s victory_celebration raised foreign hackles . Praising the old dictator shows Fini &quot; still regards Mussolini as a model for the future . We all know what the state of liberty was in this country when ' the greatest statesman of the century ' was in power , &quot; charged Claudio Petruccioli , a spokesman for the former Italian Communist_Party . The party anchored the defeated leftist coalition and is respected by millions more Italians than vote for it because of its courageous opposition to Mussolini . Fini says his party has no links with the right in France or Germany and disavows skinheads who regularly attend his rallies . He has denounced such Mussolini initiatives as the racial laws that foreshadowed the deportation of Jews to Nazi concentration_camps , calling them &quot; an error that led to a horror. &quot; &quot; When the National Alliance was born ( in January ) we consigned the judgment on fascism and anti-fascism to history . . . . That means looking_to the future without being prisoners of the contradictions of the past , &quot; Fini told La Stampa . In the campaign , the National Alliance called_for stricter controls against immigration , institution of the death_penalty for certain crimes and negotiations to recover Adriatic coastal areas ceded to Yugoslavia in 1947 . It also demands great economic help for the south , a strong central authority and electoral reform to allow direct elections of a president and prime_minister . Both are now chosen by Parliament . As junior partner on the right , Fini has thus far taken a back seat in negotiations for a government between prime minister-wannabe Berlusconi and Bossi , whose Northern League claims 122 seats in the Chamber of Deputies , or lower house . Bossi , who apparently has backed_away from a refusal to participate in any government with neo-fascists , espouses the flip side of many Fini policies . Bossi despises Roman central authority , believes the north is being impoverished to enrich a corrupt south and demands a federalist Italy of three self-governing regions . Fini says his time will come when negotiations resume Wednesday to transform an electoral alliance into a government . &quot; Berlusconi and Bossi know perfectly well nothing can be decided unless all three of us are there , &quot; Fini said .</TEXT>
