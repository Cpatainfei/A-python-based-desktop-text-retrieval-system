   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; CITRON ' S BEST DEFENSE MAY BE HIS WARNINGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In April , 1993 , then-Orange County Treasurer Robert L . Citron warned a county official -- in writing -- of the risks of doing a complicated parlay in Treasury_notes . Citron was advising the Orange County Sanitation District official of the pros and cons of a deal the district had asked him to handle : a reverse-repurchase in which the district would put_up as collateral some of its government_securities in_order to borrow money for further investing . If interest_rates happened to rise , Citron warned , the district might have to put_up millions of dollars to buy back the bond or might have to sell it at_a_loss . That was an accurate warning , as far as it went . But Citron then added : &quot; The likelihood of this happening is minimal. &quot; In fact , by the end of the year , rates began their steepest rise in a quarter of a century , devastating a county investment portfolio filled with transactions of the kind whose dangers Citron had carefully laid_out for the district . Yet from Citron ' s standpoint , the important thing is not the assurances he made that rates would stay low , but the warning he gave of what might happen if they did not . For as prosecutors , regulators , and lawyers begin considering whether the management of the Orange County investment pool warrants civil or even criminal charges , the outlines of Citron ' s legal defense are becoming clear : Not only did all his investments comply with rules laid_down by state legislation , he will contend , but in document after document , including annual statements to the Orange County Board of Supervisors , he made_full disclosure of the risks of his investment strategy . Citron ' s warnings of market risk to participants in the pool are certain to end_up in the center ring of the legal circus that is about to pitch a tent over the pool ' s wreckage . A 10-page questionnaire sent by the Securities and Exchange Commission to the pool ' s 187 municipal investors , for example , focuses_on what and by whom the investors were told about the risk of loss of investment principal , the pool ' s sensitivity to changes in interest_rates , and its strategies . Regulators are also believed to be looking_into whether Citron as treasurer used the proceeds of county bond issues to make cash distributions to pool participants who thought they were receiving interest -- a maneuver to mask a cash crisis in the pool that could become the core of a civil case against officials involved in arranging the bond issue , Citron included . Beyond that , at least 12 civil suits to recover lost money have been filed and scores more are sure to materialize , naming the former county treasurer , his investment_advisers and others as defendants . * Citron ' s management is also being investigated by county , state and federal agencies with the power to bring criminal charges , although none have yet been brought and no evidence of illicit personal enrichment by Citron has surfaced . &quot; Our position is that there were no material omissions &quot; of fact in disclosure statements made to investors in the county pool or buyers of county bonds backed by funds in the pool , said Citron ' s lawyer , David Wiechert , in an interview . Whatever inadequacies appear , he added , should be blamed on the information Citron received from such professional advisers as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. , the investment_firm that underwrote a large amount of the riskiest securities he purchased for the portfolio . &quot; Bob was relying in good_faith on professionals , &quot; Wiechert said . Moreover , he said , the municipal finance officers who were placing their public funds under Citron ' s management in the county pool -- many of them voluntarily -- should have been sufficiently well-versed in market economics to know that the pool ' s above-market yield came packaged with higher risk . &quot; The question that should be asked of the investors is why did they think they were getting 200 basis points ( 2 percentage_points ) or more higher than they would if they invested in 90-day Treasuries ? &quot; Still , lawyers experienced in securities and criminal defense law say that Citron faces a long ordeal in fending off prosecutors and plaintiffs ' lawyers . Orange County ' s collapse into bankruptcy is so spectacular that the entire spectrum of law_enforcement agencies is constrained to at least investigate Citron ' s investment management . &quot; Because he ' s in the middle of a political cyclone , they ' re under enormous political pressure to do something , &quot; said Stanley Arkin , a prominent securities counsel with offices in New York and Los Angeles . Wiechert agrees that the political environment may represent Citron ' s biggest hazard . &quot; Criminal exposure is a possibility because it ' s not difficult to get an indictment , &quot; he said . But obtaining a conviction would be much harder because it would require &quot; proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Bob Citron intended to defraud investors , &quot; and no evidence of that has appeared . The chance of civil charges is greater because the standard of proof is lower than in criminal proceedings and the cases might revolve_around the murky issue of what facts Citron was required to disclose to his investors and which of his statements they relied_upon when deciding to place their funds in his care . Case_law is far from clear on how much information public officials must disclose when they invest money or borrow it in the bond market . In fact , as Wiechert suggests , Citron in his public statements generally did note that his investment strategy carried higher risks than normal for a public fund . But documents show he usually counterweighted such statements with wishful , if not willful , expressions of market opinion that would turn_out to be misguided . In a September 10 , 1993 , report to the pool investors , for instance , he wrote that the pool ' s high yield was produced by reverse repurchase agreements and &quot; inverse floaters &quot; -- securities designed to produce a higher yield when market interest_rates remain low or decline . &quot; If rates were to rise materially , it is reasonable to expect that the overall performance of the portfolio would decline , &quot; he wrote . Furthermore , he said he had stopped buying inverse floaters over the previous six months precisely to hedge against the possibility of higher rates . But he then assured his investors : &quot; Interest_rates could rise 100 basis points ( 1 % ) tomorrow , because of some temporary phenomena happening in the world . But higher interest_rates are not at all sustainable. &quot; As it happened , rates rose more_than 2 percentage_points in the year following his prognostication and remained stubbornly high throughout 1994 . Moreover , he did not stay out of the inverse-floater market for long . Beginning in January and February , 1994 -- just before the Federal_Reserve_Board signaled its determination to push rates up with three quarter-point rate hikes in three months -- Citron bought hundreds of million of dollars in such exotic securities , all_of which have since been heavily discounted in value . Some were so complex that they resembled the creation of alchemists . The interest payout of a $ 25-million purchase on Jan . 10 , for instance , was based on the interrelationship of trading in German marks , Italian_lira , Swedish_krona and British_pounds . ( It was a bad bet : Between the purchase date and the end of 1994 , the payout dropped_by half , to 2.31 % from 4.72 % . ) Citron also overstated to investors his ability to unwind his complicated transactions once market conditions rendered them unprofitable . &quot; The Orange County treasury currently has over $ 900 million ( in ) securities reversed against themselves , &quot; he told the sanitation district in April , 1993 , &quot; so we are_well versed in monitoring this kind of investment. &quot; However , the reverse transactions could not be unwound without producing a loss when rates headed_up . Yet securities and defense_lawyers note that Citron may be able to defend his own judgment by showing that he had plenty of company among the nation ' s biggest and most sophisticated investors in suffering derivatives-based losses in 1994 . Such well-known Wall_Street names as George Soros and Michael Steinhardt suffered enormous losses from leveraged wrong-way bets_on interest_rates this year . * He could also plead that the securities he bought were issued by agencies sponsored by the federal_government -- as such they were safe to the extent that their risk of default was almost nil , although the way Citron invested magnified their exposure to adverse changes in rates . Citron may also contend that he was simply not responsible_for the investment fund ' s estimated $ 2.02-billion loss . Although some analysts say the paper losses were becoming so great that a cash crunch would eventually have forced Citron to sell some holdings at_a_loss , &quot; the question is to what extent does he avoid exposure , because the damages were really created by the precipitate selloff ( by his successors ) and not holding to maturity , &quot; said one Washington-based securities lawyer who asked not to be identified . Others say that Citron might successfully deflect civil liability onto other defendants , such_as his professional advisers -- investment_firms that have much deeper pockets for plaintiffs to mine . As Arkin put it , &quot; Going_after Merrill Lynch is going_to be one of the great games in town. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Citron ' s Disclosures Former Orange County Treasurer Robert L . Citron maintains that he made adequate disclosures about the nature and risks of his strategy in managing the county ' s now bankrupt investment pool . The following are examples of what he said--and what actually occurred . * From an Apr . 12 , 1993 , letter to the Orange County Sanitation Districts ( which wanted to purchase $ 50 million in reverse repurchase agreements ) : ( text of graphic : ) The negative side of this transaction is that if interest_rates rise , it is possible not to have a &quot; positive carry. &quot; Where the bid or the interest_rate paid_for borrowing the money would be more_than the coupon on the treasury_note . In this event the District would need to come_up with $ 50 million to buy outright these securities , or what would likely happen is to sell them at a price that is lower than originally paid_for the securities . A principal loss would occur . The likelihood of this happening is minimal ; particularly if the investment is closely monitored . If interest_rates start rising the security could be sold and / or swapped for a like security with a higher coupon . The Orange County Treasury currently has over $ 900 million securities reversed against themselves , so we are_well versed in monitoring this type of investment . WHAT HAPPENED What Citron termed an unlikely scenario is exactly what occurred . Rising rates reduced the value of the collateral he put_up for loans in the county ' s investment portfolio , eventually forcing the county to take losses and spurring its bankruptcy filing . * From a Sept . 10 , 1993 , annual report to the county Board of Supervisors : ( text of graphic : ) If rates were to rise materially , it is reasonable to expect that the overall performance of the portfolio would decline . Athough we strongly believe that future interest_rates will remain low , to insure against the eventuality of materially rising interest_rates , for the last six months we have not been buying structured / floating interest_rate instruments but have been purchasing fixed interest_rate coupon instruments . WHAT HAPPENED Rates would not remain low indefinitely . In fact , they began rising two months later . Moreover , Citron again started buying structured notes in January , 1994 , as the rise picked_up steam .</TEXT>
