   <HEADLINE> RIVAL ' S GUARD , 2ND MAN HELD IN SKATER ' S ATTACK ; CRIME : CONSPIRACY CHARGED IN INJURY TO KERRIGAN . NO WARRANT ISSUED FOR TONYA HARDING , OFFICIALS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> National figure_skating champion Tonya Harding ' s bodyguard and another man were arrested Thursday in Portland , Ore. , and charged with conspiracy in the attack on Olympic rival Nancy Kerrigan . Shawn Eric Eckardt , 26 , the bodyguard , and Derrick Brian Smith , 29 , were arrested and held_on $ 20 # 000 bail . But the two arrests were not expected to close the case of one of the more bizarre attacks on a sports figure . An official of the Multnomah County Sheriff ' s Department said more arrests were pending . Police sources said Eckardt has told authorities that Harding ' s former husband , Jeff Gillooly , asked him to arrange last week ' s attack on Kerrigan at the U.S. Figure_Skating Championships in Detroit . Authorities said Thursday that no arrest_warrant was issued for Harding , who has denied any involvement in the attack . Smith , a former Portland resident , moved to Phoenix about five months ago , a prosecutor said . Authorities did not explain what role Smith played in the alleged plot but Fox News_reported that Smith was the getaway driver after the attack . Eckardt , in handcuffs , was brought_to the Portland jail in an unmarked car . He did not answer reporters ' shouted questions . Smith followed half an hour later , also handcuffed . ABC News_reported that a Portland man , identified as Shane Stant , was suspected of being Kerrigan ' s attacker at Detroit ' s Cobo Arena . The assailant escaped after hitting Kerrigan with a metal baton above her right knee as she left a practice_session . Kerrigan had to withdraw from the figure-skating championships . Harding , 23 , then won the championship and was named to the U.S. Olympic team . The other Olympic spot normally would have gone_to the second-place finisher , Michelle Kwan , 13 , of Torrance , but the U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . named Kerrigan to the team , presuming that she is able to compete in the Winter_Olympics next month in Lillehammer , Norway . On Thursday , doctors in Boston said Kerrigan ' s injured right knee showed improvement after two days of physical_therapy . She has refused to comment on the police_investigation , but her father , Daniel Kerrigan , said the attention would not affect her Olympic performance . Kerrigan ' s agent , Jerry Solomon , told &quot; Larry King Live &quot; on CNN : &quot; She ' s doing great . . . . She ' s in the pool everyday . She ' s doing hydrotherapy . Her range of motion in her knee is almost back to full range of motion . &quot; There is every reason to believe she ' ll be OK for the Olympics physically . As far as the emotional and mental side , I know she ' ll be OK that way because she is very strong and she ' s mentally tough and she ' s a great fighter , &quot; Solomon said . Kerrigan won a bronze medal at the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville , France . * The investigation into the attack on Kerrigan has taken local police and the FBI to four states and spawned a cottage industry of rumors and falsehoods . When Harding ' s name surfaced this week in connection with the incident , she called the allegations ludicrous . &quot; You guys know me better than that , &quot; Harding said . &quot; I had my hopes for a long_time of competing against Nancy and proving I ' m as_good_as her and better. &quot; But within a_few days , stories implicating Harding ' s former husband and her bodyguard surfaced . Harding and Gillooly were divorced Aug . 28 , but reconciled and have lived together since October . Neither Harding nor Gillooly were seen publicly Thursday . They have not been at their Portland home since Tuesday , authorities said . One of the first breaks_in the case came Saturday when a woman from out of state called the Detroit Police_Department , insisting on talking to Deputy Police_Chief Benny Napoleon . At a news_conference Thursday , Napoleon said the woman told him that she had heard a taped conversation regarding the planned attack on Kerrigan several months ago . He said the woman identified four people and he gave the names to the FBI . The plot allegedly involved Eckardt , Gillooly , an Eckardt acquaintance in Phoenix and a Portland man who attacked Kerrigan for $ 100 # 000 . * Meanwhile , in Portland , a private_investigator , Gary Crowe , said the FBI learned of the alleged plot from a local minister , Eugene C . Saunders . Crowe said Saunders came_to him for advice after speaking with a friend who played him a tape_recording of men alleged to be Gillooly , Eckardt and the unidentified Arizona man discussing Kerrigan . Saunders , 24 , was a classmate of Eckardt at Pioneer Pacific College in Wilsonville , Ore . Another student taking the paralegal course , Russell Reitz , told authorities that Eckardt asked him last week if he would be willing to kill someone for $ 65 # 000 . &quot; I told him I would n ' t and then he asked me if I would break somebody ' s legs for $ 65 # 000 , &quot; Reitz said Thursday . Reitz refused , and went_to the FBI . Detroit police believe that they have the weapon , a collapsible metal baton , that was used to attack Kerrigan . A resident found it in a trash_can behind the arena that was used for practice . Harvey Schiller , executive_director of the U.S. Olympic Committee , said Harding ' s participation in the Olympics would not be affected by the attack on Kerrigan because &quot; there ' s no indication that Tonya ' s involved at all. &quot; The U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . in Colorado Springs issued a statement saying it would not comment on speculation about the investigation . Eckardt and Smith face_up to 10 years in prison and a $ 100 # 000 fine if convicted on the conspiracy charge . Times staff writer Ronald J . Ostrow contributed to this story . * HARDING PROFILE : Figure skater Tonya Harding has been surrounded by controversy for years . C1</TEXT>
