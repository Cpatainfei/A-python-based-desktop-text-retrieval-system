   <HEADLINE> CELLULAR PHONE SCAM GOES BY THE NUMBERS ; PROTECTIVE MEASURES CAN WARD OFF CLONING ' S PERPETRATORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So , you would love to enjoy the convenience and the security of having a cellular_phone , but find the costs somewhat burdensome or prohibitive . Well , talk loudly and often enough about it and someone just might surface who will offer you a deal that seems too good to pass_up . Take our advice , and pass . It happened recently to a busy young_woman who is working her way through college . She wasn ' t suspicious when the two fellows who sold her the telephone kept forgetting to give her the unit ' s telephone_number and told her she shouldn ' t give it to anyone anyway . ( &quot; Too many people will call you and it will get expensive , &quot; they said. ) She wasn ' t suspicious about the low-cost payment arrangement , in which she just paid the guys and never received a bill in the mail . She wasn ' t even suspicious when the telephone repeatedly failed to function after only a_few days of use . She just took it back to the guys , who fiddled_with it and made_it work again . . . for a_few days . This otherwise intelligent woman was an unwitting participant in the $ 300-million-a-year cellular_telephone fraud crime_wave . This particular gambit is known as &quot; repeat business. &quot; The dupe is sold a cell phone that was either stolen or bought_at a discount . The telephone has been programmed with an Electronic Serial Number ( ESN ) already owned by a legitimate cellular_phone user . That , as Times reporters Chip Johnson and Adam S . Bauman point_out , makes the illegal unit a &quot; clone phone. &quot; She was never given a number for her unit because the legitimate owners of the number would be receiving her return calls . She never received a bill for her calls_for the same reason . The phone_service on her unit was repeatedly interrupted after a_few days because the legitimate owners were getting the bill , reporting the fraud , and getting new telephone_numbers . Those of you who have received huge cellular_phone bills filled with calls you never made know what we mean . When she took the unit back to the sellers , they kept putting someone else ' s ESN on it -- maybe yours . In a crackdown on such operations , Glendale police_detectives recently arrested the two owners of an electronics store on La Cienega Boulevard in what may be one of the biggest cellular_phone fraud operations ever in Southern California . Police say they confiscated more_than 100 clone phones and the computer equipment needed to create them . It is estimated that a quarter of the cellular_telephone calls made in the Los Angeles area are made from counterfeit phones . that ' s something to think_about when you consider that the countermeasures necessary to interdict such crime will only make the service more expensive , and more complicated to use . It ' s also something to think_about if you ever make a police emergency 911 call from your cell phone , and get a &quot; system busy &quot; signal because illegal calls are jamming up the air time . What should you do to protect yourself , and help detect fraud ? We have a_few answers from the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. : * Lock your car phone , or remove the handset and the antenna when you leave your car unattended . * Keep your subscriber agreement , which includes your electronic serial number , in a private place . * Carefully check your monthly bill for unfamiliar numbers and report them to your cellular_phone company . * If you frequently receive hang-up calls or wrong number calls , report it . It may mean that your number has been tapped by a clone user . * Have your cellular provider eliminate long-distance dialing capabilities if you only use it for local_calls . And if you acquired your cellular_phone through one of those &quot; don ' t pay the phone_company , just pay us &quot; kind of deals , turn the phone in and the person who sold it to you . You have been unwittingly participating in a felony crime in California .</TEXT>
