   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : KEEP IMMIGRATION ON THE SIDE OF COMMON_SENSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you stick_to the facts and use common_sense about immigration , answers come clear and readily . The problem , partly , is timing , not numbers . The number of illegal immigrants -- roughly 300 # 000 a year , half of them to California -- is no greater now than in the 1970s and 1980s . But back then the economy was booming and California politicians , from President Ronald Reagan to Sen . Pete Wilson , supported an unhindered flow of illegal immigrants to work in agriculture and industry . But the economy is not booming today . Therefore , moves to stop illegal immigration are necessary and urgent . that ' s why the recent recommendations of the federal Commission on Immigration Reform are so important , and why Proposition 187 is such a dangerous distraction . Thanks to an unprecedented determination to curb illegal immigration , the U.S. Border_Patrol has been beefed_up at El Paso and San Diego . And in response to a Reform Commission recommendation , a computerized registry to validate employment documents will soon start pilot_programs in five states . The commission , which was set_up by the Immigration Act of 1990 , also recommended a cutoff of public benefits , such_as welfare , to illegal immigrants , but made an exception for education and child nutrition programs . That contrasts directly with Proposition 187 , which targets children by prohibiting education and non-emergency medical_care for illegal immigrants . The initiative on the Nov . 8 ballot is an angry measure , designed to send a message of public ire to Washington , which collects federal income_taxes from illegal immigrants but lets state and local_governments in California pay_for their social_services . Gov . Wilson ' s office is seeking $ 2.4 billion in reimbursement from the federal_government . The state ' s frustration is understandable , but Proposition 187 is the wrong way to go . If it passes , Washington won ' t pay California any money . But the state could lose billions in federal funds and be forced to spend hundreds of millions to find , expel and , presumably , deport immigrant students and then to fight countless lawsuits -- including a big one with the federal_government because 187 , targeting &quot; suspected illegals &quot; on what amounts to racial and ethnic grounds , is almost certainly unconstitutional . * If the initiative is only to send a message , it ' s one expensive telegram . The right way to go_about it would be to keep pressure on Washington to send_back tax money to offset California ' s extraordinary immigration burden and then to press enforcement efforts to tighten borders and deport illegal immigrants already here . The emphasis at all times should be_on enforcing the law , because not to do so is an injustice to America ' s legal immigrants , now numbering 750 # 000 a year plus about 120 # 000 legal refugees . Not enforcing the law also endangers all immigration , an integral part of the U.S. economy . Indeed , a backlash against immigration is now growing nationwide , though not to the angry pitch of former times when America excluded Chinese immigrants in the 19th Century , virtually stopped immigration from southern and eastern Europe in the 1920s and deported Mexican laborers in the 1950s . * Before things get_out of hand , we ' ll see changes in the next few years to make immigration policy flexible , allowing more immigrants in good economic years and fewer in bad years , says Lawrence Fuchs of Brandeis University , vice_chairman of today ' s Immigration Reform Commission and head of the 1979 commission that outlined policies for the immigration acts of 1980 , 1986 and 1990 . Immigration has evolved over time -- and has included a certain amount of illegal entry ever since the 1920s , when the first laws controlling immigration were passed . Americans never welcomed immigrants when they arrived , although we always admire groups that came_in years past . &quot; At any time , only 8 % of Americans said they would favor more immigration , &quot; says Rita Simon , a dean at Washington ' s American University and author of &quot; The Ambivalent Welcome , Public Policy and Immigration. &quot; Immigration ' s high point , before the present , was the decade 1901-10 , when 880 # 000 people a year came_in -- in reality more_than that , because only steerage passengers were counted , not cabin_class . But immigration slowed in the 1920s and reversed in the 1930s , with as_many emigrating from the United States as immigrating to it . A big change came_in 1965 , notes Dennis Aigner , dean of UC Irvine ' s graduate_school of management , when U.S. policy shifted to admit people fairly from all countries and to allow family reunification as a major reason for admittance . The effect was profound . Numbers increased from an average 250 # 000 immigrants a year in the 1950s to 500 # 000 annually in the 1970s and 700 # 000-plus in the 1980s . The new people came from Asia and Africa , Latin_America and Southern and Eastern Europe . And increasingly they came_to California . Since 1970 , the state ' s foreign-born population has climbed from 1.7 million to 6.5 million , according to Kevin McCarthy of Rand Corp. , the Santa Monica research firm , which is launching a 15-month study of California immigration . The immigrants weren ' t only hungry masses . Asian entrepreneurs came , set_up businesses and brought their families . Nurses and doctors came from many lands , as well as graduate_students in computer_science and engineering who stayed to staff the frontier companies of Silicon_Valley . We have always had a tier of high-end immigrants , from Revolutionary War generals like Von Steuben and Kosciuszko to refugee scientists like Einstein . And in the last two decades we also had an influx of poorer , less educated people from Mexico and Latin_America , Asia and Africa , just as from the earliest days we have received unlettered peasants from Ireland and Germany , Poland and Italy -- and involuntary arrivals from Africa . But they too have always found work or made their own , whether as servant_girls -- or nannies for children of middle-class Americans -- or truck-loading laborers or farmers or cobblers , or tailors , taxi drivers or gas_station managers . To be sure , no immigrant influx has been without conflict , from the coal mines of Pennsylvania to the lettuce fields of California . &quot; But over time , these are self-selective people who bring energy to our economy , especially as we favor family immigration and so provide an infrastructure , &quot; says Fuchs . * The main benefit America has always offered immigrants is not a soft life for themselves but the promise of a better life for their children . That has kept our economy young and vital -- an important consideration for a population that needs taxpaying workers to fund Social_Security in the next century . Outsiders often see such historic patterns more clearly than we do . Norbert Walter , chief economist of Germany ' s Deutsche Bank , puts it this way : &quot; Because you have selective immigration , I am really optimistic about America at the end of this decade , when the United States will be the youngest nation among the industrial countries. &quot; If you use common_sense about immigration , the outlook is clear and hopeful .</TEXT>
