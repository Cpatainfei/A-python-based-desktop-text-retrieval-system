   <HEADLINE> OUSTED GEORGIA LEADER A SUICIDE , HIS WIFE SAYS ; CAUCASUS : OTHER REPORTS SAY GAMSAKHURDIA WAS SLAIN BY FOES OR ALLIES . THE ONETIME HERO WAS LATER BRANDED A TYRANT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Zviad Gamsakhurdia , the ousted Georgian president who inspired a civil_war that devastated his homeland , is believed to have committed suicide in exile in western Georgia , his wife and other sources said Wednesday . Manana Gamsakhurdia told authorities and reporters that her 54-year-old husband shot himself to death in the early morning of Dec . 31 after his stronghold in the village of Dzhikhaskari was ambushed by pro-government troops . Mrs . Gamsakhurdia said that Georgian authorities knew of her husband ' s death but concealed it , and that she was informed of his death only on Wednesday , Russian news_agencies reported . However , numerous conflicting versions of Gamsakhurdia ' s death poured into Moscow from the Georgian capital of Tbilisi and from Chechnya , a breakaway republic in southern Russia where Gamsakhurdia spent time after a junta overthrew him in January , 1992 . One report from Tbilisi held that Gamsakhurdia was badly wounded in a Dec . 31 skirmish on Chechen territory and died Wednesday in the Chechen capital of Grozny . Another suggested he may have been shot in a fight with his own supporters . Georgian officials in Tbilisi and Moscow said that Mrs . Gamsakhurdia , who is in Grozny , &quot; was misinformed &quot; and that all available information was based on rumor and had yet to be verified . Gamsakhurdia ' s supporters released what they said were the rebel leader ' s last words . &quot; Being of_sound_mind , I commit this act in protest against the existing regime in Georgia and because I am deprived of the possibility to act_as president , to normalize the situation and to restore law and order , &quot; Gamsakhurdia is quoted as having said several minutes before his death . The message was distributed by Gamsakhurdia ' s press service in Grozny . Russian Television reported that the former dissident , who led the Georgian independence movement but was accused of turning dictatorial as soon as he took power , had grown despondent in defeat . In an 11 p.m. broadcast , the station ' s Tbilisi correspondent said Gamsakhurdia had retreated from western Georgia after his army was thrashed by troops loyal to Georgian President Eduard A . Shevardnadze . The philologist-turned-general fled to the mountains and then came_down to live with a farm family in the village of Dzhikhaskari . Fifty days ago , Gamsakhurdia began a hunger_strike , and by the end of December the burly leader had shrunk to 132 pounds . On Dec . 29 , the report said , he asked_for a Bible to be placed under his head . He did not rise again . At 4 a.m. on Dec . 31 , his bodyguards reportedly heard a muffled shot in the next room and found that the rebel leader had killed himself with a shot to the temple with a Stechkin navy pistol . Gamsakhurdia was buried in the yard of the farmhouse , the TV report said . &quot; I would add that there is no complete clarity as_to what really happened , &quot; the TV_announcer said . It is not at all_clear that Gamsakhurdia ' s death will bring peace to Georgia at last . One political analyst said that while Gamsakhurdia ' s death will deprive the opposition of its most potent symbol , other leaders will quickly rise to take his place . Meanwhile , Shevardnadze is still trying to bring an end to a separatist rebellion in the Black_Sea republic of Abkhazia . Separatists there are holding their territory , but in a New Year ' s address , Shevardnadze said their victory is temporary . If confirmed , Gamsakhurdia ' s suicide would be the last act of a historic and messianic figure . An intellectual and the son of a famous Georgian novelist and patriot , Gamsakhurdia inspired a virtual cult of nationalism among supporters known as &quot; Zviadists. &quot; He was first arrested as an anti-Soviet dissident at the age of 17 , in 1956 , and then arrested again in 1977 for founding a human_rights group . In one of the most controversial acts of his career , Gamsakhurdia recanted on television and was released after serving two years of his five-year sentence . As the Soviet_Union waned , Gamsakhurdia emerged as the leader of the Georgian independence movement and quickly became the most popular man in Georgia . On April 9 , 1991 , Gamsakhurdia declared Georgia ' s independence from the Soviet_Union . The next month he was elected president with 87 % of the vote . Within months , he was being vilified as a tyrant . He arrested political opponents , closed_down newspapers and inspired fear in Georgia ' s ethnic minorities . Gamsakhurdia said the Kremlin -- and Shevardnadze -- were inspiring his opposition . Members of the military junta that eventually overthrew him claimed his men were torturing opponents with electric_shocks in the basement of the Parliament building . His isolationist , nationalist policies alienated many , but he retained thousands of fervent supporters . Eventually , bloody battles between supporters and foes drove him into exile on Jan . 6 , 1992 . Shevardnadze , the distinguished former Soviet foreign_minister , was invited back to lead Georgia and was subsequently elected president . Gamsakhurdia supporters clashed repeatedly with government troops after their president was deposed . Twice during his exile , Gamsakhurdia rallied his armed followers to attempt to topple Shevardnadze . Last fall he almost succeeded . Shevardnadze blamed Gamsakhurdia for the chronic civil_wars that have plunged Georgia into political and economic anarchy , with long bread_lines , fuel shortages , waves of refugees , widespread lawlessness and nearly universal misery .</TEXT>
