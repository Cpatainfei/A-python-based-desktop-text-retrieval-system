   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : RINCON ; CONTAMINATED WATER FOUND NEAR OIL FIELD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The company that spilled 84 # 000 gallons of heavy crude_oil into McGrath Lake near Oxnard late last year has alerted water quality officials of ground-water contamination discovered near the company ' s Rincon area plant . In a letter dated May 27 , attorneys for Berry Petroleum told the Regional Water Quality_Control Board that workers found traces of petroleum hydrocarbons in the ground_water at an oil field near its Rincon plant . The company ' s attorneys told state water officials that Berry ' s operations do not appear to have caused the contamination , which the company said appears to pose no health threat . &quot; There is no ( drinking ) water basin in this area , and no beneficial use is made of this shallow ground_water , &quot; the letter states . Berry Petroleum has already retained a consultant to evaluate samples of the water and investigate the source of contamination . But attorney Marc L . Charney said that does not mean that his clients are to blame . &quot; It looks_like something that couldn ' t have come from any Berry operation , &quot; Charney said . Jim Ross of the Regional Water Quality_Control Board in Monterey Park said he would wait for results of the consultant ' s report before launching an investigation of_his_own . &quot; These ( incidents ) are not that uncommon , &quot; said Ross , who heads the agency ' s site cleanup division . He said there is a &quot; high potential &quot; for impacts to ground water from any oil-production operation . &quot; After we see the report , then we usually conduct a field inspection , &quot; Ross said . Bush Oil Co. , a division of Berry Petroleum , spilled 84 # 000 gallons of thick crude into McGrath Lake near Oxnard after a pipeline burst in December . Hundreds of birds and other species were killed as a result of the leak , which is under investigation by the Ventura County district_attorney . JEFF McDONALD</TEXT>
