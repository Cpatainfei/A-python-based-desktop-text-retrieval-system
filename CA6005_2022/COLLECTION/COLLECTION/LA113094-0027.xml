   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; FROM THE ASHES OF WWII ; TWO EXHIBITIONS AT THE GUGGENHEIM EXPLORE ITALIAN , JAPANESE POSTWAR ART</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The fall season at the Solomon R . Guggenheim Museum is marked by a pair of big , dutiful survey shows that leaves a visitor feeling grateful for having seen them , if not exactly inspired by the result . They ' re of interest mostly as historical exercises -- they might even be called landmark shows -- with a_few choice nuggets encountered along the way . &quot; The Italian Metamorphosis , 1943-1968 &quot; is a huge survey of painting , sculpture , architecture , design , photography , fashion and film , made in the 25 years following the fall of the Fascist regime . Guggenheim curator Germano Celant and a team of nine consultants have pulled_together more_than 1 # 000 works , from the slashed paintings of Lucio Fontana to the pop-historical dress designs of Emilio Pucci , which jam the spiral ramps and side galleries of the Fifth_Avenue building on Manhattan ' s Upper East_Side . Downtown , at the Guggenheim Soho , independent curator Alexandra Munroe has assembled 200 works_of_art for &quot; Japanese Art After 1945 : Scream Against the Sky , &quot; which surveys its subject up_to the present day . The title comes from a 1961 Conceptual music score by Yoko Ono , who also directed a vocalist to scream &quot; against the wind &quot; and &quot; against the wall. &quot; In this show ' s context , however , &quot; Scream Against the Sky &quot; inevitably alludes to the bombing of Hiroshima in the final days of World_War_II . Together , these two exhibitions examine art made during decades of rebuilding after the wartime defeat of the two smaller Axis powers . They repeatedly demonstrate the ways in which Italian and Japanese artists wrestled in their own work with the influx of American art and popular culture , skeptically or not , and with lingering traditions of European Modernism . The Guggenheim , like many other museums , has actively presented German art of the past quarter-century , a period of remarkable efflorescence in significant work . Especially since the 1960s , German artists engaged in an unblinking and diverse program of self-examination that bore abundant fruit . By contrast , the Italian and Japanese shows suggest a generally more parochial endeavor . In fact , the single most powerful image produced in postwar Italy was the radiantly impish face of Giulietta Masina . In a gallery where film_clips are continuously shown , fleeting moments of performances by the great actress pretty much make you forget Italian painting and sculpture of the period . On this exhibition ' s evidence , Italian art floundered amid rather narrow interests . Cinema and product design are the principal accomplishments of Italy ' s immediate postwar era . Film had the bloated specter of high-flown Fascist propaganda against which to react and re-create itself , from the ground up . Directors as diverse as Roberto Rossellini , Luchino Visconti and Federico Fellini made the most of it . Other , subsequent directors , such_as Michelangelo Antonioni and Pier Paolo Pasolini , were given a new and lively tradition on which to build . Artists , meanwhile , seem to have been in search of a reason for being . At worst , sculptors such_as Fausto Melotti and Marino Marini cling for dear life to the precedents of Picasso . Experiments with new materials and techniques , apparently undertaken for their own sake , abound . The canvas is a battered , ruined site in Alberto Burri ' s burned pictures , Piero Manzoni ' s bandaged canvases , Fontana ' s slashed ones and Emilio Vedova ' s hapless efforts to transform Abstract Expressionist paintings into rickety environmental sculptures . More convincing is the Arte Povera ( &quot; poor art &quot; ) of the 1960s , although its principal motif of the tensions in contemporary life between nature and industrial production gets sort of goofy when it ' s represented by a head of lettuce wedged between two carved blocks of granite ( Giovanni Anselmo ) . Designers , in fact , seem to have a firmer grasp on the modern dialogues between industrial and natural forms . Whether it ' s a streamlined Vespa motor_scooter by Corradino D ' Ascanio or a pair of swooping , metallic shoes by Salvatore Ferragamo , design ( but not , oddly enough , architecture ) is usually of more sustaining interest in the show . One artist whose evolving work is consistently compelling is the Greek expatriate Jannis Kounellis . In paintings of the early 1960s , the stuttering appearance of letters , numbers , signs and floating words begins to suggest the multisensory , mixed-media work for which he would become widely known . The show ' s most arresting sculpture is Kounellis ' horizontal plane of iron , low to the ground , from which a half-dozen spiky cactus grow , like hardy and eccentric personalities in a bleak , industrial landscape -- De Chirico redux . Incidentally , it ' s worth noting that &quot; The Italian Metamorphosis &quot; represents almost exclusively male activity . Of its 32 artists , only two are women ; of the scores of designers and craftsmen , a bare handful are . Surprisingly , things are not quite so biased against women in Japanese art , probably because that survey continues up_to the present day so it includes the rise of feminism . The rigidity of traditional Japanese culture gave feminist artists a big target . &quot; Scream Against the Sky &quot; doesn ' t boast the multimedia scope of the Italian show , even though its time-frame is twice as long . It focuses_on art . Coincidentally , however , a large survey of postwar Japanese design currently at the Philadelphia Museum of Art attests that industrial design is likewise the most consistently inventive postwar achievement in Japan . By comparison , much of the art feels tentative . Among artists , the big exceptions are Yayoi Kusama and the late Hijikata Tatsumi . Both were born around 1930 and came_into their own in the 1960s . And both give new meaning to the word obsessional . Kusama ' s repetitive &quot; accumulations &quot; of everything from airmail stickers and polka_dots to painted pumpkins and phallus-forms made from stuffed cloth are delightfully absurdist celebrations of mass-produced glut . The neurotic repetition ritualizes the motif , salvaging a loony kind of meditative transcendence . Hijikata was an originator of the Butoh style of dance , a dark , expressionistic revel in irrationality and primal sexuality . ( Butoh -- and Hijikata -- were inspirations to the notorious Japanese writer Yukio Mishima. ) A grainy , hand-held , black-and-white film of a 1968 dance in Tokyo -- featuring a strangled rooster , a massive golden phallus , a pig on a royal litter , a red-satin dress and the demonic-looking artist ' s Christlike ascension into a pitch-black heaven ( don ' t ask ) -- is that rarest of performance-documents : It makes you wish you had actually been there . * &quot; The Italian Metamorphosis , 1943-1968 , &quot; Solomon R . Guggenheim Museum , 1071 Fifth Ave. , ( 212 ) 423-3500 , through Jan . 22 ; &quot; Japanese Art After 1945 : Scream Against the Sky , &quot; Guggenheim Soho , 575 Broadway , through Jan . 8 .</TEXT>
