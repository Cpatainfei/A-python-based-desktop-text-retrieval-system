   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL , JORDAN OK DRAFT PEACE_TREATY ; MIDEAST : PRELIMINARY ACCORD SETTLES BORDER DISPUTES , PROVIDES FOR TWO NATIONS TO SHARE WATER . IT MARKS THE JEWISH STATE ' S SECOND SUCH PACT WITH AN ARAB NEIGHBOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel and Jordan , accelerating the search for peace in the Middle_East , agreed Monday on a draft treaty that settles their border disputes , shares scarce water resources and ensures the security of both . When the treaty is signed next week and ratified , Israel will be at_peace with two of its Arab neighbors , Jordan and Egypt , and strongly pursuing negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians in a sustained effort to bring the Arab-Israeli conflict to an end within the coming year . &quot; I am_full of hope that the future will be a future of peace , that this step will be a very important one ( for ) a comprehensive peace in this region , &quot; King Hussein of Jordan said . &quot; Hopefully , it is a fresh beginning and a fresh_start , &quot; he continued , alluding to the long refusal of the Arabs to accept the Jewish state -- and the many wars that have resulted . &quot; We will guard ( this peace ) , and I hope that the generations beyond us will guard it , enjoy it and cherish it -- a peace with dignity. &quot; Israel and Jordan will establish full diplomatic relations by the end of the year ; tourists and business people from both countries will be able to travel_back_and_forth , and Jordan will halt its participation in the Arab boycott of Israel to permit full trade with the Jewish state . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , who initialed Monday ' s accord along with Prime_Minister Abdul Salam Majali of Jordan , called the agreement a &quot; historically unique moment &quot; and praised Hussein ' s &quot; courageous decision &quot; in deciding to accelerate the negotiations , not waiting for Syria to catch_up . The treaty will be &quot; a cornerstone for a new Middle_East in which peace , development and cooperation will replace animosity , hatred , violence and wars , &quot; said Rabin , who like the king was glowing with pride . &quot; It is a very important day for our countries and our peoples , but I believe also that it is a source of inspiration , an example that peace is attainable. &quot; The agreement renewed optimism in the region about prospects for peace after two murderous attacks within Israel by Islamic militants last week . In retaliation , Israel suspended talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization on broadening the Palestinian Authority and holding elections in the Gaza Strip and West_Bank , raising serious questions about the course of the peacemaking process . In Washington , President Clinton said he was &quot; delighted &quot; with the agreement and announced that he will accept a Jordanian-Israeli invitation to witness the formal signing of the treaty , expected Oct . 26 at a spot along the two nations ' desert frontier . &quot; At a time when hatred and extremism and threatening behavior still stalk the Middle_East , &quot; Clinton said , &quot; this agreement reminds us that moderation and reason are prevailing , that nations can put conflicts behind them , that courageous statesmen can lead their people to peace. &quot; Clinton said he hoped that Israel ' s agreement with Jordan will ease the far more difficult negotiations with Syria . &quot; We are continuing to work there and we are encouraged , &quot; he said of the ongoing U.S. mediation . &quot; We just have to keep working. &quot; Other officials said Clinton will probably also visit U.S. troops in Kuwait or Saudi_Arabia . The President may also meet with Syrian President Hafez Assad to promote peace between Syria and Israel , they said , although the scheduling and location of such a meeting has not been worked_out . Clinton will be the first U.S. President to visit Israel since Jimmy_Carter in 1979 . In Jerusalem , Israeli President Ezer Weizman said Assad &quot; should look_around and see ( whether ) he may be the last in_line &quot; to make_peace with Israel . But Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh tartly reminded Israel from Damascus : &quot; We hope the Israeli government will realize the fact that without achieving peace with Syria and Lebanon , there will be no peace in the region . . . . This is the reality. &quot; Although Israel and Jordan signed a nonbelligerency pact in Washington on July 25 and have been working since then to resolve differences standing in the way of a full peace_treaty , there were fears among Israelis that Hussein , who had not wanted to get too far ahead of Assad , would hold_up a final agreement . &quot; These are two countries that have large shared areas and a long history of cooperation rather than opposition , &quot; said Asher Susser , a political_scientist at Tel Aviv University and a leading Israeli specialist on Jordan . &quot; The treaty reflects that , historically , Israel ' s relations with Jordan have always been better than with the other Arabs . . . . &quot; The treaty consequently has been more a measure of summing these up and giving them formal shape than an arduous negotiation . It was always more a question of timing than of the actual compromises involved. &quot; Rabin had come_to Amman on Sunday evening determined to make as much progress as possible on the draft treaty . He negotiated with Hussein until 3 a.m. , slept a_few hours in the royal palace and then resumed talks with the king . &quot; We sat together throughout the night , and the atmosphere remained exceptional , &quot; Shimon Sheves , a senior Rabin aide , said . &quot; The prime_minister and the king went_through the draft . . . paragraph by paragraph. &quot; Jordanian Prime_Minister Majali and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres held parallel talks , and the full negotiating teams broke_into small groups , worked_through the night and then reviewed the 15-page treaty with Hussein and Rabin on Monday morning after breakfast . Anxious to build momentum in the peace process as_a_whole , Rabin had already paid two visits here last week and , in an extraordinary move , assigned Ephraim Halevi , the deputy chief of Israeli intelligence , to conduct almost continuous negotiations in Amman . &quot; Rabin was worried , and maybe the king was as well , that the issues might be talked to death , the negotiations slowed and our whole push for peace dissipated , &quot; a senior Israeli official said . &quot; The agreement with Jordan will put some pressure on Syria and the Palestinians to keep pace or be left_behind . The connection is not so direct , but it is real. &quot; Susser said that Syria lost its veto power over Jordan and the Palestinians last year in peace negotiations , freeing both to make their own deals . Syria consequently finds itself under pressure , he added , to move ahead and ensure that its interests are not ignored as a new regional balance_of_power takes_shape . Under the draft agreement , Israel will give_back to Jordan farming land in two areas that was seized in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War -- and then lease it for a period of 25 years and possibly longer . One area lies between the Sea of Galilee and Beit Shean in the Jordan Valley , and the other is near Zofar between the Dead_Sea and the Gulf_of_Aqaba . Other land disputes were settled by an agreement to exchange small pieces of territory and establish a proper border -- not just an armistice or cease-fire line -- between the two countries . No Israeli community will be uprooted by the agreement , Rabin said . The sharing of limited regional water resources was resolved with an agreement that Jordan can build a dam on the Yarmuk River before it feeds into the Jordan_River , with plans for a second one later , both with World_Bank financing . Israel also promised to take Jordan ' s needs into consideration when releasing water from the Sea of Galilee into the Jordan . Jordan claimed Israel was diverting more_than its fair share of regional river waters , but Israel said the solution was to enlarge the waters available . &quot; We got all our rights and even more_than what we dreamed of , &quot; Jordan ' s chief water negotiator , Munther Hadadin , told reporters . The agreement won quick approval in Israel , even from the right-wing opposition . &quot; What we all want is real peace , &quot; Benjamin Netanyahu , chairman of the Likud Party , said . &quot; The argument between me and Yitzhak Rabin is not over Jordan , because there we have an entity that wants to live with us , not replace us . The real argument is over the PLO , which wants to replace us in stages. &quot; There were clear misgivings among Palestinians , who fear that Jordan is trying to supplant the PLO in negotiations with Israel . &quot; Considering the triangular relations among us , the Jordanians and the Israelis , I believe there are common things , like water resources , that we must consider together , &quot; said Faisal Husseini , a minister in the Palestinian Authority . &quot; Talking_about water without having an agreement with the Palestinians is not right. &quot; Palestinians will also be irritated by the way that the draft treaty reaffirms Israel ' s respect for Jordan ' s traditional role as the guardian of Islamic holy_places in Jerusalem and thus puts Jordan into negotiations on the city ' s future . The treaty will make Jordan the second Arab country formally at_peace with Israel . Egypt , in 1979 the first to make_peace , was ostracized for more_than a decade , and President Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by Islamic militants angered by that treaty . Times staff writers Robin Wright and Doyle McManus in Washington contributed to this report . Terms for Peace Israel and Jordan have reconciled their differences , paving the way for a peace_treaty between the two countries . What was agreed on : * Israel will give some of the land it captured in 1948 back to Jordan but will lease areas that have Israeli settlements or farms . * Other land disputes will be settled by swapping territory . * Both sides have agreed to begin water_projects on the Yarmuk River .</TEXT>
