   <TEXT> Rather than city government &quot; apologizing for the fact that English is the national language of Los Angeles &quot; ( Commentary , Dec . 1 ) , I suggest that Diana Beard-Williams beg for forgiveness for her attack on multilingualism . Publishing city proposals , voting pamphlets and city notices in minority languages is an issue of access , not compromise.There are many immigrants who establish themselves in Los Angeles with a desire to participate in civic activities . These people , who may be proficient in English , may_not have the grasp of the language required to understand the complex written materials in their second language that nonetheless have a direct effect on their community . As a college graduate , an English / Spanish / Korean-speaking L.A. native and the daughter of Korean immigrants , I often have difficulty understanding the nuances of city proposals and the_like . The waste is not city money spent to publish written materials in several languages but the voices of the immigrant communities that are consistently ignored in the name of efficiency . SANDRA CHOE Manhattan Beach &quot; We Speak English in L.A. ; Don ' t Apologize &quot; was absolutely correct . English is the business language of the world and it is spoken by cab drivers in Paris , waiters in Rome and salesclerks in Tokyo . We do a disservice to L.A. residents if we send the message that English is not a language they need to know . Encouraging people not to learn English will impede their ability to get better jobs and will make our country a weaker competitor in world trade . DAVID V . HANDELMAN Los Angeles</TEXT>
