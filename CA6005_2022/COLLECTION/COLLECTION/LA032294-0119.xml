   <HEADLINE> MYSTERIES OF MOTHER EARTH , OTHER WORLDS ; SPACE : LEARNING AND MAKING_SENSE OF PLANETARY SCIENCE IS MISSION OF SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO RESEARCH INSTITUTE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The boy in the front row held_up an uglyrock , gray , jagged and dirty . &quot; It ' s a meteorite ! &quot; he said . The girl in the second row wanted to know how close she could come_to the sun before she and her spaceship blew apart in a ball_of_fire . And the girl in the back asked , with the weight of the world etched in her face , whether we will &quot; ever be able to repair the ozone layer. &quot; Douglas B . Nash , 61 , fielded each question patiently , as 80 area students spent a morning learning about space at the San Juan Capistrano Research Institute , which receives $ 500 # 000 a year from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , partly for conducting such &quot; Q &amp; A &quot; get-togethers . Nash told the boy his rock might be a meteorite but probably wasn ' t . ( A long discussion about meteorites ensued. ) He told the girl that standing in her back yard could generate plenty of damage from the sun . ( A discussion about ultraviolet rays ensued. ) And he told the other girl that human_beings are doing all they can to damage the ozone through the excesses of industry and commerce . Unless society changes , he warned his listeners , the future looks bleak . Such mornings are not uncommon at the 6-year-old institute , which addresses more_than 3 # 000 schoolchildren a year on planetary science , Nash ' s forte and that of three other staff scientists , each of whom obtains grants from NASA for studies of the stars . In addition to research , the institute ' s roles are education , science workshops for teachers and major conferences on all things planetary . Confabs with Orange County students are a small part of an institute whose high-powered focus often leads to new approaches on NASA space missions or brings_together some of the world ' s most renowned planetary authorities . The institute ' s mission , Nash said , is to learn as much as possible about planetary science and then apply it to &quot; the environment -- on a scale that ' s bigger than our city , county , nation or world . I ' m talking here about other worlds. &quot; NASA administrators credit Nash with conducting a workshop a year and a half ago at which more_than 70 new concepts were presented that later helped shape some of the agency ' s unmanned planetary missions . And yet despite being appreciated by NASA , the institute is , like others specializing in planetary science , under constant threat of losing its funding . Overall , scientists applaud the institute for having created a small-scale think_tank in a scenic environment , free from the bureaucratic tangle of mammoth agencies and institutions . And civic officials here commend Nash ' s work for recommending the city for something other_than swallows and its famous mission . The institute began as Nash ' s attempt to free himself from bureaucratic constraints and put his own job closer to home . As a 30-year research scientist and science program manager of the renowned Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , he was one of the first commuters to travel daily between South County and Los Angeles via Amtrak . Nash calls JPL , a branch of Caltech , &quot; a very powerful organization that has achieved tremendous things for our country , but it ' s a ponderous beast at times . Scientists , as a rule , tend to be particularly perturbed by bureaucracy. &quot; He worked_at JPL until 1992 , four years after founding the institute , which got its start through a $ 15 # 000 contribution from private donors in conjunction with a matching grant from the city of San Juan Capistrano , which Nash formerly served as a city councilman and mayor . His wife , Carolyn Nash , is now a councilwoman . Initially , the Birtcher Corp . provided the institute office space free_of charge . In 1989 , when Nash moved his nine-person staff to a former bank branch owned by Birtcher , the city kicked_in with a $ 6 # 000-a-month rent subsidy that totaled more_than $ 200 # 000 before expiring last year . The institute now pays its own rent , Nash said , and has a payroll of $ 280 # 000 a year for the entire staff . These days , Nash ' s problems are entirely about money . His &quot; annual crisis &quot; is persuading NASA to renew its $ 500 # 000 appropriation -- no small task in a deficit era that appears hell-bent on claiming planetary science as a victim . Nash said the institute is in no danger of folding but he does hope to cultivate sources of private funding that can compensate for a government shortfall . Meanwhile , his brainchild continues to flourish . The institute has played host to a series of international conferences attended by scientists from NASA , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Caltech , the University of Paris , the University of Tokyo and several famous Max Planck institutes in Germany . Henry Brinton , acting chief of the planetary science branch of the solar_system exploratory division of NASA , calls Nash &quot; a highly respected scientist in the planetary science community , &quot; whose specialty is the study of planetary satellite surfaces and their composition and characteristics . Brinton said the agency applauds Nash for having expanded the scope of the institute to include education and &quot; interactions with young people , which is an important focus of NASA ' s program today. &quot; He said the institute has been &quot; well ahead of the game in computer visualization -- taking scientific imaging data and manipulating it by using a computer to enhance various characteristics of the image you ' re looking_at . You can view surfaces from different angles as if you ' re flying over them in an airplane . All of these computer-graphic visual aids are of immense value to scientists in better understanding their data. &quot; Nash has devoted much of_his_own career to the study of Io , an obscure moon of the planet Jupiter . His eyes widen as he talks_about Io ' s high_temperatures and volatile activity . &quot; It has a surface completely in turmoil , &quot; he said . &quot; In my opinion , it ' s the most intriguing body outside the earth . It has active volcanism of an extraordinary extent , far more_than that of earth . It has a surface enriched in sulfur , much in the way the earth ' s surface is enriched in water. &quot; The fact that such work even occurs here is celebrated by city officials , who say the institute brings a unique dimension to a town known largely for its birds . &quot; There ' s a lot of interest in our mission and in our swallows , &quot; said Councilman Gary Hausdorfer . &quot; But the institute is drawing scientists from around the world , and NASA has acknowledged that valuable planetary research is going_on right here in San Juan Capistrano. &quot; Not that the institute has been without controversy . In 1992 , Santa Ana real_estate investor James Meehan filed a complaint with the state Fair Political Practices Commission claiming that then-council candidate Carolyn Nash failed to report on her campaign forms the $ 6 # 000 monthly rent subsidy made by the city to her husband ' s institute . The city made rent subsidies of more_than $ 200 # 000 to the institute between 1988 and 1992 , the complaint said . Nash -- whom the FPPC later exonerated -- said she forgot to report the subsidy . Her husband calls the episode &quot; a very unfortunate and painful experience . It merely portrayed how low people can reach in trying to achieve their political ends. &quot; If anything , the dispute underscored how daunting a role finances play in the institute ' s profile . &quot; NASA funding is flat , and it ' s causing a lot of stress within the system , &quot; Doug Nash said . &quot; Small organizations like ours are even more vulnerable . We don ' t have the momentum of the large organizations. &quot; Although he voted for Clinton and supports the President ' s efforts -- in local politics , Nash and his wife are strictly slow-growth -- he bemoans the Administration ' s lack of emphasis within NASA on planetary science , the institute ' s lifeblood . &quot; The President has drawn his priorities in such a way that space science is at the bottom of the heap , &quot; Nash said . &quot; Even within NASA , they have ranked the space_station at the top , followed by aeronautics , then technology , then the ' mission to planet Earth , ' or so-called Earth_science , then planetary science. &quot; Nash believes planetary science holds the answers to a multitude of problems , not the least of which is depletion of the ozone_layer and the spread of so-called greenhouse gases . Part of the institute ' s research , currently going_on with other scientists from around the world on the Yungfraujoch mountain in Switzerland , seeks to use infrared_radiation to &quot; explore chemical components in the earth ' s atmosphere , particularly the ozone layer. &quot; Funding woes trouble Nash for the limitations they impose on such work . He for one hopes the United States returns to the moon someday -- preferably to its so-called &quot; dark side &quot; -- which he says would afford mankind the best space_station and telescope site imaginable , higher than any point on earth and free from most of Earth ' s magnetic_field . If nothing else , he said , it would give him something to talk_about when all those school kids come_to visit . &quot; As scientists , we ' re happy to share that knowledge as soon as possible , &quot; Nash said . &quot; Plus , it ' s just flat-out fun to see the light in a student ' s eyes . As a scientist and as a person , that ' s something you live for. &quot;</TEXT>
