   <HEADLINE> NEW STATE STANDARDS FOR PLUMS CRITICIZED BY CONSUMER GROUPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The California Department of Food and Agriculture on Wednesday announced marketing orders for plums , which consumer advocates said would result in tighter supplies and higher prices for the fruit . The marketing order gives a state-appointed committee of plum farmers the right to set appearance standards for the fruit . Plums not meeting the standards -- those with a spot of sunburn , for example -- cannot be legally sold , though they are edible . Although the marketing order applies only to shipments of California-grown plums , its impact reaches beyond the state , as California accounts_for 88 % of U.S. plum production . California plum sales topped $ 63 million in 1993 . Influential plum growers have argued that marketing orders are needed to keep unripe fruit off the market . They said sales suffer when consumers disappointed by poor-quality plums refuse to buy more . Consumer advocates and a minority of plum growers say few growers sell unripe fruit . They contend marketing orders are mechanisms for controlling the price and supply of plums , at the expense of consumers and competitors who want to sell less-than-perfect-looking fruit . &quot; I know of no other industry where groups of competitors are allowed to dictate to everyone else how much they can sell and what consumers will have access to , &quot; said plum grower Dan Gerawan , who two years ago ran_afoul of federal marketing_orders barring sale of undersized nectarines and peaches . &quot; It is like McDonald ' s and Taco Bell getting_together to decide Burger King ' s sales. &quot; Consumer advocates have argued that beauty standards for plums may mean that up_to 10 % of the crop will be destroyed every year . Consumers probably won ' t see much of an impact immediately , given the controversy over the marketing orders , said Harry Snyder , co-director of the West Coast office of Consumers Union , the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports . &quot; They are probably too smart to limit the amount getting_to consumers this year , &quot; he said . &quot; In future years , farmers and handlers and packing houses will decide what kind of plums we can get and how we can get them . It will result in higher prices , less choice and destruction of edible fruit. ' Plum marketing orders in California have a tangled history . Federal marketing orders for plums were lifted in 1991 amid charges of favoritism on the part of the committee of plum growers administering them . In a 4-year-old federal lawsuit still pending , four large plum growers allege that the committee manipulated the &quot; color standards &quot; to keep their competitors ' fruit off the market . Farmers on the committee deny the allegations . Poor plum seasons led some farmers to seek reinstatement of marketing orders . The push for state marketing orders in turn inspired state legislation outlawing the orders , now before the Assembly Agriculture Committee . It is supported by Consumers Union and opposed by many agricultural groups . Melvin Enns , a plum grower and proponent of the state marketing order , said color is one element of the new appearance standards . He said the new standards would have two tiers , rather than one under the old federal marketing order . This would allow farmers to sell plums not meeting the highest level for appearance standards . Enns estimated that three-quarters of plums sold by California farmers already meet the highest standard , known as California well-mature . Enns said he didn ' t know whether the marketing orders would affect consumer prices . &quot; There are so many variables involved in what a supermarket charges , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
