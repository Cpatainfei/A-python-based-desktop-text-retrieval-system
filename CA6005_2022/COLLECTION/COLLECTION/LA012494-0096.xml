   <HEADLINE> TURMOIL ROILS TOKYO MARKETS , MAY STALL RECOVERY ; JAPAN : HOSOKAWA ' S ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN IS IN TROUBLE ; THE PRIME_MINISTER MAY LOSE HIS JOB . STOCKS PLUNGE IN EARLY TRADING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pessimism sparked by the defeat late last week of Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ' s anti-corruption political reform package prompted a sharp plunge in Tokyo stocks early today . Hosokawa ' s setback in Parliament clouds prospects for quick passage of an economic stimulus program , which investors have counted_on to jump-start Japan ' s stagnant economy . Political disarray in Tokyo also poses new difficulties for the resolution of U.S.-Japan trade disputes . Hosokawa ' s fragile , seven-party coalition government has been drawing_up a $ 120-billion program of public works outlays , other spending programs , deregulation measures and income_tax cuts aimed at pulling Japan out of its worst postwar recession . But action has been delayed by the priority given to the anti-corruption political reform package and by a split in the ruling coalition over whether income_tax cuts should be balanced by a consumption tax increase . The Hosokawa cabinet ' s inability to quickly enact a stimulus program adds_to already deep gloom about the economy ' s short-term prospects . The Tokyo Stock_Exchange was closed Friday when Parliament ' s upper house voted_down the political reform . In mid-afternoon trading today , the Nikkei was down 842.58 points , or 4.4 % , to 18 # 464.85. An equivalent drop_in U.S. markets would shave 168.32 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which starts the week at 3914.48. &quot; The biggest reason for the decline is the failure of the political reform bills in the Upper House , &quot; noted Tomoatsu Yamamuro , a trader at Yamaichi Securities Co . After plunging during the final months of last year , Tokyo stocks had risen sharply in recent weeks on investment by foreign bargain-hunters and expectations that a stimulus package might finally set the economy on a path toward renewed growth . &quot; U.S. pension_funds and mutual_funds ( have been ) buying Japanese shares , &quot; Tetsuo Tanimura , vice_president at CS First Boston ( Japan ) , explained earlier this month , while the market was rising . &quot; It would be too late after signs of economic recovery are seen. &quot; The relative optimism of foreign investors continued this morning . &quot; The encouraging thing is that foreigners are not changing their positions as net buyers , &quot; commented a trader at a foreign securities firm . Widespread Japanese sentiment was reflected in comments after Friday ' s vote by Masaru Hayami , chairman of the Japan Federation of Corporate_Executives . &quot; I feel absolutely frustrated , &quot; he said . &quot; Japan will suffer if , in a political vacuum , something is not done about the economic slump. &quot; The Clinton_Administration also is worried about the potential effects of political turmoil in Tokyo . Washington hoped that Hosokawa ' s reform-minded administration would push broad deregulation of Japan ' s economy and nurture greater receptivity to imports . But those expectations are now threatened by the possibility that the prime_minister himself will be out of office within weeks , either through resignation or a decision to call new parliamentary elections . Hosokawa had hoped to achieve passage of political reforms on Friday and announce an economic stimulus program this week . The idea was to have both packages firmly in_hand before meeting President Clinton Feb . 11 in a trade-oriented summit . The prime_minister still has that aim , even if political reform has to be watered_down and economic_policies need to be patched together amid political confusion . But Hosokawa may arrive in Washington without either one . There also is great uncertainty whether any significant bilateral trade agreements will be ready for signing at the summit . U.S. Treasury_Secretary Lloyd M . Bentsen , visiting Tokyo , said Sunday that the trade talks could fail to produce acceptable results . In that case , the United States may take a more forceful approach to prying open Japanese markets , he said . A failed summit could lead to U.S. efforts to promote a stronger yen -- and that would hurt Japan ' s ability to export . Washington could also decide to impose trade sanctions if other measures prove unsuccessful in boosting U.S. exports to Japan and reducing the bilateral trade imbalance , which hit about $ 50 billion last year . Any such measures would further chill prospects for recovery in Japan . Hosokawa will try again this week to reach a compromise with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to allow passage of a revised set of reform bills . But attempts at compromise could put further strains on_his_own coalition . &quot; Government ministries and ruling coalition parties are currently working_on the budget , but their efforts will not be 100 % as long as the political reform bills are pending , &quot; Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata , a key coalition figure , acknowledged after defeat of the original reform proposal . Hosokawa ' s cabinet was already behind schedule in preparing a budget_for the 1994 fiscal_year , which begins April 1 . Many of the proposed stimulus measures are intended to go_into this budget . With the ruling parties in disarray , it is unclear when the government can focus_on the economy . Should a general_election be called , strong economic measures could be postponed for months .
