   <TEXT> The most alluring aspect of personal computing these days is the growing abundance of CD-ROM programs that promise to inform , educate and entertain us in dazzling new ways . You might think that nothing could be easier than inserting a CD-ROM disc and having its contents appear on your screen . After all , when you put a CD audio disc into your stereo , you get instant music . Unfortunately , computers are not as easy to operate as stereos . They ' re not even close . There are many complexities in the world of CD-ROMs . Unlike CD audio , there are many variations of CD-ROM , both in file structure and in program features and operation . These differences can spell trouble . Some CD-ROMs are structured so they work only on Macintosh computers . Others work only on IBM and compatibles . Some will work_on both kinds of machines . Among the IBM-only CD-ROMs , some require Windows and others don ' t . Many need a sound card , some don ' t . This means you can ' t just pick any title off the shelf . You need to study the fine print to make_sure its hardware requirements match your computer . Of course , that means you need to know fundamental hardware details about your computer , like the kind of microprocessor it has , such_as 386 or 486 , and how much random_access_memory . Not only do you need to know whether it has a sound card , but you should also know the brand and model . It gets_worse . Some CD-ROMs , especially those published by Knowledge Adventure Inc. , expect you to know intimate technical details of your sound card ' s installation . You can probably easily install the CD-ROMs without actually knowing these details . But if you encounter problems , it can be tough to make corrections without a fairly technical understanding of your computer . The performance specifications of your CD-ROM_drive are important too . Older drives can transfer data only at 150 kilobytes per second . that ' s OK for text , most audio and photographs . But it ' s too slow for video clips . If you ' re buying a CD-ROM , make_sure it is at least a double-speed model . There are plenty of single-speed units still on the market at what seem like bargain prices -- until you realize they are inadequate for many of today ' s CD-ROM titles . Like everything else about personal computing , double-speed CD-ROM_drives will be obsolete in a year or two , if not sooner . The industry is headed toward easily affordable full-color , full-motion , full-screen video with stereo-quality audio . That will require faster CD-ROM_drives and special hardware to instantly decompress highly compressed video files . It is available now , but it is expensive . Despite these potential problems , most of the time it is easy to install and play CD-ROM titles on your personal_computer -- particularly if within the past year you bought a multimedia 486-based PC or one of the higher-powered Macintoshes with a CD-ROM_drive . The Microsoft CD-ROM titles are easy to install and use and offer high-quality programming . However , they do need about eight megabytes of hard_disk storage to obtain maximum performance . Other publishers whose CD-ROMs I have found to be reliable and easy to install are Sumeria , Sony Imagesoft , Allegro New Media , Claris Corp. , Aris Entertainment and Grolier . Knowledge Adventure CD-ROMs have a more complicated installation program than most others . Most current CD-ROMs require Windows and take_advantage of multimedia features that can be built into Windows . Knowledge Adventure titles , however , are really designed to run under DOS . They can be installed to run from within Windows , but doing so is awkward at best . The Knowledge Adventure installation modifies a_couple_of critical Windows files , and it creates a separate program configuration file . Unfortunately , that configuration file conflicted with other features of my computer , causing my computer to freeze up when I tried to run the CD-ROM program I had just installed . ( It happened with every Knowledge Adventure title I tested. ) Although the instruction_manual explained how to edit the configuration file to correct such problems , it is a technical task that casual users will find daunting . Bill Gross , Knowledge Adventure ' s chairman , acknowledged that the installation program can be difficult . The trade-off , he said , is the ability of his firm ' s programs to do things not normally possible from within Windows , such_as full-screen video . But because of new programming features that Microsoft is making available to software developers , he said , by Christmas he expects Knowledge Adventure to have true Windows versions of its programs without sacrificing the extra performance of the DOS versions .
