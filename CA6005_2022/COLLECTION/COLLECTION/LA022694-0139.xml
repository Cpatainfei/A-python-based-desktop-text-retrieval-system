   <TEXT> Children in black wool sweaters danced with grandfathers in gray wool stockings , atop the white glistening snow , beneath brilliant blue_sky , swept along in a red_sea of Norwegian flags . The movable_feast slowly made its way_out of the Hajfell Alpine Center here Friday , choruses of &quot; Seieren Er Vaar &quot; ( &quot; Victory is Ours &quot; ) echoing off the mountainside . Lasse Kjus had come_home to win the gold in men ' s Alpine combined , Kjetil Andre Aamodt the silver , Harald Christian Strand-Nilsen the bronze . The Norwegian block party peripherally included American Tommy Moe , the champion with Oslo roots . Moe did not win his third medal , but left nothing at the gate in pursuit , finishing fifth while missing bronze by 0.27 seconds . Kyle Rasmussen , second in the downhill segment on Feb . 14 , had to re-track a gate on his first run and ended_up 31st . &quot; I had a great time in Norway , &quot; said Moe , the downhill champion and super-G silver medalist . &quot; It was the perfect Olympics. &quot; Took the words right out of the host country ' s mouth . Norway ' s feat marked only the third time in Olympic history that a nation had swept an Alpine event . Austria , which swept the women ' s downhill at the 1964 Innsbruck Games , had been the only previous country to sweep on home snow . Never , though , had heroes looked more in need of a nap . Norwegians call their Alpine skiers the Dream Team , although it is less a description of praise than a reminder of their varying states of consciousness . There was some concern Friday what might become of the medals , once they were in the boys ' hands . Kjus , a charter Dream Teamer , has been known to forget to bring his racing suit to events . He was able to recall -- it was nearly a fortnight ago -- that he won the downhill combined and stood poised to take the gold so_long as he could remain standing through the two slalom races . Kjus -- it ' s pronounced shoose , which sounds like schuss -- retained his lead after his first slalom run and skied last among the top contenders in the afternoon , setting_up an emotional run_for the gold , since he knew that two teammates already had secured medals . Aamodt the Great , who skied before Kjus , raced into first with his run , no surprise . The surprise was Strand-Nilsen , 21st after the downhill , who moved_into sixth place with the ninth-fastest first run . On his second , he seized the lead and held it until Aamodt bumped him to second . Then Kjus bounced him to the bronze . Kjus maintained a 1.06-second advantage over Aamodt as he stood_in the gate and basically needed only to stay_on course to win . Seieren Er Vaar . &quot; It felt great standing_up there on the second run , &quot; Kjus said . &quot; Because I already knew we had first and second place. &quot; Kjus did not hold_back , surrendering only . 04 to Aamodt on his second run and winning the combined by 1.02 seconds . After the post-race celebration , the questioned loomed : Would the Norwegians find their way to the press_conference ? Aamodt , who at 22 has won three medals in four Alpine events here and has five Olympic medals in all , has a basic look of sleepy-eyed contentment . He claims tales of his absent-mindedness are exaggerated , although last year , after bragging about his alertness , he stepped into his car and drove_off , leaving his goggles and gloves on the roof . Strand-Nilsen , a rookie Dream Teamer , says the stories of Kjus and Aamodt are accurate . &quot; This morning , I had to wait because Lasse and Kjetil forgot their accreditation ( Olympic identification ) , &quot; Strand-Nilsen said . Well , Aamodt ? &quot; Yes , I forgot my accreditation . We were in the car and had to go_back . Harald is not a member of the Dream Team , so he just sat in the car. &quot; Aamodt does not reveal the strain of one asked to live_up_to enormous expectations . The world ' s best all-around skier was touted as having a chance to win five gold medals . He has had to &quot; settle &quot; for a silver in downhill and combined , and a bronze in the super-G . He has a last chance for gold in Sunday ' s slalom , an event in which he is defending world champion . &quot; People were maybe a little ambitious for me , &quot; Aamodt said . &quot; This year , I have only won two ( World Cup ) races and one combined in 30 races . I would have to win five races in a row in the Olympics . It is not realistic to think like that . Three medals in four events -- that ' s more_than I could have hoped for. &quot; As for Moe , he came_to the Olympics a relative unknown and departs a star , having posted the best performance by an American male skier in any Olympics , two medals and fifth in combined . Moe , not a slalom specialist , said he would have had to &quot; ski my brains out &quot; to win a medal . He almost did . He had a faster first-run slalom time than Luxembourg ' s legendary Marc Girardelli . In the second , Moe finished five-hundredths slower than Aamodt . &quot; Tommy made a heck of a statement today , &quot; said Paul Major , the U.S. Alpine director . &quot; He ' s one of the best skiers in the world. &quot; Major was so thrilled , he said Moe could develop_into an all-event skier within a year and challenge Aamodt . Two weeks ago , Major would have choked on those words . &quot; Everyone would have laughed_at us , &quot; he conceded . But Moe made believers of many . &quot; We knew the guy could ski , &quot; Major said . &quot; He ' s a lot like Aamodt . He can be a four-event skier. &quot; Moe will ski the giant slalom for the first time this season next week , when the World Cup circuit resumes at Aspen , Colo . A different Moe returns home today , to a different America . He has been receiving as_many as 100 fan letters a day at the Olympic village . An electronics_company has already made overtures to his agent about creating a &quot; Tommy Moe Downhill &quot; video computer_game . And back home , Alaska cities are fighting over territorial rights . Is he the downhill champion from Palmer , where he once lived ? There , T-shirts are already on sale , proclaiming Palmer &quot; Moe-Town USA. &quot; Or , is Moe the pride of Girdwood , where he now resides ? Or , is it Montana , where Moe lived as a child ? Moe says he ' ll always be the same old Tommy , except : &quot; I would n ' t mind going_on Letterman. &quot; Producers for David Letterman ' s show had in fact tried to book Moe for a March 1 taping , but Moe had to cancel because of a schedule conflict . Something having to do with a ski_race . Tommy Moe is busting out all_over . He raced Friday in a generic black_and_white race suit because the slalom uniform given him before the Games didn ' t fit . &quot; He ' s grown in stature since he ' s been here , &quot; Major said . &quot; He was a medium . Now he ' s larger. &quot;</TEXT>
