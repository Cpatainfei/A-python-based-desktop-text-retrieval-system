   <HEADLINE> O . C . IN BANKRUPTCY ; AREA BUSINESSES FACE WORRISOME PROSPECTS ; IMPACTS : UNCERTAINTY REGARDING PUBLIC PROJECTS , THE POSSIBILITY OF TAX_HIKES AND HIGHER COUNTY BORROWING COSTS COULD AFFECT BUILDING AND OTHER INDUSTRIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With Orange County ' s bankruptcy came frightening prospects for business . Suddenly , area executives faced uncertainty about upcoming public projects , possible tax increases , higher borrowing costs and a huge blow to Orange County ' s prized public image . No one was certain Wednesday what to make of the bankruptcy . But there was no lack of attention to the crisis . The Irvine Co. , the county ' s largest landowner , said only that executives &quot; are watching the situation closely and will continue to do so. &quot; But for now , said spokeswoman Dawn McCormick , company managers including Chairman Donald Bren do not believe there is anything &quot; constructive or beneficial they could say about the bankruptcy. &quot; Others expressed shock or dismay at the financial crisis , but most said they believed the trouble could be resolved and that the county will stage a complete recovery . County officials helped bolster that optimism by assuring suppliers and vendors that the county would continue making most scheduled payments , along with providing regular public_services , such_as police and fire protection . &quot; It ' s unbelievable that this could happen , &quot; exclaimed Larry Webb , president of Greystone Homes ' South Coast division , which has 600 homes under construction in Orange County . &quot; I thought the county ' s economic decline had bottomed_out . Now I need to wait and see what happens when the dust settles. &quot; Home builder Kathryn Thompson was more sanguine . &quot; I think Orange County still has ample funds and strength , &quot; she said . &quot; The bankruptcy was a prudent course of action to gain breathing room . I think that we all will get_through this if we don ' t panic. &quot; Developers , including the giant Irvine Co. , could be hurt if the bankruptcy curtails local_governments ' future ability to issue bonds to finance the road and sewer construction needed to support real_estate construction . At the company ' s publicly traded Irvine Apartment Communities subsidiary , chief financial_officer Dick Moran said he fielded a number of calls from investment analysts in New York concerned about the bankruptcy ' s impact on the subsidiary ' s stock and on other publicly traded stocks and bonds tied to Orange County . &quot; The consistent theme &quot; in their questions , he said , &quot; is whether there would be significant tax increases to make_up for ( revenue ) shortfalls &quot; because higher taxes would put many Orange County companies at a competitive disadvantage . &quot; It is our hope that this is a onetime financial event that is much like a natural disaster . . . and then the economy reasserts itself and recovers , &quot; Moran said . &quot; I suspect people will realize it is an isolated financial catastrophe that will never occur again. &quot; Roland Osgood , president of Los Angeles builder Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. ' s Orange County division , said his sales staff had received calls all day from buyers and potential buyers worried about what the county crisis would mean to them . &quot; Can they raise my taxes ? &quot; was a big concern , he said , adding that his staff has been assuring callers that &quot; there is really nothing the county can do to raise taxes because of Proposition 13 , &quot; which requires a two-thirds vote_in the general_election to increase property_taxes . County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said in a news_conference late Wednesday that no tax increase is being considered . Osgood worries , however , that the bankruptcy will give Orange County such a black_eye in the financial community that many of the cities and special agencies that issue bonds to build schools , roads , sewers and water_systems will find it difficult to raise money . Such bonds aren ' t linked directly to Orange County ' s credit , he said , &quot; But they do carry the county name . And in the short run , who is going_to touch anything that says O.C. on it ? I think the work will go_ahead , but it will be more expensive. &quot; Economists who specialize in watching Orange County say that the county ' s inherent strengths remain and that the long term looks bright . At Chapman University , where the economic research_center staff was frantically reworking a 1995 forecast scheduled to be released today , economist Esmael Adibi said Wednesday that the bankruptcy will hurt , but shouldn ' t derail the county ' s economic recovery . &quot; Even if the whole impact of the bankruptcy , all_the losses , is realized in one year it would n ' t stop the recovery , &quot; Adibi said , adding that the combined total of all goods and services produced in Orange County next year is projected at nearly $ 83 billion . While many in the business_community declined to speculate about the impacts of the county ' s bankruptcy so soon after the filing , others were generally optimistic : Expect some economic pain in the short term but have confidence for the future . Still , there are concerns about the bankruptcy ' s impact over the next few months on major economic factors like home sales and business expansions and relocations . &quot; We have a substantial image problem on our hands , &quot; said Anil Puri , head of the economic department at Cal State Fullerton . At Disneyland , where officials have been discussing a major expansion that hinges_on substantial public improvements in the surrounding area , spokesman John McClintock said park officials and executives at the Disney Development Co . &quot; remain optimistic &quot; but didn ' t want to &quot; speculate on the possible impacts &quot; of the bankruptcy filing . If the bankruptcy cuts_off funding for proposed freeway improvements and construction of publicly financed parking structures , however , the entire $ 3-billion park expansion could be scrapped . At Fluor Corp. , the international engineering and construction services_firm in Irvine , spokeswoman Deborah Land said officials had concerns that some of the larger projects being proposed for the county could be canceled , including a new football_stadium for the Rams , the Disney expansion and a new county_courthouse . Fluor was considering bids on all_of those projects and now , she said , &quot; we may never know. &quot; Bruce DeVine , chief economist for the Southern California Assn . of Governments , said his immediate concern is how the crisis will affect the 14 # 000 businesses that supply the county with everything from toilet_paper to skilled technicians and consultants . &quot; In a bankruptcy , they have the ability to suspend debt payments , &quot; DeVine said . &quot; They don ' t have to , but they can , and the question is how they will prioritize their debt and who will get paid and who won ' t. &quot; Bruce Bennett , the county ' s bankruptcy attorney , said Wednesday that all payroll and day-to-day operations will continue as normal . Retirees and vendors who receive regular_payments from the county will also be paid on_time , he said . &quot; The checks that are out there now are going_to clear , &quot; Bennett said . All of the ordinary-course activities of the county are going_to continue . That means people are going_to have to be paid to do it. &quot; But Bennett said that ongoing special projects such_as the expansion of Interstate 5 and the building of the San Joaquin Hills toll road , which are dependent upon money currently invested in the fund , may be in more jeopardy . &quot; If the money is invested in the fund for those large projects , for the time being there won ' t be a distribution , &quot; he said . But Aaron Lovejoy , president of Ultratech Resources in Santa Ana , said he has no worries about being paid . He dispatched his usual crew of three workers Wednesday to county offices under a contract to maintain county computer_systems . &quot; We have the full faith and confidence that the county is going_to pull_out of this , &quot; said Lovejoy , whose firm does about $ 3 million in sales a year . The bankruptcy was particularly chilling news in construction union halls around Orange County . Union_members have largely survived the recession because of jobs on public works projects . But the future of many of those projects is in_question and union officials worry that the construction_industry ' s fledgling recovery could sink back into a recession . &quot; It ' s more_than worrisome , it ' s distressful , &quot; said Mike Potts , area representative for the Building and Construction Trades Council . He said that about a third of the 30 # 000 construction union_members in Orange County found employment this year through the publicly funded projects , such_as the ongoing $ 100-million Santa Ana jail project . Southern California Edison and Pacific Bell say they probably will treat the highly unusual filing by the county as if it were simply another bankruptcy by a large corporation . County agencies maintain nearly 800 separate electric accounts and the county ' s overall monthly bill is about $ 1 million . SCE meter readers are canvassing the county to determine how much the county owed when it declared bankruptcy . Typically , when a big corporate customer declares Chapter 11 bankruptcy , SCE protects shareholder and ratepayer interests by asking the bankruptcy court judge to approve a hefty cash down_payment equal_to two months ' billings , said SCE attorney Steve Lopez . Pacific Bell , which is also a general unsecured creditor in the county filing , also generally demands a cash security_deposit equal_to two months ' worth of telephone_bills . &quot; We usually send a letter right away and ask_for that deposit within 20 days , &quot; Britton said . He declined to disclose the size of the county ' s average monthly telephone_bill .</TEXT>
