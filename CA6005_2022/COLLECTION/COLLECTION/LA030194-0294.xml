   <HEADLINE> GLOBOCARS : THE NEXT CENTURY ; THE LAST_FRONTIER FOR SALES ; AUTO MAKERS THE WORLD OVER EYE CHINA LUSTFULLY . YET INEFFICIENCY AND TRADE_BARRIERS HAVE HELPED KEEP ITS POTENTIAL LARGELY UNREALIZED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When General Motors executives in Detroit committed $ 30 million to invest in the Jinbei truck factory in Shenyang , capital of China ' s northeastern Liaoning province , they expected to make a profit in 1993 , the first full year of operation . Things went fine until last summer , when China ' s economy czar , Vice Premier Zhu Rongji , alarmed by the country ' s overheated condition , ordered a clampdown on credit for state enterprises . The effect on the Chinese automobile_industry , which depends almost entirely on state businesses for its orders , was the equivalent of changing the combination on the company safe . Instead of its selling the 25 # 000 Chinese-designed , GM-improved &quot; Gold Cup &quot; pickup_trucks it anticipated , GM-Jinbei ' s orders fell to 15 # 000 . In addition , said GM regional manager Ron Gilchrist , the company managed to sell only 800 of the S-10 model pickups it had brought over in assembly kits to use to train the Shenyang work_force and test the market . The two-door S-10 , priced at a hefty $ 20 # 000 in a country where the annual per capita income is only $ 367 , turned_out to be the wrong product for China . Truck buyers here prefer more passenger space to accommodate large work crews . As a result , GM ' s first major plunge into the Chinese market ended_up in_trouble and deeply in the red . If business does not improve this year , said Gilchrist , the company may be forced to cut some of Jinbei ' s 4 # 000 employees . Layoffs are risky business in China , where workers are accustomed to guaranteed employment under the &quot; iron rice bowl &quot; social_welfare net built_up under 40 years of Communism . In the comfortable , distant boardrooms of the world ' s great auto_makers -- in Detroit , Tokyo and Munich , Germany -- the huge China market looms tantalizingly on the horizon like a shiny red apple , ready to be plucked . China is the world ' s last great automotive frontier . Nowhere else are there so many people and so few cars . Even India , with nowhere near China ' s economic might , has three times as_many private cars . Inevitably , when foreign auto moguls discuss China , the talk turns_to the country ' s fantastic numbers : 1.2 billion people , 20 % of the world ' s population ; a rapidly growing middle_class ; fortunes being made on every street_corner from steamy Hainan Island in the south to the frigid reaches of Manchuria in the north . If only one Chinese person out of 120 bought an automobile , that would be 10 million cars -- a number rivaling the markets of North_America and Western Europe . Chrysler Corp . President Robert Lutz , whose own company has had a rocky experience with its Cherokee Jeep factory in Beijing , recently rated China the No . 1 future growth market in the world , followed by the former East Bloc countries . Yet here on the ground , in the sobering reality of a China that has not quite weaned itself from its state-dominated economy , things are not nearly so bright and promising -- a least in the short term . At last count , there were more_than 125 different motor_vehicle manufacturers in China , more_than in any other country . * They range_in size from the big Volkswagen Santana plant in Shanghai that produces almost half of the country ' s passenger_cars to tiny assembly_lines on remote military bases where vehicles are assembled from components of other car makes , Chinese and foreign . &quot; Some of these plants are like cottage industries with just a roof to keep_out the rain , &quot; said Toshiaki Yasuda , general_manager of Nissan ' s modest China operations . Of all_the world ' s auto_makers , the Japanese have been the most cautious about diving into the China market . &quot; The smaller companies simply buy the components and put_on their own logo , &quot; Yasuda continued . &quot; Sometimes the only original thing on the vehicle is the logo . I ' ve seen some Chinese micro-buses on the streets that look very similar to our own products. &quot; One recent afternoon , the sales lot of the Beijing Agricultural Exhibition_Hall featured a sampling of China ' s output , dozens of barely distinguishable cars and trucks bearing colorful Chinese names like Bright Sun , East_Wind , Liberation , Yellow River , Jade of the Sea , Three Peaks and Golden Dragon . The Chinese industry is also the world ' s least efficient . Nowhere else does_it take more people and more tea_breaks to produce a single car . Japan , the world ' s most productive auto_maker , averages 17 vehicles per employee per year ; U.S. labor productivity is 13 vehicles per employee per year . A recent study by Lo Dic , a University of Leeds economist , reported that China produces only about 0.24 vehicle per employee per year . Put another way , the average annual output of four auto workers in Japan is 68 cars ; in China , the average annual output of four workers is one car . Such amazing inefficiency exists because China is also one of the most protected automobile_industries in the world . Because of hard-currency restrictions , the only entities permitted to buy imported cars are foreign companies and Chinese-foreign joint-venture companies based in China . During recent years , the Chinese government has limited even these imports to 100 # 000 cars per year . Taking_into_account the estimated 100 # 000 foreign cars that are smuggled into China each year , imports account_for about 13 % of the relatively small Chinese market . In addition , China levies duties of 150 % and more on imported cars . That allows Chinese auto_makers , big and small , to offer their products at highly inflated prices . For example , one of the most popular and cheapest passenger_cars on the market , the compact Xia Li ( Charade ) manufactured by Tianjin Minibus Works under license from the Japanese company Daihatsu , retails for more_than $ 11 # 000 . The Chinese-made Audi 100 sedans , favorite transport for China ' s high-ranking Communist elite , sell for a staggering $ 35 # 000 a pop . Despite a_few flashy exceptions in the major cities , the phenomenon of the family car has yet to arrive here . Last year , for example , only 230 # 000 sedans were produced in China . Of these , only 3 % to 5 % were purchased by private individuals . That means the vehicle industry is still largely dependent for its survival on orders from government units . These buyers range from the mighty People ' s Liberation Army to tiny regional and municipal corporations . Late last year , in fact , the central Ministry of Education reported that schoolteachers in many areas were not paid because local authorities had used money dedicated for salaries to buy cars instead . Under such a state-dependent system , sales can be turned_off by the government like water from the tap . &quot; The automobile_industry can ' t look_at China the way Coke or Pepsi does , &quot; said Tony Cevrone , a Chrysler spokesman in Detroit . &quot; The main customers continue to be fleet customers . We have been in China virtually 10 years now , and we still feel we are in the infancy of the market. &quot; Like General Motors with its new Shenyang joint_venture , Chrysler also suffered during the credit_crunch last summer . In 1992 , the Beijing plant produced and sold a record 20 # 000 Jeep Cherokees , producing a handsome profit . The company was_on the same track in 1993 when the central government , concerned about inflation , restricted credit available to state work_units . As a result , orders at Chrysler ' s Beijing Jeep plant fell to about 12 # 000 , a 40 % drop_in one year . &quot; The main problem with the Chinese automobile market , &quot; said a Western diplomat , &quot; is that it is tremendously overpopulated with companies . The companies are all too small , and their costs too high . The market , such_as it is , exists at the expense of Chinese taxpayers. &quot; Despite the many handicaps and frustrations associated with working in China , few foreign auto_makers have resisted entering the market . Except for Chrysler , which inherited its China business when it bought American Motors in 1987 , French and German companies have been the main pioneers . What keeps the companies interested is not the current market but rather the dream that China will someday explode as a market for family-owned automobiles . Fueling this dream is the fact that at least 10 cities in China already have annual per capita incomes of more_than $ 1 # 000 , three times the national average . So far , the most successful foreign venture in China is Shanghai Volkswagen . * One of the peculiarities of the Chinese auto business is that there are virtually no showrooms or sales lots where customers can fondle the upholstery or test-drive the new vehicles . To buy a car in China , the customer is obliged to go_to the factory to make the order . With little or no marketing , however , Shanghai Volkswagen last year produced and sold more_than 100 # 000 four-door Santana sedans from its factory offices . The Santana is a basic six-passenger model not sold in Europe for years . Nonetheless , Volkswagen was able to sell the cars for more_than $ 20 # 000 apiece , reaping a pretax profit of $ 115 million for the German company and its Chinese partners . The key to Volkswagen ' s success , said Peter Loew , the company ' s deputy manager , was getting_into the market earlier , locating in economically booming Shanghai and pairing up with a powerful joint-venture partner , the city of Shanghai itself .
