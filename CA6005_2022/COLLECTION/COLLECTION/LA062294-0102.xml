   <HEADLINE> DANA PARSONS : IN SHAPING CARING SOCIETY , WE CAN PAY NOW OR PAY LATER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Surveys suggest the American public can ' t get enough of the O.J. Simpson murder investigation . Count me in , too . I ' ve read everything so far and have room for more . But , just as a quiz , how interested were you in the front-page story Tuesday about the report that said abused kids are staying_at the Orangewood Children ' s Home much longer than those of 15 years ago ? Did you even read the story ? Did you read that the home is overcrowded and the children there are suffering much worse problems than those of a decade ago ? I ' m asking , not chastising . My guess is that , like most people , your interest in that story was a fraction of your interest in the Simpson saga . And therein lies one of society ' s great and lingering problems -- we ' re only interested in how things turn_out , not how they start . The people in social_services know an ugly little truth -- that many of tomorrow ' s front-page crime and violence stories have already taken_root . As we all know , Simpson has been charged with killing his ex-wife , Nicole . The investigation already has raised the issue of whether stronger intervention in their earlier domestic problems may have prevented her death . The Orangewood report deals with_child abuse , but experts in the field say that , just as with domestic violence , early intervention can make a difference on child abusers , too . The stakes are staggering , because Orange County reported 36 # 721 incidents of child_abuse in 1993 . As recently as 1990 , the figure was 28 # 364 . Kathy McCarrell , executive_director of the Child_Abuse Prevention Center in Costa Mesa , said numerous studies indicate that prisons are overwhelmingly populated by adults abused as children . She maintains that programs for early intervention and prevention have never been tried_on a massive scale . &quot; A certain percentage , and it would be difficult to say what percentage , would take that early intervention and make_it something positive , &quot; she said . &quot; Some won ' t , and that may have more to do with how bad the scarring was , mixed with their ability to overcome it. &quot; Her center matches volunteers with troubled families . The volunteers spend at least two hours a week with the family , for up_to a year , in an effort to reverse the abusive behavior . Seventy families are involved now , and another 70 could easily be found if enough volunteers were available , she said . Just as with_child abuse , earlier and more meaningful intervention could slow the onslaught of domestic-violence cases , she said . If authorities are correct about Simpson ' s involvement , McCarrell said , his violent behavior may have been curbed had he been forced to attend group therapy or receive treatment . Emphasizing that she wasn ' t referring to Simpson specifically or commenting on his guilt or innocence , McCarrell said , &quot; Kids who grow_up seeing domestic violence are more likely to become perpetrators or victims ( as adults ) . We ' ve seen that generational cycle , so intervention in the spousal abuse cycle would certainly affect the next generation of spousal abuse. &quot; To social_service professionals , the link between violent childhood experiences and adult behavior is so obvious as_to sound tiresome to repeat . Irene Briggs , a supervisor with the Orange County Child_Abuse Registry , has repeated the mantra a_thousand times , which makes the shortage of early intervention especially maddening to her . &quot; When you look_at what it costs society to intervene afterward , &quot; she says , referring to both child_abuse and domestic violence , &quot; it would have cost a lot less if there had been intervention earlier with families and with adults . We ' re willing to spend a whole_lot of money to build Orangewood and a whole_lot of money to build prisons , but we could spend a whole_lot less money and make real dramatic changes in families if we did prevention. &quot; And yet , she knows that isn ' t jazzy enough to move society . &quot; The public doesn ' t get_it , &quot; Briggs said . &quot; Maybe they ' ll start getting_it now . I hope I live long enough to see it. &quot; Who knows whether prevention and early intervention will ever be glamorous enough to grab our attention . Maybe the terms or the concepts are just too starchy for mass consumption . Who knows , maybe we ' re content to wait for the screaming headlines from future front pages to remind us of our failings .</TEXT>
