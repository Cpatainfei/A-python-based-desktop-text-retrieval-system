   <HEADLINE> COUNTDOWN TO THE WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ' 94 ; BUT CAN THEY FORGET ? ; WHETHER GOOD TIMES OR SAD , BLAIR AND JANSEN IGNORING PAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Another Winter_Olympics , another gold medal or two for Bonnie Blair ? Another Winter_Olympics , another 16 days of despair for Dan Jansen ? History leads us to wonder if that again will be the theme for U.S. speedskaters in the competition at Hamar ' s Olympic Hall , a unique indoor arena designed to resemble an overturned Viking ship . But although their Olympic moments could not be more different , both Blair and Jansen are determined not to dwell_on the past . The only time Blair looks behind her is to see who is gaining , and even though no one has passed her for any significant length of time , she imagines hordes of Chinese , South_Koreans and Germans on her heels . Jansen looks only one way , straight ahead . That was the lesson he learned two years ago , when he was constantly reminded in interviews about the death of his sister , Jane , of leukemia on the morning of his first race in the 1988 Winter Games at Calgary , Canada . It was a story told over and over to a sympathetic worldwide television audience : He skated hours later in the 500 meters , fell , returned to the ice four days later in the 1 # 000 , the day he would return home for the funeral , and fell again . A gold-medal contender in both races four years later in the Winter_Olympics at Albertville , France , Jansen was haunted by the memory of his sister , or at least by the relentless questions about her death , and further impeded by slushy track conditions , he finished fourth in the 500 and an embarrassing 26th in the 1 # 000 . At a news_conference earlier this winter , Milwaukee Journal columnist Michael Baumann began a question with , &quot; Dan , you ' ve won everything in speedskating but one thing . . . &quot; Interrupting , Jansen good-naturedly asked : &quot; And what would that happen to be , Mike ? &quot; Jansen , 28 , has taken that approach in all interviews this winter , deflecting any attempts to discuss past Winter_Olympics . &quot; On race days , I know what I have to do , whereas before I would go_into races maybe too relaxed , &quot; he said during the recent U.S. Olympic trials in Milwaukee . &quot; I still go_into races relaxed , but it has to be aggressive relaxation. &quot; Were you too relaxed , he was asked , in 1992 ? &quot; No , &quot; he said , &quot; but let ' s not talk_about ' 92. &quot; His coach , however , will talk_about it . &quot; We ' re not looking_at it like we did_in ' 92 , when we said we ' re just out here to compete and do the best we can , while in the back of our minds we were thinking we wanted to win a medal , &quot; said Peter Mueller , American gold medalist in the 1 # 000 meters in 1976 . &quot; This time , we ' re not fooling ourselves , saying one thing and thinking something else . I ' ve put a lot of pressure on D.J. in the last six months . We ' re telling people we want to win that medal . If we don ' t win , well , life goes_on . But that ' s definitely our focus. &quot; The approach has worked so far . In the first major international competition inside Hamar ' s Olympic Hall last December , Jansen became the first man to skate 500 meters in under 36 seconds , breaking the barrier twice on the same weekend . It could be argued that his historic times were attributable to the fast track in the Viking Ship , a multipurpose facility that designers joke is adaptable for every sport except ice fishing . Particularly suitable for speedskating , seven world_records have been set there in the last two months . But Jansen has been fast on every track this winter . Two weeks ago in the world sprint championships at Calgary , he again lowered the record , to 35.76 seconds . He also has skated impressive times in the 1 # 000 . &quot; He ' s mentally better than I ' ve ever seen him , &quot; Mueller said . &quot; I think he knows this is his last Olympics , and he knows what he wants to do. &quot; So does Blair . She has her sights set_on a three-peat as the gold medalist in the 500 and a repeat in the 1 # 000 . But that is only because she always wants to win and not because her fourth and fifth gold medals would distinguish her as the United States ' most decorated female Olympian . U.S. women with four gold medals are track sprinter Evelyn Ashford , swimmer Janet Evans and diver Pat McCormick . &quot; I guess those are things you guys think_about , &quot; she told reporters this winter . &quot; I can ' t really think_about that because if I start thinking_about that , that ' s going_to take_away from trying to accomplish what I want to do out there . &quot; I think that ' s one of the reasons I ' ve had the success I ' ve had : Concentrate_on that race at that time . that ' s all you can think about. &quot; After winning two gold medals in 1992 , Blair , 29 , thought age might be catching_up_with her when she did not dominate the sprints last year . But she changed coaches , from Mueller to former sprinter Nick Thometz , and that has revitalized her . &quot; She ' s been doing the same thing for so_long that motivation can be a problem , &quot; Thometz said . &quot; I ' ve tried some different things with her . I think it ' s been a plus. &quot; Blair plans to compete through next year . Asked if 30 is too old to race , she said : &quot; Oh , no . No , no , no. &quot; If she has any regret about her career , it is that she has been so focused , she has not had time for a life outside it . She has a boyfriend , speedskater David Cruikshank , but they are noncommittal when asked about marriage plans . &quot; I ' ve probably struggled with that more this year than anything else , &quot; she said . &quot; Put everything aside , go_to the rink , come_back and eat lunch , lie on the couch , go_back to the rink again and do whatever your next workout is , come_back home , eat dinner , watch TV , go_to_bed . &quot; I see my friends running_around with kids . Everything has changed for them , and I ' m still the same. &quot; One close friend she envies is Jansen , who has been able to successfully blend his career with his family life . Last year , he and his wife , Robin , had their first child , a daughter . They named her Jane , for his late sister .</TEXT>
