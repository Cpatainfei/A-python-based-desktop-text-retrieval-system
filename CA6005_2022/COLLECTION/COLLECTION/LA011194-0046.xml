   <TEXT> Under the bridge in Klong Toey ' s massive slum and around Bangkok ' s railway_station , Thai boys gather nightly . Preteen labor is illegal in Thailand , but these kids work in shoe factories , gas_stations or fisheries , even heavy labor . Others are child prostitutes or live_off petty crime . Many are homeless . The boys roughhouse , play with popguns and wait for &quot; tricks , &quot; victims or employers who look_for cheap labor at the rail station . Sniffing glue and paint thinner is now chronic in this age_group . Child labor has long been a problem in Asia , but social_workers claim figures are soaring , despite government efforts , as Thailand presses to join the list of newly industrialized countries , or NICs . &quot; Becoming an NIC is destroying the social fabric of this society . And the kids are paying the highest price , &quot; said Rotjana Phraesrithong of the Foundation for Slum Child_Care in Klong Toey . * In Latvia , the children show_up in Riga ' s quaintly restored old town in the late afternoon . None looks older than about 7 . Among a group of four boys , one has no socks and all wear only light sweaters , despite the cold in northern_Europe . With their hands outstretched , the boys trail people leaving Latvia ' s new privatized hotels , boutiques and restaurants . Late at night , they loiter under the bright lights of a new casino . Both Latvian and Russian children now beg on Riga ' s streets , explained Dmitri Yeryomin , a young interpreter , with embarrassment . &quot; This is all new_to us . We didn ' t have beggars in the past . In the Communist days , the state took_care of everyone , &quot; Yeryomin added . &quot; Now it ' s everyone for himself. &quot; * For all_of its scientific and technical advances , the world at the end of the 20th Century is producing millions of children who have little hope of normal life , much less of leading the world into the 21st . And many of the underlying causes today are otherwise-heralded forces of global change : new free markets , new political_systems and new rights of people to speak , act or associate freely , and of nations to determine their own destiny . &quot; The view that the Cold_War has gone_out with a whimper rather than a bang , and that one side has won with hardly_a shot being fired , is the first and most dangerous placebo of the new age , &quot; according to &quot; The State of the World ' s Children 1994 , &quot; the yearly survey of the U.N. Children ' s Fund ( UNICEF ) . ( See chart on Page 5. ) &quot; The Cold_War has been more destructive than any war in human history ; it has been a war in which there have been no winners and a war of which the severest consequences may yet be to come. &quot; The picture is not all bleak , of course . Unprecedented breakthroughs were made during the Cold_War . Indeed , until the late 1980s the 3 billion children worldwide had never been better_off by many measures . Since World_War_II , deaths of children under 5 have been halved . The number of Third_World children who start school has risen from less than half to more_than 75 % -- despite a doubling of the population . And 60 % of rural families now have access to safe water -- up from less than 10 % , UNICEF said . Just since the mid-1980s , the largest peacetime collaboration in history has provided child immunization throughout the developing world . The program saves about 10 # 000 lives a day , more_than 3 million a year , UNICEF reports . Deaths from measles , for example , dropped from 2.5 million in 1980 to about a_million a year now . Overall , 70 % to 80 % of all children now have their basic needs in health and sanitation met , according to Save the Children . Laws on issues such_as maternity leave and working conditions are also giving new attention and weight to children ' s rights worldwide . Among the most progressive is Norway ' s law allowing a mother to take a year off work_at 80 % pay after birth -- or the same conditions for a father if the mother opts to return to work . &quot; We have made more global human progress in the last 50 years than in the previous 2000 . Three-quarters of the world ' s population now enjoy the basics of a life of dignity , productivity and health , &quot; said James P . Grant , UNICEF ' s executive_director . At the same time , however , many changes since the great , global , sociopolitical upheaval that began in 1989 are seriously threatening progress . The new_world order is turning_out to be particularly hard on the young . First and foremost , children are increasingly victims in a growing pattern of internal urban conflict on four continents . In Bosnia-Herzegovina , the plight of 5-year-old Irma Hadzimuratovic , her body torn by shrapnel in an attack that killed her mother , inspired an airlift last summer -- though not until after hundreds of other children died . ( Despite treatment in London , Irma was paralyzed. ) Post-Cold War turmoil is also leaving deep scars on children from tiny Tajikistan in the former Soviet bloc to huge Zaire in the belly of Africa , from exotic Kashmir to mountainous Afghanistan . After the superpowers stopped exploiting its territorial and tribal divisions for surrogate conflict , Angola ' s civil strife grew even nastier , reputedly killing about 1 # 000 children monthly in 1993 . Since the Soviet demise , children have been hostages in the conflict between Christian Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis over Nagorno-Karabakh . &quot; Many of the dreams of the post-Cold War era were put_on hold as rivals in a host of countries pursued ethnic , religious , territorial and political differences at the point of a gun . Children were among the first to suffer , &quot; UNICEF warned in a recent report . Victims of War The dangers in post-Cold War hot spots aren ' t just physical . For children , &quot; the psychological damage caused by war can be even more devastating , &quot; UNICEF added . About 70 # 000 children remain in Sarajevo , while a_million refugees from Yugoslavia ' s multifaceted conflict are under 18 . Whether injured , threatened or forced to flee , all face trauma from loss of health , family , home or country . By mid-1993 , the rape of Bosnian women by Serbian forces -- atrocities redefining the term &quot; child victims &quot; -- led to the births of hundreds of babies , nearly all_of whom face life as outcasts . On top of 18 million refugees , post-Cold War upheavals have led to the displacement of about 25 million people within their own countries . At least half in both categories are children , according to Judy Mayotte , chairwoman of the Women ' s Commission for Refugee Women and Children in New York . &quot; Internally displaced children are a glaring problem that has grown with global change since the 1980s . But they don ' t have the recognition as refugees because they ' re supposedly protected by a government -- which is often party to the problem , &quot; Mayotte said . &quot; This is going_to be the situation in a lot of places in the post-Cold War world , as other uprisings and internal conflicts break_out , and as countries refuse or turn_back refugees. &quot; Hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled northern Iraq after a failed 1991 uprising against President Saddam Hussein -- only to be held at the Turkish and Iranian borders . Children particularly succumbed to malnutrition , disease and frostbite . Due_to problems from societal breakdowns , UNICEF spent $ 170 million in 1992 on humanitarian aid in more_than 50 states -- the most since the post-World War II emergency and three times the 1990 level . No More Safety Net Abrupt political transitions are also weakening or eliminating the safety net of state protection . Economic reforms are unleashing cutthroat competition , an intense new version of survival of the fittest . And social transformations are altering rules of the game . Again , children often bear the brunt . In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc , transitions from socialist rule have removed everything from guaranteed incomes to state health and welfare services , affecting children the most . Many now face problems virtually unknown during seven decades of socialist rule , from medical neglect allowing old diseases like polio to make big comebacks in Bulgaria to the homelessness forcing children to camp_out and panhandle in Russian subways . Since the 1989 revolution , poverty has become so pervasive in Romania that most families spend 80 % of their income on food , and about 4 # 000 children were left at orphanages in 1992 . After years of declines , the rate of infant_mortality rose 3 % -- and is now more_than double the European average , the Health Ministry said . &quot; The post-Cold War world is not better for millions of children . They ' re less protected than before , and they ' re more vulnerable due_to political and economic transitions , &quot; said Horst Habenicht , who runs the International_Labor_Organization ' s ( ILO ) new International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor . &quot; The transition from planned economies to private market_economies often means the social framework no longer exists in these countries , so there ' s little protection for people in_general , and often none for children at all. &quot; Transitions from right-wing rule_in Latin_America , much of which became democratic for the first time in 1991 , have also marred children ' s lives . Peru is a classic case . New freedoms have not resulted in greater prosperity . Foreign debt , privatization and stiffer economic competition from free-market forces have instead increased poverty . Five million children , nearly a quarter of the entire population , now live_in extreme poverty , UNICEF reported . &quot; A major challenge in the 1990s is to find ways to make structural adjustments with a human_face to cushion the vulnerable parts of society from the drastic effects of economic transitions , &quot; said Ken Kloten , executive_director of Defense for Children International . &quot; We want these adjustments to ensure a free citizenry and for continued growth of democracy around the world -- which is good for kids . But it will require resources , and we ' re living at a time that dollars are increasingly scarce for development aid. &quot; One byproduct is a growing class of uneducated outcasts who prey on the system to survive . The magnitude is numbing . In Latin_America , a record 40 million children are abandoned or homeless . Seven million are in Brazil , the World_Health_Organization said . Nairobi ' s young street population rose from 16 # 000 in 1989 to 25 # 000 , the U.N. Development Program reported . In Manila , 75 # 000 children are homeless , while Bombay , Calcutta and New Delhi each have 100 # 000 . Numbers are also soaring in Eastern Europe . As numbers grow , public sympathy wanes and backlash widens . &quot; Street children are automatically regarded_as criminal suspects by many law_officers and are often subjected_to harassment , threats or violent attacks , &quot; Amnesty International reported . Last July , eight Brazilian boys , ages 11 to 17 , were shot in cold blood in Rio de Janeiro . Four police_officers were arrested for their murders . Since 1990 , about 4 # 600 street children have been killed in Brazil . &quot; These children are a product of the breakdown of family support_systems that come_with population growth and migration to cities . As grim as life was in many villages , at least children had an extended_family to rely_on and a traditional way_of_life that gave meaning to their existence , &quot; said Dr. Charles MacCormack , president of Save the Children . Brazil isn ' t alone . As part of an anti-crime campaign by vigilantes , Colombian posters announced the &quot; extermination of delinquents &quot; and invited Bogota ' s 10 # 000 vagrant children to attend their own funerals in 1993 , according to Amnesty International . In 1991 alone , about 2 # 800 children were murdered in Colombia , Amnesty added . Worldwide , according to Defense for Children International , youngsters were victims of extrajudicial or arbitrary executions in 22 states last year . Back to Work Another characteristic of the new order is that after declining for decades , the frequency of child labor is again on the increase , particularly in the developing world . The ILO estimates that one in four children between the ages of 10 and 14 now work in Third_World countries . The total is in the hundreds of millions . On a still-sweltering winter day , Klong Toey ' s clay dirt alleys were empty_of children . Only toddlers , some with childhood pigtails , played outside . Mothers were in short supply , too . At least 5 million Thai children , beginning at age 7 , now work , said Chira Hongladarom , executive_director of Bangkok ' s Human Resources Institute . More_than 60 % of Thai mothers also work . &quot; Economic growth over the past seven years has had a negative impact on the social_system , particularly family structure . Children , now part of the productive process , are treated as economic goods rather than society ' s future , &quot; he said . &quot; The trend is happening despite -- or perhaps because of -- the modernizing process of international trade and investment , &quot; added Robert Sensor in a 1993 Freedom House report . In many NICs , human_rights are secondary to economics in the name of development . Children reportedly constitute 18 % of Brazil ' s work_force . Child labor is widespread in Africa , particularly in agriculture . An estimated 12 million children work in populous Nigeria . But Asia has the most child labor . In India alone , 44 million children work , the ILO estimates . One of four Indian workers is under age 14 . In Indonesia , conservative figures claim that 2.4 million children between ages 10 and 14 work . Along China ' s eastern provinces , site of an economic boom , children have left school in droves for jobs in new factories , Sensor said . The problem was illustrated dramatically in a 1992 fire at a fireworks factory : most of 20 workers killed were between 9 and 14 years old . The issue is not just age , but conditions and pay . In Thailand , girls work 12-hour days in textile shops . They earn as little as 5 cents for sewing on 100 buttons , or 10 cents for wrapping 100 silk flower stems , according to Bangkok ' s Foundation for Child Development . One-third work for less than minimum_wage , Hongladarom added . &quot; Child labor is the single most important source of child_abuse and child exploitation in the world , &quot; according to Michel Hansenne , ILO director general . Again , new freedoms have contributed to the problem . &quot; In socialist systems , the state organized work and excluded children . Now , free markets and private employers try to get the cheapest labor . With the state ' s role diminished , and no social protection or legislation in place , child labor is growing , &quot; Habenicht said . Many countries in transition still haven ' t finished new constitutions or basic reforms , so meaningful legislation codifying children ' s rights , treatment and living or working conditions is a decade or more away . Enforcement will take even longer , he said . The problem of child labor , however , has an even darker side . In the late 20th Century , 200 million child laborers work in slavery , forced child labor or debt bondage , an ILO study reported . Slave raiders in Asia , Africa and Latin_America kidnap or buy children into lifelong bondage , it charged . Slaves as young as 6 work_up to 18 hours a day . In Haiti , more_than 100 # 000 children , known as restaveks , have been sold or given_away to work as domestics . The most common form of slave labor is child prostitution . India reportedly has up_to 400 # 000 child prostitutes , Brazil a quarter of a_million , the Philippines 60 # 000 and Sri Lanka 30 # 000 , many sold by families or trapped by debt bondage . In Thailand , at least 800 # 000 girls , some as young as 8 , work as prostitutes . Pakistan has up_to 7.5 million children in modern slavery , the ILO reported . In India , several million children between ages 5 and 14 are in &quot; chronic bondage &quot; in agriculture , a_million in construction , brick-making and quarry work , and several hundred_thousand in carpet and jewelry industries , according to Kailash Satyarthi , chairman of South Asia Coalition on Child Servitude . In Brazil , escravidade branca , or white slavery , is common in rural_areas , while debt bondage -- enganche or &quot; the hook &quot; -- is a problem in Peru ' s mines , the ILO said . Treated as &quot; expendable , &quot; child slaves worldwide often get dangerous jobs . Education or prospects of betterment are nonexistent . Any semblance of childhood disappears . Technology and Disease Technological developments and new health plagues in the late 20th Century are also leaving a lasting impact on children . One of the worst manifestations was the 1993 birth in Moldova of a baby with two heads , two hearts , two lungs , two spinal_cords but one set of limbs . Doctors blamed it on radiation from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear_reactor disaster in neighboring Ukraine . Doctors in the area reported up_to a 30 % increase in birth_defects as well as a dramatic rise in the incidence of thyroid cancer among children after Chernobyl . Because technology now discerns gender , children elsewhere don ' t have a chance at life ; thousands of Chinese and Indian women abort female fetuses in societies favoring boys . The AIDS pandemic , spread globally in a relatively short time thanks to modern transportation , is both killing children and creating orphans . Among the offspring of HIV-positive pregnant women , one out of three babies is likely to be infected and eventually die of AIDS ; two will be orphaned when the mothers die , said Mechai Viravaidya , chairman of Bangkok ' s Population and Community Development Assn . Uganda has produced 1.5 million AIDS orphans in the past decade . In Thailand , 10 # 000 pregnant , HIV-positive women in 1992 were expected to eventually produce 6 # 500 orphans -- doubling in a year the total number of orphans under state care_for other reasons . In 1993 , pregnant and HIV-positive Thai women doubled to 20 # 000 , Viravaidya said . One of AIDS ' most lasting legacies may be a world awash with a generation of orphans . A UNICEF report , &quot; AIDS : The Second Decade , &quot; estimates nearly 10 million children will be orphaned by AIDS by 2000 -- a prediction some experts now believe to be conservative . Yet children ' s problems at the close of the 20th Century are most distinctive because they ' re largely preventable . Most of the 13 million child deaths in 1992 , for example , could have been avoided . &quot; Somewhere between 500 million and 1 billion children are still facing malnutrition , disease and death , mainly because we can ' t mobilize what we need to help them , &quot; MacCormack of Save the Children said . &quot; It was understandable when we didn ' t have solutions . But now we know what to do . One of the greatest frustrations is to know technology and management are there to eliminate 60 % to 70 % of remaining child poverty at a reasonable cost , but the political will and public_knowledge aren ' t there to make_it happen. &quot; And dangers grow as nations both big and small engage in economic and social triage . In 1993 , for example , Washington eliminated aid to 21 states , many where children endure the worst conditions . &quot; We ' ve hit a plateau in our ability to reduce many problems because we ' re using the same or fewer resources than in the past , &quot; Kloten said . &quot; Between resource problems and global change , the situation in many places will get_worse before it gets better. &quot;</TEXT>
