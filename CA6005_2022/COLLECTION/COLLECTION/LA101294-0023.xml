   <HEADLINE> AN APOCALYPTIC VISION FINDS A LOGICAL , TRAGIC END ; RELIGION : SOLAR TEMPLE MEMBERS FORESAW ENVIRONMENTAL DOOM AS THE POST-COLD WAR END .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The deaths of more_than 50 members of the Order of the Solar Temple in Switzerland and Quebec remain obscure , the motives as yet tangled and the perpetrators unclear . But whether the deaths were the result of murder , suicide or some combination of the two , it is still possible to make some preliminary observations . However tangled the motives for the deaths , the Solar Temple had a following -- and the existence of this following compels us to seriously examine the group ' s beliefs . Foremost among those beliefs was the conviction that an overwhelming , imminent cosmic disaster was inevitable ; its vast destruction the necessary prelude to anticipated world transformation . This apocalyptic vision of the Earth on the edge of a final calamity is by now a familiar theme among millenarian groups . The Solar Temple , however , was distinctive in part because it drew its apocalyptic vision of the end of history from unusual sources . Unlike more widespread Christian millennialism , the Solar Temple drew from occultism and ecological doomsayers . Religious fundamentalism remains a major source of apocalyptic ideas and imagery , but they may also be found in the occult and New Age , in neo-Malthusian social thought and in scientific predictions of environmental collapse . Scenarios of ecological disaster have become particularly prominent among contemporary apocalyptic sectarians , especially those influenced by New Age ideas . At a time when many natural disasters have lost their power to shock , and the end of the Cold_War has reduced fears of a nuclear holocaust , environmental disasters emerge as a potent expression that the world is ending . While the attraction of apocalyptic sects is in part attributable to the charisma of leaders like the Solar Temple ' s Luc Jouret , the beliefs themselves figure importantly in the decision of adherents to give themselves totally to such affiliations . The Solar Temple appears to have had a core of highly committed members , recruited through Jouret ' s practice of creating organizations within organizations , so that as their commitment grew , followers could move to more demanding inner_circles of the movement . Both the beliefs themselves and a structure of organizations nested within one another reflect a principal reason for the appeal of such groups -- the belief among members that they and they alone know the true nature of reality . This secret knowledge exerts a powerful appeal , while at_the_same_time offering a convenient explanation for why the group has failed to attract a mass membership . The general population is deemed too ignorant , deceived or spiritually impoverished to grasp the message . Sect members also believe they are the elite who will enjoy and perhaps rule_in the perfect new existence that will follow the predicted catastrophe . The Solar Temple experience reaffirms the volatility of those millenarian and apocalyptic groups that organize in physically isolated communal settlements . Such separation can have potent consequences . By severing ties to the larger environment , members cut themselves off from information that might contradict their beliefs . Withdrawal often produces factionalism within the group , and rivalries over leadership are a common result . Lastly , separation often embroils a group in the very society it despises and seeks to escape . Its withdrawal may stimulate suspicion by the authorities and sometimes leads to clashes between communal millenarians and the authorities . Disputes erupt over weapons , taxes , the treatment of children and other issues where the demands of the state collide_with a group ' s claims to a separate existence . Millenarian groups have a centuries-long history in the West . Such activity ebbs and flows , although the proximity to the year 2000 helps explain the present heightened interest . The decimal_system , with its round numbers , leads us to invest dates that end in zeros with special significance . Nowhere is this clearer than in the millennial year that approaches . Hence , for all its strangeness , the Solar Temple is emblematic of a rising cultural mood that sees a historic watershed in the year 2000 . The proliferation of millenarian groups has not been matched by a more sophisticated understanding of their character . Instead , they tend to be lumped together as cults , dismissed as inherently disreputable , manipulative and irrational . In fact , despite their common belief in imminent transformation , they often differ dramatically . The vast majority of members of millenarian groups join them and remain in them out of conviction , believing them to make_sense of the world . Classifying the groups as cults substitutes a pejorative label for understanding .</TEXT>
