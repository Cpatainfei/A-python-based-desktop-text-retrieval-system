   <TEXT> A successful butterfly garden must include plants that meet their needs during all four stages of their life_cycle -- egg , caterpillar , chrysalis and adult . &quot; Plants are important to butterflies during each stage of their life_cycle . A garden designed with this in mind attracts the largest_number and greatest variety of butterfly visitors , &quot; states a report from Callaway Gardens of Georgia on how to create a butterfly garden . Rule No . 1 is &quot; locate the garden in a sunny area ( since ) butterflies and most butterfly-attracting plants require bright sunshine. &quot; Next , choose plants with nectar-producing flowers , preferably those with single flowers , and try_for continuous bloom throughout the growing season . &quot; Butterflies visit plants in search of nectar , a sugary fluid , to eat . Many native butterflies seem to prefer purple , yellow , orange and red-colored blossoms . Clusters of short , tubular flowers or flat-topped blossoms provide the ideal shapes for butterflies to easily land and feed , &quot; according to the Callaway experts . Single-flower nectar is easier for them to extract than that of double-type flowers , which have more petals per flower . Sure-fire hits for nectar sources are : Shrubs : azaleas , butterfly_bush ( Buddleia davidii ) , glossy abelia ( Abelia grandiflora ) and bush and trailing lantanas ( L . camara and L . montevidensis ) . Annuals : cosmos , French_marigold ( Tagetes patula ) , heliotrope , impatiens , tithonia , zinnia , moss verbena ( Verbena tenuisecta ) and Egyptian star-cluster ( Pentas lanceolata ) . Perennials : New England aster ( A . novae-angliae ) , coneflower ( Echinacea purpurea ) , pineapple sage ( Salvia rutilans ) , eupatorium , Phlox_subulata , vervain ( Verbena bonariensis ) and verbena ( V . canadensis ) . Butterflies also need host plants , which provide food for caterpillars and lure the females into the garden to lay eggs . &quot; After mating , female butterflies search for a specific kind of host plant on which to lay eggs . &quot; For example , monarchs lay eggs_on milkweed , black swallowtails on parsley and Eastern tiger swallowtails on tulip_tree or wild_cherry , &quot; reports Callaway Gardens , in Pine Mountain , Ga . Also recommended are damp areas or shallow puddles , so the butterflies can drink and extract salts from moist soil , and flat stones , which allow them to perch , spread their wings and bask in the sun . Concerned about damage from the caterpillars , which emerge in a_few days from the eggs and begin to eat ? &quot; Caterpillars are selective eaters and only feed_on specific kinds of plants , &quot; Callaway says . &quot; If the desired plants aren ' t available , the caterpillars will starve rather than eat another type of vegetation . Usually female butterflies lay eggs_on or near the plants their caterpillars prefer to eat . Most butterfly caterpillars feed_on native plants and are not considered agricultural or ornamental pests. &quot; When the caterpillars are fully grown , they shed their skin for a final time and change into chrysalides , which develop_into the body of an adult butterfly . The chrysalides often are found attached_to plant stems . One caution : Most garden pesticides are toxic to butterflies , so &quot; use predatory insects , insecticidal soap or hand-remove the pests if problems occur. &quot; For further reading , Callaway Gardens suggests &quot; Butterflies and Moths &quot; by R.T. Mitchell and H.S. Zim ( Golden Press , 1987 ) ; &quot; The Audubon Society Handbook for Butterfly Watchers &quot; by R . M . Pyle ( Charles Scribner ' s Sons , 1984 ) , and &quot; The Butterfly Book &quot; by Donald and Lillian Stokes and Ernest Williams ( Little , Brown and Company , 1991 ) .</TEXT>
