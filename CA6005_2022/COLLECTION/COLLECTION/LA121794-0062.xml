   <TEXT> Your editorial ( Dec . 4 ) was an excellent survey of the continued threat of additional states obtaining nuclear_weapons and the role of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in preventing this . But your statement that the NPT &quot; seeks to freeze at five the number of states that have nuclear_weapons &quot; may lead some readers to believe that the treaty authorizes indefinite possession of nuclear_weapons by the five original nuclear_weapons states . A subsequent reference_to &quot; full nuclear disarmament &quot; only implies that the five countries must give_up their nuclear_weapons . Indeed the NPT clearly calls_for nuclear disarmament by all states . But during the 30 years of the treaty there has been virtually no discussion of nuclear disarmament . The irrational nuclear arms race occurred and so many nuclear bombs were built that even after the bilateral U.S.-Russian START I and II and the INF agreements to reduce nuclear_weapons are completed there will still be more strategic nuclear bombs than before the NPT . The recently announced conclusions of the U.S. nuclear policy review include keeping 6 # 000 nuclear bombs and finding new uses for them . It would not be surprising if many readers believe that the 164 countries that have signed the NPT approve of our continued possession of nuclear_weapons . Your editorial notes that even most experts feel we should keep a &quot; light missile shield &quot; to deter nuclear_weapons proliferation despite their near-unanimous support of the NPT . It is important for U.S. citizens to know that top U.S. generals have stated that nuclear_weapons have no military usefulness , even as a deterrent against those of other nations ; our overwhelming non-nuclear military superiority makes them unnecessary . An important action we should take is to affirm our compliance with the NPT by announcing a date for initiating negotiations for international nuclear disarmament . This would help dissuade other nations from obtaining nuclear_weapons . EARL BUDIN MD , Santa Barbara</TEXT>
