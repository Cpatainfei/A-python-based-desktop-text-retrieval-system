   <HEADLINE> U.S. OFFICIALS URGE OPIATE USE TO EASE CANCER PAIN IF NEEDED ; MEDICINE : FEARS OF ADDICTION TO PAINKILLERS ARE UNFOUNDED , A HEALTH_CARE AGENCY REPORTS . IT SAYS VERY OLD AND VERY YOUNG OFTEN ARE UNDERTREATED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cancer patients should receive opiates if necessary to control pain , and the fear of addiction should not be an obstacle to access , federal health officials said Wednesday . &quot; Perhaps the most persistent barrier to effective pain control is the unfounded belief &quot; that using such drugs will result in addiction , the Agency for Health_Care Policy and Research said as it issued new clinical practice guidelines for managing cancer pain . The agency , part of the Department of Health and Human Services , challenged this and several other long-held assumptions that it said have impeded efforts to ease the often considerable pain experienced by those battling cancer . Cancer is diagnosed in more_than 1 million Americans annually , and more_than 8 million either have cancer or a history of the disease . Pain can result from a tumor pressing_on bone , nerves or body organs , or from treatment . Not everyone experiences pain but , in those who do , &quot; unrelieved pain can produce unnecessary suffering , &quot; and can affect &quot; a patient ' s ability to cope physically and psychologically &quot; with the illness and the therapy , the agency said . The guidelines will be widely distributed to physicians , nurses and other professionals involved in cancer care and to hospitals , hospices , cancer patient advocacy groups and others . A special panel that drafted the guidelines said careful dosing and administration of the drugs , followed by tapering_off once the medication no longer is needed , would prevent addiction . &quot; There ' s this tremendous confusion about addiction and substance_abuse in this country -- confusing people involved in street crimes with the legitimate use of morphine and other opiates for pain relief , &quot; said Dr. Richard Payne of the M . D . Anderson Cancer Center in Houston , co-chairman of the panel that drafted the guidelines . &quot; We reviewed the scientific evidence exhaustively , &quot; Payne said . &quot; There is very little or no evidence to support the fact that people who take these drugs for pain relief become addicted. &quot; The agency also debunked the idea that the very old and very young are less sensitive to pain than other age_groups . People in those age_groups are frequently undertreated -- the young because they are often unable to orally communicate their pain and the elderly because of the notion that pain is a normal part of_aging , the agency said . The panel called_for an aggressive approach to pain management but recommended that conservative treatment always be tried first . Above all , the panel emphasized that patients be regarded_as the best experts on their pain and urged that health_professionals ask them regularly about their pain , just as they would about other aspects of their disease . The agency said pain can be controlled by simple and readily available means in about 90 % of cancer patients . Nevertheless , much cancer pain goes unrelieved because health_professionals are not trained to assess it and patients often are reluctant to report it , the agency said .</TEXT>
