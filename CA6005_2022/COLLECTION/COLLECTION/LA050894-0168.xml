   <HEADLINE> PERILOUS STATE OF AFFAIRS ; MEXICO : AS BAJA CALIFORNIA ' S GOVERNOR , ERNESTO RUFFO APPEL HAS BROUGHT ABOUT MANY REFORMS . BUT THE RECENT BOUT OF SLAYINGS AND SCANDALS THREATENS TO ENGULF HIS OPPOSITION PARTY ' S ACCOMPLISHMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Amid assassinations , drug violence and political combat , Ernesto Ruffo Appel still projects the image of the down-to-earth businessman who five years ago became Mexico ' s first opposition governor . The signs of changing times are unmistakable , however . The man who once shunned ostentatious entourages , mixing easily with dockworkers and Japanese investors alike , now travels around Baja California with a phalanx of wary bodyguards . Although Ruffo ' s manner is still cheerful and plain-spoken , he looks tired_of late . And the governor ' s words convey the gravity of recent events that seemed unthinkable when , as Ensenada mayor and a reform-minded political newcomer , he launched his historic bid for the Baja governorship . In two grim months , he has endured a scandal caused by a drug-related shootout between federal and state police , the assassinations in Tijuana of a presidential candidate and the city ' s police_chief , and the arrest by federal authorities of his deputy attorney_general on corruption charges . &quot; This is a dangerous game , &quot; Ruffo said during an interview Thursday at his official residence in this desert city that serves as Baja ' s capital . &quot; And I don ' t even want to call it a game , because I never wanted to be a player in such things . But well , these are things that fall_into my area , and what can I do ? I hope that after this I can live a peaceful life. &quot; This unconventional leader of a prosperous border state has brought_about landmark electoral and human_rights reforms , infrastructure improvements , international investment . He has led a campaign for democratization and urged greater_power for states in the rigidly centralized Mexican system . But that has been overshadowed by the violence that threatens to engulf his government , which is controlled by the National Action Party ( PAN ) . * As Ruffo approaches the end of his six-year term , critics say his greatest weakness has been the persistence of law_enforcement corruption . They fault the governor for remaining loyal to Juan Francisco Franco Rios , who stepped_down as attorney_general last month as the result of accusations of links to drug mafias . &quot; The drug_traffickers have continued functioning with great impunity and tolerance on the part of the government , &quot; said Victor Clark Alfaro , a noted Tijuana human_rights activist who has conducted an independent probe of police misconduct . Ruffo ' s state has become another battleground in Mexico ' s crisis , a northern counterpart to the conflict in the southern border state of Chiapas . The line between border drug wars and high-stakes political intrigue in Baja is blurring rapidly . &quot; He ' s very vulnerable to having his image and his legacy seriously damaged by all_of this , &quot; said Wayne Cornelius , director of the Center of U.S.-Mexico Studies at UC San Diego . &quot; He ' s done a lot of very important and constructive things in his state. &quot; As turmoil deepens in a presidential election year , hostility between the state_government under the PAN and the federal_government of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) has escalated . Ruffo says he has been the target of unprecedented political attacks . He describes tense verbal exchanges with top Mexican officials , who he says have urged him to remain silent about the unsolved slaying of candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio . Ruffo , the most prominent opposition figure involved in the investigation , has been more willing than federal authorities to discuss the unanswered questions in the assassination probe . Ruffo said he simply wants the Colosio case &quot; cleared_up . I want the truth to be known . . . . If not , this story will remain associated with us . And Tijuana will never get_rid_of that image. &quot; The assassinations of Colosio and of Federico Benitez Lopez , Tijuana ' s police_chief and a close ally of the governor , have also left Ruffo concerned about his safety . He and Tijuana Mayor Hector Osuna Jaime have beefed_up what were previously unobtrusive security details . &quot; There is enormous risk , &quot; Ruffo said . &quot; A chief of police dies , an honest , dedicated man , who in my judgment was free_of any corruption . It seems that the bad_guys are defeating the good guys. &quot; In the weeks preceding his death in a highway ambush , the chief was worried because he had rejected a $ 100 # 000 bribe from drug gangsters who wanted him to curb anti-narcotics operations , Ruffo said . But Ruffo did not discard a possible connection to the Colosio case ; some observers say the chief was killed because he was looking_into the assassination on behalf of Ruffo and had raised doubts about the official version . In the aftermath of Benitez ' s murder , tensions between Ruffo and Mexican Atty . Gen . Diego Valades broke_into the open . Federal_agents dispatched by Valades on Tuesday arrested another Ruffo ally , Deputy State Atty . Gen . Sergio Ortiz Lara , at his office on charges of drug corruption . The accompanying deployment of 100 heavily armed federal_agents , who briefly confronted state judicial police after Ortiz was hustled away at gunpoint , prompted fears of renewed combat between state and federal officers in downtown Tijuana . The attorney_general charges Ortiz with aiding the escape of gunmen of the Arellano drug cartel during the March 3 shootout between state and federal forces that killed a federal commander and four others , including a state police_officer who was allegedly guarding a drug lord . Investigators are also looking_into the deputy attorney_general ' s possible involvement in the police_chief ' s murder , Valades said . There have been implications that Benitez ' s death is linked to his supposed investigation of corrupt state officials -- something Ruffo angrily disputes . In fact , he and his backers suggest that Ortiz ' s arrest has more to do with politics than crime . The political hostilities grow partly from a stark reality in Baja : a justice system besieged by Mexico ' s drug mafias . The Arellano cartel is warring for control of one of the world ' s most lucrative smuggling corridors . Two years of machine_gun murders and brazen gun battles in the border region and elsewhere culminated in the slaying last year of the cardinal of Guadalajara by Arellano gunmen , who police say were trying to kill an enemy kingpin . Ruffo has failed to eradicate corruption in state law_enforcement , critics say . They say the governor protected the recently replaced former attorney_general , Franco , despite serious questions about Franco ' s conduct . Ruffo admits that federal authorities are investigating Franco , who is reportedly the ultimate target of the probe accelerated by the dramatic arrest of the deputy attorney_general last week . But the governor maintains that he has not seen proof that Franco broke the law . Ruffo described a federal investigative dossier on Franco as a &quot; political document. &quot; Ruffo said the state and federal forces have problems with corruption . The truth behind the chaotic gunfight pitting state against federal police on March 3 , Ruffo said , appears to be more complicated than the federal_government ' s description : that state officers in_league with cartel gunmen ambushed an elite federal unit trying to arrest a top lieutenant of the Arellanos . Ruffo believes that some of the federal officers were also working for traffickers . A report by Baja ' s independent human_rights ombudsman provides some backing for that view . The April 11 report is damaging to the state police and implicates many state officers , including a former station commander and a former chief bodyguard for the fired attorney_general . At the same time , however , the report concludes that federal officers may also have been involved in criminal activity , an allegation made by veteran federal officers and Mexican newspapers . * The state-federal friction is ironic when compared to the harmony that prevailed when Ruffo won the Baja elections in 1989 . President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was widely credited with stepping_in and &quot; allowing &quot; the PAN its first victory ever , despite the objections of the local PRI , whose administration had been racked by scandal and incompetence . Ruffo says he has a good relationship with Salinas . Top Mexican officials have been attentive to the governor , according to Cornelius of UC San Diego . &quot; It was a true test of a modernizing , supposedly democratizing , central government to work with an opposition government in an important state and forge a constructive working partnership , &quot; Cornelius said . The PAN has subsequently won two other states and Ruffo has been the topic of speculation as a future presidential candidate . Looking_back , Ruffo seems bemused at the speed with which he left_behind neophyte local politics . &quot; I never studied for this or thought it was going_to be my career or anything , &quot; he said , with the direct manner that distinguishes him from the stiff , florid style of stereotypical Mexican politicos . Ruffo , a 41-year-old father of three , is the son of a self-made merchant from La Paz . His father arrived in Ensenada with little money or education and established a seafood packaging firm . Ruffo grew_up working in the port of Ensenada , an experience that he says cultivated his rapport with working-class people . As a young executive , he drifted into opposition politics , he said , after publicly denouncing the government corruption he encountered while working for a seafood concern owned by U.S. and Mexican partners . He ended_up running_for mayor of Ensenada in 1986 , with decidedly modest expectations . &quot; I said , ' I know I ' m going_to give them a real fight here in Ensenada , but I know that since I ' m on my own , they ' re not going_to let me win. ' &quot; Regardless of who wins the three-way race for president , Ruffo said , the next federal administration will include cabinet-level representatives of opposition parties for the first time . That is just one of the democratic advances that he says are inevitable . &quot; There are many established interests and old ways of doing politics , there are old ways of doing business , that are accustomed to their advantages and don ' t want to give them up , &quot; he said . &quot; But there are many Mexicans who want to share the benefits . And I think it is only natural that the sharing of wealth and political power will resolve the problems. &quot;</TEXT>
