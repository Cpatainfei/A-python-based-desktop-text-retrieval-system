   <HEADLINE> ARAFAT ORDERS AIDE TO BOYCOTT SIGNING OF ISRAEL-JORDAN PACT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Saturday ordered his foreign affairs chief to boycott the signing ceremony for the Israeli-Jordanian peace_treaty , a senior official said , while in Tel Aviv , about 5 # 000 Israeli opponents of Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin ' s peace policies rallied at the site of a bus bombing that killed 22 people Wednesday . At the weekly Cabinet meeting of his government in the Gaza Strip , Arafat ordered Farouk Kaddoumi , the PLO ' s foreign affairs chief , to turn_down an invitation to the signing ceremony , a Palestinian official said on condition of anonymity . Arafat himself has not been invited to the ceremony . Arafat has called the treaty with Jordan an &quot; outrageous infringement &quot; of the agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization . The pact calls_for negotiations on the final status of East Jerusalem , which the Palestinians want as their future capital . But the treaty with Jordan assures a special role for Jordan ' s King Hussein as guardian of the Muslim holy_places there . Jordan and Israel are scheduled to sign the treaty Wednesday in a ceremony to be attended by President Clinton . In his annual speech from the throne Saturday , Hussein told the Jordanian Parliament that Jordan &quot; will never relinquish our religious responsibilities toward the holy sites under all circumstances. &quot; Israel , which captured the eastern half of Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle_East War , claims the city as its eternal , indivisible capital , but Jordan has continued to maintain the Islamic shrines . About a dozen Palestinians gathered_in East Jerusalem shouting , &quot; No to King Hussein &quot; and burning pictures of the Jordanian monarch . The crowd at the Saturday night Tel Aviv demonstration , which was organized by right-wing groups , filled Dizengoff Street shouting &quot; Death to the Arabs , &quot; and memorial candles covered the pavement at the spot where 22 people died in the suicide bombing claimed by the Islamic extremist group Hamas . Demonstrators , some holding signs saying , &quot; Rabin is a traitor , &quot; stood_for a minute of silence and then heard opposition politicians call_on the government to halt talks with Arafat aimed at expanding Palestinian autonomy . A day earlier , angry Israelis tried to break_up a demonstration on Dizengoff , Tel Aviv ' s main commercial thoroughfare , by left-wing groups calling_for a continuation of peace efforts with the Palestinians .</TEXT>
