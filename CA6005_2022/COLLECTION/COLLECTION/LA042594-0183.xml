   <TEXT> Sheri Sadler Wolf spends her days wrestling with tough political questions . Questions like : Do people who watch &quot; Married . . . With Children &quot; vote ? The other day , Wolf -- the media director at Target Enterprises , a Hollywood firm that buys advertising for political_campaigns -- let a salesman try to convince her that they do . &quot; There is an untapped resource in the 18-to-49 ( year-olds ) , &quot; the TV ad salesman said , referring to the age_group that tends to watch the sometimes crude Fox comedy . Hopeful that Wolf would buy_time on his station , he continued in vain : &quot; 18-to-49s are generally undecided voters . They are the kind of guys you should be going_after with ' Married . . . ' &quot; But Wolf knew better . She knew that her primary targets -- likely voters -- tend to be 35 and older . &quot; For the dollars I can spend right now , do I have the flexibility to go anywhere except after my 35-plussers ? &quot; she asked , shaking her head . &quot; Talk to me about ' Cops ' and ' America ' s Most Wanted. ' &quot; Over the next six weeks , until the June 7 primary , TV viewers will be bombarded by an increasing number of campaign messages . Although these ads may seem a cacophonous jumble , in fact each one is strategically placed to reach a specific group of voters . That is why media buyers such_as Wolf , who usually toil in obscurity , are crucial to a candidate ' s success . And that is why the closer the election , the more our democratic process may be reduced to closed-door debates about whether , dollar for dollar , &quot; 60 Minutes &quot; or &quot; Jeopardy ! &quot; is a better political buy . John Riedl , general sales manager at KABC-TV Channel 7 in Los Angeles , says that depending_on their budgets , campaigns consider two distinct strategies : &quot; Buy ' Home Improvement , ' ' Roseanne , ' ' Murphy Brown , ' ' Seinfeld. ' Big ratings , one_shot , pay a lot of money . ( Or ) get_out of prime_time and go_into other ( times of the day ) that don ' t give you as big a rating and don ' t cost as much . ' Oprah. ' ' Eyewitness News. ' ' Wheel of Fortune. ' &quot; The latter approach -- commonly called &quot; buying tonnage &quot; -- can definitely work , said Jim Margolis , former media adviser to state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown ' s gubernatorial campaign . After all , he said , &quot; People watching ' Wheel ' and ' Jeopardy ! ' aren ' t just bubbas out there . They ' re everybody. &quot; The stakes in the media buying game couldn ' t be much higher . In a state as large as California , broadcast advertisements -- both on television and radio -- are as close as most voters will get_to their candidates . Campaigns pay dearly to connect with the electorate : sometimes more_than $ 1 # 000 for every second of air time . To advertise when voters aren ' t watching is to risk defeat . &quot; The dollars that you spend on television are astounding . If you ' re wasting your money , you ' re just giving_away votes , &quot; said Margolis , whose Washington firm resigned from Brown ' s campaign in March . &quot; So do I want to go and buy a show like ' Love Connection ' ? . . . These are some of the most critical decisions that ( a campaign ) makes. &quot; Making a smart media buy is not as simple as looking_at the latest Nielsen ratings . For example , one might expect &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; to skew to a younger , non-voting audience . &quot; Wrong , &quot; said Robert Nelson , an Orange County political consultant who specializes in media strategy . &quot; It ' s all these old guys like me who still think they ' re 22 years old . Highly educated target voters -- a damn good deal. &quot; &quot; The Simpsons , &quot; by contrast , is a very popular show , but pity the candidate who advertises there , many experts say . The reason : A significant chunk of viewers are children 2 to 11 -- future voters , maybe , but not the people a campaign needs to reach in this election year . Media consultants base their decisions on focus groups and demographic research , ratings studies and pricing data . For helping to reach the right voters , they earn commissions that can run as high as 15 % . In California that can be a lot of money . The candidates for governor already have spent more_than $ 3 million buying ad time . Rep . Michael Huffington ( R-Santa Barbara ) alone has spent more_than $ 2 million to air his reasons for wanting to unseat U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein . Between now and the general_election in November , statewide candidates will spend tens of millions of dollars to go_on the air . It ' s not necessarily a partisan profession . Many media buyers learned their craft not in the political trenches but buying spots for more conventional products , from soft_drinks to soup . Brown ' s new campaign manager , Clint Reilly , has hired a former Coca-Cola ad buyer to execute the Democratic front-runner ' s media strategy . And some buyers admit that , although it ' s nice when their own political leanings match those of a client , ideological agreement is not essential to get the job done . Still , like other political consultants , media experts quickly become identified with one party or the other . David Bienstock , who owns Target Enterprises , only works for Republican candidates . Among his clients this year : Gov . Pete Wilson , Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren and George W . Bush , who is seeking the Texas governorship . &quot; I don ' t assume I ' m just a hired gun who makes his commission win or lose , &quot; Bienstock says . &quot; I want to win. &quot; At times , the work can seem tedious , especially when compared to creating a commercial . While ad producers yell &quot; Action ! &quot; , media strategists debate the subtle advantages of airing an ad &quot; inside &quot; a program instead of at the end . They ponder &quot; pod-positioning &quot; ( where , within a block of ads , a spot appears ) and &quot; heavy click time &quot; ( the moments when most viewers reach for their remote_controls ) . &quot; It ' s not sexy -- you ' ve got_to sit around in rooms ( staring at ) computer printouts , &quot; said Nelson , the Orange County consultant who has advised several California initiative campaigns . &quot; But the biggest opportunity to make a difference in the campaign is there , because that ' s where you spend all_the money. &quot; Stanley Kay of Advanced Media Service Inc. says the most fundamental premise for media strategists is : &quot; Use a rifle instead of a shotgun. &quot; Long before an ad is aired , a campaign must decide precisely which voters it needs to reach . Just as it is worthless to reach people who don ' t vote , many experts believe it is folly to try to change people ' s minds . The better the advertising is targeted , the more successfully it zeros_in on voters who are likely to be receptive . Wolf , the Target Enterprises media director , offers an obvious example from the Wilson account . Although declining to discuss Wilson ' s overall media strategy , she says there is one block of programming she won ' t even consider buying : a political talk_show on Sacramento ' s KCRA-TV that is hosted by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown ( a Democrat who has often butted heads with the Republican governor ) . Nelson , the Orange County consultant , offers another example . &quot; If you are a hostile bombastic older male ( candidate ) , you probably shouldn ' t spend a lot of your time buying ' Murphy Brown ' TV commercials , &quot; he said . &quot; You ' ll be paying to advertise to a group of people who whenever they see you will remember how much they dislike you. &quot; Timing is everything , says Jean Brooks , senior_vice_president at Western International Media , which is buying ad time for Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi ' s gubernatorial campaign . &quot; It doesn ' t do any good to reach someone in January , 1994 , if they don ' t care about who they ' re going to be voting for , &quot; Brooks said . &quot; If you reach someone five times in January and one time the day before Election_Day , that one time is probably money better spent. &quot; The best timetable , of course , is to start early and repeat often . But most campaigns cannot afford such extravagance , even with the most aggressive fund raising . Margolis recalls that when he worked for Brown , he would attend fund-raisers to let donors know just how expensive ads can be . &quot; I ' d say , ' One 30-second ad , just in L.A. , one time , can cost more_than $ 30 # 000 , ' &quot; he said , recalling how he would hold_up a schedule to show how often Brown needed to be_on the air . &quot; I ' d say , ' I need people here to buy one &quot; Good_Morning America &quot; spot . You can buy_it on June 1 . It will be your spot. ' &quot; Budget-conscious candidates try to &quot; pulse &quot; their media on and off throughout the campaign , while keeping a reserve of cash to finance a big push at the end . Then they must decide where , exactly , to make that final assault -- on television , radio or both . The two broadcast media work differently , depending where in California they are used . In Los Angeles , for example , where commute times tend to be longer , many media gurus say radio is a wise choice . Here , a campaign may well reach as_many women voters on a &quot; light &quot; radio_station as on a top-rated TV_show like &quot; Northern Exposure &quot; -- but for a fraction of the cost . Still , most statewide campaigns end_up on television , where the visual_images are believed to &quot; burn in &quot; better , so as_to resonate in voters ' minds . Simple math dictates that the cheaper the time_period , the more often a campaign can afford to repeat an ad . And given the immense competition for a voter ' s attention , the frequency is important . Media experts agree that on average , a voter needs to see a spot at least four times before its message sinks_in . &quot; There ' s cable , the ability to channel surf , VCRs -- all that stuff makes_it harder for us to get_through without getting whacked , &quot; said Margolis . &quot; Right in the middle of the ad , maybe ( a voter ) just got a ham_sandwich , the kid started screaming , the phone rang. &quot; The goal : to rise above the distractions ( not the least of which are other ads -- for commercial products as well as other candidates ) and to achieve &quot; top-of-mind awareness. &quot; It is no small feat , said Hank Sheinkopf , to do all that without alienating the viewer . &quot; Politics is not something that everybody needs . You need a car or something to drink . But you don ' t need what we have to sell , &quot; said Sheinkopf , a New York-based media consultant who has advised many California campaigns . &quot; We go_into ( voters ' ) living rooms . We ' re not invited . They invited Mike Wallace and the team into their living_rooms , not us . that ' s why repetition is key. &quot; Over the next several weeks , buyers will work overtime placing ads , making_sure what they ' ve bought gets delivered and keeping a close eye on the competition . Strategists will haggle with broadcasters over the so-called &quot; political protection period &quot; ( the 45-day countdown to the primary_election that began Saturday ) . During this window , federal law requires stations to charge federal candidates their lowest rates . ( Most stations extend the courtesy to statewide and local candidates as well ) . Moreover , stations must try to provide rival candidates with equal access to the rating points they desire . And here ' s where the quibbling begins : when the most popular shows sell_out , arguments inevitably ensue . &quot; I ' ve said ( to a TV_station ) , ' Look , it is not equivalent_to offer us ' America ' s Most Wanted ' when you sold ' Primetime Live ' to ( our rival ) , &quot; Margolis said . &quot; One has trailer_park residents who aren ' t ever going_to vote and the other has high-information voters . Maybe ( the station ) is giving us the same number of bodies , but they ' re not the same bodies. &quot; As the candidates scramble , as the strategists bicker , one thing is certain . &quot; The closer you get_to June , you ' re going to see seven stations brought_to you by the political_arena , &quot; warns Riedl of KABC-TV . &quot; You ' re going to see so many political spots , you ' re going to say , ' Enough already ! ' &quot; Buying_Time Once they decide which voters to target , political media buyers seek to acquire two things for their clients : reach and frequency . Reach is how many people see a campaign ad . Frequency is how many times they see it . And especially in a state as big as California , where television spots are as close as_many voters get_to their candidates , winning requires both . So , what to buy ? Below , a_few tips . 60 MINUTES Price : $ 32 # 000 Considered one of the best shows for reaching lots of people in one hit . Ratings are high among adults , both men and women . Moreover , viewers who tune_in to magazine shows and other news_programs tend to be educated and well-informed -- the kind of people who pay_attention early , get involved and vote . The downside : expense . MURPHY BROWN Price : $ 16 # 000 Buyers believe that &quot; Murphy Brown , &quot; with its liberal-minded heroine , tends to attract Democrats and women . If a candidate wants to reach Republican men , they say , he or she would get a bigger bang for the buck buying &quot; Monday Night Football. &quot; OPRAH Price : $ 2 # 400 Buying daytime programming is shrewd if a candidate wants to court older viewers , especially women . Many candidates want to do just that , since older people are more likely to vote than younger ones . Some candidates will craft ads specifically to air during the day -- perhaps stressing issues that are important to seniors_citizens . Or they may run 60-second spots , which are prohibitively expensive at other times_of_day . JEOPARDY Price : $ 4 # 000 Nestled between local news_shows and prime_time , a program like this is considered a great bargain . Sure , its draws only half the rating points of &quot; 60 Minutes &quot; -- but at one-eighth the cost . Media experts believe a viewer must see a campaign spot four times before its message &quot; burns in , &quot; creating so-called &quot; top-of-mind awareness. &quot; This show , like &quot; Wheel of Fortune , &quot; makes repetition affordable . THE SIMPSONS Price : $ 23 # 000 Despite great ratings , this show ' s high price makes_it unpopular with political ad buyers . Viewers tend to be younger , meaning they are less likely to vote . Since the goal is not to persuade people to vote , but to reach those who always vote and win them over , programs like this -- or &quot; Beverly Hills 90210 &quot; -- are often seen as a waste_of_money . But late in the campaign , when the airwaves get crowded , ads may well show_up here . Note : Prices are estimates for one 30-second ad , airing one time in the Los Angeles market .</TEXT>
