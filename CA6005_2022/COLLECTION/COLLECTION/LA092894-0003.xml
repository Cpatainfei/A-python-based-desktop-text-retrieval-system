   <HEADLINE> FAST FEET , FLURRY OF DOLLARS ; L.A. MARATHON CASE SHOWS NEED FOR A CLOSER EYE ON POLITICAL GIFTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state Fair Political Practices Commission and the Los Angeles Ethics Commission haven ' t exactly had kind words for each other lately . And that ' s truly unfortunate , because these two watchdog agencies were created to safeguard the public interest by fighting political corruption , not bashing each other . Bad_blood or no , both deserve praise for a joint investigation that has yielded a substantial settlement in a case of laundered campaign contributions . Under terms of the settlement , Los Angeles Marathon Inc. , the firm that oversees the annual footrace , must pay a $ 436 # 000 fine for improperly funneling $ 73 # 000 in contributions to state and local candidates through third-party organizations and individuals . Recipients of the illicit funds include eight current City_Council members and former L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley . Most of the donations came at a time when L.A. Marathon officials were furiously lobbying the City_Council for a contract extension ; later they got one that allows them to hold the race here through the year 2000 . Some elected officials and candidates insist that it ' s difficult to identify the true sources of their campaign contributions . That may be true , but they certainly could try harder ; we bet they could identify the sources in many cases . When an illegal contribution does elude their detection , at the least when they learn of the violation they should quickly relinquish the tainted money . The Los Angeles Ethics Commission now holds seminars for local candidates and their campaign treasurers on campaign finance rules , with a special emphasis on fund-raising and campaign contributions . Elected officials should pay_attention and keep careful notes . In the end , the issue of better identifying campaign contributions may have to be addressed through changes in campaign law .</TEXT>
