   <HEADLINE> TOBACCO INDUSTRY LIGHTS_UP AT MENTION OF CHINA MARKET ; CIGARETTES : NATION HAS MORE SMOKERS THAN U.S. HAS RESIDENTS . BUT STATE KEEPS MUCH OF THE TRADE FOR ITSELF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Viewed from the embattled perspective of the American tobacco_industry , the People ' s Republic_of_China is a pipe_dream come true . The world ' s most populous country is already hooked on cigarettes . More people -- 300 million -- smoke in China than live_in the United States . More_than 60 % of teen-age and adult_males smoke . Although the percentage of female smokers is only one-ninth as great , smoking among women in high_schools and universities is_on the rise , indicating that a traditional cultural aversion is giving_way . &quot; A lot of young_women are smoking to show that they are not the same old traditional ' gal , ' &quot; said Tinne Loh , a Singapore native who recently graduated from the Central Academy of Fine_Arts in Beijing . Domestic cigarette manufacturers command the vast bulk of China ' s huge market -- and probably will continue to , given import restrictions and lower prices for Chinese-made smokes . But in terms of public image , Western brands -- and especially American ones -- are making dramatic inroads in China today . The Marlboro man rides high : His rugged form is featured on a billboard in Shanghai ' s famous Bund central business_district . In Wuhan , industrial capital of Hubei province , he rides_herd atop the central post_office . To try to snuff_out the pervasive advertising_campaigns by overseas brands , the National People ' s Congress passed a law late last month banning all forms of tobacco advertising -- domestic and foreign -- effective Feb . 1 . But similar attempts to limit tobacco promotion have met with failure . Industry_analysts point_out that the Beijing central government is too dependent_on sales by the state-owned tobacco monopoly and taxes on cigarettes to mount an effective anti-smoking campaign . Taxes on popular domestic brands such_as Double Happiness and Gaoli ( High Happiness ) are the government ' s biggest single source of revenue , generating about $ 5.26 billion in 1993 . Cigarettes are also the largest-selling retail product in China , accounting_for more_than $ 24 billion in sales last year . Although imports of American and other foreign cigarettes are extremely limited , totaling less than 2 % of the market , the well-financed , sophisticated American ad_campaigns have helped increase the market for China ' s own brands . China ' s tobacco_industry , in this respect , is indebted to overseas marketing experts for its steady annual growth . The glossy pages of a recent issue of a magazine published by the China National Tobacco Corp. , the state monopoly , featured more_than a dozen full-page ads by American and foreign companies . Adding_to their smoky allure here , American cigarettes carry a social and political message that speaks_of luxury , freedom and modernity . During the massive 1989 student demonstrations in Beijing ' s Tian An Men Square , for example , the unofficial cigarette of protest was Marlboro , manufactured by America ' s Philip Morris Co . For today ' s more business-minded students , American cigarettes are a sign of having arrived . &quot; For young people , even younger than me , smoking American cigarettes is a kind of a glory , &quot; said Lu Haiqing , 25 , a municipal_government cultural officer in Shanghai . &quot; It ' s a way of showing_off your wealth. &quot; Perhaps for that reason , foreign business people find American cigarettes a perfect bribe when seeking small favors . &quot; When I first came here 10 years ago , I could get almost anything I wanted for a pack of American cigarettes , &quot; said an American garment exporter , a nonsmoker himself . &quot; Now the ante has moved_up to a carton. &quot; Many young artists and musicians recently have switched to Camels as the cigarette of choice , reports Loh , a heavy smoker . Until the recent legislation by the National People ' s Congress , Chinese government anti-tobacco efforts were practically nonexistent . Anti-smoking laws that do exist are loosely enforced . Robert Fletcher , manager of general affairs in Hong Kong for the_British firm Rothmans International , said each province decides how to apply Beijing ' s limits on tobacco advertising . Revenue-hungry local television and radio_stations , he said , can be persuaded to overlook restrictions . &quot; The policy is written in Beijing and loosely interpreted at the provincial level , &quot; Fletcher said . &quot; There are a_few inconsistencies. &quot; Local interpretations of the rules sometimes are colored , he noted , by the fact that many state_governments own advertising_agencies that would profit by placing ads . &quot; The cigarette companies are just riding rings around the regulations , &quot; said Judith Mackay , a British physician in Hong Kong who advises Asian governments on anti-smoking legislation . Staff_members at the Chinese Assn . on Smoking and Health , the government-sponsored anti-smoking organization in Beijing , complain that it is difficult to find volunteers for their campaigns . The immensity of China ' s market , plus the hostility of shrinking markets back home , have caused the American and European tobacco_industries to sink millions of dollars into advertising and other product promotions on the mainland . According to the Hong Kong-based Survey Research Group , the main foreign brands -- Marlboro , Parliament , Kent , 555 State Express ( a British brand ) and Mild Seven ( a Japanese brand ) -- spent $ 2.5 million on TV advertising in 1993 . Marlboro is among the nation ' s most advertised foreign products . Salem sponsors the annual Beijing tennis tournament . The British-American Tobacco Co. ' s 555 brand sponsors the popular Hong Kong-Beijing Rally car_race . The most aggressive of the international marketers , 555 sprinkles product placements in popular national TV_shows , including last year ' s hit series &quot; A Beijinger in New York. &quot; For location scenes in that series , the company shipped ashtrays and other product-labeled decorations to New York to be used in backdrops . The 555 brand is not marketed in America . No age_group is out of bounds . To promote the Hong Kong-Beijing Rally , free tickets to a rally associated with the event -- each ticket emblazoned with the 555 logo -- were distributed in Beijing elementary schoolyards . Here in Shanghai -- China ' s prosperous industrial center -- billboards advertising Kent , Salem and Marlboro cigarettes adorn the city skyline . Marlboro and Kent each sponsor popular_music programs . &quot; The Chinese cigarette market offers immense opportunities , &quot; Philip Morris said in its latest annual report . Still , for a variety of reasons , including the strength and vitality of the indigenous tobacco_industry , the Chinese market may_not be the gold mine the tobacco_industry seeks . Easily self-sufficient in tobacco production , China severely restricts imports , set this year at 1 % of overall sales . And Beijing imposes prohibitive duties on those cigarettes that are imported . In January , the Chinese government raised the tax on imported cigarettes from 175 % to 430 % , all but halting imports . Shipments are expected to resume by year ' s end under a memorandum of understanding between the Chinese and U.S._governments . On the streets of most major Chinese cities , American and European cigarettes -- a significant number of them smuggled into the country -- sell for the equivalent of $ 1.25 a pack . That is cheap by American standards . But incomes in China are low . And good-quality Chinese cigarettes sell for 25 cents . The result is that , although foreign cigarettes have a high-profile posture in the major cities and ports , they account_for a minute share of the overall market . Given the price differential and differences in taste , most Chinese prefer to smoke homemade brands . In an exhaustive recent study of the mainland Chinese consumer market , DRI / McGraw-Hill projected that the domestic-brand market will top $ 48 billion by the year 2003 , based on the current 18 % annual growth in cigarette sales . Indeed , there is no compelling reason for China to cede a significant portion of the market to foreign products . According to the China National Tobacco Corp. , 10 million Chinese households are involved in tobacco production . To get a toehold in the huge market , several foreign companies have entered into joint-production agreements with Chinese partners . Rothmans operates a joint_venture in China ' s Shandong province that uses 60 % Chinese tobacco in its cigarettes . In August , 1993 , Philip Morris signed a cooperative agreement with the China National Tobacco Corp . to produce Marlboros in Shanghai and Ningbo . &quot; It ' s a two-way_street , &quot; explained Philip Morris corporate affairs director Donald Harris . &quot; We ' re using their production facilities , and they are working with us on learning technical things. &quot; The DRI / McGraw-Hill researchers suggested that such joint-venture agreements could pay_off for foreign manufacturers . In general , though , the prospects for foreign tobacco products in China are not bright , according to the report . &quot; While China ' s cigarette market is enormous and expected to continue to grow , we believe it represents a limited opportunity for foreign manufacturers , &quot; the report says . Times special correspondent Maggie Farley in Hong Kong and Wang Jilu and Victor Zatsepin of The Times ' Beijing Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
