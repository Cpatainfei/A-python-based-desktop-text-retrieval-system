   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : AND ON YOUR LEFT , YOU CAN JUST MAKE_OUT THE INSIGHTFUL COLUMNIST GENE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The most important cartographers in the world these days don ' t work_at Rand McNally or the CIA . They ' re not much interested in mountains and rivers and shifting national boundaries . In fact , they don ' t necessarily know much about traditional geography at all . No , the influential map_makers of the 1990s ply their trade_in molecular_biology labs , charting the geography of genes . They ' re rapidly creating a veritable atlas of human , plant and animal genes , figuring_out where individual genes are located and what they do . This is proving to be one of the most productive ventures in the history of cartography : gene mapping is transforming biology , agriculture and medicine as surely as mapping the New World transformed Europe . This year alone , researchers have located more_than 45 new disease-causing genes in humans -- just yesterday , scientists announced the discovery of the gene that is believed to cause half of all inherited cases of breast_cancer . The better-than-gene-a-week pace has helped spawn the biotech business boom . But what good is an atlas without a guidebook ? Alas , there are no Zagats or Guide Michelins for the genome just yet , no formal tours of the hot spots on uncharted chromosomes . To help rectify this problem , a_few experts below point_out their favorite sites on the gene map and explain where are the most interesting places to visit : * &quot; The HOX genes , &quot; offers Edward P . Lewis , the Thomas_Hunt_Morgan Professor of Molecular_Biology at CalTech . &quot; They are the only way an organism can make a head , thorax and abdomen . They do_it by telling the other genes what to do . That part of the gene has not changed for over 500 million years. &quot; * &quot; LINE 1 and LRE1 , LRE2 and LRE3 , &quot; says Maxine Singer , a molecular biologist who is president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and who has a lab at the National Cancer Institute . &quot; They are places where active copies of the only known copies of human transposable -- so-called jumping genes -- are found . They ' re mutagenic when they jump : that is , they cause mutations and disease , like muscular_dystrophy , when they move . They appear to be_active in early embryonic_cells . They ' re troublemakers , and I ' m particularly interested in why these troublemakers have persisted for so_long in the genome because of all_the trouble they cause. &quot; * &quot; Rin , &quot; says William R . Hyatt , the vice_president of research and development for Calgene , the company that developed the genetically engineered FlavrSavr tomato . &quot; It ' s a spot on the tomato locus and mutations map onto there . It ' s a natural mutant and it inhibits ripening . It ' s not so_much a gene as it is a site . The point is , nobody knows exactly what this gene or locus is -- how it exerts this multitude of effects on the tomato and through what mechanism . We ' ve only recently begun to clone it. &quot; * &quot; The sry gene of the Y_chromosome , &quot; offers Robert L . Sinsheimer , an emeritus professor at UC Santa Barbara and a pioneer in the early days of bacterial virus research . &quot; This was thought to be the central gene for determining maleness and femaleness . . . . There are also corresponding genes on the X ( female ) chromosome . We thought we understood which genes made you a boy or a girl . It seemed pretty clear and now it ' s confused. &quot; * &quot; The genes responsible_for Type 1 diabetes , &quot; says venture_capitalist Kevin Kinsella , who is also chief_executive of La Jolla-based Sequana Therapeutics . &quot; The sites are chromosomes 6 , 11 and 18 and near HLA . There may be as_many as five other genes implicated . I ' m much more interested now in how gene complexes interact to produce a disease rather than just looking_for single genes . The problem is finding all those multiple locations . So I think we ' re moving into a new era of gene discovery. &quot; * &quot; The ACC Synthase genes , &quot; suggests David Evans , business development vice_president for DNA Plant Technology , which was involved in creating Brown &amp; Williamson ' s Y-1 high nicotine tobacco . &quot; They oversee the biosynthesis of ethylene . They control ripening and rotting . It ' s a gene family involved in part of the plant ' s defense_mechanisms against disease . In some fruits , like bananas and tomatoes , there is a direct association between ethylene and fruit rotting . We ' re looking_to suspend that. &quot; * &quot; The genes for the NMDA receptor , &quot; offers Daniel Koshland , a molecular biologist at UC Berkeley and the editor of Science magazine . &quot; It ' s the receptor in the brain involved in how we record memory . I ' m trying to understand the biochemical shift between short-term_memory and long-term_memory . We ' re looking_for the gene for it . Where it is_on the chromosome is not that important at the moment -- but it may be . I don ' t have any guarantees that its location is important but that may turn_out to give us important insights . Sometimes gene geography can be very important. &quot; * &quot; The histone gene clusters , &quot; says Laurence Kedes , director of the Institute for Genetic Medicine at USC . &quot; These are the genes that make the proteins that coat the chromosomes . They ' re the ones responsible_for taking the threads of DNA and compacting them into cells . Otherwise , they would be yards long. &quot; * MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH Researchers identify gene responsible_for some breast_cancers . A1</TEXT>
