   <HEADLINE> THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE ; THE ECONOMY ; IDEA FILE : HIGH-TECH INCUBATORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How It Works : The entertainment_industry , and local government- and university-directed economic initiatives , should focus_on creating and retaining the entertainment jobs of the future , especially in the areas of multimedia , digitalization ( CD / ROM ) and &quot; access lanes &quot; to the information superhighway , such_as on-line services . Local_government should promote Los Angeles as the creative and technological heart of the information revolution , and emphasis on new-business development should target emerging technologies -- not just faster permitting for film shoots . Benefits The advent of spectacular new technology is changing the way movies and TV_programs are made . One danger is that Silicon_Valley , with its technological base , will siphon away Los Angeles ' s power as the entertainment_industry ' s creative center , because so_much more of the product will be created , or enhanced , with computers . Any erosion of the entertainment job base in L.A. would strike another blow to the local economy . Short-Term or Long-Term Impact ? Can have both . Supporters Many argue that by encouraging Los Angeles ' role as the center of the information revolution -- not just traditional movie-making -- local_government would provide a beacon for the industry and a strong message to the rest of the country . A multimedia &quot; zone , &quot; say in Burbank , could encourage start-ups in emerging technologies and provide a testing platform and clearinghouse . Also , expansion of university programs that emphasize new media technologies would provide the labor_pool that studios and support businesses will need to create the product and control the flow of the information highway . USC Film School Dean Elizabeth Daley , for example , says USC is eager to train students -- including technically oriented , non-traditional students -- in new-media applications . &quot; Where we need help is to know that there are jobs for them on the other end , &quot; Daley says . That will require closer relations among the universities , the studios and the new technology providers . Opponents Critics say emphasis on emerging information technologies by the studios could hasten the shrinkage of the traditional Hollywood labor base . A simple example : If a computer can create a &quot; crowd &quot; in a movie background , real extras may_not be needed . But fighting technology has usually proved a losing battle . The Costs Potential new incubator complexes to encourage developing technologies ( interactive software , for example ) could be set_up in existing vacant industrial space . Cost to government would vary depending_on how ambitious the plan is . In San Jose , the city seeded a Center for Software Development in 1992 for $ 350 # 000 . The center , which allows software developers to test their products , now operates_on a not-for-profit basis . An intangible cost : New technologies could weaken the power of Hollywood trade_unions by changing the nature of how movies are made . REALITY CHECK Could go either way . Resistance on the part of some studios and other Hollywood elements to the technology revolution probably won ' t die easy . Also , Silicon_Valley has an edge_in keeping and breeding technology-oriented jobs .</TEXT>
