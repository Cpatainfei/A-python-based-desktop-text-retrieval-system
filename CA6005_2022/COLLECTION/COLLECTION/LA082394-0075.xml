   <TEXT> I am confused . When is a weed not a weed ? In the Aug . 11 issue of the Ventura section , there appeared an article regarding Charles Probst , who had scraped his property of so-called natural vegetation and was about to plant flowering trees and grass.Evidently his neighbors complained to the Planning_Commission . According to the article , the previous owner of the property had made an agreement to leave the natural vegetation . Mr. Probst was removing a fire hazard and attempting to make his property more to his liking . It is difficult to imagine why his neighbors would object to this when the city of Thousand Oaks will come_to your property and remove natural vegetation that grows on your property or the curb area in front of your house and bill you for it if someone complains that your property is a fire hazard . When a fire comes_along and wipes_out many of those beautiful homes , I wonder then if his neighbors will change their minds about having all those weeds growing in their back yards .
