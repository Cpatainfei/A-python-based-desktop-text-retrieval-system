   <HEADLINE> WHEN THE TARGET IS AMERICA ; WORLD TRADE CENTER CASE : A CREDIT TO THE INVESTIGATORS AND PROSECUTORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One year and six days after a 1 # 200-pound bomb killed six people , injured more_than 1 # 000 and did $ 550 million in damage to New York ' s World Trade Center , a federal jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts against the four defendants in the case . That verdict , which could result in life sentences , was a credit to the painstaking work done_by investigators and prosecutors.At the same time the verdict is a reminder that this country , because of its proud tradition of openness and its international leadership , remains vulnerable to acts of violence inspired by politics , ideology or religious fanaticism . There is no sure way to immunize the country against imported terrorism . At best , life can be made harder for would-be terrorists , to begin with by looking closer at visa applications to screen_out those with criminal pasts . But no security measures are foolproof . Tens of millions of foreign visitors are welcomed each year . Meanwhile , our laws , or lack of them , make_it easy for those bent on terrorism to obtain weapons and the materials for explosives . It removes nothing from the efficient police work in the World Trade Center case to recall that the conspirators , described by the government as Muslim fundamentalists , did some truly stupid things before and after their crime , sowing an evidentiary trail that led straight to their convictions . Others might not be so accommodatingly self-incriminating . Will other terrorist acts be attempted ? It would be foolish not to expect so . And it would be foolish in the extreme not to do everything possible to tighten security at those sites -- government buildings , power_plants and the_like -- that could be the most inviting targets .</TEXT>
