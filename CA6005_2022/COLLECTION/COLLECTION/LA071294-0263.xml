   <HEADLINE> UPDATE ; TEAMSTER LEADER ' S MANTLE OF REFORM STARTING TO FRAY ; ELECTED ON PLEDGE TO CLEAN_UP UNION , RON CAREY IS CRITICIZED FOR ALLEGED MAFIA LINKS AND BEING SLOW TO ATTACK CORRUPTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Ron Carey was elected president of the Teamsters in 1991 , advocates of reform inside and outside the nation ' s largest trade_union breathed a sign of relief . Hailed as &quot; Mr. Clean &quot; after a series of scandal-tainted Teamster chiefs , three of whom went_to federal prison , Carey pledged to rid his union of mob influence . Now , midway through his first term , Carey is being dogged by allegations that his own rise_to_power has been stained by Mafia connections and that he has been slow to attack corruption . Carey counters that political enemies , looking_to the 1996 union vote , are trying to do him in through a smear campaign -- seeking to discredit his reform efforts . But the criticism comes from more_than political enemies : His detractors have included some highly credentialed authorities -- a Mafia turncoat for whom the FBI vouches , a nationally known former prosecutor and a veteran federal judge . The Justice_Department is aware of the allegations and is examining them , an official said . More_than a dozen members of Congress have written the department to urge a thorough review . Rep . Don Edwards ( D-San Jose ) , a ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee , has asked Atty . Gen . Janet Reno &quot; to examine the material closely and look_into the_matter personally. &quot; According to FBI records , Alphonse ( Little Al ) D ' Arco , a former organized crime bigwig who has become a protected government witness , has asserted that Carey earlier in his career honored illegal picket_lines thrown_up by the Lucchese crime family . Carey formerly headed New York Teamsters Local 804 , whose members handle air freight . D ' Arco ' s statements are contained in a confidential report prepared by two FBI_agents on Jan . 7 , 1992 , soon after the mobster began to cooperate with the government . Referring to D ' Arco as &quot; CW &quot; ( cooperating witness ) , the agents wrote : &quot; When CW used to put_up illegal pickets / strikes , CW would call Carey to advise him of same , and Carey would honor the strike without even investigating the nature , purpose or legitimacy of the strike. &quot; Carey claims he never has met or spoken with D ' Arco . Yet critics point to circumstantial_evidence that Carey has had other ties to the Lucchese syndicate . Soon after Carey took_office as president of the 1.4-million member union , Frederick B . Lacey -- a former federal judge who helps oversee Teamster affairs -- vetoed Carey ' s appointment of veteran Teamster William F . Genoese as trustee of Local 295 . Lacey said Genoese had &quot; a sad record &quot; of fighting corruption while representing cargo handlers at John F . Kennedy Airport and that he had lied under oath about his efforts to secure his appointment by Carey . Lacey overruled the appointment on grounds that it &quot; would further an act of racketeering activity &quot; within the Teamsters . Federal investigators had linked Genoese to the Lucchese family . Carey then withdrew the appointment , calling it a mistake . U.S. District Judge Eugene H . Nickerson appointed Thomas Puccio , a respected ex-prosecutor , to replace Genoese as permanent trustee of Local 295 , a scandal-scarred union whose past president was found to be a Mafia member . And Puccio filed a brief in federal_court last month that said Carey , as national president , also had been slow to attack corruption in a &quot; sister local &quot; of 295 controlled for years by the Lucchese family . Puccio said Carey dragged his feet for months in replacing Anthony Razza as leader of Local 851 . Razza subsequently pleaded guilty to corruption charges . Carey ' s critics also have dug_up court records from a 1975 criminal case in New York showing that Carey appeared as a character witness for John Joseph Conti , who was identified as a &quot; soldier &quot; in the Lucchese crime family by the Senate permanent investigations subcommittee . Conti was later acquitted of charges that he extorted bribes from small_businessmen . Carey ' s aides and supporters claim Puccio ' s charges are politically motivated , that he is simply trying to extend his power as a court-appointed trustee over the second union , Local 851 . And Carey said in a statement that he has acted to place more_than 30 Teamster locals in trusteeship because of financial malfeasance or other wrongdoing by local union officers . But U.S. District Judge David Edelstein of New York , who exercises judicial supervision over the Teamsters , has said that the new union chief seemed to be ignoring his pledges of reform . Carey ' s actions &quot; presage toleration of organized_crime ' s influence in union affairs and complacency in the face of corruption , &quot; the judge said . Edelstein recently has been less critical and has upheld moves by Carey to abolish the mid-level layer of Teamster regional conferences across the country , and with it the conference officials who often draw high union salaries . Carey has said these leaders , who he claims are responsible_for most of the personal &quot; smears &quot; against him , are not needed by the rank-and-file members . As to the validity of the so-called smears of Carey , a three-member independent review board that works under Edelstein ' s auspices reported this week that its inquiry &quot; does not support our recommending charges against Carey. &quot;</TEXT>
