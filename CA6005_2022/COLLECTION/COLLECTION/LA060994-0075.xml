   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : LOS ANGELES ; GARCETTI URGES REVISION OF ' THREE STRIKES ' LAW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Unless the &quot; three strikes you ' re out &quot; law is limited to violent repeat offenders , the justice system will be crippled and civil courts will have to close_down , Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti predicted Wednesday . Los Angeles County prosecutors have filed 443 third-strike cases and 1 # 234 second-strike cases since March , when Gov . Pete Wilson signed the three strikes law , Garcetti said . Most will go_to trial , he said at a news_conference . &quot; I do believe_in the three strikes principle , &quot; he said . &quot; But it should reserved for the violent repeat offender. &quot; Otherwise , he said , &quot; The civil courts will have to close_down because criminal cases take precedence. &quot; Garcetti said he and a delegation including the family of murder victim Polly Klaas will go_to Sacramento on Thursday to urge the Senate to adopt Assembly Bill 167 . They will also ask Wilson to sign the bill and put it on the November ballot . The bill provides_for life sentences without parole for serious or violent felons convicted of a third strike . Under the initiative already on the November ballot , the third strike may be any felony , including petty theft , and the sentence is 25 years to life . Garcetti said the current three strikes law , which is identical to the one on the ballot , is clogging the system with trials because those facing life in prison are unwilling to plea bargain .</TEXT>
