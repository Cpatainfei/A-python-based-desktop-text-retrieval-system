   <TEXT> Keeping a lawn alive and well can be a frustrating experience -- even for a determined yard owner . It always seems to need something : water , sunshine , mowing , thatching , debugging , fertilizing . Why bother with a lawn ? you may ask . Because , despite the attention it needs , it does several things very well -- like provide a soft , comfortable area for play or relaxation , and , on the practical side , reduce dust and help prevent soil_erosion . There ' s no other plant quite like grass , says turf grass expert Michael Henry , environmental horticulture adviser for Orange , Riverside and Los Angeles counties with the UC Cooperative Extension . &quot; It ' s hard to match the color , texture and density of lawns with any other kind of plant_material . Aesthetically , lawns also provide a nice contrast to ground cover , shrubs , trees and flower beds in the garden. &quot; Despite how common lawns are , they are probably the most misunderstood and poorly treated of plants , says Steve Hollister , a California-certified nurseryman and manager of Armstrong Garden Center in Irvine . By keeping grass short and growing it close_together , people force it to grow against its nature . &quot; Most people would n ' t recognize their lawns if they saw them growing naturally in an unmowed state , &quot; says Hollister . &quot; It ' s like growing a rosebush and not letting it get more_than six inches high. &quot; If your more immediate concern is keeping the lawn alive this summer , don ' t despair . Armed with the right information and a willingness to give your lawn the attention it wants , you too can have a healthy crop of grass . Here are some tactics for keeping your lawn at its best : WATERING Experts say that most people fail their lawns when it comes_to watering . &quot; Typically people water lawns too often with an insufficient amount of water , &quot; says Hollister . When you water once a day for just a_few minutes at a time , water doesn ' t penetrate the ground more_than two to three inches . Such shallow watering prevents grass from developing a deep , healthy root system , which makes_it vulnerable on hot summer days . Because they ' ve been watering every day , though , many people don ' t know that water stress is the problem . Stress from lack of water is often hard to detect until the lawn begins to yellow , and by that time things are really bad . &quot; When a lawn undergoes drought stress , it doesn ' t immediately turn yellow but from a distance will look a dark , dull green , as opposed to vibrant , shiny and healthy , &quot; says Hollister . &quot; Another indication of stressed grass is if your footprints remain on the grass after walking over it . This means that the lawn ' s water pressure is low , &quot; he says . Each time you water , give your lawn a deep , thorough drink , and you ' ll be rewarded with deep-rooted grass strong enough to fight scorching summer days and drying Santa Ana winds . Although watering requirements vary for different grass types , in_general , lawns should be watered one to three times a week , depending_on the weather . During periods of rain you may_not need to water at all , says Hollister . You should apply about half an inch of water to the ground each time you water . All sprinkler_systems are different , however . To evaluate your system , see how long it takes_for half an inch of water to collect in cups or cans set around the lawn . By checking different locations , you also get a better picture of dry and wet spots . You may find , for instance , that it takes your sprinklers about 15 minutes to deliver half an inch of water . However , unless you have a perfectly level lawn with excellent drainage , you ' re likely to get pooling and runoff if you douse a lawn with 15 minutes of water all at once . To ensure absorption , water for three to five minutes at a time at one-hour intervals until you reach the optimum watering time for your lawn . CHECKING MOISTURE To see if your lawn has been getting enough water , you can perform one of several tests . &quot; Stick a screwdriver into the ground , &quot; suggests turf expert Henry . &quot; The screwdriver should easily penetrate four to six inches for warm-season grasses and six to 12 inches for cool-season grasses . If the screwdriver gets stuck indry soil before reaching these depths , the lawn isn ' t getting enough water. &quot; You can also use a moisture meter inserted to the same levels or simply take a mound of soil and try to form a ball with it . If the ball crumbles , the soil isn ' t wet enough . If you ' re having trouble getting water into your soil , try a soil wetting agent , which will help water penetrate reluctant lawns . This can be found at nurseries and only needs to be applied a couple times a year . CORING You can also get water to penetrate the ground by coring your lawn . This refers to extracting deep , skinny cores of soil with a manual or mechanical sod coring tool that looks_like a long , skinny cookie cutter . This coring not only allows water penetration , it also loosens and aerates the soil , which is very good for the lawn . When coring your grass , it ' s also a good time to apply a mulch , which will fall_into the holes . This mulch will cool the grass roots and break_down , creating a healthier soil . For mulch , use planter mix or lawn seed covers . In general you want 1 1 / 2 to two cubic_feet of mulch for every 100 square_feet , says Hollister . Such a concentration will disappear after a_couple_of waterings . Experts don ' t recommend spiked &quot; aeration &quot; shoes . These shoes don ' t aerate the soil , but actually compress it . MOWING Many mistakes in lawn care are made in mowing , says Henry . He notes that contrary to popular_opinion , grass clippings should be left on the lawn . &quot; Leaving grass clippings on doesn ' t harm the grass at all , &quot; he says . The grass decomposes and returns nitrogen to the lawn , and this practice reduces the materials sent to landfills . There are mulching mowers on the market that automatically return grass clippings to the ground . Many people wait too long between mowings . &quot; You don ' t want to cut_off more_than one-third of the grass at any one mowing because mowing too_much can send the grass into shock , &quot; says California-certified nurseryman Gary Matsuoka of Laguna Hills Nursery Inc. in Lake Forest . Many grasses need to be mowed once a week , and some fast-growing types -- such_as hybrid Bermuda -- twice a week during warm weather . How close to cut your grass depends_on the type . In general , most cool season grasses like fescue should be cut no lower than three inches in the summer and a little lower in winter . Bluegrass and rye_grass combination lawns should be cut about two inches , hybrid Bermuda much shorter at about three-quarters of an inch , and St . Augustine anywhere from one-half to two inches . Also make_sure that your lawn_mower blade is sharp . Dull blades will tear grass edges , which gives a lawn a brown or yellow cast from a distance . DETHATCHING Dethatching is another important maintenance task that leads to a healthy lawn , says Matsuoka . Thatch is a harmful buildup of plant_material that impedes air and water movement to the soil . To dethatch , you need to rent a machine that will remove dead plant_material from the lawn . Dethatching should be done about once a year , depending_on your lawn type . When thatch isn ' t taken_care of , lawns tend to die_out in areas , leaving bare spots . PESTS Pests and disease aren ' t too_much of a problem for mixed lawns that have more_than one grass type . If you have a pure lawn , however , there is a chance you could have some trouble . Most single grasses are vulnerable to certain insect problems such_as cut worms , web worms and grubs . Such problems respond to herbicide treatment . There are also biological controls on the market , but they haven ' t been thoroughly tested , says Matsuoka . Take_a_look at many well-established lawns in Orange County and you ' re bound to see grass mixtures . Not only are such mixes more resistant to pests and diseases , if you have a cool season and warm season combination , the lawn can look green all year . Another way to have green grass all year is to have a warm season grass like hybrid Bermuda and seed annual rye_grass every fall . The rye_grass will remain green all winter while the Bermuda becomes dormant and yellow . FERTILIZING Finally , to be its best , a lawn should be fertilized on a regular basis . What it really needs is nitrogen , because it is constantly regrowing the leaves that have been cut_in mowing . A fertilizer is identified by three numbers , such_as 10-6-4 , the first being nitrogen content , followed by phosphorus . Although how much fertilizer you use will vary according to your grass type , in_general you should fertilize a lawn with about four pounds of nitrogen per 1 # 000 square_feet each year , says Henry . This typically means fertilizing three or four times per year . All fertilizers , whether organic or not , should be used according to instructions . Watering Lawns Correctly Watering roots properly allows roots to grow deep into soil . After two days surface dries but with deep root system lawn stays nourished . In one week , soil becomes very dry , leaving roots stressed . Shallow-rooted turf grass wilts . Source : NK Lawn and Garden Co .</TEXT>
