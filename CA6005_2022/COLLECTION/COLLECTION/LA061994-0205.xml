   <HEADLINE> 200 ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION OPPONENTS ATTEND CONFERENCE ; BORDER : ORGANIZERS AND PARTICIPANTS HOPE TO WIN PASSAGE OF CONTROVERSIAL SAVE OUR STATE INITIATIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nearly 200 opponents of illegal immigration gathered Saturday for an all-day workshop on the issue , offering solutions to what some called the &quot; out-of-control problem &quot; of undocumented immigrants arriving here . Groups from across the state that oppose illegal immigration and seek to cap the number of legal immigrants allowed into the country annually participated in the conference , organized by United We Stand America and held at the Sequoia Athletic Club . They said they hope to combine their efforts to win passage of the controversial Save Our State initiative , which sponsors hope to place on the November ballot . Mark Sturdevant , coordinator of United We Stand America ' s immigration task_force , called the alliance ' s plan to protect the country ' s borders &quot; tough love. &quot; The SOS initiative seeks to prohibit illegal immigrants from receiving public social_services , educational benefits and health_care . It also would make_it a felony to manufacture , distribute , use or sell false documents in_order to obtain benefits . The initiative needs the valid signatures of nearly 385 # 000 registered voters by June 30 to qualify for the November ballot . Sponsors have turned_in nearly 600 # 000 signatures , of which more_than 200 # 000 have been validated . Speakers told attendees at the conference that there was still much work to be done to ensure the initiative ' s passage . During an afternoon workshop , speakers taught the group to express concerns by writing their elected representatives and local newspapers , calling radio talk_shows and joining organizations that focus_on immigration issues . &quot; We want to teach people how to be effective when talking to politicians , &quot; said Alf Powers , spokesman for United We Stand America . &quot; We aren ' t here to rehash the issue , but to achieve solutions. &quot; Activist groups such_as Save Our State and Californians for Population Stabilization were joined at the conference by State Rep . Richard L . Mountjoy ( R-Arcadia ) ; Phil Romero , chief economist for Gov . Pete Wilson ; U.S. Rep . Ed Royce ( R-Fullerton ) and Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley , who supported the mostly older crowd ' s desire to get involved in the immigration issue . &quot; The federal_government has not defined the immigration laws and without a clear definition , there can be no solution , &quot; said Cordelia Spicer , issues adviser to Ross Perot , whose 1992 independent presidential campaign gave_rise to United We Stand America . &quot; We want to be humane , but our laws have created an underground ( society ) of immigrants. &quot; Romero said groups opposed to illegal immigration have been accused of racism but contended the issue isn ' t about race . Wilson ' s &quot; concern ( with illegal immigration ) has nothing to do with race , &quot; Romero said . &quot; His sole concern is to lift the financial burden caused by illegal immigrants. &quot; Mountjoy agreed , saying : &quot; What is racist about wanting to protect our borders ? Nothing . It ( the initiative ) will pass because it is right and because it is supported by all races , religions and creeds. &quot;</TEXT>
