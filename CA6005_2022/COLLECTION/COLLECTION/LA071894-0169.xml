   <HEADLINE> SCIENTISTS THRILLED BY BIRTH OF FISH , SALAMANDERS ABOARD SPACE SHUTTLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Baby fish and salamanders popped_out of eggs at record speed aboard the space shuttle Columbia on Sunday , thrilling scientists who want to know how human babies might develop in space . &quot; that ' s in the future , &quot; said Japanese project scientist Shunji Nagaoka . Astronaut Richard Hieb reported that six or seven fish hatched , the result of orbital trysts . Researchers said it is the first known case of vertebrates -- in this case guppylike Japanese Medaka fish -- mating and reproducing in space . There was bad news , however , on the mechanical front : Hieb flushed bubbles from a jammed cell-separating machine and got_it running_for the first time in the flight -- but only for an hour . Researchers need the Japanese-made unit for experiments involving worm DNA , rat growth_hormones and mouse cellular secretions . The unit uses an electric_field to separate cell components . As of Sunday , nine days into the laboratory research mission , about 18 newts and innumerable baby fish had been born_on Columbia . All of them appeared normal , Nagaoka said . Biologists are studying the mating , development and behavior of aquatic animals in weightlessness to see if astronauts could raise fish for food and have healthy babies in space -- necessities if humans are to ever live permanently in space .</TEXT>
