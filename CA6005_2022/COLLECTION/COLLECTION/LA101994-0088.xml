   <HEADLINE> STUDENTS SPELLBOUND ; CELEBRITY : EARVIN ( MAGIC ) JOHNSON SPEAKS AT LAGUNA BEACH HIGH_SCHOOL ABOUT AIDS , HIS CAREER AND THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About 400 cheering parents and students packed the bleachers in the Laguna Beach High_School gymnasium to hear former basketball star Earvin ( Magic ) Johnson speak about the importance of education , his career with the Lakers and how he is coping_with HIV . &quot; I talk_about HIV to help you to understand that it ' s out there and it ' s here to stay , to make you think before doing things , &quot; said Johnson , who received a standing_ovation from the crowd . &quot; Talk to your teachers . It ' s not all about having HIV or AIDS . It ' s about getting somebody pregnant . None of us want to become early parents. &quot; He told the audience that the safest_sex was no sex and urged those students who do not abstain to practice safe_sex . Asked by one student how he deals with the human_immunodeficiency_virus , Johnson said : &quot; I just live . . . . You get_up in the morning and you take your medicine and you work_out for two hours . You don ' t have to think_about it ; it ' s with you every day . God blessed me with my family , my great health . I ' m doing outstanding. &quot; In the hushed gymnasium , one 14-year-old boy told Johnson that &quot; it took a lot of character for you to get_up and talk_about AIDS the way you did. &quot; Johnson , 35 , announced in 1991 that he had tested positive for HIV , which causes AIDS . Johnson also impressed upon his young audience the importance of education and gave some advice to aspiring basketball_players . &quot; Make_sure you get your education , because if you don ' t make_it , you ' ve got something to fall_back on , &quot; he said . &quot; If you don ' t put 125 % into it , you ' re not going_to make it. &quot; During an hourlong question-and-answer session , students wildly waved their hands , eager to be the ones to ask Johnson questions , which ranged from how he got his nickname to whether he missed basketball . The walls were hung with posters welcoming him . Johnson promised one young fan that he would come and play basketball with the Laguna Beach Boys and Girls Club . Asked who most inspired him , Johnson said it was his father who helped him out the most . &quot; But I think you have to inspire yourself , &quot; he said . He said his goals were to own his own basketball_team , have more children and travel around the world . * &quot; I think he ' s great , &quot; said Bobby Marquette , 9 . &quot; It ' s nice to know that he cares about other people , not just himself. &quot; &quot; Magic is the epitome of what winning is all about , of making other people around you better and always keeping a smile on your face , &quot; Gary Arthur , 40 , said as he sat on the floor with his three children , Ryah Sky , 6 , Aria Star , 5 , and Morea Light , 3 . Arthur clutched two T-shirts that he had brought as presents for Johnson and his wife , Cookie . &quot; A picture with Magic , that would make a huge moment in my life , &quot; he said . Nine-year-old Jensen Gray clutched a piece_of_paper headed &quot; Dear Magic. &quot; &quot; I wanted to ask him what was it like to be HIV-positive and how are you doing , &quot; the youngster said . Another admirer gave Johnson flowers . Arthur was equally enthusiastic . &quot; I love the guy . I love what he does , what he stands_for , the influence he ' s had_on my life , &quot; he said . &quot; He rises to the top ; he makes the most of himself. &quot; Arthur even got_to ask his hero how he managed to inspire so many . &quot; The key to making anybody better is first you gotta get_out of yourself and into somebody else , because all_of us are into ourselves so_much , &quot; Johnson said . &quot; I always want to see somebody else happy . My mom was the social butterfly in Michigan . If there was somebody sick two blocks down , she was the one cooking for them . I owe it all to my mother. &quot; * Johnson was in town at the invitation of his longtime friend and City_Council candidate Mel Owens . Earlier this week , the city was in an uproar over flyers distributed by Owens ' campaign saying that Johnson ' s speech would be followed by a $ 90-per-person political fund-raiser hosted by an area gallery . In response to protests from school officials , Owens canceled the fund-raiser so the high_school assembly could proceed without involving the Laguna Beach Unified School District in what some might consider a political event . But a private reception was still held at the gallery after the speech , and though there was no charge , only friends of Owens and Johnson were allowed inside . As Johnson left the high_school gym to attend the reception , he was mobbed by eager young fans clamoring for autographs and handshakes . &quot; You young people dream , &quot; was his final message , &quot; because before you can become what it is you want to . . . you have to dream it . Education is the key , especially now. &quot;</TEXT>
