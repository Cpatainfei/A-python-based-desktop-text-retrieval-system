   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG : A CHIP OFF THE SAME OLD BLOCK ; TELEVISION : WILL ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD BLACK_OUT VIOLENT PROGRAMS REALLY HAVE ANY IMPACT ON REAL-LIFE VIOLENCE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It would be nice if television_sets were equipped with electronic chips that automatically rejected everything and everyone found to be annoying : most infomercials , certain newscasts , Dick Vitale , Rush Limbaugh , Richard Simmons , Mr. Blackwell , Tom and Roseanne getting high on themselves . Pick your peeve . But much of the public appears interested only in vetoing violence . Thus it ' s the &quot; V &quot; chip that ' s on the slab here for dissection -- proposed technology that would repel entertainment programs labeled violent . In a feeble move to buy_time and placate critics , broadcast and cable-TV companies this week said they would form an independent monitoring board to measure and periodically report on violence in entertainment programming . Even with &quot; independent &quot; observers in the mix , these annual state of the industry messages would have a serious credibility problem . &quot; Trust us to do the right thing , &quot; the TV people seem to be saying . That would be naive , to say the least . The trustworthiness of an industry in which two networks ( CBS and Fox ) are greedily rushing projects onto the air to capitalize on the unresolved Menendez case speaks_for itself . More significantly , however , the cable industry also agreed to begin rating its programs and to support proposed legislation that would require new television_sets to have an electronic chip that , if the owner wanted , would block_out programs that had been encoded with a &quot; V &quot; ( for violence ) rating . ( Of course , the &quot; V &quot; chip essentially would be worthless if the rest of the industry did not join the cable companies in rating programs , and the networks are_on record as opposing the idea , fearing the ratings would scare_off some advertisers. ) A prediction : Even if the &quot; V &quot; chip were enacted with the cooperation of the entire TV industry , resulting in a dramatic decline in violent programming , it would have virtually no impact on the level of real-life violence . Although Capitol_Hill ' s anti-crime bandwagon is practically collapsing under the weight of politicians seeking to blame television for some of the nation ' s problems , this is a cynical , quick-fix strategy that will yield few actual benefits . If they were really serious about protecting the health of Americans through legislation , these Big Brothers could do a lot more good by banning cigarette smoking . ( Yes , yes , to say nothing about cracking_down further on guns. ) But what the heck . If this is what the public wants instead of merely being able to switch channels -- if this will be the defining test of whether TV violence causes or contributes to real-life violence -- why not give_it_a_try ? Why not a law , for example , that not only covers the &quot; V &quot; chip but also combines it with mandatory violence ratings ? What would be the harm ? At the very least it would temporarily shut_up some of TV ' s more self-serving critics . The networks and cable companies would do their own rating , and of course there would be inevitable disputes about the accuracy of their labels . What rating would be applied to shows , for example , that aren ' t explicitly violent but create an atmosphere of terror ? And what about &quot; The Simpsons , &quot; within which there is frequently a satirical cartoon segment , titled &quot; The Itchy and Scratchy Show , &quot; that ' s as violent as anything on television ? Would &quot; The Simpsons &quot; be stamped &quot; V &quot; and get swept_away in the wash of live-action violence rejected by the electronic chip ? One possible remedy to that dilemma would be a rating_system with several levels of &quot; V &quot; to accommodate these shades of difference , which is technologically possible , according to the office of Rep . Ed Markey ( D-Mass. ) , the House telecommunications subcommittee chairman who has initiated one of the &quot; V &quot; chip bills being pressed_on Capitol_Hill . In any case , having the industry wield its own &quot; V &quot; would keep the federal_government out of program content . Thus , no censorship . As for the argument that a &quot; V &quot; chip would conflict with the First_Amendment , it ' s hard to see how . No one ' s freedom of expression would be violated any more_than the Playboy Channel ' s rights are diminished by those cable viewers who choose not to subscribe_to it . Instead , parents and other viewers merely would be exercising their own_rights to shield their homes from that expression . Another criticism : Cross one line and it ' s an even shorter step to the next one . With a &quot; V &quot; in place , how many chips_off the old block ? How long before the emergence of mandatory chips_in conjunction with such other ratings as &quot; S &quot; for sex , &quot; N &quot; for nudity and &quot; L &quot; for language ? Perhaps not very long . But again , what would be the harm ? Of course , this is all futuristic . If &quot; V &quot; chip legislation were enacted today , it would take at least a decade , probably two , to sell enough of the newly equipped sets and allow the system to operate long enough to draw even some preliminary conclusions about the technology ' s impact . And even if nothing was proved , it would n ' t matter . By then , there will be new bandwagons .</TEXT>
