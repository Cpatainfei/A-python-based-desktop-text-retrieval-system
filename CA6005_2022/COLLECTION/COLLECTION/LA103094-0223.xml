   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS / SCHOOL_BOARD ; CONSERVATIVE TRUSTEE MAY BE JOINED BY OTHERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since her election two years ago , Ventura County School_Board member Wendy Larner often has voted alone . On issues ranging from sex education to a pay raise for the county schools_superintendent , Larner has been the sole trustee opposing the four-member majority . But she may_not be alone much longer . Three other candidates embracing some of the same conservative views_as Larner are running_for three available seats in November . If even only two of them win , their viewpoint may hold_sway on the county school_board . In Simi Valley , Walt Madrid , executive_director of the conservative group Citizens for Truth in Education and a member of the local chapter of the Christian Coalition , is vying against incumbent Al Rosen and attorney Daniel R . Gonzalez . Conservative Christian homemaker Angela N . Miller is opposing incumbent Juanita Sanchez-Valdez , and college teacher Jeffrey N . Moss is in the race for the seat representing the Oxnard and Ventura area . And in Thousand Oaks , businessman Marty Bates is challenging incumbent Doylenne G . Johnson . Bates shares certain views with Madrid and Miller that distinguish the three from other candidates in the field . Of the eight candidates , they are the only ones who support Proposition 187 , the ballot initiative that would ban illegal immigrants from public_school classrooms . The three share something else : They decided to run_for the board after the firing of county schools Principal Dan Flynn . The county board approves the budget and oversees policy for 17 county-run schools and programs serving youngsters who are severely disabled , who have run_into trouble with the law or who have been kicked_out of their home districts . Flynn was principal of the three schools for youths who are in jail or juvenile hall when he ran in the June election against his boss , County Schools Supt . Charles Weis , for Weis ' job . Flynn lost , but it wasn ' t his defeat that galvanized his supporters to run_for the county board . It was his firing by Weis less than three weeks after the election . Although the superintendent said he dismissed Flynn solely because of poor job performance , many Flynn supporters suggested the firing smacked of political revenge . * At the first board_meeting after his dismissal , about two_dozen Flynn supporters showed_up to protest the action . Madrid , Miller and Bates were there . Some political observers said the race amounts to a poll of the public ' s views of Weis versus Flynn . &quot; This is a referendum on the firing of Dan Flynn , &quot; said Michael Dunn , who represents Thousand Oaks on the county ' s Republican Central Committee . &quot; If you think that firing was justified , vote for Chuck Weis . If you think it was mean and uncalled-for , vote for Walt Madrid , Marty Bates and Angela Miller. &quot; Weis agrees that the board race seems to be partly about him . &quot; Somehow it seems they are trying to get_back at me for doing my job , &quot; he said . After the firing , Flynn supporters turned their ire not only on the superintendent but also on the board , demanding that trustees overturn Weis ' decision . But board_members said their hands were tied . While local school_boards appoint their superintendents and also make decisions about firing teachers and principals , the county board has an elected superintendent who is solely responsible_for personnel decisions . Four months after Flynn ' s firing , the issue is still fueling some candidates ' campaigns . Angela Miller says one of her first tasks as trustee would be to review Flynn ' s firing . Both the Ventura County counsel and the state_attorney general have issued opinions that only the county superintendent has jurisdiction over hiring and firing , but Miller wants to get additional legal interpretations . Now a 43-year-old housewife , Miller formerly worked as a singer with rock ' n ' roll bands . She left that career after experiencing a religious conversion , she said . Like Larner , Miller opposes sex-education programs that include information about contraceptives . * All the other candidates , including Madrid and Bates , say they favor teaching about contraceptives while also promoting sexual abstinence among youths . Besides changing the sex-education program in county-run schools , Miller said she hopes to influence teacher training throughout the county . The county board votes on grant funding for some of the hundreds of workshops the county superintendent ' s office holds each year for public_school teachers . Like Larner , Miller said she is particularly concerned about workshops on sex and AIDS education . Miller is running against incumbent Sanchez-Valdez and the third candidate , Moss , in the race to represent the Ventura and Oxnard area . Appointed to the board in 1993 to replace a trustee who resigned , Sanchez-Valdez , 64 , is a retired educator . She taught for 10 years in private Catholic_schools in Los Angeles and worked 21 years in the Oxnard School District , including as a principal and district administrator . Although she said she also wants to investigate whether the board could expand its powers over personnel matters , she said her main interest in serving as trustee is the disabled and troubled children in county-run schools . &quot; I ' m interested in children with problems , &quot; she said . Sanchez-Valdez said her 24 years in this county help make her an effective trustee . Miller moved to the county from Los Angeles in 1990 , while Moss , a Los Angeles native , came from Santa Barbara to Ventura one year ago . Moss has received the endorsements of the county ' s Unity Pride Coalition , a liberal gay-rights group , and the Ventura County Federation of School Employees , the union representing about 200 educators at the county-run schools . Besides teaching part time at Cal State Northridge , Moss is working toward his Ph.D. in education at UC Santa Barbara . He also has 20 years ' experience working with nonprofit groups for the disabled . One of his goals , he said , is to ensure that the county schools office and local districts are not duplicating each other ' s efforts in areas like special_education and drug-use prevention programs . He emphasizes that he has no specific agenda to push_on the county board . &quot; I don ' t believe_in any one philosophy , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m here to represent the people of this district. &quot; And he said he decided to run partly out of a concern that conservative Christians may take_control of the board . The same concern helped motivate Gonzalez in Simi Valley to enter the race for the seat representing that area . But the 39-year-old attorney , who was endorsed by the union of county schools employees , shares at least one goal with the more conservative candidates : He believes county trustees should show more independence from Weis . &quot; I think they basically rubber-stamp a lot of policies that come_across their desk , &quot; Gonzalez said . A past board president of the Simi Valley Free Clinic and past president of the Simi Valley Bar Assn. , Gonzalez is now a vice_president of the Ventura County Mexican-American Bar Assn . If elected , Gonzalez said he would try to get businesses , police and churches more involved in county schools to help steer youths away from crime and into jobs . Also in the Simi Valley race are incumbent Rosen and candidate Madrid . Elected in 1989 , Rosen , 67 , has 12 years ' experience as a substitute and full-time teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District . Rosen said he wants to be reelected because of his long experience in education . &quot; I spent so many years in the system , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ve lived education. &quot; Like Moss , Rosen said he wants to eliminate duplication of programs between local districts and the county superintendent ' s office . And while he denied charges that the board lacks independence , Rosen said he has a great_deal of confidence in Weis and other administrators in the superintendent ' s office . Although the county schools office has become a favorite target of some conservatives , the third candidate in the Simi Valley race -- Walt Madrid -- said he is enthusiastic about some programs run_by the county superintendent , like the training of principals . * Active in conservative groups , Madrid sides with the conservative Christian movement in his support of taxpayer-funded vouchers for private_school tuition and other issues . But he differs in his support for teaching students about both contraceptives and sexual abstinence . Madrid , who works as a purchasing agent for a Westlake Village military hardware company , is also distancing himself from the furor over the firing of Flynn , even though it was that issue that sparked Madrid ' s interest in the county school_board . &quot; I ' ll probably get condemned for this , &quot; he said , but county trustees should put the Flynn episode behind them . &quot; That has to do with the prior board. &quot; If elected , Madrid said , he would try to keep voters better informed about the board by holding regular meetings for constituents . Bates is making the same campaign pledge in Thousand Oaks . Contending that trustees have done a poor job of representing voters , Bates said he would meet with interested residents before all board_meetings . Owner of two small companies that market high-tech devices used in medical_care , Bates , 57 , said his business experience would help him guide the board ' s review of school budgets . Like Larner and Miller , Bates said he is interested in reviewing the teacher-training workshops run_through the county schools office . Students need to learn more of the basics in reading , writing and arithmetic , he said . And teacher training may be the place to start with this change in emphasis . &quot; Those are the areas everyone complains about . So those are the areas where we need to give teachers information. &quot; Bates is challenging incumbent Doylenne Johnson , who was appointed to the board six years ago and who ran unopposed in her first election . Although she now works full time as a supervisor at the Broadway department_store at The Oaks mall , Johnson was for many years a homemaker who volunteered with the local and state Parent-Teacher Assn . She said she takes a special_interest in the students served by the county schools . &quot; Children at risk are the faceless children of the community , &quot; she said . Johnson said she was also concerned about Flynn ' s firing . But she said trustees &quot; are caught between a rock and a hard place &quot; because of their inability to act_on personnel matters .</TEXT>
