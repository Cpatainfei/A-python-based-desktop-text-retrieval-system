   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : THREE VIEWS OF WHERE WALL_STREET IS HEADED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The rallies in_stock and bond markets last week suggested that the spring &quot; correction &quot; may have run its course . Long-term interest_rates finished the week slightly lower than the week before , and stock prices rebounded convincingly after plunging early in the week to their lows of April 4 -- which was the market ' s worst day yet this year . So is it off to the races again ? Obviously , that ' s one possibility . But for the first time since this bull_market began in October , 1990 , Wall Streeters admit that they have to consider two other scenarios : That a bona_fide bear_market is under way , or that we ' re in_for neither bull nor bear , but instead a seesawing stock_market in which only the savviest of traders will make real money . What follows are the arguments for each of the three scenarios : * The bull_market resumes . At its lowest close of 3 # 598.71 last week , the Dow Jones industrial average was off 9.5 % from its all-time high of 3 # 978.36 reached on Jan . 31 . The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks bottomed last week 12.2 % below its record high . To the bull camp , history has been satisfied : We ' ve had a very normal 10 % to 15 % &quot; correction &quot; in_stock prices , the kind that often interrupts bull_markets for a time . But enough is enough . The nominal catalyst for stocks ' selloff , of course , has been the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s decision to tighten credit for the first time in five years . The Fed has raised short-term interest_rates from 3 % to 3.75 % so far this year , ostensibly to slow the economy and thus keep inflationary pressures at_bay . With both short- and long-term interest_rates rising , it was natural that the stock_market would convulse temporarily , the bulls say . But the crux of their case for a resumption of the bull_market is that the Fed will succeed in moderating the economy ' s growth without having to force interest_rates dramatically higher . &quot; In my view , we are still quite early in what I believe will be a prolonged slow-growth ( economic ) cycle , &quot; says Byron Wien , investment strategist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co . in New York . The bulls don ' t believe stocks are expensive relative to corporate earnings . So if interest_rates stabilize and the economy continues to expand , albeit more slowly than during the last two quarters , rising profits should be the lure that draws buyers back to stocks . More important , says Wien , is the potential for corporate profit_margins to widen -- i.e. , for companies to earn more off each $ 1 of sales , as business improves but costs are held_down by tight-fisted managers leery of expanding . &quot; Margins , in a secular decline since the 1960s , are beginning a period of secular improvement -- a fact that has escaped many analysts . As a result many earnings estimates for 1994 and beyond will turn_out to be low , &quot; Wien contends . Stefan Abrams , investment strategist at Trust Co . of the West in Los Angeles , also is an unabashed bull . He expects one more &quot; modest hiccup &quot; in_stock prices in May or June , as evidence of a slowing economy causes some investors to fear that a full-fledged recession is imminent . But when Wall_Street realizes that the economy ' s progress will continue , &quot; the bull_market will resume in_earnest , &quot; Abrams says . * We ' re in a bear_market . The bear case is based primarily on one theme : The Fed ' s shift to tighter credit , after five years of relatively easy_money , has produced a sea change in investor psychology . There simply won ' t be enough buyers of stocks and bonds going_forward , the bears argue -- but there remain plenty of sellers . That will translate into higher-than-expected bond yields and a stock_market that could lose another 10 % , 20 % or more of its value , probably in a slow decline extending into 1995 , many bears say . &quot; The single most important fact for investors to understand is that . . . the Fed is no longer on your side , &quot; says Charles LaLoggia , editor of the Special Situation Report market_letter in Rochester , N.Y. He says investors will increasingly see bank CDs and other &quot; cash &quot; accounts as a decent alternative , as the Fed ' s tightening lifts short-term interest_rates above 4 % . At the same time , even investors tempted by stocks will focus_on share price-to-earnings ratios which , if no longer at record highs , could hardly be termed cheap . What about the bulls ' case that a slow-growing economy and rising corporate profits will support stocks ? Study history , the bears retort : Severe bear_markets have often struck in years when the economy grew and profits boomed . Think_of 1962 , 1966 and 1987 . The overriding issue for stocks and bonds at any time , say the bears , is whether the number of potential buyers is large enough to offset the potential sellers . After three years of wild global speculation in bonds , and of unprecedented stock mutual_fund purchases by small investors , the markets are loaded with people who have good reason to sell if they fear that the tide has turned against them . With the bloodshed in_stocks and bonds so far this year , &quot; people are finding_out that they can lose money , &quot; says Dan Sullivan , editor of the Chartist investment newsletter in Seal Beach . And the potential buyers , he says , now understand there ' s no hurry . &quot; We ' re overdue for a traditional type of bear_market , &quot; Sullivan argues . If this one is traditional , stocks will lose more_than 25 % of their value before it ' s over , he says . If that ' s more_than you can swallow , sell now , Sullivan advises . * We ' re stuck_in a &quot; trading range. &quot; Some Wall Streeters can ' t agree fully with either the bull case or the bear case . This group sees the market alternately rallying and selling_off for the rest of this year and perhaps through 1995 -- and , in the end , making painfully little headway . Like the bull camp , the trading-range camp believes the economy will slow , and that any additional rise in interest_rates this year won ' t be extreme . But like the bears , the analysts who expect a trading range believe that stocks have long been pushing the outer limits of &quot; fair &quot; value , relative to earnings and dividend yields . Add it all up , and you get a stock_market likely to seesaw , as the positive effects of rising corporate earnings are offset by the knowledge that higher interest_rates ( and probably higher inflation ) will reduce the value of those improved earnings to shareholders . Arnold Kaufman , editor of Standard &amp; Poor ' s Outlook newsletter in New York , is bracing his clients for a market in which meaningful gains will be elusive . &quot; We ' re looking_at below-average gains for the next few years at least , &quot; he says . &quot; We think returns ( on the S &amp; P 500 index ) will be in single digits , and we could well see low single digits. &quot; Interestingly , many Wall Streeters have argued that the 1990s are a replay of the 1960s -- with decent economic_growth , low inflation and relatively high price-to-earnings ratios on stocks . What is forgotten , however , is that all_of the money made in the ' 60s was made in the first_half of the decade . Then , from 1965 to ' 75 , the market rode a roller-coaster that was a terrific environment for smart traders , but a disaster for many buy-and-hold investors . If the market ' s advance so far this decade has already discounted much of the good economic news ahead , a seesaw pattern may be the best Wall_Street can expect for many years to come . A ' 60s Flashback ? Many Wallstreeters like to compare the 1990s to the 1960s , a period of decent economic_growth and low inflation . What ' s painful to note is that virtually all_of the money made in_stocks in the 1960s was made in the early part of the decade . The latter part of the ' 60s and the early part of the ' 70s saw stocks trapped in a trading range_in which buy-and-hold investors saw little net price appreciation . S &amp; P 500 index net price change : 1960 to 1965 : + 59.1 % 1965 to 1970 : -0.3 1970 to 1975 : -2.1 1960 to 1975 : + 55.2 Source : Standard &amp; Poor ' s Corp .</TEXT>
