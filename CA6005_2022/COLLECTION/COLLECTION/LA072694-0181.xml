   <HEADLINE> MOVING TOWARD PEACE ; POTHOLES MARK ROAD TO MADRID II ; DIPLOMACY : GOAL OF ENDING ALL CONFLICTS , AS 1991 SUMMIT ENVISIONED , IS STILL DAUNTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Jordan ' s King Hussein and Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands for peace on the White_House lawn Monday , American officials already were dreaming of a summit of all leaders of the volatile Middle_East to end decades of war among nations , generations of tensions among peoples and millennia of conflict among religions . The site : Madrid , where the peace process opened in 1991 and where American officials now hope it will formally close . &quot; It was launched in Madrid . This may well be the place to have everyone come_back at the end for closure , for sanctification and for talks_about what the future represents , &quot; said a senior Administration official deeply involved in the negotiations . But the road to Madrid II is_full of potholes . The stunning breakthroughs over the last year -- beginning with the Palestinian-Israeli declaration in September -- look easy in contrast to what lies ahead . The next six to 12 months will be the most critical in what is likely to be a process of three to five years , American , Israeli and Arab officials agree . The best and worst cases are already visible . &quot; If everything goes according to schedule over the next year , then you ' ll see expanded autonomy for the Palestinians in the West_Bank , a peace_treaty with Jordan and a breakthrough with Syria &quot; that includes senior officials talking to each other about terms for full peace , said Ehud Sprinzak , a political_scientist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem . &quot; The worst case , &quot; Sprinzak added , &quot; would be lots of distractions , violence and assassinations . The Palestinians could be in_trouble because they don ' t have a good administration or enough money to make ( autonomy in the ) Gaza ( Strip ) and Jericho work . Israeli settlers could become more militant . The Syrian track could stall . And fighting along the Lebanon border could get hotter. &quot; The overall goal is maintaining momentum as the various efforts by Israel and its immediate neighbors are woven together into a complete tapestry that will not easily unravel . &quot; Peace that is not comprehensive will be vulnerable to all sorts of disruptive forces , &quot; said Yair Hirschfeld , a Haifa University political_scientist who was pivotal last year in establishing secret Israeli-Palestinian talks in Oslo . &quot; In a way , it would be a dangerous peace. &quot; Further , both the United States and Israel face elections in 1996 . As the election draws closer , Rabin particularly will lose his ability to maneuver on an already controversial issue . The next steps toward peace fall_into five categories . JORDAN : After the signing here Monday , prospects for a full-fledged peace_treaty with this nation appear the most promising . On the eve of the signing , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres predicted in identical language that a treaty is &quot; a matter of months. &quot; U.S. officials expect Monday ' s nonbelligerency treaty to result in greater contact between Israelis and Jordanians : tourists mixing_in the resort cities of Aqaba in Jordan and Eilat in Israel , for example . A day after the Jordanian and Israeli foreign_ministers met at the Dead_Sea last week , an Israeli company was advertising tours of Jordan in the Jerusalem Post . Most cross-border travel is initially expected to be by Israelis , the senior U.S. official said . PALESTINIANS : Despite the famous handshake 10 months ago between Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat , the Israelis and Palestinians must still work_out daunting issues . Among them : terms for expanding Palestinian autonomy in the West_Bank ; redeploying Israeli forces from Arab towns and Jewish settlements , and determining the timing and terms of elections . &quot; In less than a year , we went from almost zero contacts to . . . negotiations that are continual . . . , &quot; said Nabil Shaath , chief negotiator and planning minister of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho . Yet this track also holds the potential for slowing the peace process . Azmi Shuaibi , Palestinian minister of youth and sport , said Monday that Palestinian elections , originally expected in October , now seem unlikely this year . The potential is also growing for an Israeli backlash against Palestinian autonomy , particularly in places such_as the West_Bank town of Hebron , also home to the most militant Jewish settlers . SYRIA : This remains the biggest prize but also the biggest problem in the peace process and the most controversial step for Israel . All issues -- notably how much peace for how much land and over what timetable -- remain unsettled . The most optimistic American scenario envisions Christopher ' s shuttle diplomacy resulting in a breakthrough with Syria over the next six months , with a peace_treaty sometime next year . Yet Israeli support for returning the Golan Heights , which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle_East War , does not exceed 5 % , according to a recent survey . Support for limited or partial withdrawal has risen from 35 % to 45 % in the past year , but the only deal Syrian President Hafez Assad says he will accept is total withdrawal . After using the need to confront Israel as justification for his rule , Assad must also transform public_opinion to accept full relations with the Jewish state . LEBANON : Peace efforts have become largely a function of progress with Syria , which has a 35 # 000-man garrison in Lebanon . Because Lebanon is Israel ' s most volatile neighbor , Israel wants a treaty that includes an end to attacks by Hezbollah and other extremist groups -- six months after which it will withdraw from the southern Lebanese enclave it has dominated since the late 1970s . The fragile state of Lebanon ' s government will make enforcement of any agreement difficult . OTHERS : Over the past three months , Israel and most other Arab states have made substantive progress . Negotiators are now developing projects to address threats to peace : regional arms proliferation , radical groups , population growth and socioeconomic instability . U.S. officials are also optimistic because the five-part process has an indirect but critical component : an infrastructure for peace .
