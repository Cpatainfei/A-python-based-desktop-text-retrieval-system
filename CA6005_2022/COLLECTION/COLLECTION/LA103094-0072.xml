   <HEADLINE> WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; THE LIFE AND TIMES OF DARYL MITCHELL HELP MAKE ' LARROQUETTE ' GO ' ROUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Daryl ( Chill ) Mitchell of NBC ' s &quot; The John Larroquette Show &quot; has found that his own life translates well on screen . In 1989 , when Mitchell was working as a musician and deejay , he met Reginald and Warren Hudlin , brothers in search of a movie concept for rappers Kid N ' Play . &quot; I talked to them about how a group of us got_together , played music and rapped at parties , &quot; Mitchell recalls , on a break from &quot; Larroquette. &quot; &quot; And they decided that ' s what their movie should be about. &quot; The Hudlins ' movie evolved into 1990 ' s successful &quot; House_Party &quot; ( Reginald directed and Warren produced ) . On the set of &quot; Larroquette , &quot; where he plays angry lunch-counter vendor Dexter , more of Mitchell ' s stories about his past have found their way into the series ' scripts . &quot; I can say , ' This stuff happened to me , but it was like this . . . ' and they ' ll put it in , &quot; he says . &quot; You can write it , but if you can ' t feel it or relate to it , you won ' t really know it . But when I can talk_about my life and it gets_in , it works good. &quot; Despite what he calls a &quot; rough &quot; childhood growing_up in Long_Island , Mitchell says he ' s never as angry as Dexter . &quot; For me , when things got negative , I fought_back in a positive way . Dexter ' s anger is a cop-out , a way to pass the buck , blame someone else . No one ' s forcing him to stay there . He controls his destiny . But I think he ' s gonna start maturing and growing. &quot; Growing_up , Mitchell was grateful to rest_on the laurels of his three older brothers ' tough reputations . &quot; It was a rough time . I have five siblings , but my father had a total of 14 kids , and at one time we all lived together. &quot; He searched for activities outside the home : &quot; Where I grew_up , we didn ' t have Little_League or football , or anything like that . Rap is the Little_League of the ghetto. &quot; Mitchell ' s interest in hip-hop grew when his friends got_together to rap . &quot; We had the hip-hop thing , &quot; he explains . Acknowledging it sounds like the old ' 40s &quot; Let ' s put_on a show &quot; movie mentality , he explains : &quot; We got a crew together of 20 kids who pitch_in and buy equipment , form a crew , do parties and rap in people ' s back yards. &quot; That crew evolved into the three-man rap groove group Groove B . Chill , which eventually put_out two records . While the group no longer performs as an act , they produce music together . Currently , Mitchell is producing three other acts : a solo R &amp; B artist , a &quot; girl group &quot; and a rap artist . His own music remains constant and he ' ll soon return to it as a solo performer . &quot; I ' ve been reluctant , &quot; he says . &quot; First , my acting career took_off , and second , rap_music took a turn_into a gangster profile and that ' s not me . I listen to it , there ' s something to be said there , but it ' s not me . It would be like me trying to do ... salsa ! &quot; He likes to listen to what he doesn ' t perform : &quot; I even listen to opera . I don ' t know a word they ' re saying , but I like the way it sounds. &quot; Mitchell says he ' ll patiently wait until his own melodic rap style comes_back : &quot; Everything has its time . Once it goes_back to my flavor , then it ' s my time again. &quot; It ' s certainly his time on television , says &quot; Larroquette &quot; creator and executive producer Don Reo . &quot; He ' s a natural and one of my favorite actors in the whole world . He has this ability to take what we write and make_it real and believable and honest . And he ' s a really nice person to work with , &quot; Reo says . Next week , Mitchell appears in the Hudlins ' &quot; Cosmic Slop &quot; on HBO . &quot; It ' s crazy , &quot; he says of the show , &quot; like ' Twilight Zone , ' but really out there. &quot; And next month he begins shooting the feature &quot; Quiet Time in Hollywood , &quot; about a youth ' s tough time growing_up on the streets of Hollywood . Alluding to his own youth , he says , &quot; Ah , it ' s all_the same , what ' s happening in Hollywood is happening everywhere . It happens in New York , South Carolina , all over. &quot; &quot; The John Larroquette Show &quot; airs Tuesdays at 9:30 p.m. on NBC . &quot; Cosmic Slop &quot; airs Nov . 8 at 10 p.m. on HBO .</TEXT>
