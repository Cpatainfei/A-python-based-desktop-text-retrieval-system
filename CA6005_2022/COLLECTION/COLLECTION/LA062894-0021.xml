   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ; GERMANY LOOKS EAST FOR LABOR ; LOW WAGES IN HUNGARY , POLAND AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC ARE LURING BUSINESSES . BUT WHILE CAPITAL IS NOT YET POURING OVER THE BORDER , THE TREND IS PROVOKING EDGINESS AT_HOME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a Monday morning , Lutz Kahlbau leaves his family in Berlin to drive four hours east past the old Iron_Curtain and on to the former state-run factory that he manages for its new owners , the German company Siemens . Kahlbau oversees 700 Czech employees turning_out electromechanical relays , switches and_circuit boards for Siemens ' European market at about one-twentieth the cost of producing these components in Berlin , where Kahlbau often returns for the weekend . &quot; We are in a happy situation . Because of the growth of our market shares , we don ' t have to kill jobs in Germany , &quot; Kahlbau said . &quot; But of course , labor-intensive work has a better chance in countries with low labor costs . None of our competition is starting new products on the Champs-Elysees . They are starting in Thailand and Shanghai. &quot; Others , like Siemens and thousands of other small and large German firms , are investing in post-Communist Eastern Europe , primarily Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic , and provoking an edginess back home familiar to Americans . &quot; Korea at Our Front_Door , &quot; cries a headline in Germany ' s Stern magazine . &quot; More and More Businessmen Migrate , &quot; reads another in the daily Frankfurter Rundschau . &quot; Our Mexico , &quot; business people call neighboring countries . Nearly one in three German companies intends to transfer part of its production outside the country in the next three years , according to a recent poll by the Assn . of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce . In the survey of more_than 10 # 000 companies in western Germany , the favorite destination was Eastern Europe , where Deutsche Bank estimates that 5 million jobs -- equivalent_to more_than 15 % of the German work_force -- could move_in the next five years . Like American firms that argued in favor of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement linking the United States with Canada and Mexico , German companies cite high domestic labor costs as the main reason for their plans to move production across the border . Manufacturers say they must cut costs to remain competitive or lose even more German jobs ; Eastern Europe is their opportunity . But so far there is no giant sucking sound of German_capital whooshing across the border , as might have been expected . German investment in Eastern Europe has been tempered by a recession at_home and the need to develop the former East_Germany , where western German firms invest about $ 40 billion a year . And direct investment by German companies still totals less than $ 3 billion and is second to the Americans ' . In 1993 , for instance , Germany invested about $ 1.10 billion in the East , compared to U.S investment of about $ 1.12 billion , according to Deutsche Bank and the U.S. Department_of_Commerce . The German investment is significant , however , given that there was almost nothing before 1989 , and the upward trend clearly will continue . Germans were first off the mark to invest in the former East Bloc after the fall of communism in 1989 and 1990 . Production at the Trutnov plant , one of about a dozen that Siemens has in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet_Union , has grown 15 % annually since the plant opened under Siemens in 1992 . But the company still employs more_than three times as_many people in Berlin as in Trutnov to make electromechanical components . This may explain why , despite the headlines , German unions do not see as much of a threat from cheap foreign labor as did American unions that fought tooth and nail against NAFTA . Rather , union leaders agree with manufacturers that it is in Germany ' s interest to strengthen the economies of its eastern neighbors . They say estimates of lost jobs do not take_into_account those created by East European_countries purchasing German machinery and consumer goods . Hans-Georg Wehner of the German Union Federation contends that Deutsche Bank ' s prediction of job losses is part of a scare campaign to push_down the high wages and benefits that western German workers enjoy -- in some industries , the highest in the world . &quot; Jobs are lost here and there , but you have to see that the volume of investment taking_place over there is not that big . Overall , it doesn ' t shake us , &quot; Wehner said . Meanwhile , the relatively modest investment has had the positive effect of quieting fears in the East and West that Germany would thoroughly dominate Eastern Europe . Germany was the logical economic partner for its neighbors in the East . Many Poles , Hungarians and Czechs already spoke German . They provided cheap labor and potential markets right on Germany ' s border . And Germans had experience there . &quot; Germans know the market -- ( auto_maker Ferdinand ) Porsche started his career here , &quot; said Jan A . Havelka , general_manager of the semiautonomous CzechInvest , which is charged with attracting foreign investment to the Czech Republic . &quot; At the beginning there was reasonable concern about such a powerful economy showing such enthusiasm . . . . &quot; But Germans are not dominating the situation in a way that could be politically sensitive , &quot; he added . &quot; They are looking east . They know the emerging markets from the post-Communist countries could be the big chance of the 21st Century . But they have certain disadvantages , like World_War II. &quot; Many Eastern Europeans continue to fear domination by Germans , who occupied their countries during the Third_Reich . For that reason , German investors in the Czech Republic say it suits them just fine that Germans and Americans are_on an equal footing in that nation , each with about 30 % of foreign investment . Like other Eastern Europeans , Czechs generally view German_capital guardedly . They need it but are wary of becoming too dependent_on it -- and on the Germans . Down the road from Siemens ' Trutnov plant , about 90 miles northeast of Prague , is the Ekvita textile_machine manufacturer , a Czech-German joint_venture in which the German firm Georg Sahm has about 25 % of the shares . &quot; When we privatized the firm ( in September , 1992 ) , I was standing_in the yard with empty hands , &quot; said Jaromir Jelecek , one of the Czech owners . &quot; The bottom fell_out of the industry , and we had to find a way_out of the situation . We decided to find a partner . We would have preferred it to be Czech capital , but we have to accept it ' s German . Who came here first when this was empty ? &quot; Jelecek said Czech owners and managers get_along_with their German business associates well , although &quot; occasionally we find they insist on their way of solving a problem even though the Czech way would be better. &quot; His was a diplomatic assessment of what other Czech business people consider to be out-and-out German arrogance . At the nearby Grund-Textil factory , owner Grazyne Grundova explained that she and her husband opted to tough out hard_times rather than take German investors into their bathroom-rug company . They rejected offers from large German manufacturers to buy them out or form a joint_venture with their company , which now boasts 40 employees in the Czech Republic and another plant in Poland . &quot; We wanted to be a 100 % Czech firm . We don ' t need them or their money , &quot; Grundova said . &quot; To drag_in the Germans so they will order you about , no , no , no. &quot; In Prague , the Timo producer of ladies ' lingerie chose a middle ground . About 10 % of its production is piecework for the German Felina line , but the Czech company turned_down a contract from a second large German firm in favor of an Italian one . &quot; This way we have help with know-how and fashion , &quot; said Vladimir Mracek , one of the owners . &quot; The problem with the Italians is that for them time is not money . There ' s no organization , no payment . During the summer , no one works . But their fashion is really very nice . &quot; With the Germans , the business side is very strong . Pure contract . What they promised is done . But there are no new ideas there , &quot; he said . Nonetheless , thousands of small , medium-sized and large German firms have found partners and investment opportunities in the East . The lion ' s share of German investment has gone_to Hungary , the Czech Republic and Poland , where in each case at least half the economy is now in private hands . Deutsche Bank predicts growth in all three countries this year . The Czech Republic is considered one of the most stable and hospitable environments for foreign investors in Eastern Europe . With a highly educated work_force and long experience in a broad range of finished industrial products , the country has been able to move quickly into export markets . Foreign companies are drawn primarily by the low cost of labor -- an average of about $ 250 a month for a full-time industrial worker , compared with $ 1 # 562 in eastern Germany and $ 2 # 500 in western Germany . And yet , Juergen Moellering , of the German-Czech Chamber of Industry and Commerce , warns potential investors that labor is only a part of the cost of production . Czechs work more hours and take fewer vacations than Germans , but their productivity is lower , Moellering says . Bureaucracy abounds . An investor starting a business from scratch in the Czech Republic may need up_to 17 permits , Moellering said , and faces infrastructure problems and a shortage of Western-style management . &quot; I know of two companies that left because they didn ' t get a telephone , &quot; Moellering said . But companies like Siemens with long overseas experience view all_of this as natural . They see the Czech Republic at the center of a vast new market in Eastern Europe . &quot; This is just a growing phase &quot; in East European industries , said Trutnov plant manager Lutz Kahlbau . &quot; If you want to grow with them , you can do it. &quot; Cutting_Down on Labor Costs Wages in the former East Bloc are one-tenth those in Germany . * Wages : Average monthly wage for a full-time industrial worker ( estimates in U.S. dollars ) Germany : $ 2 # 500 Poland : $ 225 Czech Republic : $ 250 Hungary : $ 275 * 1994 German Investment Through April ( in millions of U.S. dollars ) In Hungary : 476.8 In Czech Republic : 195.2 * In Poland : 168.0 * Includes Investment in Slovakia * Source : Deutsche Bundesbank</TEXT>
