   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; A TURF WAR FOR URBAN SQUATTERS ; A NEW YORK GUERRILLA GROUP RECLAIMS ABANDONED TENEMENTS TO GIVE THE POOR A DECENT PLACE TO LIVE . BUT SUCCESS IS OFTEN FLEETING , FOR THE CITY IS BENT_ON ROOTING OUT THE UNLAWFUL COLONIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Away from the majestic pinnacles of Manhattan , so_much of this city is like the steerage compartment of an immigrant ship , neglected old buildings at the edge of ruin , 200 # 000 families living doubled or tripled up , working people paying half their income for a_few feet of warmth and a foldaway bed . The vacancy_rates in New York ' s poorer neighborhoods hover around 1 % . There is a 10-year wait for public housing . Shelters for homeless families are_full beyond capacity . People sleep outside , swathed in blankets of newspaper and cardboard , their real_estate the city ' s benches and portals and rooftops . There is something baffling as well as sad about this housing shortage . Thousands of abandoned buildings honeycomb the_Bronx , Brooklyn and Harlem -- a surplus teasing at all_the want . Some of them are skeletonized and crumbling but others are recoverable with simple applications of piping and drywall . Inevitably , there are those among the poor who ask : Why can ' t we have these windy spaces for ourselves ? With their own tools and money and sweat , they are ready to recast the hollows into livable housing . But they fail to understand the unbending rules of a complicated metropolis . Urban renewal , like the law , is nothing to be taken into your own hands . Dominican immigrant Antonio Rodriguez is one of those failing to appreciate this . In a typical week , the cab driver earns $ 150 . Of that , he pays $ 80 for a 7-by-12-foot room he shares with two sons and a daughter . Their sleeping area is a geometric puzzle of two beds and the bare floor beside a refrigerator . Rodriguez , 49 , keeps asking himself : &quot; How can all these empty buildings just be sitting there in this of all cities , the capital of the world ? &quot; So he was easy to recruit , joining a loosely_knit group called Inner_City Press / Community on_the_Move . Its members scout among the vacant hulks , move_in , start repairs . For the past five years , their unlawful colonies have vexed New York ' s mammoth Department of Housing Preservation and Development , the landlord of a vast , woeful empire of buildings seized for unpaid taxes . HPD , of course , prefers to make its own plans for its own property . Four times now , the city has rooted_out Inner_City squatters , unhinging more_than 100 families from their improvised homes . These mass evictions -- using the tactic of surprise -- are dreadful events , squads of police busting through doors , overwrought people coursing tears , possessions scattered and lost . The displaced are perplexed by their expulsion , disbelieving that their hard labors go unappreciated . &quot; We were working people , repairing a building little by little , &quot; said Amado Campbell . &quot; What are we to do now ? &quot; Indeed , what are the desperate to do ? Sea to shining sea , poor Americans are hard_put to find affordable housing . It is not simply a matter of who is homeless and who is not . For every homeless_person , there are tenfold getting_by only after agonizing choices : meat on the table or higher rent , crack-heads in the halls or higher rent , doubling_up with relatives or higher rent . This past decade was one obliging to the rich but calamitous for the poor . The stock of private low-cost housing eroded . The federal_government retreated from the construction of new units . The economics of the post-industrial city produced a battering one-two punch of higher rents and lower wages . &quot; The building boom of the ' 80s never filtered down to the poor &quot; said Michael A . Stegman , assistant secretary for policy development and research at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development . &quot; We have 5.2 million families ( about one in 15 Americans ) either paying more_than 50 % of their incomes for housing or living_in substandard units. &quot; The share of household income used for rent is at a 25-year high , according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard_University . The poorer the renter , the tougher the squeeze . The Harvard researchers classified 3.5 million households as extremely poor ( earning less than a quarter of an area ' s median income and receiving no housing subsidies. ) Of those , about 70 % paid more_than half their income in rent ; another 22 % lived_in housing in serious disrepair . New York -- this great human ship taking_on water -- is overwhelmed . Between 1988 and 1992 , a total of 239 # 425 residents spent time in a homeless shelter . That is 3.3 % of the population , and includes one in 20 of the city ' s children . Officials here have not turned their backs . They boast that New York has directed $ 2 billion toward new housing in the past four years -- three times that of the nation ' s next 50 largest cities combined . But the demand for more low-income apartments seems insatiable , beyond the fathoming of planners . Antonio Rodriguez , six years in America and still stymied by English , knows_nothing of city housing policies . He works hard , he pays rent . The cabbie might be able to earn more picking_up fares , but he has to be choosy about who he stops for . Last year , 42 taxi drivers were murdered here . It was a friend who suggested he contact the Inner_City group : &quot; They open the lock , and you can just go in. &quot; One sleety day , he visited the squatters and was saucer-eyed at the roominess inside one of the already occupied buildings . The apartments might well have cost $ 700 a month in the prevailing market . Rodriguez then took a drive with an Inner_City organizer , stopping at a South Bronx low-rise . On the red brick exterior were white-stenciled letters : property owned by City of New York . The squatters were thinking_of taking_over the building and had already replaced HPD ' s padlock with one of_their_own . Rodriguez ventured in , across a threshold of trash . The place looked disemboweled , most of its walls and ceilings stripped to their structural bones . A haphazard mulch of wood and old clothes and scraps of paper filled the floors shin-high . Beneath a broken window was a moldy mattress , rotting away like a side_of_beef . Doors were wrenched off their hinges . The stairway had loose steps , and the banister was gone . Drug_addicts had rummaged around and left their signature crack vials , but no one had really lived there for years . The latest newspaper was from 1985 , opened_to an ad for the movie , &quot; The Gods Must Be Crazy. &quot; A 1983 collection letter demanded payment for &quot; ambulance services rendered. &quot; A note on pink stationery promised : &quot; Gary , I went_to the store . Be right back. &quot; Rodriguez walked among each of the four apartments , the ending of one hard to tell from the start of another . The air was musty , and dust hung_in every rod of light . Cold filled his mouth , a puff of steam escaping with each breath . He counted rooms and measured windows . Something was incomprehensible to him . &quot; This has just been sitting here abandoned ? &quot; he asked . &quot; I can ' t believe it . Some of these walls don ' t even need Sheetrock , just scraping maybe , a little compound over there . The garbage ? It ' s nothing , just throw it out . &quot; This is a beautiful place , a room for my daughter , a room for my sons. &quot; THE SQUATTERS : Working Poor Stake Claims in Hostile Slums Squatters are not peculiar to New York . Every city has its share of urban_guerrillas . In the 1970s , authorized &quot; urban homesteading &quot; was even in_vogue -- the updated , citified variation of a great folk myth , courageous settlers overcoming the elements in a hostile slum . Homesteading still goes_on in some cities , but the aim is mostly gentrification rather than low-income shelter . In Wilmington , Del. , the first homesteader was a tax attorney with DuPont . New York has had a homesteading program too . Its premise was the standard one , allowing people to &quot; buy &quot; tumbledown housing with the &quot; sweat equity &quot; of their rejuvenating labors . But only designated buildings are eligible under the plan , and HPD has not added_to its list since 1986 . Homesteading is now seen here as a nobly romantic but highly inefficient housing strategy : Big buildings are not Tinkertoys . Renovations require skilled labor , up_to code . Squatters cannot wait . Drug_addicts are the most visible , commandeering vacant lairs like soldiers on a house-to-house search . Then there are the &quot; anarchist squatters &quot; of the Lower East_Side , many of them refugees from the middle_class with noms de guerre and an acquired hatred of private_property . These days , the working poor make_up an increasing share . Inner_City got its start in 1987 on the shoulders of Matthew Lee , a 23-year-old on_fire with high ideals and anti-Establishment politics , his mind sketching out conspiracy theories as easily as a child plays connect-the-dots . Lee , then unemployed , began publishing a newspaper with a donated mimeograph_machine . Inside was a sampling of his poetry and information about the hows and whys of squatting . A few dozen people responded , and the aspiring organizer was able to coax a handful to a meeting . They were Puerto Ricans and Hondurans and Dominicans , needy people neediest for the same thing : a decent place to live . They decided to look_for a building of_their_own in the_Bronx , a borough teeming with Latino immigrants as it once had overflowed with newcomers from Europe . The place they chose was city-owned and had been empty for eight years . Each of its 20 units had big bedrooms with dulled but intact parquet_floors . The front windows faced the broad greenery of Crotona Park . Seventy years before , Leon Trotsky had lived a_few blocks away , waiting for his revolution . Further_east , Sholom Aleichem gave_vent to life ' s bittersweet in his final Yiddish stories . The Crotona building needed a daunting amount of work , but people were eager . They packed tons of rubble into burlap potato sacks bought from a vegetable wholesaler . Discarded wood-frame windows were salvaged from construction sites . Drywall went_up , beams were replaced . Small amounts of electricity were pirated by running wires to street_lamps . Later , someone with the know-how shimmied down a manhole and connected the building to the main power_line . The labor was mostly done on weekends . People learned basic skills on_the_job . Vandals had raided the plumbing for its value as scrap metal , and new pipes had to be installed . Neighbors and passers-by often volunteered . Strong coffee was always brewing . In the winter , workers took turns_around a wood-burning stove , rubbing their hands together as if washing them in the heat . At first , the group had planned to fix_up the building and then somehow get the city ' s OK before moving_in . But construction went_on for a year or so , and the waiting was hard . The six Alvarez sisters -- all with small children -- were living doubled-up , as_many as 15 people in a two-bedroom flat . Anything with more space seemed better . Finally , the squatters went_ahead and set_up house . All this time , HPD was watching . The city had more elaborate plans for the building , renovations of its own . In early 1989 , someone from HPD dropped_off a sheaf of eviction orders , which hit with the force of a cold splash of reality . People wanted to know : How could the city do this to us after all our work ? The squatters appealed_to attorneys at Legal Aid for help . And , to their relief , they discovered how one law could be nimbly invoked to outmaneuver another : The eviction papers had never been properly posted at each door . The legal victory was emboldening to a collection of immigrants , few of them acquainted with U.S. courts or even the_English language . Months went_by , and HPD still failed to get its paperwork in_order . Then there was a long calm . Maybe the city had given_up ? After all , it owned so many buildings and this one was already occupied . Word of the group spread , and the membership multiplied . On some Saturdays , a_few hundred people showed_up to work . The squatters decided to take_over the abandoned building next door and then they added other big apartment_houses nearby . By late fall of 1990 , Inner_City was opening a building a week . &quot; We were really cooking , &quot; Lee recalled with customary apostolic vigor . &quot; It was true empowerment , people making their own decisions on every nail . We knew it was illegal , but so what ? People were alive . People were taking risks . &quot; Maybe I get lost in my own hype , but the poor have so little available to them that practically anything they do is illegal . Be a street vendor , you ' re illegal . Haul trash with no license , you ' re illegal . Fix an apartment , you ' re illegal . The only way to be legal is to sit in a shelter and give up. &quot; THE FALL : Blazes and Police Raids Take Their Toll But the momentum soon burned away . In December , 1990 , a fire broke_out at the first Crotona site . Lee -- habitually suspicious -- thought HPD might have set it . Inspectors were certainly Johnny-on-the-spot with a vacate order , and not just for the damaged building , but also the group ' s site next door . No legal technicalities stopped the city this time . About 200 police_officers in riot gear marched four abreast toward the buildings . A crowd quickly formed , including anarchist supporters , chanting : &quot; No homes , no peace. &quot; About 20 Inner_City squatters were holding_out inside . They wanted to make a stand , but were amateurs at impromptu defiance . They blocked a door with a refrigerator only to be surprised by cops who came_up the fire_escape . On Christmas_Eve , a second blaze lit_up one of the group ' s other buildings and left it a ruin . Five weeks after that , police forcibly removed the squatters at yet another site . All told , the people living_in 85 units had now lost their jerry-built homes . Inner_City ' s faithful were no longer so spirited . The squatters were becoming sullen and desperate and angry . And the turnouts on Saturday began to fall_away . THE BACKGROUND : Government Is Slow to Deal With the Problems America ' s social_contract has important omissions , such_as : If you want to work , you can . And if you do_work , you can live_in at least somewhat-dignified circumstances . As things go now , the working poor often do not have much of a deal . They earn too_much to collect welfare , but not enough to pay the bills . Society may revere the notion of home and hearth , but housing itself is just another ware for purchase and sale , a commodity rather than a right . There are some federal funds aimed at low-income housing ; HUD ' s annual budget , for example , is $ 25 billion . But the nation ' s largest housing subsidy is the one written into its tax code , allowing deductions for mortgage interest on first and second homes . This deprives the Treasury of $ 46 billion a year , according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation . The biggest tax_breaks naturally accrue to those with the biggest mortgages : the wealthy . Housing aid for the poor has never been the enshrined policy of the homeowner deductions . During the 1980s , federal construction of low-income units was allowed to slide toward a halt . This blow was softened to a degree by the introduction of new tax_credits , encouraging others to do the financing . The use of rent vouchers also expanded , though in cities with housing crises , these were often of no more value than gift certificates to an empty store . Currently , with the poverty rate up and the supply of low-cost units down , housing assistance is received by only a third of the 13 million low-income households eligible . The Clinton_Administration has yet to struggle with this math . &quot; The budget environment is very , very difficult , &quot; said Stegman of HUD . The Inner_City squatters are mostly working people . They hold factory or restaurant jobs , where the pay is less than $ 200 a week . Or they work construction , where the salaries are higher but the labor is only off-and-on . HPD officials have never had a good fix on who their adversaries are . They speculate that most in the group are illegal immigrants , though that is not so . They also consider the squatters to be &quot; innocent dupes &quot; of Matthew Lee . &quot; He leads them to believe that the city will eventually let them keep their apartment , &quot; said Peter Cantillo , an HPD assistant commissioner . Actually , such statements are patronizing . The squatters are_well aware of what they are getting_into and how it might end . If some cleave to illusions , it is borne from a naive sense of social justice . In their innocence , many keep receipts for building_materials . &quot; That way , if the city throws me out , they can reimburse me for every penny I ' ve spent , &quot; said Pablo Pichardo , a father of three . After the first fires and evictions , Inner_City slowly began rebuilding strength and attracting new people . For most , squatting was simply a practical choice measured against what their rent was buying . Was it better to be a squatter in a building with no boiler or a renter in a place with no privacy ? Hilda Cruz had been paying $ 50 a week for a small room she shared with two other women . Ernesto Gallard , his wife and three children lived_in the back of a small store , sleeping on floor mats and using the alley for a bathroom . Squatting , of course , involves hardships , especially when a building is newly taken and the cold still comes and goes as it pleases . People are bundled_up in blankets like papooses . There is no running water ; bucketfuls are commonly toted_up from fire_hydrants and stored in 50-gallon drums . &quot; If you want a place of_your_own , you have to fight for it , &quot; said Paulina Gomez , a young restaurant worker with a child . &quot; I buy nothing for myself . My mother is very poor , and I don ' t send her any money because it all goes toward buying materials . These windows , with good metal frames , they cost me $ 570. &quot; Inner City appeals_to a determined few . A sizable number drop_out for one reason or another ; also , slackers who fail to work_on their apartments are sometimes ousted by others in a building . That way , those who stay are united by a sense of shared sacrifice . In some cases , those sacrifices are extreme . Dario Guzman and Marcelina Isabel , homeless after a rent dispute , accepted whatever opening Inner City had . They were the first to move_into a three-story structure in the South Bronx . Wires hung free from the walls , tangled like worms in a fisherman ' s pail . Rubbish covered the floors . They lacked shovels , so the two of them scooped at the mess with broken pieces of Formica . The squatters had a newborn to worry about . For days , they left the baby with friends . When they finally did bring him over , people on the block called the Bureau of Child Welfare . For years , only junkies had used the building ; they had reasonably concluded that someone was_on a binge with a baby in tow . A BCW worker hurried over and was surprised to find a solid married_couple fixing_up the front stairs . Still , he warned them that a dilapidated apartment was no place for their child . They had to go_to a homeless shelter -- or else . &quot; To tell the truth , he was right , &quot; Isabel said . &quot; It was crazy to have a baby in a place with no windows and the winter coming. &quot; But she refused to go_to one of the city shelters , so reviled here as hostelries of mayhem . Instead , she went_home to the Dominican_Republic and dropped the child off with her sister . She would call each week from New York to let him hear her voice . By spring , the apartment would be in good_shape . The baby could be brought_back . It was another of those ghastly choices for the poor , forever regrettable and worst for Isabel at night , when the tears would pour into her pillow . THE BUREAUCRACY : N.Y. Agency Struggles With a Thankless Job HPD is one of those godawful bureaucratic apparatuses set_up for impossible and thankless tasks . It is also among America ' s biggest slumlords , the manager of a burdensome portfolio of about 5 # 600 troubled buildings , including 3 # 500 with tenants . This amounts to 50 # 000 units , or enough to house the entire population of Stockton , Calif. ; or Hartford , Conn. ; or Little_Rock , Ark . Fifteen years ago , HPD ' s inventory was twice as large as it is now . By then , low-income housing had already become a big money loser in New York . Operating costs for decrepit , pre-World War II buildings were soaring . In poorer neighborhoods , with lower rents , landlords were simply walking away from their headaches -- or collecting the insurance from a timely act of arson . The South Bronx , a vast necropolis of brick tenements , had become a world-famous slum . In most cities , property seized for back taxes is auctioned_off , but that was impractical here . The buildings were precious only to those who lived there . To save a diminishing resource , the city felt compelled to enter the housing business . An obscure agency suddenly had to become a titan . The abrupt inheriting of so many buildings was a maddening challenge for HPD . Who lived_in them ? How much were the rents ? Did the boilers work ? Was it gas or oil ? HPD ' s management of the property , while flawed and costly , has nonetheless preserved tens of thousands of badly-needed apartments . The city is a terrible landlord -- forever behind in repairs -- but it has been able to divest itself of many of the buildings by partly subsidizing their sale and rehabilitation . Buyers have been tenants , community groups and private developers . No longer is the South Bronx a vast , eerie moonscape . In it are new blooms of brick . That is why the Inner_City group was such an annoyance . By 1991 , HPD had devised plans for each of its larger abandoned buildings . Every deal was a knot of arrangements , this-and-that financing with hither-and-yon approvals . Such orderly proceedings left no room for squatters and their urgencies . When dispensing standard damnations of the group , however , HPD officials most often mentioned other , less arcane concerns . The squatters were &quot; jumping the line &quot; ahead of their brethren poor , who were patiently waiting in shelters for city housing . They were also a hazard to themselves and their neighbors , cooking with illegal kerosene stoves . The city could not be seen to wink_at such things . But the squatters proved easier to lambaste than remove . HPD did not have the resources to patrol its abandoned buildings . It would have to tolerate the squatters until the very day that the agency itself -- or a new owner -- was ready to begin construction . Then the police could be enlisted to throw the interlopers out . Even then , many at HPD flinched . Ousting poor families was surely no beauty treatment for the self-image . Some agency higher-ups had themselves started_out as community activists and once considered squatting the tactic of heroes . Of course , that was 20 years ago , before things had become so coat-and-tie . Nowadays , even many of the most renegade of neighborhood groups had gotten_into the game with the moguls . They were incorporated , with foundation grants from Rockefeller and Ford and multimillion-dollar government contracts as social_service providers . HPD was their partner in developing real_estate . In fact , some of the agency ' s more conciliatory bosses felt the best solution was to have the squatters undergo a similar transformation . Why not polish_up the group and let it become another of HPD ' s not-for-profit housing partners : filing the proper applications , entering the financial pipeline , renovating in full compliance ? In March of 1992 , the squatters agreed to send representatives downtown to talk . The meeting was held around a handsome conference_table , the varnish so bright it was like a wood-grained looking glass . After the years of antagonism , there was an awkwardness in the air : so here were those stubborn squatters , so there were those heartless bureaucrats . Felice Michetti , then the HPD commissioner , was not among those kindly disposed toward the group . She was firm as a schoolmarm , delivering a civics lesson : Yes , she understood that rents were unaffordable . Yes , she knew they needed homes . But squatting was against the law . It would never be tolerated . The visitors tried to convert her with personal stories . They were living more safely now ; their children were healthier . Some had once been tenants in HPD-managed buildings . Their accommodations were better as squatters . One man , Enrique Deoleo , deeply resented the commissioner ' s lecture . Though well into his seventh decade , he was still tough as a pit bull , his neck the size of a small birthday_cake . He had been the first to live_in the group ' s largest building , using a flashlight and machete to skirmish with the rats . He rose to speak , removing his cowboy_hat before imparting a civics lesson of_his_own . &quot; Our buildings may belong_to the city , but the city is the property of the people and we are the people , &quot; he said with some extravagance . &quot; The city has two vehicles , a limousine for the rich to ride in and a tractor to dig a hole and push the poor inside to bury them. &quot; THE CLASH : Eviction Order Almost Ends in Tragic Death Among city housing groups , the Inner_City squatters are mostly known as hard-working and sincere , though even sympathizers have qualms . &quot; As a way of allocating scarce resources , allowing the takeover of buildings is not much of a program , &quot; said Andrew Reicher , an advocate for low-income housing . &quot; Homesteading , to be fair , has to have a selection process . Otherwise , it would just be a land rush . Competition would get ugly . You ' d have wars at construction sites. &quot; Another advocate , Harry DeRienzo , mediated between the squatters and the city . It was frustrating work . As a sign of good_faith , the city had requested a list of all_the group ' s sites . As a sign of their distrust , the squatters had refused . Discussions then died_out . &quot; When there ' s an impasse like that , someone has to take a risk and that should be the party with the least to lose , which I ' d have to suggest was the city , &quot; DeRienzo said . Inner_City ' s two biggest sites were actually well-known to HPD . They were those facing buildings at 670 and 675 E . 170th St . in the_Bronx . Large yellow signs at the front_entrances proclaimed the squatters ' presence . The group had occupied the 37 units for four years , but now HPD wanted to bring_in a private developer for a total rehabilitation . To ease the way , the city would nourish the project with $ 4 million in grants and low-interest loans . By July of last year , everything was set to go , except the squatters . Most of them ignored the flyers left by the city , offering help in relocation . The handouts made no mention of a vacate order or a deadline for clearing out . With mass evictions so messy , the police prefer the element of surprise . On the morning of July 8 , the heat was awful , burning toward 100 . The cops rolled_up in vans and buses , accompanied by some of the HPD brass . The street was quickly sealed_off . In moments , everything was motion . The police were_on the stairs , the roofs , in the halls . Batons banged on locked doors . The squatters were ordered to grab what they could and get_out . Maria Mata , age 61 , was caught in her underwear , preparing to take a bath . Suddenly , the police were pacing around her , clapping hands , shouting : &quot; Let ' s go , let ' s go ! &quot; Someone from the city snapped her picture , accumulating evidence . All around , disbelief mingled with commotion . There were sharp volleys of cursing and pleas . City workers were carrying furniture to trucks or dropping it in dumpsters . Demolition crews broke windows and tore_down walls . Plaster , like so_much crumbled old bread , once again coated the floors . People were desperate to locate their friends , personal documents , family photos . Francisco Herrera could not find where his wife had put their savings , nearly $ 1 # 000 . The police were hovering over him : &quot; Time is up ! Time is up ! &quot; Peter Cantillo was there for HPD . &quot; It was a terrible thing to watch , &quot; he said . &quot; The idea is to make the squatters feel the immediate need to leave . Few questions are answered . I don ' t have to tell you how many things they want to take with them , but once they get their personal belongings , that ' s it . &quot; The police have very little tolerance for people going_back in_for more . After all , what will they need at a shelter ? The furniture is supplied. &quot; When the eviction began , that rugged old-timer Enrique Deoleo , had been laying cement in the courtyard . &quot; Do you have any papers from the court ? &quot; he demanded of the police as they rushed by . Someone from HPD promised that he ' d be cared_for in a shelter . &quot; that ' s no different than a jail , &quot; he said . No one paid any mind when Deoleo climbed the six flights of stairs , going_past the cops stationed on the roof . In a_few seconds , he was at the ledge . &quot; What ' s going_on ? &quot; a policeman finally yelled , moving toward him . &quot; Stay away , &quot; Deoleo hollered back . Onlookers squinted up from the street . Against an azure summer sky , the squatter looked_like some possessed and bereft peasant farmer . A news photographer was snapping away . Please don ' t jump , thought Cantillo of HPD . He would later quip that he could see his entire career flash before his eyes . The cop on the roof kept coming . &quot; What do you want ? &quot; he asked . &quot; You ' re all a bunch of liars , &quot; Deoleo answered . The squatter then turned his back . He mumbled a_few prayers , made the sign_of_the_cross and opened his arms to eternity . He lunged , the cop lunged . The officer managed to grab Deoleo just as he pushed off . He yanked him back in and wrestled him down and handcuffed him . Then the wiggy old guy was charged with disorderly_conduct . THE AFTERMATH : Strategy Changes , but the Struggle Continues Eight months have passed , and most everyone from the 170th Street buildings still live_in hotels used by the city as family shelters , which cost the taxpayers about $ 80 a day per person , or $ 30 # 000 a year . &quot; We could use the money instead , &quot; said Amado Campbell . &quot; Why dump us in here with all_the drug_addicts ? &quot; There are the usual complaints about such places -- the crime , the noise -- but the former squatters are willing to wait it out . HPD has promised them city apartments , letting them &quot; jump the line &quot; ahead of other poor people after all . Supposedly , it is just a matter of cutting_through some final strands of red_tape . In recent months , the Inner_City group has changed strategy . Squatters are now settling into smaller buildings , ones with 10 units or less . They think HPD is less likely to bother with them now . The group has about 18 in all . On most Saturdays , the organizers drive the streets and creep around the brick corpses . By now , they are connoisseurs of abandonment , picking_out the better buildings the way an expert chef might select fresh_fish on the dock . There is another change too . Squatters at some sites have finally gotten Consolidated Edison Co . to sell them electricity , which was not easy . With no certificates of occupancy , the group had been like a provisional government without diplomatic recognition . They were ineligible for service . One of the new , smaller sites is a four-story walk-up in East Harlem . It is a relief to have lights now , but there is still no running water . Some of the men tried to dig a hole from the basement to the outdoor main , but it was a screwball idea and they became afraid the street would collapse on them . The building ' s occupants are a gritty , if star-crossed bunch . Maria Garcia de Santos , 26 , works in a factory , putting metal studs into dog leashes . The salary is $ 175 a week . A few months back , her husband , Andres , joined her in the United States . He has no paying job yet , though he does stock shelves for free at a nearby supermarket . &quot; When they do hire someone , it will be me , &quot; he said optimistically . Maria is reed thin , sharply featured , newly pregnant . She grew_up in the Dominican countryside , and New York is a colossus to her . &quot; I was ashamed to live_in an abandoned building , &quot; she said . &quot; The rats would smash into the front_door so hard , I thought it was a person and I would get_up to answer. &quot; In the evenings , she and Andres used to sit around a candle , their shadows flitting in the scars of dim light . &quot; I have a right to this place now , &quot; she said . &quot; Some people want everything easy . They won ' t come_into a place full of garbage . They would n ' t do things step by step , a window now , a door later. &quot; The man downstairs , Dario Solano , was determined that their building have a proper mailbox inside the front_entrance . He studied the postal regulations , installed and reinstalled the hardware , waited for the mail_carrier to come_up the street . &quot; Who lives here ? &quot; the postman asked . &quot; Bums ? &quot; Dario was proud to explain otherwise . &quot; No , &quot; he said matter-of-factly . &quot; It is the residents who live here. &quot; Times researcher Anna M . Virtue contributed to the reporting of this story .</TEXT>
