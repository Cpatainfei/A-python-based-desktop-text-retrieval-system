   <TEXT> Graham Stroude figures he might be dead today if his fiancee hadn ' t taken a second look_into her garbage_can last year . There she spotted a newspaper_article that described a Brooklyn clinic with unusual success in treating persistent cases of high_blood_pressure , like Stroude ' s . He had seen doctors about it , but &quot; I wasn ' t disciplined enough to religiously follow the medication , &quot; he said . &quot; Sometimes I would take the medication and sometimes I would not. &quot; That changed after a meeting with clinic director Dr. Samuel Spitalewitz . &quot; I sincerely believed I was_on the threshold of a stroke , &quot; said Stroude , 61 . &quot; That caused me to check_up_on myself and realize the danger I was facing . . . . I could have been dead today. &quot; Spitalewitz says he told Stroude the facts about high_blood_pressure and emphasized how medications would reduce the danger . The incident tells part of the story of how the clinic does its job . The clinic , which serves a largely black inner-city population , is at Brookdale Hospital Medical_Center , which has a more diverse patient mix . Black people run higher rates of high_blood_pressure and tend to have more severe cases than whites do , so doctors started the clinic in 1981 to deal with the problem , said Dr. Jerome Porush , chief of the medical_center ' s division of nephrology and hypertension . It treats only patients whose problem persists despite standard medical_care . And it works : a 1991 study found that blood_pressure was brought under_control in 86 of 105 randomly chosen patients , and substantially improved in 10 others . Those results are remarkable , said Dr. Elijah Saunders , co-founder of the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks . Hypertension is high_blood_pressure . The clinic ' s intensive approach to treating high_blood_pressure in the inner_city is not widely used , mostly because of cost , Saunders said . But money spent on controlling high_blood_pressure will save higher costs later on , he said . Without that preventive approach , patients &quot; will come_back with a stroke in a_few years , or a heart_attack , or their kidney ' s going_to go_bad and they ' re going to go_on dialysis . And it ' s going_to cost you thousands of dollars per patient , &quot; Saunders said . People at the Brookdale clinic &quot; deserve a lot of credit for what they are doing , &quot; he said . What are they doing ? Apart from the specialized expertise in the disease , Porush said , one important ingredient is that doctors , the nurse and even the clinic clerk take time to stress the medical consequences of ignoring medicines or appointments . That is key because high_blood_pressure usually causes no symptoms , which makes_it easy for a patient to forget or ignore medication . So patients hear repeatedly about the importance of taking medicines and keeping appointments even while feeling healthy . It sounds basic , but not all doctors elsewhere take so_much time , especially at the busy general medical clinic where most of the patients come from , Porush said . Stroude , who had gotten medications from several doctors elsewhere , said that in those offices the danger of uncontrolled high_blood_pressure &quot; was never discussed in any great measure. &quot; The clinic takes other steps to encourage compliance . Patients who miss an appointment get a call asking , &quot; What happened today ? &quot; nurse Alba Correa said . If a patient has moved , the clinic clerk may start calling relatives to locate him . &quot; We track those patients down. &quot; When patients do appear for an appointment , they usually are seen by a doctor within a half hour , Spitalewitz said . Saunders , the hypertension expert , called that &quot; incredible. &quot; &quot; You don ' t see that in most clinic systems , &quot; he said . &quot; If you get seen within two or three hours , you ' re doing good. &quot; Since salt can contribute to high_blood_pressure , Correa keeps a collection of nutrition labels from high-salt foods to show patients . A dietitian familiar_with the ethnic foods popular in the neighborhood also consults with patients . Correa also emphasizes losing_weight , because obesity contributes to high_blood_pressure . When the clinic scale shows a victory , &quot; we ' re all very glad and we clap , &quot; she said . On the other hand , when a portly man was reluctant to agree to a medical test , Correa was blunt . &quot; This is no good , &quot; she told him . &quot; You ' ve already had a stroke. &quot; Among the clinic ' s other features : Each patient is assigned a single doctor , family members are recruited to encourage medicine-taking and are taught about low-salt meals , and patients get Correa ' s phone_number to call with questions . Stroude says he is impressed by the level of commitment and the overall atmosphere of empathy . &quot; This is the first time I have encountered an environment that is so conducive to healing , &quot; he said . &quot; When you come_into this little place , you feel yourself at_home and you feel yourself as a participant. &quot; The clinic has treated about 1 # 000 patients since it began and handles about 300 at any one time . Once the blood_pressure is brought under_control , most patients return to getting care from the hospital ' s general clinic . But Stroude would rather not leave . &quot; I cannot think_about that , &quot; he said . &quot; I have a_few more years to live and I want to live it in health. &quot;</TEXT>
