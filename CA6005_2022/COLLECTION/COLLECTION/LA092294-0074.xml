   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL SCREENING : BOWERS EXPLORES HISTORY VIA DOCUMENTARIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; We just don ' t think there ' s any question that cinema is the art of our modern culture , &quot; says Brian Langston , a spokesman for the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana . &quot; We couldn ' t think_of not being involved in film to augment our programs. &quot; Though known as a showcase of more traditional paintings , sculpture and crafts , the Bowers has stepped_up its commitment in recent years to offering films as part of its admission , Langston explains . The recent Italian film series -- which featured Vittorio De Sica ' s &quot; The Bicycle Thief &quot; and Federico Fellini ' s &quot; La Strada , &quot; among others -- is a good_example . An ongoing series of documentaries , which continues tonight with &quot; The ' 20s : From Illusion to Disillusion , &quot; is another . This 80-minute film uses newsreel and other archival footage to describe the world during the 1920s . Covered are the stock_market crash of 1929 , the emergence of Charles Lindbergh and Ernest Hemingway , and the rise of Hitler and Mussolini . On Sept . 29 , three short films ( each about 15 minutes long ) arrive . The first looks_at the life of filmmaker D . W . Griffith , who created &quot; The Birth of a Nation &quot; and is generally considered the greatest silent-movie director . The others examine the careers of magician Harry Houdini and showman P . T . Barnum . &quot; The films ( like the one devoted to D . W . Griffith ) are valuable , we think , as a way to introduce our patrons to the important people in cinema , &quot; Langston says . &quot; Maybe from there , they ' ll go_on to learn more and see more &quot; of their work . The series takes a traveling approach Oct . 6 , when it takes_a_look at Florence , a hub of the Italian Renaissance . &quot; Florence , Portrait of a City , &quot; at 55 minutes , describes the city that was so influential as a cultural center , figuring prominently in the development of Michelangelo and other artists . On Oct . 13 , KOCE Channel 50 ' s production &quot; Visions of California : The Story of California Scene Painting 1925-1950 &quot; will be shown in conjunction with Bowers ' ongoing &quot; California , the Golden Years &quot; exhibition of plein-air paintings . It ' s back to the early days of movies Oct . 27 with &quot; Gangsters , Daredevils and Earthquakes , &quot; a group of four little-known shorts made in the ' 20s with ( as the name pretty much implies ) outlaws , daredevil stunts and natural disasters as the themes . W . C . Fields is the subject Nov . 3 . The &quot; W . C . Fields Festival , &quot; a 68-minute biography , features snippets from some of his better-known movies , including &quot; My Little Chickadee &quot; and &quot; David Copperfield. &quot; Another star , albeit a pint-sized one , is featured Nov . 10 . &quot; Classic Shirley Temple &quot; presents a series of shorts she made during the early ' 40s , including &quot; Managed Money &quot; and &quot; Merrily Yours. &quot; The full-length silent film &quot; The Mark of Zorro &quot; will screen Nov . 17 . The 1925 movie_starring Douglas Fairbanks will be accompanied by Robert Israel on piano . One of Fairbanks ' contemporaries , Mary Pickford , will be spotlighted Dec . 8 . Five shorts , all about 10 minutes long , will screen , including &quot; In Old Madrid &quot; and &quot; Sweet Memories , &quot; both from 1911 . The last offering of the year , on Dec . 15 , is a series of newsreels from the ' 20s , documenting several events , including the play of the New York Giants , the speeches of Mussolini and the discovery of Pompeii .
