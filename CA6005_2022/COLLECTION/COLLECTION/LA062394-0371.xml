   <HEADLINE> MAN ' S DEATH BLAMED ON INFECTION ; ARLETA : UNLICENSED HEALER TREATED JESUS ANCHONDO BEFORE HE SUCCUMBED . BUT THE CULPRIT WAS NATURAL CAUSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 22-year-old Arleta man who died last April after receiving an injection from an unlicensed healer died of a severe throat infection and not the injection , officials said Wednesday . &quot; He died of natural causes , that is the bottom_line , &quot; said Scott Carrier , spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner ' s office . &quot; It wasn ' t from an injection. &quot; Carrier said traces of antibiotics were found in the blood of Jesus N . Anchondo Jr . Anchondo went_into spasms and died April 10 after receiving a shot from Refugio Sandoval , 60 , at her illegal home clinic in Reseda , police said . He had complained of a fever and other flu-like symptoms . Sandoval , who authorities believe fled the country , is being sought by police for illegally practicing medicine , a detective with the Los Angeles Police_Department said . &quot; We still have an ongoing investigation of . . . practicing medicine without a license , &quot; said Lt . George Rock of the West Valley Division . &quot; The latest information from our investigation is that she is in Mexico. &quot; After Anchondo died , Sandoval left her Hesperia Avenue home , leaving_behind hundreds of bottles , vials and boxes of medicine , police said . The investigation suggested that Sandoval had been providing regular care to a large clientele for years . Unlicensed healers are popular in immigrant communities , particularly when the cost of regular medical_care may be prohibitive . In California , practicing medicine without a license is a misdemeanor . Rock said Mexican federal authorities might charge Sandoval , who is a Mexican citizen , with the same crime . &quot; They also have a problem with private practitioners who don ' t have a medical license , &quot; Rock said . Health officials said people who are unable to afford normal health_care often use unlicensed healers . &quot; These alternate practitioners are generally a group of people who sell an idea that they can help or cure people , &quot; said Shirley Fannin , director of the disease control program at the Los Angeles Department of Health Services . &quot; The general community is harmed by it , &quot; Fannin said . &quot; People who have conditions that can worsen , are usually worse by the time they get_to a hospital . And ( the care ) is not cheap . It is the most expensive cost-saving method that you have , especially if you have a disease that is curable in the early stages. &quot; Fannin said a person with streptococcal sepsis , the bacterial throat infection Anchondo died of , would need to be treated immediately because swelling of the throat shuts off the windpipe . &quot; It is considered a medical emergency , &quot; Fannin said . &quot; That is the difference between knowing what you ' re doing and not knowing , and that is why we regulate. &quot;</TEXT>
