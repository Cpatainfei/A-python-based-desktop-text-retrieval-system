   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL TROOPS DISARM SETTLERS AS HEBRON VIOLENCE SEETHES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an unusual show of force , Israeli soldiers disarmed and detained several Jewish settlers after a confrontation Saturday at the Cave of the Patriarchs , where a settler killed about 30 Palestinian worshipers last month . Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , meanwhile , said he would not move settlers out of the tense city of Hebron &quot; at this stage &quot; but hinted that he might later . In several neighborhoods in Hebron , soldiers clashed with Palestinian stone-throwers Saturday after the army lifted a monthlong curfew imposed to quell protests after the Feb . 25 massacre . Scores of youths pelted troops from behind barricades made of scrap metal and burning tires . Three Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire . Soldiers also fired tear_gas to disperse several hundred Palestinians gathered at the ruins of an apartment_house leveled this week in an army raid in which four gunmen from the Muslim militant group Hamas were killed . At least 21 people were hospitalized after inhaling tear_gas , including 15 children . Despite the lifting of the curfew , most of Hebron remained shuttered in mourning for the slain Hamas gunmen . Masked Hamas activists , carrying Palestinian flags , marched to a wake , chanting , &quot; Oh , martyrs , your blood shall not be wasted. &quot; In clashes elsewhere in the occupied lands , about 30 Palestinians were hurt Saturday . Israel Radio said an Israeli officer was shot and wounded while on patrol in Gaza . At the Cave of the Patriarchs , which has been closed to Muslim and Jewish worshipers since the massacre , angry Hebron settlers confronted soldiers after being barred from praying at the site , the army said . The site is revered by both Muslims and Jews . Police disarmed and detained five settlers , Israel Radio said . Troops wrote_down names of other settlers involved in the scuffle . The action against the settlers was unusual , particularly in light of past complaints by Palestinians that soldiers have ignored settler vigilantes . The PLO has demanded that Israel move the more_than 400 settlers out of Hebron to reduce friction . Rabin said Saturday they would stay_put for now but hinted he might act against the six Jewish enclaves in Hebron later . &quot; I don ' t think that at this stage we are intending , or at least I don ' t intend to move_out the Jews who live_in Hebron . All the rest is not something that should be said or discussed publicly , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
