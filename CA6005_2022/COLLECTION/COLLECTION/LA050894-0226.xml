   <HEADLINE> SMALL AD_AGENCIES REAP TWO OF THREE TOP AWARDS ; ADVERTISING : ONE-MAN ACME SHOP , TWO SMART GUY ' S ARE HONORED . DGWB , A LARGE FIRM , IS CITED FOR BEST POSTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In step with a national trend , small agencies walked away with two of three top honors during Saturday night ' s 36th annual Orange County AdClub awards ceremony . One of three &quot; Best of Show &quot; awards went_to Acme Advertising , a one-man operation run_by Sakol Mongkolkasetarin of Fountain Valley . He won in the print advertising category for his work for Pacific Snax Corp. , which makes rice snacks shaped like popcorn . The top honor in broadcast advertising was awarded to Smart Guy ' s Advertising Co . in Huntington Beach , a two-person agency . Tim O ' Donnell and Pat Zimmerman , the owners , won for ads they created for Hovik Jewelry in Santa Barbara . The top award for poster advertising went_to dGWB in Irvine , one of Orange County ' s largest independent agencies , for its work for Vans canvas shoes . For Mongkolkasetarin , 27 , the award caps a solo career that was forced on him after he had been laid_off by two now-defunct agencies . He started Acme in his parents ' living room , and in March , he won four Belding Bowls -- the West ' s most prestigious contest . dGWB hired him the same month . His success is part of a string of recent victories by smaller agencies that has bigger agencies talking_about how to return to their roots . Executives at the county ' s larger agencies , who meet frequently to discuss industry matters , talked privately Wednesday about the growing dominance of small agencies in awards ceremonies . Contests , to a great extent , measure the industry ' s most prized attribute -- creativity . The executives feared , in part , that big agencies and their clients have lost their nerve . &quot; In this economy , no one is taking chances , &quot; said Greg Smith , a consultant who attended Wednesday ' s meeting . The breakup and downsizing of so many large companies during the recession has put many talented people on the street to fend_for themselves . And technology has helped them do with computers in short fashion what artists and expensive typesetting equipment used to do . In the Orange County AdClub contest , the &quot; Best of Show &quot; awards are chosen from among gold medal award winners . In all , 26 gold medals were awarded , along with 56 silver medals and 118 merit awards . The number of entries declined from 951 last year to 653 , but the number of awards rose from 152 to 200 . About 500 people attended the show . Winning the highest number of awards was dGWB , with eight gold medals and 40 silver and merit awards . Lawrence &amp; Mayo in Newport Beach won 27 awards , including three gold . Acme Advertising won five gold and eight other awards , and Smart Guy ' s won eight awards , including two gold .
