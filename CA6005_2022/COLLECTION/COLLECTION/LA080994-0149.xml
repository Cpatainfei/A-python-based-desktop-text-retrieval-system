   <HEADLINE> CALM PREVAILS AS WEEK OF ABORTION PROTEST STARTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Abortion doctor Joseph Booker , wearing a military helmet and slumped in the back seat of a car , was greeted only by supporters Monday as he arrived_at a clinic targeted by abortion opponents . About 20 abortion rights backers and a number of police stood_watch as Booker ' s car , driven by officers , disappeared behind a six-foot fence that surrounds the Gulf Coast Women ' s Clinic . Signs posted near the clinic read : &quot; Abortion is America ' s holocaust , &quot; and &quot; It ' s not a choice , it ' s a life. &quot; But no abortion opponents were in_sight until about an hour later , when four sign-carrying demonstrators set_up on the street . Organizers of the &quot; No Place to Hide &quot; demonstrations planned throughout the week in Jackson and Gulfport said abortion opponents would attempt to talk with women visiting the clinic . Booker practices at clinics in both cities and is believed to be the only doctor in the state who performs abortions . &quot; We ' ve got a_couple_of dozen on their way down &quot; to Gulfport , said Roy McMillan , a Jackson anti-abortion activist who invited protesters to Mississippi . &quot; They will join a_couple_of dozen people already down there. &quot; McMillan and another organizer , Joseph Foreman of Missionaries to the Pre-born in Milwaukee , both acknowledged signing a petition that says it is justifiable to kill doctors who perform abortions . But both said this week ' s protests would be nonviolent . Foreman said he later withdrew his name from the document , which was circulated shortly after Dr. David Gunn was murdered outside a clinic in Pensacola , Fla. , in March , 1993 . It ' s the same petition signed by Paul J . Hill , a former minister charged with murdering Dr. John Bayard Britton and his escort outside another Pensacola clinic last month . The escort , James H . Barrett , was buried Monday with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia , on the eve of what would have been his 75th birthday . The Rev . Paul Johnson , a Unitarian Universalist minister and friend , said : &quot; I think_of Jim caring for and protecting others and speaking his mind freely and clearly . His final act was in the service of others . We have been enriched to have known him. &quot; Among the 100 mourners were others who escort abortion patients through protesters , along with Barrett ' s widow , who was with him when he was slain , two sons and daughter . Meanwhile , in Florida , priests were warned to be careful and dress inconspicuously after a caller threatened to kill 20 clergymen in retaliation for the slayings of Britton and Barrett . The anonymous caller contacted a Roman_Catholic_Church on Thursday in Miami , and the threat was passed to the FBI , police said . A church spokeswoman said it was hoped that the threat was a one-time crank_call .</TEXT>
