   <HEADLINE> SPOTLIGHT ; MEDIUM TO WELL DONE ; REPORTER ON PSYCHIC SHOPPING TRIP FINDS SOME QUALITY ADVICE IN SPIRITED PACKAGING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s best to shop for a new car during clearance time . Spring is the propitious season in which to plant a garden . And if you ' re thinking of looking_into unseen psychic forces , the time to do so evidently is now . Long before the invention of Milk Duds and Power Ranger costumes , Halloween was originally called Sambain ( pronounced sow-en ) after the Celtic god of death . Presaging the months of nature ' s decay and cold , ancient Celts , pagans and early Christians deemed Oct . 31 as a day when the departed drew_near , and a time ripe for seeking divinations of love , luck , money and other pending concerns . According to some today , Halloween remains the Blue Light Special of the cosmic plane K mart . &quot; Sambain is a significant day . The veils are said to be very thin between the spirit_world and the mortal world , so contacting departed souls , clairvoyance , any work with the other side would be considered very effective at this time , &quot; said Guy Richard , whose Costa Mesa shop Isle of Avalon is a magic-worker ' s supply house , stocking warlock robes , Dragon ' s Blood bath and shower gel and sundry items . According to Costa Mesa Tarot reader Lorene Judd , &quot; It ' s the day that the heavens open and you have the clearest access to all_the souls that aren ' t in-body any more . that ' s why people think_of ghosts and spooks and everything , because it ' s the day you can really connect and communicate with everybody that ' s out of body. &quot; So let ' s , shall we ? For those tired_of the usual theme park Halloween diversions , we decided to check_out some of the en-veiled alternatives . You need look no farther than the Yellow Pages to find -- listed between Sperm_Banks and Sporting Goods -- a Spiritual Consultants heading . Add the listings under Parapsychologists , Astrologers , Occult Supplies and Psychic Counseling and Healing , and you ' ve got more advice than a body can handle . A decade ago psychics weren ' t accorded much respect or profile in Orange County . The standard would be a palmist with a whitewashed house next to a railroad_track . One might still expect the business to be centered in immigrant neighborhoods with a strong folk tradition , and there is indeed no shortage of those , though many don ' t advertise in the phone_book . But the real psychic hub these days seems to be Newport Beach , with spokes radiating out_to Costa Mesa , Laguna and Irvine . Perhaps the Reagans ' reliance on an astrologer made_it acceptable in upscale communities . A cynic might suggest that psychics are going where the money is . Judd has a more interesting explanation . &quot; Money and power don ' t have anything to do with it . There ' s an energy vortex here . If you look_around you ' ll see a lot of health_food stores here , yoga centers , holistic health , acupuncture and acupressure massage . If you know about meridians or power spots like Sedona ( Arizona ) , you ' ll see there ' s a power spot in this area , and if you check_out the grid you ' ll see there ' s an energy vortex , and when you ' re in a power spot in a vortex , it ' s easier to access this type of information . We ' re talking fourth and fifth dimension . There ' s a doorway here , &quot; she said . It ' s a hard position to argue with given that , as we spoke , someone was banging on a shaman ' s drum outside the psychic reading_room we sat in , ensconced in Visions &amp; Dreams Emporium , a Costa Mesa New Age shop . There , one can find taped channeled communications broadcast from the Pleiades star cluster , Tarot cards and abalone shards . &quot; Abalone attracts angels , &quot; claims a placard . Judd was one of five randomly selected psychics I visited for readings last week . I don ' t recommend seeing five psychics in a row . My psyche feels rubbed to a nub . It was an interesting experience , though , both to contrast their various approaches and to note an impressive consistency between their collective readings . Before you take this as a confirmation of things arcane , bear_in_mind that I am predisposed to believe_in psychic occurrences , and have been ever since a high_school friend and I were once standing beside a river and , for no reason on God ' s green Earth , simultaneously thought_of Sebastian Cabot . I don ' t question that there are connections in this world that aren ' t readily apparent , though -- as might be expected of one whose psychic experiences revolve_around large , dead , bearded TV actors -- I don ' t regard them as taking precedence over the engagements and wonders of daily life . I didn ' t tell a_couple_of the psychics beforehand that I was a reporter , but I also didn ' t try to catch them up in trick questions or misleading information . Rather , I asked about things that honestly concern me , and those didn ' t happen to be the sort of concrete names-dates-places answers that would prove or disprove the accuracy of their skills . As with any profession , there are doubtless hack psychics , though the ones I met seemed earnest in their work . Whether they are connected to another plane of being or not , to varying degrees I walked away from each reader with a respect for her intuition and advice . All I ' ll venture is that if you have a curiosity about things psychic , and the money to spend , getting a reading is a lot more fun than a session with an investment broker . Unless you ' re the sort that enjoys pulling beards off Santas , I don ' t recommend going_to psychics with the intent of proving them wrong . You likely won ' t get a good reading , they ' ll probably have ready reasons -- such_as your bad faith -- why the reading wasn ' t good , you ' ll be out a chunk of money , and if their powers are real , who needs a psychic honked off at you ? * If you had a choice , would n ' t the first psychic you visited be named Yolanda ? We thought so too , and so started our mystical journey in Anaheim with Yolanda Todorovich , a woman of Yugo-Serbian extraction who says her family has been doing readings in Orange County for three decades . She works with your choice of either Tarot cards or palms , and her reading came_closest to one ' s expectations of the classic Gypsy palm reader . Her place_of_business has burgundy carpeting , pink walls , a small furry dog with a face like Ernest Hemingway , religious icons , and a sign reading , &quot; If you have a cold or flu please let me know right away. &quot; &quot; that ' s something we can ' t protect against , &quot; she revealed , sniffling . Todorovich asked a_few questions , the first being &quot; How will you be paying_for this ? &quot; ( Like many readers , she takes plastic. ) Most of the time , she gave answers . Her observations were emphatic , dramatic -- colored with a revelatory or cautionary tone -- and she often dealt in specifics . If in the next three weeks I have a mishap swimming , an accident with a red car or a knee injury , we ' ll let you know . She also revealed that in past lives I ' ve been a Chinese philosopher and an African witch_doctor . She said things about my pathetic love life that seemed pretty spot-on . On the career front , she , as all four psychics after her were to do , strongly suggested I leave my work and embark_on a project on my own . There ' s nothing like using your employer ' s expense money to be told you should be ditching them ! Of the readers visited , Yolanda got top points for style of delivery : &quot; I ' ve got_to tell you something , mister . You ' re going_away . You ' re going a distance . You ' re going to cross deep waters to a foreign country that ' s going_to be ruled by a king or queen . And through this journey is where you ' re going to find your success . And , Jim , what ' s this thing with the desert ? &quot; Well , the desert part could well be the planned trip I took_to the California desert odd-spot , Slab City , a_few days later . The distance could be a junket to royalty-ruled Thailand I ' ve been trying to scam . Go figure . * Next stop was the Learning Light Foundation in Anaheim . The foundation -- the name was changed from the Psynetics Metaphysical Center early this year to avoid confusion with Dianetics -- has been in Orange County for 32 years , more_than 20 of those in an old church on East Lincoln Ave . &quot; Our mission statement is to promote education and research relative to the physical , mental and spiritual well-being of the individual , &quot; says Douglas Baucom , who co-helms the foundation with his wife , Susan . To that end they offer a wildly non-judgmental variety of services , spoon-bending parties , classes in Angel Awareness , a UFO Abductee Support Group and so on . Baucom doesn ' t believe there ' s more parapsychological activity around Halloween , &quot; But I think there ' s an increase in our awareness of it , &quot; he said . The foundation is hosting a Halloween party with psychics on Saturday . Psychics are typically there for walk-in business on Saturdays -- designated Psychic Day -- and by appointment on other days . Two alternative churches meet in the main hall on Sundays . But on a recent weekday , the church stage was the quiet spot used for my reading . The woman conducting it ( uninterested in publicity , she asked us not to use her name ) uses psychometry : She holds an object usually on your person -- car keys , in my case -- and senses things from it . Particularly compared to the effusive Todorovich , her speech was tranquil and unaffected , and her answers dealt more in tendencies and waves than in specifics . She too saw me making a long-distance trip . &quot; I saw the letter T , and the first country I thought_of was a distance like Tahiti , &quot; she said , which is close enough to Thailand for me . She also saw me making driving trips to Washington State , which I do often enough , and she made a solid hit on my food allergies . Though she was one of the psychics I didn ' t tell of my profession until later , she said , &quot; I see paper and I see ink. &quot; She also saw me moving to the Southeast , which I have no intention of doing , though I ' d like to chalk that up_to my car key coming from Tennessee . Though it ' s not the sort of stuff that lends itself to quantification , I was most impressed by her perception of my cluttered mental_state , and the solid advice doled_out on that account . * Melissa Scott ' s office is a far_cry from the New Age vibe of the Learning Light Foundation . She works_out of a very businesslike Costa Mesa office , and she typically works in a stylish business outfit . There ' s nothing like a Formica table top to make a crystal ball and set of Tarot cards look even more arcane . Scott , 30 , says she has been psychic since childhood and a professional for 10 years . Many of her clients are professionals as well ; they come_to her to help form business plans . Not surprisingly , there isn ' t much mumbo or jumbo to her delivery . She says she ' s usually right , but adds that no one should ever cede his or her own decision-making process to a psychic ' s visions . &quot; This is about observation and information , and I believe you have to take everything with a grain of salt , &quot; she said . &quot; I never say , ' You absolutely should do this , ' because you have to use your own judgment and make those decisions. &quot; Along with advising me to make a career jump , she added further impetus : &quot; I see someone new you ' ll be working with , a dark-haired individual that ' s in_charge . This person seems to have a very intimidating , controlling personality . I would caution against being involved with this person. &quot; A question often asked by cynics is : With such ready advice for others , why aren ' t all psychics rich ? Scott ' s answer : &quot; I ask myself that constantly . There are people in this business who are making a lot of money with the 900 numbers and things like that . But I always think , ' Why don ' t I know the lottery numbers ? ' I don ' t know why I don ' t . But I think we always receive the information that is the highest good for us at that time . There are certain other things you ' re not to know until it ' s their time. &quot; * In a field that already is subject_to much ridicule , it takes a certain amount of spunk to call your organization the Morontia Society . On this mortal coil , the society ' s sole representative is Bonita Kent . Morontia , she says , is the highest plane of being accessible to us , and the society she communes with there comprises angels and enlightened beings . Kent is a sunny blonde who does her readings in the Laura Ashley-like environment of a typical Irvine condo . She says she connects through automatic writing , with her writing hand directed by departed souls , the Archangel Michael and a guide she calls Morontia Spirit Woman . It ' s an interesting show . The messages Kent delivered , at least at my present Karmic level , often seemed like gobbledygook to me . Despite that , this was the one reading during which the hairs on the back of my head were doing pushups . Kent doesn ' t go_into a trance and isn ' t given to theatrics . Her speech remains conversational , people walk their beagles outside , and the only unusual sound is her pen forming loopy letters dictated from beyond . Yet it was decidedly eerie , even if the information coming_in wasn ' t connecting . I ' m not much on contacting departed spirits . I don ' t know many dead people and figure they probably have better things to do . And the famous dead ? Where ' s the decency in pulling Jimi Hendrix back from his enlightened plane just to ask him what gauge strings he used ? Perhaps one of the problems with the reading was that Kent started receiving messages from my departed maternal grandmother . She was a sweet woman , but a dithering one , about as comprehensible as a Wookie in this life , and evidently not much more lucid in the next . Between Grandma , Morontia Spirit Woman and the Archangel Michael , I was given a load of oddly phrased advice that was sufficiently sound and generic that it shouldn ' t do anyone harm , but it also didn ' t seem to have much to do with me . My hairs enjoyed it though , as if they were getting an electric_charge from beyond . Others are more satisfied with the contacts . Like Scott , Kent said that several of her clients consult with the beyond on business matters . The head of one family-held company , she said , &quot; comes_in every two weeks and consults with her departed brother . It ' s like a board_meeting that he governs , and it ' s been totally on-target , developing the business plan and new divisions. &quot; * The readings Lorene Judd and others conduct at Costa Mesa ' s Visions &amp; Dreams take_place in a carpeted room , where no electricity invades . The room is lit by candles , and a wind-up clock ticks_off the minutes like a psychic cab meter . Visions here are purchased at $ 1 a minute . Judd -- who also teaches yoga -- works with Tarot cards . Like Scott , she says the spirits are selective in what they allow to be revealed . &quot; Readings sometimes are absolutely right on and the cards really talk . But sometimes it won ' t come_through , if it ' s better for you to find it out on_your_own ; or maybe what you have to learn is about some type of illusion and the illusion can ' t be lifted until you find your way through it or it would n ' t be fun for you . So it all depends. &quot; Her reading for me touched_on the same themes most of the others had . There were sprinklings of hard information , as when Scott had pegged my desires to move to northern California or Washington . But the intriguing part wasn ' t the revelatory stuff , it was the quality of the advice they gave , which in several cases I ' d rate up there with the sort I get from longtime friends . Is there magic involved , or empathy and shrewd guesswork ? I don ' t know , but it ' s a good show . And who would n ' t want to have a mysterious stranger tell them , &quot; I see you ' ve done a lot of soul searching lately ? &quot; It sounds a lot cooler than &quot; I see you watch lots of TV. &quot; Getting Psyched * Yolanda Todorovich does her readings at 216 N .
