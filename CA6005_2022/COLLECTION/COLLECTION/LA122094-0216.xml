   <HEADLINE> LAGUNA THEATER GETS $ 150 # 000 GRANT PLEDGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Laguna Playhouse received a $ 150 # 000 matching grant Monday from the James Irvine Foundation to help equip a planned second venue in South Laguna . The grant , requiring a dollar-for-dollar match from other funds to be raised by the playhouse , will go toward stage lighting and sound equipment for a 225-seat theater in a former Bank of America branch building on Coast Highway . The playhouse bought the property for $ 880 # 000 in February and in May received City_Council approval to use the building as a theater . Architectural plans will go before the city ' s design review board Thursday for final approval . The cost of converting the building is expected to run between $ 500 # 000 and $ 1 million , according to playhouse executive_director Richard Stein . &quot; We still don ' t have a hard figure , &quot; Stein said . &quot; But we ' ve selected Shea Business Properties to do the renovation work , and they ' ll be coming_up with one soon . I hope by July we will be in the throes of construction . It ' s our understanding that once the remodeling begins , it shouldn ' t take longer than six months to accomplish. &quot; The architectural_plans have been drawn_up by John von Szeliski and Associates , a Newport Beach firm that specializes in theater design . Szeliski helped create the design for the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa . Shea , based in Walnut , is a major building contractor for residential and commercial property development . The playhouse has completed the first phase_in a capital campaign to finance the building conversion . &quot; We ' ve successfully solicited all_the members of our board of directors , &quot; Stein said . &quot; I ' m not at_liberty to divulge how much they gave , but it was substantial. &quot; In the second phase , the company will apply for grants from corporations and private_foundations . The last phase will target individual contributors from the public through telephone solicitations , benefit performances and other marketing efforts . &quot; The board has decided it wants all_the funds pledged before we start construction , &quot; Stein said . &quot; We still have a ways to go. &quot; * Founded in 1920 , the playhouse is the county ' s oldest theater_company . It also is the largest community theater , with 8 # 000 subscribers , and one of the largest in that category nationwide . This year the nonprofit company has an annual budget of $ 1.4 million , which underwrites its five-play season at the 419-seat Moulton Theater and a youth troupe . The Moulton , built_in 1968 , will continue as the playhouse ' s major venue for revivals and musicals . These are largely cast with paid amateur actors . A limited number of union professionals represented by the Actors ' Equity Assn . are allowed to appear under an Equity guest contract . The second theater would enable the playhouse to expand its offerings to new or current plays . It would be operated under an Equity agreement requiring a specific number of union actors per season ( to be negotiated ) and union stage_managers for all productions .</TEXT>
