   <TEXT> &quot; Apartheid crushes you , it squeezes the life out of you , it leaves you broken before the end of your years , &quot; Shirley Mofokeng said with a sigh that shook her whole body . &quot; Simply to live under apartheid has been a day-by-day , even hour-by-hour , struggle for us all. &quot; A hush quickly fell_over the Mofokengs ' small living_room in Soweto , the huge black city outside Johannesburg , for Shirley Mofokeng was talking_about the death of her husband , Abner , six years ago at the age of 51 from what she simply called &quot; a weakened heart. &quot; &quot; Apartheid killed my father , &quot; her son , Tebogo Mofokeng , 28 , a high_school science_teacher , agreed . &quot; He wasn ' t shot down in the street as so many were , he wasn ' t starved to death in one of those ( rural , tribal ) homelands , but he was worked to death and worried to death and hated to death by this system. &quot; For South_Africa ' s black majority , apartheid meant much more_than racial separation , more even than the entrenchment of minority white rule over the country and its economy . Since its imposition by the Afrikaner-led National Party in 1948 , apartheid systematically stripped millions of people of their human dignity , treating them as cheap labor and banishing them from wherever they were not needed . Every South_African black has an experience with apartheid horrors -- being driven from home , deprived of an education , humiliated by segregationist rules and discriminated against at every turn , jailed for trying to find a better-paying city job , burying a child killed by police -- but for most , the daily dehumanization exacted the highest toll . &quot; Apartheid was felt every day , &quot; Tebogo Mofokeng said . &quot; It tore at us emotionally , psychologically and physically . A mother goes_to work and comes_home angry after being pushed_around by whites all day . Her children feel that anger . A father is worked to death in the only job the regime will let him have , and his family is left to cope however it can . Children are dumped out of school uneducated and stupid . . . . &quot; The traumas from which most societies , including white South_Africa , try to protect its members , &quot; he added , &quot; apartheid methodically , even deliberately , inflicted upon us. &quot; The Mofokengs ' struggle to survive as a family is the story of South_Africa ' s 35.8 million blacks , mixed-race Coloreds and Asians whose rights and very humanity apartheid had denied . That struggle , multiplied across a rich and varied land and intensified from one generation to the next , finally brought an end to what the oppressed had damned as &quot; The System &quot; -- the almost absolute control that the 5.2 million whites , particularly the politically dominant Afrikaners , had built over the centuries . Sitting in the front_room of their matchbox house in Soweto ' s Meadowlands neighborhood , their home for nearly 20 years , the Mofokengs -- Shirley , Tebogo , Audrey , Nathaniel and Patience -- were equally philosophical and political as they discussed the end of apartheid and more humorous than bitter as they recalled their own experiences . &quot; We had two toilets where I was working -- one for the white baas , the other for the black workers , &quot; Shirley Mofokeng said , recalling her years as a seamstress and shop_steward in clothing factories . &quot; With so many of us on the shop_floor , this was a problem , and so one day I said , ' You know , you won ' t get painted black sitting where I sat. ' He got the point . . . . &quot; People with power don ' t want to share -- maybe that ' s a rule of life for some -- and these whites , particularly the Afrikaners , were quite happy dictating to the rest of us . ' Live here , work there , do this , don ' t do that. ' Well , it didn ' t last , and it couldn ' t last. &quot; After the death of her husband , a supervisor at the bus_company that ferried black workers back and forth to their jobs in Johannesburg , Shirley Mofokeng , 51 , struggled to keep her children in school , working long hours as a seamstress at clothing factories before becoming a factory supervisor . &quot; As the second-eldest of seven children , I had to drop_out ( in the 10th grade ) to help_out my parents , but I didn ' t want that to happen to my children , &quot; she said . &quot; With just one salary , it was very tough . I was lucky that I had kids who understood that dinner some nights would be just tea and bread without butter . &quot; You get paid on Friday , and after the rent , the electricity , medicine , school fees , the phone and clothes , you ' re lucky if there ' s enough money for food . These kids know what it ' s like not just to go_to_bed hungry but go_off to school hungry too. &quot; Tebogo recalls doing his homework by candlelight when there was no electricity at_home , bundling against the cold winter winds when broken windows were not replaced in his classroom and organizing study groups in his senior year of high_school when there were no science_teachers . &quot; I wanted to become a doctor , and I had the marks , &quot; he said . &quot; But all_the quotas were_full . ' No , boy , we have enough black doctors , ' they said , and that was that . So I became a teacher , though I have not lost my ambition to become a doctor. &quot; * Pushing her children all_the way was Shirley Mofokeng , who retains the energy and zest that made her a regional tennis champion in her youth . &quot; The schools might have been closed , but my kids still studied , &quot; she recalled . &quot; I drew_up a plan , and every day they would bring their notebooks to show me what they did that day . And , just like I learned in management courses , I followed up . Oh , I was strict , but I didn ' t want them to stop where I had to. &quot; Tebogo , who was christened Churchill but now uses his African name , finished his science degree at the University of the North , a college for blacks at Turfloop , and teaches science , mathematics and English in Soweto , giving students extra classes for additional income . Patience Mofokeng , 30 , the eldest of the four Mofokeng children , became an organizer for a retail clerks union and lives in the heavily industrialized East Rand outside Johannesburg . Audrey , 21 , is preparing to enroll in a marketing course later this year at a technical college . Nathaniel , 17 , the youngest , is in high_school with ambitions for university , though civil unrest and repeated school closures have cost him a_couple_of years . And there are now three grandchildren on whom Shirley Mofokeng dotes . &quot; Our mother is a real ' township mama , ' and these township mamas are tough , tough , tough , &quot; Audrey said , gently teasing her mother . &quot; They are what hold our families together and what hold our communities together . . . . The real resistance to apartheid , I think , came from families , even before it came from organizations like the African National Congress. &quot; Shirley Mofokeng agreed . &quot; The struggle against apartheid began with the struggle to live , &quot; she said . &quot; At work , I ' d see the white baas sitting in his office all day , doing little but drinking coffee , working short hours and getting a nice salary while we worked hard down on the factory floor . You ask yourself why , and the answer is that he is a white_man . &quot; And then there were the things outside work . The nastiness at the ( white-owned ) cafes , the insults from officials and policemen that make you sick , the worry about your kids , the I-don ' t-care attitude of doctors when your husband is dying , the terrible lack of basic services in Soweto. &quot; A trade_union shop_steward for 10 years , Shirley Mofokeng became active in community affairs in recent years . She works in the Soweto Civic Assn. ' s housing and health_care committees and , as its education officer in Meadowlands , organizing seminars to explain the political changes . &quot; Every night , it ' s a meeting , &quot; she said . &quot; But I had to get involved for the simple reason that I don ' t keep quiet if there is something that is not right . That is the only way we are going_to fix things . &quot; We are talking now to these guys who have been running things in Soweto their way for years , and they are hearing about what they have been doing to us . They are afraid , I tell you they are afraid , but fortunate for them we are not vengeful. &quot; Even as it disappears , however , apartheid leaves a legacy certain to mark South_Africans for many years , Tebogo said , explaining how he was sending his son , Setjhaba , 4 , to a racially integrated nursery_school to prepare him for the &quot; new South Africa. &quot; &quot; Although black people are becoming aware of themselves as human_beings , it will take time to change our psychology and even longer to change that of the whites , &quot; he said . &quot; We had this system for years , and it will take years to get_rid_of it . Even now when I see a white , I see someone who is thinking how stupid I am , how insignificant I am . This affects me . But our children will be different , and their children will be truly free. &quot; * There is probably no greater indictment of apartheid and its preservation of power and privileges for whites -- and no clearer explanation of the decades of tough black resistance -- than what it did , routinely and brutally , to black families , ordinary black families such_as the Mofokengs . White prosperity and well-being were ensured through black poverty and deprivation . Different from the segregation and discrimination suffered by U.S. blacks , apartheid was intended to enhance the political and economic power of South_Africa ' s white minority , particularly the 3 million Afrikaners , whose Dutch , German and French Huguenot forebears first settled here in the 17th Century , and its instruments were totalitarian rule and open oppression . Today , two-thirds of the country ' s blacks continue to survive on less than what government and independent economists consider a basic subsistence income , and more_than a quarter of them are &quot; completely destitute. &quot; The average white family has an income six times that of an African family ; despite widespread unionization in industry , whites still earn about 3.6 times what blacks do on factory floors . Decades-old policies , moreover , promoted structural unemployment to ensure large pools of cheap black labor . Out of a total labor_pool of 14 million , South_Africa has about 5.4 million unemployed -- the vast majority of them blacks . Only 3 % to 4 % of new job seekers find employment , according to labor economists , and the number of those without work grows at more_than 400 # 000 a year . Generations of black youth were deprived of an adequate education . Of the 2 % of African students who finish all 12 years of schooling today , only 41 % pass their matriculation exams , compared to 96 % of whites . Student-teacher ratios at African schools remain more_than 40 to 1 , compared to 16 to 1 at the previously whites-only schools ; white teachers , moreover , are_better qualified than those in black schools , most of whom emerged from the same educational system and lack university degrees and professional training . * Although virtually any measure illustrates the advantages enjoyed by whites through their determined hold_on political and economic power , comparative statistics on health are particularly telling . Whites have a life_expectancy of 73 years , blacks 61 -- and in rural_areas 48 . Black_African infant_mortality , another key health indicator , is 65 per 1 # 000 live_births , more_than seven times that among white babies . Tuberculosis , a disease typical among the impoverished , has risen 41 % in the last five years among blacks . Overall , the TB rate is one of the highest in Africa . For years , the government spent four or five times as much on health_care for whites as for blacks so that , before the hospitals were desegregated two years ago , there were four hospital_beds for every 1 # 000 blacks , most of them at 110 % occupancy , while for whites there were more_than eight beds per 1 # 000 , with occupancy little more_than 50 % . Despite the country ' s political transformation , little has changed since the Second Carnegie Inquiry into Poverty and Development in Southern Africa wrote in a landmark study in 1989 : &quot; Thousands of South_African babies are dying of malnutrition and associated diseases . Two million children are growing_up stunted for lack of sufficient calories in one of the few countries in the world that exports food . Tens of thousands of men are spending their entire working years as ' labor units ' in single-sex hostels whilst their wives and children live generally in great poverty in the overcrowded ( rural , tribal ) reserves. &quot; Amid the grinding daily tragedy of apartheid there was also the absurdity of social engineering gone mad as the government tried to divide the black population into 10 separate African_nations , of which the 8.5 million Zulus were the largest ; seven classifications of mixed-race Coloreds , ranging from &quot; Cape Malay &quot; to &quot; Colored-other , &quot; and Asians descended from immigrant Indian workers . * Manu Desai , wanting to escape the rigid racial_segregation of Durban , moved about 25 years ago to Cape_Town , a city where different races had historically mixed more easily and where authorities were more relaxed in enforcing the rules of apartheid . &quot; That made me a criminal , &quot; Desai said , recalling old laws prohibiting Indians from leaving Natal province . &quot; There was nothing for me in Durban ; I wanted to start a business but I couldn ' t . The government barred Indians from most fields , and whites had monopolies we couldn ' t challenge . &quot; It was not that we couldn ' t better ourselves , but that we were not allowed to . Only 200 Indians were accepted a year for ( high_school graduation ) at that time , and if you didn ' t make_it , then your life was_on the factory floor or behind the shop counter . . . . &quot; We were all locked_in our own ' population groups , ' and breaking free was very difficult . Indians lived with Indians , whites with whites , Coloreds with Coloreds , Africans with Africans . We went_to different schools , we played_on different sports fields , we shopped in different stores , we traveled in different buses , we ate_in different restaurants . In my father ' s day , it was even worse ; he could not walk on the pavement if a white was there. &quot; Desai , who is 54 , established a small printing_business in the Woodstock area of Cape_Town , and today , working from two shops across the road from one another , he prints everything from guarantee cards for electronics products to posters for boxing matches to educational materials on AIDS . &quot; Some weeks , we are here every day , and some days we work 16 or 18 hours , &quot; he said as he checked the quality of some freshly printed election flyers . &quot; I can ' t say that business is bad -- we ' re doing quite OK. &quot; * Desai ' s escape_from apartheid , however , was only partial . He married a woman , Minnie , now his wife of 21 years , who was classified as a &quot; Cape Colored , &quot; a person of mixed race by government definition . And that trapped them in a maze of apartheid regulations that , while repealed , still bind them in strange ways . Desai quickly found that he and his wife had to live_in an area designated for Indians , although housing there was scarce and expensive and they preferred to live_in a Colored area because of better amenities . So they divorced -- on paper . &quot; As an Indian , I couldn ' t own a house in a Colored area , and as a married_woman , Minnie couldn ' t own a house anywhere , &quot; Desai said . &quot; Technically , legally , we had to divorce in_order to live together where we wanted . &quot; I dropped Minnie off at the lawyer ' s office one day to do the divorce , I called_on a_couple_of customers and I picked her up half an hour later . I considered that we had bought a piece_of_paper called a ' divorce decree , ' and that was all . Minnie bought the house , I became her ' lodger , ' and we carried_on with our lives. &quot; The Desais , who now have three daughters -- Leila and Pravina , 19 , twins who are studying business administration , and Sarita , 6 -- continued to exploit the loopholes of apartheid as the system sagged under the absurdity of its own regulations . Four years ago , when the Desais wanted to move to East Rondebosch , a suburb of middle-class whites north of Cape_Town , they formed a company with a white friend as the nominal owner that then bought the comfortable , three-bedroom house and &quot; assigned &quot; Manu and Minnie Desai to reside there as company employees . * East Rondebosch is now fully integrated , and Minnie Desai describes most of her neighbors as &quot; warm and welcoming , very kind people , not at all racist. &quot; &quot; Because we make a decent living , we could find ways around many apartheid regulations , but it cost us thousands , &quot; Manu Desai said . Although a businessman more focused on profits than politics , he became caught_up in the popular struggle against apartheid in the 1980s . &quot; We didn ' t carry guns , but we helped force this change , &quot; he said . &quot; The business_community gave financial_support , and I printed a lot of stuff the regime could have hanged me for . Whew , some of the manifestos were so hot that just holding them burned my hands ! &quot; There were raids one after another in those days , and often we printed through the night while the police slept . Thank God , I wasn ' t caught -- it would have been the end of the business , the end for my family , maybe even the end of my life. &quot; Sobered by that recollection , Desai continued : &quot; Under apartheid , there were no two kinds of black . Black was black , and we all suffered terrible injustices . . . . Still , one must ask , ' What about those who could not buy their way_out of petty apartheid -- not that we really succeeded -- for they numbered in the tens of millions ? ' &quot; For me , there is another question : What about the waste all this entailed ? Sixty percent of government funds have been wasted on apartheid over the past 45 years , on checking to see who was marrying whom and preserving the racial purity of the Afrikaner people , on putting everyone else in tight little cages and on building_up the military and the security apparatus to protect a system of privileges for the whites . &quot; What waste , what waste ! &quot; Desai exclaimed , shaking his head as much over the folly of apartheid as the pain it inflicted . &quot; Soon we will be out of this mess , I hope. &quot; Desai , whose heavy eyelids hide a very quick mind , counts himself among the country ' s optimists , believing that opening the economy fully to blacks , the massive development program planned by the ANC and further measures , such_as the distribution of unfarmed land , will create the jobs that will in turn bring social stability . &quot; When a family has a roof over its head and food on the table , its whole perspective changes , &quot; he said . &quot; The other element is schooling . From one generation to the next , it will be education that improves the quality_of_life . Look , I have enough work to take_on several more people , but there aren ' t qualified guys because many apprenticeships were closed to blacks. &quot; * The Desais ' two elder daughters , Leila and Pravina , virtually luxuriate in the challenge of their business administration courses at the University of the Western Cape , ignoring the campus ' s intense leftist politics to concentrate_on their studies . &quot; Five years ago , everything was politics , and the politics were radical , &quot; Leila Desai said . &quot; Today , there are many of us who go_to school to learn and learn all we can ; the struggle has basically been won , and it is up_to us to take full advantage of the opportunities we have as a result of that struggle. &quot;</TEXT>
