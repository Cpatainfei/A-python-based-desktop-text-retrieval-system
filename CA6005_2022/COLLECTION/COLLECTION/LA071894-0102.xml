   <HEADLINE> THEFT CASE AT CENTER OF ' 3 STRIKES ' CONTROVERSY ; COURTS : PROSECUTORS SAY LAW WILL KEEP REPEAT OFFENDER OFF STREETS . DEFENSE ARGUES THAT LIFE TERM IS TOO SEVERE FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Roosevelt C . McCowan tried to swipe 18 bottles of drugstore cologne -- and could wind_up spending the rest of his life in prison . On March 8 , McCowan entered a Sav-On store in Oxnard , picked_up a backpack and loaded it with the fragrance bottles bearing labels from Pierre Cardin to Chaps . Stopped by security before he got_out the door , McCowan later pleaded guilty to petty theft and expected a short prison_term . Then prosecutors discovered something McCowan did not want them to see : his rap sheet . McCowan had more_than half_a_dozen felony convictions , ranging from residential burglary to robbery and assault with intent to commit murder . McCowan , 52 , eventually took_back his plea , after prosecutors decided to employ California ' s new &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; law against him . Now , in a trial set to begin today , the accused cologne thief faces 25 years to life in prison . The case is an example of the new three-strikes measure at its best , prosecutors say . The law was designed to rid the streets of habitual offenders such_as McCowan , who has a 32-year criminal_record , they say . &quot; This is the case where you look_at it and say , ' Man , this is a good law , ' &quot; said Ventura County Deputy Dist . Atty . Brian S . Rafelson , who uncovered McCowan ' s criminal past while digging through decades-old court files . But defense_attorneys say McCowan ' s case exposes the cruel and unusually punitive nature of the three-strikes measure , adopted last March one day before McCowan was stopped by security officers at Sav-On . &quot; He ' s charged with what is essentially a petty theft , &quot; said McCowan ' s lawyer , Deputy Public_Defender Douglas W . Daily . &quot; He didn ' t even make off with anybody ' s property . In spite of his criminal background , I don ' t think anybody , even if they were guilty of that activity , should be subjected_to that sort of penalty. &quot; McCowan is not the only defendant facing 25 years to life in prison for a nonviolent third felony . In courts across California , a wave of defendants accused of petty theft , drug offenses and other nonviolent crimes are facing prosecution under the three-strikes law , authorities say . Take San Diego County , where 141 three-strikes cases have been filed . There , three out of every four defendants charged under the law are accused of nonviolent crimes , said Deputy Dist . Atty . Charles Nickel . &quot; The substantial majority are non-serious felonies , &quot; he added . Gov . Pete Wilson signed the three-strikes bill after repeat offenders were charged in connection with several sensational crimes , most notably the kidnap-slaying of 12-year-old Polly Klaas of Petaluma . But even most crime fighters urged legislators to pass a bill that excluded nonviolent crimes . &quot; It was pretty overwhelming that the district_attorneys believed a narrower approach was the more proper one , &quot; Nickel said . &quot; We thought the law cast too wide a net . But we lost , and D.A.s are not in a position to pick and choose the law we want. &quot; The new law requires a sentence of 25 years to life in prison for any felon who has committed two prior violent or serious felonies , crimes that range from burglary and arson to rape and murder . In Ventura County , five defendants have been charged under three strikes , including two for nonviolent third offenses , said Deputy Dist . Atty . Patricia J . Kelliher , a felony division supervisor . But prosecutors have not applied the law consistently , critics say . For example , Ventura County prosecutors refused to file a three-strikes allegation against a two-time robber who admitted cultivating seven marijuana plants -- a felony . But a spokesman says there were technical problems with the marijuana-cultivation case that precluded prosecution under three strikes . A stocky man with a goatee and shaved head , McCowan believes authorities are making an example of him . &quot; I didn ' t have no idea they would try to make a misdemeanor into something like this , &quot; he lamented during a jailhouse interview . &quot; They ' re talking_about 25 to life . Murder is only 26 to life , and second-degree murder is only 15 to life. &quot; McCowan said he believes the charge against him is unfair . For instance , his cellmate was convicted of four counts of petty theft -- the same crime for which McCowan is charged . That inmate received 130 days in jail , McCowan said , shaking his head in disbelief . McCowan admitted , however , that he is no stranger to the criminal-justice system . Since 1964 , he has been charged in 26 criminal cases and sentenced to 37 years of state_prison time on various convictions . In that 30-year period , he has spent only about five years outside prison walls . McCowan ' s supporters trace his criminal activity to his tough childhood . Born April 21 , 1942 , in the small Texas town of Brenham , near Houston , McCowan was raised by his grandmother , who was single . His mother , an unwed 15-year-old , died while giving_birth to him , he said . He did not meet his father until age 16 . That was when his grandmother could no longer control him and sent him to Oakland to live with the man , Edwin Porter . Yet by that time , McCowan said , he was too undisciplined even for Porter ' s strict parenting . By 1959 , McCowan was living_in Oxnard with a maternal aunt . Here , he fathered four children -- but two died -- and married a woman who had a child of_her_own . He said he turned_to selling drugs to supplement his laborer ' s wages and support his family . He also began using drugs and getting_into trouble with the law . &quot; All my crimes are drug-related , &quot; McCowan said . &quot; When I ' m not on drugs , I ' m scared to do a crime. &quot; In 1964 , when he was 21 , McCowan was sentenced to state_prison for the first time for selling $ 25 worth of heroin to a plainclothes police_officer . He was released within a year , but was sent_back for five more years after being accused of kidnaping and raping a Santa Barbara woman . He was never convicted in that case , but his parole was revoked nonetheless . Paroled for a second time in 1970 , he landed back in the penitentiary two years later for assault with intent to commit murder . In that case , he clubbed a man with a stick after a card_game , according to court records . McCowan says the man was high on drugs and hit him first . &quot; That was a self-defense case , &quot; he said . McCowan believes that case marked him for a career behind bars . It was prosecuted by a young , ambitious deputy prosecutor named Michael D . Bradbury . Bradbury is now Ventura County ' s top prosecutor , who McCowan claims has held a grudge since they first faced_off in court . Bradbury lets_out a hearty laugh when told of McCowan ' s claims . &quot; He probably feels we are out_to get him , and we are . He ' s a dangerous criminal , &quot; said Bradbury , who promised to &quot; chase him right back to Folsom &quot; prison . After being paroled again in 1977 , McCowan was sent_back to prison within months , after his fingerprint was found in an apartment that had been burglarized . Prosecutors are using that crime as his first strike . McCowan spent the next 10 years in and out of prison -- mostly in -- until securing his release in 1987 . Within months , he reverted back to his old habits . That October , he and an accomplice burst into an Oxnard motel_room and robbed an oil-field worker at knifepoint , court records show . The robbery_conviction -- which represented strike 2 -- kept him off the streets for six more years , until last October . This time_out , McCowan vowed to change his ways and took steps to do that . He re-established contact with his children -- including son Lonnie McCowan , senior pastor at the Solid Rock Christian Center in Ventura . He started attending the church , and even lectured youth members on the pitfalls of drugs and crime . &quot; They had a lot of questions for him , &quot; recalled Lonnie McCowan , 35 . &quot; For some of them -- I guess you call them ( gang ) wanna-bes -- it was a real eye-opener . He hit them with straight talk . It was good for them to get a taste of reality. &quot; When one young tough seemed indifferent to the scare stories of the older_man , McCowan described a prison rape for him . The boy changed his attitude . Lonnie McCowan enjoyed having his father around . &quot; It was different because I didn ' t know what it felt_like to have a father , &quot; he said . &quot; What I found real interesting was , I would look_at him and I could see me in him . I think boys miss something when they don ' t see that in another man . There ' s some type of legacy you see there . &quot; I asked him , ' Are you going_back ? ' And he said , ' Son , this is it . I ' m never going_back again . If I go_back , I ' d probably never make_it out alive. ' &quot; The three-strikes law went_into effect at 2:45 p.m. March 7 , when Wilson signed the bill and promised to turn &quot; career criminals into career inmates. &quot; Roosevelt McCowan did not hear Wilson ' s speech , nor did he know the three-strikes law had taken_effect . He knew such legislation was in the works , but believed that it applied only to those with three prior violent or serious offenses . McCowan wasn ' t paying much attention to the news . He had gone_back to using drugs . But this time it was crack cocaine and not his old standby -- heroin . &quot; I smoked crack , and found_out it was worse than heroin , &quot; he said . On Tuesday , March 8 , McCowan was high on crack when he stepped off a city bus and walked into the Sav-On drugstore on Ventura Road in Oxnard , court records show . He picked_up a backpack and headed for the cosmetics area , loading 18 bottles of cologne valued at $ 340 into the bag , according to records . Before he could get_out the door , however , McCowan was stopped by a security_guard and an off-duty police_officer . His rights were read to him . But instead of being arrested , he was handed a citation and told to appear in court -- a sign he took_to mean that he was not in serious trouble . Six weeks later , he pleaded guilty to petty theft in Ventura County Superior_Court . As part of his plea , McCowan admitted that he had been convicted of petty theft twice before -- which made his latest crime a felony . Prosecutors did not know about his prior felony convictions at the time , and McCowan was not about to tell them . He expected a sentence of maybe three years when he showed_up May 23 for sentencing . By then , though , prosecutors had learned more about him , including the fact that he had been convicted of at least one prior serious felony . They charged him as a two-strike defendant , a provision of the new law that mandated that the judge double whatever sentence McCowan would get for felony petty theft . Angered , McCowan rescinded his guilty plea and requested a preliminary hearing . That is when Deputy Dist . Atty . Rafelson combed through old court records and pieced together McCowan ' s full criminal history . &quot; He ' s got a rap sheet that would wrap around a house , &quot; Bradbury said . And that is why McCowan is being prosecuted as a three-strikes defendant , Bradbury said . The man assigned to prosecute the case , Deputy Dist . Atty . William G . Karr , said he has no qualms about putting the accused cologne thief away for life . &quot; I think this is an appropriate three-strikes case , &quot; Karr said . &quot; It ' s because of his record. &quot; McCowan ' s supporters disagree , saying prosecutors are abusing their discretionary powers . &quot; I ' m sad to hear the events have turned_out like this , &quot; said Lonnie McCowan . &quot; It ' s unfair . Here ' s a person who didn ' t get picked_up for a violent crime . . . . If you use this law across the board , you ' re going to throw_away some diamonds that are just surrounded in some crud. &quot; Defense_attorney Daily believes the three-strikes law should be stricken . &quot; I don ' t think any civil person , if they really got_to know what this case was all about , would agree that this is the proper punishment , &quot; Daily said . &quot; Obviously , if McCowan is guilty , he should pay a price . He ' s got a very bad background , a long criminal history . But even in spite of that , you don ' t send someone to prison for essentially the rest of his life for this type of behavior. &quot; Roosevelt McCowan said he ' s all for the three-strikes law -- for violent offenders . &quot; If a person is hurtin ' people , and he continues hurtin ' people , he should get what ' s coming_to him , &quot; he said . &quot; In my case , I wasn ' t trying to hurt nobody. &quot;</TEXT>
