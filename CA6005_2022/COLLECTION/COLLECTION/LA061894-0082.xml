   <TEXT> Six teachers from Roman_Catholic elementary and high_schools in some of Los Angeles County ' s toughest neighborhoods will spend 10 days at Harvard_University this month learning about the spiritual growth of children from noted psychiatrist Robert Coles . The six are among 22 Catholic schoolteachers nationwide who have been chosen to take_part in the &quot; Teaching for Spiritual Growth Institute , &quot; which begins Monday . The program draws heavily from the research and teaching of Coles , a Harvard professor and internationally recognized expert on children in poverty . The institute is a joint_venture of Foundations and Donors Interested in Catholic Activities Inc. , the National Catholic Education Assn. , and the Jesuit-sponsored Weston School of Theology . &quot; We wanted to expose our best and brightest teachers to Coles ' philosophy and his approach to the spiritual growth of children , &quot; said Mike Carotta , director of the institute , now in its second year . &quot; Last year we chose young people who showed promise and ( whom ) we wanted to stay in this field . This year , we found ourselves drawn to a mix of rookies who are diamonds in the rough ( and ) veterans who have not given_up , who want to retool. &quot; Participants from Los Angeles schools are Galen Chappelle of St . Agnes Elementary School , Michael B . Fabian of Junipero Serra High_School , Joseph Neeb of St . Thomas the Apostle Elementary School , and Patricia L . Neff of St . Frances X . Cabrini Elementary School . Diana M . Solis of Ramona Convent Secondary_School in Alhambra and Martin Zemanek of St . Anthony High_School in Long_Beach were also selected . The teachers receive fellowships to attend the institute , as well as a commitment from their schools that they will be able to initiate a project that springs from their work_at Harvard . Before leaving this week , Neeb , who teaches religion and family life , said : &quot; Dr. Coles writes that teachers can ' t possibly use the same curriculum to teach religion in Brentwood as in Pico-Union where I work , even though the ultimate message is the same. &quot; Neeb is looking_forward to getting help at the institute on a project he originated that uses self-esteem and religious concepts to teach abstinence and combat teen pregnancy . Coles will work intensively with the teachers , Carotta said , by &quot; using stories to uncover the moral and spiritual perspectives of kids. &quot; Eight other professors will also give presentations . There will be time for reflection and recreation , Carotta said , because at_work &quot; these folks never get a break. &quot; DATES * A Los Angeles March for Jesus near one of the sights of the 1992 riots is scheduled for Saturday , June 25 , one of thousands of marches to take_place that day in 170 countries . &quot; There is no political agenda , no social agenda or protest taking_place , but rather a celebration designed to bring whole communities together , &quot; said Tom Pelton , national coordinator .
