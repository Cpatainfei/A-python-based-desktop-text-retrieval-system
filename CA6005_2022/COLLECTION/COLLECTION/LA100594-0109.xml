   <HEADLINE> THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY : CASE MAY TURN_ON JURY ' S GRASP OF DNA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than a dozen of the written questions handed to potential jurors in the O.J. Simpson murder trial inquire about their understanding of blood sampling , molecular_biology , mathematics and other aspects of science . This interest in science by Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito and the prosecution and defense , who wrote the questionnaire , points_up something we all know -- the importance of DNA testing to the outcome of the trial . The curiosity about jurors ' knowledge of science , and their attitudes toward it , also is a reminder that both the prosecution and defense need to explain DNA to jurors who may know_nothing of science -- and may be hostile toward it . For , in the end , the case may well be decided by the jurors ' understanding of the role of DNA ( deoxyribonucleic_acid ) , which is found in cells and determines how our bodies grow . As C.R. Calladine and Horace A . Drew wrote in &quot; Understanding DNA , &quot; our bodies &quot; are made from billions of individual cells and DNA is the control_center of each and every cell , &quot; shaping us as if it were sending_out &quot; memos from the main_office of a factory to its workshops. &quot; DNA varies from person to person and , according to a 1990 study by Congress ' Office of Technology Assessment , tests &quot; can accurately disclose DNA patterns that reflect DNA differences among humans. &quot; DNA analysts say chances of two people having the same pattern are so remote that they express them with outrageous figures , such_as 1 in 24 million or even 1 in 27 trillion . But some judges have insisted that the statistical probability is much greater , such_as 1 in 250 # 000 . This numbers dispute is crucial to the Simpson case . The prosecution maintains that DNA found in blood and hair samples at Nicole Brown Simpson ' s Brentwood townhouse and O.J. Simpson ' s nearby mansion link him -- and no one else -- to her murder and that of her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman . * The questionnaire probed prospective jurors ' attitudes on whether the prosecution contention is valid : What is your view concerning the reliability of DNA analysis to accurately identify a person as the possible source of blood or hair found at a crime scene ? General_knowledge of DNA was important . The questionnaire seemed to be trying to determine whether jurors would come_to the courtroom with preconceived notions on the subject . They were asked if they had read any book , articles or magazines concerning DNA analysis ? Were they aware of other court cases involving DNA analysis ? This was followed by questions probing a knowledge of science in_general . Among them : Have you ever taken courses in population genetics , statistics or molecular_biology ? Have you had any specialized training in medicine , science or biology ? How comfortable do you feel dealing with mathematical concepts ? Other questions delved into personal experiences that might make a juror hostile or friendly toward science : Have you or anyone close to you undergone an amniocentesis ? Were you confident of the results ? Have you ever provided a urine or blood sample to be analyzed ? Another group of questions sought to determine attitudes toward &quot; experts , &quot; whether jurors were skeptical of them or tended to accept what they said . In back of those questions was the knowledge by the judge and the attorneys that DNA testing is fairly new_to crime-solving , and that most jurors know_nothing of it . In fact , many of the jurors had left school before the basic concepts of DNA structure were understood . The first time the procedure was used to solve a crime was in the mid- ' 80s when a distinguished British geneticist , Dr. Alec Jeffreys , showed that the DNA in a blood sample matched that in semen found in two rape-murder victims . Since then , it has been used in a number of criminal cases . Despite its growing acceptance , though , both judges and lawyers have been concerned about whether jurors can understand it . One of California ' s leading prosecution DNA experts , Deputy Dist . Atty . George W . Clarke of San Diego County , made that point in a recent article in a legal journal . He quoted a California appellate_court opinion in which the justices seemed to be admitting that neither they nor jurors could understand the concept of DNA . &quot; We cannot reasonably ask the average juror to decide such arcane questions . . . when we ourselves have struggled to grasp these concepts , &quot; the justices said . &quot; The judicial_system encourages resistance to new scientific techniques , &quot; Clarke told me . &quot; Judges fear jurors will blind themselves to the rest of the evidence . They believe we can ' t let jurors hear ( scientific evidence ) because they can ' t critically examine the techniques. &quot; In other words , the judges are afraid that the jurors will be conned by the experts while the prosecutors , wanting DNA evidence admitted , say jurors are smart enough to understand the science . * Los Angeles County Deputy Dist . Atty . Lisa Kahn , the DNA expert on the Simpson prosecution team , knows about the difficulty of selling DNA evidence in a courtroom . In 1990 , she successfully prosecuted Henry Wilds , who eventually was sentenced to 49 years in prison for sexual_assaults and robberies of two San Fernando Valley women . &quot; We were concerned that it would be too complex , but it was my experience that there is a way to present it to a jury as long you understand your audience and present it in a way that is understandable , &quot; Kahn told me . &quot; . . . It is my experience that jurors are very interested in scientific evidence. &quot; In the 1990 case , Kahn ' s first witness was a well-known DNA lab official who , Kahn said , taught the jury fundamentals . He was followed by a distinguished Yale geneticist who continued the teaching process , explaining DNA even more . There were many_more experts testifying on both sides . Recognizing the importance of communicating DNA complexities to the jury , the defense is sending_in two nationally known attorneys , Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck , who are experts in challenging the admissibility of DNA evidence . When the DNA lawyers take_over , they will be arguing over the heart and soul of the Simpson case . And , unlike much of what has been presented to the public and in court so far , it will take more_than a sound_bite to explain .</TEXT>
