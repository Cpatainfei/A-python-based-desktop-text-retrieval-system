   <HEADLINE> SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY ; MORMON_CHURCH IS ACTIVELY SEEKING MEMBERS AMONG ASIANS AND OTHER LOCAL IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mormon missionaries Yu-Chudn Cheng , an emigre from Taiwan , and Tyler Charlesworth , a burly Utah football_player , slip_off their shoes in the entryway and pad through Alex Chen ' s Lomita home . Within sight of a large image of Buddha , Cheng teaches about the Mormon_church , showing Chen a series of charts , and gives him a Book_of_Mormon and pamphlets -- all_in Mandarin_Chinese . Charlesworth doesn ' t speak Mandarin , so he studies his own church literature while Cheng teaches . Cheng , who converted to the church as a teen-ager , believes so fervently in his calling that he traveled_to Utah to learn English so he could bring the faith to Mandarin-speaking people in the United States during his mission . But conversion was not without sacrifice . Cheng says that after he became a Mormon , his parents told him he &quot; was no longer their son. &quot; Cheng and Charlesworth leave Chen with a promise to call again . The missionaries spend six days a week combing neighborhoods in search of people willing to learn about the Mormon religion . About four or five people each month ask_for information in Mandarin , a smAll sign of the larger trends that are remaking the church . Once a homogeneous church best known outside its ranks for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir , Brigham Young University and the Osmond family , the Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints is expanding and diversifying at a rapid pace in Southern California and around the globe . Church membership grew by 22 % in the United States between 1982 and 1991 , while some mainstream Protestant_denominations reported declines of up_to 40 % , according to the National Council of Churches . Church membership worldwide has climbed from 5 million in 1982 to 9 million , according to church figures . In Southern California , the trends have been mixed . The Mormon_Church has seen some of its white membership age and retire to other regions of the country . But in the South Bay , the church has reached_out to replace its departing white members with Latinos , Pacific Islanders , AsiaNs And others . The church is organized into stakes , which are regional units made_up of congregations called wards , which typically have 400 to 600 members , and branches , which range from a dozen members to several hundred . Mormons in the South Bay are served bythe Torrance , Torrance North , Palos Verdes and Inglewood stakes . Church facilities house a variety of wards specifically for ethnic_groups . On Sundays , wards use the facilities in shifts to accommodate services , Sunday_school and leadership meetings . South Bay Mormons worship each week in a church , but they must travel_to West Los Angeles to the Mormon Temple for marriage and rites intended to seal spouses to each other and to their children in this life and for eternity . In California , the only other temples are in San Diego and in Oakland . Although the weekly teachings are the same in every ward around the world , the church adapts by offering services in languages in_use in local areas . About 2 1 / 2 years ago , the Palos Verdes Ward established a Japanese branch that serves the families of Japanese auto_manufacturers and others who want services in the language . &quot; It helps them to give them some reFerence_point , to feel more accustomed to the American culture in_general , &quot; said Mark Tateuka , president of the Japanese branch . Recognizing the influx of Japanese-speaking people into the area , South Bay church officials asked_for help reaching them . &quot; We have made a request to the mission president that we need the ability to communicate to them in their own language , &quot; said Martin Slater , president of the Torrance North Stake . Another fast-growing segment of the church is Pacific Islanders . Titus K . May , 57 , president of the Inglewood Stake , traces his roots to Hawaiian and Napoleonic royalty . Besides its English-speaking wards , Inglewood also has Tongan wards , where some men come_to meetings in long robes and straw belts . Church officials say most of the Tongans converted on their home islands , where more_than half of the population is Mormon . * To keep_up with the growth , the church has poured millions of dollars into its Southern California facilities . Four years ago , the church opened a $ 4-million , 50 # 000-square-foot worship center at 228th and Main_streets in Carson . The Huntington Park West Stake center is expected to open this fall , and the church is planning to spend $ 4 million renovating the Hollywood Ward and the Wilshire Ward in Koreatown . The church is also purchasing an eight-acre parcel at 3000 E . South St . in Lakewood . Church officials say plans for the site may include a building that could house as_many as eight congregations . The six wards that worship in the Carson church include two Samoan units , a Spanish unit , a singles unit and two English units . The Palos Verdes Stake has two English-speaking wards , a singles ward and Chinese , Japanese and Spanish branches . Church officials say wards based on language are for the convenience of members , but that the ideal would be to hold all services in English . &quot; It would be my desire for complete integration , if the language abilities allowed it , &quot; said Martin Slater , president of the Torrance North Stake . The demographic changes are in striking contrast to a common perception that the Mormon_church is a predominantly white church that has sought to stay that way . After all , the church denied priesthood to blacks for more_than a century until a &quot; divine revelation &quot; in 1978 ended such discrimination and opened the door to &quot; every faithful , worthy man in the church. &quot; Almost from its inception , the church began sending missionaries to Europe and to Mexico . In 1988 the church celebrated its 100th year in SAmoa . Since its inception , the church has ventured into 149 countries , &quot; every country that allows it to come_in , &quot; said J . Gordon Melton , director of the Santa Barbara-based Institute for the Study of American Religion . &quot; Today , Mormons would be among the five most ethnically and culturally diverse churches going. &quot; The Book_of_Mormon , the pillar of the church ' s faith , tells the story of immigrants from the Middle_East who founded elaborate civilizations in the Americas . Visited by Christ after the Resurrection , they prospered for centuries , only to disappear after falling victim to evil ways and infighting . Their story , inscribed on golden tablets , was said to have been found in New York by Joseph_Smith in 1823 , guided by a vision of an angel named Moroni . It is an image of Moroni , covered in gold_leaf , that can be seen holding a trumpet atop the church ' s temples . * Smith established for the church a strict code_of_conduct . Mormons are expected to donate one-tenth of their income to the church , wear special undergarments with markings that symbolize a covenant with God and follow dietary rules banning alcohol , coffee , tea and tobacco , and urge that meat be consumed sparingly . Although the church espoused polygamy in the early 19th Century , it officially discarded the practice in 1890 . Today , the church ' s tight-knit families gather one night each week for a &quot; home evening &quot; devoted to prayer , study and other activities that can range from board_games to night skiing . The church teaches that it is important for families to get_along because they will meet again in heaven . The spirits of dead ancestors , identified by zealous genealogical research in the church ' s databank of more_than 2 billion names , are also offered a chance at glory , and those found worthy are promised resurrection as celestial beings , with the privilege to learn at God ' s feet and eventually to rise to a godly status . Devout Mormons pray , study and socialize every Sunday at chapels , or meeting_houses . Classes , worship and meetings can fill_up to 10 hours a week , with volunteer pastors , known as bishops , and higher-ranking church officials putting_in much more time . Faabo Asi , a new bishop in one of Carson ' s Samoan wards , attends_to many of the same needs as a parish priest . He offers help and counseling , coordinates activities and tends to the spiritual needs of the church_members . &quot; When you volunteer your service for something , you are blessed for it , &quot; Asi says when asked about the time he devotes to ministry . With no professional clergy , church_services are led by members of the congregation . Church_members can baptize their own children or spouses , they practice healing rites , and all male members are eligible for priesthood . Keith J . Atkinson , a church spokesman who served a mission in Mexico , said the church ' s hands-on approach has attracted many Latinos , who he believes find a sense of empowerment in the Mormon traditions that enable them to perform baptisms , blessings and other functions in their own families that in the other churches would be performed by a priest or minister . Other Mormon converts are attracted by the church ' s commitment to traditional family values and stringent moral guidelines . After a young Mormon from Utah visited her family at their home_in the Philippines , Tessie Castillo converted to the faith at the age of 17 . She served her mission in Des Moines , Iowa , and now attends the singles ward in the Palos Verdes Stake . Castillo believes the focus_on familiar icons , strong family values and education made_it easy for her to convert from Catholicism . The church depends_on members such_as Castillo and Asi to be examples of Mormonism ' s virtues . Church leaders say many converts are introduced to the church by Mormon neighbors . But casual contacts alone do not account_for the church ' s rapid expansion . Clues to understanding that phenomenon lie_in the church ' s structure and tenets . The church promotes a high birth_rate among couples . Temple statues and church literature depict large families as the ideal , and women ' s roles as mothers and homemakers are emphasized . Mormon children , meanwhile , are groomed for missionary_work from the moment they are old enough to learn the words to &quot; I Hope They Call Me on a Mission &quot; in the Mormon hymnal . By the time they are 19 , the age at which they are eligible to serve , few Mormon men consider doing anything else . They send letters to Salt_Lake_City stating their willingness to serve and wait for marching orders . Women are eligible at 21 to serve 18-month missions and now constitute 22 % of the missionary roster , church officials say . If a foreign language is required , missionaries are trained at the Missionary Training Center in Provo , Utah . The center offers courses in 44 languages and trains about 3 # 300 missionaries each month , church officials say . Yu-Chudn Cheng , who learned English at the training center , has taught Mormon beliefs to Mandarin- and English-speaking people in Los Angeles for more_than a year . Cheng said he often spends much of his time explaining the teachings relating to Jesus_Christ because Taiwanese traditionally are Buddhist and don ' t know much about Christ . Mormon youngsters often start saving money when they are small to pay_for their living expenses while serving on their missions . To ease the burden on families whose children are sent to high-cost areas such_as Japan , the church now asks each missionary ' s family to pay $ 350 per month in missionary support . Those who travel_to low-cost areas contribute the same amount , effectively subsidizing the others . * While serving on their missions , men and women are expected to abide_by rules of conduct that make everyday Mormon standards seem relaxed : no dating , no television , no radio , no movies , no family visits and no more_than two phone_calls home per year . They rise at 6 a.m. , study religion for a_few hours , hit the sidewalk by 9:30 a.m. and are not permitted to return to their apartments until 9:30 p.m. More_than 50 # 000 missionaries are stationed around the globe , church officials say . There are 212 missionaries in the Los Angeles Mission , which includes the South Bay . The reaction of other local religious_leaders to Mormonism ' s tenacious campaign ranges from grudging admiration to restrained irritation . The Mormon missionary activity is &quot; far more aggressive than anything we ' re doing , &quot; said Father Gregory Coiro , a spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles . &quot; I don ' t want to say being aggressive is bad . Maybe we should be saying we ' re not aggressive enough. &quot; The Catholic_Church has begun strengthening its ties to the ethnic communities of Southern California , he said . The St . Thomas_Aquinas parish in Monterey Park , for example , was recently designated a Chinese-speaking evangelical center . The move was intended to offer a home parish to the region ' s Chinese population , although the decision also angered a large segment of the parish ' s predominantly Latino membership . But Coiro said he does not believe the Catholic_church ' s Latino stronghold is being eroded by the Mormon_Church . The Mormon_Church is &quot; one of the many religions , sects and cults that are out there trying to attract people , &quot; he said . &quot; Mormons ask people to believe_in some very fantastic things , like they can become the gods of_their_own planets . SoMeone who ' s well grounded in Christianity is not going_to join a religion that says you can become God. &quot; But Mormons say there is nothing fantastic about living_by strict moral guidelines , emphasizing family and religion , and serving others as a way_of_life . &quot; I think that if everybody in the world were doing that , it would be a lot better , &quot; Charlesworth said .
