   <HEADLINE> A FAREWELLTO ARMS ? ; HIS SMILE IS CHARMING , HIS MESSAGE WELCOME : IF SOUTH_AFRICA CAN WORK FOR PEACE , SO CAN NORTHERN_IRELAND . BUT IS GERRY ADAMS THE RIGHT MESSENGER ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Britons know Gerry Adams and his cease fire . They say he ' s a fascist , an Irish executioner with a peace initiative that ' s just another cheap ploy . Because they have seen his shoulder beneath the caskets of dead terrorists and for 25 years have mourned hundreds bombed by Gerry ' s kids in Northern_Ireland ' s pubs and chip shops , England ' s hotels and offices . Even Harrod ' s , one bloody Christmas . This month , Americans celebrated their Gerry Adams . Editorials and cheering audiences called him the great , courageous hope for peace in Ireland . They back-slapped this tall , bearded , rough-cut nationalist whose past is only alleged and thus may be ignored . In glittering hotels and an Irish pub they raised champagne and beer_glasses to Adams as a shrewd , dogged freedom fighter no different from Nelson Mandela and Yasser Arafat , therefore just as deserving of Washington ' s clout in restoring freedom and democracy to his homeland . Friday , in an empty banquet room at the Century Plaza Hotel , over scrambled eggs ( &quot; Ah ! &quot; ) and hash browns ( &quot; What are these ? &quot; ) Gerry Adams , controversial president of Sinn Fein , political megaphone for the_Irish Republican Army , spoke_of Gerry Adams . His portrayal as a thug , he says , is a caricature drawn by Britain ' s &quot; right_wing and the reactionary press . . . not ( by ) the very democratic , progressive , liberal element in British politics which recognizes the need to end British rule_in Ireland. &quot; But there have been published reports of Adams the teen-age soldier who in 1979 became head of the IRA ' s Army Council . That was the year Lord Mountbatten died when a terrorist bomb exploded his yacht in Sligo . As was his father , so Adams has been shot by Protestant guerrillas and imprisoned for suspected terrorist involvement . Grenades have been thrown at his West Belfast home -- all_of which seems to go beyond reasonable dissent within the career of an ordinary politician . Adams does not bristle_at the suggestions . &quot; I have consistently , and on the record , denied and disputed that ( terrorist allegations ) , &quot; he says . &quot; And I was , in the High_Court in Belfast , acquitted of such a charge. &quot; Adams says he ' s just a political activist , his protests rooted years ago against apartheid in South_Africa and the Vietnam_War . That , he says , makes a man do what a chosen servant of a struggle has to do &quot; through a sense_of_duty . . . probably , if I think hard enough , I have to confess that I never envisaged myself performing this type of role. &quot; No matter trans-Atlantic polarization and colorization -- and British officials advised Washington to refuse Adams a visa to visit the U.S. , citing its own terrorist concerns that still bar Adams from entering Britain -- the richness of Adams ' current role is undeniable . On Aug . 31 , he stunned all sides and splinter_groups of the Northern_Ireland conflict -- known traditionally and coyly as &quot; the troubles &quot; -- by announcing the IRA ' s &quot; complete cessation of military operations. &quot; Adams was a co-engineer of the cease fire . It followed months of hidden negotiations with Britain , with Protestant leaders in the six counties comprising Northern_Ireland , and with Albert Reynolds , prime_minister of the 26 counties forming the Republic_of_Ireland to the south . The IRA olive_branch was extended 10 months after Reynolds and British Prime_Minister John Major agreed that talks on the future of Ireland , north and south , to maintain separate countries or reunite a nation , could be held with the Sinn Fein . But talks only would commence after 90 days of unbroken IRA cease fire . &quot; The current situation has been described , I think very graphically , as space in which hope can grow , &quot; Adams says . He is exhausted by jet_lag , breakfast-to-midnight appearances , a permanent preoccupation with personal security , and now only coffee and passion for the cause is keeping him vertical . &quot; I think my role is to widen that space , and deepen that space , and allow that very delicate seed to flourish. &quot; And for five weeks -- despite the provocation of recent bomb and bullet attacks and killings by Loyalist guerrillas -- the cease fire has held and the peace seed is sprouting . Yet there remain general concerns about IRA sincerity . Does &quot; complete cessation &quot; mean &quot; permanent cease fire ? &quot; If Loyalist paramilitary groups launch major offensives , how long can Republican weapons remain silent ? And after 25 years of fighting , after 3 # 160 killed and 36 # 000 wounded on both sides , with IRA guerrillas undefeated and 15 # 000 British troops holding their ground , why should anybody quit now ? &quot; I think that everyone wants peace and I don ' t think I have any monopoly on that , &quot; Adams says . &quot; Peace is in fact , a political thing . Peace comes when you have certain conditions which nurture , which sustain . . . and ( when there is ) absence of the cause of the conflict , the process of justice and equality. &quot; Peace has also been known to break_out when terrorists grow weary of no-win civil_wars . Or when new generations look_back in frustration at the sins of their fathers , and when financial and political support wane . And there are rumors that the IRA is underfinanced and divided , that this paramilitary minority within a civilian minority no longer represents the majority wants of even Catholics in Northern_Ireland . So rather than ending British control of Northern_Ireland , the popular sentiment could be for evicting the IRA . &quot; To even suggest that any of that is part of the situation would be to make a grave mistake , &quot; Adams cautions . &quot; I think you have an undefeated IRA , 25 years old , competent , undivided and undefeated . &quot; The stalemate that you describe is not a valid description of the situation . I said over 15 years ago there could be no military victory , by either side . And a British minister echoed that some eight or nine years later when he said the IRA could not be militarily defeated . &quot; So if there ' s no military victory , no military solution , then we need a political fix. &quot; That fix , Adams emphasized at every school , every cocktail_party on his diagonal whistle-stop from Boston and New York , to San Francisco and Los Angeles , is the Sinn Fein ( Gaelic for &quot; By Ourselves &quot; ) platform -- British troops out of Ireland , unification of North and South , and a new constitution with a bill of rights . &quot; It must be a new_Ireland , an agreed Ireland , and the people have to decide this Irish_Republic , &quot; is Adams ' way . &quot; And based on the 1916 proclamation ( by a Marxist-Socialist group opposing British rule ) which upholds the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland , the right of our children to education , to the right of people to economic freedom. &quot; Adams denies that Sinn Fein ' s new_Ireland would be organized along Leninist-Marxist lines but insists &quot; we need a transformation and I think the Dublin government acknowledges that. &quot; * Not to be aware of the shadows of Adams ' past is to be charmed by the man . He is articulate , shrewd , and as polished as another famed Irish politician , John F . Kennedy . Although his one-liners are apt to repeat , although the same quotations and word-plays appear in most presentations , Adams massages his speeches to the interests of each group . To Harvard students he noted the contribution of business to the economic stability of all government and nations . At Berkeley it was the value of youthful , virile protest . To Show Coalition , an organization of entertainment_industry activists , he appealed for an end to movie portrayals of Irish men who &quot; never get quite sober &quot; and Irish women as &quot; always very beautiful. &quot; And as have politicians before in their crusades for glamorous support , as has President Clinton , Adams held Hollywood ' s hand . Shortly after Thursday ' s arrival at LAX -- there was California champagne and Guinness in the back of a limousine to celebrate Adams ' 46th birthday -- the Sinn Fein group drove to a home off Mulholland Drive for drinks among and with the stars . Oliver Stone -- bearing no offers to make a movie on the life and times of Gerry Adams -- Sean Penn and Martin Sheen were there . Adams has a sly sense_of_humor . When a page for &quot; Gerry Adams &quot; echoed through LAX , he said : &quot; It ' s nice to be traveling under an alias. &quot; Adams had great patience for a television_reporter who asked : &quot; What is Sinn Fein ? Is that the name of someone ? &quot; He expresses little patience for the_British and that has created a major mischief in his life . He is married , a father , but draws no salary from Sinn Fein . Technically Adams is unemployed , last known job tending bar at the Duke of York pub in Belfast . So , except when traveling on expenses , he receives $ 110 a week in unemployment benefits from the_British government . Yet Adams is diplomatic enough to include &quot; my Protestant brothers and sisters &quot; in the proposed new_Ireland . * He shows great cultural polish by starting and ending each speech with Gaelic greetings and farewell . American audiences rose to his canny reminders that Irish-America has given this country a dozen presidents , that the IRA struggle in Northern_Ireland is a counterpart of the American_Revolution with the identical enemy , and that the first_person to be processed at Ellis Island was Irish . And in asking_for America ' s support and mediation -- which , Adams noted , makes every American a contributor to the freedom of Ireland -- he is expecting no less than what was earned by Mandela and Arafat . For if Jews and Arabs can find agreement in the Middle_East , if there is a new coexistence among black_and_whites in South_Africa , why not a union of Protestants and Catholics , Loyalists and Republicans , in a new and united Ireland ? Of course it is going_to succeed . &quot; We have built a very solid foundation with well_over 25 years involved in the struggle and I don ' t envisage failure , &quot; he insists . &quot; The foundation . . . has been done_in a step-by-step way , sometimes too slowly , sometimes intolerably slow . &quot; But nonetheless . . . had I come here five years ago and told you that Mandela , who was then in prison , a convicted political_prisoner , that he would be president of a new , democratic South_Africa , you could have been excused for being skeptical. &quot; Now , he says , the_British government needs to find a counterpart to former President F.W. de Klerk , whose administration and understanding produced that new South_Africa . &quot; I think that wherever he or she is , this is their moment , this is that time in our history where someone can grasp it and move it forward , and then we can all build_upon the momentum and the foundation , &quot; Adams says . &quot; Where there ' s a political will , and especially where there ' s a goodwill , no conflict is intractable. &quot; Then when , this settlement ? Adams leaves plenty of space . &quot; Certainly . . . as we approach the millennium , &quot; he says . Adams believes the best visions go_forward and never look_back . He is confident that the world has seen the last tears of Northern_Ireland ' s crying game . And inherent to Republican dreams , he says , are the words of Bobby Sands , an IRA gunman who starved to death in 1981 after a prison hunger_strike . &quot; I stand on the threshold of a new , trembling world , &quot; wrote Sands . &quot; Let our triumph be the freedom of all , let our revenge be the laughter of our children. &quot;</TEXT>
