   <HEADLINE> FIRM DENIES IT SHREDDED DATA ON WHITEWATER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Rose Law_Firm where First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner shredded documents related to the Whitewater Development Corp . last week , a newspaper reported Wednesday . The firm emphatically denied the report . The Washington Times cited as its source an unidentified Rose employee . President and Mrs . Clinton , along with James B . McDougal and his then-wife , Susan , were partners in Whitewater , an Arkansas real_estate venture . In Little_Rock , Ark. , Ronald M . Clark , managing partner at Rose , said the report about shredding Whitewater documents was &quot; totally false . . . . I am absolutely sure . I am extremely upset that somebody would allege this. &quot; Clark said his firm had &quot; no significant documents &quot; concerning the Whitewater development . Wesley Pruden , editor-in-chief of the Washington Times , said the newspaper stands_by its story , which he said was based on conversations with &quot; direct and corroborating sources &quot; at the law_firm . The Little_Rock office of special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr . said the report would become part of its investigation into Whitewater and related matters . Fiske , appointed Jan . 20 by Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , is looking_into -- among other things -- whether McDougal improperly diverted funds from Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan Assn. , which he controlled , to Whitewater and Clinton gubernatorial campaigns . Clark said the firm has kept documents , &quot; in anticipation they will be requested. &quot;</TEXT>
