   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN LAW , DISTANCE DISCOURAGE VOTERS ; ELECTION : COUNTRY ' S BAN ON ABSENTEE_BALLOTS MAKES MANY IN O.C. APOLITICAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Adan Tobano took_off his hat , brushed the sweat from his forehead in the afternoon sun , then said he had little interest in politics in Mexico , where presidential elections will take_place Sunday , or in the United States . &quot; What goes_on in my country doesn ' t really affect me any more -- unless I decide to go_back , &quot; said the 30-year-old ice_cream vendor from the state of Puebla . &quot; And here , well , I don ' t think I can vote , and even if I could , I don ' t know enough about it , anyway. &quot; He can ' t vote_in the United States because , although he is in the county legally , he ' s not a citizen . He can , however , vote_in Mexico . But that would mean making a lengthy trip to Tijuana , Tecate or Mexicali , the closest border cities . And he just doesn ' t think it ' s worth it . Tobano is one of thousands of Mexican immigrants who find themselves in political limbo every time an election takes_place south of San Ysidro -- be they from Guanajuato , Guadalajara , Queretaro or Oaxaca . Indeed , they have become an apolitical force . Their numbers are legion in Orange and Los Angeles counties but their electoral power is nil -- on both sides of the border . that ' s because to vote here they must become U.S. citizens , but many legal residents don ' t want to become U.S. citizen because they don ' t want to compromise their nationality . And though they have the ability to cast ballots in Mexico , in special polling_places set_aside by the government for those &quot; in transit , &quot; even then they are only allowed to vote for presidential candidates . So , a majority of Mexican immigrants sit the elections out and glean what they can from the local Spanish newspapers , television or long-distance phone_calls to relatives . &quot; My father can ' t stop talking_about it , &quot; said Mariana Calderon , 40 , a Costa Mesa resident who was born in the state of Durango . &quot; But I never cared much for it. &quot; Maria de Los Angeles , an employee at the Mexican Consulate in Santa Ana , cares about politics . She ' d like to vote , but says her hands are tied . &quot; I just don ' t have the time or the transportation to get_to Tijuana , &quot; she said from behind the counter . If she could , she ' d cast an absentee_ballot from Santa Ana , but the fact is she can ' t , because it is forbidden by the Mexican Constitution , a fact that led an estimated 10 # 000 Mexican immigrants to hold mock elections in Orange and Los Angeles counties over the weekend in which the ruling party lost . &quot; We just want the right to be able to vote outside of Mexico , &quot; said Salvador Vazquez , 56 , who organized the elections on the north_side of Los Angeles . &quot; There ' s absolutely no reason why we shouldn ' t be able to vote from here . A lot of us have to work and just can ' t make_it to la frontera ( the border ) on Sunday. &quot; As a result , very few Mexican immigrants who live and work in Orange County , and whose numbers are growing steadily each year , will have an electoral say in defining the destiny of the &quot; Old Country. &quot; Though there have been numerous attempts by Mexican immigrants in the United States to create an absentee-balloting law -- letters have been written , complaints have been filed with Mexico ' s federal electorate -- Vazquez has his own theories as_to why the Mexican government has yet to embrace such a system . The government &quot; says it ' s too complicated a process , and it will cost a lot of money , but deep down it ' s because the Mexicans who live here generally don ' t agree with the system of government now in power . that ' s why they left the country to begin with. &quot; That is the opinion of a member of the PRD , or Democratic Revolution Party , which contends that its candidate this year , Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , was robbed of the presidency six years ago due_to widespread fraud on the part of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI . The PRI has maintained power ever since it formed in 1929 , another reason why Mexican immigrants fail to see the logic in heading south for the polls . &quot; Why vote when you know who ' s going_to win beforehand -- it ' s just one vote that won ' t matter , &quot; said Newport Beach resident Jorge Gonzales , 29 . Despite the distance and the disadvantages , the Mexican Consulate in Santa Ana still encourages all Mexican citizens to make a beeline for the border to cast their ballots if they have the chance because this election is considered crucial in Mexico ' s political future . And who knows , someday Mexico might include absentee voting in the Mexican Constitution , said Felipe Soria , the consul for the Mexican Consulate in Santa Ana . After all , South_Africa allowed residents living_in foreign countries to cast absentee_ballots during its presidential election in April . About 900 South_Africans in Orange County voted . &quot; The simple fact is Mexico is making some very profound changes , but first it has to deal with the more immediate problems before it can even take_a_look at such a thing as absentee balloting , &quot; he said . Problems such_as settling the uprising in the southern state of Chiapas among indigenous revolutionaries , rebounding from the assassination of PRI ' s former presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio , and effectively competing in the North_American Free_Trade Agreement are just a_few problems Mexico ' s new president will have to face . The top contenders for the presidency include : Ernesto Zedillo of PRI ; Cardenas of PRD ; Alvaro Perez Trevino of PARM , the Authentic Mexican_Revolution Party ; Marcela Lombardo Otero of PPS , the People ' s Socialist_Party ; and Diego Fernandez of PAN , the National Action Party . But those names are as foreign as the country is far , at least for Jaime Mercado , a research lab technician of La Habra who was born in the United States but whose parents were born in Mexico . He said he pays little attention to the politics , unless it ' s at a grass-roots level . &quot; I helped get a friend elected to the City_Council in Rosemead , &quot; he said . * RELATED STORY : A16</TEXT>
