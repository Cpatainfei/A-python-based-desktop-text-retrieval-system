   <HEADLINE> PAIN VICTIMS SOFTEN ACHE OF ISOLATION AT GATHERINGS ; HEALTH : MEMBERS OF ASSOCIATION MEET TWICE A MONTH FOR FRIENDSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING THAT IS OFTEN ELUSIVE IN DAILY LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Imagine a sharp , endless toothache , and you still have no idea how much chronic pain hurts . But no one gripes or grimaces at this meeting of the American Chronic Pain Assn . Spinal braces , foam cushions and canes carried into the meeting room at St . Jude ' s Catholic_Church in Westlake are the only visible clues that the 17 members here are suffering . On the first and third Tuesdays of each month , they gather to talk_of lives and careers shattered by nonstop pain . They share advice on thinking past pain , exercising through pain and just living with pain . And in two hours of joking banter , hand-holding prayer and frank confession , they accomplish together what doctors , drugs and surgery have failed to do : They make each other feel better . &quot; I ' d be getting toward my wits ' end if I didn ' t have the group , &quot; said Gene Dedick , 75 , of Thousand Oaks . Dedick founded the Southern California division of the worldwide self-help group seven years ago after a blown Achilles_tendon and several spine operations left pain shooting through his legs and back . Now there are 17 chapters in the region and nearly 800 around the world . &quot; We get_together , we discuss our various problems , how we live with chronic pain , &quot; Dedick said . &quot; Anyone who does not have chronic pain has no idea of the pain and agony we go through. &quot; No one understands -- that is a common thread of discussion for those who suffer with pain that never goes_away . Nonstop pain , they say , creates an isolating , us-versus-them mentality . Family members get tired_of hearing complaints . Co-workers are unsympathetic or ignorant . Friends drift away . Employers shun you . &quot; People don ' t understand . And if you complain , they don ' t know how to deal with it , because they want to help you but they don ' t know how , &quot; said association member Mike Taylor of Thousand Oaks . Taylor , 53 , has pieced together a multifaceted career after several back surgeries and the degeneration of his spine left him unable to walk and stricken with chronic pain . He moves by wheelchair and travels with a specially equipped van to part-time jobs counseling teen-agers , working_at a radio_station and advising the city of Thousand Oaks on services for the disabled . He pushes himself twice monthly to bring his infectious good_humor and an impish love of dirty_jokes to the pain association meetings . But the pain is nearly constant , he said , and there are days when he simply cannot get_out of bed . &quot; It ' s like having a toothache , &quot; Taylor said . &quot; What do you do when you have a toothache ? You go_to the dentist . But I can ' t . that ' s what chronic pain is like. &quot; June Dube gives_up her lunch hours as an executive_secretary with a_Thousand Oaks cosmetics firm to attend the meetings . One of the few members able to hold_down a full-time job , Dube said she was stricken five years ago with arthritis in both hips and a shoulder and with the ache of fibromyalgia burning in her muscles . She must work , she said , because she needs the health_insurance . Her co-workers are supportive , but they can only imagine what she goes_through , she said . &quot; It ' s very difficult . I have to balance a certain amount of walking , a certain amount of sitting and a certain amount of movement . If I sit for too long and stand_up , my joints are too stiff to move. &quot; She can ' t take medicines because of a physical intolerance , and she must wake_up at 5 a.m. just to stretch_out the night ' s stiffness and get ready for the day . At work , she must treat herself with care , she said . &quot; I look all_right , &quot; Dube said . &quot; But because I ' m not missing any limbs and I ' m not bleeding from my eyes , people assume I ' m all right. &quot; Some job interviewers discriminate against those who complain of chronic pain . &quot; These days , they will not accept you if you have limitations , &quot; said George Wolters , 64 , a former American Airlines worker disabled by a herniated_disc that required several operations . &quot; I could not find anything unless it was_on a voluntary job basis. &quot; Many of the association ' s 7 # 000 members joined the group not only to find relief from pain but to fight the crushing depression that often accompanies the months and years of ceaseless discomfort . Forced from full-time work , confined to home and sometimes bed , some chronic-pain sufferers sink into despair and even contemplate suicide . &quot; They feel there ' s no purpose to their life , &quot; member Craig Holt said . &quot; They become completely non-functional. &quot; Holt , 51 , worked as a photo lab technician in the movie_industry before osteoporosis and arthritis began crumbling his frame . He recently took Dedick ' s place as the association ' s volunteer liaison to Southern California . &quot; And as people become more and more isolated at_home with their pain , they can feel more and more removed from society and the outside world , &quot; he added . &quot; They begin to think they ' re the only persons in the world suffering from this. &quot; Some accuse chronic-pain victims of being whining hypochondriacs , association members say . In fact , said Dr. Joshua Prager , director of the UCLA Pain Medicine Center , patients usually suffer real ills ranging from surgery-induced backaches to stress-aggravated stomach disorders . And as pain lingers , the psychological burden grows , he said . &quot; It ' s not just something you feel in your body ; it ' s an emotional experience that ' s partially triggered by what ' s going_on in your body , &quot; Prager said . Drugs can block the pain , make_it manageable . But they often dull the patient ' s sensitivity -- and they can build walls between patients and an understanding of why they hurt , he said . &quot; Behavior plays a major role in pain , &quot; Prager said . &quot; ( If ) we can relax , we can modulate our pain. &quot; At the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla , doctors use behavior_modification to teach patients to work past their pain , pain expert Alan H . Roberts said . In five weeks of outpatient treatment , they are taught to stop acting hurt -- no grimacing , limping or holding a painful body_part . And they practice stretches and exercises that make them more mobile , independent and confident , he said . &quot; How much of pain can be in a person ' s head ? The answer is that all_of it ' s in a person ' s head -- cut a person ' s head_off and there ' s no pain , &quot; said Roberts , head of the clinic ' s division of medical psychology . &quot; There are a variety of reasons why people have chronic pain , some of which is clearly psychological. &quot; The patient often holds the key to stopping chronic pain , Roberts and Prager agreed , and self-help groups often help turn that key . &quot; We have a chance every day to re-create ourselves , &quot; association member William Parker said . After 15 years of near-constant pain in his lower spine and legs , the Thousand Oaks pharmacist had all but abandoned his career . Then , he said , he joined the association five years ago and regained control . The pain never ended , but he has reassembled his work to_the_point where he is teaching again at UC San Francisco ' s School of Pharmacy , he said . &quot; I tell people I can be incredibly productive for about five minutes a day , &quot; Parker told members at the meeting , squirming uncomfortably on a foam cushion . &quot; I produced two U . S . patents in the past year , &quot; he said with a sly smile , &quot; so I guess they took about five minutes apiece. &quot; FYI For information about the American Chronic Pain Assn . chapter nearest you , call the group ' s Sacramento-area headquarters at ( 916 ) 632-0922 , or write P.O.
