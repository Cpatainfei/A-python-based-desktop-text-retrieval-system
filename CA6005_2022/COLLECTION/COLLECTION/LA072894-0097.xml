   <HEADLINE> LOST IN O.C. : JUMPIN ' JUPITER ! can ' t THE PLANET TAKE A JOKE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' re reading this , I can only presume that we ' re all still here . I ' ve been waiting this past week for a comet-blasted piece of Jupiter to come knock the Earth into a corner pocket . Call it wishful_thinking . Unless you are a ) in a drooling coma ; b ) busy watching the endless O.J. Simpson &quot; special reports &quot; or c ) someone who thinks there ' s an appreciable difference between a ) and b ) , you ' ve probably noticed that our tubbiest celestial neighbor has recently been getting slapped silly by a series of comet fragments . There were a number of planetary possibilities I was mulling , wondering what effect it would have_on Earth if Jupiter were destroyed . At the very least Sydney Omarr ' s job would get easier . At most , some glob of Jupiter would come our way and destroy us , which I suppose would also allow Omarr to slack_off a bit . &quot; Focus_on still being dead , &quot; he might daily suggest to all astrological signs . If Mars is the Angry Red_Planet , Jupiter is the Problem Acne Planet , pocked with all manner of unsightly blotches , including a prominent one twice the size of Earth that scientists call the Red Spot , when Jupiter ' s out of hearing distance . And now these comet fragments have been causing outbreaks even bigger than that , including one huge 9 # 600-mile-wide zit that has been oozing superheated gasses 1 # 300 miles into the ether . Were Jupiter not 480 million miles from Earth , we ' d have a major space etiquette question on our hands . Like , should we say something , and if so , what ? &quot; Hey pal , thanks for sharing ! &quot; &quot; Sorry , I ' m out of Stridex pads ; would you like to use Canada instead ? &quot; &quot; Say , is that a spume of billions of tons of superheated gasses , or are you just glad to see me ? &quot; Anyway , these fragments have been hitting the planet with impacts deemed greater than hundreds of times the combined force of all_the world ' s nuclear_weapons -- and at a fraction of the cost ! -- prompting one scientist with a gift for understatement to remark , &quot; We can be very glad that this comet was heading for Jupiter and not Earth. &quot; But what if one of these comet McNuggets missed Jupiter , and the gravitational pull of the planet -- which maybe heard us guffawing at the Red Spot after all -- spun it around so it was headed right for us ? What if one of Jupiter ' s 11 moons -- which all seem to have names like Eo and Geo Metro -- got knocked in our direction ? Not once have I heard a political candidate put forth a plan to deal with flaming terrors from outer space , though I ' d like to think Ross Perot was working_up to it in the last presidential campaign . How would Earth defend itself ? What if we got every armed person in the world , or at least Santa Ana , to shoot at the comet at_the_same_time ? Could we sue ? If nothing else maybe some enterprising outfit could send a rocket to hang a big sign_on it that says , &quot; I ' m going_to Disneyland ! &quot; or perhaps one of those bumper stickers that reads &quot; Bend over , I ' ll drive ! &quot; But then , if we were about to become extinct , do you think the folks running things would tell you ? They know you ' d just blow_off your job , loot the Liquor Barn , burn your condoms , cut_off the roof of your car and spend your last hours on Earth letting your black Labrador steer down I-5 as you slurred the lyrics to &quot; Roller_Coaster of Love &quot; at every passing car ; would n ' t you ? Our civic_leaders know this , because they know they ' d be doing the same thing , and they don ' t want competition . It could be that a big hunk o ' doom is still heading our way , what with 480 million miles to be traversed before it obliterates us . And why the hell not ? There are times I ' d sure be hard-pressed to justify our existence . For example , what can one say of a species where the greatest solar_system cataclysm in human history is taking_place , and nearly all our collective attention is instead focused_on the minutiae of a tabloid-esque murder case ? And we ' re talking way minute minutiae here , such_as the one network TV affiliate that solicited opinions on O.J. Simpson ' s character from a man whose sole qualification -- no kidding -- was that three years ago he had once sat on a couch next to victim Ronald Goldman as contestants on that highly-regarded TV_show &quot; Studs. &quot; Here ' s a theory the Simpson defense hasn ' t put forth yet , though it ' s only a matter of time : Maybe the &quot; international hero &quot; was set_up to provide a distraction from -- that ' s right -- the comet that ' s rushing to kill us all . would n ' t it be a great , and irrefutable , bit of courtroom dramatics if attorney Robert Shapiro were to announce , &quot; Ladies and gentlemen , defense Exhibit A ! &quot; right as a sputtering fireball the size of Alaska sliced_through the Equator ? And not only would it be the end of the world , but we could watch it on TV .</TEXT>
