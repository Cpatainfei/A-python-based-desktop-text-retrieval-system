   <HEADLINE> WHITE_HOUSE SHRINKS ESTIMATES ON DEFICIT ; ECONOMY : THE ADMINISTRATION ' S MIDYEAR REPORT SAYS THE RECOVERY IS EASING THE RED INK FASTER THAN IT HAD PREDICTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration , trumpeting perhaps its most important economic_policy achievement , said Tuesday that the federal_deficit is shrinking faster than even the White_House expected in response to accelerating economic_growth . Administration officials now estimate the deficit will decline to $ 167.1 billion in 1995 , and they say the Clinton economic plan should result in a cumulative $ 691.7 billion in deficit reduction over five years . Originally , President Clinton claimed that the deficit would shrink by about $ 500 billion over five years if his 1993 economic package was passed_by Congress . The new figures , included in the Administration ' s midyear review of the budget to be officially released Thursday , also show that Clinton should come_close to achieving his goal , first_stated during the 1992 presidential campaign , of cutting the deficit in half during his first term in office . The new forecast for fiscal 1995 calls_for the deficit , as a share of the overall economy , to decline to its lowest level since 1979 . When Clinton came_into office , his Administration projected that the deficit in 1995 would hit $ 301.8 billion unless his economic plan was approved by Congress . And even in its last full budget last winter , the White_House predicted that next year ' s deficit would total $ 176.1 billion . For 1994 , the Administration now estimates the deficit will hit $ 220.1 billion , down from February ' s prediction of $ 234.8 billion . Virtually all_of the improvement in the deficit outlook since the Administration ' s last official projection was issued last winter has come as a result of accelerating economic_growth . Faster growth puts more people back to work , which means they pay more taxes to the federal_government . More employment also tends to lower the welfare rolls , holding_down Medicaid health_care costs for welfare recipients . Growth also leads to healthier banks and savings and loans , thus lowering federal costs for bank and thrift bailouts . &quot; We thought we were targeting about $ 500 billion in deficit reduction over five years ; we ' re now looking_at close to $ 700 billion . . . . Of that $ 200 billion , a good portion comes from revenues that are flowing in above our expectations because of economic performance , and we have gotten some smaller costs in the health_care area as well , &quot; White_House Budget Director Leon Panetta said . The news briefing to announce the figures marked Panetta ' s last public appearance as budget director ; he is moving at the end of the week to the White_House to become chief_of_staff . He will be succeeded at the Office of Management and Budget by his deputy , Alice Rivlin , who , like Panetta , is widely considered a deficit hawk . Still , the new figures show that rising interest_rates will create a larger deficit in later years . The White_House said that beginning in 1996 , the effect of this year ' s rising interest_rates will more_than offset the positive impact of faster growth , resulting in a deficit of $ 179.2 billion , up slightly from February ' s estimate of $ 173.1 billion . But that is still far below the Administration ' s initial projection , made in early 1993 , that the deficit would reach $ 298 billion in 1996 without the Clinton plan . The budget_deficit hit its all-time record of $ 290 billion in 1992 . The Administration ' s new report is certain to renew the partisan debate in Washington over the degree to which Clinton can claim credit for improved outlooks for the deficit and the economy . Most private economists argue that the Clinton plan has had relatively little to do with the overall recovery . Deficit in Decline ?
