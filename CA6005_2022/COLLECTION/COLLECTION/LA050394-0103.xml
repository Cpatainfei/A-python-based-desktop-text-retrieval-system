   <HEADLINE> VOLUNTARY CUTBACKS IN WATER USE REQUESTED ; DROUGHT : DESPITE STATE ANNOUNCEMENT , LOCAL OFFICIALS SAY LAST YEAR ' S SURPLUS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO CARRY THE COUNTY THROUGH THE SHORTAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although water_levels in Ventura County ' s reserves remain relatively high , a drought watch announced Monday by state officials has the county ' s largest water distributor asking residents to voluntarily cut_back on usage . Despite a rainy_season that produced a snowpack estimated to be about 70 % below normal , local officials said last year ' s surplus should be enough to carry the county through the shortage . &quot; The state water_levels are way below normal , &quot; said Don Kendall , manager of the Calleguas Municipal Water District , which provides water from state resources to 450 # 000 users throughout the east county , Camarillo and Oxnard . &quot; We ' re in drought watch mode , but there ' s probably adequate storage this year to get_through to next year. &quot; The county actually fares better than much of Southern California , state officials said , in large part because of water stored in the North Las Posas Groundwater Basin by Calleguas and because water_levels at Lake Casitas are still high from last year ' s rains . However , water district officials cautioned that relying_on last year ' s heavy rains and resulting surplus -- snowpack was 150 % of average at this time last year -- is dangerous business . &quot; We have to be prudent , &quot; said Maurice Roos , a hydrologist with the state . &quot; We have to be aware that we ' re not sure what next winter is going_to bring . One more dry year could send us into drought. &quot; The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California , which delivers water it buys from the state to Calleguas , is asking customers to cut usage by 10 % . &quot; We know we have ample supplies of water for this year , but who knows what is going_to happen next year ? &quot; spokesman Bob Gomperz said . If winter rains have not begun by November , he said , the district may institute mandatory cutbacks . By the time the six-year drought ended last year , Gomperz said , most Southern Californians had learned to live with less water , installing conservation devices in showers , sinks and toilets . That awareness hasn ' t faded , he said , and , as a result , usage continues at lower-than-average levels . Kendall said Calleguas is relying_on several recent efforts it has made to &quot; drought-proof &quot; the region to ease the worries about a drought watch . Pumping the North Las Posas basin with water from state resources has given the district a backup if the state returns to full drought status , he said . That underground basin can store up_to 300 # 000 acre-feet , three times the amount consumed annually by the district ' s users . One acre-foot is enough to supply an average family with water for two years . The district also plans to conserve water with the opening of a new reclamation plant near Oak Park this summer , Kendall said . Treated sewage_system water from the plant will be used to irrigate parks , golf_courses and other greenbelt areas . Alan Jones , spokesman for the state_Department of Natural_Resources in Sacramento , said runoff from the Sacramento River watershed is expected to be half its average this year . &quot; that ' s what we call a critically dry year , &quot; Jones said . He said supplies at state reservoirs , now at about 90 % , will dissipate before the next rainy_season begins . &quot; By fall , we may be at a point where reservoir storage is so low that we ' ll consider ourselves in a drought , &quot; Jones said . According to the Ventura County Flood_Control District , rainfall for the county was about 70 % of normal this year . For the Casitas Municipal Water District , which relies solely on Lake Casitas to supply its 55 # 000 users in western Ventura and the Ojai Valley , this year ' s rain , coupled with last year ' s surplus , was enough to keep the reservoir 93 % full . &quot; No worries from us , &quot; said John Johnson , Casitas general_manager . &quot; We ' ve got enough to last six or seven years. &quot; The United Water_Conservation District , which replenishes ground-water basins in the Santa Clara River Valley and the Oxnard Plain , also reported respectable water_levels and plans no service_cutbacks . &quot; Lake Piru is at average inflow level for the year , and we ' ve got substantial carry-over from last year , so we ' re in fine shape , &quot; General_Manager Frederick Gientke said .
