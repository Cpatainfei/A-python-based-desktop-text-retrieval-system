   <TEXT> When the Lutheran AIDS Network heard that the National Episcopal AIDS Coalition was planning a four-day conference in Southern California in February , about the same time it had hoped to hold one , the organizations joined forces . The result of this interdenominational cooperation is &quot; Hope and Healing : The Church in the Second Decade of AIDS , &quot; which is expected to draw nearly 300 participants from several countries to Santa Monica beginning Thursday . According to the conference coordinator , the Rev . Thad Bennett , &quot; Hope and Healing &quot; is more_than an alliterative title . &quot; It is part of what the church can offer , &quot; he said , &quot; by looking_at the crisis from a spiritual point_of_view rather than simply a hard-core medical one. &quot; This is not to say , Bennett hastens to add , that AIDS education will be ignored at the conference . The Centers_for_Disease_Control are sending representatives to present the federal agency ' s new campaign promoting condoms . And Warren ( Buck ) Buckingham , an assistant to White_House AIDS Policy Coordinator Kristine M . Gebbie , will deliver a keynote_address . Nevertheless , Bennett , an Episcopal priest , adds : &quot; The questions we as a church ask go beyond ' Do we keep you alive or do you die ? ' They include : ' Is there spiritual healing in your life ? ' &quot; We know that if you are in a spiritually restful place , your physical healing is better . Part of spiritual restfulness is being in a proper relationship with God and your neighbor. &quot; Workshops are aimed at helping churches that want to start or expand AIDS ministries by teaching them about successful ones . &quot; Churches should know that they don ' t have to reinvent the wheel in_order to help their communities , &quot; Bennett said . Speakers include the Rev . Malcolm Boyd , an Episcopal priest , author and activist , and Olga Morales Aguirie , founder of the Mujeres ( Women with AIDS ) Project in San Antonio . Co-chairing the event are the Revs . William McCord Thigpen and Carmen Guerrero . Also in_attendance will be the Rt . Rev . Frederick Borsch , Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles , Yona Okoth , Anglican Archbishop of Uganda , and Bishops Robert Miller of the Pacifica Synod and J . Roger Anderson of the Southern California West Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran_Church in America . Asked the reason for his personal involvement in the AIDS conference , Bennett responded : &quot; The bottom_line for me , because I ' m a Christian , is that we are called to offer God ' s love in the midst of a crisis where so many are considered unlovable . &quot; What has happened for me , &quot; he said , &quot; is that I have learned more about the Gospel and God ' s love doing this work than I ever did_in the seminary. &quot; The conference will begin at 11:30 a.m. Thursday and run until the following Sunday morning at the Sheraton Miramar Hotel in Santa Monica .
