   <HEADLINE> THE AMAZINGLY SIMPLE , INEXPLICABLE THERAPY THAT JUST MIGHT WORK ; IS EMDR PSYCHOLOGY ' S MAGIC WAND OR JUST SOME HOCUS POCUS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The videotape I ' m watching is making me cry . The woman in it , in her 60s and neatly dressed , speaks in a self-possessed manner and without self-pity , despite the nasal-gastric tube that runs from her nose to her stomach . She ' s talking with Colorado Springs psychologist Robert Tinker , a sympathetic off-screen presence . Found to have oral cancer two years ago , Mary Sarner is a nurse and has no illusions about her prognosis . that ' s not what ' s upsetting her at the moment , however . Seven months ago , when her cancer flared_up again , her husband , Charlie , left her , telling her , &quot; I can ' t watch you die anymore. &quot; Sick and despairing , Sarner planned to kill herself . A friend intervened and talked Charlie into returning home . But now Sarner is facing the prospect of new surgery . Terrified that Charlie will leave again , she ' s feeling desperately hurt and alone . Tinker speaks_up then , describing a new psychotherapeutic procedure -- known by the bulky name of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing -- he plans to try . It was developed , he says , as a treatment for trauma and may work because it &quot; ties_in with REM ( rapid eye movement ) sleep , a time when we process the day ' s emotions. &quot; Some events are so painful , &quot; they overwhelm REM ' s ability to process the emotions. &quot; This therapy may be effective , he explains , because it ' s an intensified form of REM . He asks Sarner to visualize the moment when Charlie left and to recall the accompanying negative thoughts and feelings ( &quot; I ' m nothing , I ' m no good -- pain , lonesomeness , terrible hurt &quot; ) . Then , holding his fingers about 18 inches from her face , Tinker begins moving them back and forth in windshield-wiper fashion . Sarner ' s eyes track the movement , as if observing a Ping-Pong game . On the first go-round , which lasts less than a minute , nothing much happens . The second time , Sarner begins to sob . &quot; I don ' t want to watch anymore , &quot; she cries_out , as if seeing a vision beyond the moving fingers . Yet she keeps her eyes moving , until Tinker has her close them briefly and breathe deeply . &quot; What do you get ? &quot; he asks . &quot; I hurt from head to toe , &quot; she responds . Again he has her think_of Charlie ' s desertion , while his hand zigzags back and forth . This time , as she watches , her face changes . &quot; It ' s gone , &quot; she says when Tinker stops . &quot; It ' s just an old picture now . It ' s amazing . I don ' t have to hurt anymore . If Charlie wants to leave , it ' s his choice. &quot; She sits_up straighter , more relaxed . &quot; Oh gosh . I can do this , I ' m going_to be strong , &quot; she says . &quot; When I die , I ' m going_to die with dignity . If Charlie doesn ' t want to see it , that ' s OK. &quot; There are more rounds of hand movements . &quot; I want to go deep-sea fishing , start calling my friends . Charlie , I can have fun without you. &quot; I ' VE JUST SEEN A DEMONSTRATION , TAPED DURING THE COURSE OF A recent study , of what ' s probably the most controversial psychotherapy in_use today . In 1989 , the first articles about an improbable-sounding technique for treating post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) appeared in the psychological literature . PTSD , an anxiety_disorder with a multitude of mental and physical symptoms , strikes after an ordeal such_as rape , combat , child_abuse or natural disaster and can permanently scar a psyche . But with little more_than a wave of the hand , it seemed , Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ( EMDR ) could undo trauma ' s tormenting effects in a remarkably short time , sometimes in a single session . The procedure , originated by psychologist Francine Shapiro , then a California graduate_student , is fairly straightforward . A patient focuses_on the traumatic memory , then follows the back-and-forth movement of a therapist ' s fingers . That may lead to a new , related image , which the patient will focus_on during another set of eye movements . Vivid memories often surface and many patients feel as if they ' re reliving the original , devastating event . As thick and fast as images arise during the course of what ' s usually a 90-minute session , they ' re &quot; processed &quot; with the eye movements until a patient ' s painful feelings are replaced by happier ones . Word of EMDR rippled quickly through the psychological community . In some Veterans Administration clinics , the procedure reportedly helped turn things around for Vietnam vets who ' d once been impossible to help . Psychologists use it to treat survivors of Florida ' s Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and those who couldn ' t function well after the Northridge earthquake this year . Proponents say thousands have benefited from EMDR . &quot; It ' s like vacuuming , it sucks all_the anxiety out and it ' s done , &quot; says a Hughes Aircraft staff engineer who left town after the January quake . Working on her doctoral dissertation at the time , she was afraid to return until , by chance , she hooked_up_with a therapist who practiced EMDR . Although not widely known outside mental-health circles , EMDR is apparently headed for the mainstream . About 7 # 000 therapists in several countries , including nearly 2 # 500 in California , have been trained in the procedure , and many are testing EMDR to treat ills ranging from schizophrenia to eating disorders . &quot; I ' m committed to establishing this as a valid treatment , &quot; says Yale psychiatrist Dr. Steve Lazrove . &quot; I ' ve seen it work with people who , well , I don ' t know how I ' d do_it if we didn ' t have EMDR . We ' d probably spend years . This way , we just blow through and go on. &quot; Yet even as EMDR spreads so rapidly , there ' s little hard evidence that it works any better than existing psychotherapies . &quot; A long list of treatments come and go_in psychology , &quot; says Harvard psychiatrist Dr. Roger Pitman , who coordinates research and development at the VA Medical_Center in Manchester , N.H. &quot; Transactional analysis . Primal scream . I ' m OK , you ' re OK . There are a lot of fads and only time can tell which will hold up. &quot; Not surprisingly , EMDR is splitting the psychological community into warring camps . Some question the zeal with which it ' s being promoted and marketed by Shapiro -- in two-day training seminars around the country -- before its efficacy is proved . &quot; It ' s kind of scary that EMDR is getting so_much exposure when the people involved in marketing it don ' t have the research to substantiate it , &quot; says psychologist Susan Solomon , who heads the violence and traumatic stress research branch at the National Institute of Mental Health in Maryland . &quot; Trying things is not uncommon , but talking_about them as if it ' s established that they work is different . This is a major business and it ' s caught_on in a big way. &quot; But most psychotherapies don ' t come_backed with proven track records . And EMDR advocates in the trenches are disinclined to wait until all_the data is in . &quot; This is the most helpful technique I ' ve ever used for dealing with trauma , &quot; says Tinker . &quot; If therapists have used a variety of approaches and suddenly come_on one which provides outcomes that go way beyond what they ' ve obtained before , they ' re not likely to take the stance ' I won ' t use this until hard evidence appears in the literature. ' Their experience is the hard evidence they need. &quot; FRANCINE SHAPIRO WAS 39 AND UNKNOWN TO THE PSYCHOLOGY world when she developed EMDR . At the time , she was about to start her doctoral dissertation at the Professional School for Psychological Studies , a non-accredited San Diego university that closed three years ago . It was a spring day in 1987 , and Shapiro was strolling in a park in Los Gatos , outside San Jose . She was musing about something troubling , though she no longer recalls what . Suddenly , she says , &quot; I noticed those thoughts were disappearing . When I brought them back , they didn ' t have the same charge . I thought , ' What am I doing ? What ' s causing them to disappear ? ' I had no idea . So I said , ' Let me just pay attention. ' And I found that when that kind of thought went_through my mind , my eyes started moving rapidly and the thought shifted from consciousness . So then I did_it deliberately . I brought_up something upsetting and did the eye movements . And the same thing happened. &quot; The effect intrigued her , and she began to investigate further . Shapiro is recounting this story at a natural-food stand not far from her home , about 30 minutes south of San Francisco . She ' s taken a break from finishing an EMDR textbook she ' s writing that ' s to be published this year . An intense woman little given to small_talk , Shapiro radiates a missionary zeal about spreading the news of her discovery and is impatient with debates over its merit . &quot; What we ' re doing is extremely important , &quot; she says . &quot; A lot of people are suffering . Unless we keep our eye on the suffering , it ' s all politics. &quot; New York chutzpah , Shapiro has said , fuels her persistent campaign to bring EMDR to the world ' s attention . She grew_up in Brooklyn , the daughter of an auto mechanic and a housewife . At 30 , she was married and teaching English in the New York City public_schools while working_on a literature doctorate . Then she was found to have cancer ( she prefers not to discuss what kind ) . Though cured of the illness in 1978 , she learned all she could about the mind ' s role in promoting sickness or health . &quot; The message coming_through to me was that cancer was a stress disease , &quot; she says . &quot; I shifted my attention from literature to what would have an effect on stress and ended_up in psychology. &quot; A year later , Shapiro left New York and her marriage for the New Age mecca of the West . In California , she began exploring meditation , hypnosis and other non-traditional therapies . &quot; I took every alternative workshop I could find , &quot; she says . &quot; My question was , ' What works , and how can I get_it out_to people ? ' &quot; She returned to school for her psychology degree -- &quot; and then I took a walk in the park. &quot; Once she ' d made the observation about eye movements , Shapiro began buttonholing acquaintances to test it . Results were successful enough that she started a study that became her dissertation . The 22 Mendocino County volunteers were Vietnam vets or victims of rape or sexual abuse who suffered symptoms of post-traumatic stress : nightmares , flashbacks or so-called intrusive thoughts . Shapiro found that after she gave them a single EMDR session , the volunteers ' anxiety levels dropped , their symptoms diminished and positive thoughts about themselves increased . Shapiro termed her therapy &quot; eye movement desensitization , &quot; acknowledging her debt to the behavior_therapy known as systematic desensitization . Behavior_therapies work_on the premise that self-defeating patterns of action are learned and can be unlearned . Systematic desensitization , developed in the 1950s by eminent behavorial therapist Dr. Joseph Wolpe , helps people overcome anxieties or phobias by teaching them deep-muscle relaxation techniques . Then they are incrementally exposed -- through imagery and real-life confrontation -- to the object or event that they fear . In essence , Shapiro was substituting eye movements for relaxation as she tried to desensitize subjects_to past pain . In 1988 , Shapiro approached Wolpe with her findings . &quot; She told me she had a remarkable new treatment , &quot; says Wolpe , now a psychology and psychiatry professor at Pepperdine University . &quot; I was skeptical , but decided to try it out . It was effective in some minor context and that encouraged me to continue. &quot; What he saw made him a believer . &quot; There are certain cases where eye movement desensitization is dramatically rapid , cases that , as far as I know , are unparalleled , &quot; he says . &quot; I published one study of a woman who had been traumatized by a rape nine years ago . She had not improved at all with other therapy . With this , she was virtually cured after seven sessions . It was striking. &quot; Wolpe ' s stamp of approval gave EMDR a certain psychotherapeutic cachet while Shapiro continued to present her findings to researchers at universities and VA centers across the country . In 1989 , she accepted a position at the Mental Research Institute , a training and research facility for therapists in Palo Alto , where she ' s now a senior research fellow . She refined EMDR , splicing in bits and pieces from other therapeutic traditions such_as cognitive therapy or relaxation techniques . She changed her concept of the therapy from a behavioral model to one that was neurophysiologically based . The eye movements , she proposed , stimulated &quot; an inherent information processing system that we all have that ' s geared to take dysfunctional information and to work it through to an adaptive resolution. &quot; What had started as EMD became EMDR , to reflect Shapiro ' s feeling that the eye movements were helping patients &quot; reprocess &quot; old pain into something positive . In 1990 , Shapiro began offering training seminars for licensed mental-health clinicians . As a speaker , Shapiro is compelling : funny , personable , never at_a_loss for words . And the vision she presents is alluring . For those frustrated at the slow , backsliding process of helping an individual achieve change , she offers the possibility of rapid metamorphosis -- as fast as one to four sessions of treatment . In place of the hit-or-miss style of talk therapy many therapists practice , she offers an eight-stage formulaic method that has the potential to help a therapist plunge straight to the depths of a patient ' s pain and exorcise it . Her message found eager listeners . &quot; There ' s a growing recognition among mental-health professionals that many patients who come_into our offices have been subjected_to violence or abuse , &quot; says Terence M . Keane , director of the National Center for PTSD at the Boston VA Medical_Center . &quot; There ' s a desperate need to help them , but few techniques exist in the literature . EMDR filled a terrible vacuum. &quot; Shapiro , now married to a virtual_reality specialist at NASA , travels 25 to 30 weeks a year giving EMDR-related talks and trainings . But her enthusiastic marketing of the therapy has increasingly drawn unfriendly fire both in and outside the psychological community : A recent Newsweek article stopped just short of dubbing her a latter-day snake_oil salesman . At $ 315 a session , the cost of the training is hardly astronomical , but Shapiro has been criticized because she has participants sign a statement saying they won ' t teach EMDR to anyone else , in_effect giving her proprietary interest in the treatment . Shapiro has reported she pays herself no more_than $ 125 # 000 a year , plowing the rest of the profits back into research or financial help for clinicians with ill or indigent populations . And she maintains that EMDR is too potent to be used by those without experience . &quot; If EMDR went hog wild and was in the hands of every lay hypnotist and chiropractor . . . . I felt the responsible thing to do was keep it safe , until it is taught in universities. &quot; Shapiro also has been accused of adopting the role of guru ministering to a devoted flock . Such criticisms are largely based on the unquestioning acceptance with which some therapists practice EMDR . &quot; It ' s almost like a mass following that has perhaps a cultish nature to it , &quot; says Dr. Barbara Rothbaum , a PTSD expert and assistant psychiatry professor at Emory Medical_School in Georgia . &quot; That aspect turns a lot of people off , me included. &quot; University of Arkansas psychology professor Jeffrey Lohr agrees : &quot; A lot of undertrained , scientifically uncritical practitioners are viewing this as a kind of magic_bullet , one size fits all . They ' re making extravagant claims about the power and pervasiveness of the technique. &quot; In reporting this story , I did notice the therapy generated peculiar feelings of intensity . At one point , I walked into the office of an EMDR practitioner and found him waiting for me agitatedly . &quot; I ' ve been talking with some of the people you ' ve talked to so far , &quot; he told me , &quot; and we ' re not sure how well you understand EMDR &quot; -- leaving me with the uncomfortable sensation that my every move was being observed by a network of vigilant therapists . &quot; This is a gift from God , &quot; one of them told me sincerely . &quot; I feel honored to be part of this work. &quot; ELEVEN YEARS AGO , 33-YEAR-OLD ROGER THURSTON WAS WELDING IN the shaft of a silver_mine on the Utah / Nevada border when the gaseous air below him ignited , engulfing him in flames . He lost both arms and his hearing , and after two years of hospitalization , needed 24-hour nursing_care . During the next six years , he was plagued by flashbacks , nightmares and an inability to concentrate . By the time he consulted Salt_Lake_City psychiatrist Dr. David McCann , Thurston was desperate . McCann asked whether he wanted to try a new PTSD treatment -- one he had never used before and only read about . As they went_through the EMDR procedure , Thurston clearly recalled the clang of his wrench hitting the rocks , shouts from his co-workers . He saw the fire around him . As he continued tracking McCann ' s finger , the images gave_way to a flooding sensation of peace . Free_of nightmares or flashbacks , Thurston has weaned himself from nursing_care , taught himself to drive and joined the board of a nonprofit group helping children who need prosthetic limbs . Dramatic as such accounts are , and there are many , they count for relatively little in the scientific world . Hundreds of patients and clinicians may report miraculous changes because of a new therapy , but that doesn ' t prove that the treatment is effective . Patients could be experiencing a placebo effect , particularly common with a novel therapy like EMDR . &quot; There ' s something a little flashy about it , &quot; says Harvard psychiatrist Pitman . &quot; You tell a subject , ' This is a hot new treatment , with a physiological component , ' and you create a set of expectancies. &quot; Most scientists , then , make their judgments based on research studies . For such a new technique , there ' s been a surprising amount of research on EMDR . Unfortunately , much of it is composed of case studies , the scientific equivalent of anecdotal evidence . There are now , however , a number of controlled studies of EMDR , done_by researchers around the country , in which one group of subjects receives the treatment while one or more other groups get no therapy and / or a different treatment . These studies , Shapiro asserts , have established EMDR ' s efficacy beyond_doubt . &quot; Seven controlled studies of EMDR ! What more do people want ? &quot; she fumes . In fact , there are 10 , some published and some not . But many researchers believe that most of them are preliminary or flawed . The best-designed had the least positive results , with a majority finding EMDR either ineffective or no more potent than therapy performed without eye movement . The study in which Mary Sarner participated has stirred much excitement in the EMDR community because results are so encouraging . Details , however , are embargoed until its presentation next week at the American Psychological Assn . meeting in Los Angeles . Right now , it would be easy to conclude that , on balance , EMDR is more sound and fury than substance , yet even those whose studies have produced less-than-stellar results are reluctant to discount the therapy . Clinical psychologist Rick Lytle researched it as a Penn State University graduate_student under the supervision of anxiety_disorders expert Thomas Borkovec . Lytle found it essentially no better than two alternative therapies at alleviating anxiety symptoms . Even so , he says , &quot; I ' m unwilling to throw_away EMDR , from the point_of_view of a researcher . I can ' t account_for the relatively dramatic results some people claim they ' re getting , and I think it deserves further study. &quot; And other studies are continuing . Emory University ' s Rothbaum is looking_at EMDR as a therapy for rape victims . &quot; I feel_like when I present this research , I want to wear a big button that says , ' I am not a cult member , ' &quot; she says . &quot; But it definitely looks_to me like there ' s something there . Even several months after treatment , people are saying , ' It changed my life. ' &quot; SHOULD OUTCOMES BE MORE SALUTARY IN THE NEXT ROUND OF RESEARCH , one more question about EMDR will remain . Is this a technique that ' s telling us something new about how the brain functions ? Or is it a variation on an already familiar theme ? Several times a night , we enter a sleep stage when our head fills with dreams , and our eyes flick quickly back and forth . This , of course , is REM_sleep . No one knows what the significance of REM is , though scientists increasingly suspect that it ' s a time when the brain sifts through and stores learned material . The theory of the EMDR-REM connection thus makes a substantial leap in presuming that eye movements in sleep actively trigger a memory processing function , and further , that EMDR can activate that function as well . Yet it ' s not entirely implausible . Jonathan Winson , a neuroscientist at Rockefeller University in New York City , has conducted groundbreaking memory and sleep research . &quot; I was skeptical , very skeptical , &quot; he says about whether there might be something to the idea EMDR was related to REM . Nevertheless , he attended two trainings . &quot; What I saw there and what I ' ve seen since makes me believe there ' s sufficient effect to warrant further investigation , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s provocative to think there might be a relationship between EMDR and REM_sleep . But the bottom_line is , there ' s no definitive evidence. &quot; Shapiro also goes beyond the REM conjecture , offering a larger model of what happens when the brain is confronted with a disturbing experience . &quot; When a trauma occurs , perceptions that are there at the time of the event are brought_in , basically locked_in the nervous_system and held there , unable to process through , &quot; she says . &quot; We ' re suggesting that perhaps the eye movement may be a body mechanism for catalyzing the inherent information-processing system that we all have , in an accelerated manner . The trauma is metabolized , digested , whatever , in a_couple_of 90-minute sessions. &quot; The issue of how traumatic memories are stored is , if anything , more inflammatory than EMDR itself , touching as it does on the question of whether shocking memories can be repressed from consciousness . In her professional talks , Shapiro is careful to tell audiences the theory is &quot; written_on rubber . There ' s not enough known about brain physiology to actually know whether it ' s true or not. &quot; Nonetheless , because so_much of her language is based on this model , listeners might be forgiven for ignoring the caveat . Despite her REM hypothesis , Shapiro confusingly also proposes that eye movements aren ' t the only means by which to do EMDR . Therapists , she says , also have success using alternate taps on the back of a patient ' s hands or tones sounded alternately in each ear : &quot; Eye movement is the first thing I discovered , but it ' s not the only thing , &quot; she says . &quot; Something other_than that may be able to stimulate the information processing system. &quot; Or another factor could be at_work in successful EMDR cases . Some researchers feel EMDR is the latest comer in the group of behavior_therapies known as exposure therapies , which traditionally have been used to treat anxiety_disorders , including phobias and PTSD . Exposure therapy has patients confront , in a safe setting , the thing causing them pain or fear . A patient is asked to imagine a traumatic situation -- a disturbing memory of combat , say -- and stay with the feelings that arise until the anxiety diminishes . &quot; It can be traumatic , &quot; says Dr. Patrick Boudewyns , chief of pyschology at the VA Medical_Center in Augusta , Ga . &quot; Patients don ' t want to do_it ; they get very emotional. &quot; EMDR also starts by asking patients to conjure a painful recollection . But the eye movements might serve as a diversion of sorts , allowing patients to keep anxiety at a manageable level . &quot; It ' s something like desensitization , with a cute little device to distract a person from shifting his attention away , &quot; suggests Penn State ' s Borkovec . &quot; It ' s as if I was afraid of snakes , and you ' re trying to get me to approach one . As I do that , you ' re shooting off beautiful fireworks around me . So I keep my eyes open , and maybe some of the exposure to the snake is getting in. &quot; Adds Boudewyns : &quot; I think EMDR is a better way to do what we ' ve already been doing , and if that ' s all it is -- that ' s enough , that ' s good. &quot; But studies have yet to prove that the movements add something to the overall procedure . Seven of the 10 controlled studies included a so-called component analysis : one group of subjects had EMDR , while another group went_through the procedure , keeping their eyes fixed at the point where they ' d normally move them . In four studies , those who got EMDR improved no more_than those in the eyes-fixed group . That , points_out Lohr of the University of Arkansas , could be because most studies have been small , lacking statistical power . &quot; The mean is a fiction , &quot; he says . &quot; Some people in the studies change not at all , others a great_deal . I ' ve seen this treatment work wonders for some people . We need to go_back and identify those who did change and say , ' What distinguishes them ? ' &quot; SPEND ENOUGH TIME HEARING about a new therapy with miraculous curative powers and you ' ll inevitably grow curious . Twice , I tried EMDR . I had no horrendous traumas to work_on , but since therapists at the trainings go_through it , it seemed reasonable to expect I could get something out of it , too . In New York , I focused_on the memory of an old_school failure that I ' ve thought might still have ramifications in my life , and in California , on something upsetting that had just happened in a personal_relationship . I ' d been warned by EMDR folks to approach the therapy carefully , lest repressed material suddenly burst_forth and traumatize me . Instead , the process remained a fairly intellectual one . No lurking memories or vivid images surfaced . I had no cathartic gush . True , the conditions under which I tried EMDR would never pass muster_in a clinical trial . I felt decidedly awkward at dropping my journalistic guard with people I ' d just interviewed . In each case , I tried only a session of treatment , barely time enough for me to get_the_hang of EMDR . I would n ' t dismiss EMDR on the basis of my own experiences , but I can testify it ' s not something that works automatically . Indeed , most therapists I spoke with , Shapiro included , assured me that they don ' t regard EMDR as a panacea . But there seem to be few ills that proponents aren ' t prepared to address . EMDR is currently being applied in child_psychology , to multiple_personality disorders , obsessive-compulsive disorders and even to stimulating &quot; peak performance. &quot; &quot; It ' s being promoted as a breakthrough for virtually every form of psychopathology out there , when there are already established therapies to treat a lot of those conditions , &quot; asserts Dr. Kim Mueser , associate psychiatry professor at Dartmouth Medical_School . &quot; Those should be the first choice , treatments with a track record. &quot; Yet many untested therapies are being used on patients today . For instance , Wolpe points_out , &quot; Psychoanalysis has been the thing for 70 years , but no one cares about the lack of demonstrated efficacy of that . People just go_on doing_it , even though it has not been shown to have any notable efficacy. &quot; Many therapists working in the area of post-traumatic stress believe Shapiro ' s efforts will ultimately give the field a needed prod . &quot; Francine gets criticized for taking this to the clinical level before the research is done , but I don ' t think it ' s all that bad , &quot; says Boudewyns . &quot; It gets people to thinking_about it and kind of pushes the scientists along . God knows , we need better treatment for trauma and anxiety-related problems . This is a non-drug , it has virtually no side-effects . How much better could you get ? &quot; Ideally , EMDR would be further tested in studies comparing it to the best therapies available for the specific condition being treated . Until then , there is only the testimony of those who ' ve benefited from EMDR . Months after she went_through her first session , Mary Sarner has had additional cancer surgery that left her unable to speak . But she and her husband have drawn closer and are going_through the ordeal together . Sarner continues to use the therapy and is urging other cancer patients she knows to try it , too . Without EMDR , Sarner says unequivocally , she would never have tried to keep going . With it , she knows she still has something to live for .</TEXT>
