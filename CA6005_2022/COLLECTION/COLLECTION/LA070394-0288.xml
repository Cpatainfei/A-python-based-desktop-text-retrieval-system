   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 ROUND OF 16 ; SPOTLIGHT ; SWISS FOR A DAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Swiss fans Kelly Kubisiak and Darrly Chesley from Virginia won smiles wherever they went at RFK Stadium on Saturday.Kubisiak was the one wearing the 4-foot-long hat that looked_like a large piece of well-known yellow cheese . Chesley ' s had the red knife with its trademark gray cross . &quot; We thought_of hats with chocolate , a cow and a dollar_bill . And we actually tried one that looked_like a watch -- but it was slow , &quot; Chesley said . Neither man has spent time in Switzerland . &quot; The Swiss happen to be playing in the only game we could get tickets for , &quot; said Kubisiak , the hat maker . Construction time : &quot; about one case of beer. &quot; WILLIAM D . MONTALBANO</TEXT>
