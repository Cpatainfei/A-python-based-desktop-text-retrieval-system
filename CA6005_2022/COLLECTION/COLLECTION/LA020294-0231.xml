   <HEADLINE> WHITE_HOUSE UNVEILS PLAN TO FURTHER CLEAN U.S. WATERS ; ENVIRONMENT : PROPOSALS WOULD REWRITE AND EXPAND LANDMARK 1972 FEDERAL ACT . CUTTING FLOW OF REMAINING TOXICS IS TERMED ' THE HARD PART. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration , grappling with what it called &quot; the hard part &quot; of water_pollution control , on Tuesday unveiled a series of initiatives designed to improve the quality of the nation ' s waterways . In its broadest terms , the plan would streamline regulations , increase federal funds available to towns and cities and reduce the use of some toxic pollutants , such_as chlorine , by American industry . The package of proposals , which must be weighed by what appears to be a largely receptive Congress , would extend the life -- and the reach -- of the 1972 Clean Water Act , a landmark piece of environmental legislation that has dramatically cut the flow of industrial waste and toxins into American waters . Carol Browner , administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency , called that &quot; the easy part. &quot; But with 38 % of the country ' s lakes , rivers and estuaries still too polluted for swimming or drinking , the Administration has designed a plan to attack still-unregulated sources of pollution . Those include agricultural runoff and municipal waste-water facilities that spill raw sewage into lakes and rivers when rain or melting snow cause them to overflow . The plan would cost Americans roughly $ 70 billion a year to implement , an increase of roughly $ 6 billion over current spending by towns , cities and businesses on water_pollution control . But Administration officials insisted that Americans will save if the package is adopted by Congress : Browner said that the changes would cost Americans $ 30 billion less to implement than would the law in its current form . At stake in the debate is the health of rivers , lakes , estuaries and wetlands throughout the nation . Roughly 1 # 300 bodies_of_water have become so polluted that state authorities have had to limit public consumption of fish and shellfish that live_in them . While 20 years of controls have stemmed the flow of toxic chemicals into the water by major industrial_enterprises , farmers and smaller industries continue to pour 740 million pounds of toxic chemicals into waterways and municipal sewers each year . Such pollution causes as_many as 3.2 million cases of intestinal disease yearly and is widely believed to contribute to cancer , nervous_disorders and birth_defects , officials said . Citing the potential for these more serious effects , the Administration asked Congress on Tuesday to approve a federal study that would recommend whether and how to substitute , reduce or prohibit the use of chlorine in the United States . Chlorine and related compounds , which are used at lower levels to clean water , are thought to lead to the creation of dioxin , which has been linked to birth_defects and cancer . Environmental groups and several key lawmakers hailed the Administration ' s proposal . But environmental groups expressed concern that the government ' s willingness to give states new latitude in enforcing anti-pollution measures might allow some polluters to escape censure . Rep . Gerry E . Studds ( D-Mass. ) , chairman of a House committee that will help draft a new Clean Water Act , also warned that existing federal funds will not be enough to pay_for communities to improve their water facilities . Studds gave the Administration what he called a &quot; friendly nudge &quot; to adopt a proposal under which the federal_government would raise $ 4 billion in new environmental taxes on commercial and industrial water users and the makers of pesticides , fertilizers and animal feed . To reduce the diffuse sources of pollution such_as agricultural runoff and storm overflow , the new legislative proposal would give states almost eight years to implement pollution controls to reduce farm runoff . The proposal also would make federal money available to states to fund activities designed to reduce pollutants from fields and storm drains . While such aid has been provided in the past , the federal_government has placed strict limits on the types of projects that can be undertaken with the money . But under the Clinton plan , states also would be given new latitude in parceling_out federal funds to communities . For the first time , for instance , the funds could be used to create wetlands , to promote water_conservation or to experiment with agricultural programs that use fewer toxic pesticides . In an effort to step_up enforcement of anti-pollution laws , the Administration also will ask Congress to make federal facilities such_as Energy and Defense_Department installations subject_to all Clean Water Act provisions and to allow citizens to sue the government for violations . Under another proposal , citizens would be permitted , within five years , to sue water polluters for past violations even if the polluter had come_into compliance . A recent Supreme Court decision had severely curtailed citizens ' right to sue under such circumstances .</TEXT>
