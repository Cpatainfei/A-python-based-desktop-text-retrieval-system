   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN ENDS OFFICIAL SNUB OF NIXON , AIDES SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a face-saving finale to an embarrassing diplomatic tiff , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin on Saturday declared that Moscow would no longer give an official cold_shoulder to former U.S. President Richard Nixon , aides said . Yeltsin himself will not receive Nixon because of the recent death of Yeltsin ' s mother-in-law , who was buried Saturday , the aides said . But government officials who had been under orders not to see Nixon will now be allowed to do so . A Nixon adviser , Dmitri Simes , said a high-ranking Yeltsin aide had called_on Nixon on Saturday to say that &quot; President Yeltsin considered the incident of the past week to be closed. &quot; Simes said the 63-year-old Russian president is now urging government officials and members_of_Parliament to meet with the 81-year-old American . Although Yeltsin ' s conciliatory step stopped far short of an apology , it was aimed at smoothing over a public snub of Nixon , who was one of Yeltsin ' s earliest and most loyal supporters . It may also have been designed to soothe one of Yeltsin ' s oldest friends , national security adviser Oleg Lobov , who had officially invited Nixon to visit and then found himself embroiled in a diplomatic disaster . Nixon ' s office released a statement saying Yeltsin had received messages from President Clinton and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas , asking the Russian president to reconsider . Nixon arrived in Moscow last Sunday having made_it clear , both to the U.S. and Russian governments , that he was_on a private fact-finding mission and intended to hold meetings with Russian opposition leaders -- including Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky . The neo-fascist leader had been shunned by Clinton and Vice_President Al Gore on recent visits to Moscow . Clinton said he gave Nixon a green_light to meet with anyone he liked and that he requested a report on the Russian political scene when Nixon returned home . A meeting with Yeltsin had originally been scheduled for the beginning of Nixon ' s visit , Simes said . But when Yeltsin ' s aides switched the meeting to the end of Nixon ' s 10-day visit , Nixon proceeded to meet with opposition leaders . This was a violation of protocol in Russia , where one is expected to pay one ' s respects_to senior officials before venturing further . Most egregious , Nixon met Monday with Yeltsin ' s archenemy , Alexander V . Rutskoi , who was released just two weeks ago from Lefortovo Prison , where he had been held after leading last October ' s armed rebellion against Yeltsin . Furious , Yeltsin appeared on television Wednesday to say that neither he nor any member of his government would receive Nixon . &quot; Russia is still a great country , and you cannot just play with it like that , &quot; Yeltsin said . Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin promptly canceled his meeting with Nixon , and economist Yegor T . Gaidar , head of the Russia ' s Choice bloc in Parliament , began to waffle . At a reception Friday sparsely attended by Russian dignitaries , Nixon said he remained Yeltsin ' s friend and offered a toast to Clinton and Yeltsin as &quot; partners not just for peace but also for freedom. &quot;</TEXT>
