   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : PETITION SEEKS VOTE OVER RENT CONTROLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Supporters of an statewide initiative that would leave mobile_home rent controls up_to park owners instead of local and state_government turned_in nearly 600 # 000 signatures to place the item on the November ballot , organizers said Tuesday . More_than 15 # 000 of the initiative ' s supporters are from Ventura County , local elections officials said . Paul Kradin ) of Californians for Mobile_Home Fairness said hundreds of petitions were turned_in Monday to elections officials in each of the state ' s 58 counties . &quot; We feel confident that with the number of signatures collected , the initiative will qualify for the ballot , &quot; he said . If approved by voters , the mobile_home initiative would invalidate all existing state rent-control laws and prohibit new ones . More importantly for Ventura County mobile_home residents , the initiative would limit local rent subsidies -- which would be administered by park owners -- to no more_than 10 % of residents and allow_for annual rent increases equal_to the cost_of_living . Almost half of Ventura County ' s mobile_home park residents receive some form of rent subsidy , according to park owners . The initiative itself and the campaign by its supporters have drawn criticism from mobile_home park residents , who fear the park owners would eventually price them out of their homes . There are 105 mobile_home parks scattered across Ventura County , and more_than 10 # 000 coaches , according to the state division of codes and standards , which regulates mobile_homes . About 385 # 000 valid signatures of registered voters are needed for the initiative to qualify for the fall ballot . It will take several weeks for elections officials around the state to certify the signatures . JEFF McDONALD</TEXT>
