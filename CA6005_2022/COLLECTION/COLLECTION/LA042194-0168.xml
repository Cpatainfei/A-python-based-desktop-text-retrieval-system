   <HEADLINE> WOMAN AT CORE OF MYSTERY BURIED ; MEDICINE : GLORIA RAMIREZ IS LAID TO REST TWO MONTHS AFTER HER DEATH AT A RIVERSIDE HOSPITAL , WHERE FUMES FELLED PERSONNEL . HER CLERGYMAN SCOLDS THE COUNTY FOR ITS HANDLING OF THE CASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gloria Ramirez , who lived_in relative obscurity but in death became the focus of a sensational medical mystery that catapulted her to the front page and the top of the evening news , was finally laid_to_rest Wednesday . The comforting prayers , the cathartic tears and the symbolic release of balloons into the gray morning sky came two months after her death . Since Feb . 19 , her family ' s grief has been interwoven with anger and frustration . For weeks , they have been unable to gain information about the cause of death of the 31-year-old mother of two . For weeks , they listened to explanations that blamed Ramirez for the mystery fumes that felled six emergency_room attendants who tended to her the night she died at Riverside General Hospital . But at the funeral Wednesday and a memorial Tuesday night , the time had finally come for family and friends to say goodby . The Rev . Brian Taylor read from Paul ' s letter to the Corinthians to those gathered for the memorial Tuesday . He read from the 23rd Psalm and reflected on John ' s Gospel . He talked_of how Gloria Ramirez was a friend to all , quick to smile , a carefree joker who brought comfort and joy to others . And , even though medical authorities have not concluded how Ramirez died or whether she was the source of the mystery fumes , Taylor referred to &quot; that bizarre , tragic incident in the hospital emergency_room that took her life. &quot; The hospital , he maintained , &quot; is likely to blame for the toxic fumes that took her life. &quot; He scolded the county for not sharing results of its investigation into her death with the family and for the handling of her body -- which Riverside County officials did not release for burial until last weekend . County officials have called Ramirez ' s death the most baffling in local history and have said they will disclose their findings by the end of the month . A county spokesman has said the hospital is not believed to be the source of the fumes . Ramirez , who had been found to have cervical cancer six weeks earlier , was rushed to the hospital Feb . 19 complaining of breathing difficulties and nausea . As one doctor tried unsuccessfully to keep her alive as her body went_into cardiac distress , six other emergency_room attendants grew dizzy or collapsed after several complained that blood drawn from Ramirez into a syringe smelled foul . For an extraordinary autopsy a week later , pathologists wore protective suits and worked in a specially built room . Until last week , county officials had said her casket could not be opened unless similar precautions were taken . &quot; Gloria has not been treated right , her death was unjust and the treatment of her body has been unjust , &quot; Taylor said at the memorial service . &quot; The people responsible need to be held accountable for that. &quot; With that , the minister returned the service to more traditional lines . &quot; We can finally give Gloria the dignity of a proper funeral , &quot; he said . Ramirez ' s two children from a previous marriage , 12-year-old Evelyn Arciniega and 9-year-old Angel Arciniega Jr. , approached the podium with Ramirez ' s sister , Maggie Ramirez-Garcia , who read a poem written by Evelyn . &quot; Roses are red , violets are blue . . . . The next time I find a red rose , it will be just for you , &quot; she recited . &quot; When the stars shine , it will remind me of you. &quot; Sprays of flowers flanked the ivory-colored casket ; a small crucifix was placed atop it and a portrait of Ramirez positioned to the left of it . About 100 people , most of them relatives , attended Tuesday night ' s service . The family asked television_news crews to keep their cameras outside . On Wednesday , a 10-minute graveside service at Olive Wood Cemetery in Riverside completed what Taylor said was a necessary closure in the family ' s grieving process . As Taylor sang &quot; Amazing Grace , &quot; as_many as 10 television_news crews and other reporters and photographers kept their distance at the family ' s request . &quot; It ' s a song that Gloria would hum around the house a lot , &quot; he said later .</TEXT>
