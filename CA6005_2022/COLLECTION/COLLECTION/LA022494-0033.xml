   <HEADLINE> PRACTICAL VIEW : CHATTING THE HIGH-TECH WAY , ON THE WOMEN ' S WIRE ; ON-LINE : IN THIS NEW &quot; ELECTRONIC COMMUNITY , &quot; WOMEN USE CYBERSPACE TO EXCHANGE EXPERIENCES IN EVERYTHING FROM HOME REPAIRS TO MENOPAUSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ellen Pack and Nancy Rhine officially launched Women ' s Wire last month by inviting a large group of friends to chat with some guest experts . Travel writer Thalia Zepatos offered safety tips for women traveling alone . Computer_guru Esther Dyson predicted where the electronics_industry is headed . Greens Restaurant chef Annie Somerville answered questions about gourmet vegetarian cooking . Women from all_over the country participated -- but nobody had to leave home . The audience was connected by its modems to Women ' s Wire , the world ' s first on-line computer service aimed specifically at the needs and interests of women . &quot; We think it can become a very practical part of a woman ' s life , &quot; says Pack , 28 , a New Yorker with an MBA from Columbia University . &quot; It ' s just now becoming a tool that can save you time and money. &quot; &quot; It ' s not mysterious -- it ' s not going_to take the place of the telephone or personal conversation , &quot; says Rhine , 43 , a Midwesterner who has worked with computers since the 1970s . &quot; It ' s just a convenient way to reach individuals and groups that is becoming very valuable. &quot; Interviewed by phone from their office complex in San Francisco , Pack and Rhine discuss their plans for bringing women into the world called &quot; cyberspace. &quot; ( The current estimate , according to Online Access magazine , is that only 15 % to 20 % of all on-line systems users are women. ) Pack and Rhine envision subscribers turning_to Women ' s Wire for information on everything from health and finances to movie reviews , and also using its interactive capabilities to share experiences , find jobs , solve problems and just schmooze . &quot; Some women who have businesses at_home say it ' s their virtual water cooler , &quot; says Rhine . &quot; They can log_on and network . It really combats isolation. &quot; Women ' s Wire is the latest entry in the emerging world of commercial on-line services -- led by Prodigy and Compuserve -- that are not yet household words , but getting closer , as home computers become more affordable . &quot; The understanding is growing , &quot; says Pack , &quot; but there ' s still a gap -- the people who haven ' t used it just don ' t have any concept of what is involved. &quot; The process , she adds , is relatively simple -- all it takes is a personal_computer and a modem that connects your computer to a telephone_line to send information in and out . Through it you can dial a commercial computer_system that typically provides the following : * Read-only information such_as stock prices , weather and news . * Messaging forums to exchange ideas and information on topical issues in which users post messages for anyone who dials in . * Personal mailbox for exchanging private messages . Subscribers can also exchange electronic_mail ( E-mail ) with anyone who has an address on Internet ( a global computer_network ) or participate in Usenet groups with topics ranging from pet care to restaurants . * Interactive activities such_as the Women ' s Wire chat sessions in which audience and speakers engaged by typing and sending questions and answers electronically . Essentially , says Pack , this breaks_down into two basic types of communication : &quot; One is the pure information side . We buy data bases and have resource people putting them on-line . If a magazine did an excellent piece on breast_cancer and you want it six months later , it will be in the data base. &quot; But where women get the greatest value , she thinks , is in interaction . that ' s the feedback Pack and Rhine have been getting since October , when they opened Women ' s Wire to 300 founding subscribers for a three-month trial period . &quot; People are helping each other get_through all sorts of situations , &quot; says Pack . &quot; A woman recently signed onto the forum devoted to children and said her daughter had been diagnosed with severe learning disabilities and she didn ' t know how to cope . She heard from other mothers who suggested groups to work with , recommended special schools and told her how they had dealt with similar problems. &quot; Some have described this process as &quot; electronic consciousness-raising , &quot; but Pack likes to call it an &quot; electronic community , &quot; with women exchanging experience in everything from home repairs_to menopause . &quot; The amount of support you see on the network is incredible , &quot; she says . Although she ' s used a PC since college , Pack doesn ' t consider herself any sort of computer wizard . But when she moved to Palo Alto in 1992 as chief operating officer for a software company , she discovered the Well , a regional on-line system with about 10 # 000 members who network on everything from finding relationships to discussing the state of the world . Pack found the network helpful in getting acquainted with interesting people ( &quot; I even found a doctor on-line &quot; ) and also noticed that most of the users were men . So she posted a note on the Well about starting a women ' s computer_network and met Rhine . Rhine spent the 1970s at a Tennessee commune , where she helped computerize a data base for the Midwife ' s Assn . of North_America . Eventually she acquired a PC and moved to rural Northern California where she launched a word_processing business and began educating herself in software . &quot; The computer allowed me , as a single parent , to work and be available to my children at_the_same_time , &quot; says Rhine , the mother of two teen-agers . &quot; I ' ve always seen its value as a timesaver. &quot; When she later moved to the Bay Area , she got a job on the Well designing a customer support function and she was hooked . &quot; I could quickly see the power of the communications tool , &quot; she says . &quot; During the uprising in China ' s Tian An Men Square , there was a man on the Well whose son was in China and they were talking regularly . The son used to send reports of what was happening at that very moment . To me it was revolutionary -- a way to get_around governments and the limitations of the press. &quot; Like Pack , she is concerned because , although women are major workplace users of computers for data processing , they are being left_behind in the real communications revolution -- on-line networking . Their concern is shared by Judith Broadhurst , a New York writer who specializes in women and technology . &quot; I don ' t think women yet understand what on-line computing can do for them , &quot; says Broadhurst . &quot; I think they misperceive what it ' s all about . Men tend to be more curious about how computers work. &quot; For Pack and Rhine , the first goal was to create a system that would be user-friendly in all aspects . &quot; We didn ' t want it to be a technical challenge , &quot; says Pack . &quot; We tried to organize the information logically and simply . We are heavy on customer service and support . We take calls all_the time from people who don ' t have modems , but want to know what they are. &quot; &quot; It ' s a world at your fingertips , &quot; says Aliza Sherman , a New Yorker who subscribed_to Women ' s Wire in December . She had just switched careers -- from the music industry to a nonprofit group called the Domestic Abuse Awareness Project -- and was looking_for networking . She signs_on every day , calling_up everything from news headlines to Usenet discussions , she said . Her domestic abuse project , with its mission statement and most recent newsletter , is available in Women ' s Wire directory of organizations . &quot; One subscriber , who read about us wants to have lunch and may even fund us , &quot; Sherman says . With a current membership of about 500 , Women ' s Wire is a small player in a competitive game , but Pack and Rhine have high ambitions and think their focus gives them an edge . &quot; Our hope , &quot; says Pack , &quot; is that in five years Women ' s Wire will be a great global clearing_house for information that will focus_on communications and needs of women around the world. &quot;</TEXT>
