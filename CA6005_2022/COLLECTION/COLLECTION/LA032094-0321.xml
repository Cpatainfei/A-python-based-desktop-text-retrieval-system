   <HEADLINE> WAR-WEARY MUSLIMS , CROATS STRIVE TO BURY A BITTER PAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Perhaps , concedes an aide to the Croatian leadership on the west_bank of this divided city , local politicians were a bit &quot; overzealous &quot; in proclaiming their own state within Bosnia and driving_out their Muslim neighbors . &quot; Mistakes have been made by both sides , &quot; allows Tony Vucic , an Australian adviser to the self-styled Bosnian Croat presidency that proclaimed the rogue state of Herzeg-Bosna and took most of this once-integrated city for its capital . On the Muslim-held east bank , there is a stunning new willingness to forgive the majority of Croats , as long as the outside world does not forget those most guilty of bringing this centuries-old cosmopolitan society to segregation and ruin . &quot; It is my hope and belief that we will come_to a good understanding for all people involved , &quot; predicts Alija Alikadic , a member of Muslim-held east Mostar ' s war council , in a reference_to the peace talks that engendered a Muslim-Croat federation agreement signed Friday . &quot; We want a multicultural state , and the Croats , except for the extremists , also realize this is the only way . As long as a war_crimes tribunal punishes the most guilty , I ' m sure a cosmopolitan Mostar will survive. &quot; Although Croats and Muslims only a_few weeks ago were blasting each other with artillery and fanning the flames of hate , both now take_on the same aggrieved tones in contending they would never have been compelled to turn_on each other if the West had intervened to halt the Serbian aggression that tore the former Yugoslav federation apart . Like a reconciling couple eager to blame outsiders for their breakup so each can forgive the other , the Croats and Muslims of central Bosnia are so desperate for a return to peace that they are accepting without question the 180-degree turn_in the propaganda course executed in recent days by their respective political_leaders . The suddenly softened rhetoric from both sides of the Neretva River that divides this once-scenic city has probably been the most powerful inducement to the brutalized and exhausted populations to believe their war may really be over , their heartaches on the mend . &quot; We Balkan peoples are like livestock , &quot; a 50-year-old Croatian woman says in self-derision . &quot; Whichever way our leaders push us , that ' s where we go. &quot; The succession of wars that have ravaged the former Yugoslav republics since 1991 were largely spurred by propaganda and official manipulation of historic grievances . And it has long been expected that a change in thinking at the top would be the only means of bringing the violence to an end . How strongly the Croatian leadership in Zagreb and the Muslim-led Bosnian government in Sarajevo are committed to making their newly restored alliance work remains to be seen . But the groundswell toward peace has taken_on its own momentum now , as Muslim and Croatian civilians , equally sickened by a war neither side can win , are taking their leaders at their word and struggling to ensure an enduring reunion . U.N. troops from Spain , Malaysia , Britain and Canada are also scurrying to take_advantage of the current change of heart , corralling both sides ' heavy_weapons to guard against a resumption of artillery shelling in the event of some local flare-up along the circuitous and still-volatile front_line . &quot; We are optimistic about the prospects , &quot; says Jose Luis Gutierrez , spokesman for the U.N. Spanish battalion in nearby Medjugorje . He noted that not a single violation of the March 7 deadline for withdrawal of heavy_weapons has been discovered in this area , which until last week was one of the bloodiest ethnic fault_lines . &quot; There is a change in will on both sides that I think had to come from the top , &quot; says Kirsten Young , the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees ' security officer for the Mostar region . &quot; The two sides have been having discussions about all kinds of things , even about people evicted from west Mostar to east Mostar being able to go_back to the west_side for family visits. &quot; The change in the official message is most obvious among the designated mouthpieces : For most of the past year , they have publicly demonized the rival population . Now they assert with great sincerity that reconciliation and re-integration are the only paths to a secure future . &quot; It ' s going_to be very difficult , but it has to be that way , &quot; Bosnian Croat military spokesman Veso Vegar said when asked if he expected Muslims and Croats to rebuild Mostar without social walls and ethnic divisions . &quot; Time is the only cure for what has happened here . But there is a basic human instinct to push_out of consciousness what has been most painful. &quot; Distrust remains rampant , and there are signs that not everyone is so keen to simply relegate the past year of savagery to the status of a bad memory . &quot; We hope the cease-fire will stay in_effect , but after all_the destruction and all_the terrible things that have happened here , we can ' t be that optimistic or confident , &quot; says Alija Behram , director of an underground radio_station on the east_side . His station has kept the Muslim community ' s pain fresh with daily first-person accounts of atrocities committed by extremist Croats . Yet Behram concedes that the attitude discernible from Sarajevo is one of emphasizing the positive and helping people , through balanced media presentation , to come_to grips with their fears and resentments . &quot; I would like to say to everyone , ' Go_home , go_back where you belong. ' But how can I say that when I don ' t know if someone will shoot at them , or who would defend them , or what kind of reception they would get from the Croats on the other side ? &quot; says Behram , who lost his older sister to a Croatian mortar blast and has been holed_up with his wife , two daughters , younger sister and displaced parents in an apartment cellar shared with 16 other refugees . But the voices of naysayers and antagonists are being drowned out by the war-weary civilians who , though still suspicious of a peace proclaimed so suddenly , want nothing more_than a lasting rapprochement . Since the shelling that reduced east Mostar to rubble stopped a_few hours ahead of a March 7 U.N. deadline , life has returned to the streets and a daylight curfew has been lifted . Children who had spent months in dank , fetid cellars have turned the shattered landscape into new playgrounds , clambering over bullet-riddled cars and shell-toppled fountains and monuments . Lovers kiss and soak_up the early spring sunshine on park_benches , seemingly oblivious to the graves that have been tucked into the urban greenbelts for lack of space or access to cemeteries for the 1 # 300 of their neighbors killed over the past year . The more Mostar returns to normal -- or as much normalcy as can be salvaged from among the ruins -- the more fiercely civilians on both sides will resist any retreat to the ethnic bloodletting . &quot; Even though I ' ve lost everything , all that I worked for throughout 40 years , I can ' t hate anybody for what has happened , &quot; insists 59-year-old Alija Hadzajlic , a former military college professor who now teaches math and science to refugee children . &quot; There are thousands in Mostar who have suffered at least as much as I have , and we all have to realize that hatred is not the way. &quot; On the west_side , 19-year-old Croatian waitress Anna Maria Lovric observes it will be hard to ever again trust Muslims , who have been unquestionably blamed by state-run Croatian media for the Croat-Muslim rift . But she concedes Mostar cannot be divided without losing its soul . &quot; We have to find some way to live together again , &quot; she says , expressing perplexity over the eviction last summer of a Muslim friend and neighbor . The cessation of shelling and the reduction in small-arms fire to little more_than a_few stray shots each day has given both communities the confidence to dare to think they are heading into better days . &quot; There has been a calming on the field , and this will force the political process , &quot; says Albert Benabou , U.N. civil affairs officer for the region . &quot; This may be the turning point , although we should be careful not to jump to conclusions. &quot; The ultimate success of the Muslim-Croat reconciliation may depend_on moves that neither community can deliver , as their new federal alliance within Bosnia counts_on recovering considerable territory from the Bosnian Serbs . Serbian nationalist gunmen who instigated Bosnia ' s fighting by rising in arms against an April , 1992 , vote for independence have seized 70 % of the republic ' s territory and have staunchly resisted Western pressures to rejoin Muslims and Croats in a new federation or give_up some of the occupied land . If Muslims and Croats fail to wrest the areas they have been told by mediators are rightfully theirs , the frictions that drove them to fight each other for what was left of Bosnia could again break the alliance . But both sides , for now , are putting_out a message that there is reason to hope for a common future . The Bosnian Croat rebel leader , Mate Boban , was replaced on the advice of Zagreb with a more moderate figure , and Bosnia ' s Muslim president , Alija Izetbegovic , has been relegated to a figurehead position by the republic ' s dynamic prime_minister , Haris Silajdzic , who enjoys more domestic and international support . A U.S. diplomat helping to broker the confederation between Bosnia and Croatia said Boban and Izetbegovic carried too_much responsibility for the past year ' s fighting in the eyes of the other people and that their retreat to the background made_it possible for both sides to save face and push a more rational policy of reconciliation .
