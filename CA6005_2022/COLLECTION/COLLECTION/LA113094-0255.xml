   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; DRIVERS STUCK IN TRAFFIC CAN CALL IN FOR QUICKEST ROUTES AROUND TOWN ; MULTIMEDIA : SERVICES CAN BE ACCESSED BY CELLULAR PAGING , RADIO REPORTS OR THE INTERNET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Engineer Tom Peterson had one of his best ideas while stuck_in traffic . &quot; I was staring at my cellular_phone , and I remember thinking , ' Who can I call who ' d know the fastest way home ? ' &quot; said Peterson , then the manager of a shipping terminal . &quot; The only place I could think_of was Caltrans. &quot; Six years later , Peterson and his firm , Traffic Assist , are test-marketing a service that enables subscribers to punch_in a code and hear a computerized voice describe the quickest way to get_across town . He is one of a dozen or so Southern California entrepreneurs repackaging and selling Caltrans traffic information by way of cellular paging services , regionalized radio reports , telephone dispatch services and the Internet computer_network . These services are in many respects the precursors to the &quot; intelligent transportation_systems &quot; of the future , in which a variety of computer_technologies would vastly increase the efficiency of the highway_system by enabling cars to travel closer together and easily find alternate routes . While the high-tech highways of the future will have all manner of computerized sensors to monitor traffic flow and give instructions accordingly , today ' s traffic entrepreneurs have to settle for a more limited -- though still very valuable -- information source : a network of electronic sensors that Caltrans has in place along 480 miles of Southern California freeways in Los Angeles , Orange and San Diego counties . The sensors -- wire loops buried in the pavement -- generate electromagnetic fields that can judge the speed of vehicles traveling through them . They were first installed in 1971 to help engineers determine how frequently traffic meters should allow vehicles to enter the freeways from on-ramps . About three years ago , Caltrans began making the data gathered by the sensors available to radio_stations to supplement their traffic helicopter reports . That decision set_off an unexpected scramble for access to the information : 19 businesses have paid from $ 2 # 500 to $ 10 # 000 apiece for feeds from Caltrans computers in Downtown Los Angeles , and the last available connection was taken earlier this year . Gregory Damico , a senior transportation engineer in the agency ' s Los Angeles district office , said that , if the agency could meet all requests for access , &quot; we ' d have 300 new users overnight. &quot; That great demand has planners pondering just how readily available the agency ' s information should be : Knowledge of an undertraveled alternate route , after all , is only valuable if not too many people know about it . Given current freeway designs , only about 30 % of motorists would ideally be allowed to see the overall traffic picture , according to Hani Mahmassani , a University of Texas professor who has designed model traffic systems by computer . Above that level , he said , the cumulative effect of thousands of motorists detouring at once to avoid freeway jams could result in everybody being worse off . &quot; Information is a double-edged sword , &quot; Mahmassani said . &quot; Past a certain point , the individual decisions of each driver become counterproductive &quot; to the smooth flow of traffic . The view of Caltrans planners is that traffic data should eventually be coordinated with other systems , including rail networks , computerized signal_lights and other high-tech methods to smooth congestion . &quot; If you have all_the infrastructure , then the feeling is that everybody benefits &quot; from more information , said Patrick Conroy , a supervisory research engineer . &quot; that ' s the working assumption. &quot; But those seeking to capitalize on Southern Californians ' traffic frustrations aren ' t waiting for more infrastructure . Cue Network Corp . in Irvine , for instance , uses Caltrans data in conjunction with a system developed with map_maker Thomas Bros. , also in Irvine , to display real-time traffic conditions on computer_networks in offices . Cue Network said it plans to market the service to large corporations , who in turn could make_it available to employees as a way to check on traffic conditions before they leave work . Auto Talk , a Los Angeles company , offers subscribers radio traffic reports for specific geographic_areas . The company ' s device , which sells for $ 100 , attaches_to car radios and allows drivers to hear road condition reports from seven different regions of the metropolitan area . Another Los Angeles company , Qumpo Inc. , uses its feed to generate updated road reports every four minutes over pagers . It charges $ 25 a month for the service , which it calls Roadirector . And since June , a Southland freeway map has been available to Internet users with the Mosaic program , which simplifies access to photos , maps and other files that are difficult to download . A driver with a cellular modem and a powerful PC could display the map on the dashboard . * The map is maintained by S-Cubed , a research division of electronic components manufacturer Maxwell Labs Inc. in San Diego . &quot; I ' d always been frustrated with the inability to get the data to use , since I knew it was out there , &quot; said William Proffer , a senior research scientist at the company . When the company learned that Caltrans had no plans to make its map available on the Internet , Proffer said , employees decided to offer the map themselves as an advertising vehicle . Users who call_up the map can also view S-Cubed ' s catalogue of software , capacitors and other products . Proffer and other company executives maintain that their services will help to reduce freeway congestion until a more comprehensive traffic system can be built . &quot; I tend to think that the more information you have , the better , &quot; said Tom Luczak , owner and president of Paging Plus in Glendale , which is working_on software that would beam Caltrans information to motorists using digitized radio_signals . Reports on commercial radio_stations , Luczak said , will continue to benefit those who cannot afford or choose not to buy more advanced services . &quot; It ' s going_to come_down to what the consumer is willing to spend , &quot; he said . &quot; The vast majority are probably going_to be happy enough with traffic radio . I think it will be those heavy travelers who will go_with the extra $ 10 or $ 15 a month to learn more. &quot;</TEXT>
