   <HEADLINE> PEACE PACT AT LEAST A MONTH AWAY , RABIN WARNS ; MIDEAST : TEXT OF LATEST ISRAEL-PLO AGREEMENT SHOWS BOTH SIDES GAVE GROUND ON KEY ISSUES . ARAFAT FLIES TO JORDAN TO MEET WITH KING HUSSEIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli officials cautioned Thursday that a final agreement on Palestinian self-rule is at least a month away , as Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat flew to Jordan to begin bringing other Arabs aboard the evolving peace process . A day after the two sides initialed agreements on several of the key issues that have prevented the beginning of Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin predicted &quot; it will be at least another month , if not more , until we reach a full agreement , before we begin its realization. &quot; In the occupied Gaza Strip , there was a mood of tempered optimism as Palestinians , who have watched for months the ins and outs of the faltering peace negotiations , waited for some concrete results . &quot; Without a doubt , the Palestinians see this as a big step_forward . But in the meantime , this will not do anything for them . As long as the Israeli army patrols the streets and alleyways of the ( refugee ) camps in Gaza , as long as there are prisoners and wounded and roadblocks and unemployment , from the Palestinian perspective , nothing has changed , &quot; Suffian abu Zaida , a PLO activist in the Gaza Strip , told Israel ' s Army Radio . The response from hard-liners on both sides was quick . Near Gaza , Islamic militants claimed they had kidnaped and killed an Israeli police_officer , and authorities confirmed that in the area of the alleged attack they had found a bloodstained car belonging_to a former border police_officer . Israel ' s right_wing condemned the preliminary accord , which they described as a sellout to the Palestinians that will pave the way for more Israeli concessions . &quot; On the surface , it would seem that ( Israel ) has signed a treaty of surrender which does not even hint at security , &quot; said Rehavam Zeevi , head of the rightist Homeland Party . The text of the agreement made public Thursday indicates that both sides gave ground , though the Palestinians took the biggest bite of concessions by accepting Israeli control of Jewish settlements in Gaza , ultimate Israeli control of border crossings and limited control of religious and tourism sites outside of Jericho . On the other hand , Israel agreed to a Palestinian presence and the display of the Palestinian flag at international border terminals , agreed to end searches of incoming Palestinians in most cases and gave Palestinians a foothold in the lucrative tourist market on the Dead_Sea . The details of the pact have been downplayed , said one source close to the talks , &quot; maybe because this agreement could contain some concessions , and there needs to be a proper release of the information in_order not to provoke worries and harsh criticism. &quot; These are the major issues agreed on in the documents signed late Wednesday in Cairo : * Border terminals at entry points from Egypt and Jordan will be under the security supervision of Israel but will be divided into two wings . Residents of Gaza and Jericho will pass_through the Palestinian wing and not come_into contact with Israeli officials unless there is a need to search or question them . The Palestinian wing will include a Palestinian flag and a Palestinian armed_guard . Other residents of the West_Bank will be checked by both Palestinians and Israelis , and other travelers will pass_through the Israeli wing . Negotiators left the question of whether there will be a Palestinian police_officer on the border itself to be decided later by Arafat and Rabin when they meet . * In the Gaza Strip , the areas of the Gush Katif and Erez settlements , as well as the Israeli military_installation along the Egyptian border , will remain under Israeli authority , as will the east-west roads linking the Gaza Strip to Israel . Joint patrols on those roads will be headed by Israelis , and Israelis pursuing suspects in Gaza will hand_over to Palestinian officials as soon as practical . Joint patrols in Jericho will be headed by Palestinians . * In Jericho , in addition to the main area to be transferred to Palestinian self-rule , Palestinians are guaranteed safe passage to the religious sites of Nebi Mousa , revered by Muslims as Moses ' burial place , and Al Maghtas , thought to be the site of Jesus ' baptism . But instead of including those areas in the autonomy zone , the Palestinians will oversee them only for religious purposes . Palestinians also have the right of safe passage to private Palestinian development projects and joint_ventures on the Dead_Sea . Still not agreed upon , however , is the size of the Jericho zone eventually to be transferred to Palestinian control . Palestinians , who originally sought up_to 340 square kilometers ( 136 square_miles ) of the entire district around Jericho , have found themselves in grudging agreement in recent weeks with Israel ' s final offer of 55 square kilometers ( 22 square_miles ) . But sources said Arafat has reserved the right to bring_up the issue with Rabin again . In the points of agreement , the Palestinians &quot; have agreed to a functional approach where the Israelis would have authority and powers to exercise their security responsibilities , and at_the_same_time , it doesn ' t derogate from the fact that we ' re moving into a process where the Palestinians get more authority as you go_along , &quot; said one analyst familiar_with the agreement . Arafat , seeking to cool Jordanian concerns that the Palestinians have not adequately consulted with their Arab partners in the peace negotiations , arrived in Jordan on Thursday for a meeting with King Hussein . Times research assistants Dianna Cahn and Emily Hauser in Jerusalem contributed to this report .</TEXT>
