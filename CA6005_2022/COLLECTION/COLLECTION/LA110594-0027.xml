   <HEADLINE> STATE JOBLESS RATE PLUNGES TO 7.7 % ; ECONOMY : CALIFORNIA IS BUOYED BY BRIGHTER EMPLOYMENT PICTURE . SPEED , INTENSITY OF RECOVERY REMAIN UNCERTAIN . O.C. ' S 6 % SEPTEMBER STATISTIC IS MOST RECENT ONE AVAILABLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s slow-blooming economic recovery gained speed in October as the state ' s jobless rate dropped to 7.7 % , the lowest in nearly three years , the U.S. Labor_Department reported Friday . Nationally , unemployment edged down one-tenth of a percentage_point to 5.8 % , the lowest level in four years . U.S. employment continued to grow at a solid , if unspectacular , pace last month , adding 194 # 000 jobs . But Friday ' s employment reports , which included news of rising wages , triggered deep fears in financial markets of renewed inflation . The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 38.36 points to 3 # 807.52 , bringing its loss for the week to 123.14 points , the biggest weekly decline in more_than two months . Yields on the 30-year Treasury_bond , a key indicator of inflationary sentiment , climbed to 8.15 % , up from 8.10 % and reaching the highest level in more_than three years . Strong economic_growth nationally -- by raising the likelihood the Federal_Reserve will boost interest_rates to prevent inflation -- &quot; is a risk to California , since we ' re just at the beginning of a recovery phase , &quot; said Larry Kimbell , director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project . The state ' s performance lags far behind the recovery that has stimulated job growth nationally . The nation has added nearly five million jobs since mid-1990 , but by one estimate , California has roughly 400 # 000 fewer people at_work today than four years ago . Los Angeles County , which along with San Diego has been the weakest link in the state ' s recession-ravaged economy , is joining California ' s rebound -- or , at least , bottoming_out . Los Angeles County ' s jobless rate fell to 7.8 % in October , down from 8.3 % in September , and the lowest level since April , 1992 . October marked the second consecutive monthly drop , and a significant improvement in a jobless rate that averaged 10 % the first eight months of the year . Orange County ' s jobless rate was 6 % for September , the most recent month for which figures are available . That was up slightly from August ' s 5.9 % . Labor analysts said the slight rise came largely from regional drops_in manufacturing and high-technology employment . October figures for Orange County are to be released Nov . 18 . &quot; Los Angeles looks_like it ' s flat or barely in recovery , while the rest of the state is definitely in recovery , &quot; Kimbell said . Although most experts are confident that California ' s job situation is getting healthier , the true speed and intensity of the state ' s fledgling recovery still are being debated . And the latest reports intensified that debate . On Friday , the Labor_Department ' s survey of households used to calculate the jobless rate showed the number of Californians at_work rising by 239 # 000 in October , bringing the gain over the last two months to more_than 400 # 000 . But a sharply contrasting situation was portrayed by the federal_government ' s companion survey of employer payrolls , which traditionally is considered the more precise yardstick of employment . It reported that the state ' s job total dropped_by 7 # 900 last month . Analysts increasingly believe that the true state of the state ' s economy lies somewhere in between the two monthly employment reports . Other economic indicators , such_as state tax receipts , auto sales , retail sales and housing permits &quot; all are pointing toward a pretty good recovery , &quot; said Ted Gibson , principal economist for the State_Department of Finance . His office estimates that the state currently is gaining a moderate 15 # 000 jobs a month , and many economists agree with that general assessment . Economists fault the payroll survey for failing to count jobs created at young firms founded since 1991 . But they also believe that the household survey , which was redesigned at the beginning of this year , is overstating job growth and is not yet properly accounting_for seasonal trends in the economy . Still , analysts were encouraged by California ' s 7.7 % jobless rate in October , down from 8.3 % the month before . The state ' s rate has declined three months in a row , and is down from 9 % in July . &quot; California is just coming_around now , &quot; said Howard Roth , a senior economist at the Bank of America . &quot; We bottomed much later than the rest of the country and are now just beginning to come back. &quot; The defense and aerospace industries , so prominent in the state ' s economy , have finally stanched their &quot; hemorrhage of jobs , &quot; said Labor_Department official Thomas Plewes . Nationally , there were broad gains in retailing employment , including jobs at auto dealers , furniture stores and general merchandise stores , according to Katherine G . Abraham , commissioner of Labor Statistics . Across the country , just as in California , job declines are moderating in defense-related industries , she said . Defense-related jobs were disappearing at the rate of 8 # 000 a month this year throughout the United States . But the losses slowed to 3 # 000 in October . Aircraft and parts jobs , dropping at the rate of 5 # 000 a month , declined only 1 # 000 last month . President Clinton , campaigning in Minnesota for Democratic senatorial candidate Ann Wynia , bragged about the nation ' s falling unemployment_rate , saying it demonstrated his Administration has &quot; delivered what the American people have long wanted. &quot; The country is enjoying a &quot; terrific recovery , &quot; Clinton said . There were 124.2 million Americans at_work during October , and unemployment totaled 7.6 million , according to the household survey . The companion survey of payrolls put last month ' s job growth at 194 # 000 , considered a healthy gain but down from the average monthly increase of 275 # 000 this year . Labor_force growth is accelerating as more Americans , sensing improved opportunities , are seeking work . Just as bad times discourage people and cause them to drop_out of the work_force , a robust economy draws more prospective workers . The Labor_Department also reported Friday that average hourly earnings rose to $ 11.24 , a gain of eight cents and the biggest monthly rise since an identical increase of 8 cents in September , 1983 . However , a single month ' s figure should not be viewed_as a harbinger of inflation , according to BLS chief Abraham . &quot; I am disinclined to make too_much of it , &quot; she said . Wall_Street was not reassured , and the markets reacted negatively to the employment report . Interest_rates rose across the board in the bond market , on the expectation that the Federal_Reserve_Board will have to tighten credit for a sixth time this year to try to slow the economy . The Fed ' s policy-making committee will meet on Nov . 15 , amid widespread predictions that a rate hike is imminent . Rosenblatt reported from Washington and Silverstein from Los Angeles .
