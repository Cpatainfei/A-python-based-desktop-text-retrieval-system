   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; THE SECRET LIFE OF ' TRUE LIES ' ; EXCITING ACTION IS UNDERCUT BY FILM ' S MEANNESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> James Cameron has a most active imagination . Not for him the mere copying of what has gone before , even if his past does include &quot; Aliens , &quot; &quot; The Terminator &quot; and &quot; Terminator 2. &quot; Compelled to come_up with sequences that other manipulators of mayhem have yet to imagine , he pushes the envelope further and further into the unknown with each film he makes . So &quot; True Lies , &quot; Cameron ' s latest $ 100-million-plus effort as a writer-director , considerably ups the ante for action films with snazzy sequences like a horse and motorcycle chase through a hotel and the inventive use of Harrier jets ( capable of both flying horizontally and hovering like helicopters ) . As the perfectionist creator of bravura set_pieces , Cameron is still the leader of the pack . Unlike the director ' s past films , &quot; True Lies &quot; is not nonstop action . Based on a French film called &quot; La Totale ! , &quot; it is partly a romantic spoof of action films in_general and James Bond-type spy thrillers in particular . Even though this halfway house approach means less time for explosions , both Cameron and star Arnold Schwarzenegger prove pleasantly adept at kidding the superhuman image they ' ve worked so hard to build_up elsewhere . And yet , and yet . . . . Despite all this success , all is not well with &quot; True Lies. &quot; A strain of crudeness and mean-spirited humiliation , especially toward women , runs_through the film like a nasty virus , vitiating all it touches . Most audiences , understandably diverted , will either not notice or perhaps not even mind , but it is disturbing and it shouldn ' t be ignored . The crux of that original French film is a twist on a Scarlet_Pimpernel theme about a secret_agent whose life is a secret to those closest to him . While timid Helen Tasker ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) thinks her husband of 15 years is a plodding computer salesman , in reality he ' s an ace operative for Omega Sector , &quot; The Last Line_of_Defense , &quot; one of those clandestine government bureaus that filmmakers hold_dear . Speaker of six languages ( all , apparently , with an Austrian accent ) and a whiz with weapons and gadgetry , Harry Tasker ( Schwarzenegger ) is introduced in a Bond-like scene crashing a heavily guarded party hosted by a wealthy Arab banker and his femme_fatale girlfriend Juno ( Tia Carrere ) . Both in that sequence and the ones that follow , &quot; True Lies &quot; is able to effectively kid itself , to playfully mock the conventions of espionage thrillers . Casting the breezy Tom Arnold as Harry ' s partner Gib helps , but more important is Cameron ' s unerring ability to find the humor in Schwarzenegger , something the people at &quot; Last Action Hero , &quot; for instance , were unable to manage . But , while Harry ' s been busy defending the free_world , his marriage has been disintegrating faster than a U.N. cease-fire , and &quot; True Lies ' &quot; plot revolves_around his attempts to hold it together while duking it out with Juno , her cohorts at the terrorist Crimson Jihad and their stock of stolen nuclear arms . Being the kind of exceptional action director it takes_to bring all this off demands , in part , a willingness never to grow_up , to retain a young_person ' s enthusiasm for violence and things that explode . And it ' s that streak of juvenilia , unfortunately , that has come_out in &quot; True Lies &quot; in other ways as well . Taken individually , the cruder and childish things about this film , its determination to use caricatured unshaven Arabs as terrorists , the pleasure it takes_in continually mortifying a weasely used-car salesman ( Bill Paxton ) in the most personal ways , might be overlooked , but added_together they leave a sour taste . Even more off-putting is &quot; True Lies ' &quot; treatment of women , specifically Curtis ' character . Although having Helen play most of the film as plain and mousy is perfectly OK , an extended sequence where she awkwardly prances around a hotel suite in skimpy underwear , although obviously meant to be funny , comes_across as an exercise in painful humiliation . Perhaps Cameron , whose earlier films were noted for their strong women , simply lost his bearings in this new genre and miscalculated his effects , but the results are not pleasant to watch . Perhaps , it could be argued , all this is taking a bit of diversionary fluff far too seriously . On the other hand , when a staggering sum_of_money is spent on a film that will get the widest possible exposure worldwide , a society ignores the regrettable parts of its message ( which includes a casual approach to wholesale slaughter ) only at its own risk . Good as he is in so many areas , even a celebrated perfectionist like Cameron can ' t perfect what he doesn ' t know how to do . * MPAA rating : R for &quot; a lot of action / violence and some language. &quot; Times guidelines : a very high body_count and a general air of hostility , especially toward women .
