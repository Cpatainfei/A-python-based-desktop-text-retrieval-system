   <HEADLINE> FIRST_PERSON / DAVID SHAW : JUST CONSIDER THE ALTERNATIVES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Maybe I ' m strange -- various people have suggested that ( and worse ) over the years -- but I ' ve actually enjoyed driving_in post-earthquake Los Angeles . I ' ve lived_in Southern California since 1946 and I ' ve driven here since 1959 . For most of that time , I ' ve been telling out-of-town visitors -- especially those smug , if benighted , souls from New York -- that Los Angeles is the most manageable big city in the country , if not the world . No need for snow_tires or topcoats in winter . No need to shower twice a day in summer . No standing on the corner , waving futilely at taxis . No bombardment by constant noise and hordes of people -- most of them growling like angry bears -- as you try to walk down the street . But the one feature that made life in Los Angeles most manageable was the very feature that outsiders grumbled about the most : the spread-cum-sprawl of the city . In L.A , until a_few years ago anyway , you were rarely caught in a New York-style ( or Chicago- , San Francisco- , Paris- , Jerusalem- , Mexico City-style ) traffic_jam -- the vehicular equivalent of Sartre ' s &quot; No Exit. &quot; In New York , if you ' re going to Kennedy Airport , say , and you get stuck_in traffic on one of the bridges or expressways , you stay stuck_in traffic ; there ' s no reasonable alternative . But in Los Angeles , you could always find an alternate route . Since the earthquake , I ' ve had to find many alternate , non-freeway routes . And -- surprise ! -- I get where I ' m going almost as quickly , sometimes more quickly , and with less uncertainty and less stress than I did on the freeways . I ' ll be the first to admit that my daily commute is infinitely easier than most . I work Downtown and live 12 minutes away ( 15 if there ' s heavy traffic ) . But my wife and I go_out several nights a week -- to Santa Monica , Pasadena , Beverly Hills , the Valley , everywhere -- and I ' ve been delighted to find that driving has generally been , well , a breeze , even during evening rush-hour . We used to take the Santa Monica Freeway for most of our trips to the Westside . Now I usually stick_to surface streets , at least during the week . Beverly Boulevard ( or Third Street ) all_the way to Doheny , south to Olympic or Pico , then west if I ' m going_to Beverly Hills or Santa Monica , for example . I ' ve gone door-to-door in less than 40 minutes a dozen times since the quake -- without the uncertainty I ' ve encountered in recent years on the freeway : Would I have clear_sailing or inexplicable congestion ? In pre-quake days , I routinely refused -- except in extraordinary circumstances -- to leave home for the Westside before 7:30 on weeknights . Now I leave as early as 5 or 6 o ' clock , and if I do hit a traffic_jam , I take special pleasure in dodging it by instantly zigzagging through surrounding residential streets . It adds a new dimension to my driving pleasure , without significantly expanding my drive-time . About a month after the earthquake , I finally decided to try the Santa Monica Freeway again . It was a weekend and my wife Lucy was with me , and the car pool lanes had us jumping_off and back on the freeway quicker than you could say &quot; Adriana Gianturco. &quot; Thus emboldened , I tried to take the Santa Monica Freeway from Downtown to West L.A. one weeknight when I had to work late . I left the office a little after 8 o ' clock . The freeway detour as a solo driver was noticeably longer , but it still only added about 10 minutes to my ride . My wife , who commutes to Century City for work , tells me it now takes her 10-15 minutes longer each way . I sympathize_with her . I sympathize even more with the people who now spend an hour or two getting_to and from work . But a recent story in The Times said that while the earthquake had &quot; adversely affected the daily commutes of about 1 million motorists , it has improved the drive for about 200 # 000 others. &quot; Why ? Car pools . Car pool lanes . Mass transit . Flexible work hours . Fewer drivers using the freeways . One night last week , I undertook the ultimate challenge : I left Downtown at 5:20 p.m. -- the teeth of rush_hour -- bound for Beverly Hills . I cruised west on Beverly Boulevard until I approached Vermont . Spotting a bottleneck ahead , I hung a quick left and doglegged down to Third Street . Approaching Western , I spotted another bottleneck and hung a quick left to Sixth Street . But I breezed along Sixth -- one of the great &quot; unknown &quot; east-west arteries in town -- until I got_to San Vicente . There I encountered my first truly horrific traffic_jam of my post-quake era : As I approached La Cienega , the left lane was blocked by a stalled truck , the right lane was closed for repairs and the traffic_lights were out_in every direction . I had no choice but to inch along for what seemed an eternity . But I only had to go one long block ; I still managed to make the trip in 39 minutes . * That drive confirmed what I continue to think is the best feature of driving_in Los Angeles -- post-quake even more_than pre-quake : the ever-popular alternate route , a fixture of the Los Angeles road system for so_long that it once fostered a song ( &quot; Take an alternate route , take an alternate route . It ' s a lovely day for an alternate route . . . &quot; ) From where I live , for example , the best way to go_to South-Central Los Angeles is to take the Hollywood Freeway south to the Harbor Freeway ; after the earthquake , when I heard a report ( erroneous , as it turned_out ) that the Harbor / Santa Monica Freeway connector was damaged , I just took Rampart Boulevard to Hoover to Washington to Figueroa to Vernon and hopped back on the Harbor Freeway . The next day , when I heard a report ( accurate this time ) that there was a problem at the juncture of the Ventura and Hollywood freeways , I just got_off the Ventura two exits before the problem , zipped along Olive Avenue to Barham Boulevard and picked_up the Hollywood Freeway . Each of these detours occasioned only a minor delay . For all I know , they might have been faster than the freeway , where -- in recent years -- I ' ve encountered traffic_jams at virtually any time of the day or night . * I miss the old days , the days when if you just avoided rush_hour , you could race down the freeway as fast as you were willing to drive . I love the sense of speed and freedom on the freeway , and in those days , traffic_jams were so rare -- and I drove the freeways so_much -- that I prided myself on being able to instantly determine , from the flow of traffic , precisely why a freeway was suddenly jammed at a given moment . Accident ? In the traffic_lanes ? Off to the side ? Or was there a big football game nearby ? Or was it just the looky-loo phenomenon ? I once stunned an out-of-town visitor by saying , in the midst of a San Diego Freeway traffic_jam on a warm summer afternoon , &quot; I bet we ' ll find a good-looking woman standing by the side of the freeway with an overheated car about a mile ahead , with every guy slowing to look -- but not to help. &quot; My friend laughed . I got cocky . &quot; Center divider . Red dress . Blue car , &quot; I said . I was right . Except the car was green . I always jump_off the freeway the instant I sense a serious traffic problem . Life is too short to spend any of it in traffic_jams . Especially in Los Angeles , a city with even more alternate routes than would-be screenwriters . Now , I often skip the freeway altogether . And driving is again as relaxing as it was back in the ' 60s , 70s and early ' 80s . The extra few minutes that some trips now take just make_it easier to finish smoking my cigar before I get home from dinner .</TEXT>
