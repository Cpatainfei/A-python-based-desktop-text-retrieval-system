   <HEADLINE> LOCAL TALENT DIVES IN AT POINT MUGU ; AVIATION : ATTENDANCE DROPS AT ANNUAL AIR SHOW AS BIG MILITARY FLIGHT ACTS ARE MISSING FROM LINEUP . BUT NAVY SQUADRONS SEE IT AS THEIR ' MOMENT TO SHINE. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thousands of aviation fans turned_out for some old-fashioned , seat-of-your-pants aerobatics Saturday at the 32nd annual presentation of the Point Mugu Air Show . * With the absence this year of the big military flight-demonstration teams such_as the U.S. Navy ' s Blue_Angels and the Air_Force ' s Thunderbirds , the air show ' s producers relied_on a mix of local Navy squadrons and nationally known civilian aerobatic acts to fill the gap . Local Navy Point Mugu aviators said they relished their moment out from under the wings of the big acts , even though attendance -- estimated at 30 # 000 by air-show organizers -- was down dramatically from last year ' s first-day crowd of about 100 # 000 people . The show at Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station continues today . &quot; This was our moment to shine , &quot; said Capt . Daniel R . McCourt , commander of the VX-9 Detachment at Point Mugu , a Navy unit that flies and tests F-14D Tomcats and their weapons_systems . &quot; It ' s kind of nice to be able to show the local folks and our families what we do when we come_to work. &quot; During their performance , squadron members wowed the crowd while demonstrating classic Navy-style dog-fighting , strafing and bombing runs that shocked the audience with loud , percussive explosions and sent fireballs into the skies over the infield on the base ' s main runway . Navy Lt . Max Duggan , one of the squadron ' s pilots who flew Saturday , said demonstrating his F / A-18 Hornet ' s capabilities before a hometown crowd was a blast . &quot; We kind of like being the center_of_attention , &quot; said the 31-year-old Duggan , a Camarillo resident . &quot; Not only do our friends and family get_to see us fly , so do our maintenance crews -- they ' re the ones that do all hard work that make us look good out there. &quot; On the squadron ' s last bombing_run , a pair of F-14 Tomcats simulated the release of four 1 # 000-pound bombs over the infield . Immediately after the explosion , ground_crews intentionally set a portion of the field on_fire . That provided a perfect entree for a C-130E Hercules from the Channel Islands Air National_Guard , which swooped in moments later and extinguished the blaze . The big green military transport demonstrated the guard ' s most recent high-profile mission : fighting forest_fires . The show formally started at noon with World_War II-era fighters from the Southern California Wing of the Confederate Air_Force , which performed the famed &quot; missing man &quot; flyby . The Camarillo-based squadron was followed by the presentation of a 1 # 200-square-foot American flag by a member of the all-female Misty Blues Parachute Team , who unfurled the banner as she jumped from a helicopter . Before the modern Navy squadrons took_to the skies , a rare Grumman F8-F2 Bearcat fighter , which saw service at the close of World_War_II , joined up for a wingtip-to-wingtip flyby with its modern-day counterpart , a Grumman F-14D Tomcat -- showing_off more_than 50 years of Navy fighter_aircraft . The show also highlighted the skills of several civilian aerobatic specialists , who flipped , rolled , dived and twisted through the skies over the sprawling base . One pilot brought an international flair to the show with his Russian-made Sukhoi-29 high-performance monoplane . Walnut Creek-based pilot John Piggott waited two years and paid $ 175 # 000 for the specialized Russian plane -- designed with high-tech composite_materials specifically for the Russian National Aerobatic Team . &quot; They designed and built this aircraft specifically to beat Western pilots in air shows , &quot; Piggott said . &quot; It has no military history to it and it wasn ' t a trainer . They built it to win medals. &quot; During his performance , Piggott maneuvered the gleaming plane from horizontal to vertical , so that it glided nose-up across the sky , a stunt that caused the crowd to roar in amazement . &quot; My whole_thing is to try and get the audience to say , ' Airplanes aren ' t suppose to do that , ' &quot; Piggott said . &quot; that ' s the kind of act I ' m trying to develop. &quot; * MORE AIR SHOW IMAGES : B2</TEXT>
