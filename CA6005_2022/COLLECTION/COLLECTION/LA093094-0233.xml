   <HEADLINE> ATHLETIC FUTURE CLOUDY , BUT CSUN LOOKS TO BIG SKY ; COLLEGES : MATADORS INQUIRE ABOUT OPENING TO BE CREATED BY DEPARTURES OF IDAHO AND BOISE STATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A void was created in the Big Sky Conference last week , and Cal State Northridge may ultimately help fill it . Idaho and Boise State of the Big Sky have received preliminary clearance to defect to the NCAA Division I ranks . Northridge and fellow American West Conference members Cal State Sacramento and Southern Utah have expressed &quot; real interest &quot; to Big Sky members about joining their conference , Northridge Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said Thursday . Boise State and Idaho , which will move to Division I from the I-AA Big Sky , could join the Big West Conference as soon as 1996-97 . An NCAA ruling on_the_move is expected in a_few months . Hiegert said Boise State and Idaho must receive exemptions from the NCAA regarding stadium size before the shuffle takes_place . Neither school ' s home stadium meets minimum seating criteria . Northridge would join the Big Sky in all sports , except men ' s and women ' s swimming , baseball , soccer , softball and men ' s volleyball . However , depending_on the final composition of the Big Sky , these programs also could be included in the conference if enough new schools field those teams . &quot; In most respects , ( the Big Sky ) takes_care of most of our problems , &quot; Hiegert said . A Northridge move of any sort likely will be contingent_on the passage of a student referendum next month . Students will be asked to vote on a $ 49 increase in semester registration fees to underwrite the Matador athletic budget . Northridge and other AWC members last spring made inquiries about merging with the Big West , but officials said the conference was not in an expansion mode at the time . Last week , that changed . Portland State , a Division II school , also has expressed interest in joining the Big Sky . Without Boise State and Idaho , the Big Sky would consist_of Eastern Washington , Idaho State , Montana , Montana State , Weber State and Northern Arizona . The NCAA requires a minimum of six teams for a conference to earn an automatic postseason berth , which means the Big Sky ' s margin for error could soon be nil . The AWC has no automatic berth . &quot; We could go_with one big conference , or a north and south ( division ) or whatever , &quot; Hiegert said . The AWC membership could soon dwindle . Hiegert said Cal Poly San Luis Obispo , the fourth member of the AWC , already has received an invitation to join the Big West , along with Boise , Idaho and North Texas State . Northridge ' s football , cross-country and track_and_field teams are in the AWC , the baseball and softball teams play in the Western Athletic Conference , and several other teams play in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation . The men ' s basketball_team competes as a Division I independent . Hiegert said Northridge also is in a wait-and-see posture regarding the Big West , which includes Cal State sister schools such_as Long_Beach State and Fullerton . The Big West also is shrinking -- Fresno State left the Big West for the WAC two years ago and Nevada Las Vegas and San Jose State are doing likewise in 1996-97 . However , the Big West ' s long-range plans aren ' t clear and Northridge has no plans to tread water . What ' s more , discussions with the Big West haven ' t been as formal , Hiegert said . &quot; The Big West , for us , is probably the closest fit , &quot; Hiegert said . &quot; But we need to get our house in_order and do what we need to do. &quot;</TEXT>
