   <HEADLINE> THE LION KING AND HIS COURT ; 7 FILMS ARE EXPECTED TO PASS $ 100-MILLION MARK THIS SUMMER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With no &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; on the horizon , there was little hope that this summer would match last year ' s record-breaking $ 2.1-billion box-office bonanza . But that ' s not what happened . There were no dinosaurs this year . But there was a lion named Simba , who grossed well more_than $ 200 million , and a lamb named Forrest -- who approached that figure this weekend . Three other films have hit $ 100 million and two more should hit the mark by Labor_Day , the official end of the 15-week summer cycle that began Memorial_Day weekend . All told , summer ' 94 should inch ahead of last year with an estimated $ 2.1-billion to $ 2.2-billion final total . This is the first summer in which seven movies are expected to exceed $ 100 million . ( There were five each in 1993 and 1989 , the two other $ 2-billion summers. ) Those seven films are responsible_for about half the movie tickets sold this summer . However impressive these numbers , they ' re just numbers . They render the audience faceless , ageless and sexless . They don ' t tell us who went_to the movies and how often , or if there was an actual rise in_attendance or simply that tickets prices were higher . Industry_analysts Art Murphy of the Hollywood Reporter and John Krier of Exhibitor Relations calculate the season somewhat differently . Both say that ticket prices have remained relatively stable ( averaging about $ 4.14 ) since last year . Thus , any dollar gain indicates that more tickets were sold . According to Krier , sales this summer should be between 516 million to 530 million tickets , compared to 513 million tickets sold last summer . Who bought those extra tickets ? People who go_to the movies went more often , says Murphy . The summer release pattern may have helped . The studios avoided competing head to head by opening higher-profile movies on successive weekends . Week after week a steady stream of films opened . Movie fans didn ' t have to scrounge around for something new . ( It helped that many of the big movies satisfied too. ) The infrequent filmgoer made at least one extra visit to theaters , according to Murphy . Every summer , infrequent filmgoers ( who see two to six films a year ) catch one high-profile film , and usually another at Christmas . This summer they saw at least two -- likely &quot; The Lion King &quot; and &quot; Forrest Gump. &quot; &quot; Lion King &quot; was an event even before it happened . Its popularity as a family pleaser was anticipated , if not at such Gargantuan levels . Disney ' s &quot; unscientific &quot; breakdowns , says a studio spokesperson , indicate that 70 % of admissions have been adults -- either accompanying a child or on_their_own . If 30 % seems low for kids ' admissions , it ' s because Disney ' s estimates include a formula that doesn ' t count repeat visits by kids . Paramount ' s oddly titled &quot; Gump &quot; infatuated the public perhaps in a way that no other adult-oriented drama ever has -- albeit with more_than a dollop of &quot; E.T. &quot; -style sentimentality and special_effects . ( Virtually every one of the 10 top-grossing movies of all time , including &quot; Star Wars &quot; and &quot; Batman , &quot; have been &quot; event &quot; entertainments aimed primarily at families or younger audiences. ) &quot; Gump &quot; attracted everyone -- teen-agers , adults , males , females , adults from urban and suburban -- and has done scads of repeat business . Early previews had demonstrated the nostalgic music-laden film ' s wide appeal , especially as a trip down memory lane for baby_boomers , one of whom cites it as &quot; My Life ' s Greatest Hits. &quot; No one foresaw the strength of its appeal_to other segments of the audience , particularly to teen-agers , according to Paramount Chairman Sherry Lansing . The title character , played by Tom Hanks , epitomizes teen-agers ' sense of awkwardness as adolescents . Says Lansing : &quot; Every kid feels he ' s not the smartest or the best looking or the best liked. &quot; It also worked as an entertaining history_lesson . Many teen-agers saw the movie several times , which accounts in part for its amazing resilience at the box_office . Another lucky break for Hollywood -- though not for baseball fans -- has been the strike . Arriving in August , when box_office begins a steady descent as schools gradually reopen , the test of wills between baseball owners and players helped stem the erosion . &quot; Gump &quot; got a late summer push from the millions of males who never got_off their duffs while the season was going . So did Paramount ' s early August release , &quot; Clear_and_Present_Danger , &quot; starring Harrison Ford , which hit theaters just as the strike was announced -- in part explaining why it ' s expected to out-gross its Tom Clancy predecessor , &quot; Patriot Games. &quot; Females also flocked to &quot; Gump , &quot; even as the film_industry continues to under-exploit that half of the population . Lacking a &quot; Sleepless in Seattle &quot; this year , women discovered &quot; The Client &quot; and even &quot; Speed. &quot; A rare direct attempt to reach women , &quot; I Love Trouble , &quot; didn ' t work , says one studio chief , because the target audience didn ' t buy a 26-year-old Julia Roberts falling_for Nick Nolte , a man more_than twice her age . that ' s a male fantasy . Only one significant picture , &quot; The Mask , &quot; was targeted primarily at the teen-age market -- a segment to which Hollywood was once enslaved . They ' re still present in sufficient numbers to boost that film_over the $ 100-million level , according to New Line marketing head Chris Pula . The film also pleases slightly older males , but it ' s the teen-agers who are making_up the bulk of return business , the factor that carries a film above $ 100 million . Adults over 25 weren ' t enough to elevate &quot; Maverick &quot; and &quot; The Client &quot; to $ 100 million -- again because they usually don ' t go_to movies more_than once as younger viewers do , according to Warner Bros . distribution head Barry Reardon , whose studio released both films . But the over-25ers are the largest demographic bulge and they alone will carry &quot; Maverick &quot; and &quot; The Client &quot; into the $ 90 million-plus range , with an outside chance that both will squeak into nine-figure land . While Hollywood continues to underrate segments of the audience , the obsession with the male action market may be exaggerated . By itself , the group is not proving significantly larger than other demographics . ( that ' s true in the United States ; overseas they ' re the biggest audience , which is why action films are in no danger of extinction. ) The summer ' s two big action movies , &quot; True Lies &quot; and &quot; Speed , &quot; did_well with core male viewers . But it was female attendance that gave them the box-office edge , says 20th Century Fox President Bill Mechanic . After targeting men early on , Fox altered its advertising strategy to feature Jamie Lee Curtis and Sandra Bullock , the respective co-stars of &quot; True Lies &quot; and &quot; Speed. &quot; Also exaggerated is the death of the sequel . Audiences felt that &quot; City_Slickers II &quot; and &quot; Beverly Hills Cop III &quot; were more of the same . But there are other kinds of &quot; sequels , &quot; or those films that have a built-in recognition and expectation . &quot; Maverick &quot; was , for the over-30 crowd , essentially a big-screen continuation of a once popular television series . Universal ' s &quot; The Flintstones &quot; and &quot; Little Rascals &quot; were kid movies marketed by courting the adults who were familiar_with the titles , according to Universal Chairman Tom Pollock . Disney has created a &quot; tent-pole &quot; -- films that can be relied_on to perform -- without having to revert to conventional sequelitis , in the process broadening the interest and acceptance of animation . &quot; We ' ve broken_through the prejudice some adults had against animated films , &quot; says studio marketing head Bob Levin . &quot; Now audiences accept them simply as movies. &quot; The success of &quot; Lion King &quot; -- following &quot; Aladdin &quot; and &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; -- is the best advertising for next summer ' s animated arrival , &quot; Pocahontas. &quot; Paramount , with Harrison Ford , has hit into a similar skein with the Tom Clancy series . And John Grisham adaptations ( &quot; Client , &quot; &quot; The Firm &quot; and &quot; Pelican Brief &quot; ) are now three-for-three . With each new film , studios try to build_on the core audience and work to make inroads with different demographics . As happened last year , some industry sages are saying this year ' s summer record is likely to stand_for a while . Others are already dusting off the national pastime ' s motto : &quot; Wait till next year. &quot; TOP 10 FILMS OF SUMMER ' 94 These are estimated grosses projected through the Labor_Day weekend . &quot; The Lion King &quot; : $ 260 million &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; : $ 225 million &quot; The Flintstones &quot; : $ 130 million &quot; True Lies &quot; : $ 130 million &quot; Speed &quot; : $ 115 million &quot; The Mask &quot; : $ 100 million &quot; Clear_and_Present_Danger &quot; : $ 100 million &quot; Maverick &quot; : $ 96 million &quot; The Client &quot; : $ 85 million &quot; Wolf &quot; : $ 64 million</TEXT>
