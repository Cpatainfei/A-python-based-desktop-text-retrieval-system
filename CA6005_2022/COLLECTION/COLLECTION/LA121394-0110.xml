   <HEADLINE> PRO BASKETBALL ; LEARNING THEIR LESSONS ; CLIPPERS SHOW IMPROVEMENT AFTER 0-16 START</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Coach George Karl of the Seattle SuperSonics bowed as he passed Clipper Coach Bill Fitch . &quot; Master Fitch , Master Fitch , &quot; Karl said with a smile . Karl might have been joking , but he genuinely admires the job Fitch has done_in rejuvenating the Clippers , who have won two of three games after an 0-16 start . &quot; No way you want anyone to go_through what they were going_through , &quot; Karl said . &quot; I was 2-19 my rookie season in coaching ( with the 1984-85 Cleveland Cavaliers ) . I remember winning my third game on Christmas_Day . There ' s not much you can do except work hard and coach hard . &quot; I think it ' s a process of building , and every time I ' ve seen them they ' re doing that . They ' re running the offense better and defensively they ' re more solid . And I think he ' s finding_out about his players too . Everybody thinks you can do that in eight games in the exhibition_season , but you can ' t . &quot; I think they ' ll be a decent basketball_team by the end of the year . I don ' t know if that ' s 15 wins or 25 wins. &quot; The second-oldest coach in the NBA , Fitch , 60 , displayed patience with the Clippers at the start of the season . &quot; I think it ' s a lesson that applies to most of life , &quot; Laker Coach Del Harris said . &quot; If you stay_at doing something with effort , you ' re going to improve . I think Fitch has shown a patience with them and I think they ' ve shown a determination to continue to play hard through the good and bad times . If you ( persevere ) , the good times , or better times , are close_at_hand . that ' s what impressed me about them . &quot; Even when they were in the worst part of the streak , they played very hard and were giving themselves a chance to win. &quot; One loss away from tying the NBA record for most at the start of a season , the Clippers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in overtime last Wednesday , 96-94 . Then , playing with increased confidence , they defeated the Lakers by 25 points last Friday at the Forum . And on Saturday , after losing to the SuperSonics by 25 points at the Tacoma Dome last month , the Clippers overcame a 14-point deficit and took Seattle to double overtime before losing at the Sports Arena , 132-127 . The Clippers earned respect by playing well against Seattle , which had the NBA ' s best record last season . Accustomed to being booed during their losing_streak , the Clippers received several standing_ovations for the gritty effort against the SuperSonics . Fitch cautioned , however , that it ' s too early to determine whether the team has improved . &quot; We won a couple games and people think we ' ve automatically become miracle_workers , &quot; he said . &quot; But I don ' t think we were ever as bad as people made us out . People automatically think you ' re just terrible when you ' re 0-15 . If you haven ' t been in that position in the NBA , you don ' t realize how easy it is . &quot; We have improved . Even if we lose the next 15 games , we should be better than ( when ) we were losing the previous 15 . We ' re small and we ' re playing without a proven center and that ' s tough to do_in this league , but in losing we ' ll be better. &quot; General_Manager Elgin Baylor agreed . &quot; The team has played better , &quot; he said . &quot; In the beginning , we were a new team , a new bunch of young people who had never had the opportunity to play a lot of quality minutes and it takes a while to come together. &quot; The second-youngest team in the NBA and with six new players on the roster , the Clippers needed time to mesh . Most coaches determine a playing rotation by the end of training camp , but Fitch didn ' t come_up with his until recently . &quot; It took us a while to start jelling and learning each other , &quot; guard Pooh Richardson said . Richardson , who struggled after being traded from the Indiana Pacers to the Clippers last summer , seems more comfortable now . He averaged 10.8 points and 7.5 assists during the 16-game losing_streak , but has averaged 20.3 points and 12.7 assists in the last three games . The Clippers also needed time to adjust after losing center Stanley Roberts , who suffered a season-ending Achilles ' tendon injury in their final home exhibition_game . Guard Gary Grant , who has yet to play after undergoing knee surgery in September , joined the team in practice Monday and is expected to be activated before Christmas . Besides injuries , the Clippers also had to deal with distractions caused by center Elmore Spencer , who apparently is having emotional problems . He walked three miles back to the team hotel after storming out of a practice at training camp , and Fitch sent him home from practice the day before the Clippers ' home opener . He didn ' t allow Spencer to practice after he was late for a workout last week . Spencer , who was expected to start in place of Roberts , then was put_on the injured list last week while he receives treatment for emotional problems . Forward Charles Outlaw , who had a career-high nine blocked shots against Seattle , said the Clippers never gave_up on themselves despite losing 20 consecutive games over the last two seasons . &quot; We ' re a team , &quot; Outlaw said . &quot; People don ' t play with us , they just watch us . As long as we stick_together , then we ' re all_right . If we start getting_down on ourselves , then that ' s not good . We stayed_together through the hard_times and we stayed_together through the good times and we ' re going to stay_together all_the time. &quot; Guard Terry Dehere said the Clippers didn ' t lose their work ethic during the losing streak . &quot; We kept the spirit_up through the 0-16 , &quot; Dehere said . &quot; We still came_to practice after the 16th game and worked just as hard as in training camp . There wasn ' t anyone dogging it or taking the day_off because of the 0-16 . And that ' s what you ' ve got_to be more proud_of . We came_in each day and worked and we got better. &quot; Forward Loy Vaught , who took the losing streak hard , has helped trigger the Clipper revival by playing with increased intensity . After scoring a career-high 30 points and getting 14 rebounds in the Clippers ' first victory , Vaught had 19 points and a season-high 15 rebounds against the Lakers . He had 20 points and 14 rebounds against the SuperSonics . Vaught credits Fitch for the Clippers ' improvement . &quot; He ' s been patient with us , &quot; Vaught said . &quot; He sits there with the videos and he gives us very detailed reports on the ( opponents ) so we pretty much know what ' s going_to happen . &quot; He was patient with players at first and when the time came , he had enough courage to change the lineup . So he ' s shown some faith in rookies. &quot; The Clippers ' surge coincides with the emergence of rookie forward Lamond Murray , the team ' s top draft pick . The Clippers are 2-1 since Murray replaced rookie center Matt Fish in the starting lineup . Tony Massenburg , who started at power forward for the first 16 games , moved to center and Vaught switched back to power forward , the position he played last season , so that Murray could play small forward . Swingman Malik Sealy , who has started the last two games in place of Dehere , sidelined with a sprained right ankle , has also played well . But even though the Clippers have improved , they are still more likely to challenge the Philadelphia 76ers ' all-time worst record ( 9-73 ) than they are for a playoff berth .</TEXT>
