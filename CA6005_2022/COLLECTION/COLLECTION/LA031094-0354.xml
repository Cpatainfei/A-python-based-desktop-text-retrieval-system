   <TEXT> Not a decade ago , Louisiana sausages were regional treats : Cajuns snacked on hot boudin , cooks along the river seasoned their gumbos with andouille from a_few local butchers , and New Orleanians sandwiched their hot , smoked and Italian sausages in French_bread . Today , andouille is a household word in California and might just as easily be heard in Kansas or Washington . Boudin too has reached the masses , and sausages generally have gotten hotter and more highly seasoned nationwide as part of the fallout of the Cajun craze of the ' 80s . &quot; There are all sorts of variety today , &quot; says John A . Manda , president and chief_executive_officer of Manda Fine Meats in Baton_Rouge , La . For years , smoked pork was the basic ingredient of sausage made in Louisiana . &quot; I don ' t remember anything else until about five years ago , &quot; Manda says . Now Manda distributes a variety of sausages in 26 states as the taste for the spicy food items has spread throughout the country . &quot; Ours are more seasoned than sausages from other parts of the country , and people love flavor ; I don ' t care what they ' re buying , &quot; he says . Louisianians flavor their sausages with many seasonings -- green_onion , cheese , barbecue_sauce . And the changes haven ' t stopped there . Most sausages are getting leaner , some with only 10 % fat ; many have a fat content of 15 % to 25 % ( new labels cite percentages ) . And many are made partly of chicken or turkey in addition to pork and beef . Manda says that sausage sales are booming , partly perhaps because they ' re now leaner . * And Louisiana chefs share credit with Cajun / Creole cooking shows on television for making sausages best-sellers . &quot; John Folse , Justin Wilson , Paul Prudhomme have made ( Louisiana sausages ) popular , &quot; Manda says . Vaughn Schmitt , a member of the family that owns Creole Country , a Louisiana sausage factory , says that andouille and tasso , a smoked seasoning meat , are popular in pastas and other upscale dishes in restaurants everywhere . Schmitt cites health concerns as a factor_in his business . &quot; I ' m selling more turkey than I used to , &quot; he says . &quot; People come_in here with heart problems and they can order 10 pounds of turkey sausage with no salt. &quot; Schmitt , who makes heart-healthy sausages for a local hospital , says allspice and other seasonings are used in place of salt . &quot; It still tastes good , &quot; he adds . In the world of sausage-making , Peter Giovenco described himself as a sort of subcontractor . The St . Rose , La. , butcher takes_in wild game from hunters and makes sausage from it -- duck , rabbit , seafood , turtle , alligator -- even rattlesnake sausage . &quot; I do what most people don ' t want to do , &quot; he says . &quot; If somebody wants wine and cheese or nuts or raisins ( in the sausage ) , I ' m the guy that ' s going_to do it. &quot; Giovenco combines pork and the wild game of choice with Louisiana seasonings that he blends himself . The seasonings , he says , make the difference . In addition to pepper and spices , Giovenco usually adds onions , green_onions and parsley to sausage . Some Italian sausage calls_for anise or fennel_seeds , depending_on what the customer wants . * A Louisiana butcher for 29 years , Giovenco says sausage tastes have long varied from community to community . &quot; Italian sausage varied from Chalmette to Baton_Rouge , &quot; he says . &quot; Everybody had an idea about how to make_it . Some put parsley and green_onion in it , some put anise , and others , fennel_seeds . &quot; Boudin was made_for years primarily by country people . It ' s the same thing as Cajun rice -- just cooked rice , pork and liver . They slaughtered a hog and used the casings to stuff the sausage . They didn ' t throw_away anything. &quot; Even the snouts were used back then , and rice was used to pad the meat scraps and liver that produced boudin , he says . Andouille , he recalls , was &quot; a souped-up smoked sausage with about a 5 % to 95 % ratio of fat to lean. &quot; A highly seasoned product , it was made in the country , especially in the LaPlace , La. , area . Dubbed the Andouille Capital of the World , LaPlace still is the home of some of the best andouille , although the sausage is now made throughout the state and in other states as well . &quot; In Louisiana we don ' t have rules when it comes_to food , &quot; he says . What ' s next ? Maybe nutria sausage , Giovenco says . * For a mini-boucherie at_home , here ' s how to make your own sausage . Add your seasonings to meat , then take a small portion and cook in skillet until done , then taste and adjust seasonings . FRESH OR SMOKED PORK_SAUSAGE Pure pork , such_as boneless Boston butt Salt Cayenne_pepper White_pepper Black_peppers Casings Grind or have butcher grind pork to medium grind .
