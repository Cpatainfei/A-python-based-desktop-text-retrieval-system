   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; AT EYE OF THE STORM IN MEXICO ; AS CHAOS SWIRLS ACROSS HIS NATION , ERNESTO ZEDILLO HAS BEEN THRUST INTO THE ROLE OF PRESIDENTIAL HEIR APPARENT . MANY QUESTIONS SURROUND THE RETICENT TECHNOCRAT WHO WAS LITTLE KNOWN UNTIL TWO MONTHS AGO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ernesto Zedillo , the man most likely to become the next president of Mexico , was taking_on one of his nation ' s toughest problems , the peasant uprising in Chiapas . First , he met with the southern state ' s governor . Then he drove 50 miles of winding road to visit the bishop who had mediated between the rebels and the government -- talks that collapsed after the March 23 slaying of Luis Donaldo Colosio , whom Zedillo succeeded as candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party . Zedillo twice addressed citizens of the violence-torn state from local radio_stations . Under heavy guard , he paused for pictures at a town square that rebels had briefly occupied on New Year ' s Day . Then he flew back to the capital . Not a single public appearance was scheduled . That visit a_few weeks ago was vintage Zedillo . One task -- Chiapas -- checked_off the list ; no bold moves , no risks , no crowds . That cautious approach has boosted the electrician ' s son from junior economic analyst to presidential candidate in 23 years . Ironically , it has also thrust a man whom friends and critics alike describe as orderly and disciplined into the center of the most chaotic period in six decades of Mexican history . Besides the Chiapas rebellion and Colosio ' s assassination , the police_chief of Tijuana and Guadalajara ' s cardinal have been killed in the last 11 months as battles between drug_traffickers have become more frequent . Prominent businessmen have been kidnaped in broad daylight on busy Mexico_City streets where people used to feel safe . In reaction , an estimated $ 10 billion has poured_out of the country so far this year , threatening to destabilize the peso and set_off a new round of inflation . At this crucial juncture in their history , Mexicans are being told to trust their country to a 42-year-old technocrat whose name most of them had never heard until just two months ago . Mexicans knew so little about Zedillo when he was nominated March 29 that loyal activists rushing to party headquarters to show their support misspelled his name on their signs . Since then , he has campaigned dutifully and hard . But pressing the flesh does not come naturally to him . Waving to a Mexico_City crowd one last time from the running board of his gray Suburban , he swings himself into the passenger seat , straightening his zip-front jacket and running a brush through his wavy salt-and-pepper hair . &quot; People really like to get close , &quot; he explains sheepishly , straightening his gold wire-rimmed glasses . But getting close to Ernesto Zedillo is not easy . He has built a wall of reserve around himself on his way to the presidential nomination that now leaves him dependent_on party machinery to run his campaign and beholden to that machine if he wins . Unlike most Mexican politicians , who tend to accumulate camp_followers , he has kept his circle of advisers tight , substituting rather than adding supporters . &quot; As he climbed the ladder , it became more difficult for him to remain open , &quot; one longtime friend said . &quot; Everyone wants to get close to him , and he has to manage his time. &quot; Critics take a less benign view . &quot; He has moved_up the ladder alone , &quot; said Jesus Martin del Campo , an official of the National Union of Educational Workers and a deputy for the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party . &quot; He seems extremely isolated , in his own world. &quot; Zedillo even prefers individual sports : racquetball while studying economics at Yale in the 1970s , tennis later as a promising young central_bank official , and now cycling as a father of five . Because he has built his career by obeying the unwritten rules of Mexican politics -- obedience and silence -- no one is really sure what Zedillo will do if elected . He leads no clear political or ideological movement ; until his nomination he was just another member of the elite group of foreign-educated economists who have run this country for the last decade . At the time of Colosio ' s slaying , he was the candidate ' s campaign manager , succeeding as the ruling party presidential candidate thanks to the one vote that counts , that of outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . His lack of recognition , his personal reserve and the sharp tenor_voice that quickly grows hoarse addressing large crowds might , in many countries , leave Zedillo with as good a shot at the presidency as , say , a Paul Tsongas . But in Mexico , where the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) machine has elected the last 13 presidents , he is a virtual shoo-in this August , far ahead of his eight challengers in every national poll . For its campaign rallies , the PRI is already filling Mexico_City ' s domed Sports Palace with taxi drivers , farm_workers and garbage_collectors to cheer the candidate -- or risk five days ' suspension from work if they do not show . And on pro-government television networks , Zedillo has shared memories of his impoverished childhood , promoting a Horatio Alger image to fill the void_of information about himself . The message is clear : Mexico is a land_of_opportunity where an electrician ' s son raised in Mexicali can become president -- and a vote for Zedillo will prove it . He is playing to one of Mexican society ' s most important beliefs about itself -- that this is a country that promotes social mobility . That belief has been sorely tested since 1982 as wages eroded and government spending was slashed , leaving less money for schools , scholarships and bureaucratic jobs , the traditional paths out of poverty . Only 1 % of the 1 # 155 top Mexican bureaucrats are the children of manual workers , said Roderic Camp , author of a forthcoming book about political recruitment in Mexico . Just 83 are graduates of Zedillo ' s undergraduate alma_mater , the National Polytechnical Institute , a school for children of the working class , founded to counterbalance the perceived elitism of the Mexican National Autonomous University , where more_than half the bureaucracy studied . &quot; That is indicative_of some access to upward social mobility , &quot; Camp said in an interview . &quot; But it has been decreasing rather than increasing. &quot; Zedillo addresses that issue in the time-honored PRI fashion : speaking as if he were an opposition candidate campaigning for change rather than a member of the &quot; compact Cabinet , &quot; the closest advisers to the current president . &quot; The truth is that Mexico has a tremendous problem of distribution of income , &quot; Zedillo said in a recent interview . &quot; There is an enormous concentration , and one of the ways to correct this problem is spending more on people . Much more investment is needed in the country ' s human capital , particularly among the poorest and most disadvantaged people. &quot; As Zedillo points_out at nearly every campaign stop , he knows about being poor . Born in Mexico_City two days after Christmas in 1951 , he spent most of his childhood in Pueblo Nuevo , a transient neighborhood in the border town of Mexicali . People who live behind its graffiti-covered walls have modest ambitions : opening a garage or taking a fashion-design course . &quot; Leaving Mexicali at 15 or 16 to come study in Mexico_City was a tremendous challenge , &quot; said Saul Trejo , the older brother of a junior_high_school friend of Zedillo ' s . Besides the traffic and other problems of city life he had to cope_with , students from the capital tended to make_fun of classmates from the provinces . The mid-1960s were tumultuous , with most of the ferment centered in the two public universities and their network of feeder high_schools , including Zedillo ' s Vocational School No . 5 . Classes were constantly interrupted by strikes and demonstrations . &quot; Based on that experience , he did not form a favorable opinion of public higher education , &quot; said a teacher who worked with Zedillo decades later at the Public Education Ministry . Zedillo finished a five-year program in less than four years with a record grade-point average . He also met his wife , fellow student Nilda Patricia Velasco . &quot; We never dreamed of doing postgraduate degrees abroad , &quot; said one classmate , who like many of those interviewed asked not to be identified . &quot; At most we hoped for a scholarship to a short course somewhere. &quot; That changed for Zedillo in his third year of college , when Trejo came_back to Mexico with a doctorate from Yale and looked him up . Trejo offered the 19-year-old Zedillo a job in President Luis Echeverria ' s strategic planning department , alongside the brightest young economists from Mexico ' s most prestigious universities . Showing_off their English , junior analysts called themselves &quot; el underground. &quot; Zedillo also met Leopoldo Solis , the crusty economist who ran the department . &quot; He helped me finish school quickly , &quot; Zedillo said . &quot; He encouraged me to study English . He gave me academic recommendations . He helped me to continue my studies , and when I got_back to Mexico , he offered me a job at the Bank of Mexico. &quot; With Solis ' help , he got a government scholarship to Yale . On finishing his Ph.D. , Zedillo went_to work_at the central_bank ' s economic research department , known as &quot; the medical service &quot; because it was_full of doctorates . He survived the political downfall of his mentor , Solis , and in 1983 was put_in charge of the government fund for the hundreds of private companies caught with dollar debt when the peso was devalued in 1982 . &quot; He saved a lot of Mexican companies from bankruptcy , &quot; a government source said . Along with the responsibility went one of a dozen Bank of Mexico memberships in the Club de Golf Mexico country_club , where Zedillo played tennis with top bank officials . His tennis partners recall him as a warrior on the court . But what other club_members remember is that Zedillo always carried a bunch of papers with him and worked frantically at every game break . &quot; He didn ' t know how to relax , &quot; one man recalled . Friends say that Zedillo does not relax in public ; he relaxes at his Mexico_City home , where he roughhouses with his children and cooks on the grill . The multilevel house , filled with dark wood furniture , is one of the few places where he looks comfortable without a tie . Wearing a sweater reminiscent_of Ozzie Nelson ' s cardigan , he sips tequila and jokes about the screams of his children playing in the kitchen . Success has made such moments rare . &quot; This has come at a great sacrifice of his time and private life , &quot; one former colleague said . &quot; He had to develop rapidly , and that required changes in his personality. &quot; Zedillo has become more serious and controlled , friends said . As part of the &quot; underground , &quot; he pulled pranks , such_as once telling a co-worker that he was about to be fired . The man fretted for days before finding_out it was not true . Two decades later , teachers union_representatives said they found Education Minister Zedillo humorless when they invited him to El Habito , a Mexico_City comedy club known for political satire . Zedillo sat stone-faced as actors mimicked him in a skit . &quot; He has become more and more interested in politics to the exclusion of other interests , &quot; one friend said . How good Zedillo is at politics depends_on whom you ask . Supporters point to the consensus-building required to decentralize the educational system . Detractors remember his 11-month tenure as public education minister differently , full of scandals over inaccurate textbooks and fights with the teachers union . &quot; The task overwhelmed him , &quot; Martin del Campo said . Zedillo also seemed overwhelmed at first by the presidential campaign but is adjusting . In contrast to his earlier , low-key visit , on his most recent trip to Chiapas a_few days ago , he congratulated his party ' s gubernatorial nominee at a mass rally . He still looks stiff and uncomfortable at those big rallies , but he has introduced a more intimate format of Bill Clinton-style neighborhood forums in which he shines . On the campaign trail , Zedillo fields questions about pensions , prostitution and public works , taking_notes on suggestions and often complementing the questioners . He appears to truly enjoy such policy discussions . But at the end of these forums come the inevitable round of handshakes . Zedillo seems only too glad to get_back in the van where he can put_on his tie and head_off for a private meeting with the president-elect of Costa Rica , far from the crowds .</TEXT>
