   <HEADLINE> DISCOVERY OF BREAST_CANCER GENE CALLED MAJOR ADVANCE ; MEDICINE : RESEARCHERS LOCATE DEFECT THAT CAUSES HALF OF INHERITED CASES . EARLY DETECTION MAY SAVE MANY LIVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Utah researchers have identified the defective gene believed to cause about half of all inherited cases of breast_cancer , a discovery that should make_it possible within a year to identify the estimated 600 # 000 American women who carry the gene . These women have an 85 % risk of developing breast_cancer by age 65 and an unusually high risk of developing ovarian cancer . Identifying the women at risk could save many lives by allowing intensive monitoring and early detection of the tumors , which substantially increases the cure rate . The discovery is the result of a massive effort triggered four years ago when geneticist Mary-Claire King of UC Berkeley showed that the gene , commonly called BRCA1 , is located on a small region of chromosome 17 , one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain every person ' s genetic blueprint . The race to locate the gene was ultimately won by a team of more_than 45 scientists headed by geneticist Mark H . Skolnick of the University of Utah and Myriad Genetics Inc. of Salt_Lake_City . Another team also has identified the approximate location of a second gene , BRCA2 , that is believed responsible_for most of the remaining cases of inherited breast_cancer in women , possibly many sporadic cases of the disease , as well as male breast_cancers . The discovery of BRCA1 is a &quot; major advance ( that ) will enable us to identify women , particularly younger_women , who have an increased risk of developing breast_cancer , &quot; said molecular biologist Harold Varmus , director of the National Institutes of Health . Perhaps even more important , however , will be the new understanding the genes provide about how breast_cancer occurs , according to Dr. Harmon Eyre , chief medical_officer of the American Cancer Society . &quot; We actually know very little about what causes breast_cancer , &quot; Eyre said . &quot; This is a real first_step in getting_to the bottom of what it is all about. &quot; Breast_cancer activists were delighted by the discovery , particularly because of its potential implications for understanding the biology of the disease , said Michelle Rakoff , co-chair of the Los Angeles Breast_Cancer Alliance . &quot; What we have now is early detection , &quot; she said . &quot; What we really want is prevention , and for that we need to know what causes it. &quot; Reports on the breakthrough were scheduled to be published next month in the journal Science , but they were released Wednesday after NBC News revealed their contents . Breast_cancer is the most common form of cancer in women , striking an estimated 182 # 000 U.S. women and 1 # 000 men each year . It is estimated that one in every nine women will develop the disease sometime in their lives . The five-year-survival rate after treatment for localized breast_cancer is 93 % , but the rate dips to 72 % if the disease has spread in the breast region at the time of diagnosis and to 18 % if the disease has spread to other parts of the body . The disease annually kills about 46 # 000 women and 300 men . Researchers have known for more_than 100 years that breast_cancer runs in families , with this form of the disease accounting_for about 5 % of all cases . The inherited form is physically indistinguishable from sporadic breast_cancer , but it strikes at an earlier age , with a large proportion of cases occurring in women under the age of 30 . Previous studies of more_than 200 families with the BRCA1 gene have revealed that the gene is linked not only to breast and ovarian cancer , but perhaps to colon and prostate cancer as well . Both women and men in these families have an above-normal rate of colon_cancer and men have an excessive amount of prostate cancer . The newly identified gene , Skolnick said , is a very large gene &quot; that had no similarities to any other gene that we know of until the last segment that we found. &quot; The structure of that segment suggests that the protein produced from the gene binds to DNA within the cell , but the researchers as yet have no idea what it does after it binds . Most researchers , however , believe that BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene -- one that normally keeps the replication of cells in check . Skolnick ' s group is working overtime to pinpoint its function when healthy . &quot; It is going_to be difficult , to say the least , to understand how this gene predisposes some women to breast and ovarian cancer , &quot; King said . &quot; But no one ever said breast or ovarian cancer would be easy to solve. &quot; Skolnick said it would require at least a year to develop a test for the defective gene because researchers need to be sure which mutations cause cancer , which are harmless and which are more likely to cause ovarian cancer rather than breast tumors . &quot; We want to make_sure that if you tell a woman she has an elevated risk , it is true , &quot; he said . Based on the size of the gene , a test to detect its presence could cost as much as $ 1 # 000 , he said . Eyre noted that the test will also make_it possible to determine when the defective gene is not present . In any family with many women , he said , there is a significant chance that several will develop breast_cancer even though they do not carry the gene . In such families , the test should reduce anxiety by showing that unaffected members have no unusual risk for breast_cancer , he said . Currently , some women in families with a history of the disease undergo prophylactic mastectomies to reduce their risk . If the gene is not present , such mastectomies would clearly be unnecessary . Skolnick ' s group has also looked_for the gene in several patients with sporadic forms of the disease and , to everyone ' s surprise , was unable to find it . &quot; that ' s completely unexpected , &quot; Eyre said . Generally , he said , a gene that plays a major role in an inherited form of a disease is also important in sporadic cases . Researchers have higher hopes that the other gene under study , BRCA2 , will be linked to sporadic cases once it has been isolated . The approximate location of BRCA2 on chromosome 13 was determined by a team headed by molecular biologist Douglas F . Easton of the Institute of Cancer Research in London , who studied 15 breast_cancer families that do not have BRCA1 . &quot; We think that BRCA1 accounts_for perhaps half of the inherited cases and BRCA2 accounts_for a good fraction of the rest , &quot; he said . &quot; But we think there is still another gene to be found. &quot; Easton and his colleagues -- a team that includes Skolnick ' s group -- are now using the same techniques used in Utah to isolate BRCA2 from among the approximately 65 genes located in the small segment of chromosome 13 they identified . * INNOVATION : Gene mapping is changing biology , farming and medicine .
