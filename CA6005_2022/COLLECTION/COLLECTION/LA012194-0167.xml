   <HEADLINE> FASHION ; FITNESS CHIC HITS ITS STRIDE IN STRIPES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Maybe it ' s a reaction to the frivolity of high_fashion . Or perhaps it relates to the dress-down , comfort-first attitude of the ' 90s . Call it a response to the popular fixation with physical_fitness -- which is not going_away anytime soon . Whatever the reason , tennis skirts , sneakers , workout leggings and sports bras are no longer being left court-side or at the gym . They are sliding into wardrobes and showing_up at nightclubs and dinner_parties as designers , from couture to street wear , stripe their collections and sprint full force into ' 94 with locker chic . It seems no designer is sitting_out this trend . Renditions of the real_thing hit the stores in fabrics fit for exercise , and others -- like sparkling sequins or itchy vintage polyester -- that only seem real amusing . Even accessories such_as solid headbands , white ankle socks , multifunction watches and streamlined backpacks ( instead of shoulder_bags ) are becoming required equipment . Sneakers , which have become as standard in everyone ' s wardrobe as underwear , are de_rigueur to the uniform , whether they ' re canvas or velvet . High-tech super shoes will do , but the winners are simple , retro models such_as Gazelles and Rod Lavers from Adidas or Puma ' s Suedes and Clydes . There were indicators to the eventual rise of this latest game with active wear : Urban divas and dudes have long played with clothes originally reserved for cycling , hiking and even scuba_diving ( remember that neoprene Body Glove club wear a_few years back ? ) . And let ' s not forget the ubiquitous head gear of the decade -- the baseball_cap . This time around , the obvious influence in the deluge of fashionable fitness-inspired gear is Adidas , whose side-striped exercise suits and athletic shoes , as well as anything with the trefoil logo , have long been staples of hip-hop culture . Recall Run DMC ' s 1983 ode &quot; My Adidas &quot; as well as the rap trio ' s penchant for anything by the international athletic wear company . Counterculture ' s ongoing plunder of anything retro has led it past the disco-and-bell-bottom part of the ' 70s ( which became mainstream last year ) to that decade ' s &quot; old_school &quot; mode , which includes everything from the rap of Grand Master Flash to the animated TV series &quot; Fat Albert. &quot; Adidas style has made such an impact among the new generation that the company has had to play legal hardball to prevent its legendary trefoil logo from being altered into a marijuana leaf and screened onto T-shirts and ball caps . John Fread , a spokesman for Portland-based Adidas America , attributes the label ' s long-standing appeal_to its &quot; no-hype attitude , &quot; which is very much in_line with ' 90s sentiment . &quot; There ' s a real simplicity in Adidas design . Consumers are looking_for the same comfort they get ( in what they wear ) playing basketball or working_out at the gym as dancing at a nightclub . Fashion is just responding to this lifestyle attitude. &quot; Designer Laura Whitcomb sees the trend as part of a larger &quot; sensibility of the ' 90s which is eliminating the hierarchy in fashion . For the first time we ' re seeing street wear merging with couture quality fashion that can be worn to a party or some_other event. &quot; Whitcomb ' s take_on the look , complete with an officially licensed Adidas trefoil logo , has been spotted on Madonna , Wynona Ryder and model Naomi Campbell at splashy forums such_as the MTV and Academy awards . Although the collection has expanded to include a range of striped wear , the $ 300 dress remains among the most sought-after . Whitcomb says recent trade shows pulled_in more_than 20 # 000 orders for the dress , although considerably fewer will actually be shipped . &quot; We want to keep it limited , &quot; she says . The New York-based designer contrived the dress three years ago as a fashion stylist putting_together a spread on designer gowns that incorporated athletic wear motifs . &quot; The Adidas one came_out best , &quot; she recalls . She resurrected the style last year under her collection , Label , sponsored by hip-hop hit maker Tommy Boy records . &quot; I didn ' t think ' 90s fashion offered anything that was signature of the decade. &quot; Performance-oriented fashion that reveals being physically fit is the answer , she adds . &quot; It ' s what people will see as something truly from the ' 90s. &quot; And even though this truly ' 90s trend is rooted in hip-hop culture of the ' 70s , it ' s the fact that fashion pundits are taking it to another level with greater style , better fabrics and innovative silhouette applications that is giving it its modern identity . &quot; It ' s taking the whole Adidas look , but using that idea creatively , &quot; says designer Julia ( Joolz ) Andersen of Fusion in Los Angeles . Fusion released a complete line of striped gear : leggings , hot pants , skirts ( both ankle length and barely covering ) and a long hooded dress . Like many young street-wear companies , Fusion was among the first to market the look early last year , responding to counterculture interest in vintage athletic wear . Andersen and her peers at other street-wear labels see the higher-priced &quot; knock-offs &quot; by the_likes_of everyone from Donna Karan to Chanel as a boost to their lines , with most items priced under $ 80 . &quot; We know every little_girl in America is going_to want it next season when it hits the malls , &quot; says Andersen , who is already considering a sports stripe for Fusion ' s menswear line for summer . For several seasons now , Los Angeles-based lines Pleasure Swell and Mondorama have been striping jackets , shirts , tees and hats in their menswear collections with bars that evoke auto racing more_than track . But the message is the same , say the designers . &quot; Stripes are clean , &quot; notes Mondorama ' s David Miller . &quot; They act_as a finish that accentuates , be it the body or the flow of a silhouette. &quot; Even with the eventual saturation of this trend , Label ' s Whitcomb predicts the look will &quot; carry_on for several seasons. &quot; After all , if fashion in the ' 90s is about being fit , these clothes represent vitality and health of mind and body . Dressing the part could at least set you in that frame_of_mind . Even greater is the &quot; marriage between function and style , &quot; says Joel Fitzpatrick , designer and co-owner of L.A.-based Pleasure Swell . &quot; Part of the birth of urban street wear is this marriage , with comfort playing a big part of that. &quot;</TEXT>
