   <TEXT> Although for many_a horrific tragedy , the largest earthquake ever recorded in the Los Angeles Basin was also a marvelous opportunity , &quot; a full-scale laboratory , &quot; in the words of a New Zealand structural engineer . Just as volcanologists consider getting a close-up look_at the cone of a boiling mountain the scientific thrill of a lifetime , the world ' s foremost structural , seismic and civil_engineers swarm to earthquakes for the rare opportunity to see in the rubble the intersection of theory and practice , of a computer ' s calculations and the sudden , undeniable force of a heaving fault_line . Other engineers and technicians by the hundreds have a more immediate concern : determining as quickly as possible which structures are safe . But all have to work hurriedly , because some of the best evidence is cleared_away quickly in the rush to rebuild . From their initial battle-scene observations come rapid conclusions about why buildings or freeway bridges buckled or fell , as well as the seeds of change . If the tale told by failed structures is heeded , it can affect future designs and save lives . &quot; There ' s so_much terrible damage that we have to turn this into something to work with , &quot; said Susan Tubbesing , executive_director of the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute . &quot; Otherwise , it ' s just a greater loss. &quot; Within hours of the Northridge quake , the EERI , an Oakland-based professional organization partially funded by the National Science Foundation , dispatched a reconnaissance team that eventually included about 100 experts in buildings , freeways , geology , utilities and emergency response . They and hundreds of engineers and scientists from universities , governmental agencies and nations including Mexico , Canada , Japan and New Zealand , videotaped , photographed , measured and analyzed all aspects of the quake . Japan alone sent more_than a dozen delegations , some with as_many as 50 members . So many sought to view the highest-profile destruction , such_as the interchange of the Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways , that engineers sometimes outnumbered cleanup workers . &quot; You learn something from every earthquake , because no two spots on the earth ' s surface are completely alike , &quot; said J . David Rogers , a geotechnical engineer from Pleasant Hill who was in Los Angeles when the earthquake occurred . Rogers studied the collapse of the Cypress roadway structure in Oakland in the 1989 Loma Prieta quake and prepared a report on it for the state Assembly Transportation Committee . The aspect of the Northridge quake getting the greatest attention from engineers and seismologists is the strength of the shaking , in some cases at locations far from the epicenter . That movement was captured on hundreds of sensitive but relatively simple recording devices known as accelerographs , installed by the state and federal_governments and property_owners at more_than 500 buildings and open sites around the Los Angeles Basin . The intensity of those readings , which included a vertical ground movement in Tarzana that was measured at nearly twice the strength of gravity and was among the most violent such forces ever recorded , stunned the experts and will be studied for years . Any vertical force in excess of gravity is sufficient to simply toss structures into the air , were they not anchored . Because they are , however , structures resist , magnifying the destruction . With each such cycle of movement , walls and columns and roadbeds weaken and , eventually , fail . The records of that motion could lead to tougher requirements for the construction of freeways , bridges , apartment_buildings , dams and utility lines , Rogers said . The Antelope Valley-Golden State freeway interchange that collapsed was designed to withstand a shake of 15 % of gravity , or 2 1 / 2 times as powerful as the jolt recorded in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake in the San Fernando Valley . Today , all new Los Angeles County freeways and bridges are designed to withstand jolts 70 % as strong as gravity . John F . Hall , an associate_professor of civil_engineering at Caltech and an expert in concrete dams , said an accelerograph at the Pacoima Dam in the San Gabriel Mountains , several miles southeast of that interchange , registered a sideways jolt that was more_than twice as strong as gravity and opened_up a gap of several inches between the dam and the rock abutment . The strength of the movement was &quot; higher than we would usually assume when we do design and safety assessments , &quot; said Hall , who headed the EERI reconnaissance team for the quake . &quot; It ' s an important event and it will change the way we do things. &quot; * Lessons are learned in every earthquake . After the Sylmar quake , the state began retrofitting freeway overpasses with massive cables to hold overpass sections together . Then , after the 1987 Whittier quake , Caltrans began jacketing the most vulnerable single-column freeway structures in steel to make them stronger . No retrofitted columns failed in the Northridge quake . The 1989 Loma Prieta quake focused attention on multicolumned structures , on freeway overpasses in areas of unstable soil and on the weakness of double-deck freeways . The first Caltrans personnel into the field after any major quake are area maintenance supervisors assigned to check certain stretches of freeway and radio damage reports to the department ' s emergency operations center . On their heels are bridge experts and other engineers heading to the most badly damaged areas . Because of the severity of the Northridge quake , 24 additional engineers were dispatched from Sacramento . Some of the bridges still standing were inspected with an $ 18 # 000 bore scope , a much larger version of the devices that doctors use to look inside the human_body . Caltrans had one scope , and two more were purchased the day after the quake for inspecting roadbeds and connection joints . The department also sent from Northern California two &quot; snooper &quot; trucks equipped with buckets that can be raised to get a close look_at overpasses . In addition to dispatching structural engineers , the department sent teams of seismic experts to document the forces that struck bridges and determine how the structures performed , Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said . Those experts compile &quot; the official engineering record of the event &quot; that will then be reviewed and studied for years to come , he said . Engineers &quot; like to do fancy math . . . to calculate &quot; what would happen to structures subjected_to great stress , said Hall , of the EERI . But , he said , &quot; most of what we learn comes from experience . We build something , an earthquake comes_along and shakes it and we correct it the next time we build. &quot; Roland Sharpe , a consulting structural engineer based in Cupertino , said , however , that it sometimes takes several years before knowledge gained about how structures performed in an earthquake is put into practice . Sharpe , who headed an effort by the engineering profession to develop seismic design guidelines for highway bridges , said the pressure to quickly reopen downed overpasses often means that new knowledge does not get incorporated into the rebuilt structures . As an example , he cited the reconstruction of the Antelope Valley-Golden State freeway interchange after it was damaged in the Sylmar quake . &quot; They certainly improved the design but it certainly wasn ' t up_to what we knew could have been done two or three years later , &quot; he said.EARTHQUAKE SAFETY</TEXT>
