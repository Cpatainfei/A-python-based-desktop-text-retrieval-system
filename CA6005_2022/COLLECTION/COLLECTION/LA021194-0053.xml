   <HEADLINE> TIME FOR THE TWO TO GET REAL ; TOKYO , WASHINGTON HEADING FOR DEEP TROUBLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S.-Japan summit is a ritual that has become tiresome in its ceremony and virtually meaningless in its results . There is little reason to expect at this point anything hugely better from today ' s first summit between President Clinton and Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa . But to allow the summit to end with nothing more_than the usual vague promises and photo opportunity with smiles and handshakes would set_back U.S.-Japan relations . The United States is taking an uncharacteristically firm line with Japan under the Clinton_Administration , which is seeking a results-oriented trade_policy . U.S. rhetoric has been screechy chalk on the blackboard at times , but Washington ' s rising frustration with Japan is shared by many American businesses and Japan watchers . After the signing of nearly 30 U.S.-Japanese trade agreements since 1980 , the U.S. trade_deficit with Japan is up_to an intolerable $ 60 billion . Will this gap never lessen ? The challenge for Clinton and Hosokawa is to move trade relations beyond the traditional papering over of differences . The two men thrive on political brinkmanship and pride themselves on being agents of change . Now ' s the chance to achieve change . The &quot; framework &quot; agreement signed last July by Clinton and then-Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa calls_for the President and the prime_minister to meet every six months to review progress in trade talks . Today ' s meeting is_on automobiles and auto parts , medical equipment , telecommunications and insurance . The impasse in the series of talks is over the definition of &quot; objective criteria &quot; for measuring imports into Japan . The Japanese contend that Washington is demanding specific , numerical targets for imports -- in other words , managed trade . That should not be U.S. policy ; the idea is contrary to free_trade principles . American trade negotiators repeatedly claim that they have not used the terms numerical targets or managed trade . Therein lies the wiggle room for a compromise that saves face on both sides . U.S.-Japan relations may_not have advanced during Hosokawa ' s roller_coaster first six months in office , but he did win important political reforms , lift the rice import ban and wedge open the construction market . He got the Parliament to enact an economic stimulus plan , though the $ 140-billion program was far from everything he and Clinton wanted . The reformist Hosokawa favors deregulation , open markets and a more consumer-oriented economy -- all_of which serve both U.S. interests and Japanese consumers ' interests . Clinton may_not be taking the best , most coherent approach to this divisive issue , but it should now be clear to the Japanese that he means business . Tokyo should not underestimate the new American resolve .</TEXT>
