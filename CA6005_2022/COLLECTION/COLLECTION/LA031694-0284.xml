   <HEADLINE> PARTICIPANTS DUB GLOBAL JOBS CONFERENCE A ' FIRST_STEP ' ; ECONOMY : FIRST SUCH G-7 MEETING PRODUCES FEW LESSONS . EUROPEANS SHOW NO WILLINGNESS TO END SAFETY NETS FOR UNEMPLOYED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Officials from the leading industrial democracies completed their first jobs conference Tuesday , agreeing on the need to improve education , training and worker skills to combat unemployment but failing to bridge a crucial gap between the United States and Europe . European delegations showed no sign that they are willing to take the politically risky step of reducing their traditional , expensive support for social safety nets -- which in many cases make a lifetime on government unemployment benefits more financially attractive than work_on the lowest rung of the pay scale . American officials could point to few specific lessons they learned in the day and a half of meetings in the heart of America ' s Rust Belt that would shift Clinton_Administration policies . Yet the officials -- from the United States , Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Japan and Italy -- left here on an upbeat note . They agreed in a final statement read by Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen that they had taken &quot; an important first_step , very frankly trading ideas , learning from one another &quot; about what has worked , as they try to pull their nations out of the troubling unemployment that has dogged them even as other economic_conditions begin to improve . &quot; We agreed that there is no single solution , no one idea or action that will work for every country , &quot; Bentsen said . From the start , officials went_out of their way to portray the meeting as an informal discussion of the difficulty they have encountered in trying to bring_down unemployment_rates that have reached as high as nearly 12 % , almost twice that in the United States . At the heart of their common effort was the belief that growth in one nation can help fuel growth in the others . Thus , with modest goals , conference participants -- ministers_of_finance , economics , commerce and labor or their deputies -- could proclaim the meeting a success ; they emerged from their private sessions citing support they had gained for existing policy goals . They said the Cabinet-level meeting had placed the question of providing jobs firmly on the agenda of the heads of government of the Group of Seven nations . They are to meet next in Naples , Italy , this summer . Bentsen said the officials could &quot; tell where they blew it &quot; in some programs and mentioned one country , which he did not identify , that confessed mistakes in funding an early retirement_program . As for specific lessons learned , Laura D ' Andrea Tyson , chairwoman of President Clinton ' s Council of Economic Advisers , said she wants to study further a French program that helps the unemployed start small businesses . She also expressed interest in a Japanese program that helps companies maintain work_forces during dire economic times . &quot; that ' s something the United States should look_at , &quot; she said . Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich said European_nations have &quot; developed some restrictions on the ability of individual nations to lure jobs , lure factories &quot; from their neighbors . This , he said , may offer valuable lessons for America , where states offer lower taxes and other enticements to lure companies from their neighbors -- thereby raising unemployment in those states . But at the center of the conference were the different approaches that have developed in America , Canada , Europe and Japan to employment questions : * In the United States , and to some degree in Canada , workplace &quot; flexibility &quot; -- economists ' code word to denote a lack of rules prohibiting companies from firing workers and moving operations -- is seen as a key difference from Europe , where ossified job rules protect workers at the expense of business . * European_nations offer an extensive network of social_services that protect unemployed workers , train high_school students for factory jobs and provide enviable health and vacation benefits compared to those generally available in America . These benefits set European workers , businesses and governments apart from the United States -- and have been blamed for making the cost of creating jobs and hiring workers to fill them increasingly expensive . To shift from this course , said Lawrence Katz , the Labor_Department ' s chief economist , &quot; is a very big psychological change. &quot; Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown said there was disagreement over the correct government role in providing such services and &quot; whether or not existing plans are impediments or not to the flexibility of job creation. &quot; America is &quot; far more flexible and resilient &quot; in private companies ' abilities to shift in response to economic trends , Reich said , &quot; but in terms of investment in human capital ( social_service and worker training_programs ) , we lag behind. &quot;</TEXT>
