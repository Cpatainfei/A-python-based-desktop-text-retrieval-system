   <HEADLINE> SYNTEX GIVEN OK TO SELL NAPROSYN OVER THE COUNTER ; MEDICINE : THE FDA APPROVES A NON-PRESCRIPTION VERSION OF THE POPULAR PAIN RELIEVER , SETTING THE STAGE FOR A COMPETITIVE BATTLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Food and Drug Administration has approved a popular prescription arthritis drug for marketing as an over-the-counter pain reliever -- a move that will cause competitive headaches for the makers of Advil , Tylenol and other pain remedies . The drug , naproxen_sodium , is the first non-prescription pain reliever to win FDA approval since ibuprofen a decade ago . &quot; Naproxen ' s long record of use clearly indicated that the drug could be sold over the counter , provided the manufacturer modified its dosage and labeling , &quot; FDA Commissioner David A . Kessler said Tuesday . Manufactured by Syntex Corp . of Palo Alto , the drug has been sold by prescription in the United States under the brand name Naprosyn since 1976 , mostly for arthritis and inflammation . The non-prescription version , to be marketed for Syntex by Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble , will be sold under the brand name Aleve . The FDA ' s approval sets the stage for a spirited fight in the $ 2.3-billion-a-year over-the-counter pain reliever market . The Syntex-Procter &amp; Gamble product will go_up against such established ibuprofen brands as Advil , produced by American Home Products Corp. , and Upjohn Corp. ' s Motrin IB . Another competitor will be Johnson &amp; Johnson ' s Tylenol , whose active ingredient is acetaminophen . &quot; We ' re in_for a real marketing battle , and we want to do_it the right way , &quot; said Syntex Chairman Paul E . Freiman , explaining why his firm formed a joint_venture with consumer giant P &amp; G in 1988 to seek FDA approval for a non-prescription version of Naprosyn . Analysts said the marketing_costs for Aleve will be steep enough to erase any profits from the sale of the product for the first few years . Freiman agreed with that view . &quot; It ' s a different chemical_compound than previous pain medicines , but you have to educate the consumer , &quot; said Kristine E . Bryan , an analyst at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co . in New York . &quot; Just like any new branded entity , it costs a lot of money to gain that shelf space. &quot; Bryan estimated that Aleve will generate U.S. revenue of $ 250 million during Syntex ' s 1995-96 fiscal_year , but said the actual figure will depend_on the success of P &amp; B ' s marketing effort . A spokeswoman for American Home Products said the company is &quot; confident that Advil ' s proven record of safety and efficacy will remain unchallenged by the introduction &quot; of Aleve . Syntex and Procter &amp; Gamble will have exclusive_rights to market the non-prescription drug for three years . Syntex shares gained 37.5 cents to $ 16.375 in New York Stock_Exchange trading Tuesday . The stock has traded as high as $ 23.250 during the past 52 weeks . Naprosyn and another naproxen-based drug , Anaprox , generated $ 928 million , or 32 % , of Syntex ' s worldwide sales of $ 2.13 billion for its fiscal_year ended July 31 . Syntex ' s patent for Naprosyn expired in December . Since then , more_than half_a_dozen manufacturers have begun marketing generic versions of Naprosyn . To preempt its rivals , Syntex ' s Hamilton Parma Inc. unit began marketing its own generic version of Naprosyn in August . Freiman said the generic versions have caused a &quot; rapid falloff &quot; in sales for the more costly Naprosyn brand . Syntex expected a sales decline , but the rate has been &quot; on the fast end &quot; of its estimates . The FDA ' s announcement Tuesday was therefore welcome news for Syntex . It followed a recommendation in June by FDA advisory committees that naproxen_sodium not be approved for non-prescription use . The panels were concerned that because the drug acts slowly , consumers might take too_much . There was also concern about misuse of the drug by children and the elderly . In approving the drug for non-prescription use , the FDA asked Syntex to reduce the daily dose , extend the time between doses and add label warnings for children and the elderly . The FDA said naproxen_sodium can be taken_for headaches , colds , toothaches , muscle aches , backaches , menstrual cramps and arthritis , and to reduce fever .</TEXT>
