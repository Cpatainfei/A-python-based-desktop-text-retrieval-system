   <HEADLINE> GRAND_JURY CRITICIZES JAIL COSTS , OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Orange County Grand_Jury blamed an inexperienced team of contractors and designers for contributing to $ 233 # 000 in cost_overruns during the construction of the new City Jail . In a wide-ranging report issued Wednesday , jurors also took_issue with what they described as the jail ' s &quot; controversial &quot; system of inmate management , and expressed concern over whether prisoners were getting enough to eat . Although city officials said the jail meals meet state nutritional standards , the grand_jury contended that the portions &quot; appeared to be insufficient for an adult. &quot; The report also found that federal prisoners detained at the facility were provided additional &quot; snacks and beverages &quot; that were not available to other inmates . City officials expressed disappointment with the grand_jury ' s overall assessment of jail development and operations , describing the report as &quot; a little misleading. &quot; &quot; I think it ' s hard to do an analysis when you are not part of the process , &quot; said Francisco Gutierrez , executive assistant to City_Manager David N . Ream . The $ 2.9-million jail opened in December after an 18-month construction delay . It is designed as a temporary detention center until the city can build a planned $ 90-million facility , four times the size of the 78-bed jail . The grand_jury report comes_after a glowing review of the first six months of jail operations issued June 1 by the Santa Ana Police_Department . &quot; We have established and sustained a calm , peaceful , non-threatening environment which ensures safety and security for staff , inmates and visitors , &quot; the police report stated . &quot; The facility has been inspected by a federal judge and representatives of the U.S. Marshal ' s Office . They found the facility well managed and had high praise for the overall operation. &quot; But the grand_jury was particularly critical of the cost_overruns and project delays . Jurors found that there was little justification to support costly design changes , while project managers were cited for being unfamiliar_with state and local construction regulations . Gutierrez said most of the additional costs were incurred after city officials decided to increase capacity from 48 beds to 78 . The delays , he said , were_due to poor weather and the relocation of utility lines . &quot; In the end , we not only got a fine facility , but we got a great_deal , &quot; he said . As for the quantity of food provided_for inmates , Gutierrez said the menus meet or exceed the state requirements . Jail meals are prepared by the nearby Boardwalk Cafe , where manager Bryan Leighton said preparation has been supervised by a UC Irvine dietitian . &quot; I can tell that the roast_beef we serve at the jail is the same as we serve in our restaurant , &quot; Leighton said , referring to portion sizes . The manager said typical jail dinners include either lasagna , chicken , beef_stew or meatloaf . All dinners are served with rice , a vegetable and roll . As a beverage , inmates get a choice of milk or fruit_juice . &quot; It sounds good to me , &quot; Leighton said . &quot; We just don ' t put these menus together randomly . These are designed to meet the needs of an average person in the general population. &quot;</TEXT>
