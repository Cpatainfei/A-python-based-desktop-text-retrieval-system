   <TEXT> Some films are a pleasure to watch , some a duty , some ( yes , it happens ) an awful chore . But rarest of all are those films that are so accomplished , so overwhelming , so profound that seeing them on screen is nothing less than a privilege . Krzysztof Kieslowski ' s &quot; The Decalogue &quot; is such an event . &quot; The Decalogue &quot; -- 10 films based loosely on the Ten Commandments and originally made_for Polish television -- has been the talk_of the film world since it premiered in full at the Venice Film Festival in 1989 , winning acclaim as one of the indisputably great accomplishments of modern filmmaking . But because the North_American rights to the series are owned by a Canadian group whose terms for distribution domestic companies consider too stiff , &quot; The Decalogue &quot; is close to unknown in this country . It has never played commercially , it is unavailable on video , and even the times it has been shown at film festivals can be counted_on one hand . One of those was at 1990 ' s AFI Film Festival , and now Ken Wlaschin , the festival director , who is not alone in considering the series &quot; the ' Citizen Kane ' of our time , &quot; has brought it back for this year ' s event . No one who takes film at all seriously can have any excuse for missing it this time around . Though the cumulative effect of all 10 films , which run about an hour each , is overpowering , each segment is completely self-contained and can easily be seen independently of the others . The AFI Festival has scheduled both afternoon and evening screenings for the series , with the first two films set for Tuesday and two each on Thursday , Friday , Saturday and next Sunday . A member of the post-Andrzej Wajda generation of Polish directors that includes Krzysztof Zanussi and Jerzy Skolimowski , Kieslowski is_best known in this country for his current &quot; Three Colors &quot; trilogy , with &quot; Blue &quot; premiering last year , &quot; White &quot; ( see accompanying story on actor Zbigniew Zamachowski ) currently playing and &quot; Red , &quot; woefully overlooked by the Cannes Film Festival jury , scheduled to open in December . The director first came_to international notice when his darkly satirical 1979 &quot; Camera Buff &quot; won several international awards . He co-wrote &quot; The Decalogue &quot; with Krzysztof Piesiewicz and originally intended , he says , to have 10 different directors involved . &quot; But I liked doing the first film so_much , &quot; he told interviewer Annette Insdorf in 1990 , &quot; that I didn ' t want to give the others away. &quot; Using nine different cinematographers , he shot and edited the entire series in a remarkable 21 months : &quot; Sometimes I ' d shoot part of one film in the morning , part of a second in another location in the afternoon and a different one in the evening . That kept me from getting bored. &quot; * Though these films are based on the Ten Commandments , Kieslowski has delighted in making the connection oblique and difficult . The commandments are dealt with in_order , but each film is identified only by its number , and nowhere in any of the films is the commandment in_question explicitly referred to . Yet , paradoxically , if there is one thing that sets &quot; The Decalogue &quot; apart , it is the ease with which it confronts the most serious questions of life , death , morality and belief . As much a rigorous scientist determined to explore human behavior in extremis as a creator of moral parables , Kieslowski places his characters in agonizing dilemmas , confronting them with problems that defy solution . As compassionate as he is pessimistic , Kieslowski understands that when human needs are in conflict , life is devoid_of easy choices . &quot; Man doesn ' t choose between good and evil &quot; is how he ' s put it in interviews . &quot; He chooses between greater and lesser evil. &quot; Resolving problems , then , either tidily or otherwise , is far from the director ' s concern . The exploration itself , the deep probing of psychological_states in the hope of uncovering a sliver of illumination , &quot; the contradiction , &quot; in Kieslowski ' s own words , &quot; between complicated characters and simple stories , &quot; is why &quot; The Decalogue &quot; was made and why it is so compelling and so powerful . As emotionally lacerating as these despairing , ambiguous pieces can be , they never so_much as flirt_with pretension , and that is partially a result of Kieslowski ' s absolute assurance as a director , his command of all_the resources cinema has to offer . Though Kieslowski used nine cinematographers , the director ' s spare , minimal visual style dominates each episode . The camera work is at once so fluid and so precise that you fear to take your eyes from the screen , and the films are so packed with nuance and gesture that they seem to be feature length though they are not even close . Kieslowski is helped greatly in his endeavor by the superb actors he has chosen for his cast , the best Polish cinema has to offer . All perform with exceptional restraint , and all , including the children who appear in some episodes , have faces that speak movingly even when words are absent . * The stories , briefly encapsulated with the commandments they refer to , are as follows : One -- &quot; I am the Lord thy God . Thou shalt have no other Gods before me . &quot; A rationalist father ( Henryk Baranowski ) and his devoted son ( Wojciech Klata ) share a passion for the father ' s computer . Two -- &quot; Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain . &quot; A married_woman ( Krystyna Janda ) pregnant by another man asks a doctor ( Aleksander Bardini ) whether her dying husband will live so she can decide if she needs to have an abortion . Three -- &quot; Remember the Sabbath day , to keep it holy . &quot; A married_man ( Daniel Olbrychski ) has his Christmas_Eve interrupted by his desperate former lover ( Maria Pakulnis ) . Four -- &quot; Honor thy father and thy mother . &quot; The relationship between a 20-year-old daughter ( Adrianna Biedrzynska ) and her father ( Janus Gajos ) powerfully changes when she reads a letter that was to have been opened only at his death . Five -- &quot; Thou shalt not kill . &quot; The most celebrated film in the series was later expanded by the director to a feature known as &quot; A Short Film About Killing , &quot; which won several major European awards . A gloss on the nature of murder , both by the individual and by the state , it features one of the screen ' s most graphic killings , spread_out over more_than seven minutes . Six -- &quot; Thou shalt not commit adultery . &quot; Also was later expanded to a feature , called &quot; A Short Film About Love. &quot; The most overtly erotic of the group , it deals with a young peeping_Tom ( Olaf Lubaszenko ) who falls desperately in_love with the woman he spies on ( Grazyna Szapolowska ) . Seven -- &quot; Thou shalt not steal . &quot; A wrenching story of Majka , a young_woman ( Maja Barelkowska ) who has allowed her mother ( Ana Polony ) to pretend that Majka ' s daughter is her own . Eight -- &quot; Thou shalt not bear false_witness . &quot; A professor of ethics who survived the Nazi occupation ( Maria Koscialkowska ) is confronted about her past by a young American student ( Teresa Marczewska ) . Nine -- &quot; Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor ' s wife . &quot; An impotent husband ( Piotr Machalica ) fears that his wife ( Ewa Blaszczyk ) is having an affair . Ten -- &quot; Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor ' s goods . &quot; The only even remotely comic episode , though a very dark comedy it is , details what happens when two brothers ( Zbigniew Zamachowski and Jerzy Stuhr ) discover that their dead father had the most valuable stamp_collection in Poland . Aside from Kieslowski ' s themes and his skill , a key factor unifying these stories is the somber score by veteran collaborator Zbigniew Preisner . Best known for his work_on both &quot; Blue &quot; and &quot; The Double Life of Veronique , &quot; Preisner here has come_in almost on tiptoe , choosing a minimal musical_mode that haunts each part of the series . * More prosaically , &quot; The Decalogue &quot; is also united by its site , an anonymous Warsaw apartment complex where all its protagonists live . Similarly , though he doesn ' t like to explain why , Kieslowski places the same watchful character in almost every episode , someone whose silent presence seems to be saying something just beyond our understanding . Just before &quot; Red , &quot; Kieslowski ' s most recent film , was released , the 53-year-old director announced that it would be his last , a decision he reiterated at Cannes . He has a country_house , he told the_French daily Le Figaro , where &quot; there is a veranda and a chair . I ' ll have lots of books , lots of cigarettes , lots of coffee . Don ' t you sometimes dream of the same thing ? &quot; Those who see even a part of &quot; The Decalogue , &quot; however , will have another dream , that this supremely gifted director returns to film as soon as possible .</TEXT>
