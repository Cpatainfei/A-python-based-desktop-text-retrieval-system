   <HEADLINE> PLAN TO RESTORE MONO LAKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state Water Resources Control_Board , after exhaustive hearings and extensive study , has determined that to protect the Mono Basin ' s unique environment there is need to cease exporting virtually all water from the basin for at least the next 20 years and raise the lake level another 17 feet ( Sept . 18 ) . The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power accepts that judgment and will not further appeal the board-recommended lake level . The department must now heighten efforts already under way to replace the Mono Basin supply , which historically has represented almost 20 % of the city ' s supply . Toward that end , the department will continue to pursue its nationally recognized water_conservation program , which has achieved 15 % to 20 % reduction in water usage during the past three years . In addition , the department is moving as quickly as it can to take_advantage of water reclamation and conservation opportunities in the legislation recently signed by the governor , which will provide $ 36 million of funding for projects in Los Angeles . The most important , the East Valley Water Recycling Project is being designed to provide 35 # 000 acre-feet per year of reclaimed water when it is running at full capacity . The department wants to work closely with the many other interests in California that are grappling with the complex issues involved in making additional water_supplies available to Southern California from the San Joaquin-Sacramento Delta , which will also require a new balancing between urban , agricultural and environmental interests under the guidance of the state Water Resources Control_Board . DENNIS A . TITO , President , DWP * In many ways , the most significant statement of the article is one which both sides can agree on . When referring to future water_supplies in L.A. , DWP ' s James Wickser said that unused supply was to have accommodated anticipated population growth . It is an indisputable and objective fact that more people equals more consumption . This is in spite of the fact that comparatively small offsets can be made through advances in technology or conservation / reclamation / recycling . This applies for water as well as other resources including trees , roads , schools and many_more . As is the case with virtually any environmental issue , the real / underlying issue is population growth . Manage it properly and technology , conservation and recycling , etc. , will have a chance to catch_up and actually improve things . Fail to do so and the quality_of_life for all_of this planet ' s inhabitants is in big trouble . FRANK BOHANAN , Fullerton * The Times seems to view Mono Lake ' s protection as a loss for Los Angeles . This is not true for the following reasons . The Mono Lake Committee has worked very hard to get replacement water for L.A. that would not damage the environment . And Mono Lake is a place of great value that has meaning to the people of L.A. In addition , Mono Lake is an important resource to the entire state . It is an important ecosystem as well as an important stop for migratory birds . This lake is very old and should be protected . I live_in Southern California and am willing to do my part and use less water to protect Mono Lake . There are state and federal funds available to help develop water reclamation and conservation programs in the Los Angeles Basin . These projects will create more water than the city ever diverted from Mono Basin , and the water created will be reliable , local and drought-proof . PETER K . BISCHOFF , Agoura Hills * I am writing_on behalf of the Mothers of East Los Angeles-Santa Isabel . This is a community-based organization that sponsors programs to help our community by creating jobs , expanding resources and fostering programs such_as water_conservation . Reading your article , it seemed that Southern California is going_to lose out if Mono Lake is protected . I believe that we are going_to win . Our organization and eight groups in Southern California are doing our part to conserve enough water so that we can protect Mono Lake and still meet our water needs . Through our ultra-low flush_toilet exchange program , we have conserved 6.5 billion gallons of water per year and added economic stimulus of $ 3 million into the inner_city . This past summer we took 25 inner-city children to camp at Mono Lake . Many of them had never had such an experience and Mono Lake ' s natural beauty made a big impact on their lives . We all stand to gain if Mono Lake is protected . ELSA LOPEZ , Los Angeles</TEXT>
