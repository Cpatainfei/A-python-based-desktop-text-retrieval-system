   <HEADLINE> POLICE UNION LEADERS OK RIORDAN DEAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a potential breakthrough in the police labor dispute , Police Protective League leaders on Thursday agreed to a tentative contract proposed by Mayor Richard Riordan and other city officials , but the deal still faces significant opposition on the City_Council . The contract offer accepted by the union board of directors -- which sources said would cost the city about $ 10 million more_than the deal officers voted_down in May -- was presented by Riordan , Councilman Richard Alatorre and others at a meeting Wednesday night at the Biltmore Hotel . &quot; I think if there is any way possible for the council and ( union ) members to accept this proposal , it absolutely should be done , &quot; Police_Chief Willie L . Williams said in a telephone_interview from Philadelphia . &quot; We should do everything we can to restore stability to the LAPD. &quot; The mayor and his allies circumvented the city ' s formal negotiating committee in drafting their package and taking it directly to union leaders . As a result , several key council_members were very critical of the plan and said it would cost more_than the city could afford . Those critics said the offer would significantly cut_into Riordan ' s police expansion plan -- resulting in the equivalent of 250 fewer officers on the streets -- and would put the city at financial risk . &quot; Our people , I believe , had no clue as_to the cost of what they were agreeing to until after they agreed to it , &quot; said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky , the council ' s budget chairman . &quot; It is one of the most appalling things I have seen in 19 years as a member of the City Council. &quot; Riordan called the plan a &quot; reasonable deal ( that ) hurts both sides a little. &quot; He conceded that the pay raises could take money away from his plan to put more police on the streets . But he said &quot; ingenuity &quot; could preserve the plan and cited , as an example , a special committee that is looking_for ways to reduce the amount_of_time that police spend in court . The offer was seen as a last-ditch attempt by city officials to put the contract dispute behind them and avoid disruptions during the World Cup soccer tournament -- even if the proposal crimps their future budget plans . Officials said the $ 50-million offer would give police a 7 % raise over the next 18 months and payments of $ 1 # 000 this year and $ 500 next year to make_up for the two years officers went without a contract . Patrol officers would receive an additional 1 % hike this year and 1 % next year as incentive pay , officials said . The $ 40-million deal that officers overwhelmingly rejected in May called_for 6 % raises over the next two years without the patrol bonus or the retroactive payments . It is unclear which side would next take action on the pact . Riordan said the offer would be presented to police_officers for ratification before a formal City_Council vote , which is expected to be close . But police union President Danny Staggs said he believed ratification meetings , scheduled to begin Tuesday , would come_after the council gathered the eight votes necessary to approve the contract . &quot; It is an agreement that . . . everyone , our entire membership , has something in there for them , &quot; Staggs said . &quot; It ' s not exactly what we would like . It ' s not going_to be exactly what everyone would like. &quot; The proposal , which came the day after the city declared an impasse in the dispute , was presented to the union ' s 115 delegates Thursday night at the Police_Academy . That move was a first_step in gathering officers ' support for the deal . While the proposal is under_consideration , the union called_on officers to cancel any unauthorized job actions planned to interfere with the World Cup -- including picketing at Los Angeles International Airport that had been scheduled for this weekend . &quot; We are asking our members , as a show of our good_faith and professionalism and for the sake of the public , to refrain_from participating in any wildcat actions such_as a ' blue flu , ' which we believe would be counterproductive to the negotiating process , &quot; Staggs said . Interviews with council_members indicate that the vote will be close , decided by one or two swing votes . In an attempt to kill the deal , Yaroslavsky and Councilman Marvin Braude called a special joint committee_meeting for this morning to analyze the plan and disclose how it would affect the mayor ' s plan to expand the LAPD . Yaroslavsky said the deal is far costlier than some officials realize . He said that Riordan has promised to give firefighters the same raise that police receive -- a pledge that would cost the city nearly $ 40 million in the coming year if the contract is approved , $ 15 million more_than the mayor budgeted_for raises . Riordan &quot; has made the intellectual and political decision not to deliver fully on his Project Safety Los Angeles plan -- to have higher salaries and not as_many more police , &quot; Yaroslavsky said . Braude , chairman of the council ' s Public Safety Committee , was concerned that the deal was not presented through normal channels . &quot; This goes outside the city ' s . . . procedure , &quot; Braude said . &quot; Nobody speaks_for the city except the City Council. &quot; Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said the unorthodox negotiations might set a dangerous precedent . &quot; This has made council_members feel discounted and unimportant in the process , &quot; Goldberg said . &quot; Now union leaders will think that all they have to do is get one or two key council_members and work something out on the side. &quot; Another critic of the deal , Councilwoman Rita Walters , said she is concerned about the city ' s financial future . &quot; We can ' t have a settlement that breaks the bank , &quot; she said , predicting that the offer would trigger aggressive salary demands from other city employees . But Alatorre , who played a major role in brokering the deal , accused his colleagues of hypocrisy . &quot; Some people keep saying they love the police , but when it comes time for a raise they won ' t do_it . It ' s not going_to bankrupt us . that ' s just bull , &quot; Alatorre said . He agreed that money for the raises might reduce a police overtime account , which had been set_aside to put the equivalent of about 800 officers on the street in the coming year . &quot; What is the point of saying we are going_to increase the force if we can ' t even keep the officers we have ? &quot; he asked . Williams said he had been told that overtime accounts_for police could be reduced by $ 10 million or $ 15 million in the coming year to pay_for the police raises . &quot; But we can still have a major increase in police presence and improvement in public safety , &quot; Williams said . &quot; It will not be 100 % of what the public safety plan called_for , not quite . But it will ( still ) be more_than a 100 % increase over what we did last year. &quot; Among those who were considered supporters of the deal were Alatorre , council President John Ferraro and council_members Hal Bernson , Rudy Svorinich Jr. , Joel Wachs and Laura Chick . Although the union held_out the hope that they could sell the deal to officers , they remained cautious and said the two-year labor dispute is not yet over . &quot; We have an uphill battle ahead of us , &quot; Staggs said . &quot; There are still members of the City_Council that view any fair and equitable police contract as unattainable. &quot; * SWITCHING SIDES : Ousted Riordan aide is police union strategist .
