   <HEADLINE> BUILDUP IN THE PERSIAN_GULF ; U.S. , BRITAIN , GULF STATES RENEW VOWS ; ALLIANCE : KUWAIT ' S ARAB NEIGHBORS SAY THEY WILL HELP DEFRAY COST OF MILITARY BUILDUP . THEY ALSO PLEDGE TO DETER ANY FUTURE IRAQI AGGRESSION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Asserting that the latest Gulf crisis is not over despite an apparent Iraqi retreat , the United States , Britain and six oil-rich monarchies agreed Wednesday to continue their present military buildup and vowed future action to sap Saddam Hussein ' s capacity to threaten his neighbors . The Gulf Cooperation Council , a regional rich nations club led by Saudi_Arabia , agreed to pay a substantial part of the cost of deploying U.S. , British and other allied troops to defend Kuwait against any Iraqi aggression . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher told reporters here following a strategy session with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and the six Gulf council foreign_ministers that the allies agreed unanimously to devise ways to prevent the Iraqi dictator from taking sudden provocative actions such_as sending troops south to the Kuwaiti border as Hussein did last week . &quot; We are resolved and committed that Hussein shall not be permitted to project the world into crisis at his whim , &quot; Christopher told a news_conference , with Hurd and Prince Saud al Faisal , the Saudi foreign_minister , at his side . Christopher said no specific measures have been selected . Other officials have suggested creation of a buffer zone on the Iraqi side of the border , from which Iraqi tanks , artillery and other heavy_weapons would be excluded . France and Russia -- which both have trade ties with Iraq -- have balked at such a zone , with French officials asserting that Iraq ' s internal military movements were not illegal and a Russian delegation arriving in Baghdad to discuss ways of defusing the crisis . A senior U.S. official traveling with Christopher said a &quot; no-tank &quot; zone would seem to fulfill the objective of the United States , Britain and the Gulf states . But he said there are other ways of reaching that goal . Another official said the measures must be tough enough to have an impact but cannot be so strict that governments such_as France and Russia would refuse to go_along . The Gulf Cooperation Council -- whose members are Saudi_Arabia , Kuwait , United Arab Emirates , Qatar , Oman and Bahrain -- said in a formal communique that the allied military buildup &quot; should continue until they are sure that Iraq no longer poses a threat. &quot; The council said Iraq ' s decision to withdraw some of its troops in the face of the allied countermeasures did not erase the latest demonstration of Hussein ' s willingness to use force . Christopher said flatly , &quot; The crisis is not over , &quot; despite Iraqi withdrawals . A senior State_Department official said before Iraq ' s latest military maneuver that many Gulf council officials had begun to lose their Gulf War distrust of Hussein and his policies . Now , he said , the distrust &quot; has been restored completely. &quot; Christopher obtained the endorsement of U.S. policy from the council just one day after King Hussein of Jordan expressed &quot; deep sadness , disappointment and anger &quot; at the recent Iraqi action . The king , who had shown sympathy for Iraq four years ago , issued his strongest condemnation of the latest Iraqi adventure at a joint news_conference with the secretary_of_state . After the Gulf council meeting , Christopher visited Camp Doha , a military base 40 miles south of the Iraqi border , to meet some of the 1 # 400 soldiers of the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division who have arrived from Ft . Stewart , Ga. , in the past few days . Christopher said the Gulf council agreed to &quot; equitably share the cost of our efforts &quot; and to create a special fund to finance the military_action . He said there are no firm estimates as yet of the cost of the operation , so it is impossible to determine how much each of the six Gulf states will contribute . Another senior official said later that the Gulf states probably will put_up most of the money , as they did_in 1990 and 1991 , when a U.S.-led coalition forced Iraq out of Kuwait . But the official said Saudi_Arabia paid a disproportionately large share of the 1990-91 costs and is anxious for its partners to shoulder more of the burden this time . Kuwait agreed to provide more of the cash this time , he said . In addition , the six Gulf countries agreed to allow allied warplanes to fly over and land in each of the countries . They also ordered military_units of the council-controlled Peninsula Shield Force to join in the defense of Kuwait .</TEXT>
