   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL AGENDA ; POPULOUS INDIA NO CONTENDER WHEN IT COMES TO SPORTS ; THE HUGE COUNTRY MUST OVERCOME HURDLES OF POVERTY , BUREAUCRACY AND POLITICS TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY , CRITICS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 20 # 000-seat stadium was brand new , the weather dry and sunny , picture perfect for the National Games . On the eight-lane polyurethane track , India ' s fastest men pushed their feet against the blocks . &quot; Take your marks , get set . . . , &quot; the starter barked . Then -- nothing but a dry click . Half a dozen times , officials lined the perspiring and increasingly frustrated runners up for the 100-meter race , and just as often , the starter ' s pistol refused to fire . While harried stewards searched for a new gun , longer-distance events were set_off with a whistle . When another pistol was found , it was wide-striding Rajeev Balakrishnan , 22 , who finished first , his finger triumphantly pointing at the sky . But the time_clocked by the electrical_engineering student from Iowa State University , 10.78 seconds , was almost a half-second over the national record for the 100 set 21 years earlier . Is any more evidence needed that something is seriously the_matter with Indian sports ? &quot; Why we have fallen so low is a basic question that every Indian is asking , &quot; said Narotam Puri , a celebrated New Delhi sports commentator and physician . &quot; Everyone is crying himself hoarse , because . . . we have fallen on hard times. &quot; These days sports are much more_than physical recreation or strenuous entertainment . They are a widely accepted indicator of a country ' s development and state of public health , as well as an often manipulated vehicle for international and domestic political prestige . No wonder , then , that reviewing the overall record is enough to make an Indian patriot or sports-addicted couch potato want to change the subject . At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics , China , the world ' s most populous country , grabbed 54 medals . India , the world ' s second-most populous country , won exactly -- none . India ' s humbling experiences when it competes with the best and brightest in amateur athletics have been endless . In the past three Olympiads -- Barcelona , Seoul in 1988 and Los Angeles in 1984 -- individual Indian athletes didn ' t snare a single gold , silver or bronze . In fact , since Indian independence in 1947 , only one Indian has won a medal in an individual event ( welterweight freestyle wrestler Khabasha Jadhav took the bronze in 1952 ) . All other medals have come_in the national sport , field_hockey , and India ' s fortunes there have collapsed since the introduction of artificial turf made speed and brawn more important than stickhandling . India ' s last Olympic medal in field_hockey , a gold , came_in 1980 at the boycott-depleted Moscow Games . Indians are wont_to compare their performance in everything from economics to high-tech weapons production with China , and so atrocious was Indian performance in the 1990 Asian games in Beijing that shamed Indian reporters took_to turning their press credentials around to conceal their country . Indians won a solitary gold . The ego-crushing nadir may have come this winter , when , at the South Asian Games , pipsqueak Nepal beat India in soccer -- a sport in which India once finished fourth at the Olympics . Thoughtful Indians see in their country ' s generalized debacle on the playing fields a reflection of many things they think are wrong or questionable in their society . First , glory in sport has been supposed to serve the leadership , making_it an affair of state . At the 1982 New Delhi Asian games , Chand Ram won the 20-kilometer walking race . Before he could take a victory lap , he was frog-marched to the box of Rajiv Gandhi , then general secretary of the ruling Congress Party , and made to touch Gandhi ' s feet in obeisance . * Even today &quot; what is being done is being done to please the politicians , &quot; tartly summarized the usually cheery Milkha Singh , 63 , the &quot; Flying Sikh &quot; whose 3-decade-old national records for the 200 and 400 meters have never been bested . &quot; Indian officials are sitting between two stools &quot; in sports , Puri said . &quot; They didn ' t know whether to follow the socialist model where the state tried to control athletics , or the Western market system. &quot; The hybrid result has proven ineffective . Since India is a democracy , it could not , like China , take children away from their families to hone their talents . But since sports is considered an affair of government , worthy of its own ministry , bureaucrats inexorably came_to head India ' s sporting federations . &quot; The bureaucracy has killed sports in this country , &quot; Shekhar Gupta , senior editor of India Today and a lifelong sports buff , complained . &quot; All the budget gets eaten_up by the Indian Sports Authority . It ' s run_by IAS ( Indian Administrative Service ) officers who know as little about sports as I do about semiconductors. &quot; For Gupta , it ' s people like the courtly Kanti Chodhary , 75 , a member of the elite IAS , who epitomize the problem . The elderly civil_servant has been chosen to head the Fencing Assn . of India , but acknowledges that the only blade he knows how to wield is a razor . Some , including Puri , see India ' s mediocrity as a reflection of far deeper problems , especially low economic and social development . &quot; The fact is , we are poor in sport . And we are poor in sport because we are a poor nation , &quot; he explained . Tens of millions of his compatriots don ' t get enough to eat , let alone have access to special nutrition or sports medicine specialists , Puri notes , and it ' s also questionable whether the vegetarian diet mandated by Hinduism produces champions . He is also troubled by the ethos of his country , where a Vince Lombardi would hardly feel welcome . &quot; Our sacred books tell us to do our duty and not to worry about results , &quot; Puri said . &quot; Indian athletes generally lack the desire to be a world beater . And our coaches don ' t have the skills to put it into them. &quot; There are Indians who note that cricket , now the reigning passion , is played by millions of youngsters and that India does field good teams . Likewise , Indians fare well in other sports of somewhat blue-blooded pedigree , including tennis , golf and billiards . That undoubtedly drains some talent . But a homebred Olympic champion is all it would take_for people to become interested in other kinds of sport , Puri said . The vision of a better future , some hope , is now rising on the dun-colored Deccan plateau outside the city of Pune . In a 300-day building blitzkrieg , workers erected the Shri Shiv Chhatrapati Sports City , including a flood-lit stadium with synthetic track , a velodrome , an Olympic-sized pool and a Wimbledon-style tennis_court with galleries . A 1 # 000-apartment &quot; Sports Village &quot; to house athletes went_up in six months . &quot; This is going_to be our training grounds for future champions , &quot; brashly predicts Suresh Kalmadi , a former fighter_pilot turned member of India ' s Parliament and president of the Amateur Athletics Federation of India . The project was Kalmadi ' s brainchild and that of the powerful chief minister of Maharashtra , Sharad Pawar . And the stadium is only the beginning . Kalmadi foresees massive investment by private firms for the first time in the history of Indian athletics . He also wants to take_advantage of the demise of the Soviet_Union by putting some of its underemployed athletes under 10-year contract to supplement homebred coaching . The Maharashtra state_government plowed more_than $ 13 million into building the 200-acre sports complex . The Indian government chipped_in $ 1.6 million . With sweating women still carrying pails of dirt and broken rocks to the site to finish work_on the gymnasium , the National Games , the third such extravaganza in India ' s history , opened here in January . * But while nearly 5 # 000 athletes took_part in the 10-day meet , only a single national record was broken , in the women ' s 200-meter backstroke . Kalmadi points to the fact that the National Games marked the first time private sponsors were allowed to help bankroll the event -- in return for commercial consideration . There lies the decisive break_with India ' s past , Kalmadi says . Once powerful sponsors are involved , they will keep the federations &quot; on their toes &quot; and insist that the rupees they spend produce champions , he contends . To encourage private companies to foot more of the bill for sports development , the Indian government has devised a scheme to make company contributions tax-free . Kalmadi promises no miracles by the time the next summer Olympiad rolls_around in Atlanta in 1996 . &quot; The gap between other countries and our country is widening , &quot; he said . &quot; Forget the international level . In the next 10 years , let ' s talk_about reaching the Asian level. &quot; In America , as well as countries with monolithic state-run sports programs like China , sports are often a stepping stone to a job , even to prosperity . In India , that is rarely the case -- another factor discouraging participation . Paradoxically , those athletes who do win secure positions often seem to lose their hunger to excel . P.T. Usha , acknowledged as India ' s top sportswoman , is an example of the promise and problems of Indian sports . She trained as a teen-ager by running barefoot on the beach . The Kerala woman was fourth in the 400-meter hurdles at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics , missing a medal by a hundredth of a second . She never bettered that time . Instead of being coached to focus_on Seoul in 1988 , Usha ' s talent was squandered to soothe Indians ' bruised egos . At the 1985 Asian Track_and_Field Championships , she was entered in nearly every race within her range , and won five golds and a bronze . Since then , Usha has given_birth to a son , now nearly 2 . And she is dreaming of a comeback . She intends to begin racing competitively in June or July in the 400 meters , with her eye on the Asian games in Hiroshima in October . that ' s the event Indian fans will be watching to see if their years of Olympic medal deprivation are over . Does Usha dream of winning at Atlanta ? &quot; Maybe , &quot; she says . &quot; I ' ll see how I perform now. &quot; Second String The most recent Asian Games , in September , 1990 , were humiliating for India , indicating that the country was not even a regional force in sports . It took just one gold medal . Medal totals China : 341 South_Korea : 181 Japan : 174 North_Korea : 82 Taiwan : 31 India : 23 Source : Competition Success Review Year Book , 1993 , New Delhi .</TEXT>
