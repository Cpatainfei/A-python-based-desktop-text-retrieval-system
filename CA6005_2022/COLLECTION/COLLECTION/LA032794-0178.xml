   <HEADLINE> ' I WAS LOOKING FOR BEAUTY AND FOUND IT '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Richard Avedon was singing as he stepped into his New York studio -- &quot; Stage_Fright , &quot; an old tune by the Band with its protagonist &quot; who got caught in the spotlight. &quot; That was in October , and the photographer felt something like that himself . He had just appeared on three national television networks and been a featured subject in several international magazines , talking endlessly about the photographs he ' s made_over the past five decades , portraits of the great and terrible , of artists , writers , performers , athletes , leaders and unknowns . &quot; I ' m turning_into this media nut , &quot; he said then . &quot; I ' m more comfortable on talk_shows now than I am in real_life , because the studio here is so chaotic that I ' d do anything to get_back on television , where everything is focused. &quot; Now it ' s five months later , and Avedon sits over a plate of chicken_tacos in Hollywood , rubbing his temples , on another wearying bi-coastal schedule . Last fall ' s tour was for the sake of &quot; An Autobiography , &quot; his epic collection of nearly 300 images , now in its second printing despite its $ 100 price and some scattered unfriendly reviews . Now there is &quot; Evidence &quot; ( Random House and Eastman Kodak ) , another retrospective of Avedon ' s most important work . This collection , all black_and_white , ranges from rediscovered pictures of 1940s Harlem to portraits of his dying father , which Avedon hopes communicate an underlying view on death and beauty , comedy and horror . If &quot; An Autobiography &quot; was the photographer ' s vision of_his_own history , &quot; Evidence &quot; offers a less subjective view and serves as the catalogue to a museum retrospective of the same name that opened Thursday at the Whitney in New York and that will come_to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in the summer of 1995 . Not that these retrospectives mean the photographer has come_to the end of a long and sometimes controversial career . In 1992 , Avedon signed_on as the first staff photographer for the New Yorker , where his newest images have included a group portrait of gays in the military , surreal montages on the Academy Awards , and a somber series of portraits of survivors from the Kennedy years . On this trip to Hollywood , his schedule includes photographing Steven Spielberg for a New Yorker series on Hollywood players and breakfasting in Santa Barbara with former high-fashion model Suzi Parker -- their first reunion in 20 years . &quot; I ' m going_to trust certain people to say ' You ' ve lost_it , ' &quot; says Avedon , who turns 71 this year . &quot; You know , I ' m not going_to be photographing a tree out of the window , like ( Edward ) Steichen . At the moment I feel in full command . I ' m still , as always , concerned with what to do next and not repeating myself. &quot; He hints that he may even be tiring of the empty white backgrounds that have been a signature of many of his portraits and of such major projects as &quot; In the American West , &quot; his stark series of portraits of drifters , coal_miners , waitresses , migrant workers , truckers , adolescents and others across the rural Western states . &quot; I could stop right now , in terms of the work that expresses myself , &quot; he says . &quot; And I have a body_of_work that ' s fine . But I love the idea that maybe I could find a last stage that may go_on for 10 years , in which I would develop something completely new_to me , challenging to me. &quot; One option is a raw , deeply subjective style of documentary photography that he practiced in his montages of the Academy Awards and the 1991 Volpi Ball in Venice , Italy , billed as the last great aristocratic ball . Avedon ' s photographs from that event were intense and claustrophobic , presenting an ancient subculture caught in a desperate fade . &quot; You really felt the sinking ship , &quot; Avedon says . &quot; You just felt that this would never happen again. &quot; Both &quot; Evidence &quot; and &quot; An Autobiography &quot; include a ghostly scene from Berlin ' s Brandenburg Gate , New Year ' s Eve 1989 , when East and West Germany were welded back together in a celebration the photographer found frightening . Other photographs from that frantic six-hour shoot captured a night sky filled with rockets and pistol-fire , young_men climbing walls and signposts and raising champagne bottles to their lips . Not a_few celebrants are caught with expressions of horror , their faces grossly over-lit , as if caught in a searchlight . &quot; Kids were climbing the scaffolding to get_up on the top of the bridge , and it fell -- three people died , &quot; Avedon recalls . &quot; They were throwing bottles and cherry_bombs or something . Bottles were crashing down with the excitement of it , and it was really dangerous . And you can see that in some of these faces. &quot; With these pictures , Avedon has arrived_at the edge of something more biting and personal than his aborted documentary for Life magazine about Harlem in 1949 , published for the first time in his new book . But he ' s rarely been accepted as a true believer in photojournalism by critics , who sneer at his roots as a fashion photographer and his decades of work for Harper ' s Bazaar and Vogue . Avedon ' s early ' 80s pictures from the West earned some scathing reviews accusing him of taking an Eastern view of Westerners as haggard , hopeless and defeated . Some critics also questioned the fairness of the white backdrop , isolating his subjects from their natural surroundings , his 8-by-10 view camera presenting their human flaws with a cruel precision . And there was Avedon ' s willingness to set_up and pose his subjects , as he did for a striking image of a hairless and shirtless beekeeper he covered with bees to create a precise design . &quot; Those are other people ' s ideas and other people ' s rules , &quot; he says of his critics . &quot; When I started , the high road was ( Henri ) Cartier-Bresson ' s you do not crop an image at all , &quot; says Avedon . When he began at Harper ' s Bazaar in 1945 under the tutelage of art_director Alexey Brodovitch , Avedon says , &quot; I started retouching , cropping , all from Brodovitch . I learned from him there was no difference between a camera and a paintbrush. &quot; Almost from the beginning of his professional career , Avedon has experimented with a variety of photographic genres , from fashion work to photojournalism , often succeeding in bringing some personal vision to a given style . So in 1972 , he could capture an elegant and serene Groucho Marx or spend a frenzied afternoon with pianist Oscar Levant the same year as he was documenting his father ' s final days . Avedon ' s best fashion pictures found an elegant reality , incorporating the drama and blur of life ' s action . &quot; When it told something about the nature of being a woman in_relation_to their looks , and the anxiety that went_with that -- something I knew about clothes and women and facades -- that contradiction made me a strong fashion photographer. &quot; Likewise , Avedon ' s self-portraits reveal a serious presence , the unblinking artist , rather than the pleasant host he is in interviews . For him , flattery is photography ' s least-welcome vulgarity . &quot; My self-portraits , the ones that I ' ve shown so far , don ' t differ from my portraits of anyone else , &quot; he says over the restaurant clamor . &quot; The confusion is in confusing a man ' s work with his real_life . Art is art and real_life is real_life . Otherwise you ' d just have these endless videos of people chatting. &quot; It is his portraiture that has remained the backbone of his work , in spite of his influence on fashion and accomplishments in other genres , says Jane Livingston , guest curator of the &quot; Evidence &quot; exhibition . &quot; I just don ' t think you can look_at photographic portraiture without an awareness of what Dick has done , &quot; Livingston says , noting that generations of photographers , from Irving Penn to Annie Leibovitz and beyond , have felt Avedon ' s influence , &quot; not only because the work has been so widely seen , but also because it is so distinctive. &quot; In addition , she says of Avedon ' s work , &quot; There is this prodigious kind of variety and this mastery of many , many things . There are few , few photographers who have done that . I think_of Irving Penn , I think_of ( Eugene ) Atget , of Steichen , of Bernice Abbott . There are a_few , but I think he belongs in that company. &quot; Both books connect all these facets of his photography in a way Avedon says he could not express or argue until now . A pattern has emerged across the decades . &quot; You see that a black_woman walking through the streets of Harlem is not so different from someone walking through the streets of Paris , &quot; he says . &quot; I was looking_for beauty and found it. &quot; That continuing variety of visual interests is reflected on the top floor of his New York studio , a red-brick converted laundry building , where he ' s worked for 20 years . There his own framed and unframed pictures are scattered along the walls with works by his onetime rival Penn and other photographers . He ' s collected images since he was an adolescent and they remain a resource for inspiration . But Avedon has been buried under the weight of_his_own past these last two years , printing and cataloguing all_of his work , beginning with 1945 . The first results are the two books and the museum show , to be followed by a book on the 1960s next year and a series of four &quot; teaching books. &quot; His reasons for summing_up his career now , as he is in the midst of one of his busiest periods , are simple . &quot; I just wanted to do_it before they do_it to me , &quot; he says . &quot; You never know when you ' re going to be a geezer . It could happen tomorrow morning. &quot; Barring that , Avedon expects to continue as before , making portraits and documentary photographs for the New Yorker , or fashion pictures for the designer Versace . His name is usually enough now to win a sitting with virtually any subject who interests him , as revealing as his camera can be . &quot; If someone decides not to give anything , and be suspicious of me , then it ' s a picture of someone who ' s suspicious , &quot; he says . &quot; that ' s terrific . &quot;</TEXT>
