   <HEADLINE> POSTSCRIPT ; WAR AND REMEMBRANCE ; COMMEMORATION OF BATTLE OF THE BULGE BRINGS THANKS TO AMERICANS . SOME WONDER IF SUCH EMOTIONAL MEMORIALS DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. and Belgian flags fluttered from every building along the main_street of this small market_town in the heart of Belgium ' s picturesque Ardennes hills . From temporary loudspeakers , Glen Miller ' s &quot; In the Mood &quot; wafted along the thoroughfare , riding_on an icy late autumn wind . Metal crowd barriers lined the sidewalks , and television crews prepared_for the parade . In an hour , a_few hundred U.S. veterans and a handful of Belgian comrades would march through a freezing rain to the cheers of local residents . Another World_War_II 50th anniversary was unfolding . This time , on Friday , the commemoration marked the beginning of the monthlong Battle_of_the_Bulge , a bitter engagement that military historians describe as both the U.S. Army ' s single biggest battle of the war and &quot; the last act of the great liberation. &quot; While the Bastogne ceremonies paled in comparison to the global media spectacle that accompanied the D-day celebrations in Normandy last June , it was an important event for Belgians and those Americans who fought here . In its way , it was also far more typical of the string of World_War_II commemorations that have unfolded across Europe since 1989 : It was a chance for local people to remember the heroes , the victims and the suffering connected to battles that determined the fate of their region . As the Continent braces for the culmination of these events next year with the 50th anniversaries of both Nazi Germany ' s unconditional surrender in early May and the end of the war against Japan in August , the emotional swath left by commemorations over the last five years has raised questions about whether such intensely emotional reminders do more harm than good . Many , for example , argued that June ' s Normandy celebrations , which excluded Germany , achieved little more_than to remind Germans that 45 years of successful democracy isn ' t enough for redemption , that they still remain apart , uninvited outsiders in Western Europe . &quot; You have to bring the Germans in , &quot; warned Michael Stuermer , director of a government-backed think_tank near Munich called the Ebenhausen Institute . &quot; There can be no more D-days. &quot; French President Francois Mitterrand ' s attempt to compensate for the D-day anniversary snub by allowing German armored vehicles to roll_down the Champs-Elysees as part of the_French National Day military parade merely triggered an embarrassing debate in France about where Germans should or should not go half a century after the Nazi collapse . Americans got a similar taste of such sensitivity earlier this month when a U.S. Postal Service decision to issue a commemorative stamp depicting the atomic mushroom_clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki created outrage in Japan . Following a formal diplomatic protest , the Postal Service shelved the idea . Others , however , claim that remembering is too important to be derailed by the pain of reviving old memories . &quot; It ' s important to celebrate the past , because it ' s the only way we can learn from it , &quot; said Dominique Moisi , deputy director of the_French Institute of International Relations in Paris . In Bastogne , there was evidence for both arguments . Here , as at the D-day beaches , half a century was too soon to include German officials in a way that might have made the commemoration also an act of reconciliation . &quot; Two generations have passed , but if you say you are German , people still step back , &quot; said Catherine Orban , a local schoolteacher . &quot; Fifty years is too soon ( to include the Germans ) . &quot; Guy Arend , the founder and director of the town ' s two museums that deal with the Battle_of_the_Bulge , added : &quot; I ' m still afraid of the Germans. &quot; But Robert Marbehant , a retired teacher and civil_servant who lives_in the Ardennes , said that commemorative ceremonies become more important with the passage of time . &quot; They are an occasion for documents and memories to be written_down and published , &quot; he said . &quot; The people who lived through the events are getting so old now that we need to do this before it gets too late. &quot; He also sees such commemorations as lessons in civil responsibility by underscoring the fact that people risked their lives for others . For a new generation of West Europeans born into an era of enormous affluence that encourages self-indulgence , it is an important message . &quot; If anniversaries are a time for remembering , they are also a time for reflection , &quot; Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , told a group of dignitaries gathered for the occasion . Albright represented the United States at the official ceremonies . But another lesson for a new generation of Europeans is the role the United States played in helping the Continent win_back its freedom . &quot; What the Americans did here goes_far beyond commercial interest , &quot; Marbehant said . &quot; Those who have an exact memory of events , the memory of being freed , they will always see the Americans with different eyes. &quot; Here , in the rolling hills of the Ardennes , that message is being carefully passed_on . At St . Joseph ' s boys school , for example , veterans correspond with students , who then read their letters aloud in class . And although the GIs who fought in and around Bastogne as young_men now walk slowly and some require canes , they are still seen here with a mixture of respect and awe . &quot; The children here see the Americans as godlike , &quot; Orban said . &quot; They came and saved everyone. &quot; While that is exactly what they did , the price was horrific . More_than 19 # 000 GIs died in the battle , which contained and then repulsed the Germans ' final offensive of the war during the freezing weeks of late December , 1944 , and January , 1945 . More_than 57 # 000 other Americans were listed as missing or wounded . Before the Nazi offensive was finally crushed in late January , an estimated 120 # 000 Germans had also died -- twice the number who fell_in northern France trying to repel the initial Allied invasion . During the height of the battle , German forces encircled Bastogne for several days , hoping to take the important road and rail junction by strangling the U.S. 101st Airborne Division defending the town . In one of the shortest , most famous statements of the war , Gen . Anthony McAuliffe rejected a German offer to surrender with a single word : &quot; Nuts. &quot; A few days later , Gen . George Patton led a U.S. assault from the south that broke_through the German ring and ended the siege of Bastogne . But it was a month more before the last German resistance in the Ardennes was broken . Bastogne Mayor Guy Lutgen told a group of U.S. veterans who had traveled_to Belgium for the commemoration : &quot; We will never forget what you did for us. &quot; Researcher Isabelle Maelcamp at The Times ' Brussels Bureau contributed to this article .</TEXT>
