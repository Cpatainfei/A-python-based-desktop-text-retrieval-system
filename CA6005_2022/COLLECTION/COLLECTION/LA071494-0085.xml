   <HEADLINE> GOOD COOKING : LIBERTE , EGALITE AND MOUSSAKA ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new bistro boom is_on in Paris . Many of the top chefs have opened at least one casual counterpart to their more serious restaurants . Guy Savoy , Michel Rostang , Claude Terrail , Joel Robuchon and Jacques Cagna have all jumped_on this bandwagon of reasonably priced spin-offs -- reasonably priced at least in comparison to their super-high-priced Michelin star-rated restaurants . Jacques Cagna has now opened two bistros : Rotisserie d ' en Face around the corner from his Michelin two-starred Jacques Cagna , and La Rotisserie d ' Armaille . Rotisserie d ' en Face is especially beckoning with its beautifully paneled interior and delicious $ 35 prix-fixe three-course menu . Enjoy a house-baked five-grain bread with a variety of starters , fish , meat and rotisserie dishes , especially chicken and lamb , in addition to dishes typically associated with French home cooking . Desserts range from a warm Alsatian apple tart to a warm chocolate fondant . Since today is Bastille Day , celebrate with your own bistro fare . The following recipes are adapted from Jacques Cagna ' s Rotisserie d ' en Face . Start with a plate of smoked salmon and horseradish chive cream as a leisurely introduction to the main dish -- a casserole of eggplant , lamb , tomato and onion -- which Cagna suggests serving with a green_salad tossed_in a walnut_oil vinaigrette . The dessert , a simple gratin of bananas , is a perfect conclusion . * Salmon that is gently smoked and lightly salted works perfectly with the horseradish chive cream . Cagna serves his house-smoked salmon with a scoop of the cream placed in the center of the plate and a three-inch round blini tucked on the side . You can also serve the salmon with thin slices of toasted baguette . Whipping the cream in a food_processor yields denser cream . But you have to be careful . The machine works fast , and if you let_it_go too long , the cream may turn_to butter . If you are using a mixer , whip the cream until it ' s really thick . SMOKED SALMON WITH HORSERADISH-CHIVE CREAM 3 / 4 pound thinly sliced smoked salmon Horseradish-Chive Cream 1 tablespoon snipped chives Thinly sliced rounds of baguette or triangles of thin firm bread , lightly toasted and warm , or blini , optional Arrange salmon attractively on 6 chilled salad_plates , dividing evenly . Drain off any liquid from Horseradish Chive Cream that may have accumulated during refrigeration . Shape cream into smooth oval with large soup_spoon and place on center of plate . Sprinkle with snipped chives . Place toasted bread on side of plate . Serve immediately . Makes 6 servings .

Horseradish-Chive Cream 1 cup whipping cream , well-chilled 2 tablespoons snipped chives 1 tablespoon well-drained white horseradish 2 tablespoons sour_cream 1 / 2 teaspoon fresh lemon_juice Whip cream until very thick_with food_processor or mixer . Transfer to 2-cup bowl . Gently fold in chives , horseradish , sour_cream and lemon_juice . Chill at least 4 hours or overnight for mixture to firm_up . * This is a surprisingly light and mild moussaka that goes very well with a salad of mixed greens tossed_in a walnut_oil vinaigrette . Cagna fries the eggplant in oil but I found that it takes less time , attention and oil to broil the eggplant . You can choose which method to use . Also , the bistro ' s moussaka is molded into individual portions and presentations . Here , I ' ve made_it in one easy large shape . BISTRO D ' EN FACE ' S MOUSSAKA 2 1 / 2 medium eggplants , peeled , cut_into 1 / 3-inch-thick lengthwise slices 5 tablespoons olive_oil Salt Freshly ground pepper 2 large cloves garlic , minced 1 medium onion , minced 6 medium firm but ripe tomatoes , juiced , seeded and coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons tomato_paste 2 pounds ground lean lamb 1 teaspoon ground cumin Arrange eggplant in single layer on baking sheets . Heat 2 tablespoons oil . Lightly brush eggplant with hot oil . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Broil about 6 inches from heat source until browned , about 4 1 / 2 minutes . Turn slices . Brush with hot oil . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Broil until browned , about 3 minutes . Set_aside until cool enough to handle . Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat . When hot , add garlic , onion , chopped tomatoes and tomato_paste . Stir well . Cook , uncovered , until mixture has cooked down and is thick , about 10 minutes . Turn heat_up to evaporate any remaining liquid . Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 10-inch non-stick skillet . When hot , add lamb and cumin . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Cook , uncovered , until lamb is cooked through and brown , about 5 minutes . Drain off any excess liquid that may accumulate in pan . Add drained lamb to tomato mixture . Adjust seasonings to taste . To assemble , arrange eggplant slices in shallow 8-cup baking dish . Place slices in overlapping spokes , meeting at center , extending beyond edge of baking dish . Fill_in any spaces with pieces of eggplant so that base is solid . Once moussaka is inverted , this will be top surface . Add tomato-lamb mixture . Use rubber spatula to smooth_out and gently compact . Fold any extending pieces of eggplant back onto meat mixture . Cover with foil . Can be made to this point_up to 2 days in_advance and refrigerated . Bring to room_temperature before reheating . Bake at 400 degrees on center oven rack , uncovered , until very hot and lightly browned , about 40 minutes . Let stand 10 minutes on cooling rack . Drain off any accumulated juices . Place heated serving platter over dish . Gently reverse and unmold moussaka . Use serrated knife to cut moussaka into serving portions and metal spatula to transfer to dinner_plate . Serve hot or warm . Makes 6 servings . Each serving contains about : 471 calories ; 134 mg sodium ; 83 mg cholesterol ; 38 grams fat ; 12 grams carbohydrates ; 21 grams protein ; 1.45 grams fiber . * Here , bananas are the star of the simplest preparation . Served warm with a scoop of vanilla_ice_cream or frozen vanilla yogurt , it ' s a most satisfying dessert . The bananas need to be ripe for the best texture and flavor . JACQUES CAGNA ' S WARM BANANA GRATIN 8 firm but ripe bananas , thinly sliced 2 tablespoons melted butter 6 tablespoons powdered sugar Vanilla_ice_cream or frozen vanilla yogurt Divide bananas among 6 greased 1 1 / 2-cup souffle dishes , overlapping evenly and attractively .

Before cooking , evenly press powdered sugar through fine sieve to cover surface , about 1 tablespoon per gratin . Bake on center oven rack at 400 degrees until bananas are very warm , about 8 minutes . Turn oven to broil and move baking sheet to within 8 inches of heat source . Broil until surface lightly browns , about 2 minutes more . To serve , place 1 small scoop of ice_cream on warm gratin . Serve immediately . Makes 6 servings .
