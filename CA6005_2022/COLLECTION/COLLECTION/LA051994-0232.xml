   <HEADLINE> 1ST GENETICALLY ALTERED FOOD APPROVED BY FDA ; AGRICULTURE : CALGENE TOMATOES COULD BE IN SOME STORES IN 10 DAYS . FOES TO LAUNCH CAMPAIGN AGAINST PRODUCT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time , the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved a genetically engineered food , clearing the way for a Davis , Calif. , company to sell its laboratory-designed tomato . Calgene Inc. said the tomato , designed with its &quot; FlavrSavr &quot; gene and bearing its MacGregor label , could be in food stores in 10 days , with consumers in the Midwest and parts of California getting the first chances to buy them . The tomato is billed as better tasting ; it can be ripened on the vine and will stay_fresh longer . The FDA ' s long-anticipated approval ends a five-year process and gives_birth to a new era of food production that supporters contend will lead to more nutritious and environmentally safer -- and potentially less costly -- ways to feed the world ' s hungry . It was also a signal for opponents to launch what they vowed would be a vigorous , nationwide campaign urging consumers not to buy the tomato or any other genetically engineered food . The FDA said the Calgene tomato is just as safe as conventionally bred tomatoes . &quot; We have approached our review of this product with scientific rigor and a commitment to full , public disclosure of that science , &quot; FDA Commissioner David Kessler said in a statement . &quot; Consumers can be confident that we remain committed to assuring that foods produced by genetic_engineering are as safe as food in our grocery_stores today. &quot; The tomato was developed using Calgene ' s patented &quot; antisense &quot; technology : The tomato ' s gene that initiates rotting was cloned and reinserted in reverse , thus slowing the rotting process . This antisense technology could be used to neutralize rotting or other undesirable traits in other crops as well . Such tools of genetic_engineering are allowing developers to modify plants faster and with greater precision than traditional methods of cross-breeding plants or animals for desired traits . Calgene ' s ability to disseminate the FDA ' s assurances of safety and win consumer acceptance of the tomato is seen as a critical first_step in developing a market for the next generations of genetically engineered food_products . As_many as 50 genetically modified crops -- including insect-resistant corn and potatoes that absorb less fat when fried -- are in various stages of development , although none has been submitted for FDA review . Several organizations of produce growers and grocers , and other companies working to develop food crops through laboratory manipulation of genes , praised the FDA action , calling it a boon for consumers . On the other hand , three public-interest groups Wednesday expressed their disappointment , particularly with the FDA ' s reiteration that it would not require explicit labeling of genetically engineered foods or products made from them . The Union of Concerned Scientists and the Environmental Defense Fund decried as inadequate the agency ' s oversight of genetically engineered foods , contending that future products might pose health and safety risks that would be overlooked by the agency . Those groups again called_for labeling regulations , saying that future products might contain substances harmful to some consumers . The FDA has said its process for reviewing all foods has built-in safeguards , regardless of the process used to develop them . Another opponent , the Pure Food Campaign , a group led by longtime biotechnology foe Jeremy Rifkin , vowed to file suit against the FDA because of its review policies , and to organize boycotts and tomato-dumping demonstrations as its initial salvos in a &quot; tomato war. &quot; Rifkin urges a longer safety testing period and mandatory labeling . Roger Salquist , who as Calgene ' s chief_executive has shepherded the tomato through the precedent-setting and often-frustrating approval process , was in a celebratory mood Wednesday . &quot; The consumer who wants a better-tasting tomato . . . ( doesn ' t ) want to be dictated to . . . as_to what they can and can ' t buy_in a supermarket , &quot; Salquist said . The Grocery Manufacturers of America , the largest trade group of companies that manufacture and market brand-name grocery products , again affirmed its support of the FDA approval process and the use of biotechnology in the development of food_products . However , individual grocery chains and stores , as well as distributors and restaurateurs , will be taking careful note of consumer reaction , especially in light of the response to a Pure Food Campaign-led drive this year against bovine somatotropin , a biotech drug designed to increase cows ' milk production . When the FDA approved the Monsanto-developed drug for_sale this year , Rifkin ' s group successfully persuaded dozens of grocery chains around the country to pledge not to accept dairy_products from cows treated with the drug . On Wednesday , some Southern California produce distributors said Calgene ' s tomato will face stiff competition from new varieties of vine-ripened tomatoes that , although selling at a premium above artificially ripened tomatoes , will still cost less than Calgene ' s MacGregors . Calgene ' s tomatoes could be priced as high as $ 2.50 a pound , twice that of many premium , traditionally bred tomatoes . Still , Calgene expects that within three years , its tomato will have captured 15 % of the $ 3.5-billion market for fresh tomatoes . That would mean $ 500 million in sales -- far outstripping the estimated $ 25 million to $ 30 million cost of developing the tomato . Ironically , Calgene ' s biggest hurdle in selling the tomato may be of its own doing . Farmers contracted by Calgene to grow the tomato did not plant enough acreage , Salquist said , &quot; because we didn ' t know when the approval would come through. &quot; There will be small quantities of the tomatoes available for the next six weeks in as yet unspecified markets in California and the Midwest . After that , there could be a small gap in availability until the company is able to increase harvests , Salquist said .</TEXT>
