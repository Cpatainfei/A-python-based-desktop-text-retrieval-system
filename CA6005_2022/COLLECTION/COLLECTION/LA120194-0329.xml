   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; OVER A BARREL ; OIL-DRILLING DAYS MAY BE NUMBERED ON ARTIFICIAL ISLANDS OFF LONG_BEACH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Palms and banana_trees rustling in the ocean breeze . Hibiscus and impatiens in bloom . White_water tumbling into the sea . It ' s a perfect little tropical island -- in the middle of Long_Beach Harbor . But step off the boat and you see that it ' s all a facade , propped_up with struts and cable , like the television_set of &quot; Gilligan ' s Island. &quot; This granite atoll -- one of four in the harbor -- isn ' t graced with grass shacks , it ' s gridlocked with pipelines and storage vats . Inside the fringe of palm_trees , men and women in hard_hats scoot around on forklifts or lug heavy pipes . Someone flips a switch and the waterfall dribbles to a stop . The real reason for all_of the hardware on Grissom , as this island is called , can be observed off to the edge , where a technician in a trailer studies a video monitor . The picture , supplied by a tiny television_camera 5 # 200 feet beneath the surface , shows shiny black globules , clustering like grapes , skittering along the rim of a pipe toward the surface in an odd , bouncy motion . Crude_oil . Oil has been a part of Long_Beach for more_than 70 years -- a get-rich-quick medium , then a source of urban blight as messy oil derricks proliferated and a large swatch of Long_Beach real_estate began to sink alarmingly . Now , almost 800 million barrels later , it ' s a mostly clean , smooth-running operation on four &quot; tropical &quot; islands and a mainland platform , using a motivated crew of 200 ( &quot; Where else can you work_on an island in the Pacific and go_home at night ? &quot; said one engineer ) and all_the smart drilling technology . But its days appear to be numbered . The so-called Long_Beach unit , stretching from downtown Long_Beach out into the harbor , was producing about 150 # 000 barrels of oil a day in the 1960s . Now it turns_out a lean 47 # 000 barrels with a host of new mining techniques to scour each nook_and_cranny for undiscovered oil . There ' s still a lot of the black stuff down there , experts say , but some oil_companies are thinking_about the day they pack it in . Some already have . Two months ago , three companies looked_at the balance_sheet in Long_Beach and decided they weren ' t going_to pay any more royalties to the city ' s 13 # 000 &quot; townlotters , &quot; the individuals who own the mineral rights to the real_estate properties sitting on top of a small portion of the oil field . &quot; It was inevitable that there would come a time when the working interest owners ( the oil_companies ) would start losing money , &quot; said Arco official Steve Freeman . &quot; We ' re at that point now. &quot; As lessors of the mineral rights , the oil_companies , which have been paying as much as 49 % of the profits to the townlotters , always had the prerogative to pull_out when profits got skimpy . It was written into their leases , oil_company officials say . Arco , owner of THUMS Long_Beach Co. , which manages the oil field , will continue to be involved in the production part of the business . But Phillips Petroleum will stay only as a minor investor , and Chevron is pulling_out completely . The announcement sent the townlotters , most of them heirs and small investors who had been reaping an average of $ 350 a year , scrambling to their calculators . Starting this month , if the townlotters -- about 13 # 000 of them -- want to hold onto their claims , they ' ll have to ante_up a proportionate share of the oil field ' s operating_costs , just like any other investor hoping for profits . The townlotters ' share of the operating_costs would average about $ 92 a year , according to oil_company officials . The so-called townlot , the portion of the oil field that lies under the city , represents about 8 % of the Long_Beach unit . If townlotters stick_around until the operation closes_down , they ' ll have to bear a share of the multimillion-dollar shutdown costs , according to the terms of the lease agreements with the oil_companies . &quot; The longer you stay in , the more exposed you are to having to help pay_for the abandonment of the field , &quot; said Mel Wright , whose wife , Jonine , shares the mineral rights to a small piece of property in the Belmont Shore area . &quot; Every day that goes_by , it gets a little closer. &quot; The alternative is to sell to other investors or just abandon their claims . The dilemma of the townlotters highlights a $ 64 # 000 question being asked by everybody with a stake in the unique urban oil field , which is still studied by visiting oil technicians from around the world : How long can it continue to produce oil profitably ? Xenophon C . Colazas , the city ' s director of oil properties , thinks there are more_than 10 good years left . &quot; that ' s my opinion , of course , &quot; says Colazas , a petroleum engineer who has worked in the Long_Beach unit for 34 years . &quot; It all depends_on economics. &quot; One part of economics is the price of oil , which has been holding at a modest $ 13.50 a barrel for several months , but which dipped to a measly $ 8.50 last December . In 1990 , as Iraq invaded Kuwait , Long_Beach oil brought $ 24 a barrel . &quot; If it goes the way it did_in December , &quot; says Wright , a former oil_company executive who works as a petroleum consultant , &quot; they ' ll have to abandon the field . This is a business . People are in it to make money. &quot; Nevertheless , THUMS ( an acronym for Texaco , Humble , Union , Mobil and Shell , the five companies that combined in 1964 to bid on leasing the field ) continues to put money into the oil islands in an effort to sop_up every sticky drop of crude down there . * In recent years , for example , the company has begun using sophisticated drilling_bits that can cut sideways into once-inaccessible pockets of oil . Technicians are using new solvents that dissolve crusty asphalts to free the flow of crude and are employing computer_programs that monitor flows and pressure buildups in the wells . All of these , along with an aggressive drilling program , increased productivity last year by 2 # 500 barrels a day , from about 44 # 500 , THUMS officials say . Area supervisor Chris Hartman stands over a computer monitor in a little_office and scans a graphic showing water pressure and production rates for the more_than 300 wells on Grissom . ( The islands are named for four astronauts who died in accidents in 1967 , three in the notorious launch-pad fire of that year , including Virgil I . ( Gus ) Grissom. ) &quot; We used to have to go_with a pressure_gauge from well to well and write the data down by hand , &quot; Hartman says . &quot; This frees you up_to do something more productive. &quot; But all_the new techniques and equipment can ' t get_around the increasingly watery mix that the wells are producing from the aging field . When drill_bits first cut_into the Long_Beach unit in 1965 , THUMS wells brought_up a rich , sludgy brew that was only 20 % water . Lately , wells on the oil islands have been bringing_up a thin gruel that is more_than 92 % water . &quot; The water cut increases as the field gets older , &quot; Colazas says . More water means more processing -- and higher power bills for a company that already spends more_than $ 22 million a year for electricity . * The oil_business has been very good to Long_Beach , which technically owns the Long_Beach unit , and to the state of California . City officials estimate that Long_Beach has pulled_in $ 433 million in revenue from the field in the past 55 years . Much of the city ' s profit , however , came_before 1964 , when the state Legislature , asserting that the city is only the state ' s trustee rather than sole beneficiary of the field , enacted legislation giving the state the lion ' s share of oil revenues . An earlier bill , using the same rationale , had allowed the state to seize $ 122 million in accumulated oil revenues from Long_Beach . Since 1964 , the state has drawn an estimated $ 4.3 billion from the Long_Beach unit ; the city has earned a relatively modest $ 246 million . This year , the city expects to get $ 1 million in tidelands oil revenues , plus about $ 3 million in interest from a fund set_up to pay to prevent land above the field from sinking , an occurrence known as subsidence . The state stands to earn $ 41 million . There are still remnants of the early oil_business around town , but long gone are the black gushers , drilling towers and brawling roughnecks of the 1920s and 1930s . Nowadays , the city ' s oil_business apart from the Long_Beach unit consists_of a_few fields around the city , such_as those near Signal Hill , with seesawing oil_pumps called rocking horses . In June , 1921 , an 80-foot-high black geyser , which took four days to cap , marked the first productive oil_well in the city . By 1924 , Signal Hill ( which incorporated as a separate city that year ) sported a Sherwood Forest of derricks , with enormous Erector Set towers bristling across the_hill . But the first oil from the lucrative Wilmington field , which stretches from Wilmington to Seal Beach , wasn ' t drawn until 1939 , when a wildcatter touched_off a gusher on the west_side of town , near the present Pacific Coast Highway . It was soon clear that this was a monumental field -- the third largest in the United States -- and that its richest part was under Long_Beach Harbor . * As rig operators rushed to exploit the field , however , the spongy layers of shale and sandstone on which Long_Beach was built began to sink . By the late 1950s , a bowl-like cavity , 29 feet deep at its lowest point , had appeared around Terminal Island in the Port of Long_Beach . Buildings cracked , subterranean pipelines snapped and railroad_tracks twisted like paper clips . Removal of the oil was undermining the city . Geologists proposed injecting water into the subterranean cavities . An intensive program of injection quickly solved the problem , stabilizing the ground and , in some cases , raising it a_few inches . Independent operators who had resisted the program , thinking it would dilute their returns , found that injection often loosened hard-to-retrieve seams of oil . Like other cities , Long_Beach had resisted offshore drilling for aesthetic reasons . But in 1962 , voters approved a highly restrictive drilling referendum to exploit the rich deposits under the harbor . The referendum permitted offshore drilling as long as it was done from a series of small islands , landscaped to &quot; blend with the shoreline and add_to the natural beauty of the offshore area. &quot; The result was a Southern California solution to a messy problem . THUMS built an &quot; ersatz archipelago , &quot; as one writer described the islands , complete with Tahitian-looking panels to muffle machine noise and pastel-paneled &quot; condos &quot; to disguise drilling equipment . &quot; It ' s amazing the number of people who ask how they can stay in those hotels out there , &quot; says William Guerard , oil and gas supervisor for the state_Department of Conservation and a former field inspector in Long_Beach . * Their unusual appearance aside , the islands were monumental engineering achievements . More_than 640 # 000 tons of rock was barged_in from Catalina Island to form outer rims , and 3.6 million cubic_yards of sand was dredged_up to fill the centers . Since 1965 , 1 # 305 offshore wells have been drilled , about a quarter of them injection wells to prevent subsidence . Oil , water and gas are separated in huge vats , then the petroleum products are funneled into a network of 140 # 000 feet of steel pipeline that carries them to mainland refineries . The water is filtered to remove minerals and bacteria that might gunk up the drilling equipment , and reinjected . THUMS ' engineers , geologists , riggers and roustabouts are ferried from a dock near the Queen Mary to their stations on the islands . Behind one of those condo facades one recent day , workers guided 90-foot lengths of steel pipe , dangling from a winch , through a rotating platform . Thousands of feet below , a bit was drilling into the shale beneath the harbor , edging toward an untapped pocket of oil . &quot; It ' s deceptively quiet , &quot; said Stephen J . Marsh , THUMS ' community relations director . &quot; Everything ' s two miles into the ground. &quot; Other workers studied control_panels , repaired equipment or tended to the island ' s tropical foliage . Working on an island becomes just part of the routine after a while , THUMS workers say . &quot; There ' s just one difference , &quot; said Terry Barber , production engineer on Grissom . &quot; That old saying , ' If you miss the boat , you ' re in_trouble , ' is literally true here. &quot; * The company ' s 60-foot crew boat runs once an hour , except in bad_weather , during which it has been known to shut_down altogether . Veteran THUMS employees still reminisce about the storm of March , 1983 , when waves rolled_over the southernmost island and a handful of workers remained stranded overnight . THUMS officials claim they run a squeaky-clean operation , with no oil or chemical spills . But some environmentalists think it may be too clean . There is &quot; circumstantial_evidence &quot; that detergents used to clean_up minor oil leaks on the islands have been washing into the ocean and killing fish and other forms of life in the surrounding water , says Rimmon C . Fay , a marine biologist and longtime authority on marine life in Southern California . &quot; A few miles away , in Alamitos Bay , there ' s an extraordinary diversity of marine life , &quot; Fay says . &quot; Look_around the oil islands , and it ' s just not there. &quot; Oil investors worry about the costs of environmental requirements . When drilling operations stop , state conservation official Guerard says , the operators will be required to insert a series of cement plugs , to fill pipe casings with a kind of heavy mud used to lubricate drills and , finally , to weld steel caps over the mouth of the wells . After equipment is dismantled , the asphalt covering will have to be peeled away and , if there ' s any oil in the island cores , the sand will have to be dug_out and transported to landfills . The estimated cost for all this : $ 145 million . And long after drilling is shut_down , Colazas adds , the city will have to monitor ground_levels to ensure that subsidence does not begin again . And then ? Presumably the islands become city parks , says Ralph S . Cryder , parks and recreation director . But there is no task_force planning for conversion of the islands , Cryder adds . &quot; When we find_out when they ' re going to cap all those things , we ' ll get busy and talk_about it. &quot; The $ 64 # 000 question being asked by everybody with a stake in the unique urban oil field -- studied by visiting oil technicians from around the world -- is : How long can it continue to produce oil profitably ?</TEXT>
