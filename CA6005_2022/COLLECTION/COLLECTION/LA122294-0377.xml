   <HEADLINE> SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY ; BRIDGING THE GAP ; WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCREASINGLY STRAPPED FOR MONEY , INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES ARE GIVING TIME AND MATERIALS . IN MANY CASES , FUND RAISING HAS BECOME A NECESSITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Once , in days that veteran educators remember well , South Bay school districts could not only pay to educate their stu dents , but they could send them on field trips , put_on school plays and teach music . &quot; I remember when I went_to Inglewood as a teacher in 1957 , we had after-school programs four days a week , school plays , field trips and fine_arts programs , &quot; said Kenneth L . Moffett , now superintendent of the Lennox school district . &quot; And the district paid_for it. &quot; Today , districts -- from the poorest South Bay areas to the most affluent -- rely_on outside sources to give students opportunities that cannot be funded by a 1990s school budget . Many districts are working to bridge the gap , but much of the private giving to schools is not in the form of a check . It comes_in volunteered time and goods . On any given day , including Saturdays and Sundays , volunteers throughout the South Bay are_on school campuses cleaning_rooms , tutoring , coaching students or installing equipment . Without legions of volunteers , corporate gifts and community service groups , students would not have computer labs or athletic equipment , academic tutoring or flourishing fine_arts programs . And some of the schools would be without equipment as basic as copy machines . Which means that superintendents , principals , teachers and librarians are_on the hustle , getting money , materials and volunteers from whatever sources seem most likely . Virtually all school districts in the South Bay solicit and receive contributions from the area ' s major aerospace , automobile , computer and oil_companies . Some of the districts have established education foundations that seek corporate money , plan major fund-raising events and help in a variety of other ways . For example , an education foundation has adopted a Carson school and works with students , parents and teachers to find items and services -- often from corporate sources -- that the school needs . In some wealthier communities , parents have joined to start nonprofit education foundations that have raised millions of dollars over the years . The money provides everything from computers to full-time writing tutors . The Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District has such a foundation , and Redondo Beach has its School Teams for Educational Partnerships , or STEP program , in which citizens and civic and business_leaders support schools by sponsoring programs , tutors , clubs and materials for the schools . The most popular business education course at the La Tijera School in Inglewood , meanwhile , is run_by former employees of Mattel , the El Segundo toy company famous for its Barbie dolls . Once a month , members of the Mattel Alumni Assn . teach a two-hour class on what skills students will need to be successful in business . Classes are heavy on visuals , props and , of course , toys . In the Mattel Alumni Life Skills program , lessons focus_on such topics as promotion , profit , personnel and even packaging . Students in the program sign a contract effectively making them part of a company , and deadlines for projects are rigorously enforced . Eighth-graders who have gone_through the first part of the program incorporate and produce a product they must design , package , market and sell . Recently , alumni Fred Held , Derek Gable and Lou Silberman asked Aki Umemoto , a producer of commercials for Mattel , to tell the class about his job . And if a 13-year-old had to describe the ideal job , it might sound a lot like what Umemoto , 39 , does for a living . &quot; See , I always loved cartoons , and I loved comic_books and films -- like ' The Twilight Zone , ' &quot; Umemoto said to a class of seventh-graders . &quot; So I wanted a job where I could combine all_of that. &quot; Umemoto gave the students storyboards for a commercial he put_together for Top Speed ( the fastest Hot Wheels ever ) , and turned_on a television . &quot; And it Jumps ! . . . at Top Speed ! Pow ! &quot; Umemoto yells as the cars whiz by on the screen . The students lean forward , entranced by the almost supernatural fun the youngsters in the commercial are having with the cars . After the class , Held , Gable and Silberman are delighted with the rapport between Umemoto and the students . The day ' s lesson was not only about effective advertising and commercials . &quot; See , we also want them to know that they can have fun working , &quot; said Gable , who worked_on teams that invented toys before leaving Mattel to start his own invention business . If the Life Skills course is a business class like no other , it ' s also one that most districts could not afford . If it had to pay_for the program , between the hours of labor and materials needed for the class , the Inglewood Unified School District would be out about $ 60 # 000 a year , Silberman said . The effects of Proposition 13 , the 1978 initiative that limited property_taxes , and Southern California ' s recent recession have combined to limit the amount_of_money the state passes along to schools . California ranks 47th in the nation in spending per student . A project at Curtiss Middle_School in Carson illustrates the breadth of need at many schools and the level of community and corporate response . Volunteers from Educare Foundation , a national nonprofit foundation based in Calabasas , went_to Curtiss and asked students and teachers what they needed most . The list is long , but in addition to supplying the office with some machinery , providing workshops for students and teachers , Educare heeded the request to help the students fix_up their bathrooms . With funding from the Gaylord and Dorothy Donnelly Foundation , Target Stores and Shell Oil , the foundation supplied paint , tools and instructions , and recruited students to do the work . By 8:30 on two recent Saturday mornings , volunteers were at the school , teaching students how to paint the walls and install doors in the boys ' and girls ' bathrooms . That same Saturday , the Palos Verdes Links , a social and service_club of 28 women who act_as mentors , were meeting with 30 Curtis eighth-graders they will work with next year . The Links spent about $ 20 # 000 in the 1993-94 school_year , taking 25 students on trips to San Francisco and Sacramento , where they saw the Assembly in session . * The program , called Links Implementing the Fulfillment of Education , provides math tutors , brings_in guest speakers , and takes the students on college and career explorations to UCLA , USC and Martin_Luther_King Jr. / Drew Medical_Center . The Links members gave each student a $ 25 U.S. Savings Bond and plan to give them a $ 50 bond this year . The volunteer efforts of Educare and the Links have been essential to offering opportunities to Curtiss students that they otherwise would not have , Principal William Elkins said . &quot; It has been very positive , very positive working with Educare , &quot; Elkins said . &quot; And the Links -- they ' re doing this because they care . There ' s no other reason. &quot; Occasionally schools such_as Curtiss and La Tijera hit the jackpot , and volunteers with time , expertise and money appear out_of_the_blue . But it is more common for schools to seek_out help . Virtually every school district in the South Bay relies_on corporate giving . The Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District raised $ 678 # 939 this year and $ 703 # 227 in 1993 . The El Segundo Unified and Hermosa Beach Unified districts have foundations devoted to raising money . Chevron , Allied Signal , Rockwell and Hughes are major contributors to the foundations . Redondo Beach Unified School District receives help from the Advanced Technology Consortium , GTE and Southern California Edison . Northrop has given more_than $ 25 # 000 to Hawthorne High_School in the last year and also donated a Ford 12-passenger propane-powered van . TRW donated 40 computers for computer art_classes to Centinela Valley schools , and Xerox gave $ 5 # 000 in copying supplies . Schools sometimes receive unsolicited help and gifts , but more often , teachers , parents , administrators and staff are_on the lookout for funds and materials . At San Pedro High_School , Sharon Ogomori , the school librarian , sent_out more_than 2 # 000 letters to companies and organizations asking them to donate their used computer equipment . Her campaign resulted in the donation of 19 computers . Impressed by her efforts , the Detwiler Foundation , based in La Jolla , matched the donations through its Computers for Schools program , giving the school another 19 computers . The Detwiler Foundation , a nonprofit organization founded in 1991 to provide solutions to California ' s technology gap , also provides computers to 18 other schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District . Contributors to Detwiler ' s program include Pacific Bell , GTE , IBM , CompUSA and Bank of America . &quot; San Pedro High_School is an excellent example of the grass-roots initiatives that are sprouting up all_over the state by schools participating in the Matching Challenge , &quot; said Diana Detwiler , the executive_director of Computers for Schools . Ogomori ' s experience shows that soliciting help is a major part of many district administrators ' jobs . &quot; I got_into education because I love kids , but basically I ' ve become the chief_executive of a nonprofit organization , &quot; said Moffett , the Lennox superintendent . Lennox has sought partnerships with the UCLA School_of_Medicine , Hughes and many other companies , agencies and schools , Moffett said . The total amount contributed to the district adds_up to 18 % to 20 % of the district ' s $ 24-million budget . Moffett , who was named national superintendent of the year by the National Assn . of School_Superintendents , said the emphasis on fund raising means that the definition of a good superintendent has changed . A superintendent does not just have a good relationship with the staff , supervise the curriculum and get parents involved . A good superintendent , much like a good university president , goes_out and gets money for the district . One of the most skilled , Moffett said , is Inglewood Supt . McKinley Nash . &quot; Mac is really good at that . He ' ll bring it in through a lot of corporations . You just watch Inglewood. &quot; Nash has only been at the helm in Inglewood since July , but long before his arrival , Inglewood schools had partnerships with organizations , companies and other private donors . After the results of the Los Angeles County Academic Decathlon were announced earlier this month , students and administrators at Morningside High_School in Inglewood were aglow because of the team ' s performance . The school didn ' t win , or even place in the top 20 . But with seven weeks of preparation -- compared to the eight months or so that more affluent schools spend shaping a team -- the school added almost 4 # 000 points to last year ' s score and won the title of most-improved school in the county . Also , Principal Liza Daniels ' daughter , Portia , and Yeni Menendez both won bronze medals in the Super Quiz portion of the decathlon . With a little more time , a little more money and a chance to prepare as much as wealthier districts do , Morningside could be a winner in the future , officials said . &quot; The only difference is money , &quot; Daniels said . And money did help make the difference . Members of the Morningside team studied the 10 requisite subjects for the decathlon every morning before school , but about $ 11 # 000 in donated gifts and services provided weekend seminars and excursions to bolster their learning . * William Cathers , a consultant with the U.S. Decathlon , based in Cerritos , contacted Morningside and asked if it would participate in the weekend sessions with five other urban schools : Inglewood , Manual Arts , Jefferson , Locke and Lynwood high_schools . Within weeks of developing the six-school project , Cathers had contacted dozens of sources for private money and received a grant from Motorola Corp . and support from the Los Angeles Philharmonic , Carl ' s Jr. , Trader Joe ' s , Little Caesar ' s and Mrs . Gooch ' s , all_of which added_up to about $ 11 # 000 , he said . Cathers arranged to take the students to the Los Angeles Philharmonic so they could hear the piece the decathlon required them to know , the suite from Igor Stravinsky ' s ballet &quot; The Firebird. &quot; &quot; See , our kids don ' t have the chance to go and hear this music the way kids in wealthy school districts do , &quot; Daniels said . Daniels does not have the staff to write grants , but through contacts she has gotten more_than $ 200 # 000 for her school in the last three years in gifts and grants . A Century City law_firm donated furniture . A golf_club provided equipment for the high_school team . A Hollywood screenwriter with several hit movies donated $ 10 # 000 last year , and because he was impressed with the school and with Daniels , sent another $ 10 # 000 last week . He also offered to purchase desperately needed computers for the school . &quot; My wife and I wanted to do something and we called RLA ( formerly Rebuild L.A. ) after the riots , which put us in touch with Morningside &quot; said the writer , who asked not to be identified . Such referrals are not generally made to the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District . Located in a community that is wealthy in comparison to most others , the district is last on the list when it comes time to hand-out grants . But although the district ' s grant applications are routinely ignored , the Peninsula Education Foundation ' s requests are not given such short_shrift . The foundation was formed in 1980 to help fill the monetary gap created by Proposition 13 , declining enrollment and falling state aid . Since then , it has raised $ 4 million for the district ' s eight elementary_schools , two middle_schools and one high_school . &quot; In our district this kind of fund raising is absolutely necessary because the perception that we ' re in an affluent area means that all we get is the basic funding from the state , &quot; said Foundation Trustee Mary Jo Mock . &quot; We don ' t get all_the grants that other school districts can get. &quot; The peninsula foundation makes_up for it , however , by getting_about five times the amount it spends to raise money . In 1994 , the foundation spent $ 134 # 448 to raise $ 678 # 939 . With the money , the foundation has paid_for classroom aides in every elementary_school , aides for each school library , computer education specialists , writing advisers and other benefits that keep the district one of the best in the state . Also , 15 % of every dollar is invested in an endowment_fund that now has more_than $ 658 # 000 . Education foundations make_sense for middle-income or affluent communities , many educators say , but some doubt that auctions and dinner dances would be as successful in poorer districts . In district ' s such_as Lennox , where 89 % of the students qualify for free- or reduced-priced breakfast and lunch , forming a foundation is not even a consideration , Moffett said . &quot; We just don ' t have the population that can support that , &quot; he said . &quot; Our parents are people who work very hard , but they ' re already on a starvation diet . They ' re trying to feed their families . In wealthier districts , parents can give $ 400 , for example . Well , my gosh , $ 400 would feed some of our families for a month. &quot; But that doesn ' t mean that the school district goes without . Through its corporate partnerships , Lennox also has computer laboratories , classroom and library aides , and many of the assets the foundation provides_for peninsula schools . &quot; We have to do things differently , but we can still do_it , &quot; Moffett said . &quot; For example , right now I need a four-day-a-week recreation program for our kids -- they have nothing here in this community and if the school doesn ' t provide it they won ' t have it . &quot; So it may take me a little while to find the exact way to get_it , but I will . It ' s out there somewhere. &quot;</TEXT>
