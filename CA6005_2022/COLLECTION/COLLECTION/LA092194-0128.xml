   <TEXT> While Ford and General Motors race to build prototypes for the earth-friendly automobile of tomorrow , a fledgling private company that is designing its own &quot; supercar &quot; with the help of NASA has gone a step further . The group of former aerospace_engineers at Beverly Hills-based XCorp has developed a manufacturing system that may itself become a prototype for future auto_makers . Based on a production process that defense_contractors use to build cruise missiles , XCorp ' s &quot; clean manufacturing &quot; system -- meaning it produces little or no byproducts that are hazardous to the environment -- relies largely on polymers , or complex plastic materials , Chief_Executive Chris Catlin said . In the auto industry ' s standard manufacturing process , various body_parts such_as doors and side panels are stamped_out of large sheets of reinforced steel . XCorp ' s process is simpler : The body is molded from heated polymers , and the chassis is a composite of the polymers and 100 % recyclable aluminum . Catlin said the molding process creates a single integrated unit that is literally glued together with a fully recyclable adhesive , rather than the typical assemblage of automobile components that are welded , bolted or screwed together . Because XCorp ' s system renders obsolete much of the heavy , energy-intensive equipment used in the auto industry , it consumes about half the energy . It also eliminates the messy byproducts that come from drilling , spot welding , metal finishing and painting . XCorp ' s production system evolved from a more ambitious goal : to create a cost-competitive car with a fuel efficiency of 90 miles per gallon and superior crashworthiness . The vehicle design had to be lightweight , with about a third fewer parts than the average car . To accomplish this , it was necessary to redesign the manufacturing process itself . XCorp engineers even found an unusual way to cut_down the emissions that usually occur when plastics are heated and molded . By working with lower pressures and maintaining strict control over the heating and cooling of the polymers , they were able to reduce the vapor emissions . Rather than escaping , the emissions are contained within the polymers . XCorp has formed a consortium of suppliers and defense labs to develop a prototype of the car , with the help of NASA ' s Far West Regional Technology Center . Harriette Reid , a spokeswoman for the space agency , said the center is seeking both private and public funding for the project . CATHERINE JORDAN</TEXT>
