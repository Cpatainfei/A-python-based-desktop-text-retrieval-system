   <HEADLINE> LOCAL AGENCIES COPE WITH FEAR OF TERRORISM ; ENCINO : JEWISH AND ABORTION-RIGHTS GROUPS INCREASE PRECAUTIONS AFTER BOMBINGS ABROAD AND SLAYING OF A PHYSICIAN IN FLORIDA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With recent attacks against Jews abroad and doctors in Florida clearly weighing_on their minds , Jewish leaders and abortion-rights activists said Thursday they are keeping their fears in check while taking precautions against acts of terrorism here . The Anti-Defamation League sponsored a security seminar Thursday in Encino , and abortion-rights groups said they are confident that their network of clinic protectors would fend_off trouble . Fear of terrorism has been heightened by anti-Jewish bombings that killed or wounded more_than 100 people in Buenos Aires , Panama_City and London last month and by the second fatal shooting of an abortion-clinic physician , which occurred in Florida last week . Although officials with both the FBI and the Los Angeles Police_Department said they know of no immediate danger to synagogues in Los Angeles , which has the nation ' s second-largest Jewish community , they advised Jewish groups to remain on alert and outlined several precautions , including watching for suspicious visitors and packages . &quot; The FBI has received no information regarding any imminent attack in Los Angeles , &quot; Special Agent David Staretz told representatives of Jewish groups gathered at Valley Beth Shalom Synagogue in Encino . &quot; that ' s not to say you shouldn ' t remain on alert. &quot; Representatives of Jewish and abortion-rights groups said Thursday that they are paying more attention to security measures , but also carrying_on with their daily affairs and refusing to cave_in to fear . * &quot; I ' ve had a number of questions about whether to remove Jewish signs &quot; from synagogues , schools and businesses , said Mary Krasn , director of the ADL ' s San Fernando Valley branch . &quot; And I ' ve given them an unequivocal no . At no time should we hide our identities or shrink_from the world . But we also need to review our security procedures , &quot; Krasn said . Abortion-rights activists take a similar stance . &quot; Right now , all seems to be_quiet , but we remain vigilant , &quot; said Katherine Spillar , national coordinator for the Feminist Majority Foundation , which runs clinic defense projects around the country . In Los Angeles , Spillar said in a telephone_interview from Washington , clinics have reported no death threats or other unusual activity . She attributed the calm to a history of abortion-rights activism in the Los Angeles area , crediting the deterrent effect of &quot; 10 # 000 people in that area , literally , that we ' ve trained in clinic defense and who ' ve come_out to clinics over the last five years whenever needed. &quot; Josie Corning , a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles , agreed , saying the nonprofit group ' s network of volunteer protectors is standing_by , although there have been no signs of violence so far . Corning added that Planned Parenthood began taking heavy security measures at its 11 Los Angeles clinics at least three years ago , when abortion foes such_as Operation Rescue started becoming more violent . Similarly , Jewish groups have long been sensitive to violent attacks and the need for vigilance . But last month ' s flurry of terrorism , including the July 18 bombing at a Buenos Aires Jewish center that left at least 96 people dead , renewed concern that Jews everywhere are targets . After that attack and the bombings that followed , some Jewish groups in Los Angeles received threats , Krasn said Thursday . She declined to provide details but added , &quot; As far as I know , none of the threats materialized. &quot; At least one bomb threat was directed at the Simon Wiesenthal Center ' s Museum of Tolerance on Pico Boulevard , an LAPD spokeswoman said Thursday . A police bomb squad was sent there on July 28 after a caller warned of explosives on the premises . Nothing was found and a man was later arrested and charged with two counts of making false bomb threats , said Officer Sandra Castello . Even though it has not been targeted by specific threats , at least one Jewish organization has changed its habits . * Intercoms with buzzer-activated locks to admit visitors have been in place at the United Jewish Appeal office in Sherman Oaks since the fund-raising group moved_in last November . But it was only after a July 26 car bombing outside the Israeli Embassy in London that the UJA began using the security_system , said administrative assistant Debby Bennett , who attended Thursday ' s meeting . Other Jewish groups represented included several synagogues , a cemetery , the Russian Community_Center in West Los Angeles and the Jewish Family Service ' s Family Friends Project in North Hollywood , whose director expressed concern about the difficulty of screening visitors in the storefront walk-in operation . &quot; What are things to look_for ? Like the woman in London with the Harrod ' s bag ? &quot; asked Susan Forer-Dehrey , referring to the well-dressed , middle-aged woman seen leaving a car in London shortly before it exploded . &quot; There ' s no stereotype , &quot; replied Sean Ben-Menahem , a security_consultant for the Jewish Federation Council . &quot; For the next two weeks , &quot; he advised , &quot; receive no off-the-street clients . Establish a system of appointments only. &quot; &quot; What about the Jewish High_Holidays , which are a month away ? &quot; another guest wanted to know . &quot; Could the police increase their patrols during that time ? Should we increase security ? &quot; LAPD Capt . James McMurray of the Van Nuys Division suggested that congregations weigh what they can afford against how much of a threat they perceive . He added that police patrols are alerted to Jewish holiday dates and keep lists of potential hate-crime targets . Finally , Betty Levy , director of B ' nai B ' rith Women ' s Pacific Southwest Region , wanted to know if her group should continue to publicize events . Ben-Menahem suggested hiring guards for those events or using hand-held radios to keep tabs on guests , but otherwise carrying_on as usual . &quot; You can ' t stop life , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
