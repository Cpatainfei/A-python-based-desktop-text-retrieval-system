   <HEADLINE> VALLEY CHAMBERS VOTE TO SUPPORT PROP . 187</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Following an emotionally charged debate that continued for months , representatives of the San Fernando Valley ' s 21 chambers_of_commerce this week voted to support Proposition 187 -- the controversial state initiative seeking to restrict health and education benefits for illegal immigrants . The chamber members , representing more_than 8 # 500 mostly small and medium-sized Valley businesses , had been split over support of the measure because they disagreed on whether Proposition 187 would do what proponents say it will . Chamber representatives said they agreed that illegal immigration has become a costly local problem that is being ignored by government decision-makers . But they differed on how to approach the problem . &quot; People are saying , ' I don ' t like this Third_World takeover , ' &quot; said Guy Weddington McCreary , a North Hollywood Chamber_of_Commerce member favoring the initiative . &quot; It is literally an invasion and very upsetting. &quot; But others countered that the Valley ' s lingering economic troubles , as well as demographic and other social changes , are not likely to be reversed with passage of the proposition . They point to additional costs and responsibilities the measure would create . Besides restricting government services , it would require local authorities to report suspected illegal immigrants . &quot; We didn ' t feel that requiring medical and educational personnel to be INS cops was appropriate , &quot; said James Stewart , member of the Mid-San Fernando Valley Chamber_of_Commerce , which voted against support of Proposition 187 . &quot; We know we have an illegal immigration problem . But the solution is to do a better job at the border . This doesn ' t do anything besides create more bureaucracy. &quot; The 15-10 vote on Wednesday supporting the initiative by the San Fernando Valley ' s United Chambers_of_Commerce is largely symbolic . Even so , chamber members say the debate has been one of the most emotional in recent memory . &quot; A couple of people got really hot about it and that ' s not real common , &quot; Stewart said . Chamber members said they did not believe support of the measure would cost them customers because of its broad support . In fact , Valley business owners supporting the measure say it has caught_fire among longtime residents unhappy with growing numbers of low-income families , many of them Latino , now living_in the sprawling Los Angeles suburb that was once nearly all white and predominantly middle-class . McCreary -- who says his family moved to North Hollywood 107 years ago and was instrumental in its development -- said support for the measure is largely economic . He said many taxpayers fear paying increasingly larger shares of their income to support the families of illegal immigrants . He cited a report commissioned by the Clinton_Administration and released this week estimating that California taxpayers pay $ 1.6 billion a year to educate and incarcerate illegal immigrants . The report -- written and researched by the Urban Institute , a Washington think_tank -- estimates that the costs of serving illegal immigrants exceed what they pay in taxes and other revenues . But the measure is about more_than money , McCreary said . &quot; These people move_in here , they aren ' t being assimilated , &quot; said McCreary , who is a property manager . &quot; We ' ve got_to get a handle on it or else. &quot; That kind of talk is fueling a lot of support for the measure , said Scott Macdonald , spokesman for Taxpayers Against 187 . &quot; But 187 doesn ' t solve the problem . It does nothing at the border , &quot; he said . The Woodland Hills Chamber_of_Commerce -- the Valley ' s largest with 1 # 000 members -- agrees . They voted to oppose the measure , saying it would do little to reduce illegal immigration and , with restrictions on medical_care , could make matter worse . Debate over support of the measure was also split , but both sides agreed it is a problem that government has been unable to fix . For that reason , Woodland Hills attorney Gary Barr said he sees history repeating itself . &quot; Proposition 13 wasn ' t the greatest of measures , but it tapped into feelings that government wasn ' t willing to do anything about the property_tax problem , &quot; Barr said . &quot; The reason there is such broad support is because people know there is a problem and they don ' t believe government has done anything to solve it. &quot; Results of a statewide Times poll released earlier this week show that Proposition 187 is supported by virtually all groups , including Latino voters . Among all registered voters , the measure is favored 62 % to 28 % , an overwhelming margin . Lois Klein , a member of the United Chambers_of_Commerce , said no one is even sure whether Proposition 187 is constitutional . A portion seeks to keep children who are in the country illegally from attending California schools . That would contradict a 1982 Supreme Court ruling that undocumented children are entitled to a public education . Even so , said Klein , &quot; It is something to shake the state up and , hopefully , force legislators to do something. &quot; The Los Angeles Area Chamber_of_Commerce is scheduled to discuss support of the initiative next week . * A GRIM PROSPECT : Students in state illegally react to Prop . 187 .
