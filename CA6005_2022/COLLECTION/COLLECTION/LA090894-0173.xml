   <HEADLINE> ABORTION ACCORD UNRAVELS AT TALKS ; POPULATION : THERE ARE CHARGES THAT THE VATICAN HAS ' HIJACKED ' CAIRO CONFERENCE . A NEW COMPROMISE IS SOUGHT AS SOME LATIN NATIONS OPPOSE CONSENSUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Amid accusations that the Vatican has &quot; hijacked &quot; the conference on global population , U.N. delegations returned in frustration to the drawing board Wednesday after a parade of Latin_American nations joined the Pope in opposing a compromise on abortion . Several African and East European states also abandoned the teetering consensus reached Tuesday night , under which abortion would not be promoted in family_planning programs and individual nations would decide whether or not to legalize the procedure . More_than a dozen nations met in closed-door sessions with the Vatican representative to try to work_out a new compromise , focusing primarily on objections to characterizing abortions as &quot; safe &quot; or &quot; unsafe &quot; and describing them as &quot; legal &quot; in some countries -- terms that the Vatican says could pave the way toward creating a new international right to abortion . &quot; The concept of a ' right to abortion ' would be entirely innovative in the international community and would be contrary to the constitutional and legislative positions of many states , as well as being alien to the sensitivities of vast numbers of persons , believers and unbelievers alike , &quot; the Vatican ' s chief delegate , Archbishop Renato R . Martino , told the conference Wednesday . The abortion issue , to the frustration and occasional fury of both sides , has dominated the agenda of this huge international gathering , aimed at adopting a global population strategy for the next 20 years that will hold the world ' s population to 7.2 billion . Despite confident assertions that 92 % of the program ' s wide-ranging and often groundbreaking new policies had been agreed upon in_advance , discussion of critical issues such_as expanded reproductive health_care , empowerment of women , refugees and migration has been held_up for days as delegates have attempted to resolve the abortion controversy . In the conference hallways , a new lapel button has appeared with increasing frequency : &quot; I Am Poped Out. &quot; Delegations from Scandinavia , Europe and the United States -- left impatiently on the sidelines as the optimism of Tuesday night disappeared -- said there will be a final attempt to try to win_over the Vatican and its allies and then the conference document will be adopted with or without them . By the end of the day , only five nations -- Honduras , El_Salvador , Guatemala , Ecuador and Malta -- looked_to be firm holdouts on the abortion issue . &quot; We will exercise a lot of patience and try to bury our frustrations , &quot; said Timothy E . Wirth , U.S. undersecretary of state for global affairs and head of the U.S. delegation . In the end , he said , &quot; there will be dissenters from the document . There is no other way , when some of the delegations have such strong feelings . . . . The U.N. system works_on consensus . Consensus doesn ' t mean unanimity . It means consensus. &quot; An informal working group of 13 nations was given until Friday morning to try to work_through the conflict . Conference organizers also delayed until Friday discussion of the controversial issues of the right of access to birth_control services , sexual and reproductive rights and reproductive health . A variety of delegations and organizations supporting more liberal abortion policies angrily accused the Vatican of holding the entire discussion of global population policy hostage to the abortion issue . The National Audubon Society asserted that the conference had been &quot; hijacked by . . . the Vatican , which seeks to impose its own view on others. &quot; Frances Kissling , president of Catholics for a Free Choice , was even more vehement . &quot; How come a country ( Vatican_City ) , a so-called country , that is in_essence 800 square acres of office space in the middle of Rome , that has a citizenry that excludes women and children , seems to attract the most attention in talking_about public policy that deals with women and children ? &quot; she demanded . But several delegations allied_with the Vatican on the abortion issue predicted that no global population strategy can be strong and effective if it fails to take_into_account the concerns of many of the world ' s nations about abortion . &quot; You have to give humane solutions to human problems . . . . I think the United Nations should give options that are within the principles of the United Nations , and poor countries should not be obliged to accept things that are against their principles , &quot; said Marta Casco , a member of the Honduras delegation . Honduras was one country that objected to characterizing abortion as safe or unsafe , emphasizing the belief that all abortions are unsafe for the fetus . But Casco predicted it will be impossible to reach a compromise . &quot; There will be differences that will never be solved in that room , &quot; she said . &quot; And if it ( the document ) comes without consensus , it will be a very weak document. &quot; Yet the new objections raised Wednesday morning were a source of bitter irritation for countries that had sought a more liberal abortion policy but had , in the interest of compromise , settled for relatively limited language emphasizing national sovereignty and restricting abortion as a family_planning tool . &quot; The European Union is not going_to accept deleting any reference_to safety , any reference_to the legal situation , &quot; said Wouter Meijer , a member of the Dutch delegation . &quot; These countries ( refuse ) to accept that in some countries , ( abortion ) is legal , because for them it is the ultimate crime . The fact is that in many countries , abortion under certain conditions is acceptable. &quot; Actress Jane Fonda , designated a &quot; goodwill ambassador &quot; to the conference , appeared in a flurry of camera flashes and television lights to lend her voice to the push to improve health_care services and political rights for women . She urged delegates to &quot; keep debate focused_on the broad agenda , in spite of efforts to do the contrary. &quot; Fonda ' s speech was only one of hundreds of sidelights at the huge conference , where more_than 15 # 000 delegates and non-governmental organization representatives are focusing_on every imaginable aspect of population , from migration patterns from farms to cities to sex education and the effects of domestic violence on women . Booths at the forum of non-governmental organizations , which adjoined the conference , feature everything from the International Planned Parenthood Federation ' s materials to the Right To Life Assn. ' s model embryos . An Indian faith-healing group and a Cairo garbage_collectors association ( developers of an innovative recycling program ) have also set_up shop . But even in discussion groups on widely divergent topics , talk inevitably touches_on the abortion issue , which has consumed the attention of almost everyone . Thus , it was with no small degree of exhilaration Tuesday night that many delegations believed a compromise had been cinched , only to see the Vatican stand_up at the last minute and oppose it , eliciting a chorus of boos . The amended version under discussion at the time , which also included U.S. calls_for post-abortion counseling , education and family_planning services , had won support from at least 39 widely divergent nations , including many Islamic countries and the European Union . By Wednesday morning , a line of Latin_American , African and East European_countries began proposing amendments , and the drafting committee in frustration tabled the_matter and referred it to an informal working_group . Egypt , as host country , twice pleaded with the committee to speed_up its deliberations and move_on to other issues . &quot; If they are asking us to be flexible on an issue such_as abortion , we have to explain our reasons for not accepting it , &quot; said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . &quot; ( But ) if no consensus is reached on this particular issue , we can simply voice our reservations. &quot;</TEXT>
