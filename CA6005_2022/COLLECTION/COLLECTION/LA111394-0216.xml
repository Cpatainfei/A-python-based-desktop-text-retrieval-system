   <HEADLINE> NEW TURF TO GUARD ; SAN CLEMENTE OFFICERS ADJUST TO BORDER REDEPLOYMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. Border_Patrol Agent Elizabeth Briones likes excitement , and she ' s gotten plenty since being reassigned from the San Clemente checkpoint down to the busy and dangerous international border with Mexico . Here , Briones is helping catch thousands of illegal immigrants , an effort that went_into high_gear on Oct . 1 when the federal_government beefed_up its border enforcement as part of Operation Gatekeeper . But like other agents redeployed to the border , Briones , 28 , of Temecula gives the clear impression she ' d rather be back at the San Clemente checkpoint , where it may have been less intense but there were more different kinds of action -- and fewer personal sacrifices . &quot; Down here , I ' m just assigned to run and chase illegal aliens and catch them , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s like a game here. &quot; &quot; We do need agents down here at the border , &quot; Briones conceded . &quot; But I feel they need us at the checkpoint too . Up there , it ' s not just illegal aliens . We ' re capturing car thieves and recovering stolen cars . We ' re stopping drugs going_through and helping to keep them off the street. &quot; For many of the more_than 90 border agents who were stationed at the now-closed checkpoint , the redeployment has also meant longer hours , more stress , unfamiliar terrain and new co-workers . Richard Gordon , 28 , who also lives_in Riverside County , has traded_in his 40-minute commute to the checkpoint for a 90-minute trip to the border . Now , he meets half_a_dozen other agents at the checkpoint and they car-pool for the trek south . &quot; It ' s sort of like being a trainee again , &quot; Gordon said . &quot; But we have all this experience behind us and it ' s just learning the area , the tactics of the aliens and the smugglers out here. &quot; The reassignment has also changed the domestic situation for some agents . Briones ' husband , Carlos , had worked for the Border_Patrol at the checkpoint , but since Operation Gatekeeper began , she works swing_shift and he works night_shift . &quot; At home , usually he ' s going_to work and I ' m coming_home . We hardly see each other any more , &quot; she said . And the agents don ' t know whether things will ever go_back to the way they were . The checkpoint is being evaluated to determine whether it should reopen or be closed permanently , according to Border_Patrol officials . It is expected to reopen temporarily , and agents are eagerly waiting to go_back -- and hoping it ' ll be for good . &quot; At first they told us 10 days , then 15 days . Now it ' s been 30 days . We just stopped asking , &quot; said agent Roy D . Villareal , 24 , of San Marcos . The government ' s emphasis in having more uniforms at the border rather than at distant checkpoints is forcing agents to adapt . When Operation Gatekeeper started , Ted Swofford , 44 , the assistant Border_Patrol agent in_charge of the checkpoint , said San Clemente agents had to familiarize themselves with their new border post and get used to the large contingent of agents deployed there . &quot; If we have 12 people on_duty at the checkpoint , we think we got_it made because that ' s what it takes_to operate it at any one time , &quot; Swofford said . &quot; And , down here at Imperial Beach station , they have close to 80 people working_at one time . At the checkpoint , the agents know each ( other ) and each knows what to expect of each other in different jobs. &quot; In contrast to the checkpoint , which operated day and night , border surveillance is primarily night work . At the border , agents are routinely briefed about 3 p.m. and then assigned patrol areas . They spend nights scouting darkened canyons , hoping to intercept and apprehend immigrants in the rugged terrain . Agents on horseback , bicycles , sedans , all-terrain vehicles and small , high-speed boats are spread_out in a three-tiered formation along the busiest 14 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border . &quot; Down here , &quot; Swofford said , &quot; we got people from several different stations , and although the uniform ' s the same color , they don ' t know much about the other agents . We ' re also trying to give them the benefit of the local agents ' knowledge so they can teach the San Clemente agents their way around , rather than just throwing them out there. &quot; &quot; Out there &quot; is often dangerous , and the victims are typically migrants preyed upon by robbers . Heightening the peril , there are signs of mounting tension between agents and smugglers of illegal immigrants since the increased effort to seal_off the border . On Oct . 29 , a speeding pickup_truck crashed through a closed gate at San Ysidro ' s port_of_entry , and later that day , two cars did the same . The suspected smugglers eluded pursuing agents each time , and officials cited the incidents as evidence of growing frustration among smugglers with the border crackdown . Operation Gatekeeper also put a brighter political spotlight on the border . Last month , U.S. Atty . Gen . Janet Reno paid another visit to the Imperial Beach station , followed by Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner a week later . And Mexicans protested in Tijuana at the border over Proposition 187 , and its perceived link to the border crackdown . Swofford , who worked_at the border three years ago , recalled changes in that time on such improvements as fencing and lighting . &quot; When I left here , &quot; Swofford said , &quot; basically the fence was a dilapidated chain link fence with more holes than you could count . Now there ' s a solid-steel fence 10 feet tall. &quot; The improvements were part of a $ 45-million congressional allocation last February that also enabled the Border_Patrol to buy 220 new all-terrain vehicles , Swofford said . &quot; When I left , we didn ' t have enough vehicles to supply two shifts of agents , &quot; Swofford said . &quot; One shift would be out there , and in_order to transition we had to bring the vehicles in during a shift change , leaving no one out there . Now we got two lines of agents out there. &quot; The reassignment of checkpoint agents to the border has had its advantages . Villareal said he gets_to see illegal immigration from its beginning and &quot; probably the most interesting aspect of being down here is watching the network of the smugglers . The way they allocate their people , it ' s just like transporting cargo . You see a group of 100 aliens sitting somewhere and somebody will say , ' OK , we ' re going to move. ' It ' s so intriguing that a_couple_of whistles or hand signals is all they need and the next thing you know , all 100 will just shift and move_out , now ! &quot; It has been on-the-job training , the agents acknowledged , but checkpoint work has prepared them for their new assignment . In fact , the checkpoint was the nation ' s busiest with 122 # 000 motorists passing_through daily . More_than 46 # 000 illegal immigrants were apprehended at the checkpoint in the 1993 fiscal_year , Border_Patrol officials said . During the same period , agents seized 7 # 552 pounds of marijuana , 63 1 / 2 pounds of cocaine and 9 1 / 2 pounds of heroin . In addition , the agents said , they seize items that usually are not mentioned in news accounts , such_as untaxed cigarettes from Mexico , and sometimes , weird , illegally imported wildlife such_as black clams . &quot; The misconception in the general public is that we only stop smuggling of aliens , &quot; Gordon said , referring to the checkpoint . &quot; But that ' s like only half of what we do . The San Diego Freeway is the major south-to-north corridor that we have in the state . You ' re bound to come_across a whole_lot of other crimes. &quot; &quot; I remember we got a description of two carjackers who hijacked a taxi in San Diego , &quot; Gordon said . &quot; They had beaten_up a man pretty bad . Police put_out a bulletin and it said that we might expect them to be headed our way . Sure enough , they blew through our checkpoint and we got them near the ( San Onofre ) power plant. &quot; Still , it was the human cargo smuggled north that made_up half of their job at the checkpoint , agents said . Briones recalled stopping a small sports_car and making a surprise discovery in the engine compartment . &quot; We lifted the hood to the engine and there was a carpet over the engine which caught our attention , &quot; Briones said . &quot; We pulled it back and there was a person there ! &quot; And , Gordon said he has uncovered illegal drugs in secret , electrically operated compartments . &quot; You name it , we ' ve seen it , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' ve had people trying to pass the inspection point sitting on top of each other , thinking we won ' t notice , &quot; Gordon said . &quot; I stopped a motor_home once that had a ceiling raised 12 inches . We got 19 aliens out of that RV. &quot; Gordon said one characteristic applies to both the checkpoint and the border : It ' s nearly impossible to predict the behavior of illegal immigrants . &quot; You can have 10 agents down here at the border and they ' ll still jump over the fence right in front of you , &quot; Gordon said . &quot; Or , you can be standing on the freeway at the checkpoint and they ' ll jump_out of their vehicles right in front of you and start running . It ' s amazing. &quot;</TEXT>
