   <HEADLINE> JIM MURRAY : COLT IS GIVING SONG TO HOPE FOR THE DERBY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I have to say I was proud_of the horseplayers Sunday at Santa Anita . Proud , but not surprised . An earthquake ripped through the establishment some time between the second and third race . Now , anywhere else on Earth , when a 5.3 shock ripples through the premises , people flee , sirens wail and business_activity comes_to a standstill and shuts down for the day . But horseplayers do not deal with earthquakes . After all , they are not part of their figures . Horses get mud marks for ability to stand_up and run straight in the rain . Horses get speed ratings . They are marked for their ability to go a route . But who can handicap an earthquake ? Not even Caltech , it would appear . So what chance does a guy who answers to the name Hot Horse Harry or Big Julie or Longshot Louie have ? So , the meet never missed a beat . The bugler was sounding the call_for the third race as the temblor hit , but the horseplayers never even broke stride as they headed for the windows . They probably wanted to die even . Or ahead . They could go_to St . Peter and say , &quot; What ' d you do that for ? I was ahead in the meeting ! &quot; If someone asked a player , &quot; What did you think_of the earthquake ? &quot; the response would probably be , &quot; What race was he in ? &quot; Or maybe even , &quot; I thought the boy rode him like an ostrich. &quot; It takes more_than an earthquake to distract the horseplayer from the swift completion of his appointed rounds . The end of the world would be hard_put to get his attention . Particularly if he was trying to make a case for some 20-1 shot . Actually , if the horseplayers had let it , the earthquake would have upstaged one of the important races of the year . The San Felipe is a $ 200 # 000 1 1 / 16-mile stake , and you know all you need to know about it when I tell you that three horses who won it went_on to win the Kentucky_Derby . But that ' s nothing . Four horses who finished second went_on to win the Derby . That gives you seven horses that finished first or second in the San Felipe going_on to win in Kentucky . But that ' s nothing , either . One horse who won this race , Affirmed , went_on to win the Triple_Crown and four who finished first or second went_on to win the Preakness . Seven San Felipe winners went_on to win the Santa Anita Derby and of the horses who finished first , second or third , 21 went_on to win the Santa Anita Derby . If form prevails , then , either Soul Of The Matter or Brocco will win the Santa Anita Derby next month and maybe the Kentucky_Derby in May . Either way , &quot; Hooray for Hollywood &quot; should supplant &quot; My Old Kentucky Home &quot; the first Saturday in May . Brocco , who finished second in the San Felipe , is the colt owned by Cubby Broccoli , the originator and producer of the James Bond movies . Soul Of The Matter , who won the San Felipe , is owned by composer Burt Bacharach , and if the horse follows the well-worn path from winner of the San Felipe to winner of the Santa Anita to winner of the Kentucky_Derby , Tinseltown will still get top_billing . Every Hollywood filmmaker knows that the only thing as important to a movie as the script is the score . From Irving Berlin to Henry Mancini to Dmitri Tiomkin , the soundtracks have been as critical to the success of big-budget films as the stars or the horses . Bacharach is one of the greats of the film music makers , the troubadours who set the scene for a blockbuster movie as surely as the dialogue . Who could come_away from &quot; Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid &quot; not singing &quot; Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head &quot; or from &quot; Alfie &quot; not humming &quot; What ' s it All About , Alfie ? &quot; When Bacharach is not at a keyboard or on a stage , he ' s in a paddock . Or a stable . Horse_racing , like music making , is an addiction , and Burt , whose father was a longtime syndicated newspaper_columnist , got hooked early . Bacharach ' s music has earned him three Oscars and so many Grammy Awards , he couldn ' t tote them up immediately . But he has never had a horse as close to a gold record as Soul Of The Matter . He did have the filly Heartlight No . 1 -- named for a song he collaborated on -- in 1983 , and she became filly of the year . But Burt had some horses that were losers of the week . In fact , his horses once lost 43 races in a row , he acknowledges . But he recently did a concert in Louisville , and he hopes Soul Of The Matter can play one there in May . The San Felipe was not supposed to be a recital for the music man ' s horse . It was supposed to be a match race between Brocco and Valiant Nature , a rematch of their hookup in the Hollywood Futurity won by Valiant Nature . The other horses in the San Felipe were supposed to be the chorus . The posse . On a sound stage , they would have handed them spears . Brocco , after all , had won the Breeders ' Cup , emblematic of the 2-year-old championship . The track was listed as &quot; good , &quot; which , in racetrack parlance , means anything but . A track gets_to be &quot; good &quot; right after it ' s terrible and it means the traction will be barely this side of a banana peel ' s . Soul Of The Matter hit this surface like Nancy Kerrigan and , when Brocco and Valiant Nature had run themselves into a clothesline , Bacharach ' s horse went_by them in the stretch as if they were waiting for a bus . If history tells us anything , Brocco or Soul Of The Matter will win the Santa Anita Derby on April 9 and maybe go_on to win the Kentucky_Derby the first Saturday in May . Racetrack wisdom says that Brocco and Valiant Nature were &quot; short horses &quot; Sunday , lacking sufficient prep races . Neither had run this year , whereas Soul Of The Matter had raced twice , finishing third once . But Murray ' s Law -- which is rooted in an unassailable position , ignorance -- says , &quot; Good horses win , bad horses excuse. &quot; You can get used to losing . Hollywood has had a spotty record at Kentucky anyway , where the hardboots used to rejoice whenever they could send a &quot; Hollywood horse &quot; home tourist . It is not likely Bacharach ' s horse will show_up in dark glasses , gold chains and an earring . He is not a &quot; Let ' s do lunch &quot; type , he ' s a hard-knocking sort who runs_on grass , glass -- a &quot; good &quot; track -- in front or behind . As a matter_of_fact , not even an earthquake bothers him . If a 5.3 hits Louisville on May 7 , he should be an &quot; out &quot; price .</TEXT>
