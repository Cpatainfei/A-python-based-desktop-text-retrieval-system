   <TEXT> The United States and its European allies moved Thursday toward declaring the strategically important Bosnian town of Bihac a demilitarized zone in a last-ditch effort to prevent it from falling to rebel Serb troops . The action came at a high-level meeting of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization in Brussels as Serbian forces began moving_into outlying areas of the largely Muslim town , climaxing a two-week siege . At the same time , in a further defiance of the West , Bosnian Serb troops surrounded and effectively took hostage about 250 French and Canadian U.N. peacekeeping troops at six locations around Bosnia-Herzegovina . Serbian nationalist leaders have warned they will stage an &quot; all-out war &quot; if the Western allies continue to try to impede their advance on Bihac . U.N. and Serbian envoys negotiated Thursday in a thus-far unsuccessful effort to work_out a truce . The NATO action took the form of an agreement to use air_power to enforce a demilitarized zone if the United Nations uses its authority to declare one . Western sources said they expect U.N. officials in New York and Croatia to announce such a step today . The decision by NATO essentially embraced a proposal that the Clinton_Administration has been pressing for days . Until Thursday , however , the allies had resisted , fearing Serbian reprisals against European U.N. troops . Bihac is regarded_as crucial because a takeover of the town by Serbian nationalists is considered likely to prompt the Bosnian government to pull_out of negotiations for a permanent peace accord and could widen the war . Croatia , which borders the Bihac area and has a large ethnic Serb minority of its own , has hinted that fighting might well break_out in its own territory if Bihac is lost to the Bosnian Serb troops . The vote_in NATO on Thursday , which followed a nine-hour meeting that was interrupted by telephone conferences with U.N. officials , was essentially an agreement in principle to use NATO air_power to help enforce a demilitarized zone . Thus far in the 2 1 / 2-year-old Bosnian civil_war , however , U.N. leaders have hesitated to approve NATO air strikes , for fear of Serbian reprisals against the U.N. peacekeeping troops -- most from Europe and none from the United States -- on the ground in the war-ravaged country . Besides paving the way for establishment of the demilitarized area , NATO ' s policy-setting North Atlantic Council also voted to extend the &quot; no-fly zone &quot; over Bosnia about four miles north into neighboring Croatia . The move was designed to enable NATO warplanes to prevent the Serbs from using airfields in Croatia as staging_areas for bombing raids against Bihac , as they had until Monday , when NATO jets bombed Serbian runways there . Details of the so-called &quot; weapons-exclusion zone , &quot; as such arrangements are called_in Bosnia , were left to be hammered_out by officials of the U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia , which controls U.N. peacekeeping troops . However , Western officials said the zone includes an area within a two-mile radius of Bihac ' s center , with the addition of a section to the north that contains a large Muslim population . Under the terms of the allied dictum , both sides -- the Bosnian Serbs and the largely Muslim Bosnian government -- would have to keep their troops , tanks and artillery out of the weapons-exclusion zone or risk attack by NATO warplanes . The United Nations and NATO have already set_up similar zones around Sarajevo , Bosnia ' s capital , and Gorazde , a major city . The restrictions in Sarajevo , however , apply only to heavy_weapons and not to ground troops . Thursday ' s action by NATO marks the most sweeping warning that the allies have given the Serbs in connection with the siege against Bihac , which has been intensifying since early November , when Muslim forces began recapturing some Serb-held territory in the area . On Monday and Wednesday , squadrons of NATO warplanes launched air strikes against Serbian targets -- including an airfield in Croatia from which Serbian aircraft had been bombing Bihac -- but the attacks were largely symbolic . European governments have been reluctant to take more aggressive action for fear that rebel Serb leaders would retaliate and attack French , British , Dutch and Canadian peacekeeping troops , who are only lightly armed . The Europeans have warned that if their own ground troops are attacked , they will expect the United States to send U.S. forces in to help rescue them , as President Clinton has promised . The United States had initially proposed an exclusion zone with a six-mile radius , but the allies rejected that as too provocative . Two miles , they said , would more_than cover the town . However , the Europeans began to have second_thoughts after Serbian nationalists troops finally started closing_in on Bihac . They now are reported likely to back the U.S. plan , albeit reluctantly . Along with the promise to enforce a demilitarized zone , NATO officials also condemned the recent Serbian attacks on Bihac and urged all sides to continue their diplomatic efforts to work_out a truce . Yasushi Akashi , the chief U.N. envoy in the former Yugoslav federation , said Thursday that he had worked_out a possible cease-fire in talks with Serbian leaders in Belgrade , but local Serbian nationalists had not yet accepted the deal . Despite the cumbersome procedure involved in Thursday ' s NATO action , spokesmen for the organization left no doubt that the allies were alarmed by the continuing rebel Serb threat to Bihac . Jamie Shea , NATO ' s chief spokesman , told reporters at a briefing that the alliance had been &quot; extremely preoccupied &quot; by the deterioration of the situation there and stood ready &quot; to use its air_power &quot; to protect the city . Allied officials said creation of a demilitarized zone around Bihac would be done under existing U.N. authority and would not require approval of another resolution by the U.N. Security_Council . However , they said Security_Council approval would be required to extend the &quot; no-fly zone &quot; into Croatia -- a move that could run_into opposition from Russia , which is one of the five permanent members of the council and has veto power . Moscow has already raised objections to Wednesday ' s NATO air_attack on Serb-controlled missile sites , contending that military_action by the West could only lead to &quot; prolonged bloodshed &quot; in the region . Willy Claes , NATO ' s secretary_general , said Thursday that the West had no desire to get_into a war , but he said Wednesday ' s action had come under authority of a previous U.N. resolution , which Russia had backed . Thursday ' s push by Serbian nationalist forces surrounding Bihac effectively trapped thousands of civilians in the town . Fighting also flared in Sarajevo as Bosnian Serb forces shelled the capital . There was no immediate indication when the Serbs might free the 250 French and Canadian peacekeeping troops whom they had detained . U.N. officials said the peacekeepers had not been harmed . Times staff writer Pine reported from Washington and staff researcher Maelcamp from Brussels .</TEXT>
