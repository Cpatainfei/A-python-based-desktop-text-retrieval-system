   <HEADLINE> THE BIG TRADE-OFF : CLINTON ' S ASIA POLICY STRESSES HUMAN_RIGHTS AND ECONOMICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From human_rights in China to trade issues with Japan , the controversy stirred during Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher ' s current Asia trip reflects the persistent tensions between U.S. interests and values -- something that plagues Bill_Clinton ' s entire foreign_policy . The Administration rightly seeks to balance these concerns . But this means making difficult choices and trade-offs . To its credit , the Clinton_Administration has recognized the importance of the dynamic economies of the Asia-Pacific to Clinton ' s top domestic priority -- economic_growth and jobs . Yet , Clinton also wants to promote human_rights and democracy . Ironically , while appreciating Asia ' s importance , the Administration ' s in-your-face tactics display little grasp of regional dynamics -- a defect that may prove harmful to U.S. interests . While the goals of expanding free markets and democracy are related , the former tends to produce the latter , particularly in East Asia . But with Clinton ' s policy , there appears no sense of cause and effect : He wants it all -- now . In regard_to China , Clinton has found the prose of governing far more troublesome than the poetry ( &quot; coddling the butchers of Beijing &quot; ) of campaigning . While the Administration has , in recent months , wisely sought to redefine its China policy , its rhetoric has painted Clinton into a corner . A growing number in Congress realize that most-favored-nation trading status is , as the Australian foreign_minister said to Christopher last week , &quot; not a privilege , but a normal basis for trade. &quot; Yet , Clinton ' s campaign rhetoric is enshrined in the executive order issued last May , during the annual MFN drama that requires China to meet absolute conditions on immigration and prison-labor exports and achieve &quot; overall significant progress &quot; in five other categories of human-rights issues . Until the recent crackdown on pro-democracy dissidents -- related , in part , to the coincidence of Christopher ' s arrival and the convening of China ' s Parliament -- Beijing had begun to take a number of steps that , if continued , would have met minimum U.S. demands . But no Chinese leader will make concessions amid the loud warnings Christopher issued en route to Beijing . If human_rights were the only interest Washington had in China , then putting the entire relationship on the line to express our outrage might be arguable . But beyond our $ 40-billion trade relationship with one of the world ' s most important emerging markets , there is far more at stake than human_rights . The goal of U.S. policy toward China is to see Beijing integrated into the world system as a responsible global power . To put it bluntly , with 22 % of the world ' s population , a seat on the U.N. Security_Council , a nuclear arsenal and perhaps the third-largest economy , if China is not integrated into a post-Cold War system , there will not be a viable international_system . From non-proliferation and North_Korea to global environmental issues , the United States has a rich agenda to pursue with China -- and human_rights is one of several important elements . The Administration recognizes this , and has hoped China would meet its conditions for renewing MFN and then , in_essence , Washington would declare victory and delink the issue from human_rights . But that strategy is in jeopardy . Similarly , Christopher ' s stop in Japan was also in the &quot; we want it all now &quot; category . Even as a deal was being brokered to give Motorola fair access to Tokyo ' s cellular-phone market , Christopher was chiding Japan for failing to meet its commitments . There is no question that Japan ' s global surpluses and low proportions of foreign investment and import of manufactured goods are indefensible signs of an economy that must become more open . But as with human_rights in China , the question is less about the objective than finding the best way to achieve it . With Japan , it ' s not clear what the United States wants . Clinton ' s own Council of Economic Advisers issued a recent report saying that if Japan did everything Washington wanted , the trade_deficit might be reduced by only $ 9 billion -- to $ 50 billion . But the Administration ' s &quot; results-oriented &quot; approach has defined the bilateral trade_deficit as the issue . As long as the United States is running large deficits and has relatively low savings and investment rates , we will have trade_deficits -- particularly with a U.S. consumer-led recovery while Japan is in recession . The problem is long term and structural : Japan needs deregulation , tax cuts , more open markets and political reform to empower consumers . This is precisely the agenda of Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa . But Clinton ' s approach only increases Hosokawa ' s difficulties . Clinton ' s team appears to be in an intellectual time warp , circa 1989 . U.S.-Japan policy is marked by a deep distrust -- not entirely unearned -- of Japan , reflecting the revisionist view of Japan . The revisionists argued that &quot; Japan Inc. &quot; was an unstoppable , impervious economic juggernaut bent_on dominating the world economy . But reality discredited this . Japan is in its third year of recession , its stock_market has shrunk in half , its investors lost billions in U.S. real_estate and it is in the throes of political change . Yet , it is the revisionist view of Japan that still drives U.S. Japan policy . The Administration is right to make economics the centerpiece of U.S.-Japanese relations and to demand more responsible Japanese behavior . But the style and substance of its approach are likely to be counterproductive . There is a near-term danger of imperiling the political and security aspects of the relationship . Longer term , there is a risk that bullying tactics amid change in Japan will fuel those who view Japan as part of Asia rather than part of the West -- to the detriment of Asian stability . The irony of the Administration ' s Asia policy is that , in its yuppie desire for instant gratification , it is fighting battles it is almost certain to win -- if it practiced patience . The consistent pattern in East Asia has been that export-led economic_growth produces a large urban middle_class that then demands political participation and pluralism . Thus , inspired by the &quot; people power &quot; revolution in the Philippines , South_Korea began to democratize in 1988 . Taiwan has undergone a similar process and in Thailand , in 1993 , activists armed with cellular_phones forced_out the generals and restored democratic rule . In a sense , China ' s Tian An Men was an effort by new social forces created by economic reform to assert themselves politically . As long as economic reform expands , political reform in China will follow . Beijing ' s octogenarians are not immortal . Clinton ' s call_for a &quot; New Pacific Community &quot; is right . But it comes just as Asia is coming of_age . Asians are trading and investing with each other far more_than with America . As U.S. markets diminish , so does U.S. leverage . Beyond shared interests and shared responsibility , there is a need for mutual respect if a sense of community is to be built . Asians are quick to point_out the imperfections in American society -- from the murder rate to illiteracy . Unless the United States pursues a more enlightened engagement in the Asia-Pacific , it may find itself increasingly marginalized .</TEXT>
