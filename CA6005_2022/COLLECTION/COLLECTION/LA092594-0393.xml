   <HEADLINE> AMERICA AS DISNEY ' S LAND : THE FANTASY VS . THE REALITY ; CULTURE : A NATION MIRRORED BY THE COMPANY ' S CREATIONS RE-EXAMINES THE IMAGE REFLECTED IN ITS CORPORATE AGENDA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The upstairs bedroom that belongs_to 8-year-old Kelly Urso is a veritable shrine to &quot; 101 Dalmatians. &quot; She has the bedspread , the pajamas , the notebook , the lunch box . So in_love is she with the Walt Disney Co. ' s animated spotted dog that her dad plunked_down $ 150 for a real one . But downstairs , in the basement that belongs_to Kelly ' s 39-year-old father , is a bunker recently converted to run the Walt Disney Co . out of the state of Virginia . Tony Urso is installing a second phone_line , buying a second computer in his escalating war to stop Disney from building its fifth theme park next to his hometown of Haymarket . He traded the beloved Washington Redskins vanity plates on his blue Bronco for a set that says NO DZNEY . Kelly and her sister had to see &quot; The Lion King &quot; with their grandparents . The split loyalties that manage to peacefully coexist in the Urso household are not unlike the ones that have lately left the country confused and divided over Disney . As this entertainment giant sets_out to define America in a 3 # 000-acre theme park , so does the nation struggle to define a company with a cultural impact so profound that Mickey_Mouse is a symbol for America abroad . Like it or not , the Walt Disney Co . has helped rear two generations of Americans in the past 50 years , influencing everything from our moral code to the way we stand_in line at the bank . But do we love ' em or do we hate ' em ? Is Disney the genius creator of &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; or a big-footed , money-grubbing developer ? We subscribe_to the Disney Channel as one of the few things on television a parent can trust , only to blast the company for a worldview so sugarcoated it makes one ' s teeth ache . We affectionately dub its creator &quot; Uncle Walt , &quot; only to read in a controversial biography that he was really a booze-addled anti-Semite in cahoots with the FBI . &quot; It drives you nuts , &quot; said Karal Ann Marling , professor of American studies and art history at the University of Minnesota , where she teaches an annual course on Disney . &quot; On the one hand , this company is part of the fiber of who we are . On the other hand , it ' s a company , and we don ' t like them when they act like one. &quot; Now Disney developers want to put Disney ' s America -- a $ 650-million tribute to the nation ' s history -- smack in the cradle of democracy , and our ambivalence is bubbling_up all_over . Even as some of the country ' s most revered historians warn that Disney will &quot; vulgarize history , &quot; Northern Virginia businesses are hanging_out banners proclaiming &quot; We Love Mickey. &quot; When it comes_to Disney , America can ' t seem to make_up its mind . * It was 1955 and the Walt Disney Co . was_on the verge of setting_off a cultural revolution . &quot; Davy Crockett , &quot; the frontier television_show starring Fess Parker , was a baby-boomer smash , and Disney decided it might be profitable to slap the Crockett image on lunch pails , pencil_boxes and various other kid equipment . &quot; They ran_out of fur for coonskin_caps . No craze had ever made so_much money to that point_in_time , something like $ 300 million , &quot; said Margaret King , a cultural historian retained by the Walt Disney Co . to assess the company ' s cultural impact . &quot; It was the first time marketers realized that children could influence the way their parents spend money. &quot; That was neither the first nor the last time that Disney would fundamentally alter what it meant to be a child growing_up in America . It is impossible to measure an average child ' s exposure to Disney in a day . From home videos to classroom instructional films to shopping_mall outlets , the corporate presence is overwhelming and pervasive : Disney lays_claim to the No . 1 box_office hit of the summer ( &quot; The Lion King &quot; ) ; the No . 1 Broadway show ( &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; ) ; the No . 1 network TV series ( &quot; Home Improvement &quot; ) ; the No . 1 music album ( &quot; Lion King &quot; soundtrack ) . Disney has influenced American culture in more ways than most of us realize -- or care to acknowledge . If the space_program gave us Teflon , the Walt Disney Co . gave us the twisting &quot; switch-back &quot; lines we stand_in at the bank and springy asphalt that keeps the feet from tiring . The monorail at the Houston airport is modeled after the one at Disneyland . The Victorian_architecture of the redeveloped downtown in Medina , Ohio , is said to have been inspired by Disneyland ' s Main_Street USA . &quot; Almost anybody who knows about urban development , restoration and design has been to Disneyland or Disney World , &quot; said Richard Francaviglia , director of the Center for Southwestern Studies at the University of Texas at Arlington , who has written extensively about the Disney influence on American towns . Years of Disney moralizing has to some degree shaped American minds . Some experts suggest that it was the Disney nature films of the 1950s that gave_rise to the ecology movement a decade later ; that it was the anti-war message in Disney movies ( one character in the middle of an Alamo battle notes that war is &quot; the most untheatrical method of suicide &quot; ) that planted the seeds for demonstrations against the Vietnam_War . &quot; Those ( Disney ) experiences shaped those of us who were at Woodstock , &quot; Marling said . &quot; I can ' t imagine the Vietnam_War protests in some ways without all_of us having sat around watching ' The Walt Disney Show. ' &quot; With this resume of goodness and success , Disney officials expected to be roundly cheered when they announced they would pay homage to America with &quot; virtual_reality &quot; re-enactments of Civil War combat and other epic events , not to mention a 27-hole golf_course , 2 # 300 homes , 1.9 million square_feet of shops and businesses -- all_of which would entice 6.3 million tourists to pour an estimated $ 48 million a year into the Virginia state treasury . Disney officials expected resistance from no-growth residents opposed to Bermuda-shorted and fanny-packed hordes invading their pretty countryside . They were not surprised when amateur astronomers grumbled that Disney lights would mess_up their view of the skies . But never did they anticipate that what began as a local land-use dispute would explode into a national &quot; referendum on Disney , &quot; as CEO Michael Eisner put it . The company was stunned . &quot; We continue to be dumbstruck that the critical pencils have been so sharpened before we ' ve done anything . This is very early in the design process , &quot; said Mark Pacala , general_manager of Disney ' s America . &quot; We are not just Mickey_Mouse animators . We are a much richer , more contextual company than that. &quot; Seldom have the plans of a single company attracted such international scrutiny . The mayor of Haymarket , population 483 , found himself being interviewed by the BBC . Countless editorials and opinion pieces have warned that Disney will &quot; plasticize . . . sentimentalize . . . sanitize &quot; American history , some authored by historians who concede they have never once set foot in a Disney park . The great debate went all_the way to Congress , where this summer a Senate panel heard testimony on the virtues and vices of Disney . Is Disney worthy of countryside so pristine George_Washington might still recognize it ? Will Disney ' s synthetic version of history just four miles from the sacred site of two Civil War battles ruin the real_thing ? Can Disney be trusted to honestly interpret America ' s sometimes shameful past ? &quot; EEEK A Mouse ! Step_on It ! &quot; a Washington Post headline shrieked as some of the nation ' s most revered historians -- David McCullough and Shelby Foote -- allied_with the landed gentry who live_out there -- Robert Duvall , Willard Scott -- to turn_back Disney . The frenzy was fueled when a Disney executive predicted a park exhibit that would &quot; make you feel what it was like to be a slave. &quot; Eisner later recanted the notion , but not before critics went wild over the idea of human bondage as seen_through the eyes of Mickey . &quot; I would have no objection to kids learning what a frontier village looked_like . I might want to go myself , &quot; said William Styron , who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1968 for his novel about slavery , &quot; The Confessions of Nat Turner. &quot; &quot; But trying to deal with the fundamental horrors of American history -- with 250 years of slavery -- in an amusement_park ? It ' s ludicrous . They can ' t do_it . No one can. &quot; Some academics point to the company ' s film legacy as evidence that Disney is capable of treating history in ways that are &quot; not all sweetness and light. &quot; In &quot; Tonka , &quot; a 1958 account of Custer ' s last stand , at the Little_Bighorn , the Sioux are the good_guys and Custer is an &quot; untrustworthy , racist , lunatic , glory hunter. &quot; In &quot; 20 # 000 Leagues Under the Sea , &quot; a Cold War-era film in which an ultimate-weapon submarine ultimately destroys itself and everyone else -- is regarded by many critics as an early argument against the nuclear arms race . Even Disney ' s portrayal of women has become more socially correct , experts argue , with a love-struck Snow White yielding to an ambitious , aspiring archeologist named Ariel in &quot; The Little Mermaid. &quot; But even Disney ' s defenders are quick to note that when one mentions the Walt Disney Co. , &quot; Tonka &quot; -- later retitled &quot; A Horse Named Comanche &quot; -- is not exactly the first thing that comes_to_mind . Mickey_Mouse ' s public image may be_well intact , but the corporation is at a crossroads , experts say , and the battle in northern Virginia is proof of it . &quot; Disney is our national storyteller , the primary cultural ' imprinter ' of what it means for children to be American , &quot; said Jamie O ' Boyle , a Philadelphia-based cultural analyst who has spent years studying Disney . &quot; But if they come_in and act like a hard-boiled , profit-minded , bottom-line company , we are going_to treat them accordingly. &quot; * Jack Kapp , the mayor of Haymarket , answers the door in his stocking feet . He runs a busy wallpaper business , but always finds time to talk Disney , the biggest thing to happen in Haymarket , he says , since Union troops sacked it in the Civil War . If this town didn ' t already exist , Disney might have invented it . Haymarket has two dentists , one doctor , one bank , two beauty_shops , two full-time police_officers and 95 houses . It looks_for all_the world like Mayberry , but it isn ' t . The town cannot afford public water ; the residents get theirs from eight wells , four of which were declared contaminated when they were tested three summers ago . People don ' t know each other all that well anymore , so_much of their time is spent on_the_road commuting to jobs somewhere bigger . The recession hit Haymarket hard ; Gossam ' s Hardware_Store , which grossed $ 1 million in 1989 , brought_in just $ 383 # 000 last year . &quot; It ' s a wonder I ' m sane . This place is a desert , &quot; hardware_store owner Tim Everett grumbles in his store one afternoon beneath a mounted deer ' s head , a hunting cap stuck irreverently on its antlers . &quot; Every time a business leaves , nothing comes_in to replace it. &quot; If Disney builds its park across the road , Haymarket gets water . The beleaguered roads that lead to and through it get rebuilt . There will be a summer job for Mayor Kapp ' s teen-age granddaughter and a tax windfall for Prince William County , where schools are so crowded some children are learning in trailers . This is the face Disney loves to show , the economic messiah it longs to be . Already the company is working hard at being a good neighbor , setting_up its neat headquarters in what used to be the telephone_company and donating $ 1 # 000 to the LaFayette Day celebration . Some people in Haymarket are virtually blushing from all_the attention . &quot; Zippity Doo Dah ! &quot; a local paper squealed . Although there are still some 70 permits to secure , the project last week won the blessings of the Prince William County Planning_Commission and is almost certain to get county supervisors ' approval in October . But as ever , there is a flip side to this success-in-the-making story , one that spotlights Disney ' s least flattering face -- corporate , the side that made $ 8.5 billion in revenue last year , the side that once paid its CEO $ 203 million , the side , critics say , that has behaved more like a ruthless company than the American institution it is supposed to be . Disney officials bought the options on the Virginia land in secret , retained one of state ' s most influential law_firms and hired powerful lobbyists , one of them former Jimmy_Carter press secretary Jody Powell , to steer their project through the state Legislature . They waited until the last possible day to ask the Legislature for an unprecedented $ 163 million in road improvement bonds , then threatened to walk away unless they got what they wanted . They got_it . Not since the National Rifle Assn . has an organization lobbied the state_capital as hard as Disney has , angry critics charge . If an oil_company practiced such strategy , it might be called savvy . But Disney , which has moralized for half a century about virtue and fair play , is held by the public to a different standard . Glimpsing Disney in a real_estate deal is a little like watching Mother Teresa play the slots . There ' s nothing illegal about it , it just doesn ' t seem right . &quot; If Disney were a country , it would be Israel , &quot; cultural historian King said . &quot; Their reputation is almost a burden . There are things they cannot do with impunity that other companies can. &quot; Equally infuriating to opponents , however , is a sort of corporate arrogance that has haunted Disney from Long_Beach to France . &quot; We have the right to build , &quot; Eisner and other executives insist again and again of the Virginia plan . They dismiss as &quot; cheap-shotness &quot; any criticism of the park ' s rides and attractions , of what Disney might do with the subject of slavery , &quot; until the day the gates open in 1998. &quot; It is difficult to envision such words coming from the lips of Walt Disney , experts say , a man who used television to inform the nation of Disneyland ' s long construction . By the end , the citizens felt_like stockholders , Disneyland was theirs , they had seen its birth . Corporate Disney today might do_well to spend a little more time thinking the way Walt did , several experts agreed . &quot; I see Disney defending the ( Virginia ) park , they are defensive and not very forthcoming , which is really silly , &quot; Marling said . &quot; I don ' t think Walt would have asked the people to just trust him . Walt would have explained . They are part of the fabric of our lives . It ' s time they acted that way. &quot; Disney officials vigorously disagree . The corporation is &quot; revered , loved and admired throughout the entire world , &quot; according to Pacala . They say Disney has behaved admirably in Virginia , pointing to several concessions already made to appease a worried community by expanding wooded areas , banning diesel_engines at the park , even floating balloons to make_sure that the tallest of the planned structures could not be seen from the tranquil countryside . But winning the public seems harder lately . Disney ' s proposed park near the Queen Mary in Long_Beach was scrapped in recent years after environmentalists and residents revolted . A small but vocal group of Anaheim homeowners has been protesting the noise and traffic that would result from a proposed $ 3-billion Disneyland Resort project . Protesters in turtle suits picketed the company ' s annual stockholders ' meeting in Florida last year in opposition to further development in the habitat of the endangered gopher_tortoise around Disney World . This is not the first time that Disney has come under public fire in its long history . Before World_War_II , British censors banned &quot; Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs &quot; as too violent and forbade anyone under 17 from seeing it . ( The ban was lifted after a public outcry. ) Film critics initially decided the classic &quot; Fantasia &quot; was a big bomb . Hippies stormed Disneyland ' s Tom_Sawyer ' s Island in 1970 in an anti-Establishment protest , stripped naked and smoked pot , according to O ' Boyle . &quot; They recognized Disneyland , correctly , as a metaphor for America , &quot; O ' Boyle said , suggesting that one reason we can ' t make_up our minds about Disney is because Disney is us . It ' s like spotting the wires in a magic act . When we look too closely , we don ' t like what we see -- a Fortune 500 company lurking behind a lovable cartoon mouse . &quot; Disney is so closely tied_in with a national psyche of who we are , the things we like about ourselves , that we don ' t like the idea there ' s a corporation behind it , &quot; O ' Boyle said . &quot; As much as anything , this is about us. &quot; It Started with a Mouse Since Mickey_Mouse made his debut as &quot; Steamboat Willie &quot; in a 1928 cartoon , the Walt Disney Co. ' s creations have become an integral part of American and world culture . Theme parks , a chain of specialty_stores , movie studios and a cable_television channel all have spun_off from the big-eared icon with red knee britches and white gloves . Some of the points made by Disney boosters and critics : Movies and Television Pros : * Nature movies encourage an interest in the environment . * Television_programs and films celebrate fairness , self-reliance and sense of community . * Nature films demystify the wilderness by personalizing animals . * Historical programs foster &quot; good_guys &quot; and heroic traits . Cons : * Movies humanize animals , giving a distorted view . * Simple stories simply told lack depth and diversity . * &quot; Evil element &quot; of a story is there only so the good side can eventually triumph . * Historical accounts are sanitized , sometimes to extremes . Theme Parks Pros : * Millions of people entertained . * Parks are economic engines directly providing jobs and economic development . * Rides geared to heighten fears , challenge rider to take risks . Cons : * Parks predicated on using automobile . * Heavy traffic contributes pollution , wears_down infrastructure . * Urban sprawl outside gates is sometimes ugly , overcrowded . * Host communities said to be co-opted and succumb to Disney power , often at local expense . Merchandise Pros : * The ultimate one-stop shop for everything Disney . * Merchandise does not promote or glorify violence or war . Cons : * Customers pay a steep price for merchandise bearing a Disney image . * Keyed to desires of children , who have no sense of restraint .
