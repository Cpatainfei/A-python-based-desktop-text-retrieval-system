   <HEADLINE> STUDY FINDS LUMPECTOMY AS EFFECTIVE AS MASTECTOMY ; HEALTH : RESULTS SUPPORT EXPERIMENT THAT WAS CLOUDED BY FALSIFIED DATA . LESS-INVASIVE SURGERY IS CALLED UNDERUSED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a study that experts hope will provide reassurance to thousands of nervous breast_cancer patients , UC Irvine researchers have confirmed that lumpectomy -- in which only the cancerous tumor , rather than the entire breast , is removed -- is just as safe and effective as mastectomy . But , the research found , many women who are eligible for the procedure do not get_it . The findings come_on the heels of a major controversy over falsified data in a massive international breast_cancer study that advocated lumpectomy in conjunction with radiation_therapy . Experts hope that the new results will comfort lumpectomy patients who are wondering if they made the right choice . Yet the study of 5 # 892 Orange County women in 126 Southern California hospitals may be as troubling as it is comforting . The researchers uncovered stark disparities in the way breast_cancer patients are treated , and found that whether a patient lived or died after surgery depended in part on the type of hospital in which she received care . Those in large hospitals fared the best . &quot; This again emphasizes that lumpectomy and radiation is very acceptable therapy , &quot; said Dr. Harmon Eyre , chief medical_officer for the American Cancer Society . &quot; But the second message is that you want to have cancer care given_in an institution where they pay_attention to quality of care , and those are generally the large institutions with the larger_number of cases. &quot; Published in today ' s issue of the Journal of the American Medical Assn. , the UC Irvine study examined medical_records for white_women whose breast_cancer was diagnosed between 1984 and 1990 . It is the first in the nation to compare the treatment and survival of breast_cancer patients by hospital type . It found that : * Women who went_to university-affiliated teaching hospitals were far more likely than others to have lumpectomies . Experts estimate that 70 % of all breast_cancer patients are eligible for the procedure , also known as breast-conserving surgery , or BCS . Toward the end of the six-year study period , the researchers reported , 70 % of patients in teaching hospitals had lumpectomies . In other hospitals , about 25 % had lumpectomies ; the rest had mastectomies , a far more invasive surgery in which the entire breast is removed . &quot; There is an urgent need to encourage more frequent use by physicians of recommended BCS plus radiation in qualified women , &quot; the researchers wrote . * Patients in large hospitals -- those with more_than 200 beds -- fared the best . They were 26 % less likely to die in the five years after surgery than those who had lumpectomies or mastectomies in small hospitals . * Patients in HMO hospitals -- both large and small -- fared poorly . HMO patients with &quot; localized &quot; breast_cancer -- meaning the disease had not spread -- were almost twice as likely to die during the five-year post-surgery period as those treated in large hospitals , and their chance of dying was 63 % greater than women whose operations took_place in small hospitals . However , the researchers found , HMO hospital_care was improving toward the end of the study period , and those with &quot; regionalized &quot; cancer , meaning the disease had spread , fared about the same as patients in small hospitals . * All other factors considered , women who chose lumpectomy with radiation were just as likely to survive as those who had mastectomies . This finding confirms research conducted by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project , the large-scale study that has recently come under scrutiny amid disclosures that a Canadian doctor had falsified data . That study was headed by renowned cancer researcher Dr. Bernard Fisher of the University of Pittsburgh , who was forced to step_down after the disclosures . It examined the use of lumpectomy in a controlled clinical trial , with carefully selected patients who met strict criteria , and were then picked_at random to undergo either lumpectomy or mastectomy . In contrast , the Irvine study used medical_records to take a snapshot of how breast_cancer surgery is practiced in a suburban_area , in this case Orange County . Names of patients and hospitals were kept confidential . &quot; It ' s really an illustration of how does ( lumpectomy ) work_out there in the community , &quot; said epidemiologist Anna Lee-Feldstein , the lead author of the study . &quot; This shows that the findings of the Fisher study really are applicable to the community at large. &quot; Breast_cancer is the most common cancer in women . In the United States , experts estimate that 182 # 000 women will be diagnosed with breast_cancer this year , and 46 # 000 will die of it . ( The disease also strikes a small number of men ; about 1 # 000 each year. ) Treatment for breast_cancer has changed dramatically in the past two decades . As recently as the 1970s , doctors were performing radical_mastectomies , a disfiguring surgery in which the entire breast as well as pectoral_muscle were removed . The trend then shifted to &quot; total &quot; mastectomy , in which only the breast and lymph_nodes are removed , and later , in the wake of Fisher ' s 1985 study , to lumpectomies in combination with radiation treatment . At least eight other studies have confirmed Fisher ' s results , which even with the falsified data are not in_dispute . But the Irvine research shows that not all doctors and women have taken_heed of his findings . &quot; A lot of it is physician bias , &quot; said Dr. Susan Love , a nationally regarded breast_cancer expert at UCLA . &quot; I saw a patient today and the surgeon said to her : ' Well , I know they showed that ( lumpectomy is just as safe ) but I ' ve been doing mastectomies for a long_time and I don ' t care what the studies show. &quot; Others say patients , particularly older_women who grew_up with the notion that the entire breast should be cut_out at the first sign of cancer , are frightened of lumpectomy . &quot; Some very intelligent , clear-thinking women do not want to have a lumpectomy and radiation_therapy , &quot; said Eyre of the American Cancer Society . &quot; Some women just want to get the diseased organ gone . They feel better when the breast is removed. &quot;</TEXT>
