   <HEADLINE> HOME INVASION ROBBERS CAST A WIDER NET ; CRIME : PERPETRATORS AND VICTIMS HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN ASIAN , BUT NOW GANGS ARE BECOMING LESS SELECTIVE AND TARGETS INCLUDE WHITES , LATINOS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a Friday afternoon last October , two attackers forced their way into the Westminster home of a 79-year-old woman , tied her up with an electrical cord and stuffed a ball of yarn into her mouth before ransacking her home and stealing her purse . The brazen crime was similar to hundreds of other &quot; home invasion &quot; robberies reported in Orange County over the past five years , the vast majority of which have been committed by Asian gangs , police say . But in this crime , there was one difference : The victim was not Asian . In the past , police say , gangs have almost always preyed on fellow Asians , capitalizing on cultural and language_barriers that keep many victims from going_to police . But authorities warn that the attack on the 79-year-old white_woman , and others like it , may signal that robbers are widening the range of their targets . &quot; The gangs are starting to get less selective , &quot; said Westminster Police Detective Mark Nye , a specialist on Asian gangs . &quot; Wherever the money is , that ' s where they are going_to go. &quot; There have been several other incidents in the past seven months in which non-Asians have been terrorized in their homes , reportedly by Asian gang members . Two of the robberies occurred in Westminster and one in San Juan Capistrano . Home invasions have been most common in Westminster , Garden Grove and Santa Ana , which have sizable Asian populations . At least 150 of the attacks have been reported in those three cities since 1991 . But home invasion robberies have also been reported in Anaheim , Buena Park , Costa Mesa , Cypress , Dana Point , Irvine , La Habra , Orange , Seal Beach and Yorba Linda in the same time_period . Officials estimate that there may actually be many_more home invasion robberies than the number reported . Police say that such crimes often go unreported because some Asians harbor a mistrust of police that may stem from experiences with authorities in their native countries . &quot; The gangsters I ' ve talked to say they are targeting victims they know aren ' t going_to report the crime , &quot; Nye said . Other victims remain silent because of fear of retaliation by the attackers , who often threaten to come_back and kill family members if they report the crime , Nye said . Other victims , police said , may be involved in illegal gambling or might be operating a business illegally out of their home . * Police also say copycat home invasions have begun to show_up around the county . Last June , Seal Beach experienced what is believed to be its first home invasion robbery when three robbers , one carrying an Uzi submachine_gun and another a semiautomatic weapon , forced their way into a home . Both the robbers and the victims in this case were white , police said . In Santa Ana and Costa Mesa , there have been at least five recent cases of home invasion robberies committed by Latinos against other Latinos , police said . &quot; Some of these people might be learning the crime from Asian gangsters in prison or maybe they ' ve seen it on television , &quot; Nye said . &quot; I think now we are going_to be seeing more non-Asian victims and there will be more attention focused_on this crime , because these victims might speak out more. &quot; In Garden Grove , the number of home invasions peaked in 1991 , when 58 were reported . But the number declined dramatically in following years . In 1992 , there were 17 home invasions reported , and last year there were just 14 . &quot; I think the gang members are starting to learn that their crime carries a fairly stiff penalty as opposed to doing other kinds of crimes , &quot; said Bruce Davis , an officer with the Garden Grove gang unit . &quot; It ' s just not worth it. &quot; In Westminster , which does not keep annual statistics on home invasions , there have been approximately 35 to 40 attacks since 1991 , said Detective Mike Proctor . While Asian gangsters have typically targeted upper-income areas , the home invasions involving Latino gunmen have not occurred in wealthy neighborhoods , said Santa Ana Police Cpl . Futi Semanu , who works with the department ' s gang unit . &quot; They tend to commit home invasions in lower-income areas , hoping the residents have something of_value , &quot; Semanu said . Proctor , who investigates home invasion robberies , said the spread of home invasion robberies to non-Asian victims is not a totally unexpected development . &quot; The gangs had previously gone from only committing residential burglaries on Asians to burglarizing anyone , &quot; Proctor said . &quot; We knew that eventually they would start robbing non-Asian families . They don ' t change their ( method of operation ) , just their victims. &quot; The robberies , which police have dubbed &quot; home invasions &quot; because of the military-style precision with which they are planned and executed , were first reported in Orange County in 1988 . In a typical attack , gangsters force their way in , tie_up and brutalize family members -- often sexually assaulting the women and beating the men -- before escaping with money , jewelry and other valuables . The robberies are often well-planned . Attackers find_out all they can about the house , the residents and the kinds of valuables inside the home . Some even study floor_plans of the house and conduct surveillance before carrying_out the attack , Nye said . &quot; They may know one or more of the victims personally , &quot; Nye said . &quot; It might be an ex-boyfriend or girlfriend , a casual acquaintance and maybe even a roommate . It could be an inside job. &quot; The attackers use a variety of approaches to gain access to a home . One of the most common methods is to send a female gang member to knock_on the door and make contact with the victims . &quot; She will look very innocent and ask_for someone who lives_in the house . Then the others will rush in behind her , &quot; Nye said . * Attackers have also followed business owners home and attacked them there . Merchants in Westminster ' s Little Saigon have been targets more_than once . In December , a Costa Mesa family that owns a jewelry_store in Little Saigon was robbed of $ 20 # 000 in cash and jewelry after five masked men with semiautomatic weapons burst into their home . It was the second time in four years that the family had been robbed at gunpoint inside their home . But other approaches have been used as well . Two weeks ago , Proctor said a robber came_to the front_door of a woman ' s Westminster home carrying a package and dressed in what looked_like a deliveryman ' s uniform . When a woman opened the door to sign for the package , the attacker pulled_out a gun and forced his way into the home . While police concede that it is often difficult to make arrests in home invasion attacks , Garden Grove officials said they have been having more success in recent years in identifying suspects . Detective Dale Walker said they identified suspects in 10 of the 14 home invasion robberies in 1993 . Nye said he would like to see legislation passed which would make home invasion robberies a federal offense like carjacking . Foiling Home Invasions Hundreds of home invasion robberies have been committed in Orange County during the past five years . How to prevent becoming a victim : * Know who is at your door before you open it . * Install proper lighting both front and behind your home . * Trim shrubs and bushes around the front_door where intruders could hide . * Pay_attention while driving_home . If you believe you are being followed , drive to the nearest police_station . * Secure your front_door with double bolts . Sources : Westminster and Garden Grove police_departments</TEXT>
