   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW ; GERMAN FOOD LIGHTENS UP ; THE NEW GERMAN COOKBOOK : MORE THAN 230 CONTEMPORARY AND TRADITIONAL RECIPES , BY JEAN ANDERSON AND HEDY WURZ ; ( HARPERCOLLINS : $ 25 ; 416 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Time was when some bastions of German cooking enjoyed real international renown . But not in very recent time . The great hotels of the casino towns , spas and Hansa ports were at their zenith before World_War I . At tony pre-Depression men ' s clubs , wealthy Berliners dined as augustly as wealthy Londoners . Between the wars , Alfred Walterspiel , among the reigning European chefs of his age , presided over a celebrated kitchen at the Four Seasons Hotel in Munich . And then -- well , when postwar America started busily &quot; discovering &quot; that people knew how to cook in a_zillion other parts of the world , the food of Germany was mostly ignored . Winning_back enough eclat to reach American awareness took a while , though a canny observer could have guessed that the territory pictured in Mimi Sheraton ' s fine &quot; The German Cookbook &quot; ( published in 1965 and still an endlessly pleasurable introduction ) was no kitchen wasteland . In time , food professionals who read the language began seeking_out first-rate publications from West Germany ( for a long_time a center of interesting food photography and reference_works ) . In the 1970s and ' 80s , glowing reports and Michelin stars signaled the rising trajectories of a_few bright young post- nouvelle chefs . American and even French tourists at last began to visit Munich in quest of drop-dead elegant restaurants . Around the time of reunification , a New Yorker cartoon fantasized a Berlin-style cafe as the next wave of Manhattan chic . Jean Anderson and Hedy Wurz ' s enjoyable new survey clearly acknowledges the current wave of glamour , but without the too-familiar tactic of ignorantly brushing_aside anything more ancient than last Thursday . Their take_on the &quot; new &quot; German scene capably steers between reportorial judgment of recent developments and home cooks ' personal gleanings . Different insular possibilities of the subject are firmly rejected . This isn ' t a trend-spotters ' Germany of gaudy invention or a pretentious archaizers ' Germany of supposed Ur-ingredients . It is also a long way from the Reformhaus , the health-food store , which has many earnest Teutonic devotees -- or the very , very German wonderland of everything canned , powdered and instantized . * What ' s left is far from negative despite the absence of some illustrious traditional specialties like steak_tartare , May_wine , Rapunzel ( mache ) salad , or fruit_compotes . The Anderson-Wurz new Germany rapidly defines itself as a domain of pleasant hobby-cooks and chefs from whom the old Deutsche Ku che blends naturally into newer_styles . Of the roughly 215 recipes , most could be described as &quot; traditional , with a difference. &quot; A very few are the kind of opulent presentations that might grace stylish restaurant menus anywhere from Brussels to Seattle -- for example , a warm salad of roast squab and julienned vegetables with a dressing based on the pan drippings , or a sole-salmon-lobster terrine served with a sorrel-dill sauce . More are sturdy old faithfuls like apple-horseradish sauce , boiled beef , sauerkraut and apples cooked in Riesling , Zimtsterne ( cinnamon stars , without which Christmas is hardly official in many households ) , or Bohnen , Birnen , und Speck ( green_beans , pears , and bacon -- a strange-sounding but venerable combination ) . And many give a traditional dish a minor facelift or whimsical spin -- e.g. , Bavarian cream with fine pumpernickel crumbs in the custard , some filo-wrapped versions of things that would more usually be made with short pastry or yeast dough , or chef Eckhart Witzigmann ' s &quot; Lebkuchen souffle. &quot; ( This has no earthly connection with Lebkuchen , the dense , chewy German equivalent of gingerbread , except that it contains some of the same spices. ) The sort of mix that Anderson and Wurz are_after is obvious from a little browsing . The appetizer section is almost entirely devoted to fish and seafood , anything from miniature potato_pancakes prettily adorned with smoked salmon rounds or vinegar-marinated raw fish_fillets in sour cream-herb sauce to good old Rollmops or herring_salad . Pungent , smelly cheese_spreads of the &quot; handcheese &quot; and &quot; cooked cheese &quot; tribes are notably missing . But the authors take great pains with the different members of the dumpling family and the traditional holiday yeast breads . The bread chapter also investigates home-baked non-sweet breads , ignored in the Sheraton book . ( Germans historically have been able to buy a splendid variety of breads including dense , flavorful rye and mixed-grain loaves from their local bakers , who also supplied the sourdough starter for those who wanted to make sourdough_breads at_home ; from-scratch bread-baking is a relatively new field for sophisticated hobby-cooks. ) A handful of interesting venison recipes testify to this abiding German passion -- in the most unusual , the meat is roasted in a coating of pureed chestnuts . The national love of wild mushrooms finds lively expression in a sauce for pork medallions , a filling for crepes and a noble-sounding combination of asparagus and morels . * One part of the &quot; new German &quot; emphasis strikes me as limiting : the heavy reliance on kitchen machinery . Many recipes tie you to an electric_mixer or food_processor without mentioning hand methods as alternatives , even for something as simple as pureeing raspberries . I also wish that the many mentions of &quot; rich beef_broth ( preferably homemade ) &quot; in ingredients lists had moved someone to provide a recipe for the characteristic German beef_broth with its interesting accents of celery_root , parsley root and leek , a major building_block of the cuisine for those who don ' t joyously substitute that classic German expedient , the Suppenwurfel ( bouillon_cube ) . Another minor annoyance for people who grew_up on the German name of some old favorite is that the index almost wholly omits German terms , even for such familiar dishes as Hasenpfeffer or Maultaschen . ( Sheraton ' s &quot; German Cookbook &quot; has separate German and English indices , a nice touch that few publishers would spring for nowadays. ) On the other hand , Anderson and Wurz provide a long and intelligent glossary of German culinary terms that ' s almost a book ' s worth of information in its own_right . This volume also has a good chapter on German wine and beer by the late Lamar Elmore , an unintimidating primer for those ordinarily driven_up the wall by words like Trockenbeerenauslese . Jean Anderson ' s reputation for clear , reliable directions was amply borne_out by my three cooking experiments . A full-flavored but surprisingly subtle mussel soup was a good_example of an approach that seems to be frequent here : making use of rich ingredients like cream and egg_yolks without apology but also in a decidedly careful , restrained manner to give the suggestion of creaminess rather than a lushly opulent texture . Onions hollowed_out and baked with a savory pork filling had the faint bittersweet headiness of the dark_beer used to finish the sauce . Best of all were braised veal shanks -- not left in one piece as they often are in German treatments of this cut , but sawed into rounds osso buco-style and served with a rich , intense sour_cream sauce . * The great attention of this book is that it is soundly enough rooted in traditional cooking to please those loyal to past memories , shrewdly enough geared to the cosmopolitan present to make prejudiced American cooks take a second look_at &quot; that soggy German cooking , &quot; but not heavy-handed in pursuit of either goal . Many -- if not most -- of the familiar areas are covered more thoroughly in Mimi Sheraton ' s book , but Anderson and Wurz excel in discreet , uncontrived originality .</TEXT>
