   <HEADLINE> FAMILY ; MANHATTAN TRANSFER ADDS LIFE TO ' TUBA '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chances are that if you went_to school before the arts were hacked out of the budget , you whiled away an easy hour in grade_school being introduced to orchestral music through a scratchy vinyl recording of &quot; Tubby the Tuba. &quot; Remember the endearing , &quot; fat little tuba &quot; who conquers self-doubt when he learns that the orchestra needs his &quot; oom-pah , oom-pah &quot; ? Performed the world over since 1942 , Tubby has been narrated by big names from Danny Kaye to Carol Channing . In its latest incarnation , one of the world ' s great jazz quartets turns a children ' s classic into rediscovered treasure . &quot; The Manhattan Transfer Meets Tubby the Tuba , &quot; a recent release from Summit Records , includes all four of the Tubby stories , written by Paul Tripp and composed by George Kleinsinger from 1942 on . The sequels to the original found Tubby running_away to the circus , joining a marching band and jamming with a jazz_band -- the only time you ' ll hear the Transfer ' s signature harmonies . Not to worry , however . There ' s plenty to like on this sweet album , from the expressiveness of the Naples Philharmonic Orchestra and tuba soloist Tommy Johnson , to the comic characterizations and vocal solos by Transfer members -- catch Alan Paul ' s deep-voiced Bullfrog . Notably , the material isn ' t compromised with contemporary attitude or updated references . Instead , listeners are treated , as intended , to the sweep , drive and bounce of the orchestra and gentle stories with messages for both heart and mind . * &quot; The Manhattan Transfer Meets Tubby the Tuba , &quot; Summit Records .
