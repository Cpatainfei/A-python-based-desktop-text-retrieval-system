   <HEADLINE> READY FOR MC MICKEY ? ; POP_MUSIC : DISNEY LOOKS FOR CROSSOVER SUCCESS WITH ORIGINAL SONGS AND PARODIES OF RAP HITS ON ' MICKEY UNRAPPED. ' BUT USING THE CONTROVERSIAL GENRE MAY PROVE RISKY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Disney ' s making rap_music ? It may seem like an odd partnership : the conservative , squeaky-clean Disney and a controversial music genre frequently slammed for misogynistic , sex-and-violence content . Yet before the mega-success of Walt Disney Records ' &quot; Aladdin &quot; and &quot; The Lion King &quot; soundtracks , what was the company ' s big bonanza ? If you guessed &quot; The Jungle Book , &quot; &quot; Fantasia &quot; or &quot; Mary Poppins , &quot; guess again : It was 1979 ' s &quot; Mickey_Mouse Disco &quot; that took double platinum honors . So here comes &quot; Mickey Unrapped , &quot; a riskier_venture into urban musical territory , which Disney hopes will bring similar success . The all-rap album is set for release Tuesday , featuring Mickey , Minnie , Goofy et al . mixing it up in original songs and parodies of rap hits with Tag Team rap duo , Color Me Badd and Whoopi Goldberg . On the album cover is Mickey , his hands gesturing in vague rap style , wearing street gangsta chic : a backward baseball_cap and oversize baggy jeans , belted well below his skinny waist . Mark Jaffe , vice_president of Walt Disney Records , expects major crossover appeal . &quot; There are more rap albums purchased in suburban America than urban America . Rap has truly taken_over the American popular psyche like no other since disco , &quot; he enthused . &quot; We think the popularity of this parody of rap will be enormous . &quot; Mickey ' s really into his rapping : ' I ' m so cool , My ice_cream never melts. ' But he ' s Mickey , he ' s been Mickey for 60 years and he hasn ' t changed . He ' s just having fun with a new popular_music form in America . The songs are parodies : ' Ice Ice Mickey , ' ' What a Mouse , ' ' You can ' t Botch This , ' ' Ducks in the Hood ' and then , of course , the single ' Whoomp ! ( There It Went ) , ' which features the original artist Tag Team , &quot; whose &quot; Whoomp ! ( There It Is ) &quot; was a monster hit in 1993 . Jaffe stressed that the album ' s goal was to &quot; provide a positive lyrical approach , and we were very conscious of how we chose our lyrics and the context in which they were sung . Perhaps I should say , with this album more_than any other , we were conscious of that. &quot; One double-entendre was apparently overlooked , however , in &quot; Whoomp ! ( There It Went ) , &quot; which is featured as the album ' s single and its live-action / animated music video . The street term &quot; get busy &quot; -- applied to Mickey and friends -- may have an innocuous meaning to most parents , but there ' s a &quot; wink-wink &quot; sexual connotation that ' s just as familiar to many young people . &quot; In the music video , ( the characters ) are in the context of a party and Mickey and Donald and Goofy are dancing during those segments , &quot; Jaffe said . &quot; But in speech there are always double-entendres people don ' t really intend . We can ' t control how people perceive and interpret lyrics that were not intended to have any other meaning than the positive lyrical messages we produce with the albums. &quot; Al Bell , former Motown president and founder of Bellmark Records , Tag Team ' s label , had a slightly different reaction . &quot; I thought I was fairly current , &quot; he said after several moments of chagrined laughter . &quot; I thought I was hip . I should have asked my son . . . . But I love that part and in the video , they ' re dancing . . . . Oh , my goodness. &quot; Bell , who is known for his insistence that his rap artists do clean lyrics , said he was delighted at the idea of one of his favorite childhood icons being involved with the young rap duo Tag Team . &quot; With Tag Team , I saw it as really institutionalizing them . . . . Further , I really appreciated it because I ' ve been concerned about the bad rap that rap_music has gotten , because most of the media focus has been_on the negative aspects of it . I thought it was sort of unfair . That genre has had more of a profound effect than any other on young people . The Mickey album adds a positive position on rap_music and puts balance on the marketplace. &quot; A quarter of a_million albums have been shipped for Tuesday ' s release and Disney ' s full-bore marketing strategy includes &quot; a direct response commercial &quot; that began running_on cable and UHF channels Aug . 15 , a &quot; really aggressive &quot; retail co-op advertising_campaign , print and television appearances and special events . In retail outlets , the album will be placed not only in the children ' s music section but &quot; wherever popular_music is sold , &quot; Bell said . &quot; One of the things we ' ve been fighting at the retail level is the notion it ' s a kids ' record . We ' ve made_it plain to them that this is not a kids ' record , it ' s a hit record , and hit records appeal_to all demographics , kids or not. &quot; Preliminary reaction to the single , already getting airplay in some pop markets , is &quot; positive . They ' ve been inundated with telephone_calls from adults and kids who are in_love with it , &quot; Bell said . Rob Marriott , an editor at the Source , the leading national rap_music magazine , doesn ' t see the album succeeding with a crossover audience , however . &quot; There ' s no way . The rock ( demographic ) is not trying to hear Mickey_Mouse . Disney is about making money and rap_music makes money and so it makes_sense -- when disco was hot they had an album . It ' s kind of corporate logic . It ' s a safe bet we won ' t be reviewing it. &quot; Marriott said he had seen the &quot; Mickey Unrapped &quot; TV promo , but had not heard the album . Bob DeMoss , youth culture specialist for the Christian media watchdog group Focus_on the Family , said , &quot; It ' s perfectly fine for Mickey_Mouse to use rap_music in a positive way . Perhaps some of the artists who are set_on so_much negativity can get a clue . . . . &quot; Jack Thompson , the Miami attorney who led the anti-obscenity crusade against Miami rap_group 2 Live Crew , hasn ' t heard the album either , but he is an enthusiastic Disney fan -- &quot; my 2-year-old son is absolutely out of his skull about ' The Lion King. ' &quot; He does have a reservation about &quot; Mickey Unrapped , &quot; however . &quot; Disney doing a rap album is like Mother Teresa wearing lace garters , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
