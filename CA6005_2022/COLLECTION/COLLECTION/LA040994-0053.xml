   <HEADLINE> FALLOUT LIKELY IN U.S.-JAPAN TRADE TALKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The resignation of Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is likely to make the roiling trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo even more intractable in the near future , U.S. experts cautioned Friday . But over time , it could be a catalyst for significant progress . Although Hosokawa ' s weakened political position was common knowledge , Friday ' s resignation announcement caught Washington by surprise . President Clinton expressed concern that the effort to open commercial markets and reform the government , which began with Hosokawa ' s arrival in office , not end with his departure . When Hosokawa assumed office last July , the Clinton_Administration was optimistic that his coalition , taking_over after 38 years of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party , would lead Japan on a new economic course . At the heart of the Administration ' s policy toward Japan is an effort to get Tokyo to buy more products from foreign countries and reduce a trade surplus that soared to $ 120 billion last year , about half of it at the expense of the United States . The Administration ' s hopes for steady progress were dashed in February , when American and Japanese negotiators , on the eve of Hosokawa ' s visit with Clinton at the White_House , broke_off talks intended to give U.S. businesses a toehold in key Japanese markets . Hosokawa ' s resignation was prompted by his political weakness and by doubts raised over his personal financial dealings dating_back more_than a decade . Even so , the repercussions could be felt in the trade arena . In the view of U.S. experts closely following developments in Japan , this could happen in two steps : * The shake-up that is likely to occur in the upper ranks of the Japanese government , regardless of who succeeds Hosokawa , will force political_leaders to focus_on more pressing domestic matters and will weaken their ability to pressure the powerful bureaucrats in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry into making concessions to U.S. negotiators . &quot; The bureaucrats are more powerful now . No senior , heavyweight politician can force a decision at this point , &quot; said Doug Paal , who was President George_Bush ' s White_House adviser on Asia . * In the longer_run , the turmoil could lead to approval of a new Japanese budget . The difficulty in gaining approval of a budget has kept political_leaders from resuming their earlier focus_on the U.S.-Japan trade dispute . Settling the budget dispute could clear the decks for resolution of the trade fight . On the other hand , Paal said , if the coalition that Hosokawa put_together last summer begins to fracture , the trade talk delays could be extended . Clinton spoke with Hosokawa for about 12 minutes by telephone Friday morning . He said later that he had told the prime_minister that he was &quot; personally very sorry to see him step down. &quot; The President told reporters during a visit to Minneapolis that the change in Japanese leadership would produce no change in the United States ' position on the trade dispute . &quot; I think we should stick_with our policy and be firm about it , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; But plainly , the Japanese are going_to need a little bit of time to reconstitute their government. &quot; Expressing hope for a renewed effort to reform the Japanese political and economic_systems , Clinton said , &quot; I would n ' t write the epitaph for change too quickly. &quot; The course of economic reform in Japan , he said , &quot; will not suffer an irrevocable setback as a result of the government shake-up. &quot; U.S. officials expressed confidence that they could work well with those whose names have surfaced as possible Hosokawa successors , including Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata . When Hata was finance_minister in the Liberal Democratic Party government , &quot; we had a good relationship with him , &quot; a Treasury official said . He characterized Hata as &quot; more on the reformers ' side , &quot; despite his role in the government that the Hosokawa coalition threw_out of office . Still , the official said , the likelihood that Hata could push ahead with the reforms favored by Hosokawa would depend &quot; on the politics of the situation &quot; and the strength he would bring_to the office rather than any policy preferences he might hold . Indeed , said Chalmers Johnson , professor emeritus at the University of California , the dispute between the United States and Japan will not be resolved until Washington shifts from its insistence that Japan make radical changes in its way of doing business . What should be brought_home to the Clinton_Administration , Johnson said , &quot; is that the problem is not going_to be solved by the Japanese . The Japanese will never open their markets in any sense that we understand it. &quot; * ECONOMIC BOOST : Hosokawa ' s resignation could help Japan ' s economy in the short run . D1 Reign Doesn ' t Last a Year Main developments in the Hosokawa administration : * July 18 , 1993 : Parliamentary elections deprive the scandal-ridden Liberal Democratic Party , which had held power for four decades , of its lower-house majority . The defeat paves the way for the resignation of Prime_Minister Kiichi Miyazawa . * Aug . 6 , 1993 : Lawmakers elect Hosokawa prime_minister . * Nov . 18 , 1993 : The lower house passes a package of anti-corruption legislation , including a ban on corporate contributions to politicians and a change in the way the lower house is elected . * Jan . 21 , 1994 : The upper house rejects the anti-corruption bills . Hosokawa had hinted he would resign if the bills failed . * Jan . 29 , 1994 : Both houses pass a compromise that permits limited corporate donations to politicians . * Feb . 3 , 1994 : Hosokawa suddenly announces a plan for a $ 57-billion tax cut combined with a hike in the national sales tax from 3 % to 7 % in 1997 . Key parties denounce the plan ; Hosokawa withdraws it a day later . * March , 1994 : The Liberal Democrats declare they will refuse to discuss the fiscal 1994 budget until Hosokawa allows a former secretary to testify about a $ 952 # 000 loan Hosokawa took from a trucking magnate . Hosokawa rejects the demand . * March 30 , 1994 : An investment consultant says Hosokawa lied to Parliament about a large stock purchase in 1986 . Hosokawa says his father-in-law made the purchase ; the consultant says it was actually Hosokawa . * April 8 , 1994 : Hosokawa says he will resign .

Opposition lawmakers say the loan was actually a political donation . He was also grilled about a profitable stock deal , supposedly made by his father-in-law , that produced a nearly $ 500 # 000 profit . He also disclosed a new potential scandal over personal investments entrusted to a close friend . Hosokawa said laws may have been broken but refused to give details . His Biggest Success : Passing a sweeping set of political reform bills aimed at fighting the corruption that has become endemic to Japanese politics .
