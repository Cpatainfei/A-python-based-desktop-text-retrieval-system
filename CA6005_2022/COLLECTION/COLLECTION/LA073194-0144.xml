   <HEADLINE> GI JOE AND HIS BOO COO SLANG HIT THE DECK IN WARTIME ; WORDS : A NEW DICTIONARY RECORDS THE TERMS AMERICAN GRUNTS , DOUGHBOYS AND DOGFACES HAVE COINED , FROM CHOW IN THE CIVIL WAR TO CAMEL MEAT IN THE PERSIAN_GULF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Along with blood , sweat and tears , war produces words . A new dictionary records the words American doughboys , dogfaces , GIs and grunts have thought_up in every war they fought . The list goes beyond terms that have crept into civilian vocabularies -- jeep , AWOL , gizmo and snafu -- to others whose military origins may_not be as obvious , such_as scuttlebutt , goldbrick , baptize by fire , bite the dust , big_wheel and Dear John , for example . &quot; War Slang : American Fighting Words and Phrases from the Civil War to the Gulf War &quot; by author Paul Dickson , shows that as long as Americans have gone_to_war they have also taken a sardonic view of the environment of battle -- the mud , the food , the enemy , the petty rules and the chances of survival . Food , death , disfigurement and discharge , this dictionary shows , have been soldier preoccupations forever . Chow and grub date_back to the Civil War . But the GIs of World_War_II came_up with the most slighting terms for food . Fried liver was alligator bait ; corned_beef was GI turkey . Prunes were army strawberries -- and were also known as looseners . Sausages were bags of mystery ; beans were commissary bullets ; spinach was marsh grass ; toast was shingles ; sauerkraut was shrubbery . In the Vietnam_War , canned ground_beef patties in gravy were called Gainesburgers . In the Gulf War , any unappetizing entree was camel meat . In the Gulf , MRE stood_for Meal Ready to Eat , the successor to the C-ration of World_War_II . Those forced to consume MREs said the name consisted_of three lies . From MREs , it was simple for soldiers to shortcut the name to simply Rees . Death spawned a vocabulary . Kick_the_bucket was used in the Civil War . In World_War_II , to die was to check_out . In Korea , the term became to buy_the_farm or to go_to the big PX in the sky . In Vietnam , to waste was to kill but to be killed was to be greased , as in , &quot; Anything you do can get you greased , including doing nothing. &quot; The body_bag of Vietnam was officially called the human remains pouch in the Gulf War . In World_War I , a basket case was a soldier who had lost all four limbs and was brought_home as a head and a torso in a basket . The War_Department issued a bulletin on March 28 , 1919 , saying it had no record &quot; of an American soldier so wounded during the whole period of the war. &quot; Korea produced hit_the_sack for going_to_bed and hit_the_deck for getting_up . That war also gave currency to the panic button and to a fatalistic meaning for the term had it , as in &quot; We ' ve had it , we ' re defeated. &quot; In Korea , something petty was chicken . American soldiers have been adept at assimilating French terms . In World_War I , doughboys said hello by saying barn_door , a play_on the_French bonjour . Goodby was bonswar , from bonsoir . And the_French comme-ca was Americanized as cum-sah , meaning what ' s its name , what is it ? Sergeants still say boo coo when they mean many ; it comes from beaucoup . A short-timer is a soldier whose tour_of_duty is nearing an end . Getting short was another way of putting it . In Vietnam the short-timer became a single-digit midget when he or she got below 10 days to go . The last_day of the tour was known as wake-up , as in , &quot; I ' ve got five days and a wake-up. &quot; Then the lucky soldier would fly home on the freedom bird . Of course , the great_war cliche in recent years was generated by Saddam Hussein , who vowed to win &quot; the mother of all battles &quot; in the Gulf . Defense_Secretary Dick Cheney said Saddam instead fathered &quot; the mother of all retreats. &quot; The Boston Globe said he had painted himself into &quot; the mother of all corners &quot; and Gen . H . Norman Schwarzkopf crowed over the war ' s end at a session that became known as the mother of all briefings .</TEXT>
