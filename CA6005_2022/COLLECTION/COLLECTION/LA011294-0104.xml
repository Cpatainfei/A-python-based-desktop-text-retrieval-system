   <HEADLINE> MEXICO STEPS UP BID FOR TRUCE WITH ZAPATISTA REBELS ; REVOLT : OFFICIAL OFFERS TO LISTEN TO THEIR DEMANDS , GOING SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST RECOGNITION FOR THE GROUP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s government , struggling to put_down a deadly Indian rebellion in southern Mexico , stepped_up peace efforts Tuesday with a call_for a truce and an offer to listen to the guerrillas ' demands . Salinas ' newly appointed peace negotiator , former Mexico_City Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis , sounded a conciliatory note in his first public remarks , even suggesting that the Zapatista National Liberation Army , as the guerrillas call themselves , could be recognized as a legitimate force . &quot; They are a reality , &quot; Camacho said in a news_conference . &quot; If we are going_to reach an end to the conflict , we have to talk to them. &quot; Recognition as a legitimate &quot; belligerent &quot; force is one of several demands the Zapatista rebels set_forth in a five-page statement delivered late Monday to a newspaper in Chiapas , the impoverished southern state where the rebellion broke_out New Year ' s Day . The Zapatista rebels also said they were willing to begin talks with the government if a cease-fire is declared and the Mexican army stops its &quot; indiscriminate bombings &quot; and withdraws from Chiapas . If the conditions are not met , they said , they would &quot; continue their advance to the capital. &quot; Camacho , who has a reputation as an able negotiator whose skills were honed in the political fights that go_with running this ungovernable capital , declined to comment on the specific demands presented in the rebel statement until he could verify its authenticity . But he was careful not to rule_out any condition . &quot; We have to find a dignified , political solution for everyone , &quot; he said , adding he was calling_for a truce to allow peace talks to take_place . His tone came_in marked contrast to the hard-line approach adopted , thus far , by other officials , including Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido , the interior minister and former Chiapas governor who lost his job Monday in the wake of the rebellion . The dismissal of Gonzalez , his replacement with a respected veteran of human_rights , and the appointment of Camacho appeared to signal a shift in Salinas ' strategy in handling the Chiapas crisis . Analysts said Salinas ' moves were aimed at containing the political damage his government has suffered as the uprising spawned a growing sense of insecurity at_home and a deteriorating image abroad . By naming a negotiator like Camacho , who enjoys credibility with both the left and the right , the government buys_time and creates the impression of taking the initiative in working for peace . &quot; Going the military route without the alternative of political negotiation could represent a major setback and an eventual dismantling of ( Salinas ' ) economic program because of the element of social-political violence , which in any country with a fragile system scares investors , &quot; said El Financiero columnist Raymundo Riva Palacio . Camacho said he had met with army_officers late Monday and on Tuesday made_a_point of meeting with Roman_Catholic_Church bishops , despite earlier attempts by the government to blame some priests for inciting the rebellion . Camacho said he has not yet contacted the rebels , but he did not indicate when he might do so . He said , however , that he planned to travel_to Chiapas today . Even as the talk in Mexico_City was of peace , the army was reported to be preparing an offensive against about 400 guerrillas dug_in around the northern Chiapas town of El Bosque .</TEXT>
