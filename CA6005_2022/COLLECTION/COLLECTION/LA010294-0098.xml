   <HEADLINE> PEOPLE : VIENNESE AWARD A HIGH NOTE IN COMPOSER ' S LONG CAREER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are some things 89-year-old Herbert Zipper doesn ' t do . He doesn ' t , for instance , use a high-tech computer . And he doesn ' t work_out at a fancy health club . There are many things Herbert Zipper does do , however . He teaches and composes music , and conducts professional musicians in symphonic programs . He also teaches a twice-weekly counterpoint music class at Crossroads School for the Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica . And he visits China regularly to lecture and teach about Western music . &quot; I have no time to grow old , &quot; said the longtime Pacific Palisades resident and musician , who will celebrate his 90th birthday in a_few months . On Wednesday , Zipper was awarded the Golden Decoration of Honor for humanitarian service to the city of Vienna . The award was presented by the Austrian consul-general , Christian Prosl , at a ceremony in Los Angeles . &quot; I spent a great_deal of time composing and writing for Austria , &quot; said Zipper , a native of Vienna . &quot; I wrote for underground theaters , and that was my beginning in the politics of the world. &quot; Zipper is perhaps best-known for music he made in an unlikely place -- a Nazi concentration_camp . In 1938 , the young conductor / composer was arrested and imprisoned at Dachau . As an inmate , Zipper secretly formed an orchestra . He and 14 other musicians risked their lives to perform music for other inmates in an unused latrine . The music Zipper composed in his head while pushing carts full of stone day after day included &quot; Dachau Song. &quot; He said the experience allowed him to appreciate the humanizing power of the arts . * It was not until years later that Zipper discovered that the song had been passed from one prisoner to another and even to other camps . In 1988 , he conducted its world_premiere , sung by a chorus of young_men at a festival in the Austrian city of Graz . &quot; ( The Austrians ) took this as one of the most contemporary and living parts of the rebellion against what happened during the war , &quot; he said . &quot; They appreciate my convictions . There is much more understanding of what present Austria is and past Austria is . . . . I think that I have helped ( present the truth ) in some way. &quot; Zipper ' s life_story is the subject of a book published last year by Crossroads School President Paul Cummins . The book titled &quot; Dachau Song &quot; documents the Austrian-born musician ' s remarkable life . After Dachau , Zipper survived a stay_at Buchenwald before being released by the Nazis . He later moved to the United States , teaching music history and theory at the New School for Social Research in New York City . He also formed orchestras and is credited with bringing classical_music to rural and inner-city schools . In 1945 , he helped reorganize the shattered Manila Symphony_Orchestra . During the past four decades , he has also made numerous trips to Europe , China , Korea , Thailand and Hong Kong , working with students and professional musicians . Besides traveling , he enjoys volunteering as a teacher at Crossroads . Although he could have retired years ago from the classroom and the concert_hall , he says he would not want his life to change . &quot; There are many things I have not done and there are so many things I would still like to do , but time gets short , &quot; he said . &quot; I do my best to remain active. &quot; * Albert Sonnenfeld has been appointed to the Marion Frances Chevalier Professorship in French at USC . The Brentwood resident , a professor of French and comparative_literature , is chairman of the USC department of French and Italian . He also served as director of the National Endowment for the Humanities Teaching Institutes .
