   <HEADLINE> LEGALIZING DRUGS AND REDUCING CRIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Correlating the messages presented in two articles in The Times , Dec . 21 ( View ' s &quot; Fear Is Starting to Run Our Lives &quot; and Commentary ' s &quot; How Legalization Would Cut Crime , &quot; by Steven B . Duke ) , underscored my long-held belief that legalizing some drugs , i.e. , marijuana and cocaine , could bring_about better control of the substances while reducing the crime and violence that have taken_over our society , just as the legalization of alcohol stemmed the criminal dealings created by Prohibition . The issue is so controversial that I doubt that present Administration officials dare give credence to thoughts of legalization , but it would be courageous of them to follow Surgeon_General Dr. Joycelyn Elders ' suggestion of at least beginning to research the issue . Legalization doesn ' t mean no restrictions ; I would think the same guidelines of acceptability that have been established for beer , wine and hard_liquor would apply to any use / abuse of a legalized drug . ROBERTA LAUNE Los Angeles * Duke ' s commentary reaches conclusions through logic that is confounding to me . While it may be true that the criminalization of drug usage has increased the costs of hallucinogens to their users , his conclusion that less expensive drugs would decrease the crime_rate is illusory . If a &quot; druggie &quot; needs a fix , whether it costs $ 20 or $ 200 , it is probable that the money to pay_for it will be coming from the sale of someone else ' s stolen property . Let us be realistic ; it is unlikely that Duke honestly believes that the hard-core drug_users are paragons of virtue who are gainfully employed , contributing members of our society . He states that we &quot; could expect somewhat more use of . . . drugs and . . . drug_abuse &quot; ( if we legalize drugs ) . Somewhat ? Is that like being a little bit pregnant ? How do I teach my children that drug use is unacceptable behavior if society condones it ? It is already difficult enough discouraging cigarettes and booze -- thank goodness that they taste awful the first time you try them . However , drugs can have a euphoric effect the first time you use them . If society legalizes the use of hallucinogens , then it will have to be prepared to pay the consequences : decreased productivity of our work_force , deterioration of the public ' s health , babies born dependent_on drugs , and more deaths due_to driving under the influence . MICHAEL A . WATERMAN Encino * Duke states &quot; that drug prohibition is responsible_for much of the crime in this country is beyond dispute , &quot; and he makes reference_to &quot; crimes that are prohibition-caused. &quot; Really ? Is he saying that if I commit a drug-related crime , it ' s not my fault ? That I am not responsible_for my own actions ? Nonsense ! Put the blame for criminal behavior where it belongs -- on the criminal . JOHN CONSUEGRA North Hollywood * Of all_the syndicated cartoons that you could have selected to feature on the Commentary Page for Dec . 26 , why the Mike Peters inanity ? Comparing one ' s use of a chemical substance with violent crimes against others is perverse and dishonest . Worse , I fear that this blatant lack of parallelism may_not be noticed by the large_number of people who have never seriously thought_about the problem . Because of the simplistic power of cartoons , I can imagine many of your readers mindlessly nodding in_agreement with this nonsense as if it settles the debate . If you selected this cartoon to &quot; balance &quot; the well-reasoned essay by Steven Duke , the illogicality of Mike Peters utterly fails to present whatever arguments there may be for the &quot; other side &quot; of the drug legalization issue .
