   <HEADLINE> HOTEL GROUP BACKS WORKPLACE SMOKING BAN ; LEGISLATION : SWITCH BY ASSOCIATION BOOSTS CHANCES OF BILL THAT WOULD IMPOSE THE MOST SWEEPING RESTRICTIONS OF ANY STATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A hotel owners association that had been a leading foe of a bill to ban workplace smoking switched positions Tuesday , boosting chances that the measure will clear the Legislature this year . In making the announcement , Assemblyman Terry B . Friedman ( D-Brentwood ) said the endorsement by the California Hotel &amp; Motel Assn . defuses a main argument against his proposed smoking ban -- that it would damage the tourism industry . &quot; This leaves the tobacco_industry virtually alone , unable to seek cover by pointing to some_other legitimate organization ' s arguments , &quot; Friedman said . Applying to most indoor workplaces , the bill would create the most sweeping smoking restrictions of any state and would allow cities to impose even tougher smoking ordinances . Friedman said he won the hotel owners ' endorsement after agreeing to amend his bill to allow smoking in 65 % of hotel_rooms , in hotel lobbies , in banquet rooms during private gatherings and , temporarily at least , in bars . The bill would require the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration to develop standards regulating smoking in bars by 1997 . If Cal-OSHA fails to develop the standards , Friedman said , the ban would extend_to bars . Friedman said he intends to push for passage of the bill this month in the Senate Judiciary Committee , where the legislation stalled last year . If it wins Senate approval , the bill would have to return to the Assembly for approval of the Senate amendments . It is not known whether Gov . Pete Wilson would sign the bill . James Abrams , director of the hotel association , called the organization ' s new position &quot; good public policy. &quot; The hotel association was among the most active lobbyists against the bill last year . The possibility remains that individual hotel owners might continue to oppose the smoking ban . &quot; It ' s always a risk when you get involved in controversial issues that some of your members will not agree with you , &quot; Abrams said . &quot; We hope none of them would feel ( it ) would be grounds to leave the organization. &quot; Hotel association lobbyists had contended that a smoking ban would result in California hotels losing tourist trade to states with few smoking restrictions . Several lawmakers cited that argument in their opposition to Friedman ' s measure . Meanwhile , Lee Stitzenberger of the Dolphin Group , a political consulting_firm in Westwood , said he will continue efforts to qualify an initiative for the November ballot to repeal all local smoking bans . &quot; I have seen nothing to change my mind &quot; about moving forward with the initiative , Stitzenberger said . The initiative , backed by tobacco giant Philip Morris U.S.A. , would remove most smoking restrictions and generally leave it to individual business owners to decide smoking policy .</TEXT>
