   <HEADLINE> MARKET PAUSES BEFORE HOLIDAY ; DOW GAINS 3.68</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Blue_chip stocks edged higher Friday on the eve of the long holiday weekend , in the thinnest trading since December . For the week , the Dow industrials were off 9.21 points at 3 # 757.14. They gained 3.68 in the session . The stock and bond markets shrugged_off Federal_Reserve_Board Chairman Alan Greenspan ' s Senate testimony , in which he said the economy is basically strong but that there are uncertainties , such_as the weak dollar . Treasury_bond yields rose after the Commerce_Department revised upward its estimate of the nation ' s gross_domestic_product , from 2.6 % to 3 % in the first three months of the year . That is much slower than the 7 % rise in the fourth quarter of 1993 , but economists had expected the revised number to be lower , not higher , and it signaled that the economy is stronger than thought and inflation a greater risk . But an inflation index tied to the GDP proved tame . It rose at a moderate annual rate of 2.6 % in the first_quarter , unchanged from an earlier estimate . Steven R . Ricchiuto , chief economist for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government_Securities Inc. , said Greenspan ' s testimony gave the market the impression that the Fed won ' t move again in the near future to raise interest_rates , suggesting that the central_bank is sanguine about the long-term inflation outlook . The Treasury_bond market closed early for the holiday . The benchmark 30-year bond ' s yield closed at 7.38 % , up from 7.36 % . Some analysts await the government ' s release Tuesday of data on personal_income and spending in April , which will provide a better picture of second-quarter growth and inflation . In London , the main British share index plunged to a nine-month low on fears of higher interest_rates because of faster economic_growth in Europe and the United States . The FTSE-100 fell 53.3 points to 2966.4 , down 4.9 % on the week . British Telecom , British Petroleum and British Gas together wiped about 10 points off the index . Although the German market rose slightly Friday , European markets overall fell_through the week . The dollar ended mostly lower in foreign_exchange trading , while gold prices were higher . Prices of many commodities staged modest rebounds after a week that saw a closely watched index climb to 3 1 / 2-year highs before plunging sharply . Grains , coffee , cocoa , metals , oil and cattle prices all recovered some of their lost ground . Coffee prices , which tumbled 15 % from Monday ' s close of $ 1.39 a pound to $ 1.17 on Thursday , rebounded 3.5 cents to close at $ 1.213. Among market highlights : The blue_chips received a boost from McDonald ' s , which rose 1 1 / 8 to 61 after the restaurant_chain ' s board approved a 2-for-1 stock_split and raised its quarterly dividend . Philip Morris fell another 5 / 8 to 50 . The stock fell 3 1 / 8 on Thursday after the company said it had no immediate plans to split its food and tobacco businesses . Steel stocks rose . A Wall_Street Journal article said the outlook for steel profits is good and the stocks cheap , having lost more_than 20 % since Jan . 31 . Bethlehem Steel rose 1 1 / 8 to 19 5 / 8 . McKesson gained 3 3 / 8 to 84 3 / 4 on speculation that it may be acquired soon by either Glaxo Holdings or by Johnson &amp; Johnson in a deal with Glaxo . Market Roundup , D2</TEXT>
