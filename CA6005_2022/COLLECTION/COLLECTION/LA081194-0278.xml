   <HEADLINE> INVENTING THE FUTURE ; UCLA SCIENTIST WHO HELPED CREATE INTERNET ISN ' T DONE YET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He was there at the start -- the day the very first message landed on the information highway . It was Nov . 21 , 1969 , and Leonard Kleinrock made one last check of the system that he had come_up with to let computers talk to each other over telephone_lines instead of waiting for magnetic_tapes or punch_cards to be exchanged by mail . The equipment was stuffed inside a refrigerator-size cabinet in the middle of Room 3420 at UCLA ' s Boelter Hall . Computer_science professor Kleinrock and several graduate_students watched anxiously as a brief &quot; are you receiving this ? &quot; query was typed into an IBM Selectric typewriter_keyboard wired to the machine . Moments later came the reply from a lone computer about 400 miles away in San Francisco : Yes . In a blink_of_an_eye , the Internet was born . These days , there are millions of users instead of only two . And the man who helped invent the Internet 25 years ago is trying to help reinvent it . Kleinrock , 60 , is in Washington today to brief Department_of_Education officials on ways that the Internet could be a model for an information superhighway linking computer , cable_television , telephone and broadcast technologies . The ideas have come from a 16-member National Information Infrastructure panel of scientists , communications industry officials and academicians headed by Kleinrock for the National Science Foundation . The committee has sketched out the basic framework for a future computer_network accessible to all , yet sophisticated enough to adapt to future technologies . &quot; If we do_it right , we can fold in everything -- entertainment , science , business , you name it , into one network , &quot; Kleinrock said . &quot; We envision something serving not only the nutty scientist or the couch potato , but the business world as a whole. &quot; The idea of hooking computers together so researchers could share ideas sounded wacky to many scientists the Saturday before Labor_Day in 1969 . That is when what has become known as Internet Node No . 1 was wheeled into Kleinrock ' s UCLA lab . The clunky , $ 100 # 000 machine , called an interface message processor , was designed to translate commands between computer mainframes built by Honeywell , Burroughs , IBM and Digital . It needed special &quot; packet-switching &quot; technology promoted by Kleinrock to connect computers that were miles apart . The machine had been commissioned by the federal_government ' s Advanced Research Projects Agency , an organization set_up in 1958 in response to the Soviets ' launch of the Sputnik satellite the year before . The Department of Defense-sponsored agency supported computer researchers scattered nationwide . By the late 1960s , the agency began looking_for a way to save money by letting the growing group of scientists share computers . The resulting project , dubbed Arpanet , would eventually evolve into the Internet . Kleinrock was recruited to help after writing an MIT graduate_school thesis on an obscure topic called &quot; data networks. &quot; It had been published as a book a year before Kleinrock joined the UCLA faculty in 1963 . &quot; Len was the best one in the country to do_it , &quot; said Larry Roberts , now a Foster City , Calif. , research executive who was in_charge of Arpanet development in the mid-1960s . Scientists say packet-switching is a procedure in which data is partitioned into small bundles . Each carries its own delivery address and travels through the data network independently to its destination . &quot; Think_of it as freeways being the lines and cars being the packets , &quot; said Vinton Cerf , a communication company executive who heads the nonprofit Internet Society -- and who was one of those present in Room 3420 the day the Internet was born . Cerf , now of Reston , Va. , was a graduate_student at the time who was working_on the software that pumped data in and out of Node No . 1 . &quot; Before the Arpanet project started , it was Len whose theoretical work showed that the concept of store-and-forward switching actually made_sense , &quot; Cerf said . Kleinrock -- who received the 1982 Ericsson Prize ( considered by some the Nobel Prize of telecommunications ) from the King of Sweden -- credits Superman for starting his career . He said he was 6 when he spied plans for a homemade crystal radio_set in a Superman comic_book centerfold . He scrounged up the parts and assembled them . And when it worked , he found himself hooked on electronics . Not everyone was hooked at first on the concept of the Internet . For the first few months , the Advanced Research Projects Agency ' s computer_network consisted solely of outlets at UCLA , the Stanford Research Institute , UC Santa Barbara and the University of Utah . &quot; I ' d figured that by 1974 it would be pretty widespread , &quot; but it wasn ' t , said Robert Taylor , a former agency computer research administrator who is now with a Palo Alto computer firm . &quot; Nobody wanted to connect to the network . They were afraid their machines would be overloaded by network users , &quot; Kleinrock said . Node No . 1 was replaced with faster equipment in the late 1970s . UCLA offered to donate it to the Smithsonian in 1989 . &quot; But they said no . Now the Smithsonian wants it and we ' ve said no , &quot; he said . Kleinrock , a Brentwood resident , said he spends about 30 hours a week using the Internet . It is still a research tool for people such_as the Bombay professor appealing this week for data on &quot; Bacillus subtilis genomic &quot; or the Florida horticulturists growing &quot; beer-drinking orchids. &quot; But it also posts tasteless jokes , political dissertations and games . Work_on the information superhighway is just beginning , Kleinrock said . &quot; We don ' t know where this is heading , &quot; he said . &quot; We didn ' t know 25 years ago . And we don ' t know now . We ' re feeling our way in a new world. &quot;</TEXT>
