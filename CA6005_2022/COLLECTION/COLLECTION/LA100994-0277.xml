   <HEADLINE> ROILING MARKETS ARE THE FINAL ARBITER OF VALUE FOR WORLD ' S CURRENCIES ; FINANCE : $ 880 BILLION IS TRADED DAILY IN THE FRENZIED REALM OF FOREIGN_EXCHANGE -- AND ALWAYS AT WARP SPEED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was over in seconds . Faster than you could say &quot; $ 10 million , &quot; the young foreign-exchange dealer had bought that much cash from a large London-based bank in return for 15 # 595 , 000 German marks . Like a school kid calling friends off a fly_ball headed his way , he had pounced on the bank ' s offer with a single word : &quot; Mine ! &quot; It was not his for long . Ten seconds of telephone time later , he had a buyer willing to pay 15 # 600 , 000 marks for his $ 10 million , and it was gone . He had 5 # 000 more marks ( about $ 3 # 200 ) in his pocket than he had when he started . Not a bad profit for 10 seconds ' work . By foreign-exchange standards , the deal was modest -- little more_than pocket change in a global market that at last count traded a staggering $ 880 billion each day . The speed was also routine . &quot; It ' s a fast-moving market , &quot; noted David Sumners , who heads a foreign-exchange trading team of 36 professionals at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co . International Ltd . &quot; Positions can change in seconds. &quot; The American-owned securities firm and investment bank is one of several global players that buy and sell the world ' s leading currencies each day . They do so either for their customers ( mainly major international companies and other banks ) , for their own needs or simply for profit . Although currency movements generally reflect the market ' s judgment of government policy , they can also be spooked by rumor or intangibles such_as the health or popularity of a national_leader . For better or for worse , it is the battalions of dealers deployed mainly in London , Tokyo and New York , but also in several other cities from Hong Kong to Zurich , who decide how much an American tourist will get for dollars in Paris , whether the Italian_lira will recover its value and whether the Japanese yen will continue to increase in worth against all comers . Today , the markets , not governments , decide . Their sheer size makes them the final arbiter of a currency ' s value . It wasn ' t always so . It was only in the 1970s , when revolutions in computer , communication and information technologies coincided with the end of foreign-exchange controls in many countries , that the market took_off in its present form . Those forces propelled the business of changing money from a sleepy bank window service for travelers and world traders to an intense , high-tech , 24-hour operation in which dealers often decide in seconds whether to buy , sell or hold massive amounts of foreign currencies . The typical trader ' s desk at Morgan Stanley looks more like an aircraft cockpit than a banker ' s office . Tom Viveash , the bank ' s chief spot trader in London , is surrounded by five TV monitors , four phone banks ( each with 10 lines ) , two computer_keyboards and a microphone . Bolted to the ceiling a_few feet away , a large video screen displays current prices of Spanish , German , French and Italian government_bonds plus the 11 latest major news flashes from around the world . Primed with this up-to-the-minute market information and an endless supply of more in-depth market analyses , Viveash and his team make the choices that can make or lose barrels of money in practically no time at all . Dealers here freely admit that their lives border_on the obsessive . Long , relentless weeks that begin late Sunday ( when the Far Eastern markets open Monday morning local_time ) and end late Friday ( when New York finally closes ) often make_for short careers . At 45 , Viveash defies the stereotype of the brash young dealer who lives_on adrenaline , deals on instinct and burns_out at 35 . As the market becomes increasingly sophisticated , daring alone is not enough . The best mix for a dealer , he says , is a bright , analytical mind , enough knowledge and confidence to know when to strike and the discipline to know when to let_go_of a tactic that ' s not working . &quot; The trick is anticipation , &quot; Viveash said . &quot; When the market turns , it turns quickly. &quot;</TEXT>
