   <HEADLINE> JUDGE EXCUSES SIMPSON JUROR NO . 32 FROM CASE ; COURTS : THE PASADENA WOMAN SOUGHT DISMISSAL BECAUSE OF ' UNDUE ATTENTION ' OVER NUMBER THAT MATCHED THE ONE THE DEFENDANT WORE AS A FOOTBALL_PLAYER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The potential juror who drew O.J. Simpson ' s old football jersey number last month -- to the delight of the former athlete -- decided she did not want the publicity and asked Monday to be excused from serving during Simpson ' s double-murder case . Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito gave the 31-year-old Pasadena resident time to reconsider , but finally honored her request . The woman , an engineering researcher whose name never has been made public , told Ito she wanted out because &quot; there is undue attention being drawn to me because of my juror number. &quot; She later complained to reporters about a &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; skit in which an Ito character winks_at Juror No . 32 . Family members and co-workers had badgered her about the identity of that juror , she said . The woman also objected to the release of extensive questionnaires that prospective jurors filled_out on their attitudes about such things as race , crime and the specifics of the Simpson case . &quot; The media ruined it , &quot; she said . &quot; There are some things in my life that are private. &quot; Simpson wore jersey number 32 throughout his celebrated football career with USC , the Buffalo Bills and the San Francisco 49ers . The first potential juror to undergo initial screening last month was Juror No . 32 , a coincidence that led Ito to remark about an &quot; omen &quot; and Simpson to nod vigorously in_agreement . On Monday , Ito said he would &quot; retire &quot; 32 as a number to identify potential jurors , jurors or alternates in the case . Simpson has pleaded not_guilty to the June 12 slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman . Voir dire , or oral questioning of potential jurors , began last week and is expected to last at least a month . In other developments Monday : * Ito postponed a decision on whether to sanction the prosecution for taking too long to send samples to scientific laboratories for DNA testing , depriving the defense of information in preparing its case . * Cathy Randa , Simpson ' s longtime assistant , spent three hours before a grand_jury , which was said earlier this month to have stopped taking testimony as part of an investigation of Simpson ' s friend Al Cowlings . Randa ' s lawyer accused prosecutors of harassing her . * A shelter for battered women and children issued a &quot; challenge &quot; to the public to boycott Halloween costumes depicting Simpson or his ex-wife . Simpson masks and blood-splattered football jerseys have become hot sellers at costume stores as well as blond wigs for women who want to dress_up as Nicole Simpson . The statement released Monday includes a quote attributed to the dead woman ' s sister that describes such costumes as having &quot; no redeeming value for our society . &quot; Murder and domestic violence is no laughing matter , &quot; Denise Brown is quoted as saying . Simpson in 1989 pleaded no contest to misdemeanor spousal abuse . Most of the members of the jury pool have indicated that they are aware of a taped call his ex-wife made to 911 in 1993 in which she said he had kicked_in her door . In court Monday , questions about domestic violence emerged again in the inquiries made of prospective jurors and led to the loss of one of them . A 41-year-old Norwalk woman was excused after she said being in the courtroom &quot; brought_back past memories &quot; of the 12 years of domestic violence she suffered . &quot; I can tell from the tone of your voice you are very sincere , &quot; Ito told her before excusing her . Voir dire is expected to continue today .</TEXT>
