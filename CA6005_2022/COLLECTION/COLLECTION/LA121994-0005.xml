   <TEXT> MOVIES Ready to Revoke ? : Miramax Films , which faces a hearing this week over advertising related to its forthcoming film , &quot; Ready to Wear , &quot; ran full-page ads in both Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter on Friday with the headline , &quot; This is not an ad to see the movie Ready to Wear . &quot; The ad went_on to describe itself as &quot; a statement of protest &quot; over threats by the Motion_Picture Assn . of America to revoke the R rating of director Robert Altman ' s fashion-industry sendup , &quot; Ready to Wear , &quot; which opens Christmas_Day . The dispute is over a semi-nude photo in film-related advertising of supermodel Helena Christensen . The photo appeared prominently in the Friday ads , as it did_in a recent ad by Columbia Records to promote the film ' s soundtrack . The Columbia ad included a line saying , &quot; See the Movie , &quot; which the MPAA said was equivalent_to a movie ad and violated the association ' s standards . Miramax says the photo is a fair reflection of its film and its rating , and has retained lawyer Alan Dershowitz to fight what it calls censorship . The MPAA has scheduled a revocation hearing for Thursday in Washington . Miramax says the loss of its rating so close to the film ' s opening could greatly impact the number of theaters willing to show it .
