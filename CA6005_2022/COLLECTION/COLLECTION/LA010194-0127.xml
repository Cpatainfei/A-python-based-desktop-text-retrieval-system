   <HEADLINE> CLEANUP OF SPILL COULD COST FIRM $ 10 MILLION ; ENVIRONMENT : BERRY PETROLEUM MUST PAY FOR CLEANING CREWS , MATERIALS AND THE WORK OF VARIOUS PUBLIC AGENCIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The massive cleanup of the 84 # 000-gallon oil spill at McGrath State Beach could cost Berry Petroleum Co . $ 10 million and last for months , a state official said Friday . &quot; It will be in the high seven digits or the low eight digits , &quot; the official , who requested anonymity , said about the cleanup costs . &quot; This spill will be to Berry Petroleum what the Exxon Valdez spill was to Exxon. &quot; In addition to paying_for cleaning crews to work_on the spill , Berry will be responsible_for the cost of materials used in the effort and for the work of public agencies responding to the spill . For the Coast Guard alone , the cost after just five days had reached $ 53 # 000 . &quot; As time goes_on , it will be much , much larger , &quot; said Chief Warrant_Officer John Hollis , a Coast Guard spokesman . &quot; Each day the costs skyrocket. &quot; Officials of Berry , the parent company of pipeline operator Bush Oil , said they would not confirm the cleanup costs but have said they are covered by insurance for such incidents . Officials from Berry ' s insurance carrier were not available for comment Friday . Talk_of the cleanup ' s cost came as a Berry spokesman acknowledged the company does have information about when the spill occurred and why it was not detected , but will not discuss its findings because of the ongoing investigation . &quot; That information will all come_out , &quot; said Ray Hatch , Berry ' s spokesman . &quot; But we feel there will be nothing served by giving any of that information out at this time. &quot; Officials investigating the spill have said that oil may have been seeping from a ruptured transfer pipe for as_many as three days before the leak was discovered . Until Friday , Berry officials said repeatedly they did not know why it took so_long to detect the leak . Plans to excavate the pipe so that investigators could learn more about what caused the break were postponed Friday . Officials said that two to three other pipelines run_through the same plot of land and must be accurately located before digging could begin . Once the pipe is removed from the ground , investigators said they would be able to move forward with their investigation at a more rapid pace . &quot; that ' s really the key piece of information that we ' re missing right now , &quot; said Petty_Officer Tom Haug , one of two U.S. Coast Guard investigators . &quot; I ' m not comfortable looking_at the records alone. &quot; As investigators from the Coast Guard and the state_Department of Fish and Game waited for clearance to begin excavation of the pipe , more_than 200 workers continued to remove oil from the beach and wetlands near McGrath Lake . Late Friday , officials at the scene said 1 # 747 barrels of oil had been recovered from the 2 # 000-barrel spill . The number of skimmers on the lake was reduced from three to one , and the emphasis turned_to the marshland around the lake . &quot; We ' re in the process of transition , &quot; said Cmdr . Jim Rutkovsky , the incident commander for the Coast Guard . &quot; We ' re going from an immersion stage to_the_point where we ' re being more deliberate. &quot; The oil that crews are collecting now is more difficult to pick_up because some of it is in thin layers and some of it is stuck_to reeds and other plants around the lake , he said . &quot; What we ' re doing now is going_in there on foot and cutting_away the brush by hand , &quot; said Capt . Joe Pecsi , the Fish and Game ' s operation coordinator . &quot; Any of the vegetation that ' s been soaked by oil needs to be removed , &quot; Pecsi said . &quot; Fortunately , because the crude was pretty solid at the lake ' s surface and the vegetation was very dense , the oil only penetrated about a yard into the marsh. &quot; Workers also continued the meticulous process of raking small beads of oil from the beach as they wash in with the tide . &quot; that ' s a process that ' s going_to take several days , &quot; Pecsi said . &quot; It ' s very tedious work. &quot; The beach from Channel Islands Harbor to the Santa Clara River mouth will remain closed , officials said . State officials continued to find birds either killed or injured by the oil spill . The count of birds killed in the oil-stained wetlands rose from 122 to 133 Friday . &quot; We ' re continuing our wildlife rehabilitation efforts , and we ' re still monitoring the impacts this spill has had_on the wildlife , &quot; Pecsi said . &quot; And we ' re making some headway with the cleanup , but the hard part has just begun. &quot;</TEXT>
