   <HEADLINE> HOME TECH / VIDEO : A GREAT MONTH FOR OVERLOOKED TITLES ; RETAILERS ARE SHOWCASING MOVIES ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICANS DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shrewd video retailers have been using Black History Month -- which is February -- as a tool for pushing black-oriented movies , new and old . * Retailers with significant black clienteles are showcasing classics about black family life , such_as Paramount ' s &quot; Sounder , &quot; starring Paul Winfield , and RCA / Columbia ' s &quot; A Raisin in the Sun , &quot; featuring Sidney Poitier . These movies , usually buried in the classics section , often get star treatment in the front of the store throughout February . It ' s a chance for movies that are generally overlooked to find an audience . Black History Month should prove to be a boon to &quot; Nothing but a Man , &quot; one of the best -- and most obscure -- movies ever made about the black community . New Video Group decided this is the best time for this 1964 movie , starring Ivan Dixon and Abbey Lincoln , to make its home video bow . It came_out Wednesday , geared to the rental market . The movie , a black-and-white independent effort made_for only $ 230 # 000 , examines the black community in the early days of the civil_rights movement . The hero , played by Dixon , is a blue-collar type struggling to survive and maintain dignity in a hostile world . It deals insightfully and honestly with black rage , a subject that most filmmakers were still skirting in the early ' 60s . Though it played in some theaters and was critically acclaimed , the film mainly as been seen in churches and schools , said Michael Roemer , who directed , co-wrote and co-produced &quot; Nothing but a Man. &quot; &quot; It ' s never been regarded_as a mass-market movie , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s been_on public television but that ' s all . Commercial television has considered showing it a_few times but then ultimately decided against it. &quot; Why has it taken so_long to come_to home video ? &quot; I have no idea , &quot; Roemer replied . &quot; They probably didn ' t know how to market it . But New Video showed interest and saw a way to market it . Thank God for Black History Month. &quot; More Black History Month : &quot; Menace II Society &quot; came_out two weeks ago , and &quot; Poetic Justice , &quot; with Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur , will be released Wednesday . &quot; The Meteor Man , &quot; Robert Townsend ' s inner-city fairy tale , will be in_stores Feb . 9 . &quot; Laurel Avenue , &quot; the outstanding HBO miniseries about ghetto family life , was released Wednesday . On Feb . 16 , Warner is introducing Spike Lee ' s &quot; Malcolm X &quot; to the sales market , pricing it at $ 25 . Orion is promoting &quot; King , &quot; the 1978 miniseries about the life of Martin_Luther_King Jr. , starring Paul Winfield . A good one-hour documentary about King , Xenon ' s &quot; A Historical Perspective , &quot; featuring rare footage and photos , became available Wednesday . &quot; Only the Ball Was White &quot; ( MPI , $ 20 ) is an informative half-hour documentary , narrated by Winfield , about the Negro baseball_leagues that existed before black players were allowed into the major_leagues in the late 1940s . Videobits &quot; A Woman ' s View of Pro Football &quot; ( PolyGram , $ 20 ) is 45 minutes of amusing commentaries about the sport from women such_as Ivana Trump and Joan Rivers . It should be a popular attraction at Super Bowl parties this weekend . Looks_like another banner year for Barney , the cuddly dinosaur . &quot; Let ' s Pretend With Barney &quot; is just out , with another due in March , &quot; Barney ' s Alphabet Zoo. &quot; In addition , there will be video versions of his March shows at New York ' s Radio City Music_Hall and his April TV special . What ' s New on Video &quot; Last Action Hero &quot; ( Columbia TriStar , no set price ) . One of the most expensive ( cost estimates run as high as $ 120 million ) flops in film history . In this convoluted , film-within-a-film fantasy , you ' re often reminded that the action you ' re watching isn ' t real -- a bummer for real action-movie fans . Arnold Schwarzenegger , as action-film hero Jack Slater , is clearly having fun poking_fun at his image . Too_bad the fun isn ' t contagious . &quot; Coneheads &quot; ( Paramount , no set price ) . Feeling nostalgic for the Coneheads bits from the early &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; shows ? Then whatever you do , don ' t rent this movie -- it ' ll destroy all those fond memories . Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin , who starred in the old skits , are reunited as the coneheaded , robot-like aliens who make bumbling attempts at being average Americans . Mostly juvenile humor that may have some appeal_to the subteen and early teen set . &quot; Hard Target &quot; ( MCA / Universal , no set price ) . This classy action movie -- kick-boxing star Jean-Claude Van Damme ' s best ever -- showcases the skills of Hong Kong director John Woo , who ' s making his Hollywood debut . The hero is pitted against a decadent sportsman ( Lance Henriksen ) who arranges human-prey safaris for millionaires . It ' s the umpteenth rip-off of 1932 ' s &quot; The Most Dangerous Game &quot; -- but so what ? The plot merely serves to kill time between the great action sequences . &quot; Rookie of the Year &quot; ( FoxVideo , no set price ) . In his directorial debut , Daniel Stern , who overdoes it playing the pitching coach , doesn ' t miss a cliche in this comedy about a 12-year-old boy ( Thomas Ian Nicholas ) who mysteriously develops a blazing fastball and becomes a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs . Despite a procession of stereotypes , it ' s entertaining hokum that manages to keep you interested -- right down to the inevitable ninth-inning finale . Gary Busey co-stars . Upcoming Just announced : Touchstone ' s &quot; What ' s Love Got to Do With It , &quot; the Tina Turner biography starring Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne , due March 23 . HBO / Savoy ' s &quot; A Bronx Tale , &quot; directed by and featuring Robert De Niro , comes_out April 6 . Also : &quot; Kalifornia &quot; and &quot; Indochine &quot; ( Wednesday ) ; &quot; In the Line_of_Fire , &quot; &quot; Amongst Friends , &quot; &quot; The Real McCoy &quot; and &quot; That Night &quot; ( Feb . 9 ) ; &quot; The Secret Garden &quot; ( Feb . 15 ) ; &quot; Man Without a Face , &quot; &quot; The Program &quot; and &quot; Calendar Girl &quot; ( Feb . 16 ) ; &quot; For Love or Money , &quot; &quot; Son of the Pink Panther , &quot; &quot; Dazed and Confused , &quot; &quot; Son-in-Law , &quot; &quot; Needful Things , &quot; &quot; Strictly Ballroom &quot; and &quot; Boxing Helena &quot; ( Feb . 23 ) ; &quot; Much Ado About Nothing , &quot; &quot; The Good Son &quot; and &quot; Striking Distance &quot; ( March 2 ) ; &quot; The Fox and the Hound &quot; ( March 4 ) ; &quot; Manhattan Murder Mystery , &quot; &quot; Judgment Night &quot; and &quot; So I Married An Axe Murderer &quot; ( March 9 ) ; &quot; Gettysburg &quot; and &quot; Bopha ! &quot; ( March 16 ) ; &quot; The Fugitive &quot; ( March 22 ) ; &quot; Fatal Instinct &quot; ( March 23 ) ; &quot; The Joy Luck Club &quot; ( March 30 ) ; &quot; Malice &quot; ( April 13 ) .</TEXT>
