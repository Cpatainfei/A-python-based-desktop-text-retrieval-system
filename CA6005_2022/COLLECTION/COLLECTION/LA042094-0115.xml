   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; A BETTER PATH TO POWER ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Most electric_power is produced by burning fuel to boil water into steam , which turns the fan-like blades of a turbine , generating electricity . The steam is then condensed back into water for reuse in what is known as a thermodynamic cycle . Traditional power generation relies_on the Rankine cycle , which uses ordinary water . But the proposed new Kalina cycle appears to be much more efficient , thanks to a mixture that starts_out in the boiler as 70 % ammonia , 30 % water . Such mixes are more efficient in boilers but have been difficult to condense . The Kalina technology uses a new process that takes_advantage of efficiencies obtained by varying the ratio of ammonia to water at successive stages during condensation . The invention of Alexander Kalina , an engineer who emigrated to the United States from Russia in 1978 , the Kalina technology is billed by proponents as the first new electricity-generating thermodynamic cycle in a century . It could dramatically increase the generating efficiency -- by 20 % or more -- of the immense utility steam-turbines that produce 70 % of the nation ' s electric_power , using virtually any fuel . The cycle ' s principles have already been successfully demonstrated by researchers at the Energy Technology Engineering Center , a Department_of_Energy facility near Simi Valley that is operated by the Rocketdyne unit of Rockwell International . The center has the sole operating model in the world . How the Kalina Cycle Works : A 70 % ammonia solution is first boiled ( 1 ) to produce steam to turn the generator ( 2 ) . Then the used steam is condensed back to liquid in a complex system that replaces the single condenser in conventional power_plants . Energy is saved as parts of the stream are split off and remixed at different temperatures , pressures and ammonia mixtures . Finally , the separate streams are reformed as a 70 % solution ( 3 ) to return to the boiler . Source : U.S. Department_of_Energy ; Exergy Inc .</TEXT>
