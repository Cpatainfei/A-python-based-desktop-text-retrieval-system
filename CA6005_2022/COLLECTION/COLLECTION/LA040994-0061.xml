   <HEADLINE> JAPAN SEEMS READY TO LET_GO OF STATUS QUO , LEADERS SAY ; POLITICS : HOSOKAWA ' S SUCCESSOR WILL STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH ECONOMIC FRUSTRATIONS , BUSINESS_EXECUTIVES SUGGEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In all_the biting American criticisms of Japan ' s economic practices , nothing matches the bitter language of Ichiro Ozawa in his book &quot; Blueprint for a New Japan. &quot; &quot; Workers are owned like pets by their companies , and housing is offered as the equivalent of dog_food , &quot; Ozawa declared . &quot; Workers receive notices of transfers to distant places in a single memo ; families are divided . . . . Promises of shorter working hours never materialize . . . people even die from overwork . . . . An economic and social framework that emphasizes cooperative , long-term relationships seems nothing more_than a closed society , one that bars foreign companies or any other outsiders from entering. &quot; These words come not from a cynic on the fringes of Japanese society but rather from the heavyweight leader who helped bring Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ' s reformist coalition to power last August after 38 years of conservative rule . On Friday , Hosokawa , embroiled in a personal scandal , suddenly announced that he will resign . But the frustration that precipitated Ozawa ' s outburst in the book he wrote a year ago remains . Not only trading partners abroad -- especially the United States -- but also business_leaders and the general public here are growing increasingly aggravated with the Japanese status_quo . And not since the post-World War II U.S. occupation has Japan appeared so ripe for reform -- which Hosokawa ' s successor will have to tackle . &quot; The reform of Japan is a general idea of the Japanese people , not just Hosokawa , &quot; said Kenji Mizutani , vice_president of Tokai Research &amp; Consulting Inc. Kunio Miyamoto , chief economist at Sumitomo Life Research Institute , added , &quot; Nobody can go_against this movement for reform if they want to survive as a political leader. &quot; The vision offered by Ozawa is of a Japan that would put more value on individuals and innovation ; the economy would be freed_of the shackles of bureaucratic controls and would grow not through exports but by providing the Japanese with bigger homes and higher living standards . This is also a Japan that the Clinton_Administration would like to see . Ozawa drew his vision , however , not merely in response to the huge Japanese trade surpluses that the United States wants reduced . Instead , he was reacting to his nation ' s own situation : Battered by the country ' s worst postwar recession , Japan ' s entire system is groaning under multiple strains . Corporations face plummeting profits or even losses . Stocks have recovered only half of their peak value in 1989 . Banks are loaded_down with bad loans that are still climbing . Real_estate prices , already slashed in half , are still falling . The aging of the population is undermining this nation ' s lifetime employment and seniority pay systems as companies become overloaded with highly paid older workers . Meantime , the yen is so strong that an export-based recovery is virtually impossible . Last year , despite a record global trade surplus of $ 120 billion , the economy went flat with a bare 0.1 % growth . And almost $ 300 billion worth of pump-priming measures have failed to get Japan moving again . Only faint signs of a recovery in consumer spending have appeared . Worse yet , many economists warn that a cyclical recovery may be incapable of resurrecting the healthy growth of the past . The Industrial Bank_of_Japan recently warned that potential growth through the rest of the century would barely exceed 2 % a year if business investment remained at current levels . By comparison , between 1985 and 1990 , the economy grew by an average of nearly 5 % a year in real terms . What is needed , Ozawa and many economists insist , is a sweeping overhaul of government regulations that prevent new entries into established industries , restrain competition , stifle innovation and even block development of entirely new businesses . Unleashing pent-up demand is the key . U.S. demands for an opening of Japan ' s markets , backed_up by threats of retaliation , spurred Hosokawa into setting a June deadline for developing a plan to accomplish that task . That pledge will remain in place no matter who becomes the next prime_minister . The plan , due_to be presented to President Clinton when he meets with the Japanese prime_minister at the Naples summit of advanced industrialized democracies in July , promises to set the course of future U.S.-Japan economic relations -- either toward cooperation or collision . Last month , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor scorned the first-stage , market-opening plan that Hosokawa ' s government announced . Kantor called it a &quot; half-finished work &quot; that did not satisfy U.S. concerns . But the real battle in Japan over reform lies between now and June , and &quot; it ' s going_to be a bloody fight , &quot; predicted Yoshiji Nogami , deputy of the Foreign Ministry ' s policy division . &quot; Housing , regulation of land , telecommunications , the distribution system , transport -- these are the major areas &quot; for deregulation , he said . &quot; We know what to do , but no one is daring to do_it , &quot; Nogami added . Removing government regulations that preserve price-gouging , for example , could slash by about half the differential that Japanese pay in higher prices compared to the United States , said Iwao Nakatani , a professor at Hitotsubashi University outside Tokyo who is a member of a government commission to promote deregulation . The savings from lower prices could add a consumption-led expansion of 2 % to Japan ' s GNP over a five-year period , he said . But the Catch-22 would be a loss of 6.88 million jobs in industries stripped of regulation , Nakatani admitted . Radical restructuring is difficult because many of the good things about Japanese society are the flip side of its problems , said T . W . Kang , a business consultant here . &quot; A fundamental shift in Japan ' s tightly coupled ' village society ' -- where everyone shares the pains and the fruits -- must occur if the Japanese economy is to be globalized , &quot; he said . Last summer , a major crack appeared in the village as the end of 38 years of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party brought_to power Hosokawa ' s coalition . That shattered the cozy relations in which LDP powerbrokers acted_as lobbyists with the bureaucracy on behalf of interest_groups . Keidanren ( Federation of Economic Organizations ) , the nation ' s most powerful business group , which supported only the Liberal Democrats for nearly four decades , no longer collects funds for them . Masaya Miyoshi , Keidanren president , even described their fall as &quot; part of necessary social reform . Excessive political stability held_back necessary social change and was politically , economically and socially stifling , &quot; Miyoshi said . Moreover , a new electoral_system enacted under Hosokawa will reduce the inflated clout that rural voters have enjoyed until now . Eventually , new single-seat districts in the lower house could force the 10 parties , which the former multi-seat constituencies had nurtured , to merge into two groups . Ozawa , for one , envisions that Japanese politics in the future will be marked less by pork-barrel promises than real debate over policies and the reins of government passing back and forth between two major parties . While political reform has enjoyed strong public support , many Japanese are uneasy about letting deregulation go so far that individual and corporate competition becomes as harsh as it is in the United States . Japanese must_not &quot; let American criticism blind ourselves to the system ' s basic strengths , &quot; warned commentator Yusuke Fukada . Firms should maintain their employee-first philosophy , rejecting the shareholder-first principle of the United States as &quot; hopelessly unstable , &quot; he wrote in the magazine Sansara . They also should not only preserve but strengthen long-term keiretsu ( business group ) ties with suppliers , he argued . The recession and fears about unemployment have stirred unprecedented uncertainty about the future and uneasiness about change . A government poll released last month found that a record 46.4 % of the people surveyed feared that Japan was heading in &quot; a bad direction. &quot; For every 100 people looking_for work , only 60 jobs are available . Unemployment is still below 3 % , but if the number of &quot; excessive &quot; workers carried_on payrolls for the sake of maintaining lifetime employment is counted , potential unemployment is about 6 % . Bloated payrolls are blamed , in part , for spurring manufacturers to increase exports during periods of sluggishness to keep factories operating . While the high growth in the past sustained a seniority pay system , now , with an outlook for only stable or reduced production , &quot; we can ' t help but revise our seniority system , &quot; said Kazuhide Watanabe , Mazda ' s director of personnel and human development . Even a labor federation that includes department_store workers has proposed dropping seniority pay in favor of merit-based wages and &quot; revising &quot; lifetime employment by increasing part-time staff . And Honda has announced a program under which managers who are not promoted will be transferred to non-managerial jobs and suffer pay_cuts of up_to 30 % . Junior managers will be permitted to stay in their jobs no longer than 12 years ; senior managers for up_to nine years . Most corporations are actively paring payrolls by dismissing temporary_workers , reducing the regular work_force through attrition , cutting recruitment , encouraging early retirement , dispatching surplus workers to affiliated firms with low pay scales and slashing bonuses and overtime . Belt-tightening has taken a toll on workers ' income . At Mazda , workers won a 3.8 % pay increase for 1993 but actually wound_up with 6.6 % less income than in 1992 because of cuts_in overtime and bonuses . Meantime , Japanese consumer habits are changing in ways that help boost imports . The old quality-at-any-price consciousness is giving_way to bargain-hunting . Discount stores such_as Aoyama Trading Co . are buying men ' s suits made in China and selling them for as little as $ 95 , compared to prices eight times as high at department_stores . Last year , price_cuts by U.S. firms produced an upheaval in the personal_computer market . Apple gained a 13.4 % share , consolidating its position as Japan ' s No . 2 best-seller . Overall , U.S. makers held a 23.8 % share , up from 15.1 % in 1992 . Yen appreciation , which lowers the cost of_imports , is forcing manufacturers to seek their own form of bargain-hunting overseas . In a historic turnabout , Japan for the first time last year imported more television_sets than it exported , thanks in large part to &quot; reverse imports , &quot; or purchases from Japanese plants overseas . Similarly , Japanese auto_makers were importing from their own plants in the United States more American-built cars than all_of Detroit ' s Big Three put_together . Overseas investment in manufacturing , although down from an annual peak of $ 16.3 billion in 1990 , is still running at about $ 10 billion a year . Yet manufacturing still accounts_for 28 % of Japan ' s economy -- 10 % higher than in the United States -- and Japan ' s biggest industries remain heavily structured toward exports . The biggest problem , however , continues to lie_in the mind-set of bureaucrats , businessmen and even ordinary Japanese . The people here know that change is needed to revitalize their system . But their fundamental instincts still gravitate toward the status_quo . Despite more_than a decade of administrative reforms , the number of national government regulations actually has grown -- to about 11 # 300 , with 300 added just last year . And even now the Fair Trade Commission allows 159 cartels to exist . Japanese are taught from childhood that Japan lacks natural_resources and must export to survive by adding value to imported raw_materials through manufacturing . Even the tiny number of grass-roots movements that have developed under the name of &quot; consumer organizations &quot; seldom question prices . &quot; Of course , there are market rigidities in Japan that work against the interests of the consumers , but there are no real consumers . They are producers because they are employed by producer companies . . . and they are most concerned about their jobs , &quot; said Kazuo Nukazawa , managing director of Keidanren . &quot; When they are buying things , they want to buy cheaply . But when they are afraid of keener competition and the probability of bankruptcy , they resist ( deregulation ) along with the companies. &quot; Even if a stronger leader emerges as Hosokawa ' s successor , implementation of reforms will be &quot; very difficult , because the obstacles come from Japanese society itself , &quot; Mizutani said . &quot; Every society has its own habits and customs coming from its long history. &quot;</TEXT>
