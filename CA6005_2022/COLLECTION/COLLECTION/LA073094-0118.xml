   <HEADLINE> PROPERTY_TAX DECLINE TO HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ; FINANCE : OFFICIALS SAY THEY EXPECT THE STATE TO ABSORB MOST OF THE $ 30 MILLION IN LOST INCOME RESULTING FROM HISTORIC SLIDE IN THE VALUE OF REAL_ESTATE IN THE COUNTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The county auditor-controller office will be crunching numbers this weekend to gauge the impact of the historic drop_in Orange County property values on government coffers . The $ 1.95-million drop reported this week by the county assessor is believed to be the first overall decline of property values in Orange County , reflecting the region ' s soft economy between March , 1993 , and March , 1994 . &quot; As far as we can tell it is the first time ever in the history of the county , &quot; county Assessor Bradley L . Jacobs said . However , local officials said Friday that they don ' t believe the resulting loss of about $ 30 million this year in tax_revenue will deal a severe blow to the county , cities or special districts . Rather , they say , the state will absorb most of the shortfall . The reason , they said , is that in recent years the state Legislature has shifted most property_tax revenue from local_government to schools . Nonetheless , most Orange County school districts will not notice any decline in revenue , financial_officers said , because under state law_schools are guaranteed a fixed level of annual funding based on attendance . The exceptions are Laguna Beach Unified School District and Newport-Mesa Unified School District , which rely entirely on property_taxes to meet their budgets . &quot; Our reliance on the property_tax dollar is not as great as it was once , so the property_tax valuation drop hurts , but it is not a killer , &quot; said Chuck Hulse , the county ' s chief deputy auditor controller . County government now receives only 6 % of the county ' s property_tax revenue , down from 18 % two years ago . Hulse said his office was running the assessment figures through its property_tax accounting_system and multiplying the valuations by the differing tax levies in each city to determine how much each jurisdiction will get . &quot; We should know by next week , &quot; Hulse said . &quot; Since the assessor had been predicting a shortfall , it will not be a shock. &quot; Auditor-Controller Steve E . Lewis estimated that the total loss to all Orange County jurisdictions will be about a $ 30 million . Noting that more_than half the property_tax revenue now is earmarked for education , he said , &quot; What it really means is the state will have to make_up more money for schools. &quot; Bob Giritz , controller for the Santa Ana Unified School District , said although property values in Santa Ana dropped 3.63 % , second only to Stanton where it dropped 3.8 % , he expects &quot; virtually no effect &quot; on the district . &quot; We won ' t do anything differently because we know we will get enough money from the state to make_up the difference , &quot; Giritz said . By contrast , property_taxes are the life ' s blood of Newport-Mesa Unified School District , acknowledged Mike Fine , the district ' s director of fiscal services . In the last three years , he said , the district has had to make &quot; tremendous cuts , &quot; including staff layoffs , because of declining property reassessments . But this time , he said , he believes the district is prepared . The devaluation &quot; has potential to translate into loss of materials and programs and larger class sizes , but I don ' t expect it to in that we planned for a reduction , &quot; Fine said . Costa Mesa City_Manager Allan L . Roeder estimated that the $ 187-million drop_in property values there will translate into a loss of about $ 200 # 000 . &quot; I don ' t think it will have a big effect because of other expenditure cuts we have made , &quot; he said . Moreover , he said , the loss may be more_than recovered by a resurgence of sales tax_revenue in the latter part of 1993 and first_half of 1994 . Jacobs said the happiest calls to his office this week have come from homeowners who expect to pay lower property_taxes this fall . Jacobs said 115 # 000 properties in the county , most of them residences , were reassessed after it was determined that their market_value had declined below their assessed value . In addition , he said , the assessed value of another 142 # 000 properties will not be raised 2 % this year , as is automatically the case under state law , because to do so would raise the assessment above market_value . He said property_owners who have been calling his office &quot; know lower value means lower taxes , and that means they are going_to keep more money in their pockets. &quot;</TEXT>
