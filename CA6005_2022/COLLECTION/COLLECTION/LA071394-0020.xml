   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : SEMIFINALS ; SPOTLIGHT ; NO ARGUMENT HERE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Swedish defender Stefan Schwarz won ' t be playing against Brazil today because he received his second yellow card of the game on Sunday , in the 102nd minute , when he fouled Romanian midfielder Ilie Dumitrescu . &quot; Of course everybody wants to play in the semifinal , but I accept the decision , &quot; he said . &quot; I never talk_about the referee ' s decision . I always accept . I left the field quickly and didn ' t complain , so it was no problem for the referee. &quot; LISA DILLMAN</TEXT>
