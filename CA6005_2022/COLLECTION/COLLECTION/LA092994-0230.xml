   <HEADLINE> 8 OPPOSITION PARTIES JOIN TO TAKE_ON JAPAN COALITION ; POLITICS : NEW GROUP , REFORM , HAS 187 MEMBERS -- JUST 14 FEWER THAN THE LEADING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a step aimed at establishing two-party politics in Japan , eight opposition parties Wednesday registered in Parliament as a unified negotiating group to deal with Socialist Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama ' s tripartite coalition . The new group , named Reform , contains 187 members of the powerful lower house of Parliament -- 14 fewer than the number in the Liberal Democratic Party that is now the major prop of the Murayama coalition . The move toward amalgamation by followers of former Prime_Ministers Toshiki Kaifu , Morihiro Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata and five other parties binds the group to acting_as a single bloc in conducting deliberations and voting in Parliament . Dubbed the &quot; new-new party &quot; because six of its eight groups were formed in the last two years , Reform declared that it will establish a full-fledged party by the end of the year . Yuriko Koike , deputy of Hosokawa ' s Japan New Party , predicted that at least two or three more elections will be necessary to put into shape a two-party system . And even then , it may_not happen , she said . &quot; I have a feeling that a new-new-new party will emerge as a third force , &quot; she said . Shortly after she spoke , four Hosokawa followers , plus a member of Murayama ' s Socialist_Party , announced that they will form their own parliamentary negotiating body . &quot; Moves toward forming the new party are based on old logic that politics means power , and power comes from numbers . . . not democratic and grass-roots principles , &quot; the group , led by Banri Kaieda , a freshman legislator , said in a statement . In still another move , a group of 50 conservative-leaning Socialists , while pledging to remain in Murayama ' s coalition , established a &quot; study group &quot; dedicated to &quot; social liberalism &quot; that would offer a &quot; third path &quot; alternative to Reform and the Liberal Democrats . Unable to name a leader who would become candidate for prime_minister , Reform has also failed so far to come_up with clear-cut policies that would distinguish it from the Liberal Democrats . The former perennial rulers of Japan remain the &quot; party to beat , &quot; especially now that political reforms enacted this year will transform the next lower-house election into battles for single seats in each constituency . Until now , voters in each district elected an average of four representatives -- a system that promoted proliferation of political_parties . Reform pledged to rid Japan of its &quot; one-nation pacifism &quot; -- the longstanding post-World War II thinking that Japan need concern itself only with its own peace -- and make positive contributions to the world , carry_out administrative reform and ease government regulations . The platform differs in nuance from the Murayama coalition only in the degree to which Japan would dispatch troops overseas to participate in U.N. peace-keeping missions . Ichiro Ozawa , the instigator of a rebellion that toppled the Liberal Democrats in 1993 who served as chief strategist for former Prime_Ministers Hosokawa and Hata , was named to Reform ' s No . 2 post . Ozawa -- one of Japan ' s most assertive and therefore controversial leaders -- will have the final say in nominating candidates for the next lower-house election expected late next year or in 1996 .</TEXT>
