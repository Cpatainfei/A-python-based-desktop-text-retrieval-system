   <HEADLINE> U.S. SIGNALS CUBA IT ' S READY TO DEAL ; REFUGEES : SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS ADMINISTRATION MAY EASE RESTRICTIONS ON LEGAL IMMIGRATION . STATEMENT APPEARS MEANT TO ENCOURAGE PROGRESS AT UPCOMING TALKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher on Sunday sent a signal outlining a possible U.S. deal with Cuba on migration , saying the Clinton_Administration may allow more Cubans to enter the United States through legal immigration if Fidel Castro agrees to stop his citizens from going_to sea in rafts . In a television interview , Christopher suggested that the Administration is willing to change current policies , broaden the categories of Cubans who can immigrate legally and speed_up the processing of their applications if that will help end the crisis . His statement was the clearest public signal yet of the Administration ' s willingness to meet one of Castro ' s longstanding demands : easier legal emigration for discontented Cubans . &quot; We ' re quite prepared to talk to them about legal , lawful migration to the United States , how to make that more effective , what categories of people can come_in to the United States , &quot; Christopher said on the CBS-TV program &quot; Face the Nation. &quot; &quot; We ' re quite prepared to consider lawful migration , perhaps enhanced lawful migration , if they ' re prepared to stop the unlawful migration. &quot; Until now , U.S. immigration policy has granted legal entry only to about 3 # 000 Cubans a year in three categories : those with close relatives already in the country , those with needed skills or those with a documented history of political persecution . At the same time , however , U.S. law allows Cubans who enter the country illegally to stay and apply for refugee status . Castro has long complained that the effect of that policy was to encourage illegal emigration , including boat and aircraft hijackings . Earlier this month , when Cubans rioted over economic problems and emigration restrictions , Castro announced that his government would no longer stop citizens from going_to sea -- producing an exodus of more_than 17 # 000 Cubans in two weeks . Last week , the Clinton_Administration proposed formal talks with Cuba on the immigration problem , and the negotiations are expected to begin in New York on Wednesday . Christopher ' s statement appears aimed at encouraging the Cubans to come_to the talks ready to make a deal that could help end the crisis . &quot; We want them to know that we are serious about having substantive , productive talks , &quot; a Christopher aide said . Although Castro has used the crisis to renew his demand for a lifting of the three-decade-old U.S. trade_embargo on Cuba , experts say they believe that his real objectives are far more modest : easier legal emigration , U.S. prosecution of Cubans who make_it to Florida in stolen aircraft or boats , and restoration of permission for Cuban Americans to send money to relatives on the island . On Sunday , Castro took a small step toward reimposing control over seaborne emigration from Cuba , announcing that he has ordered his coast guard to stop people from taking children to sea on unsafe boats and rafts . An order signed by Castro said the measure was taken_to protect the lives of Cubans who are too young to have &quot; the capacity to decide for themselves , &quot; the Reuters news_agency reported from Havana . An unknown number of refugees , apparently including some children , have died after setting to sea on flimsy homemade rafts made of inner_tubes , Styrofoam and wood . Officials said the number of rafters found in the Florida Straits slowed even further Sunday , apparently because of scattered showers and choppy seas . By evening , only 61 Cubans had been plucked from the 90-mile stretch of sea separating Cuba and Florida , a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman said . Castro ' s order said the Cuban coast guard will patrol territorial_waters within 12 miles of the island ' s coast to &quot; provide help if necessary &quot; for people aboard rafts and boats but will not arrest them . The Clinton_Administration welcomed the action as an apparent step_in the right direction . &quot; If the Cuban government is taking steps to discourage illegal migration that puts Cuban citizens at great risk , then we would welcome that development as consistent with our view , &quot; State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said . The emigration crisis has thus placed Castro and Clinton in paradoxical positions : Castro is now actively assisting Cubans who want to flee to the United States , and Clinton is implicitly asking him to use his repressive police_forces to stop them . Castro wants to allow discontented Cubans to leave as a &quot; safety_valve &quot; that removes potentially dangerous dissidents from the island , but he does not relish the damaging image of his countrymen fleeing desperately on rafts . Under a 1984 accord , the United States agreed to admit 27 # 845 Cubans each year as legal immigrants , but in practice the U.S._government has admitted only a small fraction of that number . Christopher ' s statement suggested the basis of a deal that could serve the interests of both sides : The Administration could broaden the categories of Cubans allowed to enter , thus increasing the number . In return , Castro could order his police and coast guard to resume discouraging people from leaving illegally on boats and rafts . Christopher also held_out a slim signal of hope to Castro on a broader issue : the Cuban leader ' s desire for wide-ranging talks with the United States toward normalizing political_relations and lifting the trade_embargo . &quot; If he moves toward democracy in a tangible , significant way , we ' ll respond in a carefully calibrated way , &quot; Christopher said . But he refused to offer any specifics . But Christopher repeated the Administration ' s insistence that this week ' s talks on immigration will not be allowed to spill_over into broader issues . &quot; On other subjects , we really don ' t have very much to say to Castro . He knows what he needs to do , &quot; Christopher said . The secretary_of_state said firmly that the Administration is not considering a naval_blockade of the island , despite calls_for one from conservative Republicans and Cuban Americans . &quot; We do not favor a blockade at the present_time . It is not contemplated . We seek peaceful change , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; We think a naval_blockade can lead toward confrontation . It ' s an act of war. &quot; Last week , White_House Chief_of_Staff Leon E . Panetta said such a blockade might be an option . But this week , most criticism of the Administration has come from the opposite direction -- from both Republicans and Democrats who argue that Clinton is making a mistake when he rules_out broader political negotiations with Castro . Sen . Richard G . Lugar ( R-Ind. ) , a leading Republican foreign_policy spokesman , said Clinton should offer to gradually lift the U.S. trade_embargo on Cuba in exchange for the release of political_prisoners and other moves toward democracy . Rep . Lee H . Hamilton ( D-Ind. ) , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , agreed . &quot; We ' ve had a lot of experience in recent years about how you move a communist country to freedom -- and the lesson of that is to broaden and to intensify contacts , &quot; Hamilton said . &quot; Let ' s open_up Cuba just as much as we can. &quot; Both legislators were interviewed Sunday on NBC-TV ' s &quot; Meet the Press. &quot; Sen . Alan K . Simpson ( R-Wyo. ) , a leading conservative , and liberal Sens . Christopher J . Dodd ( D-Conn. ) and Patrick J . Leahy ( D-Vt. ) have made similar statements . But Clinton promised Cuban American leaders in Florida , a battleground state in the 1992 presidential election , that he would not open talks with Castro , and he has kept that promise . Sen . Connie Mack ( R-Fla. ) said the reasons for refusing to deal with Castro had not changed . &quot; This man is a thug . He ' s a killer . He ' s a communist. &quot;</TEXT>
