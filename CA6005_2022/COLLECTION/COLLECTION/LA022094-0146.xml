   <HEADLINE> ROHRABACHER ' S STAND ON IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Regarding Antonio Asasta Sweet ' s diatribe , ( Letters , Feb . 6 ) : He writes that Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) is a racist and is dehumanizing and criminalizing a whole population ! What tommyrot . Rohrabacher has never referred to American citizens ( as Acosta wrote he became ) in his efforts for justice , only to illegal immigrants in this country.Acosta Sweet is the one who has his facts incorrect . Congrats , Acosta Sweet , on being a wage-earner , professional and &quot; educated. &quot; Is this how we are rewarded for giving citizenship and educating people that come from other countries ? There are too many people like Acosta Sweet jumping_on the word racism as soon as illegal immigrants are mentioned . We need more Dana Rohrabachers representing our districts . DEE H .
