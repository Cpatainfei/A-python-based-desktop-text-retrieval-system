   <HEADLINE> SEC INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE KICKBACKS IN ORANGE COUNTY ; BANKRUPTCY : RELATIONSHIP OF BROKERS TO OFFICIALS IS UNDER SCRUTINY , SOURCE SAYS . SUPERVISORS DENY WRONGDOING AS LIQUIDATION OF PORTFOLIO BEGINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a broad investigation of possible influence peddling in the top reaches of Orange County government , looking specifically to determine whether brokers paid kickbacks to elected officials , a high-ranking source close to the investigation said Thursday . The probe has focused_on &quot; campaign contributions and kickbacks , things of that nature , and the relationship of broker-dealers to those officials , &quot; the source said . &quot; When someone is making a lot of money on you , is there a quid_pro_quo ? It ' s happened in the area of municipal securities before. &quot; It was unclear whether any evidence of wrongdoing has surfaced . The Times reported in some editions Thursday that the SEC had issued subpoenas to members of the Board of Supervisors and former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron demanding that they turn_over a huge array of documents -- including their federal and state tax_returns , personal diaries and calendars , checking and savings account_statements and records of any gifts or loans from investment brokers . The investigation focuses primarily on brokerages -- particularly Merrill Lynch , Wall_Street ' s biggest investment house , which has handled millions of dollars worth of bond transactions for the county ' s investment pool . On Thursday in Los Angeles , SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr . suggested that Orange County voters oust the elected officials who allowed the debacle to occur . &quot; If your supervisors are so lax that they allow . . . that kind of speculation , I think the voters of that community should throw the whole bunch of ( them ) out of office , &quot; Levitt said . Merrill Lynch spokesman Richard Silverman said Thursday that the firm would &quot; cooperate fully &quot; with the SEC . He declined to discuss the subpoenas , except to reaffirm that the brokerage acted &quot; professionally and properly &quot; in all its dealings with the county . Orange County supervisors , stunned by the unprecedented demand for records from the SEC , pledged to comply with the subpoenas but reacted angrily to any suggestion that the board may have been too close to Wall_Street investment_bankers . &quot; I feel absolutely confident that , as far as I ' m concerned , I can sleep very comfortably , &quot; said Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F . Riley . &quot; There ' s no implication there were kickbacks , &quot; said Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder . &quot; I don ' t even know those Merrill Lynch people . Those names are all foreign to me . Besides , they don ' t need to lobby ( our offices on ) the fifth floor . They had Citron. &quot; In other developments Thursday : * The county auctioned $ 483 million worth of securities from its investment pool , the first_step toward liquidating the fund , which has dropped $ 2.02 billion -- about 27 % -- in value this year . Officials of Salomon Bros. , the county ' s financial adviser , expressed satisfaction with demand for the bonds on Wall_Street , but they fetched less than the average value Salomon had attributed to the fund ' s less risky holdings . * Officials unveiled an interim plan to divide the pool ' s revenues as the fund is liquidated , a process that could take from one week to six months . The 187 cities , school districts and other agencies that invested in the pool -- along with youngsters whose damages from private lawsuits were deposited in the fund -- initially would receive 30 % of the money they put_in , a total of $ 2.24 billion . The government_agencies could then use the money to pay salaries and other bills . * Administrators of nonprofit agencies that contract with the county said they were becoming increasingly alarmed about delays in payment for services such_as child-abuse treatment and refugee vocational_training . Some began to make emergency plans and held staff meetings to discuss layoffs , furloughs and even closure . &quot; We ' re trying to pare_down everything we can until the county finds its feet -- and its head -- and finds the resources to keep us going , &quot; said Hank Paris , executive_director of the Fullerton-based Child Guidance Center . * Leaders of PTAs and educational foundations said the county ' s fiscal crisis could mean that thousands of dollars they raise each year for extras such_as computers , music and art might go instead to pay_for basic items and day-to-day operations . * State Controller Gray Davis blamed the Board of Supervisors for the financial crisis , saying they delegated too_much authority to Citron . &quot; The responsibility lies_with the supervisors , &quot; Davis said , noting that the board essentially had rubber-stamped the treasurer ' s plans . &quot; Now all_of the citizens are going_to pay a price for all_of the excesses , &quot; he said . * Assemblyman Willie Brown said he would support lending state money to Orange County , if necessary , to gas_up police_cars and keep schools open . But the Democratic leader of the lower house said he gleefully awaits begging by some Orange County legislators who refused to help_out other areas in need -- including his hometown of San Francisco after the 1989 earthquake . * Gov . Pete Wilson directed state transportation officials to expedite a $ 15-million advance to the Orange County Transportation Authority , which has more_than $ 1 billion tied_up in the county ' s fund . The money is for road improvements , including the massive Santa Ana Freeway widening project . Repercussions Spread The financial crisis was apparent on the streets of Orange County and in the corridors of financial_institutions . About 40 members of Teamsters Local 952 marched through the first_floor of Merrill Lynch ' s Santa Ana office , accusing the investment_firm of profiting from the county ' s financial ruin . Protesters demanded the brokerage return profits made from underwriting risky investments with tax money . The union represents 15 # 000 workers in Orange County . A Westminster resident , Nancy Schwartz , was shaken when an American Savings Bank branch initially refused to cash a county-issued child_support check . After a flurry of calls verified that funds in the county ' s child_support account were not frozen , the branch agreed to accept the $ 200 deposit . &quot; It ' s a hell of a scare , &quot; Schwartz said . The people who run nonprofit organizations were nervous , too , about when they would be paid . &quot; We don ' t think_about anything else , &quot; said Paris , whose children ' s center contracts with the county to provide child-abuse counseling and other mental_health services . He said the county owes his group $ 200 # 000 -- much of it money the county simply administers for the state and federal_governments . Paris said the center would be forced to close if the money didn ' t arrive by Feb . 15 . &quot; The statement that the checks are in the mail could never be more beautiful , &quot; he said . Overshadowing Thursday ' s developments was the SEC investigation . Sources said that SEC officials met with Citron in April to discuss his use of high-risk investments such_as reverse repurchase agreements and structured notes . Those loans and instruments helped the county ' s investment fund earn enviable returns while interest_rates were falling . But as rates rose over the past year , they helped drive the fund and the county into bankruptcy -- and Citron out of office . Citron assured investigators that authorizations for such transactions came &quot; at every level , &quot; one source said . &quot; Now we ' re finding out that maybe this wasn ' t the case. &quot; County Counsel Terry Andrus said that after discussing the_matter with SEC investigators , the scope of the agency request for documents has been &quot; narrowed somewhat , &quot; but he refused to elaborate . County officials say the precise amount of information to be turned_over by the supervisors is still being negotiated . &quot; At this point , I have no reason to believe that the Board of Supervisors is the subject of that investigation , &quot; Andrus said . Andrus quoted from the SEC ' s letter to the supervisors , which said the inquiry &quot; should not be construed as an indication . . . that any violations of law have occurred. &quot; A former federal_agent said the SEC ' s broad-brush approach to the Orange County case was not unusual . &quot; To some degree it ' s a fishing expedition ; they are looking_for what ' s there , &quot; said Sam Gruenbaum , an attorney with Cox Castle &amp; Nicholson in Los Angeles and a former high-ranking SEC enforcement officer . &quot; They will be looking_at whether the relationships that existed were purely for underwriting or if there was more to the relationship that wasn ' t disclosed. &quot; If there were financial ties between the supervisors and Wall_Street firms that were not disclosed -- either to other board_members or to those who invested in the county pool at the time of the county ' s bond deals -- that could point to possible violations of securities laws , Gruenbaum and others said . &quot; If they find improper links , that could be the basis for serious non-disclosure issues , &quot; said Gruenbaum . &quot; How much disclosure should there have been about the county ' s investment policy is very complicated. &quot; Citron ' s attorney , David Weichert , declined to comment on the SEC investigation or the request for records from his client . But Weichert said the SEC action was not unexpected . &quot; We are not surprised at all that the SEC would take an interest in the circumstances surrounding the county ' s loss , &quot; he said . &quot; Furthermore , we believe that when all facts come_to_light , Mr. Citron will be totally exonerated from the reckless charges and innuendo that has appeared regularly in the press. &quot; Investors Gather While the SEC investigation continued , a group of officials representing cities , schools and other public entities said they would need $ 117 million of their money from the county fund by week ' s end . Many of the officials emerged tight-lipped from the closed-door briefing in Santa Ana by Salomon Bros. , part of the county ' s new financial team . &quot; They ' re doing a scheduled , logical liquidation of their assets , &quot; said Villa Park City_Manager Fred Naley . &quot; I think they ' ve got some of the best people working_on the problem. &quot; But others said the meeting ' s atmosphere was edgy and that many of the investors ' substantive questions about how and when money will be disbursed from the fund remained unanswered . &quot; They ' re blowing sunshine at you , &quot; one attorney who represents a water district said as he emerged from the meeting . &quot; We have payrolls that have to be committed to next week. &quot; Echoing criticism from Wall_Street , officials of some of the agencies that invested in the pool questioned whether the entire fund should be sold_off now ; specifically , they urged Salomon Bros . to keep holdings with a maturity of four years rather than rushing to sell them . And the jostling for priority among the fund ' s creditors continued , with some agency officials indicating they thought the county should be last in_line -- behind the cities , schools and other investors -- for withdrawing money from the pool . Also up_in_the_air is how property_tax collections due for distribution Dec . 20 will be doled_out , said Joel S . Miliband , an attorney whose firm represents the cities of Newport Beach , Laguna Hills and Fountain Valley , along with several water districts . Miliband said the creditors need to sit_down to work_out &quot; which agencies need cash and for what purposes and how much . . . . The question is , ' Who has emergency cash needs in the next 10 days , intermediate needs in the next 30 days ? ' When everybody thinks_about what needs to happen , they ' ll see that there has to be cooperation. &quot; Securities Auctioned Salomon Bros . sold $ 483 million of the county ' s remaining $ 7.96 billion of securities in a wide-open auction Thursday , the first_step in making funds available to the pool ' s investors . Although the face_value of the bonds sold was $ 483 million , they were sold for prices ranging from 89.5 cents to 94.5 cents on the dollar . So the county ' s actual cash intake from the sale will be between $ 432 million and $ 456 million . The rush to unload them came as county officials tried to ward_off a slew of new economic announcements that they believed could cause another hike in interest_rates . The bonds attracted offers from a substantial number of investors , drawing $ 7.5 billion in bids , according to Salomon . &quot; We were very pleased with demand , &quot; a Salomon executive said . The sale got a boost from a drop_in shorter-term market interest_rates , as more investors began to bet that the Federal_Reserve_Board will defer any additional rate hikes until 1995 . The Fed meets next week . But Wall_Street analysts said the bonds sold Thursday were conventional issues maturing in two to four years -- the kind of holdings that should be the easiest to sell among the county pool ' s remaining securities . Salomon ' s much bigger challenge will be to auction or restructure the complex &quot; derivatives &quot; that comprise 60 % of the remaining portfolio . On Monday , Salomon had estimated that the overall portfolio was worth about 92 cents on the dollar . If sold for less than that , the 27 % loss now expected by fund investors from their original deposits to the fund will grow . Salomon said it will auction another $ 566 million of the county fund ' s bonds today .
