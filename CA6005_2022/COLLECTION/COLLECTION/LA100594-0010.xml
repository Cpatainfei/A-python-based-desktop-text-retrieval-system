   <TEXT> As the editor of Mother Jones magazine , and the author of the breast_cancer article in Mother Jones that your media critic , David Shaw , criticized on Sept . 13 , we would like to correct a_few of his misconceptions . Shaw contends that there is no breast_cancer epidemic . His subhead announces that &quot; the facts suggest that early diagnosis and a larger population are behind the increase. &quot; Such a statement demonstrates that Shaw has only a slight acquaintance with the research on breast_cancer . The larger-population argument is ridiculous . Disease statistics are always expressed in terms of cases ( or deaths ) per 100 # 000 population , specifically to prevent population growth from distorting the numbers . The breast_cancer rate has increased approximately 26 % since 1973 . As for the impact of early detection , the largest and most methodologically rigorous study contradicts Shaw . That study , by Emily White Ph.D. , concluded that mammography explained most of the observed increase in breast_cancer for women over 45 , but only half the increase in younger_women . Why the increase in the breast_cancer rate ? There is no smoking gun . But a thorough reading of the epidemiological literature turns_up a possibility that looks_at least like a loaded gun -- pollution by things like dioxin and organochlorine pesticides that have effects similar to estrogen , a hormone well-known to stimulate the growth of breast tumors . Shaw is quick to cite one study , released last spring , showing no association between pesticide exposure and breast_cancer risk . But the co-authors of that study point_out several reasons why dismissing a link is premature . One is that compared with earlier studies , which did suggest a link , theirs included an unusually large proportion of Asian women , who are known to have a relatively low breast_cancer risk . Remove the Asian women from the subject pool , and the data shows an association between pesticide exposure and breast_cancer risk . Furthermore , Shaw neglected to mention another study released around the same time that showed a clear association between breast_cancer risk and the distance women live from chemical plants on Long_Island . The message of the Mother Jones article was that a potentially productive line of research has , to date , been given short_shrift . As a magazine that goes_out to activists , Mother Jones often alerts opinion leaders to issues that the mainstream media have either ignored , or in the case of Shaw ' s article , trivialized .
