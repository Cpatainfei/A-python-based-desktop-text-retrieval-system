   <HEADLINE> BOSNIAN SERBS EXPEL 800 MUSLIMS FROM TOWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hundreds of Muslims were reportedly dragged from their homes or rounded_up on the streets of a northeastern Bosnian town as Serbian leaders warned Sunday of an all-out war and recommended that their legislature reject an international peace plan . About 800 Muslims -- men older than 50 , women and children -- were rounded_up this weekend in Bijeljina by a Bosnian Serb paramilitary group , according to eyewitnesses in the town near Bosnia ' s border with Serbia . U.N. officials confirmed the forced expulsions , the biggest since September , from the town of 35 # 000 , where Muslims were in the majority before Serbian forces took it over in April , 1992 . The expulsions are yet another sign of Serbian defiance of the international community ' s insistence that Bosnia-Herzegovina remain a unified country composed of two ethnic mini-states . The clock is ticking toward Tuesday ' s deadline for the rival assemblies of the Bosnian Serb and Muslim-Croatian federation to vote on the peace plan . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic put it bluntly , saying the Serbs would say &quot; no if the international community presses us into a corner , &quot; the Bosnian Serb news_agency SRNA reported . The plan gives the Muslim-Croatian federation 51 % of Bosnia , forcing the Serbs to pull_back from some of the 70 % of the country they have conquered during two years of war . The Bosnian government has indicated that it will recommend that its Parliament adopt the plan when deputies meet in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo today , but only because Serbian rejection is likely . Bosnian Serb Deputy Premier Vitomir Popovic said the plan put_forward by the United States , Russia and Western European_countries is &quot; absolutely unacceptable for the Serbian people and should be rejected in its entirety. &quot; By voting against the plan , Bosnian Serb representatives to the self-styled assembly would defy threats of tightened U.N. sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro , which together make_up what remains of Yugoslavia , and risk the lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia ' s Muslim-led government . They say the plan would mean surrendering their &quot; state &quot; and 13 important towns and strategic territory . The plan forces them to concede land in the northern corridor , which is key for linking Serbia proper with Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia . Karadzic warned of a total war if the Serbs vote for an outright rejection , saying , &quot; In this case , all people will have to be mobilized , including women. &quot; Diplomats , however , believe the Serbian assembly will try to couch their &quot; no &quot; as a &quot; yes , but &quot; vote_in the hopes of breaking the fragile consensus in the international community . But U.S. Defense_Secretary William J . Perry said Sunday that NATO and the United States face deeper military involvement in Bosnia whether or not the warring parties decide to accept the peace plan , the Associated Press reported . If the factions reject the plan , it could lead to rapid expansion of North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization air protection of &quot; safe areas &quot; and a spread of the civil_war to other nations , Perry warned during a visit to Romania . Even if the plan is accepted , it will mean sending thousands of U.S. and other peacekeeping troops to Bosnia , he said . Until the weekend ' s attempt by Serbs to expel any remaining minorities in what they hope will be a Greater Serbia , about 4 # 000 Muslims remained in Bijeljina , many losing their jobs , property and homes . &quot; We fear for our lives , &quot; said a non-Serb woman speaking by telephone from the town on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals . &quot; They barged into the apartment of an old Muslim woman and dragged her away. &quot;</TEXT>
