   <HEADLINE> MARKET FOCUS ; COLA INVASION STIRS UP INDIA ' S NATIONALIST FEELINGS ; SOCIALISTS DENOUNCE IT AS A NEW FORM OF COLONIALISM AND THREATEN TO PICKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Quit India ! &quot; More_than half a century ago , with the Japanese army advancing toward the Indian frontier and seemingly unstoppable , Mohandas K . Gandhi , the &quot; Great Soul , &quot; launched the call_for the_British to leave his country , immediately and unconditionally . His target was the injustice and humiliation of colonialism . Now a coalition of alarmed Indian socialists has dusted off his slogan and his tactics of nonviolent protest to battle a more recent foreign foe : &quot; cola-onalism , &quot; the fizzy , ubiquitous drinks made by Coca-Cola and Pepsi . &quot; These are the two most aggressive agencies of pushing in what I consider American culture . That includes a lot of things , from junk food to Madonna to Michael Jackson , &quot; said George Fernandes , a former minister , labor organizer and leader of the Janata Dal party . Unless the soft-drink giants leave India voluntarily by the month ' s end , starting March 1 their bottling plants and retail outlets will be picketed and trucks carrying their products will be blocked , Fernandes announced on behalf of Samajwadi Abhiyan , an umbrella alliance of socialists . Fernandes , responsible_for driving Coke out of the Indian market in 1977 ( Coke returned last fall ) , claimed that movement organizers can count_on the support of 200 # 000 nationalist students in universities in the New Delhi area , as well as &quot; millions &quot; worried that jobs in Indian enterprises are in jeopardy . Those forecasts seem preposterous . But regardless of how many people lie_down in front of delivery_vans or agree to boycott Coke and Pepsi , the &quot; quit India &quot; campaign , freighted with the symbols and strategy of the fight against imperialism , is a reminder of how touchy some Indian leaders and intellectuals still are about foreign penetration of their once nearly hermetically sealed economy . &quot; The world has changed in 50 years , &quot; ' objected P . M . Sinha , managing director of Pepsi Foods Ltd. , who claims that Fernandes and his backers just haven ' t kept_up . &quot; The country today exists in a new environment of global integration. &quot; Pepsi , he said , will stand_pat . &quot; Quit India &quot; redux may be one of the last gasps of the ideal of a self-sufficient , import-free India minted in the heyday of Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru , India ' s first prime_minister . For the last year , a new , more open India attracted more foreign investment than during the whole of the 1980s . American , as well as European and Japanese , companies are arriving en masse . Many will watch the anti-cola campaign to see whether the old slogans have any life left . The experiences of Cargill , the U.S. grain-trading dynasty , indicate that , at least in some economic sectors or regions , foreigners may be in_for a bumpy ride . The Minneapolis-based company , one of America ' s largest privately held corporations , sells hybrid sunflower and corn seed in India ; in December , 1992 , hundreds of militants attacked its office in Bangalore , looted the seedlings and computer records and tossed them in a bonfire outside , said Cargill ' s India general_manager , Raza Hasnain . Last July , a mob was back , laying_waste_to sections of a seed-processing plant under construction . Cargill was targeted because of a provision in the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , then being debated , that allowed the patenting of new strains of seeds . Fernandes warned at the time that multinationals like Cargill &quot; will hook farmers to their products , then raise prices . In the process , our agricultural base will collapse. &quot; Despite the destruction , Cargill says that it still intends to do business in India . &quot; Neither attack has deterred us from our initial intentions : We ' re here to serve the Indian farmer , &quot; said Hasnain , whose office is now guarded by a security agent armed with a double-barreled shotgun . Fernandes , who also tangled_with Cargill over its proposal to create a giant coastal salt farm , says his concerns are economic . In an interview in the white-washed Delhi bungalow that serves as his command_post , the bespectacled lawmaker claimed that over the next three years , Coke and Pepsi combined would siphon almost half a_billion dollars in royalties and profits out of India . That sum , he said , would be enough to pay_for the construction of 600 miles of broad-gauge railroad and to employ 30 # 000 people to run it . &quot; This is a country where four-fifths of the villages are without potable drinking_water , &quot; Fernandes said . &quot; The law of the market cannot be allowed to operate. &quot; Although his party ' s clout has waned , Fernandes knows that soft-drink companies pay_attention when he speaks . As minister of industry in the Janata Dal government in 1977 , he demanded that Coca-Cola turn_over a majority share of its holdings and reveal its secret formula if it wanted to continue doing business in India . Instead , Coke left . The world ' s most popular soft_drink returned to the Indian market last October , opening a bottling plant in a dusty little industrial town near Agra , site of the fabled Taj Mahal . That , and the Coke garden umbrellas that have sprouted in eateries near the Taj , is an unmistakable sign that the country that had battled imports to_the_point of developing domestic alternatives to Coke -- Campa Cola and Thums Up -- has changed . To secure a launch_pad in the Indian market , Coke entered into a $ 70-million &quot; strategic alliance &quot; with the maker of Thums Up , an Indian drinks manufacturer named Parle that boasted a 60 % market share . Business insiders say the deal is a barely disguised takeover by Coke . Pepsi , meanwhile , has seized 24 % of India ' s cola trade . Pepsi naturally rejects the socialists ' line_of_reasoning and arithmetic . It entered the Indian market three years ago , subject_to a raft of government restrictions ( including the addition of the Hindi word for wave , lehar , to its brand name ) . Its executives say that far from sucking money out of India , they are enriching it . &quot; In three years , we have grown to be one of the largest exporters ; in the next five years , we should be one of the top five , &quot; said Sinha , the Pepsi manager . &quot; As of today , we have almost brought_in $ 50 million in foreign_exchange . I don ' t think that in the next 10 years a single cent will go_out of this country . We are now in an investment phase. &quot; In Madras , Pepsi is building a $ 27-million plant to manufacture plastic bottles . The company just received a $ 20-million order to ship returnable glass bottles to the Persian_Gulf . Pepsi also plans to open Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut restaurants , thereby creating more Indian jobs , Sinha said . The cola merchants look_upon India with unconcealed ambition because of its growth potential . Soft-drink consumption averages a paltry three bottles per capita each year , compared to a reported 750 in the United States and more_than 1 # 100 in Mexico . Fernandes says that India already has its own colas and that foreign concoctions are really no different , so India isn ' t getting any advanced foreign technology in return for permitting market access . In a larger sense , he is concerned about India as it exists today -- a country where vast private wealth and 60 % illiteracy and widespread poverty coexist . &quot; Unless there is a return to Gandhi , we are lost , &quot; he said . Last year , Fernandes and his followers dusted off another Gandhian action -- the famed &quot; salt march &quot; staged by the Indian nationalist in 1930 to protest the_British government monopoly on salt -- and used it against another Cargill project . Depending_on whom one listens to , the campaign worked , or it didn ' t . Cargill wanted to build a salt works in the Gujarati port of Kandla and promised the Indian government to export its entire 1-million ton annual output of industrial salt . The government gave its approval . &quot; Their plant would have meant massive unemployment in the salt sector , where 150 # 000 Indians are employed , &quot; Fernandes claimed , disputing Cargill ' s contention that it would not produce for the domestic market . He launched a civil_disobedience movement he says mobilized 20 # 000 people in Uttar Pradesh state alone . Hasnain acknowledges that Fernandes did slow the project . But there were other factors , he said , including suspicions by some Indians of CIA involvement . The clincher proved to be the economic downturn experienced by Japan , the plant ' s target market . When it became clear that Japan would n ' t be able to absorb an additional million tons of industrial salt , Hasnain said , Cargill shelved the idea , at least for now . Pondering the arguments of socialists like Fernandes , India-born Hasnain rejects them as having failed miserably . &quot; Our umbilical_cord always was to the Soviet_Union . We regarded foreign investment as an enemy . And look where we are today , &quot; the Cargill executive said . &quot; In 1960 , South_Korea and India had the same gross_domestic_product per capita . Today , South_Korea ' s is 10 times higher. &quot;</TEXT>
