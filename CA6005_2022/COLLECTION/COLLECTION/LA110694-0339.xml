   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : WAIKIKI ; VINTAGE VACATION ; A NOSTALGIA-SOAKED SEARCH FOR REMNANTS OF A PRE-DON HO PAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> My first visit to Waikiki came 40 years too late . I wanted Arthur Godfrey ' s Hawaii . Harry Truman in aloha shirts . A lei-strewn Matson Liner welcome at the docks . Alas , both Arthur and Harry have gone_on to the big luau in the sky and at the Honolulu airport , fresh leis must be purchased out of refrigerator cases . My attachment to the islands comes from the Hawaiiana I have collected over the years -- postcards , books , magazines and photos from what I call the pre-Don Ho era , the time between 1927 , when Matson Line opened the Royal Hawaiian Hotel and inaugurated passenger service between California and Hawaii , and the late 1950s , when statehood , jet travel and the arrival of Elvis signaled the end of that romantic period . Though I couldn ' t experience the Golden Age of Tourism firsthand , I was determined to find a_few vestiges of the past on my trip last summer . On my old postcards , the Royal Hawaiian Hotel is surrounded by acres of lush palm groves . The grounds are now pared_down in size , but thickets of elephant ' s ears and birds_of_paradise still hug the pink Moorish palace . The salons , no longer overdecorated in pattern-on-pattern splendor , remain stately and cool . Tacky Waikiki , just beyond the porte-cochere , seems far away . The room of my dreams ( Diamond Head view , of course ) was $ 350 a night , so I contented myself with breakfasts and late-afternoon drinks at the Royal ' s Surf Room and Mai Tai Bar . Sitting there , I could reach over the sea wall and grab a handful of Waikiki sand , remembering photos of Bing Crosby playing a ukulele serenade on the same spot , Shirley Temple being made an honorary Waikiki lifeguard . . . probably a_few feet away , Cary Grant ( a guest in the 1930s ) relaxing in the teak deck_chairs that still face the water . Through trial_and_error , I discovered that the best time for drinks at the Royal Hawaiian is at sunset on Wednesdays . that ' s when local outrigger-canoe clubs practice in the bay with Diamond Head as the backdrop -- just like they did 50 years ago . Duke ' s Canoe Club restaurant in the Outrigger Waikiki Hotel , wedged ( really wedged ) between the Royal Hawaiian and Sheraton Moana Surfrider , is_on the site of the original Outrigger_Canoe Club -- a hang-out for Hawaiian beach boys with names like Chickie , Squeeze , Panama Dave and Ox . Today , it ' s a Chart House-kind-of-place that pays homage to the Golden Age with Duke Kahanamoku memorabilia on the walls . The restaurant ' s namesake was the most famous of these beach boys -- a two-time Olympic-swimming gold medalist ( 1912 and 1920 ) and Hawaii ' s most recognizable figure . It ' s worth a walk-through , even if you don ' t eat here , to study the old photos of Waikiki beach life and get a sense of how big and heavy those old surfboards were . A shiny , dark 17-footer is_on display . Built_in 1901 , the Sheraton Moana Surfrider is the oldest hotel on Waikiki Beach and , thanks to a $ 20-million restoration in 1989 , it retains its Victorian splendor . The 99-year-old banyan_tree helps . . . and so do the ornate banisters and molding . Old-fashioned rocking_chairs line the front_porch facing Kalakaua Avenue . The essence of vintage Waikiki is the Moana ' s banyan veranda and patio . For 40 years , beginning in 1935 , &quot; Hawaii Calls &quot; was broadcast to as_many as 750 radio_stations from this spot . The hula music was interspersed with sounds of waves lapping the shore and announcements of the air and water temperatures ( torture for listeners in Syracuse in mid-January , which was the intent ) . Now , evenings in one corner on the patio , a group of Hawaiian musicians play old-time hapa-haoli ( half-Caucasian ) songs . Listeners can order drinks from the courtyard bar or , better yet , settle into luxurious , over-sized rattan chairs on the broad veranda for drinks and a $ 9.95 all-you-can-eat , takes-the-place-of-dinner hors d ' oeuvres buffet . Here , the paradise that 1950s mainlanders like my grandparents dreamed about is still palpable . At the other end of Waikiki from the Moana , a convincing re-creation of &quot; Hawaii Calls , &quot; now called &quot; Sounds of Aloha &quot; for legal reasons , is recorded Thursday evenings at the Shell Bar of the Hilton Hawaiian Village . This hotel is very 1960s in its ambience , too recent for my tastes , but close your eyes and you ' re back 40 years : &quot; Sweet Leilani &quot; plays , followed by an announcement of the current water temperature , usually hovering around 80 degrees . The show is broadcast on Honolulu ' s all-Hawaiian-music radio_station KCCN on Saturdays at 11:30 a.m. It ' s also broadcast in Los Angeles on KJOI ( Sundays , 8 a.m. ) and KGRB ( Sundays at 10 a.m ) . * The closest I got_to the steamship welcome of my dreams was at the Matson Liner exhibit at the Hawaii Maritime Center , on the Honolulu docks . Paper streamers cascade over the side of the S.S. Lurline ( well , a_few feet of starboard anyway ) . A horn blows . On the headset tour , a former steward talks_about the glory days of leisurely ocean-liner travel_by the well-to-do . There is a life-size re-creation of a corner of the elegant dining_room , and old film footage takes us back to yesteryear . The centerpiece of this exhibit is a 4-foot-by-8-foot original oil_painting of one of Eugene Savage ' s Art Deco Matson menu covers depicting Hawaiians welcoming Captain James Cook at Kealakekua Bay on the Big Island . The free Kodak Hula Show , held Tuesday through Thursday mornings in Kapiolani Park , has been a tourist attraction since the 1930s . While it has evolved over the years ( adding Tahitian dancers in neon-colored grass_skirts ) , the house orchestra remains endearing : 14 musician tutu ( grandmothers ) in long muumuus and sun hats perform throughout the free , hour-long photo opportunity . The Waikiki 3 theater , built_in 1936 , is one of a_few remaining Art Deco buildings in Waikiki . I ' ve seen old photos from the 1940s showing sailors hanging_around the entrance , which is much the same today and best seen from the balconies of the Royal Hawaiian Shopping_Mall across Kalakaua Avenue . Unfortunately the interior , once the swankiest on the islands , has been stripped of its papier-mache palm_trees . They still show movies here , but gone are the usherettes dressed as alii ( royalty ) . Having collected Hawaiiana for years at Southern California flea_markets , I wondered what vintage souvenirs could be found in situ . I ' d heard about the aloha shirts at Bailey ' s but was a little disappointed with the shop . Sure , plenty of shirts , but there were too many ( I never thought such a thing possible ) , too jammed together . And the prices seemed more keyed to Tokyo buyers than habitues of the Rose Bowl swap meet . I was much more tempted by two other shops . At Antique Alley , a collectibles mini-mall , several of the dealers sell Hawaiian items ( though none exclusively ) : artifacts , old coins and Ming ' s jewelry -- tropical-themed earrings and brooches popular during the ' 40s and ' 50s . Pake Zane has the most : old menus , photos , postcards , hula-girl lamps and the insider knowledge of someone who lived through the time_period . At Clair de Lune , a swank shop with haute- ' 30s and ' 40s sensibilities , the rattan furniture , gaudy hibiscus draperies and tropical paintings have been chosen with great_care . I wanted it all . I would never have known about the Waioli Tea Room had I not loudly bemoaned my 40-years-too-late fate to Zane . He joined in my lament , but agreed there were a_few survivors from the Golden Age . Did I know about the Waioli , which reopened last year after being closed five years ? He promised it was a haven from the Waikiki tinsel that few mainlanders know exists . But , he said , occasional tourists have been making their way there since the 1920s , when the tea room was opened by the Salvation_Army to train unwed mothers in waitressing . Set amid the lush landscape of the Manoa Valley , a_few miles north of Waikiki , the last remaining old-style Hawaiian restaurant still offers job opportunities to those needing new skills . Meals ( curries , salads , sandwiches , pasta ) are served on the broad , cool , wrap-around porch . Robert Louis Stevenson was said to have visited Hawaiian royalty at a hut behind the building ; all were in search of cooler weather . Even today , the place is usually 15 degrees cooler than the coastal_plain below . During lunch , a mother-and-son duo dressed in matching Hawaiian ensembles moves from table to table playing requests , all pre-Don Ho classics . Mom sings and plays the ukulele while her courtly son plays bass . As I was leaving , another diner asked when the duo would be returning to the dining_area . The answer : in a_few minutes -- they were busy playing for the help in the kitchen . I ' ll bet they don ' t do that at the Hyatt Regency .
