   <HEADLINE> LAPD REORGANIZING HANDLING OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : CHIEF SAYS STEPS BEGAN BEFORE DISCLOSURE OF SWEEPING INVESTIGATION AT WEST LOS ANGELES STATION . NEW UNIT MAY BE FORMED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Los Angeles Police_Department , aggressively trying to demonstrate resolve on the issue of sexual_harassment , is reorganizing its system for handling harassment complaints and may launch a department-wide audit to determine the full extent of the problem , LAPD leaders said Tuesday . In the coming weeks , Police_Chief Willie L . Williams said he intends to propose creating a specialized group to handle sexual_harassment issues as well as other complaints of bias or discrimination . LAPD critics have long complained that female officers feel uncomfortable reporting harassment to Internal Affairs or through other department channels , partly because they fear retaliation . &quot; There are a lot of things that we have already started , &quot; said Williams , who emphasized that the reorganization was under way before news_reports last week disclosing the existence of a massive LAPD inquiry into allegations of sexual_harassment at the West Los Angeles police_station . &quot; To change people ' s views , to change people ' s actions . . . takes more_than six months or a year. &quot; Police Commission President Gary Greenebaum applauded Williams ' efforts to combat sexual_harassment , crediting the chief with authorizing the audit of the West Los Angeles station and with aggressively attempting to reform the department ' s handling of handling harassment complaints . &quot; The most important aspect of this is what is done from the top , &quot; Greenebaum said . &quot; There is no better way for him to signal that change is in the offing . Change is here ; it ' s happening now. &quot; Although Williams did not comment in detail about the West Los Angeles inquiry , he told members of the Police Commission that the department is &quot; very concerned about backlash &quot; against employees who cooperated in that inquiry . Williams said he advised senior LAPD officers last week when he learned that news_reports were about to disclose details of the inquiry . Those officers raised the issue at roll_calls in West Los Angeles , Williams added , in_order to inform officers that their rights will be protected . The West Los Angeles audit , which is nearly complete , involved interviews with more_than 100 police_officers . Sources say it found a number of instances of sexual_harassment at the station and concluded that the environment there had become uncomfortable for many female officers . Despite their protestations of innocence , two veteran police_officers have been transferred out of West Los Angeles . Administrative action against them and other officers who either harassed women or tolerated harassment by others is being considered , according to LAPD sources . The chief ' s comments Tuesday came as leaders of several organizations called_on the Police_Department to reform its handling of sexual_harassment allegations . Carol Sobel , a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union , said she has six clients who either have filed lawsuits or are preparing to press legal_action against the department on sexual harassment-related grounds . She said the department ' s historically slow response to such allegations &quot; sends_out the wrong type of message -- that if you drag these out long enough , you can get_away with it. &quot; Sobel said complaints of sexual_harassment abound within the LAPD . Female officers at the West Los Angeles station have filed a number of complaints in recent times , as have officers in other divisions , she said . Although Sobel credited Williams with moving the department in the right direction on sexual_harassment , she warned that simply creating a unit to investigate complaints will not solve the problem . She said that if the unit is made_up of officers from Internal Affairs , some women may_not trust it , and added that any unit must be equipped with a timetable for investigating and resolving disputes so that they do not linger unresolved for months . Penny Harrington , a leader of the Women ' s Advisory Council to the Police Commission , commended the LAPD for its inquiry at the West Los Angeles station and for its efforts to prevent officers who cooperated with that inquiry from being punished . But she said harassment remains widespread , and she urged the LAPD to expand its internal inquiry to include all 18 divisions . &quot; We would hope that this would continue , &quot; she said . Williams would not commit to a timetable for launching such an inquiry , but said after the meeting that &quot; we will be moving forward in that direction. &quot; Greenebaum stopped short of endorsing a departmentwide audit , but said he would support new training techniques to drive_home the need for special care on the issue of sexual_harassment . &quot; As the department prepares to absorb large_numbers of female officers , we have to make a commitment to the right kind of working environment , &quot; he said . &quot; We need to do the training of everyone so that these problems no longer exist. &quot;</TEXT>
