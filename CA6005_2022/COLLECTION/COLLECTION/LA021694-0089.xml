   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : VENTURA ; PANEL TO CONSIDER OKING MARINE STUDY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The California Coastal Commission will consider Thursday whether to approve a three-year study on the state of the marine environment off the coast of Ventura and Los Angeles counties and the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary . The $ 600 # 000 study would be funded by Chevron Corp . and its Point Arguello corporate partners in compliance with a condition of approval for a 1993 permit to ship oil by tanker . The study would be done under the auspices of the UCLA environmental_science and engineering department . &quot; This will be the first systematic and comprehensive study of our coastline , &quot; said Richard Ambrose , a UCLA associate_professor of environmental_science and engineering . Ambrose said with the study , scientists and others will know which areas in the region are particularly vulnerable to damage from an oil spill . Chevron ' s shipping permit was recently suspended after the company failed to meet a Feb . 1 deadline to have established an agreement with an overland pipeline_company . In related matters , the commission will also be asked to approve the annual discharge of about 49 # 000 barrels of drilling_muds and about 29 # 000 barrels of drill cuttings_off Chevron ' s Platform Gail , situated about 11 miles southwest of Ventura . The oil platform , which was built_in 1987 , produces about 4 # 500 barrels of oil and 20 # 000 cubic_feet of natural_gas every day . Chevron ' s discharge plan , which also includes other industrial fluids in addition to sanitary and domestic wastes , has already been approved by the federal Environmental Protection Agency . Commission staff_members have also recommended approval for the discharge plan , arguing that it produces a smaller threat to the environment than shipping the wastes off the platform on barges or other forms of surface transportation . Both items will be before the commission during its meeting Thursday in San Diego . J.E. MITCHELL</TEXT>
