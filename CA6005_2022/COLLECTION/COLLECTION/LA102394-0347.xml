   <HEADLINE> BRITAIN ' S MAJOR HAILS N . IRELAND PEACE MOMENTUM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The search for lasting peace in Northern_Ireland has taken a &quot; quantum leap forward , &quot; British Prime_Minister John Major declared Saturday , a day after announcing that his government is ready to open talks with the IRA ' s political arm . &quot; I think there is now a momentum that will carry ( the peace process ) further , &quot; Major said , adding that he is &quot; very encouraged &quot; by the reception his proposals have gotten from Protestant and Catholic officials and the public . Those proposals include opening border crossings with the Republic_of_Ireland ; allowing leaders of Sinn Fein , the political wing of the_Irish Republican Army , to travel freely in Britain , and recognizing the cease-fire being observed by Catholic and Protestant paramilitaries in the province . Also Saturday , in the Republic_of_Ireland , police raided bases of suspected terrorists -- including IRA dissidents -- and arrested several people . &quot; This is a warning shot across the bows of anyone tempted to turn_back to terrorism , &quot; a senior security source said , according to the_Irish news_agency Ireland International . After his announcement Friday , Major made a surprising symbolic gesture by dining at a Belfast restaurant with Patrick Mayhew , Britain ' s Northern_Ireland secretary , and Mayhew ' s wife . He then spent the night at Hillsborough Castle -- the first prime_minister to do so since the sectarian violence began 25 years ago . On Saturday , Major visited the unionist city of Lisburn and met Britain ' s army commander and its police_chief in Northern_Ireland to discuss ways to get paramilitaries to turn_in weapons and explosives .</TEXT>
