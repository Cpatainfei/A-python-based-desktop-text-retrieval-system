   <HEADLINE> $ 50 MILLION IN SCHOOL FUNDS THREATENED BY PROP . 187 ; EDUCATION : OFFICIALS SAY THE COUNTY COULD LOSE STATE AND FEDERAL MONEY AND BE BURDENED WITH $ 6.5 MILLION IN NEW COSTS . BUT BACKERS SAY MEASURE WOULD GENERATE HUGE SAVINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura County schools stand to lose nearly $ 50 million in state and federal money if voters approve a November ballot measure that would deny public education to illegal immigrants , school officials said . Proposition 187 would also force local districts to spend an estimated $ 6.5 million on new administrative duties : verifying the immigration status of children and their parents and holding hearings for students suspected of being in the United States illegally , officials said . &quot; What may have started_out as a way to stop illegal immigration ends_up as_a_whole other massive bureaucracy , &quot; said Charles Weis , Ventura County superintendent of schools . But local backers of Proposition 187 argue that overall savings from excluding illegal immigrant students would far outweigh the costs of implementing the measure . Besides , supporters say , concerns about the ballot measure ' s financial impact ultimately miss the point . &quot; The issue has nothing to do with money to schools , with money to health or money to welfare , &quot; said Steve Frank , coordinator for the county ' s Proposition 187 campaign . &quot; We can talk numbers . We can go_over numbers . The bottom_line is not numbers . It ' s whether or not you give a benefit to those who knowingly break the law. &quot; Proposition 187 would bar illegal immigrants from public schooling , non-emergency health_care and other social_services in California . Federal education officials say the measure violates federal privacy laws by requiring teachers and other school officials to verify the immigration status of students . In fact , U.S. Education_Secretary Richard W . Riley has threatened to withhold federal funds from state school districts , including $ 26 million to Ventura County schools , if the ballot measure passes . Federal money helps pay_for free lunches for poor children , bilingual education for students who cannot speak English and special_education for the disabled . While some students who benefit from these programs are illegal immigrants , many are not , Weis said . &quot; that ' s the sad thing about it . There ' s no relation between the kids who have these needs and the issue of immigration. &quot; Besides stripping local school districts of federal funds , Proposition 187 would also probably lead to the loss of millions of dollars in state money . The state pays districts based on their quantity of pupils , so state money to districts would decline for each illegal immigrant student forced_out of school . State education officials estimate that 6 % of California ' s students are illegal immigrants . Applying the 6 % figure to Ventura County , which state officials said is a fair estimate , 7 # 140 of the county ' s 119 # 000 students are in the United States illegally . At $ 3 # 200 per pupil , county schools would stand to lose roughly $ 22.8 million in state money . Fewer students should translate into lower costs , with districts able to hire a smaller cadre of teachers and spend less on supplies . But some school districts would lose too few children to allow them to lay off teachers or otherwise cut costs enough to make_up for the state funding cut , officials in Sacramento said . &quot; If you lose one third-grader you can ' t save anything , &quot; said Jim Wilson , financial policy director for the state_Department of Education . Not only would Proposition 187 cause districts to lose funding , it would force them to spend money checking the immigration status of students and parents , as well as holding hearings for suspected illegal immigrant children . Under the proposed law , school officials would initially have to check every student ' s immigration status and then conduct checks on all new children enrolling in the district . Just verifying the status of students and parents -- by checking birth_certificates or other documents -- will cost roughly $ 25 per pupil , state officials estimate . Holding a hearing for each suspected illegal immigrant student would cost an additional $ 500 , officials said . &quot; Certainly no district has extra money rolling_around for these things . But these are unavoidable costs &quot; under Proposition 187 , said Wilson of the Education_Department . But Steve Frank disputed school officials ' dim view of the initiative ' s financial impact . He scoffed at the federal_government ' s threat to withhold funds . &quot; There will not be a cut , &quot; he said . &quot; Bill_Clinton is not going_to cut money to California . . . . He wants to win the election. &quot; And he said voters must look_at the bigger picture when considering the projected costs of implementing 187 . By forcing California ' s estimated 300 # 000 illegal immigrant students out of school , the state would save at least $ 9.6 billion annually . &quot; It gets_down to the fact that there will be more money for education for those who are legally here and those who abide_by the law , &quot; Frank said . &quot; This works_out as a major plus. &quot; But school officials say any money saved by Proposition 187 would come_to local schools only if the state decided to boost its per-student spending . And considering the state ' s tightfisted stance toward education in recent years , that possibility is &quot; not likely , &quot; Conejo Valley schools trustee Mildred Lynch said . In the past , Lynch has sided with conservative residents on some school issues , including her battle against the California Learning Assessment System , or CLAS tests , and her support of last year ' s school voucher initiative . But she is parting ways with conservatives who support Proposition 187 . &quot; I personally would not have any part of turning children away from schools or turning teachers into INS agents , &quot; she said . &quot; The argument is foolish to say we would get all this money if we turn children away from schools , &quot; Lynch added . &quot; You still only get money for children that attend. &quot;</TEXT>
