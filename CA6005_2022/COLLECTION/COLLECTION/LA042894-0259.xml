   <HEADLINE> RICHARD NIXON : 1913-1994 ; EXCERPTS : ' HE STOOD ON PINNACLES THAT DISSOLVED INTO PRECIPICE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Rev . Billy Graham The great king of ancient Israel , David , said on the death of Saul who had been a bitter enemy , &quot; Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel ? &quot; Today we remember that , with the death of Richard Nixon , a great man has fallen . We ' ve heard that the world has lost a great citizen and America has lost a great statesman , and those of us that knew him have lost a personal friend . You know , few events touch the heart of every American as profoundly as the death of a President . For the President is our leader , and every American feels he knows him in a very special way , because he hears his voice so often , sees him on television , reads about him in the press . And so we all mourn his loss and feel that our world is a bit lonelier without him . But to you who were close to him , this grief is an added pain , because you wept when he wept and you laughed when he laughed . . . . Since 1990 , he had had a brilliant young cardiologist as his doctor by the name of Jeffrey Borer . And last Tuesday , the day after the President suffered his stroke , the doctor came_by the New York hospital to examine him . He was partially paralyzed and could not speak , but he was still alert . And as the doctor talked , the President reached_out and grabbed his arm with an unusual strength . Then as the doctor turned_to leave , something made him turn_around and look_back to the bed where Richard Nixon was laying . At just at that moment , the President waved and gave his trademark thumbs-up signal and smiled . That took determination , which he had and we ' ve heard about already today . It was an example of fighting on and never giving_up that Jeffrey Borer will never forget . Now , President Nixon ' s great voice , his warm , intelligent eyes , his generous smile are missed as we gather here again just 10 months after we were here when his beloved Pat went_to heaven . A few months ago , he was asked_in a television interview , &quot; How would you like to be remembered ? &quot; He thought a moment , and then he replied , &quot; I ' d like to be remembered as one who made a difference. &quot; And he did make a difference in our world . . . . No one could ever understand Richard Nixon unless they understood the family from which he came , the Quaker church that he attended , Whittier College where he studied , and the land and the people in this area where you are sitting today . . . . But there is still another side to him that was his strong and growing faith in God . He never wore his religious faith on his sleeves , but was rather reticent to speak about it in public . He could have had more reasons than most for not attending church while he occupied the White_House when there were so many demonstrations and threats going_on , but he wanted to set an example , and he decided to have services most Sundays in the White_House -- a small congregation , a clergyman from various denominations . And I remember before one of the first services that President Nixon had at the White_House , Ruth and I and two of our friends were in the private quarters with him . I ' ll never forget the President sitting_down on the spur of the moment at an old , battered Steinway that they had there , playing the old hymn , &quot; He will hold me fast , for my Savior loves me so . He will hold me fast. &quot; . . . And so we say_farewell to Richard Nixon today with hope in our hearts , for our hope is in the eternal promises of Almighty God . . . . There is hope beyond the grave , because Jesus_Christ has opened the door to heaven for us by his death and resurrection . Richard Nixon had that hope , and today that can be our hope as well . And to the children and the grandchildren , I would say to you , you have that hope within your hearts . I had the privilege of knowing them when they were little_girls , and I ' ve seen them as they ' ve come_to know Christ and to know God in their lives . And we look_forward to seeing Dick and Pat some day in the future again . Henry A . Kissinger During the final week of Richard Nixon ' s life , I often imagined how he would have reacted to the tide of concern , respect , admiration and affection evoked by his last great battle . His gruff pose of never paying_attention to media comment would have been contradicted by a warm glow and the ever-so-subtle hint that another recital of the commentary would not be unwelcome . And without quite saying so , he would have conveyed that it would mean a lot to him if Julie and Tricia , David and Ed were told of his friends ' pride in this culmination to an astonishing life . When I learned the final news , by then so expected yet so hard to accept , I felt a profound void . In the words of Shakespeare : &quot; He was man . Take him , for all_in all , I shall not look_upon his like again. &quot; In the conduct of foreign_policy , Richard Nixon was one of the seminal presidents . He came_into office when the forces of history were moving America from a position of dominance to one of leadership . Dominance reflects strength ; leadership must be earned . And Richard Nixon earned that leadership role for his country with courage , dedication and skill . When Richard Nixon took his oath of office , 550 # 000 Americans were engaged in combat in a place as far away from the United States as it was possible to be . America had no contact with China , the world ' s most populous nation , no negotiations with the Soviet_Union , the other nuclear superpower . Most Muslim countries had broken diplomatic relations with the United States , and Middle_East diplomacy was stalemated . All of this in the midst of the most anguishing domestic crisis since the Civil War . When Richard Nixon left_office , an agreement to end the war in Vietnam had been concluded , and the main_lines of all subsequent policy were established -- permanent dialogue with China ; readiness without illusion to ease tension with the Soviet_Union ; a peace process in the Middle_East ; the beginning , via the European Security Conference , of establishing human_rights as an international issue , weakening Soviet hold_on Eastern Europe . Richard Nixon ' s foreign_policy goals were long-range , and he pursued them without regard_to domestic political consequences . When he considered our nation ' s interest at stake , he dared confrontations despite the imminence of elections and also in the midst of the worst crisis of his life . And he bore , if with some pain , the disapproval of longtime friends and allies over relaxing tensions with China and the Soviet_Union . He drew strength from a conviction he often expressed to me : &quot; The price for doing things halfway is no less than for doing_it completely , so we might as well do them properly. &quot; Thus Richard Nixon ' s greatest accomplishment was as much moral as it was political : to lead from strength at a moment of apparent weakness , to husband a nation ' s resilience and thus to lay the basis for victory in the Cold_War . . . . So let us now say goodby to our gallant friend . He stood on pinnacles that dissolved into precipice . He achieved greatly , and he suffered deeply , but he never gave_up . In his solitude , he envisaged a new international order that would reduce lingering enmities , strengthen historic friendships , and give new hope to mankind -- a vision where dreams and possibilities conjoined . Richard Nixon ended a war , and advanced the vision of peace of his Quaker youth . He was devoted to his family . He loved his country . And he considered service his honor . It was a privilege to have been allowed to help him . Sen . Bob Dole I believe the second_half of the 20th Century will be known as the age of Nixon . Why was he the most durable public figure of our time ? Not because he gave the most eloquent speeches , but because he provided the most effective leadership . Not because he won every battle , but because he always embodied the deepest feelings of the people he led . One of his biographers said that Richard Nixon was &quot; one of us. &quot; And so he was . He was a boy who heard the train whistle in the night and dreamed of all_the distant places that lay at the end of the track . How American . He was the grocer ' s son who got_ahead by working harder and longer than everyone else . How American . He was a student who met expenses by doing research at the law library for 35 cents an hour while sharing a run-down farmhouse without water or electricity . How American . He was the husband and father who said that the best memorial to his wife was her children . How American . To tens of millions of his countrymen , Richard Nixon was an American hero , a hero who shared and honored their belief in working hard , worshiping God , loving their families and saluting the flag . He called them the Silent Majority . Like them , they valued accomplishment more_than ideology . They wanted their government to do the decent thing , but not to bankrupt them in the process . They wanted his protection in a dangerous world , but they also wanted creative statesmanship in achieving a genuine peace with honor . These were the people from whom he had come and who have come_to Yorba Linda these past few days by the tens of thousands , no longer silent in their grief . The American people love a fighter , and in Dick Nixon they found a gallant one . In her marvelous biography of her mother , Julie recalls an occasion where Pat Nixon expressed amazement at her husband ' s ability to persevere in the face of criticism -- to which the President replied , &quot; I just get_up every morning to confound my enemies. &quot; It was what Richard Nixon did after he got_up every morning that not just confounded his enemies , but turned them into admirers . . . . Today our grief is shared by millions of people the world over , but it is also mingled with intense pride in a great patriot who never gave_up and who never gave_in . To know the secret of Richard Nixon ' s relationship with the American people , you need only to listen to his own words . &quot; You must never be satisfied with success , &quot; he told us , &quot; and you should never be discouraged by failure . Failure can be sad , but the greatest sadness is not to try and fail , but to fail to try . In the end what matters is that you have always lived life to the hilt. &quot; Strong , brave , unafraid of controversy , unyielding in his convictions , living every day of his life to the hilt , the largest figure of our time whose influence will be timeless -- that was Richard Nixon . How American . . . . President Clinton President Nixon opened his memoirs with a simple sentence : I was born in a house my father built . Today we can look_back at this little house and still imagine a young boy sitting_by the window of the attic he shared with his three brothers , looking_out to a world he could then , himself , only imagine . From those humble roots , as from so many humble beginnings in this country , grew the force of a driving dream , a dream that led to the remarkable journey that ends here today where it all began -- beside the same tiny home mail-ordered from back East , near this towering oak_tree which back then was a mere seedling . President Nixon ' s journey across the American landscape mirrored that of his entire nation in this remarkable century . His life was bound up with the striving of our whole people , with our crises and our triumphs . When he became President , he took_on challenges here at_home on matters from cancer research to environmental protection , putting the power of the federal_government where Republicans and Democrats had neglected to put it in the past , in foreign_policy . He came_to the presidency at a time in our history when Americans were tempted to say we had had enough of the world . Instead , he knew we had to reach_out to old friends and old enemies alike . He would not allow America to quit the world . Remarkably , he wrote nine of his 10 books after he left the presidency , working his way back into the arena he so loved by writing and thinking and engaging us in his dialogue for the past year . Even in the final weeks of his life , he gave me his wise counsel , especially with_regard_to Russia . One thing in particular left a profound impression on me . Though this man was in his ninth decade , he had an incredibly sharp and vigorous and rigorous mind . As a public man , he always seemed to believe the greatest sin was remaining passive in the face of challenges , and he never stopped living_by that creed . He gave of himself with intelligence and energy and devotion to duty , and his entire country owes him a debt of gratitude for that service . Oh , yes , he knew great controversy amid defeat as well as victory . He made mistakes , and they , like his accomplishments , are part of his life and record . But the enduring lesson of Richard Nixon is that he never gave_up being part of the action and passion of his times . He said many times that unless a person has a goal , a new mountain to climb , his spirit will die . Well , based on our last phone conversation and the letter he wrote me just a month ago , I can say that his spirit was very much alive to the very end . . . . Today is a day for his family , his friends and his nation to remember President Nixon ' s life in totality . To them let us say : May the day of judging President Nixon on anything less than his entire life and career come_to a close . May we heed his call to maintain the will and the wisdom to build_on America ' s greatest gift , its freedom , to lead a world full of difficulty to the just and lasting peace he dreamed of . As it is written in the words of a hymn I heard in my church last Sunday , &quot; Grant that I may realize that the trifling of life creates differences , but that in the higher things , we are all one. &quot; In the twilight of his life , President Nixon knew that lesson well . It is , I feel certain , a faith he would want us all to keep . . . . Gov . Pete Wilson . . . I was one of the many young_men and women in whom he ( Nixon ) inspired the same fierce loyalty that he gave to us . From the first , I was struck by the quality of his personal generosity . When we met in 1962 , he ' d already debated Khrushchev and President Kennedy , he ' d already run_for President . He ' d been a major political figure on the world stage . But still he had time to talk to and to help an eager young advance man who could offer him little but energy and enthusiasm . Then , in the fall of 1965 , when I was 32 , he honored me by asking me to come_to work with him on his potential bid for the presidency in 1968 . But he ' d heard from Bob Finch and Herb Klein that I was thinking_about running_for office myself . I told him it was true , and he grinned . He grinned and he said , in that deep , rich voice of his , &quot; Is it a good district ? Can you win ? &quot; And then he said , &quot; Because if you can , then , Pete , you ' ve got_to try or you ' ll never forgive yourself. &quot; I was just another young lawyer trying to find his way in the world , and he was a former vice_president preparing a bid for the highest office in the land . And yet , that day he was as concerned with my future as he was with his own . Time and again -- not just with me , but with many others -- he was always there , willing to share his insight and his experience , and no American in this century had more of either to share . It ' s hard to imagine a world without Richard Nixon . For half a century , he played a leading role in shaping the events that have shaped our lives . It ' s not just that he served for three decades in high office , it ' s not just that he garnered more votes than any candidate in American history . It was because his intellect , his insight and his indomitable will could not be ignored . He moved_on the world stage . He voiced bold ideas , and he left global footprints . But for all his world grasp and mastery of global strategy , it was right here in this small house , in this little town in Orange County , that Richard Nixon learned and never forgot the values that shaped him and helped him shape our world . He learned the value of hard work . He learned that to make important change , you must take risks . And he learned the Quaker virtue that , if you were born with a good mind and good_health , you were obliged to help others , to give_back to your community . But he had something more , much more . When most people think_of Richard Nixon , they think_of his towering intellect , the incisive quality of his mind . I will always remember him for another quality . It ' s the quality that great fighters have . They call it heart . Heart is what let Richard Nixon climb back into the ring time and again when almost anyone else would have thrown_in_the_towel . It was his heart that taught us the great lesson of Richard Nixon ' s life to never , ever give_up . To him , it was no disgrace to fight and be beaten . The only disgrace was to quit . And he never did . . . . Dick Nixon ' s heart , shaped by the grit and mores of this small_town , never left California , and now we return it to the soil that bred him . He ended his own eulogy to Everett Dirksen with a favorite quotation from the poet Sophocles : &quot; One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been. &quot; In Richard Nixon ' s evening , his light burned bright with hope and wise prescriptions for America and for the world . Today , as we take him to rest , as we seek to measure the greatness of the man and his legacy , it is clear how truly splendid Richard Nixon ' s day has been .</TEXT>
