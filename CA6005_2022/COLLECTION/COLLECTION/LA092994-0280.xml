   <HEADLINE> STUDENTS GET A JAPANESE EDUCATION AT 2 PALOS VERDES SCHOOLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At two Palos Verdes Peninsula schools , each day begins with a bow to the teacher and ends with the students cleaning the classroom as part of a strict disciplinary code . In between , every student learns to play the flute , do calligraphy and work_out on the bars as part of the required gymnastics program . And it is all taught in Japanese . The privately owned schools teach children of Japanese executives based in the South Bay . Kokusai Gakuen , also known as International Bilingual School , was started in Torrance in 1979 , moved to Hermosa Beach and then settled_on the campus of the former Malaga Cove School in Palos Verdes Estates in August , 1992 . Nishiyamato Academy of California opened at the former Dapplegray School in Rolling Hills Estates in April , 1992 . The curriculum of both schools , mandated by the Japanese government , matches that of all elementary and junior_high_schools in Japan . Students learn Japanese language , literature , history , politics , geography , culture , home_economics for the girls , music and art . The Japanese government provides textbooks . Ninety government-sponsored and 20 privately operated Japanese schools are located throughout the world , wherever Japanese companies are concentrated . &quot; So far at our school , we have had more_than 1 # 500 students enrolled who have returned to Japan , &quot; said Kokusai Gakuen founder Tadao Hara . &quot; The majority of Japanese businessmen are assigned here three to five years , then return to their homes. &quot; Hara said he started the school because Japanese children educated in the United States did not do_well academically when they returned to Japan . As a consequence , many parents left their children in Japan when they were stationed in America . In American schools , the students might learn English and experience American culture , but they did not learn the subjects they needed to pass the rigorous exams to get_into Japanese high_schools and universities . Japanese schools outside Japan help prepare students for these exams . Each class at Kokusai Gakuen has a maximum of 15 students , and school is in session 210 days a year , compared to 180 days at American schools . The school charges $ 405 to $ 470 a month in tuition . &quot; Everything is just like it is in school in Japan except we learn English and learn about American culture , &quot; said Sho Toyoda , 14 , a ninth-grader , who has been at the school two years . His father is an executive with Toyota . All ninth graders at Hara ' s school take a trip to the East Coast as part of the school ' s program for students to get_to know the United States . &quot; They go_to a Broadway play , visit historic sites in Boston , Philadelphia , New York and Washington , D.C. , visit the Japanese Embassy , Congress and the White_House , &quot; Hara said . The first year , his school had 48 students . By 1989 there were 269 students attending classes . &quot; Then the bubble burst . Both Japan and America have been suffering economically ever since , &quot; he said . Enrollment this year is down to 175 students in grades one through nine . In 1989 , 693 Japanese companies were located in Southern California . Now there are 615 . The number of Japanese expatriate managers and executives has dropped from a high of 3 # 800 to 3 # 400 , said Sadao ( Bill ) Kita , executive_director of the Japan Business Assn . of Southern California . Hara said to boost enrollment , he is working with high_schools in Japan to bring 30 to 40 students to the school from Japan to spend a semester . &quot; This would expose them to American culture and the_English language . Students would live with American families in the South Bay area , &quot; Hara said . Despite the decline in the number of Japanese companies and Japanese executives in this area in the past four years , Japanese politician Kyotaro Tanose decided to open an overseas campus of his Nishiyamato Academy , which is located in Nara , Japan . Tanose is a member of the Diet , Japan ' s parliament . &quot; We believe there are enough Japanese families in this area knowing the Nishiyamato Academy reputation that will send their children to our school even during this period of economic decline , &quot; said Hideki Shindo , 28 , vice principal of Nishiyamato ' s campus in Rolling Hills Estates . Nishiyamato Academy of California started last year with 38 students in grades six through eight . Now it has 71 students enrolled in fifth through ninth grades . The monthly tuition is $ 630 .</TEXT>
