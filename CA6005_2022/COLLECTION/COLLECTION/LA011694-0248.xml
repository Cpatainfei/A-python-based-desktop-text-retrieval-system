   <TEXT> Mark Bravo placed the collect_call to his wife from Tehachapi state_prison the day after Christmas . It had been three years since he had been found guilty of raping a mental patient at the Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk . And five more years of his sentence stretched_out before him . He had sworn to all who would listen that he was innocent , that his alibi had been absolutely solid . The jury had believed otherwise at the end of the three-week trial and had sent him to prison . But then , on the other end of the line , came the unexpected words . &quot; I ' ve got good news , &quot; said Roseanne , his wife . &quot; You ' re coming home. &quot; Bravo was stunned . After all_the appeals had failed , all_the way to the state Supreme Court , he had almost given_up hope that something could change the course that his life had taken . The only glimmer of a remaining possibility came from the world of science . Superior_Court Judge James Bascue had ordered DNA testing two months earlier on the items that had been found at the rape scene -- a sheet , blanket and a pair of panties . DNA testing is used to create a molecular profile , in many cases allowing_for the positive identification of a person from even the smallest bits of material . Bravo and his lawyers hoped that the tests would show conclusively that he could not have committed the rape . The results came_back the day before Christmas from a laboratory in Maryland . None of the stains on the items matched the DNA profile of either Bravo or the woman who had been raped . Bascue issued an order Jan . 6 that Bravo be released immediately . The judge said Bravo did not get a fair trial , that the victim had recanted her accusation , that the scientific evidence presented at the trial was misleading and that Bravo did , indeed , have an unimpeachable alibi . By the next day , Bravo was out of prison , riding in a car with Roseanne and their 13-year old son , Gabriel , toward their La Puente home . Bravo wore jeans , a black sweat shirt and tennis_shoes . And he also carried a box of legal papers that represented what had become the focus of his life -- the fight to prove he was innocent . &quot; We got_in the car and got the hell out of there , &quot; said Bravo , 35 . &quot; We got as far away as we could. &quot; The strange case of Mark Diaz Bravo is one that stirs the emotions and incites finger-pointing from all sides . Those in his camp call his conviction a travesty , contending that the trial never should have happened and that the judicial_system failed miserably . * Bravo ' s appeals lawyer , Sylvia Paoli , contends that major mistakes were made all along the way . &quot; Everybody screwed_up , &quot; said Paoli , who practices in Tustin . &quot; There was a continual , ongoing rash of mistakes. &quot; Meanwhile , Deputy Dist . Atty . Linda Chilstrom , who prosecuted the case in 1990 , said she remains unconvinced of Bravo ' s innocence . She suggested that the DNA evidence may_not be as conclusive as Bravo ' s lawyers contend -- that the items tested may_not have come from the rape . The story of Bravo and how he went_to prison began Feb . 20 , 1990 , when he was working as a nurse at Metropolitan State Hospital . A short , heavyset woman -- a longtime patient at the institution -- approached a guard and said she had been raped sometime that afternoon . In the course of being interviewed by hospital authorities , she named several people as her attacker . One assailant she named was an employee at the hospital , a supervisor , a man named Bravo . Bravo maintains that he had an ironclad alibi . He said he left the hospital grounds at 11 a.m. as part of a second job and had not returned until after 12:30 p.m. Then he had been in meetings all afternoon , from 1 p.m. until past 3 p.m. According to Bravo , he went_home that night not knowing that anyone had been raped . * The next morning , Bravo walked into the hospital building where he worked and two Los Angeles County deputies were waiting for him . &quot; They said : ' You need to put your hands behind your back . You ' re under arrest , ' &quot; he said . &quot; They put me in handcuffs and whisked me away. &quot; Bravo was charged with the rape shortly after his arrest , beginning an ordeal that would last three years . He said he hired a lawyer by finding a name in the Yellow Pages that had a nice ring to it -- Steve Nieto . Soon after Nieto took the case , the main controversy began to develop . Nieto , whose law office is in Whittier , said that well before the trial he requested that the district_attorney ' s office perform DNA tests on items found at the crime scene . The alleged rape occurred in an alcove that patients often used for sexual trysts , hospital officials said . He said the prosecution told him they planned to do the testing . But Chilstrom said that was not true , that Nieto never mentioned a desire to have DNA testing done early in the case . &quot; The defense_lawyer never asked us to explore DNA until six months after the arraignment , &quot; Chilstrom said . &quot; Never did he indicate to us that he was interested in further testing. &quot; Chilstrom said that when Nieto asked_for DNA testing just before trial , she took it to be a delaying tactic . &quot; If DNA had been brought_up ( earlier ) , I would have had to write memos Downtown to get permission , &quot; said Chilstrom , who works_out of the West Covina branch of the district_attorney ' s office . &quot; There would be no way I could turn_down DNA without someone else in the office knowing about it. &quot; Paoli said she is not sure what happened . &quot; Someone is lying , &quot; she wrote in her appellate brief . * At the beginning , the case seemed open and shut . It was the testimony of a well-regarded supervisory nurse against that of a mental patient who had recanted the rape on at least one occasion . There were other hospital employees who could account_for Bravo ' s whereabouts during the time the rape supposedly took_place . The strongest piece of evidence the prosecution seemed to have was blood on the blanket , a blood_type found in only about 3 % of the population . Bravo has that blood_type . But Chilstrom took a tack that was not expected by the defense . She started to zero_in on Bravo and paint him as a liar . She took what in other circumstances might have seemed like little things and made them examples of how Bravo had a pattern of lying . How he had called himself a Marine corpsman to perhaps leave the impression that he had done medical work in the military , how a business_card identified him as having a master ' s in social_work when he did not even have a four-year degree . ( Paoli , Bravo ' s lawyer , acknowledged that her client had misrepresented himself on occasion , but said that had nothing do with the rape charge. ) Chilstrom presented item after item , witness after witness , and Bravo saw the tide turning against him . He was being picked_apart . &quot; As time passed , I started to get scared , &quot; he said . When the jury returned with the guilty verdict , Bravo and his wife found themselves forced to adapt to new lives . In prison , Bravo was soon taken aside by an inmate and told that rapists were looked down upon and that he needed to lie_about why he was there . &quot; I constantly worried about my safety because I didn ' t know what to expect , &quot; he said . &quot; I did a good job of distorting and lying_about what I was in there for . I had seen rapists and child_molesters beaten. &quot; At the same time , Roseanne Bravo carried_on in public as if nothing happened . The case had drawn little publicity , so she went_about her business , confiding only in two co-workers at the hospital where she is a nurse . &quot; I handled it as if he were still here , &quot; she said . &quot; I felt that if I went and told everyone at my job , they were going_to label him the way they wanted to . I did not want to be the talk_of my workplace . And I wanted to protect my child as well. &quot; After the conviction , Paoli was appointed as Bravo ' s appeals lawyer and she went_about bringing the case to higher_courts . But at each step of the way , Bravo ' s conviction was upheld . The state Supreme Court denied the appeals of the verdict and a motion to admit new evidence . As time went_by , though , several things happened . The woman who accused Bravo of rape recanted and named another man as her attacker . Although the higher_courts affirmed Bravo ' s conviction , Bascue ordered the DNA tests after it was returned to Los Angeles Superior_Court in October . * On Jan . 4 , Paoli filed a blistering brief in which she presented the case for why Bravo should be released , including the results of the DNA tests . Two days later , the judge ordered Bravo freed . For Bravo , it was a case of modern science coming_to his rescue when it was almost too late . &quot; If they had done this a long_time ago , &quot; he said , &quot; none of this would have happened. &quot; PRISONER RELEASES --</TEXT>
