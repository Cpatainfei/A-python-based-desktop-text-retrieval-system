   <HEADLINE> CLEANER AIR BEGINS HERE AT_HOME ; POLLUTION : WASHINGTON WILL BE A CATALYST FOR DEVELOPING STATE AND LOCAL SOLUTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the summer smog thickens around us , it ' s time to talk_about something that for many of us is only a dream : clean air . By clean I simply mean healthy to breathe -- air that doesn ' t leave one feeling sluggish all day , doesn ' t result in painful breathing and that perhaps even allows a view of the mountains just a_few miles away . It was public health , not a pristine image of blue_skies , that our national lawmakers had_in_mind when they wrote the Clean Air Act in 1970 and strengthened it in 1977 and 1990 . Since the passage of this law , tremendous progress has been made throughout the nation to reduce air_pollution . State and local environmental agencies in California have traditionally been national_leaders in the area of air-quality control efforts . However , despite exceptional efforts and achievements by those agencies , California ' s air quality remains the worst in the nation . Over three-quarters of all Californians are exposed to health-threatening levels of air_pollution . Under the Clean Air Act , state and local agencies are required to develop long-term plans to show how they will achieve safe , clean air by specific dates . Due_to its extraordinary problem , the Los Angeles area was given more time than any other city in the nation -- until 2010 . However , in recent years these agencies have not successfully enacted plans demonstrating how they will meet the Clean Air Act ' s standards for public health . As a result of this , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been ordered by the courts to craft federal implementation plans ( FIPs ) to ensure that someone provides an overall clean-air plan in these communities . Specifically , these court_orders affect the South Coast ( which includes Los Angeles and Orange counties ) , Sacramento and Ventura air basins . The court-ordered plans proposed by the EPA in February require contributions from nearly every source of air_pollution , including some sources that have not been involved before . Tough choices were made , and the EPA will be receiving strong reactions -- and , we hope , some constructive alternatives -- in public hearings , beginning today at AQMD headquarters in Diamond Bar , and in written comments through August . We are not here to impose any particular measure ; we want to come_up with the most environmentally and economically sound plan possible . While we plan to do our best , there are limits to what we can effectively implement . We continue to believe -- strongly -- that the best plans can be put_together only at the state and local level , where there is far more flexibility and where these decisions appropriately belong . The EPA ' s approach in developing these federal plans , therefore , is to look_for ways to support and augment state and regional clean-air planning efforts while working with the business , environmental and local_government communities to develop the FIPs as an effective backstop . Through our workshops and locally generated focus groups , we have seen unprecedented dialogue among these groups over what the most cost-effective measures might be . Ironically , this cooperative effort may overshadow the fact that the FIPs do not relieve state and local planners from their legal obligation to design and implement clean-air measures . A parallel process is occurring to produce a local plan -- with hearings scheduled in coming weeks and adoption shortly thereafter . It would be a tragedy to focus only on the federal effort and ignore the action where it counts most . The residents of each affected community , each industry group and the appropriate state and local agencies must work to make state and local plans successful . And the federal_government , while stepping_up to the plate with a proposal , must continue to be as supportive as possible of those efforts . That is ultimately how the promise of the Clean Air Act will be kept .</TEXT>
