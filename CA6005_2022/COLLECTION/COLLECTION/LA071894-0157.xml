   <HEADLINE> GORE TAPS A NERVE ON HEALTH_CARE ; EDUCATION : TEACHERS UNION CONVENTION APPLAUDS VICE_PRESIDENT ' S CALL FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE . THE HIGH COST OF INSURANCE HAS BEEN A PROMINENT ISSUE AT THE CONVENTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Vice_President Al Gore ran_through a laundry list of hot-button ' 90s issues -- family , the economy , school violence -- in a speech to the nation ' s second-largest teachers union Sunday , but he scored best with the delegates with his call_for universal health_care . Stumping for the help of the American Federation of Teachers , the vice_president told delegates : &quot; The poor in this country have many problems , but they have health_care . The wealthy in this country have health_care . Middle-class Americans in this country are at risk of losing their health care. &quot; His mention of Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole elicited a prolonged hiss from the audience . Gore told the teachers that the Kansas Republican &quot; thinks it is unfair and unsportsmanlike to point_out that every Republican senator who opposes universal health_care reform already has health_care coverage. &quot; The high price of health_care has been a prominent issue at the union convention , as delegates debate the burgeoning costs both for themselves and for their students -- many of whom lack coverage of any kind . Later this week , the union ' s 4 # 000-plus delegates will consider a resolution calling_for union backing of a health_care reform plan that would guarantee coverage for all Americans and require employers to contribute to the cost . The union leadership has already urged delegates to use boxes outside the convention hall doors to drop_off letters asking Congress to approve universal health_care . After Gore ' s speech , health_care still held the teachers ' attention . Many delegates sounded torn between their fear about what universal health_care would cost them -- union contracts already guarantee health_care for virtually all members -- and their concern for their students , many of whom cannot afford to see a doctor . &quot; Over the past 2 1 / 2 years of negotiating , I have seen the cost of health_care escalate 150 % for one of the ( insurers ) , &quot; said Maya Decker , president of the Newport Mesa Unified School District Federation of Teachers . &quot; It makes hanging_on to some kind of health_care tougher and tougher each year. &quot; It ' s also made life tougher on the students , said Monroe Morgan , a business teacher from Chicago . Today ' s teachers know that many of their students are not getting proper care in areas ranging from eyeglasses to more serious medical problems , he said . &quot; Many times I ' ve talked to parents and they say , ' We ' re going to take him to the doctor , ' &quot; he said . &quot; But , of course , they don ' t have the money or the health coverage. &quot; In his 45-minute speech , Gore spoke_of a &quot; family friendly &quot; executive order signed July 11 by President Clinton . It presses federal agencies to make the workplace more supportive of families by allowing job-sharing , flexible work schedules , telecommuting and the_like . &quot; We want to set a standard in the federal_government that can spread throughout the American workplace , a standard that keeps families together instead of driving them apart , &quot; Gore said . The vice_president also talked up his pet issue -- access to the so-called information superhighway . &quot; More_than three-quarters of our children don ' t even have an information footpath going_to the classroom , &quot; Gore said . Only 22 % of the nation ' s classrooms have telephone_lines that could link classroom computers to outside on-line services , and only 4 % have modems , Gore said . He asked teachers to support legislation that would connect every U.S. classroom by computer to a national information infrastructure by the year 2000 . The legislation , Gore said , would ensure that the &quot; students in Watts have access , not just students in Brentwood. &quot; For many of these teachers , the need for computers was not as pressing as the need for students to have good nutrition and up-to-date textbooks . &quot; Having access to information doesn ' t answer fundamental questions : Do you have enough food ? Shelter ? Housing ? &quot; said Tom Edminster , a delegate from United Education of San Francisco , echoing the sentiments of many teachers . For Bill Taxerman of United Teachers-Los Angeles , Gore ' s speech didn ' t offer much to ease the problems facing their classrooms , but the vice_president was an effective cheerleader . &quot; It was a general , feel-good speech , &quot; Taxerman said .</TEXT>
