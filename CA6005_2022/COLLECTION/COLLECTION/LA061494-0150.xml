   <HEADLINE> ACCUSED PALESTINIAN KILLER SAYS HE BLEW UP FLIGHT 103 ; TERRORISM : FOLLOWER OF ABU NIDAL STUNS COURT WITH CLAIM HE PLANTED BOMB ON PAN AM JET IN 1988 . EXPERTS ARE SKEPTICAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An accused Palestinian assassin confessed Monday to the murder of 270 people , stunning a Beirut courtroom with an unsubstantiated claim that in 1988 , he personally blew_up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland . Lebanese prosecutors said they will investigate Youssef Shaaban ' s claim but stressed that they doubted his confession . It reportedly came_after the 29-year-old follower of terrorist leader Abu Nidal denied charges that he shot and killed a Jordanian diplomat near the diplomat ' s Beirut home_in January . The Lockerbie bombing , one of the bloodiest terrorist attacks in recent years , remains a major international political issue . The American and British governments initially blamed Iran for the crime , then Syria , and finally insisted that two suspected senior Libyan intelligence_agents were behind the bombing . They persuaded the U.N. Security_Council to punish Libya with international sanctions in an attempt to force it to turn_over the two men to stand trial in the United States or Britain . On Monday , the lawyer for the two Libyan suspects -- Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah -- applauded Shaaban ' s confession in Beirut , asserting it proved his clients ' innocence . But British and American officials insisted that Libya still bears the blame for a bombing that stunned the world . American counterterrorism officials said Monday that they had never ruled_out a role by others besides the Libyans . &quot; We ' re going to follow up very hard on all leads , including this one , just to make_sure we ' ve left nothing unturned , &quot; a senior official said . * But counterterrorism experts , public and private , expressed deep suspicions . &quot; There are enough inconsistencies to make us doubt him , &quot; a senior U.S. official said . Shaaban would have been only 23 at the time of the 1988 bombing . &quot; that ' s fairly young to have put_together a complicated bomb and such a complicated operation all by himself , &quot; the official added . Also , Shaaban ' s claim does not conform with Abu Nidal ' s usual tactics . &quot; He never went_in for aviation terrorism , especially anything as sophisticated as this , &quot; said Bruce Hoffman , a terrorism specialist at the RAND Corp . American officials and terrorism specialists suggest that Shaaban ' s claim may be part of a Libyan campaign to shift the blame from the two Libyans indicted by the United States and Scotland and , in turn , to get painful international economic sanctions lifted . &quot; It ' s part of an operation . It ' s deliberately exploiting the use of someone already going_down for another crime -- in this case the assassination of a Jordanian diplomat -- to accept responsibility for something that he could not possibly have done , &quot; said Vince Cannistraro , a former CIA terrorism specialist . Relatives of the bombing victims were skeptical as well . Jim Swire -- chief spokesman and activist for families of British passengers killed when the Pan Am Boeing 747 exploded en route to New York over the Scottish village , killing all 259 people aboard and 11 more on the ground -- said Shaaban ' s assertion &quot; should be regarded with grave suspicion. &quot; &quot; It could be that he is seeking to attract what terrorists might regard_as kudos for the Abu Nidal organization , &quot; Swire said , referring to the Revolutionary Council of Fatah founded by the Palestinian activist . Shaaban ' s remarks -- which the judge ordered stricken as irrelevant to the case , according to Reuters news service -- reportedly came_after Shaaban denied gunning_down Jordan ' s second-ranking diplomat in Beirut on Jan . 29 . Shaaban ' s public trial has become the centerpiece of a Lebanese government campaign to prove that Beirut ' s decades of lawlessness are at an end . * Times staff writer Fineman reported from Nicosia , Cyprus ; special correspondent Raschka reported from Beirut .
