   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; SURVEYS REVEAL HEAVY DAMAGE TO LANDMARKS ; QUAKE : REPAIRS TO HISTORIC L.A. BUILDINGS COULD COST MORE THAN $ 30 MILLION , NOT COUNTING THE COLISEUM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Northridge earthquake damaged at least 171 officially designated landmarks and other historic or architecturally significant buildings in the city of Los Angeles , according to preliminary surveys . Repairs and seismic strengthening could cost more_than $ 30 million , not including massive work needed at the Coliseum and UCLA , the studies suggest . &quot; that ' s a fairly hefty bite , &quot; Rodney Punt , assistant general_manager of the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs , said of the surveys ' findings . Much of the harm appears cosmetic , such_as cracked plaster at the Shrine Auditorium , the 1926 Moorish-style theater on Jefferson Boulevard , and some damaged molding below dome-like astronomical murals in the 1935 Griffith Observatory in Griffith Park . Yet , 60 landmark or historic buildings will each need at least $ 100 # 000 in repairs , says the survey by the Los Angeles Conservancy , a nonprofit preservationist group . That report looked_at buildings within city_limits that were_on or eligible for city , state or federal landmark lists before the Jan . 17 temblor and now are tagged by city inspectors with yellow or red warning notices about possible structural danger . &quot; Certainly the magnitude is severe , but we are grateful that it is not worse , &quot; said Linda Dishman , conservancy executive_director . A separate assessment was provided by the city ' s Cultural Affairs Department . It found some quake damage at 122 of the 588 buildings or sites designated by the city as &quot; historic-cultural monuments. &quot; * Only two of those city-designated landmarks are red-tagged for structural danger -- the El Portal Theater in North Hollywood and the vacant Fire_Station No . 27 in Hollywood . The red tag indicates that the building is unsafe for occupancy in its present condition . Jay Oren , staff architect with the cultural affairs department , believes that both sites and most other landmarks can be saved . The El Portal on Lankershim Boulevard , a former vaudeville house and cinema built_in 1926 , was recently renovated as a live theater auditorium . With its ceiling fallen , the El Portal suffered an estimated $ 1.5 million in damage . The 64-year-old fire_station , a two-story brick building on North Cahuenga Boulevard , was once the largest firehouse west of the Mississippi . Since its 1992 closing , it was slated to become a Fire_Department museum . City inspectors initially estimated that the station needed $ 1.4 million in seismic repairs . Terry Wong , a city building engineer , said Friday that &quot; a_million is a little more_than is necessary &quot; to fix a separated wall and strengthen the station . Other heavily damaged landmarks , the conservancy report found , include the Andres Pico Adobe in Mission Hills , an 1834 house built by a Mexican general that inspectors say needs $ 500 # 000 in repairs ; the Hollywood-Western Building , a four-story Art Deco landmark built_in 1928 that for many years housed the famed Central Casting offices and now may require $ 4 million in seismic fixes , and the Egyptian Theater , the 1922 Hollywood-on-the-Nile-style movie palace that has been empty since last year and may need $ 260 # 000 in repairs_to its broken rear wall , among other damage . * The heavy losses in Santa Monica , Fillmore and other areas were not included in the surveys . Within the city of Los Angeles , two prominent landmarks were not cited because both are either wholly or partly state-owned -- Royce Hall at UCLA and the Coliseum . Royce ' s twin Romanesque towers suffered structural damage and , as a result , its auditorium cannot be used until repairs are made . The Coliseum ' s extensive damage may wind_up costing $ 35 million or more to fix . Nonprofit institutions , city-owned buildings and private homes are eligible to receive federal grants or loans for repairs ; some commercial structures might receive low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration . In addition , the National Trust for Historic Preservation and First Interstate Bank of California announced Friday a low-interest loan pool for owners of damaged historic buildings . The maximum loan amount is $ 20 # 000 and the conservancy and the Getty Conservation Institute will provide technical advice . Most experts consider the damage surveys and repair estimates to be very tentative so soon after the quake . That was the case in Northern California after the 1989 Loma Prieta temblor , said Lisbeth Henning , assistant director of the National Trust ' s regional office in San Francisco . What ' s more , it is difficult to separate quake repairs from recommended seismic strengthening . * The city-owned Watts Towers suffered only a_few new hairline cracks in January ' s shocks . &quot; None of them is what I would call overly critical , &quot; city official Punt said . Yet , the glass , concrete , steel and tile towers -- considered a triumph of folk architecture -- previously developed some base cracks that could cost $ 900 # 000 to probe and fix , he estimated . &quot; It ' s not primarily caused by the quake , but it could be aggravated by aftershocks , &quot; Punt said . &quot; We are worried about the future. &quot; Similarly , the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Hollyhock House in Barnsdall Park may require about $ 600 # 000 in work , both for general strengthening against temblors and for repairing cracked rooftop spires and weakened library walls , Punt said . Of the 171 buildings on the conservancy ' s survey , 56 were estimated to require $ 20 # 000 or less in repair .</TEXT>
