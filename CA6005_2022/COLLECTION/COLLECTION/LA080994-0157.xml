   <HEADLINE> U.N. OFFICIAL PROPOSES WEAPONS-FREE BOSNIAN CAPITAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.N. commander in Bosnia on Monday proposed removing all soldiers and heavy_weapons -- even those monitored by the United Nations -- from Sarajevo and the surrounding area . The proposal by Lt . Gen . Michael Rose appeared aimed at avoiding a repeat of Friday ' s Serbian seizure of heavy_weapons that were put_under U.N. guard after NATO demanded in February that the guns around Sarajevo be removed . The seizure provoked a NATO air strike on an archaic Serbian antitank weapon south of Sarajevo , an attack designed to show Bosnia ' s Serbs that the United Nations has the power to use force . After the air strike , the Serbs returned the weapons they had seized . Rose now apparently wants to build_on the Serbs ' new sense of isolation to get weapons out of Sarajevo and the 12.5-mile weapons exclusion zone that the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization imposed around the city . Serbia pledged Thursday to cut_off all military supplies and trade with the Bosnian Serbs because they rejected an international peace plan reducing their share of Bosnia from 70 % to 49 % and giving the rest to a Muslim-Croatian federation . Rose said Monday that Serbia ' s pledge could have &quot; catastrophic &quot; effects on the ability of the Bosnian Serbs to fight and maintain the military superiority they have enjoyed during the 28-month war . It will take two to three months for the full impact of the closure of the border with Serbia and Montenegro , the two remaining republics in Yugoslavia , to be felt , Rose said . But &quot; the ( Bosnian ) Serbs are feeling increasingly isolated , &quot; he said , reporting that their military_headquarters is now unable to call Belgrade , the Serbian capital . However , Bosnia ' s Serbs still have Sarajevo in their grip . The international airlift of aid has been shut_down for more_than two weeks following presumed Serbian fire on planes . The Serbs have also closed the only land routes into and out of the city . The aid airlift will resume today , U.N. spokesman Ron Redmond said in Geneva . It started again Friday but was halted again by the Serbian seizure of weapons . Rose said the Serbs felt justified in tightening the siege because the Bosnian army broke a cease-fire agreement with offensives elsewhere in Bosnia . He said the United Nations protested to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic about the offensives . Rose contended that both the government and Serbs would benefit from the demilitarization of the Sarajevo area , noting that 40 % of the people in the region are_on Serbian-held territory . Under the proposal , he said , both armies would withdraw from the zone , and the only local security_forces would be police with handguns . But on Monday the Bosnian Serbs raised a new obstacle to any lasting peace : Momcilo Krajisnik , speaker of the self-styled Bosnian Serb assembly , demanded 64 % of Bosnia for the Serbs . Bosnian Serbs , who constituted about one-third of Bosnia ' s population before the war and tended to live more in rural_areas , claim that is the amount of territory Serbs rightfully owned in Bosnia . Krajisnik argued that the 49 % offered by the international peace plan translated into only about 20 % of Bosnia ' s economic assets . The Serbs went_to_war after the Muslims and Croats moved to secede from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia . An estimated 200 # 000 people are dead or missing in the conflict . &quot; Serbs are for peace , but peace based on Serb ownership of 64 % of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina , and their right to self-determination according to accepted international standards , &quot; Krajisnik said . The Bosnian Serbs are to vote on the peace plan Aug . 27-28 . Also Monday , the Red_Cross confirmed that Bosnian Serbs have rounded up more_than 100 Muslim men recently and taken them to a labor camp at Lopare in northeast Bosnia . The Serbs have also expelled more_than 300 Muslim women , children and elderly men from the northeastern town of Bijeljina in the past three weeks , Peter Kessler of the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees said .</TEXT>
