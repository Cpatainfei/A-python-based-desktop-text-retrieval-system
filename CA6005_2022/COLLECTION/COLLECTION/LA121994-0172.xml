   <HEADLINE> MEXICO ' S MIGRANT POLICY CALLED A HARSHER PROP . 187 ; LATIN_AMERICA : CRITICS CHARGE CASTIGATING CALIFORNIA IS HYPOCRITICAL . GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS REVIEWING PROBLEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They call them los indocumentados . They work in boiler-room factories , sweatshops and street markets in the capital , or scrape a living in the fields of rich ranchers in the south , barely surviving on wages far below the legal minimum . They hide from immigration authorities , and many live_in fear , moving often from shanty to shanty . They are victimized by : corrupt business people ; local officials ; police ; smugglers known as &quot; coyotes &quot; who bring them over the border for a fee , and even border guards who are supposed to keep them out . And every year , Mexico quietly deports thousands of them , illegal immigrants from Guatemala , Honduras , El_Salvador and other Central_American_nations who have penetrated its porous southern border in search of a better life in the North . Sound ironic ? All too familiar , perhaps ? It is a flip side of Proposition 187 and tops the list of Mexico ' s most sensitive foreign_policy issues . Especially now . Against the backdrop of Mexico ' s torrent of criticism of the California initiative -- crowned by President Ernesto Zedillo ' s resounding condemnation a week ago at the Summit of the Americas of Proposition 187 as a violation of Mexican human_rights -- critics here have charged hypocrisy . Mexico ' s immigration laws , they say , are even stricter and their enforcement far harsher than California ' s initiative to deny public_services to undocumented immigrants . &quot; There is a double_standard here , &quot; said Luis Gonzalez Souza , a social_sciences professor at Mexico_City ' s National Autonomous University of Mexico and author of two books on U.S.-Mexican relations . &quot; We are not respecting the human_rights of these undocumented immigrants in the same way we are demanding the U.S. respect the human_rights of Mexicans . We are losing credibility , and we are losing the negotiating power to demand such rights for Mexicans in the U.S. &quot; Senior government officials concede that their strict immigration policies have left them open_to criticism and quandaries . They confirmed Friday that Zedillo has created a high-level committee to conduct a sweeping review and overhaul of Mexico ' s immigration policies and enforcement . &quot; We understand we have a problem . We accept we have a problem , and we are trying very thoroughly to solve these problems , &quot; one senior official said . But those officials also stressed that the issue goes_deeper . Many of the undocumented immigrants are merely crossing Mexico toward the U.S. border , they said , and the Mexican government actually has been forced to do the job of U.S. immigration authorities by &quot; turning the U.S. border downward. &quot; Yet even those officials acknowledged that Mexico ' s harsh immigration policy has a domestic dimension . It is based on intense competition for jobs in a nation with soaring unemployment and crushing poverty of its own : Most of the undocumented Central_Americans never make_it to the U.S. border . Others never intended to . In both cases , officials here said , migrants believe they can find a better life in Mexico than at_home . In Mexico , the immigration issue remains so sensitive that no government official would speak on the record about it . It is so sensitive that the government has declared all statistics on deportations or detentions of undocumented Central_Americans -- data on the tens or perhaps hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants -- off limits to the public . According to figures that are available , the magnitude of the illegal immigration problem pales in comparison with that in the United States . The National Institute of Migration , a quasi-official body , reported last Monday , in figures later denied as unofficial by immigration authorities , that Mexico expelled 3 # 651 undocumented immigrants , 40 % of them Guatemalan , in the first 11 months of this year ; the United States , in contrast , deported about 1 million Mexicans and others during the same period . But that number is grossly low , said the dozens of human_rights groups and non-governmental agencies that have worked for years to help undocumented migrants in Mexico . &quot; I think the Mexican authorities have been coloring the real figures because they don ' t want to expose the dimension of the issue , &quot; Gonzalez said . &quot; I ' m afraid this is one of the issues in which we have to start from the beginning in determining just how high the numbers really are. &quot; Raul Macin , whose Center for the Coordination of Ecumenical Projects has four support centers for illegal immigrants in rural Mexico , agreed . &quot; There are many undocumenteds in Mexico who theoretically don ' t exist , &quot; Macin said . &quot; There are many ways to be undocumented in Mexico , because the official policy is very ambiguous . And I think it is intentionally ambiguous . We cannot have an idea of the magnitude of the problem , but it is serious . And the flow is increasing. &quot; For example , Macin said , Mexico ' s immigration laws permit Salvadorans to obtain visas that are valid only as far north as Mexico_City . When they go north of the capital , they become illegal . Other Central_American migrants are given visas that bar them from working . If they try to earn a living , they become illegal . To further illustrate the ambiguity in the numbers , Macin cited the large population of Guatemalans in Mexico . The government estimates it at 40 # 000 , he said . But the Roman_Catholic archdiocese in the southern Mexican town of San Cristobal de las Casas , which deals with the Guatemalan community daily , puts the number at 200 # 000 . Throughout most of the 20th Century , Mexico has been a haven for immigrants and refugees . It admitted tens of thousands of Spaniards during the Spanish Civil War . Thousands of Cubans fleeing the Communist regime have established new homes and new lives here . And , until it reached saturation in the early 1980s , Mexico threw its doors wide open_to its troubled Central_American neighbors , bringing hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants fleeing the many civil_wars to the south . Most of the migrants were political refugees from repressive regimes in Guatemala , El_Salvador and Honduras . Now , Macin and other human-rights workers said , the undocumented immigrants are mostly economic refugees -- a condition all too familiar to U.S. policy-makers . &quot; I have seen such things that even I cannot believe at first , &quot; Macin said of his many visits to Mexico_City ' s Ciudad Neza , a neighborhood of crushing poverty that is known to house a large_number of illegal immigrants . &quot; I have seen in Ciudad Neza places where two or three families live_in one room , &quot; he said . &quot; And I have asked them , ' To live like this , you have left your country ? ' They say : ' Here , I have this -- a place to sleep , a roof over my head . There , we didn ' t even have this. ' It ' s not a life we would perceive as better , but for them it is . And that ' s what makes the risks of being an illegal immigrant here worth it . &quot; There is this saying I often hear when we ask them , ' What are you looking_for ? ' &quot; Macin said . &quot; They all say , ' We ' re looking_for life. ' They ' re looking_for a road to survival. &quot; But the risks along that road are profound , Macin and others said . Routinely , they said , border guards and the &quot; coyotes &quot; rob the migrants before allowing them to pass or turning them back . &quot; The biggest risk is to fall_into the hands of the authorities , who are totally and absolutely corrupt , &quot; Macin said . &quot; The corruption is from the top down . They can be arbitrarily detained and their possessions stolen . Invariably . . . everything of_value is taken . They are vulnerable , and if they don ' t have someone to help them , they can be deported. &quot; It is just such corruption that Mexico ' s new president has vowed to end . Zedillo has appointed an opposition party member as attorney_general , the office that enforces Mexican immigration laws at the border and throughout the country . And the chief prosecutor ' s principal task , Zedillo vowed , will be to root_out bad agents and create &quot; a new rule_of_law &quot; in a society plagued by corruption . In addition , besides harshly criticizing Proposition 187 in Miami , the president called_on all nations of the Americas to formulate a comprehensive , humane immigration policy to restore justice to a system overwhelmed by people and poverty . But for those most affected here , the immigration nightmare looms as large as it does for the undocumented Mexicans in California who feel threatened by Proposition 187 . Mercedes Ramirez knows . She is secretary_general of the 19th of September Seamstress Union , named for the date of the 1985 earthquake that racked Mexico_City and crushed 3 # 000 seamstresses to death in illegal sweatshops throughout the capital . Ramirez tried several times to arrange interviews with undocumented immigrants . They never showed_up . &quot; There is a lot of fear , &quot; she said . &quot; Their lives are synonymous with fear . Usually a long_time passes before someone like this will tell you where they ' re from , even after you get_to know them very well . They ' re just afraid of everyone. &quot; Consider the two Guatemalan migrants her union discovered living as prisoners in a sweatshop . &quot; They had no papers allowing them to work , so the padron ( owner ) of the factory told them : ' You can work here , but you can never leave . They ' ll catch you and send you back to Guatemala , ' &quot; she recalled . In another case , Ramirez said she learned only after years of dealing with him that one of her contacts in the Mexican Labor Ministry was an illegal . One day , she said , he finally admitted he was from Guatemala , illegally in Mexico , but had managed to get his job by buying falsified immigration papers . &quot; Here in Mexico , &quot; she said , &quot; one can get any papers one wants for a price. &quot; The dilemma for most , though , is that they cannot afford the documents . &quot; I think the majority of them do want to go_to the United States , &quot; Ramirez said . &quot; But by the time they get here , their money is gone -- stolen or spent . So they have to stay here to make some money to continue the journey . And many get stuck here for a very long_time . &quot; Those who cannot afford documents for a real job , &quot; she said , &quot; are forced to find work in the underground -- informal or illegal markets or factories . That means exploitation . That means fear . And that becomes their lives. &quot; More on Immigration * &quot; The Melding Americas , &quot; a special issue of World Report , looks_at the economic , cultural and political issues surrounding the large-scale migration of Central and South_Americans to the United States .
