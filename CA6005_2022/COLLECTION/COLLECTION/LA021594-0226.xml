   <TEXT> &quot; Be confident ! Be a virgin ! &quot; &quot; Do the right thing ! Wait for the ring ! &quot; &quot; Not on weak days ! Only on wed days ! &quot; &quot; Don ' t be a louse ! Wait for your spouse ! &quot; &quot; Pet your dog ! Not your date ! &quot; It ' s Tuesday morning and the students in Bonnie Park ' s classroom at Acacia Middle_School are chanting up a storm . But while the classroom of 12- and 13-year-olds sings the praises of abstinence , a chorus of critics of the Sex Respect sex education course is beginning to raise its voice across the country . Sex Respect argues that by remaining celibate , you won ' t need contraception . And with chastity , God is always on your side . The program , used in more_than 1 # 500 school districts nationwide , was created in 1986 as a conservative alternative to sex education . It has become a target of Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union , which call it a tool of the Christian right . And a growing number of parents in many districts have begun to agitate for a more pragmatic approach to teens and sex . Potentially as volatile as debates over creationism and abortion , the conflict is fueling lawsuits and school_board warfare from Louisiana to Riverside County . Proponents say past educational initiatives have failed to get teens to use contraceptives and have even encouraged sex . They contend that adopting a safe-sex-is-no-sex approach replaces fear with self-control and self-esteem . The 12-week course is based on a textbook written by an Illinois woman who is an anti-abortion activist and former Catholic_school educator . It focuses almost entirely on morality , warning of the dangers of promiscuity and premarital sex while extolling the virtues of sex -- but only within marriage . Discussion of the reproductive_system is limited to two pages at the end of the book . Responsibility is better than abortion and sexually transmitted disease , its proponents argue . Sex education based on maturity and not permissiveness is long overdue , they say . Critics counter that Sex Respect tests the bounds of law and science by favoring moral pleas over clinical information and spurning even the mention of contraception . &quot; The idea that teen-agers , especially young ones , be told that it ' s better not to engage in intercourse makes a great_deal of sense , &quot; said Debra Haffner , executive_director of the U.S. Sex Information and Education Council . &quot; But the problem is that Sex Respect contains many inaccuracies . It is based on a premise that young people should not make their own decisions , and it is extremely negative about sexuality . It goes beyond teaching them how to resist peer pressure and presents them with a single moral message. &quot; In Hemet , the ACLU and Planned Parenthood teamed with an outraged parent to wage battle against Park , who doubles as a teacher and school trustee . In 1989 , Park introduced the program to Acacia Middle_School , where about 900 seventh-graders each year complete the course that is taught by seven teachers . A born-again_Christian , Park said Planned Parenthood and the ACLU are &quot; on a mission to get_rid_of Sex Respect because it isn ' t politically correct . It doesn ' t promote the safe-sex agenda . . . the homosexual agenda. &quot; She calls two of her grandchildren &quot; condom babies , &quot; proving that the &quot; darn things don ' t even work half the time . How can they be counted_on to stop the spread of HIV ? &quot; Maureen Bryan , the parent who filed the complaint , calls Sex Respect &quot; a fear-based , abstinence-only curriculum that I see as utterly inappropriate because of its religious bias , its overt counseling against abortion and its perpetuation of stereotypes that don ' t belong in a public environment. &quot; In 1992 , Bryan took her adolescent son out of the program , which she said &quot; taught him he was an animal who would most likely do anything he pleased -- his biology made him that way -- and that it was up_to the female to control his behavior. &quot; Indeed , on Page 6 of the Sex Respect book , the text says that &quot; boys tend to use love to get sex . Girls tend to use sex to get love. &quot; The 1986 version of Sex Respect -- which underwent minor revisions in 1990 -- also noted that &quot; nature is making some kind of a comment on sexual behavior through the AIDS and herpes epidemics. &quot; That alone led to Sex Respect being banned in Louisiana , where a district judge called the course medically inaccurate and fraught with moral judgments . With the prevalence of AIDS and the rise in teen pregnancies , school_boards ponder not whether to teach sex education , but how . Since 1987 , 22 states have passed laws requiring some type of sex education . Sex Respect has given conservatives a vehicle to control the boundaries of the debate . But increasingly , it is being met with challenges in the courts and at the ballot_box . The attorney for the Hemet Unified School District , Karen Gilyard , recommended that Sex Respect be dropped after Bryan filed a stinging complaint . Citing a common criticism , the attorney said Sex Respect comes dangerously close to blurring the line between church and state . In her opinion , Gilyard said the course violates the state education code . The Hemet school_board , dominated by a conservative Christian majority , rejected the complaint , then hinted at getting a new lawyer . But in recent weeks , the mood has mellowed . Some board_members now favor dropping the program or having the state_attorney general review it . Such volatility is becoming more common : * In north San Diego County , the Vista Unified School District is enmeshed in a rough-and-tumble recall campaign that may result in its controversial board -- also dominated by a Christian right majority -- adopting the program over the objections of some parents and teachers . Should the board order the implementation of Sex Respect -- which would cost the district $ 30 per student more_than its current , state-sanctioned program -- a parents group has threatened to sue . * The program ' s stiffest challenge came last year in Caddo Parish , La. , where a state district judge found that portions of the course material violated Louisiana law because they contained religious_beliefs , counseled students about abortion , provided inaccurate medical information and illegally quizzed students about religious and sexual beliefs . Sex Respect later was yanked from classrooms , a ruling the school district is appealing , while legal_fees climb past $ 50 # 000 . * In East Troy , Wis. , the state_Department of Public Instruction concluded that the material perpetuated sex stereotypes but said the department lacked the authority to have the text removed . Late last year , however , East Troy school trustees voted to drop Sex Respect in favor of more comprehensive sex education . ( A school district in Sheboygan , Wis. , one of the first to use the course , dropped it in 1989 after deciding that it was biased and lacked credibility. ) * In Wilmington , N.C. , trustees voted_in 1992 to adopt a comprehensive sex education program that preaches abstinence but concedes the necessity of contraceptives . Trustees acted only after parents groups lobbied heavily for Sex Respect . * In Beaufort County , S.C. , a third of parents pulled their children from Sex Respect in 1990 and 2 # 500 parents , educators and students signed a petition condemning it . * In Enfield , Conn. , the school district started a Sex Respect pilot_program , which it rejected in 1990 after a parents group complained that it taught fear , guilt and shame . * Last August , school trustees in Modesto narrowly voted to drop Sex Respect after a five-year run . Their stand placed them at_odds with the program ' s local proponents , who fell_short in a recall campaign . * In California , the program is under review by the state_Department of Education , which is trying to determine if Sex Respect falls_short_of meeting AIDS education requirements in a new state law . The state mandates the teaching of such subjects as math and science . It does not mandate the teaching of sex education , per se . Local districts are given broad latitude in how such a subject is taught or whether it is taught . Religious bias and a lack of scientific data are among the chief criticisms leveled at Sex Respect and the author of its text , Coleen Kelly Mast . She developed the text with the help of a $ 300 # 000 grant given to the Committee on the Status of Women by the Ronald Reagan_Administration in 1986 . The committee lost federal funding a year later after settlement of a lawsuit that accused the government of using tax dollars to support programs that were more religious than educational . Mast failed to return phone_calls to her headquarters in Bradley , Ill . In a videotaped speech to Catholic educators , she said : &quot; This is not me up here . I ' m weak , a pile of dust . Really , it ' s the Holy_Spirit that reaches these kids . . . . We ' re fighting a war against sin , a war against offenses to God. &quot; She and her husband operate Respect , Inc. , a for-profit corporation that carries a line of &quot; Stop at the Lips &quot; T-shirts , &quot; I ' M WORTH WAITING FOR &quot; buttons and a Chastity Challenge home video . Her supporters include the Rev . Pat Robertson and Phyllis Schlafly ' s Eagle Forum . Opponents complain that the program is inaccurate . Bryan , the Hemet parent , said a reference in one chapter of the Sex Respect book attributes AIDS-related data to the Centers_for_Disease_Control in Atlanta &quot; unless otherwise noted. &quot; &quot; But in the chapter , &quot; Bryan said , &quot; there ' s only one reference from CDC . The others are from some_other unreliable source . My biggest beef , though , is Mrs . Park telling students in her class that French kissing can give you AIDS. &quot; In fact , the text devotes four chapters to arguing that AIDS can be spread by French kissing and says that &quot; anyone can be carrying your death warrant. &quot; A section called &quot; Sex Tips for a Safe Date &quot; commands teens to &quot; keep all_of your clothes all_the way on all_of the time . Don ' t let any part of anyone else ' s body get anywhere between you and your clothes . AVOID AROUSAL. &quot; Lloyd Kolbe , director of the division of adolescent and school health for the Centers_for_Disease_Control , said many of the messages of Sex Respect -- such_as AIDS being spread through French kissing -- &quot; are the last things young people in school need to worry about. &quot; However , there exists &quot; a remote possibility that the virus can be infected that way . But what we need to focus_on is helping young people develop the skills they ' re going to need to delay intercourse -- and if they do have_sex -- how to correctly and consistently use condoms. &quot; Forty percent of U.S. ninth-graders have had_intercourse , Kolbe said , with the figures increasing dramatically through high_school ; 70 % of all seniors have had_sex . One of eight ninth-graders has had four or more partners , while among seniors the figure leaps to one of four . &quot; It ' s ideal if kids are abstinent , but that message hasn ' t worked for the past 10 # 000 years , &quot; said Dr. Sheldon Zablow , a San Diego psychiatrist who specializes in children and adolescents . &quot; By teaching contraception , we ' re not going_to say it ' s OK to have_sex , but rather , ' You need to know what ' s going_to happen if . . . . ' &quot; Zablow dismisses as &quot; sheer propaganda &quot; the program ' s message that boys are more easily aroused than girls . &quot; Society allows girls to talk more freely about sexual and emotional feelings , therefore , boys are more apt to act_out , &quot; he said . &quot; Repeated studies show that if you try to repress sexual feelings , they may come_out later in far more dangerous ways -- sexual abuse , rape . . . . &quot; But Park says that in many cases the critics of Sex Respect have overreacted . She says the course &quot; centers around the idea that humans being really can control their behavior , including sexual behavior. &quot; &quot; It teaches kids how to date , and that they don ' t have to be sexually active , &quot; she said . The students in Park ' s class appear to support her wholeheartedly . Some even see themselves as the victims of sex before marriage . Had her parents saved themselves until their wedding_night , a 12-year-old said quietly , maybe they would have stayed married . One boy said : &quot; I don ' t want to throw my life away , not like the 15-year-old girl I know who got pregnant and had to drop_out . I can ' t imagine anything more horrible. &quot; Proponents say Sex Respect is needed because , in Park ' s words , so many messages encourage premarital sex . To &quot; force-feed students talk_of contraception &quot; is to whet their appetites for sex , she said . But Jennifer Cusworth , 16 , a junior at Hemet High_School and one of Park ' s former students , disagreed , saying a 10th-grade social_psychology course that dealt heavily with contraception taught her &quot; 100 % more_than Sex Respect ever did. &quot; Cusworth said she likes Park and considers her a &quot; good person. &quot; But she dismisses Sex Respect as &quot; nothing more_than a church sermon. &quot; &quot; She told us you could get AIDS from French kissing , and when I heard that wasn ' t exactly true , I just didn ' t think much of the rest of it , &quot; Cusworth said . &quot; In the end , I didn ' t know what to believe. &quot;</TEXT>
