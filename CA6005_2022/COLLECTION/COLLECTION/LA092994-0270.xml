   <HEADLINE> FASHION ; BRIGITTE BARDOT , THEN AND NOW ; IN HER YOUTH , THE ACTRESS WAS A SEX OBJECT . NOW , IT SEEMS , SHE IS AN OBJECT ONLY OF RIDICULE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With two screen goddesses reaching their 60th birthdays this month , it would be nice to draw a parallel moral on_time and fading beauty , but Sophia Loren and Brigitte Bardot have taken so differently to senior citizenship that we are left to muse on the cruelty of the coincidence . Loren has worn the years well , aging with her myth . Her birthday pictures , all glamour and elegance , epitomize the modern dream that time ' s hand can be stayed , preserving youth and sex_appeal into a seventh decade . In Bardot ' s case , the lesson is of a different kind . There are no Loren-style glamour shots to celebrate B.B. ' s birthday . Her only public outing of late has been to defend the wolf of the Vosges , an elusive animal that has made headlines for killing sheep . &quot; Just leave him alone , &quot; she pleaded to the_hunters who are out_to bag the animal . But Bardot ' s sun-weathered and unlifted features are familiar from her infrequent appearances on behalf of dogs , donkeys , whales , bulls , horses and all_the other fauna to which she has devoted herself since , as she puts it , &quot; I gave my beauty and my youth to men. &quot; Ever jealous of her image , she sends lawyers leaping to protect her from anything outside those tightly controlled occasions where the light is kept soft and television_cameras avoid close-ups of the famous pout and the hair still piled high , the look once copied by females around the world . Bardot has not forgiven that world , which she once said robbed her of her life , and the feeling in her homeland this month seems to be somewhat mutual . Just as B.B. transcended movies to stand as the symbol of an epoch , her aging seems to be resented in a France obsessed these days by its lost innocence . &quot; It ' s because of Bardot that women do not exist . She killed them like Parker killed the saxophone , &quot; L ' Express magazine noted recently as one television channel devoted a night to her films . Bardot has long been the source of unease in France . Even though she emerged in retirement in the 1970s as a national_monument , with her likeness given to Marianne , the allegory of the Republic whose bust sits in every town_hall , she was reviled by many in her years of greatest fame . Women spat at her in the street , priests denounced her from the pulpit , and the press chronicled with morbid delight the misfortunes of her marriages , the abandonment of her baby son and her suicide attempts . Roger Vadim , her Svengali , had barely launched her in &quot; And God Created Woman &quot; in 1956 when the intellectuals were already trying to fathom the deep trouble that she was inflicting on the_French psyche . In a celebrated essay , Simone de Beauvoir diagnosed the threat she posed as a force of nature . Catholic , strait-laced France , said an approving De Beauvoir , could not swallow such a shameless hussy . Bardot was a femme_fatale who was not a cinematic artifice like Ava Gardner or Marilyn Monroe , but a barefoot waif with a predatory sexual appetite . Loren , De Beauvoir wrote in 1959 , was the former type , a &quot; full-blown woman &quot; shaped by moguls to appeal_to men . Bardot , in turn , was &quot; the perfect specimen of the ambiguous nymph. &quot; As France knew , Juliette , the wanton gamine of &quot; And God Created Woman , &quot; was Bardot herself , not a figment of fiction . With the birthday , France is being reminded of those pre-Pill years , when happiness was a white convertible speeding to Saint-Trop ' down the Route Nationale 7 . A younger generation , saturated with the vulgarities of Madonna and the sexless B.B. mimicry of Claudia Schiffer , is being offered a glimpse of a seemingly sweeter age . In old black-and-white newsreels , B.B. dazzles along with those other marvels of Gallic superiority , the DS Citroen , the Caravelle jet and the haughty silhouette of Charles de Gaulle . The documentaries and the rebroadcasting of some of her four dozen films are reminding the country of the way a single Frenchwoman held the world in thrall . B.B. , we are reminded , achieved her initial glory thanks to America , where Vadim ' s film , with its nudity and lovemaking , was a scandalous sensation after it flopped initially at_home . No French product since then has managed to grip the American imagination in the way that Bardot did , and she never even worked in Hollywood . As an export industry , De Beauvoir said , she had become more powerful than Renault cars . In 1960 France , an age before pop stars or sportsmen had scaled the celebrity heights , a poll showed that B.B. was the main topic of conversation in 47 % of all households . Yet , watching those old newsreels , you can see the torment that was being inflicted on a woman whom France would not allow to grow_up and lead her own life . &quot; She only pleased us on condition that she was not allowed to exist , &quot; Le Figaro remarked recently . You can see the pain already there in the newsreels as she faces walls of reporters whose questions seem as archaic in 1994 as their trilby hats and big box_cameras . &quot; What do you think_of free_love , Miss Bardot ? &quot; they asked her in New York on her first American trip , in 1965 . &quot; I don ' t think when I am making_love , &quot; she replied . &quot; Will you still be like this at 60 ? &quot; another man asked . &quot; I ' ll never be 60 because , between then and now , I ' m certain science will make a lot of progress , &quot; she answered . In a way , she was right , because the Bardot who turned 60 on Wednesday considers herself to be entering the third decade of another life , the one she began when she abandoned acting in 1973 . &quot; You have to understand that everything before my work with animals has nothing to do with me , &quot; she told Jeffrey Robinson , her latest biographer , earlier this year . &quot; The woman who made those movies , that ' s not me. &quot; For France this month , she is two people . There is the B.B. of the cinema , brought_down by the trail of broken marriages and self-indulgence , but fondly remembered as the icon of France ' s postwar rebirth . And there is Mme . Bardot -- the embittered animal activist , scourge of horse butchers , nuisance to politicians , wife of a far-right political figure and butt of jokes at the corner bistro . This is the one that Globe magazine described the other day as &quot; ridiculously eternal. &quot;</TEXT>
