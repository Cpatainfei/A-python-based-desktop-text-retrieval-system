   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CASTRO MAY BE SEEKING DEAL TO END EXODUS ; POLICY : THE CUBAN LEADER HAS SENT STRONG SIGNALS . GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HINT THAT SOME ACCOMMODATION IS POSSIBLE TO RESOLVE REFUGEE CRISIS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three weeks after Fidel Castro ignited the Florida Straits refugee crisis by allowing emigration from his impoverished island , there is growing evidence that the Cuban leader is looking_for a face-saving deal to call_off the chaotic exodus . Although Castro ' s publicly stated demands go_far beyond anything President Clinton is likely to consider , experts who study Cuba , both in and out of the U.S._government , say they believe that his real objectives are far more modest . The Cuban dictator has sent strong signals that he is prepared to stop the flow of raft refugees if the United States will agree to prosecute Cubans who make_it to Florida in stolen aircraft or boats , increase the pace of legal immigration and restore permission for Cuban Americans to send money to relatives on the island . Those would not be difficult conditions for Clinton to meet . Since the refugee crisis began , the U.S._government has already ended a three-decade-old policy of welcoming all Cuban defectors , which often allowed hijackers to escape punishment . Washington also has promised to facilitate legal immigration . And the ban on money transfers was imposed to punish Castro for permitting the unlimited exodus , so it would not be difficult for the Administration to lift the restriction if the refugee flow stops . Nevertheless , decades of distrust and suspicion between Havana and Washington will make_it difficult to hammer_out a deal even if there seems to be little disagreement on matters of substance . For instance , Castro has made_it clear that he wants the international recognition that would accompany direct high-level negotiations with the United States . But the Administration is unwilling to give it to him . &quot; Fidel Castro has shown absolutely no inclination to move toward democracy , and until he does , there is no need for dialogue , &quot; White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said in reiterating the Administration ' s refusal to open broad talks with Cuba . Still , there may be more wiggle room in the positions of the two sides than appears in their public declarations . With the two governments agreeing to mid-level talks on immigration , cover could be provided_for wider discussions that might permit Washington and Havana to settle the refugee crisis . U.S. officials are hinting that the Administration might be a bit more flexible in its approach if Castro makes a show of goodwill . &quot; Castro ' s going_to have to do a lot before we get_to that stage , &quot; said one official , acknowledging that some accommodation is possible . Clinton and Castro could be driven toward a deal by their own political weaknesses . Clinton clearly cannot tolerate a prolonged refugee crisis that would reinforce public skepticism about his performance on foreign_policy . If the refugee flow continues unabated , it could easily overwhelm available internment facilities . In addition , it will sorely tax the resources of the Navy and Coast Guard , which have assigned 46 ships , 35 smaller_boats and 12 aircraft to rescue rafters in the Florida Straits . Castro is trying to contend with a growing economic_crisis that has clearly weakened his regime . The Cuban economy began shrinking in 1984 . It has declined by almost 50 % since 1989 , when communism began to collapse in the former Soviet_Union and Eastern Europe , robbing Castro of his traditional patrons . No relief is in_sight . Moreover , Cubans rioted in Havana on Aug . 5 , the first such incident since the 1960s . The disturbance was brought under_control , but it showed that Castro ' s grip might be loosening . Nevertheless , it almost certainly would be a mistake for either the United States or Cuba to try to wait for the other ' s internal problems to force concessions because both governments can hold_out for quite a while . Castro can probably tolerate the refugee flow for months if he does not get the sort of deal he wants . The refugee flow has not caused any security problems for Castro ' s regime . Cuban police have been able to keep order on the beach , and many of the refugees would be potential troublemakers if they remained in Cuba . &quot; Fidel can wait us out , &quot; one expert said . &quot; Or at least we think he can. &quot; &quot; This regime is weaker , certainly , than it was in 1989 , &quot; said Jorge I . Dominguez , a Harvard_University professor of political_science . But he said Castro ' s government has checked some erosion of its power by its &quot; export of opposition. &quot; Another analyst said Cuba has at least 1 million &quot; surplus &quot; workers , enabling it to sustain the present refugee outflow almost indefinitely . However , the analyst said Castro would prefer an orderly departure of Cuban dissidents to the chaotic flotilla of rafts . A 1984 agreement between Castro and the Ronald Reagan_Administration allows 27 # 845 Cubans a year to travel_to the United States as legal immigrants . But for most of the past decade , the departures have averaged about 3 # 000 a year . From the start , Washington has considered the 27 # 845 figure to be a ceiling . Under U.S. law , the only people who qualify are those with relatives who are legal residents of the United States , and those with needed skills and a firm job offer from an American employer . Castro has said that the &quot; spirit &quot; of the agreement calls_for an annual migration of 27 # 845 . Experts think Castro might hold_out for a promise to increase that level as part of a deal to stop the rafters .</TEXT>
