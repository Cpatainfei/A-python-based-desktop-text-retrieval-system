   <TEXT> Should the Episcopal Church bless committed and monogamous same-sex unions ? Should the church ordain non-celibate gay_men and lesbians to the priesthood ? After three years of intensive behind-the-scenes study , a committee of the nation ' s Episcopal bishops has completed a proposed pastoral teaching on human sexuality that is likely to leave neither liberals nor conservatives satisfied . The issue -- one that has confronted the American Baptist_Churches , United Methodist_Church , Presbyterian_Church ( USA ) and the Evangelical Lutheran_Church in America , among others -- is expected to come_to a head Aug . 24 when the church ' s House of Bishops convenes in Indianapolis for the denomination ' s triennial General Convention -- the highest policy-making body of the church . The bishops are scheduled to vote on whether to make the draft a pastoral teaching , which would guide the denomination ' s 2.5 million members . On one hand , the draft acknowledges the current ban on ordaining non-celibate gays and lesbians , and upholds heterosexual marriage as the church ' s historic standard . As in the Roman_Catholic_Church , homosexual orientation in itself has not been a bar to ordination . At the same time , however , the draft proposes eight guidelines for continuing the sometimes wrenching dialogue that could someday lead to a change in the Episcopal Church ' s position on homosexuality . &quot; There is no common mind in this church , theologically or practically speaking , on homosexuality , &quot; said a member of the drafting committee , the Rt . Rev . Richard L . Shimpfky , bishop of the Diocese of El Camino Real , which includes San Jose and Monterey . To liberals , especially gay and lesbian advocates , the guidelines fail to go_far enough in honoring committed same-sex relationships and affirming the gifts that non-celibate gays and lesbians can bring_to the priesthood . To conservatives , the draft softens the church ' s traditional teaching that sexual_morality means absolute faithfulness in marriage and sexual abstinence apart from marriage . Last week , for example , 18 bishops from Province VII of the church -- which includes Arkansas , New Mexico , Oklahoma , Texas , Kansas and parts of Missouri and Louisiana -- warned that the guidelines &quot; would signal a substantive change &quot; in the church ' s teaching . * The charge is denied by the Rt . Rev . Richard F . Grein , Bishop of New York City and chairman of the drafting committee . &quot; This pastoral teaching is not intended to offer a particular solution or some new unusual perspective on the issues , nor have we changed the present teaching of this church on any of these issues , &quot; Grein wrote . In the meantime , anticipating what could be a contentious debate , the bishops stress that as vexing as sexual issues can be , they do not touch_on the doctrinal core of Christian faith and belief and should not be allowed to disrupt the unity of the Episcopal Church , the U.S. branch of the worldwide Anglican_Communion . The guidelines reflect the bishops ' dilemma . The first guideline acknowledges a 1979 policy that says the church will only ordain those who , among other qualifications , can be a &quot; wholesome example to all people. &quot; In essence the earlier policy allows the ordination as deacons , priests and bishops of celibate gays and lesbians who are otherwise qualified . The question then arises over whether a non-celibate gay or lesbian can be a wholesome example . To some bishops the answer is yes . To others the answer is clearly no . It is up_to the local bishop and his or her local Commission on Ministry to decide . Thus , a liberal bishop like the Rt . Rev . Shelby Spong of Newark , N.J. has ordained non-celibate gays and lesbians , while other bishops steadfastly refuse . &quot; Who defines ' wholesome ' -- that ' s what we ' re dealing with , &quot; Shimpfky said . &quot; Historically it has always been the bishop and people of the diocese that have made that determination . But now . . . there are a lot of people who are saying they don ' t like that . They want what ' s wholesome in Iowa to be what ' s applicable in New York City . That becomes a flash point. &quot; The only major denomination with a clear policy permitting the ordination of non-celibate gays and lesbians is the United Church of Christ . The second issue involves whether to bless same-gender unions . The term marriage is never used . In its proposed guidelines , the bishops committee appears to hedge the issue . First it says it recognizes that the New Testament standard is a lifelong , monogamous , heterosexual union . But four paragraphs later , the draft substitutes the words &quot; mature adults &quot; for man and woman . &quot; We believe sexual_relationships reach their fullest potential for good and minimize their capacity for ill when in the context of chaste , faithful , and committed lifelong unions between mature adults . There are those who believe this is as true for homosexual as for heterosexual relationships and that such relationships need and should receive the pastoral care of the church , &quot; the draft declares . The Rt . Rev . Chester Talton , Suffragan ( assistant ) bishop of the Los Angeles Episcopal Diocese , said the draft teaching is trying to face reality . &quot; The pastoral attempts to lift_up before the whole church that different things are happening in different parts of the church , &quot; Talton said . &quot; I don ' t think the pastoral attempts to say that the teaching of the church is changed . It ' s just to acknowledge that the way we are living together as the church is evolving and changing and expressing itself in different ways and different places. &quot; Episcopal priests in the Los Angeles diocese are divided . The Rev . George Regas , rector of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena , caused a furor among some priests when he began blessing same-sex unions in 1992 . That same year , Rabbi Allen I . Freehling of University Synagogue in Los Angeles , a Reform congregation , performed what he called a same-sex marriage of two men . Will the guidelines make any difference to bishops and local parishioners ? Jim Solheim , a church spokesman at national headquarters in New York , thinks it may to those in the middle . &quot; For those on the far right who in sweeping gestures dismiss the whole process it obviously is not going_to make any difference at all , &quot; Solheim said . &quot; For the liberal bishops who have already made_up their minds it ' s going_to mean absolutely nothing . But when you lop_off the right and lop_off the left , you have a central core of bishops who take the process seriously and would like the church to wrestle with this until they come_to some kind of agreement. &quot; Findings Include Guide_on Sexuality Here are some of the guidelines the Episcopal bishops committee on sexuality is recommending : * &quot; While our sexuality is a very important part of who we are . . . . * &quot; The standard found in the New Testament of lifelong , monogamous , heterosexual union as the setting intended by God for sexual_relationships . . . is the foundation on which the church ' s traditional teaching is built . * &quot; We continue in study and dialogue , seeking to reconcile , to the extent possible , discontinuities which may exist in . . . human sexuality between Scripture , tradition and informed reason on the one hand , and our human experience on the other . * &quot; It is necessary for the church to articulate appropriate moral and ethical guidelines for homosexual as well as heterosexual Christians . * &quot; Sexual relationships reach their fullest potential for good . . . in the context of chaste , faithful and committed lifelong unions between mature adults . There are those who believe this is as true for homosexual as for heterosexual relationships . . . . * &quot; We view_as . . . morally unacceptable sexual behavior which is adulterous , promiscuous , abusive or exploitative in nature , or which involves children or others incapable of informed , mutual consent and understanding . . . . &quot;</TEXT>
