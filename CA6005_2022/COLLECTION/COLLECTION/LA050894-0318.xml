   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : EAST : LINCOLN HEIGHTS ; ACTIVIST ORGANIZES LULAC YOUTH CLUB</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Five months after her daughter was severely injured by a drunk driver in a crosswalk , Beatrice Gonzales has suspended her push for a traffic_light at the intersection and instead is focusing her energy on establishing a neighborhood youth group . Gonzales said she realized that a traffic_light would probably not save another child from a drunk driver , so at the request of Father Juan Santillan , pastor of Our Lady Help of Christians Catholic_Church , and Rosemary Lopez of County Supervisor Gloria Molina ' s office , Gonzales started organizing the youth group . &quot; We ' re going to work with the kids and show them things they can do to be involved , &quot; Gonzales said . &quot; If this is what I can do to help them , I hope it does some good. &quot; About a dozen youths have joined the new Lincoln Heights League of United Latin_American Citizens Youth Council , said Gonzales , who wants to involve the teen-agers in crafts and activities at the Boys and Girls Club . Gonzales also hopes to raise money so they can attend the May 27-29 LULAC state convention in Cerritos . Gonzales wants the Lincoln Heights 14- to 17-year-olds to be able to stay_at a hotel so they can get a full taste of the convention . Friends who helped Gonzales raise money for her daughter ' s medical_expenses will host a $ 5 menudo breakfast from 9 a.m. to noon May 15 at the Lincoln Heights Boys and Girls Club , 2635 Pasadena Ave. , for the new group . &quot; They have ( LULAC youth groups ) in Monterey Park and Alhambra but not in our area , &quot; Gonzales said . &quot; We want to bring the kids to show them to be good citizens and to help the community. &quot; Gonzales said she is taking_on the new project in part to thank the youths who were so supportive of her family in the aftermath of the Dec . 5 accident , which put her 14-year-old daughter in a coma for 15 days . Cindy Gonzales had been walking with her friend Frank Cifuentes , 16 , on North Broadway at Sichel Street when a car driven by John Joe Gomez , 30 , of Lincoln Heights hit them , throwing Cindy 30 feet . Cifuentes suffered a broken leg , cuts and bruises . Gomez , who had two prior convictions for drunk driving , was sentenced April 29 to three years in state_prison , said Deputy Dist . Atty . Jessica Pick . Cindy Gonzales , who is now walking without the aid of a walker , will be returning to Lincoln High_School soon . She had been attending Eagle Rock High_School for classes that helped her review the several months of learning that she lost because of her injuries . Cindy ' s rehabilitation , in which she was in classes with other disabled youths , has helped her mother focus_on activities the new youth group might pursue . &quot; I ' m looking_for a place with handicapped kids so we can spend a day with them and help them , &quot; Gonzales said . &quot; Cindy ' s opened_up new avenues for us because she doesn ' t see them as handicapped , whereas before , she probably would n ' t have paid any attention to them. &quot; Information : ( 213 ) 226-0485 .
