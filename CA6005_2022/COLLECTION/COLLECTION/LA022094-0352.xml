   <TEXT> Now for the latest in California living : You start , say , with the stone-coated steel roof -- a defense against the ravages of quakes , brush_fires and Santa Ana winds reaching , oh , about 120 m.p.h. Under the floors you install the patented temblor-resistant foundation system , lest the Big One rattle your home into the nearest fissure . Flying glass ? No problem when you coat the windows with high-tech , shatter-resistant clear plastic , strong enough to handle not only earthquakes , but Molotov_cocktails and drive-by_shootings . Inside your home , you can gird for disaster with an array of specialty products . Secure that Ming vase -- you may need it to afford all_of this -- with specially formulated anti-quake goop ; just smear a little between base and tabletop . Now you can sleep soundly in your 800-pound , steel-girdered earthquake canopy bed . The next time Los Angeles is lurching and quivering like a rumba dancer , you might even snooze through it , unless you choose to be alerted with the newly developed seismic-alarm wall_clock -- patent pending . What better reassurance after the devastating Northridge earthquake than to know that the entrepreneurs are out there ready to serve ? For whatever ills it might have wrought , the quake has also sent a powerful tremor through one of the nation ' s growing cottage industries : the manufacture and sale of disaster-related products . Never mind that some products are gimmicky or impractical , or that some of the best-intentioned devices never reach the market . The greater effect is a nation more prepared than ever to face the forces of nature , bolstered by untold thousands of tinkerers and promoters for whom calamity is the mother of invention . With every titanic earthquake , fire , flood or tornado comes a new spike on the sales charts of the one-pound collapsible portable commode , or the automatic natural_gas shut-off valve , or the temporary , inflatable dam -- the purported equivalent of 1 # 000 sandbags . New ideas are ever-emerging . Forget about building a better mousetrap . Far better , perhaps , to perfect that insulated , water-cooled , motor-ventilated family safety capsule , the only place to be when the roads are closed and the house is gone and the wall of fire comes blowing through . &quot; We ' re working with the inventors on that one , &quot; said Alan Tratner , president of the nonprofit Inventor ' s Workshop International Education Foundation , a Canoga Park-based organization that helps usher new products to market . &quot; Every time there is something of major significance in the news , we get an influx of ideas . The dream is_well alive in America that if you have a great idea , you can make a_million dollars. &quot; Not many disaster products have made millionaires , but the impulse to produce such products is nearly as old as ruination itself , Tratner noted . Milestones in the litany of preparedness include the European castle moat , the storm_cellars of the more recent American Midwest , the more ominous bomb_shelters of the nuclear era 1950s and the household smoke_alarm . &quot; I remember reading about the Great Chicago Fire ( of 1871 ) , &quot; Tratner said , &quot; and I think people were coming_up with . . . ( fire ) alarm devices . I think whenever there has been a disaster -- in this country and abroad -- people have come_up with disaster-related ideas. &quot; For the most part , disaster gadgets represent low-volume trade because their appeal is often regional -- confined to quake-prone areas , for example -- and many consumers are unwilling to buy products they might not use , according to some experts . But today , social and economic forces are giving momentum to sales . The personal safety market is booming , fueled by rising crime and new advertising venues , such_as cable_television channels devoted exclusively to health , fitness or the weather , said Barry Mason , chairman of the Chicago-based American Marketing Assn. , which tracks retailing trends . &quot; As we see the exploding number of cable channels and alternative ( advertising ) vehicles , products can be pinpointed to market segments as never before , in a cost-effective way , &quot; Mason said . &quot; And as we move more into a world of electronic media , people are constantly bombarded by the hazards . . . they see on the news. &quot; Add to all that a sudden ripple of the earth -- say , a 6.8-magnitude jolt that brings_down homes and freeway bridges -- and voila ! There is a demand for products where no demand existed before . A case_in_point is the earthquake bed . One model , assembled of heavy iron pipes tested to withstand 80 tons of downward force , was an unmitigated flop when it debuted nearly two years ago . Inventor Curly Jon Ward , a race_car builder , invested $ 150 # 000 to make 35 beds , then hired a marketing expert , mailed_out 350 videos and arranged an 800 number to await the onslaught of buyers . Not a single sale followed . One bed found its way to Wertz Brothers Inc. on the Westside , where it sat as a floor sample for nearly 18 months -- until the Northridge temblor . Only then did a seismically motivated consumer take it home , at the quake sale price of $ 699 . &quot; We just wanted to get_it out of here , &quot; conceded store controller John Lundgren . &quot; It ' s kind of ugly. &quot; A different design , constructed of black steel beams and trusses rising to a central apex , has been more in_demand at the Brass Bed Factory in Northridge , just two miles from January ' s epicenter . After a year of unpromising sales -- zero_in 1993 -- at least five of the 800-pound behemoths , designed by managing partner Gary Waagenaar , have sold in rapid succession , commanding $ 2 # 500 for king-size and $ 2 # 000 for queen , said general_manager Michael Calka . A key selling point -- or maybe the only selling point -- is that an entire roof could collapse on it , and the bed would endure . &quot; It ' s a complete steel canopy , &quot; Calka said . &quot; It almost looks_like a bridge , as far as the trusses. &quot; Less formidable quake products are moving more briskly . A small Monrovia company called Trevco has had to double its full-time work_force , from two employees to four , to handle the sudden clamoring for Quake Hold , a reusable , putty-like substance that keeps vases , TVs and other objects from toppling . A 2.6-ounce packet -- enough to secure &quot; 30 or 40 wine glasses &quot; -- retails for $ 5.99 , said founder and inventor Dran May-Reese . &quot; It ' s just unbelievable , &quot; she said of the demand . &quot; When we ' d sell to a dealer , the ( standard ) order used to be 36 units . We ' re now getting orders from that same dealer for 1 # 000 units at a time. &quot; Marianne Simpson , 49 , a_Thousand Oaks resident who has collected more_than 100 dachshund figurines , gave the reusable goop -- specially formulated by a hired chemist -- glowing reviews after the Northridge temblor put cracks in her home and left her husband ' s office a shambles . Not a single dog was overturned . &quot; It ' s fantastic , &quot; she said . Another entrepreneur , Richard M . Diaz , is making a similar retailing splash with his one-pound portable toilet , patented four years ago . The biodegradable , polymer-lined commode measures 10 inches by 10 inches by 2 1 / 4 inches when folded , and expands to a nearly perfect cube . Diaz touts it as cheap ( $ 10 apiece ) , sanitary and easy to lug to those uncomfortable places where water_lines are ruptured or evacuees are crowded together in makeshift camps . &quot; Our motto is : ' It ' s ready to go when you are , ' &quot; the 48-year-old inventor said . &quot; With this thing , you just sit_down and pull_up a magazine and you ' re home. &quot; Sales were &quot; a couple hundred dollars &quot; in the entire week before the quake , according to Diaz , who launched the company from his garage in Patton , a tiny town near Redlands . But with his promotional faxes filling the phone_lines , and more stores placing orders all_the time , the personal privy is a hot commodity . &quot; Since the earthquake , we ' re probably averaging $ 1 # 000 a day , and growing , &quot; he said . Astute promoters were firing_up the marketing engines right after the shaking stopped . Sellers of a protective transparent film for windows called a news_conference to demonstrate how the laminated plastic , known as Armorcoat , keeps glass from flying during earthquakes , hurricanes or even drive-by_shootings -- although the bullets do come_through . The plan was for Bob Kerr , owner of Window Tints Etc . of Redondo Beach , to take a baseball_bat to a coated window as the media chronicled the dramatic result . Unfortunately , no one showed_up . But by employing ads , phone solicitations and word_of_mouth , retailers were managing to get_out the message . Sales of the coating -- billed as the latest advance in a technology imported years ago from Europe -- were running 200 % above normal , and perhaps still rising . ( The coating made a tenfold sales gain in Florida after Hurricane Andrew , one distributor said. ) &quot; A million and a half square_feet of glass did blow_out . . . from the quake itself , &quot; Kerr said . &quot; But whoever had Armorcoat on their windows didn ' t get hurt -- I know that for a fact. &quot; State agencies , such_as the California Department of Consumer Affairs , do not pretest such products to assess their effectiveness , but so far state and city of Los Angeles consumer affairs offices have received no significant complaints about quake-related merchandise , according to spokesmen . The financial stakes for homeowners are often substantial . The window laminate must be professionally applied and runs $ 300 for a 10-foot-by-10-foot section of glass . The average price of a stone-coated steel roof is about $ 7 # 200 even when there is no obtrusive existing roof to drive_up the cost . On the other hand , the expense brings a_level of security that was unavailable a_few decades ago . With steel-roof construction -- imported from New Zealand around 1980 -- a proud homeowner can expect security even when 120-m.p.h. winds are hurling wayward tiles from the neighbor ' s roof like so many ceramic missiles , according to James F . McMullen , a consultant for the Steel Roofing Manufacturers Assn . A steel roof is guaranteed for 50 years . Except under the harshest conditions , it is impervious to quake or fire . When brush_fires ravaged Laguna Beach last fall , four steel-roofed homes collapsed in the eye of the firestorm , where nothing endured , McMullen said . But on the periphery , he said , a dozen steel-roofed homes held_up like battleships -- even on one block where all_the other houses burned_down . &quot; They ' re fire-resistant , obviously -- they ' re steel , &quot; the consultant said . &quot; The people that put_on this kind of roof . . . are the people who want a roof that ' s going_to be_on for the rest of your life. &quot; Northridge resident Jill Brown , who bought one after her home burned_down a_few years ago , saw the quake split some of her neighbors ' roofs in half . Her own house was pandemonium -- flying dishes , bookshelves , cabinets , TVs . But the roof ? &quot; I don ' t think it even moved , &quot; she said . &quot; It really helped hold our house together. &quot; Other products are still in the pipeline , under development for future catastrophes . As_many as 50 # 000 to 100 # 000 amateur Edisons and professional tinkerers are probably out there at some stage of creating some disaster-aversion gadget -- either for earthquakes or floods or blizzards or some_other calamity , said Franklin Bartels , head of the newly founded Independent Inventors Assn . of Northern California . The concepts almost assuredly include breakthroughs and ill-fated contrivances alike . There are portable emergency elevators designed to descend the outer walls of high-rises , hurricane shut-off valves for offshore oil platforms , doorway flood barriers , earthquake indicator lights and fog-spewing firefighting devices . Franz deGruet , an inventor and artist who calls his Los Angeles company deGruet ( &quot; deGruet is a problem solving organization &quot; ) , has devised a system he labels Ultraspace for temporarily rebuilding quake-damaged highway bridges . The system employs what he calls &quot; a lightweight , high-strength , tubularly derived , honeycomb-type structure , &quot; a series of bow-shaped rods laid_over a metal honeycomb base . Since conceiving the design seven years ago , deGruet has built model after model , but has yet to test the technology or bring it before state_highway officials . For $ 50 million , give or take , it might have saved billions of dollars in lost commuter hours by providing instant bridges after the Northridge quake , he figures . &quot; Most people think it ' s a crazy idea -- that it won ' t work -- but that ' s wrong , &quot; deGruet said . &quot; The earthquake definitely came too soon. &quot; Long_Beach inventor Ernest Rinard , 70 , has invested about $ 7 # 000 in his earthquake clock , which features dangling brass tubes that function much like wind chimes . For whom do those bells toll ? For anyone who must be told that the ground is shaking -- and who would also fork over the suggested retail price , $ 80 . The seven existing models occupy boxes_in Rinard ' s home . Tratner , the Inventor ' s Workshop president , is at_work on_his_own brainstorm -- an emergency &quot; nightstick &quot; incorporating an alarm and a light , and useful for breaking_through doorways or clubbing would-be attackers . Tratner talked with admiration about other newfangled devices on the way -- with luck , before the next cataclysm . &quot; Somebody came_up with a Swiss Army-type disaster tool , &quot; he remembered , describing how it opens into a sledgehammer / hatchet / crowbar capable of smashing through glass or prying open obstructed doors . There are also designs for various types of all-purpose disaster suits , &quot; kind of like modern armor , &quot; containing helmets , air_filters , emergency water_supplies and headlamps . One of those would be just the thing to keep next to the quake bed , the type of product that anyone in Los Angeles might appreciate . &quot; Even if you slept_in the nude , you could have it right there -- just get_in and there you go , &quot; Tratner said . &quot; I think the suit might be one of the better solutions to come_out of these disasters. &quot;</TEXT>
