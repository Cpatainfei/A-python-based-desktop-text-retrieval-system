   <HEADLINE> OLYMPIC FESTIVAL ; SPRINTER BROWN , 33 , IS STILL SEARCHING FOR GOLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alice Brown doesn ' t have to explain why she is here . But she does . Brown ' s running credentials are impeccable , even if they haven ' t brought her fame outside the track_and_field community . At the Olympic Games , she won gold medals in both 1984 and 1988 as part of the 400-meter relay team . She also won a silver medal in the 100 meters in 1984 . But that was 10 years ago , the recent gold was six , and people today have the audacity to ask what she is doing at the Olympic Festival . Some athletes would roll their eyes at such a question . Brown smiles . Hey , she owns these games . She has won seven Festival gold medals over the years . that ' s the most of any track_and_field athlete . In an event that often featured marquee names such_as Florence Griffith-Joyner , Evelyn Ashford and Gail Devers , Brown won her share and finished second and third a host of other times . Fast company , but not_bad company . And then she gets the question . &quot; that ' s something I evaluate myself , &quot; Brown says pleasantly . &quot; I come_back to the Festival for several reasons . The simulation of the Olympic Games , organization and good competition . &quot; The competition now is also a lot better than it used to be. &quot; With that statement , Brown indicates that she is looking_to the future . The 33-year-old Hacienda Heights resident is hoping to get_to Atlanta in 1996 . But things have not gone well for her in the last year . She left her track club to practice independently , then suffered a stress_fracture in a foot and failed to get past the first round in the national meet . She remains undaunted . &quot; I feel I should be getting_back to times where I should be running , 11.2 or 11.3 ( in the 100 ) , &quot; Brown said . &quot; It was the first time I ' ve been injured in 20 years . So far , I ' ve only had four or five races , so I need to get_back in a competitive mode and have some more races under my belt. &quot; She should get a good gauge of her recovery tonight . She will be the oldest runner in the event , 16 years older than the youngest , Aspen Burkett . But she makes no apologies for being 33 . &quot; I think_over the last four to five years , athletes have started to realize that they can ( compete ) into their mid-30s , &quot; Brown said . &quot; A lot has to do with the fact that you have to have the desire to compete . I think a lot of athletes , before , didn ' t have the desire or weren ' t sound enough financially to compete into their mid-30s . But now that we are able to , it ' s going_to work_out well for our athletes. &quot; Financial viability is still a problem for Brown , who is able to continue in part because of the U.S. Olympic Committee ' s job program . A graduate of Cal State Northridge , Brown wants to organize a track_and_field athletes ' union . &quot; I do think the sport is dying , &quot; she said . &quot; There used to be meets in Southern California , but now there ' s just Mt . SAC and , indoors , the Sunkist Invitational . &quot; People just don ' t know about track_and_field . They wait until the Olympic Games , and that ' s all they know . If we had something that could help promote us -- I don ' t want to say a rivalry , but that ' s what brings the crowds in -- it would help . &quot; If you are capable of making the final race , you should have appearance money . Then if you finish in the top three , you deserve the prize_money . There are so many athletes who get left by the wayside , even though they are capable of ( competing ) . If you have a house and kid and a car payment and insurance , there ' s no way you can do_it , even if you want to. &quot;</TEXT>
