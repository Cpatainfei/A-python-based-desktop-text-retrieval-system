   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; HAITIANS FIND PACT PERPLEXING ; REACTION : BOTH SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS OF MILITARY SKEPTICAL THAT ARMY WILL LEAVE POWER , LET ARISTIDE RULE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The agreement that is supposed to force Haiti ' s junta from power here and restore exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has left Haitian political and business_leaders confused and uncertain that arriving U.S. forces really mean this nation is liberated from military rule . &quot; I think Clinton and Carter have been fooled , &quot; said a member of one of Haiti ' s oldest families , who heads a major drug manufacturing firm , referring to President Clinton and former President Jimmy_Carter . &quot; The generals have won. &quot; It was an odd assessment , given that it was made as the speaker and a reporter watched one U.S. Army helicopter after another land at the airport here to disgorge tons of equipment and the early detachments of what will eventually total 15 # 000 American soldiers . But the opinion was hardly unique and not limited to opponents of the junta , whose members are often described by U.S. officials as &quot; thugs in uniforms. &quot; &quot; If the Haitians ( in the military ) manage this well , &quot; said one businessman strongly opposed to Aristide , &quot; they will be_on top of Aristide , even if he does return and Cedras , Biamby and Francois are out. &quot; He was referring to Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , the Haitian strongman ; Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby , the army chief_of_staff ; and Police_Chief Col . Michel-Joseph Francois . They are the three leaders of the 1991 coup that overthrew Aristide . Under the agreement negotiated Sunday with a team led by former President Carter , the three Haitian military_leaders are to resign and give_up power no later than Oct . 15 . That agreement , which also guarantees Aristide ' s return when the regime ' s leaders leave , is backed by the American troops . But many Haitians -- accustomed to their army ' s tactics , which have included deviousness and lying -- fear that the Americans have been duped . They point to what they say are ambiguities and absences in the brief accord . &quot; First , &quot; said one pro-Aristide political expert , &quot; Cedras didn ' t sign it . Next , four weeks is just too long . What happens if Cedras says he won ' t go because no amnesty law is passed ? Do you think the American troops will shoot him or arrest him ? I don ' t. &quot; Missing too from the accord , and from any discussion by American officials in Washington or by Lt . Gen . Hugh Shelton , the U.S. troop commander here , was the fate of the 7 # 000-member Haitian army . The United States and Aristide previously had insisted on the separation of the Haitian police from the army ; the reduction of the military to about 1 # 500 soldiers , who largely would be border guards and road_builders ; and the retraining of all_the armed forces . But Haitians briefed by the Carter mission and other U.S. officials said these American demands , if they ever were serious , were scuttled during Carter ' s two days of talks so the negotiators could get Cedras and Biamby to accept the general accord . The skepticism of many Haitians -- interviewed in the aftermath of the dramatic Sunday night agreement -- also showed a widespread lack of comprehension of the meaning of the U.S. troops now present here . Most of them believe business in Haiti will go_on as usual , that the Parliament will refuse to pass an amnesty law called_for in the agreement , that Cedras will find some way to stay , that the anti-Aristide forces will keep the exiled president out . &quot; I think it will be just like the Harlan County and Governors Island , &quot; said one professional who opposes the military . He was discussing a July , 1993 , agreement , signed by Cedras , in which he promised to resign and leave the country by October , 1993 , and permit Aristide ' s restoration . Cedras reneged_on that agreement Oct . 11 , 1993 , when he organized an armed mob to prevent the landing of a U.S. military cargo_ship , the Harlan County , and caused the collapse of the accord . &quot; What ' s to stop them from doing the same thing now ? &quot; asked the Haitian professional . When it was pointed_out that 15 # 000 U.S. troops would make the difference , he just shrugged . A diplomat here observed : &quot; It ' s an amazing thing . ( The Haitians ) just don ' t seem to be able to understand that this is a military occupation and that Shelton is the military_governor . He may_not do a good job , and that could mean being fooled by the military . But he may do a good job and that will mean the end of life as these people know it . But it will be the American officers who decide , not Haitians. &quot; According to Haitians who are close to the officers who are supposed to leave under the agreement , Cedras will depart Haiti , &quot; probably no later than Sept . 30. &quot; And , as a result of three years of leading what is widely regarded_as one of the most corrupt regimes in the history of the region , &quot; you know that Cedras has no financial worries , &quot; said one Haitian businessman who knows the commanding general and his luxury-minded wife , Yannik . &quot; He loves Spain and he has a home already in Spain , &quot; the businessman said . &quot; Yannik would rather live there , and if Raoul thinks he might be president some day , he ' s young and can come_back after the Americans leave. &quot; As for Francois , whose resolve was largely responsible_for the success of the 1991 anti-Aristide coup , &quot; he will resign and take_care of business , &quot; said a close friend . That business , he said , will be the opening of a chain of target_ranges specializing in pistol shooting . Biamby might not go quite so gently , this source said , noting , &quot; He is a coup man . He will resign but you can bet he won ' t leave . He ' ll just stay around and wait for the Americans to leave . He ' ll try again. &quot; The Agreement Text of the agreement signed Sunday in Port-au-Prince by former President Jimmy_Carter and Haiti ' s acting president , Emile Jonassaint . 1-The purpose of the agreement is to foster peace in Haiti , to avoid violence and bloodshed , to promote freedom and democracy , and to forge a sustained and mutually_beneficial relationship between the governments , people and institutions of Haiti and the United States . 2-To implement this agreement , the Haitian military and police_forces will work in close cooperation with the U.S. Military_Mission . This cooperation , conducted with mutual respect , will last during the transitional period required for ensuring vital institutions of the country . 3-In order to personally contribute to the success of this agreement , certain military_officers of the Haitian armed forces are willing to consent to an early and honorable retirement in accordance with U.N. Resolutions 917 and 940 when a general amnesty will be voted into law by the Haitian Parliament , or Oct . 15 , 1994 , whichever is earlier .
