   <HEADLINE> FCC AIMS TO CURB 800-NUMBER ABUSES ; CONSUMERS : REGULATORS UNVEIL A PLAN TO STOP UNWARRANTED BILLING FOR MOSTLY ADULT SERVICES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal regulators took the first_step Tuesday toward preventing consumers from being wrongly billed for calls to information services . The Federal Communications Commission unveiled a plan to stem the abuses after receiving 2 # 000 complaints in the first six months of this year involving such charges , mostly for adult-oriented services carried_on 800 numbers , said Richard Metzger , deputy chief of the FCC ' s Common_Carrier Bureau . The problem involves only a small portion of the information services_industry -- companies that use 800 numbers not only to deliver services , from sports scores to psychic readings , but also charge for the call . The vast majority of information services use 900 numbers . Virtually all 800 numbers are toll-free -- unless the company , taking_advantage of an exception in a 1992 law , somehow got the caller ' s permission for the charge . that ' s where the problem has cropped_up , regulators said . In many instances , the caller , who may have agreed to the charge , wasn ' t the one who received the bill . Rather , the home or establishment from where the call was made got stuck_with the charges because the local telephone_company simply sent the bill there . The proposal is one of those rare regulatory instances in which some local phone_companies , prompted by customer complaints , want tougher federal rules . &quot; We ' re getting a lot of complaints from our customers , &quot; said Alan Ciamporcero , executive_director of federal relations for Pacific Telesis Group . &quot; It is very hard for us to separate legitimate ones ( agreements between callers and information service companies ) from not-legitimate ones. &quot; Under the FCC ' s new plan , local phone_companies have to make_sure they are billing the caller . They must verify that a written contract has been entered between the caller and the information service company before they bill for 800-number calls . The plan would also require the local phone_company to break_out charges for these calls from long-distance charges . It would also have to list the name , address and number of the information service provider ; the type of service offered , and the date , time and duration of the call . Plagued by customer complaints over 800-number charges , Bell Atlantic Corp . in June stopped billing for these calls , spokesman Michel Daley said . Metzger said many of the FCC ' s complaints are from hotels , colleges and universities and parents -- all_of whom were billed for calls they didn ' t make . Parents were particularly frustrated . Unlike 900 numbers , 800 numbers cannot be blocked by the head of a household . So there is no safety net for parents whose child might surreptitiously make an 800-number call . FCC attorney Robert Spangler said people usually end_up paying_for the calls_out of fear of losing their telephone_service , a ploy some information service companies use to get people to pay , he said . &quot; It ' s amazing to look_at the number of complaints where a person says , ' I agreed to pay this because I don ' t want to lose my phone_service , ' &quot; he said . The FCC ' s plan is open_to comment by industry groups and could be modified further . The ultimate plan is subject_to another commission vote before becoming final . Regulators said the plan , if adopted , will mean more work for local telephone_companies , which are responsible_for handling billing from information service companies . One practice that appears to be_on the rise could thwart any verification process , Daley said . Some information service_calls are showing_up as a regular 10-digit long-distance number , rather than an 800 number through which the service is actually provided . Local phone_companies can ' t tell that those charges need to be verified .</TEXT>
