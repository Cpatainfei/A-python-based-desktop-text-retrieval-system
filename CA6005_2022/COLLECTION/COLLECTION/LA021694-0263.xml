   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; JAPANESE PIZZA WAR : DOMINO ' S , KFC IN A FAST-FOOD FAMILY FEUD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If there ' s a big cheese in Tokyo ' s fiercely competitive pizza business , it is Ernest M . Higa . Higa courted pizza magnate Thomas Monaghan in the mid-1980s , and walked_off with exclusive franchising rights in Japan for the Domino ' s Pizza Inc. chain . Since then , he has clawed his way to the top of Tokyo takeout , with home deliveries of sushi and smoked-eel pizza within 30 minutes or less . Now , though , the Higa ( pronounced Hee-guh ) success story could come_in_for some serious revision , thanks to competition very close to home . Higa ' s brother-in-law is Takeshi Okawara , the head of Kentucky Fried Chicken ( KFC ) Japan , this nation ' s second-largest fast-food chain . About 18 months ago , KFC acquired from Pepsico Inc. the right to duplicate the Pizza Hut restaurant concept in Japan , and it has already opened about 50 Pizza Huts for a trial run . KFC is weighing a major expansion that could mean 300 outlets opening in the next few years . Higa ' s Domino ' s has 102 locations . &quot; What ' s awkward about all_of this is that ( Okawara ) has been my mentor for this industry , &quot; said the 41-year-old Higa , although he describes the rivalry as a friendly , family one . Moreover , Okawara ' s wife and Higa ' s sister , Aiko Okawara , run JC Foods Inc. , which supplies pizza ingredients to Domino ' s . While cross-linked family_businesses are common in Asia , American executives who do business with the firms see the family feud as a little jarring . &quot; It isn ' t an ideal situation from a conflict-of-interest standpoint , &quot; said Joel Silverstein , a vice_president of Pepsico ' s KFC International unit . &quot; In the United States it would be unheard of. &quot; The turf battle between Higa and Okawara is an interesting twist in the history of what has been described as Tokyo ' s first family of fast food . Over the years , the Higa clan has made a fortune importing enshrined bits of Americana to Japan . Descendants of Hawaiian sugar-cane farmers , the family moved to Japan after World_War_II . Patriarch and entrepreneur Yetsuo Higa , now 78 , brought U.S. baseball_teams to Japan for exhibition_games in the 1950s . He also bought a Pepsi-Cola bottling franchise and played a big role in introducing the beverage in Japan . Some 30 years later , Ernest Higa decided he wanted a slice of the pizza market after he read that a pizza fortune had helped finance Monaghan ' s purchase of the Detroit Tigers baseball_team in the early 1980s . Indeed , Higa ' s journey to the top of Japan ' s $ 8.8-billion fast-food business started just outside Tiger stadium in Detroit , where Monaghan had dispatched a helicopter to whisk the aspiring entrepreneur to the Domino ' s home_office in Ann Arbor , Mich . A year later , Higa walked away with exclusive franchise rights for Japan . He opened his first Domino ' s in 1985 . Higa had a devil of a time , however , persuading his bankers , as well as his own Japanese executives at his Y . Higa Corp . trading company , that the venture would fly . At the time , the only Japanese familiar_with pizza were college women , according to Higa ' s research . Pepperoni was unheard of in Japan . Higa succeeded by sticking closely to the Domino ' s formula and making just a_few changes to suit Japanese tastes . For starters , he shrunk the diameters of the pies to 10 inches and 14 inches from 12 inches and 16 inches . In addition to American-style toppings such_as Italian sausage and pepperoni , Domino ' s Japan also offered local favorites such_as squid , scallops and corn . Higa almost single-handedly created a booming business in pizza . Higa ' s Domino ' s franchises average about $ 1 million a year in sales -- about twice the U.S. average . Higa would not disclose profits , but his pizza business was growing 20 % to 40 % annually until last year , when recession curbed demand . And fending off the Pizza Hut assault won ' t be a cinch . For one thing , Domino ' s meteoric success has attracted plenty of newcomers . About 20 major pizza chains in Japan are now discounting prices to draw customers amid the current economic slump . Some of the firms &quot; might even go bankrupt , &quot; said Toshiko Binder , an analyst for S . G . Warburg , the_British brokerage_house . So far , Domino ' s hasn ' t budged from its standard pizza price of roughly $ 17.85 , though the chain is running promotions of side_dishes and drinks . Also , Higa will be at a decided disadvantage to brother-in-law Okawara when it comes_to financial resources . Privately held Higa Corp. ' s sales are close to $ 300 million , but publicly traded KFC Japan ' s revenue is more_than twice that . Executives back at Domino ' s home_office aren ' t too concerned , however . &quot; ( Higa ) is really a beacon for Domino ' s , and flies to the United States at least once a year to pick_up a boatload of awards at our annual franchise meetings , &quot; a Domino ' s spokesman said . &quot; If we could clone Ernie Higa , we would. &quot;</TEXT>
