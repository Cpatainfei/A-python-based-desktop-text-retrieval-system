   <HEADLINE> ENTREPRENEUR ' S GOOD SCENTS BROUGHT HIM THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS ; AROMATHERAPY : RIVALS LAUGHED_AT HIS IDEAS ON THERAPEUTIC VALUES OF AROMAS . NOW THEY COPY HIM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Horst Rechelbacher didn ' t realize he was planting the seeds of an aromatic empire when 20-odd years ago he whipped_up his first batch of homemade clove shampoo . Noses wrinkled over the pungent , murky concoction intended for his small chain of hair salons . But that didn ' t stop the Austrian expatriate from preaching the gospel of aromatherapy -- the belief that essences of plants and flowers have therapeutic benefits . At age 52 , Horst ( as he prefers to be called ) is basking in the sweet smell of success . The founder and chairman of Aveda Corp . oversees a 400-employee dominion credited with popularizing aromatherapy in America . Although the privately owned company won ' t release sales figures , it does say it has enjoyed strong double-digit growth annually for the past 15 years . In 1990 , one report had it doing an estimated $ 200 million in retail sales . &quot; I think Horst was ahead of his time , definitely , &quot; says John Steele , a California aromatherapist who has done consulting for Aveda . &quot; that ' s one of the reasons his company has done so well . He had the sense_of_smelling the future. &quot; * Aveda is an interesting mix of old-fashioned capitalism and conscientious naturalism . More_than 25 # 000 salons , spas and flagship stores called &quot; esthetiques &quot; carry its products ranging from shampoos and cosmetics to &quot; purefumes &quot; and sunscreen . A spa in Osceola , Wis. , for example , delivers flower-essence massage and hydrotherapy , among other indulgences using Aveda products . Horst ' s interest in the natural began early . His mother was a herbalist , someone who grows or uses herbs . A visit he made to India in the 1960s inspired his decision to make_pure products out of herbs . Aveda , derived from a Sanskrit phrase meaning &quot; the wisdom of nature , &quot; has found devotees among the famous : Elizabeth Taylor and Goldie Hawn have worn its basil-based lipsticks , and Princess Diana has reportedly dabbled_in aromatherapy to curb her nail-biting . But the renewed belief in the power of scent has created its own problems for Horst , who recently dumped aromatherapy in favor of what he calls a more distinguishing term : &quot; aromaology. &quot; &quot; I need to survive in business , &quot; he says . &quot; I saw myself become diluted and polluted by companies that didn ' t care about what I cared about in manufacturing . They just wanted to make a profit. &quot; Horst is the first to admit that aromatherapy has been around long before he helped popularize it . Many ancient cultures , including the Egyptians , the Aztecs and Chinese , documented the use of essential_oils to treat physical disorders . * Indeed , the three Wise_Men ' s gifts to a celebrated baby included frankincense and myrrh , said to calm the nervous_system and evoke inner strength . Aromatherapy revolves_around absolute essences -- plant ' s molecular gases . A distillation and evaporation process breaks the plant down into liquid form . It takes 4.5 million jasmine petals to create just 450 grams , or nearly a pound , of its essential_oil . In Aveda ' s fragrant aroma lab , Ko-Ichi Siozawa dips a testing stick into a vial of frankincense . The stuff is tart , clean-smelling . Siozawa , Aveda ' s chief perfumer with more_than 25 years of experience , works with essential_oils that come from all_over the world : roses from Bulgaria , oak moss from the former Yugoslavia , myrrh from Somalia , pimento from Jamaica , to name just a_few . Working at Aveda is different than working for a more mainstream perfumer . &quot; Virtually all_of the formula of a regular perfumer consists_of chemicals . I have to forget all that , &quot; he said . Although science has yet to document medical benefits from aromatherapy , studies have shown that scents do alter moods . A study at Rensselaer Polytechnic_Institute in Troy , N.Y. , found pleasant fragrance can improve one ' s demeanor . Scientists at the University of Cincinnati determined that volunteers who inhaled peppermint scents while working_on computer tasks made fewer errors than those in an unscented control group . Dr. Richard Costanzo , a neurologist at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond , says a strong link between emotions and smell isn ' t surprising . &quot; It ' s a powerful sense and deals more with emotions and feelings , &quot; Costanzo said . So why is the sense_of_smell undergoing a renaissance ? &quot; Smell was neglected before . It was the sense that was used for seduction , allure , power , &quot; said Steele , an archeologist until he discovered plant essences . &quot; The aromatherapy movement is based on healing rather than image , balance and restoration of the body ' s innate capabilities . . . . Using fragrance to alter moods , not just to make an impression on somebody else. &quot;</TEXT>
