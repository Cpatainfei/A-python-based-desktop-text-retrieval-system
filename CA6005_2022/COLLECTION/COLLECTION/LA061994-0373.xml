   <HEADLINE> REVIVAL ON BROADWAY ; WITH THE HELP OF WALT DISNEY CO. , TIMES SQUARE IS STAGING A COMEBACK . BUT SOME FEAR THE LOSS OF THE DISTRICT ' S SOUL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For two decades after it opened in 1903 , the New Amsterdam Theatre was nothing less than the high temple of popular entertainment in America . New York ' s colorful social elite and the city ' s burgeoning middle_class flocked to the spectacular Art Nouveau building on 42nd Street , eager to see the beautiful &quot; girls &quot; of the Ziegfield Follies , hear the latest musicals from Irving Berlin or drink and dance in the roof_garden theater . For the owners , the Theatrical Syndicate , the New Amsterdam was both a glamorous showcase and a creative launching_pad -- the crucial link in a chain of more_than 500 theaters across the country . And it firmly established 42nd Street and soon-to-be-named Times Square as the theatrical and entertainment_center of New York . Today , the once-proud New Amsterdam is a ruin , its cracking terra-cotta ornaments , faded murals and decayed plaster moldings forming a depressing metaphor for the decline of Times Square . It shares a block with eight other historic but crumbling theaters in a neighborhood better known locally for crack pipes than night life . But city officials and business_leaders are ecstatic over the prospect of a revived New Amsterdam -- one that would be an altogether different kind of metaphor for the &quot; Crossroads of the World. &quot; Walt Disney Co. , with a big subsidy from the state of New York , has tentatively agreed to renovate and occupy the theater , a project that promises to boost a long-delayed and highly controversial effort to redevelop 42nd Street . &quot; With Disney coming , we have been bombarded with proposals from entertainment companies , &quot; says Rebecca Robertson , president of the New York state agency spearheading the redevelopment effort . &quot; This is part of the renewal of our economy . Entertainment is a burgeoning business , New York has to be a part of that , and Times Square is a logical place for it. &quot; If all goes according to plan , the area stretching from 42nd St . to 53rd St . and from 6th avenue to 8th Ave . will again be a colorful , exicting , and unique montage of interesting attractions and fascinating people . Yet it seems unlikely that Times Square can ever regain its place as the hub of the nation ' s entertainment_industry . Today , popular culture is driven by the movies , recorded music , fashion and the merchandising spinoffs those industries generate . New York , along with Los Angeles , is an important hub for all these businesses . But the intricate cultural dynamics of the entertainment_industry have changed radically since the glory days of Oscar Hammerstein , the Shubert brothers and the Theatrical Syndicate , which together with the New York Times invented Times Square . What the new Times Square can probably never be is the pre-eminent creative center , the trendsetter , the place to see and experience the new , the daring and the completely different . There was a time when the musicians of Tin_Pan_Alley , the actors of the legitimate stage and the comedians of vaudeville were cultural beacons to the nation and the world -- among other things , feeding story lines and performers to the nascent movie business . In the 1990s , instead , comes the clean , ordered , family-oriented world of Disney , featuring carefully packaged entertainment such_as &quot; Beauty and the Beast , &quot; the theatrical version of the hit animated film that is currently playing to sellout audiences on Broadway . Today ' s theater audiences skew heavily toward tourists and suburbanites . Creative development , as often as not , takes_place in California and many other places across the country . &quot; Instead of being a place to generate something , it ' s a place to see the end_product , &quot; says Margaret Knapp , a professor of theater at Arizona State University who wrote a doctoral dissertation on the 42nd Street theaters . &quot; It ' s a place to see the latest London musical or a play that was successful in another part of the country. &quot; Still , for New York City , reinventing Times Square as a vibrant entertainment showcase and a corporate home for the entertainment_industry would represent a major economic boost -- and a big improvement over the status_quo . The glamorous night life and safe but sinful diversions of the old Times Square -- always as much myth as reality -- gave_way decades ago to the incongruous mix of a staid Broadway theater culture on the one hand and a grim , drug-laced sex industry on the other . By the late 1970s , Times Square had become something of a civic embarrassment , with filthy streets and a sky-high crime_rate . In 1980 , the city and state launched the 42nd Street redevelopment project . Like almost any major civic project in this contentious town , the effort quickly got bogged down in political bickering and lawsuits . And the economic slump in the late 1980s nearly killed it entirely . But now the project is moving , just as private development efforts toward the northern end of Times Square are bearing fruit . The dark side , ruled by pornography and crime , is down if not out . Families and tourists and mainstream entertainment are in . Public officials and local business folk can hardly contain their glee . &quot; This will be one of the wonders of the world , &quot; gushes restaurateur Artie Cutler , whose three new Times Square establishments have been playing to packed houses . &quot; People from all walks_of_life will be coming here. &quot; In addition to Disney , companies ranging from Warner Music to Madame Tussaud ' s Wax Museum are scrambling for space on 42nd Street . Bertelsmann Music Group , the German media giant , has bought a 52-story office tower in the heart of Times Square ; Virgin Records will occupy much of the 150 # 000 square_feet of retail space in the building . At Viacom Inc. ' s 56-story headquarters across the street , other tenants are being pushed_out as Viacom absorbs Paramount Communications . David Letterman ' s CBS &quot; Late Show , &quot; housed a_few blocks_up Broadway , is building a veritable cult around its neighborhood . Even the troubled theater business is enjoying a modest revival . While the precise economic impact of all this is difficult to measure , it is clearly salutary . For one thing , tourism is an increasingly important industry in a city that has been losing businesses of all stripes for years . Times Square has no less than 12 # 500 hotel_rooms and 220 restaurants , and Broadway theaters generate $ 2.3 billion in local business , according to a recent study by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . Local officials and business_leaders say the new , cleaned-up Times Square will be able to retain the diversity of uses -- and at least some of the colorful subcultures -- that have always made_it unique . &quot; Disney-fication , &quot; however , clearly has its dangers . Some here fear that the gains for the city ' s pocketbook will come at the expense of a part of its soul . Cora Cahan , the ebullient president of New 42nd Inc. , a nonprofit group charged with overseeing the renovation of six historic theaters , firmly rejects the notion that redevelopment means a bland , antiseptic Times Square . &quot; This street will be for everyone -- young and old , New Yorkers and tourists , &quot; she says . &quot; We ' re looking_for uses that don ' t replicate existing things , that are appropriate to New York and appropriate to New York as an entertainment center. &quot; Gazing down at 42nd Street from Cahan ' s office , one would think she would be happy to find any uses at all . The long block between 7th and 8th avenues , the original heart of the theater district , is a bleak urban moonscape , home to dozens of empty buildings and boarded-up theaters . At one end of the street is a clutch of X-rated video stores and peep shows , remnants of the 140 sex-related businesses that inhabited Times Square in the late 1970s . The sex industry has a long history in the area -- and arguably forms part of its appeal for some visitors -- but it is considered a pariah by the Establishment . The number of sex businesses now stands at just over 40 , and efforts continue to whittle the number . Along the rest of 42nd Street today , there are only blank marquees and crumbling facades , grimy reminders of a glorious but distant past . That past began near the turn_of_the_century , when theatrical entrepreneur Oscar Hammerstein -- in search of cheap land and confident that the city ' s theater district would continue to creep northward -- built the first theater in the district known as Longacre . Live theater ruled the entertainment kingdom then , and New York ruled the theater . It was big business , big enough to support construction projects such_as the Hippodrome , a three-stage complex that occupied an entire city_block and seated 6 # 000 . New York producers such_as Hammerstein ( grandfather of the lyricist of &quot; Oklahoma &quot; and other musicals ) , together with the Shuberts and the half-dozen partners of the Theatrical Syndicate controlled thousands of theaters across the country , pioneering the so-called combination , or road_show , with productions &quot; direct from New York. &quot; There were spectacular restaurants on_Times Square too , such_as Rector ' s ; there were the &quot; roof_gardens &quot; atop many of the theaters , where drinking and dancing went_on to the wee hours , and on the side streets there were brothels , some so busy they had lines outside the doors . But the heyday of legitimate theater and vaudeville -- the intimate art_form that combined comedy , music and even acrobatics -- proved short-lived . Prohibition was the first blow , altering the economics of live entertainment and driving many impresarios into bankruptcy . The decisive change , however , was the arrival of motion_pictures . By the 1930s , the movies had thoroughly displaced the theater as the main form of popular entertainment , and most of the theaters on 42nd Street were converted to movie_houses . In live performance , only burlesque -- the predecessor of the modern strip club -- continued to thrive . Initially , there was an intimate relationship between the film_industry and Broadway . Movie palaces such_as the Paramount and the Strand were the jewels of the theater chains , while creative talent crossed easily from one medium to another . And movies did much to create the mythology of Times Square . Ultimately , though , Hollywood became the undisputed center of the film business , and theater continued to wither . Once there were hundreds of major playhouses in New York ; today , there are just 37 Broadway theaters , and about a third are dark at any given time . Business has been relatively good this year , with total attendance at its highest level since 1988 . Compared to the movie_industry , though , Broadway theater is tiny , with less than $ 400 million a yearin revenue . And doomsayers fear that high costs , archaic union work rules and antiquated management practices assure a continued downward slide . Some hope that Disney , as a powerful outsider , will shakethings up , perhaps taking_on the unions and introducing more sophisticated promotion and marketing techniques . There have already been a_few skirmishes with unions over &quot; Beauty and the Beast. &quot; But Broadway ' s problems run deep . &quot; The new generation is not theater-oriented , &quot; laments Emanuel Azenberg , a prominent Broadway producer . &quot; And we have an economic structure that is completely impossible . Seventy-five dollars to go_to a musical ? . . . A part of the American cultural scene is going_away forever. &quot; The premise of the redevelopment effort is that the cultural scene is simply changing , and that Times Square must put itself in the way of those changes . Nothing symbolizes that better than the 42nd Street project , conceived as a way to reclaim a historic block that succumbed years ago to peep shows , drug dealers and prostitutes of every description . When the state Urban Development Corp . first put forth its blueprint back in 1984 , many of Times Square ' s denizens were horrified . The state proposed forcibly buying_out the property_owners on the block between 7th and 8th . Four key parcels at 42nd Street and 7th Avenue , the heart of Times Square , would be the sites for four massive office towers . The towers were to be built by private developers , who would get tax_breaks and pay the state $ 241 million , which in turn would be used to buy the other properties and finance the rehabilitation of the theaters . But the Philip Johnson-designed buildings were harshly criticized as too_large and out of step with the spirit of the area ; 47 lawsuits were filed to block the project . By the time those were resolved , the real_estate and financial services depression of the late 1980s had ruined the market for office space in mid-town . Three new office towers toward the northern end of Times Square ended_up in bankruptcy . In 1993 , the city and state came_up with an interim plan that delayed construction of the four office towers and put a renewed emphasis on retail and entertainment . It was_well received , especially by those who had opposed the office towers in the first place . ( The developers are expected to sign_off on the plan later this summer. ) In the meantime , the three bankrupt buildings became cheap enough to attract tenants : Two were acquired by Morgan Stanley and the third by Bertelsmann . Still , a critical question remained : Would private-sector retail and entertainment companies be willing to invest in 42nd Street -- especially in old theaters that would require extensive renovation ? And what kind of terms would they demand ? A big part of the answer came_in January , when Disney Chairman Michael D . Eisner , flanked by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov . Mario Cuomo , announced that the entertainment giant would take_over the New Amsterdam . &quot; We ' re going to get_rid_of the filth and bring_back the old values , &quot; cooed Cuomo . &quot; This is the beginning of a whole new era. &quot; But Disney did not come cheap . The state will make a $ 21-million loan at 3 % interest , while Disney will put_up $ 8 million . And the deal is only preliminary ; Disney still could walk away if the renovation proves too expensive or if the company isn ' t pleased with the way development on the rest of the block is proceeding . &quot; What ' s happening on the balance of the street is very important , &quot; says David Malmuth , senior_vice_president at Disney . &quot; We need to have good neighbors. &quot; However , the Disney announcement did have its intended effect . Cahan and Robertson have been inundated with proposals for everything from nightclubs and music studios to virtual_reality attractions . They refer to two periods in their redevelopment effort : BD ( before Disney ) and AD . Meanwhile , Cahan ' s organization is renovating the Victory Theatre , across 42nd Street from the New Amsterdam , for children ' s performances . And the arrival of thousands of new office workers is giving a big boost to the restaurant and retail businesses . &quot; Times Square is cleaner and safer and friendlier , but it hasn ' t lost its soul , &quot; says Gretchen Dykstra , president of the Times Square Business Improvement District . Her organization , whose street_cleaners and security_guards supplement the city ' s , is credited with helping the district ' s revival . In the long_run , Times Square could indeed end_up a vibrant , economically successful mix of office_buildings on the one hand and big retail_stores and entertainment venues on the other . But the challenge is whether it can do so without losing all that has made_it unique . And soul can be in the eye of the beholder . Though the famous news &quot; zipper &quot; still circles the Times Tower , the building is vacant -- and may well be torn_down to make_way for Madame Tussaud ' s .</TEXT>
