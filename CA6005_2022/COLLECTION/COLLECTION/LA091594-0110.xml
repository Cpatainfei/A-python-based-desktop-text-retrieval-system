   <TEXT> Josefina Hernandez Gomez did not have much to go_home to . On the day last year when she and her extended family were driven into exile , Hernandez ' s hateful neighbors burned their tiny houses and stole the chickens and sheep . The unattended radish and corn crops rotted . But Hernandez and her family , defying threats of death , did return . They sleep_in the fertilizer shed while starting to rebuild . &quot; They burned everything . Our mattresses . The Singer sewing machine , &quot; says Hernandez , a 26-year-old Mayan mother with a baby slung over her back and two daughters at her feet . &quot; They threw us out because we believed_in God. &quot; For two decades , powerful pro-government Chamula Indian leaders in this fertile , isolated swath of southern Mexico ' s Chiapas state have violently expelled members of their pious , conservative community who dared to differ . Those who converted to Protestantism or , worse , to opposition politics -- those who challenged the established order in any way -- were cast_out . At least 25 # 000 people , more_than a third of the community ' s population of 70 # 000 , have been expelled , according to human_rights activists . And all seemed to accept their fate , until now . Inspired by a Mayan rebellion earlier this year that shook Mexico to the core , hundreds of Chamula exiles have taken matters into their own hands and for the first time are returning home . Their perilous action reflects a new militancy among Indians here that may be the most significant legacy of the Zapatista National Liberation Army , the rebel band whose Jan . 1 uprising sounded the call_for democracy and indigenous rights . The return challenges the traditional leaders , known as caciques , who run San Juan Chamula and other Indian towns in southern Mexico like small fiefdoms . And ultimately , it challenges the ironclad way Mexico ' s ruling party has controlled this rural region for decades . &quot; It is not so easy anymore for the government to cover the sun with a finger , &quot; said Domingo Lopez Angel , one of the first Chamulas to be expelled in 1974 and now an opposition activist . &quot; The Indian is rising_up . We will no longer let ourselves be fooled . We have seen ( a change ) , thanks to our Zapatista companeros , who had the courage to awaken the country. &quot; The Chamula are one of several Mayan clans who live_in the Chiapas highlands of southern Mexico , each with its distinctive customs and dress . The Chamula women , for example , wear embroidered blouses and black blankets wrapped as skirts ; the men wear black or white sheepskin tunics . Since the 1960s , an arrangement has existed between the authoritarian Indian caciques and the regional bosses from Mexico ' s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , who found they could control the indigenous communities by buying_off their leaders . The caciques benefited from government patronage , including land_grants , and were allowed to make money , build empires and manage their towns as they saw fit . In exchange , the caciques provided unanimous vote counts for the PRI at every election . As time went_on , the Chamula leaders saw any change as a threat to their traditions , their community and their hold_on power and wealth . San Juan Chamula earned a reputation as a place hostile to all outsiders . Although the Chamula conflict is often portrayed as a holy war between Roman_Catholics and Protestants , it is , in fact , more complex . Religion , politics and economics are inextricably intertwined . The leaders have said the exiles were expelled because they had become born-again_Christians whose religion threatens the syncretic brand of Catholicism practiced in San Juan Chamula and the community ' s traditional dress , ceremonies and customs . Many of the exiles , as well as anthropologists and other experts , say religion is being used as a pretext for expelling political_dissidents and nonconformists . The first Chamulas to be expelled in the early 1970s were taken_in by American missionaries in the region ; many were converted to Protestant faiths . They settled in shantytowns on the outskirts of the nearest city , San Cristobal de las Casas , towns with names like Bethlehem and New Jerusalem . The largest , which climbs the side of a muddy hill , is called The Ant . Those who have converted reject many of the rituals the caciques demand . Members of the Chamula community are required to supply expensive religious_festivals with thousands of candles , gallons of Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola , and moonshine called &quot; pash , &quot; which is consumed in large quantities . Not coincidentally , the caciques and their lieutenants control the distributorships for all_the items required in the ceremonies . &quot; They wanted us to buy the booze , &quot; Hernandez said in broken Spanish , switching to her native Tzotzil language to speak_to her relatives . &quot; They like people to get drunk. &quot; Hernandez ' s father , Juan Hernandez Heredia , owns four plots of land here on the sweeping hillsides of Cuchuluntic , a hamlet that is part of the larger San Juan Chamula municipio , or county . The Hernandezes say they were expelled because of their religious_beliefs and because they refused to go_along with the ceremonies -- but several posters for an opposition candidate hang_on their fertilizer shed . Last September , a woman from the town came_to warn them . If they didn ' t leave by the morning , they would be dead . They knew others before had been killed , the women raped . The Hernandez family fled to the nearby hills and waited until dusk . As neighbors doused the Hernandez property with gasoline , the family walked for three hours to San Cristobal , joining 580 Chamulas expelled during a four-month period last year . But unlike the thousands who had gone before them , the group decided to fight . First they occupied the San Cristobal headquarters of the federal_government ' s Indigenous Affairs Office . Then , taking their cue from the Zapatista rebel leader known as Subcommander Marcos , and to the shock of the caciques and the regional PRI leaders , the Chamulas in July kidnaped Domingo Lopez Ruiz , the mayor and a principal cacique of San Juan Chamula . Two people were killed in a shootout to free the mayor , who was freed later . The Mexican government , already badly shaken by the Zapatista uprising that left 145 people dead and focused international attention on the plight of Mexico ' s impoverished Mayans , was eager to negotiate . The government paid the exiles $ 150 # 000 for their lost crops , and is considering awarding $ 70 # 000 more for property damage . Still , no formal agreement for their return was reached . Exhausted and frustrated , the exiles decided to forgo further negotiations and test their luck . Two days before national elections last month , more_than 500 people rounded_up their few remaining sheep , boarded government trucks and went_home . Hernandez Heredia said he and his family were greeted with &quot; silence &quot; from the neighbors , but no violence so far . This time , however , they are prepared : Using some of their reparation money , they bought walkie-talkies and set_up a warning system among the returned exiles . This time , they say , they will defend themselves if neighbors or the caciques ' henchmen come_after them . &quot; Marcos encouraged us to organize well , &quot; Hernandez Heredia , 48 , said , standing by the charred wood and crumpled bricks of his old home . &quot; If they come_back to attack us , it will not be the same as before . We have weapons -- stones , slingshots , sticks . We are ready . The time we would let ourselves be stepped_on like mice is over . We are not afraid. &quot; He paused to speak on the walkie-talkie in Tzotzil to a fellow returnee down the road . They are hoping to raise enough money through their church and elsewhere to buy more radio units . If the Chamulas are successful in returning and defying the traditional power_structure , they could force permanent changes in their local_government . And gradually , the PRI ' s absolute control of the region could begin to deteriorate . The changes so far are incremental . In the Aug . 21 voting for president and other offices , a real election was held_in San Juan Chamula for the first time . In previous years , the caciques did not allow opposition political_parties or independent election monitors into town ; the entire community voted as one , and always for the PRI . This year , representatives of other parties were present on voting day . The PRI ' s margin declined to 85 % of the vote . A small victory , but a start , say the returning exiles . Hernandez and his family could not participate , however , because their voter-identification cards had been burned when their homes were destroyed . Speaking with remarkable candor , Gustavo Moscoso , the regional head of indigenous affairs for the Mexican government , said much of the problem in San Juan Chamula and other Indian villages has been the complicity between PRI party_bosses and the caciques . Government officials rarely dared challenge the cacique rule as long as the PRI votes kept coming . Those days are ending , he said . &quot; In Mexico , we are living through a change , &quot; said Moscoso , who assumed his job in February , after the governor of Chiapas and his administration were fired in the wake of the Zapatista rebellion . &quot; The indigenous communities now know what their rights are and that laws exist. &quot; Some experts argue the caciques ' fear of the onslaught of evangelism has some justification . As the population grows and land becomes scarce , the new religions have eroded some traditions that Chamulas had fiercely guarded since Friar Bartolome de las Casas converted them to Catholicism in the 16th Century . &quot; They see Chamula as a fragile vessel , that their way_of_life is contained in it . . . ( and ) that they were handed this vessel by their ancient ancestors , &quot; said Jan Rus , an anthropologist from Claremont , Calif. , who has written extensively on the Chamulas . &quot; They see it in their language , in the saints they venerate , in their territory. &quot; But Rus and others say that in recent years the expulsions took_on a more violent , witch-hunt tone that clearly targeted dissidents and reformists . To describe the Chamula conflict as a religious one oversimplifies it . Still , the religious practices of the two sides offer stark contrast and highlight their basic differences . Inside the brand-new neon-blue Tzotzil Independent Pentecostal Evangelical Church in Paradise , an exile colony on the outskirts of San Cristobal , hundreds of Chamula men and women crowded onto rough wooden pews on a recent evening for hours of prayer , gospel and song . Some of the women and all_of the men had forgone their native Indian dress for slacks , shirts and dresses -- indicative , the caciques would say , of lost culture . They knelt on the dirt floor and bowed deeply in prayer , chanting and moaning . The nonstop preacher stomped , clapped and shouted , Bible in one hand , an organ and trap drum set alongside him . The long sermons were in Tzotzil , dotted frequently with words in Spanish : &quot; Brothers ! &quot; &quot; Hallelujah ! &quot; and &quot; Amen ! &quot; &quot; Depart from evil , and do_good ; so shall you abide forever , &quot; the preacher read from the Bible . &quot; For the Lord loves justice ; he will not forsake his saints . . . . The righteous shall possess the land , and dwell upon it forever. &quot; Some of the church elders sat facing the wall , sobbing in prayer . Back in San Juan Chamula , the Catholic_Church is unusual , to say the least . It is central to a practice that combines Mayan mystical beliefs with Roman_Catholic traditions . The Catholic diocese in San Cristobal pulled the priest from the church in the late 1970s because it did not want to be associated with the expulsions . So worship is personal and individual . Large signs outside the church warn visitors not to take pictures . Inside , on a recent morning , incense filled the air and pine needles covered the floor , both smells combining with the distinctive waft of cane liquor . Indian men and women sat on the floor in groups throughout the chapel , which has no pews . They prayed to dozens of saints , bedecked in silk and mirrors and standing in glass boxes . Each group of worshipers had placed before it dozens , sometimes more_than 100 , candles of all sizes and colors . They also laid_out bottles of Coke or Pepsi , containers of pash and eggs . One woman held a red-brown chicken by the legs , passing it over the candles , then over the body of a younger_woman seated by her . She held the chicken upside down until it died , then she placed it with the candles . The man next to her struggled to wring the neck of a speckled rooster , which squawked until it died , as the man steadily murmured his prayers . As for the Chamula exiles , politically speaking , they are something of an anomaly . Pentecostal faiths have made inroads throughout Latin_America , but they are usually attached_to conservative movements . The Chamula evangelicals , on the contrary , are essentially revolutionaries . Anthropologist Rus describes the phenomenon as a historical accident . The exiles , even as converts , never lost their political goals of changing the Chamula government . Their ties to the Zapatistas are natural , since both groups emerge from the same community , he said . In addition to the Chamula exiles , there are other signs of new militancy . Indians throughout Chiapas have seized vast acreage since the Zapatista uprising ; even the charcoal peddlers of San Cristobal have adopted the Zapatista name and are fighting for a better location at the local market . &quot; People are realizing their community doesn ' t serve their needs , &quot; Rus said . &quot; They are forging new organizations and getting a sense of themselves as Indians in a caste_system . &quot; What does that lead to ? I don ' t know . Native people want space . The question is , how much are the ( elite ) willing to cede power ? . . . ( The Indians ) have always thought_about how poor they were , how the government screwed them . Then it just suddenly sort of bloomed , and the Zapatistas were the catalyst for that . &quot; That consciousness has an expression now , &quot; Rus said . &quot; It ' s mystical to watch . It ' s like blacks in the South , when they realized ( the civil_rights movement ) might actually work. &quot;</TEXT>
