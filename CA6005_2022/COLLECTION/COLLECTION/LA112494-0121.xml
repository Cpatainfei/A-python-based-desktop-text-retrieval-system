   <HEADLINE> SANTA WILL BE CARRYING SACKFUL OF CD-ROMS ; THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE HOT GIFT ITEMS , AS MORE AND MORE HOME COMPUTERS ARE EQUIPPED WITH MULTIMEDIA_SYSTEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Retailers expect CD-ROMs to be one of the hottest-selling gift categories this holiday season . The trade magazine MacWeek reports 80 % of all personal_computers currently being sold are purchased for the home and have CD-ROM_drives , allowing families to enjoy software that integrates text , audio and sophisticated graphics . For computer owners who do not have a multimedia_system , a variety of easily installed sound kits are available at consumer electronic stores . Once the CD-ROM_drive is installed , the question becomes , what software to buy ? Consumers who grew_up in the B.C. ( before computer ) age will be lost in a maze of titles : interactive games , reference guides and , for everyone from children to adults , educational entertainment products . To help make buying a CD-ROM an easy and enjoyable shopping experience , here are some tips : * Software must be compatible with the computer_system ; before you buy , find_out if the child has a Mac or PC . * To avoid buying a duplicate or similar title , have a list of the child ' s current software in_hand when you go_to the store . Seeing what titles the child has already purchased will also help the clerk guide you to something similar . * Avoid purchasing software that requires a large amount of disc_space or memory ; the disc capacity of many PCs is limited ; insufficient memory can result in slow speed game play or stop the user from loading the program onto the computer . * Consider what type of software title you want to give : education , reference , simulation , sports , action or adventure game . A clerk can explain different types . * Be sure the selected game is appropriate for the child ' s age ; specific age_groups for which the title is designed will be indicated on the package . * Interactive entertainment computer_games are rated on violence , sex / nudity and profanity ; check the package for a seal offering a brief title content description and rating the content on any or all_of the three areas . * Check the price ; software titles are generally available for between $ 29.95 and $ 69.95. The best prices will be at computer superstores , software-only stores or general merchandise / discount_stores . * If possible , view the software program before purchasing to make certain it is what you expect . Most consumer electronic and software only stores have demonstration systems available .</TEXT>
