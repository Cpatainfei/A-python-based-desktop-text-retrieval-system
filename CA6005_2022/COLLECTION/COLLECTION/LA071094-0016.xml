   <HEADLINE> ON THE TOWN : A PASTIME NAMED SUE ; RARE , IT SEEMS , IS THE PERSON WHO TAKES THE FALL WITHOUT TRYING TO PROFIT FROM IT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Once in a lifetime , each of us should spend a month on crutches . To be_on crutches is a cruelly edifying excursion into the small places in the human heart . To be_on crutches is to learn what it is to be Otherly Abled Like Me . To be_on crutches is to see behavior that may_not qualify for the Seven Deadly_Sins but certainly ranks high among the Ten Unpleasant Attributes , like : Callousness . Those who treat you as if you were invisible , letting_go_of a door as you hobble madly to catch_it while it is still open . . . or who resent that you are far too visible and lean_on the car_horn as you struggle to climb or descend from the curb . Cruel wit . I ' ve heard everything from &quot; How ' dja get that , at the Nordstrom sale ? &quot; to &quot; You ' re too old for the Olympics / surfing / that kind of sex. &quot; And cupidity , cupidity , cupidity . &quot; Sue ' em , &quot; said a_couple_of lawyers I know ( the only lawyers I know ) . &quot; You should sue those guys , &quot; said the attendant , who came_out to pump my gas at the self-serve island when he saw my impedimenta . Lawyers yammered at me from the midday television_set , promising that even if my broken foot was my fault , even if I had been driving with a burlap_bag over my head or tap-dancing down the stairs of a red-tagged condo in Northridge , someone owes me money . This , after all , is America . As it happens , it wasn ' t my fault , and the medical_bills are already paid . My only pain and suffering has been answering &quot; What happened to you ? &quot; 20 times a day . And once I gave_up telling the drab truth and relied_on increasingly fanciful answers ( &quot; It ' s nothing , really . Nelson Mandela just stepped_on my foot at the South_African inaugural ball &quot; ) , it was rather fun . What has stayed with me longer than my injury is how the lawsuit has become a part of modern social_relations . It is the nasty flip side of our American faith in perfectibility ; if something is not perfect , it ' s somebody ' s fault , someone must pay . An old friend broke his ankle dancing at his own birthday_party , and even as paramedics carted him away , party-goers were advising him -- some not entirely in jest -- to sue the hostess who had organized the gala . Outrageous California lawsuits are what comedians resort_to when they run_out of jokes : burglars who have sued and won for falling_through a skylight or tripping on a skateboard in the places they were burgling , and a motorcycle thief who took a header in a furrow and collected a half-million from the farmer because the plowed field wasn ' t posted as dangerous . These absurdities feed the clamor for tort reform and endanger legitimate lawsuits that punish the caveat-emptor practices of the careless and avaricious . Patent_medicine was a history of cut-and-run , quick-buck buccaneers until the law and crusading journalism and the FDA arrived on the scene . Sometimes the only way an arrogant company learns a lesson is by counting all_the zeros on the check it has to sign . Still , some things are no one ' s fault . Not all babies are born perfect , despite the best intentions and efforts . Should a valuable vaccine be abandoned because a statistically , tragically predictable few children get ill and die ? How many other children should go unprotected because of that ? Where is the trade-off ? Me , I don ' t think I ' ll sue . But a conciliatory gesture would have been nice . Lunch from a different restaurant every day , delivered as I sat immobilized at my desk . And a sedan_chair and four strong men to carry me home through the streets like a Restoration duchess . Surely that ' s not too_much to ask , when the right lawyer , the right jury might have gotten me $ 2.1 million . I did , however , get something for my pains , something the TV-PI lawyers could never have wrung_out of any jury . After a month on crutches , I had biceps like Spaulding tennis_balls .</TEXT>
