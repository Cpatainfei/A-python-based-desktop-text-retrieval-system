   <HEADLINE> POLICE SWEEPS APPROVED FOR EARTHQUAKE ' GHOST_TOWNS ' ; STRATEGY : DAMAGED AND VACANT BUILDINGS WILL BE EMPTIED OF SQUATTERS , BOARDED_UP AND THEN PATROLLED BY SECURITY_GUARDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Moving to eliminate dangerous quake ghost_towns , a Los Angeles City_Council committee Tuesday authorized police sweeps of the vacant quake-damaged buildings , to be followed by boarding_up and patrolling by private security_guards . The get-tough strategy will begin with a blitz by city building inspectors on Monday to identify which buildings are public safety hazards . The approach was developed by a task_force of city department_heads , who have now identified 13 neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley , Hollywood and Mid City areas where clusters of vacant buildings have become havens for squatters , vandals , scavengers and drug_users . The emergence of the so-called ghost_towns , each with about 10 vacant apartment_buildings or condominium projects , has left neighboring homeowners and merchants fearful that the blight and crime will spread -- and in some cases they already are spreading -- to adjacent communities . &quot; The vandals are coming_into our units even though they are boarded_up , &quot; Pam Nelson , one of 20 townhouse owners at the El Dorado Townhomes in Sylmar , told the committee . She said only eight owners are willing to rebuild their units there . &quot; We ' re stuck and we need security and we can ' t afford security. &quot; With about $ 240 million in local and federal emergency funds , the task_force outlined a 120-day schedule for clearing out , securing and demolishing buildings in the ghost_towns . Some of the costs of sealing up the buildings might be passed_on to property_owners , particularly if federal money is not secured . But to encourage reconstruction where possible , funds also will be set_aside for rebuilding loans to those who cannot secure loans elsewhere . &quot; The task_force is hoping that within 120 days we will have a lot of rebuilding happening , &quot; said Pat Bonino , a chief analyst for the city administrative officer . Even as the Ad Hoc Committee on Earthquake Recovery approved the strategy on Tuesday , members said they remained frustrated that the city could not move faster to demolish problem buildings . &quot; If there is a danger to people , tear the damn things down , &quot; said Councilman Hal Bernson , who heads the committee and has five ghost_towns in his district . &quot; Let ' s get_it done. &quot; The strategy would include the following steps : * Beginning Monday , city inspectors will inspect buildings in ghost_towns to identify structures that are a public safety hazard and are occupied by trespassers . * Owners of buildings deemed hazardous will be sent notices giving them 10 days to clear_out trespassers and board_up and fence their property . * If the owner of a hazardous building does not respond in that time_period , police will clear it of trespassers , and crews will board and fence the property . * Private security_guards will be hired by the city for up_to 120 days to protect those buildings where city officials believe there may be a continuing problem with trespassers . While buildings are being boarded_up , building and safety officials also will speed_up the demolition process for structures determined to be public hazards . City officials say they can begin demolition within two weeks after a building has been identified as a hazard . The city has already demolished 35 severely damaged buildings and is in the process of tearing_down another 75 , city officials said . To pay_for the security measures , Bonino said , the city can use $ 20 million provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and $ 99 million from a federal community development block_grant . Councilman Richard Alarcon , who requested the task_force be formed , asked that the city also press the Federal Emergency Management Agency to reimburse the city for the costs , even though FEMA officials have previously indicated that the problem does not qualify for emergency funds . &quot; The communities are being torn_apart , &quot; he said . If FEMA does not reimburse the city , Bonino said the city will put liens on the problem properties to force the building owners to pay_for the costs . For structures that can be rebuilt , housing officials will urge the Small Business Administration to give top priority to loan_applications submitted by owners of ghost_town buildings . As a last_resort , Bonino said the city has about $ 116 million in local and federal quake recovery and housing money that could be extended as loans to the property_owners .</TEXT>
