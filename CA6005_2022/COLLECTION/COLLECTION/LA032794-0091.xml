   <HEADLINE> CAN MEXICO ' S RULING POLITICAL PARTY SAVE THE STATE , AND ITSELF , FROM BALKANIZATION ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The assassination of the Institutional Revolutionary Party ' s presidential candidate , Luis Donaldo Colosio , last Wednesday is the third major shock to Mexico ' s institutions since the assassination , last May , of Guadala jara ' s cardinal . Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo , in an apparent case of mistaken identity that recalled the drug wars in Colombia , was cut_down at the city ' s airport . The next major jolt came Jan . 1 , with the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas , which struck at the heart of Mexico ' s bid for first-world economic and political status , via the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . The assassination of Colosio , the hand-picked candidate of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , strikes at the PRI ' s hallowed tradition of presidential succession . Colosio , a self-made , 44-year-old economist from the northern state of Sonora , was named the PRI ' s candidate over his archrival , the ex-foreign minister Luis Camacho Solis , who represented the official party ' s left flank . The recourse to violence as an instru-ment of political and social change recalls the first two decades of the Mexican_Revolution . Between 1913 and 1928 , three Mexican presidents -- Francisco I . Madero , Venustiano Carranza , Alvaro Obregon -- as well as two revolutionary leaders , Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa , were cut_down by assassins . The year after the murder of Obregon , in 1928 , saw the rise of the Institutional Revolutionary Party , which has dominated Mexican politics for 65 years and has named all its presidents . The assassination of Colosio by a 23-year-old mechanic and self-styled pacifist with a handgun bought_in the United States poses the most crucial test yet to the PRI ' s ability to shepherd Mexico into the next stage of its still unfolding revolution . Colosio ' s murder in the northern-border city of Tijuana dramatized the great chasm that separates the two Mexicos , the Mexico of poor agrarian states , such_as Guerrero , Oaxaca , Hidalgo and Chiapas , and the Mexico of the industrial north . In his efforts to bridge this chasm , Colosio increasingly invoked the rhetoric of Mexico ' s 1910 revolutionaries : &quot; The hour has come , &quot; he declared in his swing through the north , &quot; to combat inequality , to overcome extreme poverty and guarantee for everyone the right to education , health and dignified housing. &quot; In Monterrey , the capital_of_Mexico ' s industrial white upper_class , Colosio was presented with a doll dressed in Indian clothes , wearing a baseball_cap with the name &quot; Colosio &quot; printed across it . The symbolism could not have been lost on baseball-loving Colosio , a stalwart of northern Mexico ' s private sector , who was gambling all_in repackaging himself as a &quot; president of all_the people &quot; bringing the PRI and the country back to its 1910 revolutionary founding principles . The enormous impact of the Zapatista uprising was predicated on its timing , the week following the ratification of NAFTA . The revolt served to remind Salinas that he could not drag the country into the First World while millions of its peasant farmers lived_in a pre-revolutionary state of poverty and exploitation . The outrage generated by the Zapatistas , and by their articulate spokesman , Subcomandante Marcos , sparked protests and demonstrations in other poor regions of Mexico , protests that are being fanned anew by Colosio ' s assassination . The violence at the opposite border states of the Mexican republic cannot help but invite comparison to the breakup of the former Iron_Curtain states of the Soviet_Union and Yugoslavia . The signs are not encouraging that the PRI can contain the country ' s deepening rifts and contradictions without undertaking radical structural reforms . The enraged and frustrated Mexican poor will no longer settle for a technocrat president along the lines of Miguel de la Madrid , Salinas or the pre-Zapatista Colosio , who had just begun to gain credibility with Mexico ' s poor when he was cut_down . On the other hand , the hard-line industrialists , bankers and landowners who dominate the PRI ' s right are_on the march -- both in Chiapas and in the industrial north . Two-thousand &quot; authentic citizens &quot; of San Cristobal de las Casas gathered two weeks ago to denounce Camacho and the Zapatista rebels and to call_for the ouster of Samuel Ruiz Garcia , Chiapas ' liberation-theologian bishop who was the chief mediator between the government and the Zapatistas . Their hard-line counterparts in Salinas ' Cabinet and inner council are agitating for a candidate who represents their economic and political interests . If the violence accelerates , these hard-liners will seek an authoritarian leader after the mold strongman Obregon . The right-wing backlash is matched by a popular revulsion against the back-room deals that have produced Mexico ' s presidents for the better part of seven decades . As events in the northernmost and southernmost states tug at Mexico ' s center , Salinas will need all his political skills to prevent the polarization of his party and the start of a regional fracturing and balkanization that could turn Mexico into a North_American Yugoslavia . The PRI is fighting for its soul , as well as for the right to continue directing the destiny of 92 million Mexicans. *</TEXT>
