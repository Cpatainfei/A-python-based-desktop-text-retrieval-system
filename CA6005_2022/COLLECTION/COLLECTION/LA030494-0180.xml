   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; SOME SAY PENALTY PROCESS IMPEDES TRADE TALKS ; MARKETS : EX-NEGOTIATOR CALLS SUPER 301 A PROVOCATION TO TARGETED NATIONS . BUT OTHERS SEE IT AS JUST WHAT IS NEEDED TO SPUR JAPANESE CONCESSIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The only other time the American government tried to get_tough with its trading partners through the so-called Super 301 provision of the U.S. trade law , the effort backfired and made talks even harder , a George_Bush Administration negotiator said Thursday . That may contain a lesson for the Clinton_Administration , which is renewing the controversial provision that sets_in_motion a lengthy process that ultimately could result in sanctions against nations that do not open their markets to U.S. goods . S . Linn Williams , a Washington lawyer and former deputy trade representative , said that , when the provision was first invoked in 1989 against Japan , India and Brazil , it did not help . &quot; The government has all_of the tools necessary to investigate trade practices and remedy them without Super 301 , &quot; he said . &quot; What it does is add a poke in the eye , which in 1989 caused a delay in the negotiating process. &quot; Trade retaliation &quot; is a club more effective when it ' s not used than when it is , &quot; noted Michael Smith , former deputy trade representative in the Ronald Reagan and Bush_administrations . Not everyone agrees . Some experts say Super 301 is just what is needed to spur the Japanese into concessions . Clyde Prestowitz , president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington and former counsel to the secretary_of_commerce under Reagan , argues that Super 301 succeeded in 1989 and will do so again in 1994 . &quot; I think it provides an impetus , creates some pressure for negotiation , &quot; he said . &quot; Japan may scream about it and others may pound their chests . . . but that ' s largely letting_off steam. &quot; If the provision does lead to U.S. trade sanctions against Japan , it could be the opening round of a trade war that would be devastating to two nations whose economies are closely intertwined , analysts said . Sanctions , which are at least a year away , would likely be in the form of high tariffs or other barriers on consumer products made in Japan . When the Bush_Administration invoked the provision in 1989 , it never resulted in sanctions . Negotiations ended successfully within 12 months , said Williams , who was the point_man in talks with Japan . At the time , Williams said , he favored the provision as a way to gain leverage in negotiations to open Japanese markets to U.S. satellites , supercomputers and wood products , to win intellectual property protections in Brazil and to open Indian markets to U.S. insurance_firms . In retrospect , he said he believes , invoking the provision was unduly provocative . The targeted nations protested at having to conduct negotiations under duress and Williams said he expended a lot of effort getting_around those protests . &quot; As a tactical matter , a negotiating matter , it was a waste_of_time , &quot; he said . In making the announcement Thursday , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor carefully avoided mention of any specific nations or trading practices to be targeted , saying a final list will be issued Sept . 30 . Some observers said they believe that the delay is meant to give the United States and Japan time to work_out their differences before Super 301 is actually set into motion . But others said they believe that Japan ' s reaction may be so forceful that it will only harden its position in the meantime . &quot; All it adds is rhetoric and a deadline , &quot; Williams said . &quot; It ' s seen as deliberately provocative in Japan and therefore will politicize and irritate a negotiating process that now requires a degree of calmness and pragmatism. &quot; The action could also create problems for the United States under the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , the worldwide trading regime that prohibits unilateral trade actions by member nations . &quot; This piece of legislation is not well liked . . . by any other country in the world . . . . The danger of Super 301 is it leaves the United States open_to charges of unilateralism , &quot; said Smith , who is now president of SJS Advanced Strategies , a trade consulting_firm in Washington . Paula Stern , a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington and former chairwoman of the U.S. International Trade Commission , said it is hard to say whether the provision will help or hurt . On the one hand , the provision &quot; is part of a war of nerves . . . part of the effort to ratchet up the pressure on Japan for change , &quot; she said . On the other hand , the confrontational provision could stall reformist moves within Japan to deregulate the economy and make_it more open_to imports . &quot; I don ' t think ( Super 301 ) will necessarily advance Japan ' s initiatives , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
