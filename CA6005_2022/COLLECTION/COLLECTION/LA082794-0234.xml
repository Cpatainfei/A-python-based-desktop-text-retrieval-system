   <HEADLINE> FULL-SPEED AHEAD ; SCHUMACHER LEADS AGGRESSIVE GENERATION OF FORMULA ONE DRIVERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At 25 , Michael Schumacher is_on track to become Formula One motor racing ' s youngest world champion and Germany ' s first . He is heading into Sunday ' s Belgian Grand Prix with a 31-point lead over his closest rival , Damon Hill of Williams Renault , and almost a home-court advantage on his favorite circuit , the one that launched his spectacular career . The Michael Schumacher fan club has laid_claim to an entire dell near the Spa-Francorchamps circuit with campers , lawn furniture and German flags . Inside , the Benetton Ford quarters smell like success -- or is that the flowers on the hospitality tables ? German , Italian and British reporters trade kisses on both cheeks with Schumacher ' s stylish press aide , sip cappuccino and wait for the man they herald as Ayrton Senna ' s heir . But Schumacher isn ' t having any premature talk_about the championship . He looks as far into the future as the next race and will not be blinded by a promise of victory . That could only derail his nearly palpable concentration , his firm sense of discipline . &quot; I am not world champion now and as long as there is a theoretical chance not to be world champion , I will not think I am world champion , &quot; he said . &quot; This is one part of my discipline which has always kept me on the ground. &quot; Schumacher has a deep tan that sets_off his green eyes and sandy hair . Dressed in jeans and a suede jacket , he looks remarkably relaxed amid the controversies and tragedy surrounding this year ' s competition -- including the death of his idol , Senna , a personal loss and a reminder after 12 fatality-free years that this is , after all , a dangerous sport . Then came the suspension over missing a black-flag penalty at Silverstone during the_British Grand Prix , which the team is appealing . If Schumacher loses the hearing next week , as is likely , he will sit_out the grand prixes of Italy and Portugal . In July , the sport ' s ruling body , FIA , also announced that an investigation of electronic drivers ' aids banned last year had turned_up a launch control in Benetton ' s car . The organization could not prove the Benetton team had used the software , and other teams have since acknowledged that they also left some of the illegal aids in their systems , but do not use them . All now must be out by the Italian Grand Prix . Finally , there was the flash fire that engulfed Schumacher ' s teammate , Dutchman Jos Verstappen , during the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim in July . The FIA has accused Benetton of illegally removing a gas filter and Benetton faces suspension if the FIA finds against the team at a hearing in October . Schumacher does not want to discuss these unpleasant subjects , either . Why talk_about penalties that might not happen ? He has told the German news magazine Focus that it would be unacceptable if it turned_out that the team removed the filter without permission from the FIA and that the missing filter caused the fire . But what does that mean ? Would he leave Benetton ? &quot; There ' s no need to discuss this at the moment , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s not proven in one direction or the other. &quot; At the mention of Senna ' s name he clams_up again . &quot; I had strong feelings for Ayrton . He has been my idol , &quot; he said . &quot; I just can ' t forget what happened . It ' s hard for me to go_through all_the feelings again . that ' s why I don ' t want to talk too_much about it. &quot; But was he robbed by the tragedy of a chance to prove himself against the best ? &quot; It ' s not that I was robbed , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s a shame Ayrton did not have the opportunity to drive the championship through to the end . . . . On the circuit , there ' s still competition going_on . I would say good competition . Certainly not as_good_as it was before. &quot; It is apparent that Schumacher ' s relaxed demeanor is part of his discipline . He works_at putting these issues out of his mind , out of the way of his driving . He is dressed casually , but on closer inspection his casual leather shoes and belt and jacket look beautifully put_together and he seems , well , intensely calm , if that is possible . He is cool , deliberate in choosing his words , very polite . Perhaps this is Schumacher ' s guard against early fame and success , for which he says he was completely unprepared . He knows that he cannot allow himself to be thrown_off course by the money and glamour , or by controversy . Schumacher grew_up in Kerpen , near Cologne , the son of a mason who encouraged him in Go-Kart racing , but who could not afford to finance Formula racing . Schumacher says he was &quot; lucky to have had very basic parents &quot; with whom he enjoyed a good relationship -- one he credits with keeping him on an even keel today . He graduated from karting to Formula Ford single-seat cars to Formula Three racing at the end of the 1980s , with financial help from sponsors . In 1990 , he won the German Formula Three championship and then surprised racing observers by signing with the Sauber-Mercedes sports_car team . A year later , Schumacher burst into Formula One at the Belgian Grand Prix when the Jordan team picked him to sit in_for their regular driver , Bertrand Gachot , and he qualified a surprising seventh . Benetton grabbed him , and the next year he won his first race at Spa . This year he has won seven of the first 10 races in a 16-race season , leading a new , younger generation of drivers who are slightly more aggressive than their more experienced predecessors . Other teams are skeptical of Schumacher ' s meteoric rise . &quot; We all know that Benetton is cheating the whole time , &quot; Frank Williams , chief of the Williams Renault team was quoted as saying in Stern , the German weekly magazine . Benetton team manager Joan Villadelprat responds that others are jealous . Schumacher attributes his success to discipline . Fitness is the key to his concentration , he says . He works_out five days a week in the winter , three or four in the summer , keeps a tough regimen of cycling for the heart , muscle exercises for the neck and back to hold his head around high-mach corners , and stretching . He eats healthy food , feels guilty over an occasional wurst and pommes frites , and sleeps eight to 10 hours a day . &quot; I have always wanted to be more fit than necessary . . . for any circumstances , &quot; he said . &quot; I didn ' t want to be fit just through the end of the race . I wanted to be fit even if I had the flu , if I ' m under pressure and need more concentration than under normal times . I think that ' s why under tough moments , I perform normally and don ' t have the break people expect. &quot; Disciplined in work and determined to relax . Balance is crucial . &quot; I think it ' s very important that you don ' t lose the normal things , &quot; he said . &quot; And if you suddenly can ' t enjoy yourself with the normal things , just looking_at the sky and seeing the moon or the stars , then I think you have a problem. &quot; So Schumacher walks his dog and spends time alone with his fiancee , Corinna Betsch . He lived_in Germany until the fans and publicity overwhelmed him . After one autograph-seeker barged into his living room through a terrace door while he was watching television , he moved to Monaco . &quot; So many famous people live there that when I went there , I wasn ' t a famous_person , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s changing a little now , but not in a way that upsets me. &quot; He wasn ' t looking_for fame and was not terribly happy with it at first . &quot; I had to get used to it , cope_with it , &quot; he said . &quot; It was a tough time . But there came a time when I had to decide , either I get used to it or I have to stop doing_it . Because I love the sport so_much , I had to get used to it and even find some excitement from it. &quot; This is part of the maturing of Schumacher that his teammates describe . Team manager Villadelprat , a veteran in the business , says that Schumacher has grown enormously in the three years he has been_on the team . &quot; You can have fast drivers who make a lot of mistakes , who are unhappy to be second when maybe that ' s all they need to win the championship , &quot; he said . &quot; Michael realizes it ' s more important to win the championship than the race. &quot; He likens him to Senna in his interest in the technical side of the sport , and in his cleverness . &quot; He ' s clever enough to wait for the right moment to pass and has the speed of a young kid , &quot; Villadelprat said . &quot; He ' s the type of driver who doesn ' t take too long to go fast . One lap and he ' s in the times. &quot; In public , Schumacher is careful , diplomatic . Asked about the change from Ford to Renault engines announced this week for next season , he tries to thank his winning Ford team while embracing the obviously better Renault . But Villadelprat says that the driver lets his hair down with his teammates , happily joining them for drink at a team party . &quot; He lives with us , works with us . He ' s there to do a job and we ' re there to do a job , &quot; Villadelprat said . &quot; The only way to go 100 kilometers ( per hour ) on a corner is if you feel everyone is behind you . Michael ' s one of the boys. &quot;</TEXT>
