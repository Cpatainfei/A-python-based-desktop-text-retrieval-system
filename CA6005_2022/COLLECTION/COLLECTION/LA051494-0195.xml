   <HEADLINE> STATE HOLDS_FIRM ON DEADLINE FOR ELECTRIC_CARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The California Air Resources Board on Friday unequivocally upheld its revolutionary mandate requiring the auto industry to sell electric_cars in the state beginning in 1998 , despite intense lobbying by major U.S. and Japanese automobile manufacturers . The decision on whether California would go_forward with its requirement to mass-produce the cars had been awaited by thousands of giant industries and small entrepreneurial businesses worldwide , from General Motors and Toyota to Southern California Edison and Chevron . &quot; ( The mandate ) must remain in place , &quot; board Chairwoman Jacqueline Schafer said at the conclusion of the two-day hearing . &quot; There is no doubt that tremendous advancements have occurred since we adopted the ( electric_car ) regulation in 1990 . . . . I don ' t think we want to take any actions that will slow_down or stall this progress. &quot; Beginning in 1998 , 2 % of vehicles sold each year in California by major manufacturers -- an estimated 25 # 000 cars -- must be exhaust-free under the new standard . In 2001 , the sales quota will increase to 5 % and in 2003 to 10 % . The board has the authority to prevent companies that fail to comply from selling any cars in the lucrative California market . The board , meeting in Los Angeles , concluded its marathon review after about 24 hours of public_debate over two days . Because the standard , adopted in 1990 , survived this week ' s crucial review , it is expected to encourage multimillion-dollar investments , especially in California , as auto_makers , utilities , battery producers and others gear_up for production . Although another review is scheduled for 1996 , auto_manufacturers say they soon must begin design of the 1998 models and pilot production of batteries . &quot; The bottom_line is an electric vehicle revolution clearly is being born , &quot; said Malcolm Currie , chief_executive_officer emeritus of Hughes Aircraft and head of Project California , a statewide group of business_leaders trying to foster new industries . &quot; This is a blueprint for environmental and economic revitalization of California. &quot; Most observers had predicted that the mandate would remain intact . But Friday ' s reaffirmation by the board was a relief to California business_leaders , environmentalists and other supporters who feared that the board might give_in to pressure and roll the deadline back . The powerful lobby opposed to it and several newly appointed board_members gave the issue an element of uncertainty . Schafer , appointed by Gov . Pete Wilson in January , said she was impressed by the rapid improvement in batteries and other technology for electric_cars . She said , however , that the hearings revealed other challenging issues , such_as the marketability of the cars and the need for recharging stations and other infrastructure . &quot; There is a lot of work to be done still to bring this about , but I expect that if we follow this course we will meet and exceed our own expectations and those of the car-buying public , &quot; Schafer said . Air quality officials say California would never achieve healthful air without the mandate . Even when considering the extra emissions from power_plants , electric_cars are more_than 90 % cleaner than gasoline-powered cars , the board says . When car_manufacturers realized there was little support for delaying the deadlines , they tried to persuade the board to conduct another review in six months . But the board rejected that request after hearing numerous business and government officials say the uncertainty would stall investments in the electric_car industry . Instead , Schafer said the board will hold routine evaluations of the mandate &quot; if new and compelling information becomes available. &quot; Assemblyman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) who heads the Assembly ' s Transportation Committee , had warned that &quot; investments would dry_up or leave the state if the rule is changed. &quot; Katz and several others said the opposition from the auto industry was driven more by fear that jobs will move from Detroit to California than by concern over technology . The mandate is revolutionary because it does not simply set an emissions target such_as in the past but establishes a sales quota . Each major manufacturer -- GM , Ford , Chrysler , Toyota , Honda , Nissan and Mazda -- must sell 1 # 000 to 7 # 000 electric_cars in the first year . The board believes that mandating sales is the only way to spur large investment by the auto industry and slowly wean drivers from gasoline . In fighting the mandate , auto_makers emphasized that there will be few buyers and downplayed the efficiency of their electric_cars . Although they said the technology has improved in recent years , they contended that it will not progress far enough to mass-produce practical cars by 1998 . Today ' s batteries require recharging within 100 miles , a range the auto industry calls insufficient to generate sales to meet the mandate . They said more efficient batteries , costing $ 30 # 000 to $ 40 # 000 each , are only in prototype form and cannot be ready in large volumes at a reasonable cost of under $ 5 # 000 until 2001 . &quot; we ' ll find a way to comply with the mandate but it won ' t be the way any of us want , &quot; Peter Pestillo , a Ford Motor Co . executive , told the board . But the board ' s staff said its research shows at least one pilot plant in 1995 will be producing advanced battery technology that can offer a range of 200 miles between charges . Battery and fuel_cell manufacturers and utility executives also argued that the technologies were closer at_hand than auto_makers say . Some battery makers described tests in which vehicles traveled well_over 200 miles on a single charge -- twice the current performance of most lead-acid batteries . Many manufacturers also predicted that costs of the advanced batteries would decline sharply , comparable_to what occurred with other new technologies , from microwaves to compact_disc players . * Utility officials said that despite serious challenges , they could be ready in 1998 with recharging stations , plugs_in public parking_areas and other infrastructure needed to support electric_cars . Southern California Edison and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power have pledged to install a home electric charging connection within 72 hours of a customer buying an electric_car . If customers do most of their charging at night , when utilities have unused generating capacity , Edison could charge more_than 1 million electric_cars without new power sources , said Diane O . Wittenberg , Edison ' s manager of electric transportation . &quot; We expect that the average ( electric_car ) will use as_many kilowatt_hours each year as a small house , &quot; she said . Also , in an unexpected disclosure , Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co . said it plans to begin testing an as-yet-unidentified Japanese electric vehicle . Studies funded by the Big Three auto_companies contend that the first generation of electric_cars will cost as much as $ 21 # 000 more_than gasoline equivalents . The board has estimated that electric_cars initially would cost $ 3 # 000 to $ 4 # 000 more .</TEXT>
