   <HEADLINE> MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY ; CALIFORNIA LOSES JOBS WHILE REST OF NATION GAINS ; EMPLOYMENT : PAYROLLS GREW BY A HEALTHY 379 # 000 ELSEWHERE BUT DECLINED IN THE STATE BY 12 # 100 , REFLECTING ITS WOBBLY RECOVERY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Raising new concerns about the state ' s recovery , California began losing employment again last month , even as companies across the country added a higher-than-expected 379 # 000 jobs to their payrolls , the government reported Friday . The Labor_Department also said a separate employment survey shows the U.S. and California jobless rates remaining unchanged in June , with the nation ' s level staying_at 6.0 % and the state ' s at 8.3 % . Orange County ' s jobless rate for May -- the most recent figure available -- was 5.3 % , down from 6.2 % in April , as hiring picked_up in construction , retailing and business services . The June jobless rate , to be released in about two weeks , will likely be higher because of large_numbers of students and teachers who typically seek summer employment . Analysts , focusing mainly on the monthly payroll jobs totals , said the national figures reflect how the economy continues to expand smartly while the state ' s remains wobbly . The U.S. figures &quot; are strong numbers by any measure , with gains in almost every industry , &quot; said Joseph A . Wahed , chief economist for Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco . But California , he noted , suffered a sizable loss of 12 # 100 jobs , with declines spread across most of the state ' s industries . Larry Kimbell , director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project , dismissed the idea that California &quot; is relapsing into recession , but we sure aren ' t showing any momentum toward joining the other states &quot; in economic expansion . Although many analysts see little sign of inflation flaring_up nationally , they said the robust job statistics , combined with the dollar ' s recent weakness , could put renewed pressure on the Federal_Reserve_Board to raise interest_rates for the fifth time this year . The Fed is not expected to move immediately -- its policy-setting committee signaled no intent to raise rates after holding a two-day meeting this week -- but analysts say an increase is increasingly likely later this summer . Most of the U.S. job gains came at restaurants and in other service_industries , including many low-paying and temporary summer jobs . But the figures also include a 34 # 000 increase in factory employment , the biggest monthly jump in that category in more_than four years . * Clinton_Administration officials quickly tried to quell fears of inflation . &quot; Our economy is coming_back on its soundest footing in decades , with more jobs and low inflation , &quot; President Clinton told reporters at the summit of the seven leading industrial nations in Naples , Italy . &quot; In fact , we are leading the world. &quot; The nation ' s 379 # 000 gain in payroll jobs was inflated by various statistical and data-gathering quirks , including the use of a five-week measuring period rather than the usual four weeks . Even if the normal four-week period was used , however , the gain would have been about 300 # 000 , economists said . That is up from an average of 287 # 000 for the first_half of 1994 and a monthly average 194 # 000 for all_of last year . At the same time , average hourly wages inched downward , as did the factory workweek , which has hovered at historically high levels . Factory overtime was unchanged in June , holding_on to a previous decline . &quot; Companies have finally started to cut_back on overtime and hire additional workers , &quot; said Cynthia Latta , an economist with Lexington , Mass.-based DRI / McGraw-Hill . The separate employment survey of U.S. households , which is used to calculate jobless rates , showed big declines in the number of people either working or looking_for jobs in California and the rest of the country . But analysts generally discounted those statistics , attributing the plunging labor_force figures to unresolved problems in some of the new procedures the government is using to gather data . One hopeful sign from that study , however , is that the unemployment_rates for both the nation and the state held steady after posting big declines in May . The U.S. jobless rate , now at a 3 1 / 2-year low , is down from 6.4 % in April , while California ' s rate is down from 9.7 % the same month . Among the 11 big states whose unemployment_rates were reported Friday , California ' s 8.3 % jobless rate remained the highest , followed by New Jersey ' s 7.1 % . North Carolina posted the lowest rate , at 3.7 % , with Illinois coming_in next , at 4.8 % . For California , the 12 # 100 loss in payroll jobs last month was coupled with a downward revision in the job totals for both April and May . All told , it left the state with a meager job gain of 6 # 200 for the first_half of the year . Earlier figures suggested that California was recovering somewhat more robustly after losing , by one estimate , nearly 850 # 000 jobs from mid-1990 through the end of last year . Kimbell said the state now seems to be moving &quot; sideways , &quot; and the stimulus provided by post-earthquake rebuilding efforts appear to have been minimal . Yet various economists see indications that the state economy is strengthening . Ted Gibson , principal economist for the California Department of Finance , said payroll tax_revenues have risen faster than expected . Times staff writer John O ' Dell contributed to this report .</TEXT>
