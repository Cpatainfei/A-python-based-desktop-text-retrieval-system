   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; AMERICANS ADVANCE , BUT MUST FACE BRAZIL ; SECOND ROUND : GAME AGAINST ONE OF THE FAVORITES WILL BE PLAYED IN PALO ALTO ON FOURTH OF JULY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> That rush of warm air felt around the Southland on Tuesday was not another high_pressure system adding_to the heat_wave , but the collective exhaling of the U.S. World Cup team after learning it had advanced to the second round of the tournament . After losing to Romania on Sunday and placing third in Group_A , the United States had to wait while a plethora of possibilities played themselves out before it could be sure its 1-1-1 record would send it through to the round of 16 . The team knew by mid-morning that it had made_it , after the Mexico-Italy and Norway-Ireland games had ended in ties . But then the Americans had to wait several hours to learn the identity of their next opponent . After settling for a 1-1 tie against Sweden on Tuesday , tradition-drenched Brazil will play the U.S. team on a day filled with symbolism in more ways than one : July 4 , at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto . Brazil , the winner in Group_B , won two of its three first-round matches and allowed only one goal . &quot; I ' m psyched , &quot; Alexi Lalas said . &quot; If we want to go_on in the tournament , we have to play against the best. &quot; Never mind that Brazil is the favorite of many soccer experts to win the World Cup and that the next game might be the last for the young U.S. team . The Americans can take some pride in that they met their avowed goal of reaching the second round , for the first time since the first World Cup in 1930 . The United States also avoided becoming the first host team to fail to advance . U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic needed no reminding of Brazil ' s surplus of talent . When discussing the team on Tuesday , Milutinovic held_up his hand when asked how his team would be able to counter Brazil ' s speed and skill , &quot; Please , &quot; he said , feigning exasperation , &quot; You must give me a chance to rest. &quot; The U.S. team will not have a chance to rest_on its laurels . At this point in the tournament , everything the team does is historical for soccer in this country . Its tie_in the first game against Switzerland gave the United States its first point in the World Cup since 1950 , and its surprise triumph over Colombia was the first victory since then . The challenge for the U.S. team is as obvious as it is enormous . Brazil is a giant in the sport and the United States is a tiny team with a slingshot . &quot; we ' ll be prepared because mentally it ' s easier to prepare_for a great team , &quot; Tab Ramos said . &quot; You know you have your work cut_out for you , it ' s very hard and you ' re not expected to do anything . I think that makes_it easier . &quot; I like Brazil a lot . To the people who really like soccer and who have watched the World Cups over the last few years , it ' s almost like you have a little part of your heart that says you want Brazil to do_well because they play soccer so well . You want the best team to win , you ' ve enjoyed watching them the whole time. &quot; Milutinovic might be facing the same problem he had when his inexperienced Costa Rica team played Brazil in the 1990 World Cup . What do you say to your players on the eve of their playing against their idols ? &quot; I tell them , ' Please , no ask_for autographs before the game , ' &quot; Milutinovic said . There ' ll be no such problem with the U.S. team , Milutinovic said , because they don ' t know any of the Brazilian players . The U.S. team watched its fate unfold on television from its hotel in Dana Point . Milutinovic canceled practice so the team could spend more time together and build its &quot; ambiance. &quot; Most players evidenced a respectful optimism . &quot; Just to be in the second round is great , &quot; Lalas said . &quot; It doesn ' t matter who we are playing . The good thing about going_into the second round is that everything is erased . It doesn ' t matter where you finished because there ' s only 16 teams left . We ' ve always talked_about getting_to the second round because it doesn ' t matter who you are playing , and anything can happen. &quot; Milutinovic has managed to imbue this team with his relentless cheerfulness . Even with all he knows and with his knowledge of Brazil ' s awesome power , Milutinovic was steadfast in proclaiming the United States has a chance . &quot; In one game , anything is possible , &quot; he said . Hold that thought .</TEXT>
