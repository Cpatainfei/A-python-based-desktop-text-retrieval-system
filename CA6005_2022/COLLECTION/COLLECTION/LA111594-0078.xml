   <HEADLINE> FEWER STUDENTS COLLEGE-BOUND ; WEST COUNTY HIGH_SCHOOLS LAGGING IN PUPILS ENROLLING AT 4-YEAR CAMPUSES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From Camarillo to Ventura , every high_school in west Ventura County lags behind the state average in the number of graduates going_on to four-year state universities , a new state report shows . Although students at many local schools outperformed their peers across the state on college-entrance exams , fewer of them are enrolling as freshmen in either the University of California or Cal State University systems . And many schools are also falling_short on the number of students taking the rigorous academic courses required for admission to UC . As a whole , only 11.2 % of graduates from Ventura County high_schools enrolled as freshmen in 1992-93 in either the UC or Cal State University systems , fewer than the 14.2 % average statewide . Not only are county high_schools sending fewer graduates to four-year universities , they are also failing to prepare them for college careers . The rate of county high_school students who were studying geometry , learning a foreign language or taking other courses required by UC during 1992-93 was only 42.6 % , compared to 47.4 % statewide , the report from the state_Department of Education shows . At the same time , county students who take college-prep courses are more likely to finish the full regimen of classwork than their counterparts statewide . The numbers indicate that high_school officials are directing only college-prep students into the rigorous courses , said county Superintendent of Schools Charles Weis . &quot; We ' re doing a good job of sorting them , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m not saying that ' s the right thing to do. &quot; Weis said he is also alarmed at the low rate of students going_on to four-year universities . &quot; It means a long-term economic difference for our children , &quot; he said . &quot; We know that in the future , the amount of education you have will be directly related to your income . With our kids having a ( low ) four-year attendance rate , we ' re creating a destiny for them of lower economic wealth. &quot; But Weis and others believe the main reason students are not choosing state universities is the lack of a UC or Cal State campus in Ventura County . &quot; Schools are not accessible , &quot; said Ventura High counselor Bob Collins . &quot; We have no major college campus in Ventura County. &quot; * While some local graduates attend the Ventura satellite campus of Cal State Northridge , many others drive to classes at UC Santa Barbara , UCLA or Cal State Northridge . But commuting is not an option for everybody . &quot; Unless you can afford to live at a four-year university , driving is kind of impossible from Fillmore , or difficult at best , &quot; said Jane Kampbell , assistant superintendent for the Fillmore Unified School District . But moving to a campus means adding the cost of room and board to tuition . And many graduates apparently decide instead to start_out at a community_college , officials said . &quot; It ' s got_to be a matter of money and convenience , &quot; said Pat Chandler , an assistant superintendent for the Ventura Unified School District . While some community_college students later move_on to a state university , a study released in July showed that the transfer rate at Ventura County ' s three two-year colleges significantly trails the statewide average . Only 14.3 % of graduates from Moorpark , Oxnard and Ventura colleges move_on to a state university , compared to 19 % throughout California , according to the report by the Center for the Study of Community_Colleges . The state report that was released today fails to take_account of graduates who attend community_colleges or those who go_on to private four-year colleges or public university in other states . But county school officials said the rate at which students move_on to UC or Cal State is a good indicator of the overall numbers moving_on to four-year schools . The state released its report on California high_schools to give parents and the public a snapshot of how well schools and districts are doing . Besides comparing schools ' success at sending graduates to universities , the state report also used several other measures of performance . * On most of these , Ventura County schools surpassed the state average : * County high_school students had overall higher scores in 1992-93 on the now-defunct California Learning Assessment System exams , or CLAS . * Ventura County had more students scoring above the national average on the SAT and ACT college entrance exams -- 20.8 % compared to 19 % statewide . * The county had a lower dropout rate : About 90 % of local students finish high_school , while only 83.5 % statewide stay in school long enough to graduate . Even though Ventura County students are staying in school , they are taking fewer rigorous academic classes while they are there . In the Oxnard Union High_School District , all_the high_schools except Camarillo High lagged behind the state in the numbers of students taking courses that qualify for UC admission . Camarillo High has a high percentage of students who plan to attend four-year universities , officials said . But at the other four district schools , particularly Channel Islands and Hueneme high_schools , relatively few students plan college careers , Oxnard district Assistant Superintendent Gary Davis said . And the district sees no point in guiding students without college plans into the UC-preparatory courses , Davis said . &quot; If they ' re not planning to go_to a four-year college or university , I would not expect them to enroll in a course_of_study that meets UC requirements , &quot; he said . &quot; Maybe they want to have a different kind of job that doesn ' t require two-year or four-year training . I would hope that we would n ' t ( conclude ) that only students in ( college-prep ) courses are getting a high-level education. &quot; Some school officials disagreed . Ventura High_School counselor Bob Collins said Ventura High encourages all incoming freshmen to take college-preparatory courses , even if they have no plans for college . &quot; What I tell the ninth-graders that are coming_in is that for every UC-type class you do not take , you close a door for yourself , &quot; Collins said . &quot; We encourage them to take them because it opens more doors later on. &quot; Pat McCabe , a state administrator for research and evaluation , acknowledges that many students do not go_on to university . * The UC and Cal State systems currently accept less than 30 % of the state ' s high_school graduates , he said . But even students with no plans for college need some academically rigorous courses , he said . &quot; They need a mix . that ' s all we ' re saying. &quot; Superintendent Weis said it is even more important today than in the past for all students to learn higher-level math and other critical-thinking skills . &quot; There are no more jobs for people that work only with their hands , &quot; Weis said . &quot; It ' s not an either-or thing like we used to have : You ' re either going_to be a mechanic or a brain_surgeon . Even being_on the factory line of Ford you need to understand statistics. &quot; Correspondent Tracy Wilson contributed to this report .
