   <HEADLINE> SHERIDAN WYOMING ; TRUE WEST ; IN BIG SKY COUNTRY , A TOWN WHERE THE COWBOYS ARE REAL AND CARS AREN ' T LOCKED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There had been unpleasantness with her boyfriend . Her ex-boyfriend , she meant . And so this young_woman , a Sheridan resident for all_of her 20 or so years , had straggled downtown to the Mint one slow night recently , there to punch up some Reba McEntire on the jukebox and sulk beneath the ancient tin ceiling and the festival of taxidermy above the bar . The Mint is a long-necked Budweiser kind of place , with a neon bucking bronco on its sign out front , but this gal ( hey , cut me some slack , we ' re in Wyoming here ) ordered a daiquiri and set to brooding , her back to the pool_table . The stuffed animal heads stared blankly at the facing wall ' s faded photos of trophy trout , conquered broncos , anglers , Native_Americans and young wranglers who were now old_men . &quot; Next time , &quot; she said , &quot; I ' m getting a cowboy. &quot; In Sheridan , a woman can make such a pledge . And a stranger can find a bracing taste of the American West . Sheridan , population 13 # 900 , sits at the edge of the Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming ' s northeastern corner , lit by a big sky , animated by historic Main_Street architecture , neighbored by pasturelands , snowy peaks , trout-bearing lakes and streams , working ranches , guest ranches and several monuments to 19th-Century frontier battles ( including the one that killed Custer ) . From above , the hilly , rippling high Plains landscape looks_like the rumpled linen of a great big unmade bed . Yellowstone_National_Park lies 201 miles to the west on Interstate 16 ; Mount_Rushmore lies 280 miles east . So far , the city is largely free_of the artificial sweeteners that have lured so many travelers to showplace cities such_as Bozeman and Livingston to the northwest , in Montana . But the boutiques and all_the rest may be arriving soon . A 700-unit housing_development is proposed on one end of town . Sam Paul Mavrakis , whose family has owned Ritz Sporting Goods in Sheridan for decades , has collaborated with his wife , Carol , to convert an old dairy barn in neighboring Big Horn into a three-room bed and breakfast operation , the Blue Barn , which opened last month . A coffeehouse opened on Main_Street six months ago , and one of the waitresses there has a ring in her nose . Maybe it ' s nothing . The visitors bureau counted a relatively modest 230 # 000 tourists to the area last year , and on any day , when you walk the streets of Sheridan , the people you see are locally grown Westerners . Men with cowboy_hats older than I am . Men and women who use toothpicks after every meal . College_students and high_school graduates passing their summers as wranglers at the Spear-O-Wigwam Ranch in Sheridan , or Eatons ' Ranch in nearby Wolf , or the 14HF Bar in Saddlestring , or the Paradise Guest Ranch near Buffalo . Homemakers who own rifles . And children who sit , unarmed , in public_school classes of a dozen or so students . The place is Western in a refreshingly uncosmeticized way . And , for the record , no more_than 15 minutes after the woman with the daiquiri in the Mint confessed to me her new ambition , an apparent cowboy ambled in and pulled_up a stool next to her . When I last saw them , they were still whispering beneath the glassy animal eyes . Sheridan , named for Civil War Gen . Philip H . Sheridan , was born in 1882 as a grid sketched on a brown paper_bag by entrepreneur John D . Loucks . It is the lowest town in the state , geographically speaking . But , Wyoming being Wyoming , it is nevertheless 3 # 745 feet above sea_level . which makes_it often hot in summer and cold in winter . The most popular roads out of town lead to the Bighorn Mountains , which lead to many things : Fishing , for trout , usually , in scores of lakes and rivers in and around Bighorn National Forest . Hunting for birds and game animals , in season . Hiking and horseback riding , most spectacularly near the snowy peaks of the 137 # 000-acre Cloud Peak Wilderness Area , within the national forest . Snowmobiling and skiing in winter . And the year-round pursuit of wildlife sightings : elk , moose , deer , mountain_sheep , bear , fox and coyote . The most popular roads into town lead to Main_Street , which in the space of seven blocks has 16 buildings on the National Register of Historic Places . For instance : the 1908 Crescent Hotel , which rises on the former site of the original Bucket of Blood saloon , and the 1882 building at 1 South Main , Sheridan ' s oldest building , which once held a general_store and now holds a pharmacy . If you ignore the second-floor &quot; skyway &quot; tunnel that the Best Western Sheridan Center put_across Main a_few blocks north in the 1970s -- a Jetson ' s convenience in a Tumbleweeds town -- it ' s not hard to imagine a wooden boardwalk under foot and horse troughs alongside it . But it ' s more educational to investigate the enterprises that Main and neighboring streets still sustain . At King ' s Saddlery and King Rope , cowboys from miles around come_to buy tools of the trade . Though now retired at 72 , Don King ( no , not the boxing promoter ) has lived_in Sheridan on and off since 1936 and built a reputation as one of the nation ' s premier saddle-makers . The walls jangle with spurs , bridles and belt_buckles , the scent of leather work hangs_in the air , cowbells are sold for use on actual cows , and broad sheets advertise home-grown instruction on barrel-racing and &quot; the three D ' s of goat-tying. &quot; Determination , dedication , devotion . In the back stand stacks of hats and sweat shirts for tourists . In workshops downstairs , leather is sculpted into saddles , and sisal from Africa ( among various substances ) is heated and twisted into rope . King ' s sells about 35 # 000 lengths of rope yearly , most of it these days including nylon , or polyester or polypropylene . Four King sons fill various roles at the store , and a cavernous building in back holds Don King ' s Western Museum . The museum is free . On the day I walked in , Don King himself , a grizzled fellow in a white hat , was at the counter , surrounded by his massive Western artifact collection , which is dominated by more_than 500 saddles . &quot; I just bought six or seven more last weekend , &quot; he confessed . &quot; Old junkers , but I couldn ' t say no . When you get the collecting bug , it ' s just like good whiskey : You can ' t turn it down. &quot; * Across the street , next to the Mint , stands Ritz Sporting Goods . Ritz is proof that Sheridan remains unglamorized -- its looming yellow and green sign will win no prizes for subtlety -- and it may be the only sporting goods store in the nation to open daily at 6 a.m. and feature a counter for coffee drinkers . For several dozen old ranchers , and one boxer dog dozing beneath a display of fishing_poles , the Ritz is where one goes each morning to lament the lack of rain or muse on the triumphs of the high_school football_team . A few blocks away stands the Sheridan Inn , root of all imported civilization in Sheridan . Less than a year after the railroad came_to town in late 1892 , the 62-room inn sprung_up near the tracks at Fifth Street and Broadway . Its design was based , strangely , on a hunting_lodge the architect had visited in Scotland . Buffalo Bill Cody , a part owner and part-time resident for many years , is said to have sat on the inn porch , auditioning acts for his Wild_West show . The hotel closed to lodgers in 1965 , and is now owned jointly by the city and county , but a restaurant continues in the old bar and tours are offered by the Sheridan Heritage Center ( adults : $ 3 ) . The grandest old building in town is the house built by rancher John Kendrick from 1908-1913 , shortly before he became governor and then a U.S. senator . The mansion , now known as Trail End Historic Site , is another piece of strangely foreign architecture -- a three-story Flemish Revival eruption atop a hill over a city park -- and its carefully preserved interior shows just how eager some frontiersmen ( and women ) were to build North_America in Europe ' s image . There ' s Italian marble around the fireplace , stained glass_in the bathrooms , and delicately carved oak on the stairwells . Evidently the pines in these hills weren ' t good_enough for Kendrick . * While some newcomers to the Plains were importing all these trappings of European civilization , of course , others were busy trying to purge the area of its existing civilization : the native nations of North_America . And Sheridan stands_in the middle of some of this continent ' s most contested territory . In the space of just a_few hours over three days , I stopped at several marked old military sites , and took_away a deep impression of the carnage that went_on here in the 1860s and 1870s . * Fort Phil Kearny , now a mostly bare hilltop 20 miles south of Sheridan , was once a 17-acre compound behind eight-foot walls . It was established in July , 1866 , in the heart of Sioux and Cheyenne hunting_grounds and named for a Civil War hero . The fort lay along the Bozeman Trail , a popular but perilous shortcut to the Oregon Trail . It also served to draw warriors ' attention away from the transcontinental railroad project then passing_through to the south . In 1868 , after the rail had advanced and hundreds of cavalrymen and Sioux , Cheyenne , Crow , Arapaho and Shoshone had killed each other in various ambushes and skirmishes , the U.S. Army gave_up the fort and the Sioux and others burned it . Now a small interpretive center tells that story , displays artifacts and sells books and souvenirs . * Fetterman Battle Site , about five miles from Fort Phil Kearny , is another largely bare hilltop , and the scene of a cavalry defeat on Dec . 21 , 1866 . On that day , Capt . William J . Fetterman , who had bragged of being able to defeat the entire Sioux nation with about 80 good soldiers , was out and about with 81 men . He had orders not to stray too far from Fort Phil Kearny , but upon sight of a_few Sioux , Cheyenne and Arapaho -- including a young Sioux warrior named Crazy Horse -- he violated orders and strayed across Lodge Trail Ridge . The stray warriors were a decoy . More_than 2 # 000 more were waiting , and they quickly killed Fetterman and all_of his men . The whole_thing apparently took about half an hour . In retrospect , that fiasco offered foreshadowing to the most famous of all battle fiascoes in the area : Custer ' s last stand . * Little_Bighorn , Mont . ( about 75 miles north of Sheridan on I-90 ) , is the scene everyone has heard something about . The site , a series of ridges and valleys around the Little_Bighorn_River , had been earmarked for native occupation by the U.S._government in the Treaty of 1868 . But then gold was found nearby , and Army officials became restless about Sioux and Cheyenne hunting habits , and in late June , 1876 , Army leaders including Lt . Col . George A . Custer resolved to attack . But they vastly underestimated the number and attitude and capability of their enemies ; there were thousands of united Sioux , Cheyenne and Arapaho , not the hundreds that were forecast , and Custer evidently had the mistaken impression that they would scatter and retreat upon attack . Cheyenne Two Moon , one of the combatants , said later that the defeat of Custer ' s unit took &quot; as long as it takes a hungry man to eat his dinner. &quot; In the welter of things that went_wrong , Custer and about 225 officers and troopers under his command died in the last major defeat of the campaign , and an industry of Custer speculation and research was spawned . One reason the event took_on such historic resonance was simple timing : The word of Custer ' s defeat reached Washington just in time to taint the nation ' s celebration of its 100th Independence_Day . The site today includes a well-outfitted visitor center , a stone monument to the dead , and a vast , 360-degree view of grass and prairie hills . ( Admission to the monument property is $ 4 per vehicle , $ 2 per pedestrian. ) A Crow reservation surrounds the site , and a national cemetery holds row upon row of dead from World_War I , World_War_II and the Korean_War . Hillside markers also show where Custer and his men fell , and a four-mile driving route allows visitors to follow the chronology of the fighting . The markers and literature show a fascinating evolution of official attitude , from the old stone marker dedicated to the officers and soldiers killed &quot; while clearing the district . . . of hostile Indians &quot; to the newer marker that cites &quot; our fallen heroes , both Indian and white , who gave their last full measure in defense of their country. &quot; In 1991 , after legislation was introduced by U.S. Rep . Ben Nighthorse Campbell ( D-Colo. ) , Congress and President George_Bush agreed to change the site ' s name from Custer Battlefield to Little_Bighorn Battlefield . On the day of my June visit , thunderheads galloped overhead and pelted the landscape with rain and lightning while wind tore at the miles of grass . It was easy enough to picture a terrible event taking_place there . * The stops I made between battle sites were more encouraging . In Buffalo ( population 3 # 500 , about 35 miles south of Sheridan ) , a tourist boomlet has breathed life into the Main_Street with a dozen buildings that date to the 1890-1920 era , a_few quite lavish-looking galleries , and several bars . The old Occidental Hotel may_not be taking guests ( though it is open in summer for historic tours ) , but the Buffalo Bar endures , as does the 21 , as does the Century Club . I walked into the Century Club at 8:45 a.m. on a Wednesday , and through the darkness discerned half_a_dozen devoted local customers , seated in a row at the end of the counter , their eyes narrowing in Old West suspicion as I stepped_up to ask the barkeep if I could use the bathroom . In the high , pine-stubbled town of Story ( population 650 , about 16 miles south of Sheridan ) , for instance , I had a surprisingly good Mexican dinner at the Lodore Supper_Club . The chef , it turned_out , had emigrated from Guadalajara to Wyoming more_than a decade before . At the next table in the Lodore , I found a_couple_of former Californians who had relocated from Oceanside to Story five months before . The man at the table was a former cop , who with wide eyes told me about the level of security in his new hometown . &quot; On a winter night , &quot; he said , &quot; this parking_lot is_full of cars with doors unlocked , keys in the ignitions , engines on and rifles in back . And nothing goes wrong. &quot; In Big Horn ( population 217 , about nine miles south of Sheridan ) , the Bradford Brinton Memorial preserves the ranch and impressive art_collection of a wealthy rancher and art patron . There ' s also a free Bozeman Trail Museum in the old blacksmith ' s shop , and a well-used polo field at the Big Horn Equestrian Center . The polo contests , a weekend ritual each summer , stem from the arrival of Sir Oliver H . Wallop , seventh earl of Portsmouth and grandfather of U.S. Sen . Malcolm Wallop . Sir Oliver ran a ranch , installed a tradition of polo and made a business of exporting ponies to serve Great Britain ' s colonial military_campaigns . Between Sheridan and Big Horn , and Sheridan and Story , and Story and Buffalo , are the open spaces , the amber waves of grain , the round hills and trickling creeks , the shadows of massive and fast-moving clouds . Half the fun of being a tourist in this part of Wyoming is finding your way from place to place in that landscape . There really are more cows than people , as the old saying goes , and there are probably more acres than cows . The question is for how long . &quot; Only a handful of people have known about Sheridan , &quot; said Sam Paul Mavrakis , the new B &amp; B proprietor . &quot; But now , a lot of people in Jackson ( Hole ) and Aspen are getting tired_of that , and they want to come here. &quot; GUIDEBOOK Sheridan or Bust ! * Getting there : Sheridan lies 136 miles southeast of Billings , Mont. , and 147 miles east of Cody , Wyo. , on Interstate 90 .
