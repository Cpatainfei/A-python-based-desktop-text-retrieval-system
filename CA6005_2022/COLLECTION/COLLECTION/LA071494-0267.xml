   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : SEMIFINALS ; AFTER SOME OF BEST , IT ' S THE WORST FOR ITALY ; SOCCER : TWO QUICK GOALS SHOW ITALIANS AT THEIR FINEST , BUT COSTACURTA WON ' T BE AROUND TO PLAY IN THE FINAL ON SUNDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There were five magic minutes when the soccer was exquisite , al dente . The crowd was loud and friendly , the sun shone and fortune smiled . But not even winning calms the stormy passage of the Italian team that has climbed to near the pinnacle of the soccer world . Like a big , loving but fractious family , a good time is never had by all . In victory Wednesday , Italy advanced from unresolved contretemps to fresh uncertainty . Hero Roberto Baggio wept with joy : &quot; This is my work , this is my life . It is made_up of sweat and tears . This time I cried because I am very , very happy. &quot; Goat Alessandro Costacurta could not be consoled . The 28-year-old AC Milan defender helped win a game , but lost every player ' s dream and stalked off the field in disgust . In the first_half he was part of an in-the-box flurry that gave Bulgaria its penalty kick goal . In the second , he fouled another attacker and received a yellow card , his second . It will keep him out of Sunday ' s final game . &quot; The fact that we have made the finals still hasn ' t hit me emotionally , &quot; said Italian captain Paolo Maldini , &quot; but we all are very upset about Costacurta . A player may get only one chance in his life to play in a Cup final. &quot; Costacurta was conspicuous by his absence after the game , but every Italian player seemed eager to commiserate , a platoon suddenly missing one of its squad leaders . &quot; I ' d give anything if he could play , &quot; said midfielder Roberto Donadoni . Said midfielder Demetrio Albertini , another AC Milan teammate : &quot; We have another chance to show our stuff . My feelings are all with Costacurta . He ' s a charismatic leader and we ' re going to miss him. &quot; The absence of Costacurta , injured captain Franco Baresi and the suspended Mauro Tassotti will complicate Italian defensive strategy in Pasadena on Sunday , just as it will add new scenes to the theatrical Italian quest_for an unprecedented fourth World Cup championship . Armed with great tradition and some of the best players in the world , Italy has seemed more novice than nifty for much of its 1994 Cup trail . It qualified with difficulty in its European group , played indifferently in pre-tournament warm-ups and lost its first Cup game to Ireland . It had to come from behind to finish third in its group , and needed last-minute dramatics to beat second-round and quarterfinal opponents . Under iron-willed Coach Arrigo Sacchi , it has been a draining month in America , both for the players and for Italian fans who deported themselves in the streets and fountains of major cities until the wee hours this morning . &quot; A heart pill Cup , &quot; an Italian commentator joked . American summer heat has particularly sapped the Italians , despite Draconian conditioning under Sacchi , a former AC Milan coach . It was a stifling 93 degrees in the steamy Meadowlands at game time Wednesday . All week , the Italian press has quoted Italian players , complaining about the heat and Sacchi ' s demands that Italy play a hard , running , pressing game . Commentators have urged a more controlled , Brazilian style of play . But Italy came_out running again Wednesday , and for five breathtaking minutes in the middle of the first_half it played some of the best soccer America has ever seen . Roberto Baggio scored twice , and two other attacks came_close , to the delight of 77 # 094 , most in buoyant red , white and green . &quot; There were moments there in the first_half when I thought it could have been 4-0 , &quot; midfielder Dino Baggio said . The brilliance seemed to prove the value of Sacchi ' s pressing style of play , but as it did_in the quarterfinal against Spain , Italy quickly wilted in the heat and wound_up hanging_on in exhaustion . &quot; It ' s hard to keep that rhythm up , &quot; Roberto Donadoni said . &quot; It was our best game for the first 35 minutes , but then after the penalty the heat slowed the game , &quot; Dino Baggio said . Can Italy risk running_out of steam against formidable Brazil on Sunday ? That key question , together with the question_mark of Roberto Baggio ' s injured leg , is bound to fuel family debate within the lively Italian camp . Still , Sacchi seems to thrive on the mini-controversies and jostling within La Famiglia , as much as he welcomes the sense of unity that emerges when a player like Costacurta is lost to the team . Italy , says Sacchi , has progressed steadily during its bumpy American sojourn . &quot; If you look_back at how we started in this very stadium ( losing to Ireland ) , you will have to consider that in soccer , as in life , nothing is certain , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
