   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / WORLD CUP NOTES ; U.S. , SWITZERLAND IGNORING TABOO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. national soccer team has been busy this week preparing_for a game on Saturday that , according to soccer tradition , should not be played . The United States plays host to Switzerland at noon at Cal State Fullerton , but soccer teams in the same World Cup group normally do not play one another before the tournament . The United States and Switzerland are in Group_A for next summer ' s tournament . This game , however , was scheduled last September , before Switzerland had qualified for World Cup play . Knowing that most coaches would be reluctant to play under such circumstances , Swiss Coach Roy Hodgson sought_out U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic at the final draw last month in Las Vegas . They agreed to go_ahead with the game . The taboo against playing a World Cup opponent is strong . The United States was scheduled to play Colombia , another Group_A team , in a tournament next month , but the tournament schedule was revised so that the teams would not have to meet . Asked to explain the thinking behind that , most soccer coaches speak vaguely about not showing their hands or revealing new tactical wrinkles . In an era when even practices are routinely videotaped and the most pedestrian international friendly match is televised around the world , there would seem to be few secrets . Milutinovic , however , must believe there are things worth hiding , because when Hodgson requested a tape of last week ' s game against Norway , Milutinovic would not give him one . The Swiss got one anyway . Notes Although the_Swiss have brought a strong team , the players are_on an extended break and are not at full fitness . They haven ' t played since Dec . 8 . For Coach Roy Hodgson , the team ' s trip to the United States is a chance to conduct practices in excellent weather and good training conditions . Hodgson is without the services of his four German-based players , all_of whom play in the front or midfield . He expressed the commonly heard frustration of national coaches unable to pry loose club players for international matches . &quot; We attempted to get them ( released ) , &quot; Hodgson said . &quot; But we don ' t have the right to get them. &quot; Switzerland has not been in the World Cup since it was the host country in 1966 and although soccer is a popular sport , the country is not a major_power . Thus , like American internationals , Swiss players sometime find it difficult to get released for national team games . Hodgson might have been able to get his players released from the powerful Bundesliga for World Cup qualifying matches , but this trip was not deemed crucial . &quot; Germany doesn ' t consider Switzerland to be a football country , &quot; Hodgson said . &quot; It considers us to be a yodeling country. &quot;</TEXT>
