   <HEADLINE> MEXICO AND ZEDILLO PASS A CRUCIAL TEST ; SALINAS ' CANDIDATE BECOMES HIS SUCCESSOR IN MEXICAN NATIONAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There were incidents of fraud and other voting irregularities , to be sure , and even angry protests during Mexico ' s national elections last weekend . But overall the voting was peaceful , the ballot counting appeared to be honest and the voter_turnout was an impressive 70 % . All reassuring , given the turmoil -- from guerrilla fighting to the murder of the ruling party ' s presidential candidate -- leading_up to Sunday ' s vote . So Mexico ' s 1994 elections must be regarded_as another historic achievement for the government of outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , whose efforts at political reform had heretofore lagged behind his remarkable achievements in modernizing Mexico ' s economy . Salinas has set a high standard for President-elect Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon to match . Not everyone was left happy , of course . Leftist opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas insists he was the real winner of Sunday ' s presidential balloting -- that the 1994 election was stolen from him by fraud as_many Mexicans believe the 1988 election was . But by virtually every measure -- from independent exit polls to early quick counts to the all-important official results -- Zedillo won a clear , though certainly not overwhelming victory over Cardenas as well as over Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the rightist National Action Party . Zedillo ' s winning margin of less than 50 % is not a particularly impressive total , given the fact he was the candidate of the powerful apparatus of the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , which has not lost a presidential election in more_than 65 years . The PRI ' s national network of veteran political operatives clearly pulled_out all_the stops for their man , including a_few instances of the ballot-box stuffing and multiple_voting for which the ruling party is notorious . But in the end the more_than 35 # 000 Mexican and foreign election observers who fanned_out to monitor 96 # 000 polling_places reported that fraud or other problems ( like mysteriously running_out of ballots in certain places ) occurred at less than 10 % of the precincts . So the high-tech voting_system Salinas spent $ 2 billion building worked to assure Mexico of an election that , while far from perfect , was fairer than any before it . Although the irregularities on the fringes of his victory cannot discredit Zedillo , they won ' t make his job any easier . They will reinforce the cynicism many Mexicans feel about the PRI and the political_system it dominates . Zedillo will also take_office as the first PRI president with less than a majority vote . And election results for Mexico ' s Congress , whose members also were elected Sunday , indicate he will face opposition blocs that , if they combine against him , can stall his initiatives . All of those facts will serve as unprecedented checks on presidential power in Mexico . But in Zedillo Mexican voters appear to have picked a president with the intelligence to govern effectively despite all these new problems . A Yale-educated economist who had been a member of Salinas ' Cabinet , Zedillo was hand-picked by the Mexican president to succeed the assassinated Luis Donaldo Colosio as the PRI ' s standard-bearer . Although dismissed by many at the time as a cold technocrat , Zedillo seemed to grow a political personality during the campaign , articulating progressive new ideas to build_on the Salinas legacy . Intellectual and political progressivism was expected in economic_policy , given the free-market liberalism and Ivy League training that Zedillo and Salinas share . But it could be even more important in politics , where Zedillo has promised to open_up the Mexican governing process to eliminate official corruption and cede more power to Congress as well as_to state and municipal_governments . If he acts_on his campaign promises , Zedillo will ensure that Sunday ' s election is only the beginning of a modern , more mature Mexican democracy .</TEXT>
