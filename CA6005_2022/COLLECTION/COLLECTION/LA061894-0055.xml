   <HEADLINE> STUDIES IN SUCCESS ; YEARS OF WORK PAY OFF IN DEGREES FOR UCI GRADUATES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They ' ve studied for hours and taken test after grueling test . They ' ve finished dozens of lab experiments , gulped canfuls of cola and turned_in the last of their last-minute thesis papers . Today , UC Irvine ' s Class of 1994 will become alumni . About 3 # 400 UCI seniors are scheduled to graduate in three ceremonies today . Another 640 graduate_students also will receive their degrees . Dressed in robes and mortarboards with tassels , they will accept their diplomas at Aldrich Park , a wooded retreat in the center of the Irvine campus . Sixty more UCI undergraduates are graduating this year compared to last year , university officials said . The 29th graduating_class is the most ethnically diverse of any at UCI , university spokeswoman Dorothy Jean said . The breadth of cultures at the university is evident in the surnames of its award winners this year . John O ' Toole and Paul Urayima both were named as Barry M . Goldwater Scholars in sciences ; Nguyen-Hong Hoang , a political_science major , was selected as UCI ' s first Harry S . Truman Scholar ; mathematics student James Nunez received a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship ; and Hoang and electrical_engineering student Matthew Siler received UCI Lauds and Laurels Awards . Students from three departments -- engineering and physical and biological_sciences -- will go_through commencement at 9 a.m. Social_sciences students will follow at 1 p.m. , and a 5 p.m. ceremony will honor students of fine_arts , humanities , social ecology , interdisciplinary studies and information and computer_science . Chancellor Laurel L . Wilkening will speak briefly at all three ceremonies , Jean said . The ranks of the graduates count among them young_women and men who want to return to inner_cities to teach . Others are young entrepreneurs and entertainers . Some are parents , like a former professional singer from Mexico and mother of two who will get her diploma with highest honors in social ecology . There are more_than 4 # 000 stories among the Class of 1994 . Here are a_few of them . Some people study at UCI so they can get jobs in traditional professional fields , such_as finance or medicine . Eran Feigenbaum , a senior graduating with honors , studied electrical_engineering there so he could make magic . Feigenbaum , 22 , tours clubs as a magician and performs in venues from Hollywood to Bora Bora . He never speaks during his shows ; instead , he presents his illusions against a musical backdrop of songs by Sting , Madonna and other artists . He learned his first magic_tricks at age 6 from his grandfather , a former razor-blade-eating magician with a Russian circus . He remembers he didn ' t take the illusions seriously , though , until age 12 , when he saw a movie about a magician . &quot; I realized he was kissing all_the girls , &quot; Feigenbaum said , relaxing in his Turtle Rock home . &quot; I decided it would be cool. &quot; Feigenbaum , a native of Tel Aviv , immigrated to New Jersey and picked_up English when he was 16 . He moved to Irvine and graduated from University High_School . He worked_at children ' s parties and a_few clubs on the weekends during his high_school stint . When it was time to choose a college , UCLA was Feigenbaum ' s first choice . &quot; It ' s close to all_the clubs in Hollywood , &quot; he explains . But it was UCI that accepted him -- and he said he is now glad he ended_up in Irvine . Feigenbaum notched as_many as 20 shows each week during 3 1 / 2 years of college . The business ' demands kept him from living_in a dormitory or participating in school clubs or activities . &quot; I missed that , &quot; he said . &quot; Sometimes I think I would ' ve liked to be in a fraternity or something . But there ' s a give_and_take there . Now I have both a career and an education. &quot; Few magicians have degrees in engineering , Feigenbaum said . &quot; I chose electrical_engineering , not so_much because I knew what it was all about , but because it could easily be connected to magic , &quot; he said . Now he uses a laptop_computer to run the lights , sound and prop cues for his shows . Electronics and theater classes have taught him what his light technicians must contend with during his performances . Soon he ' s going_to try_out another option : He applied to Pepperdine and USC law_schools and plans to explore patent law . &quot; I love talking and being in front of people , &quot; Feigenbaum said . But , regardless of whether he becomes a lawyer , he said he still will perform magic . &quot; If I ' m not incredibly busy , I go crazy , &quot; he said . * Twenty-five years ago , Irasema Venezia couldn ' t imagine attending college , much less graduating . Repression in the land where she was raised -- Nicaragua -- forced her family to move to Mexico before she could finish secondary_school , she said . Now Venezia , 39 , can relax in her Newport Beach apartment and worry about psychology papers instead of political instability . Books on career_counseling and social behavior lie atop her glass coffee_table , and she pokes_at them as she talks flamboyantly in rapid-fire Spanish . &quot; I don ' t think I ' m going_to the graduation , &quot; she said , fiddling with a text . &quot; I ' ve already started some of my graduate work in USC ' s counseling psychology program , and it ' s as if I want to put things behind me. &quot; She and her husband shared child_care of their two teen-age daughters , so she didn ' t socialize much with classmates . Venezia said she took a road to her degree that is far from typical . How many UCI graduates can say they were professional songstresses in Mexico ? She opens the drawer of a night table and pulls_out dozens of tapes of songs she composed and performed . &quot; I worked three years with Televisa , &quot; one of Mexico ' s largest television networks , Venezia said . &quot; I had my own weekly show. &quot; She also composed songs for several Latin_American music festivals , she said . But the atmosphere was not ideal for her young daughters , she said , so she quit . Venezia , who said she has never lived anywhere longer than five years , moved to Cancun and sold condominium time-shares . After she married her second husband and moved to Kansas in 1989 , she took her first community_college classes . She continued taking courses at Orange Coast College when she and her family moved to Orange County in 1990 . UCI ' s well-regarded social ecology program was the next step , and she garnered a number of honors at the school . Part of her interest in psychology comes from her own childhood , when her worries about death were heightened by the mysticism prevalent in her family , Venezia said . &quot; We lived_in a little house near a church and I ' d always see funerals , and people carrying dead people by , &quot; she said . &quot; That may be why I ' m thinking_of working with terminally ill people . They ' re the ones who really suffer emotionally. &quot; * In one of UCI ' s nondescript , earth-toned family housing units , Anthony Kutscher clutches his scrapbook and points to a picture of himself in 1976 . Sporting bell-bottoms and long hair -- much like the other band members of Sapient , his long-defunct Orange County rock_group -- he looks more like a partyer than a computer_scientist . The years have yellowed the picture and mellowed his rebellion . There was a time during his teen years , Kutscher said , when he was lucky to find a place to sleep , much less strive for a college education . &quot; I was supposed to go_to Anaheim High_School &quot; to start 10th grade , Kutscher said . &quot; But I never showed_up for the first day of class . I had no use for it. &quot; Kutscher said he didn ' t relate to his family , and he stayed behind in California at age 14 when the family moved to Minnesota . He took_to sleeping_in cars and friends ' garages , drinking and taking drugs , he said . When he injured a knee and went_to a hospital , a doctor put him on prescription_drugs and ordered him not to drink alcohol . Stopping was so difficult , he said , he realized he was addicted . &quot; I put myself in a care unit in 1978 , &quot; he said , sitting on a couch beside his wife , Diana . &quot; I realized it was a bad problem. &quot; His first wife divorced him after he stopped drinking and partying , he said , but he kept his three children -- the oldest now 17 years old . He joined Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa , where he met Diana . They had a son , now 11 years old . Gradually , he worked his way up from cleaning duties to become a machinist at 3M Orthopedics in Irvine . Faced with the specter of having to program high-tech computerized mills and lathes , he started taking computer classes . But by his 13th year in machining , he became allergic to solvents and the company moved him to a lower-paying job . &quot; My wife said , ' I think you should try going_back to school , ' &quot; he said . &quot; When I actually did_it , she was pretty shocked. &quot; He attended Orange Coast College to take_care of &quot; seven pages of prerequisites , &quot; he said , and finally arrived with a full-tuition scholarship at UCI in 1990 . Now he is finishing an honors project programming cutting-edge educational software for children . He received two departmental awards for excellence and has started a summer job at Rockwell International Corp . Diana Kutscher , who will begin studying at UCI in September , sometimes has to urge him to take a break from work . &quot; You know there ' s a problem when your kids start to call you Uncle Dad , &quot; Anthony Kutscher said . * Jocelyn Vaughnes doesn ' t want to be caught studying too_much . Her whole approach , she said , is to relate her education to the off-campus world . Take her senior thesis , for example . &quot; I interviewed teen women in central Orange County about their sexuality , &quot; said Vaughnes , 22 . &quot; I found that so many people speak_for teen women , but it ' s very unusual their own voices are heard. &quot; She explored how young_women see their bodies , how they make decisions about whether to have_sex and how they express their sexuality -- a project she worked_on for 20 weeks . Vaughnes , a San Bernardino native , said she decided to attend UCI because she was attracted by its social ecology program stressing psychology and social behavior . But she said she switched to women ' s studies during her junior year so she could have the freedom to pursue research that she could relate to . &quot; I was kind of disappointed with the way my college life was going until then , &quot; Vaughnes said . &quot; People only got_together to study for midterms or finals . Nobody really discussed things. &quot; In women ' s studies , she often got_together with fellow students to talk_about poverty , inequity and social change . &quot; It ' s sad to think that people have been here for four years and don ' t really know their classmates , &quot; she said . When Vaughnes arrived_at UCI in 1990 , she had little idea what college really would be like , she said . She soon discovered that she was only one of about 300 African American women on the campus . &quot; It wasn ' t so_much that I felt isolated , I just felt more visible , &quot; she said . &quot; Other people could ditch and I couldn ' t. &quot; In class , whenever the discussion turned_to African American issues , all eyes turned_to her as a spokeswoman . She doesn ' t rebel against it -- she answers questions and discusses her life as an African American woman -- but she doesn ' t feel comfortable in the role . &quot; There ' s no such thing as one spokeswoman for African American women , &quot; said Vaughnes , who now lives_on Balboa Island . Through talking with friends and professors , Vaughnes said she has finally found the nerve to speak her mind . She has participated in protests over student fees and went_to Sacramento to speak with legislators in 1993 . She is concerned for the future of UCI and worries about its place in academia . &quot; When I first got here , you could go_to the library ( on the weekend ) to study , &quot; she said . &quot; Now it ' s only open from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays . Services are really being cut. &quot; Vaughnes said she plans to stay in the world of academe . She ' s now preparing to go_to New York to teach poor elementary_school students with the Teach for America program , but afterward she will pursue a graduate degree to become a professor , she said . &quot; I want to get my Ph.D. , &quot; she said with conviction . &quot; I want to teach , and I want to see women and people_of_color emphasized in what I do. &quot;</TEXT>
