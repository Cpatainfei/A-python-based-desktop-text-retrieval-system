   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; NAFIS SADIK ; AIMING FOR CONSENSUS ON THE ROILING ISSUE OF POPULATION_CONTROL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 40 years ago , Nafis Sadik , a doctor , was required to ask her husband for his permission to go_to work and practice medicine , as was the custom in Pakistan . This month , Sadik will lead the international community through a critical demographic crossroads . On the eve of the International Conference on Population and Development , to be held_in Cairo this month , a 90 % majority of U.N. members is poised to sign the proposed program of action to reduce the growth in human population that increases by 90 million annually . As secretary_general of the conference , Sadik has set a course different from those of previous conferences on population in Bucharest and Mexico_City , each a decade apart . The cornerstone of the Cairo program is the empowerment of the individual -- in particular , women . A gynecologist and obstetrician who has practiced in rural_areas , Sadik developed a five-year health and family-planning program as part of Pakistan ' s overall development plan . &quot; When the essential needs of the individual are addressed , &quot; she explains , &quot; those of larger groups -- the family , the community , the nation and indeed the planet -- are more likely to be kept_in the right perspective. &quot; But this focus_on empowerment has galvanized opposition to the Cairo meeting . Saudi_Arabia has announced it will not attend , and the Vatican has maintained its strong opposition . In Egypt , Islamic fundamentalists have threatened violence to disrupt the conference , asserting the proposals violate their moral beliefs . Sadik ' s leadership , however , has helped build a majority consensus . Abortion -- the most emotional subject in the document -- will remain under the jurisdiction of nation-states . Nobel laureates and scientists have warned that current population-growth trends could lead to irreversible degradation of the environment and continued poverty for much of the world . Strong support for the Cairo program could change the nature of our stewardship of the Earth , and any decision will have far-reaching implications for future generations . Sadik ' s work to bring attention to the world population crisis has earned her numerous awards and honors . She is married to Azhar Sadik , a businessman , and has five children , two of whom are adopted . Question : How will this International Conference on Population and Development be different from the previous U.N. meetings on population in Mexico_City and Bucharest ? Answer : The outcome of Mexico_City and Bucharest was a policy of population stabilization that targeted population goals at the national level , through governments that would try to create policy and pass laws . Goals were imposed on the individual through international and then through national institutions . What those efforts didn ' t do was establish an enabling environment in which people could make the right decisions . The 1994 Cairo conference plan_of_action focuses both on population and development . It broadens the scope of population policy from the narrow focus_on family_planning and fertility to other issues of sustainable development and empowerment of the individual -- particularly women -- to make decisions . The keystone of the Cairo plan is gender equality , equity and empowerment of women . Women are half the population of the world , half the population of every country . Because women are the only ones who become pregnant and bear children , population policy must be dealt with by them . Women have always wanted to have some control over their fertility . Even if a woman wants four or five children , she should be allowed to space those children , so that she will be_better able to care_for them . Q : How is the document , with this cornerstone for the empowerment of women , being received by the U.N. member nations ? A : In the preparatory meetings for the ICPD over the last two-and-a-half years , every single government spoke_of the importance of empowering women , of having women in the decision-making process . . . . From the African_countries to the Latin_American countries , and Arab countries -- all_of them spoke_of the importance of the role of women . Ninety percent of the governments have also agreed to the text as is , except for a_few of the brackets . It is only on abortion -- the whole subject of reproductive health , women ' s rights , and abortion is so fraught with emotional overtones -- that there are different points_of_view , even though the document does not suggest legalization of abortion . The subject of control is what concerns religious_leaders . Throughout history , anthropological , cultural , social and religious norms have supported fertility control . That has been used to subjugate women . Disagreement , then , is not centered so_much on the need for population stabilization , but on family_planning and whether it should occur at the individual level or at the institutional level . Our plan_of_action is only saying that the needs of women should be addressed in consultation with them , not as a prescription to them and imposed on them . Today , all women do not have the possibility to choose their roles . Their roles are assigned to them to be , in a sense , service providers . To enforce the reproductive role as the only role in this day and age is mind-boggling . Q : There is opposition to these ideas coming from the Vatican and some Islamic leaders . Given their opposition , what is the best-case scenario coming_out of Cairo ? A : The Catholic religion does not accept modern methods of contraception . In other religions , there is no one point_of_view . Some Islamic leaders do say that family_planning is against Islam . But most statements from Islamic leaders have favored family_planning . Traditionally , religion plays more of a role when it is linked with politics -- when religious_leaders have influence with government . Look_at the U.S. , for example . During the Reagan_Administration , religious groups were more vocal and influential than today . With President Clinton in office , it ' s a different situation . The best-case scenario , then , would be_full approval of the plan_of_action minus the brackets . That would include an acceptance by all governments of the definition of sexual and reproductive health that comes from the World_Health_Organization . It addresses unsafe abortion as a public-health issue for women and should be an issue in every country where these deaths are occurring . We would also like a full agreement on family-planning services , adolescence and reproductive health . It does not legalize or seek legalization of abortion . Rather , it seeks to make abortion less necessary through the provision of family_planning and to make medical services available to women who resort_to abortion in_order to prevent health consequences , including death . Reproductive health does not contain a hidden agenda to legalize abortion ; that is up_to every country to decide . Reproductive health means information and education about reproduction , pre- and post-natal care , assisted deliveries , family-planning services and HIV / AIDS and STD ( sexually transmitted disease ) control and prevention . Indeed , if we are to be successful , three conditions must exist simultaneously , and globally , to help reduce population : First , education and empowerment of women -- the ability of women to participate in decisions about family size and in decisions about the shape and nature of society ; second , the availability of family- planning services and information , and , third , the confidence by parents that their children will survive . These conditions must occur at_the_same_time to be effective . Q : Do you see the Cairo conference as a watershed for feminism on a global scale ? A : I think it is . We will be looking_at major increases in women in the economic labor_force -- the national labor_forces . Across the North and the South , women are increasingly working outside the home , admittedly at the lowest-paid jobs . In Asia , women are working outside the home ; they are educated , they become &quot; bread-winners &quot; and thus gain more respect from their husbands and families . Gradually and grudgingly , there will be more and more recognition of women ' s work , even within the household . Things are now changing . Alongside women ' s entry into the labor_force , consideration should be taken that their work not simply be overloaded onto them . There should be a changing of roles -- a balancing of women ' s roles outside of the home with the man ' s role inside of the home . The Nordics are very good_examples of this . The role of men and women in the parenting of children is quite equal there , especially in Sweden . In Sweden , it is not unusual for the father to take_leave to look_after children . Helping in the household is common . The division of responsibilities are such_that sometimes the man cooks and the woman looks_after the rest of the house . Sometimes , it is the other way around . Such role equality is not happening in the developing world to such a great extent . Men are pushed by what is expected of them , and they don ' t want to be laughed_at by their peers and their colleagues . The stereotyping there has to change . Q : How , then , will gender equality and the changing of stereotypes be accepted on a global scale ? Won ' t such change take many years ? A : Changing gender roles is threatening . Men and women are afraid of how these changes are going_to affect them . Will they really be able to cope_with the new circumstances ? Women are also worried about a new role expected of them , to be independent and fend_for themselves . Change is always worrisome . But things can happen rapidly . It might not take decades , and major change could occur in a decade . If we can identify and engage key people to make changes , then change starts to happen very quickly . Core interventions should include , for example , getting girls into school and literacy programs . Q : Change occurs at different speeds . North and the South are not in sync ; they exist in non-parallel historical time . Isn ' t it worth listening to the concerns of those in the more advanced industrial societies who have gone_through the breakdown of the family ? A : True , different societies live_in different historical times . . . . ( But ) all I can say is it is impossible to legislate family . I do not disagree that there should be a father , mother and children , but how do you make them stay_together ? Women , in fact , don ' t leave their children and walk_out ; men do . Women keep their children . Most societies have condoned men having multiple sexual_relationships . Societies don ' t frown_on a man having mistresses , regardless of upholding marriage as sacred . In my part of the world , it is considered a great achievement to have many women . It is power over women , and confirms the low_status of women . You can have them , you can own them . So it is the same all_over the world . Fathers abandon their families and go_off . In some cases , there is the extended_family , but even the extended_family is now under economic pressure and is gradually breaking_down so that they , too , are unwilling to support additional family members . The nuclear_family , in the end , is abandoned when the father , the bread-winner , walks_out . Restricting women from having children out of wedlock could preclude arranged marriages in_order to avoid preventing them from fulfilling their biological roles . Q : The Vatican and some Islamic scholars would argue that America ' s key societal problem is the breakdown of the integrity of the family , in large part due_to the rise of the feminist sensibility . Is this justified ? A : Feminism is not the cause of the breakdown of the family . The breakdown of the family is_due to men having remained in their traditional roles . Men have not changed . Men must now take responsibility and change their roles . The roles of both genders must change . The woman should not be expected to take_on double , triple loads . She must_not be induced to sacrifice her professional career in_order to look_after the family because , after all , it is her job alone . Fathering is also a job as much as mothering is a job . Both parents should share the responsibilities of parenting and the household work . If you have a proper relationship , that is what you will share . If the status_quo in fact was such_that everybody was equal and women and men could select their own roles , there would be no feminist_movement .</TEXT>
