   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : IRVINE ; TEEN-AGE SAFE RIDE PROGRAM FACES CUTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A program that provides free rides to teen-agers who think they have had too_much to drink could see its funding reduced under a proposal now being considered . Irvine ' s Safe Rides program is run_by Explorer Scouts and paid_for by People for Irvine Community Health , a nonprofit group that sponsors a variety of health and education program in the city . Facing a tight budget , PICH might cut its funding to Safe Rides , forcing the teen-agers who run the program to look_for new sources of money . The move comes as demand for rides is decreasing . Over the last four months , Irvine ' s Safe Rides program received 47 calls_for service , a decrease from several years ago , said Barbara Allari , the vice_president of PICH . Allari attributed the decline to the success of anti-drunk-driving campaigns . She also said an increasing number of teen-agers are using designated drivers who stay sober when groups go_out to party . The Safe Rides program is in_operation most Friday and Saturday nights when school is in session . Explorer Scouts who have gone_through special training staff a hot_line that teen-agers can call if they need rides . Explorers provide rides to teen-agers in the Irvine area . But if a call comes_in from outside the city , the Explorers can connect the caller to the Safe Rides hot_line in their area . PICH allocated about $ 1 # 150 to Safe Rides last year . The money went_to pay mostly for phone_bills and general operating expenses , Allari said . The agency has not decided how much money will be cut from the program . &quot; We want to look_at the budget very closely , &quot; Allari said . &quot; We are looking_at the amount we spend. &quot; PICH officials hope the prospect of a funding reduction will prompt Safe Riders leaders to look_at ways of improving the program and finding new sources of revenue . Allari said the explorers could hold fund-raisers like car washes to make_up for any lost money from PICH.SHELBY GRAD</TEXT>
