   <HEADLINE> EX-CIA CHIEF TURNER TELLS OF FAILURES ON HIS WATCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former CIA Director Stansfield Turner stunned a conference of dozens of current and former agency analysts Friday with a blunt critique of the CIA ' s effectiveness -- and his own -- during his term in office . Although not listed on the program , Turner stole the spotlight when he told the audience the agency had shortchanged President Jimmy_Carter in the late 1970s . Turner said the CIA &quot; didn ' t do_well &quot; in foreseeing the downfall of the Shah of Iran or the collapse of the Soviet_Union and had consistently failed to serve the President in its handling of its primary analytical product , the lengthy documents known as National Intelligence Estimates . These reports were not inaccurate or misleading , Turner said , but were simply &quot; irrelevant &quot; to the President in making policy . &quot; If anyone is to blame , it is I , &quot; he said . Robert M . Gates , who served as CIA chief under President George_Bush , disagreed sharply with Turner , saying the intelligence agency ' s reports on the Soviet_Union &quot; underpinned the entire arms control process &quot; through the presidencies of both parties . &quot; You could not negotiate with the Russians without the NIE , &quot; Gates said in an interview , adding the Senate would not have ratified arms control treaties without assurances the CIA could verify Soviet compliance . Besides Turner , other critics said the agency ' s reports were too long , too biased or flat wrong . But they all welcomed the release at the conference of the latest batch of CIA documents from the Cold_War years . The conference , sponsored by the CIA and Harvard_University , is devoted to evaluating how the agency performed in its most critical role -- assessing Soviet weapons and plans .</TEXT>
