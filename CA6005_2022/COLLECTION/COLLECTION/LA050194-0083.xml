   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : REACTIONS DIFFER TO RISING TIDE OF CARIBBEAN CRIME ; SAFETY : THE NAVY CANCELED ST . THOMAS SHORE_LEAVE ; MOST CRUISE LINES ISSUE ONLY INFORMAL ADVICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was the April 10 death of tourist Murray Callan , a vacationing San Diegan shot by a mugger on one of the busiest streets on St . Thomas , that started recent talk_of trouble in the U.S. Virgin Islands . But it ' s now clear that crimes against visitors and residents had been escalating in the area for many months before the shooting , prompting requests from island officials for law_enforcement aid and leading the U.S. Navy last fall to cancel all its port calls to the island . Despite those developments , several cruise lines serving St . Thomas , one of the most popular ports in the Caribbean , say they have made no substantial changes in the informal , unwritten safety advice they offer to passengers going ashore by day , and don ' t expect any changes in the foreseeable future . Cruise_ship advice to passengers now often amounts to spoken suggestions that they use common_sense . Of the seven major lines contacted last week , none offer passengers printed matter on the subject of shore safety . A spokesman for the Cruise Line International Assn. , the leading cruise_ship trade organization , said that the group has made no recommendations to its members regarding safety advice to passengers . &quot; These kind of things tend to be swept_under_the_rug , &quot; said Larry Fishkin , president of The Cruise Line , a Miami-based agency that specializes in matching customers with cruise lines . &quot; If there is a problem , I think their responsibility is to notify passengers to take precautions. &quot; One possible response , Fishkin said , would be to follow the lead of rental car agencies in southern Florida where , after the recent spate of crimes against tourists , agencies started handing_out detailed brochures advising &quot; what to do and not to do. &quot; * The U.S. Virgin Islands , which lie just east of Puerto Rico , include St . Thomas , St . John and St . Croix , and have for years enjoyed a reputation as sleepy , sun-soaked destinations . But authorities say recent years have brought broad increases in crime and drug problems throughout the Caribbean . Cruise passengers are shielded from many of these problems because they are almost always on shore by day and back on board ship by nightfall . But authorities agree the best precautions for cruise travelers do fall within most travelers ' definition of &quot; common sense. &quot; In areas where street crime is a concern , tourists should travel in groups , perhaps with a shore excursion organized by the cruise_ship . Tourists shouldn ' t carry large amounts of cash , or wear flashy jewelry . The U.S. Navy ' s decision to cancel all port calls to St . Thomas came last October , following a 10-month string of 19 port calls to Charlotte Amalie , St . Thomas ' s capital , marred by 12 violent crimes against sailors : robbery , assault and one murder . Over the same period , records of Atlantic Fleet headquarters in Norfolk , Va. , show that Navy personnel paid 40 port calls to Italy ' s long-notorious port of Naples , suffering just one violent crime . A Navy spokesman said St . Thomas is the only Caribbean port where the Navy has canceled calls . On March 27 , a Virgin Islands police_officer died in a hail of 14 shots in an apparent ambush in front of his home . His death prompted the_Virgin Islands ' delegate to Congress , Ron de Lugo , to call_for FBI aid . Two weeks later came Murray Callan ' s slaying . . . followed on April 13 by a letter from de Lugo to U.S. Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , asking Justice_Department help in fighting an &quot; escalation of violent crime. &quot; Noting that the islands have seen 11 homicides in the first four months of the year , de Lugo asserted that &quot; the resources of our local law_enforcement community cannot cope_with this situation and the community is increasingly apprehensive. &quot; * Talking to cruise lines , however , travelers are unlikely to hear of these details . Cruise officials point_out that their passengers have been unaffected by these crimes , that most cruise passengers are ashore only by day , and that , on the whole , the islands face less crime than is found in most big cities . ( Local authorities have reported that fewer than 200 of the islands ' 2 million tourists last year were victims of reported crimes. ) Two cruise officials noted that their companies have recently abandoned plans for shore calls_in the Middle_East because of safety concerns . At Carnival Cruise Lines , whose ships Celebration , Sensation and Festivale call weekly at St . Thomas year-round , spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz said ship representatives &quot; occasionally advise the passengers to simply use common_sense , just as they would in a major city , or vacationing at a major resort on land. &quot; She said she expected no policy_changes , that Carnival is satisfied St . Thomas officials are responding to concerns about crime . At Norwegian Cruise Line , whose ships Norway and Starward call weekly at St . Thomas in spring and summer , spokeswoman Fran Sevcik said ship personnel offer &quot; a lot of ( spoken ) common_sense tips -- for people not to go_off the beaten path , and not to go_off with people they don ' t know. &quot; Sevcik said she knew of no plans for changes and noted that &quot; our security officers are in constant touch with authorities down there. &quot; Officials at Royal Caribbean Cruise Line , Tall Ship Adventures , Cunard Crown , Holland America and Crystal Cruises offered similar responses .</TEXT>
