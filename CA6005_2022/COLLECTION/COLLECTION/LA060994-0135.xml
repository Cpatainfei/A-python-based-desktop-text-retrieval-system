   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : SANTA MONICA ; LOVE CONQUERS ALL IN DRAMA OF A LIFETIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sascha Schneider always wanted to give his parents the wedding_ceremony they never had , the one robbed by the Holocaust . As smitten teen-agers in a ghetto in Riga , Latvia , Helma and Benno Schneider had hoped for a formal ceremony . But that was destroyed when the Germans liquidated the city ' s Jewish quarter in 1943 . The only rite they managed to receive was a quick Hebrew blessing on a November evening from Helma ' s parents , followed by a bottle of Cognac . Then they were trucked off to a labor camp . Of both sides of their family , only a brother and three uncles survived . But 50 years later , after the Schneiders , who now live_in West Hollywood , survived their ordeal and emigrated to the United States , their dreams of a traditional wedding become reality , thanks to eldest son Sascha , a documentary producer , and his wife , Laurie . The acclaimed &quot; Chuppa : The Wedding Canopy , &quot; which will be shown tonight at a Santa Monica theater , is a filmed recording of the wedding preparations and ceremony that explores the unique relationships within a multi-generational survivor family . The 80-minute film was first shown in March at the Santa Barbara Film Festival , where it won the top documentary award . &quot; It ' s been my dream to give my parents a formal wedding and to make this film , &quot; Sascha said . &quot; This film deals with the transmission of a legacy of pain , suffering and , finally , healing. &quot; After surviving the horrors of two concentration_camps and a year of hiding in the Russian forest , where they fled while being transferred to another camp , the Schneiders returned to Riga after the war . The state granted them official papers recognizing their marriage , but a formal wedding seemed meaningless . Only a_few relatives could have celebrated the occasion . But in 1992 , on the 50th anniversary of their union , their son organized a formal ceremony that was witnessed by three generations of Schneiders . Laurie Schneider said the making of the film and the preparations for the ceremony itself highlighted the differences between generations and the difficulty in easing a painful history . The giving_away of the bride and groom , and the separation of parent and child it symbolizes , took_on special meaning for Helma and Benno Schneider . &quot; For many camp survivors who have lost so_much , any kind of separation is equated with death , &quot; said Laurie Schneider . The movie depicts the family ' s struggles over cultural and religious practices . For example , Sascha and Laurie Schneider battle with their parents , and between themselves , over whether to continue such rituals as a bris -- the Jewish rite of circumcision -- for their son ( she was pregnant at the time. ) Having grown_up as an American Jew , Laurie Schneider confronts the emotional demands of her in-laws -- steeped in the traditions of the schtetl , the sense of a community acting_as a family -- while trying to retain the integrity of her immediate family . As licensed family therapists , Sascha and Laurie Schneider have a deep understanding of the intergenerational problems of families . Sascha Schneider has conducted many workshops in America and Europe for the second-generation survivors of the Holocaust . For many such families , concentration_camps remain a forbidden topic , a subject too painful for discussion . Sascha Schneider said the children of Holocaust survivors in therapy sessions often spoke_of a strange condition that would afflict their survivor parents -- &quot; camp , &quot; a vague feeling of depression , withdrawal and anger . &quot; Every survivor had ' camp ' when they came_to America , but an important part of Jewish legacy is to keep talking , keep exploring , and that ' s what we hope our film does , &quot; said Sascha Schneider . Laurie Schneider said her in-laws &quot; took tremendous risks to live , and they have taken tremendous emotional risks to heal &quot; and pass_on their experiences to their children . Phyllis de Picciotto , artistic director of the Santa Barbara Film Festival , said the Schneiders ' feature was the hit of the proceedings . &quot; The movie really touched people , &quot; she said . &quot; I have a theory about good movies -- they make you laugh and cry , and this one surely did both. &quot; The Schneiders are seeking a distributor for the feature and will show the film at a benefit for the Southern California Counseling Center at 7 tonight at Laemmle ' s Monica Fourplex in Santa Monica .
