   <HEADLINE> AMERICAN ALBUM : ALASKANS SPEAK OUT TO SAVE DYING LANGUAGES ; AFTER YEARS OF SUPPRESSION , MANY HAVE ABANDONED THEIR NATIVE TONGUES . NOW SOME SEEK A RENEWAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Nora Dauenhauer was a young_girl nearly half a century ago , she made the mistake one day of speaking in her native tongue . As a Tlingit Indian , she had been warned by her teachers not to use the language that had served her people in southeast Alaska for hundreds of years . When she slipped , retribution was quick and to_the_point . &quot; They washed my mouth out with soap , &quot; she said as she discussed the social attitudes that have doomed her language . The harassment from educators and her peers was so severe that , when her own children were growing_up , she hesitated to speak with them in Tlingit . Many years later , she concluded that she had made a mistake , and she dedicated her life to teaching others to speak the guttural sounds that make_up the Tlingit language . But she knows now she is probably too late . Only two of the 20 native languages that once flourished across Alaska are viable today . Tlingit is not one of them . &quot; In order for a language to survive , it has to remain a spoken phenomenon , &quot; said Nora ' s husband , Richard , a linguist . They work together as part of a cultural heritage program sponsored by Sealaska Corp. , one of 13 regional native corporations established by the Alaska Native_Land Claims Settlement Act . Their goal is to preserve as much of the Tlingit language as possible . They are compiling dictionaries and storybooks in Tlingit and other dying languages in Alaska , but they know they are fighting almost impossible odds . &quot; There will be a record of it , &quot; said Richard Dauenhauer . &quot; But that doesn ' t keep the language alive. &quot; What killed it , he said , is three generations of suppression that turned the Tlingits against their own language . Schoolchildren who spoke &quot; native , &quot; he said , were treated as ignorant barbarians . &quot; You were backward if you spoke Tlingit , &quot; Nora Dauenhauer said . As a result , there is not a single woman of childbearing age who speaks Tlingit today , so no children are being taught the language in the home . The Dauenhauers are struggling to educate public_school teachers to encourage rather than harass children who want to learn their own language . Tlingit is a difficult language , with two_dozen to three dozen sounds that do not exist in English , and there is no obvious reason why children should try . &quot; There is no marketplace , &quot; Richard Dauenhauer said . To learn it , he said , has to be &quot; a spiritual kind of thing. &quot; Nora Dauenhauer said it is more_than worth the effort , and she sees some encouraging signs_in the few children she knows who want to learn it . &quot; There is a trend toward feeling good about yourself just by being Tlingit , &quot; she said . &quot; Before , we wanted to be just like you . But that doesn ' t work for us , because we are Tlingits. &quot; When she speaks Tlingit , she said , &quot; I have a feeling that this is me , this is what I ' m about. &quot; For coming generations , she says , that experience will almost certainly be lost . Only two of the five Eskimo languages -- and none of the 15 Indian languages -- survive in Alaska . Both are forms of Yupik . Siberian Yupik is still spoken on St . Lawrence Island , a desolate chunk of rock that is closer to Russia than the coast of Alaska and is so remote that the native language has not been destroyed by competition with English . And the western part of the state near Bethel has enough isolated villages that Yupik has survived . Michael Krauss of the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks has worked for more_than three decades to help save the two surviving Eskimo languages , but he has encountered the same difficulties cited by the Dauenhauers . The policy among government_agencies , public_schools and most missionaries , &quot; was to make schoolchildren speak nothing but English and forget their barbarous jargon , &quot; Krauss said . When he first joined the staff of the university in 1960 , Krauss took a deep interest in the dying languages and vowed to try to turn the tide . Krauss and others established an &quot; underground &quot; network to encourage the preservation of the languages , translating stories into native tongues and sending copies to the Alaskan bush . They emerged from the underground in the late 1960s with the passage of the Federal Bilingual Education Act , which permitted readings in languages other_than English in public_schools . The law , aimed mainly at Latinos , also meant Yupik Eskimos had finally achieved the &quot; human_right &quot; to use their own language . But he fears that may have been too_little , and too late . Yupik is fading even in the remote villages as more youngsters lean toward English . &quot; In three-quarters of the Yupik villages , the children are no longer learning their own language , &quot; Krauss said , adding that &quot; if Yupik dies_out in Alaska , it ' s gone , &quot; because it is not spoken anywhere else . And that , Krauss says , is a tragedy .</TEXT>
