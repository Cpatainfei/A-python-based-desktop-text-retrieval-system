   <HEADLINE> U.N. BEGINS TRIAL LIFTING OF YUGOSLAVIA SANCTIONS ; BALKANS : MOVE COMES IN RESPONSE TO SERBIAN PRESIDENT ' S PROMISE TO STOP SUPPLYING REBELS IN BOSNIA . DOUBTS ABOUT PLEDGE LINGER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Yugoslavia gained its first symbolic readmission into the circle of civilized nations Wednesday , Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was casting himself as the victor in a long , painful standoff with the outside world . The influential Politika newspaper , controlled by Milosevic supporters , trumpeted the reopening of the Belgrade airport as &quot; the beginning of the end &quot; of Yugoslavia ' s isolation , with nary a word about the war still raging on its western border . Questions linger about the sincerity of Milosevic ' s vow that he is cutting_off war supplies to Bosnian Serb rebels -- a promise that won him partial relief from U.N. sanctions imposed in May , 1992 , in punishment for his having instigated the Bosnian war . U.S. Defense_Secretary William J . Perry told North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization allies in Spain last week that he had seen reports suggesting some leakage of war supplies despite the proclaimed cutoff . And German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel warned European Union states Tuesday that his government felt the Yugoslav border &quot; could be more effectively sealed. &quot; Even the U.N. Protection Force has conceded it has hundreds of reports from its troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina of nighttime Yugoslav army helicopter sorties into battle areas held by the Bosnian Serbs . But on Tuesday , retired Swedish Gen . Bo Pellnas , head of a 135-man border monitoring unit that is not yet fully deployed along the 300-mile frontier , informed the U.N. Security_Council that he had seen no evidence Serbia was shipping war materiel to Bosnian Serb allies -- a report that automatically triggered a 100-day trial lifting of sanctions prohibiting international air traffic in and out of Yugoslav airports and a ban that prevented cultural and sports contacts . Within hours , a Russian Aeroflot jet landed in Belgrade in a ceremonial reopening of the airport that had been in diplomatic mothballs for 28 months . The Yugoslav national carrier , JAT , planned to resume international_flights today . The Aeroflot Ilyushin-62 carried fewer than two_dozen passengers , but among them was Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S . Churkin , Moscow ' s special envoy for the Balkan crisis . &quot; It is a very significant day today , &quot; Churkin said upon arrival . &quot; ( Yugoslavia has ) firmly chosen the path of peace and political settlement. &quot; The restored links promise little real relief for an economy ravaged less by the U.N. blockade than by three years of bankrolling wars in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina . On the contrary , easing sanctions against Milosevic appears to be part of a strategy by outside powers to draw him into efforts to force signing of a peace plan that will nullify the issue of whether the United Nations should lift its arms embargo against the Bosnian government . A harsh dispute over the issue has driven a wedge between the United States and its allies in NATO . Countries with troops on the ground in Bosnia are against arming the Bosnians , while Washington favors correcting what it sees as an immoral imbalance . By intensifying pressure on the Bosnian Serbs , the five-nation Contact Group trying to force acceptance of its peace plan is probably gambling that Milosevic will eventually be able to depose Radovan Karadzic , his former proxy in the Bosnian Serb leadership . The Clinton_Administration has also reportedly drawn the Muslim-led Bosnian government into the plan to wait out the expected Serbian infighting . An Oct . 15 deadline Clinton set for the Bosnian Serbs to sign the proposed peace plan or face a rearmed government faction has been effectively put_off until spring , apparently because both Washington and the Sarajevo leadership doubt Karadzic can survive that long without support from Milosevic . But like all previous efforts to buy_time in hopes the Bosnian war will somehow burn itself out , a delay in lifting the arms embargo may only allow the plight of civilians to worsen while a cohesive strategy for ending the war continues to elude the international community . Heading into the third winter of Europe ' s worst bloodshed since World_War_II , both warring Bosnian factions are_better armed and more determined to hold their ground than they were a year ago . By contrast , 22 # 000 troops of the U.N. mission are now focused more on protecting their own ranks than on assisting the beleaguered populations in U.N. &quot; safe areas &quot; they were dispatched to protect .</TEXT>
