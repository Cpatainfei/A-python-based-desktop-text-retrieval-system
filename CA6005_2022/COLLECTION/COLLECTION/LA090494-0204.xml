   <HEADLINE> NUCLEAR POWER ' S COSTS ARE HIGHEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Your article &quot; San Onofre Proposal Generates Renewed Debate &quot; ( Aug . 21 ) addressed the current controversy regarding the proposal to close the San Onofre nuclear_power plant . Although the article did an excellent job in presenting the various sides of this issue , there was one significant error which should be corrected . In a sidebar to the article a comparison was made of the relative costs of different sources of electricity in 1993 . This indicated that the cost of using natural_gas to produce electricity was roughly 3 cents per kilowatt_hour , 1.22 cent / kwh for coal , and only 0.537 cent / kwh for nuclear_power . This indicates that nuclear_power was by far the cheapest source of electricity in 1993 . Nothing could be further from the truth . The figures cited in this sidebar only account_for the fuel cost of producing electricity , ignoring all_the other associated costs . Southern California Edison ' s total cost for nuclear_power in 1993 was over 8 cents / kwh . SCE ' s comparable cost of gas-generated power was under 5 cents / kwh , as was the cost of electricity from coal resources . The incomplete values presented in your article present a misconception that nuclear generation is inexpensive . Rather than being a bargain , nuclear_power is one of the primary reasons California has among the highest electricity rates in the country .
