   <HEADLINE> U.S. A-BOMB CHIEF ALLEGEDLY LEAKED SECRETS ; ESPIONAGE : A FORMER SOVIET SPYMASTER SAYS THAT THE LATE J . ROBERT OPPENHEIMER PASSED NUCLEAR DATA TO AGENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Soviet spy chief ' s memoirs published here today claim that the late J . Robert Oppenheimer , head of the U.S. atomic_bomb project during and after World_War_II , passed nuclear secrets to Soviet agents . The allegations were made by Gen . Pavel Sudoplatov , who was in_charge of efforts to obtain atomic secrets from the West , and excerpts of them ran in the Sunday Telegraph . Time magazine will print excerpts in today ' s issue . The memoirs charge that Oppenheimer , a University of California physicist known as &quot; the father of the atomic_bomb , &quot; condoned and assisted in the flow of vital nuclear secrets . Oppenheimer was director of the Los Alamos project in New Mexico , which built the bomb from atomic fuel manufactured in Oak Ridge , Tenn. , and Hanford , Wash . The entire operation was known by the code name &quot; Manhattan Project. &quot; After the first test explosion July 16 , 1945 , two subsequent bombs were dropped over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August , ending the Pacific war . From 1947 to 1952 , Oppenheimer was chairman of the general advisory committee of the Atomic Energy Commission , but in December , 1953 , his top-secret security clearance was revoked because of his alleged Communist associations in the 1930s and 1940s . He was never charged with a crime . At the time , many liberal Americans believed that Oppenheimer was a victim of a witch hunt led by Sen . Joseph McCarthy and his followers . Oppenheimer , known as &quot; Oppie , &quot; became the focus of a bitter fight between liberals and fierce anti-Communists . But Oppenheimer ' s reputation appeared to be rehabilitated by President John F . Kennedy , who invited him to a dinner at the White_House for Nobel Prize_winners in 1962 . He died in 1967 . In 1963 , Oppenheimer won the Atomic Energy Commission ' s Enrico Fermi Award for contributions to theoretical physics and administrative leadership . Of the new book , British historian Robert Conquest , reached in California by the Sunday Telegraph , declared : &quot; These memoirs show that Oppenheimer was_on the edge of committing treason. &quot; Sudoplatov charges that Elizabeth Zarubina , wife of the Soviet intelligence head in Washington , cultivated Oppenheimer socially . Zarubina persuaded Oppenheimer to share atomic secrets with &quot; anti-fascists of German origin , &quot; Sudoplatov says . The memoir , &quot; Special Tasks , &quot; declares : &quot; We received reports on the Manhattan_Project from Oppenheimer and his friends in oral form , through comments and asides , and from documents transferred through clandestine methods with their full knowledge that the information they were sharing would be passed_on . &quot; In all there were five classified reports made available by Oppenheimer describing the progress of work_on the atomic bomb. &quot; The Soviet spy chief said they took pains not to enlist Oppenheimer as an agent . &quot; We understood that he and other members of the scientific community were_best approached as friends , not as agents. &quot; The Russians also received photos of the facilities at Oak Ridge , the book says . &quot; The Soviet bomb was constructed in three years , &quot; Sudoplatov says . &quot; Without the intelligence contribution , there could have been no Soviet bomb that quickly. &quot;</TEXT>
