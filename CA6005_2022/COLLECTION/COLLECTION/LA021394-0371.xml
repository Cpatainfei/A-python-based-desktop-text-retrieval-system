   <HEADLINE> MURDOCH TRIES TO DIG WAY_OUT OF ASIA HOLE ; STAR TV : THE MEDIA MOGUL ' S REMARKS RAISED POLITICAL HACKLES IN THE FAR_EAST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rupert Murdoch is learning the politics of global TV the hard way . Weeks after acquiring control of Star TV , the linchpin of his worldwide television empire , Murdoch managed to offend some of his most important viewers -- Asian political_leaders -- when he declared satellite TV to be an &quot; unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere. &quot; The remarks , part of a speech made in London and beamed live to a Hong Kong breakfast given by Star TV , startled the Chinese in the audience . Shortly afterward , the Beijing government passed a law to curb use of satellite dishes in China -- a step that could undercut Star TV ' s viewership . The Chinese crackdown was followed by a similar rebuke from Malaysian Prime_Minister Mahathir Mohammad , who has long been suspicious of the Western media . Why , Mahathir wondered , did Murdoch -- known for using his media properties to advance his own agenda -- buy control of Star TV &quot; if he is not going_to control the news that we are going_to receive ? &quot; The backlash prompted Murdoch to make a goodwill trip to Beijing and Kuala Lumpur . And it revealed the kinds of obstacles outsiders face as they establish themselves in Asia , where many rulers are sensitive to the intrusion of Western news and entertainment . Beijing ' s clampdown &quot; was a signal to Murdoch that he couldn ' t go_on providing ( satellite TV ) without taking_heed , &quot; said John Kaye of Survey Research Group in Hong Kong . In fact , in the nearly seven months since Murdoch ' s News Corp . took_over Star TV , the new management team at the satellite TV service has managed to offend or alienate many members of Asia ' s power elite . While perhaps not fatal , News Corp. ' s missteps mean Murdoch will end_up having to spend a lot more money -- and time -- getting Star TV off the ground than he had imagined . The satellite network -- whose offerings include the BBC World Service TV , MTV Asia and Prime Sports -- beams five channels to 53 countries over an area that stretches from Indonesia across China , India and the Middle_East . More_than 2.5 billion people -- about two-thirds of the world ' s population -- fall_under Star TV ' s satellite shadow . The potential audience is big enough to dwarf the viewership of the four American networks combined , but until recently , most of those countries had only one or two state-run TV channels , and programming was heavily censored . Political problems have , for now , forced Murdoch to shift most of his attention to Star TV ' s faster-growing Indian market . The company also is rethinking its English-only programming policy , which has drawn tepid response from advertisers . And potential allies have emerged instead as competitors in the wide-open market . that ' s quite a switch from last summer , when pundits declared Murdoch ' s $ 525-million purchase of a 63.6 % stake in the pan-Asian satellite broadcaster had given him the final and most crucial component in his global TV web . News Corp . executives deny that Star TV has presented any major surprises . They insist that growth_rates and operating results are in_line with expectations and , in some cases , exceed them . Murdoch ' s experience is important because he is the forerunner among a cadre of satellite broadcasters racing to introduce television to every nook_and_cranny around the world . Last month , Discovery Channel went_on the air in Asia , joining other American channels such_as CNN , ESPN and HBO . Later this year , Ted Turner ' s TNT and Cartoon Network will jointly launch their own pan-Asian satellite channel . Disney is considering its own pan-Asian channel . Tele-Communications Inc. and Dow Jones &amp; Co . are partners in Asian Business News . And several Asian companies are hoping to start &quot; indigenous &quot; satellite channels . &quot; Right now , Star TV is catching all_the flak , &quot; said Gary Brown , regional media director at the Leo Burnett advertising_agency in Hong Kong . &quot; It ' s the first time anybody has put_up a satellite system to over 50 countries . Whatever the outcome , broadcasting in Asia has been changed forever. &quot; The troubles Star TV faces were underscored by Murdoch ' s arrival in Hong Kong early this month . The globe-trotting media chief , who had lately made his base in Los Angeles , has rented a house on The Peak , the tony neighborhood overlooking Hong Kong ' s harbor . From there Murdoch , on his private G-4 jet , is embarking_on missions to India and other countries , meeting with government_ministers and potential business partners who will play pivotal roles in Star TV ' s success or failure . * Given the turmoil of recent months , Star TV deserves Murdoch ' s undivided attention . A legal dispute with Hong Kong ' s cable TV operator has kept Star TV off what is expected to become the world ' s biggest cable TV system . Star TV also fell_out with its advertising sales agent for the lucrative Taiwan market . The company ' s staff has been slashed 20 % , to 620 employees . Potentially troublesome is an escalating feud with Viacom over its license agreement for MTV Asia . Viacom has been pressing for an equity stake in the channel , but Star TV has refused to budge . At the same time , Sony , Time Warner and Viacom are negotiating to buy a stake in Hong Kong-based satellite broadcaster TVB , the world ' s biggest producer of Chinese-language programming . Star TV could suffer if the media giants ' movie studios , Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros. , funnel their films exclusively to TVB . Star TV ' s hardball tactics could turn_out to be a costly mistake when Murdoch starts new pay TV channels later this year and needs films for broadcasting . Before Murdoch ' s arrival , executives had hoped to enlist the major Hollywood studios in a joint_venture for new pan-Asian pay TV channel , but the Murdoch management team scotched the plan . Star TV also has been plagued by management turmoil . It has had five managing directors in 2 1 / 2 years , three of them within the last six months . Gary Davey , the latest , is a former executive with Murdoch ' s BSkyB in London and a protege of Sam Chisholm , the salty News Corp . director who oversees satellite TV operations . ( Chisholm ' s trademark opening question on meeting new Star TV employees : &quot; How much we pay you ? &quot; ) * After a spate of bad publicity , Star TV last month released a survey it commissioned that showed the satellite service was received in 42 million homes , including 30 million in China , 7 million in India and 2.4 million in Taiwan -- representing growth of 279 % in one year . For the most part , however , Star TV cannot say how many people who are able to receive its signals actually watch any of the five channels . In Taiwan , where sophisticated measurement is possible , Star TV says a recent ratings survey found it achieved an average 7.8 % share of the audience , with its Mandarin-dialect Chinese Channel drawing twice as_many viewers as the other four . Murdoch clearly did not foresee many of Star TV ' s problems when he bought the service . He chased after it in typical Murdoch style , hastily negotiating the investment in 48 hours with Richard Li , who ran the service for his magnate father , Li Ka-shing . The 28-year-old Li flew to the Mediterranean to meet Murdoch , Chisolm and Fox Inc.executive Chase Carey on Murdoch ' s yacht , The Morning_Glory , and cut the deal . &quot; He didn ' t do any due diligence , &quot; said Craig Erlicht , a Hong Kong banker and former Star TV executive . &quot; Murdoch bought_into a cash flow that , to a large extent , was disappearing. &quot; Still , it could be argued that if anyone can make Star TV succeed it ' s Murdoch , who has a track record , from Fleet_Street to Fox , of turning troubled businesses into immensely profitable franchises . Only two years ago , BSkyB -- Murdoch ' s satellite TV service in Britain -- was losing $ 15 million a week . After a merger with its chief rival , the company is now in the black . And Murdoch started the Fox network in the United States to a chorus of naysayers predicting it couldn ' t be done . Despite persistent reports in the Hong Kong press that Star TV is losing between $ 60 million and $ 80 million annually , Murdoch recently told The Times that the service will lose no more_than $ 20 million in the fiscal_year ending June 30 . Analysts peg its revenues at between $ 60 million and $ 70 million . Since Star TV is &quot; free-to-air &quot; -- meaning the signal is not scrambled and anyone with a satellite dish can receive it -- advertising support is crucial to Murdoch ' s strategy . Under Li Ka-shing , Star TV inaugurated the &quot; foundation advertising program , &quot; in which 80 advertisers each commited to initial expenditures of $ 2 million . In many cases , Li -- a Hong Kong real_estate tycoon -- leveraged his business_relationships into advertising contracts . * The problem is that many of these early advertisers , such_as Japan ' s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , bought ads only out of loyalty to Li . Many of them are not renewing . Leo Burnett ' s Brown estimated that only about 20 % of Star TV ' s advertising time is sold . &quot; They are working hard to improve that , but there are few marketers that want to say the same things to the vast markets of China and India , &quot; he said . Obstacles imposed by the Beijing government have forced Murdoch to rethink his strategy , as well . The quiet shift entails focusing immediate resources on India , which is more open_to Western culture and is rapidly commercializing TV . In addition , Star TV acquired a 49.9 % stake in Zee TV , a fast-growing Hindi-language satellite TV channel in India . And Star hopes to enter the subscription TV business later this year when it launches the first of what are expected to be several pay TV channels . &quot; In terms of prioritizing their markets , India is now No . 1 , because of the ( satellite dish ) curb in China , &quot; said Steven Li , an analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities in Hong Kong . &quot; India is more developed , and the TV market more liberalized . China is longer term. &quot; Although News Corp . executives deny that China has been put_on the back burner , people close to Star TV say that Murdoch had his sights set_on China when he first bought_into the company . In part , that reflected a strategy inherited from Li Ka-shing , whose good relations with the Beijing government signaled easy access and robust growth . Star TV also is having to move away from its dedication to being an English-language programming service aimed at the wealthiest 5 % of viewers . Instead , the emphasis will be_on developing indigenous-language channels . &quot; The lesson from Star TV is that you can ' t be all things to all people , &quot; said Andre Nair , managing director of Ogilvy Media Asia in Hong Kong . &quot; The advertising hasn ' t been there . A marketer in India may_not be interested in Asia. &quot; Although Beijing is fostering the growth of cable in China , most TV executives in the region say the policy owes as much to the government wanting to control content as it does to the economic benefits . Especially sensitive is the_matter of the BBC World Service news channel carried by Star TV , which has broadcast reports embarrassing to the Chinese government . A Li-era contract prohibits Star from dropping the BBC , but Murdoch is trying to negotiate a deal that would substitute documentary and educational programming for the_British news service . Others believe that Murdoch wants to supplant the BBC with news programming from BskyB and Fox . With Star TV ' s attention shifting to India , however , Murdoch is said to have become acutely aware of the need to find politically well-connected partners who can ease entry into that market of nearly 900 million people . Possible candidates : Bennett Coleman &amp; Co. , owner of the prestigious Times of India newspaper , and Hindustan Times , the country ' s second-largest newspaper group . But Murdoch will face new competition as India loosens media controls . &quot; The Bold &amp; the Beautiful &quot; and &quot; Santa Barbara &quot; on Star TV have become cult with middle-class Indian women dissatisfied with the state-run TV service . But new Indian TV_stations are expected to be much more market-driven in their programming . And , across Asia , the coming onslaught of popular programming from satellite-broadcast competitors has Star TV on the run . &quot; Now they are in a situation of come-from-behind , &quot; one former Star TV executive said privately . &quot; They blew a tremendous lead. &quot; Murdoch ' s Global Television Empire Rupert Murdoch has built Australia-based News Corp . into a globe-spanning media web . Television accounts_for roughly 15 % of News Corp . revenue . Other properties include the Fox movie studio , leading British and Australian newspapers and the HarperCollins publishing group . U.S. TV Holdings : Fox Broadcasting Co. : Analysts estimate that America ' s fourth network will have revenue of $ 630 million and operating income of $ 88 million in the year ending June 30 . Fox TV_Stations : Eight stations in major markets , including KTTV-Channel 11 in Los Angeles , WFLD in Chicago and WNYW in New York . Estimated revenue is $ 588 million this year , with operating income of $ 222 million . U.K. TV Holdings : British Sky Broadcasting : News Corp . owns a 50 % interest in the six-channel satellite TV service . BSkyB has 3.25 million subscribers . Revenue for 1994 is estimated at $ 855 million , with operating income of $ 264 million . Asian TV Holdings : Star TV : News Corp . owns 63.9 % of the five-channel , pan-Asian satellite TV service beamed to 53 countries . Estimated revenue is $ 70 million , with a loss of $ 20 million expected for 1994 . Zee TV : News Corp . owns 49.9 % of this Hindi-language satellite service , available in 7 million Indian households . Estimated 1994 revenue is $ 24 million .
