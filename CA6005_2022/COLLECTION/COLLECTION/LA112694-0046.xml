   <HEADLINE> MCMILLAN ON HEMET SUIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After reading Susan Carpenter McMillan ' s Column Right , &quot; Ultra-Liberals Fight Morality in the Schools &quot; ( Nov . 15 ) , we must respond and set the record straight . The Hemet School_Board is being sued for its implementation of Sex Respect , Teen Aid , and Choosing the Best by a group of concerned parents who have children in the school district . Attorneys from Planned Parenthood , People for the American Way , and the law_firm McCutchen , Doyle , Brown and Enersen are representing the parents in this suit . We support their efforts not because we are &quot; middle-aged proponents of . . . free-love &quot; as McMillan suggests . We oppose the curricula because they are medically inaccurate , racist and gender-biased . In our 60 years of service , Planned Parenthood has always supported the teaching of abstinence as the wisest choice for young people . The endless campaign to misrepresent the goals of Planned Parenthood has grown tiresome , and has fooled very few . Each year , thousands of churches , schools and community organizations invite Planned Parenthood to present comprehensive sexuality education because they know they will get the facts from us . Planned Parenthood educators discuss ways teens can say no , reject peer pressure and make responsible decisions about their sexuality . We cannot expect every teen to delay sexual_activity . The fact McMillan conveniently overlooks is that well_over half of American teens have already engaged in sexual_intercourse by the time they graduate from high_school . Should teens face unwanted pregnancy because people like McMillan feel their behavior is immoral ? Should young_girls who are forced into unwanted sexual_activity be led to believe they are at_fault because Sex Respect taught them that boys have difficulty controlling their hormones ? Should sexually active teens be denied information about HIV / AIDS that could potentially save their lives because of the narrow-mindedness of the Hemet school_board majority ? Additionally , Planned Parenthood has always believed that parents should be the primary sexuality educators of their children . Planned Parenthood supports parental involvement and school-based sexuality education . We are not suing school_systems that dare to teach abstinence , we are suing school_systems that persist_in denying lifesaving sexuality information to their students . BETH CALLETON , JON DUNN , MARK SALO , SUELLEN WOOD , Southern California Executive_Directors , Planned Parenthood * Certainly writer-commentator Susan McMillan ought to know better . The ACLU is her support rather than the &quot; ultra-liberal sidekick &quot; of any pressure_group , for the very press freedom which she lives_by -- no less than the rest of us -- is alive and well in this country in large part because the First_Amendment has its watchdog the ACLU . And I wonder whether McMillan has ever lived and worked abroad , for surely she would have found that press freedom is rare indeed elsewhere . To be sure , teen-age sex is the issue upon which writers are hired to be helpful and are expected not to be carried_away by the emotions of the moment . It enlightens nobody to accuse Planned Parenthood of advocating free_love . Also missing from McMillan ' s competence is awareness of ACLU ' s limitations . It is funded in pennies and does jobs in dollars . Rather than ambulance-chasing as McMillan suggests , ACLU ' s intercession in this case is indicative_of a critical constitutional issue involved under ACLU criteria . As a reporter in New York in 1938 , I learned to rely_on the ACLU and have supported it ever since . It is our ultimate press support , while our free press is our ultimate democracy support .
