   <HEADLINE> RABIN TELLS RIGHTISTS HE WON ' T REMOVE SETTLERS ; ISRAEL : BUT PREMIER APPEARS TO LEAVE OPEN POSSIBILITY OF EVACUATING HEBRON ' S 415 JEWS IN THE FUTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin told opposition leaders Friday that his government has no intention of evacuating Jewish settlers from the occupied West_Bank town of Hebron , a key Palestinian demand after the Feb . 25 massacre of about 30 Arab worshipers in Hebron ' s Cave of the Patriarchs . In a meeting meant to diffuse a torrent of criticism from Israel ' s political right of Thursday ' s unprecedented agreement to permit armed , international observers in Hebron , the prime_minister stressed that &quot; at this stage &quot; of peace negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization , the government has dropped the issue of Hebron ' s settlers from the agenda , according to opposition leaders and Rabin ' s aides . That wording appeared to leave open the possibility of removing the 415 settlers in the future . Rabin ' s assurance , which met with mixed reviews from Israel ' s political right , came as the potentially explosive issue began to tear_into the state ' s very foundations . Senior Israeli officials indicated Friday that the government ' s decision to permit foreign troops in the occupied lands for the first time in a quarter of a century was not only a compromise to persuade the PLO to return to talks on permanent Palestinian autonomy , but also an attempt to compromise on an internal Israeli debate on the settlements issue . One member of Rabin ' s government publicly linked the two issues Friday . In an interview on Israel Radio , Economics Minister Shimon Shetreet declared that he hopes the agreement to permit the armed observer force will end the debate over the settlers . &quot; I hope that the fact that there are international observers , that all those who suggest moving_out the Jewish residents of Hebron will stop talking_about it , &quot; said Shetreet , who is considered one of the most conservative members of Rabin ' s Cabinet . &quot; This is enough , &quot; he said . After Brooklyn-born physician Baruch Goldstein ' s attack on praying Palestinians in the mosque at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron , the PLO demanded that the government remove the settlers from Hebron . Reports followed that the government was weighing plans either to evacuate or consolidate the handful of small settlements in the heart of a city with more_than 100 # 000 angry Palestinians -- a situation that Rabin had called &quot; a potential time bomb. &quot; The political opposition warned that such action against the settlers , who assert that their right to live_on land that Israel occupied during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War is grounded in the biblical references_to Hebron as the first Israelite community in Canaan , could polarize the nation . Debate over the issue took a dire turn Wednesday when a right-wing religious party , the National Religious Party , released a ruling by three influential rabbis instructing Israeli soldiers to disobey any direct order to forcibly remove Jews from Hebron . Rabin ' s response to the rabbinical ruling was swift and angry . In a news_conference Thursday night , he called it &quot; irresponsibility unprecedented since the creation of the state of Israel. &quot; Senior military commanders , leaders of Rabin ' s Labor_Party and members of his leftist coalition government sought to isolate the rabbis and the religious party that follows their rulings . Labor_Party General Secretary Nissim Zvili called the three religious_leaders , among them one of Israel ' s former chief rabbis , &quot; an example of rabbis who have lost their way . They are extremists who are led by unbalanced marginal forces , and their rulings could result in civil war. &quot; But the government clearly was concerned about the implications of their ruling at a time when it is involved in delicate negotiations with a former sworn enemy . Deputy Defense Minister Mordechai Gur met with one of the rabbis , former Israeli Chief Rabbi Avraham Shapira , in an unsuccessful effort to get him to withdraw it . &quot; I wanted to make clear to him the potential dangers and possible consequences of a call to a soldier to disobey orders . . . a decision that could bring_about the collapse of Israeli society , &quot; Gur said after meeting with Shapira on Thursday . A poll published by the Hebrew daily Yediot Aharonot on Friday found that 81 % of Israeli citizens interviewed said they would disapprove if Israeli soldiers obeyed the rabbis and refused direct orders from their commanders to remove the settlers . But the question put another way yielded a partially contradictory result : One in five Israelis would endorse military disobedience based on religious commands . Several right-wing opposition leaders also appeared to endorse the rabbinical decision . And it was praised by many speakers at a rally Thursday of thousands of settlers celebrating the 26-year-old Hebron settlements , which revived a Jewish community that had fled after 67 Jews were massacred there in a series of Arab uprisings in 1929 . The settlers ' demonstration took_place at Kiryat Arba , which was home to Goldstein . Some of the settlers who spoke at the rally praised the man who had fired more_than 100 bullets into the crowded Ibrahim Mosque inside the traditional burial place of Abraham . It was against that backdrop that Rabin ' s government agreed Thursday to the international observer force as a concession to the PLO . In exchange , PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat appeared to drop his demand that the Jewish settlers be removed from Hebron immediately . It remained unclear after Rabin ' s meeting with the opposition Friday whether the Israeli-PLO agreement , which had triggered another round of angry condemnations from the political right on Thursday , would end the debate over the rabbinical ruling .</TEXT>
