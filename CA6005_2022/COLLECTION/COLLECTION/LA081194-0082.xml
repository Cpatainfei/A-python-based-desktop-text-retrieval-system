   <HEADLINE> OIL FIRM , FOREMAN TO PLEAD NO CONTEST IN SPILL ; COURTS : BERRY PETROLEUM CRUDE LEAKED INTO MCGRATH LAKE FOR FOUR DAYS LAST YEAR IN THE COUNTY ' S WORST SUCH INCIDENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Both the oil_company and foreman responsible_for Ventura County ' s worst pipeline spill ever have agreed to plead no contest to separate misdemeanor charges in Municipal Court next week , a prosecutor said Wednesday . Under the settlement to be formalized in court next Wednesday , attorneys for Berry Petroleum and production official Ralph Edmonds will not admit any criminal wrongdoing . But the no-contest pleas are equal_to guilty pleas , except that they cannot be used against the defendants in establishing any civil liability related to the criminal case . State regulators are still piecing together a civil case against Berry that could result in further penalties . &quot; Berry has requested that we not disclose any of the details until the time of the arraignment , &quot; said Glen M . Reiser , the special prosecutor retained earlier this year by the Ventura County district_attorney . &quot; The judge has to order the stipulation into effect on the 17th , &quot; he said . &quot; So it ' s not a done deal until the gavel hits the bench. &quot; Berry Petroleum operated an underground pipeline along Harbor Boulevard near Oxnard that ruptured Dec . 21 , 1993 , and spilled 84 # 000 gallons of heavy crude into the wetlands at McGrath Lake for four days before being noticed . Thousands of gallons were then pushed into the Pacific_Ocean , forcing the closure of seven miles of coastline and necessitating a two-month cleanup effort . Hundreds of birds coated with oil died as a result of the spill . The company will plead no contest to a single misdemeanor charge of failing to notify regulatory officials about the leak , Reiser said . The penalty will be limited to a &quot; substantial &quot; monetary fine to be distributed to state and local environmental restoration funds , Reiser said . He refused to say how much the fine would be until the court appearance . Attorney Larry L . Hines , who represents Berry Petroleum , declined to discuss the settlement Wednesday , saying his clients would wait until next Wednesday &quot; to give the company ' s version of these events. &quot; But the oil_company already has filed claims against six local agencies for failing to respond to early reports of the spill . The leak was not discovered for four days , when federal inspectors noticed a sheen of oil on the ocean west of McGrath Lake on Christmas morning . Several area law_enforcement agencies had been alerted to the spill at least a day before and failed to respond , the company claims . Edmonds , the production foreman on_duty at the time the pipeline broke , will plead no contest to a misdemeanor charge of illegally releasing oil or petroleum products into a state waterway , the prosecutor said . He will face &quot; an agreed-upon punishment , which is not insignificant &quot; when he is sentenced sometime after he enters his plea , the prosecutor said . Edmonds still works for Bush Oil , the Berry Petroleum subsidiary that operated the ruptured pipeline . He did not return phone_calls Wednesday . His attorney , Lou Carpiac of Ventura , is traveling out of the country and could not be reached for comment . John C . Orr , a partner in Carpiac ' s law_firm , declined to discuss the agreement Wednesday . Reiser said Edmonds is a former Navy seaman who has worked for Bush Oil for about five years . It is his first job supervising an oil_production facility . He sold production equipment for several years previously , Reiser said . The prosecutor said Edmonds ' relative lack of experience probably contributed to his alleged failure to notice that tens of thousands of gallons of oil never reached the storage_tank it was being pumped into . Because they view Edmonds as ultimately responsible_for the leak , prosecutors insisted that he be charged separately in the case . The oil_company agreed in June to plead no contest to a single charge , although prosecutors would not specify whether it was a misdemeanor or felony . &quot; The idea of ( Edmonds ) proceeding to trial all by himself was not too enticing , &quot; Reiser said .</TEXT>
