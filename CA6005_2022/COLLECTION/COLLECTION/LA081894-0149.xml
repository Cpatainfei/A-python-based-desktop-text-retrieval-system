   <HEADLINE> GARDEN GROVE TIGHTENS RULES ON FOODS SERVED AT FESTIVALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The City_Council has approved tougher restrictions on food and drink sold or given_away at the Strawberry Festival , the Korean Festival and other community events . Under an ordinance approved by a 4-1 vote Tuesday , only food prepared in restaurants or at the festival grounds -- and inspected by health officials -- may be sold at the events . The council passed the law to minimize improper food handling . The restrictions would cover the annual chili cook-off , a popular contest for the best chili recipe , and the Strawberry Festival held each year during Memorial_Day weekend . &quot; There should not be a problem for us , &quot; said Barbara Burch , president of the Strawberry Festival , where food and drinks are prepared on site . City_Manager George Tindall said the ordinance would make current Orange County health regulations tougher and allow city officials to close food booths that do not meet health standards . No alcohol may be sold at the festivals . The council will consider the ordinance for final approval Sept . 6 . A provision to require police_officers or firefighters to check the temperature of the food at the food booths was deleted from the ordinance . Instead , county health officials will be required to make_sure that spoiled food is not sold . But the ordinance requires workers at each food booth to have a food thermometer . &quot; I have a problem with cops and firemen being ( on ) a hot dog patrol , &quot; said Mayor Frank Kessler , a former Garden Grove police_chief . &quot; We can ' t have them around checking &quot; thermometers . Councilman Mark Leyes , who voted against the ordinance , said that the law did not provide a way for the city to recover the cost of inspecting the food booths . He added that the ordinance did not define clearly what constitutes &quot; potentially hazardous food &quot; that must be inspected . According to the state Health and Safety Code , potentially hazardous food is defined as any food capable of &quot; supporting rapid and progressive growth of microorganisms that may cause food infections. &quot; Hot dogs , hamburgers , pizza , baked potatoes , chili and other foods are sold in booths operated by the Kiwanis , Girls and Boys Clubs and other local service groups at the Strawberry Festival . This year , the festival raised more_than $ 100 # 000 for local charities , Burch said . The Korean Festival will be held Oct . 14-16 on Garden Grove Boulevard . Sponsored by the Korean Chamber_of_Commerce of Orange County , it has been held for the past 11 years . In addition to food booths , the festival features cultural shows and a parade by members of the county ' s Korean American community .</TEXT>
