   <HEADLINE> WHY MARTIN_LUTHER KING JR . IS A GAY-RIGHTS HERO ; HIS LIFE AND HIS MESSAGE RESONATE BEYOND THE FIGHT AGAINST RACIAL PREJUDICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One heated controversy in the civil-rights community is whether the struggle by lesbian and gay Americans for equal citizenship is a legitimate part of that movement . Increasingly , lesbians and gays are using the imagery and rhetoric of the traditional civil-rights movement for their own struggle . This was symbolized at the April 1993 March_on Washington -- the tactic itself borrowed from Martin_Luther_King Jr . -- by a placard that read &quot; Thank you , Dr. King. &quot; Some civil-rights leaders like Coretta Scott King , Benjamin Chavis of the NAACP and Jesse Jackson have made_it clear that sexual orientation is a civil-rights issue and must be regarded_as such ; other leaders of the coalition that comprised the civil-rights movement have been reluctant to make the leap from race to sexual orientation . The strong religious roots of the crusade for African American freedom are a frequent stumbling_block on this issue . Like most churches , black churches are at best divided over homosexuality . Many tend to accept the disputed notion that homosexuality is a sin and to ignore the considerable evidence that whatever revelation there is_on this subject is human , not divine . The appropriation by gays and lesbians of the rhetoric and imagery of the movement in which these churches and their religious imagery played so crucial a role must seem not merely insulting , but sacrilegious . There also exists an understandable feeling of the part of many African Americans that the civil-rights struggles and its heroes such_as King belong_to them . It is unarguable that the struggle against discrimination by women , ethnic and sexual minorities and the disabled appropriate the history of Africans in the United States . Only native_Americans can be simply said to have so powerful a hold_on the notion of justice in this nation . It is possible still to say with Abraham_Lincoln and W.E.B. DuBois that the test of America ' s principles is how they remedy the injustices on its population of African origin . This sense of the dimensions of their persecution and their heroic movement for equality gives many black Americans the feeling that civil_rights is theirs and that its use by other groups , especially homosexuals , is a distortion and a theft . A third problem in addressing gay rights from the civil-rights perspective is prejudice . The prejudice against lesbians and gay_men and the routine dismissal of their claim that homosexual and heterosexual should be equal under the law is entrenched in society . This prejudice is reinforced by the tendency of other minorities to see gay rights as a movement of affluent white_men . This misperception does incalculable harm to the lesbian and gay members of_their_own communities , who are thereby doubly marginalized by race and sexual orientation . But how can gay_men and lesbians claim Martin_Luther_King Jr . as our hero ? He appears to have been relatively unbiased against gays , but never saw them in civil-rights terms . He relied_on Bayard Rustin ( and resisted many attempts to purge this brilliant strategist ) and read James Baldwin , but a private appreciation of gays , without public acknowledgment , is nothing new . What makes King our hero is his life and his message . Like gays , King met with as much resistance as support from the churches , black_and_white , that now routinely honor him . Like so may other great preachers and leaders , King transcended the roots of_his_own commitment , although he never abandoned them . His theological and philosophical journey took him to Gandhi and Thoreau and Niebuhr , and he brought them back with him . When the civil-rights movement seemed to stall in the mid- and late ' 60s , as legal racial_segregation was being dismantled , it was King who saw that war and class , poverty and urban realities were also civil-rights issues . We tend to forget how little welcome that message was and how many of his old allies deserted and dismissed him . The parallels between gay rights and traditional civil-rights causes are real . Slavery and racial_segregation were defended from the pulpit using some of the same biblical texts , including Leviticus , that are used to stigmatize gays . The major obstacle to gay rights is prejudice , supported , as is racial prejudice , through stereotypes . Like blacks , gays are regularly subjected_to grotesque sexual slander . Like the notorious color_line that enacted segregation , sodomy laws , state and local propositions and the ban against gays in the military enforce a lavender line of inequality for gays . The threat of violence easily gives_way to violent acts against lesbians and gay_men who threaten that line . For King , the point of the civil-rights movement was to secure equality and justice . He insisted that everybody must learn this lesson . He did not distinguish between the victims of injustice . He also realized that social justice and civil equality are not fixed commodities and that extending them to one disenfranchised group need not mean taking them away from others . King understood how abiding prejudice is and how many reasons people can find to rationalize their fears . It is often hard to tell the difference between honoring King ' s memory and carrying_on his work . His reach was so large and his concerns so many that reasonable people are bound to disagree about what his example means . It is exactly right for lesbians and gay_men to claim King for our hero because ours is a civil-rights movement . Our crusade for equal protection of the laws , the cessation of routine violence against us and our right to live morally serious lives in inspired by Martin_Luther_King Jr .</TEXT>
