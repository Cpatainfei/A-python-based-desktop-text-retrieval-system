   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEW ; ' THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE ' : IS IT A BOOK , PLAY OR MOVIE ? ; CARRIE SNODGRESS ABLY EXPLOITS HER ROLE IN A STAGING THAT UPDATES THE NOVEL AND CULT FILM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Similar to its brain-washed Korean_War veterans , &quot; The Manchurian Candidate &quot; suffers from an identity_crisis . Is it Richard Condon ' s 1959 novel that satirized Cold_War hysteria ? Is it John Frankenheimer ' s 1962 chilling film version that eerily prophesied the Kennedy assassination ? Or is it John Lahr ' s 1991 stage adaptation blending fiction and screenplay into a cautionary fable about media manipulation ? West Coast Ensemble ' s production can ' t make_up its mind . Although this &quot; Manchurian Candidate &quot; begins in bold Kabuki style , with extras assembled ceremonially in black kimono robes , director Jules Aaron and company gradually lose confidence in such theatrical storytelling . Distracting subplots from fiction ' s leisurely pace start to possess our imaginations . Minimalism ' s artifice is soon replaced by crowds and numerous locations , futile attempts to duplicate cinema ' s visual scope . This stylistic schizophrenia finally undermines its dramatic impact . Nevertheless , there is much to recommend here . Lahr is arguably the nation ' s best drama_critic ; his reviews for The New Yorker magazine demonstrate a rigorous intellect and a unique understanding among critics for the nuts-and-bolts of theater-making . Such knowledge gets applied to this adaptation , which is much more_than mere movie homage -- it ' s a legitimate stage translation . If nothing else , such understanding makes &quot; The Manchurian Candidate &quot; a provocative , if flawed , intellectual exercise . With Condon ' s encouragement , Lahr has updated the setting from the 1950s to &quot; sometime in the near future. &quot; Now the kidnaped American soldiers aren ' t in Korea but are members of a Mideast peacekeeping force . Instead of the Red Menace , Washington extremists are paranoid about a &quot; menace &quot; from Japan . But North_Korea remains an ominous player on the global stage , just as in Condon ' s original . And the concept of a hit_man under the control of a foreign government , assassinating politicians ? No need to update that nightmare . Nor does Lahr need to tamper much with Condon ' s finest creation , a contemporary Lady Macbeth named Eleanor Iselin who devours her senator husband and war-hero son in the pursuit of political power . Initially , Carrie Snodgress seems slightly intimidated by Angela Lansbury ' s classic screen portrait of the Machiavellian mother . But Lahr shrewdly allows the character ' s incestuous obsession for her son to be more obvious on stage than it is in the film . Snodgress exploits the perversions , transforming Iselin into an all-too-human monster . Making audiences forget Lansbury is no minor accomplishment . Tim Barber is less fortunate as returning war hero Raymond Shaw . He seems petrified by Laurence Harvey ' s icy screen brilliance . Unlike Snodgress , Barber isn ' t freed from the film by Lahr . Had Lahr brought Shaw ' s repressed homosexuality to the surface , Barber ' s tortured Momma ' s boy might have found more compelling acting choices . However , John Marzilli ' s work as the nightmare-driven , veteran Ben Marco is actually more believable than Frank Sinatra ' s , who was miscast in the film . And Frank Ashmore as a right-wing xenophobe is the perfect stereotype of a politician-for-hire . Under-heralded designer John Iacovelli once again masters a complex stage design , reproducing the story ' s Chinese puzzle-box structure in a series of Kabuki screens . Musical accompaniment by percussionist Sandy Kaye should also duplicate the sense of a classic Kabuki play , but the chimes tinkle like a soundtrack each time a character is gripped by hypnosis . Each irritating chime reminds us how unnecessary it is for theater to emulate movie effects . * &quot; The Manchurian Candidate , &quot; West Coast Ensemble , 6240 Hollywood Blvd. , Hollywood . Fridays-Saturdays , 8 p.m. ; Sundays , 3 p.m. Ends June 5 . $ 20 . ( 213 ) 871-1052 . Running time : 2 hours , 30 minutes .</TEXT>
