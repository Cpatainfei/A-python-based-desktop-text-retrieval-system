   <HEADLINE> JEWISH FANATICS IN HEBRON RAISE SPECTER OF CIVIL WAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Baruch Goldstein ' s murderous deed in Hebron has put the historic agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on hold . To revive the peace talks , many Israelis -- and Jews else where -- have called_for the forcible removal of Jews like Goldstein who live_in settlements surrounded by Arabs . Would such a move lead to Jew fighting Jew in the occupied territories ? Ever since Israel ' s victory in the Six-Day War , the &quot; doves &quot; in Israel have tended to think that any Jewish settlement was a mistake . They considered the territories a &quot; deposit &quot; to keep until the day came_to trade the land for peace . The various &quot; hawkish &quot; groups emphasized the historical , religious and biblical right of the Jewish people to settle wherever they wished in the land of Israel . To this view they always added the argument of security . A settlement was always a &quot; security asset. &quot; Most Israelis support the Alon Plan , named for Yigal Alon , a military_leader during the War of Independence . According to his plan , Israel is never to return to the borders that existed before the Six-Day War in 1967 . But it must_not absorb the Palestinian masses . The densely populated cities of Hebron , Nablus , etc. , are to remain Arab enclaves connected to Jordan by an Arab corridor . Israel retains &quot; only &quot; greater Jerusalem , Gush Etzion and the Jordan Valley . When the Likud Party held power , the principles of the Alon plan , especially with_regard_to settlement sites , were ignored . Settlements were the means to create an irreversible reality that would frustrate any future effort to trade land for peace . The name of the Likud game was : &quot; Not an inch ! &quot; Thus , we have &quot; mini &quot; villages consisting_of about 30 families each . Netzarim , Nissanit , Kefar Darom in the Gaza Strip are examples . And there are Jews in the heart of Hebron , among them zealots . When Tel Aviv imports psychopaths from Brooklyn -- it ' s bad enough . Put them together in Hebron , and you have a sure calamity on your hands . But Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , whose mentor was Alon , has good reasons to leave the Jewish settlers where they are -- at least for the time being : * It is important to understand Rabin ' s natural inclinations . Former Prime_Minister Menachem Begin represented &quot; political Zionism &quot; -- history is made by treaties , contracts , wars , annexations , peace , declarations and other political acts . Rabin is the golden_boy of &quot; practical Zionism &quot; -- in_order to have a land for one ' s people , one has to plow another acre , milk another cow , dig a new well , erect a new kibbutz . Thus , to uproot a Jewish settlement is , for him , as tough as evacuating Algeria was for Gen . Charles de Gaulle . * According to the agreement between Israel and the PLO , no settlement will be evacuated or relocated during the &quot; interim period &quot; -- that is , until at least April , 1996 . When Rabin resists the call to remove the Jews from Hebron , he is defending a principle embodied in the agreement . * In Israel domestic politics , evacuation may annoy many political_parties , putting the stability of the government at risk . * Rabin knows well the rules of negotiation . He wishes to retain bargaining assets for the crucial stage of talks that begin after 1996 , when settlements will be important to all concerned . Is it thus safe to assume that the Jewish settlers in Hebron , and in similar cities , will not be evacuated ? The massacre in Hebron highlighted a certain &quot; catch &quot; in the Declaration of Principles agreed to by Israel and the PLO . One of its paragraph states : &quot; In the redeployment of its forces , Israel will be guided by the principle that its military_forces should be redeployed outside the populated zones. &quot; The Hebron settlers are situated , alas , in the heart of a densely populated area . But according to another paragraph , Israel will continue to be responsible_for the overall safety of Israelis wherever they are , and will ensure and protect public order and security . If Israeli forces withdraw from Hebron , who then will protect Rabbi Moshe Levinger and his disciples ? Would it be the &quot; strong Palestinian police , &quot; soon to be established ? This is too optimistic . At most , it would an &quot; infant &quot; police_force . Rabin will thus have to postpone the withdrawal of the army , a breach of the agreement , or eject the settlers . Between these two alternatives there is only one choice : evacuation . In such a case , will a Jewish settler open_fire on Israeli soldiers ? I think not . The tensions , of course , will be enormous . Incidents will occur , but not a full-scale armed rebellion . It should be noted that any additional evacuation of settlements is unlikely to occur before November , 1996 . The talks on the final arrangement are scheduled for April , 1996 , but since they will be occurring in an election year , both political_parties will be reluctant to take any decisive steps beforehand . After November , it ' s a new ball_game . If the Likud wins the elections , there will be no evacuation , and the whole agreement will be in jeopardy . If Rabin wins , and his government leans_on a wider coalition , it will be Israel ' s hope that he will usher_in the peace . Even if shootings do occur in places like Hebron , they will be promptly silenced . Reluctant as he may be , Rabin will do what needs to be done . Amen .</TEXT>
