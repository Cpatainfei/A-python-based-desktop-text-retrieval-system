   <HEADLINE> CHINA ' S TRADE STATUS DICEY , BENTSEN SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> China would probably lose its most-favored-nation trade privileges with the United States if a decision were made now , despite the harm such a move could cause American business , U.S. Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Friday . Bentsen , speaking during a stop in Los Angeles on his way to a meeting of Asian-Pacific finance_ministers in Honolulu today , said the United States must balance its interests between fostering free_trade and promoting human_rights in Asia . Washington must avoid &quot; giving the competition an advantage &quot; by curtailing U.S.-China commerce , he said , but added that China ' s failure to make progress on human_rights puts its status in jeopardy . &quot; If the decision was made today , I ' d assume China would lose its MFN privileges , &quot; Bentsen said . &quot; We have until June , and we hope to work it out by then. &quot; The remark came_after the debacle of Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher ' s human_rights mission to Beijing one week ago , when a number of political_dissidents were jailed to stop them from trying to meet Christopher . Officials on both sides engaged in a vitriolic exchange , leaving China ' s continued trade privileges in serious doubt . Most-favored-nation trading status allows nations to export to the U.S. market under normal , low tariffs . Virtually all U.S. trading partners have MFN status ; notable exceptions are Iraq and Cuba . Because China is not a member of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , its MFN status is not automatic and must be renewed on an annual basis . Last June , President Clinton renewed the privilege on the condition that Beijing make &quot; significant progress &quot; in human_rights if it wanted another extension this year . The economic consequences of denying MFN to China are not clear . Beijing has warned that such a move could backfire and hurt U.S. interests more_than its own , because China ' s double-digit economic_growth increasingly relies_on domestic demand and intra-Asia trade . But Hong Kong , which serves as a conduit for a large portion of U.S.-China trade , stands to lose as much as $ 24 billion in annual trade if China ' s MFN status is rescinded , the colony ' s Trade Department said in a report released earlier this month . Bentsen , addressing a breakfast meeting sponsored by Town_Hall Los Angeles , said he hopes to &quot; build some communication and some trust &quot; when he meets today in Honolulu with the finance_ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation . Human_rights , however , is a taboo subject for the 17-member regional group , a diverse and loosely structured organization that has avoided contentious issues for the sake of maintaining a fragile consensus since it was founded in 1989 . Bentsen appeared unlikely to discuss MFN with his Chinese counterpart , Liu Zhongli , or talk tough with Japanese Finance_Minister Hirohisa Fujii about trade tensions between Tokyo and Washington . As of Friday , Bentsen was not scheduled to hold bilateral meetings with either delegate , a Treasury_Department spokesman said . &quot; I don ' t plan to go_in and twist arms and bully people around , &quot; Bentsen said . He was scheduled to meet one-on-one with Malaysian Finance_Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Hawaii , an encounter that will probably touch_on the most immediate problem facing APEC . Malaysia has been a strident opponent of strengthening the organization , while the United States and Australia have been pushing the group toward a policy-making role that might include sponsoring a regional free-trade arrangement in the Pacific . Malaysian Prime_Minister Mahathir Mohammad rejected an invitation from Clinton to join other Asian leaders at an APEC summit in Seattle last November . Mahathir advocates an alternative Asian trade grouping , the East Asian Economic Caucus , which excludes the United States , Australia , New Zealand and Chile -- all APEC members -- on the grounds that they are not Asian_nations .
