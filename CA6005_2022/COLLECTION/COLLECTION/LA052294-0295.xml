   <HEADLINE> DIALING UP THE BULLETIN_BOARD ; TECHNOLOGY : COMPUTERIZED INFORMATION SERVICES ARE CHANGING THE WAY COMPANIES , GOVERNMENTS DO BUSINESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Imagine you ' re a real_estate_broker with a maddeningly picky customer . Your client wants a one-story building with 100 # 000 square_feet of open space , parking for 150 cars , two loading docks , double-height ceilings and high-voltage power connections . And , oh yes , it must be close to a freeway . Standard practice had been to flip pages in a loose-leaf binder , where properties were listed first by square footage . That might produce 100 sites , which would then have to be sorted through for the remaining criteria . The Los Angeles-based American Industrial Real_Estate Assn . set_out some time ago to find a better way . The result is a simple computer_database and search program that includes all property listings of member brokers , who tap into this wealth of information by computer and modem . If markets once consisted_of paper and brokers waving hands , these days they are more often the purview of silicon_chips and disk_drives . To get_to them , companies and governments are increasingly making important information available on line -- not only text , but pictures too -- speeding these details in electronic form over phone_lines 24 hours a day . There are an estimated 53 # 000 public dial-up bulletin_boards operating in North_America today , according to Boardwatch magazine , a quirky journal of the trade . Once the province of low-rent nerds and budding electronic pornography vendors , computerized bulletin_boards -- BBS for short -- are now well-established as a mainstream business tool . They excel_at making lots of information manageable and accessible from anywhere . Realtors , travel_agents , conference planners , convention bureaus , flower growers , investors , manufacturers , advertising_agencies , graphic_artists , movie studios , newsletter services and government_departments are practicing electronic commerce on bulletin_boards or , more broadly , on-line communication services . It can be cheap and easy . &quot; We call it the $ 100 technology , &quot; says Troy Getty , a partner in Riverside-based Integrated Solutions Inc. , which installs and services bulletin_board_systems and communication services . Knowledgeable do-it-yourselfers can do the job for even less . A fairly powerful BBS can be put_together for less than $ 5 # 000 , and a rudimentary one can be mounted on a secondhand PC for slightly less than $ 1 # 000 . For business , one big draw is convenience . The commercial real_estate BBS , &quot; is an incredible timesaver , &quot; says James Gillespie , president of the American Industrial Real_Estate Assn . and associate vice_president at Los Angeles-based Daum Commercial Real_Estate Services . Information is kept more current . And under the old system , Gillespie says , &quot; after half an hour with the book you felt_like it was 5 o ' clock_in the afternoon , even if it was 10 in the morning. &quot; Gillespie says he can weed out many unsuitable properties within five minutes by specifying up_to several dozen criteria in an on-line computer search . To access the system , a broker uses a personal_computer to dial the service ' s computer , where the information is loaded . The service ' s computer searches the database for all properties matching the criteria specified and displays the requested information . ( A redesign will soon offer pictures with text. ) Many other kinds of businesses are also turning_to electronic_bulletin_boards . Advertising_agencies are logging_on to the Picture Exchange , which links stock houses ( and their thousands of photographs ) with people who use them , advertising_agencies and graphic_artists . Eastman Kodak Co . initiated the system and acts_as a middleman . &quot; Searching for images is a frustrating business , &quot; says Mike Harrigan , director of markets development at Kodak ' s headquarters in Rochester , N.Y. In the decades-old traditional process , ad_agencies would call a handful of photo stock houses , describe their needs and wait for the researchers to send samples by overnight mail . The process could cost $ 400 or more per search , with sometimes agonizing delays . Furthermore , responsibility for the search shifted out of the hands of the designer to a stock house researcher . In contrast , Kodak says a common search of the almost 20 stock houses on line would cost $ 52 . With the new system , &quot; you really get_to play_around , &quot; says Laurel Katz , a production artist at J . Walter Thompson , a New York ad_agency . Ask_for a photograph of a computer chip taken indoors at Christmas , with red and green dominating the image , and the computer will display thumbnail samples from its 100 # 000-picture database . It also accepts orders for overnight delivery and keeps track of the search time for each account . Users can even download a version of a picture by wire . In June , Kodak will begin testing a similar service to bring data on potential filming locations to movie studios . The idea is to let location scouts search for , say , antebellum mansions without calling all_over the South to find one . Last spring , New York-based American Lawyer magazine launched what is now Lexis Counsel Connect , an on-line service for lawyers offering electronic_mail , discussion forums and a place to share research . The service also offers a gateway to the Lexis legal database . New Jersey entrepreneur Maben Smith , once frustrated in his search for a business to buy , created Business Opportunities Online Inc. , a series of databases designed to match buyers and sellers of businesses , as well as investors with capital-hungry entrepreneurs and franchise seekers . On-line services may be useful , but it ' s still not easy to learn of them . Take the case of TravelFile , a Montana-based BBS that links travel suppliers and buyers with information on international travel , including ski reports , calendars of events , even a World Cup soccer timetable , as well as information about cruises , accommodations , tours and special discounts . Users can make bookings and send_for information with a_few keystrokes . The service is free to travel_agents through the Eaasy Sabre reservation system . Yet many agents don ' t even know it exists . Susan Mitchell , a travel_agent at Coronado Travel Bureau in Coronado , Calif. , is a convert . &quot; We have access to many_more bed-and-breakfast places . We can make printouts for our clients . We just love it , &quot; she says . Those who pay to be listed on TravelFile notice changes in the business they do . &quot; We received more_than a_million inquiries when we were Destination of the Month , &quot; says Monica Guinn , leader of the domestic tourism promotion division at the Las Vegas Convention Bureau . &quot; You feel you get a lot of mileage for your money. &quot; Ben Tyson , partner in a family-owned Radio Shack in Half Moon Bay , Calif. , learned about an electronic government procurement system known as GATEC from a customer who worked_at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , coordinator of the pilot_project . Tyson dials up GATEC and submits up_to 30 bids daily to supply electronic components , computers and electronic_equipment to the Defense_Department . &quot; It ' s opened new markets for us , &quot; he says . In the world of glamour and fashion , Ford Models Inc. will soon introduce a bulletin_board that will , in the words of president Joey Hunter , create &quot; an instant audition. &quot; Clients will dial in by computer to see a model moving and talking . Ford has teamed with Bob Olejar , president of Instant Exposure in New York , and Durand Communications of Santa Barbara in a test of the system , which it hopes will attract casting and advertising agencies . Even governments , sometimes stodgy and averse to public access , have jumped_on the call-in computer service bandwagon . Many government resources are available on the Internet , a global network of networks , but there is much available even for those lacking Internet access . The Small Business Administration started its first board 18 months ago and add a 900 number . The service lets users download or order SBA publications , files and lists of elected federal representatives . The 900 number also serves as a gateway to other government bulletin_boards . Authorities at FedWorld , a BBS owned and operated by the National Technical Information Service , have taken the trend toward digital even further . Starting this year , contractors who need wage information for bidding purposes can buy the data electronically for a fraction of the printed price . The Federal Drug Administration ' s Import Detention List , which allows suppliers to step_in to fill market gaps created by federal_agents seizing products at the border , will be delivered within 48 hours instead of three weeks . &quot; Our on-line services are going like crazy , &quot; says Robert Bunge , business manager at FedWorld . TECH TIPS ( Setting Up Your Own BBS ) You can create your own BBS with off-the-shelf software from companies such_as ESoft , Galacticom and Mustang . Companies such_as Integrated Solutions in Riverside and Durand Communications in Santa Barbara will sell you a turnkey project . For those who prefer to leave the work to others , they and companies such_as Business BBS in Los Angeles will maintain the system , send_out bills and update data .</TEXT>
