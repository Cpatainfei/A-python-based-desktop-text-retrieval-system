   <HEADLINE> BROTHERS HOOKING CUSTOMERS WITH BAJA-STYLE TACOS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cheong Lee , the longtime owner of Shanghai Pine Gardens restaurant on Balboa Island , chuckles at how his three sons have simplified the restaurant business at their Wahoo ' s Fish Taco chain . For starters , Lee ' s sons don ' t need highly trained , temperamental chefs in their kitchens . Wahoo ' s fish-based menu is noticeably shorter than Shanghai Pine Gardens ' complex bill_of_fare . And few individual items on Wahoo ' s menu cost more_than $ 5 . But Lee knows that the simple formula works because every day at lunch , the customers are lined_up at the Wahoo ' s restaurant on Bristol Street in Costa Mesa . The privately held chain is enjoying similar success at its flagship restaurant on Placentia Avenue in Costa Mesa , which opened in November , 1989 , and at a store on South Coast Highway in Laguna Beach . A fourth restaurant will open soon on Main_Street in Huntington Beach . &quot; My father has been ( in restaurants ) for 40 years , and now he knows that the restaurant business is about marketing , &quot; said Wing Lam , co-owner of Wahoo ' s with his brothers Ed Lee and Mingo Lee . &quot; You ' ve got_to get people in so they can see what you ' ve got. &quot; What Wahoo ' s has are fish tacos -- tortillas stuffed with fish , seasonings and cabbage , the kind that Southern California ' s surfers regularly buy from street vendors in Baja California . And , unlike Shanghai Pine Gardens ' kitchen , Wahoo ' s fare is relatively simple and easy to prepare , which helps keep costs down . Lam and fellow San Diego State University graduate Ralph Rubio acquired a taste for fish tacos during trips to Baja California . In 1988 , Rubio opened Rubio ' s , a San Diego-based chain with restaurants in Irvine and Tustin and 13 other locations . Two more Rubio ' s restaurants will open this year in Laguna Niguel and Costa Mesa . Lam and Rubio acknowledge that fish tacos , a relative unknown outside of Southern California , won ' t challenge hamburgers as a national favorite . But both believe that the tacos eventually will become more_than a regional food . &quot; What it boils_down to is that fish tacos just taste great , &quot; Rubio said . * Wahoo ' s broils its fish -- the chain also offers meat and chicken_tacos -- and rounds_out its basic offerings with rice and black_beans from Hawaii . Lam said the simple nature of the dish also makes_it possible to serve customers quickly , which is important for busy diners . Lam said fish tacos sell themselves -- as long as he ' s able to get customers in_for an initial taste . But rather than target mainstream restaurant-goers through heavy advertising_campaigns or coupon deals , Lam attracted business by converting &quot; opinion leaders &quot; and letting them tell friends about the merits of Wahoo ' s food . Lam initially courted surfers who eat fish tacos during surfing trips to Baja California . He solidified ties to the surf industry by catering corporate functions for surf apparel companies , and serves fish tacos to leading surfers during local contests . &quot; All those guys love to eat our stuff , &quot; Lam said . &quot; And they tell other people about us. &quot; Wahoo ' s also sponsors a high_school &quot; athlete of the week &quot; award through a local newspaper . Winners eventually stop by to grab a bite to eat_at Wahoo ' s and , Lam said , &quot; more important , they bring their friends along. &quot; Lam is forging similar relationships with leading snowboarders , rock_climbers and cyclists . The formula is simple : Wahoo ' s introduces fish tacos to the athletes and lets them spread the word about the food ' s taste , texture and healthful nature . Wahoo ' s menu is playing well to consumers who demand better value and more health-conscious fare . &quot; For five years we ' ve been printing the number of calories , the amount of fat and carbohydrates in our food , &quot; Lam said . &quot; We saw the handwriting on the wall early on that one. &quot; Lam doesn ' t discuss revenue or profit figures , but the average meal check falls between $ 5 and $ 6 . The Costa Mesa restaurant company has about 60 employees , most of whom work full time at the chain . * Lam earned a business degree at San Diego State in 1984 and worked for two defense_contractors before opening Wahoo ' s , but &quot; is now in his element , &quot; said Lowell Larson , Lam ' s former supervisor at Sparta Inc. , a Laguna Hills-based defense_contractor . &quot; He ' s talking to people all_the time , he ' s got a_million friends and he ' s doing what he wants to do , &quot; Larson said . &quot; And we really like Wahoo ' s stuff . On occasion , we get him to cater our corporate functions . . . . While some people are a bit hesitant at first ( to eat a fish taco ) , once they take the first bite , they ' re hooked , no pun intended. &quot; Lam and his brothers also own Our House , a coffee_shop on West 19th Street in Costa Mesa . &quot; We opened it because we wanted a place to hang_out after work , &quot; Lam quipped . &quot; Unfortunately , we didn ' t know how late we ' d be working. &quot; Wahoo ' s at a Glance * Business : Privately held restaurant_chain * Founded : 1989 , by brothers Wing Lam , Ed Lee , Mingo Lee * Original site : 1862 Placentia Ave. , Costa Mesa * Menu items : Fish and chicken_tacos , burritos , salads , sandwiches , teriyaki ribs , black_beans and rice , imported and domestic beers .
