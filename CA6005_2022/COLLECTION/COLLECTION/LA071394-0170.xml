   <TEXT> A Torrance truck_driver is in custody and the former owners of an Ontario trucking firm are_on the run after federal_agents and a drug-sniffing springer_spaniel named Fred uncovered 8 # 000 pounds of cocaine in the back of a tractor-trailer truck west of Pecos , Tex . The drug seizure culminated an eight-month undercover investigation by federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents into what DEA officials described as &quot; one of the most significant drug trafficking organizations &quot; in the Southwest . Khaled Alsawas , 43 , a Torrance-based independent trucker , could face a life sentence without possibility of parole after his arrest Thursday . But a family member said Alsawas , the father of two young children , is &quot; a hard-working family_man &quot; who &quot; never messes with drugs &quot; and did not know what he was carrying in the back of his truck . But DEA agents say he did . Meanwhile , federal arrest_warrants have been issued for owners of a trucking_company in El Paso -- Raul Orozco Sr . and his son Raul Orozco Jr . -- who federal_agents say previously operated a trucking_company in Ontario . Law_enforcement officials believe the Orozcos masterminded the planned distribution of 12 # 000 pounds of cocaine smuggled into the United States at El Paso from Mexico , including the 8 # 000 pounds allegedly found in Alsawas ' truck . Four others were also arrested in the case , including Alberto Ochoa-Soto of Colombia , said by federal_agents to be a primary connection between Colombian and Mexican drug cartels . El Paso DEA Special_Agent in_Charge Travis B . Kuykendall said Alsawas drove his truck from Los Angeles to El Paso at the Orozcos ' direction to pick_up a shipment of drugs coming_in from Mexico and transport it to New York . The drug shipment was under surveillance by federal_agents even before it was taken across the border and then put into two trucks , including Alsawas ' . The second truck , bound for Chicago with about 4 # 000 pounds of cocaine , was seized in that city , Kuykendall said . Undercover DEA agents and Texas state_troopers followed Alsawas ' 18-wheel truck east on Interstate 20 until they were sure they were not being observed by counter-surveillance teams who would warn other members of the drug trafficking ring if the truck was stopped , Kuykendall said . Agents finally stopped the truck about 200 miles east of El Paso , near Pecos , and requested a canine unit from the 17-officer Pecos Police_Department . Fred , a 5-year-old springer_spaniel , and his handler , Officer Chuck Sutlive , arrived shortly thereafter and found a 55-gallon drum containing cocaine in the back of the truck . Additional barrels of cocaine also were found among empty barrels in the truck . Alsawas was arrested and held_in the county jail in Midland , Tex. , on suspicion of possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute . Beery said that because of the amount of drugs involved , Alsawas and the other defendants in the case could face life sentences without parole . Alsawas &quot; is a victim of circumstances , &quot; said a man who answered the phone at Alsawas ' home_in Torrance and identified himself as Alsawas ' brother-in-law . &quot; I don ' t believe he knew what he was hauling. &quot;</TEXT>
