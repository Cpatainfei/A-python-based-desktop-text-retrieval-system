   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL , JORDAN MOVE CLOSER TO PEACE_TREATY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel and Jordan moved closer to signing a peace_treaty Wednesday , when Israel ' s Parliament overwhelmingly endorsed a declaration ending the state_of_war between the two nations and King Hussein flew over Israeli airspace for the first time en route home from Britain . As a trio of Israeli F-16 fighter planes escorted Hussein ' s private jet , piloted by the king , on its brief journey across Israel , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin radioed the airborne monarch , informing him of the Knesset vote . &quot; I ' m very happy indeed to learn from you of the welcome that the Washington declaration has received in the Knesset , &quot; Hussein said . &quot; To the people of Israel , we send our best wishes and our prayers for peace . Shalom. &quot; &quot; Your Majesty , I see you now . Your plane is over me , &quot; Rabin replied as the king ' s plane roared over the coastal town of Herzliya . The prime_minister was there , sitting outside an officers ' school and using an army radio . Hussein flew so low that people on the streets could see the Jordanian crown on the tail of his jet . &quot; What is your impression of Tel Aviv , Your Majesty ? &quot; the normally taciturn Rabin asked Hussein playfully . &quot; Beautiful city , &quot; Hussein replied . &quot; Your Majesty , thank_you very much . I hope that in your flight over Jerusalem you will see the tremendous development of this holy_city , &quot; Rabin said . &quot; I hope that this city will be the city of peace for the future of all_the peoples in the region. &quot; &quot; That is , indeed , our dearest hope , and we will do everything we can to achieve peace in our region , &quot; Hussein said . Moments later , he streaked across the sky above Jerusalem ' s Old City , which Hussein lost in battle to the Israelis in the 1967 Middle_East War . The conversation , broadcast live_on Israel Radio , provided an electrifying cap to a day devoted to Israeli-Jordanian peacemaking . As lawmakers spent the day debating the Washington declaration , Israeli and Jordanian negotiators worked feverishly to complete details to open a border crossing above the twin ports of Aqaba and Eilat , at the southernmost tip of each country . Israel Radio reported that crews already were tearing_down chain-link and barbed-wire fencing separating the two countries in the south . Rabin hopes to join Hussein and U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher on Monday in inaugurating the crossing . It will initially be used only by tourists carrying passports other_than Israeli or Jordanian . But Rabin expressed hope Wednesday that , soon , Israelis and Jordanians will cross the border freely . &quot; Ours is a great privilege today to be witness and partner to beautiful moments in Israel ' s history , &quot; Rabin said , as he sought the 120-seat Parliament ' s endorsement of the agreement he signed last week in Washington with Hussein . Israeli President Ezer Weizman , Supreme Court Chief_Justice Meir Shamgar and dozens of dignitaries were present for the occasion . Despite reservations expressed by some opposition members about the special status that the document recognizes for Jordan in administering Jerusalem ' s Muslim holy sites , the non-binding endorsement passed_by a 91-3 vote with two abstentions ; 24 lawmakers were not present . Rabin passionately restated his government ' s commitment to maintaining Jerusalem as Israel ' s undivided capital and insisted that the Washington declaration only recognizes Jordan ' s existing role in caring for the Temple Mount and the Muslim shrines there . &quot; This government , like all those which preceded it , believes that there are no disagreements in this chamber over the eternalness of Jerusalem as the capital_of_Israel , &quot; he said . &quot; The whole , unified Jerusalem was and will be until the end of time the capital of the Israeli people , under Israeli sovereignty , a center for the longings and dreams of every Jew. &quot; Jerusalem , Rabin said , &quot; is not to be bargained for , &quot; brushing_aside the insistence of PLO chief Yasser Arafat that talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization over the status of the city -- holy to Muslims , Jews and Christians -- should begin immediately . It was a triumphant day for Rabin , who has withstood withering criticism from the government ' s chief opposition , the nationalist Likud Party , over his dealings with the PLO and who has battled public sentiment strongly opposed to relinquishing the strategic Golan Heights to Syria . The Washington declaration offered Rabin a rare chance to appear as leader of a united country , heading confidently toward making_peace with its neighbors . &quot; The four pages placed on the Knesset ' s table today are the essence of the dream of peace between Israel and Jordan , which will become in the coming days , we all believe and hope , a full peace_treaty , &quot; he said . &quot; We no longer have a doubt in our hearts that the Arab peoples are joining us on the path to peace. &quot; No members of Likud voted against the declaration , although two abstained . &quot; In contrast to the impression that the government tries to create -- that there is among the people a camp of supporters of peace and a camp of enemies of peace -- the reality is the reverse , and we ' re proving that here today , &quot; said Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu in his Knesset speech endorsing the Washington declaration . Netanyahu said Likud still opposes the agreement between Israel and the PLO that allows the Palestinians to build a self-governing authority in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip , starting with Gaza and the West_Bank town of Jericho . He said Likud ' s differences with the government over its efforts to reach a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict remain so deep that there is no chance Likud will join Rabin ' s Labor_Party and its leftist allies to form a broad-based government , as some Israeli pundits have urged . &quot; With such deep disagreements , there is no possibility of our joining this government , &quot; Netanyahu said , addressing Rabin directly from the Knesset podium . But Netanyahu ' s party is in the grips of an internal wrangle about how best to respond to the government ' s growing success in negotiating with Arab states and the Palestinians . The Washington declaration triggered a fresh round of internal bickering in Likud , because the notion of making_peace with Jordan wins such wide support here . The agreement with the PLO was initially easy for Likud to reject -- because Likud still regards the organization as terrorist , and because the agreement may ultimately require Israel to relinquish territory in final negotiations on the future of the West_Bank and Gaza . But Likud predictions that Palestinian self-government would quickly prove unworkable and that the PLO would prove an unreliable partner have yet to come true . Israel now is engaged in intensive discussions with the PLO on expanding self-government beyond Jericho to the rest of the West_Bank . Israeli and PLO negotiators are also working_out economic projects , and the Israeli army has said it is working well with Palestinian police in maintaining security . Earlier this week , Moshe Katsav , head of Likud ' s Knesset faction , publicly urged the party to accept the agreement with the PLO and consider joining a national unity government . He was immediately denounced by party hard-liners , including former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and former Prime_Minister Yitzhak Shamir . In an interview Tuesday on Israel Radio , Sharon -- who has said he will run_for prime_minister in 1996 -- accused Likud leaders of losing their heads and said the party has lost its way . Debate continues to rage within the party about how to deal with the reality of Israel ' s neighbors , one by one , offering peace in exchange for territorial concessions . In recent days , Rabin has hinted that this may even include Syria -- the Arab state that has insisted on a full Israeli withdrawal from land captured from Syria in the 1967 war . Christopher is_due back here Saturday night on yet another round of shuttle diplomacy between Damascus and Jerusalem . Israeli newspapers are reporting that Syrian President Hafez Assad has accepted in principle the notion of a phased peace with Israel in return for a phased Israeli withdrawal from the Golan . But Assad apparently has yet to spell_out his vision of relations with Israel . The Israelis insist they will never withdraw totally from the Golan for anything less than full peace -- open borders , trade relations and restrictions on deployment of armed forces on both sides .</TEXT>
