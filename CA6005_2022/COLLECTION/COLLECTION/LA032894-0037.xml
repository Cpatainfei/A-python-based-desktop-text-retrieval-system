   <HEADLINE> LACK OF EMF TESTING PROGRAM IN SCHOOLS RAISES CONCERNS ; HEALTH : PARENT ' S REQUEST LED TO DETECTION OF HIGH LEVELS IN SHERMAN OAKS CLASSROOM . DISTRICT OFFICIALS SAY SIMILAR SITUATIONS COULD EXIST ON UP TO 100 CAMPUSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The recent discovery of high electromagnetic fields in a Sherman Oaks kindergarten classroom exposed the lack of a concerted program to detect EMF hot spots in city schools . EMF measurements were taken at Dixie Canyon Avenue Elementary School because of a parent ' s concern about the placement of an electric transformer , not_due to the vigilance of school authorities . As the episode revealed , testing for elevated EMFs usually is limited to schools with worried parents or staff . EMFs have been linked by some studies to a small increased risk of cancer . This passive approach -- which one critic called a &quot; squeaky wheel &quot; policy -- has not produced much information about EMF levels in local schools . Only nine of more_than 600 schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District have had EMF measurements , district records show . More testing is likely after the Dixie Canyon flap , which involved a transformer installed inches from the exterior wall of a bungalow classroom . After a parent voiced concern , district safety officials sought measurements by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , which obtained a high reading of 107 milligauss at the teacher ' s desk . Typical readings in homes and offices are less than 2 milligauss . Parents were particularly upset because the district installed the transformer in 1991 -- long after the EMF controversy surfaced . Jeffrey Fried , the parent who raised the issue , said he was incensed that the district &quot; put it ( the transformer ) seven inches away from the children. &quot; District officials , who have decided to relocate the transformer at a cost of about $ 100 # 000 , say similar situations could exist on up_to 100 campuses where transformers have been added since 1989 to serve portable classrooms and new air-conditioning systems . Rather than install the transformers as far as possible from classrooms , officials said they typically put them nearby to save money and space . The state_Department of Education since 1988 has required minimum setbacks from power_lines for new schools and portable classrooms , but the standard does not mention other electrical installations . Diane Doi of the district ' s environmental health and safety branch said the risk of transformers creating higher EMF exposures &quot; didn ' t register . . . . The focus with EMFs . . . was always with the power transmission lines. &quot; Electric and magnetic_fields are invisible lines_of_force that radiate outward from every electrical_device , penetrating nearly everything around them -- including the human_body . If EMFs are dangerous , distance is the best defense because their strength falls rapidly with distance from the source . Several studies have found a small increased risk of cancer in children living near high-current power_lines , and other EMF research has found elevated cancer rates among workers whose jobs bring them into close contact with electrical equipment , such_as utility linemen and film projectionists . A smaller number of studies found no connection between EMFs and cancer , and experts generally say a causal link has not been proven . Recognizing that a definitive conclusion may be years away , some authorities -- including state health officials -- have called_for voluntary adoption of no-cost and low-cost means to reduce exposures , in case EMFs are proven to be harmful . Such &quot; prudent avoidance &quot; measures , as they are sometimes called , can be as simple as fencing off part of a playground or moving workstations farther from a source of EMFs . But taking such precautions means knowing where elevated fields exist . And in Los Angeles and many other areas , this data exists for a mere handful of schools . As a free service to customers , a number of utilities , including the DWP and Southern California Edison Co. , take EMF readings in homes , offices and schools by request . Although the DWP has surveyed nearly 600 homes and offices during the past two years , it has only been asked to test nine schools . Although Edison , the nation ' s second-largest utility , has measured nearly 3 # 900 sites during the past two years , fewer than 100 have been schools , said Mark Judy , manager of Edison ' s EMF education center . * Yet many experts believe there are compelling reasons why such testing should be focused_on schools . For one thing , some schools were built near power_lines or other electric installations to take_advantage of cheaper land costs . By bringing large_numbers of children and adults together in one place , schools concentrate any risks that may exist . &quot; Schools have a special status , because they ' re public institutions to which people entrust their kids , &quot; said Dr. Raymond R . Neutra of the state_Department of Health Services , the state ' s point_man on the EMF issue . State health and education officials say a mandate to test all schools is unlikely anytime soon -- particularly because there is no consensus on what EMF levels would be cause for concern . Testing &quot; will probably continue to be_on a public response mode , instead of a blanket ' everybody must do_it , ' &quot; said Duwayne Brooks , an assistant superintendent of the state_Department of Education and member of a state task_force on EMF in schools . Although they are veterans of emotionally charged health scares involving asbestos , lead and radon , school safety officials say they are floundering for lack of standards on EMF exposure . Several testing initiatives are expected in the coming months . In response to the Dixie Canyon episode , district officials said they will review building plans to pinpoint campuses where transformers near classrooms may be causing heightened exposures . In a separate study , DWP officials are planning to take EMF measurements at 41 schools that are near transmission_lines and substations -- although the readings will be confined to school property_lines .</TEXT>
