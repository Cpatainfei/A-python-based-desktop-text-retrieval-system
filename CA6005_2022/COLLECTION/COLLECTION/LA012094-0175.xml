   <HEADLINE> EARTHWATCH : DRIVING BECOMES A NATURAL_GAS ; AVAILABILITY OF THE CLEANER , CHEAPER FUEL GROWS . REBATES AND TAX_BREAKS MAKE CONVERTING VEHICLES AFFORDABLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Operated by Southern California Gas Co. , Ventura County ' s first and only stationselling low-pollution , low-cost compressed natural_gas as fuel for cars and trucks is now open 24 hours a day in Oxnard . Although the official ribbon-cutting is scheduled for next month , Edna Ray is already a customer . Executive_director of the county ' s office of the American Lung Assn. , Ray fills_up her Dodge van , which has been converted to burn natural_gas . Ray ' s organization bought the van in November . She had been particularly eager to begin doing her bit to fight local smog by using natural_gas , which causes less than half the smog of gasoline . &quot; We ' re going to practice what we preach , &quot; she told her staff . Ray and her staff became customers at the gas_company ' s new station at Patton Court the minute it became operative this month . Interviewed last week during a swing by the site , Ray said , &quot; If I ' m in the area I always gas_up . It ' s cheaper and very easy to put in. &quot; Indeed , aside from costing her about 60 cents a gallon , gas fuel doesn ' t spill or smell_up hands like gasoline . And Ray gets the same mileage as with gasoline : 28 miles per gallon . The van is equipped with a switch that allows her to use either natural_gas or regular unleaded gasoline . She had been told to expect some sluggishness when driving on natural_gas , &quot; but there ' s no difference , &quot; she said . The distinction in price , by the way , is because the California Public_Utilities Commission mandated that whatever the oil_companies ' wholesale price of gasoline is_on any day of the year , the gas_company ' s wholesale price for an equivalent amount of natural_gas must be 26 cents less . Ray is anticipating another boon as a result of having switched to cleaner fuel . Not only does_it not fill the air with gunk , it doesn ' t coat the innards of her engine with deposits , either . She ' s been told the van might run nearly 500 # 000 miles before it needs overhauling or replacement . Until this month , an ordinary motorist couldn ' t just walk into an American car dealership in the county and order a car , light truck or van equipped to use compressed natural_gas . Some foreign manufacturers expect to begin a program of ready availability in the U . S . by the end of this year , but Detroit ' s Big Three have jumped_out ahead of the pack for once . Starting this month , you can call a local Ford , GM or Chrysler dealership and say you want the latest models -- such_as Caprice , Corsica , Ram , Voyager and Taurus -- with a factory-installed natural_gas option . In case you ' re worried that they ' re going to soak you for being environmentally friendly , be aware that you ' re entitled by law to a package of rebates and tax_breaks that can leave you paying almost nothing extra for switching to natural_gas . Ask the dealer about reducing what would otherwise be about $ 4 # 000 in extra charges to nearly zip . In addition to the gas_company station Ray uses , other facilities will be popping_up in our county and nearby for those who want to drive throughout the state without polluting it . This month , MacValley Oil Co . in Oxnard will open a natural_gas station . MacValley is affiliated with Fleet Star Inc. , a Texas firm that plans to open natural_gas stations in Taft , Fresno , Bakersfield and Stockton this year . The gas_company publishes a map showing all_the natural_gas stations between San Diego and Sacramento . Until recently they were only every 50 miles or so . In 1994 , many intervening stations are being built . Details * FYI : For information on the new , low-pollution , low-cost natural_gas stations in Ventura County , call Marcia Secord at Southern California Gas Co. , 385-4802 , or Mark Matye at MacValley Oil Co. , 485-6900 . * COST : To compare prices and availability of popular models of American-made cars , vans or trucks equipped to use this fuel , you can , as of this month , call an authorized dealer in the county . The following dealers are particularly knowledgeable_about natural_gas models : Kevin Todey Chevrolet , William L . Morris Chevrolet , Crown Dodge , Westoaks Plymouth , Harbor Plymouth or Bob Beaty Ford . Be sure to ask about the rebates and tax_breaks that can make these environmentally friendly vehicles cost no more_than an ordinary gasoline-using model .</TEXT>
