   <HEADLINE> FULL SPEED AHEAD ; AFTER SLOW YEARS , LOCAL CAR DEALERSHIPS ' SALES ARE ZOOMING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After years of recession-induced doldrums , many local car_dealers are now enjoying brisk sales , mirroring the trend nationwide and throughout California . &quot; We ' re killing them , &quot; said Rick Hanchett , general sales manager at Canoga Jeep Eagle in Canoga Park . &quot; We ' ve had record months ever since January . We can ' t keep the cars on the ground. &quot; Canoga Jeep Eagle is cashing_in_on the explosive growth in_demand for sport utility vehicles such_as Chrysler Corp. ' s Jeep Cherokee and the Ford Explorer . Hanchett said sales of the luxury Grand Cherokee models have been particularly strong . At one point , he had just one remaining Grand Cherokee on the lot , compared to the 40 to 60 he usually has in_stock . From the first of the year through mid-September , Canoga Jeep Eagle ' s unit sales jumped 21 % over the year earlier , to 783 from 649 . And gross sales zoomed 36 % , to $ 1.2 million from $ 880 # 000 in the 1993 period . Profit per car has also risen , Hanchett said , largely because of customers ' preference for luxury models and added features . Across the San Fernando Valley and surrounding areas , many other car_dealers are reporting that sales are finally picking_up after remaining stagnant or declining since the beginning of the decade . The growth can ' t come too soon for the local auto industry , which continued to suffer through 1993 as California ' s economy lagged behind the rest of the country . Nationwide , sales of domestic and Japanese vehicles were robust in the first_half of the year , and the trend is expected to continue into 1995 . Auto analysts say that sales in the United States are_on a pace to hit a booming 15.5 million units this year , up from 14 million in 1993 . The analysts say that Southern California car sales still aren ' t increasing as fast as those elsewhere in the country . But sales are gaining speed here , said Christopher Cedergren , senior_vice_president of the Santa Ana-based auto research firm AutoPacific Group Inc. &quot; There ' s a lot of pent-up demand for cars , &quot; Cedergren said . &quot; The age of the fleet in California and the country is at a record high . There ' s a lot of old cars on_the_road that need to be replaced. &quot; The good news for California dealers , he added , is that their car sales will probably continue to grow through 1997 , when the rest of the country is expected to head into another cyclical economic downturn . Granted , some of the local dealers seeing big increases have benefited from the closure of other dealerships throughout the area during the past several years . Many are also getting a boost from the upsurge in auto leasing , which is being fostered by heavy incentives offered by the manufacturers . Both factors have helped sales balloon at Galpin Ford in North Hills , one of the two largest Ford dealers in the nation , said owner H . F . ( Bert ) Boeckmann II . In the first eight months of this year , Galpin Ford sold 7 # 354 new cars and trucks , up 35 % from 5 # 440 vehicles sold in the comparable 1993 period . That helped fuel an overall sales gain of 35 % for all new and used cars , to $ 192.5 million from January through August versus $ 142.7 million a year before . Boeckmann said that his Galpin Lincoln-Mercury and Saturn dealerships have had similar increases . And while profits per car are down because of price_cutting , total profits are rising because the volume of sales is so great . &quot; When you get your volume up , that ' s where you really make your money , &quot; he said . * During the recession , when other dealerships were cutting_back , Galpin kept expanding , a factor Boeckmann now cites as a key reason for his strong sales growth . And when other dealers closed -- such_as Mission Hills Ford , which went_out of business in 1991 -- Galpin pulled_in new customers . Boeckmann also said that sales really took_off this year after the earthquake , when the pent-up demand for new cars was unleashed . July and August were record sales months at Galpin Ford , he said , and September &quot; could be our biggest month ever. &quot; that ' s due in part to customers like Tom Ordorff of Tujunga , who has decided to buy one of the fast-selling Ford Escorts for his wife , their first new car in many years . &quot; We put_off buying for a long_time , &quot; Ordorff said , but his wife ' s old car is now &quot; trashed &quot; and he wants her to have a new car for shuttling around their young daughter and 1-month-old son . Ordorff said he was also motivated by what he sees as good_deals available on new cars recently . With sales picking_up , some local car_dealers are finding themselves running_short on inventory . that ' s because manufacturers steered car allotments to the Midwest and East , where sales began rebounding sooner . &quot; My biggest problem is keeping cars in_stock , &quot; said Peter Tuohy , sales manager at Keyes European in Van Nuys , which sells Mercedes-Benzes and Volvos . Nonetheless , Tuohy said sales are up 15 % to 20 % over last year . He attributed the increase , which started about three months ago , to a rush to buy cars at the end of the 1994 model year and lower prices for the top-of-the-line S-class Mercedes . Many dealers say that manufacturers ' incentives have helped their sales , but other factors have had an impact as well . At Star Auto Group in Glendale -- which includes Ford , Chrysler-Plymouth-Jeep , Lincoln-Mercury , Saab , Acura and Isuzu dealers -- Vice_President Steve Bussjaeger said car sales are up 16 % over a year ago and truck sales have skyrocketed 44 % . Bussjaeger attributed the increases mostly to the auto group ' s move more_than a year ago to a facility three times the size of its former site , while at_the_same_time adopting a lower-pricing strategy . As at Galpin , the profit_margin on each car sold has been squeezed , but &quot; we ' re doing so_much more volume that it makes_it well worth it , &quot; Bussjaeger said . In addition to booming sales of sport utility vehicles made by Ford and Chrysler , he said , the van business is hot , including the Ford Aerostar and Windstar and Chrysler minivans . Some dealers also have high hopes for the newly redesigned Chevrolet Blazer . There are exceptions to the local surge in sales . Some dealers of Japanese-made vehicles are having a harder_time lately because the strong yen has forced up the prices of their cars , although some Japanese cars sold here aren ' t affected because they are made here . What ' s more , although Japanese car_manufacturers have been seeing overall sales increases in the United States , they are up against the toughest price and quality competition in years from resurgent Detroit automakers . Through much of the 1980s , Hondas were among the best-selling cars , but Rick Gart , sales manager at Honda of Valencia , said his sales are stagnant now , as they have been for the past few years . &quot; Right now it ' s a rough situation , because you ' re in between the old models and the new models , &quot; Gart said . Ideally , he ' d like to have all_the 1994 model cars sold by the end of the year , but he is worried that rising interest_rates could hurt that effort . Jay Gorman , executive_vice_president of the California Motor Car_Dealers Assn. , a Playa del Rey-based industry group , cautioned that , although the picture has improved for many area dealers , auto sales here will probably still lag the rest of the country for some time . &quot; I think you ' re going to see relatively stable sales &quot; through next year , he said . But in Southern California &quot; we ' ve had a devastated aerospace and defense industry . I think that ' s going_to continue to have an impact . The people we ' ve talked to don ' t see a real red-hot market. &quot;</TEXT>
