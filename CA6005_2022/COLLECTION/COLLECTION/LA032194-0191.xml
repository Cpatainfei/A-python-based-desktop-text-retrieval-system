   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : TURMOIL KEEPS MONEY OUT OF MEXICAN STOCKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thomas Herzfeld believes the time to buy_into so-called emerging stock_markets is when they ' re down , especially on political upheaval . But the Miami-based money manager still doesn ' t want to buy Mexico , despite that stock_market ' s steep plunge this year tied to the ballooning problems of Mexico ' s ruling party , the PRI . In fact , Herzfeld isn ' t enamored of any of the Latin_American markets that have tumbled since mid-February , including Chile and Argentina . &quot; I think we ' ll have a chance to buy them cheaper later , &quot; he says . &quot; There ' s nothing really compelling about them now. &quot; Adam Holiber , analyst at D.A. Campbell Co. , a Los Angeles brokerage that specializes in Latin_American stocks , says the Mexican market ' s slide in particular has &quot; all_the characteristics of a panic &quot; that hasn ' t run its course . The Mexican Stock_Exchange ' s Bolsa index , which eased 13.66 points on Friday to 2 # 363.01 , has plummeted 18 % from its all-time high of 2 # 881.17 on Feb . 8 . The market was able to overcome the initial surprise of the anti-government uprising in Mexico ' s southern Chiapas state in early January . But by mid-February , foreign investors began to focus_on the severity of the Chiapas crisis ' political fallout for the PRI and outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . The biggest aftershock from Chiapas : Manuel Camacho Solis , whom Salinas named to negotiate for the government with the rebels , is considering entering this year ' s presidential race on the ticket of one of Mexico ' s smaller political_parties . That would be a direct challenge to the supremacy of the PRI , whose handpicked candidate to succeed Salinas is 43-year-old Luis Donaldo Colosio . For foreign investors who since fall have focused only on what ' s right with Mexico -- especially the long-term economic promise born of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement -- Camacho has become a reminder that the country ' s political evolution may_not follow the PRI ' s rigid script . Mexico still is a democracy in name only , after all . &quot; They are not at all used to political fracturing or plurality in their system , &quot; says Holiber . What ' s more , the Chiapas uprising -- and the apparent kidnaping last Monday of one of the country ' s top bankers , Alfredo Harp Helu -- have revived painful discussions about how relatively little wealth generated by the country ' s economic revival has actually trickled down to the peasant masses . The stock_market ' s worst nightmare is that Camacho , if he runs , could take enough votes away from Colosio to throw the August election to a left-wing candidate . That would raise the specter of re-nationalization of industry and a rejection of the NAFTA treaty in whole or in part . If the backdrop for the PRI ' s woes was a healthy economy , the stock_market might have been able to deal better with election fears . But it didn ' t help that 1993 saw the lowest level of real economic_growth ( 0.4 % ) in Mexico in seven years , in part because of uncertainty about NAFTA ' s passage in the United States for most of the year . The economy ' s slowdown depressed Mexican corporate profits in the second_half of the year , and those lousy profit reports put added downward pressure on stock prices in late February and into this month , Holiber says . Still , in the back of many investors ' minds is that all_of this may well be transitory -- and that the odds favor Mexican stock prices being sharply higher two to three years from now , if the economy returns to the fast track . The question then is , how low should investors allow Mexican stock prices to get_in this selloff before jumping back in ? The market ' s current average price-to-earnings ratio , as calculated by the Mexican Investment Board , is about 18 based on 1993 earnings , which isn ' t exactly dirt-cheap . Assuming earnings improve this year , the 1994 P-E is lower , of course . Holiber , however , warns that first-quarter earnings , which will be reported in April and May , probably won ' t be encouraging . But that may_not be a big problem , he says , only because by now , &quot; nobody is holding_out any hope that the first-quarter numbers are going_to be good. &quot; What worries Holiber and other U.S. investors is that the Mexican market ' s decline so far has been more a function of a sudden lack of buying than a result of heavy selling . That suggests that many investors who may want to cash out of their Mexican stocks haven ' t yet been given an opportunity . The risk now is that a sudden wave of buying by bargain hunters will immediately bring an avalanche of shares onto the market from desperate sellers , sending the market into a new tailspin . &quot; Any increase in prices becomes an opportunity to sell , &quot; warns Luis Maizel , head of LM Capital Management in La Jolla , who just returned from a week in Mexico . Holiber says such a selloff would complete the panic cycle . &quot; Our feeling is that we ' re within 10 % of the bottom , &quot; he says . A 10 % decline in the Bolsa from here would drop it to about 2 # 130 , which is where it was just before NAFTA was approved by Congress in mid-November . Maizel , who says he liquidated many of his Mexican holdings immediately after the New Year ' s Day uprising in Chiapas , believes the Bolsa could fall as low as 2 # 000 in a final panic selloff . But Maizel says he intends to begin buying again around 2 # 200 . He expects the PRI ' s Colosio to win the election this summer , restoring big investors ' faith in the country ' s ability to stay_on a long-term growth path . Even so , Maizel admits that his visits with Mexican executives and officials last week revealed surprising apprehension about the future , especially in light of the Chiapas uprising and President Salinas ' decision to try and talk through a deal with the rebels . &quot; People didn ' t like the government negotiating with a guy wearing a mask and a gun , &quot; Maizel says , noting that the rebels have kept their identities secret as they have pressed for more government aid to poor peasants . While many American institutional investors have so far looked_upon the Chiapas incident as a local problem with few long-term implications for Mexico , Maizel says his trip to Mexico last week left him &quot; concerned that this is a little bit more serious than what ( foreign investors ) had been looking at. &quot; The Mexican stock_market will be closed today for a holiday that honors Benito Juarez , the symbol of Mexican liberation in the 1800s .
