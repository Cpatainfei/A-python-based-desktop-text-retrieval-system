   <HEADLINE> REPAIRS IN DOWNTOWN SUBWAY NEARLY DONE ; TRANSIT : MTA BELIEVES IT HAS CORRECTED PROBLEM OF THIN TUNNEL WALLS . BUT QUESTIONS LINGER ABOUT THE WORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 2 # 000 tons of concrete material has been pumped to repair defective subway tunnels already open_to passengers in Downtown Los Angeles , and engineering specialists say the work is nearly complete . The repairs began in March after tests verified that numerous areas of the tunnels were built with concrete walls thinner than designed , were cracked or were leaking water . &quot; With the work that ' s been under way , I think we will come_out with what we intended to purchase &quot; when the tunnels were constructed , Franklin E . White , chief_executive_officer of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , said in an interview . &quot; The bottom_line is , if we paid_for it , we want it. &quot; But questions have emerged regarding the tunnel construction and the scope of the recent tests and repairs performed for the MTA . Some areas of the tunnels were not examined for concrete thickness , records show . And water entering the tunnels near Union Station was not sampled -- although previous tests had found the area to contain the highest concentrations of corrosive , hydrogen_sulfide along the subway route . Transit officials hoped that the recent repairs would put to rest what White has called a &quot; painful chapter &quot; for the subway , which opened_to passengers in January , 1993 . The Times reported in August , 1993 , that sections of the concrete tunnels between Union Station and Pershing Square were built as thin as 4.87 inches -- compared to the minimum designed thickness of 12 inches . White appointed a panel of outside specialists in the fall of 1993 to examine the structures . The panel concluded in February that despite the deficiencies the tunnels would remain safe if the filling of voids in the concrete and other recommended repairs were performed . Over the next eight months , the nation ' s newest subway was converted into a construction site . During the late night and early morning , crews of seven men mixed thousands of bags of cement with water and other materials , then pumped it into the tunnel crowns to fill the air voids . By day , the compressors went silent , but chalky grout that streamed from the tunnel walls onto the tracks can still be seen . While the tunnel repairs were under way , other problems confronted transit officials : Sinkages occurred along Hollywood Boulevard , several miles away , damaging buildings and forcing a halt to the excavation . Citing displeasure with the project ' s construction quality , the Clinton_Administration took the extraordinary step Oct . 5 of suspending $ 1.6 billion in future funding . The funding was restored Nov . 10 after the MTA dissolved its construction subsidiary , ousted the subsidiary ' s president and made other organizational changes . Meanwhile , the FBI and the inspector_general of the U.S. Department_of_Transportation pressed their investigations of the project . &quot; The efforts we have ongoing with the subway will continue , &quot; said Lawrence H . Weintrob , deputy assistant inspector_general for auditing . People familiar_with the inquiries say investigators are examining , among other things , the construction of the tunnels , including the installation of a protective plastic liner that has failed to shield the subway Downtown from water and potentially toxic and explosive gases . The subway project ' s chief inspector has told a review panel that the liner was at times installed negligently , records show . The Times also reported in May that gas intrusions throughout the subway have forced the use of ventilation fans on hundreds of occasions . White negotiated an agreement earlier this year requiring one tunnel builder , Tutor-Saliba Corp. , to perform the repairs on 1.8 miles of the subway at no expense to taxpayers . But now , eight months after the work began , Tutor-Saliba is threatening to seek payment for some of its costs . &quot; It appears that our commitment to be a good corporate citizen has been taken_advantage of , &quot; said company President Ronald N . Tutor in a letter this month to White . Tutor criticized the MTA for forcing his company to fill air voids at scores of locations , many of which had not been identified before the work began . &quot; We feel that this has been a research project at our expense , &quot; Tutor wrote . &quot; This MUST stop ! &quot; Tutor told White he would inform him of the amount he is seeking from the MTA when the repair costs are totaled . Tutor declined in an interview to estimate how much his company has spent on the repairs . Based on the price of the grout material and typical labor costs , experts estimated that the work to date has cost up_to $ 1 million . Tutor-Saliba and a joint_venture partner built the twin tunnels between Union Station and Pershing Square and excavated the site for the Civic Center station for $ 89 million , or 45 % over the competitive bid . Some of the concrete-based grout material used for the recent repairs was pumped into large cavities between the outside of the tunnel shell and the surrounding soil . If left unfilled , engineers say , the cavities could contribute to water-intrusion problems or settlement of ground surfaces . The grout also has filled extensive air voids , of up_to 3 3 / 4 inches deep , within the crowns of the tunnels . The voids , running many feet along the tunnel , apparently have served as &quot; channels &quot; for water coursing through the structures , according to Edward J . Cording , the chief engineering specialist retained by the MTA . &quot; Anything done to control the water is going_to enhance the long-term structural capacity &quot; of the tunnels , said Cording , a professor at the University of Illinois . &quot; We ' re trying to minimize the deleterious effects of ground_water , both on the concrete lining and on its ( rods of steel ) reinforcement. &quot; The voids were supposed to have been filled with grout during construction . Other problems have arisen at the cross passages , which link the twin tunnels and house pumping and electrical equipment . The passages have cracks and have experienced water leakage . Records show that concrete grout has been pumped to fill air voids , of up_to 15 inches , found above the roofs of the cross passages . On July 5 , workers performing the repairs at a cross passage near Civic Center &quot; discovered that the roof concrete was only 5 1 / 2 inches thick , &quot; according to an inspection report . Specifications called_for the roof to be built at least 12 inches thick . The 2 # 033 tons of concrete-based grout used thus far to repair the subway is the equivalent of 104 loaded , full-sized cement trucks . That is enough grout to add a 1-inch coating to 1.1 miles of the entire 18-foot , inner diameter of the tunnels . &quot; They ' ve certainly done a lot of work_out there , &quot; Cording said . A parallel independent review undertaken for the MTA concluded early this year that the supervision of the original construction -- provided by Parsons-Dillingham , the transit agency ' s inspection management firm -- fell_short_of &quot; acceptable industry practice. &quot; Parsons-Dillingham has helped inspect the recent repairs at no cost to the MTA and has agreed to pay the $ 1.4 million cost of the outside reviews . Ultrasound tests conducted for Cording ' s panel found that along one point of the tunnel wall , 460 feet , or 9 % of the length of that tunnel , was thinner than the design-specified 12 inches of thickness , according to records . Interviews and thousands of pages of public records also show that : * The Cording panel did not test water coming_into the tunnels within 600 feet -- or the length of two football_fields -- of Union Station . It is in this area that past studies have found the highest concentrations of hydrogen_sulfide , which can eat_away concrete and its reinforcing steel . Yet officials have emphasized that the water collected for the Cording panel ' s review was not highly corrosive . &quot; The level of hydrogen_sulfide is very low , in terms of affecting the structure , &quot; John M . Hanson , an engineer and one of Cording ' s co-panelists , said in February . In response to inquiries from The Times , Cording said last week that he had been unaware that water samples were not taken from areas where the highest concentrations of hydrogen_sulfide would be expected . &quot; The intent is not to omit that first 600 feet ( of tunnels leading south from Union Station ) , as far as I ' m concerned , &quot; Cording said , adding that he still hopes to collect samples from the area . The concentrations of hydrogen_sulfide are important because the subway tunnels were designed and built with a type of concrete that is more vulnerable to corrosion than the more costly material originally envisioned by transit officials . Also eliminated from the design for cost reasons were water stops , devices intended to confine water that intrudes . Officials had altered the type of concrete and deleted the water stops based on their hope that the 1 / 8-inch-thick plastic liner would provide a barrier to both gas and water . * The Cording panel did not study the potential performance of the tunnels at a Downtown location where other engineers have said it is more vulnerable to damage from a major earthquake . In the area , about 860 feet southwest of Union Station , the tunnels pass from firm soil into water-saturated , loose ground near Spring Street . The Cording panel also did not measure with ultrasound the tunnel concrete thickness through this area . An engineering report prepared_for Los Angeles transit officials in 1984 warned of the danger posed at this location and noted that the tunnel design did not address the_matter . &quot; Some settlement of the soil is likely to occur ( and ) differential dynamic motions of soil and rock will develop during the earthquake , &quot; said the report by Lindvall , Richter &amp; Associates . John F . Hall , a professor at Caltech who specializes in earthquake engineering , said recently that he agreed with the Lindvall Richter analysis . The Cording panel , he said , should examine the tunnels ' crossing of the contrasting soils . &quot; This is something that should have been looked_at , &quot; said Hall , who reviewed the earthquake projections compiled by the Cording panel . &quot; I don ' t think there ' s any question of that. &quot; Cording said he believes the added work is unnecessary because the panel ' s consultants examined how the tunnels would perform under a range of other earthquake scenarios . &quot; There is no explicit analysis of the contact between the two ( soil ) materials , &quot; Cording said , but he added : &quot; I think they looked_at it ( the tunnel ' s overall seismic performance ) on the conservative side. &quot; One of the consultants responsible_for the recent examinations said that about 60 % of the total length of the tunnels was tested for thickness with ultrasound . Cording said his intention had been to test with ultrasound any area of the tunnels where thin concrete or other anomalies were suspected . * Officials have not decided how to address cracks observed at the connections between the tunnels and the electrical rooms . Last February , Cording and his colleagues noted the potential for danger in the event of an earthquake : &quot; Under larger ground motions , it is possible that a several-inch-thick , possibly unreinforced part of the wall formed by the cracking at the connection between the cross passage and the tunnel could separate . It is recommended that procedures for limiting such a separation or other local damage at these junctions be investigated. &quot; In an interview last month , Cording said the MTA ' s design engineers , headed by the firm of Parsons Brinckerhoff , had advised him that repairs were not necessary . But when asked more recently whether repairs are needed and if so , who would pay_for them , Cording said : &quot; I ' m not ready to really discuss that . I think it ' s really a separate item as_to whether ( Tutor-Saliba ) does that , or whether ( the MTA ) pays_for that , or whether it ' s not done. &quot; Tutor , when asked about the_matter , said Friday : &quot; We ' re not doing any more work. &quot; Repairing the Subway Numerous areas of the Downtown Los Angeles subway between Union Station and Pershing Square were built with concrete thinner than the design called_for . Also , extensive air voids in the crowns of the tunnels have acted_as channels for ground_water that has penetrated the structures . After the problems with the thin concrete were disclosed in The Times last year , repairs were ordered . Here is a look_at how the work has been done . 1 ) Tests showed that much of the concrete is thinner than the specified 18 inches in the crown and 12 inches in the walls . 2 ) To fill the gaps in the crown , grout was pumped through hoses and steel tubes from inside the tunnel . 3 ) Cavities were also found between the outside of the tunnel and the surrounding soil . They have been filled from within the tunnels , using longer pipes to pump the grout . More_than 2 # 000 tons of grout has been used in the repairs .
