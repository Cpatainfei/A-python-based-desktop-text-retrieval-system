   <HEADLINE> ABRASIVE STYLE CITED AS ENVOY TO PARAGUAY IS CALLED HOME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The State_Department , in a highly unusual move , has quietly yanked career Foreign Service officer Jon David Glassman from his job as ambassador to Paraguay only a_few months before his three-year tour was to have been completed . Glassman , a national security aide to former Vice_President Dan Quayle , was summarily bounced by Assistant Secretary_of_State Alexander F . Watson and principal deputy Michael Skol around mid-February and was given until April 30 to leave Asuncion . Administration officials insist that the move had nothing to do with Glassman ' s identification with Quayle or his authorship of a controversial &quot; white_paper &quot; that the Ronald Reagan_Administration used to &quot; prove &quot; that the Salvadoran rebels were Cuban and Soviet puppets . Officials said that the problem was mostly one of style . The hard-charging Glassman had been U.S. charge d ' affaires to Afghanistan and closed the U.S. Embassy there in 1989 . He was sent to Paraguay by President George_Bush . Word is that he was too undiplomatic in leaning_on the Paraguayan government to crack_down on drug smugglers and money launderers . He had simply stepped_on too many toes too often . Sources said the Paraguayan government had twice sent senior officials to Washington in recent months to complain and press for Glassman ' s removal . &quot; We simply lost confidence in his reporting &quot; on the situation in Paraguay , an Administration source said , adding that Glassman ' s departure &quot; has been a long_time coming. &quot; Bush_Administration officials also had been unhappy with his performance but took no action before the Clinton_Administration came_in , that source said . While style may have had much to do with the decision , there appears to have been a substantive dispute as well between Glassman and the State_Department . Glassman reportedly pushed to have the newly elected Paraguayan government branded as noncooperative with U.S. antinarcotic efforts in the South_American_country . Other agencies working in Asuncion agreed with that assessment , a source said . But officials here disagreed and kept Paraguay on State ' s &quot; good_guys &quot; list of nations this year . Glassman is awaiting his next assignment , which will be working in Washington at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces at Ft . McNair , described by one source as &quot; truly Siberia. &quot;</TEXT>
