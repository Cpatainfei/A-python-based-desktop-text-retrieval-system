   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : WEAKENING U.S. DOLLAR STILL FINDS STRENGTH IN CANADA ; CURRENCY : THE GREENBACK IS BUYING MORE IN THE 13 PROVINCES . AND HOTELS OFFER TAX REFUNDS ON THE SPOT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Let us all now say a small prayer of thanks for Canada and its currency . While the U.S. dollar crumbles against the Japanese yen in global currency markets , our money is buying steadily more in Canada . The trend is strong -- in May , the U.S. dollar reached its strongest level in seven years against its Canadian counterpart -- and experts say it ' s likely to last at least through this year . Still , if you ' re like many Americans , you don ' t have a clear sense of how far one of our dollars goes when it ' s renting a room in Vancouver or buying dinner in Toronto . The answer is that right now those dollars can go_far indeed -- not only because of exchange_rates , but also because of the generally reasonable prices of hotels and restaurants in Canada ' s leading cities , and Canada ' s often-overlooked system of tax refunds for foreigners . Exchange_rates . For about the last three months , the Canadian_dollar has been buying about 72 American cents in currency markets . that ' s down four cents from the beginning of the year , six cents from a year ago , 11 cents since 1989 . Citing the independence movement in Quebec and Canada ' s high public_debt , some analysts say the Canadian_dollar is likely to continue weakening and may soon match its all-time low against the U.S. dollar when it was worth 69.2 cents in February , 1986 . This doesn ' t mean that the current trend in exchange_rates will inevitably save American tourists money . Tourists in Canada who buy goods that have come from the United States ( clothes from a Canadian outlet of The Gap , for example ) will find the economic machinery working against them . It ' s better , when in Canada , to buy Canadian . Food and shelter . By one widely used measure , upscale travelers ' costs in three of Canada ' s most-visited destinations , Toronto , Montreal and Vancouver , run at least $ 40 a day less than they do_in Los Angeles or San Francisco , and about $ 180 a day less than in New York . The figures come from the U.S. and Canada offices of business travel consultants Runzheimer International , which calculates per diem rates for business_travelers . ( Budget travelers , do not be alarmed at the numbers that are about to follow . To get its figures , Runzheimer surveys advertised prices at top-notch hotels and restaurants near a city ' s business center -- the most expensive places in town , basically . But even if you ' re staying somewhere far cheaper , the prices are indicators. ) In figures gathered since last October , Runzheimer sets its Los Angeles figure at $ 202.65 for a day ' s first-class lodgings and meals . Its San Francisco figure : $ 192.15. New York : $ 338.05. Meanwhile , in Montreal , Runzheimer ' s most recent per diem rate -- calculated last August , before rates got_even better for Americans -- was $ 141.65 in U.S. dollars ( $ 104 for lodging , $ 37.65 for meals ) . In Toronto , the rate was $ 140.10 ( $ 105.50 for lodging , $ 34.60 for meals ) . For a broader view of lodging_in that city , consider the 1993 hotel survey cited by the Toronto Convention &amp; Visitors Assn. , which found an average advertised price per room-night of $ 86.81 in Canadian_dollars -- in the neighborhood of $ 65 U.S. In Vancouver , where prices can vary widely by season , the per diem estimates were $ 147.80 ( $ 115 for lodging , $ 32.80 for meals ) for the months from May through September , and $ 123.30 ( $ 90.50 for lodging , $ 32.80 for meals ) for the months from October through April . Most leisure travelers spend substantially less ; when the Greater Vancouver Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau surveyed more_than 10 # 000 visitors last year , they reported an average of $ 85 per day in total expenses . Tax refunds . Like the value-added_taxes found throughout Europe , Canada ' s Goods and Services Tax ( also known as the GST and currently set at 7 % ) is added_to most goods ( excluding meals , beverages , tobacco , rental cars , gasoline , airline and train_tickets , and some artworks and jewelry ) and is generally refundable to foreign tourists who collect receipts , fill_out a form and mail them in . But unlike many value-added_taxes elsewhere in the world , Canada ' s GST levies on hotel_rooms are easily refundable to individual travelers . If an American traveler has sales receipts for more_than $ 100 Canadian in total spending , he or she can get a refund claim_form from a store , hotel or any border crossing . The traveler fills_out the form and can either seek a refund immediately ( in Canadian currency ) from a Canadian Duty Free Shop , or mail the form and receipts in within a year of the purchases and receive by mail ( an estimated 6-8 weeks later ) a check_in U.S. currency . Spend three nights in a $ 100 hotel_room and you have at least $ 21 coming_to you . For more information on GST refunds , call ( 613 ) 991-3346 from the United States , ( 800 ) 668-4748 from Canada . ( The provinces of Quebec and Manitoba also offer sales tax refunds for purchases totaling more_than $ 100. )</TEXT>
