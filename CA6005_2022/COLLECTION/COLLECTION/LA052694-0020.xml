   <HEADLINE> CENTERPIECE : SENT REELING ; VENTURA DANGLED THE BAIT , A PRIME SPOT FOR A RESTAURANT ON THE REMODELED PIER . ONLY FOUR OUT OF 80 ENTERED BIDS . WHY THE LACK OF INTEREST ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Anyone who ever loved to cook and to dine well has had the fantasy of opening a restaurant . Anyone who has explored the possibility has learned that to do so requires much money , 80-hour-a-week dedication and the high risk of failure , closure , even bankruptcy . Still , restaurants are held_dear by many , and news of openings or closings always makes_for hot discussion . Venturans have been eagerly awaiting the announcement by city officials of who will open a restaurant at one of the prime dining locations in the West : the newly restored Ventura Pier . Much would be at stake , however , in the selection of such a restaurant . Ventura ' s newest restaurant would not only serve food but act_as an important nexus : for residents , overnight tourists , day-tripping beach-goers , business people , the L.A.-to-Santa Barbara weekend crowd . Depending_on how attractive it is in food and setting , the new restaurant would either help or hinder in shoring_up businesses in an aging downtown split from its beaches by a roaring highway . And it would either please or distress residents who chronically complain that there just aren ' t enough good restaurants in Ventura County . From the start , over a year ago , it seemed Ventura would be in the catbird ' s seat -- able to choose carefully from a clamorous crowd of eager , proven entrepreneurs . The site always promised that . It ' s a 6 # 000-square-foot rectangle of space on the Ventura Pier -- the only free-standing beachfront property available in Ventura for a restaurant . And waterfront dining has held the imagination of developers and diners for decades around America ' s perimeter . Something about salt air , the peacefulness of water and island views , the belief that fish on the plate was pulled that day from a stone ' s throw_away , the postcard quality of brightly colored sailboats -- it all lends a special dimension to the dining experience . Coastal communities everywhere have always managed , on beaches or docks or piers or stilts or barges , to erect popular , profitable fish houses of some kind : Backwater crawfish shacks dot Louisiana ' s bayou ; dining gardens with palm_trees line the gulf beaches of the Florida Keys ; Southstreet Seaport in New York transforms a west_bank of the East_River into a multitiered dining fantasy ; Baltimore Harbor virtually sinks beneath the weight of Chesapeake Bay crab emporiums ; Fisherman ' s Wharf in San Francisco is where tourists go first to line_up for steamers , and Southern California ' s coastline is a happy hodgepodge of sea-view restaurants ranging from nautical kitsch to strictly uptown . But not in Ventura . Over the last year , things have proved difficult . Not everybody , it turns_out , wants to open a restaurant on the pier , despite the pier ' s meticulous restoration only a year ago at a cost of $ 3.5 million . Despite unobstructed views to the Channel Islands . Despite a potential monopoly market on a beach-going crowd estimated at more_than 1.5 million a year . This week , city officials are scheduled to close negotiations with a Seattle developer , Hal Griffith , who runs a chain of nautically themed restaurants called The Fisherman ' s Galley , two of them on piers in San Clemente and Newport Beach ( see accompanying restaurant review ) . Griffith ' s was one of only four proposals submitted after Ventura ' s invitation to more_than 80 parties to consider the pier . That lackluster response prompts some to wonder whether Ventura could have done better , could have thrown a larger net for candidates , could have marketed its prized site more successfully . &quot; We ' re frustrated , &quot; says Councilman Greg Carson . &quot; I expected more proposals . We were hoping that word_of_mouth would go_out , that more people would be aware of it . It ' s a special site . Where else can you do something like that ? &quot; Bill Byerts , the city administrator who oversees the selection , sighs deeply and blames the economy . &quot; Why no fever of competition ? It ' s real simple : They can ' t get loans . They can ' t get the money to do it. &quot; Fisherman ' s Galley may well win the site , and that would please members of a selection committee from Ventura who dined at the San Clemente Fisherman ' s Galley and were happy with the experience . Ventura Councilman Gary Tuttle was among the dining delegates and said , &quot; I really liked it . It ' s just what I had_in_mind for the pier. &quot; But Griffith ' s negotiations with the city -- over whether the city will bear part or all_of the cost of constructing a restaurant shell on the pier , as well as the terms of a lease -- are anything but certain in the outcome , and the result could be a whole new search for a whole new restaurant . Whatever the outcome , key questions remain as_to why Ventura has been unable to attract a large_number of restaurant candidates for its much-loved historic pier . And the questions inevitably invoke broader factors that affect restaurant performance : tourism , the level of spending in Ventura restaurants , and the ability of residents and visitors to freely move from downtown shops to the beach and the pier . All factors help determine the success or failure of a restaurant . Yet all are problems only recently receiving sustained attention in Ventura . On the Lower End Fred Duckett of Palo Alto is among the restaurateurs who chose not to submit a proposal for the Ventura Pier . Duckett runs the highly successful and well-reviewed Fishmarket Restaurants in Northern California and Arizona , and he knows these parts well from his swordfishing days out of Channel Islands Harbor . &quot; The pier is a fair location , &quot; he says matter-of-factly . &quot; I looked_at the ( city ' s ) proposal briefly . But we do excellent locations only , and look closely at per-capita spending . Ventura is a lower-end market , say , than Santa Barbara , and it strikes me as more transient . Then , there was a short deadline for sealed bids , and , well , we just don ' t do business that way. &quot; Malcolm Strand runs the respected Scott ' s Seafood restaurants in San Francisco , San Jose and Sacramento . He echoed the comments of Duckett and numerous other restaurateurs who received invitations but turned the other way . &quot; There ' s just not enough going_on in that market , &quot; Strand says . &quot; I spoke_to a friend who lives there to check it out , and I can tell by having visited , as well -- there ' s no action . And I would have to add that , upon investigation , it turns_out to be a fairly low-end market. &quot; Low end . If Ventura incomes are lower than Santa Barbara ' s , does that still mean that a fine restaurant can ' t do_well in Ventura ? Rosarito Beach Cafe and The Chart House , to name just two that are quite respectable in their food and not exactly low in their pricing , prove the opposite to be true . So what else thwarted the search ? The document that was sent to Duckett , Strand and more_than 80 others is called a Request for Proposals ( RFP ) . It went_through three drafts in an effort to make the pier site more enticing . Still , Ventura ' s RFP for the pier restaurant was a demanding document that presumed much about Ventura ' s restaurant marketplace and the considerable burdens any new pier restaurateur might bear . It stated that Ventura wanted &quot; a new upscale premier restaurant facility &quot; from a developer who &quot; would be responsible_for the construction of the restaurant shell and all tenant improvements &quot; on the pier . The successful candidate , it went_on , would install &quot; public art at a minimum of 2 % of the project cost &quot; and &quot; provide concession management and operation services for ( a ) snack_bar and bait shop. &quot; Launching a restaurant these days is tough enough . But after investing heavily in such construction , the pier restaurateur would not own anything ; instead , he or she would have a 10-year lease from the city to rent the space , open_to renewal by renegotiation only . Even the four who did submit proposals ignored the city ' s demands . Each sought partnership of some kind -- a sharing of the burden . &quot; Were we too restrictive ? We were , at first , &quot; says Councilman Carson . &quot; But all those who did propose had creative solutions , and all had ( the city ) involved in building the shell. &quot; Carson pauses a moment . &quot; This has been a learning experience . We didn ' t know what was out there . If we wind_up doing_it all_over again , do we make_it clear that ( the city ) would build the restaurant shell ? We need to consider these things carefully , because we ' re not in the ( restaurant ) business. &quot; ( The 10-year-lease clause is the least flexible of the city ' s demands , however -- it is stipulated by the Ventura City Charter. ) Shaky Assumptions Knowing &quot; what ' s out there , &quot; as Carson put it , is a key point in two respects . First , the field of potential candidates was delimited by the city of Ventura ' s grasp of the restaurant world . For the most part , it invited only those whom it knew or considered , based on regional reputation , to be worthy -- brief advertisements in the Los Angeles Times business section notwithstanding . Second , many of the assumptions and expectations brought_to the search by Ventura officials are rooted in a 1989 restaurant feasibility study that cited pent-up demand for waterfront dining and rosily projected annual growth in Ventura restaurant spending through 1994 . Indeed , the RFP itself cites the study , by Williams-Kuebelbeck and Associates , as showing &quot; sufficient demand for a dinner restaurant in this trade area to support approximately 10 # 000 square_feet of additional restaurant space. &quot; But the opposite has happened : Restaurants in both Ventura and Channel Islands Harbors have had difficulty in recent years -- some have closed and vacancies remain -- and per-capita restaurant spending throughout the city of Ventura , state tax files show , declined more_than 8 % by 1992 . Byerts says he drew_up the RFP invitation list with help from the city ' s redevelopment staff , which &quot; targeted , by looking through trade journals , those companies that had strategies into which a pier restaurant might fit. &quot; These firms , such_as Duckett ' s and Stroud ' s , are joined by numerous Ventura and Oxnard individuals who had simply expressed an interest -- people such_as Ed Warren , original owner of The Busy Bee cafe and current owner of Smokey ' s Saloon , both in Ventura . But firms such_as the Maryland-based Rouse Corp. , creator of both Baltimore Harbor and New York ' s South Street Seaport and respected worldwide as perhaps the leading developer of waterfront dining , went uninvited . Rouse also has done_work on a much smaller scale in California , such_as the inventive and extremely popular food court at Santa Monica ' s 3rd Street Mall . Asked why such contenders were not contacted , Byerts replied : &quot; I really couldn ' t answer you . It has to do with no one really knowing a lot of the big firms . We figured the ad in the L.A. Times would hit that. &quot; The optimistic 1989 study predicted that &quot; additional demand for dinner restaurants in Ventura will be generated by new residents. &quot; But in 1989 , at the time the study was written , 259 permits were issued to Ventura dining establishments for an annual gross sales of $ 98.6 million . Three years later , in 1992 , the last full year for which figures are available from the state Board of Equalization , 260 permits were issued for an annual gross sale of $ 100.4 million -- growth so marginal that , once Ventura ' s 2.5 % population increase is taken_into_account , it actually represents an 8.4 % decline in per-capita restaurant spending . First-quarter figures for 1993 , the latest quarterly figures reported , look even bleaker : The number of restaurant permits in Ventura had slipped to 257 . To put the best face on it , Ventura restaurants -- some closing , but others opening and doing so well as_to displace the losses of others -- had proudly held their own through a tough recession . But Ventura plainly showed no growth in its restaurant economy in the three years following the 1989 study -- contrasted with increases of 10.7 % in Simi Valley and 4.1 % in Thousand Oaks . Clearly , the concept of pent-up demand for waterfront dining remains just that : an appealing concept . The 1989 study , finally , argued that any new pier restaurant would generate 60 % of its trade from tourists or visitors -- a figure that runs counter to current experience at some of Ventura ' s high-end , near-the-beach establishments . The Chart House , which offers ocean views from its perch on a bluff on Sanjon Road , has a clientele that is roughly 35 % tourists , says Brian Brennan , the restaurant ' s manager . It is worth noting that The Chart House , for all its popularity and consistent quality , is open for dinner only , never for lunch or brunch -- that ' s simply what the Ventura market will bear . &quot; It ' s pretty local , &quot; says Brennan . &quot; I spend all Friday and Saturday nights walking_around kissing babies and shaking hands with the locals . It ' s just good business. &quot; An RFP was sent to Brennan , but The Chart House declined to bid for the pier site . &quot; The numbers weren ' t there for us , &quot; says Brennan , who also serves as vice_president of the Ventura Chamber_of_Commerce and chairs its subcommittee on tourism . &quot; We just didn ' t see the number of people we ' d need walking by. &quot; &quot; It ' s a beautiful spot , &quot; he continued . &quot; I ' ve had people in the industry call me about it , and I ' ve encouraged them , but the numbers weren ' t there for them , either. &quot; Not Yet a ' Destination ' Tourism is always invoked in arguments about the vitality of Ventura ' s restaurant economy . But the methods of calculating the numbers and types of tourists are uncertain . Ventura reports that it had 1 # 531 , 817 day visitors in 1992 . To arrive_at that figure , however , it uses a state-recommended &quot; multiplier &quot; of 2.17 , which is multiplied by the number of overnight leisure visitors as reported by Ventura hotels and motels . The multiplier , created by state planners who did not focus_on beachfront concentrations exclusively , is used in beachless Fresno and off-the-beaten-track Indio . So Ventura , loved for its beaches bisected by the busy 101 , very likely has more day-trippers that it knows or reports , concedes Debbie Solomon of the city ' s public information staff . that ' s the good news . The less-than-happy news is that Ventura may_not be the tourist destination it believes itself to be . Destination implies staying overnight , at times for many nights on a vacation , and that ' s where things get sketchy . Devlin Raley , an advertising executive of the firm Creative Images , is chairing the city ' s newly formed Tourism and Special Events Committee , which will seek to coordinate efforts among the city , the Visitors and Convention Bureau , the state-affiliated Ventura Fairgrounds and Ventura Harbor . Raley is a rampant , unabashed Ventura booster . But his gift is holding a hard , clear eye on realities : &quot; Our overwhelming majority of overnight visitors ( 91.8 % ) are staying only a day or two , and we need to increase that to three or four . We have problems getting people around -- from the harbor to the beach to downtown to Surfers Point . We also have parking problems -- if you come here , where do you go ? We ' re just not focused_on what tourism really is to us . We have work to do . &quot; What are we selling anyway ? Until we define ourselves to the regional market , we just won ' t be happening . Let ' s stop saying we ' re a destination resort until we become one. &quot; Predictably , Raley has a sense of the Ventura Pier ' s role in all this : &quot; It will help close that loop with downtown , which is revitalizing . Putting an appropriate restaurant there is key . If it ' s too upscale , we ' ll be defeating the personality of that pier and reduce usage of it by local residents . And the truth is , our business_community must survive 12 months of the year , and tourism is really only four months of it. &quot; Retro Rejected One of the three unsuccessful restaurant proposals came from the popular retro 1940s chain Ruby ' s . Doug Cavanaugh , who represents Ruby ' s , is disappointed . &quot; We ' ve wanted to be in Ventura a long_time , &quot; he says . &quot; It fits our profile : younger families and retirees . It ' s us . &quot; And I do feel that people who are walking to a pier are not dressed_up and already have chosen not to make a big deal over dining . History shows that more upscale places in this setting are less successful than the casual , and I believe history will prove us right. &quot; Hal Griffith , who declined to be interviewed while in negotiations with the city , did say his firm is considering reducing the ambition and price of its entrees at its Newport Beach restaurant . The Fisherman ' s Galley is at the far end of the pier , requiring diners to make the long seaward walk . That , Griffith said , tends to attract an even more casual crowd . Downscaling the menu to fish and chips is being considered . He said he didn ' t feel that that would be the case in Ventura , which would want the more upscale menu ( see pricing in accompanying article ) . The two others who were passed_over have different views of the city ' s approach to finding a restaurant . Larry Janss of the Janss Development Corp. , a former partner in the old Pier Fish House at the pier , pitched a seafood restaurant with entrees from $ 12 to $ 19 and an on-site micro-brewery as a special draw , particularly for the slower midweek crowd . But he concedes : &quot; The whole problem of traffic and demography was making me a bit nervous , and my last years at the pier , with gangs and a shooting , had caused me some concern . So I was not in deep despair when I wasn ' t selected. &quot; Jana Johnson , however , a broker representing the Reel Inn chain , is perplexed with the city ' s handling of applicants . Johnson said that Reel , whose nearest restaurant overlooks the water in Malibu , took the proposal quite seriously , submitted a 55-page document that included a conceptual site plan and architect ' s rendering , and considered itself a perfect solution for Ventura in that it offered both inexpensive , casual dining as well as pricey , ambitious dining for those who wished a special night out . But the city never responded , says Johnson , not even to say that Reel had lost out . &quot; My client read it in the paper , &quot; says Johnson . &quot; that ' s a slap in the face . The city ' s not taking the time to interview us -- that surprised us . But no notification ? I would have to hesitate and think whether I ' d want to put a client through that process again. &quot; Byerts rejects Johnson ' s claims outright . &quot; that ' s just not accurate , &quot; he says . &quot; We sent notification of whom we selected. &quot; But news of Griffith ' s selection may have been publicly discussed by a councilman before notices were received , he acknowledged . Facing Financial Burden Whoever gets the pier site faces tremendous upfront costs . Byerts estimates that it would take $ 1.5 million to $ 2 million to build , furnish , staff and open a restaurant at the pier . Then it would take as much -- $ 1.5 million a year -- in gross receipts to pay the bills , with profitability a good two years of operation away . ( Note : The Pier Fish House , less than half the size of any proposed new restaurant , showed gross annual revenues in its final years of operation of about $ 750 # 000. ) Who will take_on such costs -- particularly when the market continues to lack definition , though restaurateurs do report gains in business in recent months -- remains unclear . Also unclear is how far the city of Ventura will go toward building a shell , improving the empty lot between the pier and the Holiday Inn parking garage , and launching a people-moving transportation_system , such_as a trolley , that links downtown and Ventura ' s multiple waterfronts . Hal Griffith of Seattle may know . He has built_on many_a pier , sold many_a plate of fish . But if for some reason he wriggles off_the_hook , Ventura will to have to cast_about all_over again -- and this time with new soundings , new bait .</TEXT>
