   <HEADLINE> UCI MEDICAL_CENTER TO TAKE_PART IN BREAST_CANCER STUDY ; HEALTH : AT LEAST 50 LOCAL SURVIVORS OF THE DISEASE WILL BE RECRUITED FOR A NATIONWIDE INQUIRY INTO WHETHER A LOW-FAT DIET CAN PREVENT RECURRENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> UCI Medical_Center next week will recruit survivors of breast_cancer to take_part in a nationwide study to determine if eating less fat will reduce recurrence of the disease . UCI is one of 20 medical_centers throughout the United States participating in the study , which will follow about 2 # 000 women , ages 48 to 78 , who have had surgery and chemotherapy for breast_cancer . Dr. John Butler , chief of surgical oncology at UCI Medical_Center in Orange , said that at least 50 volunteers will be needed locally for UCI ' s portion of the study . &quot; I think it is a very important study ( because ) there is a lot of epidemiological and experimental information that suggests that decreasing fat intake will have a beneficial effect , &quot; Butler said . Without dietary change , breast_cancer recurs in about 30 % of cases , with the relapse rate lower for those who receive initial treatment at an earlier stage of the disease . &quot; The majority of women who have a recurrence of cancer will die of the disease , &quot; Butler said . Dr. Ernst Wynder , a research physician at the American Health Foundation in New York City , is leading the nationwide study funded by the National Cancer Institute . Women who participate will be randomly assigned to a control group whose fat intake will be limited to 30 % of their total daily calories or to a test group whose diet will be restricted to 15 % fat . Wynder said that 15 % was selected as an optimum level of dietary fat because it approximates the diet of women in China , where the occurrence of breast_cancer among post-menopausal women is about one-eighth as frequent as among American women . The American Cancer Society estimates that more_than 1 # 700 new cases of breast_cancer will occur this year in Orange County . Even the women in the control group will have a healthier diet than the average American , whose diet is typically 37 % fat , said Cynthia Smith , a nutritionist who will work with study participants . The women eating the lowest-fat diet will be closely monitored and receive coaching in how to grocery shop , prepare meals and order from restaurant menus . They will also meet in support groups . &quot; Nobody can just drop to a 15 % fat diet . It takes a lot of effort , &quot; Smith said , adding that the low-fat_diet will include an abundance of fruit , vegetables , bread and cereals and less red meat . &quot; Today , especially in Southern California , there are many new fat-free and reduced-fat products in the grocery_store , including cookies , ice_cream and yogurt . So ( study participants ) won ' t be totally deprived of sweet things , &quot; she said . Participants will be expected to stick_to their diets for a minimum of three years and perhaps as long as 10 years , since that is the period in which breast_cancer tends to recur . Butler said it will take_five to 10 years before the success of the low-fat_diet can be determined . He predicted that even if fat reduction does not prove effective in preventing cancer , it will enhance the overall health of study participants .</TEXT>
