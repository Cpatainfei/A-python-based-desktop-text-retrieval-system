   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN KIDNAPING ENDS WITH ALL HOSTAGES FREED UNHARMED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 24-hour hostage drama in a wild , mountainous region of southern Russia ended Friday with commandos freeing four captives unharmed and recovering millions of dollars in ransom_money . Three of the kidnapers were arrested , and the fourth died in a shootout , authorities said . It was the second high-stakes kidnaping in the area in five months , highlighting the crime_wave that is sweeping Russia . The kidnapers , granted the helicopter they demanded along with a three-man military crew , took_off Friday morning from the resort city of Mineralniye Vody with four hostages . Army helicopters carrying anti-terrorist squads were close behind , said Maj . Viktor Gusakov , an Interior Ministry spokesman in the city . About three hours later , the kidnapers landed near the village of Bacha-Yurt in Chechnya , a breakaway Russian province known for its fierce warrior culture and ruthless criminal gangs . Three of the kidnapers were captured almost immediately , said Alexander Kalmykov , a police official in Mineralniye Vody . The fourth gunman tried to flee into the nearby woods and was killed in a shootout , he said . At least three of the gunmen were identified as residents of Chechnya . There were conflicting reports about the size of the ransom paid , ranging from $ 4 million to $ 10 million . In Chechnya , Interior Minister Apti Barsnukayev told the Interfax news_agency the ransom was recovered in full , but there were unconfirmed reports that the kidnapers had burned some of the money . And hundreds of thousands of dollars disappeared after the kidnapers tossed handfuls of bills out of the helicopter . The kidnaping began Thursday near Mineralniye Vody , a resort 800 miles south of Moscow . Four men armed with guns and a grenade seized a bus loaded with schoolchildren , teachers and parents . Leaving the driver and most of the male passengers behind , they headed for the airport with 29 hostages , including eight children . With police surrounding the bus , the gunmen threatened to decapitate the children , then demanded weapons and narcotics . The gunmen later traded the children and one adult for four assault_rifles , ammunition , flak jackets , night-vision devices and 100 vials of morphine , Gusakov said . Early Friday , they freed all but four hostages in exchange for cash , the Mi-8 helicopter and three more automatic_rifles . The kidnaping was similar to one in December , in which four gunmen swapped a dozen schoolchildren for $ 10 million and a helicopter . Those kidnapers took_off from Mineralniye Vody , but the helicopter ' s engine stalled and they had to make a forced landing in the mountains , where they were captured . None of the hostages was injured .</TEXT>
