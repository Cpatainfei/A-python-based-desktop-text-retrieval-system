   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON TURKEY ; NO LONGINGS FOR OTTOMAN EMPIRE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Question : Are you going_to the NATO summit with a feeling that there is a rising danger from Russia ? Answer : There is change going_on in Russia ; a reactionary movement in the former Soviet_Union . It probably stems from the economic_conditions as well as the political situation . Despite what President Yeltsin may have_in_mind , a theme has come_to the surface now , not exactly going_back to the old borders ( but ) definitely a nationalistic attitude vis-a-vis the rest of the independent countries . I think Russia is more inclined to put pressure on them , trying to sign bilateral military agreements with them . The will is there . . . to make Russia the sole protector of that region against the rest of the world , especially against Europe . Turkey wants to coexist and cooperate with Russia . When I was there and saw President Yeltsin , the sole theme was that we have cultural affiliations with some of these countries that have become independent ( the mostly Turkic-speaking states of Azerbaijan , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan ) . We realize that they are going_to have a relationship with Russia as well . Why not form a triangle ? Instead of competition , let ' s cooperate . As far as Turkey is concerned , it has extended close to $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion credit to this region , including Armenia . This shows the commitment we have to stability in that part of the world . We have no inclinations for the old Ottoman Empire . We ' ve been over this for years . Q : You can say you will never have a military commitment in the region even if the Armenians go_to Baku ? A : No , I never said that . We always are watching very closely . Only yesterday we had a summit about this , considering and reconsidering . As far as Turkey is concerned , we all feel that Armenia should withdraw . In Bosnia , we also stood_up . I am going there sometime in the future to draw the attention of the world one more time that this is simply a massacre . It ' s against human_rights . It ' s a moral issue . We were there in Somalia when aggression took_place . Of course , in Azerbaijan when the Armenian aggression takes_place at our border we are even more concerned . Q : Do you think the West is being too accommodating toward Russian policies for the newly independent republics of the former Soviet_Union ? Will you be raising your fears of Russian expansionism at the NATO summit ? A : Yes , of course , for a general evaluation . There are lot of crises taking_place in all parts of the world and especially in this part of the world . There is no organization that tackles these crises any more . We are just talking_about ( standing_up for ) values against aggression , values for human_rights . What is a more important as a human_right than the right to live ? I think we need to evaluate what we are doing not just for the day , but for the short term , medium term and long term . We need to look_at history . The United States especially should just come and take_a_look at this part of the world . I am afraid that ( Western ) interests in the Middle_East , the independent countries that have separated from the Soviet_Union will not only be in danger but stability will be threatened . I feel that ( President Clinton ' s proposed &quot; partnership for peace &quot; with the former Soviet bloc ) is a realistic kind of attitude . We should be looking not for the separation of Europe , but for the unification of Europe . Maybe it ' s even too gradual as far as we are concerned . Maybe we should move a little faster than that . The least that I expect ( to see ) is the principles set , adopted and agreed upon . We need to recognize what Europe is . It is not a separation of cultures . It ' s a kind of understanding of the bringing in of different cultures . Q : Do you think the 9-year-old rebellion by the separatist Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) guerrillas in Turkey ' s southeast is only a military problem ? Could you comment on the recent disturbances involving Turks and Kurds in Europe ? A : I think it ' s about time to take this issue up . If we are going_to share the same values , such_as democracy , protection of human_rights or the fight against terror , we have to stand together on all those issues . We should not mix_up the issue of the PKK with the Kurds living_in Turkey and elsewhere in the world . About 2 # 000 people have been killed in Turkey in the last year . The vast majority of them were Kurds killed by the PKK . We are trying to protect our citizens no matter what ( ethnic ) root they are from . Babies are being massacred . I was in ( Southeast Turkey ) on New Year ' s Day . I spent it with the people there . On the streets , on the balconies , in the houses ; they were no different toward me than in any other city I have been to . There was a lot of love , a lot of relaxation there . People are frightened by the PKK . What they want is that the state protects their lives . They want employment . Democratization is something we believe_in . We are going_to take giant steps_in that . Not as a concession to the PKK . Not for that region only . But for the whole country . We have come a long way in democracy since the 1940s . And we are going_to move further . The most potentially potent Cabinet members are of Kurdish origin ; we have never thought of discriminating . I am for democracy , I am for human_rights . But never mix the two issues up ( of Kurdish rights and the separatist guerrillas ) . There will never be a concession to ( give_up ) some part of this country . There will be no minority , everybody is first rank . In 1994 , there will be other steps we take_for the whole country . This is the only way .</TEXT>
