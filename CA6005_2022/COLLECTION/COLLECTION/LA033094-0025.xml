   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVES ON SOUTH_AFRICA ; ZULUS ARE THE KEY TO PEACE ; WITHOUT RESOLUTION , THEY PROMISE A FIGHT ' TO THE END ' ; THE CHALLENGE IS TO LURE THEM INTO A BROADER , SUCCESSFUL NATIONHOOD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How much bloody mayhem can the South_African body_politic absorb ? The answer , based on experience , is : plenty . But there is a limit . That point came dangerously close when the country ' s major city , Johannesburg , which had been bidding for the Olympic Games in 2004 , was closed_down on Monday . Zulu demonstrators singing praises to their king went_on the rampage , laying_into civilians as snipers shot at them from high-rise blocks , while resolute policing was conspicuously absent . An attempt to storm the headquarters of Nelson Mandela ' s African National Congress failed , thank God -- otherwise , considering the likely deaths of key political players , South_Africa could today be_well on_the_road to chaos , military coup or sundry other miseries . Perhaps 50 people died in Johannesburg ' s streets . But the other casualty was South_Africa and , because of the country ' s continental importance , Africa . If South_Africa does not get its democratic act together , its reconstructive role in the eventual recovery of Africa will be scuttled . Whether South_Africans will learn lessons from these events and pick their way through inevitable further violence to democratic elections at the end of April is a matter for conjecture . A nationwide rate of 10 deaths a day attributed to political violence has , in recent months , risen to more_than that figure in one region alone , Natal -- an exquisite subtropical garden province in the east peopled by Zulus , Asiatics and English , and boiling with unrest . Natal is the source of Monday ' s conflict in Johannesburg . This province ' s Zulu people , with a proud and militant if slightly overstated history , have spilled_over into vast areas of Transvaal Province and the environs of Johannesburg where they live and work and organize . Hence the latest mayhem when they demonstrated to have a sovereign kingdom &quot; back home &quot; in Zululand , which covers large tracts of Natal province . Their call was not unlike Quebec ' s for &quot; sovereignty association &quot; in Canada . But , unlike the relatively puny French separatist cadres , they have many millions of disciplined , spear-waving zealots to rely_on if called into action by their king , Goodwill Zwelethini , a rather dull personage who was not until recently taken very seriously outside Natal . The plague of violence , more_than anything else , places a question_mark over the future of the country . The big question is whether violence will accompany South_Africans into the future or be left largely behind as a new government under Nelson Mandela settles into power . The violence has its roots in the rough-and-ready delimitation of constituencies that has been going_on among black groups in preparation for the elections . Blacks , denied the vote previously , are staking their claims for the imminent day they shall exercise their vote . There is hope that -- continuing incidents notwithstanding -- there will be a gradual slowdown in violence after the election , partly because of a resolute security crackdown by a credible and legitimate new government . But more negotiation is needed . The immediate future will depend largely on the contest between the merchants of violence and the forces of law and order . Some observers believe that there is too_much pent-up anger , rivalry and resentment in the country -- or large parts of it -- to allow_for an easy crossing to democracy . They point to the seemingly intractable problems associated with Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi , whose Inkatha Freedom Party speaks_for an undetermined and conservative section of the Zulus in Natal province , and those of Nelson Mandela , president of the African National Congress , who has shown that he has substantial support among Zulus . A last-ditch attempt to resolve the conflict by bringing_in outside mediators , including Henry Kissinger , is now under way . There are also plans for an unprecedented summit involving President Frederik W . de Klerk , Mandela , the Zulu king and Buthelezi sometime next week . These two steps could be the last chances for peace , after which , in the words of the Zulu king , there could be a fight to &quot; the end. &quot; Whether the all-party Transitional Executive_Council set_up to usher_in a democratic order can assert itself in Natal , by establishing a state of emergency , remains to be seen . The violence in Natal and parts of Transvaal Province notwithstanding , large sections of the country are in a state of relative peace , causing foreign observers to note that free and fair elections can take_place in 90 % of the country . There may be &quot; mini-Bosnias &quot; in some districts , but no sign , as of now , that the general fabric of society is collapsing . There are right-wing Afrikaner desperadoes in the white community , counting_on some measure of support in the security Establishment , who have been at_work killing black civilians from passing cars , blowing_up buildings and campaigning for a boycott of the elections . They are dangerous but finite in numbers , determination and resources . The history of the Afrikaner , though rich_in initial heroism in conflict with giants like the Victorian British_Empire , generally shows the bulk of this Dutch / French / German-descended group settling with reality , and eschewing the &quot; bunker &quot; mentality , once they appreciate that they cannot win . This could apply in South_Africa after April . The Zulus , by contrast , have tended to fight to the last man against all comers , as they did_in the famous battle of Blood River against the ( Afrikaner ) Boers . The threat to the future , therefore , remains the millions of Zulus who might follow Buthelezi and their malleable king into suicidal opposition to the new order . They have to be lured into a broader , successful South_African nationhood . that ' s the challenge .</TEXT>
