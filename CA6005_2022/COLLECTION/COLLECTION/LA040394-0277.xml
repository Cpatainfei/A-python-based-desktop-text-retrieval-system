   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : EAST : EAST LOS ANGELES ; FUND-RAISER FOR UCLA STUDENTS FAILS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A recent fund-raiser dinner to assist seven students involved in last year ' s demonstrations for a Chicano studies department at UCLA failed to raise money , an organizer said , but it did succeed in acknowledging their efforts . Although the dinner at Tamayo ' s Restaurant was sold_out and 250 people attended , the costs were greater than anticipated , said Elo Castillo , an administrative assistant with the UCLA Chicano studies program who organized the March 25 event . There were problems in mailing the invitations out on_time , Castillo said , and tickets originally priced at $ 100 were reduced to $ 35 . &quot; We ' re just amateur fund-raisers. &quot; The proceeds were to have helped the seven students being held responsible_for $ 27 # 000 in damage to the Faculty Center in their effort to reimburse the school . &quot; This is very demoralizing for them , &quot; Castillo said . The damage -- a broken window , damaged furniture , defaced artwork and vandalism -- occurred in a May 11 demonstration for the establishment of a Chicano studies department with its own budget to hire faculty and direct its programming . After Chancellor Charles E . Young denied the students ' request -- on the eve of Cesar Chavez ' s funeral -- they went_on a hunger_strike . That ended 14 days later when the university agreed to establish the Cesar Chavez Center for Chicano Studies . The center operates as an inter-departmental program , borrowing faculty from other departments , while it is in the process of recruiting its own faculty . Meanwhile , the seven students have raised $ 7 # 000 through fund-raisers . A dance in October at a South-Central hall ended in the shooting of two students who have since recovered . No arrests have been made in that attack . The university has agreed to allow the students to earn money to pay_off their debt at Edutrain , a Downtown nonprofit education program that enrolls high_school dropouts . The university_students tutor or supervise activities , reducing their debt $ 10 for each hour . Student Michael Brewer , 21 , works six to eight hours a week at Edutrain , holds a part-time job as a teacher ' s assistant at an elementary_school and is a full-time student in the Afro-American studies program . He fears that the remainder of the debt will still be outstanding by a May 11 deadline , which , if not met , could result in the city attorney ' s office filing various charges against the seven . Brewer , who faces felony vandalism charges , maintains his innocence . &quot; You try to combat discrimination and this is what happens , &quot; Brewer said . Joaquin Ochoa , 21 , who went_on the hunger_strike but does not face any charges , said the past year has been discouraging for those who fought to establish the center . &quot; It ' s kind of a shame that the community and people have put so_much into it and the students that wanted social justice are facing prosecution , &quot; Ochoa said .
