   <HEADLINE> INVADING HAITI : BUT JUST HOW LONG DO WE WANT TO STAY ? ; SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT -- THE LAST U.S. INTERVENTION THERE LASTED 19 YEARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the Clinton_Administration seriously thinking_of using U.S. military power to end the political crisis in Haiti , some critics are pointing_out that a similar U.S. military intervention there -- from 1915 to 1934 -- did little good and even may have contributed to the problems that nation faces today . Although too glib , that argument does have some merit . Clearly Washington needs to ponder Haiti ' s history before intervening there again -- if only to keep U.S. policy-makers sharply aware of the towering amount of work that would remain even after the Marines ousted the junta in Port-au-Prince . The Elites That Have Always Ruled the Troubled Nation : Today ' s divided Haitian society , with its small urban elite reluctant to cede power to a poor peasant majority , dates to 1804 when the former French colony won independence after a long slave revolt . The majority of former slaves chose to settle as independent farmers in rural_areas . A few wealthy families tried to re-create the_French plantation system but failed . Other members of the elite managed to take_control of the foreign trade centered in the capital and used their financial clout to control the government , which included two new sources of wealth and power -- the military and the tax_system . For generations political turmoil was largely limited to infighting among the elite over the spoils of government power . That turmoil generated the crisis that led President Woodrow Wilson to order in the Marines . The 19-year U.S. administration in Haiti helped further consolidate political power in Port-au-Prince . Marine trainers improved the Haitian army . U.S. military_engineers built new roads that allowed the government -- usually through the army -- to reach all parts of the nation for the first time . Centralized power was well-established when in 1956 the government came under the control of the brutal dictator Francois ( Papa Doc ) Duvalier , whose family would rule the small nation as a corrupt fiefdom for the next 30 years . The Duvaliers co-opted the members of the elite whom they could not terrorize as they did the poor masses . The Duvalier regime collapsed in 1986 when the dictator ' s heirs fled to a prosperous exile . The current standoff in Haiti -- between the exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and a clique of military and police_officers who ousted him in 1991 -- is arguably only the latest painful twist in the aftermath of the Duvalier regime . And a Novel Political Fact -- the Democratically Conducted Aristide Election : But there is a difference this time , and it is a vitally important one to anyone who truly believes_in the necessity of democracy for trouble-plagued Haiti . Aristide was overwhelmingly elected in the most open and honest election ever held there . More_than 67 % of voters cast ballots for the controversial former Roman_Catholic priest . Perhaps as important for the United States , the nine months of Aristide ' s presidency were the only time in the last few years when illegal immigration from Haiti to this country declined . Clearly , no solution to Haiti ' s woes can exclude Aristide . The challenge is to convince Haiti ' s military -- and the elite that supports it , precisely because it mistrusts Aristide -- of this fact . The military has refused every effort to work_out an arrangement for Aristide ' s return , even a carefully crafted diplomatic formula signed under U.N. auspices in 1993 . That is why some in the White_House and Congress now want Marines in Haiti -- only this time just long enough to oust the junta that is keeping_out the legitimately elected president . To be sure , a great_power like the United States can never rule_out the military option . But before such a heavy-handed approach is used , every effort must be made to oust the junta through non-military pressure , like the economic sanctions imposed recently by the United Nations and the Organization of American_States . Perhaps when they are hit hard enough in the pocketbook the Haitian economic elite will withdraw their support from a leadership composed of military thugs and shift it , however grudgingly , to the most popular president in Haiti ' s modern history . An awesome challenge of nation building would still remain for President Aristide , but at least he would be able to face it without the inevitable complications , and bitter aftertaste , of a U.S. military intervention .</TEXT>
