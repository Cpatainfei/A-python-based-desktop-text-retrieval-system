   <HEADLINE> CLINTON SEEKS $ 24.8 BILLION FOR IMMIGRATION ; GOVERNMENT : WHITE_HOUSE SAYS REQUEST IS ONE-THIRD GREATER THAN BUSH_ADMINISTRATION ' S PLAN . BUT WILSON AIDE CRITICIZES IT AS CREATIVE ACCOUNTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Showcasing its attentiveness to the immigration issue , the Clinton_Administration released figures Tuesday indicating that its spending requests for the next fiscal_year were one-third greater than the amount sought for immigration-related programs in the last Bush budget . The briefing , held by Budget Director Leon Panetta and INS Commissioner Doris Meissner , came_on the eve of Gov . Pete Wilson ' s visit to Washington today in search of federal funding to offset the costs of illegal immigrants -- and presumably to take the Administration to task for not acting forcefully or quickly enough on his demands . The figures show California in_line to receive the lion ' s share of the proposed federal spending on immigration-related programs that range from agriculture to education to law_enforcement . But in compiling the figures , the Administration combined federal spending for legal and illegal immigration , thus yielding more robust spending numbers than had been previously used in the Washington-Sacramento dispute . An Office of Management and Budget spokesman said the federal spending could not be accurately broken_down between legal and illegal immigration . Of the $ 24.8 billion sought by the White_House for immigration-related programs in the next fiscal_year , the Administration projected that California would receive $ 8.4 billion -- nearly $ 6 billion more_than second-place New York . Panetta calculated that in fiscal 1993 President George_Bush requested $ 18.8 billion in federal spending on immigration and other programs affecting immigrants . The Clinton fiscal 1995 budget seeks about $ 6 billion more , representing the one-third increase nationwide . The combination of federal spending for legal and illegal immigration spurred swift reaction from a top Wilson aide . Leslie Goodman , the governor ' s deputy chief_of_staff for communications , dismissed the Clinton numbers as creative accounting and an attempt to &quot; get the cash_register to ring to a higher number. &quot; &quot; They saw this as an opportunity to get their story out before the states give_out the facts . To confuse ( spending on legal and illegal immigration ) is to start down a very slippery slope , &quot; Goodman said . Wilson in January estimated that the federal_government owed the state $ 2.3 billion in illegal-immigration costs and factored the entire amount into his state budget calculations . He has since lowered his budget expectations to $ 760 million in federal reimbursements , but argues that the federal_government still owes California the higher amount . &quot; I think the governors of each impacted state have legitimate problems . . . but I think that there ' s a tendency in some instances to overplay this issue , &quot; Panetta said . &quot; I don ' t think the President questions the need to deal with the issue , but it has to be done with sensitivity and responsibility. &quot; Meissner , meanwhile , offered an update on the Administration ' s plan to slow illegal immigration with greater vigilance along the country ' s southwest border . San Diego and El Paso , which account_for 65 % of the country ' s yearly immigrant apprehensions , are targets of the most assistance . Meissner cites 350 new Border_Patrol agents , 250 new vehicles , 350 new encrypted voice radios , 14 additional miles of border fence and a new automated processing system as examples of the Administration ' s efforts . Also included in the Administration ' s proposed immigration reform package are speedier deportation procedures , streamlined asylum adjudications , stiffer employer sanctions and greater emphasis on naturalization of legal immigrants . In a plea for increased cooperation , Panetta called_for a state-federal partnership to combat Capitol_Hill opposition to the immigration initiatives , which benefit only a_few states . Of particular importance to California is an Administration plan to seek $ 350 million to help states saddled with the costs of incarcerating large_numbers of illegal immigrant prisoners . Panetta , a veteran California legislator who formerly chaired the House Budget Committee , announced the spending allocation with considerable fanfare in April . But he warned that it faced a difficult legislative sojourn because it would benefit only the six or seven states most severely affected by the problem . As if on cue , the money was yanked out by an appropriations subcommittee earlier this month in favor of diverting it into an anti-drug program that would distribute the funds throughout the country . &quot; How do you get resources to these ( affected ) states ? &quot; Panetta said . &quot; My God , we ' re having one hell of a time trying to commit resources to the investments that all_of us care about . . . . If six or seven impacted states are asking_for additional resources , then is there any question in anybody ' s mind that this is one hell of a battle ? &quot;</TEXT>
