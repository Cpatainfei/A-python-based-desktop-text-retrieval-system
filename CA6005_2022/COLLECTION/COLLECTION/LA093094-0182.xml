   <HEADLINE> U.S. PANEL URGES FULL OVERHAUL OF CANCER RESEARCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal advisory panel Thursday recommended a sweeping overhaul of the nation ' s anti-cancer campaign , predicting that -- if its present course continues -- cancer will surpass heart_disease as the nation ' s leading killer within five years . In a report to Congress , the group said that the program suffers from a lack of coordination and a shortage of funds needed to pursue &quot; unprecedented opportunities &quot; in scientific_research . It said that a White House-led effort -- including Cabinet-level representation -- is needed . It also called_for tougher federal policies against tobacco , including higher taxes , the elimination of tobacco subsidies and of tax_deductions for tobacco product advertising , prohibiting tobacco exports and an end to federal funding to cancer research organizations that accept tobacco_industry support . Tobacco use has been scientifically established as the primary cause of lung_cancer and has also been associated with several other types of cancer . The panel , a subcommittee of the National Cancer Advisory Board -- an independent group of outside experts that advises the National Cancer Institute -- characterized existing cancer care_for the poor , elderly and uninsured as inadequate and said that most congressional health reform measures would have worsened an already bad situation by failing to provide explicit &quot; universal cancer-care coverage. &quot; &quot; We are not taking full advantage of opportunities for prevention , &quot; said Dr. Paul Calabresi , a professor of medicine at the Brown University School_of_Medicine , who served as chairman of the subcommittee . &quot; Patients ' and survivors ' quality_of_life can be improved . Most importantly , the advances we have made in prevention , diagnosis , treatment and rehabilitation are not available equally to all_of the people. &quot; One in three people will be diagnosed with cancer during a lifetime and an estimated 1.2 million new cancer cases will be added this year to the 8 million Americans alive today who already have been diagnosed . Although enormous medical advances have been made , the incidence of cancer has risen 18 % and the death rate 7 % since 1971 , when Congress launched the nation ' s &quot; war on cancer &quot; by passing the National Cancer Act . The 15-member panel -- made_up of representatives from cancer research , medicine , nursing , industry , communications and patient advocacy -- was asked by Congress to evaluate why cancer is still on the rise after $ 23 billion in spending since 1971 . The report called_for a detailed evaluation of cancer research programs and priorities , the elimination of excessive earmarking or redirection of research funds and an expansion of the National Cancer Institute ' s network of cancer centers . The American Cancer Society praised the report , particularly its emphasis on health reform and the need to crack_down on tobacco . It &quot; adds substantial new weight to the need for health_care reform that provides universal access to care , &quot; said Dr. Irvin Fleming , president of the society . Also , the report &quot; adds_to the inevitability that tobacco taxes will be raised substantially. &quot; Such a tax increase &quot; is the single most effective way to reduce smoking rates and especially among children , &quot; he added . The committee also noted that more support is needed for so-called translational research -- the bridge connecting basic research to its application in humans . Such researchers are becoming &quot; an endangered species , &quot; and the result will be that &quot; the transfer of knowledge from the laboratory to the people will be delayed needlessly , &quot; the report said . The panel said that an additional $ 60 million per year -- or about $ 1 million for each NCI-approved cancer center -- should go toward encouraging translational research . This money is especially needed now because support that formerly came from pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries &quot; is diminishing rapidly &quot; because of health reform pressures , the panel said .</TEXT>
