   <HEADLINE> NEO-NAZI ATTACK ON DISABLED GIRL RECALLS WWII TERRORISM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reminded of the Third_Reich ' s attempt to exterminate the physically disabled , Germans sought to come_to grips Wednesday with a neo-Nazi attack that left a wheelchair-bound girl with a swastika carved on her face . A private advocacy group called Help for Germany ' s Handicapped said the Monday assault on the 17-year-old in the eastern German city of Halle was not an isolated incident . Eighty disabled people have reported being victims of attacks by rightist extremists in 1992 and 1993 , said Friedel Rinn , chairman of the Duesseldorf-based group . One of the victims died . A nationwide dragnet has been launched for the girl ' s assailants . But Halle police said they still do not know who carried_out the attack in broad daylight not far from her school . &quot; This is so disgusting that it could only have come from a sick mind , &quot; said Otto Regenspurger , the federal_government ' s advocate for the disabled . Rinn blamed Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s social_policies , saying the government has done too_little to encourage sympathy for Germany ' s needy and disadvantaged . But Regenspurger blamed violent movies and television . He said the assailants may have been copying a recent television drama about neo-Nazis that included a portrayal of the same crime . Halle high_school students organized a march for today to protest the attack . Police in Halle sent composite pictures of the assailants to investigators across Germany and are asking residents for help in finding the culprits . City police spokesman Ralf Berger said about 60 people have called with possible clues but that there have been no arrests . The federal justice minister says police must make a concerted drive this year to end neo-Nazi violence , which has killed 30 people since 1990 . The Halle slashing victim told police she was stopped by two male skinheads and a teen-age girl just after leaving class . Identified only as Elke , the victim said one of the male extremists cut a swastika into her left cheek after she refused to repeat fascist slogans .</TEXT>
