   <HEADLINE> LOOKING FOR FAIR OPTIONS ; HEALTH SCREENINGS CAN BE A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO KEEP TABS ON PHYSICAL CONDITION , BUT can ' t TAKE THE PLACE OF PERSONALIZED CARE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you are curious about your cholesterol , worried about your blood_pressure or bothered by bunions -- but dread spending the better part of the morning ( not to mention your paycheck ) in a doctor ' s office , there may be an easier -- and cheaper -- way . You can get a variety of basic medical_exams , advice and information for free or at low prices at health fairs , offered by hospitals and community organizations throughout the San Fernando Valley area . Health fairs include head-to-toe basic screenings -- from vision checks to foot exams . You can find_out if you are at risk for prostate cancer , learn how to do a breast self-exam or discover if your cholesterol is under_control . You can get weighed and measured , rate your lifestyle according to its health quotient or have your children immunized and fingerprinted . You can pick_up information on whatever interests you , join a support group for whatever worries you or be referred to a physician who specializes in whatever ails you . The mother of all health screenings is the annual Health Fair Expo , held today through April 24 at hospitals , shopping_malls and community agencies throughout Southern California . Sponsored by the American Red_Cross and various organizations and hospitals , Health Fair Expo has served more_than a_million people in its 17-year history . Height , weight and vision exams , as well as health displays , AIDS education and an assortment of screenings and services , are provided at all Health Fair Expo locations . Everything is free , except for prostate , cholesterol and other tests requiring lab work , which are usually available for about $ 20 to $ 25 each . People who have abnormal test results will be asked to see their own doctor or referred to a physician . &quot; You can get a lot of things tested for very little cost -- and it is more fun to be checked at a fair than a physician ' s office , &quot; said Dr. Martin Smietanka , a Burbank family practice physician who regularly volunteers for Health Fair Expo . &quot; Health fairs are focused_on promoting health and preventing or catching diseases in their early stages . People enjoy them , they have a good time , and they learn a lot. &quot; But in no way do health fair screenings substitute for personalized medical_care , Smietanka said . &quot; Health fairs are not the place to go if you have specific symptoms , such_as chest or stomach pains or shortness of breath . You need to see a physician. &quot; Fair-goers should also be aware that the hospitals ' motives for throwing such events are not solely altruistic . The fairs are good advertising for the sponsoring facilities -- and they bring_in patients . &quot; Health fairs identify people who have a life-threatening diagnosis -- and that , of course , leads to a hospital admission , &quot; said David Langness , vice_president of communications for the Hospital Council of Southern California . &quot; But the fairs do not pay_for themselves by any means . Out of 1 # 000 people , maybe one will need treatment. &quot; Hospitals typically spend thousands of dollars in_labor , publicity , supplies and handouts for a single health fair , said Sue Wyninegar , director of marketing at St . Joseph Medical_Center in Burbank . &quot; Some hospitals have dropped_out of offering health fairs because they are not the most productive things in the world . You don ' t get a lot of business from them. &quot; According to Wyninegar , nonprofit facilities sponsor the events as a community service -- and also as a way to prove their &quot; social accountability , &quot; required to maintain tax-exempt status . &quot; Part of our mission is to provide education and preventive care , and health fairs are a good way to do that , &quot; she said . &quot; Plus they create top-of-mind awareness of the hospital . They get a lot of people into the medical_center , and if they have a good experience , they will want to come back. &quot; Health fair exams are certainly more pleasant and less of a hassle than a trip to the doctor ' s office , but they may_not save a lot of money for people with adequate health_insurance . A doctor ' s visit , including lab work , may cost just $ 5 or $ 10 through many HMOs . If your health plan pays 80 % of health services , your out-of-pocket expenses at the doctor ' s office may be no more_than what you would fork over at a health fair for a cholesterol check . &quot; Health fairs are helpful in that they offer screenings and information in less intimidating circumstances than a doctor ' s office , &quot; said Dr. Adelaide Randak , a Woodland Hills family practice physician . &quot; But the flip side is that the information people receive may be inadequate . Health fairs are not set_up to really question or interview patients , and the personnel administering the tests may_not be qualified to interpret the results. &quot; Randak believes that the best tests to seek at health fairs are those that yield uniformly accurate results , such_as blood_pressure , blood_sugar , cholesterol , anemia and blood panels . &quot; Assuming a good lab is used , those are all well-established tests that reliably indicate whether the patient needs follow-up or not , &quot; she said . Randak added that blood_tests must be performed on an empty stomach ; otherwise , the results will be skewed . &quot; If you just had a taco and snow cone , your cholesterol and blood_sugar tests will be wildly inaccurate , &quot; she said . One also should not expect individualized , in-depth care at health fairs , according to Dr. Martin Gelbard , a Burbank urologist . &quot; In health fair situations you really don ' t have any time to discuss symptoms . You don ' t have an opportunity for detailed questions and answers . You don ' t get the patient ' s history that gives information you need . And that doctor-patient interaction -- not just a bunch of blood_tests that you get from assembly-line screening programs -- is one of the most important factors_in identifying a problem. &quot; As a consequence , fair-goers may be unnecessarily alarmed when nothing is wrong -- or even worse , incorrectly reassured when there really is a problem . &quot; Someone may have a slightly abnormal test -- but not cancer , &quot; Gelbard said . &quot; And a small percentage of men who have ( prostate ) cancer may have a normal blood test. &quot; Despite their limitations , health fairs can be lifesavers . Smietanka remembers a fit , healthy-looking , 65-year-old fellow with no symptoms of illness . The man attended last year ' s Health Fair Expo on a whim , took_part in a_few screenings -- and learned that he had colon and prostate cancer . &quot; Both cancers were caught in time , and he is still doing_well , &quot; Smietanka said .
