   <HEADLINE> HIKING : BIG SUR : THIS RAMBLE COMES WITH A VIEW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mt . Carmel Trail puts a lot of Big Sur at your feet . Three points en route -- Skinner Ridge , Devil ' s Peak and Mt . Carmel -- offer inspiring panoramas of what some California naturalists call &quot; the Middle Kingdom. &quot; From 4 # 417-foot-high Mt . Carmel in the Ventana Wilderness , you can see Carmel , Salinas , Monterey Bay and the Santa Cruz Mountains . The view is worth the strenuous day hike . For weekend backpackers , the route over Skinner ' s Ridge and down Big Pines Trail into the Little Sur River watershed is ideal . From the trail head at Bottchers Gap , it ' s 10 miles round_trip to Comings Camp . One of my favorite overnight destinations , madrono-shaded Pat Springs Camp , is a 14 1 / 4-mile sojourn round_trip . In summer , hikers should check with rangers about the availability of water at the area ' s backcountry campsites . Bring plenty of drinking_water , no matter . At Bottchers Gap is a campground and a parking_area for day hikers . The trail head , at 2 # 080 feet , gives hikers a nice head_start for the climb to come . Directions to trail head : From Carmel , drive 12 miles south on California 1 to the junction with Palo Colorado Road ( this junction is one-quarter mile south of the turnoff to Rocky Point Restaurant ) . Turn inland , climbing 7 3 / 4 miles to the road ' s end at Bottchers Gap Campground . Skinner Ridge Trail begins at the northeast ( upper left ) end of the camp ' s parking_area . The hike : The path ascends north , quickly leaving_behind the oak-shaded campground and heading into the chaparral . After brief exertion , hikers get the first of many views . To the northwest is the ocean ; behind you , to the south , is the beautiful Pico Blanco peak . The hike ' s second mile is viewless ; the path zigzags , drops into gullies and can seem disorienting at times . After crossing a field of bracken ferns , the trail makes a final short , but steep , climb to Skinner ' s Ridge . Some of Big Sur ' s ecological complexity is apparent from the ridge : golden grasslands dotted with oaks , the light greens and grays of the chaparral on south-facing slopes and the dark greens of the hardwood forests on north-facing slopes . A northward walk along the oak- and madrono-shaded ridge ( these are some of the largest madrono growing on the central coast ) brings you to a saddle and a junction with Turner Creek Trail . This side trail leads to Apple Creek Trail Camp ( 1 / 2 mile ) and to Turner Creek Trail Camp ( 1 mile ) . Both are pleasant overnight stops or picnic spots . Continue on the main route -- now known and sometimes signed as Big Pines Trail -- for a steep , shadeless and strenuous mile through manzanita to Devil ' s Peak viewpoint . The view includes the Pacific to the west , Pico Blanco to the south and lonely Ventana Double Cone to the southeast . Continue another 1 / 10 mile east to a junction with the left-bearing Mt . Carmel Trail . March along a scrub oak-covered ridgeline three quarters of a mile to Mt . Carmel ' s brushy , flat-topped summit . You would n ' t get much of a view from the top if it were not for the fortunate presence of a granite outcropping . Scramble up the chunk of granite , or the section of telephone_pole some considerate soul installed atop the peak , and marvel at the vista . Due_north is Monterey and to the northwest is Pebble Beach and Carmel . On fogless days you can see Santa Cruz , about 40 miles away , at the north end of Monterey Bay . About 20 miles to the northeast is Salinas , to the west is the deep blue Pacific , and to the south are miles and miles of Big Sur backcountry . Skinner Ridge , Big Pines , Mt . Carmel Trails Where : Ventana Wilderness , Big Sur Distance : Bottchers Gap to Skinner Ridge vista is 4 miles round_trip with 1 # 200-foot elevation gain ; to Mt . Carmel is 9 mile round_trip with 2 # 300-foot elevation gain . Terrain : Mosaic of chapparal , oak-madrono woodland . Highlights : 360-degree vistas on Monterey Bay and Big Sur ; good weekend backpacking trip . Degree of difficulty : Moderate to strenuous .
