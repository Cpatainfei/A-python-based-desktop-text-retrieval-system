   <TEXT> Alice Hoffman , author of &quot; At Risk &quot; and &quot; Turtle Moon &quot; among many other novels , comes_close to giving the game away very early in &quot; Second Nature. &quot; * A fur trapper walking his line in the far north woods finds a person caught by the foot in one of his steel snares , the skin-clad youth near death from cold and lost blood . The trapper is amazed at the discovery , of course , but while taking his unintended prey to the hospital , he is equally amazed by the young_man ' s serene expression . &quot; If he ' d seen anything like this face before , &quot; Hoffman says of the trapper , &quot; it was in the chapel at St . Joseph ' s . . . . To the right of the pews , in a dark alcove , there had been a statue made of white wood with a countenance so calm it had made him weep. &quot; The youth compared to Jesus , or at least some saint , turns_out to have been raised by a family of wolves after an airplane crash of which he , at age 3 , was the sole survivor . Reunited with the human_race , he seems unable to speak ; he makes not a sound at the New York hospital to which he is sent , frightening the staff -- who call him the Wolf Man -- with his silence , his stillness , his preference for raw_meat . The Wolf Man is neither particularly feral nor particularly heroic -- like the reported Wild Child and Rome ' s wolf-suckled Romulus , respectively -- but in Hoffman ' s hands he becomes a compelling figure nonetheless : more humane and , in some ways , more plainly human than the people he meets . We know that ' s going_to be the case the moment Hoffman portrays the Wolf Man as Christlike : The main question , thereafter , is what form his crucifixion will take , and whether Hoffman can pull it off with grace . &quot; Second Nature &quot; is not yawningly predictable , as one might assume given that the general course and moral position of the novel are evident from the first pages . Hoffman ' s premise is awfully familiar -- we know we ' re going to encounter the nature-versus-nurture debate -- yet she downplays that aspect of the book by focusing less on the Wolf Man than on the characters who surround him . Principal among them is Robin Moore , who sets the story in motion by liberating the Wolf Man , on impulse , from the hospital ( she had heard of his existence from her brother , one of the Wolf Man ' s doctors ) . Robin , newly separated from her policeman husband , takes the Wolf Man home to her small , isolated town on Long_Island , and before long he has learned to speak , read and work alongside Robin in her off-and-on landscaping business . The Wolf Man -- now referred to as Stephen , because he has remembered his name -- doesn ' t intend to alter others ' lives , but his presence is like a powerful magnet rearranging hopes and expectations . Roy , Robin ' s ex-husband-to-be , becomes intensely jealous when he learns that Stephen is living_in his old house , and notes too that Stephen is a superb physical specimen , running_for miles and miles simply for the pleasure of it . Old Dick , Robin ' s cantankerous 91-year-old grandfather , finds in Stephen the only person capable of understanding him , the Wolf Man showing an exceptional reverence for age and experience . And Robin , for her part , can ' t help falling_in_love with Stephen , drawn to his strength , loyalty and integrity . Robin ' s love is requited -- fortunately for her but unfortunately for him , because love compels Stephen to stay in unfamiliar territory and thus become a natural scapegoat . Stephen ' s crucifixion isn ' t literal -- he ' s simply accused of committing a series of increasingly heinous crimes in his adopted town . For a time one may wonder whether Stephen is indeed responsible , the wolf in him unable to control his predatory habits . But Hoffman scotches that possibility by her idealization of the Wolf Man and introduction of another character who fits , stereotypically , the killer-among-us profile . that ' s a notable false note in &quot; Second Nature , &quot; but not vital because the other characters are thoroughly convincing in all their confusions and ambivalences . It ' s a major theme in the novel , although rarely explicit , that while &quot; men think_about right and wrong . . . wolves have to know. &quot; The fairest way of judging a book , I ' ve long believed , is to determine , first , whether it succeeds on its own terms , and second , whether those terms are sufficient to the book ' s themes . &quot; Second Nature &quot; defies such analysis , however , for although both questions can be answered in the affirmative , the novel never takes_off or reveals new insights into human nature . It ' s as much an allegory as a novel , and as allegory , it forces characters and events to conform_to the author ' s moral vision rather than letting the characters create a vision for themselves . Call &quot; Second Nature &quot; a qualified success : technically accomplished , but hampered by a story that can only lead , without significant modification , down a conventional path .</TEXT>
