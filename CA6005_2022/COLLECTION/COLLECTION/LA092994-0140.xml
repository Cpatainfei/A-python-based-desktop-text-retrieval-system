   <HEADLINE> NOSTALGIA BEAT ; A RETIRED LAPD DETECTIVE LEADS AN EFFORT TO TURN AN OLD STATION INTO A MUSEUM OF LOS ANGELES POLICE HISTORY AND MEMORABILIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The man in the yellowing newspaper photo doesn ' t look happy , and who can blame him ? Richard Kalk , who unearthed the photograph in his search through Los Angeles Police_Department archives , says the man probably ran a red_light , for which he was imprisoned in what Kalk calls &quot; our first air-conditioned jail. &quot; The jail was a small cell attached_to the side of a police motor_scooter . In the photo the prisoner is being written_up by a grim-faced LAPD officer . The photo is one of thousands of bits of memorabilia which Kalk , founder of the Los Angeles Police Historical Society , plans to display in an LAPD museum . For five years , the historical society has been working_on converting the old Highland Park stationinto a community and educational center that will showcase the LAPD ' s sometimes glamorous , sometimes inglorious history . With a major fund-raiser scheduled for next week and a group of volunteers from the Walt Disney Corp . on board , the museum is_on the verge of becoming a reality , one Kalk hopes can help reconnect the public with the police . &quot; The rebuilding of Los Angeles doesn ' t start with the buildings and parks , &quot; says Kalk , a 55-year-old retired homicide detective and winner of the department ' s medal of valor . &quot; The rebuilding of Los Angeles begins with rebuilding the relationship of the police agency with the community. &quot; Kalk hopes the museum will join places such_as the Southwest Museum and the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum as a destination for Southland tourists . But he also wants it to draw students from area schools , and he is working with the Los Angeles Unified School District to add the museum to the district ' s civics curriculum . &quot; You can go_into a kids ' classroom and teach them -- that ' s nice , &quot; Kalk said . &quot; But you drag them out of that school environment and to a place like this , and teach them the same lesson , you get 20 times the response. &quot; Kalk was winding_up his 30 years with the LAPD when he hit upon the idea of starting a museum . &quot; You start thinking_about it when you get_to be my age , &quot; he said . &quot; You start thinking ' You know , when we walk_out that door , there ' s nothing to show we ' ve ever been through. ' &quot; So Kalk and some friends and colleagues formed the historical society in 1989 . The first task was to find a site , and the group settled_on the LAPD ' s former Northeast Division headquarters in Highland Park , which was built_in 1923 and has been vacant since 1983 . They persuaded the City_Council to lease it to them for $ 1 a year for the next 30 years . There have been some troubles along the way : The Rodney G . King beating , which greatly tarnished the department ' s image , occurred just as the historical society was getting ready to go public with the project . And the building that will house the museum is scarred from a fire set by vandals earlier this year . But Kalk said he hopes retrofitting can start on the old station in January with funds from an old city bond issue to finance seismic work_on historic buildings . If Tuesday ' s black-tie dinner , which will honor the memory of actor Jack Webb , along with subsequent events , can raise the needed $ 3.3 million , the museum could be finished by 1997 . Kalk said the museum will have displays on the King beating and the ensuing riots , as well as on the rampant corruption in the early years of the department . &quot; You ' ve got_to show the bumps , &quot; he said . Among other exhibits , the museum will contain displays honoring recipients of the medal of valor and officers killed in the line_of_duty , exhibits of LAPD uniforms through the years and , Kalk hopes , an interactive area with a simulated crime scene where visitors can pretend they are eyewitnesses . Plans call_for a one-officer substation at the front of the museum , and the basement will be a community meeting area for organizations such_as Neighborhood Watch groups . The public has been able to get a sneak_preview of the museum through the historical society ' s mobile museum , a converted Frito-Lay truck that travels_to civic events and showcases some of the society ' s more popular memorabilia . The jail sidecar drew rounds of laughter when the mobile museum stopped at the Newton Division on a recent weekend . &quot; They should bring those back ! &quot; declared Sindey Ginyard , an Inglewood video technician . &quot; Imagine what the civil libertarians would say , &quot; Kalk said as he and Ginyard brainstormed on possible uses for the sidecar cell today . One idea was to use a similar vehicle at civic parades to &quot; imprison &quot; public officials . Carmen Orquiz struggled to pry her daughter Stacie , 6 , away from a display of glistening LAPD badges from the first_half of the century . &quot; I want the gold one , ' cause it ' s nice , &quot; Stacie insisted . One badge she pointed to was a police reporter ' s badge -- a reminder of those cozier days in the 1920s , when the department gave_out badges even to journalists . Orquiz , a South Gate resident who is planning to enter the Police_Academy this fall , said she was glad her three children had a chance to learn about police history . &quot; They can get more familiar_with what I ' m getting_into , and learn to respect police , &quot; she said . And the displays of LAPD history reconfirmed 12-year-old Frederico Reyes ' career plans . &quot; I want to become an officer , &quot; he said as he stepped_out of the trailer . &quot; So I can protect people. &quot;</TEXT>
