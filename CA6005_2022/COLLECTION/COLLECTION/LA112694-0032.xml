   <HEADLINE> MEMBERS OF INTERIM RWANDA PARLIAMENT ARE SWORN IN ; AFRICA : NEW MPS PLEDGE TO WORK TOWARD UNITY IN NATION WHERE UP TO A MILLION PEOPLE DIED IN MASSACRES AND CIVIL WAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rwanda in stalled an interim Parliament on Friday with the enormous tasks of reconciling its two main ethnic_groups , rebuilding its economy and ushering_in democratic rule . One by one , the 70 members of the Transitional National Assembly stood , Bible in_hand , and took an oath before hundreds of their countrymen in a Kigali stadium . They pledged to work toward unity of their central African_country , in which up_to a_million people died in massacres and civil_war between April and July . Most of the victims were members of the minority Tutsi tribe killed by the majority Hutu . &quot; This is the first_step toward democratic rule , toward unity of our country , and you men and women must work to make that a reality , &quot; Prime_Minister Faustin Twagirimungu told them . The assembly is made_up of representatives nominated by eight political_parties and the Tutsi-led rebel army that defeated the previous Hutu-dominated government and army in July . It allegedly excludes parties implicated in the genocide . Members will serve for five years , after which presidential and parliamentary elections have been promised . Head_of_State Pasteur Bizimungu presided over the swearing-in , accompanied by Vice_President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame . Many Rwandans and outsiders believe that the country cannot know peace as long as nearly 2 million Hutus , including the troops and militia of the former government , are exiled in Zaire , Burundi and Tanzania . The government says it wants to put_on trial many of those in exile for their role in genocide after the assassination of military strongman and president Juvenal Habyarimana on April 6 . Diplomats said the assembly ' s most difficult task will be reviving an economy shattered by war and starved of foreign_aid . Western donors are holding_back new aid and emergency credits until Rwanda reaches an agreement with the World_Bank and the International Monetary Fund , which seek repayment of $ 9 million in_arrears . Western nations also want to see a move toward democratic rule as conditions for resuming bilateral aid .</TEXT>
