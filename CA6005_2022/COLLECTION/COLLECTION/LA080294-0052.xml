   <HEADLINE> ALLRED URGES D.A. TO REQUEST DEATH_PENALTY FOR SIMPSON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In another sign of the politicization of the O.J. Simpson murder case , feminist attorney Gloria Allred on Monday called_on Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti to ask_for the death_penalty against Simpson . Allred contended at a Downtown news_conference that if Garcetti declines to seek the maximum penalty of death , it will indicate that he is showing favoritism to a celebrity defendant and manifesting insufficient concern about the plight of battered women . &quot; Were it not a celebrity defendant , it seems highly likely that ( Garcetti ) would ask_for the death_penalty in a case such_as this involving allegations of first-degree murder with special circumstances as he has in the Menendez brothers case , where there are the same number of victims as exist in this case , &quot; Allred said . Wearing a photo of Nicole Brown Simpson on her bright red suit , Allred noted that in recent months the district_attorney ' s office had asked_for the death_penalty in two cases in which women had hired &quot; hit_men &quot; to murder their husbands . &quot; If Mr. Simpson committed the murders with which he is charged , he certainly shouldn ' t get a break from the D.A. on the death_penalty because he committed the crime himself rather than hiring others to do_it , &quot; Allred said . To strengthen her contentions , she brought along anti-abortion activist Susan Carpenter McMillan and a woman whose husband is in jail for spousal battery . The trio demanded that Garcetti meet with women ' s groups about this issue , as he did with civil_rights leaders July 19 . At that meeting , ministers , political figures and others , including attorney Johnnie L . Cochran , who later joined Simpson ' s defense_team , made suggestions to Garcetti designed to ensure that Simpson receives a fair trial . Moreover , at the end of the meeting , John Mack , president of the Los Angeles Urban League , urged that Garcetti not seek the death_penalty . Mack said he opposed it on moral grounds and because Death Rows &quot; throughout California and throughout the nation &quot; are disproportionately filled with black people . Garcetti &quot; set a precedent meeting with African American leaders , which has opened the door for him to meet with women ' s groups . Had he never met with any group then we would n ' t have the right to ask_for a meeting , &quot; Carpenter McMillan said . &quot; It is too late for Nicole , but not too late for me to stand_up and demand that she and other battered women be remembered and respected , &quot; said Maria St . John Conde , a victim of battering . The women stressed that they were not making any statement on Simpson ' s guilt . Rather , they said that if the jury finds Simpson guilty of murdering his former wife and her friend , Ronald Lyle Goldman , it should be able to decide whether the death_penalty is appropriate . An eight-member , all-male committee of Garcetti and senior deputy district_attorneys is to make a decision before the trial ' s scheduled Sept . 19 start on whether to seek the death_penalty . Under California law , Simpson would be eligible for capital_punishment because the murder_charges carry the special circumstances that more_than one person was killed . Legal experts said that Garcetti faces a thorny decision and that Monday ' s news_conference adds another dimension that has been beneath the surface . On the one hand , UCLA criminal_law professor Peter Arenella said , &quot; the seriousness and pervasiveness of male violence against women cannot be ignored. &quot; Considerably more resources need to be devoted to that problem , he said , including &quot; many_more shelters for battered women , domestic violence units in prosecutor ' s offices , significant penalties for first-time male offenders , and greater compassion for battered women who lash back against their abusers . &quot; But asking_for the death_penalty in the Simpson case would not advance any of these goals , &quot; Arenella said . &quot; When Simpson was convicted of spousal abuse in 1989 , he should have received a sentence that reflected the gravity of his crime , rather than the slap_on the wrist he got &quot; -- no jail time , a fine , community service and a counseling program . &quot; However , seeking the death_penalty now would only be a futile exercise in symbolic politics , &quot; Arenella said . &quot; And the symbolic message behind such a request would only perpetuate the myth that our criminal justice system somehow depreciates the seriousness of an unjustifiable homicide when it imprisons a convicted murderer for the rest of his life. &quot; Loyola Law_School professor Laurie Levenson also expressed reservations : &quot; You have to be careful about using the death_penalty to advance political causes . Each decision on whether to seek the death_penalty must be based on the facts of the case , including the background of the defendant , the nature of the crime and any mitigating or aggravating factors. &quot; Cochran called Allred ' s suggestion &quot; outrageous. &quot; While emphasizing that he considers spousal abuse a serious problem , he said Allred &quot; knows that there has been no linkage established that these killings were a result of spousal abuse. &quot; &quot; I think it is tragic that she would use this forum to exploit this situation , &quot; he said . Cochran added that the district_attorney ' s office should make its decision &quot; using the standards it uses in every case. &quot; The district_attorney ' s office declined to comment on Allred ' s statements .</TEXT>
