   <HEADLINE> EMERGING GAYS FIND FEAR AND REJOICING IN NEVADA ; CULTURE : THEIR GROWING SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CLOUT AND A RESULTANT BACKLASH ILLUMINATE THE STATE ' S PSYCHIC SPLIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> History was made here one Sunday in March , when Gov . Bob Miller , resplendent in a stars-and-stripes leather jacket , took_to the podium at a dark little bar and got a standing_ovation from the raucous crowd . &quot; I never thought I ' d see the day when I ' d see a Nevada governor in a gay bar , &quot; recounted Eddie Anderson , master of ceremonies for the rally . The event also drew Las Vegas Mayor Jan Jones -- who is challenging Miller in the governor ' s race -- and a host of other political luminaries in this self-proclaimed &quot; frontier state &quot; and bastion of western independence . But it was a bittersweet moment for the growing number of lesbians and gay_men in Nevada -- proof of newly minted clout , evidence of continuing vulnerability . Just months after the Legislature repealed the state ' s 82-year-old anti-sodomy law , conservative activists launched a petition drive to make_it legal to discriminate against gay_men and lesbians . The rally was called_in opposition to the initiative -- a carpetbagging measure written by Lon Mabon , the architect of similar legislation throughout the Pacific Northwest . As Mabon and his followers are the first to admit , this is a watershed year for gays in the Silver_State . They are learning to flex their political and social muscle ; in so doing , they are bringing Nevada face to face with its contrary personalities . On the one hand , Nevada has long embraced behavior that no other state would allow ; on the other , it blushes fast and easy . &quot; It is a dual personality here , &quot; says Ward Bushee , executive editor of the Reno Gazette-Journal . It is the live-and-let-live side of this statewide schizophrenia that helps to explain why the firsts for gays and lesbians are tumbling in almost too fast to count : * This year has brought Nevada its first openly gay candidate for any public office . Jack Levin , 31 , is running_for Clark County school trustee . In 1990 , he ran_for Assembly and lost in a close Republican primary . &quot; When I ran ( before ) , I was gay , &quot; Levin said . &quot; But I never came_out . My positions have never changed . . . . A lot of ultra-right-wing people supported me then . They ' re not now. &quot; * In Washoe County , home to Reno , the &quot; Biggest Little City in the World , &quot; people with HIV were allowed_in the classroom to talk_about the disease for the first time this school_year in a controversial program called Frontline . * In October , the Gay and Lesbian Community_Center of Southern Nevada opened in Las Vegas , the first such facility in the state . It offers a library , a speakers bureau , counseling for families of gay teen-agers , clubs for newcomers and seniors , and referrals for roommates , jobs and legal assistance . * Bushee told a group of gay activists this spring that if they would help form guidelines for the practice , his paper would publish same-sex unions on the wedding pages . Fewer than a dozen mainstream newspapers in the nation include such notices . * For the first time , gay voters are a presence in a major statewide election . Politically active gays and lesbians raised $ 5 # 000 for Jones in January in the first gay-sponsored benefit for a Nevada candidate . Since then , the gay community has held several fund-raisers on behalf of state legislators . &quot; We are all fighting over them in the governor ' s race , &quot; says Jones , who faces Miller in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in September . However -- and this is a big however -- being courted and being accepted are two vastly different things . For every first celebrated in Nevada , there is a caveat . For every step_forward , at least one step back : * Nevada has the ninth-highest AIDS rate in the country and has been in the top 10 since 1987 . It is in the bottom 10 for state spending on the disease . &quot; The only state support we get is indirectly through Medicaid , &quot; says Dr. Jerry Cade , a Las Vegas physician who treats AIDS patients . &quot; The rural counties are incredibly reluctant to help those big ' sin cities , ' Reno and Las Vegas , with their problems. &quot; * Although HIV-infected patients in the Frontline program can tell Washoe County students about life with the disease , they are not allowed to talk_about their sexual orientation . &quot; If ( speakers ) were asked point-blank if they were gay , they may say yes or no but that would be it , &quot; said Jan Donnelly , health education curriculum specialist for the Washoe County School District . * When the Gay and Lesbian Student_Union at the University of Nevada , Reno , started a youth outreach program a year ago , &quot; we agreed not to talk_about sex , &quot; says Leslie Fiske , one of the program ' s founders . The self-imposed prohibition was partly to avoid conflict with the university and partly in response to the anti-sodomy law , which was still in place . Nevada is &quot; still conservative in a lot of ways , still redneck , &quot; Fiske says . In Virginia City , the saga of Russ Collingwood underscores Nevada ' s split_personality . At least five businesses in this tiny Wild_West tourist destination are owned by gays or lesbians . &quot; This is the differentest town in the world , &quot; says one Chamber_of_Commerce board_member . &quot; Everyone ' s different. &quot; The population of fewer than 1 # 000 is &quot; a combination of a_few miners and a lot of_aging hippies who moved here after the ' 60s , &quot; says Martin Lane , co-publisher of the Comstock Chronicle . &quot; You have a lot of people who came here to be left alone. &quot; And for the most part , they are . But in January , when Collingwood , 25 , announced to the Chamber_of_Commerce board -- of which he was a member -- that he was planning a sex-change operation , he ended_up on the front page of the Chronicle and ultimately felt it necessary to leave the board . * For Collingwood , who now is known as Paige Sinclaire , life as an openly gay_man in Virginia City was fine ; life as a transsexual means learning to deal with whispers and odd looks , misunderstanding and cold_shoulders . Virginia City is not the best place , he admits , for a man to learn the ways of womanhood . Although he was not asked to leave the chamber board , Collingwood said he felt a not-so-subtle push_out the door . &quot; I don ' t believe there ' s been anyone like me in this town before , &quot; he says . Chances are , Collingwood is right . Nevada is home to only 1.4 million residents scattered unevenly throughout 110 # 000 square_miles -- or about half the population of Orange County in nearly 150 times the area . Its North and South are more drastically divided by attitude and geography than even those of California . The state is bisected by Interstate 50 , a.k.a. &quot; The Loneliest Road in America. &quot; Almost nothing exists_by way of civilization connecting the Las Vegas area to the south and the Reno / Sparks / Carson City area farther north . Prostitution is legal in most of the so-called &quot; cow counties &quot; or rural_areas of the state , although it is against the law in urban Clark and Washoe counties . You can play the slot_machines in the supermarket , video store or casino , buy a drink 24 hours a day . It is still only a misdemeanor to sell a gun to a child , although that could change . &quot; This is a frontier state , &quot; said Miller in early March , as he kicked_off his reelection bid with a Reno speech that suggested tougher penalties for those who sell guns to children under 18 . Professional boxing and quickie divorce found their first acceptance here in the early 1900s . Mary Pickford came_to Nevada in 1920 for the divorce that enabled her to marry Douglas Fairbanks ; a long parade of celebrity splits ensued , as the state dropped its waiting period from six months to three months to six weeks , and the moneyed set poured into Reno for sympathetic court hearings , dude_ranch vacations and new leases on life . To Robert Laxalt , novelist and Nevada historian , the state ' s psychic split provides little mystery . Though not conversant with the anti-gay petition drive , Laxalt contends that the state ' s early embrace of prizefighting , easy divorce laws , gambling and prostitution were born of economics . &quot; The millionaires who sacked the Comstock Lode around Virginia City packed up their moneybags and moved_on to greener pastures , and they left a Nevada that was dead broke , &quot; he says . &quot; that ' s why the state enacted liberal laws : to entice tourists here. &quot; To this day , Nevada residents boast of a western independence , a live-and-let-live attitude that embraces the Liberace Museum and the Boy-Lesque variety_show . &quot; Both ends of the state are much more liberally inclined than they used to be , &quot; says Rollan Melton , longtime columnist at the Reno Gazette-Journal . &quot; Because of the influx of Southern Californians , there is a more liberal feeling . We ' re joining the latter part of the 20th Century recently . We were very redneck , very bullheaded , and very conservative. &quot; Although Nevada is in the bottom 10 of states in population , it is the fastest growing in the nation . Three new hotel-casinos opened in Las Vegas last winter , bringing the city 15 # 000 new jobs . In 1993 , the state averaged about 6 # 000 new residents per month . And as the population on the whole grows , so does the gay community . In a recent edition of the bimonthly Las Vegas / Reno Bugle , nearly 10 % of the &quot; Manfinder Personals &quot; were from new gay residents , men who described themselves as &quot; New 2 Vegas &quot; and &quot; just moved here from S.F. , &quot; &quot; New Kid in Town &quot; and &quot; moving from SF to Vegas. &quot; This spring brought the state ' s first Stonewall Democratic Club , based in Reno , for gay_men and lesbians . Nevada already had a Log_Cabin Republican Club for gays . And the numbers of celebrants at Las Vegas ' annual Gay Pride festival grew from about 100 in the 1980s to 2 # 200 in 1993 . &quot; For Las Vegas , that ' s amazing , &quot; says Rob Schlegel , publisher of the Bugle and a former festival chairman . The influx of new Nevadans , both straight and gay , is in part responsible_for the state ' s changing views and the landmark repeal of the anti-sodomy law last June . &quot; What I think has happened over the years is that we have people from Los Angeles and Chicago and New York , really liberal people , moving here for the first time , &quot; said Judy Corbisiero , a longtime activist and co-director of Nevadans for Constitutional Equality , which fought for repeal of the anti-sodomy law . Until the late 1970s , the &quot; crimes against nature &quot; law was so vague that it did not define the acts it prohibited for homosexuals and heterosexuals alike , said state Sen . Lori Lipman Brown ( D-Las Vegas ) , architect of the law ' s repeal . In 1977 , the state_changed the law to enumerate the outlawed acts ; at_the_same_time , it made them illegal only for partners of the same sex . Although the law was repealed by large margins in both houses of the Nevada Legislature , lawmakers said that constituent calls ran largely in favor of keeping the controversial statute on the books . &quot; For every 10 phone_calls or letters that we received in my office from my district , one person was for the repeal and nine were against it , &quot; said Assemblyman John Bonaventura ( D-Las Vegas ) . Bonaventura , who displayed a &quot; No Rights for Sodomites &quot; bumper sticker on his desk during heated debate and testimony over the law , voted against repeal . It is just such opposition that the Nevada Citizens Alliance has hoped to tap with its drive to place the Minority Status and Child Protection Act_on the ballot . In part , the proposed amendment to the state Constitution says that &quot; objection to homosexuality based upon one ' s convictions is a liberty and right of conscience and shall not be considered discrimination relating to civil rights. &quot; Translation : Gay_men and lesbians could not be foster_parents , nor could they win custody of their children if the other parent in the dispute is heterosexual . Works by Oscar Wilde could be allowed_in public_libraries , but &quot; Heather Has Two Mommies &quot; could not . * Homosexuality could be acknowledged in public_school health or social studies classes but not in a way that would &quot; elevate homosexuality to a neutral or normal position in a child ' s eyes , &quot; Mabon said . Mabon says he has received hundreds of calls from Nevadans asking_for help in countering the growth of the state ' s gay community . He has come here a year earlier than planned because , &quot; from our standpoint , it is better to fight the battle sooner than later. &quot; Similar initiatives were voted on in November , 1992 , in Oregon and Colorado . The Oregon measure was defeated . The Colorado initiative was approved by voters but is being challenged in court . Mabon ' s group is continuing its efforts in Oregon , in addition to pushing initiatives in Washington , Idaho and Nevada . The Nevada initiative campaign is being run_out of makeshift offices in Daisy Stanley ' s Reno apartment . She got involved after calling her daughter , Kathy Phelps , in a panic in January when the anti-sodomy law was repealed . She faxed Phelps a copy of an article from the Reno Gazette-Journal . The headline : &quot; Nevada Gays Building New Political Power. &quot; Phelps lives in Eugene , Ore. , and works for Mabon . She shared the news with him . For Mabon , that was the last straw . &quot; When they saw that article , they said they gotta do what they gotta do , even if there isn ' t the money and all_the rest , &quot; Stanley says . A few weeks later , Mabon flew to Carson City , where the group filed to start the petition drive . He has visited the state several times since to stump for the initiative in the state ' s conservative circles . The Nevada Citizens Alliance needs just over 51 # 000 valid signatures by Tuesday to put the proposed initiative on the November ballot . As the group heads into its last weekend of signature gathering , its chances have dimmed some . Although alliance officials would not estimate the number of signatures that they have gathered , opponents believe that only about 15 # 000 have been garnered to date . &quot; It ' s not out_of_the_question that the signatures will pour in in this last week , &quot; Mabon said . &quot; If they do not collect the required number , they ' re going to refile . Then they ' ll have enough time , two years , and will get_on the ballot. &quot; Janine Hansen , president of the Nevada Family Eagle Forum and initiative proponent , views its chances as limited . Hansen too felt the repeal of the anti-sodomy law as a body blow to her cause ; her organization has mailed_out thousands of petitions to try to reverse what she sees as the march of the &quot; homosexual agenda. &quot; &quot; We don ' t want to hold homosexuality up as a standard for our children , &quot; said Hansen , who refers to such an orientation as a &quot; destructive , anti-family deathstyle. &quot; &quot; I want my children to know it ' s wrong and it ' s unnatural , &quot; she said . Still , the petition drive has lacked members , money and time , vital resources necessary for any sort of political work -- especially for lonely work such_as hers . &quot; But I ' ve never underestimated the power of the people , &quot; Hansen said . &quot; I believe that it will mushroom , and there is a possibility , an opportunity , for success. &quot; Reno activist Eddie Anderson is not so sure . He personally finds reason for optimism in the gay community ' s recent strides forward and the stumbling performance of the Nevada citizens alliance . &quot; While the conditions have not changed for gays and lesbians , the attitudes toward them have. &quot;</TEXT>
