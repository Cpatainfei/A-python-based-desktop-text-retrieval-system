   <HEADLINE> O.C. POP BEAT : DARK , SUBVERSIVE STUFF -- AND PUNK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Will punk_rock never cease ? Probably not in Orange County , where punk and its offshoots have been the lingua_franca of a musically loquacious underground since 1979 . Today ' s column of local album reviews consists mainly of punk records , and some pretty good ones at that . Veteran bands D.I. and Big Drill Car come_back with renewed vigor after so-so previous efforts , while four bands of spunky young-uns with a sense of local punk history team_up for a joint release called &quot; coast hwy. &quot; But the grandest punk of all_in this batch doesn ' t play the hard-and-fast stuff . Stanley Wycoff , auteur of Bierce in L.A. , favors tradition-steeped country_music . His new album ' s predilection for the dark side and willingness to outrage qualify him as a bona_fide eccentric and an artistic hard case . Any punk-rock tough would have to acknowledge him as a spiritual brother . Ratings range from * * * * ( excellent ) to * ( poor ) . Three stars denote a solid recommendation . - * * * 1 / 2 Pierce in L.A. &quot; Vale of Tears &quot; Rococo Records Bierce in L.A. is a studio assemblage presided over by Stanley Wycoff , a Long Beach-based singer-songwriter who identifies with Ambrose Bierce , the turn-of-the-century writer known chiefly for disappearing into Mexico without a trace , and for his horrific stories that displayed a markedly venomous attitude toward humanity . Given that namesake , one doesn ' t expect an album of sweetness_and_light . But &quot; Vale of Tears &quot; is even bleaker than that . Emerging from this 10-song journey through the depths of matrimonial hell , the luckier ones among us may breathe a relieved &quot; There but for the grace of God go I. &quot; Those unfortunate enough to recognize themselves in these songs deserve our deepest sympathies . Wycoff ' s corrosively witty story-songs have the truthful ring of portraits drawn directly from life . He is also an expressive singer in the creaky-voiced tradition of John Prine , Guy Clark , Gram Parsons and Keith Richards . When it comes_to finding classy help , he ' s the equal of any corporate headhunter . Among those in his revolving lineups are guitar virtuoso John Jorgenson , Dave Alvin , Nicky Hopkins ( yes , the Nicky Hopkins , piano_player to the ' 60s rock pantheon ) and O.C. roots-music heroes Chris Gaffney and Danny Ott . They ably provide a wide-ranging palette for such sprightly traditional forms as rocking country , honky-tonk and bluegrass -- upon which Wycoff can perversely foist lyrics full of disastrous consequence . &quot; Trailer_Park , &quot; in which Jorgenson switches to whoosh-treated saxophones , sounds like an outtake from a minimalist-modernist-avant-gardist experiment by Tom Waits , Captain Beefheart or Was ( Not Was ) . The album is a loosely unified collection of sketches . In some , decent but flawed people sacrifice not only happiness , but also a good chunk of their sanity . In others , such_as &quot; It ' s All Up to You &quot; and the bizarre &quot; Trailer_Park , &quot; Wycoff gets_into the minds of people you would n ' t want to know and visits places you would n ' t want to see . His monologue songs are richly but economically drawn , implying volumes more_than they actually tell . Together , they form the portrait of an oppressive and claustrophobic little world . Wycoff opens with &quot; Do Some Don ' ts , &quot; a cheerfully twanging country-rockabilly number punctuated with Jordanaires-style bop-shoo-wops . In it , a dissatisfied husband blithely heads out for a night of misbehavior . Soon , in &quot; Living With His Conscience ( Living With Her Fears ) , &quot; this protagonist will learn that the wages of extramarital sin can be a form of living_death . With Gaffney taking_over as a gravelly voiced surrogate on lead vocals , Wycoff laconically paints_a_picture of what happens to a marriage when the trust is sucked out of it following the husband ' s infidelity . And , oh , what a lonesome fate To be caught between love and hate She ' ll never leave , no she ' ll just wait For it ' ll work again , but it ' ll never work great At his most uncompromising , Wycoff explodes country-music pieties in a way deliberately calculated to offend the easily offended . The protagonist of &quot; Unobstructed Shot &quot; lays blame for the world ' s ills on religion ' s doorstep and fantasizes about drawing a bead on Jesus in a rifle ' s cross-hairs and vengefully nailing him for failure to abolish evil . But look beyond the sensationalism , and you ' ll find a memorable portrait of a mind barely able to cope_with a world of suffering . Two and two adds_up to four , that ' s Arabic addition But two and two came_out to five in the Spanish Inquisition And all that talk_about that seamless robe And all_the strength and the patience of Job Cannot explain how one child should ever have to call Calcutta home Wycoff resists melodrama , singing the role with understatement that only implies menace , leaving it to Jorgenson ' s barking guitar to make explicit the character ' s lacerated mental_state . &quot; It ' s All Up to You &quot; is a quieter , more subtle country cousin to one of John Cale ' s seething , mid- ' 70s proto-punk rants . Wycoff takes us into the mind of a truly evil wife abuser , but nastily tweaks the listener with writing so clever that the audience , at least , will enjoy the loathsome fellow as entertaining company . Yes , it ' s all up_to you to make this marriage work But if you don ' t start to do your part You know it ' s bound to hurt Well , Tammy sang , &quot; Stand_by Your Man &quot; And I believe each word is true And you can live to sing along , but it ' s all up_to you Wycoff ' s heart isn ' t so corroded that he can ' t muster a sense of sympathy for his characters ' awful lot . But &quot; Vale of Tears &quot; is one of the few pop works that truly deserves the much-bandied adjective &quot; subversive. &quot; If Garth Brooks or one of his mega-selling colleagues in the country mainstream ever covers &quot; It ' s All Up to You &quot; or &quot; Unobstructed Shot , &quot; I ' ll take_back every nasty thing I ' ve ever written_about the safe , staid , sugarcoating ways of the Nashville machine . That ' ll probably happen the day after Ambrose Bierce rides back from Mexico . ( Available from Rococo Records , P.O. Box 695 , Seal Beach , CA 90740 . ( 310 ) 594-6641. ) - * * * Big Drill Car &quot; No Worse for the Wear &quot; Headhunter / Cargo A new rhythm_section is in place , but improved song-architecture helps at least as much as the new blood to get Big Drill Car revving nicely again on its fourth studio release . After a promising start with the late- ' 80s recordings &quot; Small Block &quot; and &quot; Album Type Thing , &quot; BDC started spinning its wheels on material that was lean and crunchy , but not memorable . Mainstays Frank Daly and Mark Arnold haven ' t changed their basic approach , which involves pop-informed , sing-song melodies taken at racing tempos . But Arnold ' s ornery bucking bull of a guitar is channeled into more varied , less linear arrangements than in the past . He draws not just from punk_rock and Led Zeppelin , the main arsenal of previous albums , but from the exuberant riffing of such ' 70s arena-rock mainstays as Van Halen and Ted Nugent . Arnold finds an adept partner for high-velocity tag in new bassist Darren Morris , and drummer Keith Fallis lends an explosive kick ( he has since been replaced by Jamie Reidling , the former Cadillac Tramps drummer ) . Daly ' s singing has bite , but his slender , nasal voice has always sounded a little naked . that ' s true here , but stronger melodies avert the monotony that set_in on the band ' s 1991 release , &quot; Batch. &quot; Big Drill Car always has recorded for small , independent labels , working with longtime buddies from the band All as producers . If BDC ever finds itself in the money , it might consider double-tracking Daly ' s voice to thicken his sound . Most of the songs have an urgent , desperate cast as Daly sorts through relationship crises in &quot; Friend of Mine , &quot; &quot; Hye &quot; and &quot; Step Right Up. &quot; In each case , it looks as if the narrator and his friend or lover won ' t be able to hold their bond together , but an affirmative , striving tone prevails . For BDC , embracing vivid experience appears to be its own reward , even if happiness remains out_of_reach . For contrast , Daly waxes sardonic or wrathful on &quot; Nagaina , &quot; &quot; Crystal ' s Ball &quot; ( a rare slower song ) and &quot; Yer Holdin , &quot; with two-timing sex-aholics and drug_addicts among the objects of scorn or shrugging pity . Big Drill Car still rolls_down a relatively narrow stylistic track , but after stalling through the early ' 90s , it ' s fun to hear the band writing songs that go places .

' s singer and co-founder , Casey Royer , carries himself well in the role of older-brother figure to a new generation of teens drawn to the band ' s ever-reliable thrashing , hard-cranking , hard-core punk . Innovation isn ' t part of the equation . On its seventh album since 1982 , D.I. sticks_to the old hard-and-fast , mosh-ready beats , and to the zooming , massed guitar onslaughts and catchy , shout-along choruses that were the essence of Royer ' s previous band , the Adolescents . Royer ' s main subject is survival . As one roiling song puts it , the world is a &quot; Clownhouse &quot; of evils and absurdities that will tax your sanity . Royer ' s advice is to watch your back and persevere . D.I. ' s clenched , stormy onslaught makes_it clear that it won ' t be possible without determined , desperate effort . The band sounds recharged after a poorly focused outing on its last studio release five years ago . Royer ' s vocal style suits his big-brother stance . He doesn ' t go_in for screaming , titanic drama . Instead , he delivers his cogent , if less-than-poetic lyrics in a clean , earthy Everyman ' s voice . Behind him , the band provides the dramatics with hard-charging , well-etched playing and hefty backup singing . Some of the dark humor that cropped_up in D.I. ' s earlier work comes_through in &quot; Better Than Expected , &quot; in which a woman ' s ignorance of the seedy and dangerous side of life proves fatal when she goes_on a barhopping fling . &quot; Colors and Blood &quot; is an embattled anthem bewailing the gang mentality : &quot; When you live like there ' s no rules / Makes_it like any day ' s a good_day for dying. &quot; In &quot; Martyr Man , &quot; Royer registers a mixture of admiration and bewilderment as he wonders what meaning can be gleaned from the death of an idealistic but foolhardy punk-rock hero . Tellingly , it leads into an album-closing cover of &quot; Lexicon Devil , &quot; a punk-rebellion anthem originally sung by the ill-fated Germs singer , Darby Crash . Still vigorous at 35 , Royer shows that , even for an inveterate and unchanging punk , there is a livable middle way between Neil Young ' s dreaded rust and a premature crash-and-burn . It ' s not a bad example for a big_brother to set for a new generation of punk_rock youth . ( Available from Doctor Dream Records , 841 W . Collins Ave. , Orange , CA 92667. ) - * * 1 / 2 Peace Corp. , Just Plain Big , the Scenes and Hard Fast &amp; Loud &quot; coast hwy &quot; NoLA Recordings The first album-length punk salvo out of Orange County 15 years ago was the &quot; Beach Blvd &quot; compilation featuring the Crowd , Rik L Rik and the Simpletones . Now a new generation of O.C. bands pays homage to their local roots with the title , concept and , in some instances , the musical styles of this new punk compilation . Nice idea : Each band gets_about 17 or 18 minutes , the length of an EP , while splitting the cost . All show promise , although Hard Fast &amp; Loud hews too closely to old-line hard-core and winds_up serving_up familiar , resentful rants and music that ' s little more_than functional , if crisply played , mosh-pit soundtrack fodder . Newport Beach-based Just Plain Big is the most impressive of the coasters . Its trademarks are racing tempos , pop-flavored melodies , buzzing fuzz-tone guitars and two lead voices that move_in unison or in tandem harmonies , adding_up to more_than the sum of the two parts . The Crowd seems to be an influence on the straight-ahead punk tune &quot; Modern Persuasion , &quot; while some ' 60s garage-psychedelic strains ( the Doors and Love are possible influences ) emerge on JPB ' s best and most controlled track , the darkly trippy &quot; A Ride. &quot; Peace Corp . is brash , snotty , deliberately obnoxious and proud_of it . The Newport Beach band targets religion ( the song title , &quot; God Is Dead ( I ' m Taking Over ) &quot; says it all ) , resurgent Nazism in Germany ( they recommend nuking the whole country before it gets_out of hand again ) , and musical trends ( &quot; What the hell is wrong with Seattle ? The sound is ( expletive ) , the bands are cattle &quot; ) . Their best song , &quot; Jacqui-O , &quot; has shades of Redd Kross in its brawny punk-pop merger . In it , Peace Corp . sings with deliberate insensitivity about the dangers of anorexia . Unless they ' re talking_about some_other Jacqui-O we don ' t know , they somehow got_it in their heads to appoint the late Mrs . Onassis as a poster child for eating disorders . Terminal cancer doesn ' t do wonders for anybody ' s appetite , so perhaps a change of title would be a good idea . Candy-O worked fine for the Cars . In short , Peace Corp . come_off like louts , but if your sensibilities aren ' t too delicate , they ' re kind of fun as they work punk-comedy turf previously occupied hereabouts by the Vandals . The Scenes go halfway down the same road on a_couple_of deliberately dopey but zestful garage-rock songs , &quot; It Suits Me Well &quot; and &quot; Lime in My Beer. &quot; Then they do an about-face and turn_into some kind of smarmy , so-sincere , post U2 Brit-rock band ( &quot; Painting Pictures &quot; ) or a high-minded Neil Young knockoff ( &quot; Orange Pos &quot; ) . It ' s always fun hearing bands on the ground_floor who give at least a hint of character ; one never knows what turns they ' ll take . Someday we may look_back again at &quot; coast hwy &quot; as the start of something bigger ( five years ago , on its debut album , O.C. punk ' s most successful progeny , the Offspring , was somewhere near the level heard here ) . Or maybe it will just be one more small artifact proving that when kids in fin de siecle Orange County thrashed around looking_for something to do , a lot of them hit on the idea of playing punk_rock .
