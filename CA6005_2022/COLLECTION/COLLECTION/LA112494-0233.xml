   <HEADLINE> VALIDITY OF DNA TESTING UPHELD IN ASSAULT CASE ; COURTS : IN PRECEDENT SETTING DECISION INVOLVING CONVICTION OF WESTMINSTER MAN , JURISTS RULE GENETIC FINGERPRINTING IS ' HIGHLY RELIABLE AND RELEVANT. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a decision that could have a statewide impact on the admissibility of DNA test results in criminal and civil courts , the state ' s 4th District Court of Appeal upheld the attempted rape_conviction of a Westminster gardener that was based almost entirely on DNA testing . The court ruled Tuesday genetic fingerprinting had gained sufficient credibility in the scientific community that it should now be considered &quot; highly reliable and relevant. &quot; In making their decision , the jurists rejected the arguments of a defense_attorney for Frank Lee Soto , 34 . The attorney had argued that the method that was used to calculate the probability of a DNA match in the Soto case is still being debated by scientists and so should not have been admitted as evidence . But the jurists argued in their decision that the method used in Soto ' s case , the one most commonly used by California laboratories , is now accepted by most geneticists . &quot; To allow a ' minor academic debate . . . to snowball to_the_point that it threatens to undermine the use of it in court ' is throwing the baby out with the bath_water , &quot; the jurists wrote . &quot; Soto ( argues that ) the mere existence of ' two sides ' in the scientific discussion means the whole subject must be excluded . We cannot agree ; if that were literally true , no scientific evidence could ever be admitted. &quot; Soto was sentenced to three years in state_prison by Orange County Superior_Court Judge Jean H . Rheinheimer for the attempted rape of a 79-year-old woman who lived_in a mobile_home next to him . The woman told police a masked man with a knife forced his way into her home and assaulted her in her bedroom . She suffered a stroke after the attack and was unable to testify at the trial . There were no other witnesses to the assault . Authorities said DNA ( deoxyribonucleic_acid ) taken from semen found on her bedspread matched that of Soto , a point that was debated at length during the criminal trial and before the appellate_court . DNA is found in blood , semen and tissue , and it carries a person ' s unique genetic coding . Genetic fingerprinting has also been used to determine paternity . During Soto ' s trial , prosecutors called_on experts who testified that the chance of anyone else but Soto being the source of the DNA evidence was one in 189 million . But defense_attorneys called three other scientists who gave a range from one in 71 to one in 39 # 000 based on another method of calculating the probability of a DNA match . Soto ' s defense_attorney Richard Schwartzberg argued that given the lack of agreement over the calculations , the DNA evidence should not have been admissible . Schwartzberg said the ruling is troubling because it means that someone like his client , who has always maintained his innocence , can be sent to prison on the basis of one disputed piece of evidence . &quot; This will be too powerful for juries , &quot; Schwartzberg said . &quot; We as a society have become too technology-oriented . It ' s to_the_point where if scientists tell a jury that black is white , there ' s a good chance they ' ll believe them. &quot; He said he plans to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court . Supervising Deputy Atty . Gen . Frederick R . Millar Jr . challenged the notion that the ruling did anything other_than give prosecutors a guaranteed opportunity to introduce legitimate evidence that up until now could be excluded by judges . &quot; This is not scary evidence , &quot; Millar said . &quot; It provides valid evidence to establish guilt . There is not a risk here of an innocent person being falsely convicted. &quot; Before this latest ruling , trial_judges around the state have been deciding on a case-by-case basis whether to allow DNA test results into evidence and what kinds of probability calculations were acceptable . In most cases trial_judges had accepted DNA evidence , though not in all , Millar said . The attorneys disagreed about the potential impact of the appeals court ruling on California ' s lower courts . Although they acknowledged that the ruling creates a legal precedent , they disagreed on whether lower court judges are bound by the ruling . Millar said that the recent ruling overrides a 1992 1st District Court of Appeal decision that DNA test results should not be admissible in court . That ruling had followed a 1991 2nd District Court of Appeal ruling that had said the opposite -- that DNA testing was acceptable as evidence in court . The ruling in the Soto case is based on the very latest scientific evidence , and should have the force of law statewide , Millar said . &quot; Until and unless another appellate_court comes_along with new scientific evidence , the Soto case should be binding , &quot; he said . But Schwartzberg said judges can still choose between the different appellate_court decisions on DNA that have been handed_down since 1991 . Only a state Supreme Court decision , he said , will settle the_matter . The attorney will file a petition with the state Supreme Court to hear the case by mid-January .</TEXT>
