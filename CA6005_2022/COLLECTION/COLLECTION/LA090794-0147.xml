   <TEXT> It will rise from a lake formed by the waters of the immortal Tigris_River , a huge , white dome suspended among eight rocket-like minarets . To be built_on one of the airports bombed by the United States during the Persian_Gulf_War , it looks_like a floating space_station . Its destination : paradise . &quot; Yesterday , we flew out of this airport to visit the world in jet_planes . Tomorrow , we will fly from this place on a journey the modern jet cannot reach . It is a journey of the soul to its creator , &quot; say the architects of &quot; A Mosque That Floats On Water , &quot; envisioned as the largest mosque on Earth and Saddam Hussein ' s rocket ship to destiny . The Iraqi president drew the design himself and two months ago imposed a ban on private building , to free materials for the imminent seven-year construction of the mosque and other government projects . In Iraq , struggling under the most severe international economic sanctions in modern history -- sanctions whose bite after four years is beginning to draw blood -- a grand new mosque would seem an odd investment in a future well beyond the reach of United Nations resolutions . Yet Baghdad ' s message to the world these days -- as its envoys jet around the globe offering compromise , cooperation and even the unusual prospect of Iraq joining the Middle_East peace process with Israel -- comes_with a subtle reminder . The Iraqi president , who has outlasted an American president ( children play hopscotch on George_Bush ' s grimacing tile face on the floor of the Rashid Hotel ) , a British prime_minister and countless other allied leaders , may be demolishing his missiles and drawing_in his belt , but he still has the God card -- and the world ' s second-largest oil reserves . All over the Iraqi capital , billboards portray the president in full military dress , kneeling on a prayer_rug with his hands raised in supplication . Government television breaks for prayers five times a day and features long lectures by religious sheiks . In recent weeks , public alcohol sales have been banned , and the government has implemented strict Islamic punishments -- for thieves sentences range from hand amputations to death for repeat offenders -- specified in the holy Koran . The moral is only too clear : Lift the embargo and Iraq is more ready to be a player than at any time since its disastrous invasion of Kuwait four years ago . Leave it and risk pushing Iraq , for years a wall against the march of radical Islam from neighboring Iran , into the arms of Muslim fundamentalism . It is a carefully calculated strategy in a country where the rise of any opposition , religious or secular , is quickly quashed . But for the first time , and perhaps for reasons of its own , the world seems ready to listen . Trade delegations -- from France , Canada , Britain , Switzerland , Italy , Germany , Brazil , Austria , Turkey , Asia , all_over the world -- are flooding into Baghdad at the rate of two a month . Even U.S. companies , banned by American law from any business dealings in Baghdad , are sending feelers , drawn by the lure of multibillion-dollar deals Iraq is offering for signature now to those who support lifting the sanctions . The memoranda of agreement , some of which are worth $ 1 billion each , according to the Iraqi trade minister , will bind Iraq to signing contracts once the sanctions are lifted . U.S. companies , he said , are bidding for a share of Iraqi business through European or Middle Eastern branches to get_around the U.S. trade ban . Late last month , Jordan and Turkey joined in a public call_for immediate lifting of the embargo -- whose effects have ravaged their own economies -- and France , China and Russia , a majority of the permanent members of the U.N. Security_Council , are leaning toward a review of Iraq ' s case . Then , Turkey quietly reopened its border with northern Iraq . &quot; One day or another , these sanctions will go , &quot; Iraq ' s information minister , Hamad Youssef Hammadi , said in an interview . &quot; Because there is a lot of pressure now on the American Administration . The American Administration does not want to admit failure , but it is cornered. &quot; Iraq , whose senior diplomats have spent the last several weeks on a whirlwind tour of Arab , European and Asian capitals , has emerged confident that the back of the embargo will be broken by spring : if not by Security_Council action , then by simple non-observance , like water pouring over a shaky dam . &quot; Even if it comes_to the worst case , a vote_in the Security_Council , and the U.S. uses the veto , the others will not comply . Politically , maybe . But not technically , &quot; Hammadi said . &quot; If the U.S. uses the veto , the_British or the_French or the Russians will say , ' This embargo is not a council action , it is an American action. ' They will deal with Iraq , even if there is an American boycott. &quot; The United States has repeatedly expressed opposition to any easing of the sanctions , noting that Iraq still has not accepted its border with Kuwait , nor has it eased its human_rights violations , especially against Shiite Muslims in the south , who are seeing their villages burned and their leaders arrested in a government campaign to wipe_out the opposition . Moreover , U.S. officials ask why the sanctions should be lifted just when they are beginning to work . America ' s ambassador to the U.N. , Madeleine Albright , has repeatedly expressed fears that Iraq will simply resume its building of illegal weapons once the embargo is lifted . But with the sudden rush of international economic interest in Iraq , it is hard to find anyone outside the United States and Britain , which has supported the U.S. stand though somewhat less enthusiastically , who seriously disagrees_with Iraq ' s upbeat expectations . &quot; Saddam now , even though his circles are drawn_in much closer and tighter , is probably more secure than he ' s been in the last three years , &quot; said one Western diplomat . &quot; These sanctions tend to be more and more of an American policy . They ' re a knee-jerk reaction where it makes_it look_to the domestic constituency like Washington is doing something , but they really don ' t achieve their intended purpose . . . . There ' s no way you can keep_down for long a country of 18 million people with the second-largest oil reserves on Earth. &quot; Yet for all its bravado , Baghdad is a wounded capital . And the rest of the country is even worse . The planning minister was fired recently after he officially estimated annual inflation at 24 # 000 % , but the reality is that the Iraqi_dinar only four years ago bought $ 3 . Now , $ 1 is worth more_than 600 dinars , and about 7 million Baghdadis who live_on fixed incomes are trying to make_it on their old salaries . A typical schoolteacher can buy two chickens with his or her monthly earnings . An engineer can buy a tray of 30 eggs and have 25 dinars left over . The government has kept the country alive by offering a ration package of rice , flour , oil , sugar , tea , soap , toothpaste , baby formula , razor blades and matches to every family for next to nothing . But beyond this subsistence , life becomes impossible for all but the rich who can buy on the black_market . Farmers , disgusted with low government price_supports , quit growing tomatoes ; they disappeared from the market until two weeks ago , when subsidies were raised . So did potatoes . Cucumbers are a rare delicacy except in well-to-do homes and luxury hotels , where for $ 200 a night , foreign guests must plead for toilet_paper , sugar and milk for tea ( poured_out grudgingly and then snatched away ) . Butter ? No . The vinaigrette the menu advertises with the seasonal salad ? No . Tomatoes for the salad ? No . Aspirin ? Sorry . A telephone_call to neighboring Jordan ? Possibly tomorrow . To Egypt ? No . Officially , the international sanctions allow food and medicine to be shipped freely into Iraq . Yet with billions of dollars frozen in overseas bank_accounts and no way of selling its oil , the government says it doesn ' t have enough money to buy_food and medicine . The ration program alone is costing about $ 1 billion a year . Foreign diplomats say Iraq undoubtedly has billions of dollars in hidden assets it could still tap , but even those , many say , appear to be draining -- or the government is simply choosing not to spend them . Either way , life in Baghdad is a depressing grind for almost everyone . The Friday morning flea_market downtown has stretched to cover an entire street and two adjacent thoroughfares . Old trousers , china dug_out from the dining_room , mixers , sunglasses and old telephones cover the makeshift stalls -- anything anybody found in a closet to help buy_food for the next month . Hadija Jamaam sits grimly on the sidewalk , leaning_on the family television_set . It is the only thing the family has to sell . &quot; I don ' t have any money . If I had money , I would n ' t sell my TV_set , &quot; she says . &quot; I have eight children ; what can we do ? We eat tomatoes ( when they are available ) and bread . Please , can ' t someone break these sanctions and tell people that we are suffering ? &quot; But then she sighs . &quot; God will help , &quot; she predicts . &quot; God will never leave his Muslim believers in such a situation for long. &quot; At the Qadissiyah Hospital in Saddam City -- a suburb to which many residents fled after two wars in Basra -- 10-year-old Rana Naji lies on a dirty bed in the emergency_room , her eyes rolled back into her head . She has been unconscious for more_than a day , and her mother sits hunched on the floor beside her bed . &quot; She was eating lunch yesterday and fainted for no reason . She hasn ' t woken_up since , &quot; said the woman , Sadia Kata . &quot; She was eating rice and salt , nothing more . The doctors have seen her and think there is blood_poisoning , but there is no medicine. &quot; Iraqi officials estimate that the child mortality_rate has quadrupled since the sanctions began in August , 1990 , with about 400 # 000 children dead of malnutrition and disease . An estimated 12 # 300 Iraqis have died in the past two months as a result of food and medicine shortages , including 9 # 434 children younger than 5 who were victims of diarrhea , pneumonia and malnutrition-related diseases , according to a Health Ministry report issued last month . There is no way of verifying the government ' s claims , but a visit to the Qadissiyah Hospital pharmacy is telling . Its entire stock on a recent day consisted_of a plastic tray divided into sections , several of them empty . Today , there is medicine for nausea and treatment of dust allergies and a_few other ailments . There are two vials of hydrocortisone . There is no medicine for other allergies , asthma , diarrhea or nerves . ( The Valium disappears fast ) . There are no antibiotics . &quot; Daily we face many difficulties in our duties toward the patient , from the door of the hospital to this room , and day after day , the difficulties increase , &quot; said Dr. Nassir Zubaydi , head of the cardiac care unit . &quot; If you look_at the charts for any of these patients , you will see a prescription and the notation , ' Drug is absent. ' We force ourselves to change the types of medication , and instead of using the best or the second_best , we use the fourth or the fifth best . The site of humanity is the hospital , but we find ourselves in a position to do nothing for them , and finally we discharge them to die. &quot; The city is becoming more dangerous . The crime_rate has doubled since the end of the Gulf War , and not only among the populace . The government recently had to rein_in the secret_police , who were conducting random house searches and seizing whatever caught their fancy . Police and officials of the ruling Baath Party were visiting shop owners , seeking protection money . New punishments under Islamic law imposing death on repeat robbers have encouraged some thieves to simply slaughter all witnesses . &quot; A few months ago , something started happening we couldn ' t understand , &quot; said a young Baghdad mother . &quot; A child , anywhere from 3 to 6 , would be kidnaped , and then someone would call and say , ' If you want your child back , bring 10 # 000 dinars to this place. ' They would go_to the place with the money , and they would find only a bag , with a string on top . Inside it would be the child ' s head , his legs , his arms . This happened three or four times. &quot; The kidnapers didn ' t show_up for the money ? &quot; No , &quot; she said , shaking her head . Why not ? She shrugged . In times like these , is it any wonder that more people are going_to the mosques ? That more women are wearing Islamic head scarves ? That fundamentalist groups such_as the Shiite Al Dawaa , and even a_few Saudi-sponsored Wahabi Islamic groups , are again being heard from ? The government ' s overwhelmingly pious response over the past two months is officially designated the National Religious_Belief Campaign . Privately , officials admit that its basics -- banning public consumption of alcohol , adopting Sharia ( Islamic law ) punishments ( four thieving hands were amputated in the past month ) , displaying Hussein in various postures of worship , the Grand State Mosque -- are intended to nip in the bud any wave of Islamic fundamentalism . &quot; The National Religious_Belief Campaign concentrates_on the main concepts of religious_belief , but not on the fundamentalism . This has made both sects ( of Iraqi Muslims ) surprised , because they cannot understand this campaign , which concentrates not on the political concepts , but on the concepts of belief , &quot; said a senior Iraqi official . But analysts here believe the new religious campaign is very much political and that its audience is as much the international community as the Muslims of Baghdad . &quot; They ' re using it both as propaganda and leverage , &quot; said one foreign diplomat . &quot; See what sanctions are doing to us ? We are coming closer and closer to fundamentalism . Cornering us , you will achieve another Iran. &quot; The Speaker of Iraq ' s Parliament , Saadi Mahdi Saleh , said encouraging religion in Iraq is a way of feeding the public ' s patience and readiness for sacrifice . &quot; Hard or difficult circumstances make man seek God ' s help , &quot; he said . &quot; You in the West are driving the region toward this kind of practice , because when unjust pressure is put upon societies , those societies cannot answer back the way they would like to , and then they will go_to God and pray . When unjust pressure comes , religion becomes stronger , and as a conclusion it would end_up declaring jihad against those who are practicing these unjust deeds. &quot; Murphy was recently on assignment in Baghdad .</TEXT>
