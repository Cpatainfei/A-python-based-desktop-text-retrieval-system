   <HEADLINE> A FUSION OF NUCLEAR FACTIONS ; GOVERNMENT : U.S. ENERGY_SECRETARY SPONSORS MEETING OF SCIENTISTS AND ADVERSARIES IN CAMPAIGN FOR OPENNESS . SHE IS ADVOCATING RELEASE OF COLD_WAR DATA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The scene Tuesday morning was a sign of the changing times : As Edward Teller , the father of the hydrogen_bomb , watched , the nation ' s top energy official walked over and hugged an anti-nuclear activist . For Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary , who has shaken the nation by releasing details of secret radiation experiments on unknowing subjects , it was a moment that symbolized her effort to bring a &quot; culture of openness &quot; to government . O ' Leary , going_on the road with her campaign to declassify the secrets of the Cold_War , convened the unprecedented meeting Tuesday of leading nuclear scientists and longtime nuclear opponents . O ' Leary asked_for support from , among others , a Catholic priest who has been arrested 35 times for protesting nuclear research at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory . She expressed her sympathy to a victim of government radiation poisoning , saying : &quot; In so many ways we are all victims . We are also victims of our mistrust of one another. &quot; And responding to a request from anti-nuclear activists , the secretary said she would immediately ban the shredding of any classified documents while the search is under way for additional evidence of improper radiation testing . The meeting in downtown San Francisco was the first of at least three public forums designed to help the Department_of_Energy shape its policy for declassifying about 32 million pages of documents on nuclear research . In addition to documents on human experiments and nuclear testing , the department is attempting to declassify information on annual plutonium production rates , the size of the nuclear arsenal and hundreds of other sensitive issues . Privately , Energy_Department officials hope the forums will help generate public support for declassification and neutralize opposition from an entrenched bureaucracy within the department that resists opening its files . &quot; Some have said this is a PR effort , &quot; O ' Leary said . &quot; It ' s not . This is about our future . It ' s about the survival of a nation . It ' s about the survival of our children. &quot; Among the scientists who spoke at Tuesday ' s forum were the 85-year-old Teller -- who helped persuade President Ronald Reagan to push_forward with the Star Wars defense_program -- and officials from Stanford Linear Accelerator and the Lawrence Livermore lab , one of the nation ' s two nuclear_weapons research facilities . Most of the scientists were supportive of the idea of declassification , saying it would aid industrial growth , energy development and the negotiation of arms limitation treaties with other nations . But Teller , who was an early advocate of reduced secrecy in nuclear affairs , cautioned that recent reports about Cold_War experiments on unknowing victims have overstated the harm that was done . &quot; I think that human experiments without the consent of the people is wrong , &quot; he said . &quot; I also believe that the actual damage that has been done has been grossly exaggerated. &quot; After more_than a decade of criticizing the government from the outside , anti-nuclear activists were surprised to find themselves in the same room with Teller -- their archenemy -- and other nuclear experts . At one point , activist Anne Herbert noted that she wrote the widely circulated slogan , &quot; Practice random acts of kindness and senseless beauty &quot; and praised O ' Leary ' s campaign for government openness . &quot; I can ' t believe being inspired by the person who is in_charge of Los Alamos ( nuclear_weapons research facility ) , &quot; Herbert said . O ' Leary , who was standing a_few feet away , came_over and gave her a hug saying , &quot; Can I give you a random act of kindness ? &quot; Although they say they are impressed with O ' Leary and are pleased to be courted , some opponents of nuclear_weapons remained skeptical that the secretary can overcome the Energy_Department ' s bureaucracy and nearly 50 years of entrenched secrecy . &quot; I hope she can do_it , &quot; said Jackie Cabasso of the Western States Legal Foundation . &quot; But I hold_on to a healthy dose of skepticism. &quot;</TEXT>
