   <HEADLINE> HUGE PERFORMING ARTS CENTER PROPOSED FOR SANTA ANA ; CONSTRUCTION : THE 5 # 500-SEAT THEATER WOULD BE COUNTY ' S LARGEST . DEVELOPERS ALSO ENVISION 180-ROOM HOTEL TO BE BUILT LATER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A development firm has proposed building a hotel and performing arts center -- the biggest in Orange County -- next to the MainPlace mall in north Santa Ana , city officials said Monday . With 5 # 500 seats , the enclosed theater would hold about 2 # 500 more people than the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa . Developers Moss &amp; Co . of Santa Monica also want to build an 8- to 10-story , 180-room hotel on the 3.47-acre site , but not for an additional seven to 10 years . &quot; There ' s no market for a hotel there now , &quot; said John Killen , agent for Moss &amp; Co . He said he could not estimate how much the total project would cost because plans are still in flux . City officials said the developers haven ' t decided what kind of events to hold at the proposed center because a management company hasn ' t been chosen yet . According to planners , the project , proposed near the intersection of Main_Street and Owens Drive , is in a preliminary stage . At a Feb . 10 meeting , area residents and property_owners may suggest problems that should be studied in an environmental impact report . Development plans probably won ' t go before the City_Council for up_to a year . Tanya Thomas , MainPlace / Santa Ana general_manager , opposes the existing plan , fearing that people attending concerts will park cars in spaces belonging_to the mall . Developers propose a 392-car parking structure at the center , and plans call_for most of the concert patrons to park at office_buildings away from the site and take shuttles to the theater . However , said Thomas , &quot; we believe theatergoers are going_to park wherever it ' s most convenient. &quot; Killen said the developers have an alternate plan that may include buying other nearby property to provide parking within walking distance of the venue . Robyn Uptegraff , executive_director of the city ' s Planning and Building_Department , called the project concept &quot; exciting &quot; but said MainPlace is a &quot; cornerstone of the city ' s commercial_activity ( and ) we want to ensure no project negatively impacts it. &quot; Main_Street north of MainPlace is being widened to accommodate more traffic , Uptegraff said , but officials who planned the widening only took_into_account traffic_patterns from current and future MainPlace stores and a project planned on the eastern side of Main -- not the concert_hall and hotel . Moss &amp; Co . representatives have met with neighborhood associations to discuss concerns . &quot; The development could be of huge benefit to the area , &quot; said John Zarian , president of the West Floral Park Neighborhood Assn . &quot; But everyone wants to go_into it with their eyes open. &quot; A concert_hall would be the latest addition to Santa Ana ' s effort to become the county ' s urban and cultural hub . The city ' s museum district , with the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art and a planned children ' s museum at its heart , lies to the south . And last year , the City_Council approved the Main_Street Concourse , a $ 500-million development proposed on the eastern side of Main_Street . That project would include the county ' s tallest office tower , townhomes , stores , a live theater and movie_theater . Construction has not begun yet . Santa Ana ' s proposed concert_hall may feel stiff competition from other facilities . Whether the area can support another performing arts venue depends_on what ' s presented there , said Victor Gotesman , general_manager of the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts . The new hall could succeed if it stages programs that don ' t duplicate presentations at other nearby sites , said Gotesman . &quot; This is a vast marketplace and there are certainly enough people to support the venues here now , if everyone develops their own particular niche , &quot; Gotesman said . &quot; It ' s certainly worth a shot if the programming were developed carefully in conjunction with what the community needs were. &quot; The Cerritos center ' s annual operating_budget is about $ 7.8 million , and it receives about $ 2 million of that from the city of Cerritos . Killen said Moss &amp; Co . have not asked the city to subsidize their proposed hall .</TEXT>
