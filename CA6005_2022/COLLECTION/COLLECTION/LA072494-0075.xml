   <TEXT> On a sunny Sunday , flat-bottomed punts glide through the lily ponds of Dal Lake , rippling the reflection of snowy mountains in the silent water . Young_men play a raucous soccer game in a lakeside park . For a moment , Kashmir looks_like what it once was : a peaceful land of natural splendor , a serene retreat for the wealthy from the heat of the Indian plain . But normality in Kashmir is an illusion . Insurgency , brutality and fear are the realities . In 1990 , bloodshed erupted with the ferocity of holy war in this Himalayan valley of apple orchards and rice_paddies . Muslim militants rebelled against four decades of what they described as corrupt and arrogant rule by India , a predominantly Hindu country . Islamic Pakistan , which bases its own claim to Kashmir on the valley ' s Muslim majority , supported the revolt . India , a patchwork of ethnic_groups with their own aspirations , poured soldiers into the region , fearing the loss of its state of Jammu-Kashmir would be the first_step toward disintegration . Today , half a_million Indian soldiers are in the state to defend an increasingly hostile frontier with Pakistan and contain a population that grows ever more embittered . Two of the wars India and Pakistan have fought since independence in 1947 were over Kashmir . Since the rebellion began , Jammu-Kashmir has become a drain on India ' s economy and a stain on its reputation as a democratic nation with respect for human_rights . Javed Ahmed Lone , 16 , lies_in a hospital in Sopore , 30 miles north of Srinagar , his thighs swollen and discolored by yellow and black bruises . &quot; They put a heavy roller across his legs and rolled it back and forth with the weight of two men on it , &quot; Dr. Sofi Farooq said . &quot; When the local police brought him here , he was in deep shock . It was difficult to revive him . . . . He was almost dead. &quot; Lone had been dragged_out of his school three hours earlier by Indian paramilitary troops and accused of links with separatist guerrillas . Muslim militants show equal disrespect for human values . Grenade attacks on Indian patrols often kill or wound as_many Kashmiris as Indians . Kashmiris suspected of collaboration with the Indians are murdered gangland-style . In 1990 , about 200 # 000 Hindus fled the Kashmir valley because of Muslim terrorists . That process is being repeated now in the southern part of Jammu-Kashmir as Muslim militants move_into new areas . Roughly two-thirds of the state ' s 6 million people are Muslims , and most want either independence or union with Pakistan . But some , weary of the bloodletting , privately acknowledge that they feel caught between trigger-happy Indian soldiers and militants who demand loyalty and often money . Resentment of the militants was expressed openly after a popular Muslim preacher , Qazi Nissar Ahmed , was killed June 20 , apparently for criticizing them . Tens of thousands of mourners gathered_in the town of Anantnag , many shouting slogans against Pakistan and the insurgents . Under threat of sanctions from the United States , Pakistan has stopped openly supporting the rebellion with men and weapons . When winter thaws to spring and mountain_passes reopen to illicit traffic with Pakistan , however , the daily death toll climbs to a dozen or more . India says 9 # 300 people have been killed in the rebellion , but the true number may be much higher . Since August , 1992 , more_than 600 people have been executed without trial by security_forces after being taken into custody , said Mian Abdul Qayoom , president of the Kashmir Bar Assn . At least 500 more are missing . Srinagar , an old town of wood and brick buildings beside the muddy Jhelum River , looks_like a military garrison . Paramilitary police in flak jackets and helmets stand like the slats of a picket_fence along the streets . Sandbagged bunkers obstruct busy intersections . Burned-out buildings scar Lal Chowk , the main square . At dusk , the city dies , except for the crackle of gunfire when Muslim militants taunt the security_forces . &quot; India can never win_back the Kashmiris , not even after 1 # 000 years , &quot; said Khawaja Sunaulah Butt , editor of Aftab , the state ' s largest-circulation daily newspaper . &quot; The Kashmiris may compromise with India , but not from the heart , &quot; said the 72-year-old editor , who opposed the uprising when it began . &quot; In their hearts , the Kashmiris hate India. &quot; The roots of the conflict are in the division of Britain ' s colony on the subcontinent into India and Pakistan after World_War_II . India says Kashmir is inseparable from it , citing the 1947 accession by Kashmir ' s Hindu king after India rescued him from an invasion of Muslim tribesmen . Pakistan supports a U.N. resolution passed in 1949 , after the first India-Pakistan war , proposing a referendum in which Kashmiris could choose between India and Pakistan . Many Kashmiris feel equally uncomfortable with India , where Hindu nationalism is becoming more strident , and Pakistan , which practices a sterner form of Islam than the tolerant Sufism that came_to the valley in the 14th Century . Indian and Western military_officers say the ground war has changed in recent months . India ' s army has flushed militants from urban strongholds and regained control of the cities . Guerrillas who once manned barricades in Sopore and other towns have retreated to safe houses and are restricted to sniping and grenade attacks on Indian bunkers . The Muslims have regrouped in the forests south of the Kashmir Valley , threatening the only road through the mountains to Srinagar . The dozens of militant groups have been weakened further by fighting among themselves . The pro-independence Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front , which started the rebellion and remains the strongest political_movement , has been virtually eliminated as a military factor . The pro-Pakistan Hizbul Moujahedeen accounts_for about half of the effective fighting force . This spring , the Kashmiri fighters were reinforced by veterans of the 10-year Afghan revolution against Soviet occupation , which ended in 1992 . Western military analysts estimate that up_to 10 % of the 4 # 000 to 5 # 000 fighters in Kashmir are from outside -- mostly from Afghanistan and Pakistan , with a_few from Arab countries . More skirmishes are being reported on the India-Pakistan frontier . The analysts say Indian troops direct machine-gun and mortar_fire at Pakistani villages they feel may be sheltering Muslim guerrillas . U.N. observers on the cease-fire line between Indian and Pakistani Kashmir reported 947 incidents in 1993 , about 600 in the last four months . Reports to U.N. headquarters this year said 25 people were killed and 103 wounded on the Pakistani side of the frontier from February to May . India does not allow the observers to investigate border incidents on its side . The United States tried unsuccessfully to start negotiations between India and Pakistan on restricting the development or use of nuclear_weapons , which both are believed to possess . Under American sponsorship , a group of intellectuals , ex-generals and former diplomats from both countries launched the Nimrana Initiative , named for the rebuilt fortress where they first met in secret two years ago . &quot; Our objective is to think the unthinkable and speak the unspeakable , &quot; an Indian participant said . &quot; We have no inhibitions. &quot; Four Kashmiris were invited to speak at the seventh meeting , in May .</TEXT>
