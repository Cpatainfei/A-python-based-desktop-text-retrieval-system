   <HEADLINE> CLINTON OPENS EUROPE TRIP , MEETS PONTIFF ; ITALY : AT THE OUTSET OF D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS , PRESIDENT AND POPE DISPLAY FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES ON POPULATION_CONTROL . MEETINGS WITH OTHER LEADERS SCHEDULED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton launched an eight-day European voyage of nostalgia and diplomacy on Thursday with a celebration of the United States ' &quot; towering friendship &quot; with Italy and a search for common_ground with the Pope on population_control . Clinton , in a late-afternoon address to the people of Rome at the city ' s historical heart on Capitoline Hill , declared that the United States and Italy share a bond of blood and spirit forged in the 50 years since the end of World_War_II . &quot; America and Italy are more_than mere partners , &quot; Clinton said , standing in the Michelangelo-designed plaza where his political idol , John F . Kennedy , spoke_to the citizens of Rome 31 years ago . &quot; We are now -- and forever will be -- Alleati , amici , una famiglia &quot; ( Allies , friends , family ) . Clinton ' s European trip is chiefly dedicated to commemorating the liberation of Europe from Nazism and fascism and the 50th anniversary of the D-day landings of June 6 , 1944 . But the President is combining ceremonies of remembrance with substantive talks with Italian , British and French leaders on current issues , from North_Korea ' s nuclear ambitions to the civil_war in the former Yugoslav federation to the surge of ultranationalist politics in Europe . He also used the occasion to conduct a private , 40-minute meeting with Pope John Paul II , their second encounter in less than a year . The pontiff , growing even more outspoken with the years , did not pull his punches on abortion with the young American President . The secular and spiritual_leaders made little effort to mask their fundamental dispute over abortion while seeking shared language on the central role of the family in society . Clinton acknowledged &quot; genuine disagreements &quot; with the Pope on contraception and efforts to slow population growth in the developing world . But the President said he reassured John Paul II that , despite his and his wife ' s liberal views on abortion rights , his Administration does not endorse abortion as a means of contraception or population_control . The White_House and the Vatican were also far apart on spin control . While Clinton said he and the Pope spent the bulk of their time discussing problems in Asia , the Middle_East and Latin_America , the Vatican , in a statement , said that &quot; the most important part of the meeting &quot; was dedicated to the subject of the &quot; defense and promotion of life &quot; -- the Roman_Catholic_Church ' s code words for its unwavering opposition to abortion . &quot; In this regard , &quot; the Vatican statement said , &quot; the Holy_Father made an appeal_to the responsibility of a great nation such_as America , whose origin and historical development has always promoted ethical values that are basic to every culture. &quot; The Pope also upbraided Clinton on abortion at their first meeting , in Denver in August . After seeing the Pope and viewing the newly restored frescoes of the Sistine Chapel , Clinton met with American seminarians at the Vatican . He told the seminarians that seeing the Pope was an &quot; awe-inspiring experience &quot; and praised their commitment to a life of faith and self-discipline . Clinton told the earnest theologians : &quot; In all secular societies , it is recognized that very few people have the capacity to make a commitment of that depth and constancy . And yet , all_of us know that , ultimately , the meaning of our lives depend_upon the constant effort to achieve a_level of integrity between what we feel and what we think and what we do. &quot; After Clinton ' s two-hour visit to the Holy_See , the President and the new Italian prime_minister , billionaire Silvio Berlusconi , met for the first time . The Italian leader reaffirmed his government ' s commitment to political and economic reform , despite the presence of five neo-fascist ministers in his 25-member Cabinet . Clinton said he would judge Berlusconi ' s conservative new government on its record and said he was confident that Italy will continue to hew to its democratic traditions . But he expressed concern about the appeal and spread of totalitarian sentiment , not just in Italy but throughout the world . &quot; No country is immune to people who run making extremist statements trying to divide people , trying to , in_effect , play_on both the economic frustrations and the social and moral frustration that people feel in all countries where there is both economic stagnation and social disintegration , &quot; Clinton said in a news_conference with Berlusconi at the Palazzo Chigi , seat of the Italian government . &quot; People everywhere yearn for a certain sense of order and discipline and hopefulness about the daily conditions of life , &quot; Clinton added . &quot; And when those things are under stress , every political_system will be vulnerable to people who try to play_on fears and to divide people. &quot; The President said that he was reassured by Berlusconi ' s promise that his government is unequivocally committed to democracy &quot; from top to bottom. &quot; For his part , the media-magnate-turned-politician asserted that his right-wing government will not be polluted by fascism in any form and denied that Italians yearn for a return to its brown-shirted past under dictator Benito Mussolini . &quot; I can tell you how my government stands , truly , &quot; Berlusconi said . &quot; In Italy , there is no such thing as nostalgia for a period that we consider to be completely buried in the past and having been condemned by history. &quot; A senior American official said Berlusconi had told Clinton that Italy under his government could be &quot; your closest partner in Europe. &quot; The new prime_minister ' s assertion struck many as ironic because Berlusconi ' s economic platform is much closer to those of President Ronald Reagan and British Prime_Minister Margaret Thatcher than to Clinton ' s . The aide said the President had raised concerns about piracy of U.S. software and entertainment products , a widespread practice in Italy . Berlusconi responded that he is_well aware of the problem , having been a major consumer of U.S. entertainment as a media executive . Clinton began his official day with a visit to Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro , whose post is largely ceremonial . Today , Clinton visits the American cemetery at Nettuno , near the site of the disastrous Anzio landing of January , 1944 , where thousands died after being hemmed_in on the beach for almost four months . He will pay homage to the war dead and speak about the struggle to extend the hard-won freedom of Western Europe to the struggling nations of the former Soviet_Union .</TEXT>
