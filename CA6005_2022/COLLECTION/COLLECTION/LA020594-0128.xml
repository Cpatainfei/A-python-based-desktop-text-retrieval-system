   <HEADLINE> STATE LEGISLATIVE INFORMATION IS NOW ON COMPUTER_NETWORK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Detailed information on the day-to-day workings of the California Legislature is available on a nationwide computer_network under a new law authored by Assemblywoman Debra Bowen ( D-Marina del Rey ) . Computer users with access to Internet can view the data at no additional charge to their access costs . The information includes the text of all pending Assembly and Senate bills , the status , history and staff analyses of current measures , along with daily files , floor and committee voting records , and gubernatorial bill signings and vetoes . Programmed at taxpayers ' expense , the service permits computer users to track any bill as it moves through the Legislature -- or is sidetracked along the way . The files are the same as those used by state legislators and their staffs . &quot; This is the first_step to demystifying what goes_on in Sacramento , &quot; Bowen said . &quot; Thomas_Jefferson once said that an informed citizenry was the best guarantee of a responsible government. &quot; Noting that the service is free_of any state charges to the user , Bowen said : &quot; Californians already pay $ 50 million a year to create , operate and manage this information . They shouldn ' t have to pay a second fee to see what they ' ve already paid to create. &quot; The legislation was unanimously approved in 1993 and signed into law by Gov . Pete Wilson . Bowen ' s bill drew support from such varied groups as Apple Computer , the software industry , the League of Women Voters , Sierra Club and California Common Cause . For details on how to access the data , Bowen said computer users should contact their Assembly member or state_senator and request a user ' s guide . The Internet on-line system is widely available in colleges and universities and in some government_agencies and businesses . Individuals also can have access through various commercial on-line services that provide links to Internet . Costs for commercial services vary , as does the telephone time used while a person is_on the system , depending_on whether it requires a local or long-distance_call . A number of books explaining Internet and how to use it have been published in the last year because it is seen as the beginning of the much-talked-about information superhighway .</TEXT>
