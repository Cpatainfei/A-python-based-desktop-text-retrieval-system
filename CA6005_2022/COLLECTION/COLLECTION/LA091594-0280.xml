   <HEADLINE> DEBT-REDUCTION ACCORD SEEN AS BIG BOOST FOR POLAND ; FINANCE : THE AGREEMENT CUTS BY ALMOST HALF THE $ 14 BILLION IN COMMUNIST-ERA OBLIGATIONS THE NATION OWES COMMERCIAL LENDERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bankers from around the world signed a generous debt-reduction agreement with Poland on Wednesday , cutting by almost half the $ 14 billion in Communist-era obligations still owed to more_than 400 commercial lenders . The long-awaited agreement brings_to an end almost 15 years of haggling over Poland ' s indebtedness and is expected to give an important boost to the country ' s economy , already one of Europe ' s fastest-growing . &quot; Poland will now be in a much better position to exploit its economic potential because of the improved investment climate , &quot; said Bernd Klett , an Eastern European analyst with Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt , Germany . &quot; The insecurity surrounding the foreign debt problem is now over. &quot; Poland has lagged behind other Eastern European_countries , namely the Czech Republic and Hungary , in attracting foreign investment , in large part because of its poor repayment record . The Polish government at times has unilaterally stopped making payments on its debt service , which made_it difficult for would-be investors to obtain new loans . Under the agreement , which takes_effect Oct . 27 , Poland must adhere to a strict 30-year repayment schedule for its remaining debt , paying $ 375 million to its creditors next year and as much as $ 600 million in future years . In return , the banks have agreed to reduce the country ' s commercial debt by 49.2 % , making the deal one of the most generous debt-reduction packages negotiated by the &quot; London Club , &quot; a group of commercial lenders . &quot; This is a big deal for Poland , &quot; said Markus Rodlauer , chief of the Warsaw office of the International Monetary Fund , which has agreed to help Poland cover the $ 1.9-billion initial cost of the deal . &quot; This should be the final chapter in the country ' s normalizing relations with its creditors. &quot; Negotiators from both sides said they were under intense political pressure to reach an agreement because of a decision three years ago by Western governments to cut Poland ' s non-commercial foreign debt by about 50 % , but only if commercial lenders agreed to do the same . The &quot; Paris Club &quot; -- a group of government lenders -- was eager to ease Poland ' s payment obligations to help soften the transition to a market_economy . &quot; Both sides , let ' s say , suffered to a certain extent from the politics , &quot; said Ernst-Moritz Lipp of Dresdner Bank , chief negotiator for the London Club . Analysts said the turning point in the most recent phase of negotiations , which has lasted four years , came last fall when the chairmanship of the negotiating team passed from U.S. to European banks . Polish negotiators complained that non-European commercial lenders treated Poland as &quot; a place they knew only from a computer_screen , &quot; whereas European banks , particularly those in Germany , showed a far greater interest in the country . Reflecting that attitude , Bernhard Walter , a board_member at Dresdner Bank , which shares the chairmanship with Lloyds Bank , said at the ceremony Wednesday that &quot; we want to be there to help &quot; as Poland ' s doors to foreign investment swing open . E . Michael Hunter of Lloyds Bank also welcomed an expected surge in foreign banking activity . Of the $ 14 billion owed by Poland to foreign commercial lenders , $ 8.7 billion was unpaid loans made to the Communist government in the 1970s , $ 1.1 billion was outstanding revolving_credits from 1983 and 1984 , and $ 4.2 billion was overdue interest accrued over the past five years .</TEXT>
