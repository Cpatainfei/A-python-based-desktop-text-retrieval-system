   <HEADLINE> CAN WOMEN BE SAINTS IN FRANCE ? ; A PUSH TO ENTER MARIE CURIE , RADIOACTIVITY CO-DISCOVERER , IN THE PANTHEON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When it comes_to language , food and cultural patrimony , few nationalities are more inward-looking and resistant to change than the_French . So it is unsurprising that in the two centuries since the Pantheon in Paris was dedicated during the_French Revolution &quot; Aux Grand Hommes la Patrie reconnaissante , &quot; it has served as the mausoleum only for those great men , men to whom the fatherland was grateful . There , in the imposing former church on the Left_Bank , one finds the remains of France ' s great men of arts , letters and science -- among them Francois Voltaire , Jean Jacques Rousseau , Victor_Hugo , Emile_Zola . Burial there is the_French secular equivalent of sainthood . But not for women , who did not even enjoy the right_to_vote until after World_War_II , in 1945 . Now some of France ' s leading women have prevailed on President Francois Mitterrand to mend this historical error in political correctness and merit . He has agreed to reinter France ' s greatest latter-day scientist , Marie Curie , the co-discoverer of radioactivity , in the Pantheon . This comes 83 years after the_French Academy of Sciences refused to admit her . No matter that she had just won her second Nobel Prize that year , 1911 . &quot; Let_in anyone , except women , &quot; said the then-guardians of French intellectual patrimony . Curie , who died in 1934 , is expected to be the first of a number of women interred in the Pantheon . She was an obvious first choice , not only because of her towering achievements but because her granddaughter , Helene Langevin Joliot-Curie , is both a prominent scientist and a political supporter of Mitterrand . Actually , the Polish-born Curie will not be the first woman buried in the Pantheon , only the first on_her_own merits . The famed chemist Marcellin Bertholet , who died in 1907 , insisted in his will that his wife be buried beside him . Now the question is whether the remains of Marie Curie ' s collaborator and husband , Pierre Curie , will join hers in the Pantheon . How delicious the irony if it takes a woman to bring a lesser male scientist like Pierre Curie into the Pantheon . He won only one Nobel Prize .</TEXT>
