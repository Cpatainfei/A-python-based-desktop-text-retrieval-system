   <HEADLINE> POST-QUAKE TOURISM IN L.A. IS A BIT SHAKY ; IMAGE : BARELY RECOVERED FROM BAD PUBLICITY DURING THE RIOTS , THE INDUSTRY SCRAMBLES TO REASSURE TRAVELERS THAT METROPOLITAN AREA IS STILL STANDING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Optimistic by nature and necessity , Los Angeles ' tourism and convention industry already is putting its own spin on last week ' s deadly earthquake , combatting stark media images of wrecked freeways and tent cities with a global blitz of feel-good faxes and phone_calls . The fear in tourism circles is that news_stories and television pictures of yet another Southern California disaster could cause more damage than the quake itself to an industry worth an estimated $ 8.25 billion a year to Los Angeles County alone . &quot; It ' s kind of disconcerting when you get calls from Germany , Russia and Britain saying , ' Should we cancel our trip ? ' and ' Do you have any hotels still standing ? ' &quot; said Bill Boyd , executive_director of the Chamber_of_Commerce in Beverly Hills , where quake damage was minimal . Determined to stamp_out such scorched-earth scenarios , the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau -- still recovering from the 1992 riots -- has contacted 25 # 000 international travel_agents to assure them that most of the metropolitan area remains in good_shape . Additionally , the bureau has invited 15 national meeting planners into the area to let them see for themselves . &quot; If a picture is worth a_thousand words , then a visit is worth a_thousand pictures , &quot; said Michael Collins , the bureau ' s vice_president . But it was too late to help the four-day California Gift Show at the Convention Center , which wrapped_up this week , an extravaganza normally counted_on to bring_in 12 % of the facility ' s annual revenue . After the quake , about 5 % of the exhibitors canceled -- part of the reason the Convention and Visitors Bureau this week projected $ 308 million in lost business because of the temblor . The American Film Marketing Assn. , scrambling to make_sure the same -- or worse -- doesn ' t happen to its annual film market in Santa Monica next month , faxed 6 # 000 film_producers and distributors in 66 countries a memo -- &quot; We ' re Alright ! &quot; -- that proclaimed hotels and movie_theaters essentially unscathed . &quot; Just to let you know it was a bumpy ride , but Santa Monica survived the Northridge earthquake with flying colors , &quot; the fax chirped , neglecting to mention that Santa Monica was actually one of the hardest-hit communities . A recorded message on a Los Angeles visitors hot_line takes a similarly breezy tone , noting that access from Los Angeles International Airport to points east is &quot; not a problem &quot; and that &quot; all major attractions remain open. &quot; Disney officials , in turn , sent_out a fax to travel_agents to report : &quot; Disneyland Resort unaffected by recent earthquake ; business and fun as usual in Orange County. &quot; Those who depend_on tourism and convention business insist that they are not seeking to minimize the quake ' s devastation , but rather to counter unfounded perceptions of a metropolis eternally burning and traumatized from fires , floods , riots and the_like . &quot; We really took the offensive on this , &quot; said Tim Kittleson , vice_president of the film marketing association . &quot; If people sit there and don ' t hear from you , they start to think , ' Is anything still standing ? ' &quot; Kittleson and others also must cope_with the fact that apocalyptic images and rumors spread with surprising ease along the information superhighway -- and key distinctions , such_as Santa Clarita ' s relatively remote location , may be lost on people in Egypt or Ecuador . More_than anything , tourism officials dread TV ' s relentless portrayals of the worst pockets of disaster , which may encourage foreign news organizations to hype the disaster . &quot; I really hope the media , especially the Japanese media , doesn ' t exaggerate the circumstances right now , &quot; said Shiro Monden , general_manager of Japan Travel Bureau . &quot; Japanese people are worried about fires and bridges collapsing in Downtown Los Angeles. &quot; A consoling factor for tourism officials is the timing of the quake -- during the off-season , improving the chances that travelers will forget about it by summer . Also , the temblor struck just as the eastern half of the nation was crippled by a killer cold_snap , making_it easy for spin masters to crow about Southern California ' s fabled weather while noting that no region of the world is immune from natural disasters . Finally , the quake may have done nothing more_than confirm what people already know . &quot; Everybody realizes that this is an earthquake city , but it ' s not the only destination in the world where you have earthquakes , &quot; said Patrick Schoeneborn , vice_president of Go America Tours . But behind such rosy outlooks lurk concerns that the quake will make_it tougher than ever to woo visitors -- at a time when business was finally improving after the riots . The Japanese Travel Bureau said the number of Japanese tourists coming_to Los Angeles dipped to 80 # 000 in 1992 as a result of the riots , down from 106 # 000 the year before , a drop of more_than 20 % . The number crept upward last year , approaching the 100 # 000 mark , and observers say tourism throughout Southern California had begun a slow but steady recovery . Last week ' s quake could put the industry back to square one , however , forcing it to overcome images of four-hour traffic_jams in addition to the unending assortment of crime and gang news . One fear is that even locals will be intimidated by the crippled transportation_system and stop day-tripping , a worrisome notion in places like Venice Beach , one of the most popular tourist destinations in Southern California . &quot; People don ' t want to go_through the hassle , &quot; said Hwan Song , chairman of the 180-member Venice Beach Assn . But the tourism industry is nothing if not resilient , and at least one tour operator is hopeful he can turn the temblor to advantage . He is Michael Fawcett of Insider Tours , which offers such offbeat excursions as &quot; Marilyn Monroe ' s Los Angeles &quot; and a &quot; Historical Tour of Venice. &quot; He anticipates some visitors will want to see the quake damage firsthand . &quot; It ' s easy for me , &quot; he said , &quot; to accommodate them. &quot;</TEXT>
