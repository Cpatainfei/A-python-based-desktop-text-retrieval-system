   <HEADLINE> 2 FBI_AGENTS , DETECTIVE KILLED IN D.C. SHOOTING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two FBI_agents and a District_of_Columbia police_detective were shot and killed Tuesday afternoon as gunfire erupted in the squad room of an elite homicide unit at Washington ' s downtown police_headquarters . A fourth person , believed to be the gunman , was also found dead at the scene , officials said . Officials would not assign a motive to the shootings . Washington Police_Chief Fred Thomas said that the gunman , who had a semiautomatic rifle , and two other people were being interviewed by members of the squad . He said that the three were &quot; either witnesses or suspects &quot; in cases but declined to give their identities or further details . One knowledgeable source said that the dead gunman apparently was a suspect who was questioned a week ago by homicide detectives in a recent triple slaying in Washington . Of the other two being interviewed by the police team , one was wounded and the other was unharmed but in custody . Another FBI_agent in the room at the time , John David Kuchta , had surgery for leg and chest wounds suffered in the shootout . Law_enforcement sources took pains to deny an early report that the gunman was a former member of the Police_Department . Neither was it clear how the gunman died , whether he shot himself or was shot by others . &quot; There were a lot of guns in that squad room , &quot; one official said . The shootings broke_out around 3:30 p.m. in a third-floor office that served as the meeting_place for a crack group of detectives known as the &quot; cold case &quot; squad , so named because they investigate the most difficult unsolved murder cases -- many so old that they are considered &quot; cold , &quot; officials said . The FBI_agents were participants in the &quot; cold case &quot; task_force , according to Susan Lloyd , a bureau spokeswoman . Shortly after the shootings broke_out , police SWAT team members arrived and sealed_off the floors above and below the third floor and , after a room-by-room search , made contact with the gunman . Less than half an hour later , Thomas said , SWAT team members forced their way into the squad room and found the two FBI_agents , one male and one female , as well as the D.C. policeman , mortally wounded . The three were later pronounced dead . Within minutes of the shootings , emergency medical workers descended on the massive , five-story granite building five blocks from the Capitol . National_Park_Service police helicopters ferried shooting victims to area hospitals . City officials said that there was no effective security in the police_headquarters building , which also houses city offices where Washingtonians go_to obtain driver ' s licenses , automobile license_plates and birth_certificates . Observers said that the building ' s lobby is staffed by uniformed but unarmed personnel and does not have metal detectors . The head of the District_of_Columbia police union complained Tuesday night about the lack of security . &quot; They talk_about budget_cuts but they ' ve got no metal detectors down here , no security , &quot; said J.C. Stamps , president of the Fraternal Order of Police . &quot; We need more protection just like anyone else and they should see that now. &quot; Although details of the shootings were hard to come_by late Tuesday , there was no dearth of unofficial reports . At the time of the incident , police officials were conducting a press_conference down the hall and within minutes a gaggle of reporters and camera people converged on the scene , adding_to the chaos . Some of the reporters later said outside police_headquarters that SWAT team members had fired tear_gas before entering the squad room where the shootings occurred . By early evening , as darkness settled over the nation ' s capital , a lone Washington police_officer emerged from the building and wordlessly lowered the U.S. and District_of_Columbia flags to half staff on the flagpole in front of the building . The slain FBI_agents were identified as Martha Dixon Martinez , 35 , a seven-year veteran , and Michael J . Miller , 36 , an eight-year veteran . The deaths of two agents were the worst loss of life in a single occurrence for the FBI since a shootout in Miami in April , 1986 . In that case , agents were chasing two bank robbery_suspects who opened_fire , killing two agents as they were stepping_out of_their_own car . In all , more_than 40 agents have been killed in the bureau ' s 86-year history . Although no FBI_agents died , the government ' s initial raid on the Branch Davidian compound outside Waco , Tex. , in February , 1993 , resulted in the deaths of four agents assigned to the Treasury_Department ' s Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms . The dead District police_officer was identified as Detective Sgt . Hank Daly , 51 , a 28-year veteran . A Washington Hospital Center official said that Daly had suffered two gunshot wounds , in the head and neck , and was dead when he arrived_at the hospital . Daly was supervisor of the &quot; cold case &quot; squad , officials said . &quot; He was an outstanding police_officer , &quot; former D.C. Police_Chief Isaac Fulwood said on local television . &quot; He really understood homicides . He had an outstanding ability to interview . He got_along well with people . . . . He will be sorely missed. &quot; Fulwood said that Daly ' s name was &quot; one of first to come_up &quot; when the &quot; cold case &quot; unit was created several years ago . &quot; The police_officers didn ' t have a chance , &quot; he added . &quot; There ' s nothing like when a police_officer gets killed . it just devastates a department. &quot; Times staff writers Ronald J . Ostrow and Aaron Nathans contributed to this story .</TEXT>
