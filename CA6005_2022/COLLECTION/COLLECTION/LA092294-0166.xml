   <HEADLINE> CENTERPIECE : LET THERE BE NIGHT ; HIGH-OUTPUT LAMPS LIGHT THE WAY FOR TRAIL CYCLISTS WHO SEEK NEW CHALLENGES . COOL AIR AND HIGH SPEEDS COME WITH THE TERRITORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s Wednesday evening at the bottom of Sulphur Mountain Road . Cliff_swallows are gulping down the final insects of the day while the last dust-streaked hikers and mountain_bike riders straggle to the end of the popular trail . As the birds settle into their nests and the daylight cyclists head_home to supper and TV , a half_dozen riders in clean jerseys chat idly in the cool , blue light of evening . They ' re waiting . Waiting for the sky over Lake Casitas to dim and uncover the evening_star . All of a sudden somebody flips a switch , and it ' s prime_time for the latest mountain_bike trend -- night-time trail_riding . The newest battery-powered , high-output lamps have given mountain_biking a new dimension , and companies that manufacture the lights , such_as the Thousand Oaks-based Turbo Cat , report that sales double each year . Those lights are turning_up on trails throughout Southern California . &quot; In Cheeseboro Canyon and Ranch Sierra Vista we get a lot of night riding , &quot; ranger Robert Heagy said . &quot; I ' d say that on any given weeknight at Cheeseboro , we have 20 to 30 riders. &quot; There are plenty of reasons for the popularity . For one , temperatures are cooler at night . For another , the same boring trail that you ' ve ridden a rut in suddenly becomes challenging . Paul Sailor , an electrical_engineer from Ventura , has ridden Sulphur Mountain and several other popular trails at night . He enjoys the added challenge but also the tranquillity . &quot; During the day when you stop , the sun is blazing and all_the other riders are buzzing by , &quot; he said . &quot; But at night it ' s so cool and quiet all you hear are crickets and the wind in the trees. &quot; Then there ' s the motivation nobody wants to talk_about -- the need for speed . Fast moving bikes have_on occasion bowled_over hikers or barreled into the back_end of equestrians . As a result , many trails have been closed to bikes , and those that remain open have speed_limits . For all practical purposes , the speed_limit signs come_down at night . &quot; Realistically speaking , some people are riding over the speed_limit , &quot; ranger Heagy said , &quot; but there are so few users at night that the potential for collision is low. &quot; Speed is the rule on Wednesdays along the county-maintained Sulphur Mountain Road . It ' s a regular club night when dozens of riders climb the well-maintained trail for the banzai ride back_down . A few , such_as Tren Morris of Ventura , get_to the top and wait for darkness to descend before heading down . Sounds dangerous , doesn ' t it ? Going kamikaze down a pitch-black trail , nothing but a slim beam_of_light separating you from a disfiguring accident . But veteran riders say a good light lets you descend faster and , in some respects , more safely than in daylight when the potential for plowing through an elementary_school field trip is very real . &quot; It ' s great , &quot; Morris said . &quot; You can come_up here at dusk , wait for it to get dark and fly back down. &quot; On one such night , four riders blazed by within feet of Ventura hiker Tom Adam , surrounding him in a plume of dust . But despite the controversy that swirls between bikers and other trail users , Adam was philosophical . &quot; When you go_into the woods you have to watch for rattlesnakes , &quot; he said . &quot; Sulphur Mountain is one of the few places where guys can ride as fast as they want . This is a major mountain_bike trail and as a hiker , when you ' re on it , you have to watch_out for bikes. &quot; He added it would be thoughtful for a bicycle club to post a sign alerting unaware hikers to the presence of bikes . The after-hours absence of boot-shod pedestrians and horseback_riders doesn ' t mean the trail is completely free_of hoofed road hazards . The hills surrounding Sulphur Mountain Road are home to cattle and deer . Broadside one of these critters at 35 m.p.h. and you ' ll get more_than a bent wheel . &quot; I don ' t know of anybody who ' s ever center_punched one , &quot; Morris said on the way up . But on the way down , he and his wing man , Mike Gourley , also from Ventura , nearly notched a new experience . &quot; I was about six inches behind Tren ' s wheel and he just locked his brakes up , &quot; Gourley said , still breathing hard minutes after the near collision . &quot; I tried to shout , DEER ! &quot; Morris said apologetically . &quot; All I saw was you lock_up and I swerved to the left . that ' s when I saw it . I must have missed by just two feet , &quot; Gourley said . &quot; Oh man ! I ' m still shaking. &quot; The rest of the fauna are less hazardous . Turbo Cat owner Tom Robbins finds nocturnal wildlife one of the most remarkable things about night riding . &quot; When I ride_out at Malibu Creek during the day I never see mice , but at night the kangaroo_rats are all_over the place . Really , they ' re thick as cockroaches . Then there are these strange birds , they ' re called night jars , I think . They sit in the trail until the last possible moment and flush right over your head. &quot; Even setting_aside the natural tableau , Robbins is understandably hyped about night riding . Sales at Turbo Cat are up 160 % just through the third quarter of this year . &quot; The fourth quarter is our biggest one . People get used to riding after work in the summer , then the days start getting shorter , that ' s when sales pick_up , &quot; Robbins said . At Nightsun -- a Pasadena company that also manufactures high-output bicycle lights -- sales have doubled every 18 months for the last seven years , said owner Tobin George . &quot; Some of the sales are_due to bicycle commuting , but night riding is definitely growing , particularly at this time of year. &quot; The traditional generator that attached_to the bike ' s rear wheel produced about three watts and you couldn ' t get much more power than that without installing a generator that looked as if it came from under the hood of a car . In contrast , today ' s lights generate as much as 40 watts , a beam luminous enough that bicycle commuters say cars sometimes flash their brights so cyclists will turn it down . Consumer demand for such portable products as notebook_computers and electric_razors greatly increased research in rechargeable battery technology , Tobin said . Batteries now last longer , recharge more quickly and yield more power . Robbins hopes research into electric_cars will produce a breakthrough that results in a_battery that is lighter and even more powerful -- and maybe cheaper as well . As it is , Dave Hamilton , part owner of Allied Bicycles in Ventura , said you can expect to spend $ 120 to $ 200 for a decent light set that burns two to three hours . Of course you can ride without a light . A full_moon is the oldest night-riding aid . Experienced riders say that if you know the trail , a full_moon is plenty bright even for relatively high-speed descents . Barring moonlight , Hamilton said , as_many as three riders without lights can follow a leader with a strong lamp . &quot; You just have to get right on his rear wheel and trust him , &quot; he said . Here ' s an alternative for the budget minded : Hamilton said cyclists with weaker , less expensive lights riding three abreast can generate enough candle power to illuminate a road , but the road has to be wide enough . This is not a viable method for the narrow , technically difficult trails mountain bikers call single track . Yet it ' s the diminishing access to single track that draws a fringe element to night riding . &quot; Lots of guys ride_out of bounds , &quot; Hamilton said . &quot; Guys in the underground scene . If they ' ve been eyeing an off-limit hill for a_couple_of months , they are more likely to get a light and do_it when the ranger is at_home asleep. &quot; It seems like a rule of nature . Whether it ' s outlaw skiers snaking through the trees , computer hackers with modems knocking_on locked electronic gateways or mountain bikers with lights : Mobility seeks access . &quot; There ' s more illegal riding ( at night ) than I care to admit , &quot; Robbins said . &quot; But you can see them a mile away and if the rangers want to catch them , they can. &quot; For his part , Ranger Robert Heagy doesn ' t see the growth of night riding as a major threat to public safety or trail preservation . &quot; The big thing about night riding is that it spreads park visitors out over more hours , &quot; Heagy said . &quot; I ' d have to say that on the balance , it ' s a positive thing. &quot; Cyclists , Hikers Clash on Styles So what ' s this controversy between mountain bikers and hikers ? You ' d think their common outdoor interest would create a bond , but no . It ' s a curious trait of humans that we ' re most scornful of those who share interests similar to our own . Sailboat owners regularly lower the boom on the power boat crowd and fly fishermen save the sharpest barbs for their brethren who fish with bait . However , in the case of mountain bikers and other trail users the conflict is not without cause . It ' s not so_much a case of environmental damage : Studies show that on most terrain , cycles cause as much damage as hiking boots and less than equestrians . It ' s the clash of styles ( and sometimes bodies ) that has created an uneasy relationship . The leisurely pace of hikers and horses doesn ' t mix with the 25- to 45-m.p.h. rate at which some cyclists descend the trail . A horseback_rider from Ojai who asked that his name not be used said when he sees cyclists speeding down the trail , he turns his horse broadside , blocking the trail and bringing the cyclists to a sudden halt , whereupon he lectures them on safety and etiquette in language that ' s anything but polite . As a result of the conflict , more and more areas have been closed to cyclists since the first production mountain_bike was manufactured in 1980 . Wilderness areas such_as the Sespe , Chumash and Matilija are among the public lands where mountain_bikes are barred . &quot; Sespe was a place that had_the_best this sport had to offer , &quot; said Mickey McTigue , author of a guide to mountain biking in Ventura County . &quot; We used to do a ride every November starting over in the Lockwood area , ride to Ojai , stay overnight at the Sespe Hot Springs and next day ride_out and down 33 to Ojai . that ' s all changed with the wilderness across there. &quot; Oddly enough , mountain_bikes are excluded under a law that predates the explosion of all-terrain bicycles by 20 years . The Wilderness Act of 1964 prohibits &quot; mechanized vehicles , &quot; and even the Sierra Club , the main opponent of broader bicycle access , generally concedes that the language was meant to apply to such motorized vehicles as dirt bikes and 4-wheel drive trucks . The club maintained , however , that the intent of the law would have excluded mountain_bikes from public lands . But this year the Sierra Club acknowledged a difference between motorized and non-motorized mechanical vehicles , said George Darnes , chairman of the Sierra Club ' s off-road vehicle subcommittee . &quot; As a result of a conference in April with the International Mountain Bicycling Assn. , the Sierra Club no longer opposes bicycles on public lands outside of wilderness areas , &quot; he said . &quot; But we still oppose mechanized vehicles in wilderness areas whether those vehicles are mountain_bikes , wheeled carts or what have you. &quot; In the last five years , cyclists and the Sierra Club have come_to a much better agreement about mountain_bikes in the back_country , said Thousand Oaks resident Mark Langton , editor of Mountain Biking magazine . That results from a concerted effort by cyclists to be good citizens when sharing recreational resources with other users . Consequently , the trend of trail closures has begun to reverse itself . One more cautionary note , though . If you ' re a cyclist going_for a ride in the coming months , beware of the biggest potential shared-use hazard of all : deer hunters .
