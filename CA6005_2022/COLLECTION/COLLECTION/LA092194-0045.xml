   <HEADLINE> EXPRESSING OUTRAGE ; ACTIVISTS CALL FOR TOUGH TREATMENT FOR YOUTHS ACCUSED OF TORTURING AND KILLING DOG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dorothy Davis was a lawyer for 40 years , but she seemed a little out_of_place in Compton Juvenile_Court . The white-haired , soft-spoken Mission Viejo resident , who specialized in entertainment law , drove more_than 35 miles to Compton ' s towering courthouse Tuesday to express outrage over the torture and fiery death of a dog . &quot; I haven ' t been able to sleep for a long_time over this , &quot; Davis said outside a closed hearing for three teen-agers charged with torturing the Rottweiler mix for more_than three hours on Aug . 31 in the Hyde Park area of South-Central Los Angeles , and eventually setting it on_fire and killing it . &quot; I ' ve seen a lot of abuse with_children and animals , &quot; she said , &quot; but this is the worst. &quot; Davis was joined by about 30 Southland animal rights activists , who milled quietly in the halls while a prosecutor argued that the two 16-year-olds charged with the dog ' s deathshould be tried as adults . The hearing will continue Oct . 4 , and the activists vowed to return . &quot; Animals don ' t have a voice that will get a response , &quot; said Claudia Ross of the Amanda Foundation , a Beverly Hills-based organization that rescues animals that are about to be euthanized . &quot; In the bureaucracy , there are groups looking_out for children and battered human_beings , and all those groups are important , but animals seem to come_up pretty low on the scale , &quot; Ross said . Meanwhile , the parents of the accused say police arrested the wrong youths . One woman said her son loves animals as much as the activists who call_for his incarceration . She said the youth has two dogs and grew_up in a house full of cats and birds . &quot; You teach them to love them , &quot; said the woman , who was incensed that the police had gone_after her son . &quot; I can ' t imagine who would do that , &quot; she said of the torture . &quot; It ' s sick. &quot; The woman and other parents said the true culprits are other teen-agers in the neighborhood . The 16-year-olds , and a 15-year-old who is too young to be tried as an adult , were arrested after police got a call from a resident who said she saw six youths torturing a dog on a porch . When police arrived , they saw a burning object hurtling toward their car , said Deputy Dist . Atty . Daniel Wright . Then they saw three teen-agers chase the burning dog , beating it to death with lead pipes . They pursued the youths and arrested them , Wright said . &quot; I can understand the concern of the animal rights people , &quot; said attorney Elizabeth Wehrmeister , who represents the 16-year-old with the pet dogs . &quot; I ' m upset at what happened . I don ' t think I have run_into anyone who isn ' t upset at what happened to this animal . The question is , do they have the right person ? &quot; Wright says they do . &quot; One of the officers smelled lighter fluid on one of ( the youth ' s ) hands , &quot; Wright said . &quot; These are the right kids. &quot; Wright added that police are trying to identify other suspects , and said he expects at least one more arrest . All face_up to three years in either a juvenile hall or state penitentiary , and one of the 16-year-olds who Wright says is also facing unrelated robbery charges could serve_up to seven years . The activists hope the case will deter others from torturing animals , and say it is important to prosecute animal torturers because their next victims could be human . &quot; Don ' t you think these kids are going_to be doing_it to adults some day ? &quot; said Chris DeRose , president of Last Chance for Animals , a West Hollywood-based animal rights group . He and Wright noted that many serial_killers , such_as Jeffrey Dahmer and Richard Ramirez , tortured animals as youths . &quot; Your hard-core killers start by being cruel to animals , &quot; said Pat Peyovich , a member of Last Chance for Animals . &quot; If a child has the right kind of environment , the right kind of training , their mind would n ' t let them do that , &quot; she said . Nearby , in a waiting area next to the courtroom where their children would soon appear , the grim-faced parents of the teen-agers repeated that they believed the police had knowingly arrested the wrong children .</TEXT>
