   <HEADLINE> COSMIC COLLISION HAS EARTHLINGS LOOKING SKYWARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For astronomers and star warriors who already view the night sky with foreboding , the cataclysm that convulsed Jupiter last week was a possible preview of the fate of Earth , which one day may be caught off-guard by a stream of natural warheads -- comets or asteroids on a collision course with the home planet . The unexpectedly powerful impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter -- striking repeatedly with hundreds of times the energy contained in all Earth ' s nuclear_weapons -- is lending new respectability to scientists who want to detect and ward_off objects that may intersect Earth ' s path . As the comet fragments blossomed into plumes of superheated gas on Jupiter , the House Committee on Science , Space and Technology voted last week to require that NASA catalogue and track all major comets or asteroids that may cross Earth ' s path . And several prominent scientists have quietly lobbied the U.S. Air_Force Space Command to volunteer the use of its network of sky-watching satellites and telescopes for the same purpose . Early next year , the Space Command is expected to make its early warning satellite system and at least one of its ground-based telescopes available to watch for incoming asteroids or comets , congressional sources said . The programming of the satellite system , which normally monitors hostile rocket launches , will be modified so that it will also warn of objects approaching from deep_space . The telescope , part of a system being upgraded , normally monitors foreign satellites . Space is far from empty . Millions of asteroids and comets crisscross the solar_system , but almost all_of them are far from Earth , orbiting between Mars and Jupiter or circling in a vast cloud more_than a light-year from the sun . Astronomers have already identified about 200 objects large enough to wreak havoc on Earth . By tracking their orbits , they have determined that none of those would hit Earth . But most scientists suspect there are thousands more . Geologists say Earth has been struck many times in its history . Scientists recently identified a 110-mile-wide impact crater on the Yucatan_Peninsula . The 65-million-year-old crater , believed to be connected to the demise of the dinosaurs , is the largest-known impact structure on Earth . Until recently , such scars were considered part of Earth ' s past , not a preview of any future hazard . Today , only a_few aged telescopes are dedicated to searching for asteroids near Earth . If the House measure is adopted this fall , NASA will have a decade to catalogue every Earth-crossing object more_than half a mile wide . Physicist Edward Teller has suggested using hydrogen_bombs to knock such intruders out of the sky , but scientists actively involved in planning such defenses say far more modest methods will suffice . No nuclear_weapons or anti-comet ballistic defense_systems , please , these scientists are quick to say . They want just enough advance warning -- say a century or so -- to nudge any incoming asteroid out of the way by shoving it with a rocket tipped with a_few tons of lead or to attach a solar sail that will waft it on a new course safely away from Earth . Gregory H . Canavan , a senior scientific adviser at Los Alamos National Laboratory on Friday called such gentle precautionary maneuvers &quot; cosmic croquet. &quot; Canavan , who convened a group of scientists to evaluate the problem for NASA and Congress , estimated that an early_warning_system of small telescopes around the world might cost about $ 10 million a year and active defenses another $ 50 million a year . &quot; That is the insurance_premium for things whizzing at you out of the cosmos , &quot; he said . &quot; With a_hundred years warning , you would not need nuclear explosives . You would have lots of options. &quot; Many scientists are skeptical of the risk from comets or asteroids and are adamantly opposed to any effort to shoot them down . &quot; I would worry more about a car wreck , airplane crash or getting a bad can of Spam , &quot; said University of Arizona astronomer Mark Sykes at the Steward Observatory . David Morrison at NASA ' s Ames Research_Center in Mountain View , who helped prepare a report for Congress on ways of intercepting asteroids and comets , has made a study of the risk and determined that it is unlikely but large enough to warrant concern . An impact that might kill 1 in 4 of the people on Earth can be expected about once every 500 # 000 years ; everyone alive therefore faces about a 1 in 2 million chance of being killed in such a collision in any one year . Over a lifetime that works_out to about a 1 in 20 # 000 chance , which is comparable_to the risk most people face of dying in an earthquake or an airplane crash , according to figures he presented to the American Assn . for the Advancement of Science . &quot; My ( colleagues ) think we are absolutely crazy to suggest government money should be spent to prevent a catastrophe that happens only once every several hundred millennia or so , &quot; he told the symposium of scientists . But , he said , &quot; Unlike other natural hazards , impacts can kill billions of people and endanger civilization . Unlike any other natural hazard I can think_of , you can avert an impact. &quot; Eugene Shoemaker , the astronomer who helped discover the comet that collided_with Jupiter last week , supports the effort to develop an early_warning_system to watch for incoming celestial objects , but is skeptical about proposals to create missile defenses against them . &quot; Knocking a comet down is a tough thing to do , &quot; he said Friday . Hidden by a dazzling cloud of dust and gas , a comet nucleus would be hard to target accurately . And any explosion powerful enough to destroy it might unintentionally knock it more directly into Earth ' s path . Earth ' s best protection against the hazards of cosmic hail is its relatively diminutive size . Shoemaker said that Jupiter , which contains about 2.5 times the mass of all_the other planets in the solar_system combined -- presents a much larger target than Earth , and so it is hit more frequently . Although objects the size of the comet that rocked the planet last week might be expected to hit Jupiter every 1 # 000 years , he said , they might hit Earth about once every 100 million years . But the mathematics of risk assessment take no account of disasters that may already be in_progress . &quot; Of course if there is one coming , &quot; said Lucy McFadden , a University of Maryland astronomer , &quot; the statistics are irrelevant. &quot;</TEXT>
