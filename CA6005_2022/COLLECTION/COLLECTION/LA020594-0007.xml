   <TEXT> As an American Cancer Society volunteer dedicated to the society ' s goal of reducing the devastating human and societal toll exacted by tobacco use , I heartily endorse the position taken_in your editorial &quot; Smoke_Screen &quot; ( Jan . 27 ) . No Californian should sign the petition put forth under the rubric of the &quot; California Uniform Tobacco Control Act. &quot; To do so would offer the Philip Morris Co. , the principal sponsor , the opportunity to potentially subvert or to destroy more_than 300 city and county local ordinances written to protect nonsmokers from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke . Local ordinances should not be overridden by a callous industry , which disdains the incontrovertible evidence proving its products are a public health menace . Tobacco-related diseases are the single most preventable cause of disease in the U.S. , yet they are responsible_for more_than 400 # 000 deaths annually -- approximately 53 # 000 of these attributable to secondhand smoke . RAYMOND MELROSE DDS Tobacco Activities Task_Force American Cancer Society , Los Angeles * In your editorial you imply that passive smoke is a license to kill . As to the surgeon_general ' s figure of 44 # 000 death attributed to secondhand smoke , that is the real smoke_screen . There is absolutely no proof that secondhand smoke is responsible_for a single death , let alone 44 # 000 annually . You chastise the tobacco_industry for trying to get a statewide smoking regulation in_effect , instead of each city and county having its own . What we have now is the most unfair treatment to restaurant owners in cities where there is a ban . How would it work if you applied the same method to the seat-belt law or the helmet laws for motorcycles and bicycles ? Should cities have their own regulation ? You say gross human stupidity could be prevented by fighting the tobacco_industry . I believe a greater amount of stupidity will take_place if we kill our tobacco_industry , as the anti-smoking Establishment would wish by the year 2000 . Some research should be directed toward the devastating financial impact such a move would bring_about . OTTO J . MUEKSCH North Hollywood</TEXT>
