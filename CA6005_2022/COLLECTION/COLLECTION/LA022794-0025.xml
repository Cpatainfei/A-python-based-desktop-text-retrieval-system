   <TEXT> Thank_you for David James Duncan ' s balanced , lucid and thoughtful essay on fundamentalist censorship ( &quot; Toxins in the Mother_Tongue , &quot; Jan . 23 ) . His experience highlights the need to protect our educational system from demagogues of all stripes . Our schools and communities must_not be persecuted for &quot; thought crime. &quot; Perhaps , along with national standards designed to raise the academic levels of all students , regardless of background , we need a national policy of inclusion for all cultural traditions and political viewpoints . Rather than relegating the study of our fellow beings to a_few optional humanities credits , let understanding of all shades of the human condition be our schools ' overriding covenant . RANDY MULKEY Burbank * I was reared in the Virginia Bible Belt as a Southern Baptist , and my parents rammed Christian fundamentalism down my throat , starting with grace before my first bottle . When I was 20 , my father and I heard a radio newscast of an anti-abortion demonstration at a clinic . He asked me if I agreed with the protesters . I said no , that I believed_in choice , and he flew into a rage , screaming : &quot; We didn ' t raise you to believe_in abortion. &quot; My parents automatically label all knowledge as either &quot; Christian &quot; or &quot; non-Christian. &quot; As most literature falls_into the latter category , fundamentalists will always censor in the name of God . Perhaps it ' s a sign of progress that Duncan ' s young readers were allowed to actually read his book ( albeit censored ) ; my parents had offending titles removed from my elementary_school library . MICHELLE WOODARD Redondo Beach * Duncan ' s thoughtful response to the censor ' s marker evaded a &quot; fundamental &quot; point . The battle over his work did not take_place in public_libraries or bookstores but in public_schools , where freedom of expression is not always welcome ( i.e. the recent PC squabble on college campuses ) . Fundamentalists are not ogres . Parents only want to avoid adult language being forced upon their children . Yes , literature should be experienced by everyone -- but not all literature by every age_group . GREGORY YEAGER Moreno Valley * Reading Duncan ' s scathing literary essay , I could not help but think : What if he is wrong ? What if the God of the Bible is the Lord , God and creator of the universe ? What if there is a moral standard where right and wrong exist , and that information has been made available to all people -- a user ' s manual of sorts ? How impish and self-righteous then become Duncan ' s accusations and slanderous statements of &quot; cult , &quot; &quot; pollution , &quot; &quot; Christofascism &quot; and the_like . STEVEN FABRY San Diego * While the mainstream press in the United States has , of late , frequently been criticized for its tabloid inclinations and sleaze , the real tragedy has been the spinelessness that has characterized it for so_long . Those who say you have been too easy on Bill_Clinton should remember the eight-year honeymoon Ronald Reagan enjoyed . If you had pressed harder on Iran-Contra , for example , you could have changed the course of American history : George_Bush would not have been elected President , and Oliver North would surely not be campaigning to become a senator from Virginia . So you are , I suppose , to be applauded for allowing Duncan to take_on the American fundamentalists , a target worthy of such a witty , damaging attack . One wonders , however , if you would have printed so effective an attack against that other group of fascistic censors , those who would also take_away the right of creative ( though perhaps sometimes threatening ) expression and thought -- those arguing for speech and behavior codes as well as politically correct curricula on college campuses . CARMEL DAGAN Beverly Hills Editor ' s Note : We call to your attention Barry Siegel ' s &quot; Speak No Evil , &quot; ( March 28 , 1993 ) about the University of Wisconsin ' s attempt to outlaw hate speech . * Fundamentalist Christians are not interested in being censors . They are , in fact , finding themselves in a desperate fight to keep works of fiction or nonfiction that have even a slight reference_to Christian thinking from being removed from the shelves and reading lists of schools and libraries . This has even included the Bible itself . On the other hand , those responsible members of our culture , regardless of political or religious persuasion , who would hope that we can improve the moral and ethical climate in the United States seem to be coming_to a point of agreement . Freedom of any kind must be accompanied by responsibility and accountability . RANDY KIRK Los Angeles * On reading Duncan ' s article , Joe Sixpack exclaimed &quot; Wha ? &quot; and the rest of us giggled with relief in the realization that educated common_sense still exists -- even with a poetic twist . Now , how do we get our public_schools to produce and nurture more Duncans ? JOSHUA SPIEGELMAN</TEXT>
