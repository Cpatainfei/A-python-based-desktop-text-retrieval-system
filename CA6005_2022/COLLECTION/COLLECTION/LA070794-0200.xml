   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : GAVIOTA ; CHEVRON TO CHALLENGE DENIAL OF PERMIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chevron Corp . will ask the California Coastal Commission next week to overturn a decision by the commission ' s executive_director to deny the oil_company an emergency permit to ship oil by tanker from Gaviota to Los Angeles . Chevron will request that the commission cast_aside the decision of Executive_Director Peter M . Douglas , who last month turned_down Chevron ' s fifth emergency request to resume tanker shipping . In requesting the permit , the oil_company claimed the Jan . 17 earthquake damaged an oil_pipeline and that the company needs to ship by sea to get its product to Los Angeles-area markets . Douglas said he believed Chevron could not prove an emergency existed since the company has been processing at capacity -- about 80 # 000 barrels per day -- from its Point Arguello fields since the earthquake . A company spokesman said Chevron is still able to produce at capacity levels only because oil is being rerouted through other pipelines at a much higher expense . The company ' s shipping permit was suspended by the commission Feb . 1 after it failed to secure a pipeline with all necessary state permits . Earlier this year , Chevron reached a deal with Pacific Pipeline Inc. to construct a pipeline , but because the project is still undergoing regulatory scrutiny by the California Public_Utilities Commission , it failed to meet the Feb . 1 deadline . Tanker shipping operations were scheduled to cease by Jan . 1 , 1996 . The commission will consider the company ' s request at its meeting Wednesday in Huntington Beach . J.E. MITCHELL</TEXT>
