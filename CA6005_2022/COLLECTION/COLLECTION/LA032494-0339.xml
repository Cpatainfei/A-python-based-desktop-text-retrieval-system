   <HEADLINE> ASSASSINATION WILL ADD TO MEXICO ' S WOES ; VIOLENCE : DEATH OF RULING PARTY CANDIDATE COMPOUNDS ALREADY GLOOMY CONCERNS BY INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The assassination Wednesday evening of Luis Donaldo Colosio , the Mexican ruling party presidential candidate , will aggravate the already serious worries that international investors have had about the nation ' s business climate , experts said . Chief among the concerns is whether the attack on Colosio will prove to be an isolated event or part of a broad campaign of political violence . Investors have been skittish since a bloody New Years Day rebellion by peasants in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas . The specter of &quot; politically motivated violence is something that no one was anticipating at the beginning of this election year , &quot; said Wayne Cornelius , director of UC San Diego ' s Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies . Colosio ' s death will create a &quot; scramble to succeed him &quot; and a &quot; great_deal of uncertainty , &quot; Cornelius added . &quot; The thing most dangerous to U.S. interests , for business and in_general , would be a long period of unrest and sorting things out , &quot; added Colleen Morton , a political_scientist at the Institute of the Americas , a La Jolla-based think_tank . Business development and investment in Mexico &quot; have been slowed_down due_to Chiapis and the election , and things will slow_down further because of this &quot; even if Colosio recovers from the shooting , Morton said . Colosio wasn ' t generally the first choice among international investors as the candidate of the ruling party , known as PRI , to succeed outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . Still , Cornelius said business interests were &quot; quite comfortable &quot; with Colosio . Morton said Colosio was regarded_as highly trained and &quot; part of the modern Salinas economic team. &quot; She said he was expected to continue a policy of liberalizing the economy and &quot; extending the benefits to rural communities and the urban poor. &quot; Colosio , who has served in Mexico ' s Cabinet , strongly supported the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . Wednesday ' s attack follows several weeks of plummeting prices on the Mexican Stock_Exchange -- sparked by concerns about Chiapis . The market began to recover this week , boosted by news that a serious political challenger to Colosio , Manuel Camacho Solis , would drop his presidential bid to focus_on his efforts to negotiate peace in Chiapis .
