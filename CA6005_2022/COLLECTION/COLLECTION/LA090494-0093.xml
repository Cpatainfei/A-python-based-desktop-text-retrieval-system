   <HEADLINE> CONCERN FOR ENDANGERED ANIMALS A MUST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The disheartening plight of the animal_kingdom is only worsened by such low-brow , Neanderthal humor as espoused by Rich Tosches in &quot; An Instinct for Extinction : So Deal With It &quot; ( Aug . 30 ) . As long as people continue to disregard the essential right_to_life belonging_to everything living , we not only will destroy everything external to the human experience but everything internal as well . No explanation can be proffered to justify the writing of this horrific piece . What is next for The Times ? Racial slurs ? WILLIAM ANDREW PEACH Dana Point</TEXT>
