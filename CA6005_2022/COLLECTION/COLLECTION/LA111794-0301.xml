   <HEADLINE> JAUNTS ; TAKE A SPIN AROUND HARBOR ; RENT AN ELECTRIC- POWERED PARTY BOAT FOR A CRUISE . IT HOLDS_UP TO EIGHT PEOPLE , WITH FOOD AND OTHER AMENITIES AVAILABLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The holiday season is almost here and , if you ' re strapped for something new and different to do with visiting relatives , here ' s an idea : Take them for a spin_around the Channel Islands Harbor . So you don ' t have a boat ? No problem . You can rent an electric-powered party boat , take the wheel yourself and cruise the harbor . &quot; We call it the golf_cart of boating , &quot; said Connie Hutson , owner of the 18-foot-long party boat that she rents under the business Easy Cruisin ' . The boat , with its blue awning , holds_up to eight people who can schmooze and picnic while they see the harbor from the water , instead of from the shore . Hutson launched the business in June from Harbor Landing , offering half-hour jaunts for $ 25 or hourlong trips for $ 45 . For $ 70 , she can gussy_up the boat with a food tray , wine and roses for what she calls the romance package . So far , the boat has spawned at least one romance , she said . A young_man surprised his girlfriend with a wedding proposal while on a harbor cruise . He hired an airplane to fly overhead with a banner that read &quot; Marry Me Patty. &quot; &quot; He came_back with a thumbs-up sign and she was beaming , &quot; Hutson said . The idea of piloting an 18-foot boat might sound a little intimidating to anyone who has never driven a boat , much less in a busy harbor of more_than 2 # 000 craft . It is , at first . But the speed_limit in the harbor is only 5 m.p.h. and the boat doesn ' t go any faster than that anyway . &quot; It ' s easy to get_out of the way , &quot; Hutson said . &quot; Even if you bump_into something , it ' s not going fast enough ( to cause much of an impact ) . &quot; So far , that hasn ' t happened , although she worried about it when she first launched the $ 16 # 000 boat . Don ' t expect the roar of an engine when you turn_on the ignition . With the battery-operated motor , the boat hardly makes a sound . Except for a slight vibration , you won ' t know that it ' s really on . That makes_it easier to hear the radio or tapes that Hutson supplies for the cruise . Once on the water , you can ogle the fishing_boats and yachts docked along the shore . You can also explore the many fingers in the harbor and peruse the pricey homes on the water ' s edge . The boat turns_on a dime , so it isn ' t difficult to turn_around at the end of an inlet . Passengers sit on cushioned seats around the bow of the boat and in the stern . Some bring along a picnic lunch or dock in the harbor at several spots if they want to pick_up something . Taking the boat out for a spin carries with it some cautionary rules : You must stay in the harbor , going no farther than the Whales Tail restaurant toward the mouth of the harbor . Stay to the right of other boats , and keep_in mind that sailboats have the right_of_way . If there is a problem , Hutson keeps a cellular_phone on board . Landing the boat at the end of the cruise is a little tricky . You turn_off the engine and coast toward the dock at Harbor Landing . Hutson or one of her crew will be_on hand to help ease the boat alongside the dock . Since Hutson works full time as general_manager of the Mandalay Beach Resort , her daughter , Jodi , helps her run the boat business on the side . Last summer , the boat was in high demand , she said . &quot; We had to turn people away. &quot; During the slower season -- now through February -- the boat is available by reservation seven days a week during daylight hours . Later , in the spring and summer , reservations aren ' t necessary because a crew_member is_on hand during operating hours and the boat is available on a first-come , first-served basis . Why did Hutson get_into the boat business ? &quot; I live at Mandalay Bay and I love the water , so it ' s frustrating if you ' re not a boat owner , &quot; she said . &quot; I looked_into buying a boat , but I didn ' t want the heavy maintenance and I wasn ' t interested in going_into the ocean. &quot; She thought that surely there must be other people like her who want access to a boat without all_the hassle . &quot; I was right , &quot; she said . Details * WHAT : Easy Cruisin ' electric boat rental . * WHERE : Channel Islands Harbor , Harbor Landing on the west_side of the harbor . * WHEN : Daily , during daylight hours , by reservation . * COST : $ 25 for half an hour , $ 45 for an hour . * FYI : For reservations , call 984-4379 . Call one or two days ahead . * ETC. : The boat is available for children ' s birthday_parties . Children under 7 must wear life_jackets provided by the boat owner .</TEXT>
