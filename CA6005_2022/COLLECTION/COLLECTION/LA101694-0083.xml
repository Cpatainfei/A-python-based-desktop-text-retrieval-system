   <HEADLINE> FOCUS ; PREVENTING FILM DECAY ; AMC REELS OFF SECOND CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESERVATION OF CLASSICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The facts are grim . According to film experts , half of the 21 # 000 Hollywood-produced short films and features made before 1950 on highly unstable nitrate stock have been lost forever . The news gets_even worse for films made between 1893 and 1930 -- 75 % of the features have crumbled into dust . But cable ' s American Movie Classics is coming_to the rescue . Last year , AMC and the Film Foundation , the film-preservation organization headed by director Martin Scorsese , presented its First Annual Film Preservation Festival . &quot; Our primary goal was to raise consumers ' consciousness that this art_form was being decayed , &quot; says Kate McEnroe , AMC senior_vice_president and general_manager . &quot; We found a great many people didn ' t understand that . I don ' t think people realized to what extent the films were becoming extinct. &quot; The three-day_event on AMC screened restored and preserved films and raised $ 250 # 000 for the five major American film archives : the UCLA Film and Television Archive , Museum of Modern Art , Library of Congress , International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House and the National Center for Film and Video Preservation at the American Film Institute . The festival was such a rousing success that AMC is presenting its Second Annual Film Preservation Festival beginning Friday and concluding Oct . 24 at 7 a.m. The festival will feature classic Westerns , John Ford films , Gary Cooper movies , nine Cecil B . DeMille epics , Gene Autry movies and a new Autry documentary . &quot; We ' re so delighted that the public is eager to see restored films , &quot; says Mary Lea Bandy , director of the Museum of Modern Art archive . &quot; I think there are lots of people who don ' t know what film preservation means . When they have a chance to see restored films , they ' re excited and grateful and willing to help. &quot; &quot; The thing is a lot of people , when they think_of old movies , somehow think they are movies that somehow are flawed because they have seen them on inferior copies , &quot; says Robert Rosen , director of UCLA ' s archive . &quot; The cinematography and the artistry were wonderful back then. &quot; Bandy says that young audiences finally are appreciating black-and-white films . &quot; People are coming_to understand more and more about movie history , &quot; she says . &quot; They grew_up on color , so to them black_and_white is as far removed as the pyramids. &quot; Each archive received approximately $ 44 # 000 from money raised during the first festival . &quot; It gave us a tremendous boost , &quot; Bandy says . &quot; Our share has gone_into a fund that ' s helping us to complete preservation of films that have been partially preserved and to make new prints so that these films can be widely accessible . What we intend to do with the funding is put it right back into completing preservation work and making prints , so the films can be loaned to other archives and seen on AMC. &quot; Of the films in this festival , 80 % are new titles ; the rest were shown last year . Highlights include a tinted print of the 1903 landmark Western &quot; The Great Train Robbery &quot; ; DeMille ' s 1914 Western &quot; The Virginian , &quot; as well as his 1923 epic &quot; The Ten Commandments &quot; ; four John Ford films , &quot; The Informer , &quot; &quot; Stagecoach , &quot; &quot; My Darling Clementine &quot; and &quot; She Wore a Yellow Ribbon &quot; ; and the restored 1943 Gary Cooper-Ingrid Bergman drama in Technicolor , &quot; For Whom the Bell Tolls. &quot; The festival is presenting two versions of &quot; My Darling Clementine , &quot; the original 1946 release version , preserved by MOMA , and a pre-release version , preserved by UCLA , which had been shown to sneak-preview audiences . The pre-release &quot; Clementine &quot; is approximately 10 minutes longer and has a different ending . &quot; The version everyone knows and the pre-release version are different in many ways after the first reel , &quot; Rosen says . &quot; Reels two through five have different sound mixes . One of them has less music and additional bits of dialogue . It was discovered by our cataloguers who were looking_at this thing and said , ' This one is longer . How can that be ? ' Then when you went_back and looked_at it , not only is it longer , it ' s different. &quot; Each version , Rosen says , has its own validity . UCLA also restored &quot; From Whom the Bell Tolls , &quot; based on the Ernest Hemingway novel . For nearly four decades , only the 130-minute version of the film has been available . &quot; The premiere version had a running time of 170 minutes , plus a 10-minute intermission , &quot; Rosen explains . &quot; A lot of the critics were critical that it was too long . So the director ( Sam Wood ) very quickly made some cuts and brought it down to 156 minutes . What happened is that around 1957 , Paramount reissued the film and shortened it . The pieces of the negative they cut_out were thrown_away and don ' t survive. &quot; The Library of Congress had a copy of the 156-minute version . So UCLA copied the segments which had been discarded and reinserted them into the film . &quot; We did go_back to the concept of having an intermission . We were able to find the original overture and intermission music ( penned by Victor Young ) from a Los Angeles film collector who found the rolls of soundtrack in an old theater projection room. &quot; Most restoration and preservation projects , Rosen says , &quot; rely_on a cooperative relationship with other archives and studios . Preservation is really a collaborative forum , just like film itself is collaborative. &quot; &quot; The Second Annual Film Preservation Campaign &quot; begins Friday at 2 a.m. with &quot; The Great Train Robbery. &quot; THE FULL FEST FRIDAY The Great Train Robbery ( 2 a.m. ) : Edwin S .
