   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : THE NETHERLANDS ; PILGRIMS ' PROGRESS ; IN AMSTERDAM AND LEIDEN , TRACING THE YEARS SPENT IN HOLLAND BEFORE THEY SAILED TO THE NEW_WORLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Standing_in the enormous Dam Square in the center of old Amsterdam , I was tempted to block_out the sounds of the trams , cars and pedestrians ; to envision this most modern of European cities when it was home to the Pilgrims , in the decade before they journeyed to America . My husband and I were here to connect with a part of our American heritage , to travel back to the roots of that most American of holidays , Thanksgiving . We had come_to the_Netherlands to walk in the Pilgrims ' footsteps . In 1608 , a dozen years before the Pilgrims left England to establish New England ' s first permanent settlement in what became Plymouth Colony , they first sought refuge in Holland , in &quot; the Low Countries , where they heard ( there ) was freedom_of_Religion for all men , &quot; according to the writings of Pilgrim William Bradford . Although the Holland of their time proved too liberal for the Pilgrims , during their stay there they absorbed subtle aspects of Dutch ideas and traditions that they brought_to their American home and , eventually , into our lives . The 17th-Century Amsterdam that was the first stop on their journey was the center for an explosion of geographic exploration and international commerce . Established in 1602 , the Dutch East India Co . was trading , among other things , the domestic pottery that made Delft famous , and Ming porcelain from China . The population was cosmopolitan , representing a cross-section of the world , including Germans , Poles , Hungarians , French , Spanish , Muscovites , Persians , Turks and Indians -- most of whom came_to buy and sell . Newcomers camped in temporary shelters outside the city walls while streets were laid and houses erected . Walking through crowded Dam Square and listening to the intonations of an unfamiliar language , it was easy to imagine the confusion of the Pilgrim farmers from pastoral England . The Amstel river flowed freely through the Pilgrims ' Dam Square -- the city ' s heart -- on its way toward the harbor linking it with countries beyond . The Dutch preoccupation with international commerce was reflected in the buildings surrounding the square . Except for the Nieuwe Kerk ( New Church ) and the Town_Hall , the main buildings were warehouses for Dutch traders . * Today ' s Dam Square remains the setting of much of Amsterdam ' s public life . Nieuwe Kerk , first mentioned in_writings from around 1400 , continues to dominate the skyline , although it is now used not for religious purposes but as a public_house where concerts and art_exhibitions are held . Other historic buildings -- including the Town_Hall -- have since disappeared . Perhaps the best place to experience Amsterdam as the Pilgrims found it is in the Amsterdam Historical Museum . Located in a quiet courtyard off Kalverstraat , a_few miles south of Dam Square , in a series of 17th-Century buildings that during the Pilgrim ' s time housed the Civic Orphanage , the museum covers the history of the city from the mid-13th Century to the present and puts Amsterdam ' s past into perspective , making subsequent walks_around town more informative . Although identifying titles are in Dutch , the museum provides booklets with English translations . Yet many exhibitions need little explanation : An illuminated flat plan of the city shows how the city grew ; a light picks_out each 25-year period down through the centuries and simultaneously illuminates the relevant phase of the city ' s growth ; paintings depict the city ' s historic landmarks as they were when originally constructed . Next door is the Begijnhof courtyard : a magnificent diamond-shaped cobblestone collection of 17th-Century buildings . Although the houses are still occupied today , to enter the courtyard is to step back in time . The courtyard was constructed in 1346 as a cloister for Roman_Catholic lay sisters . But in 1578 , when the Reformation swept Holland , all Catholic_churches became Protestant , including the one ( now known as the_English Reformed Church ) standing within the Begijnhof . ( A concealed Catholic_church was subsequently located in one of the houses. ) The passageway connecting the Begijnhof to the Historical Museum is hung with oversize canvas paintings of the Amsterdam civic guard -- a group of marksmen that formed a union for civic defense and to help maintain public order at the end of the 14th Century . They later founded guilds for archers , crossbowmen and men with early firearms . These group portraits , often painted at their annual banquets , hung_in their respective guild houses , like group photos from a reunion . About 50 of these paintings hang here , the largest collection of its kind . The glimpses these enormous paintings offer into the extravagant splendor of the age contrast sharply with the hard life the Pilgrims led in Amsterdam . &quot; For though they saw fair and beautiful cities , &quot; Pilgrim William Bradford later wrote , &quot; flowing with abundance of all sorts of wealth and riches , it was not long before they saw the grim and grisly face of poverty. &quot; Bradford himself , being a man of private means , was exempt from the hardship that befell the majority of the Pilgrims . Excluded from most of the trades by the powerful guild system , the Pilgrims were forced to take_on poorly paid , unskilled work in the wool , leather and metal trades . It was Amsterdam ' s exclusive guild system , compounded by quarrels with other separatist groups such_as the Brownists , another Protestant sect from England , that led the Pilgrims just eight months later to relocate to Leiden , then the second largest city in Holland . The Leiden that Bradford wrote_of as being &quot; a fair &amp; bewitifull citie , and of a sweete situation , &quot; is still palpable 300 years later . Until recently the town was not prosperous , making_it a time_capsule of sorts for experiencing the past . We found the best visual view of Leiden from the Burg , or citadel , an artificial circular mound -- the town ' s only hillock -- and the point where the Old and New Rhines unite at the town ' s center . The Burg is 150 feet in diameter at its summit and crowned by an old brick fort . It looks down on the black-tile roofs of the houses that separate it from the river . The city ' s most conspicuous features survive , including the two great Reformed churches where the Pilgrims were not allowed to worship but under which they buried their dead : St . Pancras , Hooglandsche Kerk ( Church of the Highlands ) and Pieterskerk ( St . Peter ' s Church ) . Leiden University weighed heavily in the Pilgrims ' decision to relocate there . One of their leaders , John Robinson , a Cambridge-educated man , believed the scholarly environment would be sympathetic to their cause . He made a direct appeal_to the Council of Leiden to obtain permission to settle in the city . The council granted them residency on grounds that &quot; they refuse no honest persons free ingress to come and have their residence in this city ; provided that such persons behave themselves and submit to the laws and ordinances. &quot; A copy of that request , entered in the court journal , became among the first in which the group was officially referred to as the Pilgrims . The document is housed in the Leiden Pilgrim Document Center , located behind the Municipal Archives Office on Vliet canal . ( It was from this canal that the Pilgrims left for the port of Delfshaven , where they stayed for a night before departing for England on the Speedwell . In England they boarded the Mayflower for their journey to America in 1620. ) The document is available for viewing upon request . The archives office is an essential stop for those tracing the footsteps of the Pilgrims in Holland . An informative exhibition and slide show explores the Pilgrims ' experience in Holland . Thus prepared_for our walking tour of the city , we left the center guided by a map of important Pilgrim sites that we were given at the Document Center . At the Stedelijk Museum , in what was during the 1600s the old cloth merchants ' hall , the history of Leiden unfolds in exhibitions that depict activities of the various guilds . Rooms furnished and containing beautiful silverware and paintings from the Dutch Golden Age make visitors feel as though they have wandered into a Dutch still-life . Much like these artifacts , old Leiden is a city of domestic beauty . There are no great vistas , except the one from the top of the Burg . Instead , the town ' s charm and history are found in its narrow , curving streets filled with beautiful houses , side_by_side , all different and as individual as their gables -- pointed , stepped , necked , belled . Near the center of the original city is the huge but severely plain Pieterskerk . It was there , wandering on foot along the twisting cobbled , medieval streets surrounding St . Peter ' s Church , that we found ourselves in the Leiden of the Pilgrims . The majority of the Pilgrims lived within a quarter-mile radius of St . Peter ' s . Forbidden to worship in any ordinary church or chapel , the group needed a house large enough to accommodate the several dozen members of the congregation . In 1611 , they acquired land to build the house that became known as Groenpoort ( Green Gate ) , across the Kloksteeg ( Bell Lane ) -- a narrow but important street just across from St . Peter ' s . There , in an area close to the university and reachable from all directions by a web of converging streets , they built Robinson ' s house , as well as 21 one-room dwellings in the courtyard . * The stones of the small square carry the memories of more_than one group of foreigners who were welcomed or , at the least , tolerated . Pesijnhofje , the current house on the property where Robinson ' s house stood , was built_in 1683 as an almshouse for French Huguenots and can still be visited today . Robinson was buried in or near the baptistery of St . Peter ' s . Directly across the street from Pesijnhofje in St . Peter ' s facade is a plaque commemorating Robinson and the sailing of the Pilgrims to the New World . Unlike Amsterdam , Leiden did not have a strict guild system that prevented the Pilgrims from finding work . Records mention the occupations of 86 Pilgrims . While the majority worked in the cloth trade , they were also polishers , ribbon weavers , tobacco workers , pipe makers , stocking sellers , wood sawyers and twine makers -- trades at which these farmers could become skilled with some ease . After 11 years in Leiden , the Pilgrims began preparations to leave . Ultimately , the Dutch had proved too liberal for the Pilgrims . Resistant to their conversion efforts , the Dutch continued a loose observance of the Sabbath and what the Pilgrims saw as a lax discipline of children . Ironically , the very liberalness and tolerance that flourished in the cosmopolitan Dutch republic and that drew the_English Pilgrims were the qualities that ultimately drove them to find a new home_in North_America . The Pilgrims feared assimilation into a general population indifferent to their religious fervor , as their time in Holland lengthened . While some attained modest prosperity , most continued to live_in poverty and hardship . The Pilgrim ' s immigration options were the South_American region of Guiana and a part of the North_American Territory granted in 1606 to the Virginia Company . Negotiations began in 1617 . Three years later , on July 31 , 1620 , the Pilgrims left Leiden on the Speedwell bound for Delfshaven . Their Vliet canal route remains much as it was then , stretching south for a mile and then turning_to the southwest . The distance is 25 miles and probably took six to eight hours . * Chief among the sites to visit in Delfshaven is the Pilgrim Fathers ' Church . There is no hard evidence to support the claim -- prevalent in Holland today -- that the Pilgrims held services there just before their departure from Holland . But whether they actually worshiped in it or not , the Pilgrims have through time become irrevocably linked with this small church . A medallion in one of the stained glass windows commemorates the sailing of the Speedwell , as do memorials erected by such American groups as the Boston Congregational Club . For years , Americans living and working in the Hague , Rotterdam and Amsterdam , were drawn here for Thanksgiving_Day service in such numbers that services had to be relocated to St . Peter ' s in Leiden . Our pilgrimage ended on the bridge_over the canal by which the Pilgrims left Holland -- where old Holland connects to the new , with the great modern port of Rotterdam visible in the distance . Yet the influence of the Dutch did not end with the Pilgrim ' s departure for the New World . The celebration of Thanksgiving and the many political freedoms we hold_dear may never have come_to be had our Pilgrim forefathers not experienced the liberties of the Dutch republic . The leaders organized the colony with ideas derived from both their English heritage and the Dutch experience . The Mayflower Compact ( the Pilgrims ' agreement to establish a government ) established an elected democracy similar to that in which the Pilgrims had participated in Leiden , as members of smaller groups that controlled local affairs , taxes and safety in each of Leiden ' s 143 neighborhoods . To an extent unknown elsewhere at the time , the Dutch constitution was founded upon and adjusted to this foundation of independent local sovereignties , or municipal_governments . The military_leader Miles Standish trained the Pilgrim militia using Dutch drill books . There was no minister in Plymouth Colony and when couples decided to marry , Gov . Bradford took a step unprecedented in English law : They were registered and married in civil ceremonies . He justified his actions by referring to the Dutch law requiring civil registration for marriages of non-members of the Dutch Reform church . While the Pilgrims ' years in Holland were undeniably marked by trials and hardship , the experience exposed our forefathers to concepts of government and customs that we continue to hold_dear today . Like all travelers , the Pilgrims were changed in many ways by their Holland experiences . We were too .
