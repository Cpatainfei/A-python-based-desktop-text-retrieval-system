   <HEADLINE> RECORD RACK : IN BRIEF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * * 1 / 2 The Smithereens , &quot; A Date With the Smithereens , &quot; RCA . The Smithereens ( who headline a benefit_concert Thursday at the Palace ) are too rockin ' and pop-savvy to make a bad album , but after 11 years as a recording band , it ' s apparent that ever-brooding singer Pat DiNizio and gang lack the expansiveness of style and imagination to make a great one. &quot; Date &quot; is another solid , enjoyable effort by smart-pop ' s perpetual B students . New albums are rated on a scale of one star ( poor ) , two stars ( fair ) , three stars ( good ) and four stars ( excellent ) . MIKE BOEHM</TEXT>
