   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : LANDING ON MY FEET ; HIGH-TECH WORKER MAKES RIGHT TURN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I love automobiles and restoring cars . I couldn ' t find anything in my other industry , so on a whim , I presented my resume to ( Honda of Oxnard ) . They told me , &quot; We don ' t understand anything about your resume , but you were successful in the field you were in. &quot; They decided to have me take the two weeks of intensive training and see how I turned_out . Before my training was up , they were shorthanded and sent me out on the lot to deal with the customers , and four hours later , I sold them a car . One of the things that made me reluctant to even try_for this profession was the stigma that car salesmen had . They ' re somewhere in the social pecking_order below lawyers and pond_scum . In any case , I found these people to be creative and sensitive . A couple were irritating beyond belief , and it never ceased to amaze me that they were successful . But by and large I find them really pleasant , intelligent company . We ' ve got a former film editor , a former programmer , a former college professor . The job has its ups and downs , its challenges . A couple of customers have actually written me letters telling me how happy they are with their cars , and that just really pleased me . But times are a little rough right now . The public is looking_at transportation in a whole different way . They are becoming far more practical , not at all frivolous . What I do like about it is that every situation is completely different . The one constant in the automobile business is change . It ' s kind of like the weather in the Midwest : If you don ' t like it , wait five minutes , and it will change completely .</TEXT>
