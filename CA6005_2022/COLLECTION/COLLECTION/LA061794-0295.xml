   <HEADLINE> ' GREEN DARES ' ENTICING COMPANIES TO MAKE LESS WASTE ; ENVIRONMENT : VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS TO REDUCE TRASH MEET LESS RESISTANCE THAN LEGISLATION . PARTICIPATING FIRMS ENJOY GOOD PUBLICITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tell companies they have to cut waste output , and they ' ll likely squawk about costly mandates that hurt profits and squelch expansion . But dangle a_few carrots in front of them , and see how enthusiastic they get : * Forty-six companies large and small touted how they cut a total of 1 billion pounds of garbage since 1990 -- about a year ' s worth of trash at a medium-sized landfill -- in a contest organized by seven Northeastern states . * The Environmental Protection Agency won voluntary agreements from nearly 100 companies to slash waste output and will crown their achievements at a &quot; WasteWise &quot; ceremony . * The winners of another contest in Massachusetts included a company that makes egg cartons from old phone_books and another that ships computer parts in boxes made of recycled paper , and urges consumers to return the boxes for reuse . While proposed legislation to reduce trash meets with resistance from businesses , a surprising counter-trend is emerging : Green dares , or contests that promise positive publicity , can entice companies into making voluntary but substantial reductions in their garbage output . The idea that businesses are more willing to cut trash output if they ' re asked rather than told is growing as governments push for waste reduction instead of new incinerators and landfills . Packaging waste totaled 47 million tons in 1990 , about one-third of all waste in the United States , according to the Coalition of Northeastern Governors , the government group whose annual CONEG Challenge drew 46 companies last year . Procter &amp; Gamble Co. , a leading manufacturer of consumer brands , responded to the contest by saying it boosted the average recycled content in its packages to 36 % . That included using 100 % plastic trash in containers of Ultra Downey and Lemon Comet and 50 % in containers of Tide , Bold and Dash . Another participant , Campbell Soup Co. , said it trimmed the weight of its steel soup cans by a total 4 million pounds and its juice cans by 1.1 million pounds . Baxter Healthcare Corp. , the $ 8.5-billion medical products company , said it cut 11.6 million pounds of packaging since 1990 and plans a 15 % overall reduction by 1995 . It also plans to use more recycled fiber in its corrugated shipping containers , and less chlorine-bleached paper and cardboard in packaging . But support for the companies ' efforts is far from unanimous . Some environmentalists and state officials say the voluntary actions can give companies credit for token measures and help them avoid more meaningful reductions that cost more money . Indeed , the CONEG Challenge is now boycotted by nearly all_the environmentalists initially involved . They dropped_out after businesses refused to support legislation that would have mandated specific reductions and recycled content in packaging . Lacking support from the environmental community , the governors of New England , New York and Pennsylvania instead challenged businesses to voluntarily report on how they ' ve slashed solid waste . The companies get free publicity by complying . The latest 140-page CONEG Challenge report , published last fall , commends participants for their &quot; leadership role &quot; and &quot; commitment to reduce packaging waste. &quot; &quot; You could do a good measure of waste reduction by eliminating the report , &quot; said Resa Dimino , solid waste specialist at Environmental Action Foundation , an environmental group that withdrew from the CONEG Challenge . &quot; The idea you can get government and industry and environmentalists around the table and resolve the issue is just fundamentally flawed .</TEXT>
