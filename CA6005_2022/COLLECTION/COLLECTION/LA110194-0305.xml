   <TEXT> &quot; No person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subject_to discrimination under any educational_program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. &quot; -- Title IX , signed by President Richard Nixon , June 23 , 1972 Bottom_line : Title IX , a federal law , banned discrimination in high_school athletics . Results : Girls ' participation in high_school sports rose nearly 1 # 000 % -- from 294 # 015 in the 1971-72 school_year to a high of 2.98 million in 1977-78 , according to surveys conducted by the National Federation of State High_School Assns . Last year , the survey said the figure fell to 2.12 million , partly attributed to a decline in enrollment . Meanwhile , the number of boys participating in high_school sports went from 3.67 million in 1971 to a high of 4.37 million in 1977-78 ( those Baby_Boomer years ) , back to 3.48 million last year . So that means no discrimination , right ? That means girls are getting the same opportunity as boys to play high_school sports , right ? Well . . . Another survey by the National Federation found that a typical high_school offers eight girls ' sports with 15 teams and 10 boys ' sports with 18 teams . A majority of schools responding indicated an increase in girls ' programs and virtually no increase in boys ' programs . You may have come a long way , baby , but just try to find an athletic director anywhere who will go_on the record saying high_school girls ' sports are getting treated the same as the boys . Lillian Brabander , who retired in 1992 after 29 years as the Estancia High girls ' athletic director -- including 25 as badminton coach -- is a lifetime advocate of girls ' sports . Before there was Title IX , there was the Girls Athletic Assn. , which stressed participation over competition , and having fun over winning . And the girls loved it , Brabander said . Estancia had 350 girls in the program on average . Today , only about 200 girls play_on Eagle teams . Revenue from annual dues -- 50 cents per girl -- and proceeds from an annual car wash provided the program ' s entire budget . Girls supplied their uniforms , the school custodian drove them to away_games on the bus , and parental pressure didn ' t exist . Neither did specialization . &quot; Girls didn ' t practice two hours a day like they do now , &quot; said Brabander , who lives_in Huntington Beach . &quot; They didn ' t play ( one sport ) year-round . The best athletes were all-around athletes . I think it made_for more fun. &quot; When Title IX was signed into law , it signaled a serious turn for girls ' sports . It has had , perhaps , the most impact on college programs . In an attempt to bring their athletic departments closer to compliance with the federal statute , many universities have dropped traditional men ' s programs and added non-traditional women ' s programs so comparable numbers of men and women would have a chance to compete . Cal State Fullerton dropped men ' s gymnastics and women ' s volleyball but was forced to reinstate the volleyball program after the school was found to be in violation of Title IX . UCLA , once a national power in men ' s swimming , no longer fields a team . San Diego State has a women ' s track_and_field program , but not a men ' s program . And USC added women ' s water_polo as a varsity sport this year . Getting_in line with Title IX , at the collegiate level , is a numbers game . Surveys have shown that a majority of operating_budgets are still spent on men ' s teams , and an even larger majority of recruiting funds are spent for male athletes . Accordingly , many women choose not to pursue athletics in college . Fewer opportunities discourage aspiring high_school athletes , who have fewer role_models . Most high_school girls can ' t even look_to their own coaches as role_models . Research last January showed that only 31 % of the varsity head coaching positions for girls ' sports in Orange County were held by women . In large-team sports such_as soccer and track , the percentage is less than a fourth . In an interview with The Times in 1992 , Mark Trakh , then coach of the Brea-Olinda girls ' basketball_team , observed the plight of women ' s coaches in the county : &quot; If you look_around the county and every time there ' s a job opening for a girls ' coach , chances are it will be a walk-on position . If it ' s a boys ' coach , chances are it will be an on-campus teaching position . &quot; When I coach all-star teams , I ' ll ask the players , ' Are girls ' basketball_teams just as important as the boys ' teams on campus ? ' And the kids say , ' No way , are you kidding ? ( Boys ) get the gym . And they care more about the boys than they do us. ' I get that answer 80 % to 90 % of the time . You won ' t get that answer at Brea. &quot; Brea-Olinda , by the way , has won five State championships in girls ' basketball and often outdraws its boys ' team , raising an interesting question : Do high_schools put less money into girls ' sports because people don ' t like to watch them , thus generating less revenue for the school ? Or are these sports less interesting because less money and attention is given to them ? In this installment of Prep Voices , The Times Orange County asks : &quot; Are boys ' and girls ' athletic programs treated equally at the high_school level ? &quot; * No , they are not treated equally . It is improving , but it is taking a painfully long_time . Sports have been so thoroughly male-dominated for so_long that it will be many years in the making before there is true gender equality in high_school sports . The so-called high-profile sports ( ie . football , boys ' basketball , etc. ) will continue to dominate because they are revenue-producing and because most current coaches and administrators grew_up with it just like that . We will most likely have to wait until the post &quot; Title IX Generation &quot; begins to take its place in the ranks of administrative and coaching positions before we can see any appreciable change . The situation is exacerbated by the fact that males have a far greater opportunity to go_on to a professional level than do females . Marc Viens , Long_Beach Public high_schools are doing their best to comply with Title IX . There are plenty of concerned parents and responsible athletic directors watching_over things at the school level . Girls ' athletic programs are thriving and college scholarships are widely available for the boy and girl athlete . Yes , girls ' and boys ' athletic programs are treated equally at the high_school level , but no , they are not treated equally by the media and society . Our society has been geared to men ' s sports since the first Olympics . It cannot change quickly without help . To attain sports gender equity and popularity , two things must happen : First , legislation must provide women ' s sports with more_than equal affirmative-action type funding until parity is reached . And second , a Title IX-type law is needed to prevent sex bias and sex discrimination in the media . Jack Houston , Mission Viejo Girls ' teams at my high_school do not receive nearly as much publicity as all_the male teams do . All-female teams and especially the performing teams , such_as color_guard and dance team , seem to be thought of as inferior to the boys ' teams . Unlike our well-known football_team , we are not supported by the school and seem virtually unknown . Many male athletes are known and revered by the school and community , but how many female athletes do you know of ? Tracy Rivett , Los Alamitos High sophomore Yes , I do believe that boys ' and girls ' sports are treated the same in high_school , at least at Tustin High . I think that Title IX is ruining sports at the college_level . High_school is one thing , college is another . In high_school , they ' re treated fairly and equally . In college , they ' re trying to make_it fair and equal , but it ' s killing the small , minor sports , especially water_polo . A number of universities have dropped men ' s swimming and water_polo . Schools are having to drop other programs , such_as UCI ' s baseball_team and UCLA dropped swimming , etc . But at the high_school level , I feel they ' re treated equally . Tim Salvino , Tustin High_water polo coach I definitely believe that boys ' sports are treated better than girls ' sports just for the simple fact that we had a guys ' basketball_team that was probably 7-15 ( actually , 11-14 ) and a girls ' basketball_team that was 32-1 , and still the guys got treated better than the girls . Derek Henderson , Woodbridge , Class of ' 94 Title IX was passed because the powers that be in high_school and college sports were not treating women ' s sports fairly . The object of Title IX should have been to ensure an opportunity for women in sports . Instead , it is a law that is very unrealistically designed around a quota basis . One premise of Title IX is that unless the percentage of male-to-female athletics or sports teams is not near the ( ratio of ) male-to-female population of the school , then the school is in violation of Title IX . It is unrealistic to believe that under any circumstance the number of women interested in participating in a sports program in high_school or college will ever approach the percentage of males that are doing so . The quota requirement has resulted in schools dropping minor sports for males . This trend has only started and will be magnified in the near future unless Congress changes the approach of this law . Unless this law is amended , it will eventually cause the demise of all male-based non-revenue sports in both college and high_school . Women ' s athletics have realized tremendous growth in recent years , partially because of Title IX , and that needs to be acknowledged . But there are many other factors that have also contributed to this growth . We need leadership at the high_school level to find the appropriate level and programs for women ' s sports , because without this foundation , sports for both males and females will continue to be adversely affected at the college_level . Hopefully , the coaches for both male and female non-revenue sports will band_together to provide this leadership . Without it , the coaches of non-revenue male teams have no future , and the coaches for the female teams will be fighting the coaches from the male teams for their job . Arlyn F . Obert , Huntington Beach We have an incredible disparity in what the boys ' athletics receive at Foothill and what the girls do . As it is right now , there is not one woman ( who is a ) full-time or even part-time P.E. teacher at the school -- they ' re all males . All the large boys ' sports have full-time coaches who have been offered teaching positions at the school . This is the first time in probably seven years that the girls ' basketball program actually has a coach -- who ' s a male -- who ' s been hired to be a teacher . For seven years , they ' ve only offered walk-on ( positions ) and all_the other sports for girls are walk-ons except for the ones that are combined with the boys ' sports . Those male instructors or coaches also have teaching positions at the school . All the boys ' laundry is done , their uniforms are taken_care of and everything . The girls have to do all theirs themselves . All the coaches for the girls ' sports have to be completely responsible_for every aspect of their program , where the boys ' sports have a multitude of staff_members to assist them . The disparity is incredible at our high_school , and it doesn ' t seem to be changing very quickly . It ' s been going_on for a very long_time . Susan Helm , Tustin One thing that I don ' t think is fair is that girls ' cross-country gets made_fun of a lot by football_players , because the guys think they ' re so great and get more attention . Christie McNew , Pacifica High junior In major ways such_as salary and respect for coaches , yes , there is equality . But in many , many little ways , there is not . For example , my high_school girls ' varsity team just this past Thursday had to carry their own water_jugs while the JV boys ' football_team got the water driven to them in a motorized cart . They had five cheerleaders cheering their JV football game while we had no one supporting our varsity girls ' tennis match . This is 1 # 000 % better than the situation was when I was in high_school , so I don ' t complain . I enjoy my work . Donna Judd , Troy High girls ' tennis_coach I believe boys ' and girls ' programs are treated equally . I believe we lose sight of the fact that schools are built for education . If boys ' sports or girls ' sports are played , then the money generated by that individual sport should be spent to pay_for that individual sport -- whether it be the stadium , the equipment that the people use , etc . Because of the tremendous cost , athletics are_on a downhill slide today . I think the institutions are failing to realize why they were built , which is an education purpose , not an athletic purpose . Joe Grothus , Balboa Peninsula As a high_school soccer coach in 1992 , I interviewed for a girls ' head coaching position with a high_school in northern Orange County . The interview took_place in a room with the principal , athletic director and eight to 10 people , mostly men . I was asked why I was applying for the girls ' position when there were three positions open : girls ' head coach , boys ' head coach and boys ' junior varsity . I had not been aware of the boys ' openings and I told them that I wanted to coach girls because they always got the short end of the stick , such_as the muddy field or weakest referee . From coaching girls and realizing the treatment they got , I had become a women ' s rights advocate . I was then asked , if given the job , did I know someone who would coach the girls ' JV for free , as this was not a paid position . I told them no , I did not know of anyone who would coach the girls ' JV for free , and guess what . . . I was not selected for the position . I thought it was quite comical and sad that officials of a high_school would demonstrate such low regard for girls ' equal rights . Roman Kent , Mission Viejo I am an eighth-grader at Doig Intermediate School in Garden Grove . At our school , girls ' and boys ' sports are equal because everything we play , they play too , except football . They play tennis , baseball , soccer , swimming and golf . Guys play these sports too . Sometimes I think girls get better stuff because they get better equipment for sports and we get the old equipment . Michael Lopez , Santa Ana At my high_school , the football_team has held tryouts and girls are equally encouraged to try_out and perform their best at that level and in other sports as well . Our school is not sexually biased . The coaches do give an equal_opportunity to males and females . Everybody is treated fairly . Danny Rosario , University High junior</TEXT>
