   <HEADLINE> ROTISSERIE CHICKEN IS SPRINGING_UP EVERYWHERE ; FOOD : KFC , EL POLLO LOCO , KENNY ROGERS ROASTERS AND BOSTON ARE VYING FOR A PIECE OF THE GROWING MARKET IN O.C.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No chicken in its right mind would cross Brookhurst Street here to get_to the other side -- not with Boston Chicken , Kenny Rogers Roasters , Kentucky Fried Chicken and El Pollo Loco all perched there and crowing about their menus . The sudden proliferation of roasted chicken restaurants at Brookhurst and Garfield Avenue in Fountain Valley -- the newest , a Boston Chicken outlet , opens on Monday -- is indicative_of a boom nationwide as competitors race for a share_in one of the restaurant industry ' s most rapidly growing segments . &quot; Rotisserie chicken is probably the hottest food category in restaurants and supermarkets , &quot; said Steve Provost , a vice_president at Kentucky Fried Chicken , which controls about half of the $ 7-billion market for fried chicken . The PepsiCo subsidiary recently spent more_than $ 100 million to introduce its Rotisserie Gold line at 5 # 000 stores nationwide . But the competition is strong . Kenny Rogers Roasters , which takes its name from the country singer , is run_by John Y . Brown Jr. , a businessman and former Kentucky governor who three decades ago turned Kentucky Fried Chicken into a nationwide chain . And Boston Chicken , which set a Wall_Street record when its stock began trading_in 1992 , boasts a management team top-heavy with executives who helped Blockbuster climb to the top of the video rental market . The high-stakes game of chicken also has a strong West Coast connection . Irvine-based El Pollo Loco holds a good_part of the Southern California market . And Anaheim-based CKE Restaurants Inc. , which owns the Carl ' s Jr . hamburger chain , plans to open as_many as 300 Boston Chicken franchise restaurants in Southern California . Besides those , a host of other eateries also are clucking about their chicken dishes . &quot; It ' s just a great , healthy alternative , &quot; said Curtis Creek , marketing director at Polly ' s Tasty Foods &amp; Pies , a Santa Fe Springs-based chain that serves rotisserie-style chicken from a restaurant at Adams Avenue and Brookhurst Street in Huntington Beach . &quot; The high heat defats the meat but keeps the juice , which gives you great taste. &quot; Great taste and the promise of less fat are an appealing combination . According to the National Restaurant Assn . in Washington , U.S. consumption per capita of chicken and turkey in 1990 for the first time matched those of beef . Consumers still love finger-licking good fried chicken . But while restaurant orders for fried chicken grew at an annual rate of 2 % from 1989 to 1993 , orders for non-fried chicken grew at a whopping 13 % rate . Yet to be seen , KFC ' s Provost said , is &quot; whether it ' s a fad or an enduring trend. &quot; The chains don ' t pitch their chicken as health_food . But they are responding to consumer demand by providing details about the nutritional makeup of their meals . Boston Chicken offers easy-to-read charts that describe the nutritional value of its entrees . El Pollo Loco reports that one of its meals &quot; contains 30 % less fat and 20 % less sodium than a comparable fried chicken meal. &quot; And menu boards at Kenny Rogers Roasters note that several entrees meet the fat , cholesterol and sodium guidelines of an independent company that rates restaurant food . Fad or not , roasted chicken is definitely in favor now . KFC expects first-year sales of Rotisserie Gold to reach $ 750 million . Boston Chicken , which now has 340 restaurants in 23 states , hopes to have 525 by year ' s end . The company , which reported $ 154 million in fiscal 1993 sales , hopes to open as_many as 300 locations in Southern California through its franchise arrangement with the Carl ' s Jr . chain . &quot; We ' re excited because this is good , wholesome food -- food that ' s relatively easy to replicate at many locations , &quot; said Kerry Coin , general_manager of Anaheim-based CKE Restaurants ' Boston Pacific Inc. subsidiary . &quot; And it ' s almost the reverse of Carl ' s ( traffic flow ) because we do most of our business at dinner , while Carl ' s is heaviest at lunch. &quot; A few blocks away from Boston Chicken ' s new restaurant is the first Orange County location for Kenny Rogers Roasters . The company , based in Ft . Lauderdale , Fla. , plans to have 165 stores open in 31 states and five foreign markets by the end of this year , including locations in Corona , Northridge and Palm Desert . It is now readying stores in Santa Ana , Lakewood , Anaheim , Brea , Hemet , Simi Valley , Santa Barbara and Vallejo . Rounding_out the competition is El Pollo Loco , which offers flame-broiled chicken and Mexican-style food at 200 locations in California , Nevada , Arizona and Texas . &quot; We ' re going to compete head-to-head with Boston Chicken , &quot; said Ray Perry , El Pollo Loco ' s chief operating officer . &quot; Our objective is to continue to grow in Southern California through company and franchise development. &quot; Industry veterans El Pollo Loco and KFC are betting that their lower prices will prevail over those of newcomers Boston Chicken and Kenny Rogers Roasters , which offer costlier meals and a wider variety of side_dishes . Perry argues that consumers at Boston Chicken will pay more_than $ 3 for &quot; exactly the same size piece of chicken that we sell for $ 1.99. that ' s what makes me feel we ' ll be able to compete very strongly. &quot; Provost of KFC is also betting that KFC will benefit if roasted chicken proves to be more_than a fad . &quot; Boston Chicken will get Biff and Buffy Yuppie , the couple with the Mercedes that thinks alfalfa is a neat veggie to go_with their meal , &quot; Provost said . &quot; We want Joe and Jane in middle-class America . . . . And there ' s awful lot more Joes and Janes out there. &quot; While chicken ' s popularity is growing in part simply because it tastes good , outlets are also benefiting from consumer demand for more variety in take-home fare . Increasingly , Perry said , consumers are learning that &quot; chicken travels best of all_the quick-service restaurants , including pizza. &quot; According to figures provided by KFC , Americans purchased $ 346 billion in food during 1988 at regular grocery_stores and about $ 155 billion in food that was prepared elsewhere but eaten_at home . Grocery_store purchases rose at a healthy pace to $ 399 billion by 1992 , Provost said , but prepared-food sales zoomed to $ 265 billion . That trend means the chicken restaurants are competing in the broader category of &quot; what the industry is calling the ' meal replacement segment ' than just against each other , &quot; Boston Pacific ' s Coin said . The emphasis increasingly is_on whole meals . Boston Chicken offers a wide array of hot and cold side orders -- including rice pilaf , fresh steamed vegetables and real mashed potatoes -- that are made fresh daily . &quot; We ' re definitely not fast food , &quot; Coin said . While the market is growing , however , observers suggest that the chicken chains may be_due to have their wings clipped . Competitors question whether high-flying Boston Chicken , whose stock soared from $ 20 to $ 48.50 when it went public on Nov . 9 , 1993 , can hit projected double-digit profit_margins . They also question whether KFC , which recently shuffled its top management in a bid to stimulate flat overall sales , can regain its focus . Perry acknowledged that El Pollo Loco , a subsidiary of Spartanburg , S.C.-based Flagstar Corp. , has had to scramble in the face of new competition . &quot; A year ago , I would have said that El Pollo was a dying chain , &quot; Perry said . &quot; But we ' re up and running . we ' ll continue to work this year and next . We now look_like a winner. &quot; Despite the roasted chicken rage , some chains are sticking_with fried food . Atlanta-based America ' s Favorite Chicken is renovating its 2 # 000 Popeyes Chicken &amp; Biscuits and Churchs Chicken restaurants and adding menu items . It dramatically expanded its Southern California presence in recent months as 65 Pioneer chicken takeout stores converted to Popeyes locations . America ' s Favorite declares that it isn ' t going the rotisserie route yet . &quot; We think the jury is still out on roasted chicken , &quot; said Mike Whitten , senior_vice_president of America ' s Favorite Chicken . &quot; But we know that there ' s a tremendous opportunity on the fried chicken segment. &quot; Hold the Grease When restaurant and fast-food customers order chicken , they prefer non-fried varieties . Percentage change in customers ' entree orders : 06 # 30 , 06 # 06 , 06 # 06 , 11 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 Rotisserie , broiled , grilled 20 % 15 % 4 % 4 % 22 % Barbecued 4 % 9 % 13 % 43 % -30 % Fried 4 % 5 % 8 % -3 % No change Sit-down Dining vs .
