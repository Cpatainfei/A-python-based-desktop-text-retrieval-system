   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : GLENDALE ; CAR_SEATS DONATED TO PARENTS OF NEWBORNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Babies born at Glendale Adventist Medical_Center in January will receive a birthday_gift -- a car_seat -- from the Glendale Sunrise Rotary_Club . According to Safe-Ride-USA , 83 % of the infants and children who died in car accidents during the past seven years lost their lives in survivable crashes . Responding to this statistic , the Rotary_Club donated $ 4 # 000 to the hospital toward the purchase of at least 200 infant car_seats . The club will present the check to hospital officials today , and members will be present with car_seat in_hand when the first infant makes his ( or her ) way into the world at Glendale Adventist . &quot; We ' re interested in helping_out the community in any way we can , especially if it means saving a life , &quot; Rotary_Club President Laura Thompson said . Initially setting out_to supply the hospital with a year ' s worth of infant car_seats , the Rotary_Club scaled_down its donation to its present size when it learned that car_seats can be expensive . Members decided to provide_for the 200 to 250 babies expected to be born at Glendale Adventist during January . The club has asked that the hospital require the car_seats to be returned by recipient families when their children have outgrown the seats . Once returned , the Rotary_Club will then send the car_seats to needy families in Central and South_America . ANTONIO OLIVO</TEXT>
