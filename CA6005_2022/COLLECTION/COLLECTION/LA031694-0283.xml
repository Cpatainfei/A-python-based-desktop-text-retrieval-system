   <HEADLINE> INMATES FLEE BRAZIL PRISON ; HOSTAGES INCLUDE CARDINAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Knife-brandishing inmates overpowered guards and seized Cardinal Aloisio Lorscheider , a cleric who was once regarded_as a candidate for the papacy , in a prison uprising Tuesday in Fortaleza , a city on Brazil ' s northeastern coast , police said . Two inmates died in a shootout during the hostage-taking , and at least two prison_guards were wounded , authorities said . After 12 hours of tense negotiations , police agreed to provide weapons and a getaway car and turn_off the lights outside the prison in exchange for the release of most of their 12 hostages , including Lorscheider . But the 11 inmates left only one hostage -- a wounded prison_guard -- behind when they departed the maximum-security Paulo Sallasate Prison . &quot; The cardinal and the other hostages are in great danger , &quot; said police Sgt . Luis Gonzaga da Costa Neto by telephone from Fortaleza . &quot; These men are heavily armed and have broken their word. &quot; Police said the trouble began around 11:45 a.m. Tuesday when the inmates jumped prison_guards , wrestled away their weapons and grabbed Lorscheider and others who were visiting the prison at the invitation of a church commission . A Brazilian television crew filming the visit showed one prisoner pouncing on Lorscheider . He held a knife to his neck , then threw him to the ground , while others overpowered guards and took hostages . Besides Lorscheider , the prisoners were holding two auxiliary bishops , a federal legislator , Roman_Catholic lay workers , a policeman and two photojournalists . Authorities feared for the health of the cardinal , who is 69 and has undergone cardiac bypass operations . Despite the initial scuffle and hours of tension-filled negotiations that followed , he was unharmed , police said . Though uprisings are frequent in Brazil ' s troubled prison system , rarely has there been such an illustrious hostage . Lorscheider , one of five active Brazilian cardinals , has long been an important voice in the Brazilian Conference of Bishops ; he twice has served as president of the group , which is the largest in the Catholic world with 373 bishops . He is now archbishop of Fortaleza , a city of 1.8 million and the capital of Ceara state . A powerfully built man with a surprisingly soft voice and snow-white hair , Lorscheider , of Brazilian-German descent , became a bishop in 1962 and was named cardinal in 1976 . He was widely regarded_as a strong candidate for Pope in 1978 after the death of Paul VI . But Lorscheider was excluded then because of his fragile health , and John Paul I succeeded Paul VI . Lorscheider rose to prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s when he spoke against the hard-line military regime that ruled Brazil . A champion of the poor and a critic of the dictatorship , he received several death threats and was briefly jailed by the military in 1968 . Lorscheider was visiting the Fortaleza prison in part to investigate reports of abuse against several of its 485 inmates .</TEXT>
