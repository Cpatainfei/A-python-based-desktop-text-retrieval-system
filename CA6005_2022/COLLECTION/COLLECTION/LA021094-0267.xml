   <HEADLINE> ELECTRONIC ARTS WILL ACQUIRE BRODERBUND ; MERGERS : $ 400-MILLION DEAL BETWEEN THE COMPANIES REFLECTS THE CONSOLIDATION TREND IN MULTIMEDIA SOFTWARE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the biggest merger for the emerging home multimedia software industry , Electronic Arts said Wednesday that it will acquire Broderbund Software Inc. in a stock swap valued at about $ 400 million . The deal reflects the consolidation that has already begun in the multimedia software industry as technological advances and the potential for huge market growth lure big players such_as Sony , Time Warner , Disney and Microsoft into a business previously reserved for smaller , lesser-known game developers . The advent of more sophisticated , highly realistic graphics and video on compact_discs known as CD-ROMs are expected to lead to an explosion in the entertainment and educational software market . Such technology is seen as the forerunner to the interactive television programming to become available on the much-ballyhooed information superhighway . San Mateo , Calif.-based Electronic Arts , best known for its line of sports games such_as John Madden Football and PGA Golf , is the nation ' s largest publicly traded developer of interactive entertainment software in the United States . Broderbund , based in Novato , Calif. , dominates the growing educational software market , with its popular Carmen Sandiego series and CD-ROM titles such_as Just Grandma and Me . Analysts said the two companies would complement each other ' s strengths . Electronic Arts , which published over 200 titles last year for video_game machines and personal_computers , has been weak in the educational-entertainment software field known as edutainment . Broderbund , with annual revenue of $ 96 million last year , compared to Electronic Art ' s $ 400 million , will have more financial_backing to experiment and expand its aging product_line . And at a time when the industry is getting increasingly competitive , the merger will create a powerful sales and distribution network with the leverage to command much-coveted shelf space at retail outlets such_as Blockbuster video stores and Wal-Mart , where interactive software is making inroads . But bigger is not necessarily always better , cautioned David Readerman , an analyst with Lehman Bros . Recruiting and retaining talented programmers , for example , may be more difficult . In the deal , Broderbund will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Electronic Arts . Broderbund ' s stock rose $ 3.75 a share to $ 41.25 trading Wednesday , after gaining $ 2 on Tuesday and $ 1.75 on Monday . Electronics Arts shares fell 75 cents a share to $ 25.50 on Wednesday . The deal was announced after the close of trading . Both trade on Nasdaq .</TEXT>
