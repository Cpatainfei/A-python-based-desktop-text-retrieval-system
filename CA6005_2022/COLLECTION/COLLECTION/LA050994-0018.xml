   <HEADLINE> ENDING PAIN SHOULDN ' T MEAN ENDING LIVES ; SUICIDE : COURT DECISIONS REFLECT POPULAR FEARS , NOT NECESSARILY TRUE , ABOUT SUFFERING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two court decisions -- a jury verdict in Michigan and a constitutional ruling by a federal judge in Washington state -- have raised the stakes in our national debate on euthanasia . A Michigan jury ' s acquittal of Jack Kevorkian last Monday was shocking to many of us who believe_in the rule_of_law . The state had a clear statute against assisting a suicide and the defendant openly confessed his involvement . But Kevorkian and his attorney wove a web of confusion around this simple case . Jurors ultimately said they weren ' t sure in what county the death took_place or whether Kevorkian intended to cause death . All they knew was that he tried to end the victim ' s suffering . Judge Barbara Rothstein ' s decision on Tuesday that Washington state ' s law against assisted suicide is unconstitutional displayed even more confusion . The judge compared physician-assisted suicide to abortion and to the refusal of life-sustaining treatment , arguing that it should have equally strong legal protection . Oddly , she then proceeded to claim that &quot; assisted suicide &quot; decisions could be tightly regulated to apply only to competent , terminally ill adults who voluntarily choose to kill themselves . This made no sense in light of the legal precedents she chose . Ever since it was made a constitutional &quot; right &quot; in 1973 , abortion has existed without meaningful qualification . And the right to refuse treatment , wherever it is treated as a constitutional right , also extends far beyond &quot; terminally ill &quot; patients . In both areas of law , mentally incompetent patients routinely have their rights exercised for them by others -- even if they themselves never expressed any preference in the_matter . Courts , guardians and families frequently use &quot; substituted judgment &quot; to make treatment decisions for unconscious patients . The same happens with abortion . In Rothstein ' s own state of Washington , just a_few months ago , a court_ordered a second-trimester abortion for a mentally_retarded woman , arguing that &quot; the normal woman under these circumstances would have an abortion. &quot; Will we have long to wait before judges decide when it is &quot; normal &quot; to have euthanasia and to act accordingly ? These decisions have little to do with personal freedom and much to do with a certain way of thinking_about human life . In both cases , everyone claimed to be trying to prevent suffering . Rothstein even said that the state has no legitimate interest in preventing suicide by terminally ill patients because &quot; preventing suicide simply means prolonging a dying person ' s suffering. &quot; The attitude that suffering has no possible value or meaning -- and more , that human lives that include suffering have no value or meaning -- is popular in our comfort-loving , pain-free society . In some areas of life , we appreciate the need to accept and overcome hardships -- &quot; no pain , no gain , &quot; say our fitness gurus . But when it comes_to dying , we are afraid of pain , of being dependent_on others and of losing our dignity . Those fears have been aggravated by some of the excesses of modern high-technology medicine . But it need not be so . No one should imagine that our only alternative to legalized euthanasia is pain-wracked and horrible death , though that is what the euthanasia movement wants us to believe . The kind of care exemplified in the hospice movement is a compelling answer to the slogans of euthanasia advocates . This care does not involve unduly prolonging life for people with terminal illnesses . But through effective pain control , nursing_care and simple human compassion , it helps people to live with dignity for as long as they are with us . This is not to say that we can be guaranteed a death without suffering -- just as no one is guaranteed a life without suffering . But suffering can be kept_in human bounds . It can be faced with dignity and courage , and it need not be faced alone . Christians , in particular , believe that loving acceptance of suffering can lead to enormous personal growth . We agree with the psychologists who have called the dying process the final stage of human growth . But we also believe_in acting to relieve needless suffering . The Good_Samaritan , who instinctively responded with healing and comfort when he saw a neighbor in need , is a model for all_of us . Otherwise , a radically different and destructive response to suffering will become the norm in our confused society . Says Dr. Joanne Lynn , a specialist on care_for the aging : &quot; It is an outrage for us to seriously discuss killing the sufferer rather than relieving the suffering. &quot; That outrage must be fought . People who affirm life and love from within their suffering are doing the most important work_on Earth . Their lives and their struggles are filled with far more meaning than the petty day-to-day activities that we call &quot; productive &quot; work . It ' s about time we said so , before our most meaningful citizens are shuffled off into Jack Kevorkian ' s van .</TEXT>
