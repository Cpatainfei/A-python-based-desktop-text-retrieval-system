   <HEADLINE> WILL WIRELESS LICENSE AUCTION SELL SOME INTERESTS SHORT ? ; TECHNOLOGY : CRITICS ASK WHETHER IT ' S WISE TO SELL THE AIRWAVES WITHOUT SEEING WHO MIGHT BEST SERVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Visions of a booming mass market in wireless communications have lured some of the biggest names in technology to the nation ' s capital this week to ante_up millions of dollars in the government ' s first auction of the airwaves . On Monday , the Federal Communications Commission will begin soliciting bids for 10 nationwide licenses for a new paging technology called narrow band personal communications service . It will also start auctioning about 600 licenses for a new wireless service_called Interactive Video and Data Service ( IVDS ) that will allow viewers to respond to broadcast and cable programming . The event , widely viewed_as a litmus test of the value of wireless communications to the emerging information highway , is the first of a series of controversial license sales expected to generate $ 7 billion to $ 10 billion for the federal_government over the next five years . Such sums would rival what Uncle_Sam has raised over the past 40 years selling government offshore oil drilling rights . The narrow-band PCS and IVDS auctions are the forerunners for the sale next year of licenses for even more advanced wireless services . One is called broad-band PCS , a cellular_phone competitor that will offer two-way voice and data transmission through small , lightweight transceivers . The other is multipoint distribution service , a cellular-style video service that can provide interactive TV , data transmission and telephone_service . Experts believe the increasingly mobile American work_force -- and the proliferation of ever-more-powerful portable_computers -- will fuel demand for always-in-touch communications . Clinton_Administration officials , including Commerce_Secretary Ronald Brown and Vice_President Al Gore , have championed wireless technologies as a source of hundreds of thousands of new jobs and increased American competitiveness . Experts say the wireless industry will mushroom into a $ 40-billion-a-year business with more_than 90 million subscribers by the year 2004 . &quot; We ' re talking here about actually building a fast_lane on the information superhighway -- a technology that will be major part of the wireless networks of the future , &quot; said Reed E . Hundt , chairman of the FCC . &quot; This will be the biggest government auction in terms of sheer revenue generated. &quot; Hundt added that because of special bidding incentives offered to encourage disadvantaged groups , the auction will also &quot; be the single most important economic opportunity made available to women or minorities in our country ' s history. &quot; The lofty expectations have overshadowed some critics ' concerns about whether it is wise for the federal_government to sell a public resource such_as the airwaves to private companies without determining which provider might best serve the public interest -- the standard applied to broadcasters and common_carriers such_as telephone_companies . Questions also have been raised about whether women , minorities and small businesses will genuinely be beneficiaries of the auction . In the past , the FCC has allocated communications licenses by lottery or by administrative_hearings that compared competing applicants on the basis of ability to serve the public interest . So the prospect of an auction has not pleased critics who believe the Clinton_Administration is looking_at the FCC as a high-tech cash_cow . &quot; I don ' t think the ( rules ) go_far enough to ensure there is going_to be real diversity of ownership , &quot; said Jeff Chester , executive_director of the Center for Media Education , a Washington , D.C. public interest_group . The new wireless technology , he added , looks as if &quot; it ' s going_to end_up in the hands of the present media industry. &quot; But some would-be entrepreneurs disagree . Tony Batiste , a former Washington-based investment_banker , is among the nine minority , women and small business PCS bidders hoping to get_in on the ground_floor of the telecommunications revolution . &quot; There is this idealism that we all have -- that minorities participating in this capitalist system can improve their lives , &quot; he said . &quot; You can ' t think you will be a millionaire tomorrow but it will be a great opportunity. &quot; The potential payoff of wireless technology has not been lost on some of telecommunications ' heaviest_hitters , either -- companies such_as Microsoft , AT &amp; T , Motorola and BellSouth . They are bidding on licenses through subsidiaries or have formed alliances with many of the 29 narrow-band PCS and 472 IVDS bidders who have already submitted deposits to the FCC totaling $ 30 million . The contestants hope to add a new interactive dimension to TV watching as well as_to transform electronic pagers -- now mostly identified with doctors , salespeople and drug dealers -- into a consumer product . Microsoft has teamed with Mobile Telecommunications Technologies Corp . in hopes of targeting &quot; mobile professionals &quot; with a narrow-band PCS service that will offer two-way messaging to users of laptop_computers and special paging devices . AT &amp; T , through its venture_capital unit , has joined with Cell Net Data Systems of San Carlos to try and get PCS licenses for providing consumer paging as well as two-way communications for commercial equipment-monitoring . Proponents foresee the day when parents routinely use pagers to keep_in touch with their children . Businesses might use them to lower the cost of monitoring everything from security_systems and utility meters to vending_machines and other devices whose status can now only be gleaned through periodic -- but expensive -- on-site visits . &quot; Pagers aren ' t a status symbol like cellular_phones ; the industry hasn ' t done a good job of marketing them as a consumer product . . . , but I think that will change &quot; with the advent of competing nationwide paging systems , said Stan Williams , director of corporate development for New York-based CCI Data Inc. , which plans to participate in Monday ' s auctions . Narrow-band PCS will improve on today ' s pagers by allowing them to become smaller and more powerful and by allowing the devices to acknowledge electronically that a message has been received . PCS pagers will also be able to send and receive data . TV , too , will gain flexibility with IVDS , which uses radio_waves and satellites to provide an electronic return path that viewers can use to respond to what they watch on television . The system , which will connect to TVs through a set-top box and display on-screen icons to prompt viewers , offers a rudimentary but low-cost way to provide interactive television . Despite the promise of the two new technologies , some experts warn of a huge shakeout in the wireless industry a_few years from now . Prices for existing paging services , they note , have already begun to decline in anticipation of PCS . And following a recent award of wireless services in Britain , one of the victors gave_back its license to the government , saying the market was not big enough to support four players , according to Lawrence Hickey , an analyst at First Analysis Corp . in Chicago . Once PCS is up an running in the U.S. , local markets may be choked with up_to 10 wireless competitors apiece : two existing cellular_phone providers , seven PCS providers and a new wireless mobile communications service that ' s being launched by MCI Communications Corp . and Nextel Communications Inc. of Rutherford , N.J. When the Lexington , Mass.-based consulting_firm Mercer Management asked industry executives this spring how many wireless competitors each market would still have a decade from now , the consensus estimate was three . &quot; A lot of new ( wireless ) capacity is about to come_on line , and there could be some fallout , &quot; said R . Preston McAfee , a University of Texas economics professor who is an an expert on auctions . &quot; The key to survival of the industry is going_to be finding new uses for &quot; paging services . Although none of the bidders contacted by The Times would comment on its bidding strategy , companies such_as Paging Network Inc. of Dallas have indicated that they will be aggressive bidders . The PCS bids will be entered on computer terminals and conducted in simultaneous multiple rounds . That means participants will have the opportunity to raise their initial bids in subsequent rounds or drop_out of competition should circumstances warrant . The IVDS auctions will be conducted in old-fashioned style , where participants shout their bids to an auctioneer . The 10 nationwide narrow band PCS licenses are expected to fetch around $ 4 million to $ 6 million apiece . The IVDS licenses , because they only offer regional coverage , will go_for much less . But the price of the licenses will just be the beginning of the huge capital_expenditures that will be required to get the wireless technologies up and running . Williams of CCI Data Inc. said that each of the transponders required to gather and transmit paging signals costs more_than $ 30 # 000 ; thousands will be required to provide nationwide coverage . Microsoft and MTel have estimated that their nationwide system will cost at least $ 150 million . &quot; I think you have to be very pragmatic about this going in , &quot; said Larsh Johnson , vice_president of product development at Cell Net Data Systems . Though his partner AT &amp; T has deep pockets , Johnson said he has been especially careful to prepare himself emotionally for the auction . &quot; Some investors have been enamored by the media hype , but others who have been in the business awhile and . . . know the challenges people face , &quot; he said . &quot; I know my limits ; I ' m not going_to get swept_up in the hype. &quot; Dividing the Airwaves Radio_waves of varying widths , or frequencies , are used to carry different kinds of communications signals , from radio and television broadcasts to cellular_telephone calls to satellite communications . On Monday , the Federal Communications Commission will begin auctioning a portion of this spectrum -- with frequencies between 1 # 850 megahertz and 1 # 990 megahertz -- to be used for new telephone and paging systems known as Personal Communication Services . Aeronautical beacons ( 3 Mhz ) TV channels 2-4 ( 54-72 Mhz ) TV channels 5-6 ( 76-88 Mhz ) FM radio_stations ( 88-108 Mhz ) TV channels 7-13 ( 174-216 Mhz ) TV channels 14-69 ( 470-806 Mhz ) Cellular phones ( 824-893 Mhz ) Radio_frequencies to be auctioned ( 1 # 850-1 # 990 Mhz ) Maritime radio navigation ( 2 # 900-3 # 000 Mhz ) Source : National Telecommunications and information Administration .
