   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; WHEN THE PROSECUTOR IS GUILTY ; A FLURRY OF MISCONDUCT CLAIMS HAS RAISED CONCERN ABOUT ROGUE GOVERNMENT ATTORNEYS WHO BREAK THE RULES TO WIN CONVICTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Early in the so-called Goldfish heroin case , Assistant U.S. Atty . Eric Swenson toasted his star witness , Wang Zong Xiao , at a banquet held by Chinese police in Shanghai . The moment was historic ; the mood buoyant . For the first time , the People ' s Republic_of_China and the United States were working together to staunch the flow of narcotics from Asia . But Swenson , the federal prosecutor who would try the high-profile case in San Francisco , might just as well have raised a glass of brandy to his own failure . After months of hearings , U.S. District Judge William H . Orrick ruled_in October that Swenson illegally covered_up important evidence that cast serious doubt on his case . The evidence indicated that before Xiao was flown to San Francisco to testify , Chinese detectives tortured him for days , obtaining statements that grew more incriminating with each poke of an electric cattle prod . Just as devastating to the government ' s case was Orrick ' s other main conclusion : When Xiao created an international furor by revealing in court that he had been tortured , the prosecution illegally tried to deport him to China where , the judge believed , Xiao would have been executed . Since then , the 51-year-old prosecutor has been_on administrative leave pending the outcome of a Justice_Department investigation . &quot; The facts show such clear , flagrant and shameful constitutional violations that they shock the conscience of the court , &quot; Orrick said in a 59-page ruling that blocked Xiao ' s deportation and excoriated the government ' s conduct . Swenson and his colleagues are supposed to wear the white hats in the criminal justice system as the impartial seekers of truth and fairness -- not just guilty verdicts . Most federal and state prosecutors do just that . But judging by a flurry of court rulings in recent years , unethical behavior by prosecutors is becoming a significant legal issue and a source of embarrassment for U.S. and district_attorneys whose prosecutors have been hit with misconduct findings . &quot; This is one of the most disturbing developments in the last 20 years , &quot; said Pace University law professor Bennett L . Gershman , a former state prosecutor in New York who has written extensively about the ethics of those entrusted with prosecuting crimes . Undeterred by the courts or the threat of professional discipline , more and more advocates for the people have become the legal_profession ' s rogues , Gershman and other scholars say . Their botched prosecutions , they say , have squandered law_enforcement resources , wasted millions of taxpayers ' dollars on cases that had to be retried , and threatened the constitutional right to a fair trial . But prosecutors say that serious ethical breaches do not happen very often , and the rash of complaints is partly caused by defense_attorneys more aggressively seeking tactical advantages . &quot; I don ' t think our ethics have been reduced , &quot; said San Diego County Chief Deputy Dist . Atty . Brian E . Michaels , a longtime member of the California District_Attorneys Assn . ethics committee . &quot; There may be more sensitivity to this today . That is why more of this is getting caught. &quot; Such unethical behavior is known as &quot; prosecutorial misconduct. &quot; It refers to any act that gives the government an unfair advantage in a criminal case or interferes with a defendant ' s constitutional rights . To keep the playing_field level , the law demands that prosecutors be more_than mere advocates for one side . Unlike the defense , they must reveal unfavorable aspects of their cases to opponents , especially evidence pointing to innocence . As a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision put it almost 60 years ago , the prosecution ' s role &quot; is not that it shall win a case , but that justice shall be done . . . . While ( prosecutors ) may strike_hard blows , ( they ) are not at_liberty to strike foul ones. &quot; Appeals courts have ruled that prosecutors cannot distort evidence or present false information , deliberately or inadvertently . Personal attacks on the defense in front of a jury are not allowed , nor is any tactic , like allusion to the Bible , that encourages jurors to decide cases on factors unrelated to the evidence . Prosecutors can ' t call the opposing lawyer a &quot; slob &quot; or the defendant &quot; egg-sucking , chicken-killing gutter trash. &quot; Judges have chided prosecutors for using such language within earshot of the jury . Digressions from the rules are wide-ranging , and they can have various impacts on the outcome of a criminal case . For example : * Two Orange County murder_convictions , obtained during a costly three-week trial in 1991 , were overturned last year because the prosecution withheld from the defense a witness ' statements that tended to exonerate the accused . In February , an appeals court cited the same deputy district_attorney , Jeoffrey L . Robinson , for misconduct during the trial of a surgeon convicted of attacking actor John Wayne ' s daughter . The verdict was reversed partly because of the prosecutor ' s litany of improper suggestions to the jury that the defense_attorney had fed them a pack of lies . Robinson , who has since gone_into private practice , has denied any wrongdoing . * In Bakersfield , an appeals court concluded in 1990 that it would &quot; take literally hundreds of pages to list the misconduct &quot; of Kern County Deputy Dist . Atty . Andrew Gindes , who prosecuted a complicated child molestation case involving seven victims . The court cited Gindes for personal attacks on the defense , improper questioning of witnesses and trying to get inadmissible evidence before the jury . The convictions of all five defendants , some of whom received 300-year sentences , were thrown_out , and the case was never retried . Gindes , who is no longer with the district_attorney ' s office , could not be located for comment . * The Los Angeles County Grand_Jury concluded in 1990 that for years the district_attorney ' s office tolerated suspected perjury by jailhouse informants as a way to win cases , including murder trials . Often , deals made with informants in exchange for their testimony were concealed from judges or juries . Assistant Dist . Atty . Dan Murphy said the office disagreed_with the grand_jury ' s findings . Although new safeguards were developed for using informants , he said , the office agreed to retrials in only a_few cases . * A former Imperial County deputy district_attorney admitted having an affair with a key witness while prosecuting a much-publicized attempted murder case from El Centro . The witness was the girlfriend of one of the defendants . It was &quot; a sordid little scenario , &quot; state appeals court justices said in a decision . No convictions were reversed , because a lower court judge went_to great lengths to uncover the transgressions before trial , enabling the defense to use the tryst to challenge the woman ' s testimony . Besides the court cases , a San Diego County Grand_Jury is investigating the district_attorney ' s handling of a controversial child molestation case that ended in the acquittal of Dale Akiki last year . Dist . Atty . Ed Miller faces accusations that he filed charges at the behest of a prominent San Diego businessman who was related to one of the alleged victims . In addition , his office has been accused of withholding evidence from the defense indicating that another person might have committed the crimes . The person was a convicted child_molester and a co-worker of Akiki at a church day_care_center . A spokesman for Miller said there were doubts that the other person was responsible_for the crimes and that the district_attorney decided to proceed with the case well before discussing the_matter with the businessman . Nationally , a spate of recent misconduct findings in several high-profile federal cases helped prompt U.S. Atty . Gen . Janet Reno to review Justice_Department procedures for handling complaints about its lawyers . Although Reno defends the integrity of the government ' s attorneys , she vowed to make the system more open and to add staff to handle a backlog of formal complaints . She was reacting to increasing concerns raised by judges , defense_lawyers and Congress about what they thought was misconduct by federal prosecutors , and a failure of the Justice_Department to thoroughly investigate misconduct allegations . In perhaps the most flagrant example to come_to_light , Justice_Department lawyers were shown to have concealed evidence for 12 years that eventually exonerated John Demjanjuk , a retired Cleveland auto worker who had been found guilty in Israel of being &quot; Ivan the Terrible , &quot; a Nazi concentration_camp guard . The evidence , along with a memo warning of unethical behavior in the case , was never turned_over to the defense or to Israeli prosecutors , who discovered its existence only after Demjanjuk was sentenced to death . &quot; From Idaho to Chicago to San Francisco these cases are popping_up all_over the country , &quot; said U.S. District Judge James Ideman , who found that government attorneys had used a known perjurer to obtain a grand_jury indictment in a Los Angeles racketeering case three years ago . &quot; The thinking of some of us on the bench is perhaps this is a symptom of a Justice_Department that is out of control. &quot; A computer count of published decisions by the state Supreme Court , state appeals courts and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals indicates that prosecutorial misconduct has been raised as an issue on appeal more_than ever since 1980 . In state courts , about 75 % of appeals alleging misconduct over the last 50 years have been filed since 1980 . The U.S. 9th Circuit addressed more cases from California containing misconduct allegations from 1991 to 1994 than in the entire previous decade . From 1980 to 1990 , there were about 100 ; from 1991 to the present , about 140 . An electronic search could not determine how often allegations were sustained . But appeals court records show that convictions are upheld in the vast majority of cases that contain misconduct as at least one issue . A national study of 400 people wrongfully convicted of death_penalty offenses over the last 50 years found that about 15 % to 20 % of the cases involved unethical and illegal conduct by prosecutors , including subornation of perjury and mishandling evidence . Northeastern University in Massachusetts published the study in 1992 . State Bar of California officials say they have seen a slight increase in complaints against prosecutors , but they attribute the increase to a 1990 law requiring state courts to report attorney wrongdoing that results in reversals or judgments . Similarly , the latest available statistics from the Justice_Department show that the number of misconduct complaints rose from 95 in 1987 to 114 in 1990 , a 20 % increase . But the number dropped to 61 for the first nine months of 1991 . Officials say the majority of complaints involve prosecutors . Defense_lawyers suspect that considerable misconduct , especially failure to disclose evidence favorable to the accused , goes undetected . What surfaces does so almost by accident or because of an anonymous tip . Legal scholars blame the situation on many things , from overzealousness in a good cause to a win-at-all-costs attitude that , some veteran attorneys say , is more prevalent than it was 20 years ago . High on the list of explanations is an arrogance resulting from the enormous power Congress and state_governments have bestowed on prosecutors since the 1970s to fight drug trafficking and white-collar crime . That has coincided with attempts by the federal_government to exempt its prosecutors from state rules of professional conduct , and court decisions that have upheld laws protecting prosecutors from civil lawsuits for certain types of unethical behavior . All of this , said Pace University ' s Gershman , has created a special class of attorney , often immune from professional discipline or liability except in the most heinous cases . In many cases , appeals courts have found serious misconduct , but have been hesitant to overturn the verdicts because the evidence appears strong enough to support a conviction . Such situations are known as &quot; harmless error. &quot; Some say it has created an incentive for prosecutors to push the envelope of acceptable behavior . &quot; If you can win cases with misconduct , why not take the chance of losing on appeal once in a while , &quot; said Santa Ana defense_lawyer William J . Kopeny , who estimates that about 40 % of his appeals involve misconduct allegations . Of 15 state and federal prosecutors found by California trial_judges and appeals courts to have committed serious misconduct since 1980 , nine have come under investigation by the State Bar . Two cases remain open . Six did not result in any discipline serious enough to be disclosed to the public , although the Bar can privately warn attorneys , put them on informal probation or require them to take ethics courses . The only one publicly disciplined was former San Diego County Deputy Dist . Atty . L . Forrest Price , who received a two-year suspension in 1982 . Price altered taxi records to make_it appear that a driver had dropped_off the accused in the area where two murders occurred . He tried to cover_up his actions by offering the defendant a lower sentence if he would drop his appeal . State Bar officials recommended that Price be disbarred , but state Supreme Court justices decided to suspend him , noting that he had been under stress from working long hours for several years . &quot; Because of the enormous power of prosecutors , the State Bar should have its antenna out for prosecutorial misconduct -- but I don ' t think it does , &quot; said Robert C . Fellmeth , a professor at the University of San Diego Law_School , who led the effort to reform attorney discipline in California . &quot; I would like a system where if attorneys lied , something would happen to them. &quot; Prosecutors and State Bar officials say the Price case , and recent court findings of misconduct , show that the system works well in ferreting_out unethical behavior . The critics &quot; ignore the penalties that occur when serious misconduct is found , &quot; said Michaels of the San Diego County district_attorney ' s office . &quot; I have seen severe sanctions imposed . There are cases where prosecutors have been terminated . If you ever wanted to be a judge , kiss your application goodby. &quot; Prosecutors across the state also say that much has been done_in the last 20 years to ensure that convictions are obtained fairly . Ethics courses are required each year , and manuals and hot_lines have been made available by the California District_Attorney ' s Assn . Three years ago , the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office created a professional responsibility unit to hold ethics seminars and advise deputy district_attorneys . As the only office of its kind in the state , it has turned_into a resource for prosecutors across California . &quot; Today , we have ethics courses , better training and a vastly improved disciplinary system , &quot; said Robert P . Heflin , the chief trial counsel for the State Bar of California . &quot; Twenty-five years ago when I started practicing law , this stuff was not going on. &quot; Yet some law professors and leaders in the defense bar believe that more needs to be done . Some say that prosecutors need better training , and the power to discipline prosecutors should be removed from state bar associations and given to an independent agency that would work like a police review board , or the state commissions that investigate misconduct by judges . &quot; There ought to be a national summit conference on this , &quot; said John_Henry Hingson III , an Oregon attorney who is president of the National Assn . of Criminal Defense_Lawyers . &quot; We have been shouting at each other for too long . There is distrust on both sides. &quot;</TEXT>
