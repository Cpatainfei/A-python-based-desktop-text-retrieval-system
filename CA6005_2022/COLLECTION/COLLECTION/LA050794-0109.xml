   <HEADLINE> STOCKS DROP , BOND YIELDS SOAR ON JOBS REPORT ; MARKETS : TRADERS FEAR EMPLOYMENT GROWTH WILL REVIVE INFLATION . GOLD , OIL AND OTHER COMMODITIES POST GAINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bond yields soared to their highest levels in more_than a year and a half Friday and stock prices closed broadly lower as a strong April employment report reignited inflation fears and investors anticipated another Federal_Reserve_Board hike in short-term interest_rates . The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury_bond surged to 7.55 % from 7.33 % on Thursday . Friday ' s yield was the highest since December , 1992 . Yields on short-term securities also soared , with the return on three-month Treasury_bills jumping to 4.29 % from 4.13 % on Thursday -- its highest level in more_than two years . In the stock_market , the Dow Jones industrial average , off more_than 50 points at midday , closed_down 26.47 points at 3 # 669.50 as losing issues outnumbered winners 3 to 1 on the New York Stock_Exchange . While stocks and bonds were falling , gold , oil and some_other major commodities posted big gains . Financial markets headed downward shortly after the Labor_Department reported that non-farm payrolls added 267 # 000 jobs in April , far more_than the 170 # 000 to 200 # 000 analysts expected . The report rattled Wall_Street traders , who have been fearful that the accelerating recovery and its robust job growth will revive inflation , which erodes the value of stocks and bonds . Their uncertainty was intensified when the Fed failed to raise its key short-term interest_rate Friday -- the federal funds rate -- despite the strong employment report . &quot; The whole market is expecting a rate increase , and the Fed seems to be resisting it , &quot; said Kevin McClean , an analyst with Cavelti Capital Management in Toronto . The Fed has already raised short-term rates three times in the past 100 days , and many analysts expect a fourth increase to be announced as early as next week . But some bond traders had hoped that the Fed would act Friday in an effort to show its resolve against inflation and perhaps calm nervous owners of long-term bonds . When the Fed didn ' t move , many traders dumped bonds Friday , producing yet another selloff in that beleaguered market . &quot; We ' re getting crushed in here , &quot; said Dudley Eppel , head trader at Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities in New York . &quot; There just aren ' t any buyers around. &quot; In the stock_market , the Dow had lost more_than 50 points by midafternoon , prompting the NYSE to impose restrictions on some computerized program_trading . The move put a floor under prices , and bargain hunters moved_in to cut the Dow ' s losses in half . Overall , some traders said the stock_market ' s losses were relatively mild . NYSE volume was moderate at 292 million shares , suggesting there was no panic rush for the exits . In commodity markets , gold and silver benefited from the renewed inflation jitters . Near-term gold futures rocketed $ 9.80 to $ 383.40 an ounce on the New York Comex , while silver futures soared 32.8 cents to $ 5.44 an ounce . In oil markets , crude futures surged to a six-month high as production was squeezed_by mechanical problems in the North_Sea and civil unrest in Yemen . June crude_oil rose 41 cents to $ 17.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange . In currency markets , the dollar eased slightly despite the strong economic news . It slipped to 1.660 German marks in New York from 1.666 on Thursday and edged down to 102.40 Japanese yen from 102.85. Among the market highlights : * Industrial stocks were hit hard on fears that higher interest_rates will eventually slow the economy ' s pace . Losers included GE , off 1 1 / 8 to 96 5 / 8 ; Bethlehem Steel , off 5 / 8 to 18 1 / 2 ; International Paper , down 1 3 / 4 to 62 7 / 8 ; Caterpillar , down 4 3 / 8 to 108 1 / 8 , and Ford , off 1 to 58 . * Electric utility stocks , which are sensitive to rising bond yields , also plunged . The Dow utility index sank 3.96 points to 188.83 , its lowest level since August , 1990 . Pacific Gas &amp; Electric slumped 7 / 8 to 23 7 / 8 , Commonwealth Edison fell 1 to 24 1 / 4 and SCEcorp lost 1 / 4 to 15 3 / 8 . * Oil stocks were big winners .
