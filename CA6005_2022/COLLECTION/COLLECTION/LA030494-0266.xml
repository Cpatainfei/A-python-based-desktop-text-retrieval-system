   <HEADLINE> TWO CONSUMER BILLS TARGET CONTRACTORS , BOND COMPANIES ; CONSTRUCTION : MEASURES WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR HOMEOWNERS TO COLLECT DAMAGES FOR SHODDY WORK AND TIGHTEN REQUIREMENTS ON BUILDERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Flooded with complaints about unscrupulous operators in the building trades , a state lawmaker has introduced two bills designed to protect homeowners from shoddy or illegal work by contractors and from problems with construction bond companies . Assemblywoman Jackie Speier ( D-Burlingame ) introduced the legislation in response to complaints by several disgruntled Orange County residents and dozens of others from across the state during hearings last fall . Those special_sessions revealed myriad problems with the Contractors State License Board , which is responsible_for disciplining the 275 # 000 builders it licenses in California , and prompted a series of administrative changes to improve consumer protections . Speier ' s bills would broaden the reach of those reforms by making_it easier for homeowners to collect damages for shoddy work and tightening requirements on contractors . One measure would increase the likelihood that surety_bond companies pay_for contractor errors . Under current law , the bond firms can avoid paying_claims for a contractor ' s failure to perform if it was not &quot; deliberate &quot; or &quot; willful. &quot; Speier ' s bill would remove those conditions . &quot; The companies liberally apply that standard to a point where it ' s very difficult for legitimate claims to be collected upon , &quot; said Michael Miiller , a senior consultant with the Assembly ' s Consumer Protection Committee , which Speier chairs . The bill would also increase the minimum bond amount to $ 10 # 000 from the current $ 7 # 500 . In addition , it would require that surety_bond companies pay_claims if the Contractors State License Board finds a builder at_fault . Speier ' s second bill would hit unscrupulous builders on a variety of fronts . It would prohibit California ' s contractor board from approving licenses for builders suspended by another state . &quot; We ' ve seen a_couple_of cases where a contractor moved to California after committing offenses in Arizona or Oregon and then committed similar offenses here , &quot; Miiller said . The bill also would require contractors to provide Social_Security_numbers and other identification on licenses so they could be tracked_down more easily by wronged clients . In addition , it would extend the statute of limitations for the license board to investigate violations ; the board would have 10 years instead of the current three years to look_into defects . Finally , the bill would require that residential construction contracts disclose in writing that homeowners waive any right to a jury trial by accepting binding arbitration to resolve disputes with a builder . During the hearings last year , several homeowners complained that they were unaware of that legal reality . Miiller said it remains unclear what kind of reception the bills will receive but said the Legislature and Gov . Pete Wilson have received &quot; a ton of complaints &quot; from residents unhappy over problems with contractors . Dugald Gillies , a lobbyist representing a regional surety_bond firm , said he has yet to consult with his client but guesses that Speier ' s legislation will not be warmly embraced . Surety firms will likely be troubled by efforts to remove the requirement that construction bonds be paid only for willful or deliberate actions by a contractor , he said . Moreover , a requirement that bonds be paid if the license board_rules against a contractor means the agency is &quot; taking the place of a court , &quot; Gillies said . &quot; Issues of due_process have to be explored. &quot; But the construction_industry may be a bit more receptive . &quot; The bills are probably not going_to be a problem at all , &quot; said Paul P . Gladfelty , a lobbyist for the Associated General Contractors of California . &quot; We like to believe we represent a membership of the white hats , the guys who do a good job . To the extent this can clean_up some of the bad actors , it certainly benefits the construction industry. &quot; Although the Contractors State License Board has yet to take a stand on Speier ' s bills , the agency ' s top_executive predicted that the board will welcome them . &quot; I believe , in principle , the board would support these proposed changes , &quot; said Mickey Matsumoto , the agency ' s acting director . &quot; I think the assemblywoman has identified some specific areas that can be strengthened to provide better protection. &quot;</TEXT>
