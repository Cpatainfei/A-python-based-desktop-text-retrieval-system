   <HEADLINE> CALL OF THE LAST WILDERNESS ; LEAVING CIVILIZATION FAR BEHIND IN THE ALASKAN ARCTIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We glass the ridgeline ahead with binoculars , looking_for wolf . They roam up where the breeze is fresh and the tundra dry and where they can see for 100 miles . We know this becauseon the brow of the promontories they leave_behind gnawed bones and hairy scat , piles of it . Besides , where else would you go but up high if you were a wolf and these were the dog days of summer and this was your domain ? Temporary wanderers into this timelessness , we see no wolf right now . But hmmm . Something ' s moving_on the ridgeline . First , wide-set , wobbling ears emerge over the crest . Then a big dish face with a snout big as a stovepipe ahead of shaggy , rippling shoulders . A blonde barren-ground grizzly is_on the move . And her shambling , zigzag course is bringing her our way . She is followed by he -- a larger , darker bear hard on her heels . This is July on the North Slope of the Brooks Range mountains in northeast Alaska and already courtship has begun . The big boar will follow the coy sow for days , perhaps weeks , and then she -- perhaps -- will acknowledge his interest . Why , Ed , aren ' t you looking exceedingly robust today ? Until then they move_in lonely tandem , busily scraping a living from the roots and rodents of the tundra . And grabbing off the larger stuff when it ' s handy . By the way , I should mention the two bears are still coming our way , and more or less directly so . Here in the Arctic , beyond where trees break the vista , we live_in our binoculars . And a good rule_of_thumb when omnivores are closer than 8-power range : Make_way , while you can . We do , and retreat a quarter-mile before the bears can see or overtake us . When we look_back , a little_bear , maybe a 2-year-old on its first summer away from home , is flushed out by the larger bears and dashes up the hillside . The little_bear seems to have been sitting on a cache of some kind , perhaps the meat of a kill , and seems reluctant to venture too far . Nervously , it lurks on high ground , and like us , tries to plot the course of those who hold a more favored place on the food_chain . Awhile later , a fourth bear -- it looks_like another boar -- wanders into the scene from the left . Maybe he has some courtship action in mind . By now , we have to name the bears so we can whisper about them as we watch . &quot; I think Little Britches is coming_back down the_hill . . . . &quot; &quot; Look , I think Lefty is a little discouraged after he saw the size of Big Ed . . . . &quot; Someone from our group takes a glance behind us . Across the Kongakut River is a fifth bear , galumphing across a tundra slope . So , you say you want to get_away from the hurley-burley and spend some time in the natural world ? This is as far away and as wild as one can go_in the U.S. We are_on the eighth day of a 10-day float down the Kongakut River , near the border with the Canadian Yukon , and except for our troupe of 10 , we have seen more bears , wolverines , foxes , Dall sheep , caribou , moose and eagles than people . We haven ' t caught sight of a wolf , but have stopped along the river and listened to one ' s melodious howl , our skin prickling at the truest call of the wild . Across a side creek from our camp , two primitive-looking musk_oxen crash through chest-high willow thickets . One is a juvenile with flapjack ears in the shape of Mr. Spock ' s . The other is a mature bull with a proud , shaggy coat that hangs and sways like a grass_skirt . And nature doesn ' t stop with that . Nearby , a low-slung wolverine raids a fox den and emerges with a pup in its jaws . Mom and dad fox fill the air with tormented squalls and give chase , snapping_at the waddling intruder without avail . One fox is black , the other red . The chase takes them over the horizon . Only red returns . Our guide , Macgill Adams , foreman of_his_own Anchorage-based Wilderness Alaska outfitters , is spending his 15th summer here . Today is the wildlife highlight of our trip , a record-book day by any measure . We are drained , uplifted , astonished , mesmerized and not apt to sleep so soundly in the company of what is literally a ton of live grizzly_bears . &quot; This is a great wide-open place and there are no guard rails , &quot; says Adams , smiling . He arches his eyebrows . &quot; And , oh my , I forgot my ruby slippers. &quot; We gather under a tarp sometime around midnight . Why look_at your watch when you ' re far above the Arctic_Circle under 24 hours of daylight ? One of our three rafts is hoisted on its side for a wind break . Macgill fixes a tub of guacamole and chips , and passes a flagon of tequila . This is followed by steak fajitas the size of the Sunday paper . For dessert , strawberry cheesecake . Stuffed and tired , we sit on five-gallon buckets , absorbing the absolute stillness of this remaining heritage of America ' s authentic remoteness . And we listen to the satisfied inner voice that whispers congratulations to each of us for our wisdom in coming . It is the Fourth_of_July . From my notebook that day : &quot; This is the standard by which all other holidays will be judged -- and judged short. &quot; * Most everyone has a favorite place in the outdoors , where air and sky and water renew the spirit , calm the soul . And in extreme places like this , the outdoors , at least for a moment , touches more deeply our unsatisfied and primitive human yearning for space . The Arctic . It ignites imagination with its forbidding , which , yes , it can be . But not always . Space and scale here in the refuge portion of the Brooks Range is incomprehensible and ( so far ) untamed -- 19 million acres sharp from the chisel of creation -- sheer rock mountains , epic tundra foothills and a vast , treeless plain leading to the Beaufort Sea . No roads , no bridges , no man-made trails . Proof , if necessary , that a place needs plenty of room to be wild . As this is being written , I can report that during the last 12 months I ' ve spent more_than one day of 10 here on rivers of the North Slope of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge with Macgill Adams . And that ' s not enough , yet . More_than half of those who have accompanied us are planning their returns , including me . Easiest to tell are our stories of the bears and falcons , the warm sun on rivers whose banks still hold ice , the fossil rocks , the wildflowers tiny as gemstones , the forbidden cliff faces that have never known piton or hammer , the tundra plants which reach_out to capture and hold precious droplets of rain -- the things we see . More subtle , personal and , ultimately , more profound are the sensations of casting loose to achieve such latitudes . Some of us on this 10-day trip have been in the Brooks Range before . Others have not camped_out since childhood . We all came_by word_of_mouth or through tiny ads in outdoor publications . Adams is one of a small clan of Brooks Range naturalist guides with the mastery , sensibility , drive , muscle and ego to , year after year , open the Arctic curtain for people who otherwise would never venture so far north . At the airport in Fairbanks , we become separated from our delusions of controlling our lives -- and the faster the better , so we can fling ourselves at discovery . A single-engine charter carries us about 240 miles to the Athabascan Indian settlement of Arctic Village , population 150 . A smaller bush plane then shuttles us 45 minutes over the Continental Divide in twos and threes to a gravel bar landing_strip on the Kongakut where we will launch our 14-foot boats . The process takes all day . We put_on the water at 10:30 p.m. in a driving storm , with fat rain pellets drumming hard on our eyeballs . To a person , we are euphoric . Some days we float , some we hike and some we do a little of both . Our movements are determined not by a clock or a schedule but by our moods , by the scenery , the weather . These are primordial , honest cadences with a logic too many of us have forgotten but which are quickly re-established . At first , Adams is besieged with questions : How far have we floated today ? How high is that peak ? What is the temperature ? How much does that bear weigh ? He shakes his head . Part of truly getting_away is liberating ourselves from this kind of slavish box-score accounting . So he answers thus : We floated a long way today . That mountain is pretty dog-gone high . The temperature feels warm enough to wear shorts , don ' t you think ? And , that is one big son-of-a-gun of a bear . Flabby muscles throb . Appetites go crazy . And our sense of wonder , stale from urban routine , swells larger each day , at every bend of the river , with every knoll hiked , under every sudden change in weather , by every scan of distant ridges . * None of us would say it ' s an easy trip . Wonderful , full of discovery , but not easy . For every uplifting moment of wonder , there is a corresponding spell of self-doubt . But if we could chart our emotions on an oscilloscope , we ' d find in our wake almost none of those flat , modulated moments which relentlessly consume our otherwise measured lives . Even a seasoned hand like Adams , to our surprise , relinquishes himself to euphoric ups and introspective downs that are the rhythms of the wild . Early in the trip , a_couple_of miles of Class II rock_gardens could surge to Class III in higher_water , but even our heavily loaded , underpowered paddle rafts take the stream easily . The water is spring clear and icy , and is some of the last in the world where you dare plunge your face in and gulp it raw and untreated . Our downhill course will take us 55 miles . We start deep back in the Brooks Range , surrounded by imposing , multicolored rock mountains , and we float north for several days through a broad-shouldered , winding valley , exploring side canyons along the way . Later the mountains will lose their ragged tops and we will be in foothills , which from afar seem covered in velvet . Up close , we see it is tundra , the complex mat of lumpy , clumpy , spongy , often soggy , ankle-wrenching vegetation that insulates the ice below from the sun above during the short 50-odd days of summer . We conclude our trip where the_hills come_to rest_on the empty vastness of the coastal_plain , the summer home and calving grounds for more_than 150 # 000 caribou . We miss their passing migration by only a_couple_of days , but the air still has a faint barnyard bouquet . From a nob , our group looks_out onto the Arctic_Ocean and the far-off ice_pack . Heat_waves shimmer from horizon to horizon across a plain as empty and rich and wondrous as Kansas in 1820 . We hear a buzz that for a change is not a mosquito . A bush plane bounces to a stop on our tundra shelf . Outbound adventurers are shuttled to the oil-field airport of Deadhorse at Prudhoe Bay , to the west , for a jetliner connection back to Fairbanks . Too fast , the world of engines and stoplights and telephones and money is there with its imposing greetings . With the endless Arctic summer days , tonight ' s sunset will be the first anyone has seen in 10 days and the darkness carries a melancholy gloom . The wild is something you can sample , but you cannot bring_home . Mosquito Madness They are spooky , as dense in the Arctic as anywhere I ' ve been , which includes the Amazon Basin . But the challenge proves more mental than physical . Repellents with 25 % -30 % concentrations of the chemical Deet will keep mosquitoes from biting . ( The 100 % stuff is hard on your skin and your gear , and in my experience gains you nothing. ) Tight-weave , loose-fitting nylon pants and jackets keep them off your body . For the worst days of our trip , we donned mesh jackets ( sold under the Bug Armor or Shoo-Bug brand names ) soaked in Deet . that ' s the physical part . But mosquitoes still buzz in your face and swirl in clouds 20 feet high during peak summer season . Huffing up a hill , you ' ll breath a_few . Look in your soup cup and you ' ll find that you ' re eating a_few . Bathing in the ice_water of the Kongakut River is hard enough , but also exposes tender flesh faster than you can spray bug dope . Ditto when using the , ah , facilities . All this is the mental part . Sounds awful , but we all adjusted . By the end , the bugs were a nuisance , not a nightmare . Everyone brought a head net , but after a day or two , they were stowed at the bottom of the gear bag . GUIDEBOOK Adventures North of the Arctic_Circle Getting there : Alaska Airlines and Delta have direct flights from LAX to Fairbanks . United offers connecting flights to Fairbanks out of LAX , Alaska Airlines a connecting flight out of Burbank . Round-trip fares start at $ 445 , advance purchase . Bush plane shuttles in and out are arranged by guides . Clothing : Hardly ever is good gear more important than in the Arctic . Rain , fog , 40-degree wind-swept cold , 80-degree sun with no shade for 150 miles , mosquitoes , boggy tundra , sharp scree rock -- you get_it all_in extremes , and not uncommonly , in a single day . The only solution is layers and lightweight synthetics such_as Capilene and fleece , which are best because they resist moisture . For rain gear , an impenetrable cagaoule , or long anorak , sailing bibs and high rubber_boots are standard . Choosing a guide : I would only travel with a guide after speaking first to people who had been_on previous trips with him or her . Compare Arctic experience , the tempo of trips , food , naturalist skills , group size , equipment . Confirm with the guide whether he or she will lead the trip or contract it out_to someone else . Try to connect with a trip where everyone has similar physical_abilities and goals . Because of the Arctic ' s unique flora , fauna , character , weather extremes and remoteness , I place my trust in those one-person guide companies who specialize in trips in the region rather than those larger , contract operations that provide adventure travel elsewhere . The Arctic specialists know best the local bush pilots on whose shoulders your trip depends . They know the right gear . They know the birds and wildflowers of the tundra . They are willing to accommodate your special_interests .
