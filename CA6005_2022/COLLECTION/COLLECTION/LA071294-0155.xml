   <HEADLINE> BRIEFCASE : AUTOMOBILES ; TOOLS ARE WEAPONS IN WAR BETWEEN DEALERS , INDEPENDENT GARAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Independent garages have competed with new car_dealers on price , service and convenience probably since Henry_Ford rolled_out the first Model T in 1908 . To judge by the number of car repair_shops in the country , they ' ve done very well . It is not unusual for new car owners to abandon the dealer ' s service_department as soon as the warranty expires . But car_dealers continue to change , as do the cars that the auto_makers build . A keen understanding of cars and a good set of wrenches isn ' t enough in these days of microprocessor-controlled brake , ignition and fuel_systems and emissions systems plumbed like an Atlas missile . Mazda Motor of America is hoping to take_advantage of today ' s auto complexity in a new campaign it has launched to woo Mazda owners back into the dealers ' arms . In a series of mailings to 1.7 million Mazda owners in the United States , the Irvine-based company -- Mazda ' s North_American import , distribution and dealer development arm -- says that only the tools it engineers for its vehicles should be used in making repairs . And of course , the campaign stresses , only Mazda dealers can get those tools . Each dealer has to invest about $ 30 # 000 in some 300 tools to properly care_for the 12 models of cars and pickup_trucks that Mazda markets in this country , the company says . Most auto_makers these days are like Mazda , with their own proprietary tools and test_equipment . Torrance-based Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. has been stressing the advantages of visiting its dealers for repairs in a series of print and radio ads for several months now . But independent garage owners say they can buy generic versions of the repair devices and can obtain computer_programs for diagnosing engine ills within a_few months of their introduction by the factories . Just how good the copies are is a subject of debate , but their existence has enabled independents like Ken Trujillo to stay in business . The auto_makers , he said &quot; aren ' t too cooperative selling you a tool you need , but we can get them from aftermarket companies , usually within a month or two after they come out. &quot; Trujillo , owner of Independent Repair Service Center in Fullerton , specializes in Nissan and Toyota repairs and maintains that he is every bit as well equipped as an authorized dealer .</TEXT>
