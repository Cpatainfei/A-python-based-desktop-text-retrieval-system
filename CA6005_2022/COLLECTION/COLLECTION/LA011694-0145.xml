   <HEADLINE> MONEY TALK : DON ' T WASTE HOME-SALE TAX_BREAK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Q : My husband died last year at age 57 . I am 51 . At the time of his death , our home was up for_sale , but it did not sell until three months after his passing . Now I am wondering if I may claim the $ 125 # 000 , one-time exclusion on my 1993 tax_return . The return will be a joint one , since my husband was alive for a portion of the year , and he did meet the criteria for using it . I have gotten conflicting advice from accountants . -- H.E.F . * A : The situation is far more hopeful than you might think . In community_property states such_as California , assets held as community_property are entitled to a full step_up in value , to the date of one spouse ' s death . ( Assets held as the sole and separate property of the deceased would also be entitled to a full step_up in value. ) If your home was held as community_property , it is now valued as of the date of your husband ' s death . This means you probably had little or no taxable gain when you sold the house , since the sale occurred just three months after his death . Why should you even be considering using the $ 125 # 000 exemption when you should have almost no gain to exempt ? This is what your accountants should have told you ! This means that when you turn 55 -- and assuming that you do not marry someone who has already used his exemption -- you are free to use the full $ 125 # 000 deduction upon the sale of another home . If the property had not been entitled to a full step_up in value , exposing you to a sizable taxable gain , our experts say you would not have been eligible to use the $ 125 # 000 exemption , because you do not meet the age requirement . Although your husband did meet all_the criteria at the time of his death , the home was not sold until after his passing . His dying before the sale means you must qualify on_your_own for the exemption in_order to use it . IRS Views a ' Co-Op ' as Any Other Residence * Q : I purchased a unit in a cooperative housing project , or &quot; co-op &quot; several years ago , and recently sold it at a considerable loss . The liability for property_taxes , insurance and other matters all reside with the co-op . Since the co-op is a corporation , am I entitled to deduct my loss on the sale as a capital_loss ? -- S.R.Z . * A : The Internal Revenue Service considers a co-op the same as any other type of personal residence in determining tax obligations upon its sale . And , as you apparently know already , the IRS does not permit taxpayers to deduct any loss from the sale of a personal residence . Nice try at splitting hairs , but the government won ' t accept it . Home Can Be Used in Tax-Deferred Exchange * Q : I want to convert my single-family house to a rental and then trade the house for other real_estate in a tax-deferred exchange . The home is worth $ 300 # 000 and has a $ 100 # 000 basis . My loan balance is $ 135 # 000 . May I trade it for apartments or commercial real_estate ? -- J.M . * A : You may convert your home to a rental and then treat it as you would any other investment property , including trading it for another piece of investment real_estate , such_as apartments , offices or even raw land . Our experts warn , however , that you should hold the house while renting it for a &quot; considerable &quot; period_of_time , to satisfy any potential questions from the IRS . Our experts say you should rent it for at least a full year , preferably longer , before exchanging it . Any new piece of property you get_in exchange for the house must be worth at least the $ 300 # 000 market_value you place on the house . Further , to qualify for the full tax_advantages of the exchange , the mortgage on the new property must at least equal the $ 135 # 000 owed on the house . Taxpayers generally have no more_than 180 days to complete such a property exchange from the time the process begins , and you must identify the replacement property , or properties , within 45 days of relinquishing your property . The exact time the process begins is determined by when you actually relinquish your property . This date can be negotiated with all_the players in the trade , so include an attorney representing you who is thoroughly familiar_with all_the rules regulating these complex transactions . A competent professional on your team can assure that you get the property you want and still meet all_the IRS deadlines . IRA Rules Cover Use of Bequeathed Account Q : My daughter is my IRA beneficiary . When I die , may she take the balance of my IRA account over her life_expectancy , or must she take it all_in a lump sum at the time of my death ? F.G. * A : If you had already begun taking distributions from your IRA , a non-spouse beneficiary must continue withdrawing from the account at least as fast as you were . If the deceased had not begun withdrawing from the account , a non-spouse beneficiary may either take distributions annually over his or her life_expectancy or withdraw the entire sum by the end of the fifth year after the deceased ' s death . The deceased ' s plan may specify the method to be used . If the plan does not , the beneficiary should specify the preferred method by Dec . 31 of the year after the deceased ' s death . At no time may a non-spouse transfer any part of a deceased ' s IRA to his or her own account . The rules are considerably different for a spouse who inherits an IRA . A surviving spouse may transfer the funds into his or her own IRA account and continue deferring taxes on that money until he or she reaches age 70 1 / 2 .</TEXT>
