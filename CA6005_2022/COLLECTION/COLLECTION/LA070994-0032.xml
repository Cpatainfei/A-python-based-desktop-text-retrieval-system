   <TEXT> With Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ' s ruling Friday afternoon ordering O.J. Simpson to stand trial on murder_charges , the legal equivalent of a dress_rehearsal has concluded . Compared to the six-day preliminary hearing , Simpson ' s trial will feature a larger cast of witnesses , a more in-depth script , and perhaps a significant additional act -- a full-scale defense presented by Simpson ' s lawyers that may include an appearance on the witness_stand by the football legend himself . &quot; All this hearing was was an exploration of the strengths and weaknesses of the prosecution ' s case , &quot; said Los Angeles criminal defense_lawyer Barry Tarlow . &quot; The trial will be a struggle to find_out the truth where both sides will be presenting evidence. &quot; Well before before the start of the trial , which Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti said Friday could begin in mid-September , a flurry of legal motions and issues will be debated before an as-yet unchosen Superior_Court judge . Among the key issues are whether DNA samples gathered by the prosecution are admissible at trial and whether evidence of past spousal abuse can be introduced . Defense_lawyers will also , in all likelihood , file a motion asking the new judge to overrule Kennedy-Powell and dismiss the charges for lack of evidence . Additional defense motions probably will include a new attempt to throw_out evidence obtained in a search of Simpson ' s Brentwood estate in the hours after the bodies of his ex-wife and her friend were discovered outside her nearby condo . For prosecutors , the looming question is whether to seek the death_penalty against the celebrity , who is charged with the premeditated slashing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman on the night of June 12 . The formal pretrial process begins July 22 , with Simpson ' s arraignment in Los Angeles Superior_Court , at which time he will again be asked : &quot; How do you plead ? &quot; By then , it is unlikely that the district_attorney ' s office will have resolved whether to seek the death_penalty or life without parole -- the only two alternatives if it sticks_with the &quot; special circumstance &quot; theory of multiple murders . Such decisions are made by a committee of senior district_attorney officials , who hear arguments by the prosecutors and informal pleas from the defense . The panel seeks consistency , considering decisions in past cases . One senior prosecutor , who spoke on the condition that he not be identified , said he doubts that his office would seek the death_penalty against Simpson because the crimes of which he is accused could have been the result of passion , were rooted in a specific circumstance and are unlikely to happen again . But other lawyers said one has only to look_back to the Menendez murders for a similar case in which death is being sought . Although 90 % of the felony cases that reach Superior_Court are concluded with a plea bargain , one is unlikely in this case . Simpson , who maintains his innocence , has little to gain . If the special circumstances were eliminated and he were allowed to plead to either first- or second-degree murder , he would still face the prospects of imprisonment until old_age . It is unlikely that prosecutors would be willing to reduce the charges to voluntary manslaughter , which could lead to a relatively minor penalty of 11 years imprisonment for each slaying . &quot; There is no area , it seems , with an overlap , &quot; Los Angeles defense_attorney Harland W . Braun said . For Simpson ' s attorneys , even broaching the subject of a guilty plea might prove daunting because of fears that news of any such negotiations might leak_out . Given that a plea bargain is unlikely , here is what is likely to happen in coming weeks as attorneys start preparing_for trial . They are expected to : * Relitigate the fairness of decisions made by the judge in the preliminary hearing . Defense_attorneys customarily file motions based on Penal Code Section 995 asking Superior_Court judges to second-guess their lower court colleagues based solely on a review of the case ' s written record . Such motions rarely go anywhere . The defense in this case is also expected to challenge again the initial , warrantless search of the Simpson property , but will probably be barred from introducing any new evidence on this subject . It can introduce evidenceto challenge a search_warrant that police later obtained . * Squabble over the admissibility of DNA tests on blood from the crime scene that have not yet been completed . California appellate_courts have made conflicting rulings on the crucial question of how far scientists can go_in testifying about the ability of DNA tests to serve as genetic fingerprints and identify specific individuals . The question , said Southwestern University School_of_Law professor Myrna S . Raeder , is : &quot; Is there an appropriate statistical basis , based on genetics , that permits an expert to come_up with a number -- whether it be one in 10 # 000 or one in a_million -- that has scientific validity. &quot; The California Supreme Court has not weighed in to settle the dispute . The point will be moot , of course , if the prosecution ' s DNA tests eliminate Simpson as the source of the blood . * Debate whether Simpson ' s past conduct can be admitted as evidence before a jury . In 1989 , Simpson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor spousal battery of Nicole . And in the weeks before Simpson ' s preliminary hearing , authorities released tape_recordings of Nicole ' s anguished calls to 911 . Legal experts said it is unlikely that a judge would allow introduction of such explosive evidence . In deciding , a judge would have to balance the information ' s value to prosecutors as proof of the crime in_question against its prejudicial impact on the defense . In general , past conduct is not considered proof of a currently charged crime . An exception could come if Simpson takes the witness_stand at his trial and says , for example , that he had a peaceful marriage . Then prosecutors might be able to use some of his past actions to challenge his veracity . * Select the jury and possibly help choose the judge . A judge will probably be assigned soon by the presiding judge of the Superior_Court . In some high-publicity cases in the past , the presiding judge has consulted with lawyers for both sides to avoid the spectacle of them later blackballing a judge . Each side can disqualify one judge without having to give a reason . The jury selection in this case could take longer than the trial itself because massive publicity could make_it more difficult to find people who declare , believably , that they can be impartial . Selection will be even more complex if the prosecution seeks the death_penalty . A major issue for attorneys on both sides will be whether the judge allows them to question prospective jurors or exercises that prerogative alone , from the bench . An additional delay could result if Simpson changes his defense_team . His lead attorney , Robert L . Shapiro , is a criminal_law specialist but has never tried a death_penalty case . In the preliminary hearing only a handful of witnesses were used , and as is typical , the defense presented no case . Defense_lawyers rarely want to subject their witnesses to cross-examination and tip their hands to prosecutors about their theory of the case . The trial will likely feature many additional witnesses , including many_more scientists . Criminalist testimony at the preliminary hearing dealt with only one of many blood spots . At trial , the defense is likely to have experts of its own to question the validity of scientific evidence . &quot; The defense at trial is never required to put_up a separate model of what took_place , &quot; Raeder said . &quot; All the defense has to do to gain an acquittal is to raise a reasonable doubt. &quot; How quickly it gets its chance is largely in its own hands . A defendant is entitled to a trial 60 days after arraignment . But only rarely is that right exercised . &quot; Sometimes it is to the defense ' s benefit to go_to trial immediately . . . if they have an airtight alibi , &quot; said Los Angeles attorney Gerald L . Chaleff . &quot; In the sense that they have a picture of you standing next to the Pope . And the Pope ' s going_to come_in and testify. &quot;</TEXT>
