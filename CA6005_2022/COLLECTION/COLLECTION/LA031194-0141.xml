   <HEADLINE> WHITE_HOUSE AIDES TESTIFY ON WHITEWATER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Clinton_Administration lawyers delivered 1 # 000 pages of documents on the Whitewater case to a federal grand_jury Thursday while three of six White_House aides subpoenaed by the panel appeared at a federal courthouse to discuss controversial contacts between the White_House and federal regulators . The mounting distractions of Whitewater were apparent elsewhere in the capital as well . Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told Congress of his department ' s effort to comply with the Whitewater special counsel ' s demands and President Clinton , speaking on crime in New York , lashed_out at politicians and reporters who &quot; twist ( words ) like taffy , to the nth degree. &quot; In Little_Rock , Ark. , meanwhile , auditors from the Resolution Trust Corp . have begun examining more_than $ 1 million in billings to the agency by the Rose Law_Firm over the past four years . The investigation was prompted by reports that Rose was trying to determine whether former partner Webster Hubbell , a longtime Clinton friend and now the Justice_Department ' s No . 3 official , had overbilled the RTC for work done_by the firm . Special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr . had subpoenaed six White_House aides and four current or former Treasury officials in search of evidence that contacts between them might have intruded improperly on the RTC ' s investigation of the Whitewater affair . Fiske and the agency are looking_into allegations that the President may have benefited improperly from his association with James B . McDougal , owner of the failed Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan and partner with the President and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater Development Corp . The company was established to develop a resort community in the Ozarks . Also under investigation is the role played by Mrs . Clinton and the Rose firm , in which she was a partner , in representing Whitewater and Madison Guaranty . Margaret A . Williams , Mrs . Clinton ' s chief_of_staff ; Lisa Caputo , her press secretary , and Mark D . Gearan , the White_House communications director , all braved a gantlet of photographers and reporters as they headed for a third-floor grand_jury room in Washington ' s federal courthouse . Leaving after 2 1 / 2 hours of testimony , Williams said she was &quot; really encouraged to be participating in something where the finding_of_fact is important , as opposed to innuendo and rumormongering and gossip and sensationalism. &quot; Caputo also gave testimony . Nearby , a gaggle of protesters , who said they represented conservative groups , held signs bearing slogans critical of the Administration . &quot; Fess Up , &quot; one said . Another declared : &quot; It ' s Ethics , Stupid. &quot; Although Gearan showed_up at the courthouse , it was unclear whether he was called to testify . &quot; This has been a difficult day for people . It ' s been an emotional day , &quot; White_House counselor David Gergen said later in a Cable News Network interview . Another senior White_House official said the publicity surrounding Fiske ' s subpoenas had become &quot; painful &quot; for his family . Joel Klein , the White_House counsel responsible_for overseeing compliance with Fiske ' s subpoenas , appeared about 3:30 p.m. at the federal courthouse , carrying an attache_case with memos , phone logs , letters and other documents related to the aides ' contacts . Four hundred White_House employees had been asked to look_for germane documents and 30 to 40 of them had provided material that was passed_on to Fiske . &quot; The President and the First_Lady complied fully with the subpoenas , &quot; Klein told reporters , adding that the Clintons had not asserted executive privilege to withhold any papers . But he did not disclose whether the Clintons had any documents related to the contacts . Meanwhile , the Treasury_Department plans to deliver a two-foot stack of documents to the grand_jury today . Treasury officials explained that they had taken longer to round_up the material because they needed to contact supervisors of the agency ' s 157 # 000 employees -- including customs employees in distant corners of the world -- to satisfy themselves that all relevant documents would be provided . In testimony before a House subcommittee , Bentsen said that his office was filled with auditors and investigators and that the agency had been forced to rent a warehouse to keep all_the unsorted trash that officials thought might contain relevant material . &quot; I hesitate to say come look_at my basement at Treasury , because someone would probably call me a pack_rat , &quot; Bentsen said . &quot; We ' ve been holding_back our trash to_the_point that I ' ve had to use a warehouse . . . to hold the overflow. &quot; At issue in the controversy surrounding the meetings is whether White_House officials tried to interfere with the investigation by regulators or whether the Clintons were improperly informed of progress of the inquiry . Meanwhile , an RTC official said that the Little_Rock audit would attempt to determine whether the bills from the Rose Law_Firm were justified and the requested work done . The examination by a team of three auditors is expected to take several weeks , officials said . The RTC audit brings more unwelcome scrutiny to the Rose firm , which already is under investigation by the special counsel ' s office for its possible involvement in the Whitewater case , for possibly destroying evidence . Mrs . Clinton and assistant White_House counsel William H . Kennedy III also are former Rose partners . Ronald M . Clark , the firm ' s managing partner , did not return repeated telephone_calls seeking comment on the RTC audit . In the late 1980s , Hubbell had solicited work for Rose from the RTC , which handles the assets of failed savings and loans . The Rose firm was retained in 1990 by the RTC to sue the accountants of the failed Madison Guaranty , whom the RTC accused of misrepresenting the financial_condition of the thrift . Madison was owned by McDougal , the Arkansas businessman with whom the Clintons invested in the Whitewater Development Corp . The President ' s comments came_in a seminar , as he talked_about how the public_debate over national affairs too often involves distortions . &quot; I don ' t know how many people I ' ve had -- older members of Congress -- tell me in the last week how much meaner and more partisan and negative the national arena is , &quot; Clinton said . On Capitol_Hill , Democrats went_on the attack after a week of reacting defensively to mounting Republican demands for a congressional investigation of Whitewater . Several defended the Clintons and criticized Republicans for what they said is a politically motivated attempt to paralyze the presidency . Rallying around Mrs . Clinton , the Democrats also chastised Republicans for alleging that the First_Lady may have been guilty of wrongdoing in Whitewater . Meanwhile , a USA Today-CNN-Gallup telephone poll conducted Monday and Tuesday found that 60 % of those surveyed believed that Clinton did something unethical or illegal in Whitewater . Fifty-six percent believed that of Mrs . Clinton . But another poll , by NBC and the Wall_Street Journal , found that only 16 % said they believed that Clinton had &quot; committed financial wrongdoing. &quot; Thirty-four percent said the issue was &quot; just being used for political purposes &quot; and 41 % said they &quot; don ' t know enough to say. &quot; Times staff writer Michael Ross contributed to this story . Did the White_House Intrude ? The grand_jury is questioning current and former Clinton_Administration officials to see if they tried to interfere with the investigation of the failed Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan , a thrift owned by a former business partner of the President . The 10 Who Were Subpoenaed Lisa Caputo : Mrs . Clinton ' s press secretary , leaves courthouse after appearing before grand_jury . Margaret A . Williams : Mrs .

Ickes : Deputy White_House chief_of_staff Roger Altman : Deputy Treasury_secretary Jane Hanson : Treasury general counsel Josh Steiner : Treasury_secretary ' s chief_of_staff Jack Devore : Treasury press secretary The Investigator Special counsel : Robert B . Fiske Jr . is probing matters related to the financial affairs of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton , their Whitewater land_development partner James B . McDougal , and McDougal ' s Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan , which failed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of at least $ 47 million . His staff : Fiske has assembled a staff of eight current or former prosecutors and more_than 20 FBI_agents and financial analysts to review more_than a_million documents . Inquiries beyond D.C. grand_jury : Fiske has established a special grand_jury in Little_Rock , Ark. , with an 18-month term , and a separate arm of his staff is in Washington to investigate the suicide of White_House deputy counsel Vincent Foster , who handled Whitewater matters for the Clintons . The Grand_Jury What they do : Grand_juries meet in secret to hear evidence of possible criminal wrongdoing . Prosecutors are empowered to issue subpoenas to compel witnesses to testify under oath or turn_over documents . A majority of the quorum of 16 members is needed to bring an indictment -- which is an allegation , not a verdict . Why the secrecy : It is designed to protect reputations of people who are investigated but never charged . Grand jurors an prosecutors are bound by secrecy , but witnesses and their lawyers are free to discuss the testimony . Source : Times staff and wire reports ( MORE )</TEXT>
