   <HEADLINE> WILL ' NYPD BLUE ' TURN GOLD ? ; TELEVISION : ADVERTISERS AND AFFILIATES HAVE SHIED AWAY FROM THE HIGH-RATED , CONTROVERSIAL SHOW . STEVEN BOCHCO HOPES THE EMMYS ' MIGHT SEND A MESSAGE TO THEM , ' BUT OTHERS SAY THAT WON ' T HAPPEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite an avalanche of attention , rave reviews and a loyal viewership that made &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; the highest-rated new drama of last season , the gritty police series has yet to win_over some major advertisers and ABC affiliates . Can the Emmy Awards make a difference ? &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; created by Steven Bochco and David Milch , is up for 26 Emmys this weekend -- the most nominations a series has ever gotten for a single season -- and the show is bound to come_away with at least two : The casting award already has been decided in its favor and it has no competition in the category of best writing in a drama series . &quot; The nominations are really an affirmation of the quality of work that we did , &quot; Milch said . &quot; I would n ' t call it a vindication . A vindication would be more advertisers. &quot; Indeed , ABC spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer said that although about 85 % of the show ' s commercial time already has been sold for this season , much of it went at reduced rates because of the continuing controversy over &quot; NYPD Blue ' s &quot; coarse language and nudity . &quot; I can tell you that our advertising is up considerably more_than a year ago , when it was a tough sell , &quot; Gretemeyer said . &quot; With our large adult demographic -- men and women 18-49 -- we should be able to command higher rates . Our rates are higher this year but not where they should be. &quot; In addition , about 30 ABC affiliates still refuse to carry the series , which stars David Caruso and Dennis Franz as New York police_detectives . ( Jimmy Smits will replace the departing Caruso after four episodes ; the series is scheduled to return Oct . 11. ) ABC downplayed the significance of the affiliate dropout , saying that the stations were mostly in smaller markets -- Dallas being a notable exception -- and that independent stations in many of those cities are showing &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; instead . A year ago , there were 57 affiliates that refused to broadcast the series premiere . Bochco said he hopes the Emmys will work some magic for &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; the way they did for his &quot; Hill Street Blues &quot; in 1981 . &quot; ' Hill Street ' was like the lowest-rated show to ever get picked_up for a second season , &quot; he said . &quot; But winning eight Emmys and all_the attendant publicity really got audience ' s attention , and they came_to check us out . We became a hit . &quot; Since ' NYPD Blue ' is already a hit , I don ' t think the impact of winning a lot of Emmys will be as significant on that popularity level . But it might have a long-term impact on the perception of advertisers and reluctant affiliates . It might send a message to them that everything they ' re afraid of is not that much of an issue. &quot; Don ' t count_on it , a_couple_of New York ad executives said . &quot; It will not be able to command the same dollars that it would if it were not for this controversy , &quot; said Betsy Frank of Saatchi and Saatchi Advertising Inc. &quot; For those who are concerned about it , the Emmys do not make a big difference. &quot; Joel Segal , executive_vice_president of national broadcasting for McCann-Erickson Advertising , agreed : &quot; I don ' t think there is more mainstream acceptance in the advertising industry than last season . Good ratings and Emmy nominations do not make a difference . I don ' t think they ' ve gotten any more major advertisers than they did last season. &quot; Bochco said he foresees a day when the controversy will cease and affiliates and advertisers will jump_on board without hesitation . &quot; In truth , if it doesn ' t happen this year , I think by next year it will be a non-issue , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s inevitable and it should happen . I don ' t want to keep fighting. &quot; But whether the affiliates and advertisers join in or not , both Milch and Bochco said they are not about to compromise on the controversial elements on the show . &quot; All we have asked_for is to have the power to access certain colors to tell our stories when they call_for it , &quot; said Bochco . &quot; We fought the battle to expand the language and sexuality , still mindful that it was network TV. &quot; As for Milch , he is hoping that the Emmys bring , if not total acceptance from advertisers and affiliates , at least a lot of gold for &quot; NYPD Blue. &quot; &quot; I think we ' ll do quite well , &quot; he said . &quot; I haven ' t had time to give it a lot of thought -- which is not to say I don ' t care . I want to win them all. &quot;</TEXT>
