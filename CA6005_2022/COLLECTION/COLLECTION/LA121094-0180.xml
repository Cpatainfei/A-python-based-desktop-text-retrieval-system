   <HEADLINE> SUMMIT NATIONS BOAST OF AGREEMENT , BUT FRICTIONS TEAR AT HAPPY FACADE ; AMERICAS : DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN U.S. AND ITS LATIN NEIGHBORS THREATEN TO WATER_DOWN CONCLAVE ' S FINAL DECLARATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Agreement &quot; is the happy buzzword at the Summit of the Americas in Miami , but nagging differences persist between the United States and its Latin_American neighbors . For example , Latin_American countries declined to include an extensive U.S. anti-narcotics proposal in the summit ' s final documents , to be approved Sunday . A political analyst from the region said officials of Bolivia , Peru and Colombia &quot; hit the ceiling &quot; when the State_Department made the tough proposal . The three countries are the main producers of cocaine , and they have long been at_odds with the United States over how best to stop trafficking of the illegal drug . Jaime Aparicio , an official of Bolivia ' s Foreign Ministry , said Friday that the U.S. document contained proposals that were unacceptable , such_as using chemical herbicides . Aparicio said the document also proposed no increase in U.S. aid for &quot; alternative development &quot; to reduce farmers ' dependence on crops of coca leaf , the raw_material of cocaine . This is one of many points of disagreement between Washington and Latin_American countries . Others include illegal immigration , labor and environmental standards and trade protectionism . While governments have agreed on a declaration of harmony and accord , friction has been frequent in pre-summit negotiations . &quot; There are differences on each one of the items of the agenda , &quot; said Gert Rosenthal , who heads the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin_America and the Caribbean . &quot; You could probably say there is broad agreement , but if you go_down the list one by one , there are differences on each one. &quot; As a result , the final declarations will contain many watered-down versions of punchier points proposed in preparatory meetings . Open bickering will be avoided , but hemispheric harmony will be far from complete . In their most resounding decision , the 34 presidents and prime_ministers meeting here will agree to work for hemispheric free_trade . In negotiations over wording of that agreement , however , Latin_Americans resisted U.S. efforts to link labor and environment standards to the trade issue . Without such &quot; linkage , &quot; many Democrats in Congress may have trouble selling the idea of hemispheric free_trade to their pro-labor and pro-environment constituencies . Many Latin_American governments , on the other hand , contend that hard-to-meet standards on these issues could be a barrier to progress toward free_trade . Immigration is another source of anger for several of the summit participants . Mexico and the Central_American_countries plan to protest what they see as an anti-immigrant backlash in the United States . They want a formal condemnation of California ' s Proposition 187 , which denies education and other public_services to illegal immigrants . &quot; It ( Proposition 187 ) is a flagrant and massive violation of human_rights , especially for children , &quot; Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said upon arriving here . In another potential clash with the Clinton_Administration , the Central_Americans hope to link trade and immigration . To stop the flow of illegal immigrants north , they will argue , the United States must give preferential treatment to Central_American products , such_as textiles . Otherwise , these governments maintain , Central_America ' s tiny economies , which in some cases are still recovering from U.S.-backed wars , cannot compete and will not be able to provide the jobs to keep citizens at_home . &quot; The United States is going_to have to realize that if they don ' t want ( illegal ) immigrants , they are going_to have to become a partner in_progress for our people , &quot; said President Armando Calderon Sol of El_Salvador . Both El_Salvador and Nicaragua will be seeking special dispensation for their refugees who live_in the United States . Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro will ask President Clinton to extend the visas of about 100 # 000 Nicaraguans who were granted temporary permission to live_in the United States during Nicaragua ' s civil_war . A similar program that gave temporary haven to tens of thousands of Salvadorans expires at the end of the month , and Clinton last week refused Salvadoran government requests for an extension . Calderon Sol indicated that he will raise the issue again . Another high-sounding summit conclusion will call_for efforts to strengthen democracy , which has been trampled in the past by numerous Latin_American dictatorships . While none of the leaders at the summit took power by force , Latin_American governments blocked a U.S. proposal for measures to defend democracy . &quot; The United States wanted more forceful language , &quot; Rosenthal said . &quot; The Latin_Americans had no substantive difference with it , but it sounded as if the United States was going_to have a role in monitoring political development. &quot; Even though &quot; anti-imperialism &quot; in the region has faded since the end of the Cold_War , governments remain sensitive to any hint of domineering behavior by Washington . Meddling by the United States , the CIA and other U.S. operatives in Latin domestic affairs , such_as the backing of Contra insurgents in Nicaragua during the 1980s , is a fresh memory for many Latins . * In fact , some analysts say , if the Clinton_Administration had made a forceful invasion of Haiti instead of a brokered entry to restore elected government in September , many presidents might have refused to attend the summit in protest . While free_trade is the central theme of the summit , trade disagreements with the United States abound . Latin_American countries that export steel , garments , leather goods , flowers and other products to the United States bridle_at U.S. regulations that result in &quot; countervailing duties &quot; on imports that are judged to be subsidized . Meanwhile , Argentina and other agricultural exporters complain that subsidized U.S. farm products compete unfairly on world markets . The U.S. embargo against Communist Cuba is another divisive issue . Several countries , including Mexico , Costa Rica and Colombia , support dialogue with Cuba , rather than isolation , as a way to bring_about democratic change . They will urge flexibility on the embargo . But Eduardo Gamarra , a political_scientist at Miami ' s Florida International University , said nothing causes more trouble between the United States and Latin_America than narcotics . U.S. pressure on governments to take drastic measures against drug production and trafficking is resented , and also ineffective . Senior U.S. officials have gone so far as_to accuse the president of Colombia , Ernesto Samper , of accepting drug money in his election campaign . &quot; There ' s more cocaine coming_to the United States than ever before , and there ' s more corruption than ever before , &quot; Gamarra said . &quot; This is still the primary bone of contention between the United States and Latin America. &quot;</TEXT>
