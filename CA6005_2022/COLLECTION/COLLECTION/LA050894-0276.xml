   <HEADLINE> CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS : SUN POWER PURIFIES SWIMMING POOL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : The chlorine in my swimming_pool irritates my eyes and skin . Can I use free solar_energy to power a &quot; no-chemical &quot; pool purification system . What new purification systems are available ? ANSWER : Pool purification chemicals not only irritate your eyes , skin and harm your hair , but there is growing concern about the long-term health effects of chlorine chemicals on the human_body . There are several solar-powered ionization purification systems that allow you to reduce chlorine usage by up_to 85 % . These reduce chemical costs and the quality of the pool water is often better than drinking-water standards . The small solar_cells in the ionization system produce the required low-voltage electricity for free . Also , 120-volt ionization systems are available that operate for only about $ 5 of electricity per year . Ionization systems produce very low concentrations ( less than 0.5 parts per million ) of silver and copper ions in the pool water . This is harmless to people and animals , but lethal to bacteria and algae . Ionization purifiers have been used from Roman_Empire times to today ' s space missions . One solar purifier , called a Floatron , floats on the surface of the pool . It is about one foot in diameter with a solar-cell panel built into its top surface . A small copper / silver rod sticks_out from the bottom into the pool water . This gives_off the ions when the sun shines on the panel . Initially , you use a simple ion test kit to measure the concentration level . When it reaches the correct level , remove the Floatron from the pool . Depending_on your pool and weather , you typically have to float it only every_other week . You ' ll soon learn how often you must float it . Another solar-powered model , called Solarcide , uses a separate , small ( one-square-foot ) solar_panel that mounts next to the pool . It is connected by fine wires to the silver / copper rod in the pool strainer . This design comes_in several sizes for various size pools . Large models have several solar-cell panels and rods . There is also a new durable solar-cell panel for above-ground pools . You can lay it flat on the deck for maximum sun exposure and you can walk on it without damage . The 120-volt models provide automatic control over the ion concentration level . You simply adjust a dial to control the continuous copper / silver ion output . The voltage going_to the electrodes is very low , so there is no electric hazard .
