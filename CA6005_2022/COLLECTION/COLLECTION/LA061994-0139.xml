   <HEADLINE> VALLEY COMMENTARY ; MANAGED CARE CAN CURE THE SYSTEM ' S ILLS ; BASHING THE POPULAR MODE OF MEDICINE FOR ITS COST CONSTRAINTS HAS BECOME FASHIONABLE . BUT IT PROVIDES OVERSIGHT , FREEDOM FOR DOCTORS AND HIGH-QUALITY , LIFE-SAVING SERVICES TO PATIENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Recently , there has been a lot of bashing of managed care , focusing_on its efforts to control costs . Much of the criticism is not fair . While managed care does seek to control costs , there is much more to it than dollars and cents . As a physician , I am here to tell you that managed care saves lives . In the medical group of which I am a member , a suggestion by a managed care company that we contract with helped us implement a system for tracking the results of mammograms . We noticed that at one hospital we worked with , tests were conducted improperly and results were difficult to read . We changed hospitals , paying more but making early detection of an unexpectedly large_number of breast_cancers . Early detection means a higher recovery rate . Two years after the change there have been no mistakes in diagnosis . In my 10 years of practice as a private family practitioner , I have had considerable experience with managed care . Approximately 75 % of my practice is currently made_up of health_maintenance_organization patients . I have witnessed a major evolution in how managed care companies approach health_care . More competition among companies has led to more interest in quality and service . Quality care , in the long_run , costs less . How is quality judged under a fee-for-service system ? No entity tracks the results of doctors ' treatment plans . Managed care provides this service . The managed care companies that I contract with track my performance and that of my colleagues . They review my patients ' charts . They insist on documentation . They function much as a business consultant . They do not interfere with my ability to make decisions for my patients . Rather , they provide advice that allows me to provide my patients with more assurance of quality care and service . The National Committee for Quality Assurance , an independent nonprofit institution that reviews and accredits managed care organizations , and the development of Health Employee Data Information Service &quot; report_cards &quot; for doctors are among the tools that the managed care industry is developing . Managed care does not limit my decision-making ability as a doctor . It enhances it . I am a coordinator of care , ensuring that my patients receive the highest_quality of service . Over the years , I have become increasingly involved with managed care_for several reasons . One reason is that under the fee-for-service system , 20 % of Californians had no health_care coverage . Care was unaffordable , and there was a severe lack of quality monitoring . Managed care addresses these concerns and allows me to concentrate_on providing the quality of care that I was trained to provide . Managed care focuses_on preventive care and reducing unnecessary services . It seeks to lower costs , which means more access for more people . HMOs immunize children at twice the rate of indemnity plans , screen 2 1 / 2 times more women for breast_cancer , provide annual physicals and routinely offer health education programs . Another reason for my increasing involvement with managed care is that more of my patients are choosing managed care health plans . Nearly 11 million Californians , 35 % of the state ' s population , belong_to HMOs . In a 1992 nationwide survey of 90 # 000 consumers by the National Research Corp. , a higher percentage of HMO participants said they were satisfied with their health plans than those with traditional plans . Managed care is the future , a future filled with the promise of higher-quality care , lower costs and more access .</TEXT>
