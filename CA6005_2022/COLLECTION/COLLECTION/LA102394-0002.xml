   <HEADLINE> WHOSE LIFE IS IT ANYWAY ? ; HOW A BIOGRAPHER LOST HERSELF IN HER SUBJECT ; A PASSAGE TO EGYPT : THE LIFE OF LUCIE DUFF GORDON , BY KATHERINE FRANK ( HOUGHTON MIFFLIN : $ 24.95 ; 378 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1988 Katherine Frank and her husband set_out for Egypt to find the grave of Lucie Duff Gordon , her latest biographical subject . As the author of distinguished works_on Emily Bronte and the 19th-Century explorer Mary Kingsley , Frank felt the need to pay her respects at the last resting place of the_English adventuress . Then something appalling happened . Instead of looking_for the grave of Lady Duff Gordon , she found herself having to arrange the burial of_her_own husband , who died_suddenly in Cairo four days after their arrival . All this is related quite simply , even baldly , at the beginning of Frank ' s biography of Lady Duff Gordon , &quot; A Passage to Egypt &quot; : &quot; The day after his death he was buried in the Mugattam hills . I could not face continuing our journey alone . I left Egypt and returned to England . A long , dark , London winter followed . I spent most of it reading and taking_notes with a kind of feverish intensity in the round , domed Reading_Room of the_British Library . I found refuge there as others might in a church . When I walked through the heavy swing_doors of the Reading_Room , it felt as if I had checked my personal identity and grief , as did the tourists their coats and umbrellas and cameras in the large entrance lobby of the_British Museum. &quot; Given that the life of Lucie Duff Gordon is also one of female suffering , there is no doubt that Frank ' s story gains a peculiar urgency from the cruel personal circumstances in which she found herself . Furthermore , at the end of the book , when Frank has tried again -- and failed -- to find Duff Gordon ' s grave , she ties her Prologue to her Epilogue , and gives us what is in_effect her biographer ' s credo . Frank now accepts that it is_better not to have found Lucie ' s grave : &quot; For , if I did , it would signal some sort of completion -- a death , in fact -- and the end of my remembering . I understood now that however much we yearn to possess the past , it is not of our creation . Our rememberings are partial -- versions crafted of collected fragments -- and this means the pursuit is never finished . Yet the past is real and true , however fragmentarily we recover it . Above all it is not over . It is down there in the pool of time , and we sit on the shore and cast our lines . . . sometimes glimpsing in the shadowy depths , the faint but iridescent light of resurrection. &quot; It will be clear from this that Frank ' s approach is not the theoretically objective one of the run of biographers . Many of us probably have personal experiences during the long , arduous years of research that may disturb us like uneasy phantoms when we read certain passages of_our_own text . In my own case , without having endured an experience anything as traumatic as that of Katherine Frank , I still feel an unease come_over me when reading certain passages of my 1984 book &quot; The Weaker Vessel , &quot; a somewhat autobiographical tale of female suffering . Frank , however , boldly grasps the mantle of the biographer ' s objectivity and throws it aside . She intends to share with us not only the ordeals of her heroine but also her own , in an attempt to come_to terms with her own past . To be honest , I might not have warmed toward such a method in_advance , had it been described to me . What about scholarly impartiality ? Yet the fact is that I feel , in Frank ' s case , it succeeds triumphantly . I found the various strands in &quot; A Passage to Egypt &quot; woven together skillfully and poignantly . Lucie Duff Gordon is not a major figure in our imaginations today ( less famous than Mary Kingsley , a great_deal less famous than Emily Bronte ) yet she led a colorful , as well as a tragic life that has interesting things to tell us about the female lot in the 19th Century . She was born Lucie Austin in 1821 to a depressed hypochondriacal father and a spirited mother , Sarah , who had waited five years for her marriage , in the course of which she was put_through an educational_program to make her worthy of her future spouse . The Austin household remained an intellectual one , and John Austin ' s private tuition of a 15-year-old called John Stuart Mill was to have important consequences for his daughter . In the meantime it was thanks to the Austins that John Stuart Mill came_in time to develop his passion for the young married_woman Harriet Taylor who lived next door to them . As Austin descended into melancholy ( and poverty ) the splendid Sarah took_on work as a translator and a teacher in_order to support the family . As Frank points_out , Lucie ' s parents ' marriage reversed the conventional roles of husband and wife ; as Austin became increasingly passive and dependent , Sarah , of necessity , became more and more capable and energetic . &quot; I have to act , &quot; she wrote to a friend , &quot; I am the man of business in our firm. &quot; As the shift of power occurred between the Austin parents , Sarah also developed a long-distance friendship with a German author , Prince Hermann von Puckler-Muskau , in which sexual fantasies played their part ( which were to be brutally dispelled when the pair , after some years , finally met ) . Frank deals at length with Lucie ' s childhood and youth in_order to explain the making of such an unconventional creature as she proved to be . Lucie ' s marriage to the glamorous Sir Alexander Duff Gordon , at the age of 18 , was more of a conventional step , however , as though she had had enough of her parents ' Bohemian way_of_life . Now she could have her own literary salon : one of which any hostess could be proud -- for it included Dickens , Thackeray and Tennyson . The great poet , Heinrich Heine , was her friend . The marriage was a happy one . Frank makes this clear ( although her language slips for once into banality -- surprisingly so ) : &quot; Now Lucie was married to an exceedingly handsome husband , 10 years her senior and probably sexually experienced . And they were passionately in_love . She must have found the sexual expression of that love an exciting revelation. &quot; Fortunately , the reader -- and the book -- is rescued from this trough by the very tragedy which both struck Lucie down and transformed her life . Tuberculosis , that dreaded 19th-Century killer , condemned her to life in a hot dry climate . She went without husband or children . The conjugal visits that followed were_on the whole disastrous . Did the disease really condemn her ? Or did perhaps something deep within Lucie Duff Gordon rebel against the entire life of a hostess that she left_behind ? Certainly Lucie Duff Gordon ' s last years -- she died in 1868 at the age of 48 -- seem to have been happy ones as she took_to the life of the East , despite the ravages of her illness . Some of her communications to her husband are either naive or provocative -- or maybe a bit of both . Of the superb black Nubians she admired , she wrote : &quot; I was in raptures at seeing how superb an animal man ( and woman ) really is. &quot; Yet to her husband , she commented significantly : &quot; I wish you would come , but the heat here which gives me life would be quite impossible to you. &quot; The discovery of the East , the adoption of the personality of Noor ala Noor -- her Arab name -- make Lucie Duff Gordon one of the many European romantics who have turned_away from their own culture . Of course she did so on_her_own terms : numerous servants , both English and Arab , pepper the pages of this story , and when Lucie ' s maid became pregnant by her favorite Egyptian servant , Lucie can hardly be said to have behaved well . Yet the impression remains : Life for an Englishwoman in the 19th Century was so maddeningly frustrating , the bonds that tied even the most unconventional so tight , that it was better to wander as Lucie did , disease-ridden but free . Lucie Duff Gordon must lie happy in her Egyptian &quot; unvisited tomb , &quot; in the words of George Eliot , more happily than she would have lain in some English cemetery . In any case , Katherine Frank has brought her brilliantly back to life .</TEXT>
