   <HEADLINE> SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE ; ROUGH YEAR FOR LOCAL RESORTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A quick phone check of local ski reports told the sad story . Mt . Waterman ? Closed . Kratka Ridge ? Closed . Ski Sunrise ? Closed . Mt . Baldy ? Open . . . but you ' d better get there fast . What happened to spring skiing ? Forget that . What happened to skiing ? Although Southern California ski powerhouses -- the Big Three at Big Bear and Mountain High -- can boast of solid late-season conditions , the same cannot be said for smaller operators . &quot; A rough year , &quot; said Phil Edholm , general_manager at Wrightwood ' s Ski Sunrise . &quot; It ' s been skinny. &quot; Ski Sunrise , which in a normal year can expected to be open 115 days , has been operational only half as_many this season . Small operators were hanging the rest of their seasons on the snow-making strength of last week ' s storm . But while the system produced 12 to 15 inches of new snow at Mt . Waterman , it allowed the area to reopen for only a_couple_of days . Mt . Waterman closed again Monday , probably for the rest of the season . &quot; It was real good snow , &quot; said Mary Anderson , Mt . Waterman ' s longtime caretaker . &quot; But there was no real base . You sunk right through it. &quot; Waterman , usually operational for three months in good years , was open a month and a half this season . Recent storms allowed Mt . Baldy to reopen last week , but warm temperatures threaten that status . Even Snow Summit in Big Bear , which plans to remain open until April 17 , has discontinued night skiing . * Some thoughts on Julie Parisien , who recently decided to put her race career on hold . Parisien , the athlete , thought she had to be tough . Toughness made her a world-class skier , a three-time World Cup winner . When her brother and mentor , Jean-Paul , was killed by a drunk driver in December of 1992 , Parisien the athlete jumped back into racing and put_on a brave face . She thought she could turn grief into victories and leave a legacy for J.P. Parisien , the sister , was not up_to the task . Three weeks ago , before the World Cup races at Mammoth , Parisien announced she was taking a sabbatical at age 22 . Whether she returns is anyone ' s guess . It is not important , really , unless it is important to Parisien . Understand , she cannot return to racing and not be reminded of J.P. , the brother who first introduced the family to racing at the Burke Mountain Academy . This is Julie ' s dilemma . She almost quit the U.S. team last December , around the one-year anniversary of J.P. ' s death , but decided to stick it out through the Olympics . At Lillehammer , however , she put unrealistic pressure on herself to win the gold . When she failed -- missing a gate on her second run of Olympic slalom -- Parisien knew she needed time away . She wobbled into the World Cup races at Mammoth on March 7 , thinking she was going_to race . Upon arrival , she learned that Derek Bonney , the drunk driver responsible_for J.P. ' s death , was scheduled for sentencing in Maine the following Thursday , the day Parisien was supposed to race the Mammoth slalom . Parisien once said she didn ' t care what became of the man who killed her brother . She was wrong . The night of March 7 , in her Mammoth hotel_room , Parisien suffered an emotional breakdown , worse than the one suffered when she first learned of J.P. ' s death . &quot; It opened my grieving all_over again , &quot; Parisien said . &quot; It was completely unexpected , but my grieving just got_worse and worse . I guess I ' ve really delayed my grieving until now . It hit me hard. &quot; Parisien left Mammoth the next day and flew home for the sentencing of Bonney , who received four years on manslaughter and drunken driving charges . Parisien spoke in open court about the man who had taken her brother and now , possibly , her career . Parisien isn ' t sure what she ' ll do next . Maybe facing Bonney face-to-face was the closure she needed to get_on_with her life . Parisien plans on enrolling at the University of Colorado . She has talked_of becoming a waitress . Next summer , she says , she will re-evaluate her race career . Paul Major , the U.S. Alpine Director , thinks Parisien will eventually return to racing . He says she is capable of rekindling the form that once made her No . 1 in the world in the slaloms . More important : Is that what Parisien wants ? Skiing Notes Steve Persons , 24 , who won the giant slalom at the first U.S. Snowboarding Championships last week at June Mountain , Calif. , is the step-brother of Tommy Moe , the Olympic downhill champion . In a random draw , Persons , from Whitefish , Mont. , selected bib No . 8 , the number Moe wore_on his gold-medal run at Lillehammer . . . . Persons was one of five boarders who earned positions on the first U.S. team , which begins World Cup competition next season . The others were Tom Tuttle ( Mammoth Lakes ) , Ross Powers ( South Londonderry , Vt. ) , Stacia Hookman ( Vail , Colo. ) and Sabrina Sadeghi ( Aspen , Colo. ) . Additional members of the team will be selected after summer training camps . On April 14 , Picabo Street , the Olympic downhill silver medalist , will be an &quot; honored guest &quot; of the New York Yankees on opening day . She will not , however , throw_out the first ball . The Yankees have reserved that honor for some guy named DiMaggio . Street , who won last week ' s downhill title at the U.S. Alpine Championships at Winter Park , Colo. , plans to race through the North_American Championship Series , which began Monday and continues through Tuesday , at Mt . Bachelor in Oregon . Moe , 24 , says he will remain in ski_racing until near the end of the century . &quot; I ' m young , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' d like to race in ' 98 and defend the ol ' Olympic title . Look_at Marc Girardelli . He ' s 30 . There are a lot of skiers in their mid-20s doing_well . I can see myself doing_it for four more years . There are a lot of things I can accomplish. &quot; . . . With 1 # 007 points , Girardelli , the one-man team from Luxembourg , scored more World Cup points this season than nine countries . . . Ann Van Eps of Los Angeles won the 41-and-older division race in the recent Absolut Vodka Bartenders Ski Classic at Bear Mountain .</TEXT>
