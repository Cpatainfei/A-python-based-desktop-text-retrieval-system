   <TEXT> Prof . Randy Thornhill is studying the languorous , lingerie-clad form of Stephanie Seymour in a Victoria ' s Secret catalogue with clinical detachment . The model ' s pouty lips and prominent cheekbones signal that she has high levels of estrogen , he observes . Ditto for the small lower jaw and overall flatness of her face . Leafing through the rest of the catalogue , Thornhill finds confirmation of his theories of human beauty on every page . &quot; The models are just exaggerated forms of attractiveness that is_on a continuum , &quot; he says . &quot; They really all look alike when you account_for hair color and eye color and that kind of stuff. &quot; Thornhill , an evolutionary biologist at the University of New Mexico , thinks he knows why we see some women as beautiful and some men as handsome : They display traits -- in some cases , influenced by hormones such_as estrogen -- that we are genetically predisposed to read as signs of a strong immune_system . That , in turn , makes them more desirable as potential mates in the age-old battle to see whose genes survive . It ' s a theory sure to make feminists and humanists grit their teeth . Thornhill rejects the widespread view that influences such_as TV commercials and Vogue fashion layouts have conditioned us to see certain people as attractive . Our notions of beauty , he believes , are largely innate . &quot; We know that people ' s judgments of faces are highly correlated , &quot; he says . &quot; You can take pictures from people in one culture and show them to people in another culture and they will rank them the same way . &quot; There ' s clearly something going_on with human nature with_regard_to attractiveness . We think we ' re getting it. &quot; * Thornhill , who at 49 looks a lot like Dick Clark , works_out of a small office and lab in the UNM biology_department . His desk is littered with papers , a plastic_surgery text and the tools of his trade : calipers and a tape_measure he uses on volunteer subjects . A bumper sticker on a file_cabinet reads , &quot; Honk if you love Darwin. &quot; His style is informal , and when he leans_back in his chair to chat , his gently elongated vowels betray his Alabama roots . He ' s trying to quit smoking , and every so often he tucks a small pouch of smokeless tobacco in his cheek . Thornhill belongs_to a group of scientists who over the last 25 years have applied Charles_Darwin ' s theory_of_evolution by selection to people and their behavior . Modern Darwinists maintain that our primary purpose in life , whether we are aware of it or not , is to transmit our genes to our offspring . It ' s an imperative arising from millions of years of evolution . Modern Darwinism is controversial because its emphasis on the role of genes in behavior seems to endorse stereotypical sex roles while implying that our actions are &quot; programmed. &quot; ( Men , according to Modern Darwinists , seek women who can bear many children , and may want to mate with as_many women as possible to improve their reproductive odds . Women , on the other hand , are more apt to prefer men who will invest time and resources in helping to raise their young. ) But Thornhill says such objections are ill-founded . &quot; There ' s a lot of misunderstanding about the phenomenon of development , &quot; Thornhill says . &quot; For any trait of the individual , both genes and environment are necessary to get the trait. &quot; But why would we have evolved a preference for beautiful people in the first place ? In a word , parasites . Some biologists think our evolution has been driven by competition with viruses , bacteria and other microorganisms that can produce millions of generations in the course of a human lifetime ; each generation has a chance to evolve a new adaptation , posing a constant challenge to our immune_systems . People with greater diversity in their genes stand a better chance of evolving new ways to outmaneuver parasites . A key finding is that more genetically diverse individuals tend to have more symmetrical facial and body traits -- such features as eyes , hands and feet . During gestation , and throughout life , the development of these features can be disrupted by infections , toxins , malnutrition and other stresses . The more symmetrical these features are , Thornhill argues , the more they advertise a person ' s ability to resist diseases . Thornhill and a colleague , evolutionary psychologist Steve Gangestad , noted in a 1993 paper ( see story , E5 ) that qualities of averageness and symmetricalness were closely linked with attractiveness , especially in women . But there is another component to attractiveness : Decidedly non-average features , such_as a large jaw and prominent cheekbones in men , are rated more attractive by study subjects . Thornhill suspects this is because such exaggerated features develop during puberty under the influence of testosterone , which is known to suppress immune function . Thornhill reasons that a handsome man is advertising that his immune_system is strong if it can withstand the effects of that extra testosterone . This relentless probing into why some people are considered beautiful might encounter obstacles on many fronts , Thornhill acknowledges . &quot; My colleagues say some of the things we do here would not be politically correct elsewhere , &quot; he says dryly . &quot; Darwin is the one who did_it -- he got_it all started . He really understood life deeply because he applied an evolutionary perspective. &quot; * Researchers in other fields are far from convinced that our evolutionary history determines our perception of beauty . They question the methods and underlying assumptions of the new research . Sarah Nelson , an archeologist and chairman of the University of Denver ' s anthropology_department , wonders about researchers ' use of questionnaires to elicit people ' s attitudes about attractiveness . &quot; You can structure the answers by the way you ask the question , &quot; she says . And while cross-cultural surveys might seem like a good way to see if there are universal traits of attractiveness , getting unbiased data is difficult . &quot; The whole world is now contaminated with American movies , &quot; Nelson says , and there is evidence our society ' s beauty ideals have been widely assimilated abroad . &quot; People who go_out and do amateur anthropology are missing a lot of the sophistication that goes_into anthropological fieldwork , &quot; Nelson says . More fundamentally , she says , Modern Darwinists are trying to divine the origins of human sexuality using contemporary models of male-female relations . &quot; This is really reading from our society into the past , &quot; she says . &quot; They have no methodology for considering the past without reference_to the present. &quot; Lois Banner , a historian and chairman of the gender studies program at USC , sees in the new Darwinism the latest in a long line of scientific_theories purporting to demonstrate that inequalities between people are &quot; natural. &quot; In the 19th Century , she notes , scientists used measurements of cranial capacity as &quot; evidence &quot; that men were smarter than women and whites smarter than blacks -- all decided on the basis of who had the largest brains . But even after a theory like that becomes discredited , she says , a new one springs_up to take its place . At DePaul University , social psychologist Midge Wilson has studied &quot; lookism &quot; -- discrimination on the basis of physical attractiveness . She ' s familiar_with the notion of biological underpinnings to our perceptions of human beauty , but she doesn ' t give the theory much weight . Given that a biological basis for attraction might exist , she says , &quot; it accounts_for such a small part of the picture of what keeps people together and what they might consider attractive. &quot; Wilson also thinks that changing roles for women , particularly in the workplace , have diminished the importance of their appearance . In this new climate , &quot; Their reproductive fitness is not the only index of their desirability , &quot; she says . * Thornhill is familiar_with such objections . While defending his research methods , he contends most criticism comes from humanities and social_sciences scholars whose &quot; egalitarian &quot; ideology doesn ' t allow_for scientific facts . &quot; These kinds of criticisms are bothersome because they discredit the scientific_knowledge we have of people ' s place in nature , &quot; he says . &quot; To argue that some scientific_theories have been wrong and that modern evolutionary theory is therefore wrong is typical humanist rhetoric. &quot; Thornhill realizes that accepting an evolutionary basis for gender differences is tough for many people because it might be used to justify discrimination and other injustices . Such fears arise from the &quot; naturalist fallacy , &quot; which assumes that because things are by nature a certain way , that is how they ought to be , Thornhill says . &quot; To say something is evolved is not to say it ' s right , &quot; he says . &quot; ' Should ' is coming from an entirely different domain than what is or is not. &quot; * Thornhill doesn ' t recall a particular point when he decided to become a biologist , but he remembers a childhood spent collecting insects and snakes and bird-watching . &quot; Even as a kid I really tuned_in to human behavior and psychology , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s been an obsession ever since I can remember. &quot; When he was in graduate_school at the University of Michigan in the early 1970s , Modern Darwinism was the new_wave , promising to provide a simple , coherent explanation for the mysteries of human nature . He knows the idea of genetically encoded impulses and preferences seems to challenge the very notion of free_will . It ' s an issue he constantly addresses in his undergraduate classes . Many also wonder whether we are doomed to be blindly driven by primal evolutionary mandates , or whether we can transcend these biological imperatives . Thornhill is optimistic . &quot; I believe you can , at some level , &quot; he says . &quot; I think self-knowledge gives you more freedom. &quot;</TEXT>
