   <HEADLINE> FRUSTRATED U.N. TROOPS HUMILIATED IN BOSNIA ; BALKANS : TOP MILITARY OFFICIALS SAY THE MISSION IS CAUGHT BETWEEN LOFTY RESOLUTIONS AND HOSTILE FORCES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Croatian army troops disarmed and abducted four Canadian soldiers on a routine patrol earlier this month , an enraged Gen . Jean Cot , the_French commander of the U.N. Protection Force , denounced the affront to his peacekeeping mission as &quot; outrageous. &quot; But the kidnaping incident and Cot ' s protest passed almost unnoticed . After almost two years of provocations by Balkan combatants that have ranged from extortion to mock execution , the U.N. peacekeeping mission here has amassed a history of humiliation . Three generals have left the Balkans peacekeeping effort , the largest and most expensive in U.N. history , with harsh words for the operation and the Security_Council that ultimately commands it . Two others have left_quietly , but they clearly suffered the same frustration . Senior officials still assigned to the operation warn that the United Nations is discrediting the very principle of peacekeeping by persisting with a mission they consider a charade . And as incidents of hostage-taking and harassment add new terrors to an operation that has quickly rolled_up a record casualty toll , top U.N. commanders here are increasingly vocal about their displeasure in being the fall_guys for the West ' s inability or unwillingness to halt the worst bloodletting in Europe since World_War_II . Frustration is epidemic in the ranks of the U.N. mission as its 29 # 000 soldiers -- with no mandate to fight -- try to bridge a chasm between good intentions , in the form of lofty Security_Council resolutions , and the reality of a deployment that has placed them between hostile forces . The resentment was most recently made apparent by the resignation of Belgian Gen . Francis Briquemont , who denounced the &quot; fantastic gap between all these Security_Council resolutions and the means available to execute them. &quot; Saying that he no longer even reads the resolutions that serve as marching orders for the U.N. mission , Briquemont decried &quot; a sort of paralysis &quot; that he believed was plaguing the operation . The Belgian general , who commanded the 12 # 000 troops in Bosnia for less than six months , echoed the condemnation of his unhappy predecessors in saying the Balkans mission was doomed from the start . &quot; The United Nations decided to come_to Bosnia in a peacekeeping operation when there was no peace and no agreement , &quot; Briquemont told reporters in Sarajevo before his departure . One senior official at U.N. headquarters here said Briquemont was compelled to leave because &quot; he couldn ' t put_up with the increasing irrelevance of the operation and its degradation of the entire United Nations. &quot; &quot; It ' s not just humiliation -- we are being censored in New York and ICFY , &quot; the Geneva-based International Conference on Former Yugoslavia being mediated by European Union envoy Lord Owen and special U.N. envoy Thorvald Stoltenberg , the official said . &quot; Reports to the Security_Council are ' cleaned_up ' to describe a mission we don ' t recognize . We have a sense we are just being played with. &quot; Cot , the third_person to command the operation since its first troops arrived in April , 1992 , has warned of the potential for the conflict to spread faster than his forces would be able to contain it . &quot; Given the inertia in the system , &quot; he said , it would take too long for contributing countries to deploy more troops vital to ensuring the success of any peace accord for Bosnia or Croatia . He pointed to Security_Council resolutions passed seven months ago designating Sarajevo , Srebrenica and four other besieged Bosnian cities as U.N.-protected &quot; safe havens &quot; that were to be guarded by 7 # 600 more troops ; fewer than 2 # 000 of those forces have been deployed , and those only within the last two months . Cot has publicly lamented the &quot; humiliation &quot; of his troops in both Bosnia and Croatia , where armed renegades on all sides have fired on U.N. forces and humanitarian aid workers , hijacked their armor and supplies and stolen huge sums of hard currency . U.N. forces have also capitulated to Serbian demands for road-use taxes , security_deposits or supplies of gasoline for rebel escort of U.N. soldiers . Because the U.N. forces are deployed in Bosnia to protect aid convoys and have no orders to stop the fighting , they are often caught in the cross-fire of battles raging around them . One of the most devastating recent incidents , according to U.N. sources here , was a Serbian rebel attack on Canadian troops near the central Bosnian town of Visoko in late December . Two drunken Serbian gunmen , angered by the United Nations ' failure to rescue another rebel fatally wounded by government sniper fire , surprised 11 Canadians , only two of whom were armed at the time ; the Serbs disarmed them , took them hostage , lined them up against a wall and terrorized them with sprays of machine-gun fire aimed just over their heads . Officers of the Nordic contingent deployed near the now Muslim-held town of Vares have appealed for reinforcements and shows of air_power that have not come , another U.N. source said , leaving field commanders resentful that the mission is incapable of providing backup . Increasingly frustrated with an operation that has ambitious goals but no means to achieve them , Cot reportedly has asked_for the authority to order air strikes . He used what was supposed to be a briefing for Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , to appeal for American pressure on U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to give him that right , according to one participant at the meeting . Almost no one among the legions of military_officers and foreign diplomats monitoring the Balkans crisis believes that the U.N. hierarchy in New York will ever confer such powers to operation commanders , not least because the mission in Bosnia continues to be defined as a humanitarian action . Last week , the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization broadened its threat to intervene in Bosnia , declaring that in addition to Sarajevo , they are prepared to launch air strikes in two other &quot; safe haven &quot; areas . Under the terms of NATO ' s potential involvement , however , no air strikes can be launched without the approval of the Security_Council . Since the announced resignation of Briquemont , Cot and other officers in the mission here have been more outspoken about their frustration . At a recent news_conference , Cot accused the warring factions in Bosnia of &quot; a great_deal of cowardice &quot; in taking_advantage of the self-imposed limits on_his_own troops ' defense . &quot; One day , when this war is over . . . we will say in what way our forces -- who came_to help . . . were treated , &quot; the force commander said of the Balkan gunmen , barely able to restrain his contempt . In lamenting the departure of Briquemont , Cot clearly blamed the mission more_than the man . &quot; It would be difficult to give more_than he has , &quot; the_French general said of his Belgian colleague . &quot; When one gives as much as he has , one wears out. &quot; Cedric Thornberry , deputy chief of mission responsible_for civilian affairs , is also preparing to leave the operation after 22 months . He says Western leaders have much to risk by continuing to ignore the underlying causes of the Balkans crisis . &quot; There is a virtually uncontrollable explosion of extreme nationalism at this moment in Eastern Europe , and there is a danger that this explosion could blow us all away in terms of our commitment to democracy , continental stability and human_rights , &quot; Thornberry said . &quot; This is the defining issue of our time , and it is unfair to blame ( this mission ) or the United Nations &quot; for failure in the Balkans . He called_upon Security_Council members to identify and agree on the aims of the peacekeeping mission , warning : &quot; There is no chance for achievement if you don ' t define the objectives. &quot; A lack of direction was one reason the first operation commander , Indian Gen . Satish Nambiar , left after less than a year , and why his successor , Gen . Lars-Eric Wahlgren of Sweden , stayed for only three months before Cot took_over . The first U.N. commander in Bosnia , Gen . Lewis MacKenzie of Canada , left the operation with venomous words for a mission he described as hopelessly imperiled . French Gen . Philippe Morillon , who preceded Briquemont as Bosnian commander , waged a one-man campaign to protect embattled Muslim civilians during his tenure , only to be stifled by U.N. administrators who have pragmatically accepted the mission ' s fig-leaf role . Another major concern among peacekeeping officials , as stated by Briquemont , is a feeling among U.N. troops that they arrived too late to serve as a buffer between combatants who were already at each other ' s throats . Croatian leaders appealed for Western intervention to protect them throughout the six-month war they fought against the Serb-led Yugoslav Peoples Army , the third-largest force on the European continent , when it rolled_over one-third of Croatia in 1991 while claiming to be defending the republic ' s Serbian minority . And while Serbs and Croats were engaged in that bloodletting , the leaders of what was then a broadly integrated , multiethnic Bosnia begged for protective U.N. intervention to establish a peacekeeping force while there was still peace to keep . The U.N. force here was finally created in early 1992 , after then-U.N. envoy Cyrus R . Vance mediated a cease-fire between the Yugoslav army and the Croatian government . That agreement called_for an interim U.N. deployment until an international peace conference could work_out a permanent solution . Once the Serbian revolt against Bosnian independence began in March , 1992 , attention shifted from the Croatian standoff to the Bosnian crisis and has stayed there , while Serbian rebels in the occupied Krajina region of Croatia solidified their proclaimed independent state . Owen , the mediator from the European Union ( formerly called the European Community ) , and Stoltenberg , who replaced Vance , have lately talked_of the need for a &quot; global solution , &quot; one that would take_into_account all_of the ethnic clashes and frictions in the region . But as their roving diplomatic endeavor staggers on fruitlessly in its 18th month , Western countries have had to improvise to deal with the mounting humanitarian crisis . U.S. warplanes nightly parachute relief supplies to starving Muslim enclaves because road convoys are routinely blocked by Serbian gunmen who have the holdout pockets surrounded . Fighting between Croats and Muslims , who were allied against the Serbian rebellion before it deteriorated into a three-way civil_war , has also prevented aid from getting_to many regions . But air drops are the most expensive and least efficient means of getting food to endangered civilians , the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees has noted often . Relief officials also criticize the expense of a meaningless &quot; no-fly &quot; zone enforcement , which sends a vast network of sophisticated military aircraft on four-times-daily patrols of Bosnian air space but has been repeatedly denied permission to force down violators . &quot; It costs more to run the air drops and the ' no-fly ' zone than it does our entire ground operation , &quot; complained one official with the U.N. refugee agency . &quot; It would be better if they just dropped dollar_bills from the sky. &quot; As relief work is undermined by the unchecked violence , and resentment of the outside world ' s indifference turns even the intended beneficiaries of the mission against it , U.N. troops have increasingly become targets of hostility . Since the world body ' s force was deployed 21 months ago , the mission has suffered 850 casualties , 71 of them fatal , making_it the most physically hazardous in U.N. history . Exasperated by attacks on their troops , France , Britain , Canada and Spain have threatened to withdraw from Bosnia this spring , if the mission remains mired in the status_quo of thwarted relief works . But mission officials concede that they are actually hostages of the crisis and fear that they will be expected to soldier on , because their presence is the West ' s alibi for avoiding the unpopular moves needed to actually stop the fighting and set a deterrent_example for nationalist aggressions to come .</TEXT>
