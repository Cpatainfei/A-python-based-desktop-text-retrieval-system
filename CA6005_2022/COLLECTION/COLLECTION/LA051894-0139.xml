   <HEADLINE> SIMI STANDARDIZES SOIL STUDY GUIDELINES ; SEISMIC SAFETY : THE CITY_COUNCIL ' S GOAL IS TO HELP RESIDENTS IN HILLY AREAS AND NEAR FAULT_LINES BUILD MORE QUAKE-RESISTANT HOMES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hoping to help Simi Valley residents build earthquake-resistant homes , the City_Council has adopted standardized guidelines for soil studies and quake repair . For years the city has required such studies , called geotechnical reports , for all private developments in Simi Valley . In addition , in-depth ground studies , called geological reports , are required for developments in hilly areas and in areas along the Simi-Santa Rosa fault . In the past , however , consultants prepared these reports on_their_own , without any direction from the city . &quot; Many consultants have asked the city if we have guidelines , but until now we have not , so they have provided services on_their_own personal discretion , &quot; Public Works Director Ron Coons told the council . &quot; In some cases we believe better service could be given with these guidelines in place. &quot; According to the guidelines , consultants should check for liquefaction , soil composition , slope stability and the potential for ground ruptures . The guidelines are not mandatory , but are meant to aid homeowners and consultants helping them to repair or rebuild after the Jan . 17 earthquake . The guidelines direct consultants taking_stock of earthquake damage to describe and draw_in detail cracks and other earthquake damage , outline the possible causes of the damage and suggest what could be done to keep it from happening again . Nine active earthquake faults run under Simi Valley , according to the city ' s General Plan . The Northridge quake was the most severe in the city ' s 24-year history , causing more_than $ 350 million in damage . At the city ' s request , the State_Department of Mines and Geology is conducting a special study of soil stability in a severely damaged area on the southeastern side of town . The city requested the study after residents complained that large cracks under their homes were continuing to spread . Geologists are monitoring the movement of the ground in the area , taking aerial photographs and testing the soil along the Arroyo Simi from Kuehner Drive to Stearns Street . The study is scheduled to be completed by June . At the Monday night meeting , a representative from a local geology company asked the council to postpone adoption of the new guidelines until after the state completes its study . &quot; You don ' t know what this state study will turn_up , &quot; Jeff Holt of Mountain Geology told the council . &quot; It would be good to wait and see what they find. &quot; But Mayor Greg Stratton said he is eager to put the guidelines in place , adding that they could be modified when the state study is completed . &quot; These guidelines are better than no guidelines at all , &quot; Stratton said . &quot; Maybe it ' s not perfect but it is a step_in the right direction. &quot;</TEXT>
