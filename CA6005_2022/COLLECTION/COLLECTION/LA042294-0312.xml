   <HEADLINE> INDUSTRY AIMS TO MAKE PC A HOUSEHOLD WORD ; TECHNOLOGY : WITH THE CORPORATE MARKET ABOUT TAPPED_OUT , COMPUTER MAKERS ARE TARGETING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS WITH LESS COSTLY , MORE POWERFUL AND EASIER TO USE UNITS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With a flick of a switch and a click of a key or two , today ' s families can balance their checkbooks , message friends around the world , compose music , even study mating calls of exotic birds . The technological advances in personal_computers have made all this and much more possible . Yet only a third of the 96 million U.S. households are plugged into that world . Many of the unplugged confess that they are scared by the sight of a &quot; mouse , &quot; not to mention a keyboard , monitor and modem . They are perplexed by the techno-jargon of bits , bytes , baud , RAM , ROM and DOS . Part of the problem lies_with the computer_industry , which in the past catered mainly to experienced commercial users . Individuals were dismissed as &quot; dead-end &quot; users , a term technicians used for the painfully obvious questions novices could pose . But that has rapidly changed as high-tech firms , nearing a saturation point in the corporate market , turn_to consumers as a source of business . The technology has also made computers more powerful for less money . &quot; The PC industry has historically never really addressed consumers , &quot; said Rick Martin , director of product marketing for Compaq Computer Corp . &quot; We have to tell our story to the people . . . and explain all_the benefits of having a PC in the first place . Then we have to provide the technology to do those things . &quot; Our goal is to go_after the two-thirds of the households that don ' t have a computer. &quot; To tap into that market , Compaq has been heavily marketing its Presario PC brand , unveiled last summer with individuals and small businesses in mind . It includes all-in-one units that require no assembly , a software program that organizes computer_files like a notebook and easy-to-read manuals . Gateway 2000 , a mail-order company , has been &quot; advertising in magazines that we have never advertised in before -- more consumer-oriented magazines , &quot; said Wendell Watson , a company spokesman . Consequently , he said , sales have been brisk for its recently introduced Family PC , which comes equipped with a multimedia package that includes a CD-ROM player and speakers that allow users to both see and hear information from their software programs . Other companies , including industry leaders like IBM Corp . and Apple Computer Inc. , have made their equipment easier to use and more fun to operate . Their lightweight laptop PCs pack the same punch as the larger desktop PCs but can be used just about anywhere . Improved software has helped . A standard installation now in many machines is the Windows program created by Microsoft Corp. , which lets users point to on-screen pictures to tell the computer what to do . Windows has made_it easier to work with a computer ' s disk operating system , or DOS , the cumbersome foundation software that tends to the basic functioning of all IBM-compatible computers . &quot; The technology has come a long way in a relatively short time . You can do so_much with your PC , &quot; said Lawrence J . Magid , author of &quot; The Little PC Book , &quot; written for novices . While the technology has leaped , prices have fallen . Today , a fast , well-equipped PC can be purchased for $ 1 # 200 to $ 2 # 000 , with portable units_costing about a third more_than desktop units . About a year ago , the average PC sold for about $ 3 # 000 . Four years ago , it cost about $ 5 # 000 . The normal reaction may be to wait until technological advances bring_down prices even more . But Magid ' s book recommends : &quot; If you need a computer now , buy one . If you wait a year or two , you ' ll save money or wind_up with a more powerful system , but think_of the opportunities you ' ll have missed. &quot; Magid says the safest bet is to avoid both the ultra-high-end models and last year ' s leftovers . &quot; You should try to buy as much technology as you can afford . . . . It ' s sometimes more expensive to upgrade , &quot; he added in a recent interview . Before shopping , decide what you want a PC for : Will it be used mainly as a word_processor for occasionally working_at home ? To organize family finances ? Help with your children ' s homework ? Play games ? Perhaps a little of each ? The initial choice boils_down to either an IBM-compatible PC or an Apple Macintosh . Either will do the job ; the main difference is that each uses its own proprietary software and the IBM standard is more prevalent . ( Apple has recently introduced Macintoshes that are IBM-compatible , however. ) While it is not necessary to fully understand a computer ' s components to run one , it is helpful to become familiar_with basic functions to make a more educated choice . You will need to know two key things : a PC ' s power and its memory capacity . The power , or main computing work , comes from the microprocessor chip , the computer ' s brain . IBM-compatibles operate_on the 8086-80486 family of chips or the new Pentium chip by Intel Corp . A chip ' s ability to process data depends_on the level of megahertz . The higher the number , the faster the processing speed . Each PC has random-access_memory , or RAM , which is where the computer_stores programs and files_in use . It also contains what is known as a hard_disk , which acts_as a warehouse by holding all data . Storage capacity is expressed in megabytes , with one megabyte storing 1 million characters . Again , the higher the number , the more information can be handled and the more you can do with your PC .</TEXT>
