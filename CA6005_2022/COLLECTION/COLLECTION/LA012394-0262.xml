   <TEXT> Inspectors scrambled Saturday to evaluate the safety of Los Angeles public_schools while maintenance_staff feverishly worked_at cleaning_up debris and making minor repairs_to ready as_many classrooms as possible for students scheduled to return to class on Tuesday . By Saturday afternoon the number of uninhabitable classrooms -- all but a handful in the west San Fernando Valley -- had dropped to about 300 from a peak of 1 # 000 , prompting school_board President Leticia Quezada to say &quot; my hope is that all children will be able to attend school one way or another &quot; next week . Some of the 97 hardest-hit West Valley schools -- now slated to be closed Tuesday -- may be ready for occupancy later this week and no school will be permanently closed , officials said . Only 9 # 000 students are estimated to be without classrooms , dramatically lower than earlier estimates of up_to 100 # 000 , said Doug Brown , chief of district facilities . By early Monday authorities will decide whether any West Valley schools can open Tuesday , according to Brown . Although portions of most of these campuses are structurally sound , many classrooms are in disarray and cleanup may take days or even weeks . &quot; I ' m more optimistic today than I was yesterday , &quot; Brown said . &quot; But 640 # 000 students back in school ? that ' s really , really optimistic in my opinion. &quot; The earthquake ' s impact on Los Angeles public_schools ranged from severe structural damage at some school buildings to minor cosmetic damage , according to a report released Saturday by the Los Angeles Unified School District . The report , along with visits to schools from South-Central to the East Valley , show the scope of troubles ranging from broken windows and cracked walls to fallen ceiling tiles and buckled floors . More_than half the district ' s 640 campuses were virtually unscathed , the report showed . &quot; It ' s the good , the bad and the ugly , &quot; said a weary Vehah Assatourian , a Los Angeles school district construction inspector . &quot; We ' re seeing lots of architectural and cosmetic damage with minor structural damage and some unknown conditions that need further investigation. &quot; Assatourian , who was working in the West Valley for his sixth day Saturday , said repairs will be costly . District officials believe damage may run as high as $ 700 million . The district damage report , which officials hope will be significantly pared_down by Monday , contains the shorthand notes of structural engineers and school maintenance supervisors sketching the random impact of the quake : Aliso High_School , an 84-student continuation school in Reseda , will not reopen soon . &quot; All buildings unusable ; major structural damage to all buildings on site , &quot; the engineers wrote . &quot; One classroom building must be ( demolished ) ; two ( bungalows ) off foundations. &quot; Hubert Howe Bancroft Middle_School in Hollywood , meanwhile , was deemed &quot; ready to occupy , &quot; suffering only &quot; minor stucco cracks on main building. &quot; Canoga Park Elementary School was listed as having 35 unusable classrooms due_to &quot; major water damage &quot; from a broken ceiling pipe . At 93rd Street Elementary School in South-Central Los Angeles , minor cracks crisscross four classroom walls and the rooms are &quot; approved for occupancy. &quot; Almost every school in the Valley needs to be cleaned , walkways shored_up and barricades erected to keep students away from crumbling plaster and unsafe corridors . The majority of schools on the Eastside , in South-Central L.A. and the harbor area show white space in the damage column of the district report . It is the Valley classrooms that will probably be in disarray Monday and Tuesday . Gas , water and electricity in some buildings still had not been checked or repaired on Saturday . Cafeteria stoves were overturned , lunch ground shelters were twisted , light fixtures dangled by wires . At those schools and elsewhere , workers swiftly cordoned off damaged bungalows , swathed cracked support_columns in orange plastic netting and segregated damaged buildings from safe ones with red and yellow tape . Workers swept and shoveled debris out of corridors , and ripped down ceiling tiles to make rooms safe for habitation . Shattered windows were boarded , and water_lines were patched and tested . While officials hope to complete as much cleanup as possible by Tuesday , they said parents and students in many schools should brace themselves for classrooms without ceiling tiles and with cracked walls and soggy carpets . The scene may_not look reassuring , but it is safe and parents should not be alarmed , district leaders said . Cracks in walls and stairwells , water damage and broken windows are typically cosmetic damage and do not necessarily mean a building is unsafe . &quot; My people have instructions to not clear any classroom or building for occupancy that they would not send their own children or grandchildren into , &quot; Brown said . Mike J . Bargman , chief architect of Los Angeles Unified School District , said it will take weeks to clean_up many West Valley classrooms , such_as those at Reseda High_School , even if there is no structural damage to buildings . &quot; We ' ve got a lot of schools , where structurally they ' re OK , but we ' ve got_to test them for gas leaks . . . . We have a lot of kitchen areas where equipment was juggled around and ( the shaking ) severed the electrical ( wires ) . That has to be redone. &quot; Bargman said major structural work will be needed at Encino Elementary , Reseda High_School , Holmes Junior_High , Monroe High_School and Danube Elementary School . The worst damage occurred near the Northridge epicenter of Monday ' s 6.6 temblor -- and among the hardest hit was 2 # 300-student Kennedy High_School in Granada Hills , where officials say the cleanup alone will take two to three weeks . In a walk-through inspection of Kennedy Saturday , Assatourian and Jack Starlin , a state inspector , found a three-inch fissure in the earth snaking its way 200 yards from the baseball field through the girls ' and boys ' locker_rooms and into the football_field . &quot; That came_out of left field , &quot; said Starlin , a senior structural engineer with the State Architect ' s Office . &quot; This is one of the few sites I ' ve seen that have so many deep ground ruptures. &quot; Two buildings on the campus , built_in 1971 before the Sylmar quake that year , are structurally damaged and cannot be occupied . Other classroom buildings were found to be structurally safe but in shambles . The inspectors walked through a two-story classroom building and discovered badly damaged ceilings , cracks in plaster and air-conditioning vents lying on the floors . But as they left , armed with clipboards , flashlights and hard_hats , Starlin said : &quot; Give it a green_light &quot; for occupation . The early district report for nearby Nobel Middle_School describes in one line that light fixtures are down and that there is structural damage to the student store and arcade . Assatourian and Starlin , however , are making room-by-room assessments . Their method is simple : &quot; If it looks questionable , we ' re putting_up braces and posts and then we ' ll do another assessment , &quot; said Starlin . Starlin said the schools will be inspected several more times in the hardest-hit West Valley areas and that principals and plant managers should not be reluctant to contact the district ' s construction staff -- even if the school already was inspected . &quot; I ' d rather see the same thing twice than have these people not call me , &quot; Starlin said . Bargman , the chief district architect , noted that the light damage to Monroe High_School in Northridge &quot; just goes_to show you how well these schools were built . This is almost ground zero. &quot; Los Angeles public_schools in the central and east San Fernando Valley suffered relatively minor damage . But maintenance crews were still out_in force at those schools , repairing broken windows , lights and surface cracks in interior and exterior walls . The back outside wall of O ' Melveny School in San Fernando was blackened from a fire on adjacent Wolfskill Street that ignited when a crude-oil pipe ruptured during the quake . But the damage did not appear to reach inside the classrooms , and will not delay the elementary_school ' s opening , officials said . San Fernando Elementary School is among the most severely damaged campuses outside the West Valley , the district report showed . While plans are not confirmed , officials said , students there may have to be transferred to O ' Melveny . At San Fernando , seven rooms are destroyed , two bungalows have slid off their foundation , and there is no water and no gas . Making matters worse , about 10 teachers whose homes are damaged or may be stranded may_not be able to make_it to work . At Sharp Avenue School in Pacoima , administrators were working_out the logistics of accommodating 800 additional elementary students whose West Valley schools are too damaged to be usable by Tuesday , according to plant manager Tony Moreno . And when students return to San Fernando High_School and Sylmar High_School , they may find their gymnasiums still occupied by quake victims who have been sheltered at the schools since Monday . On Saturday , National_Guard troops were_on the school grounds helping run the shelters . San Fernando High suffered minor damage to its auditorium , according to Principal Phil Saldivar . The hot water boilers also were knocked_out of commission by the earthquake , and again on Friday by aftershocks . But maintenance workers had them going again Saturday . Sara Coughlin , Valley regional superintendent , took one look inside Tulsa Elementary school in Granada Hills Saturday and said no one will set foot inside until at least Tuesday . &quot; It is not safe for teachers and it is not safe for students , &quot; Coughlin said . &quot; That is the recommendation I ' m going_to make. &quot; While the district report and Coughlin said the damage does not appear to be structural , it ' s those 102 dangling lights and fixtures and several gas leaks in the kitchen and main_office that will keep everyone away from the campus . At Van Gogh Street School in Granada Hills , rebuilt after the Sylmar quake in 1971 , principal Maureen Diekmann pointed to a worrisome crack that runs_through the hallway , outside courtyard and through fifth grade Room 10 . &quot; This crack goes right across the street , &quot; she said . &quot; It goes_into a house across the street and that house has been condemned. &quot; The district report says that no children are permitted in the main building , because the entire structure may be unsafe . About 20 miles south over the Santa Monica Mountains , Konnie Fulcher , plant manager at Alexander Hamilton High_School on the Westside , has spent all week supervising crews of electricians and maintenance workers who are replacing ceiling tiles , lights , pipes , windowpanes and myriad other building parts broken_in the earthquake . The district report for Hamilton lists three paragraphs of damage : structural damage to lab building , girls ' gym flooded , damaged bridge structure , loose stairway handrails , small asbestos cleanup . Structurally , most of the buildings on Hamilton ' s campus at 2955 Robertson Blvd . are intact . The exception may be the 63-year-old brick auditorium , site of performances by students in Hamilton ' s renowned music program . Several ornamental columns inside the auditorium cracked , and as of Saturday , structural engineers had yet to declare the building safe . The second and third floor pedestrian_bridges linking the science building with Hamilton ' s main building buckled in the middle . They have been declared unsafe and are roped_off . But almost a week ' s worth of intensive work has removed most traces of the damage . Classrooms on Saturday were looking tidy , and most of the ceiling tiles had been replaced . And work previously done to earthquake-proof Hamilton ' s three-story main building -- built of brick_in 1931 -- stood the test . The building suffered major damage in the 1971 Sylmar quake , according to Fulcher , and subsequently was reinforced with steel beams . The damage was similar at nearby Crescent Heights Boulevard School , a fourth-through-sixth-grade neighborhood school a_few blocks northeast of where the Santa Monica Freeway collapsed . Movable walls that fell_down have been righted , and most of the ceiling tiles have been replaced . But cleanup work probably will not be completed in time for students to re-enter those classrooms Tuesday , according to plant manager Michael Williams . Typical of the condition is one fourth-grade room . Ceiling-mounted heating ducts are visible where tile from the dropped ceiling broke_loose , and the carpet and desk surfaces are littered with debris . Yet unscathed was a colorful display of children ' s essays , under the title : &quot; What Do You Know About Planet Earth ? &quot; Damaged Classes After Monday ' s earthquake , inspectors found that more_than 150 Los Angeles Unified School District campuses ad suffered damage that would render some buildings unusable . Subsequent inspections_and_repairs reduced that number to 97 , all_in the San Fernando Valley west of the San Diego Freeway . Officials hope to make some of them serviceable by Tuesday .</TEXT>
