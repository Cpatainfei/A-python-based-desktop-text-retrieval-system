   <HEADLINE> IN THE MOVIES , EVERYONE HAS A HOME ; HOLLYWOOD REALLY DOESN ' T SAY MUCH ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF THE HOMELESS , PREFERRING TO MAKE IT SUGAR SWEET AND SERVE IT UP FOR THE MASSES ; FILM COMMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What does Hollywood make of homeless people ? In the mythology of popular culture , the rich are different from you and me . The idealized poor represent moral rectitude in a land of plenty . The homeless stand_for something far more grim and condemnatory . They are perceived as being beyond poor -- beyond class , beyond hope . And yet their spectral teeming presence on the streets testifies to a rotting within the society they seem so marginally , yet fundamentally , a part of . The &quot; issue &quot; of homelessness , at least for those of us who are sheltered , pulls on our every sinew of political prejudice and guilt . For both the homeless and for those who seek to &quot; understand &quot; them and dramatize them , the moral effort is finally the same : It ' s all about the struggle to remain human . It ' s not a struggle Hollywood movies -- with their prefab plots and prefab people -- are ideally suited for . There is no Hollywood equivalent_to an uncompromising shocker like Hector Babenco ' s great &quot; Pixote &quot; ( 1981 ) , about street kids in Rio . In those occasional modern instances where our movies have touched_on homelessness -- in such films as &quot; With Honors , &quot; &quot; The Saint of Fort Washington , &quot; &quot; Life Stinks , &quot; &quot; Where the Day Takes You , &quot; the action thrillers &quot; Hard Target &quot; and &quot; Surviving the Game , &quot; &quot; The Fisher King &quot; or , before that , &quot; Down and Out in Beverly Hills &quot; and the recently revived &quot; Midnight Cowboy &quot; -- the idealizations and evasions are startling and yet perfectly understandable as show-biz strategies for coping_with the enormity . For the most part , the homeless in our movies are depicted as martyred visionaries , sages or chattel . You won ' t learn much from these films about the real causes and conditions of homelessness , but you will learn a lot about how these conditions are camouflaged and candied and served_up for a mass audience . * The current &quot; With Honors , &quot; for example , collides homelessness and Harvard : It ' s high concept with a sociology degree . Monty , played by Brendan Fraser , is a senior majoring in political_science who plans to work for the government one day to &quot; help people. &quot; ( What people ? Help how ? It ' s all kind of fuzzy. ) Simon , played by Joe Pesci , is the homeless man who , through a series of implausibilities , latches onto Monty ' s only copy of his 100-page senior thesis and , in exchange for favors , hands back to the boy a page at a time -- a page for each favor . Pretty soon , Simon is camping_out in an abandoned VW van in the front_yard of the house Monty shares with three other roommates . Like Monty , they take their time warming_up to this ragamuffin . But Monty is fatherless and Simon walked_out years ago on his wife and son to join the Merchant_Marine and , well , you can figure it out . Bonding , anyone ? Simon represents the homeless as folkloric sage . The twitty , elitist society represented by Harvard -- the world of top-dog achievers -- exists for him to tweak . He may look_like a Dickensian chimney sweep , but he quotes passages from Whitman and he comes bearing the gifts of hard-knocks wisdom . When Monty takes Simon to his political_science class , his conservative professor , played by Gore Vidal in full snoot , chastises the boy for his squishy notions of democracy . Then Simon goes_on the attack , lecturing the professor in sporty cadences about having &quot; faith in the wisdom of people. &quot; Simon is in the movie to give Monty life lessons ; he ' s grooming the good citizenry of the future . And the premed roomie who recoils at Simon gets slammed hard by him : &quot; You know why you hate me ? Because you look the way I feel. &quot; Touche ! His truth-telling hooks_up to a larger conceit in movies about the destitute : that squalor leads to spirituality . In &quot; The Fisher King &quot; ( 1991 ) , Robin Williams ' Parry is a knight-errant in his own wild-eyed Manhattan fantasia ; his crackbrained quest_for the Holy_Grail has metaphoric pizazz . He ' s the pure-in-heart dreamer whose loony , pained flights are magical transports . He even gets his Grail at the end . But more_than any other film about the homeless , last year ' s &quot; The Saint of Fort Washington &quot; really stockpiles the magic-of-madness metaphors . It ' s a compendium of practically every haloed homily in the genre . Matt Dillon ' s Matthew , abandoned by his mother , living_in vacant tenements , is a diagnosed schizophrenic who takes pictures with a camera with no film in it -- metaphor alert ! -- and hooks_up_with a black Vietnam vet , Danny Glover ' s Jerry , in Manhattan ' s prison-like Ft . Washington shelter . Jerry , who takes_to calling the boy his son , sees the gentle Matthew for what he truly is : &quot; Maybe you aren ' t schizo , &quot; he muses . &quot; Maybe you just a saint. &quot; And maybe he is . When Jerry ' s old shrapnel wounds act_up , Matthew lays healing hands on him . The men dream of buying a station_wagon and selling fresh produce out of the back . ( It ' s like &quot; Of Mice and Men &quot; on wheels. ) Their friendship has no racial component . Poverty , it seems , not only sanctifies , it also renders you colorblind . * Standing apart from these sainted scenarios are movies like last year ' s &quot; Hard Target &quot; and the current &quot; Surviving the Game &quot; that depict the homeless as the bull ' s-eyes of blood sport . The vagrants in these films are still sanctified , but now it ' s as if all_of society ' s viciousness has been unleashed upon them . It ' s the kind of exploitation filmmaking that allows an audience to unleash its own frustrations while still pretending social responsibility . The action-thriller format also gets_around another problem inherent in movies about the homeless . It short-circuits the usual slow slide to oblivion by giving its homeless hero a reason not only to survive but to prevail . The point is that no matter how far down you go you still have something to lose -- your life . In these latest pulp reworkings of &quot; The Most Dangerous Game &quot; ( 1932 ) , the homeless are employed as human prey for the delectation of a gaggle of sickos . In &quot; Hard Target , &quot; one of the prey is a black Vietnam vet ; in &quot; Surviving the Game , &quot; the hunted is an inner-city black_man , played by Ice-T , who is first seen teaming_up with a kindly old white scavenger as they get rousted by the cops for trying to steal food . The Ice-T character , we eventually learn , went_on the skids because the villainous local building inspectors didn ' t care about his run-down neighborhood , resulting in the loss of his family in an apartment fire . His employers in the ensuing hunting_expedition -- this street-smart guy somehow believes he ' s being hired as a &quot; survival guide &quot; -- have each been selected by the filmmakers to push a different alarm button in the audience . Rutger Hauer , the blood sport ' s ringleader , for example , is the movie ' s all-purpose Aryan super-scum . F . Murray Abraham , playing &quot; one of the most feared men on Wall_Street , &quot; defends the hunt to his cowardly ( i.e. , humane ) son by explaining that the prey is &quot; less than nothing. &quot; Gary Busey ' s role is a twofer : He ' s a psychiatrist , and a psychotic , who also works for the CIA . &quot; Surviving the Game &quot; demonstrates how pulp , irresponsibly but effectively , often gets_at an audience ' s social prejudices and fears in a way that more genteel movies don ' t . The film places you in the position of being both the_hunter and the hunted and , in assigning blame for the homeless situation , which it casts in starkly racial terms , it punches up a familiar rogue ' s gallery : White_supremacists , racist capitalists , mental_health workers , predatory government_agencies . It ' s all there , in paranoid microcosm . American movies , particularly beyond the Depression years , have often been notoriously leery about pointing_up class differences -- we are , after all , supposed to be living_in a classless society . And yet the situations of class are unavoidable in movies about homeless people . During the Depression , which is the last time homelessness really made_it to our screen in a big way , the class system in America was recognized -- but only as a kind of mobile walkway that anybody could ride to riches and prosperity . A comedy like the 1936 &quot; My Man Godfrey &quot; was emblematic of its era : William Powell played a millionaire scion down on his luck ( because of a woman ) who is retrieved from a shantytown by a loopy socialite family as the prize in a scavenger hunt and then hired as their butler . ( How different the hunt was then ! ) Like Simon in &quot; With Honors , &quot; Powell ' s Godfrey dispenses life lessons and then , reacquainted with his riches , converts the shantytown into a prosperous nightclub with his old hobo buddies as employees . No matter how bleak the Depression-era movies were , they almost always upheld the traditional institutions of society -- the churches , social agencies , the military , even the banks . The struggle in those films for its homeless people was how to fit back into that society , not how to drop_out of it . By the ' 60s , a film like &quot; Midnight Cowboy &quot; could ride the counterculture crest by featuring two essentially harmless dreamers , Dustin Hoffman ' s Ratso Rizzo and Jon Voight ' s Joe Buck , awash in a society too depraved to accommodate them . Corruption was everywhere , from the heartland to the urban jungle to Upper East_Side boudoirs . The movie plugged into a sentimental hate-America ethic that gave Joe and Ratso ' s dejection a ( dubious ) social meaning . These homeless waifs wanted to make their home_in a society that didn ' t deserve them . In a film like Paul Mazursky ' s 1986 comedy &quot; Down and Out in Beverly Hills , &quot; the well-off in society still didn ' t deserve them , but they coveted them . Nick Nolte ' s shaggy-dog Jerry is a hippie mirror_image of his Beverly Hills benefactor , played by Richard Dreyfuss . They admire each other ' s gumption -- the movie is a celebration of gumption . And Jerry , too , transmits life lessons to his benefactors , changing each of their lives for the better . The appeal in movies about the homeless has always been to a sense of community . ( And a sense of community is what we fear we have lost in modern life. ) During the Depression , the community was the hobo jungles filled with Forgotten Men , but the larger community was the traditional moneyed society these men ( and women ) sought to re-enter . In the public mind , these Forgotten were blameless for their plight . In the ' 60s , the homeless were blameless too -- they were viewed_as outcasts oppressed by society . The homeless in our current movies operate in a more divided zone . Although typically they are portrayed by Hollywood as essentially blameless for their condition , the society in which they exist is all too ready to blame them , or at least to feel a frustrated compassion . The idealization of the homeless in these movies resembles the ways in which Hollywood tends to idealize minorities in_general . There ' s an element of condescension and special_pleading in the attempt , as if we would n ' t be interested in these people if they weren ' t wiser or purer in heart than we are . The treatment denies their rage -- it pastoralizes them . It also represents a kind of charity extended_to the homeless . It ' s as if a more realistic portrayal would seem unnecessarily cruel -- yet one more injury inflicted upon them . * This idealization is about something else as well . In most movies we are encouraged to regard the characters with no thought that they , in_effect , might also be looking_back at us . But the presence of the homeless in these movies is implicitly accusatory . In real_life we may want to look_away when confronted with the real_thing -- as we enter or leave the movie_theater , perhaps . But in the movies we don ' t look_away , and there ' s a measure of guilt -- of a judgment received -- in our response . The romanticization of homeless people is a way of dignifying those who wait in judgment . We want them to think well of us . What these movies do not acknowledge is that , in the most complicated sense , they are us. *</TEXT>
