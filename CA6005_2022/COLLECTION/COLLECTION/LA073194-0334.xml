   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : MEDICAL INDUSTRY RESPONDS TO MARKET ' S TONIC DOSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the big health_care debate enters the home stretch in Congress , many particulars of the Clinton health plan -- regional alliances , health boards , employer mandates -- are mostly dead . Yet a dramatic slowdown in medical cost inflation , a stated goal of the whole exercise , is being realized as the industrialization of medicine proceeds apace . Medical costs are rising roughly 5 % to 6 % this year after more_than a decade of double-digit increases . And the trend is toward further cost containment . The medical field is getting a dose of what already has happened in the pharmaceutical industry , where benefit managers simply order lower prices on the drugs they buy for corporate health plans . Now insurance_companies and corporate health plan buyers are saying bluntly just how much they will pay_for medical procedures . And , like steel_mills and auto parts suppliers before them , hospitals , research labs and medical_practices are merging and forming alliances , seeking economies of scale to lower the cost of services . Prices are coming_down . Some hospitals that do a large volume of operations are offering open heart_surgery for $ 17 # 000 as opposed to $ 45 # 000 , the going rate in recent years . A lot of cost reduction is coming_out of doctors ' wallets . Incomes of specialists -- the higher-paid 60 % of America ' s 650 # 000 physicians -- are said to be dropping , although definitive statistics from the American Medical Assn . have not yet been published for 1993-94 . Consumers are picking_up more of the tab . The hottest item in the medical marketplace is an insurance plan called point of service that allows consumers to choose their own doctors if they shoulder higher deductibles or co-payments . Thus , consumers are asked to pay_for something -- choice of physician -- that used to be taken_for granted and paid_for by all insurance plans . The trend has been building for a_few years , so where we ' re headed is pretty clear . When and if a health bill is passed in August , U.S. medical_care will continue to be financed through employers and insurance_companies , with physicians at their financial mercy . The risk of rising costs used to fall on employers , in days when doctor and hospital bills were not questioned . Now the balance_of_power has shifted , and pools of medical service purchasers -- big companies and coalitions of small and medium-sized businesses -- are taking_advantage of an oversupply of hospitals and doctors to dictate terms . Clinton ' s plan , which in theory was to be consumer-dominated , might have been easier on doctors . Under the plan , regional alliances would have formed buying groups of 1 million or more individuals to wield market power . But doctors and hospitals might have had a better chance arguing costs with them than with the business world ' s sharp-eyed purchasing managers . In any case , the Clinton plan , which was hatched in some secrecy , was dead almost before it arrived . The public didn ' t believe White_House claims of low costs but found the insurance industry ' s Harry and Louise commercials warning of bureaucracy to be credible . The American Medical Assn . failed to get_behind Clinton ' s plan early and even now says it is only &quot; nonpartisan. &quot; But there should be no regrets , because the marketplace revolution we do have may bring good_health care at lower costs . Gresham ' s law -- of bad driving out good -- is not working in health_care . Rather , the superior organizations in U.S. medicine are likely to improve with reform , as the best companies -- Ford , Hewlett-Packard , Shell Oil and such -- have improved as their industries have constantly restructured . Premier institutions such_as Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic are making alliances nationwide . The Scripps Institute of Medicine and Science in San Diego has formed alliances with major hospitals in its area and is talking_about merging hospital operations with UC San Diego . Kaiser Permanente , a pioneer of managed health_care , has formed a joint_venture with PacifiCare , a major health_maintenance_organization . Institutions don ' t have to be large to succeed . One of the most efficient operations in the country is Mercy Hospital in Janesville , Wis. , southwest of Milwaukee , which serves as the critical care facility for a four-county area extending_to Rockford , Ill . Technology is playing a big role . The Marshfield Clinic in central Wisconsin is hooked into 65 localities via computers and telecommunications . Rural communities are no longer isolated from superior medical_care . In large cities , hospitals are specializing -- one will concentrate_on heart_surgery , another on kidney transplants -- achieving greater skill as well as economy . Productivity will rise in the medical field as it has in manufacturing and agriculture . Change was inevitable for the economics of some medical_practices . AMA statistics show incomes of some specialists -- surgeons , obstetrician-gynecologists -- almost doubling from 1982 to ' 92 . Nothing wrong with earning more , but you have to expect countervailing influences to arise in our market_economy . Analyst Kenneth Abramowitz of Sanford C . Bernstein , a New York research firm , captures the outlook in a major new report . &quot; Ten years from now , this revolutionary change will lead to far more cost-effective hospital , pharmaceutical and medical supply industries to the benefit of the most innovative companies , &quot; he writes . &quot; However , &quot; he adds , &quot; the odds do not favor a painless transition. &quot; For the long term , Abramowitz recommends major HMOs , such_as FHP International and PacifiCare , and also United Health Plans , which serves the Southeast . And he calls Johnson &amp; Johnson the best positioned health_care company in the world . Dr. Schumarry Chao , who formerly headed a clinic at County-USC Medical_Center and the medical_practice of Aetna Life &amp; Casualty , sees export opportunity -- especially in China , where she was born . &quot; With China ' s policy of one child per family and rising affluence , the demand for the best medical_care will grow , &quot; she said . &quot; And U.S. care is the best. &quot; The year of debate has not been in vain . It has focused attention on the real challenge in U.S. medical_care , which is to rein_in costs without impairing quality . To meet that challenge , the Clinton_Administration thought government had to remake the system . Instead the marketplace is adjusting , at a lot lower cost . It wasn ' t Harry and Louise who defeated the White_House , but its own lack of understanding of how the country works .</TEXT>
