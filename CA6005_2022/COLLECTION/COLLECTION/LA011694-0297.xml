   <HEADLINE> ARTICLE ON MOONING WAS A LOONY IDEA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Too_bad Scott Harris couldn ' t find a more positive topic than a story about two drunken adult delinquents ( &quot; A Random Act of Mooning , &quot; Jan . 6 ) . Too_bad the Los Angeles Times couldn ' t find a more positive article to fill that space -- better to have left it blank.Who knows how many other morons will now want to cheer us with such a view ? Since I live_in Studio City and have to drive that area on Moorpark Street between Colfax Avenue and Laurel Canyon Boulevard , I ' m worrying whether the other drivers will be looking_around for the next mooning . And who will shoulder that responsibility -- Scott Harris or the editor who approved the column for printing ? Accountability is for everyone . CHARMAINE H . BLATT Studio City</TEXT>
