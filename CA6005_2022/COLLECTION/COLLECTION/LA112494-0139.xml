   <TEXT> Every day , thousands of people in Ventura County look_to social_service agencies to provide them with something to eat . The homeless , the elderly , the poor , the homebound and others count_on free or low-cost food for their survival . Though the problem exists throughout the year , the big drive for contributions tends to center_on the holidays , when the &quot; spirit of giving &quot; is emphasized , and a &quot; happy holiday &quot; means turkey and fixings for all . Here ' s what just a handful of the many organizations are doing to help the cause : Food Share Inc. , the food_bank of Ventura County , serves 127 # 000 people countywide , year-round , said spokeswoman Dee Volz . &quot; Almost everybody who feeds the county gets food from us , &quot; she said . &quot; We have 257 nonprofit agencies in the county. &quot; The organization has begun to make a big push for its Hunger 2000 campaign , an attempt to raise enough money over the next five years to wipe_out the county ' s hunger problem . Promotional television ads featuring actress Mary Steenburgen of Ojai are scheduled to air through December . Food Share receives donations from a variety of public and private sources , including local restaurants , which provide food served as hot meals . Volz said donations of money and canned or packaged food are accepted , but that the monetary donations go further . &quot; Every dollar donated makes $ 34.88 of food going_to the hungry , &quot; she said . This time_of_year , Food Share counts heavily on in-house corporate canned_food drives , as well as public food drives . Among the latter , The Gap has a drive running_through Christmas , and Vons grocery_stores are collecting canned goods through Dec . 9 . If you ' re interested in contributing , send monetary donations to P.O. Box 4596 , Ventura , 93007 , or call 647-3944 . Donations also may be dropped_off at the Food Share warehouse at 4156 Southbank Road , Oxnard , from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday . * The Manna Conejo Valley Food_Bank , a 24-year-old organization serving areas south of the Conejo Grade , will provide about 2 1 / 2 weeks worth of groceries to 3 # 300 families over the holidays . And the organization is working with local schools and clubs to provide full holiday meals . &quot; One school wants to adopt 17 families for Christmas , &quot; said Administrator Pauline Saterbo . &quot; One of the churches has asked_for the names of 200 children . . . . First Financial Group has ( Ralphs grocery_store ) coupons to give to our clients . They ' re hoping to take_care of the fresh vegetables and fruit for the holidays. &quot; To help , call 497-4959 . * Family to Family , a program of Project Understanding , works with the Catholic Charities Program of Ventura County to supply hot meals in the Ventura and Ojai areas . The organization accepts non-perishable , unopened , generally canned goods , or monetary donations . Private donations are welcome , as is the assistance of local community groups . With the holidays in mind , De Anza Junior_High_School in Ventura held a Turkey_Trot earlier this week , with_children winning Thanksgiving turkeys -- which they were encouraged to donate to the Family to Family program . Family to Family and Catholic Charities will provide holiday food baskets to needy families in the area .
