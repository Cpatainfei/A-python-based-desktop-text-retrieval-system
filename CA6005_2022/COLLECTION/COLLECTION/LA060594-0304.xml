   <HEADLINE> GERMAN VETERANS HONOR THEIR WAR DEAD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Uninvited to D-day ceremonies , German veterans remembered fallen comrades Saturday at Normandy ' s largest cemetery , where some of their former enemies joined them in sometimes tearful reconciliation . In a cold , blowing rain , a French military_band played the_French and German national_anthems as soldiers of both countries stood at attention , encircled by the graves of more_than 21 # 000 German soldiers . Four former members of the_French Resistance held their groups ' flags before a monument to an unknown_soldier , where children laid wreaths . In French and German , officials from both countries spoke_of the losses as well as of the new Europe that rose from the ashes of World_War_II . &quot; Their graves provide witness to the horrors of war and remind us living of the memory of the death , suffering and misery of millions of human_beings , &quot; said Capt . Guenther Porrio , Germany ' s naval attache in Paris . Today , Franco-German reconciliation &quot; is of decisive importance to the evolution and future of our continent , &quot; he told the crowd of about 300 . A few miles from Omaha Beach , a low , granite entrance leads into the cemetery containing 21 # 222 graves of German soldiers , each marked with a small , flat stone . The main American cemetery nearby has about 9 # 300 graves . Most U.S. war dead were repatriated . &quot; Thank God it ' s over , that the horrible battle can ' t happen again , &quot; said a tearful Helmut Mechemer , who was 20 when he was near Pointe-du-Hoc , a rocky German stronghold assaulted by the Americans . This time he came_with American vets . &quot; We met in 1984 in Sainte-Mere-Eglise , and we ' ve been friends since then , &quot; said Warren Lloyd , 73 , of Orlando , Fla . &quot; We fought for our Deutschland , &quot; said Guenther Koehler , 68 , who was a teen-ager on D-day . &quot; We were 180 soldiers on June 6 , and at the end of the day we were three. &quot; Many cities in France have German twin cities , though hatred lingers , especially among elderly French . Plaques in some towns marking Nazi killings still refer insultingly to Germans . &quot; My first feeling is that it is very logical that the_French didn ' t invite the Germans , &quot; said Franz Meyer , in_charge of German cemeteries in Normandy and Brittany . But , he said , the Germans could be invited later -- perhaps for the 50th anniversary of Germany ' s surrender . There were emotional ceremonies as well in Norman villages and towns as thousands of veterans , many hosted by grateful French families in their homes , returned to the scene of their battles on what the local press has dubbed &quot; The Longest Weekend. &quot; At one such ceremony , 40 veterans of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division , led by Gen . Albert Smith , 75 , who landed at Omaha Beach amid carnage early on June 6 , 1944 , prayed together at the cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer , overlooking the coast . Nearly 3 # 000 Americans died fighting for that strip of sand fringed by cliffs . In a eulogy , Smith recalled the unit ' s motto : &quot; No mission too difficult , no sacrifice too great . Duty first. &quot; The veterans were saluted by 21 guns and an honor_guard from the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s military_headquarters in Mons , Belgium .</TEXT>
