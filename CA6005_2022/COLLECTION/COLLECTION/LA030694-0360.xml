   <HEADLINE> CLINTON ' S COUNSEL NUSSBAUM RESIGNS ; STAFF : PRESIDENT ACCEPTS WHITE_HOUSE LAWYER ' S LETTER WITH ' DEEP REGRET ' AS SEARCH BEGINS FOR SUCCESSOR . TALKS ON WHITEWATER-RELATED INQUIRY CAPPED SERIES OF POLITICAL GAFFES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> White_House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum resigned Saturday , bringing_to an end a yearlong tenure marked by controversy and accusations that his zealous advocacy of Bill_Clinton ' s interests had compromised the President ' s political standing . In a letter released by the White_House , Nussbaum defended his performance , saying his critics &quot; do not understand , nor wish to understand , the role and obligations of a lawyer , even one acting_as White_House counsel. &quot; Because of that , he wrote to Clinton , &quot; I now believe I can best serve you by returning to private life. &quot; Nussbaum said he will stay_on the job through April 5 to allow time for selection of a successor . The departure of the 57-year-old former New York litigator was precipitated by the controversy surrounding the Clinton_Administration ' s handling of questions related to the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas . Late Friday , Nussbaum and eight other Administration officials were subpoenaed at Whitewater special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr. ' s request regarding White_House contacts with Treasury_Department officials about their investigation into the_matter . Earlier in the week , it had been revealed that Nussbaum and other White_House staff_members met with Treasury_Department officials last fall to discuss the inquiry . White_House officials and associates of the Clintons already have begun a search for Nussbaum ' s replacement . Among those believed to be under_consideration is James Hamilton , a Washington attorney who represents the family of Vincent Foster , the White_House deputy counsel who died in an apparent suicide last summer . Joel Klein , who followed Foster as deputy counsel , has assumed many of Nussbaum ' s duties for now , particularly those involving oversight of White_House relations with the Whitewater investigation . In his letter accepting Nussbaum ' s resignation with &quot; deep regret , &quot; Clinton praised his aide , complimenting him for his role in helping select Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , FBI Director Louis J . Freeh and the more_than 60 judicial nominations the Administration has made so far . &quot; During your tenure , this Administration named the highest percentage of women and minorities to the federal judiciary in history , &quot; Clinton wrote . &quot; These judges and justices will leave a lasting imprint on our case_law , and their places on the federal bench will be clear and abiding signs of encouragement to those long excluded from administering our system of justice . &quot; They are pioneers , and yours was the lamp that lit their way. &quot; Despite Clinton ' s warm words , many officials within the White_House have long believed that Nussbaum ' s definition of his job clashed with the culture of Washington in a way that frequently created more problems for the Administration than it resolved . The triggering incident for Nussbaum ' s resignation was the storm of criticism that broke last week over meetings he attended in which White_House aides discussed aspects of the Whitewater investigation with officials of the Treasury_Department , which is investigating a defunct savings and loan once owned by former Clinton associate James B . McDougal . McDougal was the Clintons ' partner in the Whitewater real_estate deal , and one of the prime questions in the continuing investigation of the_matter is whether money from McDougal ' s savings and loan was used in any way to benefit then-Gov . Clinton . The meetings between White_House and Treasury_Department aides , critics charged , could have been used by the White_House to try to interfere with the ongoing investigation by a Treasury division known as the Resolution Trust Corp . Participants in the meetings deny any such motive , asserting that the sessions were innocent . But even Clinton has conceded they raise a problem of appearances . And that , in a nutshell , was much of Nussbaum ' s problem . In a city where political appearance can assume greater importance than underlying substance , Nussbaum frequently seemed heedless of both politics and appearances , pursuing his client ' s rights with a fixed determination to uphold them to the fullest , regardless of cost . That determination became most apparent after the death of Foster , when Nussbaum forbade police investigators to examine papers in Foster ' s office until he had sorted them and made his own determination of what was relevant and what was not . That procedure , while legally sound , raised suspicions among Clinton ' s critics that Nussbaum was trying to hide something -- suspicions that deepened months later when reporters discovered that among the papers Nussbaum did not turn_over to police were some relating to the Whitewater matter . Those papers were subsequently subpoenaed and turned_over to Fiske , who is investigating the real_estate affair and has indicated his intention to also examine the circumstances of Foster ' s death . At other times , Nussbaum ' s disregard of political realities had less to do with his legal judgment . The prime case_in_point involved the appointment of C . Lani Guinier to head the Justice_Department ' s civil_rights office . Nussbaum had responsibility for reviewing Guinier ' s writings -- including some controversial ideas on voting_rights -- but failed to realize the political storm they would cause and did not bring them to Clinton ' s attention . The result was a political disaster in which Clinton , eventually , had to abandon his old friend ' s nomination , alienating both her and many of his black supporters .</TEXT>
