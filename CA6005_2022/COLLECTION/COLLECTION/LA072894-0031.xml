   <HEADLINE> MUSIC REVIEW ; RHAPSODIC HUNGARIANS BRING BIT OF BUDAPEST TO BOWL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Budapest Festival Orchestra , which made its U.S. debut on Tuesday with the first of four different programs at the Hollywood Bowl , isn ' t the smoothest-running symphonic apparatus in the world . It doesn ' t pretend to be . Formed only 11 years ago , the ensemble didn ' t begin full-time operations until 1992 . Although the youthful players assembled by conductor Ivan Fischer don ' t seem to make finesse a primary goal , they do muster a lot of gusto . Under the right conditions , a lot of gusto can go_a_long_way . The conditions were right , for the most part , on this occasion . Our rhapsodic Hungarian visitors exuded warmth and sincerity that often compensated for rough technical edges . The Bowl hardly provides an ideal acoustical showcase for any orchestra these days . The amplified sound tends toward dullness , and the microphones exaggerate the separation of choirs . It is difficult to gauge how the Budapest band might sound in an indoor concert_hall . In the wide open spaces , the strings seemed resonant , the brass raucous and the winds thin . Precision of articulation tended to give_way to cozy approximation -- a performance practice the Germans like to call Schlamperei . Opening-night nerves may have taken their toll . Still , the spirits were willing . Unless one counts the elegiac Hungarian anthem that followed a very stately &quot; Star-Spangled Banner , &quot; the introductory agenda avoided native impulses until encore time . Even then , with two Hungarian Dances of Brahms , the nationalism came second-hand . At least a little Liszt was scheduled for Wednesday night . Fischer , who first appeared with the Los Angeles Philharmonic back in 1983 , is something of an old-fashioned romanticist . He favors sentimental rhetoric and broad tempos , especially when cadences loom . He also savors the impact of flexibility . He may allow certain transitions to sag . He invariably rises , however , to the zonking climaxes . Unlike many_a more famous maestro , he doesn ' t seem to take much for granted when riding tired warhorses to battle . that ' s a good thing . It turned_out to be especially good in a program that began -- blithely -- with the hum-along platitudes of Schubert ' s &quot; Rosamunde &quot; overture and ended -- grandly -- with the familiar convolutions of Brahms ' Symphony No . 1 . The fun came_in between , thanks to the soloist , Lynn Harrell . The American cellist made an appropriately elegant and silly escapade of Haydn ' s Concerto in C , Hob . VIIb : 1 , interpolating his own wildly comic cadenza in the opening movement . Then , equally inspired , he played Tchaikovsky ' s &quot; Rococo &quot; Variations with mock nonchalance that masked bravura complexity . In both challenges , his tone was rich , his expressive scale mellow , his range of dynamic nuance subtle . Too_bad the amplification system destroyed any semblance of natural balance , exaggerating the cello at the expense of the orchestra . * Incidental intelligence : * A program insert memorialized Rudolf Firkusny , grand seigneur of the keyboard , who died last week at 82 . A musical tribute would have been better . * The attendance figure was officially tabulated at a modest 7 # 964 ( the Bowl can accommodate as much as 18 # 000 ) . The concert , occasionally embellished with police-siren obbligatos , also attracted 11 noisy airplanes and one friendly skunk .</TEXT>
