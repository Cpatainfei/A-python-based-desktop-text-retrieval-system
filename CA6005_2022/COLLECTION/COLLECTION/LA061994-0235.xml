The Wilshire Community Safety Network database would include information on crime prevention , resource directories , maps and census data , as well as articles on community policing and community bulletin_board items , said George Richter , a member of the board . No confidential or sensitive police or private information would be included . The goal of the plan is to link all community groups and individuals who are committed to improving public safety and increasing communication within and between neighborhoods and between citizens and the police , Richter said .

The board ' s mission is to help the Police_Department implement community-based policing in the Wilshire Division and bring community concerns to the attention of the police . In addition , the board wants to mobilize community volunteers to support the efforts of the police and supplement the department ' s human and technical resources . Information : ( 213 ) 470-9900 .
