   <HEADLINE> NEXT STEP ; TINY VILLAGE GREETS GAMES WITH NORWEGIAN RESERVE ; * LILLEHAMMER FOLK TRY TO CARRY_ON NORMALLY WHILE AWAITING THE ONSLAUGHT OF 100 # 000 OLYMPIC FANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan epic may be the hot pre-Olympic story in the United States , but here it draws a cluck , a shake of the head , occasionally a blank stare . Here , in this vest-pocket city of the XVII Olympic Winter Games , the folks have other fish to fry . And bake . And poach . And simmer in sauce . It ' s an extraordinary time in this otherwise ordinary Norwegian community , these last few days before it all comes_down , and almost everybody is trying to carry_on in a reasonably ordinary fashion . that ' s a little difficult , though , when you don ' t know what to expect . And no matter how exuberantly the politicians and Olympic types spout the successful-Games line , Sven Citizen isn ' t quite sure just what will happen , or how he feels about it all . There is pride , of course , that of all_the cities in all_the world , this city will have the Winter_Olympics . But there is a little Norwegian reserve working here too -- and maybe even the niggling suspicion that maybe , just maybe , this little city might have taken too big a bite . Some who are old enough remember another little city with big ambitions -- Lake Placid , N.Y. , in 1980 -- and the fiasco it pulled_down over its ears . Those Winter Games will forever be remembered for the U.S. hockey_team ' s &quot; Miracle on Ice &quot; and Eric Heiden ' s five gold medals in speedskating while thousands of ticketed fans -- of hockey , speedskating and other events -- sat marooned in outlying parking_lots , unable to get where they wanted to be because of a colossal transportation snafu . Lake Placid ' s plan was to close the city to vehicular_traffic , direct the car-borne fans to those outlying lots and take them by bus to the various venues . It probably would have worked , if someone had ordered the buses . Lillehammer ' s plan is to close the Olympic region to vehicular_traffic , direct the car-borne fans to outlying parking_lots and take them by bus to the various venues . But the folks in the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee say they have ordered the buses and have been stressing for years that public transportation , not private cars , is the right way to these Games . Extra train services to Lillehammer have been set_up , especially from Oslo , where up_to six trains an hour are scheduled to depart each day of the Olympics . So , nobody is really expecting another Lake Placid . But . . . &quot; This is normally a town for 23 # 000 people , &quot; said Oyvind Kvernen , a clerk in the Sport and Fritid sports shop . &quot; I think the transportation will work , but each day ( there ) will be 100 # 000 people here . Each day ! that ' s too many people all at once . that ' s too tough for the city . Transporting all those people . . . . I hope it will work. &quot; As long as they ' re coming , though , Sport and Fritid wants some of what they ' re bringing with them and is holding_up its end of the Olympic souvenir market . There are gloves , pass holders , fanny packs and T-shirts , all bearing the Lillehammer ' 94 emblem -- the northern lights , snow_flurries , the Olympic rings and &quot; Lillehammer ' 94 &quot; -- right in there with the ski_jackets , parkas , cross-country equipment and Lakers , San Francisco 49ers and Boston Celtics caps . Kvernen reported that business has been better than usual , with the real bonanza still several days away . &quot; that ' s when the wealthy tourists will come , &quot; he said . But there will be no gouging , he added : &quot; If we don ' t take the prices up , then the tourists will return . Otherwise , the people will say Norway is very expensive and not come back. &quot; Over at Foto Olsen , where they are putting_in a &quot; pro shop &quot; in anticipation of a run_on rental photographic_equipment , Lars Erik Skraefsrud shared some of Kvernen ' s concern . &quot; It ' s going_to be hectic , &quot; he said . &quot; It will be fun while it lasts and most people are pretty excited , but I think some will be relieved when it ' s over . I think the transportation will work , but I don ' t know what 100 # 000 people will do. &quot; Neither did Lisbeth Berntsen in G.C. Lunde ' s bakery , where the windows are decorated on one side with gingerbread Olympic scenes and frosted gingerbread evergreens , and on the other with three decorated cakes , two in honor of Lillehammer ' 94 and one recalling the ' 52 Oslo Winter Games . &quot; I don ' t know if there ' s a place for everybody , &quot; she said . Not to worry , said Eva Snilsberg of the Lillehammer Turist Kontor . Everything is going_to work_out just fine . &quot; Lots of people and lots going_on , &quot; she said . &quot; And most are already impressed with Lillehammer . The sun is shining and it ' s lovely here when the sun is shining . That makes all_the difference in the world. &quot; And just down the block , Harald Belsvik has auctioned_off T-shirt No . 993 , the one proclaiming seven more days till the Games begin , for 6 # 800 Norwegian_kroner . He started at 1 # 000 days till the Games and has been auctioning a shirt a day for more_than three years on Storgata , a pedestrian shopping_mall , turning the proceeds over to the Lillehammer organizing committee . Not many shirts are left , not many days are left before Saturday ' s opening ceremony . &quot; We ' ve been working_on this for several years , so I ' m happy it ' s coming , &quot; Belsvik said . &quot; But in a way , I ' ll be happy to see it end , because the town will be back to normal. &quot; Not an unpopular sentiment in this little Olympic city . BACKGROUND Lillehammer , 110 miles north of Oslo , is in the Troll Park Area , a region popular for Alpine and cross-country_skiing and named for the mischievous dwarfs of local legend . Tiny Lillehammer ' s most famous native , by some accounts , is Thor Bjorkland , inventor of the cheese slicer . With a population of 23 # 000 , it is the smallest city to host the Winter_Olympics since Lake Placid , N.Y. , in 1980 .</TEXT>
