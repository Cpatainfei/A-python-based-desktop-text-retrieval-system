   <HEADLINE> COURT CLEARS JUDGE INVOLVED WITH MOBSTER ; APPEALS : CONVICTIONS OF ROBERT P . AGUILAR ARE REVERSED . HE HAD PASSED WORD OF A FEDERAL WIRETAP TO A REPUTED FORMER MURDER INC . KILLER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal appeals court in San Francisco on Tuesday reversed the convictions of U.S. District Judge Robert P . Aguilar for obstructing justice and leaking word to an aging mobster that he was being wiretapped by the Justice_Department . The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Aguilar ' s conduct did not violate the federal laws he was charged with breaking . Unless the Supreme Court overrules the 9th Circuit decision , the charges against the San Jose judge will be dismissed . &quot; I feel great and the judge feels twice as good , &quot; said Paul B . Meltzer , a Santa Cruz attorney who represented Aguilar in the appeal . &quot; When I called to give him the news , his first words were , ' Thank God. ' He ' s very relieved. &quot; A 1980 appointee of President Jimmy_Carter , Aguilar , 63 , was only the third federal judge to be convicted of a felony , and the first in California . Aguilar ' s troubles began in 1987 when law_enforcement officers on an organized crime investigation spotted him having lunch with Abe ( Trigger ) Chapman , a longtime family friend who had served four prison_terms . The head of the FBI ' s San Francisco office told Robert Peckham , chief U.S. district judge in Northern California , about the sighting . Trying to warn his colleague that being seen with Chapman -- a reputed mob killer and member of the infamous gang Murder Inc. -- would create the appearance of an impropriety , Peckham told Aguilar in August , 1987 , that Chapman ' s name had come_up in the course of a wiretap application . Aguilar joked to Peckham that the Chapman he knew was &quot; a senile old_man who waddled when he walked. &quot; Six months later , though , after spotting people he believed to be FBI_agents outside his house , Aguilar told his nephew about the tap and the nephew relayed the information to Chapman . In June , 1989 , federal prosecutors accused the judge of eight felonies , including warning Chapman about the wiretap . It was also alleged that Aguilar attempted to sway another federal judge , Stanley A . Weigel , to give lenient treatment to former Teamster leader Rudy Tham , who was trying to persuade Weigel to reverse his conviction for embezzling union funds . At trial , Aguilar told a San Francisco jury that he had taken actions that had embarrassed him , his court and his family , but he denied committing a crime . The judge ' s first trial ended with a hung jury . Three charges , including a racketeering count , were dropped before a retrial began in 1990 . Then , in November , 1990 , a jury convicted Aguilar of disclosing to Chapman that he was the subject of an FBI wiretap . The jury also convicted Aguilar of obstructing justice when he lied to FBI_agents in 1988 about his efforts to intervene on behalf of Tham . The judge was acquitted of three other charges . Aguilar was sentenced to six months in jail , far below the normal term under federal sentencing guidelines . Last year , a three-judge 9th Circuit panel upheld the wiretapping conviction but reversed the conviction for obstruction of justice . Both sides appealed , resulting in a hearing before an 11-judge panel that led to Tuesday ' s decision . The appeals court ruled 11 to that Aguilar ' s statements to the FBI did not obstruct a grand_jury investigation because he did not attempt to coerce or persuade FBI_agents to testify falsely before the grand_jury . &quot; There is no evidence that Judge Aguilar tried to tell the FBI how to testify , tried to persuade them not to testify , or tried to dissuade them from testifying as_to what their investigation otherwise revealed , &quot; according to the majority_opinion by Appellate Judge Procter Hug Jr . &quot; The only evidence is that he made false and misleading statements to the FBI regarding his contacts with Chapman &quot; -- an old friend of Tham -- and with Tham ' s lawyer Edward Solomon . Aguilar was not charged with the crime of lying to the FBI . On the other issue , the appeals court ruled 9 to 2 that Aguilar did not violate the wiretapping law because the authorization for the wiretap in_question had expired eight months before he warned Chapman . &quot; The plain language of the statute makes_it clear that the purpose of the statute is to prevent interference &quot; with an existing or pending wiretap , according to the majority_opinion . &quot; Giving_notice of an expired wiretap authorization or application is not a violation , &quot; Hug wrote . Hug added that interpreting the law to prohibit disclosures for an indefinite period_of_time would create the possibility that citizens ' free speech rights would be violated . Hug was joined in his opinion by eight judges -- five of whom , like him , were appointed by Carter and three of whom were appointed by Ronald Reagan . Circuit Judges Ferdinand Fernandez , a George_Bush appointee , and J . Clifford Wallace , a Richard Nixon , appointee , dissented . &quot; It cannot be doubted that Judge Aguilar conveyed information to Chapman with the intent to impede interception &quot; of the wiretap , the dissenters wrote . The fact that the original wiretap authorization had expired was irrelevant , the dissenters said , particularly since another one had been issued and was in_effect at the time Aguilar warned Chapman . A Justice_Department spokesman said the agency would make no comment until department attorneys had reviewed the 9th Circuit ruling . Any decision to appeal_to the Supreme Court would have to be approved by Solicitor_General Drew Days III , said Justice_Department spokesman John Russell . Robert D . Luskin of Washington , D.C. , Aguilar ' s other attorney , expressed confidence that Tuesday ' s ruling would not be overturned by the Supreme Court if the Justice_Department appeals . &quot; The government has never used the theories they used against Judge Aguilar in any other criminal prosecution , &quot; Luskin said . &quot; And there is no reported case in which a federal_court of appeals has upheld the use of these statutes in the way the Justice_Department wanted to use them in this case. &quot; Aguilar has been out on bail since his 1990 convictions , but retained his judge ' s title and salary . He has handled settlement conferences for other judges , but has not presided over formal court hearings . On Tuesday , Aguilar ' s attorney , Meltzer , said the judge intends &quot; to resume a full caseload as soon as possible , &quot; including criminal cases . Meltzer said he did not think it would be a problem for Aguilar to preside over cases lodged by his former accuser -- the Justice_Department . Aguilar ' s office referred all calls to Meltzer . &quot; I think if you were to ask the majority of government lawyers who appeared before Judge Aguilar , they would tell you he ' s been quite fair , &quot; Meltzer said . The U.S. attorney ' s office in San Jose did not return a call seeking comment . At a 1990 sentencing hearing , Meltzer told the trial_judge that Judge Aguilar &quot; knows he has disappointed thousands of people who looked_to him as a role model. &quot; On Tuesday , Meltzer said that in hindsight , Aguilar should not have maintained his relationship with Chapman . &quot; It was an error of judgment to allow himself to be too open_to people he should have shunned , &quot; Melzer said .</TEXT>
