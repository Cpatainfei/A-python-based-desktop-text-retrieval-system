   <HEADLINE> SANTA ANITA DERBY ; BIG BROCCO BEATS A SMALL FIELD ; HORSE_RACING : HE ' S THE BEST OF SIX , DEFEATING TABASCO CAT AND STRODES CREEK IN A STRETCH DUEL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Cubby Broccoli and his wife , Dana , bought this oversized 2-year-old and decided to call him Brocco , they bounced the name off their trainer , Randy Winick . &quot; Brocco ? &quot; Winick said . &quot; What kind of a name is that ? &quot; &quot; If he wins some races , &quot; Cubby Broccoli said , &quot; then you ' ll know what kind of a name it is. &quot; Brocco was a winner the first time he got_to the races , last summer at Del Mar , and he has done little else since . The chestnut colt ' s fourth victory in six starts came Saturday in the $ 500 # 000 Santa Anita Derby , and the three-quarter-length victory over Tabasco Cat will send the Broccolis and Winick to Churchill Downs with the favorite or second choice for the Kentucky_Derby on May 7 . &quot; Oh , I don ' t know who the favorite will be back there , &quot; Winick said . &quot; Right now , I ' m not worried about that . If Holy Bull_ran big in the Blue Grass ( next Saturday at Keeneland ) , I guess he could be the favorite . If my horse is the favorite , or the third or fourth choice , that ' s immaterial . Whatever price they make my horse , so be it . At any price , I think he ' ll have something to do with the outcome. &quot; The 57th Santa Anita Derby wasn ' t what was advertised a week ago , and if the race had been run a day later , the attrition_rate might have reduced the field to a match race . On Wednesday , trainer Ron McAnally , whose Valiant Nature had handed Brocco one of his two defeats , in December ' s Hollywood Futurity , decided that his colt would be better_off facing Holy Bull in the Blue Grass . Then Saturday morning , Soul Of The Matter , who won the San Felipe on March 20 as Brocco and Valiant Nature ran 2-3 , was scratched because of a minor injury related to the cracked hoof that had bothered him earlier . The additional scratches of longshots Pollock ' s Luck , who has a fever and cough , and Wild Invader , who is going_to run next Saturday in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct , added_up to a six-horse field . Tabasco Cat , more experienced than any of the other starters , was beaten for the fourth time in nine starts , finishing one length ahead of Strodes Creek , who had five lengths on his stablemate , Numerous . Robannier finished fifth , and Fly ' n J . Bryan , the pacesetter who started to tire at the half-mile pole , was last . Favored Brocco paid $ 3.40 to win , earning $ 275 # 000 for running 1 1 / 8 miles in 1:48 1 / 5 , which was 1 1 / 5 seconds slower than the stakes record . Wayne Lukas , who trains Tabasco Cat , and Charlie Whittingham , the trainer of both Strodes Creek and Numerous , indicated that their horses would also run in the Kentucky_Derby , which is an eighth of a mile longer than Saturday ' s race . Winick made no apologies for not having Valiant Nature and Soul Of The Matter_to beat Saturday . &quot; We did what we had to do , &quot; the trainer said . &quot; We had no control over the horses that weren ' t here. &quot; Gary Stevens , one of the most successful jockeys to ride in the Santa Anita Derby , was aboard Brocco for the sixth consecutive time . In 10 tries , Stevens has never been worse than fourth in the stake . He has won the race four times , including last year with Personal Hope , and has added two seconds , one third and three fourths . The last jockey to win the Santa Anita Derby in successive years was Laffit Pincay , with Solar Salute and Sham in 1972-73 . Stevens gave Brocco a canny ride , letting him settle into third place , behind Fly ' n J . Bryan and Tabasco Cat . Brocco trailed by seven lengths after a half-mile and moved_up steadily on the far turn . At the quarter pole , Tabasco Cat passed Fly ' n J . Bryan , and even though he ran a gritty race , Brocco was able to overtake him with about a sixteenth of a mile left . Stevens hand rode Brocco to the wire . &quot; Tabasco Cat hung_in there a little longer than I anticipated , &quot; Stevens said . &quot; When Pat ( Day ) popped his horse on the shoulder at the quarter pole and got no response at all , I thought I had them any time I wanted . When I went_up and eyeballed Tabasco Cat , he kind of rebroke and made a horse_race out of it until the sixteenth pole . Then I went_ahead and asked my horse for his best . I never did use the stick ( whip ) , because I didn ' t feel there was any need to . He was holding Tabasco Cat at_bay , and there was nobody coming. &quot; The filly Winning Colors , Stevens ' first Santa Anita Derby winner , also won the Kentucky_Derby in 1988 , as they held_off Day and Forty Niner by a neck at the wire . Tabasco Cat lost for the first time as a 3-year-old , but Day wasn ' t discouraged . &quot; It was a big effort , &quot; Day said . &quot; I was pleased with everything except the outcome . I would think that this race would set him up perfectly for Kentucky. &quot; Strodes Creek , making his first stakes appearance , now has two wins , a second and a third in four starts , all under Corey Black . &quot; I thought he was the winner on the turn , &quot; Black said . &quot; He kind of lost his momentum when we straightened for home . Changing ( lead feet ) , he got all imbalanced , and that ' s when Brocco and Tabasco Cat really got_away from him. &quot; Cubby Broccoli , the 85-year-old producer of many of the James Bond films , helped pick_out Brocco at a 2-year-old sale at Pomona . &quot; I liked him because he was a huge horse , &quot; Broccoli said . &quot; He was big , just enormous . He reminded ( me ) of some of the horses I used to watch at Del Mar , when I was around old-school chaps like Bing Crosby , Louie B . Mayer and Lin Howard . I was ill the day he won the Breeders ' Cup ( Juvenile ) , so this is a bigger thrill than that win . &quot; He ' s the best horse I ' ve ever had , and it looks_like he ' s on his way to bigger things . Should he be the favorite in Kentucky ? that ' s not up_to me . It ' s up_to the people who have to make those judgments. &quot;</TEXT>
