   <HEADLINE> U.N. EXPECTS TO RESUME TROOP FLIGHTS ; BOSNIA : REOPENING OF SARAJEVO ' S AIRPORT WOULD BE FIRST IN NEARLY A MONTH . KARADZIC ' S VOWS CREDITED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Banking on goodwill pledges that the Bosnian Serb leader made to former President Jimmy_Carter , the U.N. Protection Force said it expects to resume troop-rotation flights to the Sarajevo airport today for the first time in nearly a month . The likely reopening of the airport is seen as a key test of the sincerity of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic , who this week professed a new willingness to settle the intractable civil_war . The airport in the Bosnian capital has been closed since Nov . 21 , when the Bosnian Serbs rescinded safe-passage guarantees in retaliation for North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization air strikes against the Serbs ' targets . &quot; Troop rotation is a very normal activity , &quot; U.N. spokeswoman Claire Grimes said . &quot; This would mean a speck of normalization is appearing on the horizon. &quot; In an effort to draw Carter into the peace process , possibly as early as Sunday , Karadzic put_forward six proposals to ease the tense standoff in Bosnia-Herzegovina , including resuming flights at the airport , ensuring free movement of humanitarian relief convoys and instituting a cease-fire in the Sarajevo area . Skeptical U.N. officials and the Muslim-led Bosnian government have taken a wait-and-see attitude toward the proposals , saying their implementation would only restore the status_quo before relations rapidly deteriorated this fall . But officials acknowledged that any movement would constitute progress , and on Friday the United Nations cautiously indicated that Karadzic appeared to be fulfilling at least some of his pledges . U.N. officials backed_off earlier reports that hinted that Bosnian Serbs were probably responsible_for an attack on a U.N. helicopter near Sarajevo on Thursday . An investigation Friday revealed that the helicopter , which was struck in the tail with 12 rounds of small-arms fire , never passed_over territory controlled by the Bosnian Serb army , meaning it was probably fired upon by Bosnian government forces . Although intense fighting continued near the Muslim farm town of Velika Kladusa in northwest Bosnia , the perpetrators there have been Croatian Serbs and rebel Muslims not directly under Karadzic ' s command . Further south in Bihac , where Bosnian Serbs had been shelling regularly , it was relatively quiet Friday for the first time in days , a U.N. spokeswoman said . * Relief officials said a convoy with 120 tons of food that had been delayed for 48 hours at Croatian Serb checkpoints was permitted into Bihac , although it was unclear what role Karadzic might have played in getting_it through . The convoy was only the second in a month to reach the U.N.-declared &quot; safe area , &quot; where 180 # 000 people have barely enough food to survive . &quot; The people of Bihac have had only an ounce of food a day arrive in the last 6 1 / 2 months , &quot; said Peter Kessler of the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees . &quot; They have been sustaining themselves off stocks and the summer harvest . They will need a lot more_than this. &quot; In another small sign of progress , the Bosnian Serbs also signed_off Friday on an additional 13 relief convoys into Sarajevo over the next three weeks , which would mean 3 # 500 tons of food and supplies for the depleted capital , Kessler said . Even with a surge in convoys , only about half of Sarajevo ' s needs can be met without a resumption of the humanitarian airlift .
