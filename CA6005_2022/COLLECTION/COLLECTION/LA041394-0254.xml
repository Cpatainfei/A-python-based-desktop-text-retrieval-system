   <HEADLINE> U.S. WARNS MUSLIMS AGAINST TAKING_ADVANTAGE OF STRIKES ; BALKANS : AMERICA MUST PERSUADE SERBS TO END GORAZDE SIEGE WITHOUT ENCOURAGING THEIR FOES TO INTENSIFY BID FOR LOST LAND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton on Tuesday warned Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina against trying to take_advantage of the allied air strikes outside the city of Gorazde by intensifying their fight against the Bosnian Serbs , saying both sides must now go_back to the peace table . &quot; We have cautioned the Bosnian government forces not to try to take_advantage of this and violate the understandings themselves , &quot; Clinton told reporters here . The State_Department issued a similar statement later , urging all sides to resume negotiations . The President made his remarks in response to earlier reports that the Muslim-led Bosnian government had resumed its shelling of the Bosnian Serbs -- apparently to provoke them into firing their artillery and thus risking further NATO air strikes . Serbian batteries were_quiet Tuesday . The unusual American warning to the Bosnian government reflected a major dilemma in the Clinton_Administration ' s current strategy : how to persuade the Serbs to end their siege of the mostly Muslim city of Gorazde without simultaneously encouraging their foes to step_up their bid to regain lost territory . At the same time , Clinton left open the possibility that the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization might broaden its air_attacks to the five other U.N. &quot; safe haven &quot; cities besides Gorazde , where the last two days ' air strikes have taken_place . &quot; I would n ' t rule anything out , &quot; he said . Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , had suggested Monday that the model used by NATO in Gorazde could be applied to the other U.N. safe zones as well . At the least , she said , it should &quot; be seen as a signal for the other safe havens. &quot; But officials indicated that the Administration still is split over whether the arrangement used in Gorazde should be extended_to other cities . Although the State_Department has been willing to widen the military operation in Bosnia , the Pentagon has been opposed . It was unclear how serious a problem the Bosnian government ' s new aggressiveness ultimately will prove to be for the peace process , or whether Bosnian Serb gunners will remain silent today or resume shelling , as their leaders threatened during Tuesday ' s hiatus . George Kenney , an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , said that the dilemma posed by the Bosnian government is &quot; potentially a really serious problem , &quot; particularly since Washington has refused to spell_out what terms it wants the Muslims to accept . &quot; It ' s not enough to say , ' Let ' s go_back to the table , ' &quot; Kenney said in a telephone_interview . &quot; If we ' re serious about an outcome , we ' ll have to tell everyone involved that we want them to accept something they don ' t like . And that includes the Muslims as well. &quot; The developments came as the Administration continued to try to smooth_over earlier protests by the Russians that they had not been consulted before NATO launched its air strikes on Sunday . Clinton said he was &quot; very encouraged &quot; that the Russians had resumed pressing the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde . He said he had assured Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin that Washington has no interest in_using NATO ' s air_power to affect the outcome of the war . The State_Department disclosed that Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher spoke by telephone with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev on Tuesday to make a similar point . Yeltsin himself once again stopped short of condemning the NATO air strikes -- though he did say , on a visit to Spain on Tuesday , that the air action may have dampened Moscow ' s enthusiasm for joining NATO ' s Partnership for Peace program . Even so , the bristling in Moscow continued , as Russian lawmakers denounced the air strikes and the Foreign Ministry said that Russia &quot; will never put_up with the role of a so-called junior partner who is informed only after the fact. &quot; Analysts said that the issue might well heat_up in Russia today when the Duma , the lower house of Parliament , is expected to discuss the situation . Some factions already have drawn_up a draft resolution accusing the United States of fanning the conflict . At the same time , the White_House won bipartisan backing for its current policy in Bosnia as congressional leaders of both parties -- summoned by Clinton for a private briefing -- told reporters that they support the U.S. actions there . Rep . Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) , the House minority whip , said that there is &quot; overwhelming support &quot; for using U.S.-led air strikes to support U.N. ground forces around Gorazde if the Bosnian Serbs continue to shell the city in the face of international pressure . House Minority_Leader Robert H . Michel ( R-Ill. ) echoed Clinton ' s warning to the Bosnian government , saying that he hopes it &quot; would not be provoking these incidents that we hear about. &quot; He said American policy in the region is to press both sides to resume peace talks . The Pentagon said Tuesday that more reports showed only one explosion from the four conventional , 500-pound Mark-82 gravity bombs that U.S. Marine F / A-18 warplanes targeted on Bosnian Serb forces Monday . Kathleen deLaski , Defense_Department spokeswoman , said two of the bombs did not go_off when they hit the ground and a third jammed on the wing-carriage of one of the jets and could not be released . The Pentagon had said previously the raid destroyed a tank and several armored vehicles . It said Tuesday no tank had been hit . U.S. officials said such problems with bombs can occur . But deLaski said that authorities are examining the bombs stored at Aviano , Italy , where the F / A-18s are based , to be sure they are in_order . Bombs released in a similar raid on Sunday all exploded . Times staff writer Carey Goldberg in Moscow contributed to this report .</TEXT>
