   <HEADLINE> THE DANGER OF A FUZZY CALCULUS ; FED ' S LATEST INTEREST_RATE HIKE SEEMS TO BE BASED ON CRUDE BENCHMARKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Federal_Reserve_Board ' s latest move -- a breathtaking increase of three-quarters of a percentage_point in two key federal interest_rate marks -- strikes us as a huge gamble . For this was the sixth and largest such increase of the year , and there still isn ' t any evidence of significant inflation in the recovering American economy . Does that mean the Fed ' s plan is working ? Or that the Fed ' s plan is overwrought ? From the perspective of Southern California , a relapse into recession is feared far more_than inflation amid a roaring recovery . The worry here is that , to quote Jerry Jasinowski of the National Assn . of Manufacturers , &quot; The Fed is fundamentally misreading the economy . . . . While the economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter , there is not much evidence of inflation. &quot; So why raise interest_rates yet again , and by three-quarters of a point ? For one thing , the Fed is looking_at a national economic expansion and not just at California . Perhaps another important answer is that Fed officials actually may be less preoccupied with hedging the nation ' s bets against future inflation than shoring_up the besieged U.S. dollar , which these days is getting precious little respect on world currency markets . Rising interest_rates here tend to lure foreign money into American accounts . And that tends to improve the dollar ' s standing as a currency that is traded against other national currencies . Whatever the motive , the question remains : Is the Fed making the right move ? Our sense is that the Fed ' s policy analyses are driven by tenuous calculations . They tend to be based on statistics about the economy that more resemble rough benchmarks than precise calibrations . They also depend_on macroeconomic models that may or may_not reflect the full reality of the complex American economy . There are still a whole_lot of people out_of_work , a whole_lot of people trying to close escrow , a whole_lot of companies trying to borrow money to get started or to expand . The Fed may prove correct in concluding that higher interest_rates are a good thing . But we are concerned about what they mean for California , and the decision overall is based on a lot of maybes .</TEXT>
