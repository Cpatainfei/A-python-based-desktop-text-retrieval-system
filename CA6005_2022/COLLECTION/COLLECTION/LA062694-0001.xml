   <TEXT> The shameful memory market , where Ian Buruma ' s remarkable book takes us , has many stalls . Perhaps there has been in the whole of history no more murderous an age , no period more productive of pain -- of death , dislocation and despair -- than our own century . Our civilization has found new ways to go mad , contrived fresh methods of mass destruction , gone_to_wars as if wars were parties , and created several calamities to signal that it has outdone nature ' s most glamorous disasters . Consequently , like the plume of the Bomb , guilt ' s contamination grows . Commencing at ground zero , the guilty are , first , those who did_it ; second , those who ordered it done ; third , those who made_possible its doing ; fourth , those who proposed it ; fifth , those who justified it ; sixth , those who applauded it ; seventh , those who profited from it ; eighth , those whose job it was to obscure and deny it ; ninth , those who knew about it but did nothing ; tenth , those who did not know of it but ought to have known ; and if it is the dropping of the Bomb , or if it is the rape of Nanking , or if it is the loss of World_War I or II , or the Holocaust it self , then perhaps it may be that even the children of the guilty are guilty , that groups are guilty , that races , nations , languages should bear the blame ( the victims are guiltiest of all ) , or if you wish to go that far , that man himself -- man ' s cruel character and evil nature -- is at_fault . With so_much that is painful to remember , our period is one in which forgetting is fundamental ; yet , paradoxically , we occupy a time when most news travels in a flash , and bad news in a blink . To cover our ears and comfort our conscience , we have learned to make_noise , for in the din our attention can wander . In this examination of the very different ways in which Germany and Japan have dealt with the legacy of World_War_II , Buruma makes clear and distinct the voices that make_up this babble . By moving_back_and_forth between the tender memory centers in these countries -- Auschwitz , Hiroshima , and Nanking -- and by concentrating_on the courtroom with its judgments and defenses , the schoolroom with its textbooks and official explanations , and the museum with its &quot; educational &quot; displays , he allows us to distinguish one excuse from another , to catch an accusation here , a confession there -- through the usual stages of denial , explanation and counterclaim , sordid and shameful recollection , recognition and acceptance . But he also permits us to review , like a regiment , long ranks of resentment , to listen to blame played as if by a brass_band , to observe how the Left ' s wings flap from side to side to keep the Right ' s from flight , while the Right ' s wings fold to bring the whole bird down . Like a technician , he separates the sounds so we can hear the huckstering of horrors , too , as countless anxious interests try to clear the air , clean the slate , escape or confront that demon -- truth -- while making a profit , gaining an advantage for their policies , justifying the punishments they are about to inflict on their enemies , maintaining their moral superiority and fond self-regard . To follow the fate of the memories of atrocity and defeat in Germany and Japan , Buruma monitors the media , does his local history homework , attends the theater , reads novelists , visits sites , memorials and museums , and conducts numerous interviews with as_many participants and whistle-blowers and apologists as will speak_to him . He draws them out wonderfully , often with painfully paradoxical results , as was the case with Azuma Shiro , an 81-year-old veteran of the Japanese Imperial Army who had come_forward to embarrass the regime with an account of the behavior of Japanese soldiers during the Invasion of China . Women were raped as a matter_of_course , and then killed lest they bear_witness rather than bastards ; rape , after all , was against military regulations . Since Azuma was suffering from a venereal_disease at the time , he abstained , a restraint whose point might pass many of us by in_view of the murders which concealed the crime . One has to wonder , as well , if the women might have been spared their lives had the army had no such rule against rape , but rather had advised its soldiers to have fun , fornicate and bring shame to the families of their enemies , as the Serbs seem to have intended . And who is more guilty : the bureaucrat who signed the order , or the camp guard who herded the allegedly infested to the showers ? Is it praiseworthy to have distanced yourself from your acts by letting George do_it when what George does is to assault a helpless naked woman in the mud she will be murdered in ? Is it more villainous to have fashioned a fine blade , or to have used it to decapitate an enemy ? To have pondered the most efficient way to burn stacks of bodies , or to have stacked and burned them according to the most efficient way ? To have bottled nerve_gas or invented it ? To have flown the Enola Gray or chalked some braggish insult on the side of the Bomb ? Questions . . . questions . . . how they continue . Are the books I read before I marched patriotically off to battle to be blamed ? Are authoritarian parents part of it ? Love of church or country ? Is romantic music responsible ? Obscurantist philosophy ? A feudal history ? And there is always the runaway consequences of unbridled power . Guilty all , maybe , Cain included , though not_guilty equally or in the same way . Anyway , the war is over , the camps are closed , the soldiers have come_home , from the homes they ' ve burned , to happy hearths and loving wives . Normality needs to be restored . Pride needs to be regained . Why dwell_on the disagreeable ? Let us go_forward into a financially fine future . &quot; The Wages of Guilt &quot; is dotted with vivid accounts of the hatred and harassment endured by both Germans and Japanese who have persisted_in the pursuit of unpleasant truths . But Buruma does not exonerate even these truth seekers , for he understands how condemning people can turn_into a great sport . Hoist on a newly won piety , we can hide our own bad acts behind the crimes of others . The responsibility for our presently unpleasant state lies elsewhere than ourselves : A ruler we once thought divine is to blame ; a general of unimpeachable character and skills proved cowardly and stupid ; a weapon of unheard-of horror did us in ; and we were , of course , lied to by everybody , by our judges and priests and teachers and leaders and gods . The East_Germans pulled this off perfectly for a while , calling themselves Communists and continuing to live like Nazis . Well , it must_not happen again . We shall rub every nose in it . It must never be forgotten . Remember the Maine , the Alamo , Pearl_Harbor . War_crimes trials are of great educational value , because they bring the truth to light and let it be known . They do ? Or are they forums of propaganda -- vindictive , self-serving and self-righteous ? Who is to try whom , anyway ? Do any deserve to escape whipping ? Put Dresden with Hiroshima and add Nagasaki to the pot , and you get deeds about as dastardly as deeds get . Perhaps we can trade our imp of Satan for your Instrument of the_Devil , even-steven ? Who ' s to blame if all_of us are ? The first generation ( who were involved in it and dirtied by it ) desires to forget . Destroy the camps , clean_up the countryside , rebuild the cities , fail to mention this or that when telling its story , if its story has to be told at all . The second generation , however , wants to remember . The children do not wish to be soiled by the sins of their -- for the most part -- fathers . Perhaps a camp can become a museum ; perhaps a ruined church can serve as its own memorial stone ; perhaps classes in former crimes can be held , movies shown , days of devotion set_aside . During one of those moments of memory , however , consider why Hegel invented the dialectic . After &quot; forget ! &quot; after &quot; remember ! &quot; comes &quot; revise ! &quot; A new lawn would look nice around the crematorium . Not everyone was evil , either : How about the heroic resistance ? There have been holocausts before . Remember what the Romans did to Carthage ? We need to recruit better Buchenwald girl guides . After all , Buchenwald is an East_German shrine where many_a Communist martyr died . It is also a camp the Soviets kept_open until 1950 in_order to punish a fresh set of enemies . We deny , for the time being , that the Imperial Japanese Army forced Korean women into prostitution . We also deny the existence of Chinese slave labor in Japan , and if there were such camps they were necessary , and if the Chinese were badly treated , it was because they tried to run_away . These &quot; truths , &quot; which the Left has so heedlessly embraced , disgrace the memory of our glorious soldiers and sailors , especially the Kamikaze pilots , whose sacrifices should never be vilified , even if they were in vain , and even if there is no special realm where they now recline in comfort . You think we were bad , what about you guys ? Our guide Buruma is not without his opinions , but what makes him exemplary in this regard is his ability to see the strengths as well as the weaknesses in varying points_of_view . Nor does he wag his finger and say &quot; shame &quot; all_the time . He is mapping our maneuvers , noting the secret reasons for our public principles , understanding the hazards of honesty as well as its urgency . To escape the blame , the pain , the pursuit of Furies , the mind will make excuses , contrive a rescuing metaphysic , rewrite history as though it were a play being tested out of town , and place on its face a melancholy look , or one of ignorant innocence , whatever will seem to work . Perhaps it will do to appear serenely indifferent , or to assume a studious and calm concern as though examining sickly plants . Failing that , murder more or go mad . You accuse me of leaving the toilet_seat up ? Well , you never turn_off a light . You Yanks want to bring_up a_few rapes by aggrieved and frightened Japanese soldiers when your country cindered an entire city with one bomb . If most of us are eager to evade blame , why are a_few so willing to accept it ? Mea culpa is not the name of a red convertible . But suppose I wish to call myself a German because I think in that way I can bring Bach and Goethe , Durer and Brahms , nearer to my soul . Does Himmler move_in too , with all his friends ? One tongue tastes sour and sweet with equal ease : The language of Heine and Hitler was the same , if not their style of speech . If I wish to claim the glories of my culture and argue that they live_on to some degree in me , how much of the other , the it , must I admit I also am ? The desire on the part of many liberal young Germans to face the truth of their history , to resolve that it , in any form or version , shall not happen again ( fine as these sentiments do indeed seem ) , nevertheless suggests that tribalism still holds them in thrall , and that nationalism still pulls_at their sleeve . Similarly , if one treats the Holocaust as a part of the course of history , then it loses its almost holy status ; it will have causes and explanations , and these can bear the blame and become its justification . On the other hand , if the Holocaust is regarded_as unique , inexplicable , then nothing prepared its coming ; no one can assure us it will not occur again ; it is like a counter-miracle ; and who can be blamed for being caught_up in such an unnatural catastrophe and swept_away ? Ian Buruma ' s book is a catalogue of such quandaries . Offering no solutions , making no predictions , it simply gives us a picture of the moral climate . While Buruma ' s focus is war_crimes in Japan and Germany , moral climates travel the globe . There are brief periods of arrogant heyday followed by oppressive humidity , disillusion , shame and gloom . He concludes on a cautiously hopeful note , which I wish I could qualmlessly enjoy . I firmly believe that an ideal life would be one lived without illusions , but disillusionment also grows old . We tire of being wise and of constantly creeping to conclusions . We weary of being sane and seeing life as a long slow slide of sorrow . So former lies are likely to be welcome once again , in their fashionable and glossy get-ups . Goat glands couldn ' t make us feel better than injections of fresh falsehood . Give us a moment to throw a little ritual dust in our eyes ; then we ' ll sally_forth to live a little , mouth slogans , raise Cain , sin some and get_in trouble .</TEXT>
