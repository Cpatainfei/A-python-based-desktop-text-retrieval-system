   <HEADLINE> A DECISION THAT TURNED SOME HEADS ; BARRY FLETCHER USED A BLACK MODEL TO WIN THE U.S. HAIRSTYLING TITLE , SO WHY NOT FOR THE INTERNATIONALS ? TEAM OFFICIALS SAY IT WAS A MATTER OF HAIR TEXTURE -- NOT RACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Having a black_woman as a model in the world ' s most prestigious hairdressing competition is a sure-fire way for a stylist to lose . that ' s what the coaches of the U.S. hairdressing team told American national champion Barry Fletcher when they barred him from working with an African American model at &quot; Hair Olympics ' 94 , &quot; the biennial world competition that concluded here this week . It ' s not a race issue , they said . It ' s a hair texture issue . The fact that Fletcher , a soft-spoken stylist and salon owner from Maryland , had won the U.S. nationals in January with a black model didn ' t matter . This was international competition , the coaches said , and the European judges would be expecting a certain look -- a look that Fletcher ' s favored models did not possess . Fletcher , who is black , competed in the three-event Ladies Hairdressing Championships with a white model assigned to him by U.S. team coach Randy Rick . Despite his best efforts , Fletcher did not come_close to a first-place finish . The U.S. team of six hairdressers placed 22nd out of 34 competing countries in the ladies hairdressing events , with Japan , Germany and Russia taking the top three medals . The Americans placed fifth in the men ' s hairdressing events , with Great Britain , Germany and Italy taking the top prizes . Medals are not awarded to individuals . These championships take_place under the auspices of the trade organization Confederation Internationale de la Coiffure in Paris and hairdressing trade groups in the cities where the competitions take_place . The next World Congress international contest will be in Washington , D.C. in 1996 . Coming_off the competition floor at Wembley Exhibition Complex after the final event , the &quot; progressive hairstyle &quot; competition , Fletcher was frustrated . &quot; I felt_like I was robbed of my strength , &quot; he said . &quot; Obviously , I should have had a model I ' m more familiar_with . You should have a model with a texture of hair you ' re familiar with. &quot; At his salon in Capitol Heights , Md. , Fletcher ' s clientele is about 85 % black . Among those entrusting their looks_to him are celebrities ranging from Tina Turner and Iman to Maya Angelou and U.S. Sen . Carol Moseley-Braun . Fletcher said Rick told him that the kinds of styles he had_in_mind for the U.S. team would not work_on a black_woman ' s hair , but the hairstylist insists that there would have been no problem had he been allowed to work with Jackie Smith , the model with whom he had won the U.S. championship . &quot; If she was good_enough to qualify , then she should have been good_enough to represent the country , &quot; he said . &quot; I think the judges would look_at the quality of the work , the execution , the color , the total feel and the harmony of the style and fashion. &quot; * Smith , who did not go_to London , called it ridiculous that African American models are barred from competing . &quot; When is it going_to change ? &quot; asked the model and veterinarian from Maryland . &quot; When do you say this is representative of American hair ? When do you make a stand and say it can look stylish , it can look vogue , it can be competitive ? &quot; I don ' t see it changing if we have the same people involved , &quot; she said . Fletcher argued his case with Rick to no avail . He appealed_to team manager Robert Niebuhr and recalled the manager ' s response . &quot; Bob said , ' What if I let you use this black model ? You go_over there , you ' re going to lose . Now who ' s going_to explain that to Matrix ( the hair products company sponsoring the U.S. team ) ? ' &quot; ( Matrix said it had no involvement in the team selection process and does not believe_in discrimination. ) Rick , who as team coach had final say over which models and styles the American competitors employ , said that before the competition , he went_on a scouting expedition across Europe to discover which hairstyles were winning competitions . And what he noticed among the winners was the hair texture of whites . &quot; What am I going_to do ? &quot; he said . &quot; Go_in there and say , ' Well , I ' m going_to be the maverick of the world and go different ? ' And then what ? &quot; A sampling of hair officials from other countries all agreed with Rick . Richard St . Laurent , coach of the Canadian team , said there are fabulous black models , but he understood the concerns of the U.S. coach . &quot; Europe is different , &quot; he said . Asked if Fletcher could have won with his original model , British team manager Trevor Mitchell said : &quot; They couldn ' t win -- it ' s impossible . They would n ' t stand a chance. &quot; Like others questioned , he claimed this was not a racial issue . &quot; If ( black_women ) had straight hair , then you could have a black model . It ' s lovely to get someone with dark features on the floor. &quot; Rae Stuart , president of the National Hairdresser Foundation in Great Britain , said : &quot; There are no specific guidelines . But common_sense in an international hairdressing competition would suggest that you would stand a better chance with an Occidental model or perhaps a Puerto Rican or Spanish-type model rather than a Negro. &quot; * Fletcher figured he spent $ 15 # 000 for his shot at being named the best in the world . He was not told until about a month before the Hair Olympics that he could not use an African American model . &quot; If you can ' t use a black model , they should put that in writing when you fill_out the application , &quot; he said . &quot; When we apply to compete , it costs us money . If I ' d have known about it , maybe I would have changed my mind. &quot; Fletcher disputes the assumption that there is only one type of hair suitable for international competition , hair that is only partially representative of the world as it is . &quot; If we ' re really going_to stand_up to the true meaning of our creed as Americans , &quot; he said , &quot; then we have to start being more open and adapting to what ' s actually happening in the United States . I don ' t want to have to submit to a particular level of artistry . &quot; It ' s like if you take Michelangelo , you take his paints away and his brushes , and you say to him , ' Now I want you to paint this chapel and I want you to use , you know , Matrix products.
