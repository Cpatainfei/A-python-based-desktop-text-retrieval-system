   <TEXT> What has become of Austria , Switzerland and France -- all Alpine countries -- in Alpine skiing ? At the Olympic halfway point , skiers from those countries have no medals . In medals , the United States leads the big three , four to none . &quot; The expectations are difficult ( for the Alpine countries ) , &quot; said Patrick Lang , a free-lance journalist who serves as a translator for the World Cup circuit and the Olympic Games . &quot; For America , ski racing is not ranked in the top 20 sports in the U.S. Skiing only exists for the Olympics . I think the American spirit is , ' Let ' s go_for the win , there ' s nothing to lose . Let ' s have fun. ' &quot; To many Europeans , ski racing is a year-round passion , and the Olympics are merely a stop on the tour . &quot; It ' s not the World Cup , it ' s a game where anything can happen , and it ' s good , it ' s fun , but you have to put everything into perspective , &quot; Lang said . &quot; It ' s an Olympics . It doesn ' t mean anything before and it doesn ' t mean anything after. &quot; Especially if you don ' t win anything .</TEXT>
