   <HEADLINE> LEADERS OF ISRAEL , JORDAN AGREE TO HISTORIC MEETING ; MIDEAST : PRIME_MINISTER RABIN AND KING HUSSEIN WILL CONFER IN FIRST OFFICIAL TALKS , CLINTON ANNOUNCES . NO PEACE_TREATY IS EXPECTED FROM THE EVENT IN WASHINGTON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton announced Friday that Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and King Hussein of Jordan will confer at the White_House this month in the first acknowledged face-to-face meeting between leaders of countries joined by geography but divided by half a century of animosity . &quot; The Middle_East is entering a new era , &quot; Clinton said . The July 25 meeting -- announced simultaneously in Washington , Jerusalem and Amman -- &quot; reflects the courageous leadership and the bold vision which both King Hussein and Prime_Minister Rabin have displayed as they work together to create a new future for their people and for all_the region , &quot; the President said . Underlining the occasion ' s significance , Rabin and Hussein , accompanied by Clinton , will address a joint session of Congress . The Israeli and Jordanian leaders will be guests at a White_House state dinner , only the second such event since Clinton took_office 18 months ago . The Middle_East breakthrough comes at a welcome time for Clinton , giving him a genuine foreign_policy success to counterbalance criticism of the Administration for allegedly uneven handling of crises in Haiti and Bosnia-Herzegovina . An Administration official said the Rabin-Hussein meeting is comparable_to President Anwar Sadat ' s visit to Jerusalem in 1977 that cleared the way for the Israel-Egypt peace_treaty , the first -- and , as yet , only -- pact between Israel and any Arab government . Still , this meeting will not produce the emotional wallop of Sadat ' s unprecedented initiative , officials said , conceding that it will not lead directly to a peace_treaty . But it demonstrates , as one U.S. official put it , that Israel is becoming accepted by its Arab neighbors &quot; as a normal part of the landscape. &quot; Following by less than a year the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization , the Hussein-Rabin meeting is added evidence that the Arab world has given_up on its once-singular objective of expelling the Jewish state from the region . Hussein has met secretly with Israeli prime_ministers and other top officials for more_than 20 years . But this is the first time either side has publicly acknowledged the contact . &quot; There is great significance to the fact that it is being done openly , in the light of day , &quot; Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told Israeli television . &quot; This puts an end to the secrecy . &quot; This is an opportunity for which we have yearned for a long_time , &quot; Peres said . &quot; This is not only an encounter at the top but a very fundamental change on the ground . This is the beginning of a new era in the relationship between us and Jordan and in the whole Middle East. &quot; Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher conceded that the Hussein-Rabin talks &quot; will not result in the signing of a peace treaty. &quot; Instead , he said , the talks are part of a process intended to produce Israel-Jordan cooperation on economic projects such_as tourism and exploitation of the mineral-rich Dead_Sea and the agricultural potential of the Jordan_River valley , which straddles the border . A U.S. official said Israel and Jordan are reversing the usual order of diplomacy between former enemies . Instead of starting with a peace_treaty , Jerusalem and Amman are negotiating details of normal , friendly relations while maintaining a technical state_of_war . Mid-level economic talks begin Monday in a tent pitched on the border . Christopher meets Wednesday at a resort_hotel on the Jordanian side of the Dead_Sea with Peres and Prime_Minister Abdul Salam Majali , who doubles as Jordan ' s foreign_minister , to prepare the way for the Washington meeting . The sudden progress in Jordan-Israel negotiations seems to push Syria and its hard-line president , Hafez Assad , to the margins of the Middle_East peace process . Israel and Syria have deadlocked over the key details of a peace_treaty after agreeing in principle more_than a year ago to make_peace based on Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights . Regional experts said Assad is furious at Hussein for forging ahead and at the United States for encouraging the Israel-Jordan rapprochement . Clinton telephoned Assad on Friday morning to inform him of the Rabin-Hussein talks and to try to soothe his feelings . But regional specialists expect Assad to retaliate in some way . In previous years when Jordan broke_with Syria , Jordanian diplomats have been assassinated , presumably by Syrian intelligence operatives . * U.S. officials said they believe that Hussein will stop short of signing a formal peace_treaty to minimize Assad ' s anger . But they said that Hussein clearly has decided to pursue what he considers to be Jordan ' s national interest without waiting for Syria to come_along . Christopher will try to push the Syria-Israel negotiations off dead center when he begins his trip to the region Sunday night . &quot; It ' s essential that ( Israel and Syria ) move forward in these discussions , and I am prepared to engage intensively with them , &quot; Christopher said . Both Jordan and Syria regard peace with Israel as a back-door way of improving their relations with Washington . Both hope to get economic assistance from the United States as a reward for making_peace with Israel . Christopher said Hussein had indicated he was ready to meet Rabin in a visit to Washington last month . At the same time , the Hashemite monarch said Jordan needs debt relief and wants U.S. weapons to modernize its military arsenal . &quot; We ' re working with them and intend to work with them on both of those problems , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; The United States has always been prepared to work with those in the Middle_East who are committed to peace and help achieve a peace settlement. &quot; Jordan owes about $ 700 million to the United States , an amount that the kingdom ' s troubled economy is unable to repay . Hussein ' s agreement to meet Rabin is a clear victory for the Israeli prime_minister , who wants his government to deal with Arab states one at a time instead of trying to negotiate a comprehensive peace with all_of Israel ' s neighbors . That has been Israel ' s strategy ever since the Camp David conference that paved the way for the Egypt-Israel treaty in 1979 . But Rabin now seems to be the first Israeli leader since 1979 to break Arab solidarity . The Israel-Jordan relationship has always been a curious one because the countries share so_much geography and history . Both states were carved out of the territory of the_British Palestine mandate , and Israel ' s border with Jordan is by far its longest . Both countries have long recognized the value of joint economic development , although their frosty political relationship has made that impossible . Jordan and Israel have a territorial dispute in the Jordan_River valley , but it is less of an obstacle to peace than the Israel-Syria dispute over the Golan Heights . Before the 1967 Mideast War , Jordan controlled the West_Bank and the eastern part of Jerusalem , and for years the Hashemite kingdom demanded return of those territories . But in 1988 , Hussein ceded Jordan ' s claim to the PLO . Times staff writer Mary Curtius in Jerusalem contributed to this report .</TEXT>
