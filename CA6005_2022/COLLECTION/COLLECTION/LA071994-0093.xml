   <HEADLINE> A TIME FOR DYING ? ; RATHER THAN FACE A HORRIBLE , LINGERING DEATH , SOME AIDS PATIENTS SAY THEY PLAN TO END THEIR LIVES . FOR THEM , IT ' S A WAY OF KEEPING CONTROL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During the day , Joe Miller stays busy helping AIDS patients . At night , the catheter delivering a medley of medications to his emaciated body reminds him that he , too , shares their fate . But Miller , who has been in and out of the hospital nine times in as_many years , doesn ' t plan to let the disease take him all_the way down to dementia or some_other horrible finale as it has done to so many of his friends . With poison he has obtained , Miller will be able to kill himself before AIDS does . &quot; I ' m not a victim , &quot; he says . &quot; Victims have no control . I ' m going_to be in control until the point of dying. &quot; By some estimates , more_than half of the 360 # 000 AIDS patients currently diagnosed in the United States have made preparations to end their lives when -- and if -- they decide the time is right . Coast to coast , they hoard powerful medications -- a ritual called &quot; stockpiling &quot; -- or plan other methods , such_as the plastic-bag suffocation described in the best-selling suicide primer &quot; Final Exit. &quot; Despite public uneasiness with euthanasia and in defiance of laws against assisting with suicide , many recruit relatives or friends to help , should they become too incapacitated . Others ask their medical_care givers to assist . And while most will never carry_out their plans , at least 1 # 000 have done so , says Dr. Peter Marzuk , a Cornell University psychiatrist who has studied suicide rates in AIDS patients . &quot; It goes_on a lot more now because they ' re just not dying as quickly as they used to , &quot; says psychoanalyst Mark Blechner , founder of the HIV Clinical Service at the William Alanson White Institute in Manhattan . &quot; Now that we ' re treating the diseases that used to kill them early , they ' re getting_to a state of such deterioration , &quot; Blechner says . &quot; They ' re really very ill and really , really suffering. &quot; &quot; People live longer and more uncomfortably because medical_science has intervened in every illness , &quot; says Los Angeles resident Gary Costa , 32 , who was diagnosed HIV positive in 1985 but still is healthy . &quot; Nature didn ' t intend us to live so long. &quot; As program director of Being Alive : People With AIDS Coalition , Costa knows hundreds of HIV-positive people and AIDS patients in Los Angeles . He says most have stockpiled drugs and made pacts with others to help if necessary . &quot; I ' ve stocked enough morphine to wipe_out a family of 10 , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s my emergency stash in case I have to go out. &quot; * Costa and others find comfort in making preparations to keep their options open . But that doesn ' t make_it easy for anyone when the time comes . He ' ll never forget an October morning in 1985 , the day he refused to help his partner die . &quot; He couldn ' t breathe , he was blind and his whole quality_of_life was gone , &quot; Costa recalls . &quot; We ' d had a pact that I ' d give him a lethal injection but I freaked . I just couldn ' t do it. &quot; The man , angry , sent Costa to the store to buy ice_cream . Then he dialed 911 and shot himself fatally in the head . &quot; I heard the sirens and saw the ambulance as I was coming_home , &quot; Costa says . &quot; And I knew . He ' d called 911 so I would n ' t have to be the one to find him. &quot; He has come_to terms with that event , he says , and stresses that most of the 67 people he knows who have died ultimately did not take their own lives . &quot; With the availability of morphine at_home and good home care , they ' ve opted to ease out naturally , &quot; he says . Still , he fears what could lie ahead for himself . that ' s why he has arranged with a friend who he knows will be able to carry_out his wishes should he choose to die . &quot; I ' m asymptomatic now and don ' t know what the future holds for me , &quot; he says . &quot; But I don ' t take being_sick very well and I just want to know it ' d be over quick . As I deal with it all , I can get comfortable knowing I won ' t have to suffer. &quot; He believes it ' s the fact that he has made provisions for his death that keeps him healthy . &quot; I can go_on with my life now , &quot; he says . Even in the closest relationships , views of the suicide option are split . Costa ' s partner is Kyle Burton , 36 , a Los Angeles special-event planner . Unlike Costa , he has no plans to try to control the timing of his death . &quot; I ' m definitely going_to kick until the end , &quot; he says . Burton , whose condition was diagnosed in France seven years ago , says once he got past the &quot; mental hell of the first two years , &quot; he started to feel better . He ' s now almost blind in one eye , suffers from Kaposi ' s sarcoma ( cancerous skin lesions ) and has been hospitalized with a collapsed lung , but he still feels excellent , he reports . &quot; I want to live , &quot; he says . &quot; I ' m not going_to be the first one to jump in and kill myself . I might break_down , but doctors can usually fix it. &quot; Still , he stresses , he &quot; 100 % supports &quot; anyone who feels differently . &quot; The only difference between them and me is I have no set way_out , &quot; he says . &quot; But I know my mother will know when it ' s time to turn_off the ( life support ) machine if it gets really bad . She knows I don ' t want to become a dribbling responsibility with no quality of life. &quot; * No one knows for_sure how many AIDS patients die by their own hands , with or without help , but several studies indicate that people with the disease are at high risk for suicide , says Marzuk , an assistant_professor of psychiatry at Cornell University Medical College in New York City . &quot; It ' s higher than with cancer but on a par with elevated rates found in patients_of Huntington ' s disease and major mental_illnesses such_as schizophrenia and depression , &quot; he says . Marzuk , who in 1988 published a study showing that male AIDS patients are 36 times more likely to commit suicide than similarly aged men without AIDS , says most subsequent studies put the rate anywhere from 10 to 20 times that of the general population . &quot; All these studies underestimate the true numbers , &quot; he says . &quot; Many deaths are not suspected or reported as suicides . It ' s just impossible to say how many . Given the interaction of biological , social and psychological factors , it ' s actually surprising more people don ' t kill themselves. &quot; But even though he understands the motivation , Marzuk is opposed to suicide . &quot; I think encouraging it is opening a Pandora ' s Box , &quot; he says . &quot; Why limit it to the physical terminal illnesses ? What about terminal homelessness , longstanding emotional problems ? It could go beyond any normal limit. &quot; &quot; I don ' t call this suicide , &quot; says Judith Rabkin , a psychologist at Columbia University who for six years has studied HIV and depression . &quot; There ' s a distinction between suicide where someone jumps_out the window after hearing the news or -- when death is impending -- choosing to control the time of death . It ' s a very different event. &quot; She questions judgments people make about how much other people should suffer . &quot; In our culture it ' s considered brave to hang_in until death . But when you talk to AIDS patients about others who ' ve killed themselves , they say ' I wish I had their courage. ' Maybe it ' s equally brave to not accept ( this suffering. ) &quot; Jack Lewis , a Lutheran pastor with the AIDS Project Los Angeles ' spiritual advisory committee , recalls one extremely ill client who , with his family ' s support , arranged for a nurse friend to give him an overdose of morphine . &quot; It was a very difficult time because he was very afraid , &quot; Lewis says . The patient , 29 , no longer able to swallow or talk , communicated by pointing to alphabet letters pasted on cardboard . &quot; He just wanted reassurance from me that it would n ' t be bad ( to end his life ) , that he would n ' t be judged . &quot; I said , frankly , ' Letting you move_into the next plane is better than what you ' re experiencing now. ' It was a very simple statement , but it calmed him down and brought him peace. &quot; * Inside a former tenement building , Joe Miller , 50 , sits on the single_bed in his small and immaculate apartment . Classical music plays softly as he talks_about the past decade of his life . It was in 1985 , while teaching English in South_Korea , that his body suddenly turned black and blue . After seeing a doctor who prescribed penicillin and deer antler powders , he went_to the International Hospital in Seoul , where a Danish doctor told him : &quot; You have AIDS. &quot; &quot; I didn ' t get depressed , I got panicky , &quot; he says , lighting a cigarette . &quot; Not that I was going_to die , but that I was going_to be very ill. &quot; He returned to the United States , had his spleen removed , took a job as an AIDS educator at Beth Israel Hospital in New York and was &quot; pretty much OK &quot; for three years , he says . Then , while AIDS fund-raising in Los Angeles , he developed pneumocystis_carinii_pneumonia , a viral disease common to AIDS . Six weeks after that hospitalization , he contracted the same pneumonia again . &quot; That was it , &quot; he says . &quot; I couldn ' t work anymore at a regular paying job. &quot; As he goes_down the list of what happened after that -- yet another bout with the pneumonia , a diabetic coma , three infections from the catheter , the loss of 50 friends , the wasting syndrome that so far has cost him 30 pounds , bacterial infection that rages in his intestines , eight different medications he currently takes , the time his lymph_nodes &quot; exploded &quot; -- he exhibits not a shred of self-pity . &quot; We all have so many things , &quot; he says . &quot; You just deal with them as they come up. &quot; Today it is Miller ' s work that gives him the most satisfaction . For the past four years , he has been a volunteer at the People With AIDS Coalition hot_line . He also runs an AIDS task_force at the Unitarian_Church of All Souls , which coordinates several support groups and a meal program . He won ' t say where he got the poison with which he may -- with the help of a trusted friend if necessary -- inject himself someday , but he says he spent months thinking and talking to counselors , loved ones and friends about how to control the timing of his death . The problem , Miller says , is that there are no easy and accessible ways to end one ' s life . &quot; I ' m a very lucky person , &quot; he says , knocking_on his wooden table three times to keep bad_luck away . &quot; I ' ve had incredible , competent and caring support . I count myself blessed on that level . But when I ' m no longer capable of sustaining meaningful life , I ' ll end it. &quot;</TEXT>
