   <HEADLINE> CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS : NO-VENT CONDENSING DRYERS SAVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : I am considering buying a new no-vent electric condensing clothes_dryers so it does not have to be_on an outside wall . Are condensing dryers efficient and which new dryer features are_best ? ANSWER : No-vent condensing clothes_dryers have been popular in Europe for many years . By not having to vent it outdoors , you can locate the dryer in any convenient closet , bedroom , utility room , etc . Condensing dryers use a tiny blower to circulate room air across a heat_exchanger inside the dryer . As the room air draws heat from the hot damp dryer air , moisture condenses out and drips into a removable container . The dry air then circulates across the heating element and through the clothes drawing_out more moisture . This process continues until the clothes are dry . These dryers are the same size and look_like an ordinary dryer . Although the small extra motors in a condensing dryer use slightly more electricity than in a vented dryer , no heated or cooled indoor air is exhausted outdoors . This can cut your electric_bills and eliminate chilly drafts . The drying chamber is sealed so no moisture escapes into your home . This is better than just pulling the duct loose and venting your existing dryer indoors . Excessive humidity can exacerbate allergies and window sweating . Condensing dryers , because they are often located in a living area , are designed to be very quiet . This requires very high_quality motors , bearings , vibration isolation materials and balanced construction . Reversing , two-direction drum rotation is used on several condensing and vented models . This fluffs your clothes , reduces wrinkling , and reduces drying times by 35 % . By keeping the clothes fluffed and open , different weight materials can be effectively dried together in one load . The clothes first spin in the forward direction for four minutes with a high air flow_rate . The drum reverses for 25 seconds with a lower air flow_rate . This allows the dryer air to draw more moisture out of the clothes . A true electronic moisture sensor saves energy and reduces shrinkage and ironing time . By touching and &quot; feeling &quot; the dampness of the clothes , the sensor turns the dryer off at the precise time . This is more effective than &quot; automatic sensors &quot; that just measure the air temperature to estimate dryness . Write for Utility Bills Update No . 789 showing a buyer ' s guide of 13 manufacturers of high efficiency condensing and vented dryers listing moisture sensor types , drum rotation directions , prices , pre-programmed cycles , tips and features .
