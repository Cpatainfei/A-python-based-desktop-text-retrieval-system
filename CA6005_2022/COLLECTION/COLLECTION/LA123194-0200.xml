   <HEADLINE> 2 KILLED , 5 WOUNDED IN SHOOTINGS AT 2 ABORTION CLINICS ; VIOLENCE : GUNMAN DRESSED IN BLACK OPENS_FIRE IN FACILITIES NEAR BOSTON . EXTENSIVE MANHUNT IS LAUNCHED . ALL THE VICTIMS WERE EMPLOYEES OR VOLUNTEERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two women were killed and five other people were wounded in nearly identical shooting attacks at two abortion clinics here Friday morning by a man clad entirely in black and wielding a . 22-caliber hunting rifle . The FBI immediately entered the case , joining local law authorities in a block-by-block search for the mysterious gunman , who may have been wounded in an exchange of gunfire with a security_guard at one of the clinics . The guard was one of the injured . Witnesses at both scenes gave similar descriptions of the gunman , and police issued a description of a single suspect -- a white male of medium height with curly , dark hair . But they stopped short of saying the same man was responsible_for both attacks . State officials called it among the most extensive manhunts in Massachusetts history . The search centered_on Hampton , N.H. , a coastal community just across the Massachusetts border , where investigators sought to question a 23-year-old suspect . A law_enforcement source in Boston told the Associated Press that the suspect ' s name is John Salvi , whose last known address was Hampton . Authorities traced the ammunition used in the shooting to an area gun store after they recovered the dark-colored duffel_bag the gunman left_behind when he fled the second clinic . Inside the bag was a receipt for a pistol as well as for the rifle used in the killings . Late Friday , detectives , state police and federal_agents -- some wearing flak jackets -- searched a home_in Ipswich , Mass. , a summer resort town north of Boston and not far from Hampton . Investigators were tight-lipped after leaving the house -- empty-handed . Shannon Lowney of Arlington , Mass. , a 25-year-old receptionist at the Planned Parenthood Clinic of Greater Boston , died at the scene , the victim of multiple gunshot wounds . Lowney grew_up in Fairfield , Conn. , and graduated magna cum laude from Boston College in 1991 , her brother Liam Lowney , 22 , told the AP . &quot; She died doing what she believed_in , &quot; Liam Lowney said . &quot; She was committed to -- and worked to provide -- women the right to choose. &quot; Susan Newsom , vice_president of Planned Parenthood of Massachusetts , described Lowney as &quot; a wonderful young_woman , bright , personable and committed and what every person would want in a daughter. &quot; At the Preterm Health Services , farther up Beacon Street , Leanne Nichols of Salem , N.H. , was sprayed with bullets . The 38-year-old receptionist died soon after at Boston ' s Beth Israel Hospital . Five other victims -- two women and three men , including the security_guard -- were in fair to critical condition late Friday at area hospitals . All of the victims were either employees or volunteers at the clinics . Still terrified as she stood outside the Preterm clinic , Deborah Gaines said she was among half_a_dozen women who were standing in the clinic ' s hallway when the gunman began shooting . &quot; He came_in and started shooting anything , anyone he saw , &quot; Gaines said . &quot; We were just running , running as fast as we could. &quot; The shootings here brought_to five the number of people killed in an escalation in violence at abortion clinics over the past two years . In Florida , two physicians and an abortion clinic escort were killed . As the manhunt began , investigators said a key piece of evidence was a duffel_bag found at the second clinic that was apparently used by the gunman to carry the rifle . The bag contained multiple rounds of ammunition , police said . * Detectives refused to reveal other materials found in the bag . But there were indications that its contents were helping to propel the investigation . &quot; There ' s a lot of work going_on in the streets , &quot; one investigator said . Natalya Kabanovsky , an electrolysis technician in Preterm ' s building , said a man fitting the description of the gunman had protested abortions over the past several months . &quot; He was anxious . He wanted to tell everybody what happens here , &quot; she said . Salvi , the suspect reportedly sought by authorities , was described in an AP report by Richard Griffin , his boss at a beauty_salon , as &quot; a very odd character &quot; who proclaimed his opposition to abortion with a photo of a fetus on the back of his pickup_truck . Authorities were seeking an amateur videotape reportedly made by one of the regular protesters at the Planned Parenthood Clinic . A command_post was set_up at police_headquarters here , where federal_agents were seeking to trace purchase records for the weapon . Nicki Gamble , president of Planned Parenthood in Massachusetts , said the clinic -- which was participating in a nationwide trial of the_French abortion_pill RU 486 -- had been the target of repeated threats in recent months . Some , she said , had been &quot; out of the ordinary. &quot; Clinic officials were so alarmed that earlier this month they brought their concerns over the threats and continuing protests to a meeting with U.S. Justice_Department officials in Boston . Friday began with the usual gathering of protesters outside the center , where about 3 # 000 abortions are performed annually . Gamble described the facility ' s security as good , but added , &quot; Clearly , it wasn ' t good_enough today. &quot; Outrage over the shootings ricocheted across the nation . At the White_House , President Clinton labeled the episode &quot; domestic terrorism &quot; and deplored the clinic murders as &quot; meaningless violence. &quot; Pledging full support from the FBI , Atty . Gen . Janet Reno condemned the &quot; senseless , horrible tragedy &quot; of Friday ' s shootings . In an emotional statement issued late Friday , U.S. Atty . Donald Stern termed the events here Friday &quot; a brutal , cowardly act of murder. &quot; Grim-faced and promising stepped-up protection for clinics that request it , Massachusetts Gov . William F . Weld stood outside the Preterm clinic and declared : &quot; This man is nothing more_than a terrorist . No one is going_to settle moral arguments by violence in Massachusetts. &quot; Pamela Maraldo , president of Planned Parenthood International in New York , demanded an immediate meeting with President Clinton to discuss clinic violence . Kim Gandy , vice_president of the National Organization for Women , branded Friday ' s killings as proof of &quot; a national conspiracy to commit domestic terrorism. &quot; Reaction came equally swiftly from those opposed to abortion . A statement from the National Right_to_Life Committee in Washington condemned Friday ' s shootings &quot; in the strongest possible terms. &quot; It added , &quot; We have always , and continue to , oppose any use of violence to fight the violence of abortion. &quot; Witnesses said Friday that the gunman entered the three-story , red-brick building housing the Planned Parenthood Clinic just after 10 a.m. EST . Workers at Planned Parenthood said the clinic ' s door is locked and operated_on a buzzer system . It was unclear how the gunman got_in . He asked if he was in the right place , then began shooting , apparently hitting Lowney first . Three others were shot in the outburst . Edith Saltzman , a Planned Parenthood vice_president , was talking to her Brookline colleagues by phone when the attack began . &quot; I heard three cracks , a scream . ( Someone ) yelled , ' Something happened ! ' &quot; Saltzman said . At the Preterm clinic , witnesses said the perpetrator followed the same routine . Entering the nondescript medical_building where the clinic is situated , he again confirmed that he had reached his destination . Dropping his duffel_bag , he removed the weapon and began firing . &quot; Bang ! Bang ! He did_it just like that , &quot; said a witness , who identified himself only as Harold . This time a security_guard quickly responded . The guard , 45-year-old Richard J . Serron , and the gunman exchanged fire . It was not known if the assailant , who fled from the clinic on foot , firing his weapon , was hit . Serron was in fair condition late Friday . Leanne Nichols , the receptionist , was shot at least five times , and died later of her wounds . Two others , Serron and a woman , underwent surgery for chest and abdominal wounds . Kelly Cunningham , who accompanied a friend who was to undergo an abortion that morning at the Planned Parenthood clinic , said she elbowed past &quot; three older_men who were praying and chanting &quot; in an apparent attempt to dissuade her friend from going_through with the procedure . The friend , whom she declined to name , later called Cunningham to say she was safe . &quot; I should never have left her , &quot; Cunningham sobbed . &quot; Why do they do this ? Why do they let this happen ? &quot; Brookline , a tony suburb just outside Boston and the birthplace of former President John F . Kennedy , has long been a target of anti-abortion protests because it is home to three clinics , which are all clustered on one main avenue . For years , a local anti-abortion group called the Pro-Life Action Network , a local affiliate of Operation Rescue , has focused its protests on the Brookline clinics , conducting clinic blockades and other demonstrations and acts of civil_disobedience . Buses frequently deposit protesters , said several people who act_as clinic escorts . In past years the Brookline clinics have been the scene of highly orchestrated disruptions , including several incidents in which abortion opponents chained themselves to the clinics , beseeching those seeking abortions to reconsider their decisions . Bill Cotter , head of the local group , spent 19 months in jail for violating state court injunctions against blocking access to the clinics . The protests at the Brookline clinics were the subject of a 1991 book &quot; Caught in the Crossfire &quot; by University of New Hampshire journalism teacher Sue Hertz . She said in an interview Friday that there had been numerous threats of violence against the clinics , including bomb and death threats . But she said that , apart from pushing and shoving at clinic blockades , there had not been serious violence before . In an interview Friday , Cotter condemned the violence and denied any involvement in the shootings by anyone affiliated with his organization . Cotter said that he had been asked by police to come_in_for questioning Friday , but stressed that he was not a suspect . He said police were searching for leads , and were trying to learn if any of the local protesters who are regularly stationed outside the clinics , sometimes carrying video cameras , had seen anything . * The attacks Friday fall_under the new federal law protecting abortion clinics and patients from violence and harassment . Women ' s groups and abortion rights supporters called_on the government to enforce the law . &quot; We cannot wait for the next mass_murder . To date , there has been no arrest under the new federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act for death threats , although almost 25 % of clinics are experiencing such threats , &quot; said Eleanor Smeal , president of the Feminist Majority Foundation . The National Abortion Federation and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , supported by an anonymous donor , offered a $ 100 # 000 reward for information leading to the conviction of anyone involved in the slayings . In March , 1993 , a doctor was shot and killed outside a Pensacola , Fla. , clinic . Michael Griffin is serving a life sentence for that slaying . In July , a doctor and his bodyguard were shot to death outside another Pensacola clinic . The gunman , Paul J . Hill , 40 , has been sentenced to die in the electric_chair . A doctor was shot and wounded last year at a clinic in Wichita , Kan. , and there have been fire-bombings and other vandalism at clinics around the country , including a 1993 blaze in Bakersfield that did $ 1.4 million in damage . The terror in Brookline came as residents were preparing_for a weekend of New Year ' s revelry . With the suspect still at_large , the level of concern was so high that Boston Mayor James Menino urged residents not to let their fears interfere with the festivities of First Night , Boston ' s traditional citywide New Year ' s celebration . Expressing horror at the shootings in his home community , Boston ' s Cardinal Bernard Law asked that clinic protests be suspended . But the pair of anti-abortion protesters who kept watch on Beacon Street , outside the Planned Parenthood clinic , seemed unlikely to leave their posts . The two women stood silently , refusing to speak_to anyone . A neighborhood resident said they were fixtures among the abortion opponents who regularly converge outside a group of abortion clinics here . Cunningham , who said she had accompanied several friends to the Planned Parenthood Clinic , said the protesters who arrive by the busload were a constant , disturbing presence . &quot; These moralistic people stand here , harassing people , &quot; she said . &quot; They ' re out here all_the time , praying . Praying for what ? &quot; By nightfall , below-freezing temperatures failed to slow the steady flow of mourners who gathered outside the two clinics . Some left flowers -- grand bouquets , or simple sprays of daisies -- on the steps . Many wept openly , and leaned_on one another for support . Outside the Planned Parenthood clinic , about 300 people attended a candlelight vigil . &quot; It makes no sense for people who are anti-abortion to be murdering , &quot; said lawyer Donna Turley . The Rev . Katherine Hancock Ragsdale , wearing her ecclesiastical collar , sadly surveyed the scene . &quot; We ' re horrified and appalled , &quot; she said , &quot; particularly that so_much of this violence is done_by people who purport to be acting in the name of God. &quot; In a voice choked with tears , a young_woman declined to give her name , saying she was too upset , and too afraid . &quot; This is a terrible tragedy , &quot; she said . &quot; It all just breaks my heart. &quot; Times staff writer James Risen in Washington and researcher D ' Jamila Salem in Los Angeles contributed to this story .
