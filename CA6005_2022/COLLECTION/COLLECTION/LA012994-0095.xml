   <HEADLINE> WHITE_HOUSE TAKES BOW FOR GROWTH TRENDS ; ECONOMY : THE PRESIDENT ' S PROGRAM IS PRAISED FOR RECORD STOCK_MARKET LEVELS AND LOW INFLATION . CRITICS SAY IT ' S THE BUSINESS_CYCLE AT_WORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With good news rolling in on the economic front almost every day , it seems clear that the nation has finally and irretrievably pulled_out of recession . That the recovery is accelerating was underscored by Friday ' s report that the nation ' s gross_domestic_product grew at the fastest pace in six years during the final quarter of 1993 . Estimates of future federal_deficits are declining . The stock_market is setting new records . Perhaps most remarkably , the economy has recovered without reviving inflation and the Federal_Reserve has felt surprisingly little pressure to raise interest_rates . Indeed , Clinton_Administration officials can barely contain their glee as Washington ' s statisticians churn_out glowing new numbers . And in time-honored fashion , the White_House immediately took credit Friday for virtually all_of the positive trends . &quot; There is a clear linkage between the President ' s economic program introduced last year and the economy ' s improved performance , &quot; declared Laura D ' Andrea Tyson , who chairs the President ' s Council of Economic Advisers . Friday ' s report of rapid economic_growth came one day after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issued a new forecast saying that the budget_deficit crisis is effectively over . It predicted that the deficit would fall to $ 166 billion by 1996 , nearly half of what had been forecast earlier . CBO Director Robert D . Reischauer gave most of the credit to Clinton ' s economic plan . One Democratic senator called the report the &quot; best news I ' ve heard since I ' ve been in Congress. &quot; Of course , Republicans and other Clinton critics argue that Clinton ' s policies have had very little to do with the dramatic turnaround in the economic and budgetary outlook . They say that Clinton has been lucky -- not good . &quot; Clinton is taking credit for the business_cycle , &quot; said Martin S . Feldstein , a Harvard economist and former Ronald Reagan_Administration official . &quot; The Clinton budget plan has had almost nothing to do with the recovery , &quot; added Michael J . Boskin , a Stanford_University economist and former chief economist in the George_Bush Administration . &quot; Clinton inherited an economy doing much better than many people realized and certainly better than what he let_on during the campaign. &quot; But such political distinctions have never stopped any President -- including Reagan and Bush -- from taking credit for positive economic trends . &quot; We did not inherit a strong , robust economy &quot; from Bush , countered Tyson . Still , it may be too soon for the Administration to pop the corks on the champagne . Analysts warned that the economy ' s high growth_rate of 5.9 % in late 1993 will not be sustained this year . Even the White_House ' s own forecast , to be released next month , will show that growth will moderate to just under 3 % for 1994 . The unemployment_rate is not likely to continue to decline at the relatively rapid pace of recent months , either . In addition , the surge of good economic news will not necessarily translate into political capital that the White_House can spend on its ambitious domestic agenda for 1994 . Voters , critics noted , may_not agree that Clinton should immediately shift gears from deficit reduction to big new spending plans in such areas as health_care , welfare and job training . In fact , Clinton ' s fiscal_policies may be severely tested this year . Already , many moderates in Congress are pushing for passage this year of more and tougher deficit-reduction measures -- efforts that the White_House will actively oppose . Fearful that further spending reductions would make_it impossible to fund health_care reform or welfare reform , the cornerstones of Clinton ' s 1994 agenda , the Administration will fight hard to stop an expected congressional push for a balanced-budget constitutional amendment this spring . White_House officials said that they hope the sharp reduction in the CBO ' s deficit forecast will slow the momentum of the balanced-budget forces but there is no evidence yet to support that hope . Another potential obstacle to the Administration ' s ability to fund its agenda may come from a bipartisan entitlement commission headed by Sen . Bob Kerrey ( D-Neb. ) and Sen . John C . Danforth ( R-Mo. ) . In May it is expected to call_for tough reforms and spending reductions in fast-growing entitlement programs , such_as Medicare and Medicaid . The commission ' s proposals could lead to a serious conflict between Congress and the Administration over the budgetary impact of Clinton ' s health plan . At the same time , new polls show that as the economy is improving and Americans are feeling more secure about the future , the popularity of Clinton ' s health_care reform plan -- by far his biggest social initiative -- actually is declining . An NBC News / Wall_Street Journal poll in mid-January found that of those surveyed 42 % supported the Clinton health plan , while 39 % were opposed to it . In a similar December poll , 47 % of those surveyed were in favor of the Clinton plan and only 32 % were against it . Administration officials and Clinton supporters are fighting hard to counter conservative efforts to depict the health_care plan and other Clinton initiatives as huge new drains on government resources . Instead , Administration officials noted that the President plans to pay_for his new domestic initiatives with offsetting spending_cuts elsewhere . Voters should not see his 1994 agenda as conflicting with his deficit-cutting plans of 1993 , they stressed . &quot; We are not going_to increase the deficit with our proposals for 1994 , &quot; said Tyson . &quot; In fact , the only way to deal with the deficit in the future is to address fast-rising health_care costs through comprehensive reform. &quot; But Boskin and other conservatives view the Clinton agenda quite differently . They argued that , while Clinton ' s social initiatives would start as small pilot_programs , they ultimately would grow to_the_point that Congress would be forced to raise taxes to pay_for them . &quot; This is the mirror_image of Reaganomics , &quot; said Boskin . &quot; In 1981 , Reagan tried to cut taxes to put pressure on Congress to reduce spending . Now , in 1994 , Clinton is trying to build new programs into the budget that ultimately Americans will get hooked on , will require new spending and will put pressure on Congress to raise taxes. &quot;</TEXT>
