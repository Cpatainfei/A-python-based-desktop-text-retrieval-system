   <HEADLINE> SLO IN A FAST_LANE ; CAL POLY FACES GROWING PAINS AS IT TRIES TO BRING DIVISION I SPORTS TO CENTRAL COAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The new kids on the chopping block live here , playing in a nondescript gymnasium on a sleepy campus nestled among rolling hills and fertile farmland in the shadow of Madonna Mountain . One preseason poll had the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Mustangs ranked last among the NCAA ' s 302 Division I men ' s basketball_teams . In another , the Mustangs were No . 301 . Coach Steve Beason expected as much , especially since Cal Poly was 9-16 last season against competition substantially inferior to what it will face in its first season in Division I . &quot; Being the one_and_only new Division I team in the nation , we probably deserve to start at the bottom , &quot; he said . Just so_long as the Mustangs don ' t stay there . Cal Poly , a university perhaps best known for its agricultural and high-tech dairy programs , is poised for an ambitious push toward establishing a top-flight athletic program . Future renovation of the school ' s 4 # 000-seat Mott Gym marks only the start of a campaign that Athletic Director John McCutcheon hopes will provide Cal Poly state-of-the-art sports facilities . Where sheep now graze on grassland adjacent to California 1 heading toward picturesque Morro Bay , McCutcheon envisions a $ 15-million complex that would include a 15 # 000-seat football_stadium , a 3 # 000-seat baseball stadium and a 1 # 000-seat softball stadium . For now , such facilities are dreams captured only in artists ' renderings tucked_away in McCutcheon ' s office . But wheels are in motion . Donations of $ 225 # 000 have been solicited to finance feasibility studies , and the tentative construction site has been approved by the school ' s master planning committee . Small_town . Big plans . The city of San Luis Obispo , which some folks refer to as &quot; SLO Town &quot; because of its leisurely pace , has a population of about 45 # 000 . Cal Poly , a scenic expanse of 5 # 500 acres , has an enrollment of 15 # 400 students who must occasionally absorb eau de barnyard animal when the wind blows from the south . However , the school has a sterling academic reputation and an alumni base of about 85 # 000 -- mostly in California , and several with deep pockets . Television sportscaster John Madden , a former Mustang player and coach , is an annual contributor to the athletic coffers . &quot; We don ' t have 5 # 000 people who contribute $ 1 # 000 ( to athletics ) annually , &quot; McCutcheon said . &quot; What we do have is a handful of people with very significant resources. &quot; Cal Poly also has a place in an established conference , giving the Mustangs a leg up_on Cal State Northridge and Cal State Sacramento , two other state-system schools that in recent years have tried to boost the level of their athletic programs . Beginning in the 1996-97 school_year , Cal Poly will be a member of the Big West Conference , a model-perfect alliance for the Mustangs both competitively and geographically . Conversely , Northridge , one of Cal Poly ' s former Division II rivals , is in its fifth year in Division I and still has not found a permanent home for its athletic teams . Northridge has some teams in the fledging , four-member American West Conference ; baseball and softball as affiliates in the Western Athletic Conference ; men ' s volleyball and soccer in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation and other sports as independents . For the short term , Cal Poly is in a similar situation with football , cross-country , basketball , track and women ' s tennis teams in the American West ; baseball in the WAC ; wrestling in the Pacific 10 and soccer , women ' s volleyball , swimming , softball and men ' s tennis programs as independents . Cal Poly would have stumbled had its students not passed a referendum to provide additional funding for athletics in November 1991 . In the biggest turnout in state college history , more_than 10 # 000 Cal Poly students voted on whether to tax themselves on a graduating scale_up to $ 43 a student per quarter to support the school ' s sports teams . The proposal , which will add an estimated $ 2.3 million to the athletic budget next year , passed_by 253 votes . Before the referendum ' s passage , Cal Poly coaches were_on three-month contracts and the school ' s 17-sport athletic program was_on the brink of being pared to eight . Swimmers were holding themselves out of meets so they could retain an extra year of eligibility should they have to transfer . &quot; We had a fish-or-cut-bait situation , &quot; McCutcheon said . &quot; If the referendum fails , Cal Poly remains Division II -- and probably at the lower end of that level. &quot; A similar referendum recently was narrowly defeated at Northridge , prompting school officials there to consider cutting some athletic programs , football among them . At Cal Poly , the additional funding covers travel , equipment and some salaries . Athletic scholarships come from ticket revenue , a separate student fee of $ 4 a student per semester , plus an annual $ 150 # 000 donation from a foundation that controls money generated by the university ' s bookstore , food services and dorms . School officials are relying_on alumni and community supporters to provide the funds for improved facilities , thereby completing McCutcheon ' s three-tiered recipe for success . Early indications are encouraging . Beason said that during what he had anticipated would be a quick promotional stop at a local Rotary_Club lunch , he was peppered with questions for more_than 40 minutes . Said Chuck Sleeper , Cal Poly ' s assistant athletic director in_charge of fund raising : &quot; There are people who ask , ' How do you expect to compete with UCLA and Stanford ? ' But I run_into more people who say , ' Why aren ' t you ? ' &quot; Joining the ranks of those elite schools will take time and plenty of money , even though Cal Poly plans to keep its football_team at the Division I-AA level , competing against schools such_as Idaho and Montana of the Big Sky Conference . The best attribute of 8 # 000-seat Mustang Stadium , home to Cal Poly ' s football and soccer teams , is an adjacent grassy area convenient for tailgate parties . Cal Poly ' s baseball_team , a Division II finalist in 1993 , plays off campus at Sinsheimer Park , a municipal facility on the outskirts of town where umpires must duck inside the press_box to change . The Mustangs share the field with San Luis Obispo High and an American_Legion team . Softball is played_on campus at a makeshift field surrounded by chicken_coops and pastures . Home_runs to left field have been known to send feathers flying , and cows have been known to mosey over for a look-see . Despite that drawback , softball Coach Lisa Boyer successfully recruited Desarie Knipfer of Soquel High in Santa Cruz . She averaged 15.2 strikeouts per seven innings last season , setting a national high_school record . &quot; Facilities are the only piece of the puzzle not in place , &quot; Beason said . &quot; Once we do that , there ' s no reason we can ' t compete on a par with everyone in the Big West. &quot; McCutcheon is confident that the necessary money can be raised , even in these restrictive economic times . &quot; People don ' t give to a debt , but they ' ll give to a dream , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s like investing in stock. &quot; Just don ' t expect to see Cal Poly ' s marquee investment , its men ' s basketball program , paying dividends any time soon . The Mustangs , 1-11 away from Mott Gym last season , will log 30 # 122 miles and visit nine states in_playing 17 of 26 regular-season games on_the_road . &quot; No one here has put any pressure on us to win right away , &quot; Beason said . &quot; We ' re young , we ' re building , we ' re spreading the word. &quot; Cal Poly last year was the highest-rated public university in the western United States , according to a study by U.S. News and World Report . Beason is confident the school ' s athletic program will take a similar place . He also knows it will be an uphill climb . He remembers meeting a man after a tournament game in the Midwest a_few years ago . The man said he knew of Cal Poly , home of the human-powered helicopter and those entertaining Rose Bowl scoreboard pranks . Beason didn ' t have the heart to tell him he was thinking_of Caltech .</TEXT>
