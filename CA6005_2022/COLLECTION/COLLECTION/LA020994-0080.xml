   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL : ORANGE ; STUDENTS STEP_UP CULTURAL AWARENESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To the several hundred students who gathered around the courtyard at Chapman University ' s Argyros Forum on Tuesday afternoon , the spirited lunchtime exhibition was a step_in the right direction . Actually , it was a whole_lot of steps . In one of the first campus performances of its kind , sisters from the Delta Sigma Theta sorority hopped , stomped and danced in unison , demonstrating an art_form known as stepping . The intricate dance , with origins in African tribal dance , is popular primarily with African American college_students in fraternities and sororities across the nation . Tuesday ' s stepping program kicks_off a monthlong observance of Black History Month at the local university . &quot; A lot of students here are from diverse cultures , &quot; said Kendra Jones , a university_student activities coordinator . &quot; We want to show them this is one aspect of black culture. &quot; Chapman , where about 4 % of its 2 # 500 undergraduates are African American , has no black fraternities or sororities . The four sisters who performed Tuesday are from a Delta Sigma Theta chapter based at Cal State Fullerton . Cassandra Smith , 22 , who is in the sorority but attends Chapman University , said she hopes the step exhibition will help encourage the creation of a black Greek organization on campus . Smith , a senior chemistry and biology major , said the sorority sisters practiced the five-minute dance routine she choreographed for about 10 days before Tuesday ' s performance . &quot; It ' s fun , &quot; said Smith . &quot; It enhances our camaraderie and for students of different ethnic_groups , it informs them about black sororities. &quot; For many of the students enjoying the show Tuesday afternoon , the step performance was definitely something new . &quot; I ' d never seen anything like that before , &quot; said Adam Riffe , 20 , a junior accounting major . &quot; It was cool. &quot; Maggie Varghese , a freshman majoring in political_science , agreed . Programs like this &quot; teach us to be more accepting , which is good since that ' s what it ' s going_to be like in the real_world , &quot; said the 18-year-old , who is in Chapman ' s Alpha Phi sorority . Celebrating Black History Month at Chapman is part of a larger university effort to strengthen campus ties among students of different racial and ethnic_groups , say campus administrators . Similar programs celebrating the contributions of Asians , Latinos and women are planned later this year . MARTIN MILLER</TEXT>
