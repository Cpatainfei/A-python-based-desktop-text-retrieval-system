   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; WAGING A LOW-KEY WAR ON NAPALM ; ONCE , IT WAS THE ULTIMATE SYMBOL FOR THE DIVISIVENESS OF THE VIETNAM_WAR . NOW , THE LAST CACHE LIES NEARLY FORGOTTEN AS THE MILITARY ATTEMPTS TO DISPOSE OF IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just west of this quiet farming community -- a continent away from the stark , black wall_in Washington that commemorates Americans killed in Vietnam -- are three weedy and rocky fields that are host to an equally chilling , if less dignified , memorial to the same war . The fields , part of the sprawling Fallbrook Naval Weapons Station , contain an enduring symbol of that divisive conflict : more_than 35 # 000 canisters filled with 23 million pounds of napalm , a deadly brew of benzene , gasoline and polystyrene plastic that turns_into a flaming syrupy mass when ignited by white phosphorus . Twenty years have passed since the fall of Saigon , but the best and brightest have yet to find a way to dispose_of the Vietnam_War ' s final cache of liquid fire . Like chemical combatants ready for inspection , the cigar-shaped , olive_drab canisters are arranged in neat rows with military precision , each 15-foot-long canister encased in its own open-sided wood crate , row after row , acre after acre , exposed for two decades to the wind and sun and rain . An eerie stillness envelops the napalm fields of Fallbrook , broken only by the muffled sounds of heavy artillery being used miles away by the Marines training at Camp Pendleton . Some of the napalm canisters are still stamped with the manufacturer ' s 30-day warranty attesting to the contents ' killing power . A few are leaking a gooey residue . Those that cannot be patched are taken_to a toxic dump in Arkansas . The specter of napalm bombs being dropped_by American jets once aroused passionate debate , but the fate of this forgotten stockpile has now become a low-key battle of attrition , a bureaucratic mix of environmental concerns , budgetary restraints and governmental red_tape . The residents of Fallbrook , a rural and politically conservative community in northern San Diego County , have learned to live with the napalm -- which is said to be non-flammable without its detonators -- and with the occasional promise that there is light at the end of the hazardous waste tunnel . Technicians and environmentalists , mindful that benzene is a carcinogen and that the crates are soaked with a toxic wood preserver , periodically check for leakage and air_pollution . But mostly the canisters just serve as a staging_area for jack rabbits , rattlesnakes and field rats . In a_few weeks the Navy will officially launch its fourth attempt to win its war against the napalm , this time by paying a company to extract it from the aluminum canisters and send it by rail across the country for use as fuel in high-temperature kilns at cement plants . &quot; This time we think we have a better handle on it , &quot; said Richard Williamson , spokesman for the Naval Ordnance Center , Pacific Division , headquartered in Seal Beach , and point_man for the napalm project . The process , if it works , could take_five years or more and cost $ 12 million to $ 18 million . Throw_in the cost of cleaning_up the three fields where the napalm has been stored , and the price_tag jumps to more_than $ 24 million . After keeping the press at_bay for years , the Navy has decided to try to rehabilitate the weapon ' s image by allowing journalists to visit the napalm fields . Fallbrook residents have been offered tours . &quot; We ' re trying to demystify napalm , &quot; Williamson said . * Perhaps more_than any other word associated with the Vietnam conflict , napalm came_to define the sides in a bitter national -- and international -- debate . In 1972 and 1974 , the United Nations General_Assembly passed resolutions condemning the use of napalm and other incendiary weapons . The United States and the Soviet_Union , which had supplied napalm to the North Vietnamese for their flamethrowers , abstained . In movies , books and poems , napalm has repeatedly entered into the cultural , intellectual and political discourse . The debate over whether the Americans would have used the new , more lethal napalm against a Caucasian enemy hiding among Caucasian civilians is one of the irresolvable issues of Vietnam . In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book &quot; Fire in the Lake : The Vietnamese and the Americans in Vietnam , &quot; Frances Fitzgerald wrote : &quot; In Europe ( during World_War_II ) , the Americans rejected the use of chemical_warfare , but in Vietnam they used napalm , phosphorus , tear_gas , and various kinds of defoliants as a general practice and in such quantities as_to render certain parts of the country uninhabitable. &quot; One of the most searing images of the war was a 1972 picture by an Associated Press_photographer that showed Vietnamese children , including a naked 9-year-old girl , running in terror after their village had accidentally been struck by napalm . In Francis Ford Coppola ' s film &quot; Apocalypse Now &quot; -- seen as a polemic against the war -- the substance is a malevolent character in its own_right . The war-loving Lt . Col . Kilgore , played by Robert Duvall , delivers the famous line , &quot; I love the smell of napalm in the morning. &quot; Even movies and books that take no overt position on the morality or the politics of the war have included napalm scenes as a shorthand method of evoking the carnage and confusion of battle . In this year ' s hit movie &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; the simpleton hero played by Tom Hanks finds himself in Vietnam and acting bravely when his unit is caught in a napalm strike . In the novel by Winston Groom , Gump says : &quot; At dawn they call_in a napalm airplane , but it drop the ( stuff ) damn near right on top of us . Our own fellers be all singed an burnt up -- come runnin out into the open , eyes big as biscuits , everybody cussing an sweating an scared , woods set_on_fire , damn near put the rain_out ! &quot; Despite its horrific image among many Americans , troops in the field said napalm saved innumerable American lives by repelling advances by the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army . Scholar Guenter Lewy , in his book &quot; America in Vietnam , &quot; argued that anti-war activists overstated their claims . &quot; The impression created by critics of the war that many thousands of villagers and children were burnt by napalm is undoubtedly false , &quot; said Lewy , who based his book on millions of pages of secret military documents . Still , Lewy also doubted military assertions that napalm and other incendiary weapons were used with surgical precision and only as a last_resort . In truth , commanders enjoyed wide latitude to call_for air strikes on civilians when they believed that the enemy was hiding among them , he concluded . &quot; The rather free use of napalm and attacks upon fortified hamlets with artillery and air strikes can be criticized on humanitarian grounds , and , moreover , were often counterproductive , &quot; Lewy wrote . Whatever the truth about the number of civilian casualties from napalm , it cannot be denied that its use became a rallying point for those opposed to the war . In one of the angriest of his anti-war poems , Allen Ginsberg wrote : &quot; Under the world there ' s pain , fractured thighs , napalm burning in black hair , phosphorous eating elbows to the bone. &quot; Demonstrators besieged Dow Chemical Co. , which made much of the napalm used in the war . Dowrecruiters were chased off several college campuses . In the Wall_Street Journal , Dow President Ted Doan tried to answer charges that Dow , in making napalm , was acting_as immorally as the German industrialists who had supplied the ovens for the Nazi concentration_camps : &quot; We reject the validity of comparing our present form_of_government with Hitler ' s Nazi Germany . In our mind our government is still representative of and responsive to the will of the people . . . . We plan to continue making napalm because we feel that so_long as the United States is sending men to war , it is unthinkable that we would not supply the materials they need. &quot; Napalm was invented by chemists from Harvard_University and the Army Chemical_Warfare Service for use in flamethrowers carried by U.S. troops in World_War_II . The name comes from its chemical constituents , napthene and palmitate . By 1965 , the Air_Force had developed a new formula for napalm to increase its range and destructive power . The old napalm had merely thrown_out a column of quickly extinguished flame . The new napalm used in Vietnam , which could be spread by flamethrowers or dropped from jets , spread_out quickly , stuck_to surfaces -- trees , bamboo huts , clothing , skin -- and continued burning . Once armed with phosphorus ignition fuses at either end , the 500-pound canisters were strapped beneath Navy and Air_Force jets , most frequently to be dropped at low levels for accuracy . The napalm fire reached temperatures of 5 # 000 degrees , so hot it sucked out all_the air in its path . Today , the United States has eliminated napalm from its arsenal . * In 1978 the Air_Force declared the Fallbrook napalm to be surplus and ordered it demilitarized . But three stratagems by the Navy and environmental agencies in the intervening years to have it carted_off and buried or recycled for civilian uses have failed for economic or regulatory reasons . &quot; It doesn ' t scare me anymore , &quot; said Jennifer Gaggero , who can see some of the canisters on the horizon from the back of the Good Earth nursery she runs with her parents . &quot; I used to be worried about lightning striking it , but you can only worry about something for so_long and then you have to stop. &quot; Navy and civilian officials insist that for all its fiery legacy , the napalm poses no danger to Fallbrook and that only the ultra hot temperatures induced by burning white phosphorus can ignite napalm . Even the heat of a blowtorch would not be sufficient to ignite the stored napalm , officials say . &quot; It ' s an unusual problem , but it doesn ' t present any immediate health hazards to anyone , &quot; said Rich Varenchik , spokesman for the state_Department of Toxic Substance Control . &quot; We could give them a deadline to have the stuff out but we ' re not inclined to do that. &quot; The latest attempt to rid the community of the napalm hopes to capitalize on the mistakes of the past . The first three attempts -- by Barstow Truck in 1982 , Bud ' s Oil from Phoenix in 1983 , and Palm Enterprises from Monrovia in 1992 -- ran_into money trouble , got mired in regulations or otherwise failed to meet the Navy ' s satisfaction . The abandoned and rusting remains of the removal machinery devised by Palm Enterprises still litter one of the fields . This time , the Navy hopes to hire Battelle Memorial Institute of Richland , Wash. , which has a proven record of working_on hazardous materials and high-technology matters for the Department_of_Energy . The firm will be asked to build a facility at the Fallbrook base to extract the napalm from the aluminum canisters -- like toothpaste being squeezed from giant tubes , Williamson said -- without exposing any of it to the air . The plan is to extract the napalm into railroad tanker cars , smelt the aluminum for scrap , and chop_up and detoxify the wooden crates to be made into particle_board . In this round , there may be less interagency wrangling over the disposal . Previously , the federal and state Environmental Protection Agencies have been involved with the napalm issue . So have San Diego County water quality and air_pollution agencies . At one point , the federal EPA became concerned that the napalm canisters were disturbing the nests of the Stephen ' s kangaroo_rat , an endangered species . The Navy is taking the position that local permits are not needed because the effort is being carried_out under an executive order to clean_up toxic sites at military bases as quickly as possible . The local pollution control agency disagrees , but so far has just engaged in a polite volley of letters . Officials from the weapons station , which is_on Ammunition Way , plan a public hearing next month in Fallbrook to brief the public on the latest disposal plan . Charley Wolk , a civic_leader , avocado grower and retired Marine lieutenant_colonel who ordered napalm strikes during Vietnam , does not figure that Fallbrook residents will show much interest . The community , Wolk said , has a heavy contingent of retired military_personnel who know that defused napalm is not combustible . &quot; Nobody who has lived_in Fallbrook for very long is afraid of napalm , &quot; he said . &quot; You could roll those canisters down the main_street and you would n ' t scare anybody. &quot; Napalm Fields Three fields in the Fallbrook Naval Weapons Station contain 35 # 000 canisters filled with 23 million pounds of napalm from the Vietnam_War . The Navy hopes to finally dispose_of them in the next five years .</TEXT>
