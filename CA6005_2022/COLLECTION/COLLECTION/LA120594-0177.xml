   <HEADLINE> CLINTON TO MAKE QUICK STOP AT EUROPEAN SUMMIT ; DIPLOMACY : PRESIDENT WILL SPEND ONLY SIX HOURS AT TWO-DAY SECURITY CONFERENCE . THAT REFLECTS U.S. AMBIVALENCE ABOUT ITS ROLE IN CONTINENT ' S FUTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the bloodiest European war in almost half a century raging nearby and America ' s post-Cold War relationship with Russia turning a bit chilly , President Clinton will swoop in here today to reassert a U.S. role in Europe ' s future . But Clinton plans to spend just six hours at the two-day summit of the 53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe , a schedule that is symbolic of Washington ' s ambivalence about its place in European affairs . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , who arrived in Budapest on Sunday in_advance of the President , hopes to turn the CSCE -- which includes the United States , Canada and almost every European_nation -- into a forum capable of heading_off ethnic wars like the one in Bosnia-Herzegovina . Most U.S. officials , however , concede that the CSCE , created in the mid-1970s as a Cold_War bridge between East and West , has a long way to go before it reaches that goal . Christopher said Sunday that Washington wants the CSCE to have a military peacekeeping role similar to that of the United Nations ' &quot; blue helmet &quot; forces . &quot; A strengthened CSCE with some peacekeeping formula under which they would be able to engage the armed forces of various countries can make them effective , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; The fact that Bosnia has been such a tragedy . . . should not cause us to simply throw_up our hands and fail to engage in conflict resolution wherever we can , wherever conflicts arise , and the earlier the better , &quot; he said . But it is far from clear how a CSCE-established peacekeeping force could be more effective than the U.N. force , which has failed to exert the military muscle needed to force the warring factions in Bosnia to make_peace . Unlike the United Nations , where the 15-nation Security_Council controls peacekeeping operations , the CSCE operates by consensus , meaning that a single member can veto any activity . Moreover , the first test of CSCE peacekeeping probably will be an effort to resolve the conflict between the former Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave . Other ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet_Union are also candidates for CSCE peacekeeping . But some U.S. officials are concerned that Russia might try to dominate such a force , in_effect using the CSCE as a cover_for solidifying its influence throughout the former Soviet empire . Christopher said the Russians should be allowed to contribute something less than half of the troops in any CSCE force . But it is not clear where the rest of the soldiers would come from . John Kornblum , a top State_Department expert on Europe , said that several nations have expressed interest in contributing troops to a CSCE force in Nagorno-Karabakh and other post-Soviet hot spots . But he did not name any of them and said it was unlikely that the United States would participate . At the same time , Russia is advancing a newly assertive foreign_policy that could interfere with U.S. interests , although no one expects the situation to reach Cold War-style tensions . Last week ' s refusal by Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev to participate in a long-scheduled ceremony intended to mark military cooperation between Moscow and the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization was only the latest and most visible example of U.S.-Russian friction . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin has proposed giving the CSCE authority over all regional security matters and abolishing NATO , the military alliance that the United States considers the anchor of its policy in Europe . Christopher insisted that there is no realistic danger of the abolition of NATO . He said U.S.-Russian relations remain basically sound , although he admitted : &quot; we ' ll always have areas of disagreement . . . . we ' ll always have things to talk through and work_through together , as two major_powers naturally do. &quot; The CSCE summit , coming_on the heels of a contentious meeting of NATO foreign_ministers last week in Brussels , underscores the evolving nature of Washington ' s relationship with Europe . From the U.S. standpoint , NATO and the CSCE are the key European institutions because they are the only ones in which the United States is a full member . Nevertheless , Clinton ' s short schedule in Budapest has raised some questions about the importance that the United States attaches_to the meeting . Christopher , however , said , &quot; The fact that he is coming at all , and the fact that he is going_through schedule contortions to be here , is a reflection of his interest and concern. &quot; Unlike during the Cold_War years , the United States has indicated that it is not willing to routinely take the serious military risks that have been required for NATO leadership . David P . Calleo , director of European studies at the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University , said it is time for the United States to play a lesser role in NATO and in the defense of Europe generally . He said Washington should &quot; not pretend to be playing the old role and then not do_it . . . . What causes the bad feeling is to talk_about playing the old role and not do it. &quot; The State_Department ' s Kornblum , a former chief of the U.S. delegation to the CSCE , said the organization gives the United States and other democracies a framework for challenging human_rights abuses in other countries . &quot; The CSCE was the first structure . . . which established that it was internationally acceptable to talk_about behavior inside another country , &quot; Kornblum said . &quot; It had been considered to be an absolute taboo . . . . This is very , very innovative. &quot; BACKGROUND Created in the mid-1970s as a forum for East-West dialogue , the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe includes nearly all European states , the United States and Canada . It started with 35 members , but the collapse of the Soviet_Union swelled its ranks . It now comprises 53 nations , although the membership of the rump Yugoslav state has been suspended . The group has no military structure or armed forces of its own but works to ease tensions and help prevent conflicts . It can act only if all members agree , and this principle of consensus has brought charges that it is unwieldy and ineffective . But it is the only security body to include nearly all states in Europe and link them with North_America . The CSCE has helped to coordinate the enforcement of U.N. sanctions against the rump Yugoslav state and sent small missions to help ease tensions in the Baltic_republics , Tajikistan , Georgia , Moldova , the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia and Ukraine . It is headquartered in Prague , Czech Republic , and a committee of officials meets every week in Vienna to discuss key issues . Summits are held every two years .</TEXT>
