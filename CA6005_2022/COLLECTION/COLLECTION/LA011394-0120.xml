   <TEXT> Work hard . Get normal . That was the rehabilitation philosophy in the 1940s and ' 50s for polio victims , and Grace Young took it to heart . &quot; We were imbued with that philosophy , &quot; said the Downey woman , whose left leg was paralyzed by the disease when she was 9 and living_in St . Louis . After two years of intensive therapy , Young regained the use of her leg , then embarked_on an active life -- she danced , played tennis , worked full time , raised two children and helped her husband with his sales business . She worked hard , got normal . . . and now : &quot; I can ' t dance anymore , &quot; said the occupational therapist at Kaiser Permanente Medical_Center in Bellflower . &quot; Both legs are weak . I can ' t even lift a five-pound weight. &quot; What she should have done during all those years , as it turned_out , was to have taken it a lot easier . Young , 60 , has post-polio syndrome . It came_upon her in the early 1970s when her legs weakened . She responded by riding an adult tricycle every night . &quot; All it did was make me weaker , &quot; she said . &quot; I had no idea how stupid it was. &quot; The change in her condition had taken her by surprise , as it does most polio survivors . They have always assumed that , after having been stable for so_long , there would be no further problems . &quot; Now we know that survivors who have overworked their weakened neuromuscular system are at risk , &quot; Young said . &quot; After 30 years , the nervous_system can ' t stand the demands on it . Muscle_fibers start to deteriorate . The more active ( a person ) has been , the more likely ( he or she ) will get it. &quot; According to government health statistics , about 600 # 000 of the 1.6 million polio survivors in the United States are experiencing late effects of the disease , which usually begin about three decades after the disease first invaded their spinal_cords . Many of these people , like Young , have been forced to return to wheelchairs and wear braces . Young conducts classes at the hospital for polio survivors who are having new problems . She tells them to modify their lifestyles . &quot; You can slow_down the process , &quot; she told a recent group . &quot; You can arrest the symptoms by conserving ( energy ) . &quot; The therapist has gained a national reputation in post-polio syndrome . In 1992 , she addressed a Canadian polio conference in Vancouver , B.C. , and she has written a book titled &quot; Conserve to Preserve -- A Polio Survivor ' s Guide to Energy Conservation , &quot; which will be published soon by the International Polio Network in St . Louis . &quot; She ' s very knowledgeable , &quot; said Dr. Jacquelin Perry , who has been seeing polio patients at Rancho Los Amigos Medical_Center in Downey for 38 years . She diagnosed Young ' s condition in the mid-1970s , but it was so new it had yet to acquire a name . &quot; Not everyone is going_to get_it , &quot; said Perry , who conducts post-polio clinics . &quot; Just those who overdo , and sometimes ( living a ) normal lifestyle is overdoing. &quot; A pleasant woman with an expressive face highlighted by eyebrows that peek above fancy-framed spectacles , Young became interested in post-polio syndrome in 1986 when she entered USC to earn a master ' s degree . The syndrome , which had been infrequently discussed in medical literature , was the topic of her thesis . &quot; At first I went_back ( to school ) to stretch my mind , then I realized this was an area I knew_nothing about and should learn , &quot; she said . &quot; It was pretty much unexplored . All I knew was that I had it . So it became like a crusade. &quot; She learned from Perry and by attending medical conferences that conserving energy is the preferred treatment for the syndrome . In Young ' s classes , which she has been conducting for four years , polio survivors are often shocked and dismayed when they learn why they are becoming weaker . &quot; One woman cried through the whole_thing and didn ' t come_back for 3 1 / 2 years , &quot; Young said . Such reactions don ' t surprise Young because of the nature of polio patients . &quot; A very high percentage are hard-driving , goal-oriented perfectionistic and ambitious people , &quot; she said . &quot; Everybody has pushed them to work very hard , do what everybody else did. &quot; As James Ingham , 46 , of Buena Park , left a recent class , he said , &quot; It ' s a little bit scary when you first find_out about this . You get_to the point where you think this is behind you and you have a normal life , and then you find you might be facing this in the future. &quot; ( Young estimates that 60 % to 70 % of polio survivors will get post-polio syndrome. ) Ingham got polio at age 2 and was in braces and an iron_lung . But since elementary_school , his life has been_active and normal . He has always exercised and , recently , joined a fitness club . He said he is not sure if he has experienced post-polio syndrome symptoms . &quot; I ' m wondering , &quot; he said . &quot; At my age there ' s a certain amount of slowing_down anyway. &quot; His speculation is typical . &quot; They think they ' re just getting older , &quot; Young said . &quot; As polio survivors , we were all taught to ignore pain and fatigue , so a lot of us don ' t notice when things are getting bad. &quot; Ingham said he is convinced now that strenuous exercise is not the best thing to do , but he plans to keep swimming , which Young recommends . &quot; It ' s the one exercise polio survivors can do -- unless they overdo it , &quot; she said . &quot; You just have to pay_attention to pain . If it causes pain , stop. &quot; * Young tells patients to sit whenever possible -- &quot; standing takes 25 % more energy &quot; -- and to eliminate stairsteps from their lives . &quot; I sit for almost everything , I sit when I cook , &quot; said the therapist , who wears a leg brace . She walks as little as possible , for the most part getting_around in an electric cart . She lives_in a home full of ramps and adaptive equipment with her mother , two daughters , who do her marketing , and a son-in-law . Her husband died two years ago . She also has a housekeeper . &quot; I ' ve been extremely lucky that I ' ve been able to continue working full time , &quot; said Young , who conserves energy on_the_job by using her cart and taking noon-hour naps . In the hospital ' s occupational_therapy room , she works amid an array of exercise apparatus . She helps patients -- who include stroke and accident victims -- strengthen their muscles . &quot; I don ' t have to do everything they do , I just show them how to do the exercises , &quot; she said . &quot; But the job is a little stressing because I have to be up and down getting equipment. &quot; * When polio patients enter the room , they never are handed dumbbells . Instead , Young evaluates their lifestyles , determines their level of weakness and , if she thinks they need braces , refers them to doctors . And she puts them in her energy conservation classes . More_than half of those who have attended the classes have reported less pain and fatigue , Young said . &quot; People can relate to me , &quot; she said . &quot; They listen to me because I ' ve been through it . I ' m no able-bodied young chick. &quot;</TEXT>
