   <HEADLINE> REPORT FAILS TO IDENTIFY CAUSE OF OXNARD OIL SPILL ; ENVIRONMENT : BERRY PETROLEUM STUDY ALSO DOES NOT ADDRESS HOW THE ACCIDENT WENT UNNOTICED FOR THREE DAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A report issued by Berry Petroleum , the Taft-based oil_company responsible_for one of the worst pipeline spills in Ventura County history , fails to address what triggered the spill and how it went undetected for three days , state investigators said Wednesday . The 15-page document , which said the cause of the rupture is still unknown , was submitted to the Regional Water Quality_Control Board after the oil_company received a two-week extension . &quot; Obviously , there are a_few things that need to be figured_out , &quot; said Shirley Birosik , a state water quality investigator . &quot; I will be asking_for a supplemental report that would include more information. &quot; But a Berry Petroleum official on Wednesday said the report represents all_of the information about the spill the company has been able to piece together . More_than 84 # 000 gallons of thick crude leaked from an underground pipeline into ecologically sensitive McGrath Lake and the ocean near Oxnard , after at least six law_enforcement agencies failed to follow up early reports of the spill . The ruptured pipeline spewed heavy crude for at least three days before a federal Minerals Management Service worker spotted offshore oil_slicks early Christmas morning . The Jan . 21 report downplays the effects of the crude_oil on the environment , concluding that roughly a quarter-acre of reed and marshland was damaged and that &quot; the effects were limited to transient visual impacts. &quot; The state released copies of the report Wednesday after consulting its attorneys and investigators . It concludes that there is no apparent or potential ground_water contamination attributable to the spill , and that it has caused no known public health risk . Brent Winn , the Berry Petroleum environmental coordinator who prepared the analysis , listed more_than 215 birds and other species that died after the spill . But , he wrote , &quot; It is important to note that it has not been established that the attached list represents species killed as a result of the ( oil ) release. &quot; He declined Wednesday to discuss his findings . The dead birds include two California brown pelicans , which are_on the federal_government ' s list of endangered species . However , one of the two was found badly decomposed and likely died from other causes , Winn reported . Mark Caywood , the state_Department of Fish and Game inspector heading the investigation , also called the report incomplete . &quot; It lacks some fortitude as far as exact cause and responsibility and not noticing ( leakage ) for a prolonged period_of_time , &quot; said Caywood , who by April will recommend to local prosecutors whether criminal charges should be brought against Berry officials . &quot; However , it ' s quite normal to get kind of a wimpy ( report ) , &quot; he said . &quot; They ' re not going_to put anything in writing as long as there ' s a chance of litigation . It ' s normal that when anything can be litigated , you keep your mouth shut and let the attorneys do the talking. &quot; Caywood said he already knows much about why Berry failed to shut_down the pipeline for &quot; a period of days , &quot; but declined to discuss the ongoing investigation . &quot; I ' ve got answers , but I can ' t say they ' re entirely satisfactory , &quot; said Caywood , who said the cleanup may be signed_off by next week . An oil_company official said Wednesday he had no idea how workers failed to notice for three days that the oil was not reaching its designated holding tank . &quot; When we have an answer to that we ' ll address it to the agencies and it will become available , &quot; said spokesman Ray Hatch . &quot; All the information that we have is in the letter we sent to the regional water board. &quot; Investigators first suspected that interference from nearby pipelines equipped with electric safety devices hastened the break because Berry Petroleum never installed one of the units on the ruptured pipeline . Cathodic protection devices emit small electric_currents that help prevent external corrosion , but they are not always required by law . An official with the state division of oil and gas said earlier this month that the top two likely reasons for the break were structural failure or internal corrosion , symptoms unrelated to electrical interference . Most of the oil has been cleaned_up from the different spill sites . On Wednesday , a crew of workers manned a single boat on the lake surface , apparently gathering samples from the lake_bottom . Heidi Togstad , a fish and game environmental specialist , said cleanup crews now are concentrating their efforts on the creek and upper portion of the tiny , 10-acre lake . &quot; They are cutting vegetation from the entire perimeter of the lake , &quot; she said . &quot; Entire trees have been taken_out of the creek to remove oily debris , sediment and roots. &quot; Richard Rojas , chief ranger for the Channel Coast District of California State Parks , said experts are now evaluating how best to remove oil that has settled to the bottom of McGrath Lake . &quot; But we don ' t yet know how to do_it , whether we should try to dredge it out , suction it out or drain the lake and remove it that way , &quot; he said . Birosik , the water quality investigator , said she would request a supplemental report from Berry Petroleum early next week . &quot; I ' m eventually going_to get the information , &quot; she said .
