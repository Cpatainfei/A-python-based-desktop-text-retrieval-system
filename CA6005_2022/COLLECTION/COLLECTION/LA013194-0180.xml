   <HEADLINE> THE RULES OF THE ROAD ; COMMUTING : BE NICE TO THE DRIVER . THE ROACHES DON ' T BITE . BE_ON TIME . HERE , IN BUS RIDING 101 , ARE THE IMPORTANT THINGS QUAKE-INDUCED ROOKIES SHOULD KNOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Their suits are a little too pressed . Their eyes dance alertly and excitedly , maybe out of fear -- but probably because gritty urban experiences are new_to them and the novelty hasn ' t worn_off . I speak_of the new breed of bus riders . It took an earthquake to get them out of their cars and onto the buses , but they aren ' t committed commuters yet . More like tourists , checking things out . They give_off an E-ride excitement that screams : &quot; Gee-whiz , I ' m actually riding the bus . Ain ' t this fun ! &quot; And when they ' re not being wide-eyed , they ' re packing attitude , arriving on board dishing_out tons of condescension . This may work in executive suites or health clubs , but not on buses . Buses , like earthquakes , are great social levelers . It is a wise commuter who remembers that in this world , it is the driver who is in_charge of dispensing attitude adjustments . Welcome to the bus culture . Once you learn a_few simple rules , things will get a whole_lot easier and you might even enjoy the ride . Lots of us do . What follows is a 10-point program that will help get you there and back with a minimum of aggravation . Point One : It pays to be courteous to the driver . Drivers are good friends to have . They ' ll look and even wait for you at pickup points , and they ' ll make_sure you don ' t sleep through your stop . On the other hand , riders who openly complain or insult their drivers by telling them how they can cut five minutes off the commute had better be ready to step_up when the bus arrives . And if you ' re running late , you ' d better be wearing running_shoes because drivers aren ' t going_to wait . They might even give the accelerator a little nudge to speed_up a bit . Pay-back time . Point Two : Look before you sit . You never know what to expect . Gum , puke , food crumbs and other stuff may be there . Bring along a rag to give your seat a once-over . Point Three : The roaches don ' t bite . New riders are sometimes startled to see a fat bug waddling down the aisle , blissfully ignorant of the havoc it ' s creating . Some people have even been known to shriek . Not to worry . They are harmless . On the other hand , don ' t pet the creatures . On a bus , you never know where they ' ve been . Point Four : Be_on time . A popular misconception is that buses run late . Wrong . If the bus_stops at your corner at 5:42 , be ready to eat exhaust fumes if you arrive_at 5:43 . On the other hand , don ' t schedule surgery and expect the bus to get you there on_time . Buses overheat , break_down and get caught in traffic_jams just like cars . Sometimes they are very late . This usually happens when you need them the most . Point Five : No one talks in the morning . Exchanging pleasantries and small_talk may be more tolerable during the evening commute , but don ' t try it in the morning . There is a good reason for this : Commuting by bus is a no-brainer from start to finish , so people don ' t wake_up until they have to . They kind of stumble on board half-asleep . In such a state , they don ' t appreciate being awakened . Point Six : Do your nails at_home . Clipping nails , putting_on nail_polish or pulling_out an emery board in a bus is inviting trouble . Few things seem to bring_out the worst in bus riders , but doing a manicure is one of them . Nail_polish is smelly enough to overwhelm even highway stink , which is saying a lot . Point Seven : Beware the windows . Nothing , even nails , can touch_off an on-board disturbance like windows . Buses have two levels of air conditioning : none or cold enough to refrigerate meat . But opening a window for relief , even a crack , can create a monster draft . Newspapers fly , bad hair days develop and mini-twisters swirl down aisles , picking_up dirt , candy wrappers and other bus litter . Best to reach a consensus with other riders on this one . Point Eight : Buy a pass . This is the advice from a veteran driver , who says bus passes can help you avoid problems created when you leave your exact change as a lunch tip or have only a $ 10 bill and must beg other riders for change . Besides , pulling_out big bills on buses can be risky . &quot; Some bus_lines are OK . You can carry $ 1 # 000 on you and not worry . But others , I would n ' t get_on_with a nickel in my pocket , &quot; one driver said . Point Nine : Learn street-corner camouflage . Bus riders do a lot of standing around Downtown street_corners , so learning how to blend into the background is critical . Grungy raincoats help , particularly if they cover_up designer suits . Looking prosperous or compassionate doesn ' t work here . You might as well hang a sandwich_board around your neck saying , &quot; Panhandlers ! I ' m fresh meat . Molest me. &quot; Veteran riders avoid eye_contact and master these glazed , bored looks that say , quietly but firmly : &quot; Go away. &quot; Point 10 : Think_about a survival kit . When you ' re all alone out there , with nothing but 20 or so miles of hard road ahead , you may find it handy to pack a radio . Earplugs help for the times when you get stuck next to a noisy window that wants to shake itself loose or if you happen to sit in front of people who shout as if they ' re in a wind_tunnel . Maybe add a book or two so you can look busy when some newcomer gets_on and wants to chat . * Shuit is a regular rider on MTA Bus No . 457 . If he misses that bus , he catches the Blue Line , then takes the 121 , 131 or 51 Long_Beach Transit_lines home .</TEXT>
