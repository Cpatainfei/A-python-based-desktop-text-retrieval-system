   <HEADLINE> LABOR STRIKE TEAM INSPECTS FARMS ; AGRICULTURE : STATE OFFICIALS LAUNCH TWO-DAY ENFORCEMENT EFFORT IN COUNTY . SANTA PAULA NURSERY IS FINED AND SHUT DOWN FOR WORKERS ' COMP VIOLATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> State investigators Tuesday launched a crackdown on Ventura County agricultural operations suspected of violating labor laws , including a Santa Paula flower grower who was shut_down for allegedly failing to insure his workers against on-the-job accidents . During the first day of the two-day enforcement effort , members of a multi-agency strike team inspected farms and nurseries from Oxnard to Santa Paula in response to complaints that workers were being paid below minimum_wage or were not being paid at all . The countywide effort is expected to continue today , including a sweep_through the food-rich farm belt that stretches from Saticoy to Moorpark . &quot; This is part of an overall effort that we are going_to be making throughout the year , &quot; said Jose Millan , who heads a year-old statewide effort to enforce labor laws designed to protect farm_workers and other laborers . &quot; We are going_to build_upon this for a major sweep later this year. &quot; The investigators are members of the Targeted Industries Partnership Program , or TIPP , established in late 1992 to beef_up enforcement in the state ' s agriculture and garment industries . So far , members of the joint enforcement and educational_program have conducted more_than 600 agricultural inspections statewide and issued more_than 400 citations resulting in more_than $ 1 million in fines . In Santa Paula on Tuesday , investigators added another $ 16 # 000 to that total . At Windward Farms , a small nursery located just north of the Santa Paula Airport , workers told investigators that they are paid irregularly and often their paychecks can ' t be cashed because of insufficient funds . One worker said he had not been paid in nearly a month . Another said he is owed payment for 70 hours of work . &quot; Everything here is bad , &quot; said one worker , wrapping dried flowers in sheets of plastic underneath a run-down fiberglass shed . &quot; We go_to cash our checks and sometimes there aren ' t any funds . Sometimes it takes days to get our money. &quot; John Whitton , owner of the flower ranch , told state investigators that he owes money to a_few workers but that due_to an accounting problem there has been a delay in payment . He also said that he realized some workers have tried to cash checks but could not . He said there are now sufficient funds in the bank to cover all_of the checks that have been written . &quot; We ' re trying to stay in business in California and we ' re trying to make a decent workplace , &quot; Whitton said . &quot; It takes all_of my resources to keep this thing going . All of my money goes_to my employees. &quot; At the rear of the property , workers dipped flowers into steaming vats of sodium_chloride , citric_acid and water . Many employees weren ' t wearing gloves or masks . Runoff from the vats collected in a pond at the rear of the property , a_few hundred yards from the Santa Clara River . Greg Smith , environmental health specialist for the county , said the county responded to a complaint of chemicals being dumped at Windward Farms about two years ago . No violations of hazardous waste laws were found . But because of the complaint made Tuesday , Smith said he will conduct another inspection at the flower ranch . State investigators said they will review the handling and disposal of chemicals to determine whether there were any violations of state health and safety laws . &quot; It ' s the injustice of it all , &quot; said Roy A . Byron-Cooper , a Ventura-based inspector with the state ' s Division of Occupational Safety and Health . &quot; It ' s the little guy who doesn ' t know any better and who ends_up getting screwed. &quot; But it was the failure to provide workers ' compensation insurance to the flower ranch ' s 16 employees that prompted state investigators to shut_down the operation . Investigators ordered Windward Farms to cease operation until insurance was secured and issued Whitton a citation for $ 16 # 000 -- $ 1 # 000 for each employee not covered by insurance . Whitton said he is in the process of acquiring workers ' compensation insurance . State investigators said they will continue to review the case to determine if more citations and fines should be assessed . &quot; We did not know the extent of the environmental problems . We did not know the extent of the wage problems , &quot; Millan said . &quot; Those are significant here. &quot; Inspectors visited two other agricultural operations Tuesday . No violations were found at one of the sites , an Oxnard nursery . At the other site , a farm labor contractor , no crews were working . Formed partly in response to criticism that the state ' s agriculture industry was riddled with abuses , TIPP has been conducting inspections up and down the state . The program is designed to coordinate and strengthen the efforts of state and federal agencies responsible_for enforcing labor law . Major sweeps have been conducted in Kern , Imperial and Riverside counties . Smaller sweeps have been done_in San Diego , Orange and San Luis Obispo counties . Millan said the current two-day sweep -- which includes employees from Cal / OSHA and the state labor commissioner ' s office -- is aimed at addressing concerns that not enough is being done to enforce farm labor laws in Ventura County . Also toward that end , the state labor commissioner has assigned Deputy Labor Commissioner Tony Guilin to do field inspections throughout the county . But the enforcement effort has drawn the wrath of farm_worker advocates who charge that the program is a public relations ploy designed to polish the state ' s tarnished image when it comes_to labor law_enforcement . Advocates say they have little confidence in the program , blasting it as too weak to scare lawbreakers into compliance . &quot; We hope the Labor Commission ' s effort is more_than a cosmetic effort , which frankly I see a two-day operation as being , &quot; said Eileen McCarthy , an attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance . &quot; Because the abuses are so rife in this area , this kind of enforcement really can ' t be done on a catch-as-catch-can basis. &quot; Despite such remarks , Millan said he believes the enforcement campaign is paying dividends . &quot; We recognize there have been problems and we have addressed those problems with the limited resources available to us , &quot; said Millan , noting that the program recently received an additional $ 894 # 000 in funding to stay alive through fiscal_year 1994-95 . &quot; This program gets us out of our offices and into the fields and the nurseries where the problems exist. &quot;</TEXT>
