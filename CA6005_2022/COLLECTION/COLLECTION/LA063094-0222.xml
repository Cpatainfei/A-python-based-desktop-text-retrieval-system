   <TEXT> Forty-nine years ago , the U.S. Army treated Kurt Rosenow , then a technical_sergeant , to one of the finer karma warps of the 20th Century : Ordered back to his native Berlin , he was put_to_work sifting the rubble of what had been Adolf Hitler ' s capital , trying to assemble a paper trail of the Third_Reich . Who , exactly , had belonged_to the Nazi_Party ? What had made the joiners join ? How could the newly victorious Allies identify Nazi war_criminals among the many Germans who were now protesting their innocence ? How to amass the evidence needed for successful prosecutions at the Nuremberg trials , just getting under way that summer ? Into the shattered streets went Rosenow , a German Jew who had wisely taken ship for America in the summer of 1939 , just weeks before Germany separated itself from the civilized world in_earnest . A successful Berlin lawyer , he had been working as a butler in New York when he was drafted in 1944 and assigned to Army intelligence . Now back in his native city , he and a small group of colleagues began going from house to house , bombed-out ministry to bombed-out ministry , trying in each place to build enough confidence among the shaken survivors to make them tell him where the evidence lay . And tell him they did . &quot; We were overwhelmed by the mass of paper that came_in , before we actually knew what had happened , &quot; says Rosenow , today a sturdy 88-year-old who lives with his wife in the northern German city of Hanover . Rosenow didn ' t know it at the time , but the papers he and his team were putting_together would eventually make_up one of the most extraordinary archives in the world : the most complete documentation of the Nazi era ever produced . Rosenow went_on to become the archive ' s first civilian curator , after he was discharged from the Army in 1946 . Which puts him in a special position today , for now the archive , known as the Berlin Document Center , has become the focus of a controversy stretching across the Atlantic , from Germany to the United States . On Friday , Berlin ' s trove of one-of-a-kind documents will pass from American administration to German hands . Some researchers have argued that under German stewardship , the unique files will be less accessible . What , say the critics , will happen when someone wants to look_into the past of a prominent German politician or his family ? Will German archival authorities , uneasy about naming Nazi-era names , be willing to open incriminating files for all to see ? Privacy laws in Germany are , after all , far stricter than in the United States , proscribing the publication of certain pivotal information until a person has been dead at least 30 years . &quot; Of course , I ' m afraid &quot; about future access to the Berlin Document Center , says Anna Rosmus , a woman from the city of Passau who has made a career of ferreting sensational information out of various German archives and publishing her findings . Her tribulations were portrayed in the film &quot; The Nasty Girl. &quot; &quot; I ' m not sure I ' ll have the opportunity to see those files again , &quot; says Rosmus , 34 . &quot; For years and years , I ' ve had firsthand experience of how much easier it is to get information from the Americans than from the Germans. &quot; The Berlin Document Center stands today just where it did at the end of World_War_II : in a barracks-like complex surrounded by barbed-wire fencing that contrasts unpleasantly with the comfortable and well-landscaped residences nearby . During Nazi times , these barracks and the vast chambers beneath them housed an immense telephone surveillance center run_by Field_Marshal Hermann Goering . Rosenow can still remember how eerie it was when the Americans moved_in and found the basements filled with eavesdropping devices , the wires all cut . For months , during late 1945 and early 1946 , Rosenow and his colleagues filled these rooms with hundreds of tons of documents -- 75 million pages , or enough , he says , to reach eight miles into the sky if stacked one atop the other . Today , there are nearly 11 million files on members of the National_Socialist German Workers ' Party -- an estimated 85 % of the total membership -- still arranged in the original wooden file_cabinets from party headquarters . There are 600 # 000 files on the members of the SS , each with a Lebenslauf , or autobiographical statement , and more_than half a_million files on the Brownshirts , the organized street bullies who promoted Hitler in the years leading to his assumption of dictatorial powers . About 75 # 000 files track the careers of assorted Nazi doctors , some of them mere opportunists and not particularly interesting but some of whom went_on to become part of the Hitler killing machine and case studies in the human capacity for fiendishness . Here are Nazi_Party membership_card No . 6 # 421 , 477 , belonging_to the now-celebrated Oskar Schindler ; Goering ' s suicide notes , scribbled before he took cyanide in 1946 ; SS chief Heinrich Himmler ' s meticulous expense_accounts , and the SS papers of Erich Priebke , now awaiting extradition from Argentina on charges that he helped murder 335 prisoners in 1944 . Here , too , are files that can only be described as bizarre : thousands of marriage applications , for instance , filed with the SS by eager couples who hoped to work as breeders for the racially pure Aryan nation that Hitler wanted to build . These lovers had to persuade their SS superiors to check &quot; Ja &quot; after the question , &quot; Is procreation by this person desirable for the nation ? &quot; They did so by submitting proof of their worthiness : handwritten autobiographical sketches , medical_records , dental charts , photographs and exhaustive , church-registered pedigrees dating_back six generations . Such obsessively detailed information is tailor-made for social historians trying to learn more about Germany in the years before Hitler rose_to_power . But it has also been invaluable to Nazi-hunters trying to locate their aging quarries . Perhaps the most celebrated example arose when a skeleton , believed to be that of the Auschwitz doctor Josef Mengele , was found in Sao Paulo in 1985 . Forensic scientists turned_to the Berlin Document Center ' s files and found , in Mengele ' s marriage application , information about his teeth and bone_marrow , scarred as it had been by a childhood infection -- the only reliable such information in the world . The details were then cited as conclusive proof that the skeletal remains were , indeed , Mengele ' s . The center has been used in every major and minor war_crimes investigation since the Third_Reich fell , says David Marwell , the outgoing American director , himself a historian and former chief of the Justice_Department ' s Nazi-hunting unit . &quot; Not because we have specific war_crimes information , but because we have key personnel files that show where people were and when. &quot; For more_than a quarter-century , American and German officials have been debating , on and off , who the rightful stewards of the Berlin Document Center ought to be . Other Nazi archives once in Allied hands have , after all , long since been microfilmed and passed back to the Germans . But for the Berlin Document Center it has taken longer to decide because the papers are so personal and so revealing . Americans were concerned about access under German law , and many Germans were content to leave such sensitive papers in foreign hands . &quot; We have had politicians in Germany who were also members of Nazi organizations , &quot; notes Siegfried Buettner , vice_president of the German Federal Archives and the man directing the transfer . It was the fall of the Berlin Wall_in 1989 , the unification of the former East and West Germanys and the subsequent stand down of the American forces in Berlin that led to the decision to hand_over administrative control to the Germans . According to Buettner , the files will be incorporated into the German Federal Archives but kept as a free-standing set of documents within the collection . Meanwhile , a complete set of microfilms is being shot -- 38 # 000 rolls at a cost to Germany of more_than $ 8 million . Under the terms of the transfer agreement , these microfilms will be kept_on file at the National Archives in Washington , in case Germany goes_back_on its repeated assurances of free access . But these plans have left Jewish organizations , historians and other researchers unsatisfied . &quot; On a practical level , we have gone_a_long_way toward getting written and oral assurances from the ( German ) government , &quot; says Elan Steinberg , executive_director of the World Jewish Congress , who cites pledges from Bonn that the Nazi records will be readily available in Germany until the microfilmed copies are ready in Washington . &quot; We will continue to monitor the situation , &quot; he says . But , he adds , &quot; There is also a moral issue , and I ' m afraid it cannot be resolved . These are documents that belong_to the United States , because we paid_for them with the most precious commodity we have : the blood of young American soldiers . Why give_back these documents ? I see no reason why the Germans can ' t have the ( microfilm ) copies. &quot; Anna Rosmus , the self-made historian in Passau , says American attitudes have made her work possible . In her first project , 11 years ago , she says , she wanted to write a school paper on what Passau ' s town fathers had been up_to during World_War_II . When she ran_into a wall of stone at the municipal archives -- no one wanted to reveal the Nazi activities of local leading lights -- she sued . The judge in the case said that if the Americans at the Berlin Document Center were willing to let Rosmus study their supersensitive files -- which they were -- then the local authorities would have to let her look_into the city archives . &quot; I got free access ( in Passau ) because it was the Americans who got_to decide , &quot; Rosmus says . &quot; I am sure that if it had been up_to the German authorities , I would not have been given access. &quot; Although the Passau dispute involved municipal archives , Rosmus says she has encountered bureaucratic obstacles at the federal level too . Access problems arise mainly about files that name people still living , or dead less than 30 years . Such information falls_under Germany ' s data protection laws , which instruct federal authorities to balance the researcher ' s right to know against the individual ' s right_to_privacy . &quot; We have to check ( the researcher ' s project ) and balance it against the legitimate interests of the person concerned , &quot; says Buettner , adding that the law gives officials latitude to decide in researchers ' favor . &quot; I don ' t feel ( excessively ) powerful , I feel responsible , &quot; he says , &quot; to make adequate compromises and find the right balance . The German privacy law gives us the responsibility to discern correctly . We find it rather handsome. &quot; Buettner says German archivists sometimes give researchers only a summary of a file ' s contents ; in other cases , they may let the researcher view the file . In the most liberal decisions , the researcher may even make and distribute photocopies . But photocopying is limited , Buettner says , to protect innocent third_parties who are sometimes named in files -- spouses , lovers , children -- who were never Nazi_Party functionaries . Rosmus argues , however , that the inability to make copies can sometimes jeopardize researchers and their work . In one case , she says , she found_out that the mayor-elect of her hometown had been a Gestapo informant , and she thought her fellow citizens had a right to know . But since the politician was still alive , German privacy laws prohibited her from copying the archival evidence , and the politician was able to deny her charges -- at least initially -- and to threaten to sue her for slander . Rosmus protected herself , she says , by persuading a German television crew to go_into the archive and make an illegal videotape of the incriminating documents . Then , once the mayor-elect made his denials , the television crew broadcast the proof , and he had to resign . &quot; If this file had been in any American archive , I would n ' t have had to use such a trick , &quot; Rosmus says . True enough , Rosmus concedes , there will always be those microfilms of the Berlin Document Center_on file_in Washington ; a researcher who can afford the trip will be able to make photocopies . At his temporary offices in Potsdam , housed in a pleasantly ramshackle compound that used to house the central state archives of East_Germany , Buettner sighs . &quot; You have to be aware that this is an old discussion , &quot; he says . &quot; These arguments are not new . They have only been sharpened &quot; by the Berlin Document Center transfer . &quot; In general , I see some distrust of the German government , the German bureaucracy and German society , &quot; he says . &quot; This is a political question and difficult for me to respond to . It is a problem that we will have to deal with for decades , and I would not want to respond to it with aggression . I can try to imagine how these people are feeling . But there is an inability to differentiate between Germans in_general and Nazis. &quot; In Hanover , Rosenow , the original curator of the Document Center , has similar feelings . &quot; I hate these expressions : The Jews . The Germans . The Communists . The Russians , &quot; he says . &quot; There were members of my wife ' s and my own family who came_to death . But I have never blamed ' the Germans. ' In my work , I have found_out that you cannot say , ' This one is a black_sheep , but that one has a clean coat. ' The area in between black_and_white is very , very wide. &quot; Rosenow goes_to his home_office and returns with a record of the work that taught him such lessons : a diary of those street-to-street searches that he made in 1945 . Each day , with lawyer-like precision , he kept a detailed log , in English , of his impressions and findings as he made rounds to what he called &quot; targets &quot; -- buildings where the Army thought there might be Nazi documents . Many of the entries say simply , &quot; Target completely destroyed , &quot; but for other days there is a wealth of recorded revelations . Here is the 39-year-old Rosenow interviewing the ear , nose and throat specialist who X-rayed Hitler after the failed assassination attempt in July , 1944 , that left the Fuehrer with ruptured eardrums and a damaged jaw . There he is_on another day , charging into a basement on a tip and finding a weird collection of carved stones assembled in connection with Ahnenerbe -- the Nazis ' pseudoscientific effort to identify a noble Germanic tradition . &quot; We were surprised by the extent of ( the Nazi terror ) &quot; as the documents began to accumulate , Rosenow recalls . &quot; We had already learned about the mass executions , either by firing_squad or gas , shortly after the war . But the numbers were shocking . &quot; In 1946 . . . we got the special reports of the Einsatzgruppen , &quot; he says , naming the group that conducted the evacuation and killing of Jews in the Baltic_republics and Poland . &quot; These were plain statistics -- officers reporting back to their commanders that so-and-so many Jews from the following towns were liquidated . That was the expression used , liquidated . The numbers went_into the tens of thousands . That was shocking . And there was no doubt in my mind that these documents were real , not falsified. &quot;</TEXT>
