   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / ROBERT SCHEER : YOU THOUGHT THE COLD_WAR WAS DEAD ? ; WE ' RE BUSY DEALING WITH CHINA , VIETNAM , EVEN NORTH_KOREA , BUT CUBA ? NEVER ! WHY IS THAT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fidel Castro should start futzing around with the rods in his nuclear_power plant at Cienfuegos , or hint that he ' s bought some of the plutonium that ' s being smuggled out of Russia . Anything to make_it look_like he ' s building a bomb . That way the Clinton_Administration , following the example of its policy toward North_Korea , would feel required to lift the economic embargo that has strangled Cuba for 33 years . Nothing else seems to work to get this Administration to re-evaluate a policy of isolating Cuba that made little sense when the Cold_War was_on and is simply bizarre in its aftermath . How in the world can the Clinton_Administration justify diplomatic recognition and trade with the communist nations of China , Vietnam and now North_Korea while maintaining the trade_embargo with Cuba because it ' s a communist country ? Is it that the Asian reds are no longer reds , or that they have a better human-rights record , or pose less of a potential military threat ? To argue any of that would be absurd . North_Korea is suddenly presented with diplomatic exchange , trade and billions in nuclear technology without even being requested to make the slightest alterations in what remains one of the world ' s most tightly repressive and bellicose regimes . The opening to China , and more recently to Vietnam , was justified by reference_to those countries being open_to foreign investment . The U.S. embargo makes such investments on the part of American corporations , and their foreign subsidiaries , in Cuba illegal . Despite severe U.S. pressure , 112 joint_ventures worth $ 500 million were put into place in the past three years by British , Italian , French and Spanish companies . U.S. Cuba policy is irrational , yet rarely is Clinton challenged by reporters on the obvious contradiction of continuing the Cold_War against Cuba . We blockaded Cuba three decades ago because that small island was judged an outpost of Soviet power . Has Clinton not noticed that the Soviet_Union no longer exists ? The sad truth is that Cubans are being denied the benefits of trade afforded the Chinese and Vietnamese because of a hard-line emigre claque in Miami . There is ample evidence that they no longer speak_for many Cubans eager to aid relatives on the island , but they are still terrific at intimidation . One who is clearly intimidated is Bill_Clinton . In the 1992 election , he supported the tightening of the trade_embargo which George_Bush , like Ronald Reagan previously , had opposed . Thanks to Clinton and the Democratic Congress , the embargo was tightened in brazen denial of the changed world reality . This action was condemned by an 88-4 vote_in the United Nations . It was a stupidly cruel move that hurt ordinary Cubans while saving Castro the challenges of a more open society . As Roger Fontaine , former national security aide in the Reagan_Administration , wrote : &quot; The 1992 law is a policy of impoverishing Cubans at the behest of the most militant conservative groups in the emigre community . It is polarizing Cuba -- driving many anti-Castro Cubans back into Mr. Castro ' s camp . . . and enhancing his reputation as a fearless fighter of Yankee capitalism. &quot; But let ' s say the policy works and we succeed in ratcheting up the misery of ordinary Cubans already suffering from the abrupt withdrawal of Soviet subsidies . Is upheaval and disarray in Cuba really in our national interest ? Have we no memory of the Mariel boat lift ? Are we really prepared to take_in millions of more Cuban refugees when we currently imprison Haitian refugees at our Cuban base in Guantanamo ? We continue to view Castro as nothing more_than an outlaw while blindly ignoring our nation ' s past crimes in his region , including numerous documented efforts to sabotage the Cuban economy and to assassinate Fidel . His rule has been complex , filled with major achievements as in education and health and profound failure in civil_liberty . There is no need to whitewash Castro any more_than to continue demonizing him . But surely , if we can get_along_with the very people whom we fought in Vietnam and Korea , we can heal the wounds left over from the minor skirmish of the Bay of Pigs . If Clinton fails this test of leadership and allows the situation to deteriorate , the cost in the suffering attendant to internecine warfare in Cuba will make the upheaval of the Mariel boat lift , and the more recent Haitian exodus , seem like a Caribbean cruise .</TEXT>
