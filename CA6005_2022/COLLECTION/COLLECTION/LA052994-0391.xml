   <HEADLINE> CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS : FRONT-LOAD WASHER CLEANS BETTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : My skin is sensitive to detergent residues in clothes and I need to buy a new clothes washer . What clothes washer design is the most efficient and provides the best cleaning and rinsing ? ANSWER : Front-loading clothes washers provide the most thorough cleaning and rinsing . Some models even have allergy rinse cycles for people sensitive to detergents . Over its lifetime , a new front-loader can save over $ 1 # 500 in water , detergent and energy costs as compared to a standard top-loader . With a front-loader , the washer tub rotates on a horizontal axis ( like a clothes_dryer ) . This tumbles the clothes through the sudsy water up_to 50 times per minute for superior cleaning . The typical top-loader model just swirls the clothes slowly through the water . Since the clothes tumble through the water in a front-loader , the tub has to be only partially filled with water for effective cleaning . These designs use 30 % to 50 % less water and 60 % less detergent than a top-loader . This saves water and energy and reduces pollution in our rivers . One front-loader uses a unique &quot; hydromatic &quot; cleaning process . The agitator fins in the tub are designed like ladles too . First , the tub rotates slowly for 5 seconds as fins lift the sudsy water and it falls onto the clothes . For the next four seconds , it stops and lets the clothes soak . Then it spins faster for 5 seconds to agitate the clothes through the water . This cycle repeats every 17 seconds . Another model reverses the tub rotation every 13 seconds . This improves cleaning and reduces tangles and wrinkles . Very thorough rinsing is a plus with many front-loaders . Some of the European models have up_to five separate rinses per cycle . This virtually eliminates all_the detergent residue and dinginess from your clothes . With the horizontal axis tub , front loaders can spin as fast as 1 # 500 r.p.m. ( revolutions per minute ) . This extracts more water and detergent residue . A typical top-loader spins at about 700 r.p.m. High-speed spinning also reduces the required time in your dryer , another significant energy savings . Front-loaders are smaller ( only about 27 inches wide ) than top-loaders because the large agitator is not needed . Since the door is in the front , you can stack the dryer on top of the washer to save floor space . Some models have built-in water heating elements so you only need to run a cold water_line to it . The top-quality European front-loaders have built-in shock_absorbers for vibration-free spinning and are very quiet .

What to Do About Solar Window Crack Q : Several years ago , I built a solar window heater that you recommended . It works great , but the clear acrylic plastic cover is starting to crack . What should I do to fix it ? A : You ' ll have to replace the clear acrylic plastic cover . You apparently installed the acrylic cover too tightly or did not allow_for clearance holes . Once tiny cracks start in acrylic , they tend to grow until the entire piece is shot . Acrylic , like most plastics , expands and contracts a lot with temperature_changes . Use some type of compliant weatherstripping below it and make large clearance holes at the screws to allow_for this expansion .</TEXT>
