   <HEADLINE> A NOBEL IS NOT A PRECURSOR TO SAINTHOOD ; PEACE PRIZE : IT ' S POLITICS , OFTEN INTENDED TO NUDGE NASCENT RECONCILIATION EFFORTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Yasser Arafat , Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres are awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this weekend , it won ' t be the first time the prize has been the center of a storm of controversy . Of all_the Nobel prizes , the peace prize has the potential to generate the greatest debate because it is , invariably , linked to politics . Two other Nobel Peace Prizes of our time stirred extraordinary passion . Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho of North Vietnam shared the prize in 1973 for negotiating an end to a war both had prosecuted with some vigor . In 1985 , the selection of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War drew furious protest because the group ' s co-president , Yevgeny Chazov , was a high-ranking Soviet doctor who in 1972 had signed a letter critical of Andrei Sakharov , who was awarded the peace prize in 1975 . This year ' s choice stirred controversy even before its formal announcement , and was followed by a series of events proving just how fragile the Middle_East peace process is . Within hours of the announcement , an Israeli soldier who had been kidnaped by the anti-Arafat Hamas was executed . Within days , the Israeli-Jordanian peace accord was signed , a terrorist bomb exploded on a Tel Aviv bus killing dozens of civilians , and Syria ' s President Hafez Assad , meeting with President Clinton , appeared to be making small steps toward peace with Israel . At the very least , critics said , the choice of Arafat , Rabin and Peres was premature . While one might quarrel with this year ' s selection , much of the debate flows_from misconceptions about the prize itself . The first misconception is that the Nobel Peace Prize is a secular form of sainthood . There is an implicit expectation that every recipient will be like Mother Teresa , a selfless servant without blemishes , contradictions or apparent ego . But these characteristics , no matter how appealing , are not prerequisites to peacemaking . The second misconception is that the peace prize is a reward for good deeds . The prize is often a stick , not a carrot , used by the Nobel committee to send signals to governments , to rouse public_opinion or to give momentum and recognition to fledgling efforts at reconciliation . In citing the anti-nuclear physicians in 1985 , for example , the Nobel committee explicitly linked the prize to ongoing disarmament negotiations in Geneva , hoping that the recognition of a Soviet-American organization would give new urgency to those talks and to an upcoming Reagan / Gorbachev summit . With this year ' s recipients , the committee is recognizing the first fragile steps taken by former adversaries . But , more important , the committee is encouraging the floundering Middle_East peace process forward . The committee ' s decision is , ultimately , a political one , not a moral one . A third misconception about the prize involves the selection process itself . Though its ultimate choice is usually a closely guarded secret , the Nobel committee does not work in hermetic secrecy . It works year-round gathering information on nominees and surveying the global political landscape . The committee is frequently the target of well-organized campaigns on behalf of some nominees . Any member of a national legislature , any previous recipient , any professor in the liberal arts and sciences can , with a simple letter , add a name to the list . What often lifts names to the top of the list is an orchestrated effort to garner the support of luminaries whose opinions may carry weight with the committee . There are , to be sure , profound moral dimensions to the issues of war and peace , but analysis of the peace prize must recognize what it is . It is the world ' s highest political honor , not a free pass_through the pearly gates .</TEXT>
