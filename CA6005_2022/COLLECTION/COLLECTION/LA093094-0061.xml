   <TEXT> The 5-year-old boy thought he would fake out the new baby-sitter by hiding under the bed . And this kid could hide , 13-year-old Anna Harrison of La Canada Flintridge recalled . She searched every inch of the house , calling the boy ' s name , and even went_to a neighbor ' s home to look_for him before the child crawled out , laughing uproariously . &quot; Oh yes , didn ' t I tell you about that ? &quot; his mother said later , way too casually . &quot; He doesthat all_the time. &quot; In the annals of baby-sitters ' horror stories , Anna ' s tale doesn ' t even come_close to the widely publicized ordeal of 14-year-old Angela Morris of Pittsburgh . But situations in which young baby-sitters are exploited or even abused are far more common than most adults realize , according to experts and sitters themselves . In Angela ' s case , the eighth-grader agreed to watch four children for three days earlier this month while their parents worked_out of state . Her pay was to be $ 75 -- just above $ 1 per hour . But three days came and went , and the parents failed to return . Concerned that if she contacted town authorities , the children would be shipped to separate foster_homes , Angela called a meeting in a neighborhood pizza_shop and organized an ad_hoc baby-sitting consortium . By the time the mom and dad finally showed_up 16 days later -- to be charged with endangering the welfare of their children -- Angela had drafted three friends to help and had resorted_to using her own money to feed her young charges . At the Jane Neff Middle_School in Pittsburgh , Assistant Principal George Shevchik complimented the student for compassion and ingenuity under duress , and said plaudits for Angela had even come from the White_House . He described Angela as remarkably self-possessed . &quot; She actually apologized to me for causing such a disturbance , &quot; Shevchik marveled . Mindy Bingham , a Santa Barbara specialist in adolescent female development , also characterized the Pittsburgh teen-ager ' s resourcefulness as exemplary . &quot; When I heard about this story , I went , ' YES ! ' &quot; said Bingham , whose newest book , &quot; Things Will Be Different for My Daughter , &quot; will be published by Viking in February . She praised the young baby-sitter as &quot; a problem-solver , a critical thinker who was capable of coming_up with creative solutions. &quot; In retrospect , Bingham said she could have used a dose of that kind of clearheadedness in her own youthful days of baby-sitting . She was &quot; all_of 11 or 12 years old &quot; when a neighbor offered her the then-standard fee of 35 cents per hour to watch an infant for the afternoon . &quot; She said the baby would be sleeping , and so , by the way , would I do the dishes ? &quot; Bingham recalled . What greeted her was a week ' s worth of filthy dishes , &quot; every dish in the house , &quot; Bingham said , still shuddering , &quot; including pans crusted with boiled milk. &quot; But most early adolescents have not yet learned the language of assertiveness . Setting boundaries , defining the terms of a job &quot; are not skills that we teach young people , &quot; Bingham said . &quot; Therefore the kids who are baby-sitting can easily get themselves into situations where they are taken_advantage of. &quot; Veteran sitters say it is not uncommon to be kicked , hit , sworn at or even spat upon by the children they look_after . Informed of their children ' s misbehavior , parents may respond by denial , by shrugging it off or by blaming the sitter for provoking such uncharacteristic actions in their perfect little angels . &quot; Everybody runs_into terrible , terrible 2-year-olds , twins that are impossible and horribly spoiled children , &quot; said Craig Walker , who as editorial director of Scholastic Books in New York reviews much of the correspondence that comes_to Ann Martin , author of the wildly successful &quot; Babysitters Club &quot; series of books for young readers . Books from Martin ' s 77-title series about &quot; hard-to-handle kids &quot; ring especially true_to her readers , Walker said . But sitters are often hesitant to mention misconduct . Most are too young and too inexperienced to seek employment elsewhere . And as Anna Harrison pointed_out , &quot; You don ' t want to complain because you might lose the job. &quot; Anna ' s sister , Sabrina Harrison , now an 18-year-old college_student in Oakland , recounts a baby-sitting nightmare of_her_own . As an example of &quot; just a slight little something that they forgot to put_on their list , &quot; as Harrison put it , the parents of an 8-year-old boy she was caring for neglected to tell her that the boy needed medication -- &quot; Ritalin I think it was &quot; -- to treat a behavioral disorder . On her watch , the medication wore_off . Abruptly , the child bolted_out the front_door and began racing &quot; down the side of the Angeles Crest Highway , &quot; nearby . With the boy ' s older brother to help , Harrison chased after the 8-year-old and subdued him . &quot; The mother was like , ' Oh whoops , ' when I told her , &quot; she said . Fortunately , she has repressed some of her other equally traumatic adventures in baby-sitting . &quot; But I know I have come_home crying after baby-sitting , many times , &quot; Harrison said . Still , cases of abuse by baby-sitters tend to get more attention than incidents where the sitters themselves are mistreated . To Mark Lattman , whose family has owned the Babysitters Guild in Los Angeles for more_than 20 years , the focus seems misplaced . &quot; It ' s a lot more common the other direction , &quot; where the baby-sitters are abused or exploited , not the children they are taking_care of , Lattman said . On several occasions , customers have stayed out all night unexpectedly , Lattman said . &quot; We actually had one situation where the sitter had to bring the baby into the office here because she had another job to go to. &quot; That case , he said , ended_up in the hands of county child welfare officials .</TEXT>
