   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : DOGFIGHT FOR GRUMMAN ; THE RUSH TO DO DEALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Northrop Corp. ' s stunning decision to launch a hostile bid for Grumman is another sign that many companies -- and not just defense companies -- believe the time to do strategic deals is now , investment_bankers say . That should translate into a pickup in hostile_takeover offers overall this year , perhaps bringing_back memories of the tremendous corporate battles of the late 1980s -- and providing a welcome new source of support for stock prices . Yet the reality is that few large hostile deals have succeeded recently , as QVC Network ' s recent failed bid for Paramount Communications vividly demonstrated . The major reason that hostility hasn ' t worked is the most obvious reason : A company that really doesn ' t want to be bought makes a poor partner , assuming that the deal is meant to be a true merger and not a bust-it-up , sell-it-off transaction like so many in the ' 80s . &quot; Not a lot of people meet their future spouses under difficult situations , &quot; one investment_banker noted wryly . The heyday for hostile deals was in 1988 , the RJR Nabisco era , when such takeover offers totaled $ 210 billion and accounted_for 62 % of U.S. takeover_bids , according to Securities Data Co . But with the collapse of the junk_bond market in 1989 , the subsequent ruin of many corporate raiders and the bank credit squeeze that began in 1990 , hostile_takeovers became far more difficult to do . In 1992 , the value of announced hostile offers was a mere $ 7.8 billion , or just 5 % of all deals , Securities Data says . Last year , hostility revived as a takeover concept , pushing the value of announced hostile offers to $ 18.2 billion , or 7.5 % of all bids . Much of that total , however , was accounted_for by the ill-fated QVC offer for Paramount . Why believe more buyers will go hostile this year ? First , a pickup in unsolicited offers will be a function of more deals in_general , friendly and hostile . With the U.S. economy on solid footing and corporate confidence soaring , many companies are eager to expand their businesses in significant ways , investment_bankers say . &quot; I think this is going_to be the year for intra-industry consolidation , &quot; says Dan Case , a principal at the investment banking firm Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco . He believes potential acquirers will be motivated in large part by investors ' optimistic expectations for corporate profit growth , which are reflected in high stock prices . In an extremely competitive world economy , it ' s tough to produce the healthy earnings growth your shareholders expect without also increasing your market share meaningfully , Case says . Most important , hostile deals are easier to launch now because financing is once again plentiful . Major banks are in better fiscal shape than in many years and so are eager to lend money , as Northrop discovered : It apparently had no trouble lining_up $ 2.8 billion in financing commitments from Chase Manhattan and Chemical Banking for the Grumman bid . &quot; Banks are willing to lend a bigger percentage of an acquisition price than they were even a year ago , &quot; says James Zukin , a principal at Century City-based Houlihan Lokey Howard &amp; Zukin , a firm that advises companies in takeover deals . In addition , raising money via high-yield junk_bond offerings is again a snap for companies that choose to go that route . For example , Thrifty Drug Stores is using high-yield bonds to buy PayLess Drug Stores , a deal that might have been impossible just two years ago . Banks and junk_bond investors are necessary parties to most hostile offers , because unsolicited offers need to be in cash -- not in the acquirer ' s stock -- to have a decent shot at succeeding , investment_bankers note . While it makes_sense for friendly_takeover deals to be done with stock swaps ( especially if the buyer ' s stock is selling for a high price relative to earnings , making_it a cheap currency for the buyer ) , the best way to lure an unwilling target ' s shareholders is with cold cash . That may also be the only legal way to close a deal , especially if a hostile offer is made_for a company that has already chosen another suitor . In the Paramount case , the Delaware court that heard QVC ' s challenge to Viacom ' s friendly_takeover deal with Paramount made_it clear that once a company puts itself up for_sale , the directors ' responsibility is to get the highest and best price . In the end , Viacom was able to convince Paramount shareholders that its offer was best , but not before allowing QVC into the bidding process . With many companies angling to jump far ahead of their competitors in market share as the economy expands , friendly_takeover offers are more likely to be followed by rival bids this year , bankers say . In effect , an offer for a competitor is a challenge to all other potential suitors in the field . And with cash more readily available from banks and junk_bond buyers , &quot; it becomes tougher to defend that first deal_out of the box , &quot; one investment_banker says . Still , this isn ' t likely to be 1988 all_over again . Most deals are done for strategic reasons today -- a company seeking a fit with another , as both Northrop and Martin Marietta believe that Grumman ' s defense operations can be successfully integrated with their own , for shareholders ' gain . In the late ' 80s , in contrast , takeovers were led by raiders who simply sought to buy a business for $ 100 , then sell its pieces for $ 150 . Before this takeover wave is finished , however , it ' s also possible that classic bust-up transactions will reappear , so_long as the money to finance them remains available . &quot; History tells you that liquidity begets transactions , &quot; a banker reminds . Indeed , in the defense sector , the strong cash flows enjoyed by many of the players , and the relative ease with which individual defense contracting units can be broken off , may make what ' s left of the industry particularly vulnerable to bust-ups . Consider : General Dynamics has essentially chosen to go that route itself , selling_off pieces of the company and distributing the proceeds to shareholders in cash dividends . Litton Industries decided last year to split itself , leaving defense operations in the old Litton and spinning_off its oil field services and other commercial businesses in a new company , Western Atlas . In the defense industry and many others , &quot; There ' s a sense of urgency on the part of a lot of corporations to do something , &quot; one banker says . And to a large degree , we may just be at that phase of the economic cycle where takeover mania is inevitable : As confidence returns to business , egos take_over and corporate managers begin to believe that growth by eating others is their manifest_destiny . Plus , of course , it generally beats being eaten . Hostile Deals : A Tough Sell Hostile_takeover offers have been increasing in number , but the recent success rate for the largest ones hasn ' t been stellar .
