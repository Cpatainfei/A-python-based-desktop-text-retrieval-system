   <HEADLINE> CLINTON ' S ECONOMIC ORDEAL : PROMISES DOOMED BY MATH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As they shifted gears from running a presidential campaign to running the country in the early days of 1993 , Bill_Clinton and his senior economic advisers confronted two major challenges : crafting a coherent economic program that could get_through Congress , yet keeping faith with the many promises Clinton had made during his frantic race for the White_House . There was just one big problem . The numbers in &quot; Putting People First , &quot; the celebrated Clinton campaign bible that helped power the Arkansas governor to the White_House in 1992 , simply didn ' t compute . Living_up_to Clinton ' s campaign promises would be like squaring a circle . Almost all_of Clinton ' s senior aides had known that for months . The evidence that Clinton was promising more_than he could deliver had become painfully clear to Clinton ' s aides as early as May , 1992 -- even before the George_Bush campaign revved_up its full-throated attack accusing Clinton of basing his campaign agenda on faulty arithmetic . &quot; Putting People First &quot; was not Clinton ' s first attempt to craft an economic plan for his campaign . Early on , he and his advisers , especially campaign manager James Carville , had sensed the public ' s hunger for substantive answers from the presidential candidates , especially on the domestic issues of the economy , jobs and health_care that President Bush had largely ignored . So the first Clinton economic agenda was unveiled during the New Hampshire primary campaign , allowing him to claim he was the man with a plan . The New Hampshire plan was fine , as far as it went . Developed largely by economic_policy aide Rob Shapiro , it hit upon many of the major themes that would later dominate Clinton ' s general_election campaign . But it was really just a manifesto , not a budget ; it did little more_than attach Clinton ' s name to ideas that had been espoused for years by the Democratic Leadership Council , the centrist think_tank Clinton had helped raise from the ashes of the party ' s defeats in the 1980s . For example , it proposed two middle-class tax cuts : a 10 % across-the-board reduction for the middle_class and a dependent tax_credit that would have saved average-income families $ 480 for each child . But the New Hampshire plan didn ' t make any attempt to balance the accounts . In fact , it wasn ' t until Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination that his aides first dared , even internally , to add_up the costs of the promises he had made during the primaries . Shapiro ran the numbers in late May and for a brief time thought he had made the math work . But , to his horror , he found he had accidentally double-counted anticipated savings from military cuts proposed by the Bush_Administration . The real_numbers were frightening . Cumulatively , Clinton had promised tax cuts and new spending that would exceed by $ 100 billion the tax_hikes and spending_cuts that were supposed to offset their costs . But with Clinton trailing in the polls in late May and early June and scrambling to avoid the humiliation of a third-place finish -- behind both Bush and Ross Perot -- the campaign staff was prepared to take risks . Prodded by both Carville and Clinton ' s key political adviser , George Stephanopoulos , campaign advisers developed and published &quot; Putting People First &quot; in less than a month . That allowed Clinton to unveil an economic plan by the time Perot announced his candidacy in late June . To be sure , &quot; Putting People First &quot; backed_away from some of Clinton ' s most ambitious promises during the primaries . Instead of two tax cuts for the middle_class , Clinton would offer just one . Yet some of the document ' s budgetary assumptions were still highly suspect . It called_for cutting the deficit in half in four years , but specified only one program for elimination : a subsidy paid to beekeepers that cost a mere $ 16 million a year . Clinton had refused to endorse further spending_cuts proposed by his advisers because he didn ' t have time to check them out with Democratic leaders from the affected states . The plan also suggested that $ 45 billion could be raised over five years by enforcing existing tax laws on foreign corporations , even though no tax expert in the country believed that tougher enforcement could raise more_than $ 4 billion . Above all , the plan relied_on $ 91.7 billion from higher taxes on the rich , combined with rapid economic_growth to satisfy Clinton ' s promise to halve the deficit , finance a $ 60-billion tax cut and underwrite $ 220 billion in new &quot; public investments. &quot; It was Clinton ' s version of the Reagan-era &quot; magic asterisk. &quot; The deficit would shrink , the campaign said , because better times lay ahead . The numbers problem grew worse as the campaign dragged_on . In developing a platform , planners relied heavily on the official economic forecast issued by the Congressional Budget Office in January , 1992 . But in August , just as the general_election campaign was gearing_up , a CBO revision rendered obsolete virtually all_the campaign ' s calculations . The projected deficit for fiscal 1996 , for example , was raised to $ 254 billion from $ 178 billion ; the estimated 1997 shortfall went_to $ 290 billion from $ 226 billion . Clinton ' s promise to chop the deficit in half while cutting taxes for most Americans was no longer within even shouting distance of reality . His campaign plan was consciously designed to be a mirror_image of Reaganomics , a bold attempt to reverse 12 years of Republican policies . But , like the Reaganauts before them , Clinton and his team were so anxious to start a revolution that they chose to overlook the harsh truths of federal budgeting . It was as if Clinton ' s campaign advisers were the descendants of David Stockman , the budget director who acknowledged only in hindsight that Reaganomics was a sham . Still , the Clinton campaign was silent about the CBO revisions until after the election . Luckily for Clinton , the media largely ignored the changes too , and the Republicans weren ' t about to make a big issue of the fact that the deficit was getting_worse on Bush ' s watch . That enabled Clinton -- now President-elect -- to profess to reporters in December , 1992 , that he was stunned by the new deficit projections emanating from the Bush_Administration . In a Wall_Street Journal interview , he said the deficit appeared much worse than it had when he assembled his economic plan earlier in the year . In background interviews , aides expressed outrage that Bush ' s budget director , Richard Darman , had used his power to keep the widening deficit figures secret until after the election . If Clinton was surprised by the new numbers , it was only because he was emerging from the cocoon of the campaign and finally focusing_on what his most senior aides already knew -- not because he was confronted with genuinely new information . The fact was , Darman ' s new deficit projections were strikingly similar to the CBO ' s August estimates . Still , many in the Clinton_Administration point to their April , 1993 , re-estimate of Darman ' s work -- which predicted that the deficit for 1997 was_on course to hit $ 346.3 billion unless Clinton ' s economic plan was approved by Congress -- to prove that Darman had been misleading them all along . But the Administration ' s forecast -- clearly designed to make the final Bush-Darman report look as bad as possible -- was at least as disingenuous as any budget ploy Darman had pulled . For his final deficit forecast , Darman assumed that limits on &quot; discretionary &quot; spending ( the budget_for the Pentagon and most civilian government operations , but excluding entitlement programs such_as Medicare and Social_Security ) would continue through fiscal 1998 . Under the 1990 budget agreement , discretionary spending was capped until 1995 , but Darman calculated that Congress would extend the limits and freeze discretionary spending . His final budget kept total discretionary spending frozen at $ 539.1 billion from 1995 through 1998 . Clinton ' s budget director , former Rep . Leon E . Panetta of California , said there was no basis for Darman ' s assumption . In his new budget , Panetta simply forecast that the cap on discretionary spending would be lifted after 1995 . When the Administration unveiled the outlines of its economic plan in February , the deficit forecast reached that $ 346.3-billion range . No one in the Administration really expected Congress to allow unfettered discretionary spending . Indeed , within weeks of the release of Panetta ' s new numbers , Congress vindicated Darman ' s assumptions . In the budget resolution that would provide the framework for the Clinton economic plan , Congress and the Administration agreed not only to extend the legal spending caps beyond 1995 , but to impose just the sort of freeze Darman had used in his estimates . Discretionary spending would be held at $ 547 billion after 1995 , just $ 8 billion more_than Darman ' s last projections . Were Clinton and his advisers less than forthcoming when they blamed Bush and Darman for their woes ? Ask Administration officials today and many will insist there was genuine surprise . Others smile and philosophize , not for attribution , about the nature of campaign rhetoric and the difficulty of defining truth within a political context . Still , some senior advisers , including Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Panetta , readily concede they were not surprised at all by the deficit forecasts . Neither were key members of the Clinton campaign staff . Economic policy director Gene Sperling , Shapiro and others discussed the CBO revisions soon after they were released in August . &quot; There was no surprise , &quot; one adviser said . &quot; You just can ' t stop a campaign and suddenly revise your platform . Bush didn ' t do_it ; Perot didn ' t do_it . And what would Bush have said if we suddenly had said , ' Wait a minute , we need to update &quot; Putting People First ? &quot; ' He would have said , ' Look , I told you their numbers were wrong , and now they are admitting it. ' &quot; Yet behind closed doors , the campaign staff was , in fact , updating the fiscal projections ; a pre-transition team headed by Ira Magaziner began the work in August , 1992 . &quot; We knew the deficit was getting_worse , and we expected Darman to try to show some surprises in the deficit , and we tried to take those into account , &quot; said one participant . Clinton knew about the work , but in the rush to the Nov . 3 election , he apparently never received a full briefing on the effort . It wasn ' t until the transition that the timing appeared right to remake the Clinton economic program into one better showing the new President ' s willingness to give deficit reduction a much higher priority than anyone outside his inner_circle could have imagined . Through most of 1992 , Clinton privately had hated his campaign proposal of a broad-based , middle-class tax cut . He was sure it had cost him the New Hampshire primary , where rival Paul Tsongas had labeled him &quot; pander bear &quot; for offering sugarcoated economic prescriptions that ignored the deficit . Clinton ' s liberal advisers -- notably Robert Reich , now labor_secretary -- also disliked the tax cut , believing it would soak_up scarce resources that could better be spent on domestic programs . What the liberals didn ' t foresee was the about-face of the post-election transition . In place of a tax cut would come a proposal for a $ 71.5-billion energy tax that would land squarely on the middle_class . Yet the success of Clinton and his key advisers at transforming his agenda into one that emphasized deficit reduction quickly got_out of control , as Congress pushed the new President further than he had ever wanted . When Clinton spoke_of the need to bear pain and sacrifice to cut the deficit , miffed moderates and conservatives in Congress noted that the first major piece of legislation he had sent was a short-term stimulus plan larded with government pork . And , while his subsequent deficit-reduction package included plenty of real tax increases , it was noticeably light on genuine spending_cuts . For all his tough-sounding rhetoric , Clinton was facing hard choices . That became clear when his first formal budget proposal , issued in April , did not comply with Congress ' five-year spending caps -- restrictions Clinton had promised to meet just two months earlier . What ' s more , Clinton ' s program barely addressed the surging expense of entitlement programs , the real culprits behind the deficits of recent years . Critics began to observe that the Administration ' s deficit-reduction plan looked a lot like the infamous 1990 budget agreement , which failed to control the deficit because it ignored spiraling entitlement spending . Another failure by Washington to curb the deficit -- this time on the Democrats ' watch -- could kill the party ' s credibility on economic_policy and unhinge the bond markets , where Clinton was counting_on support for his plan to produce lower interest_rates . So Congress won drastic changes in the Clinton plan . His energy tax was abandoned in favor of a more modest gasoline_tax and deeper cuts_in Medicare and other entitlement programs . Federal spending would fall sharply , despite the potential risks to the nation ' s economy . Fortunately , in the second_half of 1993 , things clearly broke Clinton ' s way . Interest_rates fell and the economic recovery finally gained traction . The creation of new jobs was running at double the monthly pace in the last year of the Bush_Administration . Both the CBO and the White_House issued more upbeat deficit forecasts in early 1994 . But in February , 1994 , as the economy seemed solid and Bill_Clinton finally felt he could focus_on health_care and welfare reforms , the Federal_Reserve_Board yanked him back to earth by raising interest_rates for the first time in five years . For an American President , Clinton was learning , the economy is one headache that never seems to go_away .</TEXT>
