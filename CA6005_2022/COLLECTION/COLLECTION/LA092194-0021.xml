   <HEADLINE> FORSWEARING THE COMMONPLACE ; EUPHEMISMS MAY NOT BE THE ANSWER , BUT HOW ABOUT A LITTLE IMAGINATION IN OUR VITUPERATION ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I ' m no good at swearing . My parents sorely neglected my education in profanity . My mother ' s strongest oaths were &quot; phooey &quot; and , when extremely vexed , &quot; Oh , for heaven ' s sake. &quot; About once a year , my father would accidentally bang his thumb with a hammer and repeatedly take God ' s name in vain , but that was as bad as he got . The worst cursing I heard in my childhood was from our dentist . He had been in the army for years , and the air turned blue while he worked_on his patients ' teeth . I didn ' t pick_up any of his vocabulary , however , and thought that the invective was just part of the whole awful experience , like the shots and the drill and the pain . I learned early that language could be dangerous . A boy was kicked_out of my kindergarten class for uttering a naughty word . Try as I might , I could never find_out what the word was . I thus spent my preschool years in terror that it would one day drop randomly from my lips . I feared becoming the girl in the fairy tale whose mouth spewed vipers and toads and who finally crawled to a corner of the forest to die . In grade_school , foul language was forbidden . By then , I knew at least some of the words I wasn ' t supposed to say . Occasionally , boys caught swearing were hauled_away by a male teacher to have their mouths washed_out with soap . I didn ' t believe that scrubbing an offending tongue would cleanse the mind , but I kept my thoughts to myself . One afternoon , the seventh- and eighth-grade girls were assembled . Rumor had it that one of us had been overheard saying &quot; damn &quot; in the schoolyard . The principal lectured us for more_than an hour , warning that we would never grow_up to be ladies if we spoke such blasphemies . I asked if it was acceptable to say &quot; darn &quot; or &quot; doggone &quot; and was told that such words , although less offensive , were still unladylike . This answer troubled me . I didn ' t wish to &quot; talk dirty , &quot; but I liked the idea of euphemistic remodeling . My mother had told me it was all_right to say &quot; H-E-double toothpicks &quot; in place of &quot; hell. &quot; If utterance and not thought was the issue , then substitutes provided a clever escape_from censure . By the time I finished college , the ' 60s had started . In language , all you-know-what broke_loose and has never frozen over . It was as if much of the country ' s population had suddenly been struck with Tourette ' s Syndrome , the rare affliction that forces its victims to cuss compulsively . And it was not just men who began punctuating every_other sentence with expletives ; women , too , began to swear like stevedores . Phrases once seen only on the walls of public bathrooms were heard everywhere . The world was made safe for linguistic democracy . But it was too late for me . I couldn ' t bring myself to say aloud the classic Anglo-Saxon obscenities . I couldn ' t even mutter them under my breath or write them on the roof of my mouth with my tongue . To express intense feelings , I said things like &quot; aw , shoot ! &quot; and &quot; oh , fudge ! &quot; Why should a_couple_of vowels or consonants mark the boundary between propriety and impropriety ? Sometimes , small things can make a big difference in how we create our social selves . My inability to be a successful swearer may be a symptom of a larger cultural issue . All too frequently , profanity seems anti-female in its uses and intentions . I ' m probably not the only woman who feels I ' m borrowing a masculinist mode if I rail at someone . Profanity , as it is now practiced , cannot give me authority in my own voice as a woman . It ' s hard to imagine what a feminist way of swearing would be , but perhaps someday our own expletives of empowerment will evolve . I ' m not against the concept of swearing . As Mark Twain said , &quot; Under certain circumstances , profanity provides a relief denied even to prayer. &quot; But I ' m bored with the commonness of today ' s curses . Almost everyone shouts the same no-longer-shocking insults , slings the same spray-paint slurs . When you see someone lean out of a car and start yelling at another driver , you can fill_in the blankety-blanks yourself . Vituperation has a role to play in our daily frustrations , but a little bleeping creativity couldn ' t hurt .</TEXT>
