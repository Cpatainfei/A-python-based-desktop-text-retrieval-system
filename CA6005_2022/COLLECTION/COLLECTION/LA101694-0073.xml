   <TEXT> Although uneven , it is surprising how close this 1993 reworking of the_French film &quot; The Return of Martin Guerre &quot; gets_to the traditional three-hankie satisfactions of classic ' 40s weepers.Set in 1867 in a benighted Tennessee hamlet , it stars Richard Gere in the title_role as the town ' s biggest landowner , who strolls in after not having been seen nor heard from since he left for the Civil War seven years before . As surprised as his faithful old dog to see him is his wife ( a radiant Jodie Foster ) . Gere , not at his best in costume pictures , and Foster prove persuasive anyway , amid an inordinate amount of Southern foolishness ( HBO Sunday at 4 p.m. ) . Kenneth Turan</TEXT>
