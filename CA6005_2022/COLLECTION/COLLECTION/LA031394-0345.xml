   <HEADLINE> FATHER FIGURE ; TO GEORGE RAVELING , WINNING IS TEMPORARY , AND SO IS LOSING . WHAT LASTS ARE THE MEN HE MOLDS ON HIS USC TEAMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> IN THE LIFE OF A BASKETBALL_TEAM , THERE IS A TIME TO plant and a time to reap . And then there is a time to motivate . &quot; Fellas , this is the team that laughed_at us last year , &quot; George Raveling drawls , his Philadelphia parochial-school accent heading south into storefront-preacher territory . &quot; It ' s our turn_to laugh tonight . This is our house. &quot; Framed by a locker_room full of inspirational slogans ( &quot; I ' m One Mean Trojan -- You ' ll Feel the Pain ! &quot; ) , the 56-year-old USC men ' s basketball_coach is pacing around his seated players , sweat already starting to soil his crisp white turtleneck . A big , voluble man , he ' s pumping up the volume , preaching his pregame sermon as his Trojan team prepares to take_on Arizona State University , a rugged conference rival . &quot; Let ' s get the house rockin ' ! &quot; Raveling hollers , his broad , 6-foot-4-inch frame looming over his players ' heads . &quot; Let ' s get ' em excited ! Let ' s fire this crowd up ! This is our house ! Nobody ' s gonna be laughing and pointing at us ! &quot; The pep talk pays_off . Charged with emotion , USC starts the game off on a 9-0 run . By halftime , the team has a comfortable 41-31 lead , thanks to Lorenzo Orr ' s unerring shooting and Mark Boyd ' s tenacious rebounding . In the locker_room , the team is sky-high , whooping and shouting , stoked on adrenaline . Twenty more minutes of winning basketball and they ' ll be 4-1 in the Pac-10 . It would be a sweet spot for any team , but especially for perennial underdog USC , whose men ' s basketball program has languished for decades in the shadow of UCLA , the colossus that once beat its cross-town rival 19 times in a row . But talk_of a Trojan dynasty will have to wait . USC ' s sizzling first-half play in the Jan . 20 Arizona State game turned_out to be the high-water_mark of the season . Twenty minutes later , at game ' s end , the team was back in the locker_room , heads hanging down , tears welling_up in some of the players ' eyes . Led by a stocky , sharpshooting guard named Stevin ( Hedake ) Smith , Arizona State turned the second_half into a rout , outscoring the Trojans 56 to 21 . With Trojan point guard Burt Harris on the bench with a leg injury , backup guard Damaine Powell was forced to guard Smith . Overmatched , Powell had a dreadful game . Smith made 10 of his final 15 shots , including seven three-pointers , as ASU cruised to victory . In the locker_room after the game , there is stone-cold silence . Slumped in a chair , Powell sits_by himself , the team avoiding him like the plague . Only Mark Boyd , the team ' s senior leader , makes_a_point of coming_over to give him a hug and a hushed pep talk . For several agonizing minutes , Raveling stands_in front of his players , staring at them , rocking on his heels , wrestling with his emotions . Everyone , especially the team ' s freshmen , seems stunned by the finality of the defeat . When Raveling finally speaks , his voice is low and sorrowful , a weary father trying to console his grieving sons . &quot; We had the game right where we wanted it , but we couldn ' t play as a unit , &quot; he says . &quot; We ' re all going_to have to look inside ourselves and see what we can do to improve. &quot; After a quick glance at Powell , the coach continues : &quot; It ' s not gonna do any good to blame one individual . If you want to blame someone , blame Rav . that ' s what I get paid for. &quot; After a tough loss , some coaches scream obscenities , pound lockers and throw chairs at the walls . Others sulk and pout , snapping_at reporters and shooing their players into the showers . But when the team gathered for practice the next morning , Raveling told them how much he believed_in them . Before anyone knew it , tears were streaming down his cheeks . &quot; Coach was very emotional , &quot; Mark Boyd recalls . &quot; He started crying , right in front of us . He said he felt terrible , not because we lost but because only one person had taken the initiative to go_over and talk to Damaine . He knew that if someone else had been the one to have a bad game , Damaine would ' ve been the first to come_over and comfort them. &quot; Boyd falls silent , trying to properly express the moral of this story . &quot; Coach wasn ' t mad about losing , &quot; he says finally . &quot; He was upset that we hadn ' t helped each other out as a team. &quot; ONE OF GEORGE RAVELING ' S FAVORITE QUOTATIONS IS FROM JAMES BALDWIN , who wrote : &quot; These are our children . We will all profit by or pay_for whatever they become. &quot; Every so often , a fortunate son like Harold Miner or Duane Cooper will go_on to play in the NBA . But for most of the coach ' s surrogate children , basketball provides only a momentary glimpse of the spotlight . In Raveling ' s eight years at USC , only four Trojans have played in the NBA . Even Miner , the most successful , doesn ' t start anymore . So far , no one has lasted more_than three years . To Raveling , the lesson is clear . Many of his players will struggle to find another career path . As Raveling likes to say , &quot; Athletes live a life of illusion. &quot; &quot; Winning basketball_games just helps you keep your job , &quot; he says quietly one morning , writing_out defense strategies on a yellow legal pad . &quot; But keeping your job helps you work with these kids about the real challenges of life , which all happen away from the court . I know there ' s an enormous demand around here to win . But I don ' t want someone to ask me what I accomplished in my life and for me to say that I won this amount of games or took a team to some tournament . If at age 56 all I can say is that I taught a kid how to shoot a jump_shot , well , that ' s not good_enough . These kids come_out of underprivileged , inner-city areas , and I ' m just wasting my time if I haven ' t put something of substance into their lives. &quot; USC fans surely applaud these lofty ideals , but they don ' t come_to the Sports Arena to watch the school ' s debating society . Like any coach , Raveling ' s job is to win basketball_games . It ' s an immutable law : Lose enough games and you lose your job . In his tenure at USC , Raveling has shrewdly peddled lowered expectations , positioning the Trojans as scrappy underdogs , an easy task at a school where football has always been the high-profile sport . But this year was supposed to be different . Buoyed by a highly touted class of high_school recruits , Raveling boasted to reporters that his Fab Four Freshmen -- 6-foot-11 center Avondre Jones , 6-foot-4 guard Stais Boseman , 6-foot-3 guard Claude Green and 6-foot-5 swingman Jaha Wilson -- were &quot; as talented as any group I ' ve ever coached. &quot; Expectations began to run high after USC started the season by winning 10 of its first 12 games , even if some of the victories were over such easy_marks as Tennessee-Martin and Sacramento State . Then came the Arizona State debacle . Following that loss , the Trojans found themselves trapped in a horrific downward spiral . They lost eight of nine Pac-10 games , including a blowout at UCLA and an embarrassing defeat at_home against Washington , which was a woeful 3-16 going_into the game . The morning after the UCLA game , the Daily Trojan ran a smart-ass headline that said it all : &quot; USC BLOWS 2-0 LEAD , 101-72. &quot; Each game brought an agonizing new low . With the exception of consistently hard-nosed play from senior forward Mark Boyd and 6-foot-5 junior Tremayne Anchrum -- and some dogged hustle from Stais Boseman -- the team , in a word , stunk . Lorenzo Orr , the team ' s leading scorer , was painfully inconsistent , rarely bothering to play defense . Point guard Burt Harris took bad shots instead of making_good passes . Brandon Martin would sink three straight jumpers , then go cold . When Claude Green launched a three-point shot , fans in the first row ducked -- you never knew what he might hit . Against Stanford , Jones made a quick exit , drawing five fouls in five minutes . Against UCLA , the team was caught with six men on the court . Against Washington , Orr fouled_out without scoring , while Jones and Green sat on the bench in street_clothes , suspended after not showing_up at the hotel the night before . USC would muster a dramatic overtime victory against UC Berkeley -- which twice vanquished UCLA -- late in the season . But largely the Trojans had become Raveling ' s worst nightmare : a team that couldn ' t play as a team . As Boyd dresses in the locker_room after the UCLA game , the team ' s blue-collar leader sounds dispirited . &quot; If I was a coach , I would n ' t recruit one of these high_school All-Americans , &quot; he says disgustedly , applying lotion to his legs and a splash of cologne to his wrists , as if trying to wash the stench of defeat from his limbs . &quot; All you get is ego problems . We ' ve got a lot of immature players , too many guys who don ' t have their heads in the game. &quot; A star forward himself at Villanova , Raveling takes losing hard , too . Nearly every nook of his USC office has a basketball on display , inscribed with the score of one of his big wins as head coach at Washington State , Iowa and now USC . But Raveling recalls the big losses as well . &quot; I ' ve had my heart broke so many times I can ' t even count anymore , &quot; he says the morning after his grim UCLA defeat , eating a losing coach ' s breakfast -- a Coke , two chocolate-chip cookies and three Bufferin . &quot; It never gets any easier . I ' ll know it ' s time to get_out when we play a game like last night and it doesn ' t eat_away at my innards. &quot; Perhaps what makes Raveling different from other coaches is his sense of perspective . After a crushing loss , most coaches spend the next day barricaded in their office , staring at game films . The day after his team lost to Washington , Raveling went_out to see &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; THE PRESSURE TO WIN TAKES ITS TOLL ON COLLEGE COACHES . AFTER A nerve-racking one-point loss last month , Temple Coach John Chaney spun_out of control , screaming and making death threats at opposing Massachusetts Coach John Calipari . Northwestern Coach Ricky Byrdsong had to take a leave_of_absence after he began behaving erratically , leaving his bench in the middle of a game to shake hands with opposing fans in the stands . In January , Georgetown ' s John Thompson charged a referee and was thrown_out of a game . And last December , Indiana ' s volatile Bobby Knight tried to kick his own son , Pat , who ' d thrown the ball away at a crucial moment in a game against Notre Dame . After 32 years in coaching , Raveling has adopted a Zen-like attitude : Winning is temporary , he says , and so is losing . Even after a tough loss , Raveling keeps his cool , always taking a_few minutes to compose himself -- and his team -- before meeting the press for postgame interviews . Maybe some USC fans wish Raveling had a more fiery temperament . After all , Bobby Knight and John Thompson win national championships . Raveling ' s teams have never gone beyond the second round of the NCAA tournament . Yet his supporters say he has plenty to boast about . He took his Washington State team to the NCAA tournament for the first time in nearly 40 years . At Iowa , he won 20 games two years in a row . At USC , he ' s made a weak program respectable , thanks in large part to his recruiting of Harold Miner , a local high_school star who led the Trojans to two consecutive NCAA tournament appearances before turning pro after his junior year . After the 1992 season , when his team went 24-6 , USC rewarded Raveling with a five-year contract extension reportedly worth as much as $ 150 # 000 a year . But when you ' ve never gone_to the Final Four , the question is always asked : How good a coach are you ? &quot; If you asked writers to name the best coaches in the Pac-10 , you would n ' t see George ' s name at the top of the list , &quot; says Bob Cohn , a veteran sportswriter for the Arizona Republic . &quot; He ' s not a great coach in the Bobby Knight-Mike Krzyzewski master-strategist mold . But he ' s got other things going_on in his life , and I think that ' s just as admirable as winning basketball games. &quot; What makes Raveling unusual is the impact he has_on his players away from the court . Miner recently began giving USC back its $ 60 # 000 in scholarship funds and donates free basketball tickets to kids participating in a reading-improvement program . When Duane Cooper , another ex-USC star now in the NBA , is downcast about his lack of playing time , he calls his old college coach for a boost . Always lugging a duffel_bag full of books and magazines on road trips , Raveling concludes practice each morning by giving players a sheaf of clippings from newspapers and magazines . One day it might be a business story about money management or a successful entrepreneur . Another day it ' s an excerpt from a story about former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm , who is quoted as saying : &quot; You don ' t make progress by standing on the sidelines , whimpering and complaining . You make progress by implementing ideas. &quot; Last year , when the team traveled_to Atlanta , Raveling took them to visit the Martin_Luther_King Jr . center . More recently , concerned about his players ' social skills , he conducted an etiquette seminar , staging a practice dinner to give his players lessons in place_settings and handling silverware , then taking them out_to a nice restaurant to hone their skills . &quot; The kids who spend four years with George come_out as better people than they were when they went_in , &quot; says Cohn . &quot; A lot of coaches say that , but with George it ' s not lip_service ; he really has an impact on their lives. &quot; When pressure began to mount on Miner to turn pro , Raveling didn ' t stand_in his way . &quot; He was USC ' s biggest star in years , &quot; recalls Washington Post reporter Mark Asher , who covers off-the-field sports issues . &quot; But George is the kind of coach who ' ll put the best interests of the player ahead of what might be best for George ' s win-loss record. &quot; For many of his players , inner-city kids who ' ve grown_up without fathers , Raveling ' s broad horizons and position of power make him an appealing substitute . Mark Boyd says that when he first arrived_at USC , he couldn ' t take his eyes off his coach . &quot; Never having a father in my house , I just got this immaculate vibe from him , &quot; Boyd recalls . &quot; I ' d watch everything he did , what he ' d say , how he acted with people. &quot; Raveling seems determined to offer his players what he thirsted for in his own youth : a glimpse of the bigger horizon that looms outside the familiar landscape of cheering-crowd arenas . &quot; I wish I could put these kids in a car every week and show them an art museum or take them to Santa Barbara , &quot; he says , walking through campus one day , offering hearty greetings to passersby like a politician on the campaign trail . &quot; These kids are so naive about what life ' s about , &quot; says Raveling , whose own marriage ended in divorce years ago . &quot; As much as my heart aches after losing to UCLA , it aches even more about how little preparation they ' ve had to compete in today ' s society. &quot; Of the 12 players in uniform on most USC road trips , 10 are black and five are from the Los Angeles area . Except for senior guard John Masdea , all are at USC on athletic scholarships . Many grew_up in neighborhoods where sports was considered the only visible avenue for success . &quot; My opportunity -- my escape -- was basketball , &quot; says Boyd , who grew_up in a cramped household where he never had a bed of_his_own . &quot; Almost everybody on our team comes from a low-income , broken household . For us , basketball is a chance to get a college degree , to get somewhere in the world. &quot; Getting the scholarship is just the beginning of a long -- and very public -- struggle . It took Stais Boseman three tries at his SAT tests to earn the minimum 700 score needed to qualify for athletic eligibility . Whenever he appeared on the court against UCLA , the Bruin student section sent up a nasty jeer : &quot; Stu-u-upid ! Stu-u-upid ! &quot; THESE HARDSHIPS ARE CONSTANT REMINDERS OF RAVELING ' S OWN youth . He grew_up in Washington , D.C. , a heavily segregated city . His family lived_on top of a grocery_store in a two-room apartment . They shared a bathroom with four other families on the same floor . Raveling ' s father died when George was 9 , but the son didn ' t see much of the father even when we he was alive . &quot; He was a horse trainer and was away from home most of the year , &quot; Raveling recalls . &quot; Whenever my dad would come_back , he ' d bring me home a silver_dollar . I thought it was the greatest thing in the world. &quot; A talented basketball_player and a diligent student , Raveling went_to Villanova on an athletic scholarship , where he captained the basketball_team in 1960 , his senior year . College had a huge impact on Raveling , who as a young_man was woefully lacking in social skills . &quot; I ' ve always felt_like a sprinter who ' d slipped at the starting box and was 20 yards behind everybody -- I ' ve been in a mad dash to catch_up_with everybody ever since , &quot; he says . &quot; My mom worked two jobs when I was a kid . There were no books in our house . Nobody envisioned that I ' d graduate from college . No one even encouraged me to go_to college. &quot; Raveling has the air of a man making_up for lost time . His Ladera Heights home has a library of 3 # 000 books . At USC , stacks of books lurk everywhere , a literary obstacle course for anyone trying to find a seat in his office . One mound is topped with Richard Reeves ' recent J.F.K. biography , another with &quot; Quotations to Cheer You up When the World Is Getting You Down. &quot; Next door , associate head coach Jack Fertig ' s office has a shelf packed with self-improvement books , all pass-alongs from his boss , each full of passages Raveling has highlighted in yellow ink . Raveling is always soaking_up new facts . Even in the locker_room before a game , he ' s leafing through the New York Times , clipping out a story about a study finding racial disparities in doctors ' warnings to pregnant women ( &quot; These are the kind of things that make me paranoid , &quot; he says wryly ) . Discovering a story in the Los Angeles Times View section about U.S. Presidents , he immediately challenges his two assistants , Fertig and Charles Parker , to a trivia contest . Who can name the four Presidents who were assassinated ? And how about the four who died in office ? Raveling ' s only son , Mark , a USC junior who ' s not on the team , shows_up just as his father ducks back into his office to take a phone_call . &quot; Try those questions on him , &quot; Raveling says to Fertig . &quot; Tell him it ' s worth $ 50 if he gets the right answers. &quot; After about 10 seconds , Fertig hollers into Raveling ' s office : &quot; Your money ' s safe ! &quot; IT IS 5:45 IN THE MORNING . EXCEPT FOR A LONELY STREET-CLEANING truck rumbling down Figueroa Street , the USC campus is deserted . Look_up in the sky and you can see stars . Look inside the North Gym and you can see the men ' s basketball_team practicing for an upcoming game . Nearly every weekday morning the Trojans are here -- yes , at 5:45 -- sprinting , stretching and running plays , hustling through a grueling two-hour practice_session under the coach ' s watchful eye . Claude Green pulls_up for a silky 18-foot jumper but spends so_much time admiring his shot that his man slips past him downcourt for an easy layup . &quot; See that ? &quot; Raveling barks . &quot; You were stylin ' , looking_at how pretty that shot was. &quot; Rav wiggles his hips like a cheerleader , sliding his voice up into falsetto range : &quot; Ooh , what a pretty shot. &quot; Then the bark is back in his voice : &quot; And you got beat on the break. &quot; The 5:45s . They ' re Raveling ' s way of getting his players ' attention before they ' ve struggled with a pop_quiz or had a fight with a girlfriend , or , as Raveling puts it , &quot; before there ' s any garbage in their pail. &quot; All of 21 , Boyd is the team leader , a self-possessed economics major who ' s one of the team ' s last links to the Miner glory years . The freshman players look_to him for advice , impressed by his blue-collar work ethic on the court as well as his stylish dress off the court . To his coach , he ' s a surrogate son . &quot; My mother always said there ' s some people who are 50 going_on 20 , &quot; Raveling notes proudly one day . &quot; And then there ' s people like Mark , who are 20 going_on 50. &quot; Raised by a single working mother in Atlanta , Boyd grew_up in a small two-bedroom house . His mother had one bedroom ; his two sisters had the other . He slept on a couch in the living room . &quot; I never had a bedroom my whole life , &quot; he says . &quot; I was ashamed of where I lived . When my friends wanted to come_home with me from school , I ' d make_up excuses because I didn ' t want them to see I didn ' t have a room. &quot; Boyd says it ' s difficult for him to go_back home and see his old friends -- the ones that are still alive . &quot; Half of them are dead , six feet deep , or in jail or out on the corner selling drugs , &quot; he says matter-of-factly . &quot; I went_home last Christmas and had a friend who got shot dead at a party from a 9-millimeter . Another friend was shooting a gun in the air , and some guys driving by thought he was shooting at them , so they went_after him and shot him with a hollow-point . 44 Magnum . They blew a huge hole in his back. &quot; A true urban youth , Boyd knows the caliber of gun that killed each of his friends . Away from the basketball_court , Boyd is eager to make contact with anyone who has prospered in the outside world . When he found himself seated next to a pair of affluent businessmen at a recent athletic banquet at the tony Jonathan Club , Boyd peppered them with questions about their paths to success . &quot; The UCLA players who were there just sat_down on a couch and didn ' t talk to anyone , &quot; Boyd notes with surprise . &quot; We USC guys were going_around , trying to get_to know everyone . Hey , if you sat_down next to a pair of millionaires , would n ' t you want to know how they got there ? &quot; Boyd takes the same approach at practice . Whether Raveling is teaching rebounding or pick ' n rolls , Boyd is an eager pupil . Many coaches use their best players as a team example . But when the Trojans are lethargic one day , Raveling points to John Masdea , a premed student who is a Division I basketball rarity -- a non-scholarship player . &quot; This guy ain ' t even getting a scholarship , but he ' s come_out here for four years and practiced hard every morning , &quot; Raveling says with fatherly pride . &quot; He ' s gonna be a doctor ; someday he ' s gonna be treating y ' all . But he ' s out here , giving his best . &quot; Do y ' all ever think_about him , practicing hard but not playing ? Sometimes you can ' t just look inside yourself . You gotta look outside yourself , too. &quot; Being_on a team with kids who come from completely different social backgrounds has made Masdea look outside himself , too . On a recent road trip , he roomed with Boseman , a shy freshman from a gang-scarred neighborhood in Inglewood . &quot; It was real surprising , &quot; says Masdea , a clean-cut Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity member who was his high_school ' s valedictorian . &quot; I ' ve played ball with inner-city kids , but I never thought much about their home life . Stais has gone_through so_much adversity -- he didn ' t even know his father , he lived_in an area where there were lots of gangs. &quot; By road trip ' s end , Masdea had invited Boseman to go deep-sea fishing -- a sport he ' d never imagined experiencing -- with some of the SAE guys . And Stais plans to return the favor . &quot; He said , ' Hey , I ' ll take you back to my neighborhood , ' &quot; Masdea laughingly recalls . &quot; And I ' m goin ' -- ' I don ' t know about that. ' &quot; WHEN THE BLACK COACHES ASSN . launched its fight with the NCAA over more minority access to higher education , it quickly decided that George Raveling would serve as its spokesman . A black_man who moves easily in the world of white media and alumni powerbrokers , Raveling has become a lightning_rod for BCA issues , especially when the association threatened a boycott of Jan . 15 basketball_games . This was_after NCAA convention delegates voted_down a proposal to rescind its controversial 13-scholarship limit for men ' s basketball . The boycott was postponed after the NCAA and the black coaches agreed to arbitration by the Justice_Department . But the debate has festered since the opening game of the season , when Raveling and many other African American basketball_coaches staged a symbolic protest , wearing all black to their season openers . While far from the only issue , scholarship opportunities became the hottest topic of debate . When Raveling made his head coaching debut at Washington State in 1972 , he says , each of the nation ' s Division I colleges awarded not 13 but 20 basketball scholarships . With about 70 % of Division I athletic programs losing money -- USC is not one of them -- the NCAA leadership views this as an economic issue . But Raveling sees it as a fight over educational opportunities for young black_men , men like himself . &quot; I had two roommates in college who came under the same circumstances -- athletic scholarships , &quot; he says . &quot; One became a multimillionaire in the greeting-card business . Another became mayor of New Haven. &quot; Raveling contends that to grasp such opportunities , today ' s players must project a positive image . Even after a tough loss , USC players are unusually courteous and cooperative ; no one snarls at reporters . When it comes_to mastering the media , Raveling ' s players need look no further than their coach . Unlike many of his thin-skinned peers who keep the media at arm ' s length , Raveling courts the press , chatting with reporters on the telephone or taking them to dinner on the team ' s road trips . One morning , Raveling spends 20 minutes fencing on the air with Jim Rome , XTRA-AM ' s sharp-tongued sports-talk host . The exchanges sometimes become heated , but when they go_off the air at the end , Raveling gently strokes the talk-show host . &quot; Jim , I gotta tell you , I really respected you for asking me all_the tough questions . I would ' ve been disappointed if you hadn ' t. &quot; These cozy personal touches pay_off . UCLA Coach Jim Harrick has averaged 23 victories in his six-year tenure while Raveling has endured four losing seasons -- and managed only one 20-plus victory season -- in his eight-year USC coaching tenure . Yet , as Shannon Fears , a sportswriter for the Eugene , Ore. , Register-Guard , succinctly put it last year : &quot; It ' s Raveling who is . . . adored by fans , media and his own administration , and Harrick who is considered distant , whining and ungrateful. &quot; Much of this rapport comes from Raveling ' s disarming knack for laughing_at himself , even after a bitter defeat . After USC was routed by UCLA in February , Raveling stood_up before a room full of reporters and took his lumps , never showing any irritation . One writer asked the coach when he felt the game slipping_away . Raveling ' s instant quip : &quot; At the tip. &quot; BUNDLED_UP IN MAROON USC sweats , Lorenzo Orr tentatively sticks his long-limbed 6-foot-7 frame into Raveling ' s office , testing the waters . Coach has discovered that the team ' s star has been late to his meetings with his academic tutor . &quot; Don ' t get_on that girl ' s bad side , &quot; Raveling gently cautions him . &quot; She ' s in your corner . You don ' t want to lose her . You gotta keep up. &quot; Raveling has good reason to worry about his players ' academic status . While recruiting scandals tend to grab the most headlines , many college athletic programs have also been under_fire for lax academic standards , especially for their embarrassingly low graduation rates -- low in some cases meaning zero . From 1986 to 1990 , the first four years of Raveling ' s tenure , only 35 % of USC ' s freshman and junior college-transfer players ended_up earning their degrees . However , if you exclude the players who left school early , either to join the NBA or to play for another college basketball program , the graduation rate jumps to 65 % , virtually the same percentage as USC ' s overall student-body graduation rate . NCAA rules stipulate that to remain eligible to play , athletes must earn 18 credit units ( out of a possible 24 ) after two semesters of school . USC rules also hold that any athlete whose grade-point average drops below 2.0 goes_on automatic probation . Faced with an influx of athletes who are often woefully unprepared for college-level academics , USC built a $ 3-million Academic Resources Center , located in the basement of Heritage Hall , the school ' s athletic program center . Equipped with computer terminals , study rooms and counseling offices , the center serves as a support_system for most of the 290 students on USC athletic scholarships . Once you see Cynthia Cardosi at_work , chairing a weekly tutors meeting , you begin to understand the difficulty of judging academic achievement simply by grade-point average . Wearing a turtleneck and black jeans , the veteran academic counselor is worried about the Trojans ' losing streak . She knows that in times of stress , many young players begin to tune out academics . &quot; The young ones , especially the freshmen , are going_to be down , &quot; she cautions her tutors . &quot; So you have to remind them that they can ' t let their frustrations take_control and stop them from going_to class and studying. &quot; A woman of great zeal and boundless energy , Cardosi prods the tutors , asking if their kids are coming_in prepared and digesting their studies . The tutors are uncharacteristically silent . &quot; God , you ' re really quiet this week , &quot; Cardosi says , studying their faces . She volunteers a positive reaction : &quot; I heard one of our students , a real introverted kid , say : ' Hey , my tutor ' s really cool. ' &quot; Cardosi beams . &quot; I don ' t hear that very often . that ' s a good sign . It means the tutor made an impression on him. &quot; Cardosi doesn ' t wait for the players to seek her out . Last year , when the basketball_team went_to Arizona on a road trip , she traveled with them . She came_away with a renewed appreciation for Raveling ' s impact on his players . &quot; When they were_on the team bus , every one of the coaches was reading a book or a magazine , &quot; she reports . &quot; I think that sets an incredible example for the kids. &quot; That doesn ' t mean Cardosi always sees eye-to-eye with the coaches . &quot; Coach Raveling and I have some matches , &quot; she says spiritedly . &quot; I go_into his office and say what ' s on my mind. &quot; She laughs . &quot; When I come_through his door , he looks_up and goes , ' What now , Cardosi ? ' &quot; Nothing bothers Cardosi more_than a player blowing_off a tutorial appointment in favor of a shoot-around . &quot; The coaches need to understand that these kids feel they have to be at practice , &quot; she says . &quot; So they don ' t always hear the coaches tell them that they can ' t miss a class or a tutor appointment. &quot; Cardosi considers Raveling an ally . &quot; I like the way he deals with his kids , &quot; she says . &quot; We just have different philosophies . To me , basketball is a game . To George , it ' s something bigger. &quot; IT ' S A CLASSIC SNOOP DOGGY Dogg-style rapper ' s voice : a sinewy , singsong tenor skating atop a languid rhythmic groove , joined by a whiny synthesizer that sounds like a snake_charmer ' s flute . The lyrics are half hoops patois , half hip-hop braggadocio . &quot; When I ' m upset , I ' m strong as heck , like Popeye the sailor , I bank you and make you see All-Stars , like Chuck Taylor , a legend like Elgin Baylor , Elizabeth my Taylor , your girl is like a video_game , I like to play her. &quot; Avondre Jones is demonstrating his rap prowess , gyrating his spindly legs , towering over a mountain of sound equipment in his bedroom as he blasts demo tapes of his group 3Wayz ' s songs . &quot; We can go three ways , &quot; explains Jones , whose bedroom is decorated with pictures of Ice_Cube , Charles Barkley , Malcolm X and Avondre himself , the last from a recent issue of Sports Illustrated heralding him as one of the country ' s most promising freshman players . &quot; On the gangsta tip , the smooth stuff or something wild , that you ' d play_at a party. &quot; Still wearing his No . 44 jersey and basketball shorts from a late-afternoon practice , Jones is trying to teach his roomie , fellow Fab 4 Freshman Claude Green , the art of rap deejaying . &quot; Is Claude Green in the house ? &quot; he playfully shouts as he hands the turntables over to his roommate , who nervously fumbles with the controls . Jones is overcome with the giggles . &quot; Amateur ! &quot; he shrieks gleefully . &quot; They ' d kill you out on the dance floor. &quot; For now , Jones ' rap career is sort of on hold , thanks to a stack of arcane NCAA rules about professional contracts . It ' s his basketball career everyone ' s worried about . While Jones ' Artesia High teammate Charles O ' Bannon has blossomed at cross-town rival UCLA , the highly touted Jones has been an enigma , playing sparingly , averaging less than five points a game . Relations with Raveling were rocky , even before he gave Jones a one-game suspension . One week into the season , Jones and his parents had a closed-door meeting with the coach , unhappy over Jones ' lack of playing time . Before the pivotal Arizona State game , Jones came_to see Raveling in his office . They stepped_out into the hall for a private chat -- and within moments were shouting at each other . Jones admits that his game isn ' t up_to par yet . &quot; I know I can play better , &quot; he says , fondling a huge ninja sword that he keeps by his bed . &quot; I ' m just not used to losing . And I ' m not used to sitting . I ' m used to being the go-to man . In high_school , I was the star. &quot; From Raveling ' s perspective , that ' s part of the problem . Ever since the University of Michigan nearly won the 1992 national championship with its heralded Fab Five , incoming freshman have had visions of overnight success on the basketball_court . &quot; The Fab Five was one of the worst things that ever happened to college basketball , &quot; Raveling complains at one of his weekly lunches with local sportswriters . &quot; These kids come_in thinking they ' re gonna win right away . It ' s a problem -- athletes live a life of illusion . What did Avondre say in that Sports Illustrated article ? ' I want to be a point guard. ' Come_on ! &quot; That earns a big laugh from the assembled writers , but Raveling seems genuinely troubled by the naivete of his freshman players . &quot; These kids come_out of an environment where everyone expects instant gratification , &quot; the coach says later . &quot; that ' s what our society preaches every day -- the quick fix. &quot; On the record , Raveling is cautiously optimistic about Avondre ' s progress . But in private , the coach broods about his 19-year-old protege ' s work ethic and level of maturity . At practice , Raveling treats Jones with kid_gloves , often whispering advice in his ear instead of shouting it out across the gym . You get the feeling Raveling hasn ' t gotten his message across yet . &quot; I know basketball is going_to pay_off in the end , &quot; Jones says one night , sorting through his shelves , most of them filled with boxes of high-top sneakers . &quot; But if you came_to me with $ 5 million and said I could have a record contract and I could give_up basketball . . . . &quot; Avondre is silent , staring up at the posters of his heroes , looking first at Barkley , then at Ice_Cube . He wags his head . &quot; Well , I don ' t know what I ' d do. &quot; ONE MORNING , RAVELING IS_ON the phone with Duane Cooper , a talented three-point shooter at USC who ' s now a reserve guard for the Phoenix Suns . Raveling sounds excited . With several of the Suns ' stars out with injuries , Cooper is getting more playing time . Still , the USC grad sounds worried about sticking_with the team . &quot; It ' s like anything else , Coop ; the longer you ' re with ' em , the more respect they ' ll have for the things you can do , &quot; Raveling says , giving him a pep talk . &quot; I know it ' s a cliche , but good things happen to good people. &quot; As Raveling gets_up to leave his office , the phone rings again . It ' s a junior_college coach calling with a tip about a potential recruit . Although recruiting is a big part of Raveling ' s job , it ' s largely an off-season pursuit . So he is only mildly interested until the coach reveals how many points the player scored the night before . &quot; Fifty ! &quot; Raveling exclaims , his interest level rising . &quot; Where ' d you say he ' s playing Saturday ? &quot; As soon as he ' s off the phone , Raveling rushes_off to confer_with his assistant coaches , eager to see what they know about the kid . When he returns , he has an extra bounce in his step . &quot; I don ' t care who you ' re playing , &quot; he says . &quot; Scoring 50 is tough to do. &quot; Suddenly Raveling spins_around and heads back to his assistants ' offices . He forgot to tell them about the earlier phone_call . It ' s a moment when the two sides of his coaching life come_together . He ' s discovered a hot prospect just as a new door is opening for one of his old players . &quot; Hey guys , guess what ? &quot; he booms with paternal pride . &quot; Coop ' s starting tonight ! &quot;</TEXT>
