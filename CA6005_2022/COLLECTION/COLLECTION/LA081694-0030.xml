   <TEXT> &quot; When the general atmosphere is bad , language must suffer , &quot; George Orwell remarked in the politically befouled climate of 1946 , at the dawn of the Cold_War . He delivered himself of this pronouncement in his enduring essay &quot; Politics and the_English Language &quot; three years prior to the founding of the German Democratic Republic and nearly two decades before bricklayers fell to work_on the Berlin Wall , a.k.a. der antifaschistische Schutzwall , or anti-fascist protective wall . But as is almost always true of Orwell , the man was dead right . The contrasting fortunes of written and spoken German in the two successor states to the Third_Reich are more_than proof enough . No sooner did the Wall come_down in 1989 than western and eastern Germans discovered thatthey had developed often ludicrously different ways of communicating during their 40 years of separation . Some differences were minor vocabulary quirks -- each side had come_up with its own word for &quot; grocery_bag , &quot; for instance -- but in many cases the linguistic variations were politically charged , the stuff of two wholly separate ways of looking_at things . Now that the process of German reunification is often proving to be an awkward business for all parties , with easterners resenting the west and vice versa , language is turning_out to be one more factor underlining -- and at times perpetuating -- the national divide . &quot; People in the east want to learn western German , &quot; says Ingrid Kuehn , a scholar of German_language and literature at Martin_Luther University in the eastern city of Halle . &quot; But , of course , they don ' t know all_the words , so they mix things up . They will be talking with a westerner about their ' work team , ' and all_of a sudden they ' ll forget and slip_in the word ' Kollektiv . ' Then the western German will say , ' What kind of weird language do these people speak ? ' &quot; For the past year , Kuehn has been running a hot_line out of her department at the university , where easterners can call and , free_of charge , learn how to get_back onto an even linguistic footing with their western compatriots . Though she takes calls just three days a week , and advertises with simple handbills tacked up_on bulletin_boards , she averages 60 inquiries per week , from people seeking help with everything from letter-writing -- how to close , if you don ' t say &quot; with socialist regards &quot; any more ? -- to the pronunciation of the many English words -- &quot; leasing , &quot; &quot; cash , &quot; &quot; surfboard &quot; -- that have worked their way into western German over 45 years . &quot; People in eastern Germany have had to adopt a whole new system and , with the new system , a whole new vocabulary , &quot; says Kuehn , herself a former citizen of East_Germany , officially known as the German Democratic Republic . &quot; Right now , they don ' t feel comfortable in their own mother_tongue . They don ' t want to go_into a shop and make fools of themselves. &quot; And unfortunately , to western ears , many eastern German words sound just that -- foolish . During the Cold_War , no one in West Germany made any particular effort to shape the language along ideological lines , but in East_Germany the government tried deliberately to write a new socialist lexicon -- and , with it , to nurture a new socialist identity . Much of what the authorities dreamed_up sounds straight out of Orwell ' s &quot; 1984. &quot; The angels that decorate the tops of Christmas_trees , for instance , are called &quot; Christmas angels &quot; in western Germany . But in the east , where angels and Christmas were politically incorrect ? Nothing doing . They were sold in boxes labeled &quot; Year-End Winged Figure. &quot; A flag , likewise , was not a Fahne , or flag , in the GDR , but a Winkelement , or &quot; waving element , &quot; because the authorities used to hand them out before parades and expect people to wave them . Communist agricultural planners even decided to call the lowly cow a Grossvieheinheit , or &quot; large cattle unit. &quot; &quot; They wanted to show that a socialist cow was something special , different from a capitalist cow , &quot; says Siegmar Pfeil , an associate_professor of German_language and literature at Jena University , who like Kuehn has been watching what happens to the language as the former East and West come_together . Pfeil notes that outside the Communist_Party , few East_Germans warmed_to the Newspeak . They could watch Western television and see easily enough that , in the rest of the world , a Christmas angel was still called a Christmas angel . &quot; If they used these words , they did so with a twinkle in their eye , &quot; says Pfeil . And as soon as there was no more Eastern regime to reinforce the new language , the worst barbarisms died quickly . But just because easterners know that certain words are non-starters , Kuehn says , that doesn ' t mean they always know which western words to use . She finds easterners at the greatest loss when it comes_to job-seeking -- a subject of intense interest , with the unofficial eastern German unemployment_rate near 30 % . A job-seeker who lets his easternness show in a carelessly worded letter of application runs_a_risk , Kuehn says , because the west German stereotype is that easterners lack a work ethic . &quot; There is discrimination , &quot; she says . Her callers are often unsure how to describe themselves in terms suitably glowing and self-promoting for the tastes of a western personnel_office . In the old East , after all , no one boasted about being &quot; ambitious , &quot; or a &quot; self-starter. &quot; Even the word &quot; career &quot; had negative connotations . &quot; I can see that some people are trying to avoid using certain words , like ' career , ' because they have difficulties with the values connected with them , &quot; says Kuehn . &quot; They are unable to use them in a neutral way. &quot; Once you have Resume-Speak pretty well down , where to send_off your application ? To the personnel director , of course , but the eastern term for &quot; personnel &quot; is Kader -- a word that sounds , dangerously , as if it has something to do with Marxist cadres . &quot; Yes , that word now has a negative odor , &quot; says Kuehn . She advises her callers to write to the Personalchef . Kuehn says she got the idea of a language hot_line in 1991 , when she went_to a linguists ' conference in the former West Germany and discovered that , on that side of the country , there were phone_services in place to help secretaries , students and others with grammar and style problems . &quot; I thought I should start one in the east , because people here need it so_much more , &quot; she says . In the four years since the east and the west united , Kuehn says , she has seen the linguistic gap start to narrow , but this is almost always because easterners are adopting western words . But here and there , Kuehn and her colleagues are also spotting signs that easterners are resisting the western linguistic Anschluss , and reviving their own unique words . The occasional shop window in the east now carries a sign saying &quot; WtB , &quot; an abbreviation for the eastern term for &quot; general_store &quot; : a signal that made-in-the-east products are for_sale inside . Many easterners now make special efforts to seek_out locally produced goods , just for the sake of solidarity . &quot; Although it ' s not an organized effort , there is definitely a kind of protest going_on , on the part of some people , &quot; says Kuehn . &quot; I see it expressed mainly in letters to the newspapers . People will say things like , ' I will never use this stupid western word cash . I will always say Bargeld . ' &quot;</TEXT>
