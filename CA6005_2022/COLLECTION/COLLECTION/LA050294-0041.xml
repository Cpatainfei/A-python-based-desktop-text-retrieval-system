   <HEADLINE> can ' t COMPETE WITH IMPORTS ? MAKE A ' DUMPING ' CHARGE ; TRADE : CONGRESS AND FEDERAL BUREAUCRATS ARE COMPLIANT IN STACKING RULES AGAINST EXPORTERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If we can ' t compete , then the game must be unfair , or , even worse , someone , probably a foreigner , is cheating . So goes the child-like argument by too many American companies . Complaining to the U.S._government about the unfairness of foreigners has become the single most popular way that American industry seeks protection from imports . And Congress is apparently listening as it prepares to implement the Uruguay Round of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . Listening to congressional testimony , one would have to conclude that the major American GATT issue is to make certain that our ability to wield the anti-dumping club on foreign exporters remains unimpeded . Dumping occurs when a foreign company charges a lower price for a product in an export market that in its home market . When the Department_of_Commerce finds a foreign company guilty of dumping , and the U.S International Trade Commission also concludes that the dumped products injured competing American companies , penalty tariffs are imposed on the imports equal_to the alleged dumping margin . Charges of dumping have become a virtual growth_industry for uncompetitive American firms and their attorneys . But what they deem &quot; dumping &quot; can be nothing more_than pricing differently in different markets . Prices can vary from market to market for all sorts of good economic reasons , fluctuating foreign-exchange rates among them . The complainers ' rhetoric , however , connotes a moral deficiency and sets the tone and characterizes the nature of any discussion of dumping . Demagoguery , however , is only part of this witch ' s brew of trade_policy . What is even more absurd is the way anti-dumping rules are implemented . The methods used to calculate production_costs and &quot; dumping margins &quot; are heavily biased in favor of a U.S.-based petitioner . If a foreign exporter fails to respond quickly to a 100-page English-language questionnaire , Department_of_Commerce bureaucrats are happy to turn_to the alternative &quot; best information available &quot; -- in other words , the petitioning U.S. industry ' s inflated and , more often than not , unchallenged charges . The department can demand an infinite amount of information from an exporter ; any refusal to comply is taken as a confession of guilt , after which the highest possible dumping margin is imposed . U.S. trade_policy separates anti-dumping rules from their only conceivable economic rationale : to stop predatory pricing . In theory , the foreign predator uses profits earned in its protected , high-priced market to finance exports at a below-cost price , eventually driving competition from the market , at which point the predator hopes to reap its unjustly earned rewards . But in reality , policing predatory actions is simply not what U.S anti-dumping regulations do . It is probably safe to say that in not one of the hundreds of affirmative anti-dumping determinations over the past 20 years was predatory pricing remotely present . This is hardly_a secret , since dumping laws are often used for &quot; protecting domestic industries from foreign competition , &quot; as the Council of Economic Advisers concluded in its 1994 report to the President . In succeeding rounds of trade legislation in 1974 , 1979 , 1984 and 1988 , Congress has relentlessly intensified the enforcement of the anti-dumping law with a maze of technical rules . Unchecked , this trend will continue . Under the present U.S. system , the same bureaucrats at the Department_of_Commerce who have the responsibility for investigating the allegations in a dumping petition and for building the administrative record also make the final determination . Commerce is judge , jury , prosecutor , attorney and executioner . The only constraint appears to be that the beneficiary must be a domestic firm and the apparent victim a foreign one . But what goes_around comes_around . In more and more developing countries , U.S. anti-dumping laws are being imitated and then used to bushwhack American exporters . We are coming full circle .</TEXT>
