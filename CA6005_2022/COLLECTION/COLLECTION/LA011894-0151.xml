   <TEXT> A deadly magnitude 6.6 earthquake -- the strongest in modern Los Angeles history -- ripped through the pre-dawn darkness Monday , awakening Southern California with a violent convulsion that flattened freeways , sandwiched buildings , ruptured pipelines and left emergency crews searching desperately for bodies trapped under the rubble . The 10-second temblor , which was not the long-dreaded Big One but erupted so fiercely that it initially seemed every bit as intense , was blamed for at least 33 deaths -- nearly half of which occurred when a three-floor apartment complex near the epicenter in Northridge collapsed into two stories . Triggered by a fault that squeezed the northern San Fernando Valley between two mountain_ranges like a vise , the 4:31 a.m. earthquake swamped hospitals with hundreds of injured victims and left thousands more homeless as fires , floods and landslides dotted a landscape that has been visited by destruction with disturbing regularity . The major developments : * The death toll continued to grow throughout the day . Fifteen bodies were discovered under the rubble of what had been the Northridge Meadows apartments . Other victims of the quake included a Los Angeles police_officer who drove his motorcycle off a sheared-off freeway , a Skid_Row resident who may have hurled himself out the sixth-floor window of a Downtown hotel and a Rancho Cucamonga mother who slipped_on a toy as she raced to check on her child , striking her head on the crib . * In a painstaking rescue , firefighters worked more_than seven hours to save a critically injured maintenance worker who was trapped under 20 tons of concrete that crumbled at the Northridge Fashion Center ' s parking structure . * Highways across Los Angeles County buckled and crumpled , wiping_out major commuter thoroughfares and ensuring that life in this car-dependent region will be disrupted for months . Hardest hit was the Santa Monica Freeway , the nation ' s busiest , which caved_in at the overcrossing of La Cienega Boulevard , and the Antelope Valley Freeway , which collapsed at its junction with the Golden State Freeway in the Newhall pass . * Ruptured gas_lines and propane tanks sent fiery balls bursting through asphalt roads , engulfing up_to 100 mobile_homes at three San Fernando Valley trailer_parks . Meanwhile , a broken water_main on Balboa Boulevard shattered 100 square_feet of pavement , turning the street into a geyser . * The temblor , felt as far as Oregon and the Mexican border , left tens of thousands of residents without power , gas or phone_service . In the historic Ventura County community of Fillmore , where brick facades had undergone extensive earthquake renovation in recent years , virtually every downtown business was damaged . * Late in the day , Mayor Richard Riordan initiated a citywide curfew , making_it illegal for people to remain on the streets between dusk and dawn . President Clinton pledged immediate federal assistance while the National_Guard was mobilized to prevent looting in blacked-out neighborhoods . Gov . Pete Wison , touring the area in a helicopter , said : &quot; You begin to wonder how much Angelenos are expected to take. &quot; * Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi , touring areas hit hardest by the earthquake , predicted that local authorities will proclaim many older apartments uninhabitable . He said thousands or tens of thousands of Los Angeles residents may be made homeless . Had the quake not struck on a holiday , or if it had begun a_few hours later , seismologists fear , the damage would have been far more devastating . Even so , Southern California seemed to shudder to a terrifying halt Monday , a day of frantic waiting , dramatic rescues , empty highways and fraying nerves . &quot; It was a 6.5 on the ' Richter scale , ' but a 10 on my fear scale , &quot; said Nick Stevens , 40 , an Australian tourist staying_at the Hollywood Downtowner Motel . &quot; We had been planning to go_to Universal Studios , where they have the earthquake ride . Now we won ' t have to bother. &quot; ' It Was Unreal ' Across the smoky expanses near the quake ' s epicenter , the scene was nearly apocalyptic . Buildings were left in crumpled heaps . Balls_of_fire tore through mobile_home parks . Geysers gushed out of asphalt streets . For the first time in Los Angeles ' history , officials said , all_the city ' s lights went_out at once . After touring his northwest Valley district , which suffered some of the most severe damage , Councilman Hal Bernson said : &quot; If you saw Northridge Fashion Center or Balboa Boulevard , you ' d think you were in Beirut. &quot; At least six people fell victim to quake-induced heart_attacks . The rest were killed by the temblor and the chaos it induced . A 25-year-old Sherman Oaks man was electrocuted , a 92-year-old Northridge woman died when her trailer burned , a 4-year-old child was crushed by the wreckage of her collapsing home and a veteran LAPD traffic officer plummeted from a freeway overpass when his motorcycle skidded out of control on a buckled swath of the Antelope Valley Freeway . &quot; His lights were still flashing and he just came tumbling down , &quot; said Andy Jimenez , 33 , of Santa Clarita , who watched as Officer Clarence Wayne Dean , 46 , plunged off the end of a destroyed bridge to the pavement 30 feet below . &quot; It was unreal. &quot; The quake struck with such sudden force that many residents stumbled around dazed in the darkness , groping for shoes , eyeglasses , a flashlight . At the Park Regency apartment complex in Canoga Park , a two-story apartment_building collapsed and crushed a row of 20 cars_parked underneath . Rita Cuezada , 20 , and her 5-month-old daughter fell_through their second-floor apartment to a vacant unit below . &quot; My body_weight fell on her three or four times , &quot; Cuezada said . &quot; I thought she was going_to die . I was just praying to God . I thought I was just going_to be holding her dead_body when it was over. &quot; In some areas , the earthquake set_off a series of other destructive disasters , bursting water_mains , touching_off fires and sending rocks and mud sliding . Near Chatsworth , a Southern Pacific train derailed and one of 16 cars carrying sulfuric_acid spilled its load . Los Angeles International Airport was forced to temporarily suspend flights . Mobile_home parks , with their lightweight construction and often-crowded layouts , proved particularly vulnerable to fires . At the Tahitian Mobile Park in Sylmar , firefighters watched helplessly as 65 mobile_homes went_up in flames . Gilbert Neuvenhein was jarred from his sleep by the earthquake and watched helplessly as fires crept near his trailer . &quot; I woke_up . There was a rumbling . The next thing I knew I was trying to reach the door , &quot; he said . &quot; I was frantically trying to open it , but it was stuck . I didn ' t have my glasses and I was practically blind without them. &quot; As flames engulfed the trailers , ammunition stored in one of them began to explode . &quot; I had never seen such a war zone , &quot; said Keith Bedard , a 32-year-old communication technician . All along Ventura Boulevard , meanwhile , firefighters and Southern California Gas Co . workers were hurrying to plug leaky gas_mains . About 7 a.m. a fire crew saw a major leak at Ventura Boulevard and Laurel Grove and urged bystanders to move_on : &quot; You ' ll be toast if this thing goes_up , &quot; a firefighter said . In Pacoima , thousands of gallons of crude_oil spilled into Wolfskill Street east of Laurel Canyon Boulevard when a 10-inch pipeline burst . Soon after , the oil ignited , sending parallel walls of flame racing down the block . The flames consumed two houses and at least 10 cars and scorched dozens of trees along the street . Residents frantically used garden_hoses to spray down cars and shake roofs . Several rooftops were burned . &quot; It just looked_like an inferno , &quot; resident Luisa Grimaldo said . &quot; It came just shoosh down both sides . It all just exploded. &quot; Although the worst damage was in the Valley , other communities were also struggling to dig_out from the wreckage . On the Santa Monica Freeway , seven massive pillars that suspended the freeway over Fairfax Avenue collapsed . The concrete cylinders broke_into pieces ranging_in size from boulder-like chunks to grains of sand . Their iron reinforcing bars loomed like immense , distended bird cages . Several buildings in Santa Monica collapsed , others suffered major damage and 12 fires and dozens of gas leaks were reported . In all , 75 buildings were deemed unsafe for habitation by midafternoon -- including two large hotels , the Pacific Shores and Holiday Inn Bayview Plaza . Ignoring the yellow &quot; caution &quot; tape ringing the Sea Castle , a large 70-year-old waterfront apartment_building , residents scurried back and forth into the structure to grab whatever belongings they could carry . By 9 a.m the parking_lot looked ready for a garage sale as residents tried to cram television_sets , microwave_ovens and mattresses into their cars . At Angelo Drive and Mossy Rock Circle on the Westside , the Cooper family sat on their front lawn with their children , Harrison , 4 , and Jennifer , 1 , as they made plans to go_to a hotel . The vigorous shaking had caused the front of their house to collapse . As the quake hit , Michelle Cooper rushed in to pick her daughter up from her crib , where she discovered the baby had stopped breathing . &quot; I said , ' She ' s dead , she ' s dead , &quot; Cooper said . &quot; My husband revived her with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . He said she had something called fright reaction . Usually , I ' m OK after an earthquake , but I was shaking because I thought she was dead. &quot; In Ventura County , the cities of Simi Valley and Fillmore suffered the most serious damage . At one Fillmore variety store , mannequins were thrown through a plate-glass window and landed in a gruesome pile on the sidewalk . At the Central Market , owner Harnek Sing Behniwal stared at the broken windows , fallen beams and strewn groceries . &quot; I just don ' t know what to do , &quot; he said . &quot; This store was a diamond. &quot; City officials were particularly upset because the area had recently undergone extensive renovation . &quot; Just when we ' ve rebuilt it , we ' ve had to declare it a disaster_area , &quot; Fillmore City_Manager Roy Payne said . In Simi Valley , across the street from Simi Valley Adventist Hospital , Ted N . Chaffee , a dentist , was perturbed by the earthquake ' s seemingly precise aim . Only one of his office windows shattered -- the one above his his most expensive piece of equipment , a $ 50 # 000 dental imaging system . ' Come Down and Pray ' Throughout Los Angeles , there were tales of courage -- of strangers helping strangers because , as one man said , &quot; it seemed like the right thing to do. &quot; By day ' s end , many people owed their lives to that spirit . And many_more had been touched by it , as they watched the progress of several daring rescue missions live_on television . Salvador Pena ' s story was one of the hopeful ones -- a testament to the power of hard work , teamwork and spiritual faith . Caught during his pre-dawn shift driving a street_sweeper along the bottom floor of a three-tier parking garage at the Northridge Fashion Center , Pena talked with rescue workers for more_than seven hours as they blasted through slabs of concrete to extricate him . Firefighters had little trouble locating him because of his loud cries_for help , which they could hear even through the mountain of rubble . To reach Pena , rescue workers used jackhammers to drill through two layers of concrete . Then they inserted air_bags and wooden blocks to lift a concrete beam off his limbs , giving him oxygen as they worked . Once they cut him out of his vehicle , they carried him on a backboard through eight feet of rubble . Throughout the ordeal , paramedics remained at Pena ' s side beneath the parking deck . &quot; He was in a lot of pain and he kept saying , ' Come_down and pray with me , come_down and pray , &quot; said Rey Lavalle , a Los Angeles city firefighter , who spoke with Pena in Spanish . When a helicopter finally airlifted Pena from the busy mall ' s rubble-strewn parking_lot and headed to UCLA Medical_Center , onlookers cheered and applauded . Late Monday , he was in serious condition with crushed legs and a partially dislocated spine . &quot; I almost cried -- I was elated , we all were , &quot; Capt . Jim Vandell of the Los Angeles City Fire_Department said . Meanwhile , at the Northridge Meadows apartments , firefighters and urban search and rescue squads hunted frantically for survivors of the collapse that took more lives than any other . The three-story complex had folded in on itself , pulverizing many of the first-floor units . All day , rescuers worked tirelessly . They were right to hope . At one point , as firefighters tramped through the demolished building pounding on floors and calling_out to survivors , they heard a man cry_out . Using diamond-bladed saws to chew through concrete and wood , they finally reached the collapsed first_floor that had become a tomb . Alan Hemsath , 37 , &quot; was just face down -- pinned by the whole building , &quot; rescue worker Doug Rogers said . But 90 minutes later , Hemsath -- conscious and in stable condition -- was freed , prompting applause from onlookers and journalists . The search continued until nightfall , with rescue workers utilizing sonar equipment sensitive enough to detect even the shallowest breath amid the rubble . Those who had died were left inside the building so rescuers could concentrate_on extricating survivors . ' A Tidal Wave ' of Injuries The quake took its toll on the young and old , hundreds of whom flooded emergency_rooms with maladies ranging from cuts and bruises to heart_attacks . &quot; We ' ve seen heart_attacks , dislocated bones , lacerations . A lot of blood , &quot; said Toni Regalado , an emergency_room admissions officer at Holy Cross Medical_Center in Sylmar . In Los Angeles , Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center was receiving &quot; a tidal_wave of walking wounded , &quot; spokesman Ron Wise said . Hospital officials said most of the injuries were caused by people scrambling to protect themselves after the quake struck . Health workers said many cuts , bruises and broken bones resulted when people , in their need to find safety , fell , cut themselves on broken glass , or ran_into something in the dark . In some hospitals , doctors and nurses moved past fallen plaster and broken windows to practice their trade_in near-battlefield conditions . Broken water_pipes flooded floors , backup generators took_over during electrical outages . Ham radios covered_for dead telephones . Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia treated more_than 300 people , mostly for cuts and broken bones . The hospital was so jammed that some patients had to wait for up_to four hours . People were being stitched up_on stretchers in the hall . The doctors at Henry Mayo were slightly red-eyed . Iodine was_on the floor , spilled off wounds where it had been liberally applied . &quot; People are running_on adrenaline , &quot; said Henry Mayo Administrator Duffy Watson . &quot; We are overwhelmed . We need to get our staff rested. &quot; At the Granada Hills Community Hospital , doctors , nurses and volunteers operated a makeshift emergency_room in the shadow of the Kaiser Permanente clinic and office_building which collapsed next door . With heads bandaged and blackened blotted blood dried around their cuts , quake victims sat in the sun waiting . Meanwhile , a cadre of workers applied temporary bandages and tried to ease their pain . Brian Wills , 23 , of Canoga Park was among those waiting . He suffered a deep cut on his shoulder climbing out his first-floor apartment window . &quot; I jumped_out and started running_down the street . . . . I definitely panicked , &quot; he said . An unprecedented 600 to 700 patients were evacuated from earthquake-damaged hospitals . Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses and helicopters were pressed into duty to shuttle patients out of the crippled hospitals . The largest evacuation occurred at Olive View Medical_Center , where all_the patients in the 377-bed hospital were transferred because of serious water damage , gas leaks and power outages . The hospital was built_on the same site where another county hospital was destroyed in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake . Dozens of other hospitals in the area also suffered enough damage to force evacuations or to prompt officials to move patients in large_numbers from one floor to another . Among the hospitals forced to close were Holy Cross Hospital Medical_Center in Sylmar and the Sepulveda Veterans Administration Hospital in North Hills . But it was not all tragedy . A Torrance woman was in the final moments of giving_birth early Monday when her room at Torrance Memorial Medical_Center began shaking . Wendy Gonzales , 37 , gripped her husband ' s hand hard as the walls shook , medical supplies clattered to the floor and her daughter ' s head began to emerge from the birth_canal . &quot; It all happened at_the_same_time , &quot; said her husband , Eddie Gonzales , 35 . &quot; Everything started shaking , things started falling . . . . I heard a lot of rattling going_on , and a lot of screaming. &quot; Courtney Gonzales , 7 pounds , 6 1 / 2 ounces , was born at Torrance Memorial Medical_Center at 4:45 a.m. ' Holding My Heart ' Farther from the epicenter , where the shaking was less severe , emotional trauma eclipsed physical danger . The quake left people disoriented , bewildered and , in the case of one young_man , literally dazed . John Bryce , 16 , was hit in the head by a 32-inch television as he slept on the floor of a friend ' s Simi Valley home . &quot; It just fell on my head and knocked me out , &quot; Bryce said as he waited for a gash above his nose to be stitched . &quot; When I woke_up , there was a television in my lap. &quot; But with humor , creativity and a little homespun philosophy , people set_about trying to cope . Life would go_on , they said . And maybe next time they ' d be a little better prepared . &quot; I never liked the bathroom anyway , &quot; said a 38-year-old Sherman Oaks banker after a neighbor ' s chimney toppled into his bidet . Jon Lalanne , a 32-year-old bartender in Malibu , is now calling his apartment on Las Flores Canyon Road simply &quot; the disaster capital of the world. &quot; &quot; My whole apartment_building was doing the hula , &quot; he said , demonstrating with his hand the undulating motion he saw and felt . His biggest complaint , however , was gastronomical , not geological . &quot; I ' m dying for a cup of coffee , man , and there ' s none to be had , &quot; he said . Many people sought comfort in numbers . In Santa Monica , residents transformed the median of San Vicente Boulevard from its usual function -- a jogging path -- to a makeshift meeting_place and parking_lot . From 7th Street to the ocean , the grassy strip resembled a pre-dawn block party as apartment dwellers -- some still in robes , others wrapped in blankets -- gathered to compare jolt notes . Fearful that underground garages would collapse , some people left their cars in the median as well . Necessity also brought people together . In Malibu , people waited in_line to buy bottled water , Rice Krispies , London broil -- whatever was available . In eastern Ventura County , lines at hardware and general supply stores stretched_out the door as jittery residents stocked up_on flashlights , batteries , and repair materials for broken pipes and generators . &quot; Someone came_by my house and said Sears was open , and it ' s a good thing , &quot; Dirk White , 36 , a_Thousand Oaks resident , said as he waited to buy repair materials at Sears department_store . &quot; My hot water_heater busted . Where ( else ) do you get parts for that at a time like this ? &quot; Joan Tang of Camarillo was standing in a similarly lengthy line to buy a better radio than the small transistor model she had at_home . The earthquake had scared her , she said , and had taught her a lesson . &quot; It took me three hours to calm_down , &quot; Tang said . &quot; I need to be prepared . It took an earthquake like this to finally admit it . I was holding onto my heart. &quot; Sleeping Under the Stars Haunted by memories of what the previous night had brought , a nervous city greeted Monday ' s sunset with one eye open . As the ground rolled and rocked with aftershocks -- 86 of them in the first 17 hours after the quake -- it was difficult to believe the truth : that the worst was most likely over . Floods , fires , riots -- Los Angeles had survived them all . But this felt more fundamentally unsettling than anything that had come_before . So , while curfews were put_in place to make neighborhoods relatively free from crime , no one was taking their safety for granted . Long before nightfall , the displaced and the distressed flocked to shelters or the streets , planning to sleep on gymnasium floors or back seats of family sedans . Many simply camped_out in their yards . In Koreatown and Pico-Union , where many residents spent the day on porches and lawns , there were no plans to return indoors after dark . &quot; We ' re going to sleep outside tonight , &quot; said Pilar Canela , 10 , who lives with his family in a Koreatown apartment . &quot; It ' s kind of dangerous to do that , but we ' re more scared of another earthquake. &quot; In the Santa Clarita Valley , about 150 people gathered on the green cots at a Red_Cross evacuation center set_up in the gloomy , unlighted gymnasium of Henry Newhall Park . Most had been evacuated from the Orchard Arms Senior Complex , a residential development that developed a gas leak . Outside , the scene was almost festive as about 500 Latino families set_up camp with tents and barbecues . Ricardo Provincia , 23 , set_up three tents to house the 14 members of his extended family through the night . &quot; There are cracks all_over our apartment , which is_on the second story , &quot; Provincia said . &quot; It ' s scary in there . We thought we ' d be a lot safer here , tonight. &quot; For some , like Poppy Weisberg , sleep would be difficult anywhere . Weisberg , 79 , was among 150 people who sought shelter at Sylmar High_School , where the Red_Cross had set_up a shelter . She sat in a flowered nightgown on a borrowed cot and recounted how she had come_to be there . Weisberg had narrowly escaped injury when her mobile_home in the Los Olivos mobile_home park burned . If not for her neighbors , who pulled her through her mobile_home ' s front_door , she might not have survived , she said . &quot; You could hear the gas and I kept yelling , ' Turn_off my gas ! ' &quot; she said . But it was too late . After her mobile_home and others went_up in flames , she returned to see what was left . &quot; It took a lot for me to go_back and see what the damage was , &quot; she said , choking_back tears . Quake Coverage * IMMIGRANTS ' TERROR : Falling bricks , shattering glass and haunting memories sent many residents of the city ' s crowded immigrant neighborhoods into the streets . For thousands of them , at least one of the old_country ' s terrors had come_to join them in the new . A3 * AT THE EPICENTER : Northridge was the scene of more_than half the fatalities , wholesale devastation and several miracle rescues . A8 * ECONOMIC IMPACT : The earthquake dealt a blow to the Southland ' s already struggling economy . D1 * Related stories : A3-20 , 22 , 24-25 , Section B</TEXT>
