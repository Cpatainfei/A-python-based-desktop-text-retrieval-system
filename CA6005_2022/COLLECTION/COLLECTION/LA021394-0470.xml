   <HEADLINE> THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE ; THE ECONOMY ; RESIDENTS WHO FLINCHED AT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT DURING BOOM TIMES WILL HAVE TO WEIGH THEIR VIEWS ANEW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It wasn ' t so_long ago that Southern Californians took their economy for granted . Sure , it was young and a little wild -- but it performed the most amazing feats . Who thought the mid-life crisis would hit so soon ? &quot; We ' ve got_to do an agonizing rethinking , &quot; declares Larry Kimbell , director of economic forecasting at UCLA . &quot; What are the trade-offs , and where do they lie ? &quot; The climate that created prosperity wasn ' t just 72-degree sunshine . It was a rough-and-tumble landscape peopled by deal-making , hustling individualists . They thrived in exquisite independence , aloof to each other and unbridled by bureaucracy . Now , the rules are going_to change , because of forces bigger than any natural disaster . A bonafide economic rebirth , creating wealth and opportunity for millions of Californians , will require interdependence , a radical credo for the nation ' s most fragmented society . Recovery alone -- and the date is uncertain -- will not mean economic salvation , most economists believe . That is a troubling , new state of affairs . Jobs will continue to be scarce and lenders wary . It will take years for property values to regain their past heights . Employers may continue to eye locations to the north or out of state . Disaster news doesn ' t help . Yet the ingredients of renewal -- ideas , energy , people and investment dollars -- are here right now , and they are bountiful . The trick is stirring them together in creative new ways , a trick that will mean tough , new choices for residents , business people and public officials . Business_leaders who wish for a revitalized , more unified city may have to donate their own time and effort to neighborhoods , working with schools , clinics , anti-crime programs , you name it . Longtime Californians might learn lessons from newer immigrant communities if they can blend together more successfully . The Korean kye and Chinese hui are communal credit schemes that free up cash for fledgling enterprises , the sort that displaced aerospace employees might dream of launching . Residents who flinched at growth and development during boom times will have to weigh their views anew in an era of stubborn unemployment and chronic fiscal crisis . Advocates of environmental regulation may consider how ill-conceived rules , red-tape snafus and insensitive bureaucracies can chase out new investment . Hovering over all_of these issues is the confusing matter of government ' s role in the economy . Neither knee-jerk dismissals of government nor naive faith in the bureaucracy will suffice . Already , hard-pressed local_governments are wooing employers with special tax deals and other incentives . Yet these measures can anger existing employers and , ultimately , are of questionable value , researchers say . Even enterprise_zones , touted as a way to revitalize the inner_city through financial incentives for employers , have a mixed track record . On the plus side , a public-private consortium , fueled with federal funds , has taken the lead in promoting an electric_car industry -- an uncertain if commendable quest . Experimental public-sector efforts to finance new technologies and provide technical assistance all will be_on the table . Yes , it ' s time for soul-searching . But the exercise should neither ignore Southern California ' s strengths nor fail to recognize the many promising efforts already under way . The immigrant population , however controversial and costly for now , is also a source of energy and enterprise . The manufacturing base , while embattled , still employs almost 18 % of Los Angeles County workers , a bigger share than in the state or nation . The region ' s role as a key hub in the global economy must surely expand . Even the much-maligned business climate has improved a bit , due_to recent tax incentives , changes in workers compensation and other efforts . No one knows what tomorrow ' s great new industry will be . But if it has anything to do with entertainment , technology or information , Angelenos will be at the forefront , exploiting talent and know-how in their own back yard . Just a_few weeks ago , amid a numbing barrage of negative news about the city , an economic development official was marveling at renewed interest in Los Angeles by more_than 20 potential employers . &quot; We were just sitting around and saying , ' Holy mackerel . What ' s going_on here ? ' &quot; recalls Jack Kyser , chief economist with the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp . Common_sense suggests that whatever inherent appeal attracted those employers to Los Angeles will last longer than today ' s earthquake woes . But it also suggests the days of rugged_individualism are gone forever . JONATHAN PETERSON</TEXT>
