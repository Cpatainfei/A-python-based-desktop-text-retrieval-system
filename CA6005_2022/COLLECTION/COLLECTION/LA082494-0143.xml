   <HEADLINE> SEC CALLS FOR CRACKDOWN ON STOCKBROKERS ; WALL_STREET : AGENCY LETTERS URGING THAT THE EXCHANGES REVIEW THEIR POLICIES ARE A FIRST_STEP TOWARD TOUGHER ACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken the first_step toward directing the nation ' s stock_exchanges to impose harsher penalties and otherwise crack_down on dishonest brokers at major Wall_Street firms . In letters dated Aug . 4 , copies of which were obtained Tuesday by The Times , the SEC urged the exchanges &quot; to review and , if necessary , enhance sanctions &quot; against brokerage employees who engage in improper sales practices . The letters went_to the heads of the New York Stock_Exchange ; the National Assn . of Securities Dealers , which operates the Nasdaq Stock_Market , and seven other exchanges . Signed by the SEC ' s directors of market regulation and enforcement , the letters also called_on the exchanges to make more frequent , detailed examinations of member firms for evidence of sales practice violations . These illegal practices include making trades that customers never requested , churning accounts by rapidly buying and selling securities to boost brokerage commissions , and putting customers into unsuitably risky investments . The SEC also asked the exchanges to put more effort into investigating reports of such violations made in customer arbitration cases . In May , the agency found that the exchanges were not doing enough to follow_up_on these complaints . Other recommendations in the letters include new , stiff punishment of firms that don ' t comply with rules requiring them to promptly report to the exchanges disciplinary problems and customer complaints against their brokers . The NASD and the stock_exchanges are &quot; self-regulatory organizations &quot; that have the power and responsibility to discipline member firms and their brokers for violations of securities rules . The SEC has long left most enforcement of sales practice rules to these organizations . After nearly two years of study , the SEC reported in May that some leading brokerages had failed to weed out employees with long records of defrauding customers . The agency said it had launched disciplinary cases involving a quarter of the 161 brokerage branch offices it examined as part of the study . Three major firms were reported to have especially bad records , but the SEC refuses to name them . The study was launched in response to a 1992 series of stories in The Times that found that brokerage_firms , the exchanges and the SEC were lax in protecting small investors from rogue brokers . Michael Schlein , counsel to SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. , on Tuesday described the report and recommendations as &quot; pretty hard-hitting , and we ' re following up_to make_sure that they get implemented. &quot; The SEC asked that the exchanges respond by Monday . A NYSE spokesman said the exchange has not yet replied to the SEC ' s letter , and an NASD spokesman said senior officials were traveling Tuesday and could not be reached for comment . Separately , the NASD announced proposed rules that would ban brokers from taking free travel and other gifts from outside firms whose mutual_funds or variable annuity contracts they sell . NASD officials said they had no evidence of abuses by mutual_fund or insurance_firms , but they said they wanted to eliminate even the possible appearance of abuse . The proposed rules would not ban brokerages from giving their own brokers gifts for selling in-house products , such_as the firms ' own mutual_funds . A special SEC committee is already studying broker pay issues .</TEXT>
