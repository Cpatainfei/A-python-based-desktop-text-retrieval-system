   <HEADLINE> LOCAL ELECTIONS ; PROPOSITION 187 ; STUDENT RALLY IN OXNARD ENDS AT PARK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An anti-Proposition 187 walkout involving 150 students from Oxnard High_School and various other middle_schools began chaotically Friday when some demonstrators threw apples and ran from police , but ended peacefully with an impassioned speech at Oxnard ' s Plaza Park . Meanwhile , about 500 students at Channel Islands High_School opted to protest the ballot measure after class by marching around the block with Polynesian-style dancers , a mariachi band and Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez in a rally sponsored by school administrators . Across the county at Moorpark High , about 50 students gathered_in a classroom at lunchtime to devise ways of encouraging adults to vote against 187 while a smaller group marched around the cafeteria , shouting their opposition to the measure . The Oxnard walkout started when a group of about 40 students -- some from Frank and Fremont middle_schools -- marched from Plaza Park to Oxnard High_School about 10 a.m. and persuaded about 400 Oxnard High students to scale the schoolyard fence or exit through an open gate to join their procession . Most quickly returned to class , however , and only about 100 joined the march , police said . The students then proceeded to march several miles through Oxnard to Hueneme High , Channel Islands High and Oxnard College , but were mostly unsuccessful in their attempts to lure their peers to leave class and join the demonstration . After resting and drinking some water at College Park they made their way to Plaza Park and dispersed . &quot; People have put us down for leaving school , &quot; said Janette Cordova , 16 , of Oxnard High . &quot; But I ' m fighting for the right of people to get an education , to stay in school . This is the only way people will listen. &quot; * The march was unruly during its start , as students hurled apples , rocks , and in at least one case a bottle at police_cars and passersby . Protesters also lacked a planned route and ran from police several times , scattering across the streets of downtown Oxnard . Three juveniles were arrested for throwing rocks at police during the protest , said Oxnard Police Sgt . Frank Porter . Two of the teen-agers were taken_to Juvenile Hall on suspicion of assault , and the third was taken_to the Oxnard Police_Station and later released . In the midst of the protest , a police motorcycle and a squad_car collided while trying to keep the students in_order near C Street , said Officer Don Mulville . No one was injured and neither vehicle was seriously damaged . As the march gained momentum , the protesters calmed_down -- or wore_down -- and by the end of the demonstration were marching in a neat file under the leadership of a handful of Oxnard College_students who joined midway . &quot; We ' re just trying to prove that we ' re united , &quot; said Oxnard College_student Demetrio Silva , 34 . &quot; We ' re not being violent . We live under a society of oppression and we ' ve been saying ' Yes , sir , ' and ' Yes , ma ' am ' for too long. &quot; Responding to earlier threats of looting , however , police around noon established a cordon of at least two_dozen officers in riot gear around the Amar Ranch Food Warehouse . &quot; Some students said they ' d rush the store and ransack it , &quot; said Cmdr . Jamie Skeeters . &quot; We asked the manager to shut the store down for a_few minutes till they disperse. &quot; * After more_than three hours of marching , the tired students sat_down to rest in Plaza Park , but police told them to disperse and go_home or return to school . Before obeying the orders , however , the group , which had dwindled to about 75 , remained still while Silva told them to stand_up for their rights . &quot; They ' re playing with us , they ' re manipulating us , &quot; Silva exhorted the crowd . &quot; First they want us , then they don ' t. &quot; He told the students that Proposition 187 was the latest episode in a long history of exploitation against Latinos . &quot; They ' re targeting our people , &quot; Silva said . &quot; . . . They founded their land on rape and pillaging. &quot; After the march , the students quietly left the park and returned to school or went_home . The police presence was light compared to a much larger protest last week in Oxnard , where about 1 # 500 students gathered at the park for an anti-Proposition 187 rally . But some students warned that if the proposition passes Tuesday , there will be trouble in Ventura County . &quot; I think it ' s going_to be a war , &quot; said Ilma Becerra , 15 , of Oxnard High . &quot; Mexicans and whites are not going_to get along. &quot; * By contrast , the demonstration at Channel Islands High at times strayed from the anti-Proposition 187 theme into a broader celebration of cultural differences . Held at the school ' s football_stadium at the end of the school_day , the rally was planned by student leaders and school officials seeking to avoid student walkouts . Students insisted on marching , however -- so they marched around the block . On the way , students chanted &quot; No on 187 , &quot; but they were drowned_out by mariachi music and overshadowed by the Polynesian-style dancers . Nevertheless , participating students at the school said the event had been an educational experience for them . &quot; I found_out it wasn ' t just ( targeting ) Mexicans but all illegal immigrants , &quot; said Blane Saipaia , a junior . Although most of the students who attended were Latino , student organizers said they tried hard to make the event multicultural to attract different student groups . &quot; We publicized it in every class , &quot; said Dung Hoang , president of the school ' s student government . &quot; This is a humanity issue . If you ' re an immigrant , this is about you. &quot; * Meanwhile , about 40 students at Chaparral Middle_School threatened to walk_off campus Friday morning to protest Proposition 187 , but were talked_out_of it by school administrators and instead spent their lunch hour making placards for an after-school walkout . The students then marched peacefully to Moorpark City_Hall at the end of the school_day . &quot; We ' re trying to get people not to vote for Prop . 187 because it ' s going_to cause problems , &quot; said Ramiro Gonzales , 13 . &quot; People are going_to be out_in the streets. &quot; And at Moorpark High_School , a small group of students marched around the campus shouting anti-187 slogans at lunchtime while about 50 of their peers met in a classroom and discussed ways of persuading those who can vote to oppose the measure . One student who was eating lunch was punched_in the mouth by a protester , school officials said , but the small march was otherwise peaceful . Principal Cary Dritz said there was a potential for greater violence during the brief demonstration . &quot; It created a situation where kids were taking sides , &quot; he said . The student was not seriously injured , and the protester who hit him escaped into the crowd , Dritz said . Times staff writer Mack Reed and correspondents Maia Davis , Julie Fields and Tracy Wilson contributed to this report .</TEXT>
