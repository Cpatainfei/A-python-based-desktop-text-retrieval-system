   <HEADLINE> LAWMAKER ' S FUNERAL SPOTLIGHTS RUSSIA CRIME ; VIOLENCE : COMMUNIST DEPUTY DIED AFTER BEING MUGGED . HE IS THE SECOND MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT THIS YEAR TO BE SLAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With tearful outbursts against the erosion of legal order , colleagues and kin buried legislator Valentin S . Martemyanov on Wednesday in a politically charged goodby to one of Russia ' s best-known mugging victims . &quot; He did all he could in his life to establish legality . Now let the people in power do something about it ! &quot; declared Ivan B . Rybkin , chairman of the lower house of Parliament , from the foot of his fellow deputy ' s open casket in the stained-glass chapel of a Moscow morgue . Rybkin ' s somber , defiant tone captured the mood of hundreds of mourners who crowded the room and spilled outside . It heralded a new showdown between Parliament and President Boris N . Yeltsin -- this time over crime , the issue that most gnaws at Russians . Martemyanov , 62 , was walking home from work_at 11:45 p.m. on Nov . 1 when he was felled by skull-fracturing blows a_few steps from his Moscow apartment_building . The assailant or assailants fled with his watch , briefcase and $ 125 . He died in a hospital Saturday , the second member of the Parliament elected in December to be fatally wounded by criminals . His death struck a vulnerable nerve . Unlike lawmaker Andrei Aidzedzis , a wealthy banker who was ambushed by a hit_man in April after publishing a list of 200 &quot; career criminals , &quot; the modest Martemyanov , who commuted to work_on the subway , was apparently the victim of a random assault -- the kind most Russians fear . The latest tragedy was magnified by Martemyanov ' s stature as head of the Moscow State Legal Academy and author of more_than 200 works in his field . The Communist_Party to which he belonged said his death reflected &quot; the loss of control over the country and the paralysis of state power. &quot; Russia recorded 16 # 000 homicides during the first_half of 1994 , a 12 % increase over the same period last year . Overall crime rose at a similar rate as gunmen invented brazen new schemes to get rich . Bandits wearing police uniforms have been flagging_down truckers on Russia ' s highways and robbing them . A gang of 40 thieves stopped a train south of Moscow a_few months ago , locked the crew in freight_cars and stole 19 # 000 sewing_machines . Minor traffic accidents in Russia occasionally end with the shakedown of the weaker driver or the theft of his vehicle . When a Russian employee of the Los Angeles Times stopped at night last week to help three motorists start their stalled car , they stole his -- after holding a pistol to his head , gagging him and handcuffing him to a fence . &quot; We live_in a society with the motto ' rape , rob , steal and you will prosper , ' &quot; Nikolai Skatov , a friend of the slain legislator , said in a eulogy . Fear of violence helped an alliance of ultranationalists , Communists and other reform-resistant politicians win a majority of seats in Parliament in December . Seizing the issue , Yeltsin decreed a wide-ranging anti-crime bill over the summer . But the Draconian measure , which allows police to hold suspected gangsters up_to 30 days without charge , hasn ' t made Russians feel safer . Meanwhile , Yeltsin has been_on the defensive for the past month , since the ruble lost a quarter of its value in one day and a Russian journalist probing corruption in the army was killed by a bomb in a briefcase . Recently , the president barely survived a no-confidence vote_in his government .</TEXT>
