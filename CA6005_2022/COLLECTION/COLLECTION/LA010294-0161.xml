   <HEADLINE> NATIVE_AMERICANS FIGHT TO PRESERVE SANCTITY OF SACRED LANDS ; THE WEST : U.S. LAND MANAGERS UNSURE HOW TO RECONCILE RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL RIGHTS WITH PRESSURE FOR PUBLIC RECREATION , MINING AND LOGGING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The meeting in Medicine Bear Lodge began with the burning of a braided strip of dried sweet_grass . A tribal elder offered a barely audible prayer . He asked_for understanding among the conflicting interests , called together by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) to express their views on the proposed expansion of a gold mine on the edge of the Ft . Belknap Indian_Reservation in the Little Rocky Mountains . The mine threatens the quality of reservation streams and ground_water , argue members of the Gros Ventre and Assiniboine tribes . Equally important , they say , the range is sacred ground that shouldn ' t be further defiled . &quot; Indian religious freedom is an environmental issue , no matter how you look_at it , &quot; said James Main Sr . Such disputes pose a dilemma for federal land managers : how to reconcile native religious and cultural rights with pressure for public recreation , mining and logging . &quot; It ' s very hard to continue to try to maintain that consistent objective position when it seems like nobody is ever pleased with what you do , &quot; said Gene Miller , associate director of the BLM ' s northern Montana area . &quot; The Native_Americans are now capable of focusing_on what they hold sacred ; they become very vocal , and rightfully so . If there is a dilemma , it ' s a dilemma for agencies such_as BLM to be able to convey the reality of the rules and regulations that we must work under , and to make_sure that everybody -- tribes , industry , whoever -- has the same information. &quot; A foundation for the tribal challenges is the American_Indian Religious Freedom Act , a congressional resolution passed in 1978 as a &quot; policy to protect and preserve for American_Indians their inherent freedom to believe , express and exercise the traditional religions. &quot; But the act has been more of a policy statement than a binding law . In a 1988 case , the U.S. Supreme Court held that , even though the action would &quot; virtually destroy the Indians ' ability to practice their religion , &quot; the Constitution could not stop the Forest Service from building a logging road through a mountaintop area in Northern California containing holy_places of three tribes . Since that ruling , native groups have been crusading for congressional amendments to the act that would better define their rights . At a hearing on proposed amendments last year before the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs , Walter Echo Hawk of the Native_American Rights Fund testified that the sentiments expressed in the act &quot; are inadequate when basic human_rights are at stake . It is time for Congress to put teeth into its policy , since the executive and judicial_branches have failed or refused to implement it in the last 13 years. &quot; The list given to Congress of other sites considered sacred and threatened includes : * The San Francisco Peaks in Arizona , where the Forest Service has allowed expansion of a ski_lift into a Navajo and Hopi religious area . * The Havasupai tribe ' s Red Butte , near the Grand_Canyon , threatened by uranium mining . * Sioux sites in the Black Hills of South_Dakota , where the Forest Service has allowed public access . * Mt . Shasta , Calif. , threatened by a Forest Service timber sale and ski_lift in a religious area used by the Wintu , Pit River , Modoc and Karuk tribes . * Volcanoes National_Park in Hawaii , where geothermal development has been permitted in the home of the goddess Pele . Many quarrels between Native_Americans and government or industry in the Western United States are decades old . The one at Ft . Belknap began in 1895 , when the federal_government took 40 # 000 acres of gold-bearing land from the original reservation . In the long-disputed Badger-Two Medicine area near Glacier National_Park in Montana , traditionalists won a temporary victory April 30 when Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt put a one-year hold_on proposed oil and gas drilling . Blackfeet consider the pristine mountain valley a historic religious area . &quot; I think the decision is irresponsible , &quot; said Janelle Fallan , executive_director of the Montana Petroleum Assn . Babbitt ' s move was motivated by &quot; political pressure from environmentalists , &quot; she said . Not far from Glacier park , in the Sweet_Grass Hills region of northwestern Montana and southern Alberta , Canada , Blackfeet and Chippewa-Cree scored another victory in April . The hills contain caves and other sites that are sacred to some Plains Indians . The soil produces grass that is used in religious_ceremonies . Antique ceremonial masks carved from seashells were found in a cave_in the_hills last year . Under pressure from Native_Americans , the BLM wrote an environmental impact statement before issuing what would have been an otherwise routine permit for gold exploration in the Sweet_Grass Hills . But the_hills were given a reprieve from prospectors ' bulldozers and drills when the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation , an independent federal agency , ruled that the bureau had failed to meet federal statutory requirements by not consulting with the tribes . The council ordered the BLM to restart its process , and this time to get more input from the tribes . Another ceremonial site revered by area tribes as a kind of Stonehenge of the Rockies is the Medicine Wheel , an ancient stone circle high on a ridge in Wyoming ' s Bighorn National Forest . Spurred by a surge of tourists and New Age visitors in the last few years , the Forest Service scheduled road improvements , a parking_area and a visitor platform . But the preservation council overrode those plans too , noting that the site is used for tribal ceremonies and that the Forest Service failed to adequately address Native_American concerns .</TEXT>
