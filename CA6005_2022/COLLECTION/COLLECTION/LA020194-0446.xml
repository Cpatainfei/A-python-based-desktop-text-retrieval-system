   <TEXT> When Joe Namson got_into the service_station business after World_War_II , attendants skittered around customers ' cars to wipe dust from the fenders and clean the floor mats -- even for drivers who bought only a couple gallons of gas . Today , at Namson ' s station on a well-trafficked corner in Sherman Oaks -- a sturdy survivor of the Jan . 17 quake -- patrons perform their own service , such_as it is . Their credit is approved at the pump , through a direct satellite link to Unocal Corp . The average fill-up takes 1 minute , 9 seconds flat . While stations around his close_down , the victims of grinding competition , Namson slices his profit_margin on self-serve regular gas to as low as 2 1 / 2 cents a gallon . He inspects his operation daily -- especially the underground fuel tanks ; if he misses a problem , the sanitation , fire , occupational safety and environmental regulators may descend . Midway through the most dramatic transformation in the history of retail gasoline sales , Namson and thousands of other dealers around the country are keeping their eye on the horizon , for even more change is coming . The next incarnation of the service_station -- what some like to call the &quot; energy fueling plaza &quot; -- will invite drivers to pull_in to buy a tank of gasoline or natural_gas and a loaf_of_bread , send a fax or pick_up the laundry or grab a Big Mac to go . Lube jobs and traditional gas-pump repartee -- perhaps , someday , human contact of any kind -- aren ' t part of the vision . &quot; It ' s not that much fun anymore , &quot; sighs Namson , 75 , who used to know all his regulars by name . &quot; There ' s no personal touch between customers and the dealer . And now it ' s even more impersonal . You go stick the card in the pump . Even the guy in the booth doesn ' t get_to know anybody. &quot; In the last two decades , Namson ' s tidy corner of the world petroleum industry -- like tens of thousands of stations across the country -- has been caught_up in massive change that runs far deeper than the dust on his customers ' windshields . Erratic oil prices , changing customer demand , costly environmental rules , high-volume competitors -- and , less obviously , the development of more durable , reliable cars -- have buffeted the gas_station business . Namson ' s corner , at Van Nuys and Ventura boulevards , has supported a service_station since 1932 , when the boxy Model A was the nation ' s favorite auto . Namson has been in the business nearly as long -- 45 years , 30 at this site . He ' s one of the survivors . In 1972 , more_than 226 # 000 traditional full-service stations existed nationwide . Today , fewer than half that number are still in business -- but there are more_than 70 # 000 self-serve mega-stations and an equal number of convenience_stores that also sell gasoline . &quot; We used to clean your windows and check the tires , &quot; said one gasoline marketing veteran . &quot; Now we try to sell you doughnuts -- at $ 4 each. &quot; * Before the mid-1970s , oil_companies competed by marketing cheap , low-octane &quot; fighting grades &quot; of gasoline in what became an industry of gaudy gas wars . Dealers wooed customers with free chickens , cigarettes , Hula-Hoops , flashlights , coffee_mugs and trading_stamps -- as well as the occasional mink_coats and Cadillacs . In 1969 , Namson tripled tire sales -- from 30 to more_than 100 a week -- with a promotion touting &quot; Bare-Bottom Prices &quot; on placards carried by bikini-clad models , ignoring neighbors who condemned the display as obscene . The graciousness and the goodies all but ended with a quiet meeting Oct . 17 , 1973 , in Kuwait City . To little notice in the United States , then obsessed by Watergate , the Arab world ' s oil ministers had agreed on an embargo -- primarily aimed at punishing America for supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War , which had erupted 11 days earlier . On top of existing gasoline shortages , the embargo quadrupled crude_oil prices . What followed was a revolution in gasoline marketing . Consumers decided that gasoline was a commodity -- that a gallon of one brand performed pretty much like a gallon of another . In fact , although some differences remain in additives from brand to brand , federal pipeline regulations by the early 1970s essentially had set national standards for octane and other gasoline characteristics . Consumers tried off-brands and found -- to their surprise -- that their cars ran fine . So when prices soared under the embargo , thousands began regularly refueling at the cheapest place in town . That put dealers in a squeeze . Most are independent entrepreneurs , paying fees to use the oil_company ' s brand name whether they own their station and the land under it or lease them from the company . Like many small-business owners , dealers can make a comfortable living -- when the economies of their industry are favorable . Although prices were rising at the pump , however , dealers found themselves in a vise . Their profits were held_down by Nixon Administration price_controls . Also , as the embargo took_hold , each station ' s fuel supply was rationed . So while Arab producers and big U.S. oil_companies enjoyed record revenues as world crude_oil prices skyrocketed , U.S. dealers -- often with nothing in their tanks to sell -- faced lines of angry motorists . &quot; Believe me , it was a hairy situation , &quot; said Don Smith , editor of the venerable National Petroleum News . More_than 25 # 000 service_stations -- more_than 10 % of the nation ' s stock -- closed_in the two months after the Kuwait City meeting . Those that toughed it out were forced to operate as cheaply as possible , with most choosing the supermarket strategy of low profit_margins and high volume . And they did_it mostly by firing the help and putting_in self-service pumps . As it happens , self-service was a Los Angeles innovation , introduced by independent Urich Oil Co . in 1947 . Self-serve stations had become pesky competitors to the major full-service chains in the 1960s -- particularly the coin-operated Gasamat chain in 11 Western states and the distinctly low-rent Hep-Ur-Sef stations in Arkansas , Oklahoma , Missouri , Texas and Louisiana . But until the embargo , the major oil_companies had fought_off self-service by enlisting fire_marshals -- in part_with stories of explosions caused by smokers standing too close to the pumps -- who in turn encouraged state legislatures to declare self-service unsafe . To this day , Oregon and New Jersey ban public sales of self-serve gas . Nonetheless , 85 % of all gasoline sold in the United States is pumped self-service -- the single biggest transformation in retail gasoline history . And with the shift has come the huge , low-price stations in prime locations that the industry calls &quot; pumpers. &quot; Pumpers wield powerful economies of scale . A central attendant can take the money for dozens of pumps . Such new operating_costs as environmental cleanups can be spread_over higher gross sales . When Joe Namson and his brother , John , took_over a station on the Westside after World_War_II , they became a hot success by jumping sales from 5 # 000 to 30 # 000 gallons a month . Now , some big oil_companies try to dump franchisees unless they pump at least 100 # 000 gallons a month . These days , Namson , who gets a daily tank-truck load of gasoline from Unocal , sells more_than 200 # 000 gallons a month . Some big-volume stations pump up_to 500 # 000 gallons a month . &quot; Everybody ' s going_for volume , &quot; Namson says warily , &quot; but the pie is only so big. &quot; * The latest plague on dealers is a steady fall_in demand for gasoline in recent years . New cars are more energy efficient . And the economy has been stalled , reducing companies ' need to transport goods and people . At the same time , low world crude prices have kept an ocean of petroleum on the market . That has kept prices at the pump , adjusted for inflation , at 1947-era lows . Profits have sagged for dealers and oil_company marketing divisions . In response , the oil_companies have tightened their belts . Most have moved to concentrate retail stations near refineries -- to cut transportation costs and get the biggest bang for their regional advertising buck . Across the country , stations have been traded , sold or shut_down -- whether the local operators liked it or not . Unocal is closing 20 % of its California stations . Arco retreated to the West Coast after 1985 , trimming its network of stations from 3 # 900 in 18 states to 1 # 600 in California , Arizona , Nevada , Oregon and Washington . Texaco swapped 92 Northern California stations for 84 Exxon stations in California and Nevada ; since 1989 , Texaco has closed more_than 3 # 200 of its 17 # 000 stations nationwide . Chevron in the last decade has shrunk its service_station network almost 30 % , down to 8 # 700 stations around the country . After a particularly bitter battle with its Southern California dealers , Exxon just pulled_down its signs from stations that held a 3.4 % share of the market in Los Angeles , Orange and Ventura counties . Since then , former Exxon dealer Ray Daryaie has raised the Mobil flag at his station at White_Oak Avenue and Ventura Boulevard in Encino . In 1986 , Daryaie invested $ 600 # 000 to buy the gas_station , washing his hands of a career as an architect and interior_designer . &quot; So_much bankruptcy , husbands and wives divorcing , &quot; he recalls of his former life . &quot; This way , I take my money home at the end of the day. &quot; And the gas_station ' s profits ? &quot; Fabulous. &quot; At least they were in 1986 . Ultimately , dealers set their pump price , based on wholesale prices , operating_costs and whatever the traffic will bear -- considering , always , the competition across the street . At first , Daryaie had a gross_profit_margin of 12 , 13 even 16 cents a gallon . By the end of 1990 , it was down to 6 or 8 cents . After Exxon announced it was pulling_out , the margin dropped to 3 to 5 cents . Over the same period , the rent he paid Exxon climbed from $ 5 # 600 to $ 9 # 500 a month , Daryaie says , and environmental compliance costs , license fees and taxes ballooned as dramatically . Small-business operators have few choices about making ends meet in tough times . Daryaie started with 36 employees and 12 service bays for tuneups and minor repairs . Now he has 12 employees and six service bays . &quot; The oil_company would not reduce their margin , &quot; Daryaie says . &quot; We had to do_it , to stay alive . . . . I had to sell my life_insurance . I had to cash_in all my savings , everything I had , little by little. &quot; At the moment , he ' s back to the rough industry standard of an 8-cent profit_margin . And he hopes to expand . Daryaie expects to add a tire sales and alignment franchise and a carwash . But he won ' t try to do more repair work . The oil_change , lube and repair side of the business -- known as the &quot; back_room &quot; in dealer parlance -- is a dying proposition for most stations . The villain ? Mainly the much-improved automobile . In the early 1970s , many auto_makers recommended lubrication and oil_changes for new cars every 1 # 000 miles , and new tires and tuneups every 15 # 000 to 20 # 000 miles . Better lubricants , the steel-belted radial_tire and other advances have changed the schedule to a lube and oil_change at about 7 # 000 miles and a tire change at 40 # 000 to 50 # 000 miles . Cadillac ' s Northstar engine , with platinum spark_plugs , is being promoted as capable of going 100 # 000 miles before its first tuneup . Even then , the expensive diagnostic equipment demanded by highly specialized on-board computers is sending more drivers to dealerships for tuneups when they are needed . And many busy drivers have taken_to getting routine fluid changes at independent quick-stop chains . Still , some station operators are reluctant to give_up their back_rooms . Chuck Yee has had repair bays for the last 16 years at his Eagle Rock station . &quot; The industry thinks snack shops and convenience_stores are the way to go , not repair , &quot; says the Shell dealer . &quot; But that ' s not for me . I love this neighborhood repair business . You meet a lot of people and it ' s more profitable. &quot; * Arco -- a company apart in the sometimes lock-step retail gasoline business -- decided quite the opposite back in the early 1970s . The first major brand to embrace self-serve pumps , the company drastically restructured to aim at low-price , high-volume sales . In the prime station locations it retained , Arco buried larger storage_tanks . It serviced them with bigger trucks : tankers that carried 1 # 800 to 2 # 000 gallons were replaced by 8 # 500- to 9 # 000-gallon models , greatly reducing the cost of supplying the Los Angeles company ' s stations . And Arco replaced most of its repair operations with AM / PM Mini Market convenience_stores . Arco also started its own chain of quick-lube shops and Smog Check stations , dumped credit_cards and revamped its refineries to cut costs . Today -- with about 90 % fewer stations than it had in 1975 -- the company sells a third more gasoline . And it is experimenting with two-acre plazas that include pumps , convenience_stores , lube shops and other operations . Others are conducting their own experiments . Unocal , Conoco , Amoco and Sunoco are putting alternative fuels -- mostly propane , methanol and natural_gas -- on the pump islands . &quot; We want to bring alternative fuels to Main_Street U.S.A. , &quot; says Shel Vedlitz , Conoco ' s alternative fuels marketing manager . And Chevron , which introduced the first direct satellite hookup for paying at the pump -- on the same satellite used by National Public Radio -- is looking hard at the burger business . The San Francisco-based company has half_a_dozen stations on the same site with Taco Bell outlets in the Dallas area and a Burger King / Chevron operation in Miami . Mobil has a similar trial with McDonald ' s at a station in Bricktown , N.J. , and two in Naples , Fla . -- although the company says badly chosen sites and other problems doomed two West Coast experiments with Taco Bell . &quot; Everyone ' s looking_for the magic_bullet , &quot; says William Berghoff , Chevron general_manager of brand services . The idea -- the buzz of the industry -- has merit , retail gasoline analyst Trilby Lundberg says . &quot; Fueling the tank and the tummy ? Truck_stops have known about this for years , &quot; Lundberg said . Meanwhile , personal service continues to wane . So-called ghost stations -- automated , 24-hour sites that don ' t require attendants -- have been discussed for years by various big marketers but have not caught_on . But in Oregon , 40 # 000 fleet customers -- from taxi companies to dump_truck contractors -- now use 300 such stations around the state .</TEXT>
