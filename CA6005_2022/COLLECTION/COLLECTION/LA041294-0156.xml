   <HEADLINE> OCTA APPROVES FUNDS FOR DISNEY GARAGE ; TRANSPORTATION : THE AGENCY , WHICH WILL COLLECT PARKING REVENUE FROM THE LOT , PLEDGES $ 32 MILLION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The giant parking structure designed to accommodate the Walt Disney Co. ' s planned Westcot expansion moved closer to reality Monday when local transportation officials approved $ 32 million toward construction . The funds were approved by the Orange County Transportation Authority and are contingent_on the agency receiving about $ 131 million in federal money for construction . The total cost of the seven-story parking garage on Clementine Street between Freedman Way and Katella Avenue is estimated at $ 223 million . The project is known as the Orange County Intermodal Transportation Center , and officials said it will be at least two years before OCTA receives additional federal funds and construction can begin . U.S. authorities also have to approve an environmental impact report for the project . &quot; Actually , two years is pretty optimistic . Disney can ' t begin construction of Westcot until the ( transportation ) center is built , because Westcot is going_to be built_on what is now a Disneyland parking_lot , &quot; said Lisa Mills , chief deputy at OCTA . The state approved $ 30 million in funding last month , bringing_to $ 62 million the total earmarked to date for construction . Anaheim has promised to provide $ 10 million for the project , while Walt Disney Co . said it will contribute $ 20 million for construction . Mills said that federal authorities have already approved $ 15.5 million to be used for the garage and for other projects on the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways . &quot; But we haven ' t decided how that money is going_to be split , &quot; Mills said . Anaheim city officials , who see both the Disney expansion and transportation project as a boon to the city ' s economy , voiced support for the OCTA board ' s action . &quot; We ' re very pleased with the intergovernmental effort of the project . When completed , it will have significant regional benefits and help alleviate transportation problems throughout Orange County , &quot; said Tom Wood , Anaheim deputy city_manager . Disney officials were unavailable for comment . Backers of the garage have brushed_aside criticism that the project is using federal funds to benefit Disney , which is privately owned . OCTA officials argue that there is also a benefit to the public because the transportation agency will keep all parking revenue and commuters will also be getting a transit station . Project supporters point_out the first_floor of the garage is designed for exclusive use by commuters . The first_floor will include an elevated urban rail lane that is part of another project , pickup and drop_off points for express_buses and shuttles , and park-and-ride spaces for car-poolers . The cost of the proposed Disney expansion is estimated at $ 3 billion . OCTA officials believe that the expansion will eventually take_place and in February authorized the construction of freeway ramps on the Santa Ana Freeway leading to Disneyland . Like the garage , construction of the ramps is not expected to begin for at least two years .</TEXT>
