   <HEADLINE> COMMENTARY ; BYSTANDER KWAN THE REAL VICTIM IN SKATING MESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I do not feel sorry_for Tonya Harding . I do not feel as sorry_for Nancy Kerrigan as I did on Jan . 6 . That was the day she was injured in an assault that Portland , Ore. , law_enforcement authorities still contend Harding helped plot , even though they accepted her guilty plea Wednesday to a lesser crime . Kerrigan recovered from her knee wounds , won a silver medal in the Winter_Olympics and , according to sports marketing experts , could earn more_than $ 10 million in her new career as a star of ice_shows , television specials and commercials . It has been suggested by some of those same experts , cynically but probably also truthfully , that Kerrigan would not have been nearly so marketable without that whack on the knee . No , it is difficult at this point to still feel sorry_for Nancy Kerrigan . I do , however , feel sorry_for Michelle Kwan . She is the victim of Skategate , perhaps the only one . When Harding resigned from the U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . on Wednesday , it was not clear whether she eventually will be required to forfeit the national championship she won in January after the favorite , Kerrigan , was forced to withdraw . If so , Kwan , as a result of her second-place finish , would become the champion . At age 13 , she would be the youngest-ever U.S. champion . But that is little compensation for not having the opportunity , perhaps the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity , to skate in last month ' s Winter_Olympics , which she , as the first alternate , would have done if Harding ' s lawyers had not been so efficient in preventing the U.S. Olympic Committee from doing the right thing and dropping their client from the team . Relying_upon the advice of Shep Goldberg , the Santa Monica agent retained by Danny and Estella Kwan of Torrance to assist their young daughter through this difficult period , both she and her coach , Frank Carroll , have for the last 2 1 / 2 months graciously declined to answer all questions pertaining to anything other_than her skating . Goldberg feared that even one controversial response would turn the Tonya and Nancy story into the Tonya and Nancy and Michelle story . So they all bit their lips before speaking , waiting for justice to prevail . It did Wednesday , three weeks too late for Kwan . She went_to Norway , but , because she was not an official team member , was not allowed to stay in the athletes ' village or train on the official practice ice . She watched the competition from the stands . If Carroll heard it once , he heard it a_thousand times that Kwan is only 13 , that she has already established herself as the sport ' s rising star by becoming the world junior champion and that there will be other chances for her to skate in the Winter_Olympics . But he has been coaching figure skaters for too long to take the future for granted . For every Kristi Yamaguchi who goes from world junior champion to Olympic champion , there are dozens of other promising young skaters who fall by the wayside . Cindy Bortz of Tarzana and Jessica Mills of Northbrook , Ill. , are two recent world junior champions from the United States who did not meet with the same success as seniors . One of Carroll ' s former students , Tiffany Chin of Toluca Lake , finished fourth in the 1984 Winter_Olympics at 16 and was immediately pronounced the gold-medal favorite for 1988 . But she developed a muscle imbalance in her hips , knee and ankles and retired before the next Olympics . Injuries happen . Bodies develop . Interests change . When Wednesday ' s news about Harding broke , Kwan was_on an airplane en route to Japan , where she will begin competition Monday in the World Championships . She is replacing Kerrigan , who withdrew . Whether Kwan will return to Japan in 1998 for the Winter_Olympics is anyone ' s guess . It is a tribute , I suppose , to the American system of justice that Harding ' s rights were protected until she pleaded guilty . But who was protecting Michelle Kwan ' s rights ? * SURPRISE PLEA : Tonya Harding pleads guilty to &quot; hindering prosecution &quot; and resigns from U.S. figure_skating as a result of the attack on rival skater Nancy Kerrigan .
