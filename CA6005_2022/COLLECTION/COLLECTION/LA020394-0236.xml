   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : NORWALK-LA MIRADA ; SCHOOL_BOARD DUMPS FAST-FOOD CONTRACT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Norwalk-La Mirada high_school students will have to go_back to eating cafeteria fare next September after a school_board decision to junk a fast-food chain ' s contract . Cafeterias at Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District ' s three high_schools serve Taco Bell burritos , but some board_members complained that Taco Bell was charging $ 1 for burritos at school , compared to 59 cents at the chain ' s restaurants . Board_members also said the district ' s cafeterias already prepare fast food such_as nachos , hamburgers and burritos . &quot; It was duplication of services , &quot; board_member Rudy Bermudez said this week . Board_members directed staff not to renew Taco Bell ' s contract when it runs_out at the end of the school_year . Taco Bell burritos were introduced on high_school campuses last fall , partly in response to the district ' s decision not to allow students off campus at lunch . Some students said at the time that they preferred Taco Bell ' s food to the cafeteria menu .</TEXT>
