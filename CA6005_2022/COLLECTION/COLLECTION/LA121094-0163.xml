   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; WARNINGS AS EARLY AS 1982 UNHEEDED , AUDITS SHOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first warnings that someone besides county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron needed to know how he was investing the public ' s money came_in an internal audit a dozen years ago . Citron , the report said , needed to document his investment policies and procedures . The next year , an outside auditor made the same recommendation . And in 1985 , a grand_jury stated it more bluntly : Someone should be looking over Citron ' s shoulder . &quot; There appears to be little or no review of investment activity by the County Board of Supervisors , chief administrative officer or auditor-controller , &quot; the grand_jury concluded after conducting an investigation of Citron ' s office . The grand jurors issued this now ominous warning : &quot; The county would face a potentially dangerous period of transition if the experience of the present leadership were to be lost . This risk is particularly evident with the treasurer , an elected official , who personally manages an investment portfolio well in excess of $ 1 billion. &quot; The grand_jury report went_on to say : &quot; Orange County investment policies , processes and cash forecasting procedures are not documented . By contrast , Los Angeles County has a well-defined working manual which explains in detail all investment policies and procedures. &quot; More warnings came_in an internal 1986 audit . Finally , in a 1993 internal audit , came the harshest admonition yet : Citron was knowingly bending the law to maximize returns on the now-bankrupt county investment pool , making &quot; risky &quot; financial deals and refusing to consult a committee charged with overseeing his investments . But for nearly a decade , no one heeded warning after warning -- although they came from inside , outside and from the watchdog grand_jury -- that Citron was holding all_the cards in the treasurer ' s office , and not allowing anyone a peek at his hand . Now , after the biggest municipal financial collapse in the nation ' s history , a simple question begs an answer : Why didn ' t someone react to the mounting criticism and 12-year push for oversight of the county ' s maverick treasurer ? Was everyone in the fund blinded by the money that Citron was earning for them until his investments headed south ? Citron , who has remained largely in seclusion since Sunday , referred all questions to his newly hired attorney , David Weichert , a former federal prosecutor turned criminal defense_attorney . Weichert defended one of the executives in Charles H . Keating Jr. ' s fraud-ridden financial empire and a LAPD detective who was one of six narcotics investigators tried some years back on federal conspiracy and theft charges . * Supervisor William G . Steiner , who joined the board four months before the critical 1993 audit came_out , and board veteran Supervisor Thomas F . Riley acknowledged that they had received copies of the audit , but did not remember it . &quot; There was nothing here that required a policy_change , &quot; said Supervisor Thomas F . Riley , holding a copy of the audit Friday . In any event , Riley added , he did not believe that the audit was overly critical of the treasurer ' s office . &quot; It should have been a huge red flag , &quot; conceded a pained Steiner , who unearthed the audit in his office after news_reports Friday morning . &quot; ( The audit ) did not get_on the board agenda . It simply was not visible. &quot; The three remaining supervisors said they could not locate their copies of the audit . Supervisor Harriett Wieder said that in hindsight the 12 years of warnings should have packed the wallop of &quot; a 2-by-4 &quot; -- had she heard of them . &quot; In the environment in those days , he was not questioned , &quot; she said . &quot; I feel frustrated that I was not in control . . . . I don ' t remember the grand_jury report . I don ' t know , and I don ' t remember. &quot; But Wieder , who was_on the board when the 1985 grand_jury report was made public , said Citron was making so_much money that no one thought to question the man Wall_Street praised , and certainly not about affairs they were hardly qualified to understand or judge . &quot; We ' re not Wall_Street brokers , &quot; Wieder said . &quot; We rely_on the people we hire to do_it for us. &quot; On Friday , she questioned whether the people charged with oversight needed some oversight themselves . Wieder said she just found_out Friday that the monthly reports of investment activity that are required under state law to be distributed to board_members by the treasurer ceased three years ago , &quot; and no one told us. &quot; She also criticized Auditor-Controller Steven Lewis for not placing the audit and Citron ' s response to it in the public realm . The audit and answer were marked &quot; Not for Board Agenda &quot; and were distributed directly to supervisors , the district_attorney and the county administrative officer . But they were not included in the packet of board material that is made public before the weekly board_meetings . &quot; ( Lewis ) might be covering his rear . How do I know ? &quot; Wieder said . She fired off a letter to Lewis Friday afternoon , criticizing him for not personally alerting board_members to the internal audit ' s inflammatory contents . &quot; I am shocked and disbelieving that you did not ensure that it would be brought_to our attention personally or to ( the attention of ) the county administrative officer , &quot; she wrote . &quot; I can only conclude that it was carelessness , indifference or bureaucratic evasiveness. &quot; Wieder demanded to know why it took 18 months to complete the internal audit , why the findings of the report were not pursued more aggressively , and where the standard six-month follow-up report was . Lewis declined to comment on the audits Friday , or to answer questions about Citron ' s efforts to comply with his office ' s recommendations . He was also unavailable to comment on how he could issue such a critical report of Citron in August , 1993 , and then offer a ringing public endorsement of Citron the next spring when Citron drew his first political challenger in 24 years in office . Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez said he did not recall getting the report and did not review it until Friday . &quot; It ' s a mystery to me as_to why we did not see the report or why it would not have found its way to us , &quot; he said . &quot; We didn ' t have it. &quot; But he said the report did not necessarily warn of impending crisis . &quot; It is not uncommon for some of these audits to contain differences_of_opinion , where the auditor-controller suggests certain methods of operation , and the other department_head disagrees , &quot; he said . &quot; When you look_to all_the people who have been involved in investing , participating , evaluating , monitoring the investments , there were no glaring signs or signals being transmitted that something was awry. &quot; The internal audit specifically warned supervisors that when Citron &quot; deviated from guidelines established by government code or the investment committee , he did so without consulting anyone in the treasurer ' s office or on the committee. &quot; Citron also told auditors that when he violated government codes &quot; the instances were conscious decisions made to maximize returns. &quot; Orange County Dist . Atty . Michael Capizzi said Friday that he did not know if his office had received a copy of the audit . However , after reviewing it , he said there was nothing in it that would have &quot; triggered action &quot; by his department . If laws were broken , they were of a civil , not criminal , nature , and were not the responsibility of his office . Vasquez said that because he did not begin his term on the board until 1987 , he could not comment on the earlier audits or the grand_jury report . * According to a five-member group of grand jurors charged with investigating Citron ' s office ' s investment procedures in 1985 , county supervisors should have started some reforms a decade sooner . Although the jurors found that Citron was &quot; making effective use of the variety and sophistication of the broad range of investment instruments , &quot; they were concerned that no one but Citron knew how he juggled the tools . As did the audits in 1982 and 1983 , the grand_jury urged that Citron put his investment style on paper and &quot; maintain written procedures covering all major areas of the investment and cash management functions &quot; because his activities &quot; affect virtually all_of the county ' s operations. &quot; The grand jurors also urged that Citron provide supervisors with monthly reports detailing the types of investments , the institutions they were from , the dates of their maturity , the amounts of deposit , the current market_value for all securities with a maturity of more_than 12 months and the rate_of_interest . An internal audit in 1986 conducted by the county auditor-controller echoed many of the same concerns , saying that many of the complicated financial maneuvers in the treasurer ' s office &quot; are often performed and understood by only one person. &quot; It again called_for written policies and procedures . The 1986 audit refers to many of the findings of the 1982 internal audit , the outside 1983 audit and the grand_jury report . Responding to the 1986 audit , Citron said that written policies and procedures are prepared to &quot; solve a problem in a particular area &quot; as problems arise , adding that &quot; in these difficult economic and budgetary times we do not deem it appropriate to request resources specifically for this purpose. &quot; The auditors bluntly said Citron &quot; should develop policies and procedures prior to the occurrences of problems rather than in response to them. &quot; The audit also criticized Citron for failing to submit investment policies for 1986 and 1987 , despite a board resolution to do so . &quot; The treasurer has obtained good yields on his investment of county funds , &quot; the auditors said . &quot; Even so , we believe it prudent for the Board of Supervisors and the county administrative officer to become more involved in the county ' s investment program. &quot; And in another now-eerie warning , the auditors cautioned that &quot; the investment function has a tremendous impact on the funding of the county ' s entire operations and the added participation of the board and CAO should help ensure that investment strategies and policies best serve the county. &quot; The audit recommended setting_up an investment committee as a way of &quot; assuring a long-term , consistent investment strategy. &quot; It is this committee that 1991 auditors found that Citron was pointedly dodging when he made &quot; risky &quot; or &quot; unusual &quot; investments . Until last week , the committee , according to the 1991 audit , was made_up of Citron , now-Acting Treasurer Matt Raabe and County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider . On Friday , Schneider said there was &quot; no way &quot; the committee could have forced Citron to do anything . &quot; I don ' t believe the board can be held responsible_for what another elected public official has done , &quot; he said . &quot; I can ' t do everyone ' s job . I can only do my job , and I think I do_it pretty good . Until this episode , we have done stellar work. &quot;</TEXT>
