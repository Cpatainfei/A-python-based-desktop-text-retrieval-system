   <HEADLINE> RESPONSE BUILDS FOR THIRD PAN AFRICAN FILM FESTIVAL ; MOVIES : NEARLY 60 MOVIES WILL BE SHOWN AT THE THIRD ANNUAL EVENT , WHICH BEGINS TONIGHT AT SUNSET 5 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the third annual Pan African Film Festival running tonight through Oct . 26 at the Sunset 5 , its director Ayuko Babu says , &quot; We feel good about where we are . Hard economic realities have made us more realistic . We get a tremendous response -- there ' s a hunger in the black community for this festival , and we ' re getting a lot of white voices on the phone asking_for a screening schedule. &quot; A tall , bearded man of much warmth , Babu , 50 , is a local attorney long involved in black political and cultural causes . He has good reason to take_pride in the festival , which this year will offer nearly 60 films and an array of special events , in contrast to last year ' s scaled-back presentation . Tonight ' s opening will present three outstanding features in separate auditoriums at 8 p.m. : Roger Gnoan M ' Bala ' s &quot; In the Name of Christ , &quot; in which an Ivory_Coast village outcast comes_to believe himself a new Messiah ; Raoul Peck ' s intricately structured &quot; The Man by the Shore , &quot; in which the terror of Haiti ' s Tonton Macoutes is seen though the eyes of an eight-year-old girl ; and Mohamed Chouikh ' s &quot; Youcef &quot; from Egypt , about an amenesiac Algerian freedom fighter ( Mohamed Ali Allalou ) who awakens to find his country independent of France but in the grip of totalitarianism . Babu is also enthusiastic about a Black British Film Night ( Friday at 8 p.m. ) , which will be sponsored by the UK / LA Festival and will be composed of five short films , two of which were directed by Isaac Julien , who made &quot; Young Soul Rebels &quot; and &quot; Looking_for Langston. &quot; &quot; Only since 1945 has there been a permanent black community in Britain , &quot; said Babu . &quot; It ' s a kind of Afro-Caribbean-British mix , and this offers a different take_on the black experience . The energy coming_out of their films is exciting. &quot; This year the festival will attempt to bring more_than 2 # 000 students from throughout Los Angeles to see one of the 12:30 p.m. daily screenings , The first , on Friday , is Isaac Mahibra ' s &quot; More Time , &quot; a film from Zimbabwe dramatizing the need for AIDS education . Babu promises that it combines &quot; the energy of ' House_Party ' with a political , cultural and health message. &quot; At the same time he is discouraged that so far , of the 200 letters the festival has sent to corporations asking_for contributions to pay_for transporting the students , he has received fewer than 10 responses . Although always on the lookout for corporate sponsors , the festival is backed by the government of Burkina Faso , Air Afrique and the City of Los Angeles ' Cultural Affairs Department . As of now , Babu describes the festival ' s financial status as &quot; 50-50 , &quot; meaning that it yields enough revenue to pay_for about half its costs . Even so , Babu believes , with proper nurturing , he has a hit on his hands . * The Pan African Film Festival runs tonight through Oct . 26 at the Sunset 5 , 8000 Sunset Blvd . ( at Crescent Heights ) . Festival information : ( 213 ) 896-8221 .</TEXT>
