   <HEADLINE> AZERBAIJAN ACCUSES RUSSIA OF MEDDLING ; DIPLOMACY : PRESIDENT ALIYEV HEADS FOR TALKS WITH CLINTON , SEEKING SUPPORT FOR HIS NEW NATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Moscow has stepped_up its meddling in Azerbaijani affairs , Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev complained as he flew off to Washington for a meeting with President Clinton where he hopes to win U.S. support for his new nation . Aliyev , the 71-year-old former member of the Soviet Politburo , accused Russia of interfering in an Azerbaijani oil deal , helping opposition leaders escape_from jail in Baku , the capital , and demanding that its own troops patrol Azerbaijan ' s borders . Most Russian troops pulled_out of Azerbaijan in mid-1993 , leaving only a missile-tracking and electronic-warfare base . Russian border guards now patrol nearly every_other border in the former Soviet_Union , but Aliyev said that the Turkish-speaking Muslim republic will refuse to allow Russian soldiers to be garrisoned along its frontier with Iran . &quot; Russia wants to put soldiers back on our borders , but we will protect them , &quot; the president said in an interview Friday . &quot; We will not give_up on our independence. &quot; Aliyev hinted that he expects a favorable_reception at his meeting with Clinton , which is scheduled for Monday . A cease-fire with Armenia in the war over the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh has been holding for four months , and both sides say prospects for peace are brighter than they have been at any time during the six-year conflict . Moreover , last week Azerbaijan signed an $ 8-billion oil exploration and production agreement with a consortium of Western companies . Four U.S. oil_companies , including Los Angeles-based Unocal , will take_part in the deal . Diplomats say more active Western support for Azerbaijan would be natural now . &quot; The balance has changed very fundamentally . It ' s very positive , &quot; one Western envoy said . &quot; Azerbaijan has taken a major step to tie itself to the West , to cast its economic future in the direction of change toward a market economy. &quot; The West has done little over the past year as Russia has regained influence in its former Caucasian territories , particularly Azerbaijan and Georgia . Russia had objected to the Azerbaijan offshore oil deal , saying the landlocked Caspian Sea ' s oil deposits belong_to all_the bordering nations . The deal went_through after the Russian national oil_company , Lukoil , was given a 10 % share , but on the day of the signing the Russian Foreign Ministry repeated its objections . One day after the oil contract was signed , four leading opponents of Aliyev ' s regime broke_out of a prison on the sixth floor of Azerbaijan ' s local KGB headquarters in what appeared to be an unusually well-planned escape . Aliyev was so unnerved that he cleared all_the country ' s television channels for a live speech to rally his nation of 7 million people . &quot; Those responsible were the same outside forces that helped Armenia in the war against Azerbaijan , &quot; the president said . &quot; Of course he meant it was Russia , &quot; a senior Azerbaijani official said . &quot; They still control people in the KGB , even the army here . The Russians were very unhappy about the oil contract being signed . &quot; Russia is trying to re-create the Soviet_Union , &quot; the official said . &quot; We are under huge pressure . If the West does not resist , they will find a new confrontation . The Americans will find themselves with a strong nuclear Russia once again. &quot; The official said he suspects Russia will seek to arm or support loyalists of the four escapees -- one of whom is the rebel leader of Azerbaijan ' s ethnic Talysh region -- to undermine the Baku government . He said Russia has used such tactics before in attempts to regain control in Georgia , Tajikistan and the breakaway southern Russian republic of Chechnya .</TEXT>
