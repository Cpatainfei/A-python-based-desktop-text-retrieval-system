   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; U.S. WOULD FIRST RELY ON AIR_POWER IN GULF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States does not have sufficient military_forces in Kuwait to stop Iraqi troops on the spot if they invade Kuwait today or Tuesday , and it hopes to use air_power to deter any attack at least until more U.S. troops arrive , military analysts said Sunday . The United States has only about 3 # 000 ground troops in the area -- a force that would be far outnumbered by the nearly 70 # 000-member contingent that Iraq has assembled near the Kuwaiti border . And even though President Clinton has approved plans to send up_to 38 # 000 troops by the end of the week , defense analysts say the United States does have enough aircraft and missiles on_hand in the region to damage the Iraqi force severely and to retaliate against other targets if Baghdad launches an attack . But they say Washington will have enough troops on the ground by midweek to repel any Iraqi invasion with a combination of armored and air_forces , despite the lopsided advantage the Iraqis have in troop strength . Pentagon strategists are betting that Iraq would not be able to launch a full-scale invasion before late this week , after it has put the logistics arrangements in place needed to sustain such an operation , and they say U.S. forces will be fully ready by then . &quot; Our goal ( for the next few days ) is to deter any Iraqi invasion , &quot; a Pentagon official said Sunday . But some analysts question whether air_power alone could successfully stop the nearly 70 # 000 troops who are assembled eight miles from the Kuwaiti border . By almost any measure , Iraqi forces could easily cross the border into Kuwait today or Tuesday . U.S. officials have been approaching the issue of U.S. readiness gingerly . On Saturday , Marine Corps Lt . Gen . John Sheehan , operations director for the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , declined to say specifically whether existing U.S. forces could actually block an immediate Iraqi push . Instead , he noted that the United States has 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles in the area , which could hit Baghdad easily . &quot; If ( Iraqi President ) Saddam Hussein does something , we can punish those forces , &quot; he said carefully -- punish , but not necessarily defeat . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry took a similar tack Sunday . &quot; I don ' t want to forecast a day-by-day account of how a battle would go , because that would depend_on how quickly they decided to go_in , how far a buildup had proceeded , &quot; he told the CBS program &quot; Face the Nation. &quot; But some analysts say the initial U.S. disadvantage would evaporate quickly . Unlike the case in the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War , the ground troops that the Pentagon is assembling in Kuwait will be able to hit_the_deck running -- because their tanks and equipment already are in the country , having been stored there in case of an Iraqi resurgence . Pentagon analysts say Hussein faces something of a trade-off : He could attack Kuwait now without full preparations , hoping to succeed briefly before his troops ultimately were destroyed by U.S. forces , or build_up further and risk a stronger U.S. force . He also might simply leave his troops near the border , hoping to force the United States into taking the first_step in hopes that it would lose some face . Perry hinted Sunday that Washington most likely would attack rather than let Iraqi troops stay there indefinitely . Anthony H . Cordesman , a Georgetown University military analyst , said the initial stages of any such battle would probably be a contest between &quot; our ( U.S. ) air and missile power and their land power &quot; -- and Iraq could not sustain that test for long . Although Iraqi forces have rebounded somewhat from their defeat in the Gulf War , they face some formidable problems : They still have no real air_power , either to provide close air support for troops or to attack U.S. positions . And they are not good at ground maneuvering . At the same time , U.S. forces are far more lethal than they were in 1991 , with greatly improved ability to attack at night and to launch precision-guided munitions . And , thanks to the Gulf War , U.S. troops are now experienced desert fighters . &quot; It would n ' t be anything like the last ( ground ) operation ( in 1991 ) , and no doubt we ' d have a little more difficulty &quot; without massive numbers of U.S. troops , said retired Army Col . Raoul Alcala , a former Pentagon strategist . &quot; But there ' s no doubt that U.S. forces could do the job. &quot; There are other advantages for the allied side . Unlike the situation in 1991 , U.S. officials are reacting quickly , in time to get forces to the region early . And Washington does not have to spend time trying to win permission to use bases in Kuwait and Saudi_Arabia . As a result , Cordesman said that although no one can predict confidently that the Iraqis would never make_it to Kuwait City , their victory would be short-lived because the Iraqi invasion force would soon be wiped_out . Robert H . Gaskin , a former Pentagon military strategist now with Business_Executives for National Security , agreed . &quot; They don ' t have the logistics situation ready for a long push , &quot; he said . &quot; If they put that force_out in the desert , they ' d just get knocked to pieces. &quot; There were about 12 # 000 U.S. service personnel in the Persian_Gulf region Sunday -- the 3 # 000 ground troops plus aircraft crews and naval personnel . An additional 4 # 300 soldiers and Marines were arriving Sunday night . Analysts said U.S. arms-storage facilities in Saudi_Arabia and Kuwait contain enough GBU-10 and GBU-12 &quot; smart bombs &quot; to destroy between 3 # 000 and 4 # 000 tanks , plus 15 # 000 cluster_bombs , adequate 30-millimeter cannon rounds and 20 # 000 large Mark 82 500-pound conventional bombs . In addition , the United States has more_than a dozen cargo_ships loaded with weapons and equipment for ground troops that might be sent to Kuwait . A squadron based on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian_Ocean is already en route to the Persian_Gulf . The United States is expected to build_up its forces rapidly over the next few days . About 4 # 000 additional Army troops were_on their way to Kuwait on Sunday from Ft . Stewart , Ga . And officials say Clinton will deploy 18 # 000 Marines from Camp Pendleton , Calif . Others will follow , sources said . Clinton has also deployed several more squadrons of U.S. warplanes -- including 24 A-10 Warthog antitank aircraft -- to Saudi_Arabia to bolster existing Air_Force and Navy fighters and bombers now in the region . But Georgetown ' s Cordesman cautioned that most analysts so far have been viewing the situation through a Western prism , assuming Hussein is trying to bully the United Nations into lifting economic sanctions against Iraq , and missing the point that his defiance of Western powers is making him a hero at_home . &quot; The prospect of martyrdom ( among Arab leaders ) is something you cannot dismiss , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
