   <HEADLINE> BIG CROP OF STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL-GOERS EXPECTED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ten years ago , Oxnard city leaders and strawberry enthusiasts decided to stage a festival at the Channel Islands Harbor celebrating the juicy red fruit that is Ventura County ' s second largest cash crop . About 25 # 000 people attended the two-day event when it debuted in 1984 , and in the years since the California Strawberry Festival has mushroomed into one of Ventura County ' s biggest special events . This year , organizers expect more_than 70 # 000 people to crowd College Park in Oxnard for the two-day festival , which begins Saturday at 10 a.m. and will feature live entertainment , arts and crafts , pie-eating contests , a 10K race and strawberries prepared in every conceivable way . Three Dog Night , the Temptations , Big Mountain and Doug Kershaw will headline the weekend ' s musical_performances , while clowns , puppets and face-painting will entertain children throughout the weekend in the festival ' s Strawberryland . Forecasters expect scattered storm_clouds that have hovered over Ventura County for days to clear this weekend , revealing sunny skies and warmer temperatures . &quot; We ' ve really tried to focus_on a family event , &quot; said festival committee_member Don DeArmond , who was one of the event ' s original planners . &quot; We ' ve tried to ( create ) something that the city of Oxnard could be proud of. &quot; This week the Oxnard City_Council agreed to turn_over the festival ' s management to a private , nonprofit corporation next year . City leaders want to spin_off the event so as_to reduce the city ' s liability and make the festival self-sufficient . In each of the past five years , the festival has generated more_than $ 500 # 000 in profit , with much of it directed to support local nonprofit groups . DeArmond said the privatization will help ease the festival ' s budget process and attract long-term sponsors . &quot; The main reason we needed to do that was for years we ' ve been budgeted on a yearly basis , &quot; he said . &quot; Our problem was now that we ' ve grown , our sponsors want to talk to us about two-year and three-year deals and we couldn ' t do that because we had to come_up_to the yearly budget. &quot; DeArmond said the decision to privatize won ' t affect the character of the festival , which prides itself on its family oriented events and low cost . &quot; We want to refine it , improve it and bring_in better entertainment and arts and crafts . We don ' t want to turn it into a commercial monster , &quot; he said . Tickets for the festival are $ 5 for adults , $ 3 for senior_citizens and children ages 2 to 12 , and children under 2 are admitted for free . The ticket cost includes admission to the featured concerts . The Strawberry Festival ' s growing popularity has overwhelmed officials at the Oxnard Chamber_of_Commerce and the city ' s special events office , who have been deluged by phone_calls in the weeks leading_up to the event . &quot; In February , I was getting 20 calls a day just on the festival , &quot; said chamber employee Peggy Hollinger . &quot; Now , we ' re getting_up to 50 and 60 calls a day , and we ' re not the ones who handle the festival. &quot; The city ' s special events office , which is handling the event , has resorted_to a recorded message to field the calls . &quot; Every year it just grows and gets bigger and better , &quot; Hollinger said . &quot; We are overwhelmed. &quot;</TEXT>
