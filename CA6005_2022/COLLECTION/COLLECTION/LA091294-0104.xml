   <HEADLINE> CAL LUTHERAN GETS WIRED FOR AGE OF INFORMATION ; TECHNOLOGY : CAMPUS ' S NEW FIBER-OPTIC CABLE LINES PROVIDE COMPUTER ACCESS TO E-MAIL , LIBRARY CATALOGUE AND CLASSROOMS AS FAR AWAY AS KENTUCKY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A minute past midnight and the doors of Cal Lutheran University ' s library are locked . You have to read Shakespeare ' s &quot; A Midsummer_Night ' s Dream &quot; for a 9 a.m. class , but you have searched the dorm from top to bottom and cannot find a copy of the play to save your life . What to do ? In the old days , you probably gave_up and slept through the class to avoid meeting the disappointed eyes of your professor . In the days of high-technology , there is an answer . Return to your dorm_room , flip on your computer , dial into the Internet and tap into the Shakespeare files , where scripts of all his plays , complete with analysis and commentary , are at your fingertips . This summer , while students were off working as waiters , lifeguards and the_like , crews were busy wiring Cal Lutheran , laying 58 miles of fiber-optic cable throughout the Thousand Oaks campus . About 3 # 500 students , faculty and staff will be able to access Internet to use e-mail , browse through the library catalogue , do research , and share classroom cyberspace with students as far away as Kentucky and as close as Oxnard . Its official name is CLUnet , pronounced &quot; clue-net &quot; on campus . &quot; We ' ve really taken a giant step_forward , &quot; said Ken Pflueger , Cal Lutheran ' s director of information services . &quot; We ' ve put_in the infrastructure to do things that haven ' t even been thought of yet. &quot; Installing the system cost the university $ 1.8 million . Pflueger said he expects that Cal Lutheran will spend about another $ 1 million over the next two years enhancing and improving the system . Cal Lutheran will start issuing user accounts to everyone on campus Oct . 1 . But the buzz about the new technology has already spread across campus . &quot; Someone got_hold_of this , &quot; said Pflueger , picking_up a Xeroxed draft of a pamphlet for students explaining the services . On the back is an order_form for user accounts . &quot; It ' s been photocopied and passed_out by someone , I don ' t know who . We ' ve already got a stack of them filled_out already even though we haven ' t printed the real pamphlet yet. &quot; Although many students are already familiar_with computer_technology and using Internet , Pflueger said he expects some of Cal Lutheran ' s 300 faculty_members to balk at the leap to high-technology . Electronic mail alone might baffle them . &quot; No one likes to admit that they don ' t know things , &quot; he said . So the more technologically aware professors on campus have volunteered to mentor their colleagues , teaching them one on one about the system . Several professors were instrumental in designing the system and have already been using it in classrooms . Last year , Harry Domincone , an assistant_professor in Cal Lutheran ' s School of Business , began using Internet in his classes for research . One student working_on a term paper about the European holdings of a U . S . food conglomerate was able to use Internet to get obscure information from a library in Pisa , Italy . Domincone also used Internet to hook his students up with a business class at the University of Louisville in Kentucky . They worked_on a joint project all semester , sharing ideas and research . &quot; Students here had the benefit of engaging in group_discussion with people with different kinds of world experience , &quot; Domincone said . &quot; They also had entire libraries at their fingertips. &quot; Today ' s electronically sophisticated college_students demand this kind of technology , Domincone said . &quot; Cal Lutheran will be one of the first internationally to get_it going , &quot; he added . The system was designed by Fugitsu Business Communication_Systems and National Systems Research Co . Fugitsu plans to use Cal Lutheran as a selling model to line_up other universities , he said . &quot; We ' re the original aluminum-siding house that everyone wants to drive their clients by , &quot; Domincone said . Andrea Huvard , a biology professor and director of Cal Lutheran ' s Center for Instructional Multimedia , has big plans for the new network . She will put her course syllabus on the network , as well as lecture outlines and diagrams . Eventually , she hopes to be able to put slide shows of marine life in the system , contributing to the general_store of information on the Internet . She also plans to use multimedia presentations in class , using technology to show students three-dimensional images of invertebrates and marine_animals . But she does have some doubts about technology replacing traditional teaching_methods . &quot; I may spend three or four hours putting_together a multimedia lecture that I deliver , &quot; Huvard said . &quot; It ' s fun , but did they actually learn more about marine biology that day than if I had just drawn_on the chalkboard ? It ' s a question that I ' m constantly struggling with. &quot; Rorik Melberg , 21 , a senior majoring in computer_science , is already well-acquainted with Information Age technology , particularly the Internet . &quot; Once you use it , it ' s so easy , &quot; Melberg said . &quot; It ' s great . I love it . The Internet has tons and tons of information on any subject. &quot; He was happy to get a letter in the mail from the university this summer telling him that he would be able to access the network from his dorm_room . &quot; The computers in the library are slow , &quot; he said . &quot; And they close at midnight . &quot; The big thing for me is going_to be being able to download pictures and files , just like that , &quot; he said , snapping his fingers . &quot; You won ' t have people waiting for computers behind you . Twenty-four-hour access. &quot;</TEXT>
