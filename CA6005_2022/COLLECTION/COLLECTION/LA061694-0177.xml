   <HEADLINE> STUDY CASTS DOUBT ON BREAST_IMPLANT PERIL ; HEALTH : MAYO CLINIC REPORT FINDS THAT RECIPIENTS ARE NO MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP ILLNESSES SUCH AS ARTHRITIS AND LUPUS THAN OTHER WOMEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The largest study ever of breast_implants finds no evidence that they cause rheumatoid_arthritis or other serious diseases , challenging the claims of women who reached a $ 4.3-billion settlement with manufacturers . The review , conducted at the Mayo Clinic , found that women who get implants to enlarge or reconstruct their breasts are no more likely than anybody else to develop a variety of connective-tissue disorders . These diseases , including arthritis , lupus , scleroderma and several less common illnesses , have been linked to leaking implants . Much of the apparent evidence came from examples of individuals getting sick after receiving implants . However , such illnesses could be unrelated to their implants . Until now , there has been little rigorously conducted comparison to see if those who get implants have worse health than other people . The study &quot; should provide a lot of encouragement and reassurance to women who have been literally terrified by the unfortunate hype and hysteria that surround this , &quot; said Dr. Sumner Slavin , a plastic_surgeon at Boston ' s Beth Israel Hospital . The Mayo report is not the first epidemiological study showing no link between connective-tissue diseases and the implants . Several large studies presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology in San Antonio in November also showed no association . * Although no single study can prove that breast_implants are safe , the researchers say theirs suggests that if there is any hazard , it is small . The study , headed by Dr. Sherine E . Gabriel and published in today ' s New England Journal of Medicine , was financed by the National Institutes of Health and the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons . The researchers studied all_the women given breast_implants in Minnesota ' s Olmsted County , home of the Mayo Clinic , from 1964 through 1991 . They compared them to twice as_many women the same age who did not get implants . Connective-tissue diseases were very rare among the women . After an average of eight years of follow-up , precisely the same proportion got these illnesses in both groups -- five of the 749 implant recipients and 10 of the 1 # 498 in the comparison group . One million to 2 million U.S. women are thought to have gotten breast_implants . The Food and Drug Administration took implants off the market two years ago , contending that manufacturers failed to collect necessary safety data . More_than 13 # 000 lawsuits have been filed against Dow Corning and other manufacturers by women blaming implants for a variety of ailments . Manufacturers have agreed to the $ 4.3-billion settlement but have not admitted that the implants are harmful . Dr. Marcia Angell , the journal ' s executive editor , said the work cannot conclusively rule_out any link between implants and connective-tissue diseases , in part because so few women studied had the diseases , &quot; but their data are the best we have. &quot;</TEXT>
