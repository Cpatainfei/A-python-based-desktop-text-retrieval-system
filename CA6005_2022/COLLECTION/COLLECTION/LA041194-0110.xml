   <TEXT> President Francois Mitterrand , launching 50th anniversary commemorations of France ' s liberation , paid tribute Sunday to young Resistance fighters killed not long before D-Day . Mitterrand led about 3 # 000 survivors and relatives of the fallen_in a moving ceremony commemorating members of the Maquis -- the partisan bands , which took their name from the shrubby Mediterranean flora -- who faced German mountain troops and French collaborators in a battle on the snowy Plateau des Glieres in March , 1944 . The fighting was the first major open battle mounted by the Resistance against the occupiers and took_place just weeks before the June 6 Allied landings in Normandy . &quot; It was a tragedy that ended in blood and in horror , &quot; Mitterrand said of the heavy casualties suffered by the Maquisards and locals . The small cemetery where Mitterrand paid tribute contains the graves of 105 of the 149 partisans killed in the battle . About 900 civilians , accused of backing the Resistance , were deported to German concentration_camps .</TEXT>
