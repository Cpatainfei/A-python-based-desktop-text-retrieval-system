   <HEADLINE> EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : SIMI VALLEY ; MORE HOT_WEATHER AND SMOG FORECAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The oppressive summer heat in the east county continued to force Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks residents to seek relief in pools and air-conditioned homes Monday , and forecasters said the end of the sweltering weather is still several days away . In Simi Valley , where temperatures hit 97 degrees and air quality approachedan unhealthful level , city-run day_camps canceled plans for more strenuous outdoor activities in favor of games that were either quiet or wet . &quot; We ' re dividing our time between the shade of the trees and the public pools , &quot; said Diana Riley , city recreation supervisor . &quot; Our biggest concern has been the smog , &quot; she said . &quot; Most of the children don ' t like the heat , but they are pretty accustomed to it by now. &quot; Despite the high_temperatures , county officials reported smog levels in Simi Valley , Moorpark and Thousand Oaks were lower Monday than initially expected . Air quality for the inland part of the county was rated as moderate , not unhealthful , which county forecasters said was a welcome relief . &quot; Usually when you have a high_pressure system like the one that ' s bringing us this heat , you expect it will act like a lid , and keep pollutants trapped in the area , &quot; said Gary Arcemont , a Ventura County Air_Pollution Control District meteorologist . &quot; But that isn ' t always the case , as we can see today. &quot; However , the district is forecasting unhealthful air in Simi Valley today and possibly throughout the week . Air quality in Thousand Oaks will be near the unhealthful level today , while it will remain moderate in the rest of the county , district meteorologists said . Today and Wednesday , temperatures in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks are expected to remain in the 90s , while temperatures in Ojai and Fillmore were expected to hit 100 . The coastal areas will remain cooler in the 70s and 80s , meteorologists said . Cooler breezes from over the Pacific_Ocean are not expected to reach inland areas until the end of the week , said Curtiss Brack , forecaster with WeatherData Inc. , which forecasts weather for The Times .
