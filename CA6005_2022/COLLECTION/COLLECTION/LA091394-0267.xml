   <HEADLINE> BRITAIN TO QUIT BOSNIA FORCE IF ARMS OKD ; BALKANS : BUT LONDON WILL NOT VETO ANY U.S. MOVE AT UNITED NATIONS TO LIFT WEAPONS EMBARGO AGAINST MUSLIM-LED SARAJEVO GOVERNMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Britain warned the United States on Monday that it will remove its peacekeeping troops from Bosnia if Washington insists on lifting the arms embargo against the Muslim-led Bosnian government . Britain said , however , that it will not try to veto any U.S. move at the United Nations to end the sanctions but rather will abstain , on the grounds that the United States will go_ahead with such an action unilaterally . Following a vote by the U.S. Congress , the Clinton_Administration has set a deadline of Oct . 15 for the Bosnian Serb rebels to accept an international peace plan that gives them 49 % of the republic or see the weapons embargo lifted . The Serbs overwhelmingly rejected the peace plan in a referendum last month . &quot; If the U.N. was to decide to start supplying arms to one of the combatants in this war , &quot; said British Defense_Secretary Malcolm Rifkind , &quot; there is no way in which U.N. forces could remain in Bosnia on a bipartisan basis. &quot; Britain and France , which have the most troops serving under the U.N. peacekeeping mandate in the former Yugoslav federation , have opposed a lifting of the arms embargo . Rifkind said lifting the embargo would reunite the Serbs -- now divided by the blockade that authorities in Belgrade , capital of Serbia and the rump Yugoslavia , have mounted against their intransigent Bosnian ethnic kin -- and invite Russian hostility . In a weekend meeting , European foreign_ministers condemned the possible U.S. decision to end the embargo . German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel declared : &quot; Lifting the embargo would give_rise to incalculable risks and should only be considered as a solution of last_resort . It should not be imposed unless we are sure our peacemaking efforts have failed. &quot; And French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe added that ending the embargo was &quot; an absurdity. &quot; The British argue that if the arms embargo is lifted fighting will intensify and the position of U.N. peacekeeping forces will be untenable . Britain and France are making contingency plans to evacuate troops from Bosnia-Herzegovina -- an operation expected to take three months . Their withdrawal would mean an end of the U.N. Protection Force in the ex-Yugoslav republics .</TEXT>
