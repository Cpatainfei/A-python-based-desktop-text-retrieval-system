   <HEADLINE> MCNEE RANCH : VIEWS AND WIDE OPEN SPACES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not even a sign welcomes you to McNee Ranch State Park , 25 miles south of San Francisco on the San Mateo County coast . But what the park lacks in such basics as signs and facilities , it more_than makes_up for in grand views and wide-open spaces . And oh , what views ! The coastline from Half Moon Bay to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area is at your feet . The panoramic view is a hiker ' s reward for the rigorous ascent up Montara Mountain , whose slopes form the bulk of the state park . This mountain , geologists say , is a 90-million-year-old chunk of granite that forms the northernmost extension of the Santa Cruz Mountains . * A coastal scrub community -- ceanothus , sage and monkey flower -- predominates on the mountain . The park also boasts several flower-strewn grasslands . Meandering down Montara Mountain is willow- and alder-lined Martini Creek . The park ' s trail system includes footpaths as well as Old San Pedro Road , a dirt road popular_with mountain bikers . Little hiker symbols keep walkers on the trail , but since all routes climb Montara Mountain and more or less meet at the top , you needn ' t be overly concerned about staying_on the &quot; right &quot; trail . Opposite the state park , across Coast Highway , is Montara State Beach . This half-mile sand strand is a popular surfing , fishing and picnicking spot . Nearest spot for provisions is the hamlet of Montara , where there ' s a cafe and grocery_store . Accommodations include the Montara Lighthouse Hostel , which sits right on the coast next to a working lighthouse . The 30-bed hostel has kitchen facilities , a volleyball_court and even an outdoor hot tub . Directions to trail head : Take California 1 to Montara and park in the lot at the north end of Montara State Beach . Carefully walk 150 yards up-coast and cross the highway . The unsigned trail begins at a pipe gate across a fire road on the inland side of Coast Highway . The hike : Walk up the fire road a short distance and join the trail on your left . It swings north , up-coast , over a seasonally flowered grassy slope . The path drops to join a dirt road , then begins ascending once more . As you climb , you ' ll pass two benches , strategically placed for you to catch your breath . The dirt road eventually swings south , but you join a footpath and ascend to a saddle . Two trails lead left to the peak and to some terrific views . Below you , up-coast , is the town of Pacifica and , beyond , the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco Bay . Montara Mountain_Trail WHERE : McNee Ranch State Park . DISTANCE : 7 miles round_trip , with 2 # 000-foot elevation gain . TERRAIN : Coastal , scrub-covered Montara Mountain , the far northern extension of the Santa Cruz Mountains . HIGHLIGHTS : Fabulous coastal vistas from Half Moon Bay to Golden Gate .
