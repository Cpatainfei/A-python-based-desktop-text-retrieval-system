   <TEXT> The final surprise of Richard Nixon ' s career might well have taken_place after his death April 22 . Instead of being lambasted with vituperative op-ed memoirs and obits , Nixon was memorialized as a complicated politician with as_many gifts as flaws . Several writers even suggested that Nixon ' s efforts to ratchet_down the Cold_War pressure and open_doors to China would overshadow Watergate . Watergate -- that single , ominous word encompassing a complex web of crimes and misdemeanors woven by Nixon ' s White_House , and the elaborate cover-up Nixon and his men devised to conceal those crimes . The Watergate scandal forced Nixon to resign from office in August , 1972 . As ex-President , he strove for 20 years to rehabilitate himself . Could it be that Watergate might become a footnote in history ? Not if British TV producers Brian Lapping and Norma Percy have anything to do with it . Just as the posthumous image of Nixon was beginning to soften , along comes the devastating , five-part series &quot; Watergate , &quot; by Lapping ' s U.K.-based production company , Brian Lapping Associates , and co-produced by the_British Broadcasting Corp . and the Discovery Channel . At nearly 230 minutes , &quot; Watergate &quot; is television ' s first exhaustive documentation -- based on former London Times Washington correspondent Fred Emery ' s new book &quot; Watergate &quot; -- of the events that led to the United States ' most serious modern constitutional crisis . Just as striking is how the Lapping-Percy team ( including producer-director Paul Mitchell ) managed to lure on camera virtually every important and secondary participant in the Watergate plot , cover-up and investigation . Among those who break their decades-long silence is James McCord , who participated in the White House-authorized June 17 , 1972 , break-in of the Democratic Party National Headquarters at Washington ' s Watergate Hotel , triggering the White_House cover-up of a series of illegal , pre-Watergate wiretaps and break-ins . Other notorious Watergate figures who speak on camera include Nixon campaign intelligence head G . Gordon Liddy , campaign deputy director Jeb Magruder , and Nixon ' s key aides H.R. Haldeman ( filmed eight months before his death in November , 1993 ) and John Ehrlichman . Above them all is host-narrator Daniel Schorr , whose Watergate reports for CBS News earned him a position on Nixon ' s &quot; enemies list. &quot; Given Lapping ' s previous remarkable documentary , &quot; The Second Russian_Revolution , &quot; the power of this detailed but lucid new report on a scandal barely known to a generation of TV viewers isn ' t unexpected . What is , though , is the story of how Lapping and Percy arrived_at their report . As the pair sit at a large glass table in a Los Angeles hotel suite , they occasionally look over at the man who blew the lid on the Watergate cover-up -- former Nixon counsel John W . Dean . A few minutes later , Schorr arrives_at the suite and sits across the table from Dean -- former combatants , now friendly partners in helping promote a series they both insist is the accurate account of the scandal . Dean ' s contacts with the_British producers , however , were not always so rosy . &quot; When Brian and Norma first reached me , &quot; Dean recalls , &quot; I wanted nothing to do with them . I suggested to them that the story they were trying to tell was phony. &quot; When Lapping learned , in 1991 , of Len Colodny ' s and Robert Gettlin ' s controversial new Watergate book , &quot; Silent Coup , &quot; he thought that here was the stuff for &quot; a provocative , startling look_at Watergate with completely new information . It was_on this basis that I sold the idea to the BBC and Discovery. &quot; Percy , with Emery and Mitchell , then set_out to research the background of &quot; Silent Coup. &quot; &quot; We began our work , &quot; says Percy , &quot; during the 20th anniversary of the ' 72 break-in , and now it airs on the 20th anniversary of Nixon ' s resignation . So the series took nearly as long to make as it took_for the Watergate scandal to unfold. &quot; &quot; Silent Coup &quot; made assertions against Dean , and his future wife , Maureen , that Lapping believed could form the basis of their documentary . But after six weeks of investigation -- including a long search through Nixon ' s own files at the Virginia-based Nixon Project , Percy ' s team concluded that there was no evidence to support &quot; Silent Coup ' s &quot; thesis . &quot; Well , &quot; Lapping sighs , &quot; after learning that the whole basis for your series is air , where do you go ? It actually wasn ' t as difficult as we had anticipated to go_back and tell the known story. &quot; &quot; The real story , &quot; says Percy , &quot; is actually the most devastating and dramatic of all , but I was deeply concerned all along that young people would either never understand the true history , or latch onto some revisionist myth . When my two nieces saw the final product on the BBC , though , they were absolutely goggle-eyed . That was very gratifying. &quot; Percy acknowledges that while &quot; Watergate &quot; doesn ' t definitively prove that Nixon ordered the break-in , &quot; it explains how he ordered the espionage action plan , carried_out by Liddy and ( fellow spy E . Howard ) Hunt , that included the break-in. &quot; It does even more . Series researcher Jeff Goldberg uncovered a copy of a document , signed_off by Haldeman , which proves that the White_House approved Liddy ' s illegal $ 300 # 000 intelligence plan . Dean , who finally accepted Lapping ' s offer to go_on camera , wasn ' t told by Percy of the document until it was handed to him while cameras were rolling . On film , Dean calls it &quot; a truly amazing document to have surfaced at such a late date , &quot; strongly suggesting that if Nixon ' s closest confidant Haldeman knew , &quot; then Nixon knew. &quot; This kind of dramatic gesture on Percy ' s part is typical of her interview approach . Says Lapping : &quot; Norma makes everyone she talks to feel very comfortable , because they can tell that she ' s done her homework . Eventually , they tend to let their guard down and talk frankly on camera. &quot; When asked why it took so_long for TV to get_out the full Watergate story , Schorr notes that &quot; TV wasn ' t getting_out any of the story when it was happening . Stories were breaking_in June , 1972 , and the networks were focused_on the two party conventions . Bill Small , CBS ' Washington bureau chief , told me about ' this Watergate thing , ' and that I would be ' the Watergate correspondent , ' with Leslie Stahl helping me . I wasn ' t sure what he meant at first ; that was how in the dark we were about this. &quot; TV eventually told the world about Watergate , for , &quot; as British youth , &quot; Percy says , &quot; we were completely glued to the set during the Watergate hearings . People in Europe , and elsewhere , followed it every step of the way , &quot; After all_of this time , what is Watergate ' s lesson ? Schorr says that it points to the danger of &quot; the mystique of the Presidency , one of only two elective offices which all voting Americans select . Taken too far , the mystique works_on the President , who believes -- as Nixon believed -- that he embodies the public ' s will. &quot; Dean , leaning_back in his chair , mulls it all_over : &quot; The only good thing for me about Watergate was that I had to tell the truth of what I knew . But if the truth is lost in the meantime , it is because people tend to forget . This program makes any denial , any forgetting , impossible. &quot; &quot; Watergate &quot; premieres at 9 p.m. Sunday with parts 1 and 2 . It continues Monday-Wednesday at 9 p.m. with parts 3 , 4 and 5 . The documentary in its entirety re-airs next Sunday , Aug . 14 at noon .</TEXT>
