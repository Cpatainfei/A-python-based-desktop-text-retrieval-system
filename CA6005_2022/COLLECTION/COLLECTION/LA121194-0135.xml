   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; IN THE KNOW : THE LOSS OF DENIABILITY ON INTELLIGENCE_OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin marched to the brink of war with a breakaway region of the Caucasus Mountains recently , then backed_off at the last minute when friends and enemies alike raised a clamor of protest . Then late last week , he authorized the use of force against unspecified militias in the region . This back-and-forth approach reveals much about the operating style of Russian intelligence organizations since the dissolution of the old KGB in 1991 . As always with intelligence_operations , the story is complicated . Indeed , complexity is the first guarantee of secrecy for intelligence_operations the world over . But the case of the mountainous homeland of the Chechen people , once sorted_out , proves covert_operations in the classic style are increasingly difficult to conceal in a world where even ordinary citizens have caught_on to the unmistakable signs of hidden manipulation . Readers will recall that the numerous republics trapped in the old Soviet_Union separated quickly after a failed coup attempt in Moscow by hard-liners back in 1991 , but it may have been forgotten that many regions of what has been called Russia since the time of the czars were also eager to go their own way . One , the autonomous region ( not republic ) of Chechnya , declared independence under the leadership of a former Soviet air_force general , Dzhokar Dudayev . The Chechen people were never reconciled to their conquest in the 19th Century ; and their expulsion from their homeland by Josef Stalin during World_War_II is still bitterly resented by survivors who returned . Dudayev was widely supported , but ethnic Russians living_in the region did not want to sever ties with Moscow . In desperate need of Western aid and fearful of alarming potential donors in the West , Yeltsin let the republics go -- but did what he could to hold_on to the restive regions in Russia itself , short of sending_in the army . He refused to recognize Dudayev ' s declaration_of_independence and offered quiet support -- many details are still lacking -- for Chechnya groups who wanted to remain part of Russia . Recently , the struggle turned military in nature and fighting began to escalate . Chechen rebels supporting Dudayev charged that the opposition was financed and controlled by Russia . Moscow denied it . The Chechens claimed the opposition forces were commanded by Russians and included Russian soldiers . Moscow denied it . The Chechens protested that an air_raid on the Chechen capital of Grozny , killing nine civilians Dec . 1 , was conducted by Russian planes flown_by Russian pilots . Moscow denied it . Then Yeltsin issued an ultimatum : If a cease-fire was not reached in the region of Chechnya , Russia would formally intervene with its army to restore order . Does all this sound familiar ? Detail by detail , the unfolding events in Chechnya mirrored the U.S. plan of nearly 35 years ago to invade Cuba and topple Fidel Castro ' s government -- plans formed and half-carried out not once , but twice . The initial attempt was too big to hide . First , U.S. bombers raided Castro ' s airfields . The State_Department , backed_up by the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Adlai E . Stevenson , insisted the pilots were Cuban defectors , the planes belonged_to Castro , the government of John F . Kennedy had nothing to do with it . Then a flotilla of ships landed a_thousand armed men on a beach along a stretch of Cuba ' s southern coast called the Bay of Pigs . The U.S. State_Department again insisted the fighters were simply Cuban patriots , the force had armed and trained itself , the United States had nothing to do with it . If Castro had taken longer to crush the invading force , the plan would have called_for the invaders to declare a new provisional government . Then , according to the scenario worked_out by the CIA officers behind the operation , Washington would have recognized the rebel government and intervened with U.S. troops &quot; to restore order , &quot; if necessary -- or so it was hoped by the principal puppet-masters , CIA director Allen W . Dulles and his deputy , Richard M . Bissell Jr . Kennedy manfully shouldered the blame -- but was furious at the failure . Less well-known is the fact that the President charged his brother , then Atty . Gen . Robert F . Kennedy , with overseeing a second attempt . Brought in to run the show was Maj . Gen . Edward G . Lansdale , the psychological-warfare expert who had helped the government of the Philippines defeat a communist insurgency . Lansdale ' s master_plan , often derided as unrealistic , called_for an aggressive campaign of covert_operations culminating in a victory parade through the streets of Havana before the congressional elections in November , 1962 . What actually happened in November , 1962 , it will be remembered , was a collective worldwide sigh of relief at the peaceful resolution of the Cuban missile crisis . Lansdale ' s program and his paramilitary raids on Cuban sugar_refineries and the_like were overshadowed by the Soviet-U.S. confrontation that appeared to threaten the outbreak of nuclear war . Castro knew what was going_on , of course , but the U.S. public did not begin to see_through the veil of secrecy until the mid-1970s -- when a Senate committee investigated the Central_Intelligence_Agency , including the efforts to assassinate Castro that had been a central feature of Lansdale ' s plan . The comic side of these plots -- which involved poisoned cigars , the Mafia , a fountain_pen rigged to inject a deadly toxin and even exploding sea shells -- convinced many observers that Lansdale ' s whole program promised nothing more_than an embarrassing sideshow dominated by keystone cops . But whenever an intelligence_operation looks_like a joke , look again . In this case , as is so often , there is a missing piece in the Lansdale timetable between blowing_up sugar_refineries and the victory parade . CIA officers who worked with Lansdale point_out that major U.S. military exercises were carried_out in the Caribbean in August , 1962 , and insist Lansdale had the agreement of the White_House to provide in 1962 what had been refused at the Bay of Pigs -- open U.S. military intervention . This has always been denied by those in the Kennedy Administration , but a former director of the Central_Intelligence_Agency , who must remain nameless , once told me that there were plenty of people I might ask_for the details of the anti-Castro operation in 1962 -- that it was discussed in detail at regular meetings of high officials from the Pentagon . For example , most Cuban planning meetings were attended by the secretary of the Army at the time -- Cyrus R . Vance . If he couldn ' t make_it , the Army ' s chief lawyer might attend in his place , Joseph A . Califano Jr. ; or perhaps his military aide would sit in , a bright young Army major named Alexander M . Haig Jr . More recently , one of Lansdale ' s assistants at the CIA said his boss was no fool ; he had no illusions that paramilitary &quot; boom and bang &quot; would topple Castro , or that propaganda leaflets dropped_by the CIA would trigger a popular uprising . All that was just window-dressing . The victory parade would follow direct U.S. military intervention -- &quot; to restore order. &quot; The Kennedy-Lansdale plan never worked_out -- and neither did Yeltsin ' s . In his case , the problem was that everyone caught_on to the &quot; secret &quot; plan from the start . Dudayev ' s forces captured a score of Russian military_men who said they had been recruited and paid well by the Federal Counterintelligence Service , a remnant of the old KGB now known by its Cyrillic initials , FSK . Political opponents ridiculed the Yeltsin government ' s feeble claim that the soldiers were &quot; volunteers &quot; -- an excuse that worked better for President Dwight D . Eisenhower back in the more-innocent 1950s , when U.S. pilots involved in a CIA operation were captured in Indonesia . The story about the &quot; volunteers &quot; was the first to go , exploded by detailed reports of dealing with the FSK . Next was the Yeltsin threat to send_in Russian troops to &quot; restore &quot; order -- fighting had been started by the Russians in the first place , and everyone knew it . Instead , Yeltsin sent his defense minister , Pavel S . Grachev , to meet with Dudayev and call a truce . They met in Ordzhonikidzevskaya , a small_town named after Sergo Ordzhonikize , one of the founders of the Soviet_Union ' s first intelligence service . In Ordzhonikidzevskaya , Grachev took_back all_of Yeltsin ' s threats of war , and then conceded , almost as an afterthought , that yes , it was true , the planes and pilots who raided Grozny were Russian . There was no secret to give_away -- the Chechens and everybody else knew an old trick when they saw one. *</TEXT>
