   <HEADLINE> GETTING NEW LAUGHS OUT OF OLD MOVIES ; IMPROV : L.A. CONNECTION RESHAPES ' WRESTLING WOMEN ' WITH A MIX OF COMEDY , SOUND_EFFECTS AND MUSIC .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Imagine a version of the film &quot; The Blob &quot; where the amorphous alien comes_to Earth not as a hostile invader , but as a Henny Youngman-type comedian looking_for a gig on &quot; The Tonight Show. &quot; Or , how about a movie featuring Cyrano de Bergerac as a hard-luck fellow whose limited job skills reduce him to punching_out the holes in doughnuts with his oversized schnoz . No , these aren ' t old Mel Brooks screenplays that never reached fruition . Rather , they are multimedia presentations by the L.A. Connection comedy troupe , which reshapes old movies by dropping_out their soundtracks and replacing them with live comedy dialogue , sound_effects and music . For the past dozen years , the L.A. Connection ' s irreverent actor-writers have navigated a host of campy and classic film characters through a variety of outrageous new situations . In many cases , the group ' s rewrites contain only a tangential connection to the films ' original plots and characters . ( During screenings , the actors- who are accompanied by a keyboard player -- sit in the front of the theater with microphones. ) &quot; Everybody does what we do_in a way , &quot; says actor-writer Kent Skov , who is also the founder and director of the L.A. Connection . &quot; We all sit at_home and comment on what we see on TV . that ' s why watching this process is so_much fun . It ' s kind of like living_out the ( outlandish ) thoughts and scenarios that go_through people ' s minds while they watch TV or movies. &quot; Tonight at the Nuart Theatre , the troupe will present its version of the 1962 film , &quot; Wrestling Women vs . the Aztec Mummy. &quot; This obscure piece of cinema is every bit as cheesy as its title suggests . In the original film , a mummy rises from the dead and attempts to reclaim a necklace taken from its crypt by a team of women wrestlers . In the L.A. Connection version , Skov and company up the camp quotient by throwing into the film ' s wrestling motif a wedding , a honeymoon at a theme park called Aztecland , a love-struck mummy and a stream of wacky jokes . * This performance will represent the sixth time the L.A. Connection has tackled &quot; Wrestling Women vs . the Aztec Mummy. &quot; But like all its films that receive repeat performances , the script will be updated to reflect current social topics . The L.A. Connection delivered its first live film presentation in 1982 . It occurred after Terry Thoren , who was then an executive of the Landmark Theater chain , asked the group to do a performance of the 1958 B movie , &quot; Attack of the 50 Ft . Woman , &quot; at the old Fox Venice theater . &quot; We only had one week to prepare_for that performance , &quot; recalls Skov . &quot; There wasn ' t a videotape of the movie available , so we had to rent a 16mm projector to use during rehearsals . It was a nightmare trying to wind the projector back and forth &quot; so they could map_out the dialogue for each scene . &quot; But we sold_out the performance and did an encore three weeks later to 600 people . We figured we had something exciting because we couldn ' t always sell_out 40 or 45 seats in our own theater ( in Sherman Oaks ) doing conventional improv comedy. &quot; Since then , the L.A. Connection has turned film dubbing into a virtual art_form . The troupe tailors its dialogue so that it closely matches the lip movements of the characters on the screen . This can be a laborious process , says Skov , since the group is trying to achieve this sense of reality while attempting to develop a script that ' s involving and funny . The improv group also tries to keep each of its performances under 90 minutes . With some longer films , Skov will take_out an entire 20-minute reel rather than selectively edit a work in a way that some might find objectionable . However , during a performance of the film &quot; The Hunchback of Notre Dame , &quot; a projectionist once included and excluded the wrong reels . This left the actors scrambling to whip_up new dialogue on the spot . * A similar predicament developed during a presentation of &quot; Andy Warhol ' s Frankenstein. &quot; &quot; We had planned to do the R-rated version of the movie but ( the distributor ) sent us the X-rated version by mistake , &quot; remembers Skov . &quot; Because we had screened the uncut X-rated version a_couple_of times prior to deciding to do the R-rated version , we were familiar_with some of the additional scenes that came_up . But it was a shock that we had to improvise for 20 minutes . Boy , that really threw us for a loop ! &quot; Skov feels the L.A. Connection is actually better known and appreciated in a number of cities outside of the Los Angeles area . Thanks to the group ' s television appearances , it has managed to develop solid followings in cities such_as Detroit , Tucson and Denver . The improv group first gained national attention in 1983 when it landed a regular spot dubbing film_clips on Alan Thicke ' s short-lived &quot; Thicke of the Night &quot; variety_show . Two years later it had its own syndicated TV series called &quot; Mad Movies. &quot; But poor ratings contributed to the program ' s demise in 1986 , though episodes of the group ' s dubbed movies did subsequently reappear on several cable networks . Last November , the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network also aired a one-hour L.A. Connection special called &quot; Movie Madness Mystery. &quot; &quot; I would absolutely love to do more TV , &quot; Skov says . &quot; We ' ve done syndicated and cable TV . A network series would be the last step . If we got that kind of exposure , we would be that close to becoming a household name. &quot; * The L.A. Connection will perform &quot; Wrestling Women vs . the Aztec Mummy &quot; tonight at the Nuart Theatre , 11272 Santa Monica Blvd. , West Los Angeles , at 8 p.m. Admission $ 10 .
