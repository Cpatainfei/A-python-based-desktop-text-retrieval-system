   <HEADLINE> GOOD COOKING : FISH FIRSTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First courses traditionally act_as an introduction to a dinner_party . But they can double as lunch or supper dishes , becoming &quot; little meals. &quot; Seafood is a logical choice for this kind of dining . It ' s satisfying , yet not heavy , especially when combined with vegetables and greens . Consider the following recipes , which make lively , light presentations . Soft-shell crabs signify spring . Here , they are plumped_in buttermilk and fried crisp and served on watercress or arugula leaves with a lime wedge and a lime dressing . Bay_scallops sauteed in a ginger dressing and tossed with chilled haricots verts make an appealing Asian-inspired first course in which hot plays against cold . Smoked salmon is chopped and mixed with fennel , shallots and fresh dill , then mounded on endive &quot; fingers &quot; and arranged on mixed greens . * One practical note : It ' s essential to buy the freshest seafood and to cook it just through and no more . Scallops should retain their natural juices and are especially disappointing when they ' re overcooked . * Soft-shell crabs look complicated , but nothing could be further from the truth . Once they are cleaned_out by the fishmonger , they ' re almost effortless to cook . Plumping them up in buttermilk gives the soft-shells great taste and a fuller appearance . The tang of the watercress or arugula goes well with the crab .
