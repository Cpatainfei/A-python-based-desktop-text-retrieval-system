The 130-mile Four Corners Pipe Line , which connects Kern County oil fields to South Bay refineries , had been scheduled to reopen by May 1.But executives of Atlantic Richfield Co. , which owns the line , decided to put repairs on hold to further study costs and safety issues . ARCO spokesman Scott Loll said the company is considering a number of options regarding the 70-year-old pipeline -- including shutting_down for good the 54-mile stretch that runs under densely populated communities between Newhall and Carson . During January ' s 6.8 temblor , the 10-inch diameter pipe ruptured in several places . A spill into the Santa Clara River near Valencia killed hundreds of fish and birds and a leak in San Fernando fueled fires along Wolfskill Street that destroyed cars and homes and seriously injured a man .
