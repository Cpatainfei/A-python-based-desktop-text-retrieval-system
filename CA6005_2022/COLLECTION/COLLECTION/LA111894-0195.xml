   <HEADLINE> EPA REJECTS PERMANENT EVACUATION OVER DDT ; POLLUTION : AGENCY SAYS TESTS SHOW TOXIC LEVELS ARE LESS THAN FEARED . BUT ANGRY RESIDENTS WANT TO BE RELOCATED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After months of testing , federal_officials told a South Bay neighborhood Thursday night that they have found no reason residents should be permanently moved from a street where chunks of buried DDT were found last spring . But the residents lashed_out at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , maintaining again that their neighborhood is contaminated with chemicals from two nearby toxic sites . Federal testing has turned_up traces of DDT and another pesticide in household dust inside 25 homes along West 204th Street near Torrance , and more tests are needed to determine if the pesticides pose a health risk to residents , the EPA reported Thursday . But after months of sampling soil , air and tap_water , agency officials say they are encouraged that chemical contamination on the street is less than residents feared . &quot; EPA believes it ' s pretty good news that we ' re coming_back to the community with , &quot; EPA Section Chief John Blevins said as he summarized the results of the $ 1.7-million of tests this summer and fall_in the neighborhood near two toxic chemical sites . Community leader Cynthia Babich vehemently disagreed , contending that the EPA deliberately is downplaying the test results . &quot; They should condemn this neighborhood and relocate the residents , and stop spending all that money testing . They ' ve tested enough , &quot; Babich said . The tests were begun after buried chunks of DDT were uncovered last spring behind the homes of Babich and a neighbor on the modest working-class street , alarming residents who have complained of nausea , rashes and dizziness that they fear are caused by chemicals . For months , 33 families from the street have been living_in cramped hotel_rooms and rented homes at federal expense while the EPA excavated the buried DDT and investigated for further chemical contamination . The street is flanked by two toxic sites : the former Montrose Chemical Corp. , once a major DDT manufacturer and now a federal Superfund site , and the Del Amo Study Area , once home to a synthetic_rubber factory and now a federal Superfund nominee . The test results included the discovery of DDT and another pesticide , benzene hexachloride ( BHC ) , in dust in 25 of the 28 homes tested . More tests are needed to determine the pesticides ' concentrations and whether they pose a health hazard , Blevins said . After investigating further , the EPA will decide whether to sample dust in other homes_in the area . Too_little is known to say if the DDT came from the Montrose plant or another source , such_as legal pesticide use , Blevins said . The DDT chunks found in two yards last spring were found mixed with fill that officials once feared could extend under a number of homes . But soil testing along the street has found that similar fill may exist in only four other yards , and more investigation of the six properties is planned . More study is also planned to determine why indoor air tests turned_up benzene at higher than normal levels in two homes . The EPA says it has no information connecting the benzene to either the Montrose or Del Amo sites .</TEXT>
