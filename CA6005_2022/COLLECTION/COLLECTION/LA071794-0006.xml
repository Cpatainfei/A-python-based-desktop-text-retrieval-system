   <TEXT> While reading about Dr. Eva Carrizales ' plight ( &quot; By a Doctor ' s Hand , &quot; by Barry Siegel , June 12 ) , I felt_like cradling her in my arms , much as she did that doomed child . This tragedy is a sterling example of why criminal_law and medicine should rarely intersect . When we bestow on a person the license to make daily life and death decisions , which has to be the most difficult job conceived , then that person must also be given greater latitude in making those decisions . A key mistake was that despite a peer_review finding that the baby ' s care was not &quot; below standards , &quot; the district_attorney went_ahead with a grand_jury proceeding . Allowing laymen to define criminal conduct begs for a poor result . I wish this story were required reading for every district_attorney . Maybe then , people such_as Dr. Carrizales would feel less threatened for trying to save lives and actualize compassion . STEVEN M . GOODMAN Encino As an oncology and home-health RN , I ' ve taken_care of many terminally ill patients . As doctors and nurses , it is our job to make these patients as comfortable as possible , not speed them on their way . Although I believe_in euthanasia , it is not legal in this country . No matter how compassionate Dr. Carrizales may be , she crossed the line . SHERRY OWENS Running Springs Every medical_examiner , coroner and district_attorney should be ordered to read &quot; By a Doctor ' s Hand. &quot; All that was needed at any one stage of that tragedy was for a single bureaucrat to say , &quot; The buck stops here. &quot; But at every stage , the bureaucrats instead bowed to the fear of criticism . The work of Dr. Carrizales is important in a society that must come_to grips with the rationing of health_care . We are all very reasonable in our discussion of such matters , until we have to make a decision . I grieve for Dr. Carrizales , who is a victim of cowardice . JAY HERBERT Encinitas No one likes to see people suffer , be they babies or adults . Doctors should allow people to end their lives and die with dignity . This decision should not be viewed_as giving those in the health-care profession the right to end any life . Rather , it supports the view that doctors should respect the dignity of patients and not use life-support systems to keep people alive . The courage that Dr. Carrizales has shown to let the baby die with dignity should be supported . Perhaps there will come a time in the near future when doctors will be able to make these decisions based on compassion rather than the law . DELLA WIDJAJA Los Angeles We treat a dying animal in the road with more respect and dignity than most terminal patients . Doctors are terrified of making the decisions that Eva Carrizales did , and when they do make them it is probably from the safety of their car phones . They do everything they can to remove themselves from the emotional reality of death . When was the last time a doctor held a dying infant in his or her arms in an attempt to help ease the pain and suffering of their final hours ? Perhaps the baby could have lived for another few days . But it ' s not about quantity of life , it ' s about quality . A good_deal of our medical crisis is precipitated by the &quot; life at any cost &quot; attitude of medical training . Until we have more doctors like Carrizales who are willing to make the really tough decisions , we will never be a &quot; civilized &quot; society . JOHN STOCKWELL Los Angeles Here was a human_being with no quality_of_life and with death imminent . So why the persecution of the kind and compassionate Dr. Carrizales ? Because she committed the sin of taking a defenseless human being out of the medical system , where the hospital and all its ancillary services could have had a financial bonanza . The right to die is one each human_being should have . The only people fighting this issue are , in the main , those who stand to gain financially by &quot; attending &quot; to those who have no chance of recovery . These people want to dictate to you and your loved ones just how you can die , even though it may mean more pain and suffering for you . ROBERT ARONOFF South Pasadena Siegel asks us whether a &quot; dignified , peaceful death &quot; is better than &quot; prolonged , gasping agony. &quot; Dignified for whom ? The baby ? The doctor ? How dare the author project his opinions on the baby ' s struggle for life . I could easily claim that the baby strived for life with vigor , perseverance and dignity , but his tiny chance was stripped away by the doctor . As a Christian nation , it is our duty to uphold the idea that all life is sacred , and that we are to preserve life to the very last second . The courts did just that . While the doctors waffled , the grand_jury -- the average citizenry -- upheld the law . RAUL E . ACOSTA Beverly Hills As a registered nurse , I feel compelled to respond to &quot; By a Doctor ' s Hand. &quot; The implication running_through the saga is that Carrizales was brought_down by nurses who were overly emotional , ignorant of the physiological stages of death and unable to maintain a professional relationship with Dr. Carrizales because of personality conflicts . That is ludicrous . Nurses ' own licenses are at risk . They cannot follow doctors ' orders blindly or observe doctors ' actions uncritically . The ethical , moral and legal obligation to protect the patient runs to medicine and nursing . And to imply that neonatal intensive-care nurses , who witness tragedy daily , do not understand the physiological stages of death is nonsense . Finally , to indicate that the incident would have gone unreported if Dr. Carrizales had been more of a buddy to the nurses is insulting . It is not necessary to like a doctor to respect his or her work . The nurses were simply complying with hospital policy and the law when they reported Dr. Carrizales . Anything less and they could have been defending their licenses . KATHLEEN WALSH La Canada</TEXT>
