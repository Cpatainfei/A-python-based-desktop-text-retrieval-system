   <HEADLINE> ENVIRONMENT ; SOFTWARE THAT TEACHES CHILDREN TO RESPECT THE PLANET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Children like being masters of all they survey , which is one reason they love computers . And makers of computer software who know that children are being taught not to abuse the planet have found a niche with pro-environment programs . Southland software stores report heavy sales of titles like &quot; SimCity 2000 , &quot; which was recently released and spurred by the success of the original &quot; SimCity , &quot; which has users fighting smog and leaky sewers as part of the computer_game . It challenges children to &quot; compete with neighboring cities , which will lure away citizens and industries if the city ' s business environment and quality_of_life decline. &quot; Sometimes called educational software , but often found on shelves alongside regular computer_games , these items are so popular that they sell nearly as well as the non-environmental educational sales champ Carmen Sandiego . &quot; SimCity 2000 &quot; has outstripped the champ in the past few days . &quot; We had a waiting list of maybe 30 people before the game even came_out , &quot; said software department manager Mirko Minaya of the Redondo Beach CompUSA store . He estimates that the store has sold 200 copies in four days . This trend has not been lost on savvy parents who are looking_for a way to get Junior away from television and into an activity that will improve his grades or give him a head_start in the job market . Enter Futurekids , the private after-school computer class offering . This franchised operation started_out to be a sort of American answer to juku , a Japanese intensive private tutoring program . According to Rene Tabor , director of Futurekids of South Bay , children really like environmental software . &quot; Our program is really theme-based . When we were dealing with environmental issues , they really liked it , &quot; she said . Next month , a curriculum with the clever name of Megabyte Zoo will be offered , involving exercises such_as this : The tyro computer whiz must &quot; properly define the type of food , plants and temperatures the animals need to survive and remove any trash or pollution from the animal habitats . Times staff writer Anne Louise Bannon contributed to this story . TO FIND THEM Futurekids computer schools in the South Bay area are located in Torrance , Manhattan Beach and San Pedro . Environmental computer_programs can be found at computer software retailers . Among the titles children enjoy most are &quot; Zookeeper , &quot; &quot; Zug ' s Dinosaur World , &quot; &quot; Nigel ' s World , &quot; &quot; Eco-Saurus , &quot; &quot; Eco-Quest &quot; and &quot; SimCity 2000. &quot;</TEXT>
