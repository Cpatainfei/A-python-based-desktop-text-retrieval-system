   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA : DEALS IN SMOKE-FILLED ROOMS COULD HELP CLEAR THE REGION ' S AIR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Editor ' s note : Starting today , James Flanigan ' s Wednesday columns will focus_on business and economic trends and issues in Southern California . Now that the election is mercifully over , we can turn_to really urgent matters facing the Southern California economy . No , not immigration or nannies or campaign spending , but a regional clean air plan that must be augmented and approved by Gov . Pete Wilson and the California Air Resources Board and sent to Washington by Tuesday . There the Sacramento plan must be accepted quickly by the federal_government as meeting the requirements of the Clean Air Act . Deadlines are tight and the consequences for missing them potentially severe . They include a withering of the Port of Los Angeles-Long Beach , loss of tens of thousands of jobs and a decidedly gloomier future for the five-county economy of Southern California . And that ' s no overstatement . But for the moment , disaster has been averted . The region is dodging a bullet thanks to unprecedented cooperation among politicians , air quality overseers and environmental and industry officials who came_up with a compromise response to a court-ordered regimen that would have crippled commerce . Indeed the cooperation is the most promising development to come_out of a comedy of errors and omissions that began with a 1988 lawsuit by environmentalists challenging the region ' s compliance with anti-pollution laws . The lawsuit persisted , like a tale from Dickens , through one court after another and came_back last February to bite Los Angeles , Orange , San Bernardino , Riverside and Ventura counties . The U.S. Supreme Court ruled_in effect that the federal Environmental Protection Agency must draw_up a plan to clean Southern California ' s air because local_government and industry had not done so or could not . The resulting federal implementation plan , or FIP , focused particularly on emissions from trucks , ships and planes , which operate in interstate and international commerce and had been beyond the authority of the local Air Quality Management District . The proposed regulations were jolting . They imposed heavy taxes on emissions by shipping_companies and airlines and required trucking_companies to replace diesel_engines . &quot; If those rules were in_effect right now , ships would have to steam 100 miles offshore and shippers would have to pay $ 300 million a year in extra fees , &quot; says Gordon Palmer , manager of planning for the Long_Beach section of the Port . Freight would shift to the ports of San Francisco-Oakland or Seattle or Ensenada , Mexico . Under the FIP , Los Angeles and its region would fade as a crossroads for trade with Asia and Latin_America . The Alameda Corridor -- the proposed rail and truck route through the city -- would not be built &quot; because the volume of freight would be inadequate to sustain it , &quot; Palmer says . In trucking , smaller firms would go_out of business and trucks coming from out of state would be restricted to a single stop in Southern California . Some airlines , notably TWA , would have to stop flying into Los Angeles because they couldn ' t afford new planes . Sadly , the region ' s initial reaction to such baleful prospects was argument and name-calling . Business was &quot; crying wolf &quot; ; environmentalists were &quot; anti-jobs. &quot; But EPA saved the day by asking_for specific analyses of the regulations ' economic consequences , says Patricia O ' Toole , an environmental partner in the Los Angeles law_firm Lamb &amp; O ' Toole . The Port , airport and local industries supplied analyses that sobered the discussion . The total tab would be $ 5.4 billion a year in new costs imposed on business in a regional economy struggling to emerge from recession . &quot; The FIP regulations would not have been the most cost-effective way to clean the air , &quot; says Jane Hall , an economist at California State University , Fullerton . The threat was so stark that it softened resistance by environmentalists and regulators and allowed Mayor Richard Riordan ' s office to produce a compromise solution , one that essentially meets present federal requirements but allows a little more time to meet 1997 standards for soot-like particulate pollutants and for the nitrous_oxides in ozone . The compromise allows more leeway for transporters to operate while anti-pollution technology is developing . The politically correct stance for all parties was to work_on the compromise and support the economy . &quot; We are_after a prosperous economy like everybody else , &quot; says Denny Zane , head of the Coalition for Clean Air , one of the organizations that brought the original 1988 lawsuit . &quot; We worked to save industry , &quot; says Norton Younglove , a Riverside County supervisor and governor of the South Coast AQMD . Peace is wonderful , but are they compromising the public health ? Southern California ' s air problem is extreme , with 27 % more lung-scarring ozone than Houston and 51 % more_than New York City . Ventura County has lower ozone , but its air also is below the requirements of the Clean Air Act . But no , the compromise on environmental plans does not threaten health ; it merely buys_time , until 1997 , to find solutions that are not readily available today . Indeed , work_on low-emission truck engines and zero-emission automobiles will have to be pressed with even greater vigor now . that ' s because the threat is far from over , say environmental experts . First , the state ' s Air Resources Board , in meetings the next two days , must add_to this region ' s plan to make_it acceptable to the federal_government . Then state and federal deadlines must be met or Southern California could find itself next February under a court_order to submit to the Draconian strictures it has dodged to date by ingenuity and compromise . Chances are , most deadlines will be met , although some delays may cause temporary sanctions on business in our region . However , times may have changed . The cooperation on solutions to regulatory problems that has characterized recent months could become a healthy habit . The Mayor ' s office , local industry and environmentalists may well get_together on other problems . In that sense , the FIP regulations -- like chest_pains that prompt more exercise and better diet -- will be seen as a useful adversity for having launched a new work-together spirit in a region blessed by geography as the gateway to Asia and Latin_America . Of course , exercise without chest_pains and cooperation without a hangman ' s noose is always wiser .</TEXT>
