   <HEADLINE> COALITION GOVERNMENT IN IRELAND FALLS APART ; POLITICS : A JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT BY PRIME_MINISTER SPURRED COLLAPSE . IT IS NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT ULSTER CEASE-FIRE DIRECTLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ireland ' s coalition government collapsed Wednesday night , just as it was making strides toward peace in Northern_Ireland . Deputy Prime_Minister Dick Spring , head of the Labor_Party , announced that he and six Labor members of Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds ' Cabinet were resigning . Further , Spring declared that his 32-member party will cast ballots against Reynolds in a parliamentary vote_of_confidence scheduled for today -- which would formally end the government coalition . &quot; Neither I nor any of my colleagues can vote confidence in this government , &quot; Spring said . The failure of the government -- the result of a dispute over a judicial appointment -- had no roots in the Northern_Ireland peace process and is not expected to directly affect the recent cease-fire that ended 25 years of sectarian violence in the province . However , political observers noted that Sinn Fein , the political arm of Northern_Ireland ' s outlawed Irish_Republican_Army , has been closer over the years to Reynolds ' party , Fianna Fail , than to the leading opposition party , Fine Gael . Sinn Fein said late Wednesday that it regretted the failure of the_Irish government and will continue to work with all parties toward a lasting peace . After today ' s expected no-confidence vote , President Mary Robinson will decide whether to call new national elections or ask the various party leaders whether they can form a new government . The crisis could last several days or longer while party leaders negotiate , because most politicians oppose new elections since the Fianna Fail-Labor government is less than 2 years old . Coalition wrangling had already dragged_on for weeks after recent national elections . Spring ' s resignation came_after the most dramatic and confusing parliamentary session in memory . The Labor_Party leader effectively accused Reynolds of lying_in a statement to the Parliament on Tuesday about his controversial appointment of former Atty . Gen . Harry Whelehan as president of the High_Court , a post similar to that of chief_justice of the U.S. Supreme Court . The immediate crisis began with Reynolds ' decision last week to name Whelehan to the post -- a decision opposed by his Labor coalition partners because they considered Whelehan ' s record far too conservative on social issues . Further , Labor argued , Whelehan took seven months to decide that a Roman_Catholic priest should be extradited to Northern_Ireland on charges of child_abuse -- possibly for political reasons , his opponents suggested . The priest , Father Brendan Smyth , has since been jailed in Northern_Ireland . Whelehan was also involved in prohibiting a 14-year-old rape victim from going_to England for an abortion in 1992 . Reynolds , an autocratic leader , insisted on pushing_through Whelehan ' s appointment in the face of massive opposition , and he attempted to explain his action in Wednesday ' s parliamentary session . But his performance was bumbling and marked by pleas for adjournment while he reconsidered his position . Finally , he admitted that Whelehan had been less than frank with him in explaining the extradition delay and said the reservations of the Labor_Party coalition partners were &quot; fully justified. &quot; In Dublin , there was speculation that President Robinson will ask Spring to consider forming a coalition with the center-right Fine Gael party under its leader , John Bruton , or with Fianna Fail under someone other_than Reynolds . Political observers said that despite Reynolds ' ineptitude as a coalition leader , he has been pivotal in the Northern_Ireland peace effort , particularly in building bridges to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams . Reynolds pressed British Prime_Minister John Major to hasten the peace process by accepting the current Northern_Ireland cease-fire as permanent and to begin all-party talks , even with those representing paramilitary groups . In London , one Foreign Office official said of the Dublin developments : &quot; The Downing Street Declaration which started the peace process is between the_British and Irish governments -- not between particular leaders. &quot;</TEXT>
