   <HEADLINE> NAVY HOLDS MANDATORY SEMINARS ABOUT AIDS ; DISEASE : OFFICIALS SAY THE TWO-HOUR SESSIONS , FOR SAILORS AND CIVILIANS , DETAIL SAFE-SEX PRACTICES AND OTHER WAYS TO PREVENT SPREAD OF VIRUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an effort to combat the spread of the deadly AIDS virus , Navy officials this month ordered about 15 # 000 sailors and civilian employees stationed in Ventura County to undergo a mandatory seminar on prevention of the disease . The two-hour session , which all sailors and civilian workers must attend by Dec . 1 , details safe-sex practices and other ways to prevent the spread of the virus , Navy officials said . The seminar covers what is known about the disease , risk factors , the rights of employees with the chronic illness and the Navy ' s AIDS testing and anti-discrimination policies . The AIDS awareness seminars are put_on by Navy medical personnel with the help of volunteer instructors from the American Red_Cross . To meet the Dec . 1 deadline , the Red_Cross is training an additional dozen instructors to help with the seminars for the estimated 6 # 500 uniformed personnel and 8 # 500 civilian workers . &quot; It ' s a very big task , but it is also an exciting challenge , &quot; said Susan Habel , HIV / AIDS education chairman and training coordinator for the Ventura County chapter of the American Red_Cross . &quot; We are limiting the class size to no more_than 50 people at a time so you can see how many sessions we are going_to have to hold , &quot; Habel said . * Habel has spent months preparing_for the sessions at the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme and the Naval Air Weapons Station at Point Mugu . &quot; The nice thing is that we have received a lot of support from the local commanders . They realize how important this project is. &quot; Navy officials said the program is part of the federal Workplace HIV / AIDS Education Initiative issued by President Clinton last spring . That initiative was made the policy of the Navy and Marine Corps earlier this summer by Navy_Secretary John H . Dalton . Dalton , in a memorandum issued last May to all base commanders , stated that the numbers of military_personnel contracting the human_immunodeficiency_virus -- the precursor to AIDS -- are growing within the ranks nationwide . &quot; The facts are : Each year 300 active duty Navy and Marine Corps personnel become infected with HIV , and an increasing number of dependents are being infected as well , &quot; Dalton wrote . &quot; Commands must make a firm commitment to educate all personnel about HIV / AIDS if we are to prevent the spread of this disease , dispel myths and reduce deaths. &quot; The first wave of seminars began last week at both bases . &quot; I found ( the training seminar ) very informative , &quot; said Marge Hays , a Navy spokeswoman at Point Mugu . Hays said the instructor wasted no time in explaining specific ways the virus can and cannot be spread , and the proper use of condoms . &quot; If everybody educated their work_force to this extent , I don ' t think we would have the size problem we do with this disease today , &quot; she said . &quot; They really got_down to the nitty-gritty and provided us with some useful information. &quot; At the end of each session , each person in_attendance also receives a referral list of local agencies that provide counseling and other services for those who have contracted the virus .</TEXT>
