   <TEXT> Thinking_about planting a &quot; For Sale &quot; sign_in front of your house ? Better tour some model homes first . Then reach for the paint_roller , wallpaper remover and the phone_numbers of your favorite home improvement professionals . Orange County ' s recession-battered resale market is so competitive , real_estate_agents say , that successful sellers these days are the ones who make their properties look_like model homes . &quot; There are so many others for buyers to choose from . Sellers are competing with one another and with new-home builders , &quot; said Tom Nash of Re / Max of Irvine , who specializes in residential sales . Agents who once simply advised sellers to clean_out their closets and put_on soft music to sway buyers now offer computerized lists of suggested improvements . Some refer their clients to interior_designers to get a fresh perspective . At the minimum , today ' s sellers find themselves cleaning , rearranging furniture , uncluttering and depersonalizing their homes before they are listed . Others install new carpeting , remove wallpaper , repaint walls , redo kitchen countertops and send appliances out for refinishing . Some determined sellers replace old aluminum sliding doors with French_doors , install new chandeliers or add electric fireplaces . Homeowners who want to sell are competing with the architecture of the ' 90s -- clerestory windows , plant ledges , dramatic high ceilings and lots of light , open spaces , Nash said . &quot; We are very specific , even adamant about things that need to be changed . When you take a car that ' s been off-road to a dealership , they don ' t put it on the lot that way . Each home should have a good going over , a detailing , &quot; he said . Sellers must decide how much time and money they can or will spend polishing_up the place , weighing factors such_as cash available , need for repairs , condition of competing properties and importance of a timely sale . Many of the basics that designers and real_estate_agents recommend -- such_as painting and removing clutter -- are not costly , though . To help give their lived-in abodes the look of a model home , some sellers are hiring interior_designers who specialize in redecorating for resale . Interior_designer Joan Linder of Newport Beach is among those who will analyze a house and present the owner with a checklist of recommendations to make_it more attractive to buyers . Walter Nutting , also an interior_designer , specializes in resale work as well . For years , he has worked_on high-end properties on the Newport Beach market , but lately owners of properties in the medium price range are also seeking help , he said . Designers typically charge $ 50 to $ 100 per hour , but some offer their services to home sellers for a set fee that may be lower . What they offer , they say , is a fresh look_at your house -- a place you may be too comfortable with to see_through the eyes of a potential buyer . In a Mission Viejo home that had been_on the market for six months , Linder spent five hours rearranging the furniture . She added a_few new accessories , but the key change was eliminating unneeded furniture , creating conversational groupings and incorporating the stereo equipment that had lined the walls into existing bookcases . When the owner returned , she couldn ' t believe it was the same house , Linder said . It sold within two weeks . &quot; Just balance and proportion can do so_much . Sometimes all you have to do is rearrange the pictures and lamps and create an intimate setting , &quot; she said . She often does more_than that , though . For one client , Linder began on the outside to make an older house look larger and more modern . She had the brown trim , brick columns and side fences painted white to blend with the ivory stucco . Inside she added a focal_point for the living room , an electric fireplace with black marble hearth and mantel . Some furniture was rented to complete the look ; carpets were cleaned , and a soft drapery top was added_to vertical blinds in the living room . The house sold in four weeks , she said . In this case , money spent on improvements boosted the house into a higher sales bracket . But in most cases , improvements made to market the house are just going_to put it one step ahead of the competition , Nutting said . If you are going_to spend money , Nutting says it should be spent on the background . His advice : Invest in an inexpensive carpet that looks clean and new , bright , white paint , strategically placed blooming plants at the entrance and perhaps one piece_of_furniture in the right spot . Many real_estate_agents are quick to point_out that sellers today often have financial problems and can ' t afford to spend money on pre-sale improvements . Agents are seeing a lot of deferred maintenance now that they haven ' t seen in the past , said Mission Viejo-based Nancy Gromme of Century 21 Freedom Realty Group . Although sales and buyer interest are up , prices are soft , and in many cases the sales price barely covers the sellers ' loan , said Cherie Hartman , branch manager of Coldwell Banker ' s Dana Point-San Clemente office . In those cases , the sales agents agree that the best thing to do is spend whatever you can to make the outside look attractive , clean the inside and remove clutter , personal items and large pieces_of_furniture . Carlos Herrera of Casa Blanca Realtors in Orange tells his clients not to spend too_much on major remodeling because they are not going_to recoup that money in the form of a higher sales price . Buyers , particularly in the older areas of the county where Herrera concentrates his efforts , are making very low offers , he said . He says money is_better spent on a professional home inspection so sellers will know what they need to repair . &quot; Buyers nowadays bring_in their own inspectors to find leaks under the sink , loose toilets and improper wiring in the garage . The sellers may_not want to fix everything , but at least they ' ll be aware of it &quot; and be one step ahead of the potential buyer , he said . After making decisions about repairs , you can concentrate_on making your house look its best with these tips from designers and real_estate_agents : * Open_up spaces and make rooms look bigger by putting excess furniture in storage . Nutting says houses actually sell better when they are empty . &quot; People are looking_at your furniture and family pictures instead of the house , &quot; he said . Others , however , say it ' s better to have some furniture , even if you just create a fireplace grouping with a wing_chair , table and lamp . * Let_in more light and update the room by taking_down heavy window coverings . If there ' s a view , simply leave the windows bare so buyers can see it . If not , add window coverings that are light and inexpensive . * Consider having appliances from another era refinished . Linder said it costs about $ 125 to refinish a refrigerator , an update she says is often worth the investment . * Create focal_points in rooms . Some homes have no focal_points , and others have too many , Linder said . Simply putting a bright floral arrangement on a table can create a focal_point . A strategically placed folding screen can eliminate focal_points in a room with too many windows and doors . * Take the emphasis off problem spots by directing the viewer ' s eye elsewhere . If a floor is not in good_shape , put_down an area rug to create a focal_point . * Buy a new blanket in a compatible color and lay it corner to corner over a shabby bedspread , suggests Laguna Niguel interior_designer Betty D . Hyde , who has done a lot of resale design work . You get a new look_for a small price , she said . * Clean chrome bathroom_fixtures with lemon_oil to make them sparkle or buy new fixtures , Hyde recommends . She suggests buying a_few new towels in fresh , bright colors and using scented bath_oil often to make the whole house smell good . * Many designers advise painting dark woods white for a more contemporary look . Dark carpeting also has to go , according to Nash . And while you ' ve got the paint out , Nutting advises , remember to paint the insides of cabinets as well . * Make a small bedroom look larger by unifying elements . In one house , Linder used a decorative screen to cover a window and repeated the screen on a nearby wall . Large-scale pictures also make a room look bigger , she said . * When it ' s time to show the house , make_sure the dishes are put_away , the toilet_seats are down and soft music is playing .</TEXT>
