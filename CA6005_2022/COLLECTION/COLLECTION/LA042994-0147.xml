   <HEADLINE> MY TURN : O.C. HIGH : STUDENT NEWS &amp; VIEWS ; CASTING A VOTE FOR SOUTH_AFRICA ' S FUTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To allow South_African citizens in this country to vote_in their nation ' s first all-race election , polling_places were established at 20 locations in the United States , including one in Irvine . The election marks the end of four decades of apartheid and 300 years of white-only rule_in South_Africa . For the first time , I felt_like an adult -- and an alien . As my dad and I stood_in line at the Irvine Civic Center to vote_in South_Africa ' s first free election Tuesday , I listened to the accents around me . They were familiar South_African voices , yet they made me uncomfortable . I felt_like I had no right_to_vote in this election . I was born in South_Africa , and I am 18 years old , but I consider myself an American . Nevertheless , those voices excited me because they reminded me of my relatives , of the times I spent in South_Africa and of the fact that I was about to take_part in a historic event . My dad and I continued to stand_in line . We had already been there for half an hour . The line had barely inched forward . It was 7:05 p.m. , and the polls were supposed to close at 7 . At 7:10 a man from the embassy told us that he was sorry , but that because the polls were closing , we would all have to squish into the voting room . He apologized and explained the situation twice , but nothing came of his little speech . The line continued to inch forward slowly . My dad and I reached the door and read the sample ballot posted on the glass . There was a long list of names with a picture beside each and an empty box to the right for you to signify your choice . There were also maps of the various regions in South_Africa . My dad explained that I would vote once nationally , and then once by region , ours being the Western Cape . * Finally we got inside . I was asked to place my right_hand under a blue light to check that I had not previously voted . Then I was asked to show identification . Because I left South_Africa when I was 3 years old , I did not have my own passport , but I was named on my mother ' s . The gentleman at the desk told me that I would have been required to fill_out a temporary voter ' s card , but they had run_out . Meanwhile , the man in front of me -- one of the few black South_Africans at the polling_place -- was having a difficult time . I heard him say that he was from the Transkei . His only ID was an old , brown piece_of_paper . When the gentleman behind the desk asked if he had a birth_certificate , he laughed and repeated that he was from the Transkei -- an African tribal homeland that does not issue birth_certificates or other conventional identification papers . I found it somewhat ironic that even in this free election , it was difficult for this man to vote . I moved through the line , getting closer and closer to my voting opportunity . My right_hand was sprayed with invisible ink and then placed under a blue light . This ensured that I was marked and could not vote again . I was handed a ballot and an envelope and sent to a voting_booth . The booth itself was a large cardboard box with a piece of black plastic in the front for privacy . I made my selection and placed my ballot in the envelope . Then I went_to another table marked with each province . I received another ballot and envelope , both of which were stamped &quot; Western Cape. &quot; I went_to another booth and voted again . Then I put the envelopes with my votes_in the ballot_box , which was monitored by a security_guard . It was official . I had just voted_in South_Africa ' s first free election . My vote will become a part of international history , and the experience will remain with me forever .</TEXT>
