   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ENERGY CALLS OFF BID FOR RIVAL MAGMA POWER ; TAKEOVER : INSUFFICIENT NUMBER OF SAN DIEGO GEOTHERMAL COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS TENDERED STOCK IN RESPONSE TO $ 38.50-PER-SHARE OFFER . HOSTILE SUITOR HINTS AT LEGAL ACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California Energy Co . called_off its hostile $ 924-million takeover_bid for rival geothermal energy producer Magma Power on Friday after an insufficient number of Magma shareholders tendered stock in response to its $ 38.50-per-share offer . Omaha-based California Energy , which set a deadline of midnight Friday to receive Magma shares , would not disclose how many shares were tendered . The hostile suitor also solicited consent forms to call a special shareholder meeting to review its offer but only 41 % of Magma shareholders had agreed to the meeting as of Friday . But the last shot may_not have been fired in the high stakes takeover battle involving the nation ' s two largest geothermal companies . In a news release , California Energy accused Magma executives of a &quot; blatant breach of fiduciary obligations , &quot; hinting at further legal_action . San Diego-based Magma Power officials would not comment late Friday on the California Energy announcement . A spokesman said warily that the company was &quot; studying &quot; the news release . California Energy shares closed_up 50 cents at $ 16.50 in New York Stock_Exchange trading while Magma Power shares were up 75 cents at $ 35.50 in over-the-counter trading . California Energy announced the termination after the markets closed Friday . In its news release , California Energy said its effort to call a special shareholder meeting was stymied by the refusal of Magma ' s two largest shareholders to submit consent forms . Those investors were Dow Chemical , which owns 21 % of Magma shares , , and the B.C. McCabe Foundation , which owns 12 % . The takeover battle began Sept . 19 when California Energy wrote Magma Power ' s board of directors offering $ 35 a share , or $ 840 million in_stock and cash for the company . A merger would create the world ' s largest geothermal concern and give it a strong position in the newly competitive worldwide power market , California Energy Chairman David Sokol said . California Energy launched its bid on Oct . 6 , offering $ 35 cash for the first 51 % of Magma shares tendered . In response , Magma Power launched a strenuous effort to persuade large institutional stockholders to ignore California Energy ' s offer , saying it was &quot; opportunistic &quot; and that Magma shares soon would be worth more because of new projects planned in the Philippines and Indonesia . Magma said last month that it was holding discussion with other companies about possible business combinations . After several analysts predicted California Energy would have to up its bid to $ 40 a share to succeed , California increased its offer in early November to $ 38.50 per share , apparently to no avail .</TEXT>
