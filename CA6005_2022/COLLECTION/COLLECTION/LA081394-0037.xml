   <HEADLINE> DAVID AND GOLIATH TRY TO MAKE NICE ; TAIPEI AND BEIJING SIGN AN UNPRECEDENTED COOPERATION PACT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taiwan is one of America ' s important trading partners and one of China ' s most successful neighbors . Beijing is_well aware of both these facts . Now , after eight days of delicate talks , Beijing and Taipei -- both of which claim to be the government of all_of China -- have reached a breakthrough agreement to resolve a number of outstanding bilateral issues , including the tricky ones of airline hijackings , illegal immigrants and fishing disputes . It is the first substantive cooperative effort between China and Taiwan , which have had no formal diplomatic relations since the Nationalist Chinese forces fled the mainland in 1949 . Yes , the two governments were ever so careful to steer wide of the touchy subjects of sovereignty and reunification , major stumbling_blocks in the past . Nonetheless , the accord is a significant development . The attempt to start a political dialogue began in Singapore last year . Although Taipei remains understandably obstinate in its resistance to Beijing efforts to reunify , and the mainland stubbornly refuses to recognize the Kuomintang government on Taiwan , the growing trade and investment ties between the two are matters of mutual economic self-interest . The increased contacts have helped to foster mutual goodwill . However , relations , which actually had been improving since the mid-1980s , were put to a severe test by a dozen hijackings of Chinese airlines to Taiwan since April , 1993 . Relations deteriorated to their lowest level this spring after 24 Taiwanese tourists were killed in an arson attack in southern China ; a subsequent attempt to cover_up the murders fueled anti-China sentiments in Taiwan . Image-conscious Beijing , eager to encourage more investment , trade and tourism -- and to restore a sense of security about its airline service -- was willing to make limited concessions to Taipei . Beijing will accept Taiwan ' s authority over Chinese hijackers and its right to determine who is to be repatriated and who may remain in Taiwan for political or religious reasons . China also agreed to pay the costs of detaining and repatriating illegal immigrants from the mainland whose return had been delayed by China . As for fishing , government vessels from both sides will be allowed to mediate disputes between boats . Not too long ago an agreement between Taipei and Beijing on any matter was unimaginable . But China and Taiwan are increasingly pragmatic . In the breakthrough pact they endorse &quot; increasing communication &quot; that will &quot; eliminate misapprehensions , reduce differences and nurture trust. &quot; That sounds like an adult formula for a better relationship between two important Pacific Rim countries with robust economies that won ' t be denied .</TEXT>
