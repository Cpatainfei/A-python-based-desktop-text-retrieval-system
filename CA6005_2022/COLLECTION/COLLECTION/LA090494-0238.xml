   <HEADLINE> SIERRA CLUB SUIT PUTS DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS TO THE TEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Sierra Club lawsuit aimed at shrinking a massive Thousand Oaks housing project could help ensure that cities statewide do not bargain away their legal obligation to protect the environment , government and legal analysts say . The suit , filed recently against Thousand Oaks , says that the city signed a deal allowing developers to build 2 # 350 homes on the rolling hills overlooking Newbury Park before it had fully considered the project ' s potential for environmental damage . Sierra Club attorneys argue that part of the 4 # 500-acre Dos Vientos Ranch development would seal_off a critical wildlife corridor and could endanger dozens of plant and animal species in the surrounding Santa Monica Mountains . If the environmental group prevails , the ruling would force Thousand Oaks -- and perhaps all California cities -- to perform more comprehensive environmental reviews before signing development agreements , government analysts say . In addition , it would demand that cities enforce , as part of their deals with developers , contract provisions that say a project ' s size can be reduced if it threatens residents or the environment . &quot; The state law says you need to look before you leap , &quot; said Stephan Volker , a Sierra Club attorney . &quot; I think the risk inherent in the development agreement process is that the city will grant approvals before they have all_the facts . that ' s what happened in Thousand Oaks. &quot; Development agreements -- contracts between government and builders -- have been legal in California for 15 years . Thousand Oaks city officials say they are valuable tools , since they guarantee builders that when local political winds change , the requirements for their projects will not . &quot; There were several cases where developers sank millions of dollars into a project , they received tentative approvals from the city , and a couple years down the line , a new council came_along and said no , &quot; Thousand Oaks City Atty . Mark Sellers said . &quot; Developers wanted a way to be certain that once they started down the road , they would not be forced to turn_back , &quot; he said . In exchange for the guarantees , the developers typically offer cities lucrative packages that include cash , land and promises to build schools , parks and other public amenities . In 1990 , Thousand Oaks agreed to allow construction of the Dos Vientos development in exchange for $ 12 million , 1 # 000 acres of open space and a host of other public improvements . But enticements create the risk that cities such_as Thousand Oaks will rush to sign the deals without thoroughly examining the potential for violating state environmental laws , the Sierra Club ' s Volker argued . Because of that risk , he said , the public needs stronger assurances that the environment will be protected . Thousand Oaks officials said that the lucrative Dos Vientos deal in no way kept them from performing proper reviews . &quot; This was not building for dollars , &quot; said Mike Sangster , city deputy planning director . &quot; The environmental concerns were thoroughly examined well before we signed the agreement. &quot; In fact , the city and the public reviewed the project well before the development agreement was signed , he said . Purchased in 1982 by Pasadena-based Operating Engineers , the developer first wanted to build 3 # 900 homes . Six years later , after dozens of public hearings and a two-volume environmental analysis , the City_Council conceptually approved 2 # 350 homes . Since the final compromise agreement was signed_in 1990 , construction of about 400 homes_in two other Dos Vientos subdivisions has begun . In April , however , the city issued a new environmental report on a third Dos Vientos subdivision , because the original analysis was more_than five years old . The report identified several new problems with the 220-house project . The report said some of the new houses would be too close to an earthquake fault and to power poles , findings disputed by the developer as baseless . It also said the project would have a greater impact than previously thought on noise , traffic and native plants and animals . After reviewing the report , council_members agreed to take some steps to reduce risks from the earthquake fault and power poles but decided not to cut the number of homes . &quot; The reason that was not proposed is because , under the agreement , the city is legally obligated to allow that density , &quot; Sellers said . &quot; We can do a number of things to help mitigate problems with the development , but we can ' t go_back and change the major points of the agreement. &quot; Sierra Club attorneys say Sellers is wrong . They argue that the city is required by state environmental law to consider all possible solutions , including density reduction . The problem , explained Ventura planning analyst William Fulton , is that state laws allowing development agreements and state laws designed to protect the environment appear to conflict . &quot; It really is a sticky situation , &quot; Fulton said . &quot; If you go_back and adjust the density , you would lose the certainty that the developer received by signing the agreement. &quot; &quot; The question then becomes , which one of these conflicting laws is more important , &quot; Fulton said . Los Angeles attorney Carla Ryhal , who specializes in development agreements , said their intent is to provide certainty that the city will not sway from its original contract . A 1993 amendment to state environmental law includes a section permitting use of a &quot; master environmental impact report , &quot; so developers and the city can evaluate a project at the outset , rather than years into it . &quot; That amendment confirms the legislation ' s intent that a development agreement is meant to provide the global framework to allow developers to take those next steps without risk , &quot; Ryhal said . &quot; Clearly , they are saying they want developers to be able to evaluate the entire project at the point of the development , not in pieces as a project proceeds , &quot; she said . But other attorneys said the issue is not clear-cut . &quot; It is fairly common that an initial ( environmental impact report ) will fail to raise important environmental issues , &quot; said Jim Moose , a Sacramento attorney who specializes in environmental law . &quot; There should be some element in a development agreement which will allow environmental issues to be addressed later on , &quot; he said . There is such a provision in Thousand Oaks ' Dos Vientos agreement , but the city and Sierra Club disagree on whether it could legally have been invoked . What this lawsuit may clarify , Fulton said , is exactly what a city can and cannot do to enforce laws after they have signed a development agreement . Several times in recent years , cities around the state have grappled with the issue , Volker said . But until now no one has brought it before a judge , he said . That is because cities and developers have been pleased with the arrangement created by the contracts , said Fulton , who publishes a statewide newsletter that tracks trends in planning law . &quot; These are popular and are frequently used because both sides get something they want , &quot; he said . &quot; The cities get things they never could ask_for without an agreement , and the developer gets the assurance his money won ' t go_down the drain. &quot; In addition , a lawyer for the Dos Vientos developer said he has always believed such prearranged deals help the environment . &quot; I believe development agreements have been supported by environmental groups for years , &quot; attorney Wayne Jett said . &quot; These agreements provide the mechanics for greater certainty that mitigation , which is often extensive and expensive , will be performed. &quot; Volker said he does not want the Thousand Oaks case to end use of development agreements , but the Sierra Club is fighting now because such a contract has been misused . &quot; All we ' re asking is that the developers be confident that all_the environmental variables have been fleshed_out before the contract is signed , &quot; Volker said , &quot; so that they don ' t find_out later that something like a major wildlife corridor is_on the land. &quot; &quot; If they did that , &quot; he said , &quot; the process would hold little risk. &quot;</TEXT>
