   <TEXT> He ' s no starting quarterback or flashy point guard . But 17-year-old Daniel Craddock has put_up numbers that would catch any college recruiter ' s eye . A 3.8 grade-point average . A respectable SAT score . A transcript adorned with advanced college credits . . . and he is African American . Small wonder that MIT , Cornell and Stanford began sending Craddock letters of interest early in his junior year at Lakewood High_School , way before he had to commit . Yet it was a UCLA recruiter that beat them to the punch , persuading Craddock to skip his senior year and go directly to the Westwood campus . &quot; Being approached by UCLA , I thought_about it and I said , ' Why not ? ' &quot; said Craddock , who hopes to become a doctor . &quot; They kept pushing me and pushing and they showed an interest in ( my ) attending UCLA. &quot; Craddock ' s story illustrates what many say has been an evolving -- and sometimes disturbing -- trend in higher education : Locked_in an escalating competition for the nation ' s top high_school achievers , especially those of color , colleges are wooing younger students . Colleges traditionally concentrate their recruiting energy on students in the last_half of their junior year or those starting their senior year who have taken the ACT assessment or the Scholastic Aptitude Test . In recent years , however , competition has led some colleges to begin indirectly cultivating those in the eighth grade or earlier . And in what some experts say is a still rare but problematic twist , more schools are signing_up the most exceptional academic stars as &quot; early admissions , &quot; plucking them from the talent pool before competitors fall_into hot pursuit . &quot; It is something we recognize that is beginning to happen and people are beginning to talk_about it , &quot; said Jeffery Tanner , associate dean of admissions at Brigham Young University and president of the American Assn . of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers , which represents academic recruiting divisions of 2 # 500 institutions . &quot; To bring a student in at a much earlier age , two years younger than their peers , I ' m not sure we ' re doing them a favor , &quot; Tanner said . Rocking -- if not robbing -- the scholastic cradle underscores a war for survival that has transformed college admissions offices over the last decade into powerful marketing enterprises that use extensive mailing_lists , consultants and sophisticated computer_programs to track potential applicants . Gone are the days when low-paid admissions officers paddled quietly in administrative backwaters , pushing papers and relying largely on institutional reputations or connections with high_school guidance counselors to steer a choice student their way . Today , admissions offices employ full-time , higher-paid talent_scouts and they cater to special market &quot; segments. &quot; USC ' s School of Architecture seeks_out minority high_school students with B + averages and an interest in the subject . Schools convene focus groups , put_up billboards , create posters worthy of the movies and mount phone campaigns . At Cal State Hayward , 150 professors have taken a &quot; telemarketing &quot; seminar and are responsible_for encouraging about 25 applicants each . For students , the recruiting blizzard can be so daunting that Hope College of Michigan has a gimmick to make its mail stand_out -- literally . It uses oversized literature calculated to stick_out of mailboxes . Ohio ' s Ashland University sends six-inch cookies from its school kitchens to 20 # 000 prospects . The reason for such razzmatazz is simple : After feasting on World_War_II GIs and their baby_boom progeny , colleges saw their primary market of 18-year-old high_school graduates shrink_from 3.2 million in 1979 to 2.4 million in 1992 . The implications were more foreboding for private_schools , which statistics show depend_on tuition for nearly 60 % of their income compared to 21 % for public institutions . But with legislatures cutting_back on subsidies , all schools have found themselves competing for customers , not unlike companies peddling rival brands of shampoo , experts say . &quot; Colleges live and die by their admissions offices , &quot; said Jennifer Britz , editor of the Lawlor Review , a new publication that caters to university marketeers . And those admissions offices have turned_to what the Review dubs &quot; techno-recruiting , &quot; the use of turbocharged computer_programs and technology to track potential clients . Using categories such_as race , family income , religious preference and the proclivity to move away from home , schools can order customized mailing_lists from the millions of students who take tests administered by the College Board in New York and American College Testing in Iowa City , Iowa . About 250 colleges also buy the College Board ' s &quot; enrollment planning &quot; computer_program , which is capable of breaking_down students who take the SAT into 304 &quot; geomarkets , &quot; classifying them by 23 academic interests and identifying a school ' s most likely institutional competitors for a student . Meanwhile , a cottage industry of private consultants helps schools shape marketing strategy , remake their brochures -- even analyze potential applicants by &quot; psychodemographics , &quot; whether families in their ZIP_code are more likely to own station_wagons or Land Rovers , for instance . At USC , admissions officials have ordered the names of 300 # 000 high_school juniors for this year ' s mailing and they will field inquiries with a new toll-free telephone_system , which automatically responds by mail within 24 hours to any student who answers a series of electronic prompts . And the marketing is not likely to stop . Although demographics show a new tidal_wave of high_school graduates will swamp the market soon , experts say admissions officers must work harder to persuade students and their parents to pay $ 100 # 000 or more for a degree at some private_schools . They also say that the new techniques have ignited an arms race between schools scouring the country for the brightest students . &quot; The recruitment of students has become one of the most competitive marketing climates in the country , &quot; said Ernest Boyer , former U.S. commissioner of education and president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching . &quot; Without question , it ' s more intense than it ' s ever been. &quot; Nowhere is the competition more intense than for top-notch minority scholars , who are attracting the kind of traffic once reserved for star athletes . Admissions officers say they are under great pressure to enroll more African Americans , Asian Americans and Latinos to diversify their campuses . The pool of minority scholars is comparatively small . Only 1 # 691 , or 2 % , of black students nationwide scored at least 600 out of a possible 800 on the verbal skills portion of the 1993 SAT test , as well as 8 # 646 or 11 % of Asian Americans and 2 # 292 or 3 % of Latinos . That compares to 58 # 802 or 9 % of white students . A 600 on both verbal and math are considered minimum scores for entrance into the country ' s top colleges . That leads to ethnic-rich Southern California , where out-of-state schools have opened 15 new regional admissions offices in recent years . The reason : California ' s secondary_school population , which will soon graduate more minorities than whites , will balloon 81 % by 2009 . &quot; A lot of colleges see California as a gold mine , &quot; said Edward Hu , Brown University ' s associate director of admissions . One prize catch is John Lindo , who sports a 3.6 grade-point average as a senior at private Loyola High_School in Los Angeles . More_than 100 schools have sent him brochures and unsolicited applications . The University of Illinois has called repeatedly . Lehigh University in Pennsylvania sends monthly newsletters . And the University of Missouri at Rolla just cannot take the hint . &quot; Even after I declared I wasn ' t interest in attending that school , I still received mail from them , apparently hoping I would change my mind , &quot; said Lindo , an African American who hopes to double major in electrical_engineering and instrumental music . The scrambling is so fierce that schools are routinely offering minority scholars expense-paid trips to their campuses . They will be paired with student guides and will sit in on classes and be encouraged to soak_up the ambience of dormitory life . Admissions officers say such campus trips are crucial because students are more likely to enroll in a school they have visited . Even the Ivy League has been forced to match these offers . Dartmouth College recently began paying_for minority recruiting visits and rival Brown pays_for several train cars of minority standouts from the Northeast to take an Amtrak caravan to its Rhode Island campus each year . One Midwestern college reportedly tried to impress a minority prospect by sending a limousine to transport her to campus . The most desperate competition involves financial_aid . College officials say they are in an escalating , hard-dollars bidding war for minority students , who often come from families who are unable to pay steep tuition . As a response , many schools offer merit scholarships or &quot; preferred packages &quot; of grants , loans and work-study jobs to minority standouts . Some schools are performing financial_aid &quot; leveraging &quot; studies that show how to attract the greatest number of students for the dollar . &quot; In these tough economic times . . . there is so_much consumerism among parents and kids that they are . . . shopping packages around , &quot; said Hu , adding that more students are paying acceptance deposits to competing schools to see which one will come_up with the most money . &quot; From our end , it ' s crazy. &quot; Harvard_University officials were shocked in 1992 when only 55 % of the eligible African Americans students decided to enroll , compared to its normal 75 % . A spokeswoman blamed competing scholarships from other schools , adding that acceptances were back to 67 % last year after Harvard redoubled minority recruiting efforts . Officials at DePauw University in Indiana grumble about a top African American prospect who was snatched away by a rival institution that offered a $ 17 # 000 scholarship -- although his father made more_than $ 400 # 000 year . And at Pomona College in Claremont , dean of admissions Bruce Poch is still smarting over one recruit who switched after a Southeast school went directly to his parent with an offer of free tuition . Such overheated recruiting has a downside for some students who get_to college only to find the work harder and the pace faster than they expected . &quot; It is not enough to recruit minorities and leave them to founder in a hostile college environment , &quot; said Reginald Wilson , one of the report ' s authors . One solution , university officials say , is to reach below the ranks of high_school seniors to &quot; grow &quot; promising minority students and get them used to the idea of attending college because some may be the first in their family with the opportunity . Admissions officers work with community-based programs such_as the Young Black Scholars , a Los Angeles-based program established to nurture African American scholarship , or they will sponsor their own summer institutes for minorities or other gifted students of all races . Britz said such outreach programs are &quot; sincere , genuine commitments to make schools more diverse. &quot; Yet recruiters also concede that these &quot; seed-planting &quot; activities pay indirect bonuses , allowing them to cultivate an emotional loyalty with younger students who are otherwise on campus to learn the finer points of debate or high_school study habits . &quot; It ' s a good recruiting tactic , &quot; said Ken Woods , Southern California regional admissions director for the University of Denver , which sponsors two summer institutes . &quot; Face it , you ' re dealing with a 14- , 15- , 16-year-old who is starting to call a faculty_member , rather than Dr. Rosen , it is ' Hey , Al . Let ' s talk physics. ' &quot; Woods said . &quot; They get_to know professors on a first-name basis . It ' s a great soft_sell ( and ) we ' re getting a database of kids. &quot; Making the pitch to younger students has become so important , said Mt . St . Mary ' s admissions director Katy Murphy , that the Brentwood Catholic women ' s school has decided to mail 10 # 000 letters of introduction to high_school sophomores next year . Experts say that schools are increasingly pushing exceptionally advanced younger students to sign_up under early admissions programs , which allow them to bypass their senior year in high_school and go_to college . Students who are typically eligible for such jump-starts have raced far ahead of their peers , plowing through their high_school requirements and piling_up college credits at community_colleges . But emotional maturity does not keep pace in many cases , college administrators say . Tanner , president of the national association representing collegiate admissions officers , said members of his group have expressed a lot of concern about this growing trend . He said the phenomenon is being spurred in part by the fact that a number of states -- including Washington , Colorado , Oregon and Utah -- allow fast learners to take a college course and earn both college credit and credit toward their high_school diploma . While UCLA snatched_up Lakewood High ' s Craddock , UCLA admissions director Rae Lee Siporin said such cases are rare and that she enrolls fewer than six early admissions students a year . &quot; They find us , I ' m not looking_for them , &quot; she said . But cross-town rival USC aggressively recruits sophomores for its competitive Resident Honors Program , allowing them to skip their senior year in high_school . Last summer , USC sent 24 # 000 letters to students who scored high on the Preliminary SAT test , offering them the opportunity to trade a room at_home for one in a campus residence_hall if they took the SAT early in their junior year and scored 1 # 250 or above . Last year , USC took 52 students into the program , including three Latinos but no blacks , a school spokesman said . University administrators say that they take great_care in selecting only those students who are socially and emotionally ready , and that the number is not expected to grow by much . Even when USC turns_down students for the program , the early contact is considered a recruiting boon . &quot; It ' s a way for us to get them early to let them know that USC cares about them , &quot; said Pennelope Von Helmolt , the program ' s associate director .</TEXT>
