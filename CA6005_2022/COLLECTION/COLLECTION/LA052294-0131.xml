   <TEXT> A microscopic Asian moth , the newest threat to Florida ' s citrus industry , is puzzling scientists and worrying growers . The citrus leafminer somehow hitchhiked into the Miami area almost a year ago and quickly established itself in much of Florida ' s 790 # 000-acre citrus belt . Officials believe it traveled_to Florida from China , Thailand or Australia in a cargo shipment or in travelers ' luggage . The insect derives its name from its habit of boring into leaves and then &quot; mining &quot; them for food . Industry leaders are scrambling to devise biological controls , since eradication is impossible . Much of the industry ' s hopes rest_on parasitic wasps . Early fears that the leafminer might severely damage this year ' s crop largely dissipated after the important spring flush of new foliage escaped serious damage . Growers are using expensive pesticides and special culturing methods in efforts to minimize expected attacks to new growth this summer and fall . The destructive pest riddled last year ' s summer flush , prompting industry officials to form a task_force to chart a battle_plan . There was some damage to young trees , but officials said it was not extensive ; however , they were unable to estimate the cost of the damage . The leafminer ' s speedy march last year through commercial groves worried many growers , according to Walter J . Kender , director of the University of Florida ' s citrus research_center in Lake Alfred . &quot; There was quite a scramble . If ( the infestation ) continued , we felt the important spring flush would be very vulnerable , &quot; Kender said . &quot; It turned_out that didn ' t happen , but we ' re still watching it very closely. &quot; Scientists and agricultural experts are confident they will learn to control the leafminer , just as they have other crop-eating bugs , pests , blights and infections that have descended on groves and citrus nurseries over the years . &quot; Right now , we ' re in a watch-and-wait period , &quot; said Phil Stansly , entomologist at the University of Florida ' s citrus research station in Immokalee . &quot; This is one of the worst pests I ' ve ever seen . But we ' ll learn to live with it just as we have with the root weevil and others . . . . Most pests are under biological control. &quot; Five separate research projects are under way in different growing regions , and University of Florida entomologist Marjorie Hoy is in Australia to collect samples of three Asian wasps introduced to combat a leafminer infestation there . Australian researchers have found that the parasites kill about 80 % of the leafminers . Wasps , often smaller than the leafminers , lay their eggs_on the body of a leafminer with larvae . When the wasp eggs hatch , they eat the miners ' larvae . Some native wasps are able to do this in a 15-day cycle . &quot; We feel that some wasps evolved specifically for that will do a better job than our native wasps are doing , &quot; said Stansly . &quot; But the natives are learning . They may have been a bigger help than we realize this spring. &quot; The leafminer has some_other natural predators : ants , spiders and the green_lacewing insect . Growers are taking the latest threat to their livelihoods in stride . &quot; We ' re fully apprised , totally familiar_with what it can do , &quot; said Doug Bournique , executive_vice_president of the Indian River Citrus League . &quot; Right now -- knock_on wood -- it ' s not a severe problem . We have problems that have been a lot more devastating. &quot; Citrus industry officials say the leafminer also has shown_up in five southwestern Florida counties and along the Gulf Coast . What happens in the groves this year is the key to control , citrus extension_agent Robert M . Turley said . &quot; Last year was a scramble to find_out about it . This year , we ' re a little better informed and well prepared . Once we ' ve gone_through a season , we ' ll know how to manage it , &quot; Turley said . It was first discovered in May , 1993 , in Homestead . Jorge Pena , an entomologist at the Tropical Research and Education Center in Homestead , said about 3 # 000 acres of lime groves were quickly infested . By summer , the leafminer had traveled as far as the Florida-Georgia border . There has been speculation that the insect was carried from West Africa by winds and ocean waves that became south Florida ' s Hurricane Andrew in August , 1992 . But most scientists consider that theory far-fetched . Pena believes it ' s possible that the hurricane helped spread the pest in South Florida after its arrival from foreign shores , probably aboard an ocean shipment .</TEXT>
