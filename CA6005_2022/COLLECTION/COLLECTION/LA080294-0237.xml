   <HEADLINE> SMALL EMPLOYERS WIN VICTORY IN AGE BIAS CASE ; LAWSUITS : THE STATE SUPREME COURT SAYS AN ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAW DOES NOT APPLY TO BUSINESSES WITH FEWER THAN FIVE WORKERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Small businesses in California cannot be sued for age discrimination under current law , the California Supreme Court held unanimously Monday . The court , reviewing an Orange County case , said the only state law that prohibits such discrimination , the Fair Employment and Housing Act , exempts employers with fewer than five workers . &quot; We conclude that there presently exists no ' fundamental policy ' which precludes age discrimination by a small employer , &quot; Justice Marvin Baxter wrote . The decision means that an estimated 552 # 800 small employers in the state cannot be held legally liable for discriminating against workers because of their age . The state Supreme Court ruling overturned a decision by the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana , which held last year that a worker who suffers age discrimination could sue the employer . The act also bans discrimination on the basis of gender , race , religion or sexual orientation . The California Supreme Court ruling is &quot; the first decision we have seen in a long , long_time out of any court that has actually recognized the right to discriminate , &quot; said Orange attorney Bruce W . Hamby , who represented the defendant in the case . Janet Jennings brought the case after losing her job of four years as a receptionist and clerical worker for James Marralle , a Newport Beach endodontist , a dentist specializing in root_canals . Jennings , who was in her early 50s , said Marralle told her in 1990 that he wanted to replace her with someone younger because her advancing age was requiring him to pay too_much toward the office pension_plan . Marralle denied the allegation , contending that Jennings quit &quot; in a huff &quot; after her request for a raise was refused . Jennings , now in her late 50s , works for a dentist in Palm Desert . &quot; I was fired because of my age , and it ' s too_bad employers are able to do that , &quot; she said Monday . &quot; The law as it stands now is not fair to me or anyone in my situation . It ' s been difficult to try to prove a point and have it go this way. &quot; Marralle said he was pleased with the decision , calling his former worker ' s claim &quot; frivolous from the start. &quot; The case , he said , has been &quot; vastly expensive &quot; for him . Hamby and other lawyers said small employers probably would still be liable for discriminating on the basis of race , gender or religion because those categories are protected by the state Constitution . But suits charging discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation -- which like age is not protected by the state Constitution -- probably would not be allowed , they added . The Legislature exempted small businesses from the anti-discrimination statute after they argued that even a single suit without merit could bankrupt a small firm . Nonprofit religious organizations also are exempt . Marvin D . Mayer , another Orange attorney who represented Jennings , called the court ' s decision outrageous . &quot; I think the Legislature should do something about it , &quot; Mayer said . Other lawyers noted that workers can still sue small employers for age and other kinds of discrimination if the employers actually harass their workers . &quot; The law requires all employers , no matter how big or how small , to keep_from harassing their employees on the basis of_age , &quot; said Joseph Posner , a member of the board of the California Employment Lawyers Assn .</TEXT>
