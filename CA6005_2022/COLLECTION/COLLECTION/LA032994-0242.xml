   <HEADLINE> U.S. RUSHES TO REASSURE JAPAN AFTER CARJACKING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the weekend slayings of two Marymount College_students sent shock_waves through Japan and Japanese American communities , U.S. dignitaries rushed Monday to reassure frantic parents and to counter charges in the Japanese media that Southern California is a gun-infested danger_zone . In Washington , State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the U.S._government is very concerned that the carjacking killings of Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura , both 19 , will create &quot; a very distorted and one-sided view of the United States abroad. &quot; President Clinton expressed condolences to Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa during a telephone_conversation about Japan ' s new economic plan . In Orange County , Gov . Pete Wilson called_on the state Legislature to impose the death_penalty on those who commit murder during a carjacking . Meanwhile , Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan called a newsconference in Los Angeles with the Japanese consul general , Seiichiro Noboru , hoping to assuage the alarm of tourism officials in Japan . &quot; Los Angeles is not a place where this or any other type of violence should be tolerated , &quot; Riordan said , vowing not to rest as mayor &quot; until Los Angeles is safe. &quot; And Noboru refrained_from making generalizations about violence in the United States , promising instead that the incident &quot; should not and will not have any effect upon the friendly_relationship between this country and Japan ( or ) . . . change the love of the Japanese people toward sunny and warm Southern California. &quot; But those promises faced an uphill battle against a growing impression in Japan that the United States is a dangerous and violent society that , unlike Japan , has done little to control the use and ownership of guns . &quot; Gun Society . . . Another Tragedy in Los Angeles , &quot; trumpeted one headline in the newspaper Sankei Sports . &quot; For a Car ? &quot; Added an editorial in the Japan Times : &quot; A beginning must be made to combat the American gun culture , which is getting_out of control. &quot; The Mainichi Shimbun headlined its story , &quot; One More Nightmare in the Gun Society. &quot; The Asahi Shimbun commented on its front page : &quot; Isn ' t it strange that in the country that leads the civilized world , you never know where or when somebody will be shot ? &quot; Ito , a Japanese citizen , and Matsuura , who was born in the United States but grew_up in Japan , were shot in the head Friday night during a carjacking in the parking_lot of a San Pedro supermarket . The two teen-agers died Sunday after being taken_off life-support systems at Harbor-UCLA Medical_Center . Police -- who remained close-mouthed about the case -- recovered the white 1994 Honda Civic on Sunday not far from the scene of the crime . Meanwhile , Japanese students in Southern California reported that parents have been calling frantically from abroad , hoping to persuade their children to return home . More_than 3 million Japanese tourists and students visit the United States each year , about one in six of them bound for Los Angeles County . At Santa Monica College , there are 600 Japanese students -- more_than any other foreign nationality . Aside from the damage the slayings could do to Los Angeles ' international reputation , officials said , the deaths could cause financial repercussions . Some smaller colleges have become increasingly dependent_on Japanese enrollment , and even before the killings , many students had trouble convincing their parents that the United States -- and Los Angeles in particular -- was a safe place to attend school . Such concerns have helped dampen the flow of students from Japan to the United States in recent years , although the slumping Japanese economy and the increasing popularity of European destinations have also been factors . The number of Japanese students in the United States jumped from 17 # 000 in 1983 to a peak of nearly 58 # 000 in 1990 , aided by the strong yen , but slipped to about 40 # 000 last year , according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service . Meanwhile , Los Angeles-area tourism officials expressed concerns about the impact the slayings will have_on the flow of nearly 500 # 000 Japanese who visit Los Angeles County annually . &quot; The Japanese tourist market is much more volatile and problematic than most , &quot; said Stanley Plog , a travel and tourism research specialist . &quot; There have been no cancellations , but I think it will affect tourism , not dramatically or immediately , but gradually , &quot; said Shiro Monden , the Los Angeles general_manager of Japan Travel Bureau International , a large Japanese tour operator that sends about 100 # 000 customers a year to Southern California . The killings in Los Angeles , which have sparked outrage locally and abroad and which have been widely covered by the Japanese news media , have fed a longstanding Japanese perception that the United States is a dangerous place . Shooting deaths of Japanese students in Baton_Rouge , La. , in 1992 and in Northern California in 1993 were covered by the Japanese press as continuing evidence of the ruthlessness of America ' s &quot; gun society. &quot; &quot; After the ( Baton_Rouge ) killing , of course we were worried sick to have a child go_to the U.S. , &quot; said Rumiko Ito , mother of Takuma Ito , on a Japanese television broadcast . &quot; We said : ' Why would you even think_of going_to that country ? ' But this was his dream , to go_to college there. &quot; Nao Murakami , a 20-year-old student attending El Camino College , said that her mother called Sunday and talked for two hours , trying to persuade her to come_back to Japan . Murakami said she is not sure what she will do , but &quot; when I heard the news I wanted to go_back to Japan . I ' m very afraid. &quot; Her mother asked that she not go_out after 7 p.m. , and Murakami agreed . That is a big change from life in Japan , where women are accustomed to walking the streets of Tokyo alone , even late at night , without fear . Other Japanese students say that the incident has not changed their plans . One friend of the slain students said at the hospital Sunday that he had no plans to return to Japan . &quot; We knew things like this could happen . If someone is killed , it ' s not so strange , &quot; said the student , who asked not to be named . It is too early to know whether the incident will have any impact on enrollment of Japanese students at local colleges . Southern California is the most popular foreign destination for Japanese students , according to Japanese education sources . A significant part of the 40 # 000 Japanese who come_to study in the United States each year head for Los Angeles , attracted by its reputation for beaches , good_weather and easygoing atmosphere . But Masaru Yamada , president of ICS , a Japanese company that facilitates foreign study programs , said the impact of the slayings could be significant . The news , he noted , hit just as students are preparing their applications for summer study-abroad programs . He said he expects some students to change their destinations from Los Angeles to smaller_towns in the United States or to Australia , Canada or Britain , which are perceived as safer . Study-abroad programs are big business in Japan , where students pay companies such_as ICS $ 3 # 000 or more for help in getting_into an American college -- on top of tuition and living fees . Yamada said his company held a board_meeting to figure_out a strategy to respond to what may be fewer applications . If the image of Los Angeles as a dangerous place does cause a sharp drop_in foreign admissions , it could have a financial impact on such institutions as Santa Monica College . &quot; In terms of the population from Asia , they are paying non-resident tuition , so certainly the loss of large_numbers of students would reduce the income to the college , &quot; said Susan Moore , a counselor at the college . But she stressed that the most important impact would be a need for more counseling to help students cope_with increased fears of violence . On the tourism front , officials of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau said Monday that they have contacted major Japanese tour wholesalers to head_off any concerns . Michael Collins , the bureau ' s public affairs vice_president , stressed that Los Angeles is a relatively safe destination compared to other major U.S. cities . &quot; We want to emphasize that this is a horrible exception , &quot; Collins said . &quot; But it ' s the exceptions that get the news. &quot; Times staff writers Shawn Hubler , Deborah Schoch , Anna Cekola , David Reyes , Gebe Martinez and Bettina Boxall contributed to this story .</TEXT>
