   <TEXT> A SENSE OF MISSION : Historic Churches of the Southwest text by Thomas A . Drain , photographs by David Wakely ( Chronicle : $ 18.95 ; 132 pp. , paperback original ) . Wakely ' s luminous photographs and Drain ' s thoughtful text stress that the missions in California , Arizona , New Mexico and Texas represent a fusion of Spanish , Moorish and Pueblo traditions in architecture and decoration . The stark white facade of San Jose ' ? ? ? De Laguna in New Mexico conceals flamboyant wall_paintings that recall Pueblo pottery ; Nuestra Senora de la Purisima Conception typifies the colonial baroque style -- except for the traditional Mexican image of a mysterious face peering out of the rising sun . This emphasis on cultural cross-pollination makes &quot; A Sense of Mission &quot; an enriching guide book .</TEXT>
