   <TEXT> Every week , Larry Lewis salvages 3 # 000 wire shirt hangers . Every few months , he dumps 100 pounds worth of old invoices into the recycling bin.And every day , he saves dozens of plastic bags . Such painstaking conservation efforts earned Lewis ' workplace , the Westlake Village Cleaners , one of Thousand Oaks ' 1994 Waste Watch awards . And Lewis plans to display the honor prominently , as part of his ongoing effort to woo new customers by emphasizing his environment-friendly practices . &quot; It costs a little more , but customers really pay_attention , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; We have gained a lot of customers because people know we recycle . This recognition should be beneficial. &quot; Westlake Village Cleaners won the city award in the waste reduction category , for recycling clothes_hangers , plastic bags , invoice slips and cardboard boxes . Other winners in that category were biotechnology giant Amgen and the Body Shop , which sells bath lotions and cosmetics . In other categories , the city honored Lindsay Jackson Designs for reusing materials at_work , and bestowed gold medals for recycling on Corlund Electronics , the Tri-Valley Environmental Committee and Pep Boys . Mrs . Gooch ' s Natural Foods Market won for consistently buying recycled products . &quot; It is important to recognize business and nonprofit agencies for their efforts to reduce waste , &quot; Mayor Elois Zeanah said . &quot; Every little bit helps. &quot; Those interested in more information about effective waste reduction can call the city ' s Recycling Hotline at 496-8679 .
