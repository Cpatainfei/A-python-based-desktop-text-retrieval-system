   <HEADLINE> GUNMAN SEEMED TO HAVE A HIT LIST ; SHOOTINGS : THE DISGRUNTLED FORMER WORKER MOVED THROUGH SANTA FE SPRINGS PLANT METHODICALLY , WARNING SOME AND TARGETING OTHERS , WITNESSES SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A disgruntled former employee who killed three co-workers and wounded two others before killing himself at a Santa Fe Springs electronics plant appeared to have methodically chosen his victims , witnesses said Tuesday . But at least one victim of the shooting rampage said he had no idea why he was targeted by Tuan Nguyen , a 29-year-old Huntington Beach assembly worker who had been employed for less than three months at Extron Electronics , the scene of Monday ' s violence . Shifting painfully in his bed at Harbor-UCLA Medical_Center , 26-year-old Hoa Pham , a Westminster assembly worker who was shot twice by Nguyen , said he knew Nguyen only as a work acquaintance and did not recognize him as the gunman until after he read newspaper accounts of the incident . Indeed , Pham and others said , Nguyen had remained a mystery during his short stint at Extron . Of the people he sought_out in the manufacturing plant , they said , only one seemed a likely target for his rage -- his immediate supervisor , who had fired him 2 1 / 2 weeks ago for unsatisfactory performance , and who escaped the attack because she was out_to lunch . The reconstruction of the rampage came as the families of Nguyen ' s victims and the gunman ' s former co-workers struggled to absorb the shock of the incident . The co-workers , who earn $ 8 to $ 9 an hour producing interfaces that connect computers to video screens , said that until Monday they had considered the Extron plant a safe place to work . Access to the building is controlled by door locks that can be opened only by punching a secret , five-digit code , and witnesses said Nguyen entered the building just like a regular employee . The families of those who died were crushed by the senseless violence of the attack . &quot; I don ' t understand , &quot; said the weeping sister of 27-year-old Chin ( Chris ) Van Nguyen , an electronics repairman from Garden Grove who died in the attack . The repairman -- who is not related to the gunman -- was shot twice in the back . Workers who knew him said he had once been featured as a model employee in a company newsletter . He had become a U.S. citizen last year , and had celebrated by changing his name to Christopher Arthur Newell . Engaged to be married , they said , he recently had been awarded a bachelor ' s degree from a technical_school , and was hoping to move to a better-paying engineering job . &quot; Chin always helped so many people , &quot; said his sister , her eyes and face swollen with grief . &quot; Why would someone like that be shot ? &quot; Witnesses had few clues to his motive , but said Tuan Nguyen moved methodically through the assembly_plant singling_out one employee after another . Survivors said he went so far as_to warn some bystanders to &quot; get_down &quot; or &quot; get_out &quot; while he stalked his targets . Hermes Bagnol , a 33-year-old La Habra product tester , was one of the lucky ones . Bagnol said he had just crossed the room when Nguyen burst in . He said he looked_up just in time to see the gunman take_aim at Son ( Sonny ) Van Truong . Truong , a technician from Pomona who was among the most skilled employees at the plant , had told friends that he hoped to someday earn enough money to open his own TV repair_shop . As Bagnol stood , thunderstruck , the gunman shot Truong in the back of the head , killing him instantly . The gunfire was enough to send Bagnol scrambling into a corner to hide ; Nguyen , he said , never saw him as he turned and rushed into the next room . From his vantage_point , Bagnol said , he could see Nguyen take_aim at co-worker Hoa Pham , who had ducked under a table , and shoot him in the buttocks . Then the gunman paused to reload , Bagnol said . &quot; that ' s when I ran , &quot; he said . &quot; He just yelled , ' Get_down ! Get_down ! ' He was out of his mind maybe . He was mad . He was angry. &quot; Witnesses said Nguyen fled into yet another part of the building , brushing past worker Song Sabandith , 36 , of Placentia . Without warning , Sabandith said , the gunman raised his pistol and shot the co-worker he knew only by his new American name , Chris , twice in the back . Petrified , Sabandith threw his hands_over his head and cried_out in his native Laotian , &quot; Man , don ' t shoot ! I surrender ! &quot; Then , he recalled , he dropped to his knees and prayed as the gunman -- obviously in search of someone -- rushed into another room , then left it and kicked open the door of a bathroom and then stormed into a third room where he fired twice more . Those shots , Sabandith said , were the gunman ' s last , and were fired in the office of Nguyen ' s immediate supervisor , Laura Ferrino of Murrieta . Sabandith said that when Nguyen burst into the office and found Ferrino out_to lunch , he turned and shot the woman at the desk next to hers , a more skilled employee who had helped train him when he was hired . The shot , which killed Thu ( Theresa ) Pham of Santa Ana , apparently was the gunman ' s next to last round . Authorities said Nguyen ' s final bullet was reserved for himself . Deputies said he was still clutching the pistol when they found his body . Gary Kayye , a company vice_president , said Extron is providing individual and group counseling for employees , who were told to take Tuesday afternoon and today off . &quot; I think it ' s hitting everybody more_than yesterday , &quot; worker Pat Topete said . &quot; It ' s hard to believe this happened here. &quot; Worker Connie De Diego said her reaction was more anger than disbelief . &quot; How do you react ? &quot; she snapped . &quot; This is supposed to be a civilized society . Then people turn_into animals. &quot; Times staff writers Lily Dizon and Thuan Le and community correspondent Psyche Pascual contributed to this story .</TEXT>
