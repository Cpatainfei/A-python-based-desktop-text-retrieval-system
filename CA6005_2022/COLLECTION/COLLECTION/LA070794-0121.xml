   <HEADLINE> SUMMER BRINGS WARNINGS ABOUT DANGERS OF DROWNING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When 2-year-old Rebecca Boice drowned last month in her grandparents ' Claremont swimming_pool , she became the third toddler in three days to die in a pool in the Los Angeles area . Along with the season of hot , sunny days comes increased danger for young children near swimming_pools . Last year , 36 children younger than 5 drowned in Los Angeles County , according to statistics from the County Health Department . For every child who drowns , many others suffer from a near-drowning episode , said Billie Weiss , a Los Angeles County Health Department epidemiologist and director of the department ' s injury and violence prevention program . Drowning is the leading cause of death for children ages 1 to 5 in California , Weiss said , adding that most of the deaths occur in back-yard swimming_pools . &quot; People see a pool as recreation , &quot; Weiss said . &quot; They don ' t see it as a risk for young children. &quot; Weiss recommends creating layers of protection for a child : * Put a barrier fence between the house and the pool . The fence should contain self-closing , self-latching gates and should have vertical openings no wider than four inches . The fence should be at least 50 inches high and the latching device should be located where children cannot reach it . * Install an approved pool cover with a lock , and keep it closed and locked when the pool is not in_use . * Keep lifesaving devices , such_as lifesaving rings and a long stick_with a hook_on it , near the pool in case a child falls_in . * Keep a phone in the pool area so you don ' t have to go inside to answer the phone and so you can call 911 immediately if necessary . * Learn CPR . &quot; Had somebody at the ( Claremont ) scene known CPR . . . maybe that could have made the difference , &quot; Claremont Police Lt . Ted Kamena said of Rebecca ' s June 8 death . * Don ' t rely_on the child ' s swimming expertise . Children who know how to swim often don ' t remember when they fall_in the water . Twenty-five_percent of the children who drown have had swimming lessons . * Never leave a child alone in or near a pool , bathtub or any body_of_water . All caretakers should know how to swim and know water rescue techniques . The San Gabriel Valley Drowning Prevention Task_Force offers literature on the subject .
