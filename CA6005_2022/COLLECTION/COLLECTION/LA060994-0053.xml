   <HEADLINE> MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK : CAIN HOPES TO LASSO A VICTORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steer_roping and bull riding seem like a strange background for Jet Ski_racing , but it has been a natural transition for Jerry Cain of Newhall , a one-time rodeo champion who is now campaigning on the Budweiser Jet Sports Tour as a Sea-Doo rider . &quot; Balance is so important in team roping and riding bulls , and I found_out last year when I tried racing Jet Skis that balance was just as important in riding one of them , too , &quot; Cain said . He also found he could get more speed by pressing_down_on his heels while bouncing across the water , a maneuver similar to one he used 20 years ago when he pushed his heels in the stirrups while riding horses on the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Assn . circuit . Cain , 37 , is one of more_than 250 touring professionals and amateurs who will compete this weekend in the Westcoast Performance Nationals on Puddingstone Lake at Bonelli Regional County Park near San Dimas . It is the second stop of a 10-event national series featuring 24 classes in closed course , slalom and freestyle divisions . Amateur finals for men and women will be held Saturday ; professionals will race Sunday . Cain was California champion in team roping when he was 22 , then retired to start his own merchant financial assistance business in Newhall . Four years ago , he bought a vacation_home on Mohave Lake , where he and his wife began riding Sea-Doos on weekends . &quot; After a_couple_of years , my friends quit riding with me because they said I was too aggressive , &quot; Cain said . &quot; One day , I saw a Jet Ski_race on TV and I said , ' I can do that. ' The next weekend , I tried it and I ' ve been racing almost every weekend since. &quot; Last year , Cain planned to enter only the San Diego and Los Angeles races on the national schedule , but after a surprising victory in one event , he decided to tackle the full tour . &quot; It was really a lark , &quot; he said . &quot; We didn ' t even have a truck or trailer and we had to leave on Wednesday to make the next race at Denver . We bought the truck about an hour before we took off. &quot; Cain won four national events and qualified for the Skat-Trak World Finals last October at Lake Havasu City , Ariz. , where he won the International Jet Sport Boating Assn. ' s amateur / expert championship before an estimated 35 # 000 spectators . &quot; The world championship is a one-day event , not a series , and it all came_down to a race between the oldest competitor , me , and the youngest , Chris Mays , who was 14 and looked younger . He won the slalom and I was second , but I had better finishes than he did_in the limited and modified events , so I won overall. &quot; Cain moved_up to the professional ranks this year , and last week in the season opener at San Diego ' s Mission Bay he finished third in the slalom , posting the fastest time of his career . &quot; I ' ve turned what_for many my age is strictly a means of recreational enjoyment ( into a way ) to fulfill my competitive fire , &quot; Cain said . &quot; I ' m proof that anyone at any age can enjoy personal watercraft. &quot; Mays , of Vero Beach , Fla. , is still competing as an amateur / expert . Last week at San Diego , he swept all events and is expected to do the same at Puddingstone . Christy Carlson , 23 , a five-time national champion from San Diego , is favored in the women ' s professional class after setting a world closed-course slalom record last week on her Kawasaki . The men ' s favorite is Victor Sheldon of Vista , also a Kawasaki rider , who is the defending national champion . Sheldon , 27 , started the 1994 season by winning overall honors at San Diego .
