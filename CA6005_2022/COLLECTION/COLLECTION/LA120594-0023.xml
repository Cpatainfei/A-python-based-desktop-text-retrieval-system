   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON HUMAN_RIGHTS ; PATIENCE WORKS BETTER THAN BLUSTER ; THE WINDS OF CHANGE THAT FOSTER DEMOCRATIC GROWTH ALSO UNDERMINE OFFICIAL CRUSADING . A STRONG U.S. IS OUR BEST POLICY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From Bosnia to China , from Haiti to Rwanda , America ' s human-rights policy is a shambles . Not only has Washington failed to significantly ameliorate human-rights problems around the world ; many of its efforts also have threatened U.S. security and economic interests and antagonized even fellow democracies . Clearly , the standard explanations -- allegedly naive campaign promises , allegedly inept diplomacy -- no longer suffice . Instead , the very idea of a government-centered human-rights policy has become obsolete in the post-Cold War era -- swamped , ironically , by the very forces that only yesterday generated widespread American expectations of a dawning human-rights golden_age . As both liberals and conservatives saw it , America would no longer have to back dictators for anti-Soviet reasons . Communism ' s collapse would bring the blessings of national self-determination to numerous captive peoples . And the global revolutions in communications and commerce would spread democracy and free_enterprise to even the most repressive societies . Yet two of the main features of the post-Cold War world are overwhelming the impact of any government ' s policies on democracy ' s progress . The first entails the so-called failed states that have been exposed by the Soviet collapse in Eurasia and by the end of superpower confrontation throughout the Third_World . The outrages in the world ' s Bosnias and Somalias are usually called &quot; human-rights violations , &quot; but this phrase trivializes the problem . These horrendous conditions reflect nothing less than a monumental struggle not over the issues of democratization but of basic coherence . If success is achieved -- and in many places , that ' s a big &quot; if &quot; -- it will result overwhelmingly from developments on the level of day-to-day human life , from the uncontrollable impact over many decades of the countless decisions taken by individuals and groups that ultimately define their identities . Outsiders ' actions can only have marginal effects . The second feature explains America ' s problems in pressing for human_rights in more advanced repressive countries such_as China : The accelerated global economic and cultural interaction lying behind so_much recent human-rights optimism is the very force that has dwarfed government human-rights policies . Precisely because governments , businesses and individuals can now interact so easily in so many different ways , government actions inevitably get lost in the shuffle . Western and American values will not be the only seeds dropped_by the gales of commerce , information and culture blowing around the world today . But if we want them to spread , then we should lead from strength . We should add energetically to America ' s already vast commercial , cultural and ideological influence around the world , rather than replace it with legislation or executive orders . The China issue , along with last year ' s controversy over NAFTA , does highlight one rights-related issue that demands better U.S._government policies : the question of how most of our work_force can benefit from American trade with countries that repress labor rights . American workers are already exposed to strong competition from hundreds of millions of workers in developing countries who are highly educated and highly productive in the service of the world ' s leading multinational corporations . Yet they earn a fraction of American wages and are usually denied the right to form independent unions , bargain collectively or strike . Lack of labor rights is hardly the only reason for their success , but it can create major competitive advantages . Unlike other human-rights issues , labor-rights issues directly affect millions of Americans . But they are_best seen not as human-rights issues at all , rather as challenges in managing interdependence -- in ensuring that the great integrative forces shaping the world economy enrich , not impoverish , most Americans . Nor can labor-rights problems be solved by acting_out the stylized morality_plays dominating human-rights policy today -- by issuing the same voluminous reports detailing rights and wrongs around the world and the same somber condemnations of wrongdoing , or by attempts to dictate the social and economic priorities of other countries . Instead , these problems require a raft of competitiveness policies designed to increase U.S. economic power and leverage . Flourishing U.S. markets and abundant supplies of U.S. capital and technology will give other countries powerful incentives to conform_to our labor , environmental and other standards voluntarily -- not as acknowledgments of American moral superiority or as acts of surrender , but simply as the price of access . Crusading for utopian change around the world will rarely achieve the goals Americans set . Our best bets are measures that enable this nation to survive , flourish and bargain successfully in the deeply flawed world that we will remain stuck_with for many decades to come .</TEXT>
