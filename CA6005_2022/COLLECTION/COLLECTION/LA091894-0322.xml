   <HEADLINE> HOW FUND FAILED THEM ; TEACHERS ' RELIANCE ON COLLEAGUES COST DEARLY WHEN LAND DEALS SOURED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The teachers ' lounge at Commonwealth Elementary School in Fullerton was an unlikely place for financial wheeling and dealing . Visitors were more likely to find teachers Louise Carmichael ) and Norma Elgas ) swapping stories about wayward students as they shared their brown-bag lunches . But Carmichael was eager to listen one afternoon in 1972 when Elgas , a popular sixth-grade teacher , mentioned a Newport Beach investment_company with the motto &quot; Teachers Helping Teachers. &quot; Elgas talked enthusiastically about Teachers Management &amp; Investment Corp. , a small company that was giving hundreds of Southern California educators access to the booming California real_estate market by putting_up as little as $ 1 # 000 . As_many as 300 schoolteachers across California were moonlighting as part-timers for TMI , as it was called , using low-key but effective sales pitches . Though Elgas was not an official salesperson , she did not hesitate to talk_about her successful investing with the company . &quot; She just told me about TMI like you would tell someone , ' Oh , Mervyn ' s has some real pretty T-shirts , ' &quot; Carmichael said . Carmichael , now 62 , and her husband , Elmer , eventually invested $ 195 # 000 of their retirement money through real_estate partnerships marketed by TMI . And , as California ' s real_estate market thrived , the investments paid solid dividends . But , as real_estate prices soured in recent years , the returns have dwindled -- or disappeared . Even 67-year-old Elgas , now a retiree living_in Arroyo Grande near San Luis Obispo , said she has no hope of recovering $ 10 # 000 of her funds , as several of her TMI investments in raw land sit stagnant , with no ready buyers for the properties . Carmichael , also now retired , says she wonders whether the company ' s motto should have been &quot; Teachers Using Teachers. &quot; In August , Carmichael and three other investors , Jean M . Sweeney of Fullerton , Katherine B . Seibert of Anaheim Hills and Stanley T . Clough filed a lawsuit against 27-year-old TMI alleging that the company is insolvent and has lost $ 100 million through fraud by its original and current owners . The suit , filed_in Orange County Superior_Court , has prompted an investigation by the state_Department of Real_Estate . TMI ' s owners deny any wrongdoing , blaming the troubled real_estate market . This week , a judge may decide whether to take_control of TMI from its current owners and appoint a receiver who would act to preserve any remaining TMI assets . Carmichael regrets her role in steering peers toward TMI . &quot; Teachers are so tired_of making decisions for kids all day , &quot; she says , &quot; so sometimes we want to leave other decisions up_to someone else , someone we trust . I feel badly because I recommended TMI to a lot of teachers . I wish I ' d kept my mouth shut. &quot; Regardless of the outcome of the investors ' suit against the company , the story of TMI offers lessons for those who covet seemingly stunning returns enjoyed by friends or professional colleagues and who are prone to get_in on the action . It also offers yet another reminder that real_estate is riskier than it seems and that investments du jour can be a road to ruin . For years , teachers had excellent reasons to talk up the company , which grew from an informal investing group led by Woodland Hills resident Donald J . Shroyer , now 73 , who spent 31 years as a teacher and principal in San Fernando Valley elementary_schools . During the 1960s , the USC graduate and a handful of other teachers augmented their salaries by dabbling_in real_estate . But when the group made its bids on houses and small tracts of land , it often lost out_to better-financed real_estate syndicates . In 1967 , a real_estate expert at UCLA recommended that the Shroyer group press state regulators to lower minimum income and net worth requirements that effectively prohibited modestly paid professionals from real_estate syndication . When a top official in the state_Department of Corporations balked , Shroyer recalls , he countered that regulators were &quot; knocking us out of the box simply because we don ' t make $ 25 # 000 a year . All I see are syndications with doctors and lawyers , people likethat. &quot; Shroyer brought along executives from the Los Angeles Teachers Credit_Union when he lobbied state_Department of Corporations officials to modify regulations governing real_estate syndicates . State regulators eventually relented , but only if investments were made in $ 1 # 000 increments and if offerings were limited to teachers , administrators and retirees with degrees . Teachers had to prove they had a net worth of at least $ 35 # 000 and $ 13 # 500 in annual income . &quot; I told him we ' re well-educated people who happen to be in a low-paying occupation , &quot; Shroyer said . &quot; I told him that if anyone needed the group buying power and expert guidance ( available through syndication ) it was teachers. &quot; TMI incorporated in 1967 with $ 250 # 000 invested by nearly 200 teachers . The fund took a conservative approach , buying tracts of land that could be resold easily and shying_away_from riskier properties . For nearly two decades , TMI surpassed its investors ' expectations . During the go-go 1980s when real_estate was king in California , TMI had no trouble assembling groups of profit-seeking teachers in hotel ballrooms , where the company would show slides , videos and charts promoting its various real_estate opportunities . And , not unlike the big , moneyed investors , teachers would gather_in homes to have drinks , nibble cheese and talk_about the latest investment -- in this case a TMI-backed real_estate deal being offered . At one small party in Fullerton , investors sipped Parducci wine as TMI touted a partnership for the Parducci winery in Northern California . To join TMI , a teacher would pay $ 1 # 000 for each unit stake in a partnership that would in turn pool investors ' funds to buy a real_estate project -- either a hotel , raw land , a shopping_center or agricultural parcels -- on the hope that the values would increase or even skyrocket . Investors could pick which of many partnerships they wanted to join . To keep the property maintained , investors would pay an additional fee of about $ 75 every three months . When the land was sold , investors would get their principal back , plus hoped-for double-digit returns . In those early years , TMI hired expert accountants , lawyers and administrators to run the business , including real_estate_broker Robert W . Fitzpatrick , who became president in 1968 . It hired hundreds of teachers to sell its partnerships . About 200 still sell annuities and other types of retirement investments for TMI Lifeplans , a company affiliate . Fresno resident Dee Marlin , a 68-year-old retiree , was one of those early salespeople . Between 1978 and 1991 , when Marlin served as TMI ' s regional manager in the Central Valley , all but one of his 42-person staff were educators . &quot; I had five doctors_of_education working for me , &quot; Marlin said . &quot; One time I sat_down and counted : Those teachers had 115 degrees among them. &quot; Though the moonlighting teachers rang_up a $ 60 commission on every $ 1 # 000 partnership unit they sold , Shroyer was confident that the sales force would n ' t oversell : &quot; I thought that , if you ' re going to be having coffee with the teachers the next day , you ' d better not be putting them into anything bad. &quot; That connection -- a company founded by teachers that employed teachers to sell exclusively to teachers -- was the key to the young company ' s growth . In 1987 , Fitzpatrick said in a press_release that loyalty remained strong : &quot; We still make house calls , as our teachers know each other . If a client can ' t attend a symposium to see a video presentation of a new offering , we will bring it to your family_room in your own home. &quot; That familial approach , though , sometimes lulls investors into a false sense of security , said Sanford Goodkin , a San Diego-based real_estate consultant . &quot; Teachers , God bless them , are here to educate the brains of our children , and doctors are wonderful in healing , but they are both lousy investors , &quot; Goodkin said . &quot; Some of the most successful people in the world have gotten screwed in real estate. &quot; Joe Cotchett , a Bay Area lawyer who has represented thousands of disgruntled investors in lawsuits filed against their advisers , said it ' s only natural , though , to follow the lead of acquaintances who have been successful . &quot; We call it the herd syndrome , &quot; Cotchett said . &quot; It comes_in all walks_of_life , and it ' s not just the uninformed that march down the path . Quite to the contrary , it ' s the very informed -- or those who think that they ' re very informed. &quot; One of the early investors who profited was Jim McDonald ( of Laguna Beach , a professor at Saddleback Community_College in Mission Viejo , who still has $ 100 # 000 invested with TMI . The 60-year-old educator said he reaped returns of 300 % on two of the more_than 20 partnerships he joined . He and others say that the only fair way to gauge TMI ' s performance is to track how all_of its various investments have performed over the years , rather than focus_on the recent troubles of some of its partnerships . That the company had a successful track record , in fact , was the main reason its part-time sales force was able to recruit so many other investors . By the mid-1980s , though , cracks began to appear in TMI ' s foundation and its management . After a 350-page complaint from former TMI employees and sales agents , the Department of Corporations in 1984 began a two-year investigation into TMI ' s real_estate fees , travel expenses and accusations that TMI ' s former management made profits on land sales , which should have gone instead to TMI investors . Officials concluded the investigation by ruling that there was no evidence of wrongdoing . Today , the department has turned_down requests by angry investors to investigate the present owners of TMI , though the current allegations are different and are aimed only at TMI ' s latest owners . About the same time as the earlier investigation , two TMI directors decided they wanted to sell their 75 % stake . So TMI President Fitzpatrick arranged for Centennial Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Rosa to buy_it . Within a year , though , Centennial was in financial trouble , and federal regulators took it over , then offered to sell the stake in TMI back to Fitzpatrick . Not having the funds , he turned_to James R . Martin , a longtime Peat Marwick accountant who had been auditing TMI ' s books , and Maurice B . Shuman , an accountant turned entrepreneur . The two businessmen combined a $ 4-million bank loan and $ 3 million in cash from Brentwood Associates , a Los Angeles venture_capital group , to buy TMI in 1987 . Because they did not think Fitzpatrick was in touch with the rapidly changing real_estate market or familiar_with new tax laws , Shuman and Martin said in a recent interview , they asked him to leave the company after the sale . Fitzpatrick declined to be interviewed for this story . * Shuman , Martin and Brentwood Associates all had high hopes for TMI and the real_estate , hotel and other commercial properties they inherited . &quot; It was very exciting , &quot; Martin said recently , because TMI &quot; had the portfolio and the track record. &quot; Tim Pennington , general partner with Brentwood Associates , said in a statement at the time of the sale , &quot; We believe that there is much more market penetration available and waiting. &quot; But these days , Pennington admits that Brentwood ' s 42 % stake in TMI has not been a winner . Although the venture_capital company , with $ 400 million in assets under management , takes a hands-on approach to its investments , that wasn ' t the case with TMI . &quot; This very difficult real_estate market had been tough on all_the TMI investors , including Brentwood Associates , &quot; Pennington said . &quot; Can TMI turn_around ? that ' s dependent_on this real_estate market. &quot; It ' s also dependent_on the skills of Shuman and Martin -- former accountants turned investment_bankers who met in Seattle during the 1960s . The two longtime associates are experienced investors , having held stakes in everything from oil and gas partnerships to a gold mine , in addition to fishing_boats , cattle and a wine importing business . Shuman once made headlines in the state of Washington , after officials forced him to pay $ 200 # 000 in restitution when a funeral_home company he owned was charged in one of the state ' s largest consumer fraud protection suits . Washington officials said Shuman had failed to abide_by a state law requiring that his company set_aside money in a trust_fund for people who had prearranged purchase of cemetery plots . Despite their lengthy investment history , Shuman and Martin said neither they , Brentwood nor the investors realized that the California real_estate market was_on the brink of a precipitous decline . What happened to one particular parcel of TMI land illustrates how the company ' s investments came under siege . In 1982 , a TMI limited partnership paid $ 5.7 million for 75 undeveloped acres near the U.S.-Mexico border . Glossy color brochures projected a holding period of &quot; two to three years &quot; before the property could be sold . And as late as 1989 a general partners ' report stated that &quot; The stage is set . The players know their parts . . . . It is not whether we profit on Otay Mesa . It is only a question of when and how much . We like our chances. &quot; The partnership spent more money for permits to develop the land and later used the property as collateral for a $ 4-million loan . By 1993 , the company acknowledged in a report to investors that a long-awaited industrial surge in the area has &quot; subsequently ' fizzled ' and died out. &quot; Unable to make payments on its debt and in an attempt to stave_off foreclosure , the Otay Mesa partnership filed for bankruptcy protection in June , 1993 . Today , because of plummeting land values , the tract is worth only $ 1.7 million , according to TMI ' s own estimates . It was more_than just the real_estate downturn , however , that led to the collapse of Otay Mesa International , disgruntled clients say . The recent lawsuit said that Shuman and Martin refinanced the property ' s debt three times , ending_up with a higher interest_rate that was unmanageable and also generating fees to consulting_companies such_as TMI Analysts Inc. , BR Kensington and TMI Development -- all firms wholly owned by TMI . In addition , the suit alleges that the investor partnership agreement for Otay Mesa states that TMI cannot hire consultants affiliated with TMI to develop or construct that property . As a result , Martin and Shuman allegedly violated the agreement by paying development fees to those affiliated companies -- charges the two men deny . The company ' s developed properties , too , have been hit hard . TMI spent $ 45 million , for example , to build the Ramada Renaissance Hotel in Walnut Creek , which opened in 1987 . Three years later , its value had fallen &quot; by an astounding 67 % , &quot; according to TMI . The property eventually went_into foreclosure and was sold for $ 15 million . The Sheraton Sunrise Hotel in Sacramento , which TMI built at a cost of $ 24 million , filed for bankruptcy protection in 1988 and was subsequently sold for about $ 10 million . Some investors say that more_than the real_estate downturn is behind the company ' s financial woes . The four who filed suit in Orange County blame Shuman and Martin for their losses , saying that the owners illegally used money from profitable properties to prop_up losers . The investors allege in their complaint that the men commingled funds and siphoned_off millions of dollars of investors ' money . But Maury DeWald , who is a partner with Irvine investment_firm Verity Financial and served as volunteer chairman of the Los Angles County United Way campaign from 1991 to 1993 , has nothing put praise for Martin and Shuman . &quot; Jim has always had a reputation as a resourceful , bright and knowledgeable guy , &quot; DeWald said of Martin . &quot; He ' s advised any number of businesses in terms of operating and tax strategies. &quot; DeWald , who has known Martin since the 1970s , when both men worked for accounting giant Peat Marwick , said the suit &quot; strikes me as disgruntled investors , and you have to question how many of them there really are. &quot; When Martin and Shuman bought TMI , DeWald said , &quot; they went_into it knowing that it was a long , tough road . . . . I think they simply wound_up fighting fires they didn ' t know existed. &quot; But Ron Rus , the attorney representing TMI investors in their lawsuit , thinks otherwise . &quot; They inherited these properties seven years ago , and they have had many opportunities to get_out of the hot spots , which they decline , &quot; he said . &quot; But they continued TMI in_order to collect quarterly assessments from the teachers and bleed the partnerships to perpetuate the scheme. &quot; Times librarian Sheila A .
