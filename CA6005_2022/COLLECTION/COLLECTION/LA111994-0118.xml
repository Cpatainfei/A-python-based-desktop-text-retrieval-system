   <HEADLINE> CHINA BEGINS COUNTING ' FLOATING POPULATION ' ; ASIA : ECONOMIC OPENING HAS CREATED LARGE_NUMBER OF INTERNAL MIGRANTS . GOVERNMENT FEARS CHAOS IF GROUP BECOMES DETACHED FROM NATIONAL ORDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Teams of government officials and neighborhood-watch committees fanned_out into the narrow-laned traditional hutongs and burgeoning workers ' suburbs of the Chinese capital this week as part of a historic census of migrant labor . On Nov . 10 , the first day of the census , all bus_stations , train_stations and airports were sealed while police checked the identity papers of travelers , arriving and departing . This week , they began a citywide , house-by-house survey interviewing residents and lodgers . The purpose , officials said , is to find_out just how many Beijing residents are part of the huge &quot; floating population &quot; that has surfaced in China since economic liberalization began more_than a decade ago . In Beijing alone , the number of migrants from all parts of China is estimated to be more_than 1.6 million . Nationally , the number of migrants is believed to exceed 80 million , more_than the population of Germany . Through official newspapers and special television_programs , the government has reassured migrants that the census data will not be used to punish them or evict them for living_in the city without work_permits . &quot; Please cooperate , &quot; Zou Lanchun , deputy commissioner of the Beijing Statistical Bureau , appealed in a television appearance . &quot; Don ' t worry about being charged or expelled. &quot; Underlying the government effort , however , is a widespread fear of what might go_wrong if this huge mobile population becomes untethered from the national order . The transient population is relatively new , at least in the Communist era of Chinese history . Before 1978 , when economic reform was launched by senior leader Deng Xiaoping , citizens could not buy tickets for transportation without written permission , and they could not work without permits . &quot; This is a desperate attempt to get a grip on the floating population , &quot; commented journalist Liu Yida , who has written extensively on the migrant population . Migrants are blamed by Beijing residents for much of the crime in the city . When a sensational case comes_along , such_as the murder of the wife of television_star Zhou Lijun earlier this year , it fans the flames of an already considerable prejudice against the wai di ren , or &quot; outsiders. &quot; According to the Beijing Wanbao newspaper , one of several in the city that gives extensive coverage to crime , the woman was killed by a migrant repairman from Hebei province when she surprised him attempting to rob the couple ' s apartment . In general , the migrant census has been widely welcomed by the native Beijing population . &quot; It ' s a good idea to identify all these outsiders , &quot; commented one man , the owner of a small shop selling denim jeans and jackets in the Xiaozhuang neighborhood in northeastern Beijing . Across the street , migrants from other provinces had set_up sidewalk stands selling many of the same clothing featured in his shop for much less . In one half-block stretch of the street market were migrants from four provinces : Henan , Hubei , Shandong and Anhui . &quot; I buy my jeans for 40 yuan ( about $ 5 ) and sell them for 90 , &quot; the shop owner said . &quot; that ' s the Beijing way to do business . But those people from Anhui , they will buy the same thing for 40 yuan and sell it for 45. &quot; In an attempt to prevent the census from turning_into a witch hunt , government television and newspapers have attempted to present the migrants in their most positive light , as hard-working people who do jobs that no one else will do . On the evening Beijing television_program &quot; City Government-City People , &quot; citizens testified to the value of the migrant work_force as preparers of breakfast snacks in local shops , vegetable vendors and shoe repairers . &quot; Outsiders are good at making the Beijing economy active , &quot; said one in a glowing tribute . &quot; In Beijing , no one else but the outsiders repairs our shoes . We have nowhere else to get them fixed. &quot; Already blamed for much of the urban crime in China , the floating population -- translated literally from Chinese as &quot; blind flow &quot; -- is also seen as a potentially volatile political force . Chinese officials got a sobering taste of that possibility two years ago when Muslim migrants from distant Xinjiang region , living_in the capital , threatened police with riots after one of their population was murdered with a watermelon knife by a Beijing shopkeeper . Among those being counted this week in Beijing were six young carpenters from rural Jiangsu province ; they were living_in two small rooms in the northeastern Beijing migrant neighborhood known as Six Li Village . By working_on construction projects and doing free-lance carpentry , the men said they were able to send about $ 1 a day home to their families , after their living expenses were subtracted . When construction work is slow , the men go_to the local market where they sit on the curb with a handwritten sign : &quot; I am a carpenter. &quot; Migrants complain that they are often persecuted by Beijing natives . One worker , interviewed on local television , said that bus conductors often refuse to let migrant workers aboard if they are carrying heavy packs of tools and supplies . But mixed with the resentment is a feeling of pride that a modern city is being built with their hands . &quot; We feel we have made some contribution to building our capital , &quot; said one hard-hat migrant worker on one of Beijing ' s many construction sites .</TEXT>
