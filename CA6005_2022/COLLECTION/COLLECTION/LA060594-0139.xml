   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; PATRICK REYNOLDS ; A FAMOUS TOBACCO NAME NOW FIGHTS THE SMOKING LOBBY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ashtray may soon be a collector ' s item . The nation ' s 50 million smokers are feeling_like an oppressed minority . Tobacco-control advocates have snuffed_out cigarettes in airplanes , theaters , ball parks and shopping_malls . Many cities prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places . Congress is now considering a hefty tax increase on cigarettes , a nationwide workplace smoking ban and legislation to put the sale and manufacture of tobacco products under the regulation of the Food and Drug Administration . The states of Florida and Mississippi are suing tobacco companies to recover costs of treating diseases caused by smoking . Even the military , home of &quot; Smoke ' em if you ' ve got ' em , &quot; has prohibited puffing in all but a_few designated areas . To paraphrase a famous cigarette ad : We ' ve come a long way , baby . These accomplishments to curb tobacco use are even more remarkable considering the strength of the tobacco_industry . The tobacco lobby is one of the most powerful and well-funded -- in 1991 , tobacco interests spent $ 2.7 million on lobbying and campaign contributions in California alone . That lobby reflects the earning power of the business -- in 1992 , a tobacco and food conglomerate , Philip Morris , was the most profitable in America , with nearly two-thirds of its almost $ 5 billion in profit coming from tobacco sales . One of tobacco ' s most vocal foes wears one of its most familiar names . In 1911 , R.J. Reynolds created Camel cigarettes -- the fastest-selling brand in the country today . And R.J. ' s grandson , Patrick Reynolds , 45 , works full time as a lecturer and crusader against the cigarette industry -- financing his ventures , in part , with an inheritance rooted in the tobacco fields of North Carolina . When Reynolds was a teen-ager , his father died of emphysema . Even that didn ' t stop the young Reynolds from taking_up the tobacco habit . He finally kicked it in the mid- ' 80s , after selling all his tobacco stock . In 1986 , he shocked his family by testifying on Capitol_Hill in favor of a ban on cigarette advertising , and quickly became a spokesperson for the growing tobacco-control movement . Before finding his calling as an anti-smoking crusader , Reynolds was an aspiring actor . He uses his thespian skills and his famous name to hold the media ' s attention and keep tobacco executives ' feet to the fire . He works_out of a modest home_in Beverly Hills , where he talked_about the tobacco_industry ' s impressive political power and his vision of a smoke-free America . * Question : There has been all this activity -- congressional hearings , FDA proposals to regulate smoking , workplace smoking bans . Have we reached some sort of critical mass in the anti-smoking movement ? Answer : I really hope so . I ' ve been calling_for FDA regulation of cigarettes for a long_time , and now we have an FDA administrator , David Kessler , who ' s saying the same thing . He says he ' s prepared to show that cigarette manufacturers manipulate the levels of nicotine in their products , and he ' s waiting for a mandate from Congress . The greatest thing that will come_out of FDA regulation is that manufacturers will have to print the ingredients on the packs -- so that people will know what chemicals they are ingesting when they smoke . Meanwhile , ( Rep. ) Henry Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) has a bill to ban smoking in the workplace . That would be a national ban , and , of course , the tobacco_industry is fighting it tooth and nail , with all their power and might . But the core issue , as I see it , is the power of the tobacco lobby . . . . Look what they have achieved . America has the lowest cigarette tax of any industrialized country in the world . It averages about 50 cents a pack ; in Canada , it ' s $ 3.26 a pack . We ' ve failed to ban cigarette advertising -- cigarettes are the most heavily advertised product in America . The tobacco_industry is spending somewhere around $ 4 billion a year to associate smoking with images of health and beauty and romance . Cigarette advertising is the greatest lie_in history . They ' re spending $ 15 per person , for every man , woman and child in this country , to promote smoking . And they spend freely to make_sure an advertising ban will never make_it out of committee in Congress . They are very much around at the local level , too . The tobacco lobby sends slick lawyers into state_capitals to get watered-down anti-smoking legislation passed that preempts many of the local anti-smoking ordinances we have worked so hard to put into law . Exporting of cigarettes to Asia -- again the special_interests are responsible_for that , for hundreds of millions of people becoming addicted in those countries . Back in the 1980s , Sen . Jesse Helms went_to see President Reagan , and said , &quot; We ' ve got a balance-of-payments_problem here , Ron ; how come we can ' t sell American cigarettes in some of these foreign markets ? &quot; So Reagan got the government to start pressing the Philippines , Taiwan , Thailand , Japan and said , &quot; If you don ' t lower your tariffs on our cigarettes , we ' re going to slap trade penalties on you. &quot; Those governments caved_in , lowered their import taxes on cigarettes , and then the American tobacco_industry began a full-scale ad_campaign in those countries . Partly as a result , smoking has increased 70 % around the world since 1968 . So while people think we are somehow winning the battle against smoking , we ' re actually losing when you look_at it worldwide . . . . But the real critical mass -- the paradigm shift -- may be political . For years , politicians have been able to accept huge amounts_of_money from the tobacco lobby , and vote to support the lobby ' s interests , while escaping the wrath of the public . But with so_much attention on the issue of smoking , they can ' t still look good and vote with the tobacco lobby . Q : What sort of regulation would you like to see on the sale and marketing of cigarettes ? A : Appropriate regulation -- regulation that at least duplicates what ' s going_on in other countries . We should have the warning label on the front of the pack , as Canada requires . Ban advertising and raise taxes , as Canada has done . The difference between the Canadian government and ours ? It ' s the power of the special_interests and the money that goes_into the hands of the politicians . Another important regulation would raise the age for purchasing cigarettes to 21 . It would require merchants to have a license to sell cigarettes , just like liquor . There are statistics which really make the case for this -- of all smokers , 60 % start by the age of 14 years old , and 90 % by the age of 19 . That means only one smoker in 10 starts after the age of 19 . If we can keep cigarettes away from kids until they reach 21 , we could go_a_long_way toward eliminating the problem . So the purchase of cigarettes must be regulated as seriously as alcohol . This means banning vending_machines as well . You can ' t buy a beer in a vending machine . But vending_machines are how children are getting cigarettes . Q : What sort of a tax would you like to see applied to cigarettes ? A : The direct medical costs related to smoking is $ 22 billion a year . If you divide that by the number of packs of cigarettes sold every year , the figure comes_out to $ 2.17 of direct medical costs per pack . So , at the very least , the tax should pay_for the cost of smoking . But let me make a somewhat radical proposal . I believe that the future of tobacco control may lie_in nationalizing the tobacco companies . This means that the government would pay an appropriate , or perhaps an inappropriate price for the tobacco companies and from that point forward , all_the profits would go_to Uncle_Sam . Imagine how much easier the job of tobacco control would be if there was no more money spent on lobbyists . I am not a socialist . As a rule , I don ' t believe_in nationalizing industries , but tobacco is an exception : It ' s the only product sold which , when used as intended , causes death . Q : Where do the 54 million people who smoke fit into this debate ? Don ' t we need to focus_on them at some point ? A : Yes , but I will tell you candidly that we have limited dollars -- and it costs a lot more to get someone to stop smoking than it does to educate children not to ever start smoking . It ' s vastly more costly to get addicts off cigarettes . I don ' t think we can ignore or neglect the issue of smoking cessation , however . And I think the tobacco_industry ' s assertion that smokers have choice sounds good , but how much of a choice do smokers really have when cigarettes are as addicting as heroin ? I do believe that if under Clinton ' s health-care program , employers are going_to pay_for the health_care of their employees , then smoking cessation programs should be included in the national health-care program . Q : Do you believe people have a right to smoke and , if so , what rights do they have ? A : Smoker ' s have a right to smoke , but the right of nonsmokers to breathe clean air supersedes the right of smokers . So it is very appropriate to ban smoking in the workplace , in public places like restaurants and airports , in enclosed spaces where people have to breathe . But I don ' t believe_in a cigarette prohibition . The tobacco_industry would love to have tobacco-control advocates such_as myself take the position that cigarettes should be banned , because then they could call us zealots or fanatics , and dismiss us . I take a moderate and what I feel is an appropriate position . Q : What about Hollywood ? While cigarettes have disappeared almost entirely from television , there ' s still a lot of smoking in the movies . Are you trying to do anything about that ? A : Yes , and I think we need to do something to encourage stars like Wynona Rider from chain-smoking throughout a movie like &quot; Reality Bites. &quot; We should encourage her to argue with her producers and say , &quot; Hey , I don ' t want my character to smoke ; I may be a role_model for young_women , and the last thing I want them to do is smoke cigarettes. &quot; If Wynona Rider had the courage to do that , it could make a difference . Perhaps she ' s taken an unfair beating for smoking in that movie , but that may be the kind of pressure we have to put_on stars to make them refuse to smoke in movies . And here ' s something that ' s never been printed , as far as I know . I have it on very good authority that the firm U.S. Tobacco financed a movie called &quot; Pure Country. &quot; In that movie , all_the cowboy heroes chewed tobacco , and it was financed by the company most responsible_for producing chewing tobacco . Q : Some years ago , you talked_about achieving a smoke-free America by the year 2000 . It seemed like an outrageous idea just a_few years ago , and now it ' s seeming to be something that might almost be achievable . When do you think you can put yourself out of business ? A : I don ' t think I will be out of business in my lifetime . With hundreds of millions of addicts around the world , there will always be plenty of work for tobacco-control advocates . I always point_out that , a_few years ago , we thought we ' d never get smoking off airplanes , and today we and wonder if it was really true that there ever was smoking on airplanes . So one day we are going_to look_back and say , &quot; You mean , people used to actually smoke ? &quot; That day is coming , that ' s a promise. *</TEXT>
