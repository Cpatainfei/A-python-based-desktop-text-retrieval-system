   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; IN TROUBLE AT_HOME , YELTSIN DOES AS U.S. PRESIDENTS DO ; DIPLOMACY : THE RUSSIAN FLEXES ATROPHIED SUPERPOWER MUSCLES . HE TRIES JUMP-STARTING THE MIDEAST PEACE TALKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin is stealing a page from the modern U.S. President ' s playbook : When facing domestic calamity , try foreign affairs . Russia remains a great_power that expects to play a key role in resolving international disputes , Yeltsin announced in his Feb . 24 State of the Nation speech to Parliament . His popularity sinking along with the dismal Russian economy and hard-liners nipping at his heels , the president and his men have set_out to prove they mean business . Showing that Russia intends to flex its atrophied superpower muscles not only in the former Yugoslav federation but also in the Middle_East , Yeltsin last week sent his foreign_minister to mediate between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization and try to jump-start the peace negotiations stalled by the Feb . 25 massacre of at least 30 Palestinians in a West_Bank mosque . Yeltsin also appointed a special envoy , diplomat Viktor Posuvalyuk , to handle Russia ' s Middle_East peacemaking activities . The uninvited and unannounced diplomatic overture dismayed Israeli leaders , who had earlier told Igor Ivanov , the visiting Russian first deputy foreign_minister , that Russian involvement was not welcome . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he first heard that Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev intended to visit Tel Aviv on Friday from the radio . &quot; I don ' t know why he ' s coming , &quot; Rabin said Thursday . Rabin received Kozyrev politely but told him that Russian mediation could hurt the chances for direct negotiations between Israel and the PLO , Israeli diplomatic sources said . Rabin , who was described as &quot; very annoyed , &quot; said he viewed Kozyrev ' s appearance as &quot; a sign of competition between the United States and Russia over the negotiations , &quot; diplomatic sources said . Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres left Moscow more room to maneuver , saying , &quot; We respect very much the role Russia is playing. &quot; Peres distinguished between pro-Arab Soviet-era diplomacy and the new Russian initiative , which he called &quot; really an attempt to contribute so the two parties come together. &quot; Saddled with $ 80 billion in foreign debt and once again seeking to delay its repayment schedule for 1994 , Russia is in no position to reassert its Cold War-era influence on the Middle_East by dishing_out arms and aid to its old Arab allies . As a public relations boost for Russian diplomacy , however , it certainly succeeded . In Tunis , Tunisia , on Friday , Kozyrev stood beside PLO leader Yasser Arafat and announced that the PLO was ready to resume negotiations with Israel on Palestinian self-rule in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher are expected to discuss conditions for revival of Israeli-PLO talks at a meeting Monday in the Russian port of Vladivostok , including the possibility of stationing foreign observers in the occupied territories to comply with Palestinian demands for security guarantees . Preoccupied with the disintegration of the Soviet_Union and the ensuing domestic upheavals , Moscow effectively dropped_out of the Middle_East peace process after the initial Madrid conference in October , 1991 , and has since allowed Washington to orchestrate negotiations . Posuvalyuk , the new Yeltsin envoy , said Russia once again intends to play a significant role in peacemaking in the Middle_East and in other conflicts . &quot; Russia occupies its own substantial niche in the Middle_East , which no other country can claim , due_to Russia ' s historical and spiritual uniqueness , &quot; Posuvalyuk told the newspaper Sevodnya . Just as such new rhetoric about a special Russian role in managing its neighbors ' affairs has the White_House worried , so the Russian press has begun to fret about Washington ' s new cooler tone toward Moscow . &quot; Cooling Must Not Become Confrontation , &quot; ran the headline in Saturday ' s editions of the Red Star newspaper . The paper noted that America is stepping_up its involvement with the former Soviet republics -- notably Ukraine and Georgia , whose presidents visited the United States earlier this month -- in an effort to balance Moscow ' s influence . The Izvestia newspaper wrote that U.S.-Russian relations are in &quot; a most serious crisis &quot; following the surge of nationalist and Communist forces in the December parliamentary elections and a subsequent harder line from the Kremlin . &quot; Washington cannot but be worried &quot; by the &quot; declaration of the former Soviet republics as a zone of Russian ' special_interest , ' the unwillingness to withdraw troops from Latvia and Estonia , and the decisive support for the Bosnian Serbs , &quot; the article said . Yeltsin took his defense of Russia ' s prestige to an extreme Wednesday by furiously declaring he would not receive former U.S. President Richard Nixon after Nixon first met with Yeltsin ' s political archenemies . On Saturday , in a face-saving move , Yeltsin aides announced that while the president himself could not receive Nixon because of the recent death of his mother-in-law , whose funeral was held Saturday , the ban on any government official meeting Nixon would be rescinded . Some of Yeltsin ' s new bluster may be merely a bid to improve his poll ratings . His popularity plunged after he used tanks to suppress a revolt by Parliament leaders in October , and last week for the first time he slipped behind Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin in one widely watched survey . Yeltsin faces a grim economic outlook , with unemployment rising , living standards continuing to slide and his policies under_attack in a hostile Duma . On Friday , a member of Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky ' s ultranationalist party , Sergei Kalashnikov , told a news_conference that some of Russia ' s new poor could not even afford to buy 500 grams of bread a day -- the ration that was given to the starving residents of Leningrad ( now St . Petersburg ) during the World_War_II siege of that city . And Russia ' s military , whose support was crucial to Yeltsin ' s survival in October , has launched a lobbying effort , saying it cannot survive proposed budget_cuts . Small wonder that Yeltsin , like many_a U.S. President facing a hostile Congress and a sagging economy , is angling for a foreign_policy triumph . Yet Yeltsin could succeed abroad -- and still wind_up like former Soviet leader Mikhail S . Gorbachev or former U.S. President George_Bush . &quot; Excessive activity in the international arena -- if it coincides with dramatic failures in the economy -- causes irritation rather than understanding and support , &quot; warned Andrei V . Kortunov of Moscow ' s U.S.A.-Canada Institute . &quot; Success in foreign_policy is not an answer. &quot;</TEXT>
